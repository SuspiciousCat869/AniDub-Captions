[ARTE]
What do you think?

00:00:36.578 --> 00:00:38.705 position:50% align:center
[MALTA]
Hmm. I suppose it'll do.

00:00:38.788 --> 00:00:40.040 position:50% align:center
Arrange for it to be framed.

00:00:40.123 --> 00:00:41.332 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir.

00:00:42.584 --> 00:00:45.337 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
I guess that means he approves?

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.465 position:50% align:center
[SOFIA] Really, Arte,
you've outdone yourself.

00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:51.009 position:50% align:center
I'm looking forward
to displaying it.

00:00:51.092 --> 00:00:52.969 position:50% align:center
Not as if there was
any doubt to begin with,

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:54.554 position:50% align:center
but it's simply wonderful.

00:00:54.637 --> 00:00:56.514 position:50% align:center
Don't you agree, Katarina?

00:00:57.974 --> 00:01:00.310 position:50% align:center
Certainly, and now
that it's finished,

00:01:00.393 --> 00:01:02.729 position:50% align:center
I suppose you'll be
returning home.

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:10.653 position:50% align:center
Be truthful.

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:11.780 position:50% align:center
You belong here.

00:01:11.863 --> 00:01:14.491 position:50% align:center
Don't you want
to stay in Venice?

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:16.076 position:50% align:center
[ARTE sighs]

00:03:01.306 --> 00:03:03.141 position:50% align:center
--[VERONICA] Question.
--Huh?

00:03:03.224 --> 00:03:04.267 position:50% align:center
[VERONICA]
What color are you planning

00:03:04.351 --> 00:03:06.644 position:50% align:center
to make these flowers, Leo?

00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:08.438 position:50% align:center
I was thinking of
something vibrant,

00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:10.231 position:50% align:center
either a red or a yellow.

00:03:10.315 --> 00:03:12.567 position:50% align:center
I would prefer blue
and purple, actually.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.236 position:50% align:center
Blue paint isn't exactly
cheap, you know.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.031 position:50% align:center
This painting is for a chest
going into my bedroom.

00:03:18.114 --> 00:03:20.742 position:50% align:center
Ideally, the gentlemen
should be able to relax.

00:03:20.825 --> 00:03:23.703 position:50% align:center
And besides, the cost
isn't an issue.

00:03:23.787 --> 00:03:27.290 position:50% align:center
I can't spare any expense
when it comes to my trade.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.003 position:50% align:center
How's the mural for
the church ceiling going?

00:03:32.087 --> 00:03:33.755 position:50% align:center
[LEO]
I'm managing somehow.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.259 position:50% align:center
Have you heard
anything from Arte?

00:03:38.343 --> 00:03:39.636 position:50% align:center
[LEO]
No.

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:42.097 position:50% align:center
[VERONICA] Hmm. Wasn't this
job only supposed to be

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.515 position:50% align:center
for six months?

00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:46.142 position:50% align:center
It's been longer than that
and she still isn't back.

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:49.270 position:50% align:center
Perhaps she prefers
Venice over Florence.

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.277 position:50% align:center
[DARCIA grunting]

00:03:56.361 --> 00:03:57.862 position:50% align:center
[LEO] Not exactly
discreet for a thief.

00:03:57.946 --> 00:04:02.325 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Oh no, you've got
the wrong idea! I'm--

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:05.370 position:50% align:center
[yelps, gasps]

00:04:05.453 --> 00:04:06.830 position:50% align:center
I know how this looks,
but I wasn't trying

00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:08.540 position:50% align:center
to steal anything, honest!

00:04:08.623 --> 00:04:10.458 position:50% align:center
[LEO] Hmm. Didn't you use
to come around the shop

00:04:10.542 --> 00:04:12.168 position:50% align:center
to visit Arte?

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:14.129 position:50% align:center
Darcia, if I'm not mistaken.

00:04:14.212 --> 00:04:16.214 position:50% align:center
[DARCIA]
Mm, mm, mm!

00:04:16.297 --> 00:04:20.010 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but she hasn't
returned from Venice yet.

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:22.137 position:50% align:center
[DARCIA]
Oh, I see.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.305 position:50% align:center
But will she... come back?

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:26.933 position:50% align:center
I mean, she's not going to stay
over in Venice permanently,

00:04:27.017 --> 00:04:29.060 position:50% align:center
is she?

00:04:29.144 --> 00:04:30.478 position:50% align:center
I don't know.

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:35.025 position:50% align:center
[LEO] You realize there'll come
a time when you have to leave

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:37.444 position:50% align:center
this workshop,
to venture out on your own

00:04:37.527 --> 00:04:39.112 position:50% align:center
and put your skills to use.

00:04:39.195 --> 00:04:40.989 position:50% align:center
That is, if you want to
make a proper living

00:04:41.072 --> 00:04:42.907 position:50% align:center
and put food on the table.

00:04:42.991 --> 00:04:45.076 position:50% align:center
While you're there,
think carefully,

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.746 position:50% align:center
about everything I've said.

00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:52.042 position:50% align:center
And afterwards, when six months
is up and you finish your job,

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:54.878 position:50% align:center
you don't have to return
if you don't want to.

00:05:03.762 --> 00:05:06.389 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:08.099 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
A visitor, for me?

00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:10.810 position:50% align:center
[DAPHNE]
Yes. He said his name was Matei.

00:05:10.894 --> 00:05:13.480 position:50% align:center
And that you'd met previously.

00:05:13.563 --> 00:05:15.273 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Hmm.

00:05:15.357 --> 00:05:18.818 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] I wonder what he wants,
coming here out of the blue.

00:05:18.902 --> 00:05:20.153 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Hmm...

00:05:20.236 --> 00:05:21.488 position:50% align:center
--[DAPHNE] Pardon?
--[yelps]

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:23.782 position:50% align:center
[DAPHNE]
But considering how cold it is,

00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:26.618 position:50% align:center
I think it'd be best to
let him inside quickly.

00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:29.329 position:50% align:center
Of course! That'd be
the polite thing to do!

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:40.256 position:50% align:center
I, um...

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.133 position:50% align:center
So about the other day...

00:05:42.217 --> 00:05:44.260 position:50% align:center
[MATEI]
I came to apologize to you.

00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:45.679 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:05:45.762 --> 00:05:48.139 position:50% align:center
[MATEI] If young Lady Katarina
hadn't pointed it out,

00:05:48.223 --> 00:05:50.308 position:50% align:center
I never would've realized
how thoughtless and rude

00:05:50.392 --> 00:05:52.811 position:50% align:center
my words were.

00:05:52.894 --> 00:05:55.814 position:50% align:center
Better than toiling away in
a workshop for years like me,

00:05:55.897 --> 00:05:58.692 position:50% align:center
and not being able to
get anyone's attention.

00:05:58.775 --> 00:06:02.070 position:50% align:center
For most apprentices,
that's their lot in life.

00:06:03.446 --> 00:06:06.241 position:50% align:center
Whereas you're from a noble
family, have an education,

00:06:06.324 --> 00:06:08.493 position:50% align:center
and also happen to be one of
the only female painters

00:06:08.576 --> 00:06:09.661 position:50% align:center
in the world.

00:06:09.744 --> 00:06:11.955 position:50% align:center
It must be wonderful.

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:13.790 position:50% align:center
I'm envious of you.

00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:15.667 position:50% align:center
Please, forgive me.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.129 position:50% align:center
It was as if I was saying that
you had no actual talent.

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:21.089 position:50% align:center
I'd never even seen your work.

00:06:21.172 --> 00:06:22.090 position:50% align:center
It's all right!

00:06:22.173 --> 00:06:23.842 position:50% align:center
Honestly, no need to worry!

00:06:23.925 --> 00:06:25.427 position:50% align:center
You said I was
a woman and a noble

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:26.886 position:50% align:center
and both of those
things are true!

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.014 position:50% align:center
There's no reason that
would bother me at all!

00:06:29.097 --> 00:06:32.225 position:50% align:center
You mean, what I said back at
the workshop didn't offend you

00:06:32.308 --> 00:06:34.853 position:50% align:center
or make you doubt
your abilities?

00:06:34.936 --> 00:06:36.771 position:50% align:center
It didn't, believe me.

00:06:36.855 --> 00:06:42.402 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Well, I appreciate you
sparing my feelings.

00:06:42.485 --> 00:06:45.488 position:50% align:center
However... I realize
what I meant.

00:06:45.572 --> 00:06:47.365 position:50% align:center
You were progressing
so smoothly on your way

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:50.910 position:50% align:center
to becoming a painter,
I couldn't help but feel envy.

00:06:50.994 --> 00:06:53.997 position:50% align:center
Nothing but ugly jealousy
on my part.

00:06:56.708 --> 00:06:58.376 position:50% align:center
If you really want
to know the truth,

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.254 position:50% align:center
I often find myself
jealous of men.

00:07:01.338 --> 00:07:04.591 position:50% align:center
Wondering if things would be
easier if I were a boy.

00:07:04.674 --> 00:07:06.718 position:50% align:center
Those thoughts... I've let
them cloud my judgement

00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:08.511 position:50% align:center
more than once before.

00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:11.389 position:50% align:center
If your jealousy is ugly,

00:07:11.473 --> 00:07:14.100 position:50% align:center
then mine is ugly, too,
because they mirror each other.

00:07:14.184 --> 00:07:15.477 position:50% align:center
So please.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.104 position:50% align:center
Don't be so hard on
yourself, all right, Matei?

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:21.191 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:26.821 position:50% align:center
Huh? Oh, that's the portrait I
was working on of Lady Sofia.

00:07:26.905 --> 00:07:29.741 position:50% align:center
Really? I would love
to see it, if I may.

00:07:33.036 --> 00:07:34.788 position:50% align:center
[MATEI gasps]

00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:36.998 position:50% align:center
The jewelry and lace patterns...

00:07:37.082 --> 00:07:38.667 position:50% align:center
Did you design them yourself?

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.127 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Oh. Yes! That's right.

00:07:41.211 --> 00:07:42.629 position:50% align:center
[MATEI]
Sorprendente.

00:07:42.712 --> 00:07:44.714 position:50% align:center
Such soft, expressive lines.

00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:47.175 position:50% align:center
A delicate touch with the brush.

00:07:47.258 --> 00:07:50.053 position:50% align:center
Never have I seen a woman
of such beauty and grace.

00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:52.681 position:50% align:center
Real or in a painting.

00:07:52.764 --> 00:07:54.140 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:54.224 --> 00:07:58.228 position:50% align:center
I am jealous, but it's in
the best possible way.

00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:01.815 position:50% align:center
If your style is the result of
being a woman and from nobility,

00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:06.903 position:50% align:center
then... I could never
imitate it, even if I tried.

00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:09.322 position:50% align:center
I see now. Everything,
from your gender,

00:08:09.406 --> 00:08:10.782 position:50% align:center
to where you were born,

00:08:10.865 --> 00:08:12.575 position:50% align:center
the environment you
were brought up in.

00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:15.120 position:50% align:center
All those inform
the way you paint.

00:08:15.203 --> 00:08:17.706 position:50% align:center
Please treasure the unique
voice your background gives you,

00:08:17.789 --> 00:08:20.291 position:50% align:center
and don't let envious people
like me get in the way.

00:08:22.627 --> 00:08:23.920 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:08:27.298 --> 00:08:29.134 position:50% align:center
Leo, my path...

00:08:29.217 --> 00:08:31.886 position:50% align:center
I've decided.

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:34.472 position:50% align:center
While I'm grateful
for your generous offer,

00:08:34.556 --> 00:08:38.351 position:50% align:center
I'm turning down the opportunity
to stay here in Venice.

00:08:38.435 --> 00:08:41.312 position:50% align:center
[YURI]
Hmph. You're rejecting me.

00:08:41.396 --> 00:08:42.689 position:50% align:center
For a second time.

00:08:42.772 --> 00:08:44.733 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure what
else I can offer.

00:08:44.816 --> 00:08:46.651 position:50% align:center
After all, sworn
patronage like this for

00:08:46.735 --> 00:08:49.070 position:50% align:center
an apprentice level
painter is unheard of.

00:08:49.154 --> 00:08:52.449 position:50% align:center
Anybody else in your position
would accept it in a heartbeat.

00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:54.200 position:50% align:center
I think I know
what's troubling you.

00:08:54.284 --> 00:08:56.953 position:50% align:center
The idea of being chosen
because you're a female noble

00:08:57.037 --> 00:08:58.747 position:50% align:center
still bothers you.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:00.623 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Quite the opposite.

00:09:00.707 --> 00:09:02.917 position:50% align:center
I realize now those qualities
are what set me apart

00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:04.669 position:50% align:center
from other painters
and are responsible

00:09:04.753 --> 00:09:07.005 position:50% align:center
for my specific style.

00:09:07.088 --> 00:09:09.758 position:50% align:center
By chance, you were
able to see that in me.

00:09:09.841 --> 00:09:12.260 position:50% align:center
I want to find work,
not by chance,

00:09:12.344 --> 00:09:15.472 position:50% align:center
but rather as
a result of my talents.

00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:17.307 position:50% align:center
I have worth. Confidence.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:20.101 position:50% align:center
So. I'm going back
home to Florence,

00:09:20.185 --> 00:09:22.020 position:50% align:center
and when I get there,
I'll find a wealth of customers

00:09:22.103 --> 00:09:23.688 position:50% align:center
who fulfill that want!

00:09:25.774 --> 00:09:29.778 position:50% align:center
--[YURI chuckles]
--[ARTE gasps] Uhh...?

00:09:29.861 --> 00:09:32.155 position:50% align:center
[YURI] Oh, it appears
I'm out of my depth.

00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:35.283 position:50% align:center
Looks like I have no choice
but to withdraw my offer, then.

00:09:35.367 --> 00:09:36.785 position:50% align:center
Can't be helped.

00:09:36.868 --> 00:09:39.037 position:50% align:center
After all, your strong will is
what my niece and I liked

about you in the first place.

00:09:41.081 --> 00:09:43.833 position:50% align:center
But since you see me as
a small fry, I guess that's it.

00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:46.127 position:50% align:center
Go reel in a big fish
for your next job.

No, that's not it at all!

00:09:47.712 --> 00:09:50.048 position:50% align:center
I would never imply that!

00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:53.093 position:50% align:center
Well. I know you'll do
your best out there.

Katarina.

00:10:06.856 --> 00:10:08.149 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:12.362 position:50% align:center
Do you mind if we
talk about something?

00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:13.905 position:50% align:center
[KATARINA] I know you're
leaving and there's nothing

00:10:13.988 --> 00:10:15.198 position:50% align:center
that's going to
change your mind,

00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:16.908 position:50% align:center
but could we skip the farewells?

00:10:16.991 --> 00:10:19.202 position:50% align:center
I've found that I'm
not any good at them.

00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:24.124 position:50% align:center
Ah. Hmm. Me, too.
No surprise there.

00:10:24.207 --> 00:10:26.292 position:50% align:center
I also hate having
to say goodbye.

00:10:26.376 --> 00:10:28.586 position:50% align:center
Just the same as you.

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:30.880 position:50% align:center
But there are two things
I wanted to discuss.

00:10:30.964 --> 00:10:33.299 position:50% align:center
First, about what happened
the other day at the workshop,

00:10:33.383 --> 00:10:35.719 position:50% align:center
when you got upset on
my behalf, when I wouldn't.

00:10:35.802 --> 00:10:37.721 position:50% align:center
You can't change
your birth, either.

00:10:37.804 --> 00:10:38.972 position:50% align:center
Even if someone's jealous,

00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:42.642 position:50% align:center
you have to accept it,
like I did!

00:10:42.726 --> 00:10:44.602 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] Because of the lessons
you taught me,

00:10:44.686 --> 00:10:45.854 position:50% align:center
and how you've pushed me,

00:10:45.937 --> 00:10:48.857 position:50% align:center
I was able to decide
what path I should take.

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:51.151 position:50% align:center
I'm grateful.

00:10:51.234 --> 00:10:53.737 position:50% align:center
And secondly,
if you'll allow me.

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.405 position:50% align:center
I've a favor to ask.

00:10:55.488 --> 00:10:58.867 position:50% align:center
Instead of teacher and student,
I'd like us to be friends.

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:00.785 position:50% align:center
Even though we'll be
separated by distance,

00:11:00.869 --> 00:11:03.538 position:50% align:center
I'll stay in touch by sending
you lots of letters.

00:11:03.621 --> 00:11:05.415 position:50% align:center
And I hope to receive
several from you,

00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:07.292 position:50% align:center
letting me know
how you're doing.

00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:09.586 position:50% align:center
You... mean it?

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:11.755 position:50% align:center
Yes! What do you say?

00:11:18.219 --> 00:11:21.514 position:50% align:center
Very well, but you better
make sure to write me a lot.

00:11:21.598 --> 00:11:24.726 position:50% align:center
Same goes for you.
I look forward to it!

00:11:27.771 --> 00:11:30.398 position:50% align:center
Please, excuse me,
but I need to pack.

00:11:30.482 --> 00:11:31.858 position:50% align:center
Addio, Katarina.

00:11:31.941 --> 00:11:33.276 position:50% align:center
Ah! Wait!

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:37.072 position:50% align:center
[KATARINA]
My portrait...

00:11:37.155 --> 00:11:39.491 position:50% align:center
I really love how it turned out.

00:11:39.574 --> 00:11:42.535 position:50% align:center
I'll treasure it always.

00:11:42.619 --> 00:11:46.247 position:50% align:center
And I'm honored you find it
to your liking, my lady.

00:12:04.766 --> 00:12:06.476 position:50% align:center
[KATARINA]
I'll cherish it.

00:12:10.313 --> 00:12:12.941 position:50% align:center
[KATARINA]
Along with all of our memories.

00:12:19.322 --> 00:12:20.865 position:50% align:center

Nearly there.

00:12:27.539 --> 00:12:29.666 position:50% align:center

I'm almost back in Florence.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.753 position:50% align:center

Just a little further...

00:12:40.385 --> 00:12:41.970 position:50% align:center

Finally home.

00:12:43.888 --> 00:12:45.306 position:50% align:center

To Leo!

[ARTE groans]

00:12:51.479 --> 00:12:53.732 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] But what am I going
to say when I see him?

[ARTE groans]

00:12:56.526 --> 00:12:57.819 position:50% align:center

00:13:01.072 --> 00:13:02.198 position:50% align:center
You surprised?

00:13:02.282 --> 00:13:05.118 position:50% align:center
I know I'm later than I
planned, but I'm back!

00:13:07.662 --> 00:13:09.831 position:50% align:center
Leo? Are you here?

00:13:11.833 --> 00:13:14.210 position:50% align:center
There you are!

00:13:14.294 --> 00:13:15.795 position:50% align:center

Darcia? What are you doing here?

00:13:18.173 --> 00:13:21.259 position:50% align:center
I thought you came back
because you heard about Leo!

00:13:21.343 --> 00:13:23.928 position:50% align:center
Did something happen
to him while I was away?

00:13:24.012 --> 00:13:25.305 position:50% align:center
No one told you?

00:13:25.388 --> 00:13:28.099 position:50% align:center
Leo has a fever and has
been sick for several days.

00:13:28.183 --> 00:13:29.809 position:50% align:center
He's not waking up.

00:13:29.893 --> 00:13:33.646 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
You have to tell me where he is!

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:36.232 position:50% align:center
Um, over at
Ubertino's residence.

00:13:36.316 --> 00:13:37.942 position:50% align:center
I'm here 'cause I was
asked to come and get

00:13:38.026 --> 00:13:39.444 position:50% align:center
a change of clothes.

00:13:39.527 --> 00:13:41.863 position:50% align:center
[ARTE gasps]
Leo!

00:13:46.368 --> 00:13:48.787 position:50% align:center
Look who it is.
Back from Venice, huh?

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:50.288 position:50% align:center
Darcia said Leo was here!

00:13:50.372 --> 00:13:51.706 position:50% align:center
I need to see him!

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:54.459 position:50% align:center
[UBERTINO] Hmm. He's asleep
in the detached room.

00:13:54.542 --> 00:13:56.753 position:50% align:center
Then he's... Just how bad is it?

00:13:56.836 --> 00:13:59.172 position:50% align:center
That monello will
pull through, relax.

00:13:59.255 --> 00:14:03.551 position:50% align:center
[gasps, sighs]
What a relief.

00:14:03.635 --> 00:14:05.303 position:50% align:center
[UBERTINO] I'm worried
more about the ceiling mural

00:14:05.387 --> 00:14:10.350 position:50% align:center
than his health.
It's far from complete.

00:14:10.433 --> 00:14:11.685 position:50% align:center
What mural?

00:14:11.768 --> 00:14:13.812 position:50% align:center
I hired your master to
paint a church ceiling

00:14:13.895 --> 00:14:15.522 position:50% align:center
before he fell ill.

00:14:15.605 --> 00:14:17.190 position:50% align:center
It needs to be
completed by Easter,

00:14:17.273 --> 00:14:19.234 position:50% align:center
but I don't see how anymore.

they're amazing.

Remarkable as they are,
it doesn't matter until

00:14:38.294 --> 00:14:40.171 position:50% align:center
they've been painted in.

00:14:40.255 --> 00:14:42.465 position:50% align:center
Where am I going to find
someone to complete his work

00:14:42.549 --> 00:14:44.676 position:50% align:center

00:14:49.973 --> 00:14:51.516 position:50% align:center
Let me. With your permission,

00:14:51.599 --> 00:14:53.852 position:50% align:center
I'll finish the
assignment for him.

[UBERTINO]
Hmm?

00:14:55.395 --> 00:14:56.771 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] I can't guarantee
the mural will turn out the way

00:14:56.855 --> 00:14:58.398 position:50% align:center
Leo was planning.

00:14:58.481 --> 00:15:00.525 position:50% align:center
But it's my responsibility
to see the project through

00:15:00.608 --> 00:15:01.901 position:50% align:center
to the end!

00:15:01.985 --> 00:15:03.820 position:50% align:center
Our workshop took on this
commission and I'm still

00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:05.655 position:50% align:center
a member of it!

00:15:05.739 --> 00:15:07.240 position:50% align:center
Perhaps, but...

00:15:07.323 --> 00:15:09.909 position:50% align:center
I beg you! If I
start painting right now,

00:15:09.993 --> 00:15:12.996 position:50% align:center
then I can have it completed
by the Sunday deadline!

Hmm...

00:15:14.706 --> 00:15:16.916 position:50% align:center
Please give me this chance!

[ARTE] Leo's drawings
really are incredible.

00:15:25.216 --> 00:15:27.552 position:50% align:center
In his altarpiece,
he rendered the Virgin Mary

00:15:27.635 --> 00:15:32.057 position:50% align:center
as dignified, yet still gave
her a soft, caring expression.

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:35.643 position:50% align:center
With a gaze that watches over
and envelops everyone.

00:15:35.727 --> 00:15:39.731 position:50% align:center
When I was in Venice, that
altarpiece helped keep me going.

to be seen by more people.

you were back in Florence?
