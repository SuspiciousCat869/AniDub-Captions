[KATARINA]
Uncle Yuri!

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:39.497 position:50% align:center
Since you extended
an invitation to Arte,

00:00:39.581 --> 00:00:42.042 position:50% align:center
I assume that means she
knows about your hobby?

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:45.754 position:50% align:center
Yes, although I didn't
mean for her to.

00:00:45.837 --> 00:00:47.630 position:50% align:center
Today's dinner is a bribe,
so don't go

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:49.507 position:50% align:center
blabbering about it later!

00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:51.343 position:50% align:center
Okay...

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.855 position:50% align:center
[KATARINA] Wait until you see
the kitchen Uncle Yuri has!

00:02:26.938 --> 00:02:29.190 position:50% align:center
I'm looking forward to
working with you all today!

00:02:29.274 --> 00:02:30.859 position:50% align:center
--Welcome back, Lady Katarina!
--It's good to see you!

00:02:30.942 --> 00:02:32.444 position:50% align:center
We missed you!

00:02:32.527 --> 00:02:34.863 position:50% align:center
Now. May the cooking begin!

00:02:34.946 --> 00:02:37.115 position:50% align:center
Everyone! Stations!

00:02:37.198 --> 00:02:38.742 position:50% align:center
[SERVANTS murmuring]

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:40.869 position:50% align:center
--Done?
--I'll use that broth later.

00:02:40.952 --> 00:02:42.537 position:50% align:center
Leave the skins on.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.247 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
I'm speechless.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.915 position:50% align:center
Her expression.

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:48.877 position:50% align:center
I didn't know she
could look this happy.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.128 position:50% align:center
[YURI]
All right, gather around!

00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:51.629 position:50% align:center
The food is ready!

00:02:51.713 --> 00:02:53.715 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] You're handling
serving duties, Yuri?

00:02:53.798 --> 00:02:55.925 position:50% align:center
At my niece's dinners,
the rule is that those

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:57.260 position:50% align:center
who don't contribute
in some way

00:02:57.344 --> 00:02:58.636 position:50% align:center
aren't allowed to eat.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.637 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
I see.

00:02:59.721 --> 00:03:03.058 position:50% align:center
[SERVANTS gasping, laughing]

00:03:03.141 --> 00:03:04.642 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] It's wonderful
eating with everyone,

00:03:04.726 --> 00:03:07.687 position:50% align:center
and seeing how much
they appreciate the food!

00:03:07.771 --> 00:03:11.149 position:50% align:center
So, tell me, Katarina, when'd
you discover you liked cooking?

00:03:11.232 --> 00:03:12.233 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:15.403 --> 00:03:16.613 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:18.531 position:50% align:center
[GIMO]
Katarina, I'm coming in.

00:03:18.615 --> 00:03:20.658 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:20.742 --> 00:03:23.995 position:50% align:center
If you're hungry, I made a bowl
of the pancotto that you like.

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.539 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
My favorite!

00:03:26.623 --> 00:03:28.500 position:50% align:center
Technically, I'm the
one who prepared it,

00:03:28.583 --> 00:03:30.001 position:50% align:center
but Gimo helped out some.

00:03:30.085 --> 00:03:31.252 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:03:31.336 --> 00:03:33.838 position:50% align:center
You were the helper--
I did most of the work!

00:03:40.095 --> 00:03:41.554 position:50% align:center
It's so yummy!

00:03:41.638 --> 00:03:43.598 position:50% align:center
The best way to wake up!

00:03:44.766 --> 00:03:47.394 position:50% align:center
I remember never wanting
to forget that flavor,

00:03:47.477 --> 00:03:49.896 position:50% align:center
so I learned how to
cook the dish myself.

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:51.231 position:50% align:center
I think I know the recipe.

00:03:51.314 --> 00:03:53.149 position:50% align:center
It's made with
stale bread, right?

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:55.443 position:50% align:center
We both know how nobles eat.

00:03:55.527 --> 00:03:57.195 position:50% align:center
Even their food is meant
to separate them

00:03:57.278 --> 00:03:59.280 position:50% align:center
from lower classes--
The poor.

00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:01.241 position:50% align:center
I don't understand it.

00:04:01.324 --> 00:04:03.576 position:50% align:center
Why do they want
to be so different?

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.495 position:50% align:center
--Huh?
--Ah?

00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:07.747 position:50% align:center
We're taught to
have straight posture--

00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:13.044 position:50% align:center
step back with one foot--
and gently lift up the hem.

00:04:13.128 --> 00:04:16.464 position:50% align:center
Even something so unassuming as
a greeting is used to show off

00:04:16.548 --> 00:04:18.091 position:50% align:center
and set nobles apart.

00:04:18.174 --> 00:04:19.551 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:19.634 --> 00:04:22.053 position:50% align:center
I could never imagine doing
something so embarrassing

00:04:22.137 --> 00:04:23.388 position:50% align:center
in public.

00:04:29.602 --> 00:04:31.896 position:50% align:center
[YURI] My niece is
something else, isn't she?

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.857 position:50% align:center
It's impressive that
you've gotten this far,

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.650 position:50% align:center
even being invited
to her dinner.

00:04:35.734 --> 00:04:37.652 position:50% align:center
Of all of her tutors,
you're the first one

00:04:37.736 --> 00:04:39.487 position:50% align:center
she's been this fond of.

00:04:39.571 --> 00:04:42.574 position:50% align:center
I'm pleased to see my faith
in you wasn't misplaced.

00:04:42.657 --> 00:04:46.036 position:50% align:center
Right, glad to hear.

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:47.579 position:50% align:center
Yuri...

00:04:47.662 --> 00:04:50.415 position:50% align:center
When Katarina returned from
the villa where she was raised,

00:04:50.498 --> 00:04:52.625 position:50% align:center
was she already acting this way?

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:55.003 position:50% align:center
Huh? And what "way" is that?

00:04:55.086 --> 00:04:56.713 position:50% align:center
"Stubborn" is one word for it,

00:04:56.796 --> 00:04:58.840 position:50% align:center
or like she has her
heart closed off.

00:04:58.923 --> 00:05:00.675 position:50% align:center
It's possible that something
happened to her

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:02.385 position:50% align:center
before she came home.

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:05.430 position:50% align:center
[YURI] Hmm... If you promise
to see the job through

00:05:05.513 --> 00:05:08.058 position:50% align:center
until your work is completed,
then I'll tell you

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:10.018 position:50% align:center
everything I know.

00:05:10.101 --> 00:05:13.521 position:50% align:center
Until... my work's done.

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:17.442 position:50% align:center
What's the matter, Arte?
Are you having some doubts?

00:05:17.525 --> 00:05:18.943 position:50% align:center
That's not like you.

00:05:19.027 --> 00:05:21.821 position:50% align:center
I'm confident, it's just...

00:05:21.905 --> 00:05:23.865 position:50% align:center
I was hoping that you could
help shed some light

00:05:23.948 --> 00:05:25.784 position:50% align:center
on something for me, Yuri.

00:05:25.867 --> 00:05:27.369 position:50% align:center
I can try.

00:05:27.452 --> 00:05:31.873 position:50% align:center
Tell me: When I was hired, who
was it for and for what purpose?

00:05:31.956 --> 00:05:35.293 position:50% align:center
For the sake of
Katarina's happiness.

00:05:35.377 --> 00:05:39.589 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Of course.

00:05:39.673 --> 00:05:42.676 position:50% align:center
I'll help her.
You have my word.

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:44.386 position:50% align:center
Whatever it takes,
I'm going to make sure

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:47.430 position:50% align:center
Katarina can find her happiness.

00:05:47.514 --> 00:05:50.642 position:50% align:center
[YURI]
Hmm. As you know,

00:05:50.725 --> 00:05:52.686 position:50% align:center
it's normal for wet nurses
to raise children

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:54.521 position:50% align:center
from wealthy families.

00:05:54.604 --> 00:05:56.690 position:50% align:center
Katarina was no different.

00:05:56.773 --> 00:05:58.733 position:50% align:center
Buona, the wife of
our villa's cook,

00:05:58.817 --> 00:06:03.405 position:50% align:center
met the necessary qualifications
and thus was given the job.

00:06:03.488 --> 00:06:06.491 position:50% align:center
After my niece was born,
she was taken far from Venice,

00:06:06.574 --> 00:06:09.869 position:50% align:center
and raised in our aforementioned
countryside villa.

00:06:09.953 --> 00:06:12.288 position:50% align:center
My older brother couldn't care
less about her upbringing

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:14.249 position:50% align:center
since she was a girl.

00:06:14.332 --> 00:06:15.750 position:50% align:center
In terms of money and servants,

00:06:15.834 --> 00:06:18.920 position:50% align:center
he sent the bare
minimum to the villa.

00:06:19.004 --> 00:06:21.089 position:50% align:center
Fortunately, Buona
was hardworking

00:06:21.172 --> 00:06:24.217 position:50% align:center
and made herself useful.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.220 position:50% align:center
Her son, Gimo, was
two years older than Katarina,

00:06:27.303 --> 00:06:29.639 position:50% align:center
and they grew up together.

00:06:29.723 --> 00:06:32.058 position:50% align:center
Despite the difference
in class, he loved her like

00:06:32.142 --> 00:06:34.644 position:50% align:center
she was his sister.

00:06:34.728 --> 00:06:37.105 position:50% align:center
However, when my niece was six,

00:06:37.188 --> 00:06:39.399 position:50% align:center
Buona died from
a sudden illness,

00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:42.527 position:50% align:center
and Katarina was abruptly
called back to Venice.

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.904 position:50% align:center
[KATARINA sobbing]

00:06:44.988 --> 00:06:48.324 position:50% align:center
[YURI]
Katarina... I'm here.

00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:50.910 position:50% align:center
Uncle Yuri...

00:06:50.994 --> 00:06:54.330 position:50% align:center
Is there anything I can do
to help stop those tears?

00:06:55.623 --> 00:06:58.960 position:50% align:center
I want... pancotto.

00:06:59.044 --> 00:07:00.337 position:50% align:center
[YURI]
Hmm.

00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:07.177 position:50% align:center
In the short time
I've been here,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.803 position:50% align:center
one thing has become clear.

00:07:08.887 --> 00:07:11.598 position:50% align:center
Katarina has no interest
acting like a noble.

00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:13.975 position:50% align:center
I wonder if that's because
she sees Buona and Gimo

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:15.685 position:50% align:center
as her real family.

00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:18.313 position:50% align:center
Yes. I think so.

00:07:18.396 --> 00:07:20.857 position:50% align:center
Regardless, there's no changing
the fact that my brother

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:24.277 position:50% align:center
and sister-in-law
are her one true family.

00:07:24.361 --> 00:07:25.945 position:50% align:center
Venice is her home.

00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:28.615 position:50% align:center
Where she belongs and
where her happiness should lie.

00:07:28.698 --> 00:07:30.700 position:50% align:center
But until she accepts
that and moves on,

00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:33.578 position:50% align:center
she'll continue to be miserable.

00:07:33.661 --> 00:07:35.205 position:50% align:center
That's what I believe.

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:44.255 position:50% align:center
Yuri. It would probably be
better if I didn't let

00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:47.342 position:50% align:center
Katarina know you shared
her story with me, right?

00:07:47.425 --> 00:07:48.843 position:50% align:center
[YURI]
Huh.

00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:52.222 position:50% align:center
Before you leave, I told Arte
about how you were raised.

00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:53.598 position:50% align:center
Hope that's okay!

00:07:53.682 --> 00:07:54.891 position:50% align:center
Augh!

00:07:54.974 --> 00:07:58.144 position:50% align:center
There you go,
saved you the trouble.

00:07:58.228 --> 00:07:59.562 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
What was he thinking?

00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:02.023 position:50% align:center
That's not what I meant!

00:08:02.107 --> 00:08:05.110 position:50% align:center
How's he expect me to explain
what that was all about?

00:08:05.193 --> 00:08:07.153 position:50% align:center
Look. I'm, um...

00:08:07.237 --> 00:08:08.822 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:08:08.905 --> 00:08:10.615 position:50% align:center
Why are you apologizing?

00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:12.492 position:50% align:center
I thought you were
angry with me.

00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:16.037 position:50% align:center
Not really.
I'm not upset by such matters.

00:08:16.121 --> 00:08:17.122 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Huh?

00:08:17.205 --> 00:08:18.873 position:50% align:center
I was wondering
what took you so long,

00:08:18.957 --> 00:08:20.667 position:50% align:center
considering how
much you love to pry.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.085 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Guh!

00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:25.130 position:50% align:center
Rest assured, if I look
like I'm in a bad mood,

00:08:25.213 --> 00:08:27.632 position:50% align:center
you should know,
it has nothing to do with you.

00:08:27.716 --> 00:08:29.592 position:50% align:center
It's because I'm being
forced to go back there,

00:08:29.676 --> 00:08:31.594 position:50% align:center
when I'd really rather not.

00:08:31.678 --> 00:08:33.179 position:50% align:center
[ARTE gasps]

00:08:33.263 --> 00:08:36.891 position:50% align:center
What does she mean by "there"?
Is she referring to her home?

00:08:36.975 --> 00:08:39.310 position:50% align:center
[It's good to have you back
at the house, my lady.

00:08:39.394 --> 00:08:40.854 position:50% align:center
That's the report, sir.

00:08:40.937 --> 00:08:44.691 position:50% align:center
You're back. Off visiting Yuri's
place I imagine. Now then...

00:08:44.774 --> 00:08:46.818 position:50% align:center
I appreciate you accompanying
my daughter along

00:08:46.901 --> 00:08:49.237 position:50% align:center
on her trip, Arte.
Thank you, again.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.365 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] No need!
I didn't really do anything.

00:08:53.867 --> 00:08:55.368 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Wait a minute...

00:08:56.786 --> 00:08:58.329 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
What's happening?

00:08:59.914 --> 00:09:02.584 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] That's it.
Since we've arrived...

00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:04.627 position:50% align:center
...Katarina's been ignored.

00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:07.005 position:50% align:center
No one's looked at her twice.

00:09:10.216 --> 00:09:12.510 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] The way I see it,
unless things change,

00:09:12.594 --> 00:09:15.096 position:50% align:center
Katarina will never
be happy living here.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:16.890 position:50% align:center
I'm sure it'd be a different
story if somehow

00:09:16.973 --> 00:09:18.808 position:50% align:center
Buona were still alive.

00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:23.188 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
That's it!

00:09:24.856 --> 00:09:26.441 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:09:26.524 --> 00:09:30.028 position:50% align:center
Katarina! Let's go see Gimo!

00:09:30.111 --> 00:09:32.614 position:50% align:center
Huh? You don't seem surprised.

00:09:32.697 --> 00:09:35.200 position:50% align:center
I'm not. Like I said,
you're predictable.

00:09:35.283 --> 00:09:38.536 position:50% align:center
And besides, it won't do
any good seeing him again.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.289 position:50% align:center
Huh? Why not?

00:09:41.373 --> 00:09:44.292 position:50% align:center
[BUONA] This is no way
to behave, Lady Katarina.

00:09:44.376 --> 00:09:45.585 position:50% align:center
I'm only your wet nurse.

00:09:45.669 --> 00:09:46.961 position:50% align:center
You can't think of me
as your mother.

00:09:47.045 --> 00:09:50.090 position:50% align:center
You already have one!
What would Lady Sofia think?

00:09:50.173 --> 00:09:53.968 position:50% align:center
She's not my mother!
I don't know her!

00:09:54.052 --> 00:09:55.595 position:50% align:center
You don't mean that.

00:09:55.679 --> 00:09:58.306 position:50% align:center
I've never seen or
met her before.

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:01.768 position:50% align:center
You're the only mother
I've ever known, Buona!

00:10:01.851 --> 00:10:05.105 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Listen to me, Lady Katarina.

00:10:05.188 --> 00:10:08.650 position:50% align:center
Gimo and I love you, but we
will never be your real family.

00:10:08.733 --> 00:10:09.984 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.613 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:10:13.697 --> 00:10:14.864 position:50% align:center
[sobs]

00:10:14.948 --> 00:10:16.908 position:50% align:center
I don't ever want
to see you again!

00:10:16.991 --> 00:10:19.911 position:50% align:center
[sobbing]

00:10:19.994 --> 00:10:21.538 position:50% align:center
[KATARINA]
My wish came true.

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:24.332 position:50% align:center
That was the last time
I spoke to Buona.

00:10:24.416 --> 00:10:27.711 position:50% align:center
She came down with
an illness and died suddenly.

00:10:27.794 --> 00:10:30.005 position:50% align:center
I never saw Gimo again, either.

00:10:30.088 --> 00:10:33.008 position:50% align:center
I didn't get the chance
to say goodbye.

00:10:33.091 --> 00:10:35.885 position:50% align:center
After that, I was
brought to this house.

00:10:35.969 --> 00:10:39.764 position:50% align:center
The sadness was unbearable,
so I wrote Gimo a letter.

00:10:42.517 --> 00:10:43.977 position:50% align:center
[GIMO]
I won't see you again.

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.146 position:50% align:center
Please don't
write to me anymore.

00:10:47.564 --> 00:10:49.274 position:50% align:center
And that was that.

00:10:49.357 --> 00:10:54.487 position:50% align:center
In the end, they never
saw me as part of their family.

00:10:54.571 --> 00:10:58.700 position:50% align:center
Sorry, this must be
incredibly awkward for you.

00:10:58.783 --> 00:10:59.701 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
What do you mean?

00:10:59.784 --> 00:11:01.619 position:50% align:center
All I'm doing is listening!

00:11:01.703 --> 00:11:04.956 position:50% align:center
It's practically written
all over your face.

00:11:06.041 --> 00:11:08.126 position:50% align:center
I'd like you to paint
my portrait, too.

00:11:08.209 --> 00:11:09.461 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:09.544 --> 00:11:11.004 position:50% align:center
Hopefully, it'll help
things get back to normal

00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:12.797 position:50% align:center
around this place.

00:11:12.881 --> 00:11:15.508 position:50% align:center
Besides, do you have any idea
how annoying it is for me

00:11:15.592 --> 00:11:17.761 position:50% align:center
to see you this depressed?

00:11:17.844 --> 00:11:20.972 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Hmm. Right! Deal!

00:11:21.056 --> 00:11:23.725 position:50% align:center
Just wait! You're gonna
love the painting!

00:11:23.808 --> 00:11:25.727 position:50% align:center
Yes! I'm going to make
this portrait look like

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:28.438 position:50% align:center
I spent all my wages
on materials!

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.195 position:50% align:center
Now, what kind of
painting should I make?

00:11:35.278 --> 00:11:37.489 position:50% align:center
One of these sketches
has to work.

00:11:37.572 --> 00:11:38.865 position:50% align:center
Ah. Very nice!

00:11:38.948 --> 00:11:42.369 position:50% align:center
Waugh! When did
you get here, Yuri?!

00:11:42.452 --> 00:11:45.038 position:50% align:center
The rumor going around is
that you're looking for Gimo.

00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:47.248 position:50% align:center
But... how'd you...?

00:11:47.332 --> 00:11:49.918 position:50% align:center
For future reference, you can't
hide anything that goes on

00:11:50.001 --> 00:11:52.045 position:50% align:center
in this house from me.

00:11:52.128 --> 00:11:54.047 position:50% align:center
I understand you
haven't found him.

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.424 position:50% align:center
No, I don't have any leads yet.

00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:01.805 position:50% align:center
Murano Island,
that's where I'd look.

00:12:01.888 --> 00:12:03.765 position:50% align:center
But you told me that she...

00:12:03.848 --> 00:12:06.643 position:50% align:center
What I said the other day was
simply my personal opinion,

00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:07.894 position:50% align:center
nothing more.

00:12:07.977 --> 00:12:09.437 position:50% align:center
If you think you know
what it will take for

00:12:09.521 --> 00:12:12.774 position:50% align:center
my niece to be happy,
then please make it so.

00:12:12.857 --> 00:12:14.025 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm off.

00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:17.821 position:50% align:center
Wait. Is that it, Yuri?

00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:19.030 position:50% align:center
Oh, was there more?

00:12:19.114 --> 00:12:21.533 position:50% align:center
No. I'm confused, though.

00:12:21.616 --> 00:12:25.370 position:50% align:center
We hardly know each other, but
you have so much faith in me.

00:12:25.453 --> 00:12:28.206 position:50% align:center
Well. I wouldn't
put it like that.

00:12:28.289 --> 00:12:31.042 position:50% align:center
It's not that I have faith
in you, necessarily.

00:12:32.627 --> 00:12:34.629 position:50% align:center
It's more that I have complete
faith in my decision

00:12:34.713 --> 00:12:37.382 position:50% align:center
to select you as her new tutor.

00:12:37.465 --> 00:12:38.883 position:50% align:center
[ARTE sighs]

00:12:43.304 --> 00:12:48.309 position:50% align:center
He may be confident, but I have
no idea what to do now.

00:12:48.393 --> 00:12:49.686 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:12:50.812 --> 00:12:52.063 position:50% align:center
I'm at a standstill.

00:12:52.147 --> 00:12:53.314 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:12:53.398 --> 00:12:56.693 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Hmm? Yes? Come in!

00:12:56.776 --> 00:13:00.488 position:50% align:center
Um. Miss Arte?
Lady Sofia's waiting for you.

00:13:00.572 --> 00:13:03.908 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
What? Oh, no! Not good!

00:13:03.992 --> 00:13:07.328 position:50% align:center
I forgot I was supposed
to paint her portrait today!

00:13:07.412 --> 00:13:10.915 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:13:10.999 --> 00:13:12.334 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
How unprofessional.

00:13:12.417 --> 00:13:14.294 position:50% align:center
I have no excuse
for being this late.

00:13:14.377 --> 00:13:17.464 position:50% align:center
[MALTA] I swear, can nothing
be done about that girl?!

00:13:17.547 --> 00:13:20.091 position:50% align:center
She may've turned out
better looking than I expected,

00:13:20.175 --> 00:13:21.259 position:50% align:center
but without poise and grace,

00:13:21.343 --> 00:13:23.470 position:50% align:center
she's utterly
useless to our family!

00:13:23.553 --> 00:13:25.513 position:50% align:center
At this rate, no one will end up
marrying her without

00:13:25.597 --> 00:13:28.475 position:50% align:center
an exorbitant dowry
as compensation.

00:13:28.558 --> 00:13:31.102 position:50% align:center
That's why girls are
nothing but a liability.

00:13:31.186 --> 00:13:34.189 position:50% align:center
It'd be better for all of us
if she joined a convent.

00:13:34.272 --> 00:13:36.399 position:50% align:center
Darling, please.

00:13:36.483 --> 00:13:38.276 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
It brings back memories.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.737 position:50% align:center
I've overheard a private
conversation between parents

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.322 position:50% align:center
once before.

00:13:42.405 --> 00:13:45.367 position:50% align:center
Mother did always oppose
my father's way of doing things

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:49.454 position:50% align:center
and constantly argued with him.
However, it wasn't like this.

00:13:49.537 --> 00:13:52.207 position:50% align:center
They did always manage
to agree on one thing.

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:54.584 position:50% align:center
They both wanted
what was best for me.

00:13:58.505 --> 00:14:01.591 position:50% align:center
[MALTA] What am I supposed
to do with her? Hmm?

00:14:01.675 --> 00:14:04.761 position:50% align:center
You, girl, my brother is paying
you a sizable amount of money.

00:14:04.844 --> 00:14:08.264 position:50% align:center
I don't care what methods you
use, just train my daughter.

00:14:10.517 --> 00:14:13.311 position:50% align:center
I'm not here to listen to you.

00:14:13.395 --> 00:14:16.272 position:50% align:center
Huh? What did you
just say to me?

00:14:16.356 --> 00:14:20.110 position:50% align:center
I said the reason I was hired
was for Katarina's sake,

00:14:20.193 --> 00:14:21.569 position:50% align:center
not yours.

00:14:21.653 --> 00:14:23.822 position:50% align:center
And I wouldn't be doing
my job if I listened to someone

00:14:23.905 --> 00:14:26.116 position:50% align:center
who selfishly puts
his finances and wants

00:14:26.199 --> 00:14:28.660 position:50% align:center
above the happiness
of his own daughter!

00:14:28.743 --> 00:14:30.578 position:50% align:center
How dare you!

00:14:30.662 --> 00:14:32.080 position:50% align:center
[SOFIA gasps]

00:14:37.961 --> 00:14:40.505 position:50% align:center
And you. Why do
you never speak up

00:14:40.588 --> 00:14:43.049 position:50% align:center
when Katarina is being
talked about in this way?

00:14:43.133 --> 00:14:44.175 position:50% align:center
You don't actually agree with

00:14:44.259 --> 00:14:46.594 position:50% align:center
what he's saying
about her, do you?

00:14:46.678 --> 00:14:49.180 position:50% align:center
Growing up, my parents often
argued about what they thought

00:14:49.264 --> 00:14:51.891 position:50% align:center
was best for me, and there
were plenty of times

00:14:51.975 --> 00:14:55.395 position:50% align:center
when what they wanted wasn't the
life I envisioned for myself!

00:14:55.478 --> 00:14:59.399 position:50% align:center
Even so, their goal was
always to ensure my happiness.

00:14:59.482 --> 00:15:01.735 position:50% align:center
Meanwhile, here you are,
wondering why your daughter

00:15:01.818 --> 00:15:04.404 position:50% align:center
refuses to open up to you,
when you've never even

00:15:04.487 --> 00:15:06.740 position:50% align:center
asked her once
what she wants in life!

00:15:06.823 --> 00:15:08.241 position:50% align:center
[SOFIA gasps]

00:15:08.324 --> 00:15:09.993 position:50% align:center
If you'll excuse me.

00:15:13.788 --> 00:15:14.956 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
It had to be said.

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:16.207 position:50% align:center
The adults in this house
shouldn't meddle

00:15:16.291 --> 00:15:19.044 position:50% align:center
with Katarina's happiness!

00:15:19.127 --> 00:15:22.213 position:50% align:center
After all, there isn't anyone
here who's thinking about her,

00:15:22.297 --> 00:15:25.884 position:50% align:center
or is even remotely concerned
about what she wants!

00:15:25.967 --> 00:15:27.510 position:50% align:center
We're leaving!

00:15:27.594 --> 00:15:30.013 position:50% align:center
--Wha--?
--Let's go see Gimo!

00:15:30.096 --> 00:15:32.766 position:50% align:center
What? I went over this with you.

00:15:32.849 --> 00:15:35.435 position:50% align:center
There's nothing I can do
to change the situation.

00:15:35.518 --> 00:15:36.936 position:50% align:center
End of story.

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:38.396 position:50% align:center
No, it's not.

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.857 position:50% align:center
If you always hate the life
you're living

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:43.902 position:50% align:center
and being yourself in
front of your own parents,

00:15:43.985 --> 00:15:46.571 position:50% align:center
you'll never be able to
start your future!

00:15:46.654 --> 00:15:48.615 position:50% align:center
You'll constantly
question who you are

00:15:48.698 --> 00:15:50.492 position:50% align:center
and never be able
to move forward!

00:15:50.575 --> 00:15:53.328 position:50% align:center
Time to decide what you want
and what you're going to do,

00:15:53.411 --> 00:15:55.038 position:50% align:center
because no one can for you.

00:15:55.121 --> 00:15:57.749 position:50% align:center
I had to do the same thing
and I'll never regret it!

00:15:57.832 --> 00:16:00.293 position:50% align:center
And I know that
you won't either!

00:16:00.377 --> 00:16:02.045 position:50% align:center
Because no matter
what you're faced with,

00:16:02.128 --> 00:16:04.506 position:50% align:center
you'll be able to carry on!

00:16:04.589 --> 00:16:06.925 position:50% align:center
But in order to do that, first
you need to meet Gimo

00:16:07.008 --> 00:16:08.718 position:50% align:center
face-to-face so you
can hear each other out

00:16:08.802 --> 00:16:10.804 position:50% align:center
and settle things in person!

00:16:18.353 --> 00:16:19.396 position:50% align:center
All right, then.

00:16:19.479 --> 00:16:21.231 position:50% align:center
Let's go find him.

00:16:30.365 --> 00:16:32.200 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
So this is Murano.

00:16:37.455 --> 00:16:40.458 position:50% align:center
Hey now, you don't have anything
to worry about Katarina.

00:16:40.542 --> 00:16:42.252 position:50% align:center
I'm not going anywhere!

00:16:42.335 --> 00:16:44.004 position:50% align:center
Yes. I know.

00:16:44.087 --> 00:16:45.964 position:50% align:center
All we need is someone who
can help point us toward

00:16:46.047 --> 00:16:48.633 position:50% align:center
where Gimo lives.
Where is it?

Ah. Arte!

worried about you right up

until the moment that she died.

00:17:43.897 --> 00:17:45.523 position:50% align:center
That's when I was told
that you and I needed

00:17:45.607 --> 00:17:47.650 position:50% align:center
to never talk again.

you're a noble and your real

how you're as dear to us
as any real family.

how she wasn't feeling well
