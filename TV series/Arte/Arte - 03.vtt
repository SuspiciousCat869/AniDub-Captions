Carnevale brings
a new energy to the city.

It's fine.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.222 position:50% align:center

Mi scusi--I apologize.

No need!

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.565 position:50% align:center
Wait. You're in the
middle of an errand, me!

00:01:05.648 --> 00:01:07.734 position:50% align:center
I can't afford to
get distracted now.

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:13.490 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] Events like Carnevale
really don't concern me.

00:01:13.573 --> 00:01:15.158 position:50% align:center
Not when there's
work to be done!

00:01:17.202 --> 00:01:18.328 position:50% align:center
[LEO]
Arte.

00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:20.705 position:50% align:center
You and I are going out
somewhere today.

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:21.956 position:50% align:center

Really?

00:01:26.503 --> 00:01:28.546 position:50% align:center

Uhh...

00:01:30.715 --> 00:01:33.468 position:50% align:center
Unless you'd rather
stay behind at the workshop?

00:01:33.551 --> 00:01:34.886 position:50% align:center
Oh, no, that's not it!

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:38.056 position:50% align:center
Just a little surprised
you had an outing planned!

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:39.641 position:50% align:center
I'll go and get ready!

00:03:13.818 --> 00:03:16.404 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] I can't believe Master
Leo is taking me somewhere!

00:03:16.488 --> 00:03:18.490 position:50% align:center
And during Carnevale
of all times!

00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:21.701 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Where could we be going?

00:03:21.785 --> 00:03:22.911 position:50% align:center
Maybe it's a party.

00:03:22.994 --> 00:03:24.579 position:50% align:center
Or even a banquet!

00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:30.001 position:50% align:center
But why do I need
to change my clothes?

00:03:35.548 --> 00:03:37.634 position:50% align:center
You're lucky I didn't
leave without you.

Let's go.

00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:49.396 position:50% align:center
Um, before we head outside.

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:51.398 position:50% align:center
Aren't these clothes
meant for a boy to wear?

00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:53.483 position:50% align:center
[LEO]
Yes, but don't worry about it.

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:55.735 position:50% align:center
No one will be able
to tell that you're not.

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:57.320 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:57.404 --> 00:03:58.863 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:03:58.947 --> 00:04:00.907 position:50% align:center
[LEO] Make sure you tuck
your hair under your cap.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.249 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] Now I'm very curious
where we're going.

00:04:09.332 --> 00:04:12.127 position:50% align:center
He hasn't even glanced
at the festivities.

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.504 position:50% align:center
On top of that,
what place won't let me in

00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:16.423 position:50% align:center
unless I'm dressed like a man?

00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:22.721 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
He walks so fast.

00:04:22.804 --> 00:04:24.389 position:50% align:center
I'll lose him at this rate!

00:04:28.727 --> 00:04:31.271 position:50% align:center
Forgive me, sir!

00:04:31.354 --> 00:04:32.689 position:50% align:center
Hold on, boy?

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.570 position:50% align:center
Oh no, where's Leo?

00:04:41.823 --> 00:04:44.242 position:50% align:center
There! Found him!

00:04:44.325 --> 00:04:45.493 position:50% align:center
Master Leo!

[laughs]

00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:56.755 position:50% align:center
Honestly.
Where did you hear such a thing?

00:04:56.838 --> 00:04:58.840 position:50% align:center
[VERONICA]
Ah? Oh, my.

00:04:58.923 --> 00:05:01.051 position:50% align:center
An acquaintance of
yours, I presume?

00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:02.510 position:50% align:center
[LEO]
Huh?

00:05:02.594 --> 00:05:04.763 position:50% align:center
[VERONICA]
What an adorable young man.

00:05:04.846 --> 00:05:06.097 position:50% align:center
This is my assistant.

00:05:06.181 --> 00:05:08.933 position:50% align:center
Started at my workshop
about half a year ago.

00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:11.519 position:50% align:center
No! You took an apprentice?

00:05:11.603 --> 00:05:13.605 position:50% align:center
And here I thought you were
just a heartless diavolo

00:05:13.688 --> 00:05:15.982 position:50% align:center
who would never
change for anything.

00:05:16.066 --> 00:05:17.859 position:50% align:center
Hopefully I've presented
you with enough evidence

00:05:17.942 --> 00:05:19.944 position:50% align:center
to the contrary, signora.

00:05:20.028 --> 00:05:22.238 position:50% align:center

Is that an actual smile?

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:24.407 position:50% align:center
So he is capable
of being friendly.

00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:26.743 position:50% align:center
He's never been that nice to me!

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:30.580 position:50% align:center
Huh? Keep scowling and your
face will get stuck that way.

00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:35.543 position:50% align:center
[VERONICA] I have no doubt
working under this man

00:05:35.627 --> 00:05:38.213 position:50% align:center
is often difficult, but promise
me you'll do your best.

00:05:38.296 --> 00:05:40.006 position:50% align:center
All right?

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.716 position:50% align:center
Until next time, Leo.

00:05:43.218 --> 00:05:45.595 position:50% align:center
Her perfume was so sweet.

00:05:48.515 --> 00:05:49.808 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Who was that woman?

00:05:49.891 --> 00:05:52.686 position:50% align:center
She just happens to be
a valuable patron of mine.

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:53.687 position:50% align:center
A patron.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.439 position:50% align:center
So, is she a noblewoman?

00:05:56.523 --> 00:05:57.899 position:50% align:center
[LEO]
Not exactly.

00:05:57.982 --> 00:05:59.984 position:50% align:center
She's a courtesan.

00:06:00.068 --> 00:06:02.362 position:50% align:center
I've never seen one before.

00:06:02.445 --> 00:06:04.072 position:50% align:center
Unsurprising.

it was even possible.

Are we allowed to
just walk through like this?

It's already started.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.777 position:50% align:center

Hey! I...

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:55.498 position:50% align:center
Could you stop
rushing off ahead of me?

00:06:55.582 --> 00:06:57.083 position:50% align:center
What's the hurry?

00:06:57.167 --> 00:06:58.793 position:50% align:center
[LEO]
I wanted us to get a good view.

00:06:58.877 --> 00:07:00.045 position:50% align:center

Hmm?

00:07:04.215 --> 00:07:06.551 position:50% align:center

[ARTE whimpers]

00:07:13.058 --> 00:07:15.226 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] At the time,
dissections were frowned upon by

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.063 position:50% align:center
the general public, but they
were considered acceptable

00:07:18.146 --> 00:07:20.023 position:50% align:center
during the season of Carnevale.

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:22.525 position:50% align:center
This provided opportunities
for those seeking to learn

00:07:22.609 --> 00:07:27.113 position:50% align:center
human anatomy, be they painters
or other curious parties.

00:07:27.197 --> 00:07:29.741 position:50% align:center

Now, get started.

You want me to sketch the body?

In order to paint
a body realistically,

00:07:33.661 --> 00:07:35.830 position:50% align:center
you must first know
its internal structure.

00:07:35.914 --> 00:07:38.291 position:50% align:center
It's very expensive
to pay for a cadaver.

00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:40.210 position:50% align:center
The risks would be
too great, especially for

00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:42.879 position:50% align:center
a small workshop like ours.

00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:45.298 position:50% align:center
That's why we needed
to seize this chance.

00:07:45.382 --> 00:07:46.966 position:50% align:center
So the clothes...

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:49.761 position:50% align:center
You had me dress this way

00:08:04.609 --> 00:08:06.111 position:50% align:center
can be a bit intense.

a sound, they'll find you.

00:09:48.213 --> 00:09:50.715 position:50% align:center
But he's so close!

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:55.053 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] Except for
paintings and sculptures,

00:09:55.136 --> 00:09:58.431 position:50% align:center
this is the first time I've
been this close to a man's face.

00:10:00.725 --> 00:10:02.560 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
His skin is so rough.

00:10:02.644 --> 00:10:04.813 position:50% align:center
And look at that bone structure.

00:10:04.896 --> 00:10:08.358 position:50% align:center
The facial hair
and Adam's apple.

00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:11.444 position:50% align:center
Men's bodies are built
entirely different from ours.

00:10:11.528 --> 00:10:13.988 position:50% align:center
It's like we're
two different species.

00:10:14.072 --> 00:10:16.324 position:50% align:center
I need to remember
this for reference!

00:10:18.702 --> 00:10:21.788 position:50% align:center
Well, it looks like
the coast is clear now.

00:10:21.871 --> 00:10:23.248 position:50% align:center
[ARTE gasps]

00:10:29.504 --> 00:10:31.756 position:50% align:center
We should hurry up
and head back to the workshop.

00:10:34.175 --> 00:10:37.053 position:50% align:center
What happened to you,
are you hurt?

00:10:37.137 --> 00:10:38.596 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
I can't explain it,

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.016 position:50% align:center
but my chest suddenly
started aching.

00:10:41.099 --> 00:10:44.227 position:50% align:center
[LEO]
Hmm? Do you need a doctor?

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:47.397 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
I'm not sure. Maybe I do.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.400 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] Whatever this feeling is,
it hurts a lot,

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:52.068 position:50% align:center
and I don't like it.

00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:07.792 position:50% align:center
Pesante!

00:11:33.318 --> 00:11:34.361 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:11:39.282 --> 00:11:42.243 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] The pain seems
to have gone away.

00:11:42.327 --> 00:11:45.413 position:50% align:center
I wonder what that was.

00:11:45.497 --> 00:11:46.956 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
I can't explain it,

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.376 position:50% align:center
but my chest suddenly
started aching.

00:11:49.459 --> 00:11:51.252 position:50% align:center
Do you need a doctor?

00:11:51.336 --> 00:11:54.047 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
I'm not sure. Maybe I do.

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:57.008 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] Whatever this feeling is,
it hurts a lot

00:11:57.092 --> 00:11:58.843 position:50% align:center
and I don't like it.

00:12:06.017 --> 00:12:07.477 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
It was so strange.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.146 position:50% align:center
[LEO] Ehi! It's dangerous
to fall asleep

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:11.856 position:50% align:center
in front of the fire.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:13.775 position:50% align:center
I won't! I'm, uh, sorry.

00:12:13.858 --> 00:12:16.236 position:50% align:center
Anyway, there's something
we need to discuss.

00:12:16.319 --> 00:12:17.320 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Huh?

00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:23.118 position:50% align:center
Hold on.
Could... you say that again?

00:12:23.201 --> 00:12:24.369 position:50% align:center
Was I not clear?

00:12:24.452 --> 00:12:26.955 position:50% align:center
We're going to work on
this project together.

00:12:27.038 --> 00:12:29.666 position:50% align:center
You'll be handling part
of the background.

00:12:29.749 --> 00:12:34.045 position:50% align:center
[whimpering]

00:12:34.129 --> 00:12:37.007 position:50% align:center
I'm being promoted!

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:38.508 position:50% align:center
But wait, are you sure?

00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:40.552 position:50% align:center
I've only been here
for six months.

00:12:40.635 --> 00:12:42.804 position:50% align:center
I thought that I'd have to
train for at least three years

00:12:42.887 --> 00:12:45.265 position:50% align:center
before assisting you with
one of your paintings!

00:12:45.348 --> 00:12:47.642 position:50% align:center
Typically, yes,
that's how it works.

00:12:47.726 --> 00:12:50.854 position:50% align:center
But you studied art and knew
the basics before coming here.

00:12:50.937 --> 00:12:52.480 position:50% align:center
You're not a beginner.

00:12:52.564 --> 00:12:54.399 position:50% align:center
Having you learn
the principles all over again

00:12:54.482 --> 00:12:56.192 position:50% align:center
would be a waste of time.

00:12:56.276 --> 00:12:59.154 position:50% align:center
Besides, you're a bit old
for an apprentice.

00:12:59.237 --> 00:13:01.072 position:50% align:center
Old?

00:13:03.658 --> 00:13:05.160 position:50% align:center
Well, I suppose that's fair,

00:13:05.243 --> 00:13:08.663 position:50% align:center
considering most
apprentices start at 13.

00:13:08.747 --> 00:13:09.706 position:50% align:center
[LEO]
Pay attention.

00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:11.166 position:50% align:center
Here's the portrait.

00:13:11.249 --> 00:13:13.793 position:50% align:center
The client's already chosen
the background they want.

00:13:13.877 --> 00:13:16.046 position:50% align:center
You're going to
start off with a sketch.

00:13:17.797 --> 00:13:19.049 position:50% align:center
Draw it on
a separate sheet of paper

00:13:19.132 --> 00:13:20.967 position:50% align:center
and bring it to me.

00:13:21.051 --> 00:13:22.218 position:50% align:center
[ARTE gasps]

00:13:23.011 --> 00:13:25.180 position:50% align:center
If you don't have any
questions, then get moving.

00:13:26.473 --> 00:13:27.557 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:13:33.063 --> 00:13:34.898 position:50% align:center
This is going to be
my first time drawing anything

00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:36.399 position:50% align:center
as a professional!

00:13:37.776 --> 00:13:39.402 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] The assignment is
to render a landscape

00:13:39.486 --> 00:13:41.404 position:50% align:center
featuring the Arno River.

00:13:46.117 --> 00:13:47.452 position:50% align:center
I'm so thrilled to be working,

00:13:47.535 --> 00:13:49.496 position:50% align:center
I can barely feel
the cold at all!

00:14:01.216 --> 00:14:02.717 position:50% align:center
And, finito!

00:14:02.801 --> 00:14:03.885 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:14:06.096 --> 00:14:07.847 position:50% align:center
This looks pretty good,
actually.

00:14:07.931 --> 00:14:11.768 position:50% align:center
Definitely made it worth
braving the chilly weather.

00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:13.228 position:50% align:center
And there's still
plenty of time before

00:14:13.311 --> 00:14:15.522 position:50% align:center
we're supposed to deliver
the finished portrait, too!

00:14:17.315 --> 00:14:19.943 position:50% align:center
All that's left for me to
do now is show Leo the sketch,

00:14:20.026 --> 00:14:22.320 position:50% align:center
get his approval, and then
paint the wood panel.

00:14:22.404 --> 00:14:23.988 position:50% align:center
At the rate that we're moving,
we're going to be done

00:14:24.072 --> 00:14:26.324 position:50% align:center
way before the delivery date!

00:14:26.408 --> 00:14:28.451 position:50% align:center
[squeals]
This is like a dream!

00:14:28.535 --> 00:14:31.454 position:50% align:center
I can't believe how perfectly
everything is going right now!

00:14:33.707 --> 00:14:34.833 position:50% align:center
[LEO]
Start over.

00:14:34.916 --> 00:14:36.126 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Huh?

00:14:36.209 --> 00:14:37.210 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:14:37.293 --> 00:14:39.379 position:50% align:center
Looks like you weren't
expecting that.

00:14:39.462 --> 00:14:42.007 position:50% align:center
Did you really think you'd
succeed on the first attempt?

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:45.552 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Mm! No! No, of course not!

00:14:45.635 --> 00:14:49.597 position:50% align:center
I'll do it again and
I'll get it right this time.

00:14:49.681 --> 00:14:51.349 position:50% align:center
I shouldn't be surprised.

00:14:51.433 --> 00:14:55.603 position:50% align:center
This is for a client, so there's
no way it'd be that easy.

00:14:55.687 --> 00:14:56.688 position:50% align:center
All right!

00:14:56.771 --> 00:14:58.231 position:50% align:center
Here we go!

00:15:04.404 --> 00:15:05.572 position:50% align:center
[LEO]
Again.

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:09.993 position:50% align:center
[LEO]
No.

00:15:11.244 --> 00:15:13.538 position:50% align:center
It's still wrong.
Go back and draw another.

00:15:24.674 --> 00:15:27.344 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] I can't get him
to approve any of them.

00:15:27.427 --> 00:15:29.179 position:50% align:center
What should I do?

00:15:29.262 --> 00:15:31.639 position:50% align:center
None of my sketches
are passable.

00:15:31.723 --> 00:15:34.100 position:50% align:center
I don't know how I should
draw this anymore.

00:15:38.772 --> 00:15:40.857 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] While I'm struggling
to finish my portion

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:43.818 position:50% align:center
and not making any progress,
he's almost completed

00:15:43.902 --> 00:15:45.820 position:50% align:center
the rest of the outline.

00:15:48.239 --> 00:15:51.242 position:50% align:center
If I can't pass this
stage, it'll never get done.

00:15:51.326 --> 00:15:54.454 position:50% align:center
And I don't think we have
that much time, either.

00:15:54.537 --> 00:15:56.039 position:50% align:center
Leo...

00:15:56.122 --> 00:15:58.333 position:50% align:center
He took a chance and promoted me
to journeyman, but here I am,

00:15:58.416 --> 00:16:00.877 position:50% align:center
getting in his way and
making him look bad.

00:16:04.297 --> 00:16:05.882 position:50% align:center
Then I'll work harder!

00:16:16.726 --> 00:16:18.228 position:50% align:center
[LEO]
We can't use this.

00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:19.688 position:50% align:center
[ARTE sighs]

00:16:27.112 --> 00:16:28.405 position:50% align:center
[LEO]
What is it?

00:16:28.488 --> 00:16:30.990 position:50% align:center
Nothing, just taking
in all the progress you've made.

00:16:31.074 --> 00:16:32.242 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:16:32.325 --> 00:16:34.160 position:50% align:center
If you're done,
get back to sketching.

00:16:34.244 --> 00:16:35.453 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Yes, sir.

00:16:41.376 --> 00:16:43.878 position:50% align:center
Master. I need help.

00:16:43.962 --> 00:16:45.046 position:50% align:center
I just...

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:47.215 position:50% align:center
I don't know what
I should do differently.

00:16:47.298 --> 00:16:49.175 position:50% align:center
And if I go on like this,
we won't be able to finish

00:16:49.259 --> 00:16:50.927 position:50% align:center
the painting in time.

00:16:51.011 --> 00:16:53.930 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid I'll end up
being a burden on you.

00:16:54.014 --> 00:16:57.600 position:50% align:center
[sighs]
Arte.

00:16:57.684 --> 00:17:00.812 position:50% align:center
What is the most important
part of this image?

00:17:00.895 --> 00:17:02.022 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:07.777 --> 00:17:10.447 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
The most important part is...

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:14.868 position:50% align:center
What sort of painting
did the client request?

00:17:24.794 --> 00:17:26.463 position:50% align:center
It must be... Of course!

00:17:26.546 --> 00:17:27.839 position:50% align:center
I'll be back soon!

00:17:38.516 --> 00:17:40.977 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] I wasn't concerned about
anything except the background

00:17:41.061 --> 00:17:43.063 position:50% align:center
I was supposed to draw.

00:17:46.566 --> 00:17:48.026 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
The client requested the woman

00:17:48.109 --> 00:17:49.986 position:50% align:center
painted in front of the river.

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:52.989 position:50% align:center
But I wanted to
show off my abilities.

00:17:53.073 --> 00:17:55.325 position:50% align:center
I put my own desires
above the person I'm supposed

00:17:55.408 --> 00:17:57.243 position:50% align:center
to be making the art for.

00:18:18.431 --> 00:18:20.308 position:50% align:center
Good. This works.

00:18:20.392 --> 00:18:21.726 position:50% align:center
Go ahead and start
painting it directly

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:23.687 position:50% align:center
onto the wood panel, then.

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:25.438 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:25.522 --> 00:18:28.108 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
I did it-- No!

00:18:28.191 --> 00:18:29.150 position:50% align:center
[LEO]
Hmm?

00:18:29.234 --> 00:18:30.402 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
It's too early to celebrate.

00:18:30.485 --> 00:18:33.321 position:50% align:center
Now the real work begins.

00:18:33.405 --> 00:18:35.532 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir! I'll do my best.

00:18:35.615 --> 00:18:37.200 position:50% align:center
Uh, right, then.

00:18:49.212 --> 00:18:52.173 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] Despite all my practice,
I still struggled.

00:18:52.257 --> 00:18:54.259 position:50% align:center
Somehow though, I was
able to finish painting

00:18:54.342 --> 00:18:56.136 position:50% align:center
by the delivery date.

00:18:58.972 --> 00:19:02.017 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] Completing my first
work filled me with joy.

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:04.936 position:50% align:center
Almost as much as seeing
the client's reaction.

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:06.604 position:50% align:center
[CLIENT 03A]
Mm-hmm!

00:19:06.688 --> 00:19:07.897 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:19:09.357 --> 00:19:10.734 position:50% align:center
Ah!

00:19:10.817 --> 00:19:11.735 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:19:11.818 --> 00:19:12.861 position:50% align:center
Ah?

00:19:14.904 --> 00:19:16.740 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:19:26.833 --> 00:19:27.751 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:19:27.834 --> 00:19:28.835 position:50% align:center
Ah.

00:19:31.796 --> 00:19:32.881 position:50% align:center
Leo!

00:19:36.634 --> 00:19:38.053 position:50% align:center
It's so dark.

00:19:38.136 --> 00:19:40.180 position:50% align:center
How late were you planning on
staying up and sketching?

00:19:40.263 --> 00:19:43.808 position:50% align:center
That's my last candle,
so not much longer.

00:19:43.892 --> 00:19:45.435 position:50% align:center
Did you need something, though?

00:19:45.518 --> 00:19:46.895 position:50% align:center
Now that the piece is finished,

00:19:46.978 --> 00:19:49.689 position:50% align:center
I thought we should take care
of some odds and ends.

00:19:49.773 --> 00:19:51.983 position:50% align:center
Like making a trip to
the notary, for example.

00:19:54.444 --> 00:19:56.863 position:50% align:center
This document is your
new journeyman contract.

00:19:56.946 --> 00:19:58.615 position:50% align:center
Make sure you read over it.

00:19:58.698 --> 00:19:59.824 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Ah...

00:20:01.534 --> 00:20:03.161 position:50% align:center
One of the changes
is a slight increase

00:20:03.244 --> 00:20:04.621 position:50% align:center
to your annual pay.

00:20:04.704 --> 00:20:07.916 position:50% align:center
[ARTE gasps, giggles]

00:20:07.999 --> 00:20:09.084 position:50% align:center
Then I'm going to
buy more candles

00:20:09.167 --> 00:20:11.252 position:50% align:center
with the extra money!

00:20:11.336 --> 00:20:12.796 position:50% align:center
Which means I can
spend more of my off time

00:20:12.879 --> 00:20:15.382 position:50% align:center
practicing my sketching skills!

00:20:15.465 --> 00:20:17.217 position:50% align:center
[LEO]
Yes, that's all fine and good,

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:20.595 position:50% align:center
but be careful--the last thing
we need is a fire breaking out.

00:20:20.679 --> 00:20:22.389 position:50% align:center
And, well...

00:20:22.472 --> 00:20:23.807 position:50% align:center
[ARTE gasps]

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:29.437 position:50% align:center
[LEO sighs] Earlier, you were
saying how you were worried

00:20:29.521 --> 00:20:31.606 position:50% align:center
I'd regret hiring you, right?

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:33.441 position:50% align:center
Ah!

00:20:33.525 --> 00:20:35.860 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
He doesn't mince words.

00:20:35.944 --> 00:20:38.029 position:50% align:center
[LEO] Hopefully you
realize that's nonsense.

00:20:38.113 --> 00:20:39.989 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:40.073 --> 00:20:42.659 position:50% align:center
Listen, you're
hopelessly optimistic,

00:20:42.742 --> 00:20:44.160 position:50% align:center
and divorced from reality.

00:20:44.244 --> 00:20:45.328 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Guh!

00:20:45.412 --> 00:20:46.621 position:50% align:center
And you're entirely
too honest, as well.

00:20:46.705 --> 00:20:47.664 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Ah!

00:20:47.747 --> 00:20:48.957 position:50% align:center
Those things
are all that you have.

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:51.167 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Aw...

00:20:51.251 --> 00:20:52.627 position:50% align:center
What's the matter?

00:20:52.711 --> 00:20:55.630 position:50% align:center
You know, words have
the power to hurt, Master.

00:20:56.715 --> 00:20:58.425 position:50% align:center
Then again, you're not wrong.

00:20:58.508 --> 00:21:00.802 position:50% align:center
I should learn
to embrace those traits.

00:21:00.885 --> 00:21:04.347 position:50% align:center
Even if you could've
said it a much nicer way.

00:21:04.431 --> 00:21:06.683 position:50% align:center
My mother reprimanded
me for being too fixated

00:21:06.766 --> 00:21:10.478 position:50% align:center
on drawing, and often told me
I wasn't spending enough time

00:21:10.562 --> 00:21:13.523 position:50% align:center
polishing my feminine appeal.

00:21:13.606 --> 00:21:17.318 position:50% align:center
[LEO] Hmm? Is that so?
Can't say I agree with her.

00:21:18.236 --> 00:21:19.320 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Huh?

00:21:19.404 --> 00:21:21.573 position:50% align:center
The way I see it,
the version of you

00:21:21.656 --> 00:21:26.036 position:50% align:center
that society wants isn't as
charming as the real thing.

00:21:26.119 --> 00:21:27.787 position:50% align:center
But that's just my opinion.

00:21:27.871 --> 00:21:29.414 position:50% align:center
If you want to consider it.

00:21:31.958 --> 00:21:33.168 position:50% align:center
[ARTE gasps]

00:21:34.419 --> 00:21:35.879 position:50% align:center
[LEO]
See you tomorrow.

00:21:35.962 --> 00:21:37.213 position:50% align:center
Don't stay up too late.

00:21:45.263 --> 00:21:46.639 position:50% align:center
[ARTE'S FATHER]
As long as she stands strong,

00:21:46.723 --> 00:21:48.641 position:50% align:center
and continues
believing in herself,

00:21:48.725 --> 00:21:49.976 position:50% align:center
she'll find someone.

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:52.937 position:50% align:center
A man who loves her for
her passion and her charm.

00:22:03.615 --> 00:22:04.783 position:50% align:center
That feeling...

00:22:04.866 --> 00:22:06.785 position:50% align:center
It's back.

00:22:06.868 --> 00:22:09.371 position:50% align:center
Why is my face warm?

00:22:09.454 --> 00:22:11.122 position:50% align:center
My chest...

00:22:13.625 --> 00:22:18.129 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I must be coming
down with something.

00:23:56.770 --> 00:24:00.231 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] I wonder why Leo smiles
whenever he's around Veronica.

00:24:00.315 --> 00:24:02.567 position:50% align:center
[VERONICA]
What a cute boy! Do your best.

00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:05.612 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] I'm not a boy,
but I will do my best!

00:24:05.695 --> 00:24:07.322 position:50% align:center
Next time:
"Courtesan."

00:24:07.405 --> 00:24:09.366 position:50% align:center
There's so many
different ways to live!
