00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:40,833
[ALEXIS] Wow. How wonderful!
Are you going to the pool?

2
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:44,750
[AKANE] It's for a field trip.

3
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:48,666
[ALEXIS] Oh?

4
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,666
[AKANE] We're traveling to the
mountains,

5
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,416
[ALEXIS] Well, that sounds fun.

6
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,833
[AKANE] I wonder.

7
00:01:58,916 --> 00:02:01,625
[ALEXIS] This wouldn't have
happened if you

8

that?

[ALEXIS] Is that so?

10
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:10,875
[ALEXIS] By the way, what's this
kaiju?

11
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:13,625
[AKANE] Well, there's an
experiment I want

12
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:18,541
[ALEXIS] I knew you were
enjoying this.

[YUTA] It's not here.

14
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:29,750
[YUTA] Found it!

15

[YUTA] Yeah.

22
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,541
[YUTA] Whoa.

23
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:01,166
[YUTA] I had no idea the river
was this

24
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:05,416
[UTSUMI] It is pretty large.

25
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,666
[YUTA] Guess you're right.

26
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,541
[UTSUMI] Though, they pretty
much become

[YUTA] Wait.

28

[UTSUMI] I almost forgot, your
amnesia and

29

[YUTA] So tired.

00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:38,166
[YUTA] Shoot!

32
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:38,541
[ANNOUNCER] The doors are
closing.

[UTSUMI]

34
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:49,875
[UTSUMI] That was one heck of a
close call.

35
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,208
[YUTA] We must have really been
knocked

[YUTA]

[NAMIKO] You're kidding.

45
00:03:58,375 --> 00:03:59,333
[HASS] Fasting is the key.

much.

[RIKKA] Sure.

[RIKKA] Your skin's so pretty.

00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:06,333
[AKANE] That's because I stay
out of the sun.

to it than that.

00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:48,041
[YUTA] Things you must do?

167
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:53,916
[AKANE] That's right.

168
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,291
[AKANE]

169
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,041
[YUTA]

170
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,833
[AKANE] So how's your memory?

171
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,416
[YUTA] Nope, not yet.

172
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,375
[AKANE] Not at all?

173
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:02,416
[YUTA] No.

174
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,541
[AKANE] That's gotta be hard on
you.

175
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:07,041
[YUTA] Yeah, but it's not
terrible.

176
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:08,916
[AKANE] I hope you remember
soon.

177
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
[YUTA] Same.

178
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:11,250
[AKANE] But you're transforming,
aren't

179
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:14,750
[YUTA] Yeah.

180
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:19,875
[AKANE] See ya!

181
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,166
[YUTA]

182
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:28,708
[AKANE] I knew I was right about
him!

183
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:31,583
[AKANE] Ah.

184
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:33,333
[AKANE] Please!

185
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:38,958
[ALEXIS] Very well!

186
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:42,208
[YUTA] It's ringing?

187
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:49,000
[UTSUMI] What's going on?

188
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,666
[STUDENTS]

189
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,750
[GUIDE B] Everyone, get away
from the river!

190
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,875
[HASS] The entire landscape is
moving!

191
00:08:55,958 --> 00:09:08,875
[NAMIKO] No, it's a kaiju!

192
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:11,000
[RIKKA] There any chance that's
not a kaiju?

193
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,125
[YUTA] It's as big as a
mountain.

194
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:21,750
[UTSUMI] No.

195
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:24,208
[STUDENTS]

196
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:31,625
[UTSUMI] Hold up.

197
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:32,958
[AKANE] Right!

198
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:37,041
[ALEXIS] To think of
overwhelming him with

199
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:42,000
[AKANE] I know it's sorta cheap
to scale up,

200
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:45,625
[AKANE] Your move, Gridman.

201
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:55,666
[KAIJU A]

202
00:09:55,750 --> 00:10:05,666
[KAIJU A]

203
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:15,708
[KAIJU A]

204
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:25,708
[KAIJU A]

00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:35,708

00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:20,208
[KAIJU A]

210
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:22,500
[BORR]

211
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:25,000
[CALIBUR] I think we have too
much time on

212
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:26,208
[BORR]

213
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:33,500
[RIKKA'S MOM] Do any of you
actually have

214
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,541
[RIKKA'S MOM] Hey, I asked if
you're

215
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:38,291
[VIT] Well, you see we work, and
then we

216
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:44,750
[RIKKA'S MOM] What?

217
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:46,291
[MAX] Gone with who to where?

218
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:49,125
[RIKKA'S MOM] Rikka and the boys
went on a

219
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,250
[MAX] A field trip, you say?

220
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:54,208
[UTSUMI] Shoot, what now?

221
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:57,750
[YUTA] But without Junk here,
there's no way

222
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:00,458
[RIKKA] And going back to the
shop is out of

223
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:02,458
[UTSUMI] Then our only option is
to call

224
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:05,208
[YUTA] Yeah, you're right!

225
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,708
[RIKKA] Well, what're we waiting
f-?

226
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:09,208
[YUTA] We don't have our cell
phones.

227
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:11,458
[UTSUMI] They're inside our
lockers!

228
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:14,208
[YUTA] Then we've got to go back
and get

229
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:16,625
[RIKKA] But it's that way,
right?

230
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:20,625
[UTSUMI] Unless someone has a
better idea.

231
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,416
[TEACHER] Kids, quick!

232
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,500
[STUDENTS] Ex.

233
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:28,625
[YUTA] I have to go!

234
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:31,750
[UTSUMI] I'm coming too!

235
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:35,166
[YUTA] Rikka, leave with the
others!

236
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:35,875
[UTSUMI]

237
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,750
[NAMIKO] Come on, Rikka!

238
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,333
[HASS] What the hell is she
doing just

239
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,833
[UTSUMI] Go this way!

240
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:45,500
[YUTA] Right!

241
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:46,041
[HASS] Rikka!

242
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:51,208
[NAMIKO] Rikka!

243
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:51,750
[KAIJU A]

244
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:52,958
[YUTA] Shinjo?

245
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:57,250
[UTSUMI] Yeah, I didn't see her
back there!

246
00:12:57,333 --> 00:13:01,166
[UTSUMI] It's not what you
think!

247
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,250
[YUTA]

248
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:05,166
[AKANE] But you're transforming,
aren't

249
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:09,916
[AKANE] He's so slow.

250
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,375
[YUTA]

251
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:10,916
[KAIJU A]

252
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,541
[UTSUMI] Shit!

253
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:16,541
[YUTA] They said it was supposed
to be a five

254
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:19,958
[UTSUMI] Five kilometers?

255
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:21,041
[YUTA] There!

256
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:24,416
[UTSUMI] A telephone!

257
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,541
[YUTA] Wait.

258
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:31,166
[UTSUMI] Leave it to me!

259
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,000
[YUTA] Yeah!

260
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,541
[UTSUMI] Now, make the call!

261
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:36,416
[YUTA] Uh.

262
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,041
[UTSUMI] No.

263
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,916
[RIKKA] Hey!

264
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,291
[UTSUMI]

265
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:40,666
[YUTA]

266
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,583
[RIKKA]

267
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:42,125
[YUTA] Rikka!

268
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:43,208
[UTSUMI] Rikka!

269
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:49,791
[RIKKA] If it's our shop's phone
number.

270
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,458
[RIKKA] Um, hello, mama?

271
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:55,625
[MAX] I understand.

272
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,750
[MAX] I'd like to make a
purchase.

273
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,250
[MAX] How much for this unit?

274
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:03,250
[RIKKA'S MOM] Like to buy?

275
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,750
[RIKKA'S MOM] It's thirty-seven
thousand

276
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:06,375
[VIT] So pricey!

277
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:07,166
[BORR] So pricey!

278
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,416
[MAX] Empty your pockets!

279
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,375
[RIKKA'S MOM] Whoa!

280
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:14,208
[MAX] We won't be needing a
receipt.

281
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,625
[RIKKA] Great news!

282
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:17,875
[YUTA] Awesome, thanks!

283
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,791
[UTSUMI] Quick!

00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:23,916
[YUTA]

285
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,333
[AKANE] It should've been long
enough since

286
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:36,500
[AKANE] So why is Gridman taking
his sweet

287
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:40,250
[AKANE] What the heck?

288
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:44,125
[AKANE] Well, this totally
sucks.

289
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:47,750
[AKANE]

290
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:53,875
[AKANE] What are you doing here?

291
00:14:53,958 --> 00:15:00,000
[ANTI] Get on.

292
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,458

[UTSUMI]

295
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:08,916
[UTSUMI] You can't be serious.

296
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,625
[UTSUMI] Of course this happens
when we're

297
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:15,500
[YUTA] Ugh.

298
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:16,750
[UTSUMI] Yeah, but.

[RIKKA]

00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:27,041
[RIKKA] Hibiki.

302
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:28,416
[YUTA] Leave you?

303
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:34,583
[RIKKA] Seems like I'm the one
holding you

304
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,458
[YUTA]

305
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:39,416
[RIKKA] Go ahead.

306
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,791
[YUTA] Alright then.

307
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:42,875
[UTSUMI]

308
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,166
[YUTA] I'll see you when you get
there!

309
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,875
[UTSUMI] Right!

310
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:51,583
[YUTA]

00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:55,125
[KAIJU A]

312
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:58,250
[YUTA] I've gotta keep moving.

313
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:02,750
[YUTA]

314
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:05,125
[MAX] Wake up!

315
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:05,500
[CALIBUR]

00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:06,500
[VIT]

317
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,125
[BORR] What are you sleeping
for?

318
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,833
[VIT] You were the one sleeping,
not me.

319
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:11,541
[BORR] Yes, you were!

320
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:12,708
[CALIBUR] I slept well.

321
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:13,541
[ANNOUNCER] The train is about
to depart.

322
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:17,958
[MAX] Unload Junk, quickly!

323
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:20,583
[MAX] We were this close to
missing our

[CALIBUR]

325
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:24,666
[RIKKA]

326
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,708
[UTSUMI] I wonder if Yuta
reached the station

327

[CALIBUR] Let's connect Junk.

338
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,875
[VIT] Is this the only solution?

339
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:04,166
[BORR] You've gotta do what
you've gotta

340
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,375
[GRIDMAN] Where is this?

341
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:08,375
[YUTA] I'll explain later!

size

346
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:22,416
[GRIDMAN] Even at my largest
output, my

347
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:28,250
[GRIDMAN] Plus, the larger I am,
the more

348
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:31,083
[YUTA] So what do we do?

349
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:31,541

[UTSUMI] Look, Gridman made it!

358
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:58,250
[RIKKA] Then that means Hibiki's

[BORR]
