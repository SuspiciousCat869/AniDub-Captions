[sighs] Ugh. Man,
I'm stiff as a board.

167
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:16,250
Uh! You scared
the hell outta me!

168
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:17,291
What're you doing?

169
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,416
You weren't here
all night, were you?

170
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,750
[RIKKA]
Yeah.

171
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,500
[RIKKA'S MOM] Look, sleep
in your room, wouldja?

172
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:26,000
I mean, I know the shop's
closed today, but still.

173
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:31,875
Want breakfast?
It's ready if you do.

174
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:32,750
[RIKKA]
'Kay.

175
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,333
What about school?

176
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,750
[RIKKA]
Yeah. I'll go.

177
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,208
[AKANE]
Aren't you excited?

178
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:43,000
A special treat for Anti's
good work. Go nuts!

179
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:45,041
[ANTI chewing]

180
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:47,041
[AKANE] Yesterday,
this boy named Utsumi

181
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,583
in my class was saying

182
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,750
he thought the true form of
kaiju might actually be humans.

183
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:54,625
Man, that couldn't be
further from the truth.

184
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:58,083
Too bad he doesn't know kaiju
don't have a true form.

185
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:01,000
Kaiju are simply kaiju.

186
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,791
Am I a kaiju, too, then?

187
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,416
Yep, you sure are.

188
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,750
You're a kaiju that even
eats breakfast with me!

189
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,416
Hey, do you think...

190
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,541
[UTSUMI]
Hm?

191
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:29,250
I've gotta check something!

192
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,583
Hey, wait up!

193
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:36,333
[UTSUMI]
This is Yuta's place.

194
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:37,916
[RIKKA]
Yeah.

195
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,041
[UTSUMI]
I'll push it.

196
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:42,833
[RIKKA]
Wait! Forget it. Let's go.

197
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:45,000
Huh? Then what did
we come here for?

198
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,916
To check for him, right?

199
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,708
[RIKKA]
Yeah, to check.

200
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:51,583
But what if... Hibiki...

201
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:55,458
...has actually been
dead for a long time?

202
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:59,125
Just like Tonkawa and Toiko.

203
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:02,000
I can't bring myself
to ask anyone,

204
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:04,791
'cause I mean,
what if they forgot him?

205
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:06,541
Like the others?

206
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,666
[RIKKA]
I'm too scared. I can't!

207
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,833
[footsteps]

208
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:21,166
[AKANE] Yay! Gridman is dead
and I'm on top of the world!

209
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,125
It's all thanks to you, Alexis!

210
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:26,666
[ALEXIS] No, no, no.
You owe it only to yourself.

211
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:30,041
You created a marvelous
auto intelligence kaiju!

212
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,708
That's why you won.

213
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,708
[AKANE, ALEXIS laugh]

214
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,375
[RIKKA]
Why won't Junk turn on?

215
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:44,458
How the hell am I
supposed to know that?

216
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,958
I've always sucked
with computers.

217
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,666
[RIKKA] If Calibur were here,
I bet he could fix it.

218
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,791
Well he's not,
so just deal with it.

219
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,875
[RIKKA]
I was just saying, so chill.

220
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,791
And don't tell me
to "deal with it."

221
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:00,541
Yeah, right. Gimme a break.

222
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:03,416
Yesterday, when
Gridman was losing,

223
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,791
you evaded my
question about why.

224
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,041
I think it's time
you explained--

225
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:08,958
No, I wasn't evading anything.

226
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:12,666
Besides, if I explained,
you wouldn't get it, anyway.

227
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,625
See? I knew that's
what you were doing.

228
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:15,833
I'm not an idiot.

229
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:18,583
When the hell did I say
anything like that?!

230
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:23,708
Uh! This is such
bullshit. Forget it.

231
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:27,291
The Gridman Alliance...
is disbanded.

232
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:31,583
[RIKKA]
You can't...

233
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:34,208
You can't disband it now.

234
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,458
[RIKKA] If you do that,
Hibiki won't have any place

235
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,583
to come back to.

236
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:43,833
I thought he'd be
coming back like normal.

237
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,333
And once he did,

238
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:49,500
I was gonna apologize for not
answering his call before.

239
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:52,125
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

240
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:55,125
This shop's everything
you'd expect it to be.

241
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:56,125
You're kidding!

242
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:58,041
There's a whole café
in the back?

243
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:01,666
There is, but the shop
isn't open today, so...

244
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,125
[MAX]
That poses a problem.

245
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:07,625
[MAX] If the shop's closed
to us, then I'm afraid

246
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,916
we won't be able
to support Gridman.

247
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,250
Huh?

248
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,666
You know Gridman?

249
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,666
[BORR] Let's see,
what'm I feelin' today.

250
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,708
Uh! Figures, of course it's
all stuff I don't like.

251
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,750
[MAX]
I think I'll have a latte.

252
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:24,208
Excuse me?!
Two lattes, please.

253
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,083
Oh, sorry, one for me, too.

254
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,916
[BORR]
Make that three lattes!

255
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,500
[VIT] Um, can one of those
be a toast combo?

256
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:31,625
[BORR]
There's a combo?

257
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:33,291
Make that two combos!

258
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,875
Oh, they're only
served after two p.m.

259
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,166
[VIT]
No way.

260
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,000
Where the heck is Calibur?

261
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:40,750
Aren't we s'posed to meet here?

262
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,291
Uh. I'm sorry,

263
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:45,708
but I think... he died
together with Gridman.

264
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:49,500
Hey, brat, where did you come
from and who invited you here?

265
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:53,208
Fret not, Calibur isn't dead,
and neither is Gridman.

266
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:54,416
[BOTH gasp]

267
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,916
So, that means Hibiki
must be alive, too!

268
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,166
Who in the world is that?

269
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,666
Beats me.

270
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,333
Well, he's... He's my friend!

271
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:04,875
Well, if that's the case,

272
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:07,041
then, why haven't you
asked him yourself?

273
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,666
Ask him myself? How would I?

274
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:12,041
Tell me this: do you
normally ask strangers

275
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,541
how your friends are doing?

276
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:16,750
Don't you have a number
of ways to contact him?

277
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:19,541
[UTSUMI]
I don't get what you're saying.

278
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:21,833
Oh. There are.

279
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:23,416
I'm gonna call him!

280
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,666
C'mon, stop that,

281
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,250

be what he means!

--[YUTA] Hello?
--[gasps] He picked up!

[RIKKA] Mm-hm. Listen, where
are you right now, Hibiki?

285
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,500
[YUTA]
Where? Um. I don't really know.

286
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,666
Yuta! Are you okay?!

287
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,541
[YUTA]
Utsumi?

00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:41,791
Yeah, it's me, bud!

Damn, that hurt!

291
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:47,000
Hand that here.

292
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:49,250
Talk to me, Calibur. Hey.

293
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:50,916
[CALIBUR]
B-Borr?

294
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
There you are.
Get back here, right now!

295
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,625
[CALIBUR]
No, not yet.

296
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:56,875
Why not?

297
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,708
[CALIBUR] G-Gridman's
restored and on standby.

298
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:03,125
If that kaiju appears again,
we'll ambush and defeat it.

299
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:07,041
B-But we've been waiting,
and it hasn't shown.

300
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:09,583
[BORR] Huh, that's weird.
Well, whatever.

301
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:12,541
Just get back here already, now.

302
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:15,625

Gridman.

00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,666
We're all gathered now.

00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:24,583
You can still fight, can't you?

306
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,458
[GRIDMAN]
Of course.

Hm?

[ALEXIS] It seems our guest
was alive all along.

No way! Gridman's still alive?!

why not just enjoy it?
