[AKANE] This city's so
jam-packed with useless things.

158
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:26,916
[YUTA]
Really?

159
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,833
[AKANE]
Really.

160
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:33,083
[YUTA] So you use kaiju to
destroy the useless things.

161
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:36,166
The things you don't like,
and then rebuild.

162
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,166
You're really the
one doing that?

163
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,291
Oh, so you know about
the repairs, too!

164

Gridman's on the ball.

165
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,416
How are you making the kaiju?

166
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,541
Is it actually true that they're
somehow born from your heart?

167
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,750
Wouldn't you like to know!

Could you come meet us?

There's somebody I want
to introduce you to.

What's up, guys?

[HASS] Tomorrow we hand in
our literature notes, right?

180
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:35,666
Yeah, that's right. I'm guessing
you want to copy mine?

181
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,375
[HASS] Oh! Spot on, Rikka!
You're the best!

[AKANE]
I wonder what I should get.

Um, excuse me!

189
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:05,666
I want to order pork belly fried
rice, plus shrimp in chili,

six of those black sesame

Oh! And do you have
any tomato juice?

Well, well. How interesting...

195
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,666
[AKANE]
It's okay. You can dig in.

196
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,875
Alright. If you say so.

197
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:32,500
[YUTA] This isn't going to be
poisoned or anything, is it?

198
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:35,166
[AKANE] Yup. It's exactly
as you're thinking.

The girl that lived here.
I ordered my kaiju to erase her.

201
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,666
And poof, no more.

202
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,791
But why? What did she ever
do to you that was so bad tha--

it with the volleyball.

[YUTA]
That's not...

That was your reason?

Yep.

there are other people
who suffer as well.

Apologies. I didn't
mean to show up late.

I've heard so much
about you from Akane.

It's an alien.

Who is this person?

Oh, thank you.

238
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:12,000
[AKANE] So why were you late?
I called a while back.

239
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,416
[ALEXIS] Apologies, but
something came up last minute,

240
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,333

make one today.

316
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:50,000
[YUTA]
There!

317
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,875
[GRIDMAN]
This must be the main body!

318
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,916
[KAIJU sneers]

319
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,875
I've been waiting
for you, Gridman!

320
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,291
Since when can that one fly?

321
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:04,041
Damn! He's ripping
off our moves again!

322
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:09,416
[ANTI]
Eat this, Gridman!

323
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:22,208
[YUTA gasps]
Wait. What in the world?

324
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:25,500
[ANOSILLUS] I told you, outside
the city there's nothing.

325
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:28,125
A city? Up in the sky?

326
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,750
What's going on?

327
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:33,083
[MAX] Hm. The information
Yuta heard from that girl

328
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,750
may very well be
true after all.

329
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:38,375
So then... Akane really is...

330
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:41,166
How is any of this
stuff possible?

331
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:45,000
I mean, if there really
is some kind of alien...

332

[ANTI]
You're all mine!

335
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,166
[VIT]
Sure about that?

336
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,375

[GRIDMAN]
Gridknight Saber... Slash!

339
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:14,541
[VIT] Not so fast!
Amp Laser Circus!

340

[grunts]

343
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:46,041
[ALEXIS] It would appear
Anti was no good after all.

344
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:49,000
There's only one able
to make true kaiju.

345
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:52,458
And it's the one who's
truly a human, you.

346
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:56,750
Yeah... Something only I can do.

347
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:59,291
[ALEXIS]
As for that pathetic Anti.

348
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,625
Allow me to discipline him.

349
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:05,500
[AKANE] Please. And don't
let anyone in this room.

350
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:08,083
You met an alien life form?!

351
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,458
And Akane was there too?

352
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:11,666
[YUTA]
That's right.

353
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,833
No way, you mean that
she's with an alien?

354
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:17,875
Don't forget the city in the sky
hanging over us like a ceiling.

355
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:20,000
How's all this tie together?

356
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:23,750
So we're dealing with a god,
aliens, and a floating city.

357
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:26,791
This is, like, way too
for me much to handle.

358
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:29,250
[GRIDMAN] Then the source of
the approaching danger,

359
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:33,750
may be Akane Shinjo
and this Alexis Kerib.

360
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,750
[YUTA] If Kaiju are born
from Shinjo's heart,

361
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:39,875
then fighting isn't
my only mission.

362
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:44,916
For us and Gridman, there is
even more that we must do.

363
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,208
[ALEXIS]
Anti, a moment of your time?

364
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:59,625
You did so well out there today,
I have a reward for you.
