Good morning. If it is.

No, something else I think.

Where are we, anyway?

If he's suffering memory loss,

73
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:14,250
it could mean he hit
his head on something.

good.

remember anything

Nope.

But, if you are just
pretending to have amnesia,

94
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:09,916
then you really suck.

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,916
Uh. Did something happen?

96
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,708
So how did it go?

97
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:23,708
A lot of it went over my head,
but they said I'd be back

98
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,958
to normal before long.

99
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,500

100
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:30,208
Oh, hey, do you even
have an insurance card?

101
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:32,083
Insurance?

102
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:36,291
[RIKKA sighs]
You can go home, right?

103
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:38,500

taking care of me.

See you.

What's wrong?

108
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:51,958
I don't exactly
know where to go.

109
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:55,250
[RIKKA gasps] You forgot
your home address too?

110
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,166
Well, I don't have a clue
where you live either.

111

[gasps] Wait, hand me
your cell phone.

112
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:00,833
[YUTA]
Oh, right.

113
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,000
[RIKKA]
I'll text Utsumi.

114
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:05,333
He could probably
be able to help out.

115
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:08,875
Ah, okay. Yeah. I know
where this is. Got it.

116
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,625
But it's pretty far from here.

117
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,000
You don't say.

118
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,333
On top of that,
it's already seven!

120
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:18,125
[RIKKA]
And I am starving.

121
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:27,375
Why was I sleeping at
some girl's house anyway?

122
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:30,166
I'm not just some girl.
The name's Rikka Takarada.

00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,708
[YUTA]
Hm?

124
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,875
And, Hibiki, we found you lying
unconscious in front of our

125
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:37,000
place and nothing we
did could wake you.

126
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:41,041
What do you mean?
Uh, do we have a history?

127
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:42,833
Are we friends?

128
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:47,208
[sighs]
Got a newsflash.

129
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:49,416
Today is the most we've
ever spoken to each other

130
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,166
since we were put into
the same classroom.

131
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,791
Oh, I see.

132
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,375
That hit the spot.

133
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,291
[YUTA]
Uh?

134
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:01,291
Whoa... What's up with him?

135
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,708
Should I leave you here?

136
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,916
Huh? No, I'm ready to go.

137
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,541
[YUTA]
This is the address.

138
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,666
[RIKKA]
Awesome. I'll be off then.

139
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,750
Utsumi said he'd come by and
pick you up tomorrow morning.

140
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:21,041
[YUTA]
Great. Thanks for everything.

141
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,041
[RIKKA]
Bye.

142
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:28,166
[YUTA]
I'm home.

143
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,750
It's dark...

144
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,666
[YUTA]
After looking around the house,

145
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,750
I discovered my parents
were on a business trip.

146
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:45,291
They wouldn't return
home for three months.

147
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
[YUTA] It seemed unreal,
like someone else's life.

148
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:58,166
[YUTA]
Gridman. Does he exist?

149
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,958
[YUTAQ]
Or was it a hallucination?

150
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:08,875
[YUTA] You wouldn't happen
to be Utsumi, would you?

151
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,125
It looks like you
weren't kidding

152
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:12,333
about having memory loss.

153
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:15,375
You don't even remember
my face, do you?

154
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,041
I'm sorry, no.

155
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,458
[UTSUMI]
Whatever.

156
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:21,041
We only started getting to
know each other in April.

157
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,083
We'll pretend we've just
become friends again.

158
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:25,500
[YUTA]
Thanks. So um...

159
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:26,750
[UTSUMI]
What is it?

160
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:29,166
[YUTA] You know...
What kind of person am I?

161
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,166
[UTSUMI] That's a heavy question
to suddenly drop on me.

What kind of person
are you? Let's see...

163

I'd describe you as... regular.

Not a bad guy at all.

[YUTA] By the way, you wouldn't
happen to have heard of

166
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,291
something called Gridman?

167

[UTSUMI]
Nope. Is it a new trend?

was nice to me, huh?

way too unapproachable.

I'm not entirely sure.

[UTSUMI] We can't make
out anything from here.

317
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:53,416
Let's head to the main road.

00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,291

No way, it's too dangerous!

Yuta! Yuta!

00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,666

I'm here, Gridman!
You called out to me, right?

329
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:52,625
[GRIDMAN] Correct. The time has
come for you and I to awaken.

330
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,833
To awaken? What does that--?

00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:56,375
[GRIDMAN]
I'll explain later!

332
00:16:56,458 --> 00:17:00,000
What?! But it's
happening right now--

333

Yuta!

Whoa! What the...?

335
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:06,375
For the record, we both saw
Junk swallow Yuta whole, right?

336
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,791
Who knew that old computers
were so terrifying?

337
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,041
I see something on the screen.

00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:30,333
Whatever it is,
I'm seeing it too.

No way. A giant robot?

00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:50,041
Is that the Gridman
Yuta was talking about?

343
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,541
We can't make anything
out from this far away!

344
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:56,250
[YUTA] I know what I must do.
This Kaiju has to be stopped.

I think Yuta's voice
just came out of Junk.

He's transformed.

351

When he got sucked up,
Yuta became Gridman.

He's defending the city
against the kaiju!

cooler than I ever imagined!

Wait. You don't suppose
Junk is somehow

356
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,750
connected to Gridman, do you?

357
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:55,375
What if it's telling us
that he's in trouble?

[groans] If only this
was the Ultra series!

Isn't there some

Maybe through the computer?
