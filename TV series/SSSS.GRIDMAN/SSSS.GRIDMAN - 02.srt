00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:24,125
We'll start by investigating
the five missing people.

159
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,375
[YUTA]
How?

160
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,708
[UTSUMI] I dug up their
addresses during lunch.

161
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,750
Using our school's
secret weapon:

162
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:32,583
The telephone directory!

163
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:33,875
Way to creep.

164
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:35,291
[UTSUMI gasps]

165
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:36,666
[CALIBUR]
L-Let's go.

166
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,583
[UTSUMI]
Whoa, hold on.

167
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,708
Hey! Mister Samurai, wait!

168
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:47,250
That guy's gotta
be dangerous, right?

169
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,541
[YUTA]
Is this the right way?

170
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,666
I'm pretty sure
that it is, but...

171
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,666
I wish he'd stay on the ground.

172
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:06,875
Look at that! Kaiju!

173
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:08,375
[RIKKA]
He's right!

174
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,333
[YUTA]
You both see them, too?

175
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:12,000
[UTSUMI]
Yeah.

176
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,375
That's crazy.

177
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:16,375
Have we've been living next
to them all this time?

178
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,916
[CALIBUR]
W-We're here.

179
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,916
Rikka, if you would?
Pretty please?

180
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,750
Please?

181
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:32,125
Uh! Why do I have to?

182
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:34,791
[TONKAWA'S DAD]
Welcome!

183
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,750
Um, sir, excuse me?

184
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,166
Yeah?

185
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:43,041
I'm, uh, looking for a friend
of mine. Sakiru Tonkawa.

186
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,625
I'm Rikka Takarada
from her high school.

187
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:49,583
From her high school?
What is this? What're you doing?

188
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:50,916
[RIKKA]
Huh?

189
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,916
We stopped by because she
wasn't in class today.

190
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,625
[TONKAWA'S DAD]
Of course she wasn't.

191
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:59,125
Our girl died when she
was in middle school.

192
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:00,791
In an accident.

193
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,791
[RIKKA, UTSUMI]
Middle school?

194
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:05,916
But, sir, she was
there just yesterday.

195
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,791
Now you listen.

196
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:12,208
I think we mighta
pushed his buttons.

197
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:13,541
[RIKKA]
What does this mean?

198
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,875
[YUTA] She couldn't have
died during middle school.

199
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,166
[CALIBUR]
L-Let's go.

200
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,541
Hold up. Mister Samurai!

201
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:24,958
[YUTA] After that, we went to
the other four's houses.

202
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:28,791
But it was the same
story with all of them.

203
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:40,500
[AKANE]
Yes! Yes! They're dead!

204
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,166
[AKANE, ALEXIS laugh]

205
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,291
[ALEXIS]
How wonderful.

206
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,458
[UTSUMI]
It's scorching.

207
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:53,208
Nothing for you?

208
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:55,791
I can't do carbonated drinks.

209
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:01,125
Y'know, shaking that
won't get it out.

210
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:05,041
[RIKKA] Why is it that the
five of them are dead now?

211
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,541
They were fine just yesterday.

212
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:12,291
They... They were all
attacked by kaiju, so...

213
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:16,750
[RIKKA] Does this mean we're
never going to see them again?

214
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:19,083
[UTSUMI] Even though all those
people told us they were dead,

215
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,833
it still doesn't feel like it.

216
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,958
Yeah.

217
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:25,250
[RIKKA]
How can you be so calm?

218
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:29,541
I dunno. Prob'ly cuz the whole
situation hasn't sunk in yet.

219
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:33,208
Besides, Rikka, were you even
friends with Tonkawa and them?

220
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:34,125
[sighs]

221
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:35,375
[RIKKA]
What does that matter?

222
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:37,833
That's not even what
I'm talking about.

223
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,416
[clang]

224
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,750
[footsteps]

225
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:13,000
[CALIBUR]
C-Can you drink this?

226
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,625
Thanks, that's really
nice of you.

227
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:20,833
[RIKKA] I just don't want any
more friends to disappear.

228
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:23,916
I don't want all of our good
memories to disappear.

229
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,916
And for me to be the only
one left who remembers.

230
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,208
I can't stand the
thought of that.

231
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:37,166
I doubt anyone could, which...
which is why we have to fight.

232
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:41,041
I know. If another kaiju
appears, I want him to fight.

233
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,708
Because only they can do it.

234
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:46,625
Only Hibiki and Gridman
can protect my friends.

235
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,250
Then I think you
should tell him that.

236
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:54,000
[RIKKA]
I can't.

237
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,833
[AKANE]
Look! My new creation!

238
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:59,625
[ALEXIS] Wow! It's magnificent!
What will you use it for?

239
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,208
[giggles]

240
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:04,375
Well, I was thinking of killing
my homeroom teacher with it.

241
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:05,916
[ALEXIS]
Oh?

242
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,125
[AKANE] Who runs into someone
and doesn't even apologize?

243
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:09,208
So rude.

244
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:10,833
[ALEXIS]
That's not nice at all.

245
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:14,083
I know! So, I'm counting on you.

246
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:18,166
[ALEXIS] But of course.
Instance Abreaction!

247
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:20,916

[sirens wailing]

249
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:26,166
[YUTA]
I knew it. Another kaiju.

250
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,875
[CALIBUR]
One's coming?

251
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,708
A kaiju...

252
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,833
[roars]

253
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,333
What the hell is that?

254
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,625
[gasps]

255
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:53,041
[AKANE]
Oh, there you are, sir!

256
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,750
Hey, where are you going?
School's still in session!

257
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:58,833
You ought to be with
the students, not out here!

258
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,708
That was totally wild!

259
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:08,166
Watch where you're
aiming, will you?

260
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,458
I've gotta go.

261
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,916
[UTSUMI] Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa! Hold on a sec!

262
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,458
This is dangerous!

263
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,958
[YUTA] But people are
going to die again.

264
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:25,791
I've gotta go
fight with Gridman.

265
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:28,750
[UTSUMI] This is just way
out of character for you.

266
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:30,458
[YUTA]
It might be, but...

267
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:34,875
Utsumi. we're the
Gridman Alliance, right?

268
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:38,166
Well... Yeah. We are.

269
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,875
[YUTA]
C'mon, let's get to Junk.

270
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,125
[UTSUMI]
Right!

271
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,083
[ALL gasp]

272
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:51,500
[ALL scream]

273
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,458
Wow. Thank you for that!

274
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:03,208
That was too close.

275
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:04,500
Let's go, Utsumi!

276
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:05,750
Yeah!

277
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,416
[CALIBUR] I told you
that we'd have to fight.

278
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:15,791
So, what will you do?
Not much time.

279
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:27,833
[AKANE] I wonder if my
teacher actually died...

280
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:30,500
Well, not that it
really matters.

281
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:38,125
Gridman, please! I need
you to fight with me!

282
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:39,250
[GRIDMAN]
In this world,

283
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,875
I am merely energy
without substance.

284
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:46,250
Unless I merge with you,
I won't be able to fight.

285
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:51,791
Something only I can do.
Something... that I must do!

286
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,958
[GRIDMAN] That is your
and my Primal Acceptor.

287
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:03,291
You'll have to "Access Flash"
with me when you're ready.

288
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:07,458
Right!

289
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:10,916
Access... Flash!

290
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:29,166
[whimpers]

291
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:49,666
[YUTA] I feel so light!
Is that because of Gridman?

292
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,583
His color and moves
are different!

293
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,333
[YUTA]
I can hear you over there!

294
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:56,375
This must be the
optimized Gridman.

295
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:59,125
Yes! Go pulverize it!

296
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:22,000
[YUTA (GRIDMAN)]
Grid... Beam!

297
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:26,875
[YUTA (GRIDMAN) grunts]

298
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:28,291
It just reflected the beam!

299
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:32,125
[AKANE giggles]
My beam counter was perfect!

300
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,916
[ALEXIS]
Well done, Akane!

301
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:44,875
[UTSUMI]
Not this again!

302
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:49,250
[RIKKA]
He's gonna lose at this rate.

303
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:53,125
The kaiju, doesn't it
have any weak points?

304
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:55,500
No idea.

305
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:58,166
[RIKKA]
Can you stop that thing?

306
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,625
No, I can't.

307
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:01,291
For real?

308
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,041
Look, if you're a
friend of Gridman,

309
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:05,875
then please, do something
to help him out!

310
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:08,208
That, I actually can do.

311
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:15,750
Access Code: Gridman Calibur!

312
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,250
[CALIBUR]
Gridman! Put me to work!

313
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,708
[YUTA (GRIDMAN)]

[CALIBUR] Hey, Gridman,
let's slice it apart!

Right!

...End!

Uh. Thank you so
much for your help.

[CALIBUR]
Hm.

00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:29,416
What was with the sword?
That wasn't even fair!

Always such a violent girl.

"What I must do."

331
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:42,958
I did what only I can do,
together with Gridman.

332
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,875
But... this destroyed city,

I just got a hold of

They're fine.
I'm off to meet them.

Thanks for everything.

Who was that meant for?

[GRIDMAN] Yuta, thanks to you,
I was able to fight today.

Yeah, but what about all the
people we weren't able to save?

If... If you hadn't
done anything,

then more would've died.

Keep doing it. Do what
you can do... Always.

I knew it.

Besides us, nobody remembers
anything about the kaiju

And the city's back
to normal again.

[YUTA] If this stuff just keeps
repeating over and over,
