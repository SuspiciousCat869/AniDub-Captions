1
00:00:22,929 --> 00:00:24,681
Oh... So you think
you have a case

2
00:00:24,764 --> 00:00:25,974
that Naru should
investigate?

3
00:00:26,057 --> 00:00:28,268
Yeah. It all happened
earlier this week

4
00:00:28,351 --> 00:00:30,478
when I was on a date
with Akira in the park.

5
00:00:38,445 --> 00:00:40,363
We were just walking
and then all of a sudden

6
00:00:40,447 --> 00:00:42,282
drenched in water.

7
00:00:42,365 --> 00:00:43,658
How weird.

8
00:00:43,742 --> 00:00:45,035
Maybe someone was
playing a prank.

9
00:00:45,118 --> 00:00:47,746
They weren't... There wasn't
anyone else around us.

10
00:00:50,957 --> 00:00:52,917
Oooh...! What were
you two planning

11
00:00:53,001 --> 00:00:55,879
on doing with no
one else around?

12
00:00:58,214 --> 00:00:59,382
Sorry...

13
00:00:59,466 --> 00:01:00,925
You're really freaked
out about this.

14
00:01:01,009 --> 00:01:02,802
Yeah... After this
thing happened

15
00:01:02,886 --> 00:01:05,221
I've been way too freaked
out to go back there...

16
00:01:05,305 --> 00:01:06,639
It really makes me sad

17
00:01:06,723 --> 00:01:07,849
because that's
actually the place

18
00:01:07,932 --> 00:01:10,060
where we had our
first kiss

19
00:01:10,143 --> 00:01:12,979
So... you have fond
memories of the place.

20
00:01:13,063 --> 00:01:15,523
I think there's a good
chance Naru will take it.

21
00:01:15,607 --> 00:01:17,108
oh you really think so?

22
00:01:17,192 --> 00:01:18,777
I can't promise anything.

23
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,988
See... Naru only takes
cases he wants to.

24
00:01:24,949 --> 00:01:34,918
[Music]

25
00:01:35,001 --> 00:01:44,928
[Music]

26
00:03:00,837 --> 00:03:02,589
So that's pretty much it.

27
00:03:02,672 --> 00:03:05,800
She'll have better luck
taking that case to the police.

28
00:03:05,884 --> 00:03:07,844
How'd I know
he'd say that?

29
00:03:07,927 --> 00:03:10,263
If there's nothing else,
would you mind making some tea?

30
00:03:10,347 --> 00:03:11,765
Yes sir.

31
00:03:13,141 --> 00:03:15,143
It's been six months
since I started working here

32
00:03:15,226 --> 00:03:17,020
and I'm still no closer
to figuring out Naru.

33
00:03:19,022 --> 00:03:21,107
-Here's your tea, boss!
-Fine.

34
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:23,818
He never goes to school,
never watches TV

35
00:03:23,902 --> 00:03:25,320
or listens to music.

36
00:03:25,403 --> 00:03:28,239
All he does besides work is
read books about psychics

37
00:03:28,323 --> 00:03:30,241
and ghosts and stuff.

38
00:03:30,325 --> 00:03:32,285
You can go now Mai.

39
00:03:35,205 --> 00:03:36,456
For crying out loud,
you could at least say

40
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:37,957
thank you for once!

41
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:41,836
-Hey Lin.
-Yes?

42
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,215
Lin is shrouded in even
more mystery than Naru.

43
00:03:45,298 --> 00:03:46,716
The only thing I know
about him is his name

44
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,468
and that he rarely speaks.

45
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:49,719
What is it?

46
00:03:49,803 --> 00:03:51,721
I was just wondering
if you'd like some tea.

47
00:03:51,805 --> 00:03:53,056
No thanks.

48
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,270
That's how it always is.

49
00:03:59,354 --> 00:04:01,815
Oh well, I guess he
still doesn't like me...

50
00:04:04,359 --> 00:04:05,819
Good Afternoon.

51
00:04:05,902 --> 00:04:07,821
Masako...! Long
time no see!

52
00:04:07,904 --> 00:04:09,447
How are you?

53
00:04:09,531 --> 00:04:11,574
Is Naru here?

54
00:04:11,658 --> 00:04:13,827
Well, Good to
see you too!

55
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,328
Sorry...

56
00:04:15,412 --> 00:04:16,913
I just decided to drop in
because there's a case

57
00:04:16,996 --> 00:04:19,290
I came across that
Naru may like.

58
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:23,086
So, what is it you
wanted to talk about?

59
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:24,462
A friend from
the TV station

60
00:04:24,546 --> 00:04:26,673
has specifically
requested your help.

61
00:04:26,756 --> 00:04:28,383
Apparently, there's been
a strange phenomenon

62
00:04:28,466 --> 00:04:31,052
that's been interfering with
the filming of a new show.

63
00:04:31,136 --> 00:04:33,221
There have been hundreds
of cases documented

64
00:04:33,304 --> 00:04:36,016
about spirits appearing
inside film studios.

65
00:04:36,099 --> 00:04:37,767
That's just it.

66
00:04:37,851 --> 00:04:40,270
They haven't shot
anything in the studio.

67
00:04:41,771 --> 00:04:43,356
It's at the park...

68
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,900
Every time they shoot
there, without fail...

69
00:04:49,404 --> 00:04:51,823
The actors are suddenly
doused in water.

70
00:04:51,906 --> 00:04:53,867
That's what happened
to my friend Michiru!

71
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,660
So you've heard of it...

72
00:04:55,744 --> 00:04:58,079
Actually a number of
these types of incidents

73
00:04:58,163 --> 00:04:59,956
have been reported
as of late,

74
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,751
with the first report being
filed nearly six months ago.

75
00:05:02,834 --> 00:05:05,170
It sounds to me like
kids having some fun.

76
00:05:05,253 --> 00:05:07,255
That's exactly what I
thought at first,

77
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:09,591
but if this is just some
sort of practical joke

78
00:05:09,674 --> 00:05:12,552
than there should be some
evidence left behind

79
00:05:12,635 --> 00:05:14,846
Since the only evidence is the
wet clothes of the victims,

80
00:05:14,929 --> 00:05:17,015
this case is a mystery.

81
00:05:17,098 --> 00:05:19,267
The culprit wouldn't
have to be nearby.

82
00:05:19,351 --> 00:05:21,978
That's exactly what I told
the Director yesterday.

83
00:05:22,062 --> 00:05:23,355
Don't give me
that nonsense!

84
00:05:23,438 --> 00:05:25,398
I've seen it
with my own eyes.

85
00:05:25,482 --> 00:05:27,942
The water appears out of
nowhere, straight from the sky!

86
00:05:28,026 --> 00:05:30,153
Everyone on set is
starting to get worried.

87
00:05:30,236 --> 00:05:32,364
Please help us Masako.

88
00:05:32,447 --> 00:05:33,740
That's everything
I know...

89
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,992
So what do you think Naru?

90
00:05:36,076 --> 00:05:37,118
I would recommend that

91
00:05:37,202 --> 00:05:38,495
if they're concerned
with their safety,

92
00:05:38,578 --> 00:05:40,038
they should either
change locations

93
00:05:40,121 --> 00:05:42,290
or halt their
shooting altogether.

94
00:05:42,374 --> 00:05:44,167
The script calls for
that specific park

95
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,295
and shutting down production
would cost thousands of dollars.

96
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:49,047
That's none
of my concern.

97
00:05:50,423 --> 00:05:51,549
Wait.

98
00:05:51,633 --> 00:05:52,884
Look I owe the
Director a favor

99
00:05:52,967 --> 00:05:54,678
so I'd really like
to find a way

100
00:05:54,761 --> 00:05:56,596
to work this
out somehow...

101
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,181
You can understand that...

102
00:05:58,264 --> 00:05:59,474
Right Naru?

103
00:05:59,557 --> 00:06:00,725
Good luck.

104
00:06:00,809 --> 00:06:02,435
Everyone knows Naru only
takes cases he wants.

105
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:03,853
Which park is it?

106
00:06:03,937 --> 00:06:06,231
Say what?

107
00:06:06,314 --> 00:06:08,817
I told him about this
exact same case earlier

108
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,612
and he shot me down, but
he'll do it for Masako?

109
00:06:14,406 --> 00:06:16,700
I cooled down once I
realized technically

110
00:06:16,783 --> 00:06:19,160
my case was still
being investigated.

111
00:06:19,244 --> 00:06:20,787
And so it began...

112
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,206
So this is the location?

113
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:25,458
This one seems a bit
odd don't you think?

114
00:06:25,542 --> 00:06:28,461
I know, a spiritual phenomenon
that attacks couples?

115
00:06:28,545 --> 00:06:31,673
We have yet to determine
if it's a spirit or not.

116
00:06:31,756 --> 00:06:34,426
I assume that's what we're
about to investigate right?

117
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:35,927
Where's Matsuzaki?

118
00:06:36,011 --> 00:06:39,556
Uhh, I called her but I guess
she must be running late.

119
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,516
You know how she is.

120
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:43,977
She'll waltz in here and
say something like...

121
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,354
This is clearly the work
of an earth spirit

122
00:06:46,438 --> 00:06:49,107
Wow Monk! That
was perfect!

123
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:51,609
This is clearly the work
of an earth spirit

124
00:06:57,073 --> 00:06:58,616
Care to fill me in on
what's so funny?

125
00:07:00,452 --> 00:07:03,079
Now that we're all here let's
begin the investigation

126
00:07:03,163 --> 00:07:05,331
This is a case
about a phenomenon

127
00:07:05,415 --> 00:07:08,293
that only happens under
specific circumstances,

128
00:07:08,376 --> 00:07:10,003
which means that you
will all have to...

129
00:07:10,086 --> 00:07:12,505
Yeah we know. Get to
the point already...

130
00:07:12,589 --> 00:07:14,591
We'll exorcise
the spirit, right?

131
00:07:14,674 --> 00:07:17,218
Huh...? I'm not about to
do my ritual out here

132
00:07:17,302 --> 00:07:19,179
in front of all
these families.

133
00:07:19,262 --> 00:07:22,640
For this case exorcisms
will not be necessary.

134
00:07:22,724 --> 00:07:25,352
Then what exactly do
you plan for us to do?

135
00:07:25,435 --> 00:07:27,771
The plan is to have you
all act as live bait.

136
00:07:27,854 --> 00:07:29,064
Bait?

137
00:07:29,147 --> 00:07:30,857
The term sounds worse
than it really is,

138
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:33,860
however it's the quickest way
to draw out the spirit.

139
00:07:33,943 --> 00:07:35,445
I have a feeling this was
your goal from the start,

140
00:07:35,528 --> 00:07:37,238
wasn't it Masako?

141
00:07:37,322 --> 00:07:38,656
Now we just have to
divide ourselves

142
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,367
into three bait couples.

143
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,701
Hey Mai...

144
00:07:41,785 --> 00:07:45,080
Here's your big chance to
score a date with Naru.

145
00:07:45,163 --> 00:07:46,539
He's right.

146
00:07:46,623 --> 00:07:47,874
I better...

147
00:07:47,957 --> 00:07:50,251
Okay! I'm in!

148
00:07:50,335 --> 00:07:54,381
Alright. I think Naru and I
should be the first team.

149
00:07:54,464 --> 00:07:56,800
Ayako , You suck,!!

150
00:07:56,883 --> 00:07:59,010
I'm the only girl here who
doesn't look out of place

151
00:07:59,094 --> 00:08:00,428
on Naru's arm...

152
00:08:00,512 --> 00:08:01,721
What can you do...?

153
00:08:01,805 --> 00:08:04,015
I think we make a fantastic
couple, don't you?

154
00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:05,475
Naru?

155
00:08:07,268 --> 00:08:10,021
It's not fair.

156
00:08:10,105 --> 00:08:11,898
What's so great
about her?

157
00:08:11,981 --> 00:08:13,483
Does it make you
resentful...?

158
00:08:13,566 --> 00:08:15,944
That I forced this
case on you.

159
00:08:16,027 --> 00:08:18,071
Miss Hara...
Sensing anything?

160
00:08:20,156 --> 00:08:22,575
I am feeling a faint
presence of some kind.

161
00:08:24,411 --> 00:08:26,162
You're so lame Masako.

162
00:08:26,246 --> 00:08:28,123
This whole "bait"
thing is just a scam.

163
00:08:28,206 --> 00:08:29,541
Don't you, Naru?

164
00:08:29,624 --> 00:08:30,792
Bad idea.

165
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,043
Putting You and
Naru together

166
00:08:32,127 --> 00:08:33,628
would look more like
brother and sister

167
00:08:33,712 --> 00:08:35,130
than an actual couple.

168
00:08:35,213 --> 00:08:37,298
But I however...

169
00:08:37,382 --> 00:08:40,218
Whatever, Masako and
Naru look so alike.

170
00:08:40,301 --> 00:08:41,970
Are you still
whining about that?

171
00:08:42,053 --> 00:08:43,430
So what?

172
00:08:43,513 --> 00:08:45,223
Have you considered the
possibility of Masako

173
00:08:45,306 --> 00:08:46,891
blackmailing him...?

174
00:08:46,975 --> 00:08:48,143
She must have some dirt on him

175
00:08:48,226 --> 00:08:50,061
otherwise he would
have chosen me.

176
00:08:50,145 --> 00:08:52,147
Geez get over yourself.

177
00:08:55,358 --> 00:08:56,568
Not to change the subject

178
00:08:56,651 --> 00:08:58,069
but are you as
surprised as I am

179
00:08:58,153 --> 00:09:00,071
that Naru even
accepted this case?

180
00:09:00,155 --> 00:09:02,824
Yeah... I found it a
bit strange myself.

181
00:09:02,907 --> 00:09:04,534
He refused when I
told him about it,

182
00:09:04,617 --> 00:09:07,620
but when Masako asked him
he changed his mind.

183
00:09:07,704 --> 00:09:10,206
I knew it. She is
blackmailing him.

184
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:13,251
Everyone. If you don't
take this more seriously

185
00:09:13,335 --> 00:09:15,378
we'll never be able to
draw out the spirit.

186
00:09:15,462 --> 00:09:17,172
Should we be making
out or something?

187
00:09:17,255 --> 00:09:18,631
What about you Masako?

188
00:09:18,715 --> 00:09:21,009
This is your big chance so
you might as well kiss him.

189
00:09:22,385 --> 00:09:24,929
Even the thought of that
is totally unprofessional!

190
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:28,767
Don't tell me she's
actually going to kiss him!

191
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,602
That would be my
worst nightmare!

192
00:09:30,685 --> 00:09:32,145
Anyway we need to
change some things

193
00:09:32,228 --> 00:09:33,730
to draw the spirit out...

194
00:09:33,813 --> 00:09:35,065
Split up into couples

195
00:09:35,148 --> 00:09:36,941
and act independently
of each other.

196
00:09:39,944 --> 00:09:41,363
If only Lin
were here today.

197
00:09:41,446 --> 00:09:43,531
Then I would have some
actual motivation.

198
00:09:43,615 --> 00:09:45,325
Huh...? So you like...

199
00:09:45,408 --> 00:09:46,993
guys that quiet?

200
00:09:47,077 --> 00:09:48,244
Just the hot ones.

201
00:09:48,328 --> 00:09:49,871
No way!

202
00:09:49,954 --> 00:09:52,040
Of all the days to be
sick... You lucky dog.

203
00:09:56,795 --> 00:09:58,213
We decided to play
rock-paper-scissors

204
00:09:58,296 --> 00:09:59,923
to choose couples.

205
00:10:00,006 --> 00:10:02,050
We ended up with me
and Monk as one team,

206
00:10:02,133 --> 00:10:03,968
and John and Ayako as the other.

207
00:10:05,762 --> 00:10:07,013
Is there a certain
place here

208
00:10:07,097 --> 00:10:09,265
where the phenomenon
tends to occur?

209
00:10:09,349 --> 00:10:10,642
The only thing of
which I'm certain

210
00:10:10,725 --> 00:10:13,728
is the shooting location
was inside this park.

211
00:10:13,812 --> 00:10:15,230
So if it only
happens here

212
00:10:15,313 --> 00:10:18,066
then maybe it really is a
sitebound spirit...

213
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:19,734
Interesting.

214
00:10:19,818 --> 00:10:21,486
Naru... It's here!

215
00:10:21,569 --> 00:10:23,113
Hold on!

216
00:10:28,243 --> 00:10:30,745
Well uh... That
was kinda weird.

217
00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:32,288
Why is it so quiet now?

218
00:10:34,249 --> 00:10:35,458
No one's here.

219
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,342
It's okay. It was
just a cat.

220
00:10:44,426 --> 00:10:45,510
Oh that's cool

221
00:10:51,307 --> 00:10:52,350
What was that? !

222
00:10:52,434 --> 00:10:53,768
Miss Hara!

223
00:10:53,852 --> 00:10:55,270
It's here...

224
00:10:55,353 --> 00:10:56,646
Right behind Mai...

225
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,314
and It's a woman.

226
00:10:58,398 --> 00:10:59,691
She's young...

227
00:10:59,774 --> 00:11:01,359
Looks to be in
her mid-twenties.

228
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:04,529
-Miss Hara!
-What happened?

229
00:11:04,612 --> 00:11:05,864
I don't know.

230
00:11:05,947 --> 00:11:07,407
She just collapsed.

231
00:11:14,372 --> 00:11:15,623
What the...

232
00:11:15,707 --> 00:11:17,417
Serves you right!

233
00:11:22,088 --> 00:11:23,506
Serves you right!

234
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,801
What's wrong with her?

235
00:11:26,885 --> 00:11:27,927
Did she hit her head
when she fainted

236
00:11:28,011 --> 00:11:30,430
and turn into a crazy person?

237
00:11:30,513 --> 00:11:31,765
She's become possessed.

238
00:11:31,848 --> 00:11:33,058
Huh?

239
00:11:33,141 --> 00:11:34,934
The spirit's
taken over

240
00:11:38,563 --> 00:11:40,565
Oooh... He's hot...!

241
00:11:40,648 --> 00:11:42,359
I would have
totally done anything

242
00:11:42,442 --> 00:11:44,152
to date such a good
looking guy like this

243
00:11:44,235 --> 00:11:45,945
when I was still alive!

244
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:47,989
Well she's not one
to mince words.

245
00:11:48,073 --> 00:11:49,908
It's hilarious to hear
that coming out of

246
00:11:49,991 --> 00:11:51,618
Masako's mouth.

247
00:11:51,701 --> 00:11:53,161
It's not funny at all!

248
00:11:53,244 --> 00:11:54,704
If she doesn't let
him go this instant,

249
00:11:54,788 --> 00:11:56,748
there is gonna be
a big problem!

250
00:11:56,831 --> 00:11:58,333
Now tell me
truthfully spirit.

251
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,293
Are you the one who
is responsible

252
00:12:00,377 --> 00:12:04,339
for raining water down on
people that come to this park?

253
00:12:04,422 --> 00:12:06,299
Yes that's me...

254
00:12:06,383 --> 00:12:09,094
They can all just die of
pneumonia for all I care!

255
00:12:09,177 --> 00:12:11,346
But Why would
you want that?

256
00:12:11,429 --> 00:12:12,764
Because I hate them.

257
00:12:12,847 --> 00:12:14,057
I hate them coming here

258
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,309
and flaunting their
love in front of me.

259
00:12:16,393 --> 00:12:18,853
Why must they mock me
when I hurt so much?

260
00:12:18,937 --> 00:12:20,939
But What is it that's
making you hurt so much?

261
00:12:21,022 --> 00:12:22,190
Do you really
want to know?

262
00:12:22,273 --> 00:12:24,818
Oh thank you! I'll tell
you every detail...!

263
00:12:24,901 --> 00:12:26,486
It's the most heart-wrenching,

264
00:12:26,569 --> 00:12:30,573
tear-jerking story of lost
love you'll ever hear!

265
00:12:32,283 --> 00:12:33,702
This very park
is the place

266
00:12:33,785 --> 00:12:36,413
where I first set
my eyes on him.

267
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,250
Excuse me Miss.

268
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,876
yes?

269
00:12:44,963 --> 00:12:46,965
Fate brought us
together that day.

270
00:12:48,591 --> 00:12:49,759
Over some leeks?

271
00:12:49,843 --> 00:12:51,177
C'mon...

272
00:12:51,261 --> 00:12:52,595
This sounds like the plot
for some lame old

273
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:54,389
black and white movie.

274
00:12:54,472 --> 00:12:55,849
We would often meet
here at the park

275
00:12:55,932 --> 00:12:58,184
for the most romantic dates...

276
00:12:58,268 --> 00:12:59,978
Everyone around us
would get so jealous

277
00:13:00,061 --> 00:13:01,271
over how close
we had become.

278
00:13:02,522 --> 00:13:04,065
BUT THEN!

279
00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:05,650
He...

280
00:13:05,734 --> 00:13:07,318
He!

281
00:13:15,994 --> 00:13:16,953
How about we catch
a movie sometime?

282
00:13:20,665 --> 00:13:22,500
No, it can't be.

283
00:13:25,837 --> 00:13:27,756
So that jerk was
two timing you...?

284
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,132
What a piece of garbage.

285
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:30,550
Yes it's true!

286
00:13:30,633 --> 00:13:32,344
I loved this park
before I met him

287
00:13:32,427 --> 00:13:35,096
and now it only brings
up bad memories!

288
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,890
What's your reason
behind using water?

289
00:13:38,516 --> 00:13:40,435
Tell me! Who is this woman?

290
00:13:40,518 --> 00:13:42,479
I deserve an answer
now say something!

291
00:13:42,562 --> 00:13:44,105
Get lost will ya?

292
00:13:47,609 --> 00:13:50,153
Can't you see You're
bothering my lady friend.

293
00:13:50,236 --> 00:13:52,113
This guy must be the
scum of the earth!

294
00:13:52,197 --> 00:13:54,366
you can say that again.

295
00:13:54,449 --> 00:13:58,036
I was so lonely and
depressed over this guy,

296
00:13:58,119 --> 00:14:00,330
I decided to end
it all right here,

297
00:14:00,413 --> 00:14:02,207
in these gorgeous
gardens that once held

298
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:04,834
only my most
beautiful memories.

299
00:14:04,918 --> 00:14:06,419
Y'mean suicide?

300
00:14:06,503 --> 00:14:08,004
Yes...

301
00:14:08,088 --> 00:14:09,464
I do

302
00:14:28,316 --> 00:14:30,151
Hey Lady! What do you
think you're doing?

303
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,448
Nooo!

304
00:14:35,532 --> 00:14:37,409
I failed every time,

305
00:14:37,492 --> 00:14:39,911
but once I gave up and
starting walking home...

306
00:14:57,178 --> 00:14:59,222
That was almost
six months ago.

307
00:14:59,305 --> 00:15:01,474
Which is when the first
occurrence happened.

308
00:15:01,558 --> 00:15:04,477
And now I'm stuck
in this awful limbo.

309
00:15:04,561 --> 00:15:06,354
So why don't you just
like go up to this guy

310
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:07,981
and haunt him directly?

311
00:15:08,064 --> 00:15:10,150
Now Mai that wouldn't
be a very good idea.

312
00:15:10,233 --> 00:15:12,277
It sounds to me like this
creep needs to have

313
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,154
a scare or two put in him.

314
00:15:14,237 --> 00:15:16,990
That's what I thought,
and I did try that.

315
00:15:17,073 --> 00:15:17,949
But...

316
00:15:19,868 --> 00:15:22,746
I curse you!

317
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,793
I can't believe how
much we are alike.

318
00:15:28,877 --> 00:15:31,379
It's like I've finally met
my soulmate or something.

319
00:15:35,425 --> 00:15:37,635
again I was a
total failure!

320
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:40,013
This guy seems
pretty insensitive.

321
00:15:40,096 --> 00:15:42,557
I couldn't bear going
through this pain alone.

322
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,684
So I decided to haunt
all the couples

323
00:15:44,768 --> 00:15:47,270
that came here and let
them know how I feel!

324
00:15:49,814 --> 00:15:52,150
-Damn it!
-Was that really necessary?

325
00:15:53,568 --> 00:15:55,236
Serves you right!

326
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,821
Stop it!

327
00:15:56,905 --> 00:15:57,906
Attacking random people

328
00:15:57,989 --> 00:15:59,657
just because you're
mad at some jerk

329
00:15:59,741 --> 00:16:02,327
is just gonna make
everyone mad at you.

330
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:03,703
Is that what you want?

331
00:16:03,787 --> 00:16:04,704
What's with you Mai?

332
00:16:04,788 --> 00:16:06,414
Why are you so worked up?

333
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:07,665
Well I...

334
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:17,050
I just can't
stand grudges...

335
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:19,302
Life is too short.

336
00:16:22,263 --> 00:16:23,306
You know she's right.

337
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,599
If you keep this
up you'll become

338
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:26,643
what's known as a
sitebound spirit.

339
00:16:26,726 --> 00:16:28,103
Trust us. You'd
be much happier

340
00:16:28,186 --> 00:16:30,105
crossing over now than
trying to get even.

341
00:16:30,188 --> 00:16:31,523
If you'd like to do that,

342
00:16:31,606 --> 00:16:33,024
there's still time.

343
00:16:33,108 --> 00:16:36,569
Are you all in some
nerdy ghost club?

344
00:16:36,653 --> 00:16:38,029
Well Not exactly.

345
00:16:38,113 --> 00:16:39,489
So what do you think?

346
00:16:39,572 --> 00:16:40,949
I would have to imagine
that living in limbo

347
00:16:41,032 --> 00:16:43,827
like this gets
old after awhile.

348
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:46,413
Maybe it is
time I moved on.

349
00:16:46,496 --> 00:16:48,081
Wait!

350
00:16:48,164 --> 00:16:49,457
Even though I don't believe
in holding a grudge,

351
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,668
crossing over now wouldn't
deal with the problem.

352
00:16:51,751 --> 00:16:54,129
You would only be
sweeping it under the rug.

353
00:16:55,505 --> 00:16:56,881
Well... I mean is it's
not fair for the guy

354
00:16:56,965 --> 00:16:58,299
to get away with it...

355
00:16:58,383 --> 00:17:00,468
And I think you
deserve some closure.

356
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:01,678
You shouldn't worry.

357
00:17:01,761 --> 00:17:03,054
What goes around
comes around.

358
00:17:03,138 --> 00:17:05,015
He'll get his just
desserts alright.

359
00:17:05,098 --> 00:17:06,725
If she's content
with letting it go

360
00:17:06,808 --> 00:17:08,393
then we shouldn't pry.

361
00:17:08,476 --> 00:17:10,478
It's all up to you.

362
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:16,067
It's him.

363
00:17:21,489 --> 00:17:22,699
I want to teach that
dirtbag a lesson

364
00:17:22,782 --> 00:17:25,035
he'll never forget.

365
00:17:25,118 --> 00:17:26,327
But you've already
tried that before

366
00:17:26,411 --> 00:17:27,495
and it never worked.

367
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:30,540
How will this be
any different?

368
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,625
I have an idea.

369
00:17:40,133 --> 00:17:41,593
Excuse me.

370
00:17:41,676 --> 00:17:43,511
You recently did
something extremely cruel

371
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:46,306
to someone who cared
about you very much.

372
00:17:46,389 --> 00:17:49,517
I sense an evil aura
surrounding him.

373
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:50,894
I can see it...

374
00:17:50,977 --> 00:17:53,688
The spirit of a woman who
was led to suicide by you.

375
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:55,231
Who are you people?

376
00:17:55,315 --> 00:17:57,025
I don't know what the
hell you're talking about!

377
00:17:57,108 --> 00:17:59,235
You practically
killed her.

378
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:02,280
Its said a woman's curse
lasts a hundred generations.

379
00:18:02,364 --> 00:18:05,367
You should have her
exorcised as soon as possible.

380
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:06,951
You must have me mistaken
for someone else.

381
00:18:07,035 --> 00:18:09,079
I mean why would I
need an exorcism?

382
00:18:10,538 --> 00:18:13,833
hey, you're ...
You're from TV.

383
00:18:16,086 --> 00:18:17,504
Hey... Stop...!

384
00:18:17,587 --> 00:18:19,381
What the hell?

385
00:18:21,716 --> 00:18:23,218
It's... It's you.

386
00:18:30,016 --> 00:18:33,061
How does it feel to be on the
other end of your torment?

387
00:18:36,147 --> 00:18:38,191
Spare me, please!

388
00:18:38,274 --> 00:18:39,984
I didn't mean to hurt
anyone! I swear!

389
00:18:43,988 --> 00:18:45,782
Oh I feel so
much better...

390
00:18:45,865 --> 00:18:48,660
Now I can cross over
without any regrets.

391
00:18:48,743 --> 00:18:50,662
Thank you so much.

392
00:18:58,336 --> 00:19:01,965
And with that, the
woman's spirit was purified.

393
00:19:06,469 --> 00:19:07,971
Mai you were
awesome today.

394
00:19:09,597 --> 00:19:11,599
And let's not forget the
hilarious performance

395
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:13,101
Masako put on.

396
00:19:13,184 --> 00:19:14,561
What did I do?

397
00:19:14,644 --> 00:19:17,689
You went up to Naru and
started hugging and cuddling!

398
00:19:17,772 --> 00:19:20,066
And then you topped it
off with a big kiss.

399
00:19:21,109 --> 00:19:23,111
I kissed him? Seriously?

400
00:19:23,194 --> 00:19:26,197
Not just once, but
like a dozen times!

401
00:19:26,281 --> 00:19:27,490
No she didn't!

402
00:19:27,574 --> 00:19:30,076
why would you lie to
her face like that?

403
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,579
Wait a minute! You
guys are lying to me?

404
00:19:32,662 --> 00:19:35,415
Well you did hug him
and paw him for awhile.

405
00:19:35,498 --> 00:19:38,710
But I didn't kiss him.
Is that right?

406
00:19:38,793 --> 00:19:40,378
I would never
let you kiss him.

407
00:19:40,462 --> 00:19:42,255
Never in a million years!

408
00:19:42,339 --> 00:19:44,966
Just you wait Masako,
next time I won't eve-...

409
00:19:46,509 --> 00:19:49,137
You're all still here...? Is
there nothing better to do?

410
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,139
We just love being
in your presence...

411
00:19:51,222 --> 00:19:52,682
and must we remind you
why you finished

412
00:19:52,766 --> 00:19:54,642
your investigation early?

413
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:56,728
Although I do truly
appreciate your help

414
00:19:56,811 --> 00:19:57,812
in the investigation,

415
00:19:57,896 --> 00:19:58,980
I never would
have imagined

416
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:00,774
that you would have
so much free time

417
00:20:00,857 --> 00:20:03,318
that you'd start just hanging
out here after work.

418
00:20:03,401 --> 00:20:05,445
Are you saying that
I have no life!

419
00:20:05,528 --> 00:20:06,613
You're the one who practically
lives at his office!

420
00:20:06,696 --> 00:20:08,406
Naru I'd like to buy
you some dinner

421
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:11,159
to thank you for all the help
you've given me today.

422
00:20:11,242 --> 00:20:12,494
Oh please!

423
00:20:12,577 --> 00:20:14,871
Naru would never fall for
such an obvious come on.

424
00:20:14,954 --> 00:20:16,289
That sounds nice.

425
00:20:16,373 --> 00:20:18,083
What...? You're going? !

426
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,335
Of course he is.

427
00:20:20,418 --> 00:20:22,837
This isn't the first time
we've gone out together Mai.

428
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:24,839
just last week
we saw a movie...

429
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:26,508
Let's go Naru.

430
00:20:28,551 --> 00:20:30,804
Naru, you idiot!

431
00:20:30,887 --> 00:20:32,847
Why didn't you tell her to
get lost like you always do?

432
00:20:34,057 --> 00:20:35,225
Ayako may be right.

433
00:20:35,308 --> 00:20:37,060
I think she is
blackmailing him.

434
00:20:37,143 --> 00:20:39,229
I always just assumed
they had a patron together.

435
00:20:39,312 --> 00:20:41,106
Patron? !!

436
00:20:41,189 --> 00:20:43,566
Actually, it's quite common
in the US and Europe.

437
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:46,319
Parapsychology isn't a
recognized field of science yet,

438
00:20:46,403 --> 00:20:48,113
so all research
labs like Naru's

439
00:20:48,196 --> 00:20:49,989
need some type of
financial support.

440
00:20:50,073 --> 00:20:51,825
They'll often find
private sponsors

441
00:20:51,908 --> 00:20:53,868
or even large corporations
to help with funding.

442
00:20:55,412 --> 00:20:57,205
Oh so that's
what you meant.

443
00:20:57,288 --> 00:20:58,915
You had me worried there.

444
00:20:58,998 --> 00:21:00,375
Why?

445
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,794
Well in Japan the word
patron has another meaning,

446
00:21:02,877 --> 00:21:04,921
having to do with
the subject of geishas

447
00:21:05,005 --> 00:21:06,256
Ohh.

448
00:21:06,339 --> 00:21:08,550
Yeah ... file that away
for future reference...

449
00:21:08,633 --> 00:21:09,801
Though you may be right.

450
00:21:09,884 --> 00:21:12,262
If he has a sponsor it
could be Masako's dad.

451
00:21:12,345 --> 00:21:14,681
Then he may feel
obligated to date Masako...

452
00:21:14,764 --> 00:21:16,266
Huh.

453
00:21:16,349 --> 00:21:17,726
For him to afford the
rent on a place like this

454
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:19,477
he must have a sponsor.

455
00:21:19,561 --> 00:21:21,563
Is it that
expensive here?

456
00:21:21,646 --> 00:21:22,981
It's not just the rent.

457
00:21:23,064 --> 00:21:25,483
You have to factor in the
cost of all this equipment.

458
00:21:25,567 --> 00:21:26,901
Have you ever looked
at the price tag

459
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:28,903
of one of those high-speed
cameras he owns?

460
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:30,238
I don't want to know.

461
00:21:38,246 --> 00:21:41,166
It must be nice to
have a date with Naru.

462
00:21:41,249 --> 00:21:42,584
hey Mai...

463
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:44,878
You wanna go catch
a movie with me?

464
00:21:44,961 --> 00:21:46,546
I guess so.

465
00:21:46,629 --> 00:21:48,381
Then we have a date...

466
00:21:48,465 --> 00:21:51,634
Later we'll grab some food.
Anything you want... 'huh?

467
00:21:51,718 --> 00:21:53,970
Aww Monk. That's so sweet!

468
00:21:54,054 --> 00:21:55,805
He's trying to
cheer me up.

469
00:21:55,889 --> 00:21:57,807
I love you Monk!

470
00:21:57,891 --> 00:21:58,933
That sounds like
a great time!

471
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:00,810
You've got your
own Lolita now.

472
00:22:00,894 --> 00:22:02,520
It's better than having
a date with my couch

473
00:22:02,604 --> 00:22:03,855
like someone I know

474
00:22:03,938 --> 00:22:05,106
Oh aren't you cute.

475
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,358
I actually do have a date.

476
00:22:06,441 --> 00:22:08,234
But I think Lin's
working late tonight

477
00:22:08,318 --> 00:22:09,986
Oh It's not him.

478
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:14,991
She means me?

479
00:22:15,075 --> 00:22:16,868
Don't worry John.
I'll play nice.

480
00:22:16,951 --> 00:22:18,536
Be careful John.

481
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,497
She may try to stick
you with the bill.

482
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,873
What a crazy day...!

483
00:22:21,956 --> 00:22:23,958
Lin. You mind closing
