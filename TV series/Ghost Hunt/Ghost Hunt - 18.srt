1
00:00:09,208 --> 00:00:11,666
Help...

2
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,500
Help...

3
00:00:14,583 --> 00:00:15,500
Someone...

4
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:18,583
please...

5
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:20,000
Help me...

6
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:21,333
Help...

7
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:22,750
help me, please...

8
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:32,125
I don't want to die...

9
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:41,250
Welcome, thank
you for coming.

10
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,375
Please call me Ohashi...

11
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:46,583
I've been given full
authority to handle this matter

12
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:48,791
on behalf of the client...

13
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:50,833
If you have any questions
or need to speak with him

14
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:52,625
I will be your
direct contact ...

15
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:54,500
May I ask who is
in charge here?

16
00:00:54,583 --> 00:00:56,500
Yes of course, that
would be me sir,

17
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:58,375
my name is Kazuya Shibuya.

18
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:00,166
So it seems the rumors
of your young age

19
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,458
were in fact true,
Mr Shibuya.

20
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:04,666
Who have you brought
with you today?

21
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:05,958
They are accomplished
spiritualists

22
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:07,458
and friends of mine...

23
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:09,625
They have graciously
offered their expertise

24
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:11,250
on this case.

25
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:13,791
And... over here we
have my assistants.

26
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:15,791
Narumi Kazuo, sir.

27
00:01:18,916 --> 00:01:21,791
There actually is a
reason for all of this...

28
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:29,208
[Music]

29
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,208
I've accepted a
new contract.

30
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:07,250
It's a very high
profile case...

31
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,458
The client has requested

32
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:10,708
that we exercise the
utmost confidentially,

33
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,250
if the media got involved

34
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,416
it would no doubt blow up
into a massive story...

35
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,791
I think the safest
bet would be

36
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,458
if we all worked
on this together.

37
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:20,583
Excuse me, but did you
speak with a Mr. Ohashi?

38
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,583
Why, did you get a
call from him, too?

39
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:23,583
Yes.

40
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:24,625
So tell us...

41
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,041
who are we talking about?

42
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:28,916
Mr. Ohashi is just
a representative...

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,458
The actual client
would be...

44
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:34,291
Are you serious?

45
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:35,166
Isn't that...

46
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,791
the ex-prime minister?!

47
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:39,625
Wow, that would be a
major story for the press.

48
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:40,916
Which is why we should
avoid attention

49
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,250
as much as possible.

50
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,791
And a good way to start
is by asking Yasu here

51
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,291
to stand in for me.

52
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:48,541
Uh... what are you
talking about?

53
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,208
So that's the reason
why you asked him

54
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:51,875
to come here today, Naru...

55
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:53,750
I thought it might be
so we could celebrate him

56
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:54,958
passing all of his exams.

57
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:56,708
Oh man, you got
into college?

58
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:58,375
Yeah, of course...

59
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,500
So do you think you'd
be willing to stand in

60
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:08,958
and take my place, Yasu?

61
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,166
Oh, yeah...!

62
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,333
You guys are great

63
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:12,958
and I'd be more than
happy to help out...

64
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:14,375
Plus I think I
owe you one...

65
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:15,791
I mean if it
weren't for you all

66
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,083
I'm pretty sure the
case at my school

67
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,416
never even would
have been solved.

68
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,500
Wait a second...

69
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:23,333
I understand why you prefer
to steer clear of the media...

70
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:25,833
but do you really think
this calls for a body double?

71
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,250
The client has
apparently been calling

72
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,875
in a number of
other psychics,

73
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:30,750
including some shady
bottom-feeders...

74
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,250
I'm sure it's no surprise

75
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,541
that I have no interest in
associating with those types.

76
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,541
Nice... so you're
pushing it off on Yasu

77
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,041
just because you
don't wanna do it?

78
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,541
If you have a
problem with that

79
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,166
no one is forcing
you to stay here.

80
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,041
Geez! You should talk to me

81
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,791
before you go running
at the mouth!

82
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:49,083
Uuum, excuse me miss - are
you looking for someone...

83
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,208
Here's a shocker - when you're
asking people for favors

84
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:55,583
there actually is an
appropriate way to do it.

85
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:58,625
I've said this before but no,
you never learn do you...

86
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:03,916
Please excuse him...

87
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,750
this little boy's still
learning his manners.

88
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:08,375
This... little boy...??!!

89
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:11,000
Madoka... would you mind having
a seat and being quiet...?

90
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,833
we're trying to work here.

91
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:15,791
And that's why communication
is so important!

92
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,375
Isn't she something.

93
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:18,875
Who is she again?

94
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:21,958
Of course...
My name is Madoka Mori.

95
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:24,500
Hi, um, how do
you know Naru?

96
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:26,458
Well, I guess you could
say I'm his teacher.

97
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,000
His Teacher?!

98
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:29,916
Yes, I'm the one who
taught Naru everything

99
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,291
he knows about
ghost hunting.

100
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,000
To be completely honest...

101
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:39,041
I'm the one who asked
Naru to take on this case

102
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:40,958
I know it's weird and
you don't know me...

103
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,583
but I really hope
you'll work with us.

104
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,458
Which brings
us up to now...

105
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:52,958
This house is so weird.

106
00:05:58,333 --> 00:05:59,791
It's a little
more than "weird."

107
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,625
Hey have you guys ever
seen those paintings

108
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:02,541
that are like this?

109
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,000
I was thinking about that...

110
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:05,833
I wonder if the
builder was an artist.

111
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,375
Come in here, please.

112
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,083
What's that smell?

113
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:20,250
Is something wrong?

114
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:22,125
No, I'm fine.

115
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:28,041
What was that?

116
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,666
This house has
been unoccupied

117
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,333
for quite some time now...

118
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:32,833
Local teenagers...

119
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:34,833
took advantage by
sneaking in to explore

120
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,541
and scare each other.

121
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:39,125
However, two months
ago it was learned

122
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:41,416
that one of them...
went missing.

123
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,125
A young man from
the fire brigade

124
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:46,541
who was searching for the
missing boy also disappeared.

125
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,083
Shortly thereafter,

126
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:51,791
several people reported seeing
fox fires inside the house.

127
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,333
In fact, there are many

128
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:55,125
who would swear on
their very souls

129
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:57,125
that this house is haunted.

130
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,000
While the house
was being remodeled,

131
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,791
there were similar stories
of workers disappearing...

132
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:04,416
Of course, we don't want
anyone else to come to harm

133
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,166
and we'd like to try to control
any more negative rumors,

134
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:10,125
which is why you've
all been invited here.

135
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:12,500
Whoever exorcises the
house successfully...

136
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:14,833
may expect a very
substantial reward.

137
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:16,458
Interesting!

138
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:19,375
Also... if any of you decide
to withdraw from the case

139
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:20,833
I will understand...

140
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:23,041
if you would remain on the
premises until such time...

141
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,166
I would greatly
appreciate it.

142
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,333
Now, please allow me
to introduce everyone

143
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:30,500
who has so generously
agreed to join us today...

144
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:33,458
Ms. garashi, professor
at Otoha University,

145
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:35,958
and her assistant,
Naoko Suzuki.

146
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:39,208
Renowned medium
Masako Hara.

147
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:42,833
Reimei Minami, head of the
Minami Psychic Research Council,

148
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:45,875
and staff member
Hideo Atsugi.

149
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:49,416
Their mentor, from the English
Psychic Research Society...

150
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,375
Doctor Oliver Davis.

151
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:53,250
-Shut up, are you kidding?!
-Whoa...

152
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,708
Oh my gosh, who knew we
were going to be working

153
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:58,208
with the famous Oliver Davis
on this case...?!

154
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:01,458
Monk, isn't it cool?

155
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,333
Uh, Monk?

156
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,416
Look at him...

157
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,375
All star-struck
and freaking out.

158
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:07,583
I've gotta say...

159
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,625
I'm really surprised
that such an authority

160
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:12,166
on psychic research
would show up here.

161
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,833
I assure you we'll have no
problem handling your case!

162
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:17,791
After all, we have the
famous Dr. Davis with us...

163
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,333
and not to mention
the efforts

164
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,041
of all of these other talented
and fairly important people.

165
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:26,875
So who's this Davis guy...?

166
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:28,583
and why is he
such a big deal?

167
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,708
Because he's incredible,
that's why.

168
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:33,125
He's actually not involved
with the psychic power side

169
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,291
as much as he's done
a lot of really

170
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:35,958
fantastic spirit research.

171
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:37,958
But there was this one
time, a few years ago,

172
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:40,791
that he did this amazing
PK demonstration!

173
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:43,041
Was that the one where he
took the giant aluminum block

174
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,416
and slammed it into
the wall...?

175
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,166
I had to miss that one.

176
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,666
And there's also
that famous case

177
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,125
when Dr. Davis helped find

178
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:51,125
and rescue that American
billionaire's son

179
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,333
who'd been kidnapped.

180
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:53,791
Yeah, yeah

181
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:56,250
that kid had been buried alive
in the ground, right?!

182
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,750
That means Dr. avis
is clairvoyant, too!

183
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,291
Hey... isn't it sorta weird

184
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,000
that someone that
famous would be here

185
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,166
without more people making
a big fuss about it?

186
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,125
Honestly, his fan base
is pretty specialized.

187
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:09,250
I'm glad to see you're
all enjoying yourselves.

188
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,333
Hey, Naru...

189
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:13,333
where'd you run off to?

190
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:15,500
I decided to start
bringing in the equipment...

191
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,833
I mean, we were intending
to do some work here, right?

192
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:20,083
Oh my gosh I'm so sorry...

193
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:21,625
here, let me help...

194
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,208
No Mai... leave it there.

195
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:27,250
The equipment's way too
heavy for a woman to carry.

196
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,666
Oh... no...

197
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,791
I can do it.

198
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,416
You go ahead and
take a break.

199
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,541
Well, this is
very impressive.

200
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,125
Ah, Mr. hashi...

201
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,250
I hope you find this room

202
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:37,500
to be sufficient
for your needs.

203
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:38,750
Yes... thank you,

204
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:39,625
we're getting
settled in ...

205
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:41,083
If you don't mind,

206
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:43,541
may we take this opportunity
to ask a few questions?

207
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,208
Yasu's asking questions?

208
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,625
Of course, you're welcome
to ask me anything.

209
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,250
That's very kind of you...

210
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:51,958
Alright then, Narumi...

211
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,041
please proceed.

212
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,458
Yes sir.

213
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,625
Oh, I get it.

214
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:59,375
You said the house has been
unoccupied for some time...

215
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:02,000
would you mind telling us
who the previous tenant was?

216
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,375
The prime minister's
wife's grandfather...

217
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:06,208
and former family head.

218
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:09,333
He actually built this
house around Meiji 10.

219
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:10,583
But since that time

220
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,916
there have been numerous
renovations and add-ons.

221
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:17,041
In fact, up until the
last head of the family,

222
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,500
I believe additions
were made every year.

223
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:20,833
So it's unlikely

224
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:23,000
that much of the original
building still remains.

225
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,250
Tell us more
about the character

226
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,375
of this former
head of the family.

227
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:29,333
Well, his name was
Kaneyuki Miyama...

228
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:33,083
and he owned a lot of land
here in the Suwa region.

229
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,125
He ended up building
a silk mill here...

230
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:36,541
and was known for
his involvement

231
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,333
with various
charitable works,

232
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:41,625
even opening an orphanage
and a charity hospital.

233
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,125
Unfortunately, he lost
most of his ventures

234
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,541
when the market collapsed...

235
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,041
and the hospital and orphanage
had to be shut down...

236
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,833
He passed away...
shortly thereafter.

237
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,375
Mr. Ohashi, have you
ever witnessed anything

238
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,125
out of the ordinary
in this house?

239
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:56,541
I haven't.

240
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:58,708
Would it be at all possible
to interview those people

241
00:10:58,791 --> 00:10:59,958
who were in the
house at the time

242
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,250
of the child's
disappearance?

243
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,791
Well, we'd prefer to keep
this as quiet as possible...

244
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:07,625
Do you have any idea as to
the source of the ghost stories?

245
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:11,000
No... but the last
head of the family

246
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,125
might have suspected
something.

247
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:15,500
His final words
were instructions...

248
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,416
to leave the
mansion alone...

249
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,500
he wanted it to
deteriorate over time.

250
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,458
His final words...

251
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:25,375
You wouldn't happen to have
a floor plan of the house?

252
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,458
No, unfortunately
there isn't one.

253
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:28,958
I see.

254
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:31,083
Excuse me, who is
this gentleman?

255
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,041
My name is Lin Koujo.

256
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,875
I would guess that
you're Chinese?

257
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,708
I'm originally
from Hong Kong.

258
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:41,625
Wow Lin, I had no idea
that you were from China!

259
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:42,708
So what?

260
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:45,291
Uh... so nothing!

261
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,291
If that's all I
should take my leave.

262
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,791
Yes sir, thanks very
much for your assistance.

263
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:53,333
Alright let's
start by taking

264
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,625
temperature readings
throughout the house.

265
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:56,958
And after the sun goes down

266
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:59,125
no one does anything
alone, agreed...?

267
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,750
Miss Matsuzaki, I want
you to make some charms.

268
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,375
Be sure to make
enough for each of us

269
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:04,583
and for all of the rooms.

270
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:05,875
Relax man...

271
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,250
don't you think you're
jumping the gun a little?

272
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,541
That sounds exactly like
what somebody would say

273
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:12,166
to excuse their
own laziness.

274
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,958
This is a mansion that's
been empty for a long time...

275
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,125
There are numerous stories,

276
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:17,916
and there's no floor plan...

277
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,166
Given what we know and
what we don't know...

278
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,333
it's only common
sense to be cautious.

279
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,875
Hey...! what's wrong?!

280
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:28,791
There's a foul
presence here...

281
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:30,750
and I think I smell blood.

282
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,708
I think...
I smell it, too.

283
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,166
Man, this is like a maze.

284
00:12:57,458 --> 00:13:00,208
Dead end, ladies
and gentlemen.

285
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:02,208
He did say there were
a lot of additions

286
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,750
but seriously this
is kinda crazy...

287
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:07,583
Oh...

288
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,166
What is this?

289
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,041
I guess It's just
another weird room...

290
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:17,000
You don't think we might
actually discover the body

291
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:19,083
of anyone who went
missing do you?

292
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,708
If it's somewhere
we could find it

293
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:23,625
I'm sure the police would have
turned it up a long time ago.

294
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:25,333
-What the...
-What is it?!

295
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:26,458
Did you find a body?!

296
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:27,791
Not quite...

297
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,708
But... why would
there be another room

298
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:32,458
on the other side
of this window?

299
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:34,458
Well the shutters
look kinda new,

300
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,875
so I guess this is just
another one of the additions.

301
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:41,333
Just over 4 degrees.

302
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:42,958
Well, should
we keep moving?

303
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:43,875
Yeah...

304
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:45,583
which way did we
come in again?

305
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:46,583
This way.

306
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,000
Oh great...

307
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,291
uh hey, wouldn't
it be hilarious

308
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,291
if the three of us managed
to get lost in here?

309
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,833
A room inside a room...?

310
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:58,583
No way, this is totally
like we're in an RPG.

311
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,166
A dungeon maybe?

312
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,958
Well if this
were a dungeon,

313
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,125
there would be
something in here...

314
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:08,458
Oh that's too bad...

315
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:10,125
nothing's in there!

316
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:12,166
Hey you guys...
forget the dungeon...

317
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,625
have you heard of the
Winchester mansion?

318
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,583
Like... Winchester rifles?

319
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,000
That's right...

320
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:20,041
The inventor of the rifle
left a widow when he died...

321
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,583
For years she was constantly
putting additions on the house

322
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,666
to protect her from
curses and spirits...

323
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,500
She thought people killed
by her husband's guns

324
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:27,875
would come back
to haunt her.

325
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,416
It's supposed to be a
pretty complex house,

326
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,833
similar to this one.

327
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:32,916
You mean someone wanted the
house to end up this way?

328
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,125
Oh excuse us...

329
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,583
we didn't realize there
was anyone in here...

330
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:41,500
You're all with Shibuya
Psychic Research aren't you?

331
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:42,833
Who's that guy?

332
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,958
I think it's Minami -the
guy who brought Dr. Davis.

333
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:47,291
Ah, the eagerness
of youth...

334
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,166
I find it so
refreshing, really...

335
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,166
of course, when it comes
to psychic research...

336
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,625
It's all about experience

337
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:55,166
so I'll be very curious to
see how well you kids do.

338
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:58,958
Pardon me, I
realize I look young

339
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,041
but the truth
is I just turned

340
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:02,458
two hundred forty
nine this year.

341
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:04,166
I've got great genes -

342
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:07,083
everyone in my family
practically lives forever.

343
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:09,458
I don't really appreciate
being made fun of, kid.

344
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,916
Alright smart guy, then
tell me when you were born?

345
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,833
Well I was born
in Horeki .

346
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:18,125
You know, I think you young
kids today are just super...

347
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,833
but of course if I'd
talked to my elders

348
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:22,083
with the same sort of
disrespect that you've shown me

349
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,208
I'd have felt
it for a week.

350
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,791
Yeah... The times sure
were tough back then...

351
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,458
I'll never forget the
"Great Tenmei Famine" -

352
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:30,416
Man, Naru totally knew
what he was doing -

353
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,625
this kid is awesome!

354
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:33,875
Yeah, it's kinda
freaking me out a little.

355
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:36,458
And they scared me to death
with stories of the Onin War...

356
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:39,125
Oh... please wait!
I'm not done yet...!

357
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:40,666
Mr. Minami?

358
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,083
-Well done!
-Bravo!

359
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:44,458
-Good job!
-That was truly amazing.

360
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,833
Thanks but I really
feel a little guilty...

361
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:49,041
please forgive me for
being a jerk, to the jerk.

362
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:52,833
All of the temperature
readings we took

363
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:54,333
were on the low end.

364
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:55,750
I don't think we
should call it a day

365
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:58,125
until we've got the night-vision
cameras, thermography,

366
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,458
and condenser
microphones set up...

367
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:02,916
and remember to stick
together no matter what happens.

368
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,875
Tomorrow, I want us to measure
each room and the hallways

369
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:08,625
and we'll use those to
create a working floor plan.

370
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:09,750
So how about it, Lin...

371
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:11,500
do you feel like
drawing up a floor plan?

372
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:14,458
Alright everyone...

373
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:17,791
back to work.

374
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:20,416
Well... this won't be
over anytime soon...

375
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,458
Hey Mai... shouldn't you
call home or something?

376
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:24,541
Nah, it's okay.

377
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,208
Just let 'em know
where you are.

378
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:27,541
Well since I don't
have parents

379
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:29,750
there's not gonna
be anyone there.

380
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:30,833
What are you
talking about -

381
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:32,500
you're... an orphan?

382
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,000
Yeah.

383
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:35,666
My dad passed away
when I was little

384
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,375
so I don't remember
him much...

385
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:39,958
and my mom died when I
was in middle school.

386
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,750
Don't you have any
aunts or uncles?

387
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,333
Uh-uh... no one...

388
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,583
neither one of my parents
had brothers or sisters.

389
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:48,083
Then, who's been taking
care of you all this time?

390
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:50,291
Oh, well I had a teacher
that was really nice

391
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,250
and she let me come and stay
over at her house for awhile...

392
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:53,500
but now it's just me.

393
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,000
I'm all grown up!

394
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,375
My school is really
great to people

395
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:57,708
who're having hard times,

396
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,166
so my tuition is free...

397
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,541
between that and my job,

398
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,666
everything I need is
pretty much covered...

399
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,500
And, since I'm
supporting myself,

400
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:06,333
the school will let
me take off whenever!

401
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:09,041
I get it - if you wanna skip
you just say you gotta work.

402
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:12,416
Yep...! I can stay out
for as long as I want.

403
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,916
"No wonder you're stupid."

404
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,958
Oh wow...! you
sounded like Naru...

405
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:18,250
If life ever
gets you down

406
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,916
you just come cry
on Monk's shoulder.

407
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,708
Ew,quit it...! No, way...!

408
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,625
Let go, ya dirty old man!

409
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,000
Well you don't
have to be rude!

410
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:29,916
These cases
may be scary...

411
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,500
but I wish times like
this could last forever...

412
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,375
When we're all joking
around and laughing,

413
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:36,416
it makes me so happy...

414
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,958
it's the best
feeling ever.

415
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:54,458
Is something dripping?

416
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,750
Someone probably
left the faucet on...

417
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,125
No... it's off...

418
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:12,333
It smells like metal...

419
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:29,958
it was just a dream...

420
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:32,333
but it was so awful...

421
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:34,041
I feel a little sick...

422
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,416
This is so weird...

423
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,250
If you go by the outside
measurements it's a rectangle...

424
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:45,916
But when you actually look
at the room it's a square.

425
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,666
So if we measured correctly,

426
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,291
the thickness of the walls
would be three meters?

427
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:51,375
It is weird...

428
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:53,416
But maybe we just
got something wrong.

429
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,958
Excuse me... Mr. hibuya?

430
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:58,666
Uh, yes... I'm sorry -
what is it?

431
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,083
I think it would
be a good idea

432
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,291
to conduct a séance
here tonight.

433
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,958
And I'd like to invite everyone
in the mansion to participate,

434
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:06,291
if at all possible.

435
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,500
Hello... please come in.

436
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:17,208
it's Dr. Davis!

437
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:19,041
Try not to freak
out on him!

438
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,583
Hey... keep it down will ya?

439
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:22,041
Sorry about yesterday.

440
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:26,958
Ms. Egarashi...

441
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,250
can we add a little
light in here?

442
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,791
It's difficult to shoot
with the room this dark.

443
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:34,708
Oh... is that a regular video
camera you have there?

444
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,041
Yes, I use it often.

445
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,500
I see...

446
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,625
when you said you were going
to record this experience,

447
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,666
I assumed you had brought
a night-vision camera.

448
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,208
I beg your pardon?

449
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:44,875
I'm sorry, Mr. Minami,

450
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:47,250
there will be only a single
candle during the seance...

451
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,750
spirits do tend to
dislike the light.

452
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:52,166
Oh... I'm sure
it'll be fine...

453
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:55,625
Wow... how could he not know
something as basic as that?

454
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,041
I'm concerned, though...

455
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,708
Without a
specialized camera...

456
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:00,083
Wait a sec...

457
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:01,833
we have a night-vision
camera, right Lin?

458
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:05,916
Well then sir...

459
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,666
should I go and
get our camera?

460
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,875
Yes, please do, Narumi.

461
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,416
Oh, if you could please,
that would be wonderful...

462
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:19,791
Let us take a deep breath

463
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:21,250
and call out to the spirits...

464
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,208
Those living here
in this house.

465
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:29,291
To you who dwell
around us...

466
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,541
I welcome you to use
this woman's hand.

467
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,250
to speak your will to us.

468
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:36,500
Please, speak to us

469
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,875
and help us to understand
your wishes...

470
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,166
if you can hear my voice,

471
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:43,000
please, use this woman to
speak your will to us...

472
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,208
Masako?

473
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,083
What's happening up there?

474
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:16,166
Mr. Minami,
please sit down!

475
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,583
You must remain still!

476
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:24,666
Who are you?!

477
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:28,083
I know there's
someone here.

478
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:30,333
Naumaku san manda
bazaradan kan!

479
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:40,416
Are you alright?

480
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,708
Yes, ma'am.

481
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:49,333
It would appear that
you summoned a spirit.

482
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:52,750
It says, "help"

483
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:54,416
This one's the same.

484
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,375
This one, too.

485
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:57,958
Hey, this one's different.

486
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,500
Who wrote it?

487
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:14,833
I don't want to die...

488
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:23,125
[Music]

489
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:50,375
Next time on Ghost Hunt,

490
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:52,416
'The Bloodstained Labyrinth'
Part Two.

491
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,458
Until then...

492
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:55,000
don't turn out the lights.
