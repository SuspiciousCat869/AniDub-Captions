1
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,833
And then,

2
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:21,041
the woman led the policeman
through the dark hallways

3
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:23,416
to the public restroom
in the back.

4
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,375
Once there, the policeman
told her to go back inside

5
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:28,708
and wait to see if she
could hear the voice again,

6
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:31,208
and she did just
as she was told.

7
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:33,583
Do you want me to cover
you with a red coat?

8
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,458
She answered...

9
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:36,458
Yes.

10
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:37,708
And then!

11
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,208
The policeman burst
through the door

12
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:45,916
and found the girl
totally covered in blood,

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,708
as if she had a red
coat draped over her.

14
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:49,875
Mai you know we hate it

15
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:52,000
when you use that
creepy voice!

16
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:53,291
That day was
like any other,

17
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:55,666
staying late after school
telling ghost stories.

18
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,958
Every time we finish a
story we turn off a light,

19
00:00:58,041 --> 00:00:59,500
and then, once
we're all done,

20
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:01,333
there's always
one light left,

21
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:03,041
meaning there's another
person in the room.

22
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:05,125
You're up next, Michiru.

23
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:07,708
The other person is
supposedly a ghost!

24
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:10,041
Okay. This one's about
the old schoolhouse.

25
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:11,666
Do you mean that
creepy old building

26
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,625
down the street
that's collapsing?

27
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:15,500
But it's not collapsing...

28
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:18,250
It was being demolished when
the workers suddenly quit.

29
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:19,458
Because of a curse.

30
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:23,333
Lots of people have died in that
schoolhouse over the years,

31
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,416
most famously a teacher
that committed suicide.

32
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,000
So when they decided to
build the new school

33
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:32,333
they started to tear
down the old one,

34
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,333
but then...

35
00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:41,000
The demolition
ended that day.

36
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:42,791
Last year they started
the demolition again

37
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:44,583
to make way for
a new gymnasium

38
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:46,541
but a truck driving
by lost control

39
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:48,666
and crashed into a
group of kids outside,

40
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,708
killing some students.

41
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:52,125
But there's more...

42
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:55,291
I heard about this
from an upperclassman.

43
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:58,041
One night a student was
walking past the old school

44
00:01:58,125 --> 00:01:59,166
when...

45
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:08,333
Here goes.

46
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:12,250
One. Two. Three. Four.

47
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:16,041
It's the ghost!
It's here to murder us!

48
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:21,000
Oh, Please tell me
that was you just now!

49
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:22,333
Am I interrupting?

50
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:26,250
I thought for sure
it was the ghost.

51
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,916
Sorry I didn't expect
anyone to be here.

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,958
But then I heard
your voices

53
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:31,416
and couldn't
help myself.

54
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,333
Oh no... It's totally fine!

55
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,000
What year are you?

56
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:40,541
I'm seventeen this year.

57
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:45,125
Normally someone would
just say they're a senior.

58
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,375
So we were just
telling ghost stories.

59
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,583
I see...

60
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,375
Well maybe I could
join you guys sometime.

61
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:53,166
Wow... Do you mean you like
telling ghost stories too?

62
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,291
Yeah...

63
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,875
You seem like a
really cool guy.

64
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,458
What's your name?

65
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:00,083
My name is Kazuya.

66
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,625
His eyes.

67
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:03,416
They're not smiling.

68
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,708
Okay Kazuya...

69
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:06,208
I have one question ...

70
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:07,541
Why are you here?

71
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,208
There are some things
I need to take care of.

72
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:11,666
What're you
waiting for...?

73
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,166
Do you need our
help for anything?

74
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,291
No... but I would
love to be invited

75
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:17,166
to join you the next time
you tell Ghost Stories.

76
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,166
Of course!
You're welcome anytime!

77
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,958
How about tomorrow?
After school?

78
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,500
Okay... But Where?

79
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,875
Right here.

80
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:26,791
Something's
fishy about him.

81
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,708
I better get to
the bottom of this!

82
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:36,125
[Music]

83
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,708
I love this weather!

84
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:11,333
And I'm so glad
I left early...

85
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:13,458
I've got all the cherry
blossoms to myself!

86
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,916
The more I look
at this place,

87
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,083
the more I believe
the stories.

88
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,083
What's that?

89
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,500
A video camera?

90
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,833
But... What's it
doing here...?

91
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:45,625
I thought this
place was abandoned.

92
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:46,750
I doesn't make sense

93
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,083
that someone would
just leave it here.

94
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:49,916
Who's there?

95
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,458
Uh... I'm sorry...

96
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:52,583
I'll leave now.

97
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,458
Oh no...! Help!

98
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,125
Hey Mister, are you okay?!

99
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:18,208
Oh no. What should I do? I...

100
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:19,541
What's going on in here?

101
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,875
It's that guy
from yesterday.

102
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,125
Lin... What just happened?

103
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:29,958
You're bleeding.

104
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,541
-Can you stand?
-Yeah.

105
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:32,666
Oh my gosh...

106
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,291
I'm really sorry
about this.

107
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,208
He startled me and I guess
I turned around too fast.

108
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:37,708
Never mind all that...

109
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:40,125
Is there a
doctor close by?

110
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:42,083
There's a doctor just
down the street from here.

111
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,333
No thanks...

112
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:47,458
You've done enough
already as it is.

113
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,708
But...

114
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:51,791
We met yesterday, right...?

115
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:52,833
What's your name?

116
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:54,541
It's uh... Mai.

117
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,166
Well alright then Mai...

118
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,500
I thought you
might want to know

119
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,916
that you're going to be
late for your first class

120
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,375
since the morning
bell just rang.

121
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:04,125
I'm late?

122
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:05,750
I don't believe this!

123
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,416
What the heck was
that all about?

124
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,333
I never want to step foot
in that creepy place again!

125
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,583
Mai, are you leaving now?

126
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:16,916
We're supposed to
tell ghost stories

127
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,541
-with that cute guy, remember?
-Not me.

128
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,500
Awe, come on, Mai. Please!

129
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:23,958
This is our chance to tell
ghost stories with a senior!

130
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,791
Did you say ghost stories?

131
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:29,666
Is that what you three do
after school every day?

132
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,291
Then no wonder I've had
this headache for so long...

133
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:34,375
I'm very attuned
to spirits...

134
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,375
When they gather in
groups I get headaches.

135
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:38,791
So you're...
blaming us for that?

136
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,208
Of course I am.

137
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:42,208
Whenever you tell one of
your little ghost stories

138
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:43,708
you attract low
level spirits,

139
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,208
and they attract
stronger spirits...

140
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:47,166
and then we're
in big trouble.

141
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,125
So when you entertain
yourselves with these stories

142
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,625
you're putting me at risk.

143
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:52,250
So tell me...

144
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,250
If you're sensitive to
spirits like you claim

145
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:57,125
then do you sense anything
with the old schoolhouse?

146
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:59,375
Oh my gosh Kazuya
came to find us!

147
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:00,458
Hold on...

148
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:01,708
Are you the one
who put these girls

149
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,458
up to telling these
ridiculous ghost stories?

150
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:06,791
You didn't answer
my question.

151
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:09,541
Could it be your psychic
abilities are made up?

152
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:12,375
For your information there are
numerous spirits of those

153
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:15,083
who died in the war that
gather in the old schoolhouse.

154
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,583
In fact, I'm positive

155
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:19,208
that building was used as a
hospital during the war.

156
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,541
I've just seen too many
injured spirits there.

157
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,958
I was not aware of a hospital
being here during the war...

158
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,375
I know this school was
founded well before the war

159
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:31,791
so maybe... this was
a medical school?

160
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,291
Look I don't know.

161
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,250
But I really do
see spirits...

162
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,458
If you're not psychic
you wouldn't understand.

163
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:39,375
Sorry Kazuya...

164
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:41,166
Can we do this
some other time?

165
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,416
Yeah I'm not in the
mood anymore either.

166
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,666
No...? Perhaps another day.

167
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:48,750
Oh, and Mai?

168
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,625
Would you mind coming
with me for a moment?

169
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,583
How's you friend doing?

170
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,000
Yes about him.

171
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,750
He suffered a sprain
to his left leg

172
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:06,166
and I'm afraid he won't
be walking for awhile.

173
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,250
Gosh. Will you please
tell him I'm sorry?

174
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,875
So what were you two
doing there anyway?

175
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,083
Working.

176
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,750
Oh I get it.
You work for him.

177
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,666
Are you like his
assistant or something?

178
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,916
No, not quite.

179
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,416
He's the assistant.

180
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,666
I'm the boss.

181
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,833
And now my assistant
is stuck in a bed...

182
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:25,833
I believe it's up to
you to take his place.

183
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:27,125
Hey now hold on
just a minute!

184
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,666
The camera's broken.

185
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,458
My assistant tried to stop
you from touching the camera...

186
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:34,458
and it now it's
in several pieces.

187
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,708
Well Uh Can't I just buy
you a new one or something?

188
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,666
It's quite expensive.

189
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,875
Oh, then I don't
know what to do.

190
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,500
You can't afford
to reimburse me

191
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:43,916
for the damaged equipment,

192
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,166
which means there's only one
other course we can take.

193
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,458
You'll work off the
debt as my assistant.

194
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,416
Your assis... tant...?

195
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,583
You seriously think I should
start working for you?

196
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,958
Well, that's what I said.

197
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,625
What do you do
at your job?

198
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,416
I hunt ghosts.

199
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,750
Huh?

200
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,416
In other words,
I exorcise spirits... ghosts...

201
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,583
my company, Shibuya
Psychic Research

202
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,250
was hired to conduct
an investigation

203
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:08,625
on the old schoolhouse.

204
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,416
Psychic research?

205
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,708
Is that a question?

206
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,875
Psychic research
is another term

207
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:17,583
for spiritual investigations.

208
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,708
We basically examine
and scrutinize reports

209
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,208
of supernatural phenomena.

210
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,458
And I run the company.

211
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,166
Oh man!

212
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,708
One week ago, your principal
contacted my company.

213
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:43,916
Well the problem is...

214
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,791
we constantly have to
run damage control

215
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:48,125
over a rumor that the
schoolhouse is haunted.

216
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:49,625
When I checked the records,

217
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:52,166
I was able to verify that
up until eighteen years ago,

218
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,416
while the old schoolhouse
was still being used,

219
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,333
there would be at
least one or two deaths

220
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,000
inside the structure
every year.

221
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,041
It's also true that when
construction crews

222
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,500
were demolishing the
east side of the building,

223
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:05,291
there was an accident where
the roof collapsed prematurely.

224
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,166
No workers died
as a result,

225
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,833
though five were
injured in the incident,

226
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:11,166
which was ultimately
blamed on human error.

227
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,458
Construction ended

228
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,208
with only a third of the
planned demolition work

229
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:15,583
ever being finished...

230
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:18,458
A teacher did in fact commit
suicide in the building,

231
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:20,333
but that was explained
in the suicide note

232
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:21,708
left by the victim.

233
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:23,250
The incident with
the truck last year

234
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,083
was a drunk
driving accident.

235
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,625
That's when construction was
stopped for the last time.

236
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:30,625
No doubt, the rumors played
a part in this decision.

237
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:31,958
Based on my research,

238
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:34,208
the existence of
paranormal activity here

239
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:35,541
is nothing more
than fiction.

240
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,041
For a place this
active as this,

241
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:40,541
every occurrence has a
reasonable explanation.

242
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:41,875
We'll set up base here.

243
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:42,958
Base?

244
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,500
Precisely...we'll conduct
all of our observations

245
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:47,708
from this room.

246
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:48,708
Oh yeah of course.

247
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,291
Guess I'm still learning.

248
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,000
Set up those
shelves for me.

249
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,541
I'll start bringing
in equipment.

250
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,625
You're gonna leave me
here all by myself?

251
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:57,458
Would you rather carry
this stuff in...?

252
00:11:57,541 --> 00:12:00,125
It's heavy. Some of it's weighs
up to a hundred pounds.

253
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,166
I'll stick to shelves.

254
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,708
I can't believe how
stuck up this guy is!

255
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,041
I mean, sure it was my fault
that his assistant got hurt,

256
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,125
but does he have to
act so self- important?

257
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:29,250
Stop goofing off
and get back to work.

258
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:31,708
It's official.

259
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:33,000
I hate him.

260
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:35,791
What' are those?

261
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:38,708
An infrared camera and a
thermal-imaging camera.

262
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,750
They're used to shoot
in total darkness.

263
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:43,666
This one uses thermography
to record temperatures...

264
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,666
When a spirit appears,

265
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,916
the temperature
near it will drop

266
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,208
and show up
on the camera.

267
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:50,541
It's amazing that you know
how to use all this stuff.

268
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:53,291
No it's not. My brain just
works differently than yours.

269
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,000
I... see...

270
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:57,000
After all you are
Mr. Hot Shot boss

271
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,041
so you might as
well do everything...

272
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:00,125
But what made
you decide to go

273
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:02,000
into the ghost
hunting business?

274
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,708
Because someone
has to do it.

275
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:05,000
Well have you
had any cases

276
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,541
that you weren't
able to explain?

277
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,458
No. I'm very
good at my job.

278
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:11,500
Amazing... he's as
smart as he is handsome.

279
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:12,500
So you think...

280
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,750
I'm handsome, huh?

281
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,291
Uhh, well I mean,

282
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,125
that's what all the girls
at school are saying!

283
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:19,125
Well... They have
very good taste.

284
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:20,833
I can't believe this guy!

285
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,250
Sure he may be
good looking

286
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,500
and extremely successful
at such a young age,

287
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:27,708
but I have never seen a bigger
narcissist in my life!

288
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:30,083
From now on your
name is Naru...

289
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:33,041
As in Naru the Narcissist!

290
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,916
Well that's all we
have to do for today.

291
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,125
For today...?

292
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:46,208
You mean...!

293
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,208
I'll see you
here tomorrow.

294
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:49,500
Oh man.

295
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,250
Mai.

296
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,750
Have you been here with
Kazuya all night long?

297
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,041
What were you two doing?

298
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,833
It's kind of a long story.

299
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,625
Paranormal investigations?

300
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:06,083
So he's not an
upperclassman.

301
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,000
According to him,
he's a ghost hunter.

302
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:09,416
A ghost hunter?

303
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,958
Mai?

304
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:14,333
I was wondering if you
would introduce me to him.

305
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:15,375
Introduce you?

306
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:16,666
To Naru?

307
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,458
What's this Naru
stuff all about?

308
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:20,291
That guy has got to be
the biggest narcissist

309
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,708
I've ever met in my life...

310
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:24,250
I can't believe I actually
have to work for him now!

311
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,666
You know I have many
psychic abilities myself.

312
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,833
And I think I could really
help Kazuya with his work.

313
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:31,083
You know since he is
a professional and all

314
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:33,541
maybe it's not such a good
idea for you to get involved.

315
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:35,375
Well I'm by no
means an amateur!

316
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,916
Let's go, Mai.

317
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,500
That girl is
such a weirdo.

318
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:48,208
She's been like that
since middle school.

319
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:50,500
Yeah she's a freak.

320
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:53,083
Wasn't she in a lot of the
same classes as you, Keiko?

321
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:54,833
Yeah and she would
constantly bug people

322
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:57,666
about her spirits
or whatever.

323
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,125
Wait, I know why she
wants to help out.

324
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:03,083
I bet it's because she's already
fallen in love with Kazuya!

325
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:04,666
Eww! Gross!

326
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,083
-What's up?
-Checking yesterday's data.

327
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:15,875
So far there seems to
be nothing unusual.

328
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,083
That's some fancy
equipment you got there.

329
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,416
It seems a bit too high tech
for a couple of children

330
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,791
to be playing with.

331
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:24,750
And who might you be?

332
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:27,083
I am Ayako the
shrine maiden...

333
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,333
The principal
wasn't sold on you

334
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:30,625
so he called me to
drive the spirits out.

335
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,041
I was under the impression

336
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,500
that only innocent virgins
can become shrine maidens.

337
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:36,625
I see... and... your point!

338
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:38,916
At the very least I'd say
you're looking a little old

339
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,291
to be calling
yourself a maiden.

340
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:41,375
Nice...

341
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,375
Very funny you
smart-ass...

342
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:44,541
What about you?

343
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,125
I would guess you're
too intelligent

344
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,000
to be the shrine
maiden's assistant.

345
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:49,666
I'm a monk from Mt. Koya.

346
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,541
The name's Takigawa Hosho.

347
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,875
Since when were monks
allowed to have long hair?

348
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:55,041
Apostate?

349
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:57,125
I'm just on a little
hiatus okay...?

350
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,916
At any rate,
playtime is over kids.

351
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,125
Now you may have
gotten this gig

352
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:02,541
because your
office is nearby,

353
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:04,083
but the principal
himself said

354
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,583
it seemed like a scam to have
a teenager running the show.

355
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:07,833
Did he now?

356
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:09,416
The principal's
wasting his money...

357
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,625
There's no need
to have all of us

358
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,166
for such a simple job.

359
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,125
Yeah... All he
really needed was me.

360
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,583
Right... I wouldn't
be so sure.

361
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:18,875
Oh thank goodness
you're all here.

362
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:20,125
That haunted
old schoolhouse

363
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:22,583
has been terrorizing
me for weeks.

364
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,250
You see, I'm a psychic.

365
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:25,875
The souls of those
trapped there have...

366
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,541
Stop grandstanding...

367
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:29,583
You're just looking
for attention.

368
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:32,125
Are you really that desperate
for people to like you?

369
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,208
Excuse me! That
was extremely rude!

370
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:35,958
You know it's the truth.

371
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:38,208
She claims to have psychic
abilities in the hopes

372
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:39,750
that it will somehow
make her popular.

373
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,458
That is totally
uncalled for!

374
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,625
I'm gonna call a
spirit to haunt you.

375
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:47,875
Hold on Kuroda.

376
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:49,083
You're the fake...

377
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,000
And you'll regret this.

378
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:56,458
Whoa... I've never seen
her look so angry before.

379
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:57,875
Hey Naru...

380
00:16:57,958 --> 00:16:59,541
So... What's up?

381
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,041
What are we
gonna do today?

382
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,625
Wait... What did you just say?

383
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:05,583
Did you call me Naru?

384
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,666
Sorry... I...

385
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,791
Where did you hear that?

386
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,208
Huh...? You mean...

387
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,916
You've been called
that before?

388
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,250
Of course, that
makes sense.

389
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,916
I can't be the first to
think up something like

390
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,333
Naru the Narcissist.

391
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:18,541
Morning everyone.
Nice to see you all.

392
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,833
Say hello to John Brown.

393
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,125
G'day mates.

394
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,291
The name's John Brown

395
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,875
and I come from the great
outback of Australia...

396
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:30,166
I can't express how
excited I am to join you.

397
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,375
Mr. Brown is relatively
new to our country

398
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:34,541
so please show him the
respect he deserves.

399
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,541
Let me guess! You're looking
for a playground, right?

400
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:42,791
Well... Actually I practice
the ancient art of exorcism.

401
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:44,041
Only those who
have been ordained

402
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,541
in the Catholic
church as priests

403
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:47,500
have the ability to
conduct exorcisms...

404
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:48,666
You seem young for that.

405
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,166
You really know
your stuff mate.

406
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,750
And to be honest I just turned
nineteen a few weeks ago,

407
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,208
That's why I look so young.

408
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:55,583
He's nineteen?

409
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,250
That means he's
older than Naru.

410
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,125
So we have an exorcist,
an apostate monk

411
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:00,250
and a ghost hunter.

412
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,916
Obviously this
bone-headed principal

413
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,125
doesn't have much faith in my
unique cleansing abilities.

414
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:06,208
Just watch.

415
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:07,875
I'll clear this
entire place myself.

416
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:09,250
I'm gonna do
a walkthrough.

417
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:10,666
See you later.

418
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,125
Uh, excuse me sir ...

419
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:13,416
You may do as you wish.

420
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,666
I mean...

421
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,166
I'd really like to
work with you on this.

422
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:19,041
That sounds like Ayako!

423
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:22,666
-Open up! I'm trapped!
-Stand back!

424
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,208
I'm gonna kick it down.

425
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,000
Just hurry up and do it!

426
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:31,375
I was looking around
the classroom...

427
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:33,125
When suddenly the
door slammed shut.

428
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:34,958
I tried opening it but
it wouldn't budge...

429
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,541
There's definitely
a spirit here...

430
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:37,958
No there isn't.

431
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,958
I don't sense one
paranormal being.

432
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:42,291
Ghost!

433
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:44,000
Relax Mai, she's human.

434
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,208
Masako Hara is
a spirit medium.

435
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:48,625
Oh... Another one?

436
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:49,958
Fantastic...

437
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:52,083
So now they're
calling in a t.v. star?

438
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:53,208
This is ridiculous.

439
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:55,708
It's easy to fake
results on television.

440
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:57,083
The only reason
she gets ratings

441
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,291
is because she's pretty and
wears that silly kimono.

442
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,708
Why thank you. I take
that as a compliment.

443
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:03,750
Well. Trust me... it's not.

444
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,375
Correct me if I'm wrong

445
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,166
but I don't think I've had the
pleasure of meeting you before.

446
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,666
Yes... We have never met,

447
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,333
but your reputation
precedes you.

448
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:11,708
Right.

449
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:13,541
Anyways, there's
a haunting here.

450
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:15,125
In my professional
opinion...

451
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:17,333
we're dealing with
an earthbound spirit.

452
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:19,250
I believe it's a
residual haunting...

453
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:20,583
A traumatic event

454
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:22,166
must have happened in this
building in the past.

455
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,958
So you mean like someone
was murdered here

456
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:25,333
and they have to
spend eternity

457
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,416
searching the halls for
their killer or something?

458
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,166
Close... I think the
entity is afraid

459
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,583
it's going to lose its home,

460
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:33,208
so it's attempting to
block the construction.

461
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,791
John... What do you think?

462
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,708
Well to be honest,
I'm not sure...

463
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,500
But Usually a haunting
does originate

464
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,791
with a ghost or spirit
occupying a structure.

465
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:44,458
So It's either... a haunting...

466
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,208
or fiction and folklore...

467
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:47,583
Are you listening, Mai?

468
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:48,625
Of course I am.

469
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,083
What do you take me for?

470
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,500
These are things
you need to learn.

471
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:53,916
Enough talk...

472
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,500
I'm getting rid of this
thing as soon as I get back.

473
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:58,833
I don't know how long I could
put up with you people.

474
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,625
I wouldn't be so confident
in your abilities...

475
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:05,333
The spirit that haunts this
site is incredibly powerful.

476
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:06,666
Kuroda.

477
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,041
Move aside.

478
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:13,000
The spirit attacked me.

479
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:13,750
Huh?

480
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,750
It's true...

481
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:16,958
I was walking
down the hallway

482
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,791
when suddenly my hair
was yanked backwards

483
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,291
with amazing force...

484
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:23,083
When I tried to flee it
started strangling me.

485
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:25,250
You're interfering
with me, psychic!

486
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:26,875
Leave or die!

487
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,250
When did this happen?

488
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:31,125
A few minutes ago in the
second floor hallway.

489
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:33,000
That's false.
There is no spirit here.

490
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:34,083
Yes there are...!

491
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,541
There definitely are...!

492
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,166
And they're angry!

493
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,291
You said it was the
second floor hallway?

494
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,666
What just happened?
Is the camera broken?

495
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,916
No... but it is quite strange.

496
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:08,250
When a spirit
becomes active,

497
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,750
electronic equipment will
often malfunction...

498
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,458
but here I'm not so sure.

499
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:13,375
Is it...

500
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:15,625
a spirit or EM
interference.

501
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,291
It's quite
obviously a spirit.

502
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,625
Interference doesn't cause
someone to be attacked.

503
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:21,875
But Masako said there
are no spirits here..

504
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:23,791
Well, let's just say that
I'm a little skeptical...

505
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,583
about her.

506
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:27,291
It's common for
female mediums

507
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:30,083
to be either exactly
right or way off base.

508
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:31,958
Even if she can't
sense any spirits

509
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,250
now doesn't mean the
haunting isn't active.

510
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:35,833
If what you say is true,

511
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:38,500
then it's possible that the
spirit that inhabits this place

512
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,625
is very in tune with
your wavelength.

513
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,416
Yeah... That's right.

514
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,208
If that's the case...

515
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:45,958
then is this all our fault?

516
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,833
Whenever you tell one of
your little ghost stories

517
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:50,083
you attract low
level spirits,

518
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:51,833
and they attract
stronger spirits...

519
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:53,666
and then we're
in big trouble.

520
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,708
So, when you entertain
yourselves with these stories

521
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:57,041
you're putting me at risk.

522
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:58,291
Oh No.

523
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:00,375
Did our telling Ghost
Stories about this place

524
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:02,916
actually attract
real ghosts?

525
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:23,500
[Music]

526
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:51,166
Next time we continue
file number one

527
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,458
with Part two of
"Evil Spirits All Over?!"

528
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:55,000
You better keep
your lights on!
