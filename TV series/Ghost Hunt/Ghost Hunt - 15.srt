1
00:00:08,416 --> 00:00:10,458
Recently a string of odd
incidents have happened

2
00:00:10,541 --> 00:00:12,125
at Rokuryo High School.

3
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:13,791
Their principal had
requested our services,

4
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:15,583
but Naru turned him down.

5
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:16,916
Oh hi...

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,208
I am the student
council president

7
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:19,708
at Rokuryo High school.

8
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:21,000
You can call me Yasu.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,291
But after Yasu further
explained the situation

10
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:28,083
and it's dire
need for action,

11
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:29,791
we ended up
taking the case.

12
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:32,833
The school's staff
was extremely strict,

13
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:34,791
which bugged me to no end.

14
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:36,416
And to make things worse,

15
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,083
we were nearly attacked by a
phantom dog out for blood!

16
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:42,875
We knew we had our work cut
out for us at that point.

17
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:44,583
We eventually figured out

18
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:47,833
that the hauntings were caused
by students using orikirisama,

19
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:49,416
which is a form of
Ouija-boarding

20
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,708
that had become quite
popular at the school.

21
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:53,041
Soon after I had a dream

22
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:55,208
that included the
freshman Sakauchi,

23
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:57,750
who had committed suicide
earlier in the year.

24
00:00:57,833 --> 00:00:59,541
Whatever's happening
at Rokuryo High

25
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:02,333
has deeper roots than
we first imagined.

26
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:03,791
I'm starting
to get worried.

27
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:05,125
What's going to happen?

28
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:13,958
[Music]

29
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:49,625
You don't see
any spirits?

30
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:50,750
Well you did
just get here

31
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,458
so maybe that's it...

32
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:54,458
Should we give you a
minute to settle in?

33
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:55,958
Just because I
can't see them

34
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:57,291
doesn't mean
they're not here...

35
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:59,208
I do feel their
presence though.

36
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:01,000
Huh... Well...

37
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:02,791
That's too bad because
you're the only one of us

38
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,083
that can see spirits.

39
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:06,375
This case is not
going to be easy.

40
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:07,958
Now hold on...

41
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:09,541
Let's give her a
chance to settle in,

42
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,041
just like you said.

43
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:13,625
But you are able to
sense their presence.

44
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:15,208
Yes...

45
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:17,750
I can feel an abundance of
spirits around the school...

46
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,458
and their location...

47
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:21,666
But... What type of spirits...

48
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,458
I can't say.

49
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:25,791
Come on, just try harder.

50
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,416
Wait... I see something

51
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,375
but I can't quite
make it out.

52
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,458
It's like static
on a television.

53
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,708
Great... So we can't
rely on you...

54
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,541
Thanks for the help.

55
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:36,791
Miss Matsuzaki,

56
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,333
we all know that you're
the last person

57
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:40,083
with any grounds
to say that.

58
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,500
Do you know how
aggravating you can be?

59
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:46,125
Oh man, Here we go again.

60
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,416
Did you not get any sleep?

61
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,041
Oh... uh...

62
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:52,833
No...

63
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:58,333
I barely got a wink thanks
to that freaky dream...

64
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:00,250
But it did tell
me one thing.

65
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:03,625
That kid is involved.

66
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,083
I'm getting
something else...

67
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:08,041
This spirit has an
extremely strong presence.

68
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,250
What else can you
tell us about it?

69
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,625
Definitely a boy...

70
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:14,875
He's about the
same age as I am.

71
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:17,666
Which would put him at about
the age of sixteen, right?

72
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,625
I sense strong
emotions from him...

73
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:23,541
He's had some kind
of bad experience

74
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,375
happen at this school.

75
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:28,541
It's like he's being held
captive by the school...

76
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:30,416
He committed suicide.

77
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,166
And from the level
of hostility

78
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,666
it didn't happen long ago.

79
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,083
Could it be him?

80
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,791
Here... Is this
the boy you see?

81
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:41,916
That's him...

82
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,958
Yes...

83
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,833
His name is Sakauchi.

84
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:49,541
That is definitely
the boy from my dream.

85
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm not so sure he's being
held captive by the school.

86
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:55,375
Are you thinking
the kid alone

87
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,166
is to blame for
all the commotion?

88
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,458
Lin... how did
last night look?

89
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,375
There were several places
with temperature drops...

90
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:06,250
It was especially
pronounced in classrooms

91
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:10,958
three-one, two-four,
and the language lab.

92
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:12,958
No unusual images
to report

93
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:15,625
but three microphones
picked up some sounds.

94
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,833
Those were in the art room,
the gym's storeroom

95
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,958
and classroom two-four.

96
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:21,208
Interesting.

97
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:24,583
That's quite a response
for our first day.

98
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:27,083
Yeah... usually whenever
we show up to a haunting,

99
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:29,541
the spirits will hide at first
since we're outsiders...

100
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,375
They're normally
very shy...

101
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,250
so whenever you get a
response that quickly

102
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,000
it means the
spirit is strong.

103
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:37,208
Oh, I see.

104
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:38,666
Now Let's get to work.

105
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,041
Miss Hara...

106
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,458
Comb the school and find
every place you feel a spirit.

107
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,958
I'd like Miss Matsuzaki
to accompany her

108
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,958
and drive out any
spirits she finds.

109
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:51,458
Okay.

110
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:54,958
Mai will stay here so
please keep in close contact.

111
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:57,166
Do not take these
spirits lightly...

112
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,750
Use extreme caution.

113
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,458
I'd like Monk and John...

114
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:03,000
to take care of the
places we've mentioned...

115
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:04,541
Once you have
finished with those,

116
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,500
link up with Miss Hara
and assist her.

117
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:07,208
Sounds good.

118
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:08,541
Will do.

119
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,458
Lin and I will continue
to investigate

120
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:12,083
for more locations...

121
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:13,625
You think you could
give us a hand Yasu?

122
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:14,708
Sure.

123
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,291
-Mai.
-Yes?

124
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,416
Try not to fall asleep.

125
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,958
I won't.

126
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,916
Come on Naru...

127
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,833
If I'm just
sitting here...

128
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,750
I'm gonna...

129
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:31,916
get...

130
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,500
a little...

131
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,583
drowsy.

132
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:36,625
No, Mai!

133
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:37,916
Stay awake!

134
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,958
Oww, I hit
myself too hard.

135
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:48,375
What am I doing
in the hallway?

136
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:49,875
Mai.

137
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,708
Naru! You're back.

138
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:53,166
Did something happen?

139
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,958
It's getting
dangerous here...

140
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,958
You should leave
for your own safety.

141
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,041
Huh?

142
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,125
Naru... You see that?!

143
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:05,333
Those are spirits...

144
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:07,041
There are many of
them trapped here.

145
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:13,875
It's just...

146
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,791
like in my dream
last night.

147
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,875
Hey... that's
the locker room.

148
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:23,916
What is that?

149
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,833
I ask that my
humble plea...

150
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,041
be heard.

151
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,083
Where's it going?

152
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,916
The announcement room...

153
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,083
Now, watch.

154
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,750
It got bigger.

155
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,500
This doesn't bode
well for us...

156
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:49,625
The spirits are devouring
each other and growing...

157
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,000
like a virus...

158
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,500
pure evil...

159
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:53,541
Listen, Mai.

160
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,666
It's too dangerous
here for you.

161
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,583
But Naru... I can't
leave right now.

162
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,333
What if you run
into trouble?

163
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:00,750
Fine...

164
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,875
but you should learn
some warding magic...

165
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:04,166
and whatever you do,

166
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,750
don't go near any of
those evil foxfires...

167
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:09,041
Got it?

168
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:10,375
Understood.

169
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:11,916
Understood?

170
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,041
What are you
talking about?

171
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,250
If you keep
sleeping on the job

172
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:18,875
I'm gonna have to
tell the big boss.

173
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:23,250
Hey yasu...

174
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:24,541
Don't you think
it's kind of weird

175
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:27,125
how every kid at this
school is Ouija boarding?

176
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,750
Or wait... You call it
orikirisama, right?

177
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,333
Yeah. Funny thing is

178
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:33,625
there's all sort of
rules you have to follow.

179
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,041
Like when you use
a piece of paper

180
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,750
it can never be
used again...

181
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:37,916
Once you're done with it

182
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,375
you have to dispose
of it at a shrine...

183
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:41,291
And you have to
say an incantation.

184
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,833
Really?

185
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:46,291
Yeah, It goes "on-ori-kiri
something or other".

186
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:47,375
Huh... Wow...

187
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:48,833
I didn't know that...

188
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,625
I wonder why this
thing got so popular

189
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,583
with the entire school.

190
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,083
If you think about it

191
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,041
the whole thing is just
something different to do...

192
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,416
It's just novelty...

193
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,250
People always become
overly obsessed

194
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,083
with anything that's
new or different.

195
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,000
But there'sno sense
in analyzing a fad

196
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:05,458
because it takes all
the fun out of it.

197
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:08,375
You're a very rational
person for your age, huh.

198
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:11,333
Yeah... I've heard a lot of
people say I'm an old soul...

199
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,500
That I'm a politician
in training...

200
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,166
They'll say
"I can never tell

201
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,708
if you're really friendly
or just really full of it."

202
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:24,875
-Uh oh.
-Huh?

203
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:26,666
It's been twelve days...

204
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,958
There's gonna be another
fire in the locker room.

205
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:37,208
It may not be...
in the locker room.

206
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,541
Huh?

207
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,791
Oh I was just thinking
out loud, that's all...

208
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,750
I mean the fire could be
anywhere, like in the...

209
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,791
I don't know the
announcement room?

210
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,625
But what makes
you say that?

211
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,250
Ohh... Hey guys...

212
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,291
Do I see a budding
romance here...?

213
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,958
Isn't puppy love cute?

214
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,000
Monk...! We're having
a serious conversation.

215
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:01,083
There's no need
to be embarrassed.

216
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:02,791
Think you could maybe
give us a minute?

217
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,750
We were just starting
to hit it off...

218
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,708
Now if you'll excuse us.

219
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:09,666
Are you okay, John?

220
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,416
Listen kiddo...

221
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,875
I think it's about time you
and I had a little chat.

222
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:14,916
'Kay.

223
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,708
I know you have
a crush on Mai,

224
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:19,208
but there's a time and place
for this sort of thing...

225
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:22,791
You gotta, ya know, get
her in the right mood.

226
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:23,958
Yeah, that makes sense...

227
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,041
I'll try harder next time.

228
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,208
So you do have a
thing for Mai, hu?

229
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:29,750
Yeah... can't you tell?

230
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,500
Say what?!

231
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:32,625
However...

232
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,416
That Naru's
cute as well...

233
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,458
He's a stud...

234
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:36,708
But uh...

235
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:38,375
not like you.

236
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:41,125
You're so hot.

237
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,291
You're kidding, right?

238
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,791
Yep.

239
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,208
That's not funny man.

240
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:46,791
I thought it was.

241
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,833
You know that really
creeped me out.

242
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:51,250
It's Just a little payback
for interrupting us...

243
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,666
So, how did everything go?

244
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,291
Don't ask.

245
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,083
-That bad?
-Yeah.

246
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:59,916
We're exorcising every place
that Masako tells us to...

247
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,083
but it's like we're
not having any effect.

248
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:03,541
That's weird...

249
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:04,958
Hey That reminds me ...

250
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:07,375
Monk do you think you can
teach me some warding magic?

251
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,625
Huh...?

252
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:09,625
What brought this up?

253
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:12,083
Well I ... uh...

254
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:14,291
I thought I could maybe be
of some help to you guys.

255
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,708
If we have to start turning
to you to perform exorcisms,

256
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:18,291
we're in big trouble.

257
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:21,916
Hey!

258
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,875
Hands, like this.

259
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:25,125
Like... this?

260
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:27,375
This is the Seal of
the Immovable One...

261
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:29,541
Stand up straight
and then you say...

262
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:32,250
Naumaku san manda
bazaradan kan.

263
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,125
Huh?

264
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:37,083
It's a mantra.

265
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:40,166
Naumaku san manda
bazaradan kan...

266
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,666
If that doesn't
drive them away...

267
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,750
Then, make the Seal of the
Sword and focus your will.

268
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:47,375
Naumaku san manda
bazaradan kan...

269
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:50,166
Naumaku san manda
bazaradan kan.

270
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:55,708
So... I don't know what
to think about Masako...

271
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,500
She says she can't
see any spirits

272
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,416
but she can sense
their presence...

273
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,708
It's weird.

274
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:04,000
Naru said she's one of
the best in Japan, right?

275
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:07,416
Ya, but she seems
to be... off.

276
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,083
But what about you, Mai...?

277
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,666
Do you sense anything?

278
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,000
Geez...

279
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,541
You can't put me on
the spot like that.

280
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,125
Remember earlier

281
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:17,166
when I said there would be a
fire in the locker room...?

282
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,416
You corrected me,

283
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,291
saying it could be in
the announcement room.

284
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:21,208
Really?

285
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:22,708
Well I was taking a nap and ...

286
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:25,041
It was in a dream I had.

287
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:25,875
A dream.

288
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:29,083
I see.

289
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,166
Like I told you...

290
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,916
It was just a
stupid dream.

291
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:35,541
Ok Mia be a good
girl and sleep.

292
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,375
I'm not tired, Monk!

293
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,500
Whether you like it or not,
your dreams have meaning.

294
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,125
This is purely for
collecting information.

295
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:42,958
Now sleep!

296
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,666
Masako and Ayako did exorcise
the locker room earlier

297
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,375
so, maybe you're
on to something.

298
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:48,500
Come on...

299
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,000
It's just a coincidence!

300
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,708
Don't try to
play it off Mai.

301
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:54,041
You've had dreams before
that related to a case.

302
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,125
You want me to go to
sleep right on cue?

303
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,333
Now now...

304
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,958
We'll find out if Mai's
right soon enough.

305
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,833
If there is a fire in
the announcement room,

306
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:04,500
then it will prove that
Mai's dreams have relevance.

307
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,500
And if she does
end up being correct,

308
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:07,750
I'd like to see
her more involved

309
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:10,458
in the case-solving process.

310
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:13,666
Since when have you been
Mai's personal manager?

311
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,333
Since now.

312
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,000
You two keep trying
to one up each other

313
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:20,458
like you're related.

314
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:23,333
I'm tired of him running his
mouth about whatever he wants.

315
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,083
Just because I've been
right in the past

316
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:27,000
doesn't mean it'll
come true this time.

317
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:29,791
But later that night,

318
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,458
or more accurately,
the next morning

319
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,791
at four-thirty-two a.m...

320
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,500
that's exactly
what happened.

321
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,583
What did I tell you Mai?

322
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,083
I don't believe this.

323
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,541
I was right.

324
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:02,375
I never really thought
it would actually happen.

325
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,125
I mean I'm glad that I'm
able to help besides

326
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:07,500
just being a gopher
all the time, but...

327
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:10,250
Still... This is more damage
than we've heard of before...

328
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,375
It did more than
scorch the walls.

329
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:14,041
Yeah I've never
seen it this bad.

330
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,625
Where else are the
foxfires supposed to be?

331
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,166
Let's... see...

332
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,958
The printing room,
the language lab...

333
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:23,375
and the nurse's office
were the bigger ones...

334
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:24,375
But...

335
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:25,625
But what?

336
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,666
The chance that I know
is pretty slim, right?

337
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,666
I'm not counting on
you all that much.

338
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,750
Yeah... I wouldn't
expect you to?

339
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,791
I've got some
bad news Naru.

340
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,708
It looks like your
camera here is toast.

341
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,583
Oh... That's alright...

342
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,041
Insurance covers it.

343
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:40,541
Wait, it does?

344
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:45,958
Naru! Remember when you
asked me to be your assistant

345
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:47,500
because I could never
afford to pay you back

346
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,333
for the camera I broke?

347
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:51,166
Did you tell me that just

348
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,916
so you could get some
free help out of me...?

349
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,625
Promise you'll
tell the truth.

350
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:00,791
You're getting smarter
and smarter every day.

351
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:03,750
Why you...?!

352
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:05,833
How dare you trick me!!...!

353
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:07,208
Mai, he's not worth it!

354
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:09,500
NARU!

355
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:12,375
I can't believe he took
advantage of me like that.

356
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:13,416
Sure, I'll admit it.

357
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,916
I was naïve back then,

358
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,083
but the least he could
do is be honest...

359
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,166
Though he did give
me a really cool job.

360
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,291
Hey you.

361
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:23,708
Are you people done yet?

362
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:25,583
Ugh, not him again.

363
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,833
I heard there was another
fire this morning...

364
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:30,541
I guess your silly little
exorcisms didn't take.

365
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:31,916
Well, uh, sir...

366
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,708
The main problem
with you people

367
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,666
is the only place
ghosts exist...

368
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,458
is in your imaginations.

369
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:40,458
You exploit weak-minded
people to earn a buck.

370
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:41,666
Excuse me sir,

371
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,833
but I really need to
get back to work now.

372
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,375
Would you like to know
what happens to those

373
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,458
who ignore their studies
by wasting their time

374
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,500
with this occult nonsense?

375
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,208
It happened to a
student of ours.

376
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,541
He became so obsessed with
the dark side of life

377
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,291
it eventually lead
to his demise.

378
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:56,625
Yes sir...

379
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:58,583
We're aware of what
happened to Sakauchi.

380
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,166
Is that right...?

381
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,250
Watch out that you don't
end up just like him...

382
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:04,791
I'm sure he's regretting

383
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:06,333
what he did in
the afterlife.

384
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,708
He's had some kind
of bad experience

385
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,958
happen at this school.

386
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:14,708
So if I understand
you correctly,

387
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,291
you're basically not sorry

388
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,291
for what happened to
your student, are you sir?

389
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,666
What...?

390
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,416
I never said
any such thing.

391
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,958
Well I'm sorry but that sure
is the way it sounded to me.

392
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:28,791
Mai what's going on?

393
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,166
Uh, I don't know!

394
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,166
It smells awful!

395
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,208
Could that be the
same dog as last time?

396
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,000
Mai, careful!

397
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,333
I've never encountered
a spirit like that...

398
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,750
It's as if it had
physical substance.

399
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:08,166
Excuse me... Excuse me...

400
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,416
Matsuyama!

401
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,500
Huh?

402
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,250
You need to call
an ambulance ...

403
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:13,958
We have some injured
students here.

404
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:16,875
So... was that the same dog

405
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,666
we had a run in
with yesterday?

406
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,875
If it was then it's grown
since we saw it last.

407
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,708
It must be
getting stronger.

408
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,750
Masako...!
Are you okay?

409
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,583
What's wrong?

410
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:37,916
What the...

411
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,250
It's happening again.

412
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:44,750
It's just like in
my dream yesterday.

413
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:46,708
No, get away from it!

414
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,458
If you get too close
you'll get eaten!

415
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:52,583
Oh my god...

416
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:54,208
is that...

417
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:55,250
Sakauchi?!

418
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:03,500
It is him.

419
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,333
Are you two okay?

420
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:20,500
What happened...?

421
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:22,041
The two of you
just fainted...

422
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,583
It scared us.

423
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:27,083
I take it you saw it too.

424
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:28,333
Yes.

425
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:30,083
Sakauchi's gone...

426
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,583
He disappeared.

427
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:36,458
It's exactly like what
happened in Mai's dream.

428
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:39,333
The spirits have now begun
to consume each other...

429
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:40,750
Sakauchi...

430
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,500
He was absorbed
by another.

431
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:43,833
Hold on...

432
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:46,958
So any spirit we drive out
isn't being exorcised...

433
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,708
It just flees to
another location

434
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:50,791
where it's eaten by another,
bigger spirit?

435
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,166
And then the spirits

436
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,333
that cannibalize the others
become stronger...

437
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,833
It's quite frightening.

438
00:18:56,916 --> 00:19:00,125
And I thought it was
all just a dream...

439
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:03,000
If this continues
to escalate, then...

440
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,375
So what do you
think we should do?

441
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:09,250
It may be wise to hold off
on the exorcisms for now...

442
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:10,583
There's no telling
what will happen

443
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,583
if they run off this time.

444
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:14,125
This is getting worse

445
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,791
Umm... Excuse me.

446
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:19,125
What is it?

447
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,875
I heard something that
was a little disturbing.

448
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,375
And what's that?

449
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:24,958
Well...

450
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:28,125
I traced back to the first use
of orikirisama in the school.

451
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,875
My conversation
with Mai yesterday

452
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:31,125
got me thinking...

453
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:33,000
It looks like the
orikirisama fad

454
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:36,333
began shortly after
the second semester.

455
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:38,083
There were two groups...

456
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:39,750
The freshman class
and the art club,

457
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:43,666
and it seems they both started
using it at the same time...

458
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,041
But there's more
to it than that.

459
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,333
And unfortunately
it's worse.

460
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:50,208
Not only was Sakauchi a
member of the art club...

461
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:52,750
But he was also a
freshman at the time...

462
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,791
Now I'm not drawing any
conclusions from this,

463
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,291
but it is interesting...

464
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,833
It definitely seems like
it could be relevant.

465
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,916
Although it's an
interesting development...

466
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,333
It doesn't change the fact

467
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,666
that the practice spread
through the school...

468
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,708
Countless séances
took place

469
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:09,541
and spirits were summoned
as a direct result...

470
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,208
However there's still
a piece missing.

471
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:13,916
Something strange
and nefarious

472
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,416
is happening in
this school...

473
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,125
Regardless of how many
séances were performed...

474
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,000
I seriously doubt
amateurs could summon

475
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:22,416
such a large
amount of spirits.

476
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,041
So, what now...

477
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,375
This is a tough one.

478
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,833
What was I thinking?

479
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,875
I should have had someone
else come with me...

480
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:34,708
This school is the
creepiest place

481
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:36,458
in the world at night.

482
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:39,250
I'm just waiting for a
monster to jump out at me.

483
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:42,916
C'mon... Just stay focused
and it'll all be okay...

484
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,291
All I need to do is get the
tape and head back to base.

485
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:51,000
Cool, I'll just
grab this and go.

486
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,541
Uh. Oh man...

487
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:56,333
Naru's gonna kill
me if I broke it...

488
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:58,083
What? You've got
to be kidding me.

00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,333
A power outage...?

490
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:02,541
Talk about bad timing.

491
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:05,583
A power outage wouldn't
affect my flashlight...

492
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:08,000
I've got a bad
feeling about this.

493
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,500
I'm just gonna turn around
and head back to base.

494
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,458
Come on, door!
Open already...

495
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,416
There isn't even a
lock on this thing.

496
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,000
Children?

497
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,583
What are they doing here?

498
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:28,291
It's the middle
of the night.

499
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:29,250
Unless they're...

500
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:51,041
That smells like
formaldehyde...

501
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:52,583
Where is it coming from?

502
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,958
Somebody! Help me!

503
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:01,541
Let me out...!

504
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:04,708
Please somebody help me!

505
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:06,916
Please... help... me.

506
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:23,125

507
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:53,291
Next time on Ghost Hunt,
Forbidden Pastime Part Three!

508
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:54,833
Are you freaked out yet?
