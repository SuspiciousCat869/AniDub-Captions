1
00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:09,625
I'm Mai Taniyama,

2
00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:11,291
a freshman in high school

3
00:00:11,375 --> 00:00:12,500
and I work part-time

4
00:00:12,583 --> 00:00:15,750
with a team of professional
ghost hunters.

5
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:17,166
It was one thing
when we found out

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,250
that the doll Minnie was
behind the poltergeist,

7
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:21,625
but everything changed

8
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:24,583
once Minnie tried to physically
harm little Ayami.

9
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,000
Naru did tons of research

10
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:29,958
on the previous
owners of the house

11
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:32,416
and found out that lots of
children around eight years old

12
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,250
who have lived
here have died,

13
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:36,500
one after the other.

14
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:37,916
Going off the idea

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,458
that the children's spirits
were trapped in the house

16
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:41,541
and possessing Minnie,

17
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:45,375
Naru called in John and
Masako as reinforcements.

18
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:46,375
And then...

19
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:49,416
Monk, I'd like you to try
cleansing the house again.

20
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,041
But once Monk started
his exorcism,

21
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:53,625
things took a turn
for the worst.

22
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:55,666
Tomiko...

23
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,000
Tomiko...

24
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,625
my... child.

25
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:03,750
What am I looking at?

26
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:06,208
And who in the
world is Tomiko?

27
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:14,958
[Music]

28
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:48,875
Naumaku san manda
bazaradan sendamakaro

29
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:52,958
shata sowataya un
tarata, kan man.

30
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:54,750
Naumaku san manda
bodaran, on boron.

31
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:56,125
Monk, there's
something behind you!

32
00:02:58,083 --> 00:02:59,833
What? There's nothing
in here Naru!

33
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,583
Damn... I guess
he can't see it.

34
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:04,833
Mai, wait!

35
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,500
Monk... Look out!

36
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:13,958
Go...! Right now!

37
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:17,708
But...

38
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,625
We can see the
ghost on camera.

39
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:20,958
Don't just stand
there, Mai!

40
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,416
Get out of here!

41
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,875
Come quick!
You're in danger!

42
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:28,375
No one can interfere with me.

43
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,958
Mai!

44
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,916
Naumaku san manda
bazaradan kan!!

45
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:43,250
-Mai! Are you okay...?
-Yeah.

46
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:44,750
Come on. Let's go.

47
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:59,458
It looks like the house
was built over this well.

48
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:01,625
It must be pretty old.

49
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,375
There's the spirit
of an OSHIMA here

50
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:07,208
She's lurking deep
down inside the well,

51
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:08,791
calling to the
children's spirits

52
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:11,208
and pretending to
be their mother...

53
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:14,125
The children only
want to return home,

54
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,333
but they're lost and
can't find their way out.

55
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,916
Is Minnie there too?

56
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,208
Minnie, who is actually
Yuki Tachibana,

57
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:25,708
acts as the ringleader
of the children,

58
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:29,666
but in reality, she is in
so much pain and sadness

59
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,791
that she just wants all
of this all to stop.

60
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:47,583
It appears to me that this
well bores deep into the earth.

61
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,916
And At the very bottom,

62
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,458
lie the spirits of the children,
trapped in the dark.

63
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,625
Who is this Tomiko?

64
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,708
It's Oshima's child.

65
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,791
She's looking
for her child.

66
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:02,083
Tomiko is her daughter.

67
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:05,208
That's why she's
gathering the children.

68
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:06,708
Now we're getting somewhere.

69
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,791
Naru?

70
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:13,083
I need to take
care of something.

71
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,750
Naru... don't leave yet!

72
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,708
Naru... Where are you going...?

73
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,375
Why does he do this
every time...?

74
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:22,333
It's starting to get old!

75
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:25,166
He does that so often
I just expect it now.

76
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,083
How about we work on
driving out the spirits

77
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,333
until he gets back?

78
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:29,625
You're right...

79
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:31,125
Okay guys...

80
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,166
-Who wants to go?
-Hmm?

81
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,166
Which of you two is up
to the challenge...?

82
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,500
I'm warning you it's
intense in there.

83
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,416
Fine, I guess I'll do it...

84
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,166
But If I go, one
of you brave men

85
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,875
will have to watch
Ayami for me.

86
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:46,916
-Of Course.
-Sure thing.

87
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,208
May the heart of this
house be cleansed

88
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,000
as thy interim dwelling,

89
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,750
and enshrine thyself in
this altar of peace.

90
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,416
Ayako is so lame.

91
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,375
The only reason I'm here
is because she was scared.

92
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,500
And she calls herself
a spiritualist?

93
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,708
I just felt a chill...

94
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,583
Where could it
have come from?

95
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:13,500
I summon the energy
of this world...

96
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:14,958
And of Emperor Yamato,

97
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,416
who reigns over the Land of
the Eight Grand Islands...

98
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:31,250
What did you stop for?

99
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,500
Take it easy.

100
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,750
What's wrong?

101
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,583
I just felt
someone touch me!

102
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:39,333
You need to stay focused...!

103
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:40,875
You're a professional, remember?

104
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:43,791
Mai... What's wrong?

105
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:47,916
I can feel a...

106
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,041
hand on my...

107
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,541
Help!

108
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,125
Mai!

109
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:54,416
I can't stop!

110
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,291
Mai!

111
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,791
Help me!

112
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,291
Quick grab my hand!

113
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:05,916
MAI!!!

114
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,500
Where am I?

115
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:49,958
That's not Ayami...

116
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,083
Who is that?

117
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:58,666
No...

118
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,375
Get away from that man...

119
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,916
I don't know why but
that man is dangerous!

120
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:05,958
NO!

121
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,583
Stop!

122
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,166
Tomiko!

123
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,708
Tomiko! Tomiko!

124
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,291
Is that the girl's mother?

125
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:14,708
Tomiko!

126
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,916
NOOOO!

127
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:38,291
Don't...!

128
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,208
Naru?

129
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,708
Tomiko.

130
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,000
Don't do it!

131
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,500
Mai! Are you Hurt?

132
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,750
Ayako.

133
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,083
Oh, thank goodness
you're okay Mai, ...

134
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,666
Just sit tight. Lin's coming
right down to help you.

135
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,541
Oh yeah...
That's right...

136
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,125
I was dragged down
into the well.

137
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,833
Really...? A kidnapping?

138
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:16,833
That's right...

139
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:18,250
at 'least I think so.

140
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:19,750
It was a vision...

141
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,375
This man just strolls
up to the girl

142
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:22,916
and then walks
away with her...

143
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,208
so That's why I believe

144
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:26,000
her mother threw
herself down the well.

145
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,708
You have no experience
as a medium

146
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:31,833
so how could your dream
possibly hold any weight?

147
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:32,958
There!

148
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,666
That hurt!

149
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,708
Surprisingly enough...

150
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,708
I think she may have hit
the nail on the head.

151
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:41,083
Wait... So you agree with me?

152
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:44,500
I wouldn't go that far,
but it is a possibility.

153
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,875
I know that was
no ordinary dream.

154
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,458
It seemed so real.

155
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:06,208
Naru?

156
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:09,333
Now this is a dream
I've had before.

157
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:10,375
So Naru...

158
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:11,666
Ayami...

159
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,916
Do you really think
we can save her

160
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,416
before it's too late?

161
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,291
She'll be fine.

162
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:18,625
Really?

163
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:21,875
You're right.

164
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:24,375
As long as we do our best,
everything will work out.

165
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,458
Are you sure that's
a good idea, Naru?

166
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,083
He's back!

167
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,625
Lin. Play back everything
you've recorded thus far.

168
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,125
Right.

169
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,166
Hey Naru. You're back.

170
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,375
Yes, thank you, Mai.

171
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,208
I knew that already.

172
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:46,416
Why can't he ever act
like he does in my dreams?

173
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,250
What are...

174
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:48,500
Hey.

175
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,000
What do you mean, hey?

176
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,083
Aren't you two supposed
to be watching Ayami?

177
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:54,416
She could be in danger
right now for all you know!

178
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,583
Naru said there's no use
in guarding her anymore.

179
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,041
So we came back to help.

180
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:01,333
Wait... Are you positive
that she's okay?

181
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:03,625
She's fine...

182
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,500
Everything will
be over tonight.

183
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:17,041
Miss Hara... Can you see
what the spirits are doing?

184
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,333
They're in the
living room...

185
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:23,333
There's no indication they've
gone to the hotel yet.

186
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,875
Matsuzaki

187
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:26,041
Start making charms

188
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:28,333
that will stop any
spirits from passing.

189
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:31,166
I want the rest of you to post
them throughout the house.

190
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,625
We're going to raise a
kekkai barrier in here.

191
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:35,875
Care to fill us
in on the plan?

192
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:38,750
I'm planning on returning
Tomiko back to her mother.

193
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:39,833
Huh?

194
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:41,791
That's impossible, Naru.

195
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,125
Tomiko cannot be
returned physically.

196
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,333
Her mother will continue
to haunt this place

197
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:48,875
until we can at least create
the illusion of her return.

198
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,250
So we'll need substitute.

199
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,541
You don't mean
Ayami, do you?

200
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,541
The problem lies
with the woman...

201
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,583
If we leave here
without removing her,

202
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:03,791
we'll have failed.

203
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,791
But this woman
is dangerous...

204
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,458
She nearly killed
Mai an hour ago

205
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:09,083
when she pulled her
into the well...

206
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,291
I think at some point

207
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:12,666
we need to start
considering our own safety.

208
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:13,750
I guess...

209
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,291
but what about Ayami?

210
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:26,291
Come on guys.

211
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,583
I must say I'm disappointed
in all of you...

212
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,541
I expected much more.

213
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,416
If you can't even
think objectively,

214
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,666
then I don't need you.

215
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,750
But the risks are high.

216
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,166
If we screw this up

217
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,791
our spirits could be
trapped here as well.

218
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:48,791
Whether or not you
want to participate

219
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,916
is entirely up to you.

220
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,416
Mai, You're free
to leave as well.

221
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,833
Naru.

222
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:03,750
You poor thing, Mai...

223
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,916
He's quite a handful.

224
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,833
If Naru is prepared
to go that far

225
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:11,291
then there's at least
a chance of success.

226
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:14,208
Why is she so pro-Naru
all of a sudden?

227
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:15,916
I trust your judgment Masako

228
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,791
and if you think we
should then let's do it.

229
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,500
You sure?

230
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:22,041
Well at this point it's
the only option we have.

231
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,833
I agree. I think
it's a good plan.

232
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:29,541
If you all end up dead
I'll see to your funeral.

233
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:30,833
Well, how nice.

234
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:33,916
Just like Naru told us,

235
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,500
we began putting up charms
all throughout the house.

236
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,208
So... what exactly

237
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,416
is the purpose of putting
these charms everywhere?

238
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,666
It's simple...

239
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,208
To keep the spirits
from leaving the house.

240
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,625
Naru!

241
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,666
Be aware that we'll be
leaving the demongate open

242
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,541
to distribute the spirits.

243
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,041
Oh get off it...

244
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:03,000
Why does he have to
act like a bigshot?

245
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:05,458
'Cause he's Naru.

246
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:08,333
Uhh, did he say
Demon's Gate?

247
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:09,750
No Demongate...

248
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,500
The northeast quarter...

249
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:14,250
It's the easiest direction
for spirits to pass through.

250
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,791
Monk and Matsuzaki
guard the demongate...

251
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:18,333
And When the
spirits exit...

252
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:20,958
scatter them as
best you can.

253
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:23,500
So we'll be reducing the number
of spirits temporarily

254
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,125
to draw the woman out?

255
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,083
John I want you to
cover the living room

256
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,166
and do the same.

257
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,333
Piece of cake!

258
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:30,625
Wait, hold on a second.

259
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:33,458
Then Who's going to
conduct the exorcism?

260
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:34,625
You don't mean...

261
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,666
Our father,
who art in heaven.

262
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:08,500
Hallowed be thy name.

263
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:09,833
What's wrong?

264
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:12,000
Cleansings are addressed
to the spirit directly

265
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:15,375
to help them with issues they
had in their past lives...

266
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,875
Only a medium can
be successful at it.

267
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:21,916
Naru is no medium,

268
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,916
so he plans to
perform an exorcism.

269
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,166
What's the difference between
an exorcism and a cleansing?

270
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,916
In a cleansing you try
to persuade the spirits

271
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,208
to change their ways...

272
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:32,541
but in an exorcism

273
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:35,250
the goal is to destroy or
kill the spirit outright.

274
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,625
That's horrible.

275
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,958
I wish he wouldn't
exorcise her...

276
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:42,916
At least...
not in my presence.

277
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,250
Interesting...

278
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:49,458
To Masako, spirits and
humans are one in the same.

279
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,416
You okay?!

280
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,208
Yeah. I'm fine.

281
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,916
Something yanked
on my arm.

282
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:05,250
In the beginning
was the Word.

283
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:08,666
And the Word was with God.

284
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,708
Miss Hara... How 'bout now?

285
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,833
They're attempting
to escape...

286
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:15,208
Their numbers are
beginning to drop rapidly...

287
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,583
They're trying to get
out of the living room...

288
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,250
and they're crying.

289
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,208
Hey wait...

290
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:21,458
Why don't you go ahead

291
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:23,333
and cleanse the children's
spirits right now?

292
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:24,541
Impossible...

293
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,791
Not as long as the
woman's spirit is here.

294
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:29,458
What is it?

295
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,750
She's coming out.

296
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,250
Tomiko.

297
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:03,541
Tomiko.

298
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:08,625
Those eyes.

299
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,458
Tomiko is not here!

300
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:12,750
These children do
not belong to you!

301
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,625
Please, set them free.

302
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:17,000
Can't you see the pain
they're suffering?

303
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,791
They just want to return
to their real mothers.

304
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:20,875
Let them go...!

305
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:34,125
John!

306
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:45,208
Naru...! Give me
another minute...!

307
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:46,541
Please, don't!

308
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,000
Naru wait!

309
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:51,333
Your child is right here...

310
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:52,541
look?

311
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:59,083
What is that?

312
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,416
Take the children you've
gathered with you...

313
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,791
and leave this place!

314
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,416
What a warm light.

315
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,750
It's so beautiful.

316
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:42,916
Look Mai... right there.

317
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,458
They're all gone now...

318
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,000
They've been cleansed.

319
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:14,916
And with that,
another case was solved.

320
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:23,916
You have no idea how
grateful I am for your help.

321
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,333
I just heard
from my brother

322
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,416
and he said he'll be
returning as soon as he can.

323
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,125
Oh, That's great news!

324
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:30,666
Are you sure it's safe...?

325
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,083
I mean you're sure

326
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,958
that you got rid of all
the ghosts in the house?

327
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,625
There's no need to worry.

328
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,125
Last one.

329
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:40,000
We're set to go.

330
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,416
Naru. What was that little
thing you gave the ghost?

331
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,000
It was a hitogata.

332
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,000
What is that?

333
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,708
It's the original form of
the straw effigy dolls...

334
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:50,750
It's made by carving a
piece of Paulownia wood

335
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:51,708
into the shape
of the person

336
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,291
you want to put a spell on.

337
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:54,458
You dummy ...

338
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:56,500
That's how you put
a curse on someone.

339
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:59,708
Spellcasting has both a
light and a dark side.

340
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:01,583
A light spell
helps the person

341
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:03,375
while a dark harms them.

342
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,000
Often the casting
has a combination

343
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:06,750
of light and dark sides.

344
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:07,791
That's right...

345
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,625
It's just like in
esoteric Buddhism,

346
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,958
where either approach can be
used to confound a sworn enemy.

347
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:16,208
The hitogata is simply a vessel
used to contain a spirit...

348
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:19,833
For example, let's say I
patterned an effigy after Mai.

349
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:22,250
If I were to
damage the hitogata,

350
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:24,000
Mai would be harmed as well.

351
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,750
That's how close the
effigy is to the real person.

352
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:30,291
So that one was...

353
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:31,708
Made for Tomiko.

354
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:33,250
Of course...

355
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,291
Since she thought she had
retrieved her daughter Tomiko,

356
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:38,708
she was cleansed because
her wish had been fulfilled.

357
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:40,166
I gotta to say I'm impressed

358
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,416
you made a successful
hitogata that quickly.

359
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,791
Is that why you
had left earlier?

360
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,291
The date of Tomiko's birth
and death were necessary

361
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,000
for the effigy
to be effective.

362
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,666
The woman was Oshima Hiro.

363
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,041
Tomiko was her
only child...

364
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:55,708
The girl had
disappeared one day

365
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:57,166
and her body surfaced
from the pond

366
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,333
about six months later.

367
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:00,875
A couple of
years after that,

368
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:02,916
Oshima's house
was demolished...

369
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,333
and the house before us
now was built in its place.

370
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:06,916
Tomiko...

371
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,625
Do we know if,
she was kidnapped?

372
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:11,958
Is that why the mother
threw herself down the well?

373
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:17,083
There was no mention
of a kidnapping...

374
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:19,625
The important thing is that
this house is free of spirits.

375
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:22,250
I wonder...

376
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:23,833
Were you planning
on a cleansing

377
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,333
from the very beginning, Naru?

378
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,291
I never would have pegged
him as an Onmyouji!

379
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,791
Onmyouji...?

380
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,958
Do you mean like
that Abe guy?

381
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:39,041
Fashioning a hitogata
after Tomiko

382
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:41,750
and cleansing the mother
is pretty complicated...

383
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,791
Only a pro can
pull that off.

384
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,208
It's amazing isn't it...?

385
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:46,750
With how young Naru is.

386
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:48,000
Amazing?

387
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:49,916
Well it's definitely cool.

388
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,416
-Hey Mai!
-Hey...! What's up Ayami?

389
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,166
So Do you think...

390
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,833
we'll see each
other again?

391
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:02,416
I'll tell you what.

392
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,000
If you ever need me,
just call.

393
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:08,083
-You promise?
-Promise.

394
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:09,375
At the end of the day,

395
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:11,375
I'm just happy that
Ayami is safe.

396
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:23,083
[Music]

397
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:51,041
Next time on Ghost Hunt,

398
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:53,291
the After School Hexer,
part one!

399
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:54,875
Aw Back to school, again?
