1
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,666
SPR has been hired
to investigate

2
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,166
a series of
dangerous hauntings

3
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,166
that have been occurring
at Rokuryo High School.

4
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,291
Unfortunately we can't
exorcise anything

5
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:20,000
because Masako is having
trouble seeing the spirits.

6
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:21,625
I started having
vivid dreams

7
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:24,541
where foxfires were
swallowing other spirits,

8
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:27,041
making them grow larger
and more dangerous.

9
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:28,708
My dreams became a reality

10
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:30,916
when the dog from the
first day came back,

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,041
only bigger and angrier.

12
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:34,916
Things were starting
to get out of control.

13
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,125
And now, Sakauchi's spirit,

14
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:39,708
which was trapped
inside this school,

15
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:41,250
has been swallowed
by a foxfire.

16
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:46,583
Eventually, even
I was attacked...!

17
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:48,416
Please, save me, Naru!

18
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:55,958
[Music]

19
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:31,875
What...

20
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:33,583
What happened to me?

21
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:44,083
Oh no...

22
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:45,875
Not again.

23
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:48,458
It's being eaten up by
that ugly purple thing.

24
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,000
Just like Sakauchi.

25
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:07,916
Now where am I?

26
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,666
Woah, look at
all the books.

27
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,541
This is the kind of
stuff Naru would read...

28
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:19,500
but there's something
about this room

29
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,458
that feels lonely...

30
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:22,625
Like whoever lives here,

31
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:25,041
has been away for
a really long time.

32
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,791
This train pass
is expired.

33
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,375
This is Sakauchi's room.

34
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,125
I'm sorry...

35
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,208
I'm sorry I
couldn't help you.

36
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:51,083
Mai.

37
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:56,541
Mai!

38
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:57,958
Are you awake?

39
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:04,833
I don't feel so good.

40
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:06,791
Then don't sit up
so fast... dummy.

41
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:07,916
Gee thanks...

42
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,250
Just stay still, Mai.

43
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:12,666
Okay.

44
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,625
Hey.

45
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,500
Morning. G'day.

46
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:17,541
Hey guys...

47
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,750
So... where am I?

48
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,333
The nurses office.

49
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,583
Why were you wandering around
by yourself last night?

50
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,416
I had to get a videotape.

51
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,333
What?

52
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:27,833
Naru...

53
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:28,875
What were you thinking...?

54
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:30,458
How could you send
her on an errand

55
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:31,916
in such a volatile place?

56
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,583
Geez... can't even tell
if he's listening to me...

57
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,625
So, what happened Mai?

58
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:39,916
Hm... Let's see...

59
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,208
The spirits of children, eh?

60
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:46,875
Masako, can you tell
if they're still here?

61
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:47,958
They're gone...

62
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,541
I can't feel
their presence.

63
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:50,875
So uh...

64
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,541
Why didn't you use
that warding magic

65
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,666
like I taught you?

66
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,666
Oh... I totally forgot.

67
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,958
If you're not injured

68
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,958
then there's no need
for us to stay here...

69
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:00,500
We need to get
back to work...

70
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:01,750
Matsuzaki...

71
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,208
Keep an eye on her.

72
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:04,083
Sure thing.

73
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,250
If you're still
not feeling well

74
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,583
you can stay in bed
as long as you want.

75
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,500
Wait.

76
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:15,458
What is it?

77
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:16,916
Stay with me.

78
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,916
I'm not going anywhere.

79
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:39,875
That shrine looks important...

80
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:42,583
I wonder if this
is another dream...

81
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:45,125
Come on Mai,
of course it is.

82
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,291
Well, I guess I'd better
start paying attention

83
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:50,791
'cause it'll
probably come true.

84
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:53,250
Since this is
a dream then...

85
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,083
Yep, there he is.

86
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:57,625
It's dangerous out here.

87
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:59,666
What?

88
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,541
It's not safe here Mai...

89
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:02,916
Wake up...

90
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,083
Time to go.

91
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:05,250
Wake up...?

92
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:07,500
You mean not here
but the nurse's office...

93
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:08,666
That's not safe...?

94
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,833
That's a... foxfire

95
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:17,875
Yeah...

96
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,958
It appears to be
sleeping now...

97
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:22,083
You can see how it's been
feeding on the other souls

98
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,750
due to how large
it's grown...

99
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,500
It'll be hatching
any day now.

100
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,208
What?

101
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:28,541
Once it hatches,

102
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:31,333
I don't think we'll
be able to stop it.

103
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:33,750
There's a total of
four foxfires...

104
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,416
One of the foxfires...

105
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,000
is inside the
nurse's office...

106
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:38,041
See it?

107
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:40,375
What?

108
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:42,333
That's why you
need to wake up.

109
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:48,583
It's Yasu and John...

110
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:51,625
Oh no! Don't tell me they're
about to go in there...!

111
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:53,416
I've got to stop them.

112
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,708
I'll be right back okay!

113
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:00,500
Please...

114
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:01,583
Be careful.

115
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:06,916
What's wrong?

116
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,791
What are you doing,
jumping out of bed like that?

117
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,833
-Calm Down.
-Please Ayako...

118
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:17,916
Get to the printing
room on the first floor.

119
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,041
John and Yasu are
about to go in there.

120
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:21,666
One of those things
is waiting for them!

121
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,875
They're in danger!

122
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,416
Please, go.

123
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,833
I don't think I should
leave you alone.

124
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,250
I'll be fine...

125
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,666
Really, Monk taught me
some warding magic called,

126
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,083
the "Immovable One"
or something.

127
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,541
This is a bad idea...

128
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:36,416
Please Mai.

129
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:39,708
Okay...

130
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:42,333
Remember this one too.

131
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:43,666
Rin...

132
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,291
pyo...

133
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:51,750
Toh... Sha... Kai...
Jin... Retsu... Zai... Zen..

134
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,083
There's nine of them.

135
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:54,791
Horizontal first, right?

136
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,958
Yes... Recite them
after you've chanted

137
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:58,666
the Seal of the
Immovable One...

138
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,708
I'll be right back.

139
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:09,916
Man, I hope I
feel better soon.

140
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:17,583
Uh oh...! What did that
girl say happens here again?

141
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,125
On the second
to last bed...

142
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,000
there'll suddenly
be someone in it.

143
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:25,333
There it is.

144
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,916
Oh my god...!

145
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,291
It's okay, Mai.

146
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:38,958
Just stay calm and do
what they told you to.

147
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:41,958
Naumaku san manda
bazaradan kan.

148
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:44,875
Naumaku san manda
bazaradan kan.

149
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:48,500
Naumaku san manda
bazaradan kan.

150
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,875
Rin. Pyo. Toh. Sha...

151
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:00,875
Cold air...

152
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,458
The temperature's dropping.

153
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,083
Where'd it go...?

154
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:13,000
I think now's a
good time to leave.

155
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:24,791
Oh no.

156
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,583
Not again...

157
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:36,416
Why does this kind of
stuff only happen to me...?

158
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,750
Come on Mai.

159
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,458
I need to get out of here.

160
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:43,458
What the heck?
Where's the door?

161
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,666
Where am I?
What happened?!

162
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:50,041
The whole floor collapsed!

163
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:57,708
Is that a mouse?

164
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:01,958
It can't be.

165
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,791
There's no way
those are mice...

166
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,125
They're something else.

167
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,791
Oh no...

168
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,625
If those kids
come back again...

169
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,875
NO!

170
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:23,875
Mai!

171
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,375
Naru!

172
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,750
What the...

173
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,208
What happened here?

174
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:29,666
I don't know.

175
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,750
There was a loud sound and
everything started shaking,

176
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,541
and then the next thing
I knew I was down here.

177
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,958
NARU!

178
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,333
My back feels heavy...

179
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,916
I guess it would, since
the ceiling fell on me.

180
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,583
But why is it so warm?

181
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,208
Mai! Mai!

182
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,416
Can you hear me?

183
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,625
Are you alright?

184
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,875
Answer me!

185
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:14,000
We're fine.

186
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:14,958
Huh?

187
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:27,166
You know you two are lucky
you weren't seriously injured.

188
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,291
I'd expect you to be
more cautious, Naru.

189
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,000
The fact that you're walking
away with only scratches

190
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,375
is a miracle.

191
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,708
This school is in dire
need of major renovation...

192
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:37,083
The ceiling collapsed
because of weak beams...

193
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,000
It's no big deal.

194
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,041
We should probably take
you to a hospital,

195
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,541
just to be on the safe side.

196
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,208
Really, I'm just fine...

197
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:45,625
I'm pretty sure
Naru's back took

198
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,000
most of the brunt anyway.

199
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:53,083
Yeah... If Naru hadn't
protected me ...

200
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,958
Does anyone else think
this is weird...?

201
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:01,416
It would take an incredible
amount of power for a spirit

202
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,750
to make an entire ceiling
collapse like that.

203
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,208
So this spirit
is more powerful

204
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,083
than what you
usually encounter.

205
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,958
But what's more alarming
is its brutality.

206
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,250
It just hatched...

207
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,083
It's been asleep
up to this point...

208
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,291
After it finished
absorbing enough power,

209
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:18,708
it hatched like an egg.

210
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:25,125
If that dream I had
earlier was true...

211
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,583
then ...

212
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,166
Now... No one...

213
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,041
Will be able to stop it.

214
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:42,083
Go home?
Why?

215
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,958
Apparently they decided
it at their meeting.

216
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:45,791
But the investigation's
not over!

217
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,291
How can they
expect us to leave

218
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:48,791
when we haven't
finished our job?

219
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,541
I don't know.

220
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:53,125
The reason the situation
has become this bad

221
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:54,541
is because you and
your team of amateurs

222
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:57,041
have failed to do
what you promised.

223
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:58,875
Our hands are tied
on this one Mai,

224
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:00,875
If the client says go home,
you go home.

225
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:02,500
That's nuts...! Right?

226
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:03,750
Naru?

227
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,041
But... We're...

228
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,333
We're not done.

229
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,875
That horrible foxfire
I saw in my dream...

230
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:16,250
We can't just
leave it here.

231
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,041
Look we can't stop now...!

232
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:20,958
The remaining spirits will
just feed on each other.

233
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,833
They'll keep getting
bigger and more powerful,

234
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,541
until finally,

235
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:27,666
one gigantic and extremely
dangerous spirit will be left.

236
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:32,000
What did you just say?

237
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,458
Huh?

238
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:36,916
They'll feed on each other
until the strongest remains.

239
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,625
Yeah... that's right.

240
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,833
What's... wrong?

241
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:45,375
How can that be?

242
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,166
Is it possible
we're up against...

243
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,750
a kodoku using spirits?

244
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,000
What is that?

245
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,541
A zuzhou hex...

246
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:55,333
A curse that dates back
to ancient China...

247
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:57,583
It's been thought to be
extinct for years now.

248
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,833
Zuzhou normally use
hitogata, talismans

249
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:03,250
and other charms to curse,

250
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,541
but some can use
living creatures.

251
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,625
That, is a kodoku...

252
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:10,291
Usually an insect is used,

253
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:13,333
one known as a
'golden silkworm'...

254
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,666
but exactly what
type of bug that is

255
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,875
still remains a mystery.

256
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,916
Worms and centipedes are
also commonly used...

257
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,333
They take the bugs and
place them inside a pot,

258
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,500
and then bury the
pot in the earth...

259
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:28,083
Several months later
they dig it up...

260
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:31,583
What remains,

261
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:35,000
is a single bug that has
devoured the others.

262
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:38,083
The curse is performed
with this lone survivor.

263
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:40,083
The bug takes
possession of the house

264
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:42,125
owned by the person
being cursed,

265
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,625
and brings in an enormous
amount of wealth.

266
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:46,250
However, in return,

267
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:49,916
a human must be sacrificed
for the curse to continue.

268
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,583
If not, the bug will
devour the homeowner.

269
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:57,125
If one is unable
to feed the bug...

270
00:14:57,208 --> 00:15:00,208
they must exchange all of the
wealth the bug has produced,

271
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:02,375
plus interest,
for gold and silver,

272
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,083
and leave it in the road.

273
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,583
It's called the golden
silkworm transfer.

274
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:07,791
But if it's lying
in the road,

275
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:08,875
then what's stopping someone

276
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:10,708
from just taking
it for themselves?

277
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:12,500
Whoever takes it
would see the money

278
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,333
but never really
know what they have.

279
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:16,250
And then they would
be eaten as well...

280
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,916
Man.

281
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,958
This same idea can also
be used as a death-curse.

282
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:22,708
You perform the
kodoku curse

283
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:25,000
and send the bug along
with some gold and silver

284
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:27,166
to someone you despise...

285
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,791
They don't understand
its meaning,

286
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,875
neglect to feed the bug...

287
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:33,041
And are devoured
in the process.

288
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:35,333
Hold on.

289
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:37,458
The bugs being put in the
pot and eating each other.

290
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:40,208
That's exactly what's
happening at this school!

291
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,666
That's why I believe
it's a kodoku curse.

292
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,416
So instead of
the usual bugs

293
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,083
we have spirits
eating each other.

294
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,916
If they continue doing this
without us stopping them,

295
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,416
and one powerful
spirit remains...

296
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,041
Then...

297
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:56,583
What will happen?

298
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:57,708
I'm not sure...

299
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,416
If someone is doing
this intentionally

300
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,166
in the hopes of
a death-curse...

301
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:04,875
the remaining spirit will be
used to implement the zuzhou.

302
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:07,041
But if this happened
purely by chance,

303
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:10,958
because the school sits in a
spiritually closed-off location,

304
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:13,708
then there's no telling
what could happen.

305
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:16,291
Then... if just one
spirit is remaining,

306
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:17,958
the school it has
taken possession of

307
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,041
will have to feed it,

308
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,041
just like the
homeowner does, right?

309
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:25,041
Like... the way they
feed a human to the bug.

310
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,125
Now hold on!

311
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,083
But that's how it works...

312
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:31,041
If it's not fed, then
the homeowner is eaten.

313
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:32,791
But it's different
in this case.

314
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:33,833
Who would the
homeowner be?

315
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:35,291
Yeah right.

316
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,791
Probably the students
that summoned the spirits.

317
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,875
What? Are you serious...?!

318
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,666
Can we do anything
to avoid that?

319
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,166
I mean... Nobody knew
the consequences

320
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,958
when they first started
Ouija-boarding...

321
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,333
If all the students
were eaten,

322
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:51,666
that would include Yasu too!

323
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,875
Right, Naru?

324
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,708
There's nothing I can do.

325
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:58,958
However...

326
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:01,333
Lin... Your thoughts?

327
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,583
Please Lin.

328
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,041
Kodoku is a
form of cursing

329
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,583
that's considered to be lost
among parapsychologists...

330
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:08,916
In my entire career

331
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,708
I've never even heard of
anyone coming across one.

332
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:14,375
If this kodoku was performed
as part of a zuzhou curse,

333
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:17,208
it'll behave the same
as any other zuzhou.

334
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,458
Breaking the curse would
not be too difficult,

335
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:21,291
but if this is somehow
the product of chance,

336
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,583
then there would be
only two distinct ways

337
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,208
to deal with the problem.

338
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:25,833
Transferring it
to someone...

339
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:27,625
or giving in and feeding it.

340
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,750
-Right.
-You can't!

341
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:32,291
We still don't know
if this is a kodoku.

342
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:35,208
If a zuzhou is being used,
Lin can take care of it...

343
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:37,625
but We should continue
with our investigation

344
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:44,083
Man... I really hope Naru
convinces the Principal

345
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:46,166
to let us stay.

346
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,333
If they boot
us out of here

347
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,458
then the case is
as good as lost...

348
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:52,166
But... Knowing Naru
he'll make it work.

349
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,375
Even though he told us
to keep investigating,

350
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:58,083
I'm not really
sure what to do.

351
00:17:58,166 --> 00:17:59,666
Use your brain for once

352
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,666
Same applies to you...

353
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,708
Wait... I'm sorry I forgot.

354
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:04,791
You don't have a brain.

355
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:10,208
Hey Easy...! My cr1anium
can only take so much abuse!

356
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,583
Oh shut up! You don't even
know what cranium means!

357
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,583
Okay, that's enough.

358
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,625
Please, just get along.

359
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,000
Maybe we should
use this time

360
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,916
to organize the
information we have...

361
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,833
It's gotta be better
than this, right?

362
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,541
Yeah.

363
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,958
To start, orikirisama,

364
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:27,416
which is a form of
Ouija-boarding,

365
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,250
became popular here
at the school

366
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,583
around the end of summer
vacation last year.

367
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:33,333
Immediately following that,

368
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:36,041
the school became inundated with
stories of ghost sightings.

369
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:37,416
Because the school
happens to be

370
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,375
in a spiritually
closed-in location,

371
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:42,250
the spirits that were summoned
here were trapped here.

372
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,166
Those spirits began
feeding on each other,

373
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,958
creating a situation
common to a kodoku curse.

374
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:51,041
It's kind of like a
supernatural sumo match.

375
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,083
You know, the way
they do Orikirisama,

376
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:56,791
with the chant
and everything.

377
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:58,500
It's so different from
the times I played

378
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,000
with a Ouija board.

379
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:01,958
There are many different
styles of doing it,

380
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,500
depending on what
region you're in.

381
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:06,958
Yeah... but even the paper
they're using is weird.

382
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:09,916
It has the alphabet, numbers,
and the yes and no,

383
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,375
so everything is
normal up to that point.

384
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,541
But I thought in order
to be a Ouija board

385
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:17,500
you'd have to draw a torii
arch in the middle.

386
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:20,500
In this version, they have a
squiggly pattern there instead.

387
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:24,291
Plus... they've got the
character for Demon

388
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:25,916
encircling the whole thing.

389
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,375
What?

390
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,708
I'm sorry?

391
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:32,833
What kind of
pattern is it?

392
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:34,375
I'm not sure...

393
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,041
Oh...! Hey, Yasu...

394
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,750
Do you remember?

395
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:41,875
I only did it that one
time but I can try to.

396
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:44,250
You said it was
called orikirisama.

397
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,000
That comes from the
incantation used, right?

398
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:51,916
On orikiritei, meiritei,
meiwayashimarei, sowaka.

399
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,250
That's it!

400
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,625
And then after
you use the paper

401
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,500
you're supposed to
bury it somewhere.

402
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:57,958
Yeah, Exactly.

403
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:00,000
You can only use it once,
and when you're done with it,

404
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:02,208
you have to dispose of it
at a particular shrine.

405
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,083
A shrine.

406
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,541
There wouldn't happen to be a
shrine nearby, would there?

407
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:15,875
A little one, with a small
torii gateway and foxes.

408
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:17,458
It's right down the street.

409
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:29,041
That's crazy.

410
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:30,916
Just like in my dream.

411
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,875
This is where you
bury them, right?

412
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:34,208
It is ...

413
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:36,000
But what does that have
to do with the case?

414
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:38,333
Uh-oh, there's someone here.

415
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:40,916
We're not supposed to let
anyone see us do this right?

416
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,083
I don't believe this.

417
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:44,250
I told them not to
do that anymore.

418
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:45,208
Excuse me.

419
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,333
I need to look at
that piece of paper.

420
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,458
It's fine... You're not
in trouble or anything.

421
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,041
Oh... sure.

422
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,833
I knew it.

423
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,833
What Lin...? Is it bad?

424
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:00,041
To confound a crossroads...

425
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,750
to kill underneath a shrine.

426
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,208
What are you talking about...?

427
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:04,333
What's that mean?

428
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:05,916
This is a talisman.

429
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,041
When one of these is used

430
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,791
and then buried
underneath a shrine...

431
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,625
It curses a
person to death.

432
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:13,916
To... death?

433
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,291
A talisman?

434
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:18,750
Yes.

435
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:19,833
If it's buried at a crossroads,

436
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:21,666
it will confuse a person.

437
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,000
And if it's buried
under a shrine,

438
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,125
it's a death sentence.

439
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:27,208
Someone spread these
talismans around school,

440
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:29,833
falsely claiming they were
harmless Ouija boards.

441
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:31,416
Whoever's
participated in this

442
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,791
has aided in casting
a death curse.

443
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,125
No way!

444
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:36,958
We should consider
ourselves lucky

445
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:39,083
that the person behind
this was an amateur.

446
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:41,250
A professional like me

447
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,083
could easily kill someone
with one of these.

448
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,666
Judging from the evidence
we have thus far

449
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,625
it's obvious we're up
against a kodoku curse.

450
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:51,791
I agree.

451
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:56,000
What will happen once
the kodoku is complete?

452
00:21:56,083 --> 00:22:00,500
The person whose name is written
on the talisman will die.

453
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:01,958
And who would that be?

454
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:03,833
Hideharu... Matsuyama.

455
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:23,208
[Music]

456
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:53,375
Next time on Ghost Hunt,
Forbidden Pastime Part Four!

457
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:54,958
How is this gonna end?!
