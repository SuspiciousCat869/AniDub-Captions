1
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:35,984
I'm Mai Taniyama,

2
00:00:36,067 --> 00:00:37,527
a freshman in high school.

3
00:00:39,738 --> 00:00:42,449
I have what you would
call a weird job.

4
00:00:42,532 --> 00:00:44,743
Wow! What a cool house!

5
00:00:46,327 --> 00:00:49,039
That guy standing next
to me is Kazuya Shibuya .

6
00:00:49,122 --> 00:00:50,290
He's my boss.

7
00:01:04,804 --> 00:01:06,723
I'm sorry to drag you
out here like this.

8
00:01:06,806 --> 00:01:08,475
It's quite a drive
from the city.

9
00:01:08,558 --> 00:01:10,685
This is my
sister-in-law Kana...

10
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:12,812
and my niece Ayami.

11
00:01:12,896 --> 00:01:15,357
My brother is on a business
trip overseas at the moment

12
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,816
so it's just us
three girls

13
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,986
in the house all
by ourselves.

14
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,614
Three days ago, that woman,
Noriko Morishita,

15
00:01:22,697 --> 00:01:24,240
came by the office
I work out of

16
00:01:24,324 --> 00:01:26,159
and hired us to
investigate her home.

17
00:01:29,245 --> 00:01:31,414
There's something
strange about that house.

18
00:01:31,498 --> 00:01:34,209
The furniture will
rattle all by itself...

19
00:01:34,292 --> 00:01:35,794
I'll hear knocking on
the walls of rooms

20
00:01:35,877 --> 00:01:37,504
when I'm the only one home.

21
00:01:37,587 --> 00:01:39,422
And Doors will constantly
open and close

22
00:01:39,506 --> 00:01:42,133
all by themselves.

23
00:01:42,217 --> 00:01:44,386
As you can imagine,
we're pretty frightened.

24
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:46,971
I'd like to have a
word with your boss.

25
00:01:47,055 --> 00:01:50,266
My name is Kazuya Shibuya
and I own the company.

26
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,477
Oh, I had...

27
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,063
It's not uncommon for
people to react like her

28
00:01:55,146 --> 00:01:56,815
when you consider the
lead investigator

29
00:01:56,898 --> 00:01:58,400
is only a teenager.

30
00:01:58,483 --> 00:02:00,235
He's extremely
self-confident,

31
00:02:00,318 --> 00:02:02,445
which lead to the
nickname I thought up.

32
00:02:02,529 --> 00:02:04,447
Naru the Narcissist!

33
00:02:04,531 --> 00:02:05,782
So Anyway...

34
00:02:05,865 --> 00:02:07,409
What are we looking at...?

35
00:02:07,492 --> 00:02:09,536
Do you really believe
we have a ghost?

36
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:13,039
We will explore all options
in our investigation.

37
00:02:13,123 --> 00:02:16,459
I'm happy to say that I'm a
proud member of the team at...

38
00:02:16,543 --> 00:02:18,420
Shibuya Psychic Research.

39
00:02:23,383 --> 00:02:29,139
[Music]

40
00:04:00,021 --> 00:04:01,940
Whenever we do on-site
investigations,

41
00:04:02,023 --> 00:04:04,275
we always set up a base,
or headquarters.

42
00:04:04,359 --> 00:04:06,027
This is the main
room we operate

43
00:04:06,111 --> 00:04:07,946
out of while we
conduct experiments.

44
00:04:08,029 --> 00:04:09,948
How's set up of all
the equipment looking?

45
00:04:11,282 --> 00:04:13,326
All audio and video feeds
are transmitting clearly.

46
00:04:14,994 --> 00:04:16,621
That's Lin,
Naru's assistant.

47
00:04:16,705 --> 00:04:17,831
He's not a big talker

48
00:04:17,914 --> 00:04:19,874
and he's definitely
not a fan of me,

49
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:21,793
so I try to
keep my distance.

50
00:04:21,876 --> 00:04:24,004
I wonder if we're dealing
with a poltergeist.

51
00:04:25,046 --> 00:04:27,632
Judging from
Noriko's description.

52
00:04:27,716 --> 00:04:30,093
Ah, you're sounding less and
less like an amateur each day,

53
00:04:30,176 --> 00:04:32,137
aren't ya kiddo?

54
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,847
Hey Monk!

55
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:34,889
Hey.

56
00:04:34,973 --> 00:04:36,391
That's Hosho Takigawa.

57
00:04:36,474 --> 00:04:37,934
He's a monk from Mt. Koya.

58
00:04:38,018 --> 00:04:39,436
I see you're
overdoing it again

59
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:40,937
with all this
fancy equipment.

60
00:04:41,021 --> 00:04:42,647
And that's Ayako Matsuzaki,

61
00:04:42,731 --> 00:04:44,566
a self-styled shrine maiden.

62
00:04:45,316 --> 00:04:47,193
Neither of them are
members of SPR,

63
00:04:47,277 --> 00:04:48,445
but they'll help us on jobs

64
00:04:48,528 --> 00:04:49,654
when their specific
skills are needed.

65
00:04:49,738 --> 00:04:52,407
Let me see.

66
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:55,035
Clearly the work
of an earth spirit.

67
00:04:55,118 --> 00:04:56,202
It's defiantly a human.

68
00:04:56,286 --> 00:04:58,288
The evidence
speaks for itself.

69
00:04:58,371 --> 00:05:00,498
Well listen to you.

70
00:05:00,582 --> 00:05:02,083
Now Don't forget.

71
00:05:02,167 --> 00:05:04,044
Nearly half of all
poltergeist cases

72
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:06,171
can be attributed to
human interaction...

73
00:05:06,254 --> 00:05:07,756
Many of those cases
deal with women

74
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:09,466
under great deals of stress.

75
00:05:09,549 --> 00:05:10,800
This case in particular

76
00:05:10,884 --> 00:05:12,635
may have to do with the
woman of the house

77
00:05:12,719 --> 00:05:14,512
not getting along with
her sister-in-law.

78
00:05:14,596 --> 00:05:15,597
Like Noriko?

79
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,057
I'd buy it...

80
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,976
That Kana woman does seem
to be a bit unpleasant.

81
00:05:20,977 --> 00:05:21,978
You're welcome.

82
00:05:22,062 --> 00:05:24,439
It's amateurish at best.

83
00:05:24,522 --> 00:05:27,108
In cases where a human is
to blame for a poltergeist,

84
00:05:27,192 --> 00:05:28,985
the culprit is
usually a teenager...

85
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:31,446
or adolescent child.

86
00:05:31,529 --> 00:05:33,823
Noriko is already
in her twenties.

87
00:05:33,907 --> 00:05:36,076
So she doesn't meet
the age requirements.

88
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:38,119
But...! Now it is true that
there are cases of women

89
00:05:38,203 --> 00:05:39,871
who are sensitive
to the paranormal,

90
00:05:39,954 --> 00:05:42,916
so I will consider that
in my final decision.

91
00:05:42,999 --> 00:05:44,417
Why you...

92
00:05:44,501 --> 00:05:46,795
Excuse me! I'm still
learning my way, got it?!

93
00:05:47,587 --> 00:05:50,423
Why does my boss have to be
such a jerk all the time?

94
00:05:50,507 --> 00:05:51,549
Hi there Mai...

95
00:05:51,633 --> 00:05:53,009
Perfect timing...

96
00:05:53,093 --> 00:05:54,969
I'm taking up some
lunch to Ayami...

97
00:05:55,053 --> 00:05:56,346
Would you Care to join me?

98
00:05:56,429 --> 00:05:58,640
Oh That sounds great!

99
00:05:58,723 --> 00:06:00,475
Ayami is such a cutie-pie.

100
00:06:00,558 --> 00:06:01,768
If you had to say,

101
00:06:01,851 --> 00:06:03,978
does she take more after
her father or her mother?

102
00:06:04,062 --> 00:06:06,356
Hmm. Probably her mother.

103
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:09,275
Really? Because she doesn't
look like Kana at all.

104
00:06:09,359 --> 00:06:12,570
Well that's because Kana
isn't Ayami's birth mother.

105
00:06:12,654 --> 00:06:14,614
My brother had her
with his previous wife.

106
00:06:14,698 --> 00:06:16,282
Oh I'm sorry.

107
00:06:16,366 --> 00:06:17,325
Don't worry about it.

108
00:06:20,453 --> 00:06:22,539
Ayami...? Lunch time...

109
00:06:22,622 --> 00:06:24,040
Mai's here too.

110
00:06:24,124 --> 00:06:25,542
Hey Ayami...

111
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:26,960
Hope you're hungry!

112
00:06:31,881 --> 00:06:33,675
She's so cute!

113
00:06:36,636 --> 00:06:38,346
Nice to meet you.

114
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,973
Oh, hello...

115
00:06:40,056 --> 00:06:42,642
And you're...?

116
00:06:42,726 --> 00:06:43,935
Minnie.

117
00:06:46,438 --> 00:06:47,689
Ayami...

118
00:06:47,772 --> 00:06:50,025
Your new book...
are you enjoying it?

119
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,863
What's wrong?

120
00:06:54,946 --> 00:06:56,364
Why don't you have
some food... 'kay?

121
00:06:57,699 --> 00:06:59,325
I'm not hungry.

122
00:07:01,745 --> 00:07:04,289
I wonder what came
over her so suddenly.

123
00:07:16,676 --> 00:07:18,636
Focus your eyes
on the light.

124
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:23,308
Naru's first experiment

125
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:26,102
was to see if the source of the
poltergeist was human or not

126
00:07:26,186 --> 00:07:29,522
by using this
glowing red light.

127
00:07:29,606 --> 00:07:32,901
Try to match your breathing
to the glow of the light...

128
00:07:32,984 --> 00:07:35,195
Nice and slow.

129
00:07:38,573 --> 00:07:41,618
It's said that in the case of
people causing a poltergeist

130
00:07:41,701 --> 00:07:43,453
they use a
supernatural ability

131
00:07:43,536 --> 00:07:45,205
they're unaware
of possessing...

132
00:07:46,664 --> 00:07:47,832
So when a suggestion

133
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:50,794
is planted into
the sub-conscious.

134
00:07:50,877 --> 00:07:53,213
Tonight, a vase will move.

135
00:07:53,296 --> 00:07:56,341
A small glass
vase to be exact.

136
00:07:56,424 --> 00:07:58,009
It will be sitting
on the table

137
00:07:58,093 --> 00:08:00,845
that's in front
of you now.

138
00:08:00,929 --> 00:08:04,182
If the person who receives
the suggestion is the culprit,

139
00:08:04,265 --> 00:08:06,142
they will do what
Naru has told them.

140
00:08:09,396 --> 00:08:10,563
That'll be all.

141
00:08:10,647 --> 00:08:11,940
Please try to spend the
rest of your evening

142
00:08:12,023 --> 00:08:13,817
as you would any
normal night.

143
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,568
Kana, the key?

144
00:08:15,652 --> 00:08:17,028
Oh, right.

145
00:08:21,741 --> 00:08:23,660
The suggestion worked.

146
00:08:23,743 --> 00:08:24,828
As you can see,

147
00:08:24,911 --> 00:08:27,122
everyone's eyes were
focused on the vase.

148
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,713
So if a human is the cause

149
00:08:34,796 --> 00:08:36,631
of the poltergeists
in this house,

150
00:08:36,715 --> 00:08:38,550
the vase will move.

151
00:08:38,633 --> 00:08:41,803
And if it doesn't move,
then the cause is unknown.

152
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,439
Any movement?

153
00:08:52,522 --> 00:08:53,314
Not yet.

154
00:08:59,738 --> 00:09:00,822
Come quickly!

155
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,203
I came up here to
put Ayami to bed

156
00:09:07,287 --> 00:09:09,622
when I found all the
furniture like this.

157
00:09:09,706 --> 00:09:11,583
Everything is moved
away from the walls.

158
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:13,335
What's going on...?

159
00:09:13,418 --> 00:09:14,836
I thought you people were
supposed to stop things

160
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:17,172
like this from happening!

161
00:09:17,255 --> 00:09:19,799
Are you sure the little
girl didn't do this?

162
00:09:24,054 --> 00:09:25,680
There's no way
she's that strong!

163
00:09:25,764 --> 00:09:26,806
You're right...

164
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,224
The rug was moved as well.

165
00:09:28,308 --> 00:09:30,393
Even I don't have
that kind of strength.

166
00:09:30,477 --> 00:09:32,437
I agree...

167
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,814
If there is a human
capable of this...

168
00:09:34,898 --> 00:09:36,524
I'd love to meet him.

169
00:09:36,608 --> 00:09:38,693
I was merely throwing
the option out there.

170
00:09:38,777 --> 00:09:40,653
It wasn't Ayami.

171
00:09:40,737 --> 00:09:42,238
Aww... We believe you.

172
00:09:44,657 --> 00:09:45,533
What's wrong?

173
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,208
This time everything
was upside down!

174
00:09:54,793 --> 00:09:57,003
Even the carpet's
been flipped over.

175
00:09:57,087 --> 00:09:59,214
Classic poltergeist
activity.

176
00:09:59,297 --> 00:10:00,840
It's A simple
earth spirit...

177
00:10:00,924 --> 00:10:03,301
I'll have it driven out of this
house by tomorrow morning...

178
00:10:03,385 --> 00:10:05,845
You'll see. Night everyone.

179
00:10:05,929 --> 00:10:07,972
Where does she get
her confidence?

180
00:10:08,056 --> 00:10:09,474
What's up Naru?

181
00:10:09,557 --> 00:10:10,975
You look like you're
on to something.

182
00:10:11,059 --> 00:10:13,103
Care to share with
the rest of us?

183
00:10:13,186 --> 00:10:15,563
Don't you think this
response is a little quick...?

184
00:10:15,647 --> 00:10:19,317
Paranormal phenomena tend to
have an aversion to outsiders...

185
00:10:19,401 --> 00:10:21,486
Usually any signs of
a haunting back off

186
00:10:21,569 --> 00:10:23,655
in the first twenty four
hours of an investigation.

187
00:10:23,738 --> 00:10:25,115
Really?

188
00:10:25,198 --> 00:10:26,658
If you ever watch
those tv shows

189
00:10:26,741 --> 00:10:28,201
that cover famous
haunted houses,

190
00:10:28,284 --> 00:10:31,246
usually nothing substantial
ever happens on camera, right?

191
00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:32,789
Normally the spirits
will shy away

192
00:10:32,872 --> 00:10:34,249
from the visitor initially,

193
00:10:34,332 --> 00:10:35,709
but that's not
the case here.

194
00:10:35,792 --> 00:10:37,836
I think this is
full on... Hatred.

195
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:39,587
You thinking the
same thing I am?

196
00:10:39,671 --> 00:10:40,880
Yeah...

197
00:10:40,964 --> 00:10:42,632
The house is aware
of our presence,

198
00:10:42,716 --> 00:10:44,592
and it's quickly
becoming angry with us,

199
00:10:44,676 --> 00:10:46,136
so... if you couple that

200
00:10:46,219 --> 00:10:48,555
with these increasingly brazen
attempts to scare us off...

201
00:10:48,638 --> 00:10:51,975
We're dealing with a poltergeist
that means business.

202
00:10:52,058 --> 00:10:53,810
We may have a hard
time with this one.

203
00:10:58,481 --> 00:11:00,984
Naru declared that Ayami's
bedroom and the living room

204
00:11:01,067 --> 00:11:02,652
were now off-limits
to everyone

205
00:11:02,736 --> 00:11:05,697
until the completion
of the investigation.

206
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:08,825
Ayami was to stay in Noriko's
room from here on out.

207
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,002
The next morning, the
vase in the family room

208
00:11:19,085 --> 00:11:21,087
had not moved an inch
from the night before.

209
00:11:22,922 --> 00:11:26,092
Does that mean an actual
spirit is haunting this house?

210
00:11:28,636 --> 00:11:31,306
I stand here today to
beseech the gods...

211
00:11:31,389 --> 00:11:34,351
I call upon them to descend
from the heavens and join us

212
00:11:34,434 --> 00:11:39,022
where no gods dwell to end
this ceaseless suffering.

213
00:11:39,105 --> 00:11:41,691
I ask that my humble
plea may be heard

214
00:11:41,775 --> 00:11:44,235
to reclaim peace
unto the spirits

215
00:11:44,319 --> 00:11:46,196
trapped in this
haunted place.

216
00:11:47,989 --> 00:11:49,282
Well... That should do it...

217
00:11:49,366 --> 00:11:51,284
Sometimes I amaze
even myself.

218
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,123
Naru. Here's the
temperature rundown

219
00:11:57,207 --> 00:11:59,542
for every room in the house.

220
00:11:59,626 --> 00:12:02,212
Ayami's room is a few
degrees cooler than the rest.

221
00:12:04,464 --> 00:12:06,508
Naru taught me that
whenever a spirit is present

222
00:12:06,591 --> 00:12:08,009
the temperature drops.

223
00:12:10,261 --> 00:12:12,764
The house itself looks to
be structurally sound...

224
00:12:12,847 --> 00:12:14,140
all the floors are flat...

225
00:12:14,224 --> 00:12:16,393
There's no sign of
subterranean water loss

226
00:12:16,476 --> 00:12:18,561
so the ground is solid.

227
00:12:18,645 --> 00:12:22,107
Do you think that there
really is a... ghost.

228
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:25,360
The chances of that
are increasing.

229
00:12:25,443 --> 00:12:26,486
Seriously?

230
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:29,114
What the...

231
00:12:33,493 --> 00:12:35,412
Kana!

232
00:12:35,495 --> 00:12:36,996
The flames just started
shooting out of nowhere!

233
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,206
Just Get back...

234
00:12:38,289 --> 00:12:39,290
Takigawa!

235
00:13:02,313 --> 00:13:04,232
Naru...! Someone's out there!

236
00:13:07,777 --> 00:13:09,154
Are you sure?

237
00:13:09,237 --> 00:13:11,698
Yes...! Someone was looking
through the window!

238
00:13:11,781 --> 00:13:12,824
A little kid.

239
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,715
Okay Minnie,

240
00:13:28,798 --> 00:13:30,508
time for me to tuck you in.

241
00:13:39,726 --> 00:13:40,810
Sweetie?

242
00:13:43,104 --> 00:13:44,064
Ayami.

243
00:13:44,147 --> 00:13:46,107
Were you just outside?

244
00:13:46,191 --> 00:13:49,277
No. Mai saw someone looking
through the kitchen window...

245
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:50,403
Now I'm not angry,

246
00:13:50,487 --> 00:13:52,113
I just want to know
if it was you.

247
00:13:52,197 --> 00:13:53,573
I wasn't.

248
00:13:53,656 --> 00:13:55,784
Are you telling the truth?

249
00:13:55,867 --> 00:13:57,202
I am...

250
00:13:57,285 --> 00:13:58,953
Ayami didn't do it!

251
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,623
What's happening?

252
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,585
Ayami didn't do it.

253
00:14:07,545 --> 00:14:09,464
Stop it!!

254
00:14:09,547 --> 00:14:10,632
Noriko!

255
00:14:14,427 --> 00:14:15,470
Aunt Nori!

256
00:14:15,553 --> 00:14:16,638
Oh no!

257
00:14:28,775 --> 00:14:29,734
So what is that...?

258
00:14:29,818 --> 00:14:31,903
Two huge failures
in a row?

259
00:14:31,986 --> 00:14:34,364
I guess I'm just a useless
waste of space then.

260
00:14:35,657 --> 00:14:38,618
Luckily, Noriko wasn't
hurt in the incident.

261
00:14:38,702 --> 00:14:40,829
So yesterday...

262
00:14:40,912 --> 00:14:42,205
What was that?

263
00:14:42,288 --> 00:14:45,709
It seemed to react to
the little girl shouting.

264
00:14:45,792 --> 00:14:47,711
And it could be tied to
the image of the child

265
00:14:47,794 --> 00:14:49,254
you mentioned seeing
in the kitchen.

266
00:14:49,337 --> 00:14:51,423
I believe that
Ayami's behind this.

267
00:14:51,506 --> 00:14:53,091
I thought the
suggestion experiment

268
00:14:53,174 --> 00:14:55,468
you conducted proved the
culprit wasn't human...

269
00:14:55,552 --> 00:14:58,221
How much confidence do you
put in that test of yours?

270
00:14:58,304 --> 00:15:00,306
One hundred percent.

271
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,600
Is it possible the
suggestion failed?

272
00:15:02,684 --> 00:15:03,852
There's no way.

273
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,520
You know you've
been wrong before.

274
00:15:05,603 --> 00:15:08,231
Kazuya.

275
00:15:08,314 --> 00:15:10,650
The temperature in Ayami's
room is dropping again.

276
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:14,195
Lin... More sound.

277
00:15:18,575 --> 00:15:20,035
That is intense.

278
00:15:28,418 --> 00:15:30,378
There isn't even
anyone in that room.

279
00:15:31,504 --> 00:15:32,339
Incredible.

280
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,467
What's that?

281
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,760
The temperature.

282
00:15:36,843 --> 00:15:38,762
It's dropping
unbelievably fast...

283
00:15:44,309 --> 00:15:45,518
Hold on... Then...

284
00:15:45,602 --> 00:15:48,688
Then who could be responsible
for doing this?

285
00:15:48,772 --> 00:15:50,815
It's not Ayami,
that's for sure...

286
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:51,983
No...

287
00:15:52,067 --> 00:15:54,027
No human could
pull this off.

288
00:15:59,074 --> 00:16:01,659
I take it Ayami likes
to keep to herself, huh?

289
00:16:01,743 --> 00:16:03,995
Well normally she's a lot
more outgoing and cheerful

290
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,747
than how you've
been seeing her...

291
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,082
She's been acting strange

292
00:16:07,165 --> 00:16:09,501
ever since her dad got
remarried a few weeks ago.

293
00:16:09,584 --> 00:16:10,418
I see.

294
00:16:13,922 --> 00:16:15,799
Ayami. It's time
for your snack.

295
00:16:19,302 --> 00:16:21,471
It's nice to have
someone to play with...

296
00:16:21,554 --> 00:16:22,764
Don't you think so?

297
00:16:25,183 --> 00:16:27,018
I really wish you would
talk to me more...

298
00:16:27,102 --> 00:16:28,436
Why don't you
have a cookie.

299
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,065
Don't you want one?

300
00:16:37,362 --> 00:16:39,072
Fine.

301
00:16:39,155 --> 00:16:40,365
Suit yourself.

302
00:16:45,787 --> 00:16:47,414
It's okay sweetie.

303
00:16:48,623 --> 00:16:51,376
Is it alright with you if your
Aunt Noriko had a cookie?

304
00:16:51,459 --> 00:16:52,419
No!

305
00:16:54,504 --> 00:16:56,131
Those cookies are no good!

306
00:16:57,716 --> 00:16:59,467
Minnie told me so.

307
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:02,345
She said all the
snacks are poisoned!

308
00:17:02,429 --> 00:17:05,015
Minnie told me my
new mom is a witch...

309
00:17:05,098 --> 00:17:07,600
She said she made Dad her
servant with her magic...

310
00:17:07,684 --> 00:17:09,811
She said Ayami and
Aunt Nori are in the way

311
00:17:09,894 --> 00:17:11,479
so she's trying
to poison us.

312
00:17:12,856 --> 00:17:14,482
This is getting weirder.

313
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,572
The doll told her all that?

314
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:33,585
Where am I...?

315
00:17:37,255 --> 00:17:40,425
Oh this is Noriko's
guest room...

316
00:17:42,302 --> 00:17:45,055
I was so tired I don't
even remember going to bed.

317
00:17:53,521 --> 00:17:55,690
Naru?

318
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:57,317
What...? What's wrong?

319
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:01,571
What?

320
00:18:01,654 --> 00:18:03,031
Naru?

321
00:18:06,826 --> 00:18:09,579
Ayami's in grave danger.

322
00:18:09,662 --> 00:18:12,499
She... She is...?

323
00:18:12,582 --> 00:18:14,042
I don't understand.

324
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,168
How?

325
00:18:15,251 --> 00:18:17,253
How is she in danger?

326
00:18:17,337 --> 00:18:19,506
Naru...! What's going on...?

327
00:18:19,589 --> 00:18:21,216
Please... Talk to me...

328
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:22,592
Is Ayami okay?

329
00:18:37,399 --> 00:18:38,483
That was weird.

330
00:18:41,903 --> 00:18:43,905
I don't believe myself!

331
00:18:43,988 --> 00:18:46,533
Here I am dreaming
about Naru again...!

332
00:18:46,616 --> 00:18:48,159
What's wrong with me?

333
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,204
Oh yeah... I forgot.

334
00:18:53,707 --> 00:18:56,042
Minnie's the one that
told her that...?

335
00:18:56,126 --> 00:18:57,794
So she's talking
with the doll?

336
00:18:57,877 --> 00:18:58,795
Yeah.

337
00:18:58,878 --> 00:19:00,046
Pretty creepy, huh?

338
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,843
It was definitely a dream.

339
00:19:04,926 --> 00:19:07,595
The only time I see him
smile is in my imagination.

340
00:19:08,972 --> 00:19:11,057
This is Ayami's doll, Minnie.

341
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:14,644
My brother bought it
for her as a present

342
00:19:14,728 --> 00:19:17,022
right before they moved
into the house with me.

343
00:19:22,569 --> 00:19:25,113
Did Ayami's behavior change
before she got the doll...?

344
00:19:25,196 --> 00:19:27,073
Or after?

345
00:19:27,157 --> 00:19:29,159
Umm, it was after.

346
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:34,205
Let go of her!

347
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:37,751
I'll save you Minnie!

348
00:19:37,834 --> 00:19:39,919
Give her back!

349
00:19:40,003 --> 00:19:41,379
Now Ayami...

350
00:19:41,463 --> 00:19:43,798
I understand that you're
able to talk to Minnie.

351
00:19:51,973 --> 00:19:54,309
Don't you ever
touch her again!

352
00:19:54,392 --> 00:19:55,685
Ayami!

353
00:20:28,968 --> 00:20:31,262
Ayami... I'm sorry...

354
00:20:31,346 --> 00:20:33,390
I just need to borrow
Minnie for a little bit.

355
00:20:57,455 --> 00:20:59,207
So that's Minnie, huh...?

356
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:01,876
I'm surprised the little
squirt let you take her.

357
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,253
Yeah, Well to be honest

358
00:21:03,336 --> 00:21:05,213
we didn't get actually
get her permission.

359
00:21:07,298 --> 00:21:09,426
She sure is creepy
looking, isn't she?

360
00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:11,052
I guess.

361
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:12,470
Archaeologists believe that

362
00:21:12,554 --> 00:21:14,014
dolls were originally
meant as vessels

363
00:21:14,097 --> 00:21:16,099
for trapping
people's souls...

364
00:21:16,182 --> 00:21:18,059
Being soulless and
empty on the inside,

365
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:20,687
a spirit could posses
them more easily.

366
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:23,231
So Naru, are we just gonna
watch this doll all night?

367
00:21:24,774 --> 00:21:26,067
Hey... What's up?

368
00:21:33,658 --> 00:21:34,826
Minnie.

369
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:38,079
No way... She was sitting
just a minute ago!

370
00:22:34,469 --> 00:22:40,225
[Music]

371
00:24:06,728 --> 00:24:08,855
Next time we continue
with part two of

372
00:24:08,938 --> 00:24:10,148
"the Doll House!"

373
00:24:10,231 --> 00:24:12,192
Is that not the
creepiest doll ever?
