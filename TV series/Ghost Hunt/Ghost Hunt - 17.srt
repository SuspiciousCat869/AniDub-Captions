1
00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:10,875
I was attacked
by evil spirits.

2
00:00:10,958 --> 00:00:12,500
Luckily, when I came to,

3
00:00:12,583 --> 00:00:13,708
I was surrounded
by my friends,

4
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:15,166
which was a huge relief.

5
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,500
But the nurse's office
wasn't safe either.

6
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:19,375
Naru!

7
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:22,291
The ceiling collapsed and
I was nearly killed...!

8
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:25,125
After that, Naru
realized something.

9
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:26,541
How can that be?

10
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:28,708
Is it possible
we're up against...

11
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:30,750
a kodoku using spirits?

12
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:32,375
The hauntings
plaguing the school

13
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:35,458
are being caused by an obscure
form of cursing called kodoku,

14
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:37,541
and the papers used
for orikirisama

15
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:39,083
are the talismans for it.

16
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:41,208
Someone spread these
talismans around school,

17
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,875
falsely claiming they were
harmless Ouija boards.

18
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:45,458
Whoever's participated in this

19
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:48,000
has aided in casting
a death curse.

20
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:50,500
What will happen once
the kodoku is complete?

21
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:52,916
The person whose name is written
on the talisman will die.

22
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,708
And who would that be?

23
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:57,541
Hideharu... Matsuyama.

24
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:08,083
[Music]

25
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:44,375
Matsuyama?

26
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:45,875
Wait...

27
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,708
You don't mean that teacher
who's been bugging us...

28
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:48,750
Do you?

29
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:52,708
It's him!

30
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:54,166
You were asked to leave

31
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,041
but it doesn't look
like you're packing up.

32
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:58,875
Are you coming up with more
bogus ghost stories to tell?

33
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:00,375
I think it would be in
your best interest

34
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:03,041
if you didn't hear
our discussion.

35
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:04,125
Are you trying to plan

36
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:06,041
how to justify your
fee or something?

37
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,125
It's about time you
cut your losses, son...

38
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:14,875
We know you're a fraud...

39
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:16,041
What is that?

40
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:17,541
Sir, were you aware

41
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:19,666
that Ouija-boarding has become
popular among the students

42
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,916
at this school?

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,166
What, you mean
that stupid game?

44
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,250
This is the board used for
what's called orikirisama...

45
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,291
Someone has been spreading
these around school

46
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,000
without realizing the
dangerous implications.

47
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,833
Why are you
telling me this?

48
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:36,416
These talismans are used solely
for performing a deathcurse.

49
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,791
Deathcurse...?

50
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,500
That's ridiculous...

51
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:43,666
You expect me to believe a piece
of paper could kill someone?

52
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,000
who do you think this
silly "deathcurse" is for?

53
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,000
You. And it's very real.

54
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:53,416
-Isn't that right, Lin?
-Yes.

55
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,958
Hey...! That's not
something you joke about!

56
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:58,625
Takigawa. Are you able
to read Sanskrit?

57
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:01,416
Mmm... yeah more or less.

58
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,875
Look at the talisman.

59
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:04,083
The name written
on the right side

60
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:07,333
is the person being cursed.

61
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:09,291
Let's see here...

62
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:13,250
That can only be read
as Hideharu Matsuyama.

63
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,875
It doesn't have to necessarily
be written in Sanskrit.

64
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:17,750
In fact, on the left
side of the talisman

65
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,916
the age of the cursed
is in Kanji...

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,041
Would you mind
reading that Naru?

67
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,791
When it comes to Kanji
I'm pretty clueless.

68
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:27,208
It says Tosai Goju-san,

69
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:29,916
which translates into
fifty-three years old this year.

70
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,833
If I were to guess I'd
say he's around that age.

71
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:35,916
Writing out the kanji in this
way is more of a formality...

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,916
However...

73
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,750
If Matsuyama was
written normally,

74
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,708
anyone could be the suspect.

75
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:41,708
That's why they went
through the trouble

76
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:43,416
of writing in Sanskrit.

77
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,583
But... who the hell
would do this?

78
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,916
The person who made
orikirisama so popular

79
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
was a freshman in
the art club...

80
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:51,458
This is an advanced
form of cursing

81
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,333
that no ordinary student could
easily come up with...

82
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:55,583
It would have to be someone

83
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:58,166
who had done extensive
research on the subject.

84
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,458
Damn Sakauchi...!

85
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,541
It was him...! That punk...

86
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,500
How could he do something
like this...?

87
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:04,875
And why did he choose me?

88
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:08,916
Sakauchi.

89
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,208
Mr. Matsuyama.

90
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:14,666
Forgive me, but would you
like to know the reason

91
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,500
why Sakauchi chose you?

92
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:17,833
Why?

93
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,500
Because of how you
treated him ...

94
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:23,500
His suicide note simply said,
"I'm not a dog"

95
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:26,416
We were all aware that the
school was trying to control us,

96
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,041
as if we were dogs.

97
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,416
And if you would ask
any of the students

98
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,416
who personified this
type of treatment,

99
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,250
they'd name you.

100
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,750
And I would agree with
them wholeheartedly.

101
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:38,333
Sakauchi.

102
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:40,750
I thought I told you not to
bring these books to class.

103
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:43,625
If you allow your mind to
be warped with this crap

104
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:44,916
you'll never
amount to anything!

105
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,958
Maybe you should try
reading one of your textbooks

106
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:50,750
before you waste
your time with this.

107
00:05:58,833 --> 00:05:59,875
The identity of the culprit

108
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:02,041
is of little use to
us at this point.

109
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:04,791
The die has already
been cast again you...

110
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:07,291
Not even the originator of
the curse could stop it now.

111
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,875
Well , what can you do?

112
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,500
Do we have a solution?

113
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,750
Nothing yet.

114
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,750
You could reverse
the zuzhou, right?

115
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,166
I could do that...

116
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,083
but are you certain
you would want to?

117
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,125
We don't have much
choice, do we...?

118
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:23,708
I doubt many people would
mourn him if he died,

119
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,208
but we can't stand idly by

120
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:27,625
when he knows it's
going to happen.

121
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:29,125
Reverse the zuzhou.

122
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,333
You're going
through with it?

123
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:32,125
We'll be turning the
zuzhou curse back

124
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,833
on the person who started it.

125
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:35,416
We have very little time

126
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,625
before the last few spirits
finish consuming each other

127
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,041
and complete the zuzhou.

128
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,250
Once that occurs,

129
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:43,875
death is all that will
await Mr. Matsuyama.

130
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:47,375
most likely in a very
painful, brutal way.

131
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:49,041
But before that happens...

132
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,291
I'll be spared, won't I?

133
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,125
I didn't do anything...

134
00:06:58,208 --> 00:06:59,708
Why should I be
the one to die?

135
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:01,625
I'm innocent!

136
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:03,333
What a horrible person.

137
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,083
Sir.

138
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,791
Need I remind you that you
were the cause of this...?

139
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,041
Don't forget that.

140
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:12,083
Wait a minute Naru...

141
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:14,375
Sakauchi isn't even
alive anymore...

142
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:17,541
Can you even reverse a
zuzhou onto a dead person?

143
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:20,333
Turning a zuzhou back on the
deceased is impossible,

144
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:21,416
but that's irrelevant

145
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,958
since he isn't the
one responsible

146
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,041
for the zuzhou in
the first place.

147
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,333
When you reverse a zuzhou,

148
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:29,041
it returns to
whoever cast it...

149
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:31,375
Although they weren't aware
of the consequences...

150
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:34,458
The students are responsible
for starting the zuzhou.

151
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:35,625
But...

152
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:36,958
what will happen to them?

153
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,958
If the students
cast the spell...

154
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:47,125
and the zuzhou is returned
to whoever started it...

155
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:50,583
Those foxfires will
attack the students!

156
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:52,041
You can't do it, Naru!

157
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,833
There's gotta
be a better way!

158
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:57,000
So you'd rather us
ignore Matsuyama's death?

159
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,625
Failure to realize
the end result

160
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,458
is no excuse for
the students.

161
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,666
Even if they aren't
punished by the law...

162
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:06,166
if Matsuyama dies they'll
be accessories to murder.

163
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,208
The curse will return
to the students...

164
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,125
This man, who
caused all this,

165
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:13,125
will repent his sins
in one way or another.

166
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:14,541
That sounds like a
fair solution to me.

167
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,375
Naru... no!

168
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:17,750
Mr. Shibuya.

169
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,166
What will happen
to us students

170
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,666
once the zuzhou is
returned back to us?

171
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,708
Since there are such a large
number of people who cast it,

172
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:27,333
the power should be divided
evenly amongst everyone,

173
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:28,958
weakening its effects.

174
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,250
At least, that's what
I hope will happen.

175
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:32,791
Naru!

176
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,875
We came to you to
resolve this matter

177
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,208
If there's really no other
way to finish this...

178
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:38,833
There isn't.

179
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:41,125
Then you have our
permission to move forward.

180
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:43,583
So Mr. Matsuyama gets
off totally unharmed,

181
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:46,166
but all of the students could
get hurt or even killed?

182
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,250
How come he's the only
one that's safe...?

183
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,166
That's not fair at all!

184
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,500
Murder is never an
option in our society,

185
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:54,583
no matter how a person
conducts themselves

186
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:57,416
But the possible death
of hundreds is okay?

187
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,208
I think it's reasonable
for everyone

188
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:02,625
to bear the responsibility
of their own actions.

189
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,208
But they...

190
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,291
they didn't know
what they were doing.

191
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:08,208
Ignorance is
hardly an excuse.

192
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:15,625
I hate you, Naru,
do you hear me?

193
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:18,250
You're a terrible person!

194
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:19,375
Lin...

195
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,125
Let's get ready to move.

196
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:22,041
Right.

197
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:35,000
Look Mai...

198
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:37,416
I know...

199
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,541
I know Naru is right...

200
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,166
But still...

201
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,583
I can't always just
do whatever he says,

202
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:47,125
and I could care less if he
doesn't like me for it,

203
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:48,625
but it's not right...

204
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,250
It's just not right.

205
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:51,750
Our hands are tied Mai...

206
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,166
It's a tough
pill to swallow

207
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,666
but there's nothing
else we can do.

208
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:00,833
I'm stopping him.

209
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:01,875
What?

210
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:06,875
I have to, He's making
a terrible mistake.

211
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:08,708
Mai, wait. How are
you gonna do that?

212
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:09,875
Mai!

213
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:14,125
Maybe what Naru said about
the students is right.

214
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:15,916
But no one hated
Matsuyama so much

215
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,916
that they wanted
to see him dead.

216
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,666
It's reasonable
for everyone

217
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,916
to bear the responsibility
of their actions.

218
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,166
How can he turn the zuzhou
back on the students

219
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,708
when he's fully aware of how
painful it will be for them?

220
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,500
Is that his
idea of justice?

221
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,375
Either way, there's got
be something else

222
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,000
that we can do to
stop this curse!

223
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:37,541
Oh no! Lin's car is gone!

224
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:40,958
Where did they go?

225
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:49,833
Why can't I find them...?

226
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,958
They never went
back to base.

227
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:57,791
They're not at the
office either...

228
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:00,166
This is so frustrating...

229
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,625
While they're getting
ready to hurt those kids,

230
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:04,416
all I can do is
just sit here.

231
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:13,583
Wait a minute.

232
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,291
It's time I did something.

233
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,416
I'll exorcise the spirits
before they get back.

234
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,541
There's nothing in here.

235
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:39,083
It still has that
terrible smell.

236
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,041
Water.

237
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:03,416
I don't know if my weak magic
skills will have any effect,

238
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,916
but here goes...

239
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,958
Naumaku san manda
bazaradan kan...

240
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:11,791
Naumaku san manda
bazaradan kan.

241
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:14,916
Naumaku san manda
bazaradan kan...

242
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Naumaku san manda
bazaradan kan...

243
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:20,750
Naumaku san manda
bazaradan kan.

244
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:23,458
Naumaku san manda
bazaradan kan...

245
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:27,083
Rin... Pyo... Toh... Sha... Ka.

246
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:31,125
Stay strong.

247
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:36,541
Kai... Jin... Retsu...
Zai... Zen! Begone!

248
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,250
This isn't water...

249
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,583
It's... blood!

250
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,958
Naumaku san manda
bazaradan kan...

251
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,750
Naumaku san manda
bazaradan kan...

252
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,916
Naumaku san manda
bazaradan kan.

253
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,333
Naumaku san manda
bazaradan kan...

254
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:07,583
Get away from me...!

255
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:10,375
Stay back!

256
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:14,125
No!

257
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:15,500
This is it!

258
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,000
I'm done for.

259
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:19,083
I knew I wasn't
strong enough...!

260
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:24,458
On kirikiri bazara!

261
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:28,250
Monk?!...!

262
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,666
So those were his
hands that grabbed me.

263
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,416
Bajiri hora
manda manda un...

264
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,333
Hatta!

265
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:36,250
Mai, Run!

266
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,666
You idiot!

267
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,083
Did you really think you
had a chance against them?

268
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:47,083
You just learned
magic the other day!

269
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:48,208
I know.

270
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:49,625
If I hadn't of been
there to save you,

271
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:51,583
you could have died...!

272
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:54,833
do You know how
lucky you are?!

273
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:58,416
I... I'm sorry.

274
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,041
You're okay now...

275
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:02,250
I'm glad he
made it in time.

276
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:03,666
It's gonna be okay, Mai...

277
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,500
You're with your friends.

278
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,375
You're safe now.

279
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:08,833
I'm so stupid.

280
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:12,708
I ran off on my own, and made
all my friends worry about me...

281
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,833
What was I thinking?

282
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,916
It's awfully quiet, huh?

283
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,083
The only thing I'm sensing
right now is a big void...

284
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:31,000
It feels as if this
place is deserted.

285
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:33,916
It seems like classes
should've started already.

286
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,125
Hey!

287
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,666
Come and check
out the gymnasium.

288
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,833
It looks like they're
having a school assembly...

289
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:42,458
I guess that means the zuzhou
hasn't been reversed...

290
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:43,625
Let's head back to base.

291
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,166
What are you doing here?

292
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,541
Great.

293
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:52,000
Looks like Naru
and Lin are back.

294
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,083
We're just wondering
what's going on, that's all.

295
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:57,625
We're not here to put
on a show for you.

296
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:59,208
I don't believe this!

297
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:01,416
They're still planning
to reverse the zuzhou

298
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,083
back on the students...

299
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:05,208
Those foxfires
could kill them...!

300
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:07,666
Even Yasu's in danger.

301
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,666
-Lin wait!
-Mai!

302
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,666
Listen to me, Lin...

303
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,208
Don't do it!

304
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,500
Are you still going on
about that nonsense?

305
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:16,625
You're crazy...!

306
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:17,875
And you're wrong too...!

307
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,791
Those students don't
deserve to be punished!

308
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:21,333
They didn't know!

309
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,083
You're in our way,
now leave!

310
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:24,208
No!

311
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,250
The entire school
is still here...

312
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,375
They're all in the
gym right now...

313
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,291
They don't know what's going
to happen to them, do they?

314
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,583
Ow...! Let go
of me Naru...

315
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:35,541
Let go!

316
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,458
Everyone. Outside!

317
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:38,875
Don't bother Lin!

318
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:41,500
Answer me...!

319
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,916
Why does that jerk Matsuyama
get off scott-free

320
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,958
while everyone else
is put in danger?

321
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:48,125
Don't you care about
what happens to them?

322
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:51,041
Even if they are partly to
blame for the zuzhou curse...

323
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:53,791
they didn't know that
they were doing!!

324
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,958
You're trying to
kill innocent people!

325
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,208
-You're a murderer.
-Calm down.

326
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:03,666
As long as you
solve the case

327
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,958
then nothing else
matters, right?

328
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,958
And if anyone happens
to die in the process...

329
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,833
it's just an
acceptable loss!

330
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,125
That's enough...

331
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:12,708
This is our only option.

332
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:14,541
You actually believe him?

333
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:15,541
get her out of here,.

334
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,208
No more interruptions.

335
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:18,791
Sure.

336
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:21,166
Don't you walk
away from me!

337
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,708
Come on...

338
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:24,000
Somebody stop him...!

339
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,083
Naru!

340
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,250
Why isn't anyone
stopping him?

341
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:32,791
-Mai!
-But Monk...!

342
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,583
We can't let him do this!

343
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,083
Have some faith in Naru.

344
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:40,958
Think about it.

345
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,500
Has he ever let
us down before?

346
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:43,833
But I...

347
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:46,166
Has he?

348
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,291
No.

349
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,708
Just believe in him...

350
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,083
Everything will be fine.

351
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,625
But Monk...

352
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:55,333
Yasu is in the gymnasium with
all of the other students...

353
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,791
Don't you know that I'm
worried about him too?

354
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,458
Yeah.

355
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:06,625
It's alright.

356
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:10,125
It's good to know everyone
else is as worried as I am.

357
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:12,083
I bet Naru is too.

358
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:38,000
-Is it over?
-Yes.

359
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,666
So what happened?

360
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,916
Mai, wait!

361
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,333
Please be okay!

362
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:55,208
What is it...?

363
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:56,791
What are you looking at?

364
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:02,875
Whoa...

365
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,041
Are those...

366
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,125
Hitogata?

367
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,416
But what happened to all the
students that were in here?

368
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,333
-Naru.
-Hey Monk.

369
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:14,625
What's up?

370
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:17,083
I want you and John to
check all the hitogata...

371
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:19,333
Miss Hara, Miss
Matsuzaki and...

372
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:20,958
-Mai.
-Yeah?

373
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:23,833
Split up and check all the names
on any unbroken hitogata...

374
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,333
Wow.

375
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:28,625
So they actually made a
hitogata for every student.

376
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:31,958
Just to be clear,

377
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:35,083
you've never messed around
with orikirisama, right...?

378
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,000
Okay, thanks for your help!

379
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:39,583
We're good, guys...

380
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,083
Nothing happened to her.

381
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:42,625
-Wow.
-Wonderful!

382
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:47,125
There were enough hitogata
to cover all the students...

383
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,250
The effects of the
zuzhou reversal,

384
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:50,916
which should have
gone to them...

385
00:18:56,333 --> 00:19:00,083
Were completely absorbed
by the hitogata.

386
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,416
Once it was finished the
hitogata were broken,

387
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,000
and any that were unharmed,

388
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:08,291
represented the students who
never took part in orikirisama.

389
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:11,125
This had been Naru's plan
from the beginning...

390
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,083
He never wanted
to harm anyone.

391
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,583
Naru.

392
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:19,666
How did we do?

393
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,958
They're all safe.

394
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:23,000
They said they'd never
done Orikirisama.

395
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,166
That's great news

396
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,750
Look... If you were planning
to make hitogata for everyone,

397
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:33,000
wouldn't it have been easier to
make just one for Matsuyama.

398
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:35,500
Which sounds like
better odds to you?

399
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,208
Four against one,

400
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:38,916
or four against six-hundred?

401
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:42,958
Geez...! You dummy!

402
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,041
We could have avoided
all this drama

403
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,333
if you had just told me
that from the beginning.

404
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:50,666
Transferring a curse to a
hitogata is extremely difficult.

405
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,125
Even Lin wasn't sure that
everyone would be safe.

406
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:56,458
I just wish that
I had known

407
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:58,000
Murderer!

408
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,916
That was a terrible
thing to say.

409
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,500
I'm sorry.

410
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:06,625
I know I said some very
inconsiderate things to you...

411
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:09,625
You get so caught up in
the welfare of others...

412
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,666
It must have been
awful for you,

413
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,875
and for that I apologize.

414
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:24,875
Not fair!

415
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,750
I was just about to
apologize myself but no!

416
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:30,333
Naru had to do
it before me!

417
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:31,875
Maybe it's just me

418
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,291
but you seem to always take the
best moments for yourself!

419
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:03,500
I wanted to thank you
for all you've done.

420
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:06,750
And since Sakauchi's curse is
what started this whole mess,

421
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:09,250
I was thinking of holding a
memorial service for him,

422
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,875
to keep any possibility of
future problems in check.

423
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:14,125
That wouldn't
be a bad idea.

424
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,291
It makes me wonder...

425
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:19,583
Is Sakauchi disappointed
that the curse never happened,

426
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:21,208
or is he relieved?

427
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:24,541
How do you think he feels?

428
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,000
Well to be honest...

429
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,041
I'm really not sure

430
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:30,875
I'd like to think he's happy
that no one was hurt...

431
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,125
Do you know what I mean?

432
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,583
By the way, Yasu.

433
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:37,708
Tell me the truth.

434
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:39,166
You were scared back
there, weren't ya?

435
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,125
Oh you mean when
Naru and Lin said

436
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:43,375
they'd be reversing the
zuzhou back on us?

437
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:44,541
That's right.

438
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,166
Well, you see...

439
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,333
I had faith.

440
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:49,416
In what?

441
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,583
In myself.

442
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:54,375
I've never done anything
that was so bad

443
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:56,291
that would warrant me dying
at such a young age...

444
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:58,250
So I was confident
that out of everyone

445
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:00,250
at least I would come
out of it unscathed.

446
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:02,666
You'll live a long life
with that attitude.

447
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,000
That's what I plan on.

448
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:23,250
[Music]

449
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:51,250
Next time on Ghost Hunt,

450
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:53,416
The Bloodstained Labyrinth
Part One...

451
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,958
Sounds scary, doesn't it?
