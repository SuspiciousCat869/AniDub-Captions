1
00:00:09,083 --> 00:00:12,083
Shibuya Psychic Research
began performing exorcisms

2
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:14,041
to try to stop the
dangerous phenomena

3
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:16,000
at Yuasa High School,

4
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:17,583
but nothing changed...

5
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:20,791
Oh my God she cursed me!

6
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:22,291
The truth is,

7
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:24,000
things were only
getting worse...

8
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:28,583
That woman never looked
at me, not once...

9
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:31,500
she only looked at Naru!

10
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:33,958
We're dealing
with a zuzhou.

11
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:35,750
Someone has cast
multiple enmi spells

12
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:37,541
against people
at this school

13
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:39,000
and evil spirits are
appearing to those

14
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:40,208
who have been cursed.

15
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:42,875
Masako and Ayako believe

16
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:45,750
that Kasai is to
blame for everything,

17
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:47,291
but I honestly
don't think it's her.

18
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:51,000
Then we found hitogata's
used for the zuzhou hex

19
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:53,541
in all of the places
connected to these incidents,

20
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:55,625
just like Naru said.

21
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:57,750
If we can just find the
person who made the dolls

22
00:00:57,833 --> 00:01:00,625
the case will be solved
and we can go home...

23
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:02,333
I hope we figure
it out soon.

24
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:11,125
[Music]

25
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:54,125
I heard she saw something!

26
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:57,458
It's the same thing
that Mr. oshino saw!

27
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:59,125
It gotta be a curse!

28
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:00,625
Come on you
know it's her...

29
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:02,208
who else would do this?!

30
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:04,625
I hope I don't meet
Kasai in a dark hallway.

31
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:13,583
Call us soon and let us
know how she's doing, okay.

32
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:14,750
Right...

33
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,416
You guys try to
be careful, okay?

34
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,000
shouldn't we just go ahead

35
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,958
and get this Kasai
girl locked down?

36
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:34,250
Our lives are
in danger here!

37
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:35,291
You can't...!

38
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,416
This isn't her
fault, I swear!

39
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,125
You still believe
that crap...?

40
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,541
Then tell us
who is doing it!

41
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:41,625
Otherwise, butt out!

42
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,500
Uh... well it's...

43
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:46,000
I guess I don't know.

44
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:48,166
Whoever it is,
they're warning us.

45
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,833
What do you mean?

46
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:52,958
We must be getting
close to something...

47
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:55,500
the hexer attacked Miss Hara
and I to warn us...

48
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:56,958
from digging any deeper.

49
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:58,500
That's a Helluva warning...

50
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:01,083
Masako was pushed down
the stairs, Naru...

51
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,458
This is serious.

52
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:05,500
Yeah... and not to toot my
own horn or anything...

53
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,125
But who knows what
would've happened to you

54
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:09,541
if I hadn't scared away
that spirit earlier.

55
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,291
So as long as we
get the message,

56
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:14,291
the hexer doesn't really care if
one of us is hurt or killed...

57
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,708
That tells us a bit more
about the kind of person

58
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:17,875
we're dealing with...

59
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,666
and makes our resolving
this case quickly

60
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,791
all the more imperative.

61
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,666
the targets were
Mr. oshino,

62
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,916
the unfortunate sophomores

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,166
who sat at that desk

64
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,458
and had accidents
one after another,

65
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,208
and the entire track team.

66
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:31,833
And let's not forget,

67
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:34,250
the hitogata we found in the
desk and the locker room

68
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:35,666
make it clear
that the culprit

69
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,166
was after someone
connected to them.

70
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,333
I think we're all aware

71
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:42,333
that working on this
case poses a risk...

72
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,875
And for that reason we should
want to expose the hexer...

73
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,875
as soon as we
possibly can.

74
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:49,166
Lin, Mai, and myself
will investigate

75
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,041
those connected to the
desk and the track team.

76
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,125
Monk, you and Miss Matsuzaki

77
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:57,708
will continue to search
the school for hitogata...

78
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:58,916
Right.

79
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:03,000
How come we always end
up doing the grunt work?

80
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,916
Yeah, I wish Naru would
leave his computer

81
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,041
and get his hands
dirty for a change.

82
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:10,875
Ohhhh, nooo, my
nails are ruined!

83
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:13,000
And I just got
this manicure!

84
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:20,333
Monk... come here.

85
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,208
What now?

86
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,500
That long hair...

87
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,666
do you think that could've
been the Kasai girl

88
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,166
spying on us?

89
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,250
So you're trying to
figure out if the desk

90
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:38,750
and the track team
have a connection?

91
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:41,208
Who was the first student
to sit in that seat?

92
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:42,833
Uh, first term...

93
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,958
I honestly don't
remember...

94
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:47,791
but I know that Murayama
sat there second term.

95
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,291
When exactly would
that have been?

96
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:50,833
Oh...

97
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,458
Let's see, the first
seating change

98
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:54,333
was in the middle
of September...

99
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:55,916
See, at our school,

100
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,541
we always change seats on the
fifteenth day of every month.

101
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,208
So it must've been
from July fifteenth

102
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,541
to September, uh, fourteenth.

103
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,208
With summer vacation
in the middle.

104
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:07,291
When did Murayama
have her accident?

105
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,541
A couple of days before
the seating change, I think.

106
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,083
Alright...

107
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:13,125
That means that
the culprit...

108
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:16,041
must've put the
hitogata in the desk...

109
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,000
sometime between
July fifteenth

110
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,500
and September eleventh
or twelfth.

111
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:21,166
Hitogata?

112
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,500
The accidents started happening
midway through September...

113
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:27,375
so the student before Murayama
probably wasn't connected.

114
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:29,583
I think it's a safe bet

115
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:31,125
that Murayama must've
done something

116
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,250
to anger the hexer
during that period.

117
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:34,666
Anger?

118
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,666
Oh yes... That's obvious...

119
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,750
They had to have had a
grudge of some kind...

120
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,666
Our culprit knew Murayama,

121
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,416
or at least what
she looked like...

122
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,708
Which means...

123
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:46,458
we can probably rule out
teachers she didn't have

124
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,125
and students in
other grades.

125
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,416
Um, I dunno...

126
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,750
Sometimes substitutes

127
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:54,333
or administration
type people come in,

128
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:55,791
plus there are
club meetings and stuff

129
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:58,333
that other kids come to.

130
00:06:58,416 --> 00:06:59,708
Hey, what is it?

131
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:05,166
Well... it happened
during the Kasai Panic...

132
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,666
Some of us kept dragging
Kasai into our classroom

133
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,875
to see the
spoon-bending thing...

134
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:12,208
It really was pretty
cool, y'know...?

135
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:14,791
But, One time, Murayama
just totally stormed in

136
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:15,833
and started yelling at us.

137
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:18,000
Would you guys
give it a rest?!

138
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,583
I'm so sick of this
supernatural crap...

139
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,125
I mean... come on...

140
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,875
it's really just a
cheap trick, right?

141
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:28,833
I guess Murayama
was pretty upset...

142
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,500
because she even went
to talk to Miss Ubusuna.

143
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,458
Miss Ubusuna?

144
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:34,416
Uh yeah...

145
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,708
She knows a ton about
psychic powers and stuff.

146
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,375
Didn't you guys know that?

147
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:42,291
I've even gone to ask her
questions about it before.

148
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,375
Spoons would be
stationary objects...

149
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:47,666
which fall into the
category of PK-ST.

150
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,583
There is also PK-MT...

151
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:50,916
which is the
psychic ability

152
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,541
to control objects
in motion.

153
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,291
For instance...
you rolled a die

154
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:55,833
and you willed that
die to be a two,

155
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,500
and a two
actually came up...

156
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,000
It's not uncommon
for people

157
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,875
to possess either of
these latent abilities

158
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:05,791
I think maybe that's why she
always stuck up for Kasai,

159
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:08,750
even when the whole school
went crazy over psychic stuff

160
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,333
and people started
taking sides.

161
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,500
And this is the
teacher Murayama

162
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,375
complained to about Kasai?

163
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,416
Miss Ubusuna said
if she stepped in

164
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,875
it would just
stir things up...

165
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:22,916
But pretty soon,

166
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,875
the other teachers
and the PTA

167
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,708
started freaking
out about it.

168
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,291
So Murayama was
the first person

169
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,583
to reject psychic powers...

170
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,166
Quite interesting.

171
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,291
Wow... You know I hadn't
even thought about it

172
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:35,833
until just now...

173
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:36,875
but I don't think
the track team

174
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,083
had a lot of
believers either.

175
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,458
Well, Mr. oshino
was the team's advisor

176
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:42,750
and he really
didn't believe.

177
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:45,166
SO, the team ended
up doing, you know...

178
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,375
whatever he said.

179
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:53,916
Here it is,
looks like everyone

180
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
who spoke against our
friend... Kasai...

181
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,875
eventually experienced
some kind of harm.

182
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:01,916
Okay... so then...

183
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,791
The probability that Kasai

184
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:06,583
is the culprit has
just skyrocketed.

185
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,500
Hey! What do you mean?!

186
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,500
Zuzhou doesn't work
for just any person

187
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:11,791
who attempts it...

188
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:14,166
Only those who've had
special training...

189
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,541
or are very knowledgeable
about supernatural powers

190
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,000
can perform them.

191
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,541
But remember you
said Kasai's power

192
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,291
was unstable, Naru...

193
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,750
you did!

194
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,250
And that would mean...

195
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,583
it'd be hard for someone
like her to control a zuzhou,

196
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:28,791
isnt' that right?

197
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,958
Yeah... that's a good point...

198
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:31,875
very true.

199
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,958
Didn't you say Zuzhou
came from onmyodo?

200
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:42,083
So then An onmyouji
could dispel them, right?

201
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,875
So That would mean he
does practice onmyodo.

202
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,166
In the hallway
I told Kasai

203
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,666
that you are one of those...

204
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,708
and her reaction
was kinda weird.

205
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:52,041
Why did you tell
her that...?

206
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,666
I am no such thing.

207
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,541
Huh...?! You're not?!

208
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,500
Of course not.

209
00:09:57,583 --> 00:10:00,958
But you used a hitogata in
that case before, didn't you?!

210
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:03,708
And Monk said only an
onmyouji could do that!

211
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,333
Actually, Lin made it.

212
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:10,666
So you mean Lin
is an onmyouji?

213
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,708
Yes. I guess you
could say that.

214
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,791
Oh... but...

215
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:17,458
I guess it still looks pretty
bad for Kasai, doesn't it?

216
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:21,458
That she's the person
behind all of this?

217
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,458
Well, if she thought I was a
threat and hexed me for fear

218
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,708
that I'd dispel her
zuzhou, then yes,

219
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,416
it looks bad for her.

220
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,875
But what if...

221
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,708
what if she didn't
mean to do it...

222
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:33,333
like she did it subconsciously
or something and didn't know...

223
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:34,833
She would know...

224
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:38,375
practicing enmi involves
actively cursing the subject.

225
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:41,791
Oh, then...
no, it's not right...!

226
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,750
Kasai isn't the kind of
person who would do this!

227
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,791
Is this intuition
talking again?

228
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:52,000
I know that
Kasai is innocent.

229
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,458
Alright...

230
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,208
If that's what your
gut is telling you.

231
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,166
I'll trust it.

232
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,666
But right now I need
to look something up...

233
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,375
Go find the others and help
them search for the hitogata.

234
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:11,833
Okay!

235
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:19,583
What did you say?!

236
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,041
You're kidding right?

237
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,916
I'm not...

238
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
you just made some
wrong assumptions

239
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,458
about Naru, that's all.

240
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:28,916
But come on, making hitogata,
performing purifications,

241
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,833
and now this
zuzhou thing?

242
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,750
Of course we'd think
he was an onmyouji,

243
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,500
anyone would!

244
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:38,916
Well, according to Naru,
Lin can do it.

245
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,958
So I ruined a perfectly
good manicure for nothing.

246
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:43,791
And I've been putting
up with his crap

247
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:45,458
because I thought
'oooh, he's a master,

248
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:48,375
we have to do what
master says!'

249
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,750
Miss Ubusuna?

250
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,333
Yes...

251
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:56,625
I just heard that
Masako Hara was injured.

252
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,791
Yes... she fell
down the stairs.

253
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,750
Is she alright?

254
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:03,416
At the moment it doesn't appear
to be life-threatening...

255
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,958
but if she'd landed
any differently

256
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,041
things could have
been a lot worse.

257
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,375
Maybe you'll see this as
an opportunity to wake up

258
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:10,958
and take a good
look at this girl

259
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:12,666
you're so interested
in defending.

260
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,625
-Ayako!
-Oh, I knew it...

261
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,000
You've chosen to believe

262
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,500
that Kasai is to blame for
this, too, haven't you?

263
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:19,958
Of course we do.

264
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,041
There's certainly no
reason to not suspect her.

265
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:23,791
She's so scared
right now...

266
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,833
I really worry
about her...

267
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:28,333
I'm not sure...
what she'll do...

268
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:29,583
Wait a minute...

269
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,541
she wouldn't kill herself...
would she?!

270
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:32,958
I doubt it...

271
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:36,125
I saw her over there spying
on me and Monk earlier...

272
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:38,333
for all we know maybe
the little dear is deciding

273
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:39,750
who she wants
to curse next.

274
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:42,458
-Who do you think you...
-I'm sorry!

275
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:43,833
Really, I'm so sorry.

276
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,166
I don't think that way...

277
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,916
I mean, I don't think
Kasai's causing

278
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,750
all of these
things to happen.

279
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,916
I'm not sure how I
know it's true...

280
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,041
but I can feel it.

281
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,916
You feel it?

282
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,958
There's a voice
inside of me...

283
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:03,125
I know that Kasai
is innocent.

284
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:06,708
I can't say it's anything
more than my gut feeling...

285
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:08,375
but... it's so strong

286
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,416
I have to believe it
with all my heart.

287
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,166
Amazing...

288
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,500
and what's your name?

289
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:14,916
Mai Taniyama.

290
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,500
Thank you, Mai...

291
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:17,875
That meant a lot...

292
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,208
and I know Kasai will be
very happy to hear it, too.

293
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:24,291
I would really
appreciate it

294
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:27,250
if the rest of you would stop
accusing that young girl.

295
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,958
The poor thing has been
though enough as it is.

296
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:32,416
Good day.

297
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,875
How can we stop
accusing her??

298
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,208
What if something
worse happens

299
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,708
because we sat back and
didn't act in time?

300
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:40,000
Yeah, and it's
starting to look like

301
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:41,791
it could be our turn next.

302
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,583
Nothing here...

303
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:50,791
Man, I've looked
everywhere

304
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,666
that seems like a
good hiding place.

305
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,208
Is that a little kid?

306
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:11,500
Is someone out there?

307
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:12,750
Hello?

308
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,375
Where are you...?

309
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:20,666
Can you hear me?

310
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:24,916
Please don't cry...

311
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,041
just tell me
where you are!

312
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:29,125
Come on, it's ok!

313
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,708
Oh... now how did
someone get in there?

314
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:46,041
Are you okay...?

315
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,833
Are you hurt...?

316
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:49,708
Don't worry, I'm gonna
come down to help you.

317
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,875
Mai!

318
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,750
What are you
doing in there?

319
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,708
There's a kid
trapped in here!

320
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,000
A kid?

321
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:05,625
Yeah, they dropped their
backpack over th...

322
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,083
Where did it go...?

323
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:11,625
Mai!

324
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:13,333
Don't worry, I'm fine.

325
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,625
Listen to me...

326
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,666
Calmly put your foot
on the ladder...

327
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,083
Can you do that?

328
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:38,541
Uh... Yeah!

329
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:55,166
I fell down the well on
our last investigation, too...

330
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,541
I wonder why this stuff
always happens to me?

331
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:58,583
Are you alright?

332
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,333
Oh Naru, did you
fall in, too?!

333
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,541
Well you were holding
onto my hand so tightly...

334
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,250
it was kind of
hard not to.

335
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,875
Oh... I'm sorry...

336
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:11,625
I didn't know the
ladder would break.

337
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:14,125
I guess someone will
come rescue us soon.

338
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,125
Did you tell anyone
you'd be here?

339
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,625
Uh... no.

340
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:18,916
Me, neither.

341
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,250
Hey...!

342
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:22,083
Somebody!

343
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:27,125
What possessed you to
come down here, anyway?

344
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:28,375
Well you see...

345
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:30,250
I heard this kid crying...

346
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:31,708
so I started
looking around

347
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,625
and then I saw a
little girl down here.

348
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:38,833
She's gone.

349
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:41,583
Of course, why didn't
I think it was strange?

350
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,083
It was so dark
down here...

351
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:45,208
but I could see the
little girl clearly...

352
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:47,416
like she was lit
up or something...

353
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,458
So now we know they've decided
to attack you, as well.

354
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,208
Oh my gosh, Naru.,

355
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:55,041
how can you be so calm
in such a scary place?!

356
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,500
And it's gonna
be night soon!

357
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,416
once it's all dark,

358
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,333
those spirits might
appear again!

359
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:04,250
And of course I have
to be down here

360
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,916
with the most cold-hearted
person in the world...

361
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,416
Sure I guess I
made him fall...

362
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,208
but I didn't mean to and

363
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:12,208
I'm scared and he could at
least try to comfort me

364
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,500
a little or be nice
and encouraging...

365
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,375
Hold on...

366
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:18,708
if you think about it...

367
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:21,416
This is like our own
little private world!

368
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,208
Feeling better now?

369
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:24,500
Yeah!

370
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:27,583
Wow...

371
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:30,875
he just looked like
the Naru in my dreams.

372
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:32,583
Could you tell I
was feeling better?

373
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:33,916
Of course.

374
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,375
You usually get
depressed first...

375
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,166
and then you get mad...

376
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,750
but you normally
tend to bounce back

377
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,625
pretty quickly after that.

378
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:43,500
Gosh, how do you
know that about me?

379
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,875
Because it's written
all over your face.

380
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,125
It is...?!

381
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:48,791
Oh, man...

382
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:51,916
Hey... would you
like to meet my pet?

383
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Come on out here.

384
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:56,291
That's... your pet...?

385
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,916
C'mon it's just a piddly
little five hundred yen.

386
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:04,666
You see he hid because
you made fun of him.

387
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,541
No...! You've just
got it in your hand!

388
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:08,625
Really?

389
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:15,375
Ah, there he is.

390
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:16,583
How'd you do that...?

391
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,250
Naru, let me see it!

392
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:19,333
Catch.

393
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:25,166
Hey...! You didn't
even throw it!

394
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,000
I guess your yelling
scared him so much

395
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,541
he had to hide again.

396
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,791
Naru! I did not yell!

397
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:35,041
Oh... so that's
where he was.

398
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:36,791
You're really
good at magic.

399
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,416
So You believe it's magic?

400
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,000
Yeah... it is, right!

401
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,041
No, it's not!

402
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,000
Whoa?!

403
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:45,666
You're not afraid
of Mai, are you?

404
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,791
You don't have to
be afraid of her...

405
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:50,791
I promise she's not nearly
as scary as she comes across.

406
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,083
How cool...!

407
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:54,833
I had no idea he was
a ventriloquist too.

408
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:57,458
But even though
I know that,

409
00:18:57,541 --> 00:19:00,250
it looks like the coin
is really talking!

410
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:01,541
Keep going...!

411
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,250
Please do some more, Naru.

412
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:06,458
I'm afraid he's decided to
retire for the time being.

413
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:08,458
Why, don't you feel okay?

414
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,458
I wish I had some gear.

415
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,416
I know it's dark in here...

416
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,000
but he looks pale to me.

417
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,208
Don't worry, Mai...

418
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,250
when everyone gets back
together to report

419
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,791
they'll see I'm not there
and come looking for me...

420
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,875
at least, I know
that Lin will.

421
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:34,708
What's wrong?

422
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,375
Whatever happens
stay close...

423
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:37,958
and keep calm.

424
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:44,166
What's that?

425
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:52,291
It's alright.

426
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:53,500
The spirit couldn't
have grown

427
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,750
much more powerful
in one day...

428
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,541
stay calm and
we'll be just fine.

429
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,041
What's she doing?

430
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,125
It's okay.

431
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:15,958
Naru...

432
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:27,416
Oh... somebody...

433
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:30,416
Monk...

434
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,333
Ayako...

435
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,958
Anybody, help!

436
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:41,875
Oh... Naru...

437
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:43,166
Where did it go?

438
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:46,500
Naru!

439
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:49,291
Are you down there?

440
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,750
Hey It's Lin

441
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,083
That was quick...

442
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:54,708
We need a rope
or ladder...

443
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:56,250
and a flashlight, please.

444
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:58,625
you know...

445
00:20:58,708 --> 00:20:59,875
It's actually
kinda impressive

446
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,208
that there are this
many of them...

447
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:05,000
I never would have thought
to look in the sewer.

448
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:06,875
There's Mai.

449
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,583
So Mai's doll...

450
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,541
and also ones for
Miss Hara, Yoshino,

451
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:11,750
and myself were found.

452
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:14,083
Our names weren't there?

453
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:16,333
Well, I guess
That's a relief.

454
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:19,583
I dunno, I kinda
feel left out.

455
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:21,250
Now we have to
Burn the hitogata

456
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,208
and throw the ashes
in the river...

457
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,333
and the power of the
enmi will be broken.

458
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
But... do you believe
this will stop the hexer?

459
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:32,083
We're not even completely
sure who it is.

460
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,333
Know who it's not...?

461
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:35,166
It's not Kasai,
that's who!

462
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,541
Mai, come on, this is
really getting old!

463
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:43,000
Hey... Naru...
what's wrong?

464
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:48,166
Are you feeling
alright man...

465
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,041
Naru?

466
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:05,583
Naru?

467
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:12,833
Naru!

468
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:23,125
[Music]

469
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:51,375
Don't miss the
next Ghost Hunt,

470
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:53,625
'The After-School
Hexer' Part Four.

471
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:54,958
I Hope Naru's okay.
