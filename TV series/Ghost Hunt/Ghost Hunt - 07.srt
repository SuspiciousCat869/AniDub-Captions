1
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:22,125
She came to see us on
a Sunday in November...

2
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:26,666
-Here you go.
-Oh...

3
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,083
thanks alot.

4
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:29,833
So you're saying...

5
00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:31,708
your friend has been
acting strangely

6
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:34,166
ever since using a
Ouija board at school?

7
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,416
Yeah.

8
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:41,666
She'd jump up onto her
desk in the middle of class...

9
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,125
And in gym she was eating
sand from the sandbox.

10
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:47,375
I know it sounds crazy,
but I really think

11
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:49,958
she might be
possessed by a fox.

12
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:51,750
Can you help her?

13
00:00:51,833 --> 00:01:01,791
[Music]

14
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:07,875
[Music]

15
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,416
You should take your
friend to the hospital...

16
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,458
she needs a doctor.

17
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:18,375
But... Naru... wait!

18
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:30,500
[Music]

19
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,125
Why did you treat
her like that??

20
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,416
All I said was that it
sounded like her friend

21
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,375
needed a doctor's care.

22
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:01,750
You could have at
least been nice

23
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,333
and referred her
to someone else.

24
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,166
Knock-knock...

25
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,416
Hey Naru, whaddup?

26
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:10,916
Uh... who're you?

27
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,958
Man, lemme tell ya
coming to Shibuya

28
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:15,000
on a Sunday is crazy.

29
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:18,541
Mai...! be a sweetheart
and get me an iced coffee.

30
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:20,625
Uh... no way...

31
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:22,708
Is that monk in there?

32
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:25,541
What, the outfit...? I
had a live show today...

33
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:28,541
I gotta admit I love being
in front of a crowd...

34
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,875
playing in basement studios
isn't nearly as exciting.

35
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:35,541
Hey...! Does that
mean you used to be

36
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,333
in a rock band
or something?? !

37
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,875
Well, I didn't used to
be in rock band, Mai...

38
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:41,666
It's my main gig...

39
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,916
I play bass.

40
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,458
But, how can
you work at Mt. Koya

41
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:47,375
and be in a band are you
just a monk on the side?

42
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:48,875
Kinda...

43
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,541
The temple belongs
to my family,

44
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,833
and my dad really wanted
me to be a monk...

45
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,958
but when I couldn't bring
CDs and stuff up there,

46
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:56,916
I had to make a choice.

47
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,916
You know... I see a lot of
curses in rock n roll...

48
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,875
More than you'd imagine...

49
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:05,375
So whenever
something happens

50
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,250
and an exorcism is needed...

51
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,750
They call me since I'm
already in the biz...

52
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:10,958
See?

53
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,208
Uh-huh...

54
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:13,250
I get it.

55
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,958
Wow, I guess you really
never know about people.

56
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:19,125
Although in Monk's case
it was actually harder

57
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,958
to believe he was a
monk than a rocker.

58
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,083
How about you fill us
in on what business

59
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,666
you have here today?

60
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,416
Oh, right...

61
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,250
There really was a point
to my coming here,

62
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:32,875
I promise.

63
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:35,541
I was hoping you would let me
pick your brain a little.

64
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,375
There's a local high school
girl who follows our band...

65
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:44,208
after our last gig, she struck
up a conversation with me.

66
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:47,375
Is it true that
you do exorcisms?

67
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:48,583
Uh... well...

68
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,125
So after some initial
fan girl chatting,

69
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,625
she started telling me about a
certain desk at her school

70
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,791
that's apparently cursed.

71
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,416
Every single person
who's sat there

72
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,166
in the last three months has
been involved in an accident...

73
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:07,375
and not just that, but
the same type of accident.

74
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:10,625
They've all gotten their arms
caught in the door of a train...

75
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,625
and then been
dragged by it.

76
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:18,333
A total of people have sat in
that seat since September,

77
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,333
and all of them
have fallen victim.

78
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:21,791
One had only
minor injuries

79
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,708
but the rest were
seriously hurt.

80
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:26,041
The teacher of that class
was also affected -

81
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,166
he went on and on
about seeing ghosts

82
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,083
and then ended up
in the hospital.

83
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,416
He keeps coughing
up blood,

84
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,416
but they can't figure
out what's wrong

85
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,041
There's all sorts
of stories

86
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:38,041
about strange incidents
happening at that school...

87
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:41,166
I've even heard they think
someone there is possessed.

88
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,166
Wait, possessed?

89
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,625
It sounds crazy, but
I think she might be

90
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,250
possessed by a fox.

91
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:47,416
Hey Monk...

92
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,708
do you happen to
remember if the school

93
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:51,500
she was talking about
was Yuasa High School?

94
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:54,375
That's right...
How'd you know?

95
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:55,625
Hello...

96
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,291
hope I'm not intruding.

97
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,666
Hi...! um...

98
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,625
what can we do for you?

99
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,000
Well you see...

100
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,583
I'm hoping you
can help me.

101
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:05,666
Yuasa High School? !

102
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:29,333
We're grateful
for your time.

103
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:32,083
Mr. Yoshino is our
guidance counselor...

104
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:34,708
he'll give you a full
tour of the school.

105
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,375
Hi there...

106
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:38,291
it's nice to meet you.

107
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,541
As you requested, a conference
room has been cleared out

108
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:41,791
for you to set up in.

109
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:44,791
We've announced that
anyone who wants to

110
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,916
speak with you
should go there.

111
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,916
So, this is
home base, huh?

112
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,250
We should get the equipment
set up right away...

113
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:55,291
Lin?

114
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,625
-Right.
-Um... excuse me...

115
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,416
Are you the one
who's in charge here?

116
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,750
No sir...

117
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,708
You want him.

118
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:03,583
What's wrong?

119
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:06,625
Well... I...

120
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:08,791
Before the
students come in...

121
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,333
I'd like...

122
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:12,708
to tell you
about something.

123
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:16,458
Yes, of course...

124
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:17,833
Have a seat please.

125
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,291
You see, um...

126
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,625
at night I've been
hearing this...

127
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:26,875
knocking sound...

128
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:33,791
It wouldn't stop, so
finally I got up

129
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,750
and went to open
the curtain...

130
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:45,375
Since then I've barely
gotten a wink of sleep.

131
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:48,083
Hmmm... has anyone else in your
house heard the knocking?

132
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,375
Yes, but it doesn't
seem to bother them

133
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:51,958
as much as it does me.

134
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,375
I see.

135
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:03,208
Your name was Kiyomi...
Kiyomi Ito?

136
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,791
Yes.

137
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:06,666
When you came
to see us...

138
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,291
I believe you said
you thought

139
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,291
your friend was
possessed by a fox...

140
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:11,666
Is she here?

141
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,125
No sir...
she's at home.

142
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,041
And you also said
she that was jumping up

143
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,166
on desks and
eating sand?

144
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,625
There's other
stuff, too...

145
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,875
One time she dove into the
pool with her uniform on...

146
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:24,958
It was like forty
degrees that day.

147
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,041
Has your friend
ever hurt anybody?

148
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,750
Oh, no sir.

149
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,541
When she started
acting strangely,

150
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:37,000
why did you believe she might
be possessed by a fox?

151
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,375
Why didn't you think that
she might just be sick?

152
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:40,958
Because...

153
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:42,666
she actually said
'I am the white fox

154
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,750
of the harvest god'...

155
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:47,875
It all happened after
that darn Ouija board...

156
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,291
When everyone was
leaving she told us

157
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:50,875
that she thought
she was possessed.

158
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,375
I told her that
there was no way,

159
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:55,416
but she said she
felt really weird.

160
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,125
And then the next day she
started acting differently.

161
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:02,583
Where were you using
the Ouija board?

162
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:05,333
In classroom 1-3

163
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:08,500
Look the track team's locker
room is really creepy...

164
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,625
the lockers just fall
over by themselves

165
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,458
and our equipment
will move around.

166
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:15,333
At first we thought someone
was just playing a joke,

167
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,666
so some of us hid to try and
catch them in the act...

168
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,375
No one knows how it
happened exactly

169
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,791
but suddenly the shot-put
balls we'd put in a box

170
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:24,250
were lined up in the
middle of the floor.

171
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:26,791
Last month some friends
and I did a test of courage

172
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,250
in a storage room
in the gym, and

173
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,583
I've been seeing a
bunch of these

174
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,333
weird shadows ever since...

175
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:33,083
One of the other
girls even swears

176
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:35,458
she's seen ghosts coming
out of her desk, so...

177
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:36,625
During class?

178
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:38,416
Yeah...

179
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,250
Um... she said it was like she
all of a sudden couldn't move,

180
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,958
and it felt like someone
was touching her stomach.

181
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,833
And when she looked
down to see ...

182
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:51,958
She said it happened
all the time...

183
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:54,083
And her stomach just
wouldn't stop hurting...

184
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:56,500
She ended up having
to go to the hospital.

185
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:02,083
Is anybody in here?

186
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,416
Norio!

187
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,375
Ohmygosh you really came!

188
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:06,750
Hey...

189
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,166
Meet my friends...

190
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,708
That handsome devil
is Mr. hibuya,

191
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:12,791
the director of Shibuya
Psychic Research.

192
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:15,375
And his assistant,
Miss Taniyama.

193
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,458
Hi, my name is
Yuko Takahashi...

194
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:18,708
It's Nice to meet you!

195
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,833
Oh, same here...

196
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:23,458
Uh, "Norio"...?
What's that?

197
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,833
That's what they decided
to call me in the band...

198
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,041
See, my real name is
Hosho, right...?

199
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,000
-So we thought...
-So Getting back to the point.

200
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:31,500
I'm guessing that you're
one of the victims.

201
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:32,750
Were you involved
in an accident

202
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,791
after sitting at
a certain desk?

203
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,458
Uh, yes.

204
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,666
I was the second one
it happened to...

205
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,041
The train arrived
at my stop

206
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:42,083
and when the doors
opened I stepped out

207
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,416
and started to walk
away like normal.

208
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,083
Then it was like
someone grabbed my arm

209
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,833
and pulled me back, and
I got caught ...

210
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:51,166
I wasn't dragged very far but
my shoulder was dislocated

211
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,000
and my legs look
pretty bad.

212
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,166
Was there anyone
standing near the door?

213
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,125
Mm-mm, no one.

214
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,375
In fact I remember the
train was pretty much empty...

215
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,333
just a few people
were there.

216
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,083
Do you have any idea of
what the connection is

217
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:06,458
between that desk
and these accidents?

218
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,041
I don't, do you?

219
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,458
No

220
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:12,000
I'd really like
to see this desk.

221
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,000
Oh, sure, I can
take you to it.

222
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,500
It's back there.

223
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:23,833
Does anyone sit here now?

224
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,166
No one wants to, and the
girl that was sitting here

225
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,000
got hurt so badly she's
still in the hospital

226
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:31,208
And the desk has always
been in this position?

227
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,833
Uh-huh... Just like that

228
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:40,875
Oh...! hey, what's up!

229
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,458
What the heck is going
on at this school...?

230
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:54,000
I can't believe all the
craziness happening here...

231
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,833
who's gonna
exorcise it all...?

232
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:58,666
There's no way I
can do it alone.

233
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,166
Sorry Monk...

234
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,250
Wish I could help but
it's outta my league.

235
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:03,791
Something's not right here.

236
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,541
Huh?

237
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:08,583
Individually, these cases
are not a big deal...

238
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:11,208
but all together
they're abnormal...

239
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,458
Of course, this is assuming
that they are all true...

240
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:16,833
But with all of
these similarities...

241
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:19,916
there has got to be
something here causing it.

242
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:24,291
He's right - this goes
way beyond coincidence.

243
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:36,625
What exactly is
happening at this school?

244
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:44,916
With this many occurrences,

245
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,833
I think we need to
move quickly...

246
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:51,458
I propose we exorcise
anything we come across.

247
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:52,875
If that doesn't work,

248
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:54,666
we'll come back together
and try something else.

249
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,083
I'd like Miss Hara to take
a look around the school...

250
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:01,333
You should Start
with the desk,

251
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:02,625
and then when you're done

252
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:05,375
head over to the track
team's locker room.

253
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,083
Please, I'd be
more comfortable

254
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,250
if you'd just
call me Masako.

255
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:10,916
Is she flirting with him? !

256
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,250
Join her Miss
Matsuzaki...

257
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,208
Exorcise anything
you see fit.

258
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:16,375
Hold on...

259
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:17,625
Are you sure there's
nothing else

260
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:19,500
you'd like to say
to Masako...?

261
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:21,083
I ask because
it seems to me

262
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:22,500
that lately you've
been extra courteous

263
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,083
to our celebrity friend.

264
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,625
We can stand
around all day

265
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:28,083
chit chatting about
things that don't matter

266
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:30,208
but I'd much prefer to
see you in action...

267
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,333
Wouldn't you rather get
to work and impress us

268
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:34,375
than waste everyone
else's time?

269
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,833
Due to the number of
cases we don't have

270
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,708
enough equipment to
send with you...

271
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:42,583
so you'll have to rely
on your own instincts...

272
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,541
Monk and John
Same goes for you.

273
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:45,833
You got it.

274
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:47,375
Sure thing, no worries.

275
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:50,000
Lin and I will continue
the investigation.

276
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:52,875
Mai, you wait here for
everyone to report back.

277
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,666
-Sure
-Alright...

278
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,208
let's begin.

279
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:12,916
It's about the same
temperature outside.

280
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:18,041
And once again I'm
the one left behind.

281
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,833
What do I expect...

282
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:24,666
I can't do exorcisms
like the others...

283
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,916
man, if I could I'm
sure Naru would ...

284
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,125
Holy cow, you scared
the crap out of me!

285
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,041
Oh I'm sorry I
didn't mean to,

286
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:35,416
I just thought Norio
might be in here...

287
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,750
So What are you doing...?
Are you busy?

288
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:38,958
Nah not really.

289
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,416
Just kinda
holdin'down the fort.

290
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,791
Oh, I see...

291
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:44,166
So, how's the
exorcism going?

292
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,958
Well, we've really only
just gotten started...

293
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,166
but I don't think it's
going to be that easy...

294
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,458
there are just so
many cases here.

295
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:53,875
Yeah, I know... it
really makes you wonder

296
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:56,083
what's going on
at this school...

297
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:59,333
curses and ghosts and
supernatural powers...

298
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:00,916
like, where's the
UFO, you know?

299
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,250
Hold on a second!

300
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,166
supernatural powers?

301
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:10,416
Did you say
"Kasai Panic?"

302
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,958
Well... There's this rd year
girl named Chiaki Kasai

303
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:17,041
who could bend a spoon with
just the power of her mind.

304
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,166
It was just after
summer vacation...

305
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,125
suddenly everyone at
school knew her name,

306
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:23,333
and bending spoons and
other supernatural stuff

307
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:25,208
became a really big deal.

308
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,375
The school was divided
over the whole thing.

309
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:30,208
Some people believed in
it, while others didn't.

310
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:32,666
Then one day Kasai was called
up in front of everyone

311
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,083
during morning assembly...

312
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,833
If you really have
powers, prove it

313
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:38,083
by bending this
right here and now.

314
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:39,958
You can't can you?

315
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:43,083
Whoa, she bent it??

316
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:46,500
After that, things
got really bad.

317
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:49,791
A group of teachers started
to attack her credibility.

318
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:51,541
This is obviously
a trick...

319
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,500
you're just making
fools of us!

320
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,291
I guess that sent Kasai
over the edge,

321
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,458
because then she yelled
back at them...

322
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,916
I'll curse you to death!

323
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,833
And after that, all
of these crazy things

324
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:04,000
started happening
around school,

325
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,875
like with the desk and
the track locker room.

326
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:08,375
People started
getting frightened ...

327
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:11,166
they were saying it had to be
because of Kasai's curse.

328
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,541
I'm almost pretty sure
that's why she hasn't been

329
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,666
coming to class lately...

330
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,500
When she's at school
she's usually hiding out

331
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,416
in the biology
prep room.

332
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,708
I don't blame her...

333
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,625
Yes?

334
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,000
Excuse me...

335
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,916
We're looking for a
Miss Chiaki Kasai.

336
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,916
And may I ask what
this is regarding?

337
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,291
I'm here investigating with
Shibuya Psychic Research...

338
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:35,708
And I would very much like
to speak with Miss Kasai.

339
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:38,541
Oh right, um, what
was your name?

340
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:40,291
My name is
Kazuya Shibuya.

341
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,916
Ahhh...

342
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,333
yes, the principal said
there were going to be

343
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,041
some people coming
to investigate

344
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:47,458
all the strange things
happening around the school...

345
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,333
It's so good to
meet you both...

346
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:51,625
please come in, my
name is Kei Ubusuna

347
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:53,375
and I teach biology here.

348
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:54,791
Ubusuna...?

349
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:58,208
That's quite an
unusual name you have.

350
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,333
So you're looking
for Kasai...

351
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:02,375
I'm guessing you'd like to
ask her about the incident

352
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,583
-this past September?
-Leave me alone!

353
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,291
I have nothing to say!

354
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,208
Kasai I think you should
clear up any confusion

355
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:10,583
and tell these people
exactly what happened.

356
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:11,666
Why should I? !

357
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,500
So they can call
me a liar, too? !

358
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:18,458
But they investigate psychic
phenomena all of the time...

359
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:20,083
so they're not going
to immediately reject

360
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,041
or laugh at the
things you say.

361
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,916
O-kay... so whaddya
wanna know?

362
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:30,708
I've heard some very
interesting stories about you

363
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,833
Stories that connect
you to these events...

364
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:35,416
That you have powers...

365
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,750
The kind of powers that
bend spoons and keys at will.

366
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:41,083
Those aren't just stories
they're the truth...

367
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:43,875
I can bend them but I don't
expect you to believe me.

368
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:45,375
Why wouldn't I?

369
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:48,000
You're not the only one who
can bend a spoon, you know.

370
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,125
What? ! Can you??

371
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:51,833
I can...

372
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:53,708
But even if I couldn't
any psychic researcher

373
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:54,958
would believe in PK.

374
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:01,041
Then show me.

375
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:03,958
I guess I have no choice.

376
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,916
Over summer vacation I
was watching one of those

377
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,791
late night
shows, you know?

378
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:24,125
This one was about
spoon-bending...

379
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:26,750
So I got a spoon and
started trying it myself,

380
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:28,375
and eventually I
learned to do it...

381
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,583
I can't break them
like you, though.

382
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,625
That was in the summer?

383
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:34,583
But, you Can still
do it. Right ?

384
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,041
Of course!

385
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:53,958
Stop! Right now!

386
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,208
You were about to
bend the spoon

387
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,458
using the edge of the
chair, weren't you...?

388
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:58,500
You do realize that

389
00:18:58,583 --> 00:18:59,750
if anyone caught you
doing that trick

390
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:01,625
they'd never
believe you again.

391
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:02,708
You're lying...!

392
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:04,208
I really can
bend a spoon!

393
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:06,125
Any researcher knows
that psychic abilities

394
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,833
can be affected by
outside sources

395
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,333
and are, therefore, unstable.

396
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:11,750
When you can't
do something,

397
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,958
it's okay to admit defeat.

398
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,416
The people who will
call you fake

399
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,250
never believe in
you in you anyway,

400
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,208
so don't worry
about what they think.

401
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,958
That's easy for
you to say...

402
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:22,333
but you don't have
to deal with

403
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:24,541
how mean people can be
if you can't do it.

404
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,416
Miss Kei was treated
horribly by the other teachers

405
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,708
just because she had
the nerve to defend me!

406
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,375
Oh, don't worry
about me...

407
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:31,625
please...

408
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:34,375
It's been incredibly
difficult to watch...

409
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:37,041
I felt so bad for how they
were acting toward her.

410
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,208
Then everyone in the
biology club quit.

411
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:41,916
Saying we must be doing
something crazy or evil...

412
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,625
I don't understand why
this is happening to me...

413
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,416
Is that why you
cursed them?

414
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,583
I'll curse you to death!!

415
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,416
Well, yeah...

416
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,041
I said that but c'mon,

417
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:55,250
it's not like I could really
do it, could I? !

418
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:56,625
Right?

419
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:05,125
Y'know, I actually kind
of feel sorry for Kasai...

420
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:06,791
All of this fear and
hatred over something

421
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,916
small like bending spoons.

422
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:16,541
Mai... I need to ask
a favor of you.

423
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,625
Did he say a favor??

424
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,000
I'd appreciate it
if you'd keep the

425
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:22,500
spoon-bending thing a
secret from the others...

426
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:24,000
especially Lin.

427
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:25,875
Oh this is totally
gonna kill me.

428
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,166
I wish I could
ask him why.

429
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:31,125
Sure, no prob...!
I won't tell...

430
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:32,083
I promise!

431
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:37,458
Thank you.

432
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:38,833
Oh my gosh!

433
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,791
This is Naru and I's
first private secret!

434
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,125
But that can't be true!

435
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,333
Well, it is.

436
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,416
I'm telling you there
are no spirits here.

437
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,291
I've looked all over
and if there were,

438
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:48,750
I would know by now.

439
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,291
Come on, there at least
has to be something

440
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,750
in that desk...

441
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,250
Don't forget about the
four accidents in a row!

442
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:57,000
There is some kind of deception
going on at this school.

443
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,208
Oh and I guess all
of the students

444
00:20:58,291 --> 00:20:59,583
and teachers are in on it? !

445
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:01,166
You gotta be kiddin' me!

446
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,083
Relax mate. Easy.

447
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:06,416
You know, Masako's theory
may not be accurate.

448
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,333
Well I'm certain it's
more accurate than yours,

449
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:09,958
Miss Matsuaki.

450
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:12,291
In fact, MISS
Matsuzaki, I wonder

451
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,833
if anything you've said
has ever been accurate?

452
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:15,750
Hey, you may be
able to see 'em

453
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:16,875
but can you exorcize...

454
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,500
Lin... let's get back to work.

455
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:20,291
Of course.

456
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:22,791
Hey, whaddya say we go
take another look around?

457
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:25,791
I'm right behind you.

458
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,666
You may wanna look
more closely this time.

459
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,041
It won't matter,
I'll still be right.

460
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,833
I'm having déjà vu.

461
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:39,416
So Masako doesn't think
there are any spirits,.

462
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,125
If that's true then why are all
of these things happening?

463
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,500
Uh-oh, snap out of it!

464
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,583
Naru'll freak if he catches
me sleeping in here...

465
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:03,666
Naru?

466
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:12,916
Fox fires.

467
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,250
Fox fires?!

468
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:29,125
[Music]

469
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:39,125
[Music]

470
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:49,166

[Music]

475
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:50,958
Next time on Ghost Hunt
we continue File 3

476
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:53,291
- "The After-school
Hexer" Part 2.

477
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:55,250
I just hope
there's no homework!
