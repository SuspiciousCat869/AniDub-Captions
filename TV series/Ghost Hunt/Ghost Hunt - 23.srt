1
00:00:27,434 --> 00:00:29,477
I never imagined that
anything this terrible

2
00:00:29,561 --> 00:00:31,146
could happen to Kazuya.

3
00:00:31,229 --> 00:00:32,480
Masako... can you tell

4
00:00:32,564 --> 00:00:34,524
what kind of spirit
is possessing him?

5
00:00:36,526 --> 00:00:39,279
It's hard to see clearly...
he's possessed by something

6
00:00:39,362 --> 00:00:41,281
but I don't know
what it is...

7
00:00:41,364 --> 00:00:44,409
maybe what we're dealing with,
is some kind of hollow spirit.

8
00:00:44,492 --> 00:00:46,036
What exactly
do you mean?

9
00:00:47,412 --> 00:00:50,373
They are colorless and
completely transparent.

10
00:00:50,457 --> 00:00:52,083
They don't
give off emotions,

11
00:00:52,167 --> 00:00:55,295
yet, they do tend to have
a very strong presence...

12
00:00:55,378 --> 00:00:58,173
It could also be that
something is interfering;

13
00:00:58,256 --> 00:00:59,966
attempting to block
us from finding out

14
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:01,301
the spirit's identity.

15
00:01:03,845 --> 00:01:06,139
She may be
irritating sometimes.

16
00:01:06,222 --> 00:01:09,267
Right now... I know
exactly how she feels.

17
00:01:09,351 --> 00:01:10,685
In any case

18
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:13,521
we have to find out the
spirit's identity and fast.

19
00:01:13,605 --> 00:01:15,106
Even with all of us
working together...

20
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:16,274
there's not
much we can do

21
00:01:16,358 --> 00:01:18,151
if we don't know
what we're up against.

22
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:29,287
[Music]

23
00:01:29,371 --> 00:01:39,297
[Music]

24
00:02:55,373 --> 00:02:58,460
I'll play back the video
footage from last night.

25
00:02:58,543 --> 00:03:00,879
Okay... that's
Hazuki's room.

26
00:03:00,962 --> 00:03:02,255
And next to that?

27
00:03:02,339 --> 00:03:03,965
The first floor hallway.

28
00:03:06,634 --> 00:03:07,635
White lights!

29
00:03:09,095 --> 00:03:10,847
There's more in
the hallway too.

30
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,682
Amazing.

31
00:03:12,766 --> 00:03:15,101
I'll pull up the room
that faces the cove now.

32
00:03:18,188 --> 00:03:20,190
Sure there are
a lot of them.

33
00:03:20,273 --> 00:03:22,359
Anyone notice they all
seem to be rising up.?

34
00:03:26,529 --> 00:03:27,989
Just like in my dream...

35
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:30,867
Is there any audio?

36
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:31,993
No. Nothing.

37
00:03:32,077 --> 00:03:34,162
Not even any vibrations...

38
00:03:34,245 --> 00:03:35,580
None of the gauges
seem to have picked up

39
00:03:35,663 --> 00:03:37,457
anything unusual either...

40
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,168
Except... the temperature
has dropped five degrees.

41
00:03:41,294 --> 00:03:43,004
Come in.

42
00:03:43,088 --> 00:03:44,631
Hey! I brought you
guys some coffee...

43
00:03:44,714 --> 00:03:45,965
sound good?

44
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:48,218
Thanks! You're
a life saver...

45
00:03:48,301 --> 00:03:49,135
No problem.

46
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,348
Hey um... so over by
the edge of the cove...

47
00:03:53,431 --> 00:03:55,058
I was wondering if you
knew of the cave there

48
00:03:55,141 --> 00:03:56,810
that has an old
shrine inside it?

49
00:03:58,603 --> 00:04:01,272
Also, do you know if there are
some old stone steps by the inn

50
00:04:01,356 --> 00:04:03,400
that go all the way down
to the bottom of the cliff?

51
00:04:03,483 --> 00:04:05,694
Oh no, you didn't go
down there did you!?

52
00:04:05,777 --> 00:04:07,654
Uh! Well...
Not exactly.

53
00:04:07,737 --> 00:04:08,905
Stay away from there...!

54
00:04:08,988 --> 00:04:11,741
Those steps are old
and extremely dangerous!

55
00:04:11,825 --> 00:04:13,743
Hey you two,
whats up...?

56
00:04:13,827 --> 00:04:15,745
Nothing but uh...

57
00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:17,497
it looks like I've
done it again...

58
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:22,544
I guess... these must be the
steps you saw in your dream?

59
00:04:22,627 --> 00:04:25,213
As far as I know,
they've been here forever.

60
00:04:25,296 --> 00:04:28,383
But they're falling apart so we
don't want to use them anymore.

61
00:04:28,466 --> 00:04:31,094
But it doesn't look like you can
see the cave from this angle.

62
00:04:31,177 --> 00:04:33,596
If we go over there to that
old tea house, you can.

63
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,140
From there, you can
see the whole cave...

64
00:04:35,223 --> 00:04:36,474
It's quite a view.

65
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,441
That's exactly what
I saw in my dream!

66
00:04:44,524 --> 00:04:45,608
So have you
guys seen enough

67
00:04:45,692 --> 00:04:47,068
or would you like
to keep going?

68
00:04:47,152 --> 00:04:48,361
Keep going.

69
00:04:48,445 --> 00:04:49,696
Now there aren't
any fences over here,

70
00:04:49,779 --> 00:04:51,406
so please, be careful.

71
00:04:54,034 --> 00:04:55,702
You're not afraid
of heights are you?

72
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,039
C'mon we're not
that high up...

73
00:04:59,122 --> 00:05:00,457
You kidding me?

74
00:05:00,749 --> 00:05:02,125
I was wondering, sir ...

75
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:04,336
Oh, you dont have
to call me sir...

76
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:06,796
It's not like I'm running
the place or anything ...

77
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,798
I just wanted to
ask you something.

78
00:05:08,882 --> 00:05:10,425
Those...
what are they?

79
00:05:13,094 --> 00:05:14,971
I really don't
know for sure.

80
00:05:15,055 --> 00:05:17,390
My grandfather always said
they were some kinda tombstones,

81
00:05:17,474 --> 00:05:18,641
Then he told
all of us kids

82
00:05:18,725 --> 00:05:20,310
that we should never
play around them ...

83
00:05:20,393 --> 00:05:22,062
Oh I see.

84
00:05:22,145 --> 00:05:23,897
What about those
ones...up there?

85
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,692
Oh yeah, those are
Okobu and Mekubo.

86
00:05:27,776 --> 00:05:29,361
The big one
is the man, Okobu,

87
00:05:29,444 --> 00:05:32,030
and the smaller one
is the woman, Mekubo...

88
00:05:32,113 --> 00:05:33,740
According to
local legend,

89
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:36,493
a long time ago...a man and
a woman jumped into the sea

90
00:05:36,576 --> 00:05:38,244
...and were turned
into these stones.

91
00:05:38,328 --> 00:05:40,038
They jumped
into the sea?

92
00:05:40,121 --> 00:05:41,289
Yeah.

93
00:05:41,373 --> 00:05:43,291
The legend says there
was a beautiful princess

94
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,919
who fell madly in love
with a local fisherman

95
00:05:46,836 --> 00:05:48,755
They would meet up secretly;

96
00:05:48,838 --> 00:05:51,091
trying to spend as much time
as they could together...

97
00:05:51,174 --> 00:05:53,218
But... as luck
would have it,

98
00:05:53,301 --> 00:05:55,261
she caught the eye of
the son of a nobleman

99
00:05:55,345 --> 00:05:58,431
who tried to force her
to marry him instead.!

100
00:05:58,515 --> 00:06:00,767
The princess... wanted
nothing to do with him

101
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,894
so she agreed to
elope with her lover.

102
00:06:02,977 --> 00:06:04,813
They wrote each other
letters to arrange a meeting

103
00:06:04,896 --> 00:06:07,357
but the nobleman's son found
them and switched them up...

104
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,317
The meeting
never took place.

105
00:06:09,401 --> 00:06:11,361
My dream.

106
00:06:11,444 --> 00:06:13,405
When the princess
realized the mistake...

107
00:06:13,488 --> 00:06:15,782
she hurried to find
her lover... but...

108
00:06:15,865 --> 00:06:18,326
when she got there, he had
already killed his rival...

109
00:06:20,078 --> 00:06:21,871
He left me no choice.

110
00:06:21,955 --> 00:06:23,331
But why...?

111
00:06:23,415 --> 00:06:25,166
There was nothing
I could do ...

112
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,419
he was waiting here
when I arrived ...

113
00:06:27,502 --> 00:06:29,421
so, of course I thought
you had betrayed me ...

114
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,507
How could you think
that I would do that?!

115
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,134
It made sense...
what other reason

116
00:06:34,217 --> 00:06:35,844
could there be for
him being here?

117
00:06:38,096 --> 00:06:40,932
You're the only one who knew
where we were going to meet.

118
00:06:41,016 --> 00:06:44,644
No, it's not like that...
the letters got mixed up.

119
00:06:44,728 --> 00:06:46,980
I ended up in a completely
different place.

120
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,280
It was too late
to do anything.

121
00:06:55,363 --> 00:06:57,574
The damage was
already done..

122
00:06:57,657 --> 00:07:00,243
Knowing there was no way out,
the lovers threw themselves..

123
00:07:00,326 --> 00:07:02,328
from this cave to die
together in the sea..

124
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,249
Then that means...

125
00:07:06,332 --> 00:07:07,792
I think of Naru as...

126
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,422
Oh... how embarrassing!

127
00:07:14,215 --> 00:07:16,885
The gods took pity on them and
transformed the young lovers

128
00:07:16,968 --> 00:07:19,512
into stones so that
they'd always be together.

129
00:07:19,596 --> 00:07:21,681
At least that's how
the legend goes anyway...

130
00:07:21,765 --> 00:07:23,183
Uh is there
something wrong?

131
00:07:23,266 --> 00:07:24,934
Uh! Oh... no...

132
00:07:25,018 --> 00:07:26,603
nothing at all.

133
00:07:26,686 --> 00:07:28,104
That's it...!

134
00:07:28,188 --> 00:07:29,939
That's why in the dream,
I thought we were supposed

135
00:07:30,023 --> 00:07:31,191
to be going
to the sea.

136
00:07:33,401 --> 00:07:36,821
So uh...is there
a shrine nearby?

137
00:07:36,905 --> 00:07:38,114
Yes there is...

138
00:07:38,198 --> 00:07:40,617
In fact, I can show it
to you if you want ...

139
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,035
Is this the one?

140
00:07:42,118 --> 00:07:45,622
Uhuh this is the one,
just like in my dream.

141
00:07:45,705 --> 00:07:48,124
Oh, wow... this is
a really nice shrine...

142
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:50,043
You guys keep
it very clean.

143
00:07:50,126 --> 00:07:51,544
You think so...?

144
00:07:51,628 --> 00:07:54,881
It's on the small side and
it doesn't even have a priest.

145
00:07:54,964 --> 00:07:57,592
My family has been taking care
of it for generations...

146
00:07:57,676 --> 00:08:00,053
we just kinda took it upon
ourselves to keep it clean.

147
00:08:00,136 --> 00:08:02,263
Actually my parents made me
do most of the cleaning.

148
00:08:02,347 --> 00:08:03,807
Oh yeah...

149
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,809
and I know that's really hard
work for a kid, isn't it...?

150
00:08:05,892 --> 00:08:07,602
My parents ran a temple
when I was little,

151
00:08:07,686 --> 00:08:08,853
and I had to clean it...

152
00:08:08,937 --> 00:08:10,730
in the winter, that water
can get pretty cold

153
00:08:10,814 --> 00:08:12,065
It sure can.

154
00:08:12,148 --> 00:08:14,275
I bet your parents ran
a shrine too huh...

155
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:16,611
so did you have to do all
the cleaning there as well?

156
00:08:16,695 --> 00:08:18,071
Oh no...

157
00:08:18,154 --> 00:08:19,698
My parents never
owned a shrine.

158
00:08:19,781 --> 00:08:21,700
Huh...?
They didn't?

159
00:08:21,783 --> 00:08:23,576
My parents are doctors.

160
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,869
What?! They're doctors?!

161
00:08:24,953 --> 00:08:27,080
So are you telling me
that you grew up rich?

162
00:08:27,163 --> 00:08:28,415
I guess so...

163
00:08:28,498 --> 00:08:31,167
They actually owned the
hospital that they ran.

164
00:08:31,251 --> 00:08:33,503
So yeah I guess you
could call us rich.

165
00:08:33,586 --> 00:08:37,132
Also, I was an only child so my
parents tended to spoil me a bit

166
00:08:37,215 --> 00:08:40,260
not only that but we had several
housekeepers to do all the work.

167
00:08:40,343 --> 00:08:43,221
so I never lifted a finger
to help out with anything.

168
00:08:43,304 --> 00:08:45,432
Well, that certainly
explains a lot.

169
00:08:46,891 --> 00:08:48,518
These stones here...
what are they for...?

170
00:08:48,601 --> 00:08:50,812
Oh! Those are
the sanroku mounds.

171
00:08:50,895 --> 00:08:52,355
Sanroku mounds?

172
00:08:52,439 --> 00:08:55,066
It means "three six mounds,"
but I don't know why...

173
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,735
maybe it's because
there are three here

174
00:08:56,818 --> 00:08:58,194
and six over
by the cape.

175
00:08:58,278 --> 00:09:00,363
Wait ... at the cape
there were only five.

176
00:09:02,323 --> 00:09:04,117
Right ... they said
there used to be six

177
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,827
but one of them
fell into the sea.

178
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,412
So around here... we
still refer to them

179
00:09:07,495 --> 00:09:09,039
as the six stones
at the cape.

180
00:09:10,707 --> 00:09:15,295
So three here... and six at the
cape make up the sanroku mounds.

181
00:09:15,378 --> 00:09:17,047
When you say mounds
you mean gravestones...

182
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,381
Do you think
that perhaps,

183
00:09:18,465 --> 00:09:19,716
the missing mound might
have something to do

184
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,718
with all the problems
your family's been having?

185
00:09:21,801 --> 00:09:23,970
Oh Of course!

186
00:09:24,054 --> 00:09:26,222
See, the mounds...
are the foxes' graves!

187
00:09:26,306 --> 00:09:27,474
It all makes sense!

188
00:09:27,557 --> 00:09:29,601
You mean like the fox
spirit that possessed

189
00:09:29,684 --> 00:09:31,353
Eijiro and... Naru?

190
00:09:31,436 --> 00:09:33,313
That's right...! When
they built the inn...

191
00:09:33,396 --> 00:09:35,565
they must've destroyed a
fox's grave and that's how,

192
00:09:35,648 --> 00:09:37,025
the curse began!

193
00:09:37,108 --> 00:09:38,109
Okay. Slow down.

194
00:09:39,486 --> 00:09:42,781
Heh ... you know Naru
will tell that you anyway.

195
00:09:42,864 --> 00:09:44,991
What do you think Masako?

196
00:09:45,075 --> 00:09:47,243
I'm sorry but I didn't sense
any presence of animals

197
00:09:47,327 --> 00:09:48,828
at the inn
or the mounds...

198
00:09:48,912 --> 00:09:51,081
of course spirits
will lie sometimes...

199
00:09:51,164 --> 00:09:52,749
many times they will
take the form of animals

200
00:09:52,832 --> 00:09:55,877
so that they can better disguise
themselves from humans.

201
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,922
So do you think our fox
was just a disguise?

202
00:09:59,005 --> 00:10:00,090
Perhaps.

203
00:10:00,173 --> 00:10:01,716
Get anything else?

204
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,511
I feel the presence
of many spirits.

205
00:10:04,594 --> 00:10:07,430
I'm not entirely sure
about what they are...

206
00:10:07,514 --> 00:10:09,641
But I believe they're some
type of drifting spirits...

207
00:10:09,724 --> 00:10:11,142
It's odd...

208
00:10:11,226 --> 00:10:13,395
I'm getting mixed
signals from this place.

209
00:10:13,478 --> 00:10:16,314
It doesn't feel good but
it doesn't feel bad either.

210
00:10:17,857 --> 00:10:19,901
This doesn't look
like a bad place.

211
00:10:19,984 --> 00:10:22,362
Or a good place
for that matter.

212
00:10:22,445 --> 00:10:25,657
Almost like ... some
kind of sacred ground.

213
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,077
I once visited a sacred
Native American site.

214
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,662
I'm getting the same
impression here

215
00:10:30,745 --> 00:10:32,330
that I got there.

216
00:10:32,414 --> 00:10:35,583
That it's a holy place
guarded by spirits.

217
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:37,335
A spirit passage?

218
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:40,588
So Did Naru tell you
that in the dream too?

219
00:10:40,672 --> 00:10:42,590
Spirits drift
into this place...

220
00:10:42,674 --> 00:10:46,469
maybe it's an area that they
can't resist being drawn to.

221
00:10:46,553 --> 00:10:48,680
Well, Mai if what
you're saying is true...

222
00:10:48,763 --> 00:10:51,641
It kinda makes sense, because
supposedly back in the old days

223
00:10:51,725 --> 00:10:54,769
the bodies of people who died at
sea were drawn to this shore...

224
00:10:54,853 --> 00:10:56,896
that's the reason they
built this shrine here...

225
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:00,817
and, more recently, it's
where our dogs drifted ashore.

226
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,527
Okay then...
that settles it.

227
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,821
Looks like we're gonna have
to check out that cave now.

228
00:11:06,573 --> 00:11:09,951
I see... so there's a way to
get in from the shore side too.

229
00:11:10,035 --> 00:11:12,954
Yeah this way is a whole lot
safer than those old stairs.

230
00:11:13,038 --> 00:11:15,081
Well I guess we should
go in and take a look.

231
00:11:24,716 --> 00:11:26,009
Is that the shrine?

232
00:11:26,092 --> 00:11:27,344
Uhuh...

233
00:11:27,427 --> 00:11:30,764
Except that, in my dream
it looked really warped.

234
00:11:30,847 --> 00:11:32,682
Masako... You getting anything?

235
00:11:32,766 --> 00:11:34,392
Yes, quite a bit.

236
00:11:34,476 --> 00:11:37,312
It's just like the
Native American sites.

237
00:11:37,395 --> 00:11:39,814
There are spirits drifting
in even as we speak.

238
00:11:41,983 --> 00:11:43,943
Akifumi...

239
00:11:44,027 --> 00:11:46,112
Do you have any idea
what this thing in here is?

240
00:11:46,196 --> 00:11:48,323
Ah, I see...
you've found Okobu.

241
00:11:48,406 --> 00:11:52,452
Okobu...? You mean
as in Okobu and Mekubu?

242
00:11:52,535 --> 00:11:55,789
Right, but instead of a rock,
this is a piece of driftwood.

243
00:11:55,872 --> 00:11:57,040
It's a head
and a hand.

244
00:11:57,123 --> 00:12:00,085
-Sort of like a person.
-Oh! A yebisu...

245
00:12:00,168 --> 00:12:03,088
My parents' temple had
some in similar poses.

246
00:12:03,171 --> 00:12:04,798
Yeah...

247
00:12:04,881 --> 00:12:07,717
They keep this yebisu enshrined
here as a token of big fortune.

248
00:12:07,801 --> 00:12:09,052
So that's Okobu.

249
00:12:23,358 --> 00:12:25,151
The tide doesn't
come in too far...

250
00:12:25,235 --> 00:12:27,028
I guess this will
be okay right here.

251
00:12:27,112 --> 00:12:28,196
I'm surprised... but,
it looks like

252
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:30,198
the cables will actually
reach down here.

253
00:12:30,281 --> 00:12:31,825
So I guess we will
be able to get

254
00:12:31,908 --> 00:12:33,034
some footage in
here after all.

255
00:12:34,619 --> 00:12:36,204
What's a yebisu?

256
00:12:36,287 --> 00:12:38,039
Basically... it just
means something

257
00:12:38,123 --> 00:12:39,416
that is washed up
on the shore.

258
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:43,503
Whenever anything unusual
from the sea washed up,

259
00:12:43,586 --> 00:12:45,588
it was considered to be
a sign of good luck.

260
00:12:47,465 --> 00:12:50,176
In Buddhism, it's said that
there's a grand paradise

261
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,263
far to the west...
called Saiho Jodo.

262
00:12:53,346 --> 00:12:56,474
Also, according to ancient
Japanese mythology,

263
00:12:56,558 --> 00:12:58,685
there is a land of eternal
youth that lies somewhere

264
00:12:58,768 --> 00:13:00,437
far beyond the seas.

265
00:13:01,688 --> 00:13:03,732
So they believed that anything
that came from the sea,

266
00:13:03,815 --> 00:13:06,026
had some sort
of special powers.

267
00:13:06,109 --> 00:13:07,819
That's a yebisu.

268
00:13:07,902 --> 00:13:10,155
So then, the Okobu
inside the cave...

269
00:13:10,238 --> 00:13:13,241
That's right, it must be
a yebisu as well...

270
00:13:13,324 --> 00:13:15,535
It probably washed
up on the beach...

271
00:13:17,037 --> 00:13:19,622
And when they noticed it
looked like a statue of Buddha,

272
00:13:19,706 --> 00:13:20,790
they enshrined it.

273
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,877
Yebisu...

274
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,587
something from the sea.

275
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:28,673
This is a place that
souls drift into.

276
00:13:28,757 --> 00:13:30,425
The cave.

277
00:13:30,508 --> 00:13:32,552
The sacred ground.

278
00:13:32,635 --> 00:13:34,304
The shrine...

279
00:13:34,387 --> 00:13:36,598
and the mounds.

280
00:13:36,681 --> 00:13:39,351
The rocks and the legend of
two lovers who threw themselves

281
00:13:39,434 --> 00:13:40,894
into the sea...

282
00:13:40,977 --> 00:13:44,689
I never heard the legend
until Akifumi told us...

283
00:13:44,773 --> 00:13:48,318
and yet... it was
all in the dream.

284
00:13:48,401 --> 00:13:50,278
All I did was simply
show you the path

285
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:52,530
to guide you to this point.

286
00:13:52,614 --> 00:13:55,075
If Naru was guiding me, then
there must have been something

287
00:13:55,158 --> 00:13:58,078
about the legend
he wanted me to know.

288
00:13:58,161 --> 00:14:00,705
It must have something
to do with this case...

289
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:09,005
But in my dream, we
didn't go to the sea.

290
00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:13,385
We went to the shrine, where we
were surrounded by an angry mob.

291
00:14:13,468 --> 00:14:16,596
Even then I was wondering
why we didn't go to the sea.

292
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,807
I knew we belonged there.

293
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:22,060
And then Eijiro appeared
carrying a katana.

294
00:14:22,143 --> 00:14:24,187
I shall curse you
from beyond the grave!

295
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,605
You will not escape me!

296
00:14:35,949 --> 00:14:37,784
-What's the matter?
-Something terrible's happened!

297
00:14:37,867 --> 00:14:39,244
It's... it's my brother!

298
00:14:41,496 --> 00:14:43,289
Oh my god!

299
00:14:43,373 --> 00:14:45,959
-Akifumi! Call an ambulance!
-I already did!

300
00:14:46,042 --> 00:14:47,919
Get that side!

301
00:14:48,003 --> 00:14:49,546
Come on man
stay with us!

302
00:14:50,463 --> 00:14:52,007
Oh miss?

303
00:14:56,845 --> 00:14:58,596
Oh... hi kids!

304
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,808
Is Uncle Yashi dead?

305
00:15:01,891 --> 00:15:05,020
Well... is he?
Is he dead yet?

306
00:15:05,103 --> 00:15:07,230
What's wrong
with these kids...

307
00:15:07,313 --> 00:15:08,732
Don't worry. There's
an ambulance

308
00:15:08,815 --> 00:15:11,943
on its way here right now.

309
00:15:12,027 --> 00:15:13,445
I guess he's
still alive.

310
00:15:13,528 --> 00:15:14,195
Oh well...

311
00:15:25,248 --> 00:15:27,375
Ever since
grandfather's funeral,

312
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:29,919
I've been hearing these
voices telling me to...

313
00:15:30,003 --> 00:15:32,630
telling me to
kill the family.

314
00:15:32,714 --> 00:15:34,257
It gets worse...
because every night

315
00:15:34,341 --> 00:15:36,134
I've been killing you
all in my dreams...

316
00:15:36,217 --> 00:15:37,719
Katsuki, Hazuki, Wakako.

317
00:15:37,802 --> 00:15:39,262
All of you.

318
00:15:39,346 --> 00:15:41,222
And then I realized that
if it kept going like this,

319
00:15:41,306 --> 00:15:43,183
I was really going
to do it some day.

320
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:48,980
He said, he planned to
take his own life in hopes

321
00:15:49,064 --> 00:15:51,524
of preventing that from
happening to the rest of us.

322
00:15:51,608 --> 00:15:53,026
And if we had gotten
there any later,

323
00:15:53,109 --> 00:15:54,778
he would have really
done it too...

324
00:15:54,861 --> 00:15:56,446
this is all our fault.

325
00:15:56,529 --> 00:15:59,574
I'm sorry that we haven't
been able to figure this out.

326
00:15:59,657 --> 00:16:02,619
Oh no... If we had never hired
you guys in the first place...

327
00:16:02,702 --> 00:16:05,121
then your boss, wouldn't be
in the condition he's in now.

328
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:12,087
Lin, you left your shiki
around Naru, right?

329
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,338
That's right.

330
00:16:13,421 --> 00:16:15,465
Would you know if any
spirits came near him?

331
00:16:15,548 --> 00:16:17,050
Yes I would.

332
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:19,761
Well... how about if a spirit
left him, would you know that?

333
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:24,057
Without a doubt, but there
isn't a spirit that exists

334
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,434
that can leave him as long
as that spell is intact...

335
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:30,397
So... what does that mean?

336
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,065
It means there's more than
one spirit in this house,

337
00:16:32,148 --> 00:16:33,316
doesn't it?

338
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,318
So you think... that
Yashitaka was possessed

339
00:16:35,402 --> 00:16:37,153
by a different spirit?

340
00:16:37,237 --> 00:16:39,322
That's the only
answer I can see.

341
00:16:39,406 --> 00:16:40,990
In that case, we should
definitely check out

342
00:16:41,074 --> 00:16:43,326
the rest of the
family and fast.

343
00:16:44,661 --> 00:16:46,121
She clear?

344
00:16:46,204 --> 00:16:48,581
I do sense the
presence of a spirit,

345
00:16:48,665 --> 00:16:50,750
but it's the same
as with Naru...

346
00:16:50,834 --> 00:16:52,544
It is the same
hollow feeling.

347
00:16:52,627 --> 00:16:54,504
I don't detect a great
deal of bitterness,

348
00:16:54,587 --> 00:16:56,256
or any kind of grudge...

349
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:59,217
But then... I can't
rule out the possibility

350
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,428
she may be possessed
by an evil spirit...

351
00:17:01,511 --> 00:17:03,972
-John?
-Yeah... what is it?

352
00:17:04,055 --> 00:17:07,058
Do an exorcism on her...
then do one on Yashitaka

353
00:17:07,142 --> 00:17:09,477
at the hospital
just in case, okay?

354
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:11,187
Okay, I'm on it.

355
00:17:17,235 --> 00:17:19,112
In the beginning...
there was the word.

356
00:17:19,195 --> 00:17:21,364
-I'm scared.
-Don't worry, it'll be okay.

357
00:17:21,448 --> 00:17:24,117
And the Word, it was
God... what's wrong?

358
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,702
I'm sorry...I can't
watch this anymore.

359
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:32,584
Ayako, make us some charms,
we'll need enough for us...

360
00:17:32,667 --> 00:17:35,295
and the entire family,
as quickly as you can.

361
00:17:35,378 --> 00:17:36,838
Okay.

362
00:17:36,921 --> 00:17:38,006
I'm going to be
out for a bit...

363
00:17:38,089 --> 00:17:40,133
-Akifumi?
-Uh yes sir?

364
00:17:40,216 --> 00:17:43,011
Could you do me a favor and take
me back to your family's temple?

365
00:17:44,304 --> 00:17:45,680
No thank you.

366
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:47,265
You sure...?

367
00:17:47,349 --> 00:17:49,184
See, this is a charm that will
keep the evil spirits

368
00:17:49,267 --> 00:17:51,144
away from you... but...
it doesn't work unless,

369
00:17:51,227 --> 00:17:53,188
you keep it somewhere
on your person.

370
00:17:53,271 --> 00:17:56,816
I see ... but what happens
if I decide to take a bath?

371
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,444
I can't take it with me,
can I? It's just paper.

372
00:17:59,527 --> 00:18:01,363
Well, yeah that's true but...

373
00:18:01,446 --> 00:18:02,989
Then I guess ...
I'll be passing.

374
00:18:03,073 --> 00:18:05,033
-Thanks.
-Hold on a second. Yoko...!

375
00:18:07,285 --> 00:18:10,205
-I don't want it!
-Hey, wait up!

376
00:18:10,288 --> 00:18:12,791
C'mon...! They're important!

377
00:18:12,874 --> 00:18:15,335
We don't want 'em!

378
00:18:15,418 --> 00:18:18,088
Why are they being
so stubborn about this?

379
00:18:18,171 --> 00:18:19,005
Oh no...

380
00:18:20,382 --> 00:18:23,760
Hey Wakako! Did you know
that your uncle died...?

381
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:28,014
-Really?
-Wonderful!

382
00:18:28,098 --> 00:18:30,517
My god ...
I knew it!

383
00:18:32,143 --> 00:18:34,062
Afraid so...and
so did Akifumi.

384
00:18:34,145 --> 00:18:35,855
Wow! Uncle Aki died too?

385
00:18:35,939 --> 00:18:37,232
Did he drive his car?

386
00:18:38,233 --> 00:18:40,193
Alright! What did
you do to his car?

387
00:18:40,276 --> 00:18:41,403
-Stop it!
-Let go of me!

388
00:18:41,486 --> 00:18:43,905
Mai, what's going on?

389
00:18:43,988 --> 00:18:45,156
Get back here!

390
00:18:45,907 --> 00:18:47,742
You let her
go right now!

391
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:50,328
Not until you tell me
what you did to his car!

392
00:18:50,412 --> 00:18:51,996
Let go!

393
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,582
Ayako...! Make Wakako
hold this charm okay?

394
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:57,043
Stop it! You leave
her alone...! now!

395
00:18:57,127 --> 00:18:59,421
Not until you tell me
about the car...!

396
00:18:59,504 --> 00:19:02,298
otherwise, I'm going to stick
this charm on Wakako so hard!

397
00:19:02,382 --> 00:19:03,967
It'll never come off!

398
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:05,885
If you do, then I'll
jump into the sea...

399
00:19:05,969 --> 00:19:07,470
How does that sound
to you, miss...?

400
00:19:07,554 --> 00:19:09,097
Listen to me...!

401
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,933
Do you even have the slightest
idea what you're talking about?

402
00:19:14,102 --> 00:19:16,521
Well, if I die...
That'll show 'em.

403
00:19:16,604 --> 00:19:18,356
And just who
will it show, huh?

404
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:22,152
Them all.

405
00:19:23,361 --> 00:19:26,865
I was right... the
spirits have him too.

406
00:19:26,948 --> 00:19:29,492
And it's not hollow
like Masako said...

407
00:19:29,576 --> 00:19:32,537
this one is definitely
holding a grudge...

408
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,956
Alright! Tell me
who you really are!

409
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,876
You're not Katsuki... are you?

410
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:40,045
I'm going to
kill you miss.

411
00:19:40,128 --> 00:19:43,840
Not just you ... everyone in
this house is going to die...

412
00:19:43,923 --> 00:19:46,801
including this
little boy ...

413
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:49,596
Of course, drowning in
the sea would be merciful,

414
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,139
not nearly as bad...

415
00:19:51,222 --> 00:19:53,475
as someone chopping off
your head, don't you think?

416
00:19:53,558 --> 00:19:54,976
Chopping off your head?

417
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:59,064
Or having...the people you
love betray your trust ...

418
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:02,442
So tell me...! Did they
chase you to the shrine

419
00:20:02,525 --> 00:20:04,152
and then kill you
there in cold blood?

420
00:20:05,487 --> 00:20:07,906
Did the people of this
house do it to you...?

421
00:20:07,989 --> 00:20:09,532
Is that why
you hate them?

422
00:20:09,616 --> 00:20:11,034
Maybe...

423
00:20:11,117 --> 00:20:13,203
Come out of that
boy right now!

424
00:20:13,286 --> 00:20:16,039
Don't worry, I'll
leave when he dies.

425
00:20:16,122 --> 00:20:17,999
By then, I should
be done with him!

426
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:20,919
No wait...!

427
00:20:21,002 --> 00:20:22,962
Dharmic power
is very risky.

428
00:20:23,046 --> 00:20:25,215
When you try to touch
someone directly with it,

429
00:20:25,298 --> 00:20:27,008
anything can happen.

430
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:28,176
I've gotta
stop him.!

431
00:20:29,969 --> 00:20:32,889
I was trying to drive a
spirit out of an urn...

432
00:20:32,972 --> 00:20:34,933
I managed to get
the spirit out...

433
00:20:35,016 --> 00:20:36,601
but the urn was
completely shattered.

434
00:20:38,978 --> 00:20:41,231
Monk is a real
spiritualist...

435
00:20:41,314 --> 00:20:42,649
I'm not as powerful.

436
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,028
Rin! Pyo! Toh! Sha!

437
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:49,823
Kai! Jin!
Retsu! Zai! Zen!

438
00:20:57,914 --> 00:20:59,165
What was that...?

439
00:21:02,877 --> 00:21:04,212
Oh Katsuki!

440
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,054
I can't believe this!

441
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:14,597
After I told you how
dangerous it was!

442
00:21:14,681 --> 00:21:16,099
-But he...
-No buts!

443
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:26,443
Look, I know you have great
talent but just be careful.

444
00:21:26,526 --> 00:21:28,737
You should avoid using
the nine cuts on anyone

445
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,822
no matter what
the circumstance is.

446
00:21:30,905 --> 00:21:32,782
I know and
I'm sorry.

447
00:21:32,866 --> 00:21:34,617
Well anyway...we checked
on the car and found out

448
00:21:34,701 --> 00:21:37,829
that it was leaking
brake fluid pretty badly.

449
00:21:37,912 --> 00:21:39,289
If someone had tried
to take it anywhere,

450
00:21:39,372 --> 00:21:40,540
without knowing about it...

451
00:21:40,623 --> 00:21:42,083
they would have been
in serious trouble..

452
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:43,793
Do you think...
the kids did it?

453
00:21:43,877 --> 00:21:45,378
We can't be sure...

454
00:21:45,462 --> 00:21:47,380
I mean ... even if the
kids were possessed...

455
00:21:47,464 --> 00:21:49,591
it just doesn't
seem possible...

456
00:21:49,674 --> 00:21:52,594
All right! I wanna know which
one of you hurt the children?!

457
00:21:52,677 --> 00:21:54,763
And who made them carry
those horrible things?!

458
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:56,473
What do you mean?

459
00:21:56,556 --> 00:21:59,225
I'm talking about those
useless charms you gave them.

460
00:21:59,309 --> 00:22:02,562
I demand that you take
those away from them!

461
00:22:02,645 --> 00:22:06,441
I'm afraid that we haven't
solved anything in this case.

462
00:22:06,524 --> 00:22:09,027
All we have done...
is served as a trigger.

463
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,862
We've managed to
set the spirits off,

464
00:22:10,945 --> 00:22:14,115
and made them more
violent than ever.

465
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:15,158
And now...

466
00:22:27,462 --> 00:22:37,430
[Music]

467
00:22:37,514 --> 00:22:47,440
[Music]

468
00:24:00,347 --> 00:24:01,598
Next time on
Ghost Hunt,

469
00:24:01,681 --> 00:24:03,308
"The Cursed House"
Part Three.

470
00:24:03,391 --> 00:24:05,018
Looks like things
are getting worse!
