1
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,791
Mai...? What's wrong?

2
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:26,583
I was so scared...

3
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:28,583
I really thought
I was gonna die.

4
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:30,041
Hey...!

5
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:30,875
Open up!

6
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,333
Is everything
okay in here...?

7
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:35,166
What happened Mai?

8
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:37,916
A dream...

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,625
Actually more
of a nightmare.

10
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:41,750
So was it, one
of those dreams?

11
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:44,583
Yeah I think so.

12
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:45,875
Can you tell us
what happened?

13
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:48,541
I dreamt...

14
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,458
that I was being...

15
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:51,208
killed...

16
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:53,291
Two men came in...

17
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:56,791
And they dragged me
to a strange room...

18
00:00:56,875 --> 00:00:58,416
covered with tiles.

19
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:01,500
And then...

20
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:04,916
when they cut me...

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,041
it felt like there
was a thin trail of ice

22
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:08,791
over the skin
on my neck...

23
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:11,333
blood...

24
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:12,916
That's enough.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,750
I didn't mean for
you to relive it.

26
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:19,708
Naru.

27
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:32,916
This tea smells so good.

28
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,458
I feel much better now.

29
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:41,291
You okay?

30
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:43,458
Yeah, I'll be fine...

31
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:44,666
Thank you.

32
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:51,833
[Music]

33
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,416
I can't stop...

34
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,541
thinking about
that nightmare.

35
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,458
What does everyone think
about this theory...?

36
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:36,625
We know there's a chance

37
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,833
that Suzuki and Atsugi
have passed on...

38
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:41,125
Could your dream have been
an accurate representation

39
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:43,916
of what they suffered at the
hands of this unknown killer?

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,333
A dream that's...
telepathic?

41
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:49,166
If that's the case,then they've
both been murdered... right?

42
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,250
This may sound crazy...

43
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:53,083
but is there any chance
the people working here

44
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,958
-are up to something?
-Huh?

45
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:57,000
Just look at the
situation...

46
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:58,958
The employees have been
working here for a full week

47
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:00,625
and nothing's
happened to them...

48
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,083
yet we've been here
for three days...

49
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:03,916
and two people have
already disappeared.

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,458
Now that you mention it,

51
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:08,291
no one directly associated with
the house has disappeared.

52
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,958
So only outsiders are
the ones being affected...

53
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,500
Huh.

54
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:14,041
What about this...?

55
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,708
Is it possible the spirits
prefer people of a certain age?

56
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:19,000
All of the staff are
of the older persuasion

57
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,125
yet everyone who's
disappeared has been younger.

58
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:26,208
Nice work...

59
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:27,875
Yasu, Mai.

60
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:31,125
Make sure you're never
alone while in this house.

61
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:32,166
Priestess...

62
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,291
How much faith can
I entrust in you?

63
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:35,791
What do you mean by that?

64
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,375
It's become very
dangerous here

65
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,708
and Yasu is unable
to defend himself.

66
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,166
I need people
I can rely on

67
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,416
to protect him under
any circumstances.

68
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,208
Okay I understand.

69
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,291
So, to what extent
can I count on you?

70
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:49,916
Just some warding magic.

71
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,375
That's not good enough...

72
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,375
Miss Matsuzaki
and Miss Hara...

73
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,500
You two cannot leave
each other's sight.

74
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:57,833
I know you focus mainly
on being a medium,

75
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:00,041
but you can at least
protect yourself, right?

76
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,250
I can.

77
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:02,333
Monk. John.

78
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:03,750
The two of you
will protect Yasu.

79
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,541
-Got it.
-Right.

80
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:08,291
But... Who'll protect Mai...

81
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,750
Unless...

82
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,833
Lin will be protecting Mai.

83
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:14,250
But Naru, who will be
looking out for you?

84
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:17,000
Don't forget you can't
perform warding magic.

85
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:18,875
That's right.

86
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:21,541
I always forget Naru
isn't a spiritualist...

87
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,250
He's a paranormal
researcher.

88
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:25,458
What're you gonna do?

89
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:26,666
I'll manage.

90
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,916
You're out
of your mind!

91
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,208
You need to have
some protection.

92
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:32,208
Takigawa will
cover Yasu...

93
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,916
And Father Brown will be
protecting Mai, alright?

94
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,666
Monk can't
handle it alone.

95
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,625
Hey man! I'm
not an amatuer.

96
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:41,041
I don't think you
understand the danger here.

97
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:42,500
Then send one
of them away.

98
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:45,333
I cannot allow you to
be alone in this house.

99
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:47,583
If you were to come
to harm while on a job,

100
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:50,000
how would you expect me to
explain it to the Professor?

101
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,333
The Professor?

102
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:55,041
Think of how your parents
would feel if that happened!

103
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:57,875
Wait, are Naru's
parent's professors?

104
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,833
Lin... If you don't like

105
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:02,500
how I conduct my
investigation then leave.

106
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,500
How quickly you
seem to forget...

107
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:07,416
My main objective is to
protect you at all costs.

108
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:11,041
Protect him...? Wha...

109
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:13,083
What is Lin
talking about?

110
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,875
Is he Naru's bodyguard?

111
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,125
I'll volunteer.

112
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:22,375
This house is built up
higher at its center...

113
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:24,583
The floors on the first
level slope upwards

114
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:25,666
towards the center,

115
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,208
leaving it about
two meters higher

116
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:28,708
than the perimeter
of the structure.

117
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:31,916
Judging from the
placement of the windows,

118
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,791
it looks like the
owner added rooms

119
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:36,916
and increased the overall
size outward from the center.

120
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,458
That's about everything
we know up to this point.

121
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:42,416
What we don't know is what's
inside this empty section.

122
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,541
If it's a hidden
room it's gigantic.

123
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:46,500
But... we've
searched all over

124
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,583
and there doesn't seem
to be a way inside.

125
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:51,250
What if the way
inside doesn't exist?

126
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:52,416
Huh?

127
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,666
What if this area

128
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,625
wasn't originally
intended to be hidden,

129
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,041
but was sealed later?

130
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,625
Why would they do that?

131
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:01,875
If we assume the structure was
built from the inside out...

132
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,875
it must have had a
purpose at some time.

133
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:06,833
I can't see a
logical explanation

134
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:09,166
of why they would continue
to build on top of the room

135
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,458
if they didn't
want to hide it.

136
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:11,916
Yes... you're right.

137
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,875
What could
they be hiding?

138
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:16,833
We'll find out as soon as we
open up a few of those walls.

139
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,041
Hey everyone.

140
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:24,041
We have some new
information for you.

141
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:24,833
Yasu!

142
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:29,000
I thought I told you it was
too dangerous to come here.

143
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:29,916
Don't worry
about me.

144
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,333
I'm just here to assist.

145
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:32,541
And Besides...

146
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:34,666
it's perfectly safe
outside the house...

147
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,208
They've even got a little
playground out there.

148
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,208
Really, a playground?

149
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,791
Yeah. The backyard for
this house is huge...

150
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,708
Before all these incidents
started happening,

151
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,958
the kids in the neighborhood
would use it to play soccer.

152
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:50,416
But none... of those
children ever went missing.

153
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,041
Proving the danger only
lies within the house.

154
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:56,958
Oh! I noticed something strange
about the house from outside.

155
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:58,833
It's the number
of chimneys...

156
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,916
When we were investigating
the place earlier,

157
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,166
I believe we found either
ten or eleven fireplaces.

158
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,458
There are eleven.

159
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,875
But if you look here
there are twelve chimneys.

160
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,458
You're right.

161
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,125
There's an extra one.

162
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:13,458
And as you can see, the
extra chimney is round,

163
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:16,458
much thicker, and made of
brick instead of plaster.

164
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:17,750
That's right above the
part of the house

165
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,125
with the hidden space.

166
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,833
There is definitely
something there.

167
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:22,958
But what?

168
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:28,250
We also have more
info about Kaneyuki...

169
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,500
Apparently his health condition
had been quite fragile

170
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:31,833
ever since childhood.

171
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:33,416
When he was young
he was told

172
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,083
that the chances of him
living a full life were slim.

173
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:38,000
He then traveled
extensively abroad

174
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:41,208
and had foreign doctors examine
him for second opinions.

175
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:44,166
Also... soon after Kaneyuki
moved into the house...

176
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,083
he kept two employees
with him at all times.

177
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,416
Two of them?

178
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:53,791
At the time...

179
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:56,125
there was a room detached
from the main house...

180
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:59,541
The two were connected via
a complicated maze of hedges.

181
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,041
The gardeners that
maintained the grounds,

182
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,708
said the maze
was so creepy

183
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,791
they avoided working there
as often as possible.

184
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,958
They also said the detached
room had a putrid smell,

185
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:12,750
and that the staff was
constantly changing.

186
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,666
Did you find out anything
about the relationship

187
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,750
between Kaneyuki and Urado?

188
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,083
As a matter of fact I did.

189
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,875
Urado was an assumed
name he often went by.

190
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,750
I don't want
to hear anymore.

191
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:32,791
I can't...

192
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,625
I can't take it anymore.

193
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,708
You okay?

194
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,708
Mai.

195
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,125
Not this person...

196
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,416
She's incapable
of saving you...

197
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:51,458
Remember, you're
already dead.

198
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:52,833
Now... come out...

199
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,541
Don't be frightened,
just look for the light

200
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,833
and walk towards it...

201
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:58,666
And then you will
find some peace.

202
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:02,916
Thanks.

203
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,416
Since we were
talking about them,

204
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,166
one of the spirits trapped
in the house possessed you...

205
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,833
I believe it was one
of the staff members

206
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,625
we were just discussing.

207
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,416
She was the one...

208
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,458
The one who was killed
in my dream last night.

209
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,875
You saw the
spirit's memories?

210
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:19,833
She must have
been so scared...

211
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:21,791
being murdered like that.

212
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,875
So the spirits of those
murdered in the same way

213
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,750
are still wandering
the house.

214
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,958
Those really were
the voices of spirits.

215
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,666
What's happening...?

216
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,666
I've never heard anyting
as horrible as this before!

217
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:56,083
Naru!

218
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,000
Don't move.

219
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,958
Is... that blood?

220
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,791
It's everywhere!

221
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,166
Did the spirits do this?

222
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:13,916
Naru!

223
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,083
Urado's name is there.

224
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:19,833
Look! It's over here, too!

225
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:26,125
Who's that?

226
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:27,750
Come on, Yasu.
Let's move.

227
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,500
Right.

228
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:30,625
Be careful guys.

229
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:35,583
Everyone okay...?

230
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,666
It looks like this
room has got it as well.

231
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,083
I don't know how it happened

232
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,583
but a strange writing just
appeared on the walls.

233
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,083
It looks like blood.

234
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,875
Just how many spirits
are in this house?

235
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,125
The name Urado appears
to be more important

236
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:53,791
than I originally thought.

237
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,416
I doubt it's a
simple alias.

238
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:57,916
If only we knew
what it meant.

239
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:00,208
Miss Hara...

240
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,916
Do you feel up to
performing a séance tonight?

241
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,541
Yes, of course.

242
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,000
Wait a minute...!

243
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,250
You're talking about
allowing a spirit

244
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,083
to possess Masako,
aren't you...?

245
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:11,458
You can't do that...

246
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:12,708
What if she has to go

247
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:15,000
through the same kind
of terror I experienced?

248
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,750
Miss Hara is
a professional.

249
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,166
Do you know what it's
like to feel like

250
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,375
you're being murdered...?

251
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:21,791
Do you have any idea

252
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,333
how frightening the moment
of a painful death can be?

253
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:27,125
I'm sorry but I won't allow
Masako to take part in a séance!

254
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:28,000
Not here!

255
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,416
So...

256
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,083
You leave me no
other choice.

257
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:34,166
We'll have to try
something else.

258
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,583
You want a
shot at it Lin?

259
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:36,750
Yes I do.

260
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:37,666
You sure?

261
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,875
Don't worry Mai...

262
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,708
What I will do
is called shokon,

263
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:42,791
and it can only
summon the spirits.

264
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:45,125
What is this "shokon?"

265
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:48,500
It's a method derived from
Chinese wugu shamanism...

266
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,250
I believe you need to have
certain information

267
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,208
about the spirit
you want to summon,

268
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,625
such as their name
and birth date.

269
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,375
I can only summon
Suzuki and Atsugi now...

270
00:12:57,458 --> 00:13:00,208
That is of course assuming
they have indeed passed on.

271
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:01,291
Sounds good...

272
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:02,083
Now Let's go.

273
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,958
What was with that
look on Naru's face?

274
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:11,791
For some reason I feel like
I may have offended him.

275
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:26,791
What about the
date of death?

276
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:29,250
The day after she
disappeared...

277
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:30,791
That's my best guess.

278
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,541
Wow...

279
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,958
What a pretty sound!

280
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:58,500
Is Lin doing that?

281
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,375
Something just blew
on that candle!

282
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:17,416
Suzuki!

283
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,958
You are Naoko
Suzuki, right?

284
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,625
You are no longer
of this world...

285
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,125
Were you aware of that?

286
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,916
She doesn't realize
that she's dead.

287
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,000
Do you know
why you died?

288
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:40,041
Did anyone commit a
vile act against you?

289
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,125
I see...

290
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,291
Was it Urado?

291
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:50,791
You know him,
don't you?

292
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:00,041
Naru... We're out of time.

293
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:02,083
One last question...

294
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,583
Can you tell me
where you are now?

295
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:23,791
What's that?

296
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:26,916
Did Suzuki write that?

297
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:30,791
So... I guess Urado's
real name is Vlad.

298
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:33,208
Urado is Vlad...?

299
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:35,333
So what...?
I don't get it.

300
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:36,458
I believe the name Vlad

301
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,458
is referring to the
vampire Dracula.

302
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,083
Dracula?

303
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:43,500
Do you mean the guy who
sucks people's blood?

304
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:49,416
Wait, does that mean Urado
sucked people's blood too?

305
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,000
Mai, relax...

306
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,833
There is no such thing as
blood sucking people...

307
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,708
Vampires only
exist in books.

308
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,291
However the
story of Dracula,

309
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:59,791
which Bram Stoker published
in the eighteen hundreds,

310
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,375
was based on an actual
historical figure.

311
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:05,583
He was Vlad Tepes,
or Vlad the Impaler.

312
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:08,458
He was the king of Wallachia,
now known as Romania,

313
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,208
during the
fifteenth century.

314
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:12,583
After the defeat
of the Ottoman Turks,

315
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,166
he was deemed a hero

316
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,583
while simultaneously feared as
being the 'son of the dragon',

317
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:18,333
or 'child of the devil'.

318
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:19,625
That sounds scary.

319
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:23,166
Vlad's father was
named Vlad Dracul.

320
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,458
The word Dracul

321
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:26,958
had two definitions in
Wallachia at that time,

322
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,166
both dragon and devil.

323
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,916
The word Dracula means
'child of Dracul',

324
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,583
or in other words,
'child of the devil'.

325
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,083
To the people of Turkey,

326
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:38,916
he was often referred to
as the Impaler Prince.

327
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,208
How come?

328
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,041
Vlad was meticulous
and brutal.

329
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:45,166
His favorite method of
disposing of his enemies,

330
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,708
or anyone who betrayed him,

331
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,208
was to impale them.

332
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:49,541
Meticulous.

333
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:52,708
This Kaneyuki guy was
very meticulous...

334
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,958
He fired an entire
family that worked for him

335
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,750
when one of them was
caught embezzling.

336
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,416
Vlad and Urado...

337
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,916
They do have some
similar traits.

338
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,041
By the time Kaneyuki
traveled abroad,

339
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:05,666
Dracula had been
published years before.

340
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,958
I would find it odd if
he hadn't known of it.

341
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:10,000
And then there's
Elizabeth Bathory,

342
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,291
a Hungarian countess in
the seventeenth century

343
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:15,291
who's often associated
with Vlad the Impaler.

344
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:17,083
There are countless
stories of Elizabeth

345
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:19,833
being so obsessed with
her fear of growing old

346
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:22,625
that she would kill young
women and drain their blood.

347
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,083
She would bathe in it,

348
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:26,000
hoping it would
restore her youth.

349
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:29,541
Just like in my dream.

350
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:33,458
Kaneyuki must have grown
to hate his frail body,

351
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:34,958
and like Elizabeth Bathory,

352
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:36,333
he may have thought
he could reverse

353
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:39,041
his chronic health issues by
sacrificing young people

354
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:42,041
and using their blood
for nefarious purposes.

355
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:45,333
That would explain why the
staff kept changing so often.

356
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:47,000
I imagine so.

357
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:50,375
Now we can decipher what was
written on that five yen bill...

358
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:52,500
"Everyone who has
come here is dead...

359
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:54,416
I heard they were
killed by Urado...

360
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,083
Run away."

361
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:59,458
So it was a warning for the
next person that came here.

362
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:02,458
But wait... the coat that the
five yen bill was found in,

363
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,875
belonged to the Miyama
Charity Hospital.

364
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,291
Why was it there?

365
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:10,833
No way...! All those
people in the shelter?

366
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,333
Unbelievable..

367
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:13,791
How could he kill
those people

368
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,541
just to keep himself alive?

369
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:16,833
Hold on...

370
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,916
Isn't it a possiblity
that Hiroyuki knew

371
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,958
what his father
was up to in here?

372
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,208
It sure is...

373
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:24,666
And in order to hide his
father's dark secrets,

374
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,000
he kept building
onto the mansion

375
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:28,041
to seal them deep inside.

376
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:31,125
But... Kaneyuki died
a long time ago...

377
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,750
Why would people still be
disappearing today...?

378
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,000
Also...

379
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,250
Before...

380
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,166
What did she mean when
she pointed to the wall?

381
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,416
Kaneyuki didn't
live a full life,

382
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,541
which was obviously a major
disappointment for him.

383
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,833
He killed others in an
attempt to stave off death,

384
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,875
but still died
sooner than he wished.

385
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:52,583
Urado's still here...

386
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,125
Inside this house.

387
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:58,041
And he's far from being
finished with his sacrifices.

388
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,833
The following day,
we decided to find out

389
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:08,958
what was on the other
side of that wall,

390
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,166
where the extra chimney
and hidden space were.

391
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:23,916
Let's head in.

392
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:32,541
What is that smell?

393
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:33,833
There's a door.

394
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:43,000
It's blocked.

395
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,708
It's blocked in
over on this side too.

396
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,083
What's wrong?

397
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,041
What'd you find?

398
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,500
It's most likely the
body of one of the people

399
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,458
that disappeared
two months ago.

400
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:13,541
That's awful...

401
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:14,625
Please excuse me.

402
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,291
I need to contact
the Prime Minister.

403
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,958
With the discovery
of this body...

404
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:21,333
There's little hope...

405
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:23,833
that we'll find any of
the others still alive.

406
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,500
Are you saying that...

407
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,916
Suzuki is probably dead?

408
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,041
Yes.

409
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,500
Same goes for Atsugi.

410
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:32,750
But wait...

411
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,250
You said the body
you found in there

412
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,375
was from two months ago...

413
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:38,750
Couldn't she have
just gotten lost?

414
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:41,500
The room was completely
sealed off from the outside.

415
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,500
Unless human beings have
adapted the ability

416
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:45,916
to pass through walls,

417
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,666
I can only guess they
were taken there...

418
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,791
through a rip in the
space-time continuum.

419
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,583
Have you any idea how
much power it would take

420
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,458
to accomplish that?

421
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,333
Look... I'm leaving.

422
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:57,750
This is too much.

423
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,125
My own life
is in danger.

424
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,875
Please don't leave...

425
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:03,958
Aren't you going to help
us search for Atsugi?

426
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,583
He's probably dead.

427
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:07,833
That's horrible.

428
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,250
Please sir!
I'm begging you.

429
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:11,958
You have got to
help us find her!

430
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:16,041
Dr. Davis...!
Please, I'm desperate!

431
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:18,416
I can't do this...!

432
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,458
I'm not who
you think I am!

433
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:22,208
It was all his idea!

434
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,958
What...? That's ridiculous.

435
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:31,416
I admit it, I'm
not Doctor Davis...

436
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,750
My name is really
Raymond Wall...

437
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,041
This man is
fooling all of you

438
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,208
You should be ashamed
of yourselves.

439
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:40,625
I had a feeling
something was going on.

440
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,166
Hey... Snap out
of it, will ya?

441
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,416
I'm sorry, but I don't want
to be a part of this charade

442
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,375
any longer...

443
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:49,625
Now good day.

444
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,416
Hey wait!
Come back here!

445
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,083
You've got some nerve
embarrassing me like that.

446
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:01,208
I think it would best
if you left now, ma'am.

447
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:05,000
We are leaving as well.

448
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:07,291
What...? We're
gonna leave...?

449
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:08,333
How come?

450
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:10,708
Because... exorcism
is impossible.

451
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:23,125
[Music]

452
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:50,791
Next time on Ghost Hunt,

453
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:53,250
The Bloodstained
Labyrinth, Part Four.

454
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:54,875
Is Naru really giving up?
