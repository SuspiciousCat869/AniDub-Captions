1
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,500
Tell us what
it felt like.

2
00:00:17,958 --> 00:00:21,166
It was like my arm was being
yanked around by the marker...

3
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,916
I honestly felt
that if I let go...

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
it would just fly
off on its own.

5
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:28,875
Hey boss... you sure do
seem incredibly calm.

6
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:31,333
Well, that's just because
I have nerves of steel.

7
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:32,666
Stop.

8
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,708
Rewind it to around
fifty-three seconds

9
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:36,041
and go frame by frame.

10
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:47,583
There wasn't anything on
it until it hit the floor.

11
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:48,916
Masako...

12
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:51,916
I'm sorry...

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,250
I don't feel very well...

14
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:55,791
Let's go to our room.

15
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:58,416
Miss Matsuzaki, would
you please go with them?

16
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,500
We should be okay
by ourselves.

17
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:02,166
No way!

18
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,166
Oh... Alright then.

19
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,791
Wow...

20
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:10,750
Naru's more
jumpy than usual.

21
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:25,583
[Music]

22
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:35,583
[Music]

23
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:45,583
[Music]

24
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:55,625
[Music]

25
00:01:55,708 --> 00:02:05,625
[Music]

26
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:15,625
[Music]

27
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:25,625
[Music]

28
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:39,041
[Music]

29
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:49,875
You smelled blood?

30
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:53,208
Yes, it was like my clothes
were all soaked with it...

31
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:54,625
the smell was so strong

32
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,791
I thought I was
going to be sick.

33
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:59,166
The same thing happened
after we first got here, right?

34
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,458
Yes, but this time
it got much worse

35
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,875
after all of those
rapping noises began.

36
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:06,041
Do you think it could be a
scent from the spirit...?

37
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:08,000
Like at Rokuryo
High School,

38
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,000
remember, there
was the classroom

39
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,000
that had that
horrible smell.

40
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:13,000
-What do you think, Mai...?
-Huh?

41
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:15,541
Are, you sensing
any spirits?

42
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,041
Well... I don't
know what you mean...

43
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,791
why would you be asking
me something like that?

44
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,375
Because during that
last case we were on,

45
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:23,208
it seems that you were
the only other person

46
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:25,375
who saw the same
apparition that I did.

47
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:27,166
What apparition...?

48
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,458
Oh... you mean Sakauchi?

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,583
Yeah, that was crazy...

50
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,958
I haven't been having any
of those dreams, though.

51
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:40,833
Well... you two seem
to be getting along.

52
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,458
You must be joking...

53
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,666
Clearly, someone like
me doesn't associate

54
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,250
with someone
like this.

55
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:48,375
Hey, what is that
supposed to mean?

56
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:49,541
Just how you are...

57
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,083
I didn't say
it's a bad thing.

58
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:52,833
You are an
awful person!

59
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,500
Maybe, but at
least I'm pretty

60
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,666
and unbelievably talented.

61
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,708
You're one of the meanest
girls I've ever known...

62
00:03:58,791 --> 00:03:59,958
why do you hate me? !

63
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,125
You know, I'm
really not sure...

64
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,000
I guess it's just
because you're breathing.

65
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,875
I'll breathe on
you ya creep!

66
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,708
Oh... that's great, you
guys are really on your way

67
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:12,083
to being best friends.

68
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,166
Oh no, I'll never
be friends with her!

69
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,083
Hey, good morning, Lin!

70
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:42,000
Good morning, hello,
how are you today?

71
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,875
Are you absolutely sure none
of you have seen Suzuki?

72
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,750
What's the matter?

73
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,458
It seems that Suzuki
has gone missing.

74
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,916
Please... try to
calm down Ms. Igarashi.

75
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:01,791
When did you
last see her?

76
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:02,666
This morning...

77
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,208
I woke up once...

78
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:06,833
it was around
daybreak I think...

79
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:09,166
and Suzuki was
sleeping, right there.

80
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,000
Do you know what
time it was?

81
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,500
When did you get
up this morning?

82
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,500
Seven o'clock.

83
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,583
Okay, it's ten
o'clock now...

84
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,166
so we can say that
she's been missing

85
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,000
for the past three
hours at least.

86
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,416
Sorry to keep
you waiting.

87
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,166
I questioned the staff to
see if anyone might have

88
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,083
seen her sometime last
night or early this morning

89
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,458
but so far no
there's no news.

90
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,708
I just recently checked
the front door myself

91
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,333
and it was still
locked, so...

92
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:38,166
So we can probably assume
that she didn't go outside.

93
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,333
Oh no, Suzuki has
very bad eyesight...

94
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:42,916
I know for a fact she
wouldn't have gone anywhere

95
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,500
without her contacts.

96
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,291
Wait a sec...!

97
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:50,083
What if we asked Dr. Davis
to help us find her...

98
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:52,250
I mean, he was able to find
that billionaire's son

99
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,583
by using his
clairvoyance right?

100
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,375
Is that true?

101
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:58,458
Ms Igarashi, I just
heard what happened...

102
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,333
how terrible for
Miss Suzuki...

103
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,958
We'd be happy to help
in any way we can.

104
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:04,416
Oh, Thank you...

105
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,750
if I may...

106
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,750
I'd like to ask Dr. Davis
to attempt psychometry.

107
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,583
Maybe he can find her.

108
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:11,833
Perhaps he could use
this contact lens case

109
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:13,375
that she left behind...

110
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:16,666
if the doctor would at least
try I would be very grateful.

111
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,500
Of course yes...

112
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:20,916
I will ask him.

113
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:23,541
Dr. Davis...

114
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:29,583
I'm afraid he is unable
to see with this item.

115
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:31,208
But... why not?

116
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,875
Yeah, it's something that
belonged to her, right?!

117
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:35,291
The doctor is limited...

118
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,583
he can only utilize an object
that was with the person

119
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:39,291
at the time they
went missing.

120
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:40,416
Oh no...

121
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,791
So we should look around
to find something

122
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,750
she dropped since
this morning? !

123
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,833
This isn't my fault
little miss...

124
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:48,250
I unfortunately don't
make the rules...

125
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,208
Has anyone considered
that the séance yesterday

126
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:53,166
traumatized the girl and
she simply went home...?

127
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,166
Young people these days
just don't seem to have

128
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,750
-much staying power.
-What? !

129
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,833
That could be
a possibility...

130
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:01,208
I'll try calling
Suzuki at home...

131
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:02,875
Thanks so much.

132
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,500
Ms. Igarashi...

133
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,666
The rest of us will divide
up and help search for her.

134
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,625
Now let's see if Mr. Ohashi
can show you to the telephone.

135
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:12,375
Thank you.

136
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:13,416
But...

137
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,375
Suzuki hadn't
just gone home.

138
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,666
She could be
anywhere in here...

139
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,083
I mean, this house is
so gigantic and weird

140
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,791
that I can't help thinking
there are a bunch of places

141
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,375
we don't know about.

142
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,833
Well, a floor plan will go a
long way toward helping us out

143
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,458
so you guys
keep at it.

144
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,500
If it's so important
then why am I not

145
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,333
hearing you offer to grab a
tape measure and help out?

146
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:36,000
Because I'm exhausted
from walking around

147
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,875
this screwed up place
trying to sense spirits,

148
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,500
that's why...

149
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,041
Right, Masako?

150
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,250
Yes...

151
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,208
Although I have to say
you do tend to whine

152
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:46,916
and complain about it
a lot more than I do.

153
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,166
Oh shut it, you know
you're tired too!

154
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:53,041
So do you think she could
have been taken away somewhere?

155
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,083
By who?

156
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,500
I dunno...

157
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,291
maybe by a spirit who
believed that Suzuki

158
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:58,916
could help them
or something.

159
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,500
I hear ya...

160
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:02,791
she was the person who
actually experienced

161
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,625
the spirits
calling for help.

162
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:05,708
Or maybe...

163
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,083
She actually faked
everyone out

164
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:10,125
and wrote those
words on her own,

165
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:11,583
then ran off
because she was afraid

166
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,083
of being found out?

167
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,666
But what about the
one written in blood

168
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,458
and all the
knocking sounds?

169
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:18,333
Oh... yeah.

170
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:21,000
Hey you guys, the floor
seems to sink down here.

171
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,166
-A door?
-But...

172
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,375
Where's it go...?

173
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:27,125
There's one way
to find out.

174
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,916
What is this?

175
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,458
You found a
hidden space?

176
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:43,416
Yep!

177
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,833
And we ran across this while
we were checking it out.

178
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,166
Look at the tag, Naru.

179
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,541
"Miyama Charity
Hospital"...

180
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:56,250
the one that was founded by
the first head of the family.

181
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:57,791
That would mean
this lab coat

182
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,875
was in fact issued
by the hospital.

183
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:02,500
So... what would
that be doing here?

184
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,583
Hidden in a secret room?

185
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,208
I see something ...

186
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:15,375
Wow... that money sure
looks really old...

187
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:18,000
and I think I can see some
kind of writing on it.

188
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,250
Well Mai, what
does it say?

189
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:24,000
Yo... ge... ku... ki...

190
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:26,833
ta... sa... ni... ura...

191
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:30,041
ru... kyo... shi... mina...

192
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:33,041
ha... rai... sho?

193
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:34,583
What the hell
is that?

194
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,125
It doesn't make
any sense.

195
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,583
It's so dirty...

196
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,208
I can't read it all.

197
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:41,625
Why do you think someone
would write on money?

198
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,958
Maybe whoever it was didn't
have anything else to write on.

199
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,416
Let's keep
investigating...

200
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,791
But whatever you do...

201
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,625
make sure you always
stay together.

202
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:00,791
Well, here I am,
having to stay here

203
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,666
and keep watch with Lin...

204
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,916
He's been in such a lousy
mood since yesterday...

205
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,875
He hasn't said two words
to me this whole time.

206
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm... gonna get some tea...

207
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,583
Do you want
any, Lin?

208
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:13,916
No, thank you.

209
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:17,416
Oh... okay...

210
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,166
So what do you think
happened to Suzuki?

211
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,333
Okay, why aren't you
talking to me, Lin...?

212
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:27,333
I really didn't mean to do
anything to offend you...

213
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,208
I was just surprised
that you were Chinese,

214
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,666
and I guess I must've said
it wrong or something.

215
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,375
Because I think
you're great,

216
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:35,000
and the last thing in the
world I'd ever want to do

217
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:36,375
is hurt your feelings.

218
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:39,333
I'm fine, I just...
I hate the Japanese.

219
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,500
Do you know about what
has happened historically

220
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,416
and what they did
to my country...?

221
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,875
You should pick up a book.

222
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:47,791
Not to be rude but I'm
not interested

223
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,666
in befriending Japanese...

224
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,583
especially those who
don't know their history.

225
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,958
My heart is
pounding so hard...

226
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,791
I don't know
what to do...

227
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:59,750
I usually feel this
way when I'm angry...

228
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:01,708
but this is different...

229
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,291
I feel... sad.

230
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,166
It's not like I'm
stupid about it.

231
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,583
I know Japan did some
terrible things...

232
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:12,583
but hating people now for
what happened then...

233
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:15,708
I dunno but it just
seems really wrong.

234
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:18,000
Just think, if everyone did
that then the whole world

235
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,416
would have to hate
each other forever

236
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,458
and it would
be so awful...

237
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,958
we're gonna have to learn
to forgive each other.

238
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:25,208
I can understand if
you don't like me

239
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,000
because I'm annoying
or something,

240
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,500
but I really wish
you wouldn't hate me

241
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,125
just because
I'm Japanese.

242
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:37,458
Uh... did I say
something funny?

243
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,583
Sorry, there was someone else
who said the same thing to me

244
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,208
a long time ago...

245
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:44,125
you just made me
remember that.

246
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:45,791
Oh... was it Naru?

247
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:47,458
Oh no...

248
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,083
When I told Naru
I'm pretty sure

249
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:52,125
his exact words were,
"That's stupid".

250
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:54,166
That sounds... like him.

251
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:57,000
I don't hate you,
Mai, and I'm sorry

252
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,041
for making you
think that I did...

253
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:01,250
it's just that my heritage
is very important to me

254
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:04,250
and I can't just get
rid of my feelings...

255
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:07,166
So...will you forgive me for
saying such hateful things?

256
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,375
Absolutely,
forgive me, too.

257
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,583
Hey, welcome
back guys!

258
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,000
Did you find anything?

259
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:18,625
What's that?

260
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,291
It's a ghost!

261
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,125
Hi, everyone!

262
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:40,375
Madoka, why in the world
did you show up here?

263
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:41,875
I wanted to tell
you what turned up

264
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:43,583
in my investigation.

265
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:46,333
But you know that it's
extremely dangerous here...

266
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:48,333
What if something
had happened to you?

267
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:51,125
I guess you'd have come
to rescue me, right?

268
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:56,458
I can't believe Naru's
actually taking that.

269
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:58,166
Okay, let's
start with Suzuki,

270
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,625
the girl you called me
about this morning...

271
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,583
I questioned all of the
bus and taxi companies

272
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,791
that operate in the area
and none of their drivers said

273
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:09,375
they saw or picked up any
woman fitting her description.

274
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,541
Moving on to the disappearances,
two months ago...

275
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,041
the first; was a boy who
apparently was here partying

276
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:15,458
with several friends.

277
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:17,333
They reported that
he staggered

278
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:19,125
out of the room at one
point and never came back.

279
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:23,000
A week later, an official
search was ordered.

280
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:25,041
The police came out
to comb the property,

281
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,416
and that's when a
twenty-one year old man

282
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,125
from the fire
brigade disappeared.

283
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:30,833
And as for the Miyamas...

284
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:32,916
well, I'll begin with
Kaneyuki Miyama...

285
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,375
The man was meticulous.

286
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:37,083
Listen to this... an
employee at his silk mill

287
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:38,583
had been embezzling
money from other workers

288
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:40,458
and was understandably fired.

289
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:43,375
But Kaneyuki also fired
the man's oldest son,

290
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,208
who worked in the mill,
as well as three other sons

291
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,458
who were on staff
at the hospital.

292
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,583
The house that they
all lived in,

293
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,125
as well as that of his
daughter and son-in-law,

294
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:53,250
were actually rented
to them by Kaneyuki,

295
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,833
and they were all evicted
from those properties.

296
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:58,750
-He threw them out?
-Uh-huh.

297
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,833
Apparently even the
embezzler's parents

298
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:03,166
were employed by Kaneyuki
on the grounds here

299
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,083
and he told them
to clear out, too.

300
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,791
Jeez, talk about
thorough...

301
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,125
Yeah...

302
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,250
It seems the man became
sort of famous for it.

303
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,041
Anyway, he wasn't a
very sociable guy

304
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,833
and always insisted
on hiring his maids

305
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:17,416
from outside of the area...

306
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,416
he was very adamant
about keeping people

307
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,083
away from this house...

308
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:23,250
Over time, the locals
began to suspect

309
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,833
something fishy must
be happening here.

310
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:28,916
His son, Hiroyuki, tried
to keep people away too,

311
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,333
and was known to say some
pretty strange things.

312
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:32,958
What kind of things?

313
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,333
Whenever anyone
would ask him

314
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,875
why he was constantly
adding on to the house,

315
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:38,500
the answer he
always gave was...

316
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,333
There are ghosts in there...!

317
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:42,541
I'm doing it to shut
the ghosts inside...

318
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,291
and keep them
from getting out!

319
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,375
Keep them from
getting out?!

320
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:48,666
You'll find everyone's
personal histories in here

321
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,000
nice and neat...

322
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:52,000
can I do anything
else for you?

323
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:55,500
Yes, I'd like you to investigate
Miyama Charity Hosptial.

324
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:56,708
You got it.

325
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,208
Bye!

326
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,958
I'm sorry I wasn't any
help to you this morning.

327
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:20,166
Oh please, that's all right, I
should have never been so rude.

328
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,708
I just hope we can find
Suzuki as soon as possible...

329
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,041
Goodnight, then.

330
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:30,291
Atsugi seems like
a really nice guy...

331
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:33,291
I wonder why he's working
with a man like Mr. Minami?

332
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,666
What's even more baffling is
why Naru would choose you

333
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,833
as his assistant.

334
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:40,083
Hey, what the heck
do you mean by that?!

335
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:52,166
Huh...? Where
did everyone go?

336
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,041
No, wait... you shouldn't
go over there...

337
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,208
Listen to me...
please come back!

338
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,833
If you go that way something
bad is going to happen!

339
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:12,958
-Yes?
-It's Minami...

340
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:14,208
I'm sorry
it's so late.

341
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,916
Have you by chance
seen Atsugi tonight?

342
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,416
First Suzuki
disappeared...

343
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,250
and now Atsugi's
gone, too.

344
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,291
I'm sorry to say that none
of the staff members

345
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:28,208
have any information
about Atsugi...

346
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:30,250
shouldn't we take this
opportunity to again

347
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,875
ask Dr. Davis to use
his abilities...?

348
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,125
And if the doctor is
unable to use clairvoyance

349
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,916
then perhaps,
someone else can.

350
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,458
Uh... yes...

351
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:39,958
But perhaps...

352
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,708
This is an
emergency, sir...!

353
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:43,583
Two people have
vanished in two days

354
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,333
and one of them was
your own assistant...!

355
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:47,000
Why wouldn't we ask
Dr Davis for help,

356
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:48,625
unless you've
been lying to us

357
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,500
about the identity of the
man you brought with you

358
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,625
to this house!

359
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:53,916
Is it true...?

360
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,125
could it be
that this man...

361
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,458
is just an imposter?

362
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,500
Well, I'm not going to
sit here and take this...

363
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,583
how dare you insult
not only myself

364
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,875
but the honorable
Professor Davis as well!

365
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:05,666
It's obvious now...

366
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,375
We're being forced to solve
this case all by ourselves...

367
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,375
please... come with me,
Professor.

368
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:16,041
Something is not
right with that guy.

369
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:17,333
We don't really
have any proof

370
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:20,250
that the man is
actually Dr. Davis.

371
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:23,666
You mean, Apart from
Mr. Minami's insistence.

372
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,125
Yeah, and he didn't use
his clairvoyance again.

373
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:37,375
It's been four days...

374
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,208
the case is at
a standstill...

375
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:42,708
and there's been no sign
of Suzuki or Atsugi.

376
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:45,291
I just can't get
used to this house.

377
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:47,708
Yeah... I mean, normally
you'd never think of

378
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:50,666
anyone going missing inside a
house, but in this place...

379
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,041
Hey, there's
a door here!

380
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,000
Fantastic... another
secret room?

381
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:58,416
Geez, it's dusty!

382
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,083
I wonder who
we have here?

383
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:15,958
It says "Meiji 32,
self-portrait, Urado".

384
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,583
Oh, really?

385
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,875
So who's Urado?

386
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:23,458
Since his self-portrait
was hanging there

387
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:26,500
I would guess he was likely
someone close to Mr. Miyama.

388
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:29,375
Should we ask Mr. Ohashi if
he knows anything about it?

389
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:32,750
What is it, Naru?

390
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:35,625
Urado... I think... yes.

391
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:36,791
Wait, I don't get it,

392
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,666
wouldn't somebody read
that as "Toura"?

393
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,291
Hold on a sec...

394
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,916
Didn't we said that this bill
would be from the Meiji era...?

395
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,458
And since they read opposite
of how we do it today...

396
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,166
it would really be
right-to-left...

397
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,250
so then...

398
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:53,375
the writing would actually
look something like this, right?

399
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,291
The first part would be...

400
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,583
"Everyone who has come
here is now dead"...

401
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:02,041
I think.

402
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,583
Dead?!

403
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:06,583
And I'm guessing that the last
part there is "Run away"...

404
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:09,750
Do you think this was supposed
to be a message to someone?

405
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,500
Well we can easily
assume that "Here"

406
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,125
would most likely
refer to this house.

407
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:14,625
Remember?

408
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:18,125
Madoka said Kaneyuki wouldn't
allow anyone to come here.

409
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,791
Maybe this Urado person
did something really bad

410
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:23,208
and Kaneyuki didn't want
anyone to find out.

411
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:24,291
That's a lot of
trouble to go through...

412
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,041
why not just expose him?

413
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,375
Maybe Urado was
holding him hostage...

414
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,833
and when he finally decided
to try to communicate

415
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:33,083
with someone on the outside
the only thing he had to use

416
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:34,166
was this bill.

417
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:36,833
In any case we've
learned some

418
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:38,708
very interesting
things today...

419
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,666
and once we use them...

420
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:44,083
Let's not forget we know
something else as well...

421
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:46,250
The spirits here spoke
quite clearly at the séance.

422
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:50,291
I am now certain that they were
the spirits of those people

423
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:51,833
who have died
in this house.

424
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,083
The people who
died here...?

425
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:00,708
But who did that hospital
coat belong to...?

426
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:03,625
Could it be that the
people who went missing...

427
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,375
Suzuki and Atsugi...

428
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:08,041
I can't move!

429
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:13,500
Why can't I talk?!

430
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:17,083
Ayako...! Masako... wake up!

431
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,458
What do I do...?!
No... stay away!

432
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,625
No, let me go...

433
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,125
Please...

434
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:29,333
let me go!

435
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:38,166
What room is this?

436
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:40,958
Someone's here.

437
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,916
No...! I've got to be having
one of those dreams again...

438
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,708
because if I'm not then...

439
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,125
It smells like blood.

440
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:14,500
Stop... I don't want to
go into that room...

441
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:15,541
No!

442
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:20,458
What is this?

443
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,125
Why am I wearing a kimono?

444
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,166
What are you doing to me?!

445
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:46,458
This is a dream...

446
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:54,833
I have to hurry
and wake up...

447
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:56,583
I don't want to die.

448
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:57,958
Somebody...

449
00:21:58,041 --> 00:21:59,208
I don't want to die.

450
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,833
-Help!
-I don't want to die.

451
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,416
No!

452

'The Bloodstained
Labyrinth" Part Three.

460
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:55,416
Let's just hope
I make it out alive!
