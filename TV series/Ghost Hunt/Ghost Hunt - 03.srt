1
00:00:20,301 --> 00:00:21,469
I'm Mai Taniyama,

2
00:00:21,553 --> 00:00:23,179
a freshman in high school...

3
00:00:23,263 --> 00:00:26,391
Finally the exorcism at
the old schoolhouse began,

4
00:00:26,474 --> 00:00:28,727
with the Shrine Maiden
Ayako trying first

5
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,021
and failing miserably.

6
00:00:31,104 --> 00:00:33,815
She even got my
principal injured!

7
00:00:33,898 --> 00:00:37,277
After that, things started
to get really weird!

8
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,737
Monk said the spirits
were getting violent

9
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,739
after the failed exorcism,

10
00:00:40,822 --> 00:00:43,074
and I was starting to
think he was right.

11
00:00:43,158 --> 00:00:44,325
But Naru insisted

12
00:00:44,409 --> 00:00:46,286
that this was all due
to the ground sinking.

13
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,748
I'm so mad at myself
I could throw up.

14
00:00:49,831 --> 00:00:51,833
After that, Naru disappeared

15
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:54,461
so Monk decided to try
his hand at the exorcism,

16
00:00:54,544 --> 00:00:55,587
but guess what?

17
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,088
It had no effect either

18
00:00:57,172 --> 00:00:59,841
and the poltergeist got
even more intense!

19
00:00:59,924 --> 00:01:01,009
It's warm.

20
00:01:01,092 --> 00:01:02,427
Objects that
poltergeists manipulate

21
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:03,553
feel warm to the touch.

22
00:01:03,636 --> 00:01:04,763
Mai!

23
00:01:06,598 --> 00:01:12,354
[Music]

24
00:02:50,285 --> 00:02:51,786
Naru...?

25
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,414
I guess you're back, huh...?

26
00:02:54,497 --> 00:02:55,665
Good.

27
00:02:58,084 --> 00:02:59,419
After you left

28
00:02:59,502 --> 00:03:01,796
the poltergeist came back
worse than it was before.

29
00:03:03,798 --> 00:03:05,133
Go back to sleep.

30
00:03:07,927 --> 00:03:09,095
What's with you...?

31
00:03:09,179 --> 00:03:11,014
You're acting so nice.

32
00:03:13,266 --> 00:03:14,642
You know you're
even more handsome

33
00:03:14,726 --> 00:03:16,186
when you smile like that.

34
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:20,523
Mai, wake up.

35
00:03:22,442 --> 00:03:24,194
I think she's going
to be okay guys.

36
00:03:24,277 --> 00:03:26,071
Hey Mai. How do you feel?

37
00:03:26,154 --> 00:03:28,031
Boy, we were really
worried there for a minute.

38
00:03:31,451 --> 00:03:32,702
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:32,786 --> 00:03:34,371
You were out for
quite a while there.

40
00:03:34,454 --> 00:03:35,789
It's already four o'clock
in the morning.

41
00:03:35,872 --> 00:03:37,540
Did Naru ever come back?

42
00:03:37,624 --> 00:03:38,792
Nope.

43
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:42,128
Oh, then it was
just a dream.

44
00:03:42,212 --> 00:03:43,797
I should have
known better.

45
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,175
There's no way Naru would
ever smile like that.

46
00:03:47,258 --> 00:03:48,593
Where's Kuroda?

47
00:03:48,677 --> 00:03:50,011
She went home.

48
00:03:50,095 --> 00:03:52,889
Which Come to think of it
isn't entirely a bad idea...

49
00:03:52,972 --> 00:03:55,183
The exorcisms have
had no effect...

50
00:03:55,266 --> 00:03:57,018
and it's possible that
even our own safety

51
00:03:57,102 --> 00:03:58,478
could even be compromised.

52
00:03:58,561 --> 00:03:59,813
So you wanna run away?

53
00:03:59,896 --> 00:04:01,272
Need I remind you

54
00:04:01,356 --> 00:04:03,274
that it was your own boss
who ran away first...

55
00:04:03,358 --> 00:04:05,694
He probably went home and
cried himself to sleep.

56
00:04:05,777 --> 00:04:07,237
That is ridiculous.

57
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,156
Well, if I were to guess
he ran away because of us.

58
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,992
We did gang up on him
yesterday you know.

59
00:04:13,076 --> 00:04:14,786
Yes but remember you're
referring to the world's

60
00:04:14,869 --> 00:04:17,622
greatest swollen-headed,
stuck up, self- absorbed, holier

61
00:04:17,706 --> 00:04:19,040
than thou narcissist.

62
00:04:19,124 --> 00:04:20,417
Maybe Kazuya's at home...

63
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,127
stewing with unbridled rage

64
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,045
while he makes straw effigy
dolls of each of us.

65
00:04:35,265 --> 00:04:36,099
Morning.

66
00:04:36,182 --> 00:04:38,268
Oh my gosh! Mai!
Are you okay?

67
00:04:38,351 --> 00:04:39,644
We heard something
happened to you.

68
00:04:39,728 --> 00:04:41,396
Fill us in on
all the details!

69
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:43,690
Oh... Where did
you hear that?

70
00:04:43,773 --> 00:04:45,233
Kuroda told us...

71
00:04:45,316 --> 00:04:47,152
She's been bragging to the whole
class about it all morning.

72
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,739
And you'll never guess
what happened to us!

73
00:04:50,822 --> 00:04:53,074
Kazuya just called
us up out of nowhere!

74
00:04:53,158 --> 00:04:55,452
We talked for
like ten minutes!

75
00:04:55,535 --> 00:04:57,829
-He called?!
-Yeah. Last night.

76
00:04:57,912 --> 00:04:59,706
-Right.
-Last night...?

77
00:04:59,789 --> 00:05:01,666
He's been missing since
yesterday afternoon...!

78
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,084
What'd ya talk about?

79
00:05:03,168 --> 00:05:05,587
Uh... you know like
this and that...

80
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,005
he asked us what
we knew about the

81
00:05:07,088 --> 00:05:08,631
old schoolhouse, and stuff.

82
00:05:08,715 --> 00:05:10,925
He asked a lot of
questions about Kuroda.

83
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:12,761
What the heck
is Naru up to?

84
00:05:14,721 --> 00:05:15,805
Oh there you are...

85
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:18,099
Kuroda... Mai...

86
00:05:18,183 --> 00:05:19,601
You're wanted in the
principal's office.

87
00:05:21,811 --> 00:05:22,937
Hello?

88
00:05:24,314 --> 00:05:25,523
Uh.

89
00:05:25,607 --> 00:05:26,941
Naru?

90
00:05:27,025 --> 00:05:28,568
And there's Masako.

91
00:05:28,651 --> 00:05:30,362
What's everyone
doing here?

92
00:05:30,445 --> 00:05:31,821
Please take a seat.

93
00:05:31,905 --> 00:05:33,239
Okay. This makes up everyone

94
00:05:33,323 --> 00:05:36,159
who's been involved
with the case thus far.

95
00:05:36,242 --> 00:05:37,827
This should only
take a few minutes.

96
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:49,089
What's up with that light?

97
00:05:49,172 --> 00:05:51,758
It's really strange.

98
00:05:51,841 --> 00:05:54,010
I'd like everyone to
focus on the light.

99
00:05:59,474 --> 00:06:00,600
Now control your breathing

100
00:06:00,684 --> 00:06:02,310
so it's in sync
with the light.

101
00:06:06,064 --> 00:06:07,941
Very Slowly...

102
00:06:08,024 --> 00:06:09,651
Relax your shoulders.

103
00:06:15,073 --> 00:06:16,866
Concentrate on
your breathing.

104
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,162
I'm getting really sleepy...

105
00:06:21,246 --> 00:06:24,457
Maybe it's because of what
happened last night...

106
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,292
I'm probably just tired.

107
00:06:26,376 --> 00:06:28,670
Now start counting
your breaths.

108
00:06:28,753 --> 00:06:30,171
Breathe deep.

109
00:06:30,255 --> 00:06:30,964
Nice and slow.

110
00:06:31,047 --> 00:06:32,841
He sounds so far away.

111
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,969
Tonight the chair on
the second floor

112
00:06:36,052 --> 00:06:38,680
of the old schoolhouse
will move.

113
00:06:38,763 --> 00:06:40,432
Chair?

114
00:06:40,515 --> 00:06:44,602
Tomorrow we will all
meet in the laboratory.

115
00:06:44,686 --> 00:06:46,479
Laboratory...

116
00:06:46,563 --> 00:06:47,647
Chair...

117
00:06:47,731 --> 00:06:49,107
Chair.

118
00:06:51,192 --> 00:06:52,610
That's all I need...

119
00:06:52,694 --> 00:06:54,362
Thank you for
your cooperation.

120
00:06:54,446 --> 00:06:55,655
I'm sleepy.

121
00:06:55,739 --> 00:06:57,115
So am I.

122
00:07:00,118 --> 00:07:01,036
Chair.

123
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:04,456
Naru!

124
00:07:04,539 --> 00:07:06,291
Where did you go yesterday?

125
00:07:06,374 --> 00:07:07,876
Nowhere special...

126
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:09,377
I heard that
you got injured.

127
00:07:09,461 --> 00:07:10,920
Oh it was no big deal...

128
00:07:11,004 --> 00:07:13,006
So, what was up
with that light?

129
00:07:13,089 --> 00:07:14,841
Shouldn't you be heading
back to class now?

130
00:07:14,924 --> 00:07:16,718
I'm not too
worried about it.

131
00:07:16,801 --> 00:07:19,220
So you're skipping class
because you want to be stupid?

132
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:22,724
Hold on, Naru!

133
00:07:22,807 --> 00:07:24,142
There's something I
wanted to ask you...

134
00:07:24,225 --> 00:07:25,810
Did you come
back last night?

135
00:07:25,894 --> 00:07:27,520
To, the school...?

136
00:07:27,604 --> 00:07:29,189
Uh uh... Why?

137
00:07:29,272 --> 00:07:31,274
Oh... Um uh, no reason...

138
00:07:31,358 --> 00:07:33,109
Well time to get
back to class...

139
00:07:33,193 --> 00:07:34,235
See ya!

140
00:07:38,365 --> 00:07:39,866
Just as I suspected.

141
00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:42,327
Naru would never
smile like that.

142
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,496
Oh well, at least I know
it was just a dream now.

143
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:48,708
Why do I keep thinking
about that...?

144
00:07:48,792 --> 00:07:49,959
Does that mean...

145
00:07:50,043 --> 00:07:51,294
Oh no!

146
00:08:04,307 --> 00:08:05,600
What's wrong with me?

147
00:08:05,684 --> 00:08:08,061
No matter what I do I
can't get it out of my head!

148
00:08:08,144 --> 00:08:09,938
I guess that means
I'm really...

149
00:08:12,732 --> 00:08:14,901
Please don't look
at me like that?

150
00:08:14,984 --> 00:08:16,236
Were you the one who
set up the microphone

151
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,279
on the second
floor last night?

152
00:08:18,363 --> 00:08:20,073
Yeah, We were
getting good video,

153
00:08:20,156 --> 00:08:21,658
but I thought we should
have a mic in there

154
00:08:21,741 --> 00:08:22,784
you know just in case.

155
00:08:22,867 --> 00:08:25,328
Well you did an
excellent job, Mai...

156
00:08:25,412 --> 00:08:27,247
It picked up some very
interesting noises.

157
00:08:32,127 --> 00:08:34,838
-What's up?
-Oh... Uh That was it...

158
00:08:34,921 --> 00:08:37,298
Wait... there was one more
thing I wanted to mention...

159
00:08:37,382 --> 00:08:38,466
You know that bookcase?

160
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,176
The one that fell
on top of me?

161
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,220
It was warm, and I
remembered you saying that

162
00:08:42,303 --> 00:08:44,222
poltergeists cause
things to heat up.

163
00:08:44,305 --> 00:08:45,890
I'm impressed you
remember that.

164
00:08:45,974 --> 00:08:47,726
Thanks.

165
00:08:47,809 --> 00:08:48,977
Good day Mai.

166
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,103
John.

167
00:08:51,771 --> 00:08:53,440
Now... Let's get started.

168
00:08:56,776 --> 00:08:57,944
Hmm.

169
00:08:58,028 --> 00:08:59,446
A chair...

170
00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:00,864
and a camera.

171
00:09:00,947 --> 00:09:02,490
Hey... Naru?

172
00:09:02,574 --> 00:09:04,534
What are you setting
up over there?

173
00:09:04,617 --> 00:09:06,536
This is a radar.

174
00:09:06,619 --> 00:09:09,039
Wait, I thought they only used
those things on airplanes...

175
00:09:09,122 --> 00:09:10,540
So why do you have one?

176
00:09:10,623 --> 00:09:12,625
If I told you it
wouldn't work.

177
00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:14,669
But I'm still your
assistant, right?

178
00:09:14,753 --> 00:09:17,630
Yes, So Take some of
that plywood over there

179
00:09:17,714 --> 00:09:20,008
and start boarding up all the
windows and doors in that room.

180
00:09:23,345 --> 00:09:24,429
What's his problem?

181
00:09:24,512 --> 00:09:25,805
Does he have to keep
me in the dark about

182
00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:27,140
every little detail?

183
00:09:39,194 --> 00:09:41,571
My arms are killing me.

184
00:09:41,654 --> 00:09:42,655
What now?

185
00:09:42,739 --> 00:09:43,948
Both of you take this

186
00:09:44,032 --> 00:09:45,325
and sign your names
on the boards.

187
00:09:50,872 --> 00:09:53,291
That was the
last one, right?

188
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,710
Now... write your
names on this paper...

189
00:09:55,794 --> 00:09:57,420
When you're done
you can go home.

190
00:09:57,504 --> 00:10:00,256
So... I assume there's
a point to all this.

191
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,300
You'll find out tomorrow.

192
00:10:02,384 --> 00:10:04,094
Tomorrow?!

193
00:10:04,177 --> 00:10:05,387
Kazuya knows what
he's doing

194
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,097
and I trust his
judgment, so...

195
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,431
maybe we should
just sleep on it

196
00:10:08,515 --> 00:10:10,392
like he said and
find out tomorrow.

197
00:10:10,475 --> 00:10:11,518
Maybe so...

198
00:10:11,601 --> 00:10:13,687
But I'm tired of being
left in the dark!

199
00:10:20,026 --> 00:10:21,611
I didn't get a wink
of sleep last night

200
00:10:21,695 --> 00:10:23,488
because I couldn't stop
thinking about this.

201
00:10:25,615 --> 00:10:27,826
It's his real assistant.

202
00:10:27,909 --> 00:10:29,744
Oh man, this is gonna
be super awkward.

203
00:10:29,828 --> 00:10:32,038
Last time I saw him he
ended up in the hospital.

204
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,376
What are you doing
here so early?

205
00:10:36,459 --> 00:10:38,086
I couldn't sleep 'cause
I've been up all night

206
00:10:38,169 --> 00:10:40,338
thinking about the experiment
we set up yesterday.

207
00:10:40,422 --> 00:10:41,923
You'll have to
wait a bit more...

208
00:10:42,007 --> 00:10:43,466
Everyone will
be here soon.

209
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,635
Everyone? Even the
monk and Ayako...?

210
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:47,637
What for?

211
00:10:47,721 --> 00:10:49,556
Smug as usual.

212
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:51,933
Uh... Are... you
feeling better?

213
00:10:54,561 --> 00:10:57,188
Hurry up and get here everyone
before that guy kills me!

214
00:10:59,232 --> 00:11:01,693
So what's the plan
for today Naru?

215
00:11:01,776 --> 00:11:03,111
Yes, let's hope
for your sake

216
00:11:03,194 --> 00:11:05,447
you don't embarrass
yourself yet again.

217
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:07,365
Now Would you two
please confirm

218
00:11:07,449 --> 00:11:08,742
that the paper you
signed yesterday

219
00:11:08,825 --> 00:11:10,410
hasn't been tampered with.

220
00:11:10,493 --> 00:11:11,661
Yeah Okay.

221
00:11:11,745 --> 00:11:13,079
Looks good to me.

222
00:11:13,163 --> 00:11:14,205
What about you John?

223
00:11:14,289 --> 00:11:16,458
Fine

224
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:17,500
Alright.

225
00:11:33,892 --> 00:11:35,143
Oh my lord!

226
00:11:39,689 --> 00:11:41,649
Oh my lord!

227
00:11:41,733 --> 00:11:43,443
The chair...

228
00:11:43,526 --> 00:11:45,236
It's moved!

229
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,946
Indeed it has.

230
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,656
So what exactly
does this prove?

231
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,033
Would you care to explain?

232
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,996
I'd like to thank you all
for your cooperation...

233
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,499
I'll be finishing this
investigation today.

234
00:11:57,582 --> 00:11:58,750
Let me get this straight.

235
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,752
Are you claiming to have
solved the case again?

236
00:12:00,835 --> 00:12:02,295
That's exactly
what I'm saying.

237
00:12:02,379 --> 00:12:04,547
-The ground sinking?
-Yes...

238
00:12:04,631 --> 00:12:06,007
All of the issues

239
00:12:06,091 --> 00:12:07,842
that the principal originally
brought to my attention

240
00:12:07,926 --> 00:12:10,011
can be explained by
ground subsidence.

241
00:12:10,095 --> 00:12:12,138
Yeah? Then what about
the disturbances we saw

242
00:12:12,222 --> 00:12:13,973
the day before yesterday?

243
00:12:14,057 --> 00:12:15,892
Now those were
from a poltergeist.

244
00:12:15,975 --> 00:12:16,935
You're not
making any sense.

245
00:12:17,018 --> 00:12:18,687
What else can he do?

246
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:22,273
We all know he can't
exorcise it... right?

247
00:12:22,357 --> 00:12:25,527
There's no need for exorcism
in this circumstance...

248
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,112
Watch this and you'll see.

249
00:12:46,464 --> 00:12:47,549
What was that?

250
00:12:47,632 --> 00:12:49,676
Well, it's obviously
a poltergeist.

251
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:50,969
Humans are to blame

252
00:12:51,052 --> 00:12:53,596
for over half of reported
poltergeists every year.

253
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,098
You mean like a prank...?

254
00:12:55,181 --> 00:12:57,142
But no one could have
gotten in there.

255
00:12:57,225 --> 00:12:59,853
True... We did seal
off every entrance...

256
00:12:59,936 --> 00:13:02,522
I even had John and Mai sign
their names on each panel,

257
00:13:02,605 --> 00:13:04,941
so we could tell if someone
had tampered with one.

258
00:13:05,025 --> 00:13:07,485
If someone had attempted to
replace any broken pieces,

259
00:13:07,569 --> 00:13:10,447
there's little chance they could
have replicated my signature.

260
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:12,949
This only proves that
I've been right all along!

261
00:13:13,033 --> 00:13:15,869
I placed a hypnotic suggestion
into everyone's mind yesterday

262
00:13:15,952 --> 00:13:16,911
that this
chair would move

263
00:13:16,995 --> 00:13:18,747
before we met here
this evening.

264
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,957
In the principal's office.

265
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:23,084
So far, this method
has never failed me.

266
00:13:24,586 --> 00:13:27,130
And I have no reason to
believe it will today.

267
00:13:27,213 --> 00:13:28,840
Yeah but... that still
doesn't change the fact

268
00:13:28,923 --> 00:13:30,842
that no one got in here.

269
00:13:30,925 --> 00:13:33,511
Poltergeists are a form
of latent mental powers...

270
00:13:33,595 --> 00:13:34,804
Often by people

271
00:13:34,888 --> 00:13:36,723
who have an unconscious
craving for attention.

272
00:13:36,806 --> 00:13:38,308
When stress is introduced,

273
00:13:38,391 --> 00:13:41,186
self-defense-type mechanism
reacts in the brain.

274
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:43,563
hypnotic suggestions
can become a reality

275
00:13:43,646 --> 00:13:45,190
in these types
of situations.

276
00:13:46,858 --> 00:13:48,526
Craving attention?

277
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:49,736
I know who that is.

278
00:13:49,819 --> 00:13:51,196
Stop grandstanding.

279
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,365
Are you really
that desperate?

280
00:13:53,448 --> 00:13:55,158
That girl is
such a weirdo.

281
00:13:55,241 --> 00:13:56,951
She's been like that
since middle school.

282
00:13:57,035 --> 00:13:58,620
Yeah she's a freak.

283
00:14:01,498 --> 00:14:02,916
So you're saying...

284
00:14:02,999 --> 00:14:04,751
That I'm responsible for this?

285
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,712
From the moment I met you

286
00:14:07,796 --> 00:14:10,006
I knew you were trying
to impress me...

287
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:12,050
For example, you claimed
to have seen spirits

288
00:14:12,133 --> 00:14:14,135
that still remained
here from the war.

289
00:14:14,219 --> 00:14:16,721
However, there is no
evidence of this area

290
00:14:16,805 --> 00:14:18,348
being bombed
during the war,

291
00:14:18,431 --> 00:14:21,017
or of this building being
used as a hospital.

292
00:14:21,101 --> 00:14:22,769
In fact, there was
never a hospital

293
00:14:22,852 --> 00:14:24,813
built on this land, period.

294
00:14:24,896 --> 00:14:26,606
That means that you
were either mistaken...

295
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:29,067
or intentionally lying
to me and the others.

296
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,527
I'm not a liar.

297
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,028
At first I thought

298
00:14:32,112 --> 00:14:34,030
you were just pretending to
be spiritually sensitive ...

299
00:14:34,114 --> 00:14:35,323
so when things
started happening

300
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:37,409
that could only be
explained as a poltergeist,

301
00:14:37,492 --> 00:14:39,327
I became quite perplexed.

302
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:41,830
My scientific experiments and
Miss Hara's psychic readings

303
00:14:41,913 --> 00:14:43,206
both came up clean;

304
00:14:43,289 --> 00:14:45,417
we determined there
were no spirits.

305
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,794
That means the haunting
was of human origin...

306
00:14:47,877 --> 00:14:50,046
Poltergeist activity is
often caused by children

307
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,881
in their early teens ...

308
00:14:51,965 --> 00:14:53,174
There are numerous
cases involving

309
00:14:53,258 --> 00:14:55,051
teenaged girls
in particular.

310
00:14:55,135 --> 00:14:56,886
It's a form of
psychokinesis

311
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:59,806
that can occur during
periods of great stress.

312
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:02,809
Please, look at me.

313
00:15:02,892 --> 00:15:04,853
Acknowledge that I exist.

314
00:15:04,936 --> 00:15:05,937
Ever since middle school,

315
00:15:06,021 --> 00:15:07,397
you were known
amongst your peers

316
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,774
for being sensitive
to spirits,

317
00:15:09,858 --> 00:15:11,192
but once it was proven by me

318
00:15:11,276 --> 00:15:13,069
that the strange
phenomena happening here

319
00:15:13,153 --> 00:15:15,363
was in fact due to
ground subsidence,

320
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:17,574
you naturally lost whatever
confidence or faith

321
00:15:17,657 --> 00:15:19,576
you held before in your
own psychic abilities.

322
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,620
This caused you
immense anxiety

323
00:15:22,704 --> 00:15:24,831
because it went against
your own beliefs.

324
00:15:24,914 --> 00:15:27,584
And although you could see
the merits of my evidence,

325
00:15:27,667 --> 00:15:30,628
you still wanted to believe
the spirits were to blame.

326
00:15:30,712 --> 00:15:33,214
You told yourself
there was no other way.

327
00:15:33,298 --> 00:15:35,175
You simply couldn't
face the truth.

328
00:15:39,429 --> 00:15:42,349
You had no idea
you did it...

329
00:15:42,432 --> 00:15:45,310
I firmly believe that you're
a latent psychic, Kuroda.

330
00:15:45,393 --> 00:15:46,561
And that means?

331
00:15:46,644 --> 00:15:47,896
A latent psychic

332
00:15:47,979 --> 00:15:50,148
is someone who has
supernatural abilities...

333
00:15:50,231 --> 00:15:53,943
She's not aware of it
but she has levels of PK.

334
00:15:54,027 --> 00:15:55,779
I'll just say this
for your sake Mai...

335
00:15:55,862 --> 00:15:58,323
PK is short for
psychokinesis.

336
00:15:58,406 --> 00:15:59,282
Thank you...

337
00:15:59,366 --> 00:16:00,909
I'm so grateful.

338
00:16:00,992 --> 00:16:02,619
She believed that there
had to be spirits present

339
00:16:02,702 --> 00:16:04,162
in the old schoolhouse

340
00:16:04,245 --> 00:16:07,957
in order to attract the
attention of those around her.

341
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:11,211
In order to be
who she was.

342
00:16:11,294 --> 00:16:13,421
You know... I think
I can understand...

343
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:14,547
It's natural really.

344
00:16:14,631 --> 00:16:15,882
Huh?

345
00:16:15,965 --> 00:16:17,425
Think about it.

346
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:19,678
Everyone wants to believe
they're special in some way...

347
00:16:19,761 --> 00:16:21,429
A desire to stand
out from the crowd

348
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:23,139
and be a unique
as a person...

349
00:16:23,223 --> 00:16:24,766
It could be a talent
or just the hope

350
00:16:24,849 --> 00:16:28,478
that you're recognized as an
honest and kind human being.

351
00:16:28,561 --> 00:16:29,896
In your case, Kuroda,

352
00:16:29,979 --> 00:16:31,064
I would imagine
it's your ability

353
00:16:31,147 --> 00:16:33,191
to communicate
with spirits.

354
00:16:39,948 --> 00:16:42,242
Does that explanation
satisfy everyone?

355
00:16:42,325 --> 00:16:43,868
Not quite. According
to that account,

356
00:16:43,952 --> 00:16:45,620
her elevated
stress levels came

357
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:47,914
after you gave us your little
theory on ground subsidence

358
00:16:47,997 --> 00:16:49,332
or whatever it was.

359
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:50,750
What about me getting
stuck in that room,

360
00:16:50,834 --> 00:16:51,835
or the video being erased?

361
00:16:51,918 --> 00:16:53,586
Explain that.

362
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:56,381
The reason you became trapped
in that room is simple...

363
00:16:56,464 --> 00:16:58,383
There was a nail sticking
out from the floor.

364
00:16:58,466 --> 00:17:00,260
That's it?

365
00:17:00,343 --> 00:17:02,012
Open up! I'm trapped!

366
00:17:03,805 --> 00:17:05,265
I had noticed it that day

367
00:17:05,348 --> 00:17:06,599
but I never mentioned it

368
00:17:06,683 --> 00:17:09,144
because I didn't feel it
was necessary at the time.

369
00:17:09,227 --> 00:17:12,564
Then, someone did
that on purpose...?

370
00:17:12,647 --> 00:17:14,357
Was it you?

371
00:17:14,441 --> 00:17:17,318
You were just trying to get back
a little at Miss Matsuzaki ...

372
00:17:17,402 --> 00:17:19,529
After all, she had verbally
attacked you outside

373
00:17:19,612 --> 00:17:20,864
just moments before.

374
00:17:20,947 --> 00:17:22,449
What about the video?

375
00:17:22,532 --> 00:17:24,784
The videotape was
intentionally erased...

376
00:17:24,868 --> 00:17:26,161
When you became trapped,

377
00:17:26,244 --> 00:17:28,371
we all left the base
to come to your aid.

378
00:17:28,455 --> 00:17:30,707
There was plenty of time
for someone to slip in here

379
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,959
and erase the tape
without ever being seen.

380
00:17:34,461 --> 00:17:36,963
This is ridiculous.

381
00:17:37,047 --> 00:17:38,548
What are we supposed
to do now...?

382
00:17:38,631 --> 00:17:40,675
The principal hired all of
us to get this place ready

383
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,510
so they can continue
construction.

384
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:45,597
I plan to report the following
story to the principal.

385
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,390
The old schoolhouse
was haunted by those

386
00:17:47,474 --> 00:17:49,476
who died here
during the war.

387
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:51,895
They have all been exorcised and
the structure is now clean

388
00:17:51,978 --> 00:17:53,855
of any paranormal activity.

389
00:17:53,938 --> 00:17:55,190
That sound okay...

390
00:17:55,273 --> 00:17:59,402
Kuroda?

391
00:17:59,486 --> 00:18:01,279
That's very kind
of you, Naru...

392
00:18:01,363 --> 00:18:03,031
But will you really lie
to the principal...?

393
00:18:03,114 --> 00:18:05,825
He deserves to know
the real story.

394
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:07,452
Kuroda's doing an
excellent job

395
00:18:07,535 --> 00:18:09,496
suppressing her
feelings now...

396
00:18:09,579 --> 00:18:12,374
I don't think it's necessary
to embarrass her any further.

397
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:15,460
Wow... Naru...

398
00:18:16,544 --> 00:18:19,547
Ooh... I had no idea
you were so sensitive...

399
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:21,257
Do you have a girlfriend?

400
00:18:21,341 --> 00:18:23,760
I'm not sure I fully
understand your question.

401
00:18:23,843 --> 00:18:25,970
I'm saying I wouldn't mind
getting to know you better...

402
00:18:26,054 --> 00:18:28,139
Even though you
are quite young.

403
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:30,016
Although I do
appreciate the offer...

404
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,309
I must decline...

405
00:18:31,393 --> 00:18:33,687
I'm too used to looking
at myself in the mirror.

406
00:18:37,023 --> 00:18:38,149
Let's get serious

407
00:18:38,233 --> 00:18:40,735
and decide who's getting
credit for this job.

408
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:42,779
Everyone contributed
equally...

409
00:18:42,862 --> 00:18:44,322
Are we all okay with that?

410
00:18:48,785 --> 00:18:50,370
And Mai.

411
00:18:50,453 --> 00:18:52,205
I already know, boss!

412
00:18:52,288 --> 00:18:54,416
Lin... Let's start
breaking camp.

413
00:18:54,499 --> 00:18:55,709
Right.

414
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:03,550
That wasn't such a
big deal after all.

415
00:19:03,633 --> 00:19:05,844
Admit it. You were scared
in there, weren't you?

416
00:19:05,927 --> 00:19:06,970
You'd like that,
wouldn't you?

417
00:19:07,053 --> 00:19:08,847
Well, I guess this is it.

418
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,557
The investigation's over,

419
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,977
everyone's leaving and
its back to school for me.

420
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,395
Shouldn't you be
heading to class?

421
00:19:16,396 --> 00:19:18,648
I was gonna help you
pack up everything...

422
00:19:18,732 --> 00:19:19,941
After all you are
still my boss

423
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:21,443
for the next few minutes.

424
00:19:21,526 --> 00:19:22,944
I can handle it.

425
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:25,155
Why don't you head
back to class?

426
00:19:25,238 --> 00:19:26,740
I'd hate to see you
plummet even further

427
00:19:26,823 --> 00:19:28,992
into the depths of dumb.

428
00:19:29,075 --> 00:19:31,661
Geez, you must really enjoy
putting me down, don't you...?!

429
00:19:31,745 --> 00:19:33,580
I'm a lot smarter
than you take me for!

430
00:19:36,207 --> 00:19:37,751
See ya later jerkface!

431
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:41,212
I can't believe
how cold he is!

432
00:19:41,296 --> 00:19:42,756
He's acting like he
doesn't even care!

433
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:44,090
That's it!

434
00:19:44,174 --> 00:19:45,550
From this moment
on I'm forgetting

435
00:19:45,633 --> 00:19:48,094
that Naru the Narcissist
even exists!

436
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:01,418
That's amazing, Kuroda!

437
00:21:01,501 --> 00:21:03,920
So the stories about the
ghosts were true after all!

438
00:21:04,004 --> 00:21:05,880
I can't believe
it collapsed!

439
00:21:07,674 --> 00:21:08,675
Cheer up Mai.

440
00:21:08,758 --> 00:21:09,926
We're the ones who
should be sighing.

441
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,511
Yeah, what the heck Mai?

442
00:21:11,594 --> 00:21:12,846
Kazuya's gone forever

443
00:21:12,929 --> 00:21:15,140
and you didn't think to
ask for his address...?

444
00:21:15,223 --> 00:21:17,434
We couldn't even find his
phone number in the book.

445
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,353
Attention Mai Taniyama.

446
00:21:20,437 --> 00:21:22,063
You have a telephone call.

447
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:24,315
Please report to the
front office immediately.

448
00:21:25,859 --> 00:21:27,777
-Hello?
-Hello Mai.

449
00:21:28,611 --> 00:21:30,572
Uh... Oh hi!

450
00:21:30,655 --> 00:21:32,866
There's no need to yell.

451
00:21:32,949 --> 00:21:34,159
I only know one person

452
00:21:34,242 --> 00:21:36,536
who can sound that
condescending...

453
00:21:36,619 --> 00:21:37,746
Naru.

454
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:39,789
So... To what do I
owe the pleasure?

455
00:21:39,873 --> 00:21:40,999
Your fee.

456
00:21:41,082 --> 00:21:42,417
My what?

457
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,419
Your money for the hours
you worked as my assistant.

458
00:21:44,502 --> 00:21:46,796
If you don't want it I could
always give it to charity.

459
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,257
Geez! This guys all business!

460
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:50,508
I'll send the
check out today

461
00:21:50,592 --> 00:21:51,885
so you should have it soon.

462
00:21:51,968 --> 00:21:53,303
And I was curious

463
00:21:53,386 --> 00:21:55,472
if your school would
allow you to have a job.

464
00:21:55,555 --> 00:21:56,639
If you're interested,

465
00:21:56,723 --> 00:21:58,141
I have a position
open for you.

466
00:21:58,224 --> 00:21:59,309
It's just office work,

467
00:21:59,392 --> 00:22:01,144
but it will be good
experience for you.

468
00:22:01,227 --> 00:22:04,022
Sure...! That
sounds great!

469
00:22:04,105 --> 00:22:05,106
Then come on down
to my office

470
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,900
to fill out some paperwork.

471
00:22:06,983 --> 00:22:08,943
It's in Shibuya,
off Dogenzaka.

472
00:22:10,111 --> 00:22:11,446
And thanks for
all your help.

473
00:22:11,529 --> 00:22:13,448
You were an
excellent assistant.

474
00:22:13,531 --> 00:22:14,783
I'll be seeing you soon.

475
00:22:20,121 --> 00:22:21,831
That's the story of
how I came to work

476
00:22:21,915 --> 00:22:23,458
at Shibuya Psychic Research...

477
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:24,834
or SPR for short,

478
00:22:24,918 --> 00:22:27,754
if you want to know how us
industry insiders say it.

479
00:22:28,797 --> 00:22:35,804
[Music]

480
00:24:01,514 --> 00:24:03,475
Next time we move on
to File number two,

481
00:24:03,558 --> 00:24:04,809
The Doll House.

482
00:24:04,893 --> 00:24:06,561
Dolls can be
pretty creepy.
