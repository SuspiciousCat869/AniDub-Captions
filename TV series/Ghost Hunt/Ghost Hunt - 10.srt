1
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:11,583
Masako had fallen victim
to the zuzhou curse...

2
00:00:11,666 --> 00:00:15,000
and the rest of us were starting
to feel danger closing in.

3
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:17,791
Is Kasai really behind all
of these awful things...?

4
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:19,291
It just doesn't feel right.

5
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:23,291
I know that Kasai
is innocent.

6
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:26,708
I can't say it's anything
more than my gut feeling...

7
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:30,541
but it's so strong I have to
believe it with all my heart.

8
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:32,166
And then...

9
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,291
zuzhou even came after me.

10
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:36,541
Anybody, help!

11
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:39,666
Burn the hitogata,

12
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,041
throw the ashes
in the river...

13
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:43,125
and the power of the
enmi will be broken.

14
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,583
But after saying that...

15
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:46,333
he suddenly...

16
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:47,750
Naru!

17
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:55,875
[Music]

18
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:30,833
Naru!

19
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:32,583
Somebody find a phone...

20
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:33,666
he needs an ambulance.

21
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:45,625
Okay, let's go ahead and
get rid of the hitogata...

22
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,333
After that... we should
go back to the office

23
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:49,541
and wait for Lin
to contact us.

24
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:51,583
We won't change our
strategy or pull out of here

25
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,375
unless Naru
gives the word.

26
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:54,500
You're right...

27
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:56,833
Let's do it.

28
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:59,083
This is all my fault...

29
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:01,125
it's because I didn't
let go of Naru's hand...

30
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,958
I'm such an idiot...

31
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:08,375
I'll never forgive myself

32
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:09,791
if something happens to him.

33
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,500
Hey, don't worry,
Naru's gonna be fine ...

34
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,083
cheer up okay...

35
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:16,958
let's go make a
monster bonfire.

36
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,666
On sunba nisunba un
bazaar un hatta...

37
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,416
jaku un ban koku!

38
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:31,833
We found the dolls,
but who's the hexer...?

39
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:36,041
Who would put a death curse
on me, Masako, and Naru?

40
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:38,750
I don't want to
believe it's Kasai...

41
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:41,000
but... could it
somehow... be true?

42
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,541
Hey...

43
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:49,708
what happened to Mai?

44
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:52,416
Huh, I guess she must have
wandered off somewhere...

45
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,708
Did you see her?

46
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:55,125
I thought she followed
us back from the river.

47
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:56,791
Yeah me too,
because we said

48
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,833
we were gonna meet here
and wait for Lin...

49
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:00,875
That's strange...
Where do you think she is?

50
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,875
So... how is
Mr. Shibuya doing?

51
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:07,708
I haven't heard...

52
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:10,958
but... you know if anything
bad happens to Naru...

53
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:14,166
I'll never forgive
whoever's responsible.

54
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,000
Oh,... and you think
that's me, don't you?

55
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,666
You think I cursed you ...

56
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,958
you and Masako Hara and
your boss Mr. Shibuya.

57
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:24,083
You think I did the same
thing with Mr. oshino

58
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:26,083
and the other
people who got hurt,

59
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,875
and that I'm making all these
scary things happen around here.

60
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:29,791
Why don't you
just come out

61
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:32,000
and say you
think I'm guilty!

62
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,458
I can't...!

63
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:36,833
'cause I've never
really believed you are.

64
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,958
It's not very logical...

65
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,333
But...

66
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:42,458
I can just feel
it in my heart.

67
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:46,625
I know that Kasai
is innocent.

68
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:47,625
So defend yourself...

69
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,708
It's not you!

70
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,916
Kasai, you know you're
not the kind of person

71
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,250
who would cast curses
or hurt people.

72
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:55,833
So why won't you say it?!

73
00:04:58,625 --> 00:04:59,916
Um, excuse me...

74
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Miss Ubusuna?

75
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,708
Yes, what is it?

76
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:04,166
I wanted to tell Mai

77
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,250
we just got a phone
call from Mr. Shibuya.

78
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:07,375
Naru called?!

79
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,250
Are you sure he's here?

80
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,125
I don't see his
name anywhere.

81
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:14,125
This is the room
number Lin told me...

82
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,333
if we're wrong we can
always say that we're sorry.

83
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:19,666
Come in.

84
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,375
What's up Lin...?

85
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:22,750
Hey Naru!

86
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:27,791
Talk about a
fashion overhaul.

87
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,708
I like him in white.

88
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:31,041
So how are you
feeling, man?

89
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,666
It was just mild anemia...

90
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,166
nothing worth
talking about...

91
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,083
What did you do
with the hitogata?

92
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:37,916
We burned them up and threw
the ashes into the river,

93
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,291
like you told us to...

94
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:42,166
Now all that's left is to
find whoever made them.

95
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,958
I'm almost positive I've
figured that one out.

96
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:46,833
You have proof that
it's the Kasai girl?

97
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:49,291
Of course, who
else would it be?

98
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:50,708
I'd like to meet
with the culprit

99
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:52,166
and have a little chat.

100
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,875
Then this case
will be closed

101
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:55,375
and we can move onto
something else...

102
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:56,750
you two can go now.

103
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:59,083
Wait a sec... we just
barely got here, Naru!

104
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,833
You mean you're not
even gonna let us in on

105
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,875
who we've been looking for?!

106
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,750
We need to handle this
carefully, that's all.

107
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,208
Well guess what...

108
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,416
I made a commitment to
this case just like you...!

109
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,666
And I think I deserve
to know who the bastard is

110
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,708
that we've been
hunting down.

111
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:12,791
You're out of your mind

112
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:14,291
if you think I'm
gonna back out now

113
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,958
when we're so
close to the truth.

114
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,416
Oh, Naru...!
Thank goodness...

115
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,875
Oh my gosh is it true
that you're gonna be ok?

116
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:23,500
Yuko... why're you here?

117
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,041
I asked her to come...

118
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:26,291
Is Kasai with you?

119
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:27,416
Yeah, she's here.

120
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:34,208
And one more...
come on in.

121
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:36,333
Hello... please excuse me...

122
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:38,416
I hope I'm not
intruding on everyone.

123
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:44,583
I have a couple
of questions.

124
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,000
The first one...

125
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:48,125
is for Yuko and Kasai...

126
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,666
did either of
you hear about me

127
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,416
being an onmyouji
from talking to Mai?

128
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,750
Being a what?

129
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:54,916
Yeah, I did...

130
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,166
But so what?

131
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,416
Did you pass that
information along to anyone?

132
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,791
What the hell kinda
difference would it make

133
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,291
if I told anybody...

134
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,458
Why are you asking
these stupid questions?!

135
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:05,791
Just say I'm guilty...

136
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,208
Just say I like
to curse people!

137
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:08,333
Kasai stop...

138
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:09,625
I'm not stupid,

139
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,000
why else would you have
asked me to come here?

140
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,708
I need you to answer
the question...

141
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:17,291
You must've told someone
that I was an onmyouji.

142
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:18,708
Now, who was it?

143
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,708
I suppose Kasai
did confide to me

144
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:24,250
that she'd heard that.

145
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:25,583
But please rest assured

146
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,916
I haven't shared
it with anyone else.

147
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,166
I appreciate that.

148
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,875
I have just one more
question to ask...

149
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,666
where are you from,
Miss Ubusuna?

150
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,041
I'm from Fukushima...

151
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:37,458
but why do you ask?

152
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,041
Fukushima...

153
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,666
thank you very much.

154
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,125
The case is solved...

155
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:43,625
I believe I have a complete
picture of the events

156
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:44,833
at Yuasa...

157
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:46,458
and the person
who's behind them.

158
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:48,291
You know who did it?

159
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,041
You figured it out
from those questions?

160
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:51,208
It's really not that hard

161
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:53,375
if you consider the
facts of the case.

162
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:56,333
We're dealing with zuzhou that
uses enmi, or hitogata...

163
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:59,166
and if the hitogata are found
and disposed of properly

164
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,583
the hex should be broken.

165
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,375
Ok... so who is it?!

166
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:05,083
You're trying to say it's me,
that I did it, aren't you?!

167
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,541
Calm down...

168
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:07,833
it's not you.

169
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:11,875
I doubt you know how
to make a hitogata...

170
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,250
or have the skill to
perform the zuzhou curse...

171
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:15,875
therefore, we
can rule you out.

172
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:17,708
Alright, then who is it!

173
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,291
Yeah, quit
stalling Naru...

174
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:20,125
who did it?

175
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:23,000
Our hexer...

176
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:26,958
Is Miss Ubusuna.

177
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:33,875
Miss Ubusuna...

178
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,875
did all of this?

179
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:37,791
Inside a manhole
on the grounds...

180
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,041
we found hitogata

181
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,500
with the names of myself,
Mai, and Miss Hara,

182
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:42,958
as well as Mr. oshino

183
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,541
and many other people
at the school.

184
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:47,666
You were the one,
who made them,

185
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,541
aren't you, Miss Ubusuna?

186
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,333
I don't know what
you're talking about...

187
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:53,250
what on earth
is a hitogata?

188
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:56,041
The straw dolls used to
cast the zuzhou hex...

189
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,291
If there are any
more out there

190
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:59,083
please tell me where
to find them.

191
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:00,375
And I want you to promise

192
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:02,500
that you won't create
another one ever again.

193
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,041
How could I make
such a promise

194
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,666
when I've done
nothing wrong?

195
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,291
You are guilty,
Miss Ubusuna.

196
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,208
There must be
some confusion.

197
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,875
All of the evidence points
to your involvement.

198
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:14,250
And what sort of
proof do you have?

199
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:15,291
You're wrong...!

200
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:16,916
I caused all of
it to happen...

201
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,625
I'm the one who's guilty!

202
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,875
The victims hurt you...

203
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,708
they were those who
attacked and rejected you

204
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,958
and publicly ridiculed
your psychic powers.

205
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,000
Which makes it appear

206
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,500
that the motivation for the
culprit to begin casting curses

207
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,791
was The Kasai Panic.

208
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:35,333
then correct me
if I'm mistaken

209
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:38,375
but wouldn't that make Kasai
more of a suspect than I am?

210
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:42,666
She even confessed to
you just now, didn't she?

211
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,416
Miss Kei!

212
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,916
Actually, no...

213
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,125
Kasai could be ruled out

214
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,375
because of her relationship
with Murayama.

215
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:50,875
Murayama?

216
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,833
Yes, the first student
that had an accident

217
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,750
due to sitting
at that desk...

218
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,375
didn't they know
each other, Yuko?

219
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,583
Huh...?uh... yeah...

220
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,458
I'm pretty sure that
Murayama and Kasai

221
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:02,291
were both members of
the Liberal Arts Club

222
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:03,541
for a little while,

223
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:06,166
before Kasai quit and
joined the biology club.

224
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,625
Were you really?

225
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:08,916
For a little bit...

226
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,583
sophomore year.

227
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:13,041
It was weird when Murayama
yelled at her that time...

228
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,958
I remember we were all
sort of shocked by the fact

229
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:17,000
that she actually had
the courage to talk

230
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,416
to an upperclassman
in such a nasty way.

231
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,208
If our culprit personally knew
the student she was targeting,

232
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,041
she wouldn't have had
to go to the trouble

233
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,500
of putting a blanket
curse on that desk...

234
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,333
so why did she do it...?

235
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,250
why would someone
choose to curse a seat

236
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,000
instead of a person?

237
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,166
It's simple...

238
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,583
the hexer didn't
know Murayama

239
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,083
or what she looked like.

240
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,541
Based on what
you've just said

241
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:40,750
I don't think you have enough
evidence to convict me.

242
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,458
I could have easily
asked around

243
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,458
if I wanted to find
out what her name was.

244
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:46,375
Following Murayama's
complaint...

245
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:48,833
those who denied the existence
of psychic abilities

246
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,166
banded together...

247
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,000
and made their
feelings known...

248
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:55,291
by that point you and the others
were made to feel isolated.

249
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,250
Would you really have
felt free to ask?

250
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,416
We also have to consider...

251
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,000
the names used...

252
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,791
Three people outside
of Yuasa High School

253
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,416
were targets of curses...

254
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,041
that would be Mai...

255
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,208
Masako Hara and
then myself.

256
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:12,083
Aside from Miss Hara,

257
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:14,708
whose celebrity makes
it common knowledge...

258
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,250
there are a limited
number of people

259
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,583
who would know Mai's
name or mine.

260
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,125
Speaking for myself...

261
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,583
I can only remember
disclosing my full name...

262
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:23,541
to the school principal...

263
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:25,208
and then to you...

264
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:26,875
in the lab when
we first met.

265
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,583
I'm Kazuya Shibuya.

266
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:33,125
Oh my gosh, I told
her my name too.

267
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:34,791
Goodness...

268
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,291
what's your name?

269
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:39,833
Mai Taniyama.

270
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:42,333
The principal doesn't
know Mai's name...

271
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:44,666
so that would mean...
as far as I can tell...

272
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,375
that you're the
only person here

273
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:50,000
who knows all three of our
proper names, Miss Ubusuna.

274
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,875
Why would I want to
put a curse on you?

275
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:54,375
What kind of motive could
I possibly have...?

276
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:55,791
I don't even know you.

277
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,166
A few minutes ago...

278
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,083
you said that Kasai told
you she'd talked to Mai...

279
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:02,083
who told her that I
was an onmyouji...

280
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:03,208
isn't that right?

281
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:04,708
Yes. And...??

282
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,208
Zuzhou hexes come
from onmyodo ...

283
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:09,000
If I were an onmyojii,

284
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:11,458
I might be able to
put a stop to them...

285
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:13,041
So you tried to
get rid of me

286
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:15,250
before I could figure
it out and act.

287
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:18,458
if that's true then why
would I bring Mai into it?

288
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:19,875
Mai has demonstrated

289
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:23,291
unusually sharp
intuition on this case.

290
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,291
For example she
was the first person

291
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:28,250
to declare that
Kasai was innocent.

292
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:29,416
She's not the one...

293
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,041
I know it!

294
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,250
You were afraid people
would start to believe her...

295
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,083
so you cast a
curse on Mai.

296
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,250
It's not true...

297
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,583
Miss kei's been the only
one who believed in me!

298
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,000
But Kasai...

299
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:45,041
I did it...

300
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,583
I said it in assembly
in front of everyone!

301
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,625
I'll curse you to death!

302
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:52,541
I wanted them all
to just go away...

303
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,416
all of those people
who made fun of me

304
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,208
and treated
Miss Kei like garbage

305
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:58,416
just because she
was my friend.

306
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,125
And then people started
having accidents...

307
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:05,375
Mr. oshino and Masako
were really hurt.

308
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,333
I don't know what
I'm supposed to do,

309
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:09,291
I can't help it.

310
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:10,541
It's me...!

311
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,083
It's all my fault...!

312
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,166
I cursed them and then
everything started...

313
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,208
I didn't mean to...

314
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:16,500
It's easy to understand

315
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:18,750
why you'd want to protect
your teacher, Kasai...

316
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,791
she was the one to
stand up and defend you.

317
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:23,166
But there's no way a
novice caused this...

318
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,750
you simply don't have
the ability to do it...

319
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,875
you've even had difficulty
bending spoons lately,

320
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,541
and that's a much
easier skill.

321
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,500
Stop! Right now...!

322
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,125
You were about
to bend the spoon

323
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,083
using the edge of the
chair, weren't you?

324
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,166
You do realize that

325
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,708
if anyone caught
you doing that trick

326
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:41,458
they'd never
believe you again.

327
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:42,708
Where do you suppose

328
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,291
Kasai would have learned
that particular trick

329
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,875
to bend the spoon on the
edge of a chair, Miss Ubusuna?

330
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,666
I'm sure I don't know...

331
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,666
She learned it from you...

332
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,166
Yes... You passed
on your knowledge...

333
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,833
no one else would
know to do that.

334
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,083
You have a remarkable
understanding

335
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,625
of psychic powers
and parapsychology...

336
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:03,000
with an interest in some
specialized fields as well.

337
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,041
I began to suspect

338
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:07,583
that your involvement
with Kasai's powers

339
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:08,958
and her well-being

340
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,458
wasn't purely for
philanthropic purposes.

341
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:12,875
So I followed my hunch

342
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:16,125
and started poking around
in some old papers.

343
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:18,708
It wasn't long before
I came across this.

344
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,000
According to the date here

345
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,500
it was during
the psychic craze

346
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,291
that happened when
you were a child...

347
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:25,541
Among the children who claimed
to be able to bend spoons

348
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:26,958
was a little girl...

349
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:28,708
named Kei Ubusuna.

350
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,625
As the craze grew
and drew attention...

351
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,125
many children
began to come forward

352
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:40,041
and claim they too
had psychic powers.

353
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:43,041
At first, the children
became media darlings...

354
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:45,875
both television and print
covered the stories,

355
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:48,458
running specials and lavishing
them with attention...

356
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:50,833
but as curiosity
began to fade,

357
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:52,916
the public began to
look down on the kids...

358
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,125
people began to
call them fakes...

359
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:58,083
and questioned whether any of
them had any real powers at all.

360
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,625
One of the girls who came
forward during that time

361
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:04,041
was a girl named
Kei Ubusuna,

362
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,250
from the Fukushima prefecture.

363
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:07,541
I wasn't a fake...

364
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,083
I could do it...!

365
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:10,666
I really did
bend those spoons

366
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,500
and a lot of
people saw it!

367
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,875
It's just...
sometimes it was easy

368
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,666
and other times it
just wouldn't work...

369
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,208
and then that reporter
came to see me...

370
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:23,333
If you really
have these powers

371
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:25,166
you should be able
to bend this...

372
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,875
would you like to give
it a try and show me?

373
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:29,250
I thought if I failed

374
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,458
he would write about
what I liar I was...

375
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,083
and everyone
would believe him.

376
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,458
So just that once

377
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:36,125
I decided to use
a little trick

378
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:37,958
that another one of the
"psychic" kids had shown me

379
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:38,875
to bend the spoon...

380
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,416
I was just so nervous!

381
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,208
There was a
photographer...

382
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:44,500
He caught me!

383
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:55,125
No one was there to tell me
I didn't have to fake it.

384
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,791
I didn't have
anyone to teach me

385
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,500
that when you can't
make it work...

386
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:03,458
It's okay to
just admit it!

387
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:05,375
I'm sorry...

388
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:08,041
it's a shame Japan left
the reputation of ESP

389
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,708
and psychic research in
the hands of the media.

390
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:13,750
There were no credible research
institutions at the time

391
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:15,541
to determine whether
there was real truth

392
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:19,041
to the children's
claims and abilities.

393
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,625
This should never
have been left

394
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,750
to the court of
public opinion...

395
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:25,958
the media will always care more
about headlines than truth.

396
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,166
Did you really do it?

397
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,500
At first...

398
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:34,375
I only wanted to defend
Kasai's talent...

399
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:35,916
But then it got crazy

400
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,875
and people started
saying things...

401
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,666
like "why don't you
really help that girl

402
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,875
instead of encouraging her!"

403
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:44,666
and asking me how I could
call myself a teacher.

404
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,791
And so you...

405
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:47,833
That's right.

406
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:51,958
It was just supposed
to be a little prank.

407
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:55,791
How can she be smiling?!

408
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,250
About ten years ago...

409
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,166
an unusual car
wreck occurred

410
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:03,541
on a small street near
a Tokyo publishing firm.

411
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:04,708
Huh?

412
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,208
The driver, whose erratic
steering caused the accident,

413
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:11,666
gave a detailed
report to the police...

414
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,458
he is quoted as saying
that suddenly...

415
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:15,291
and seemingly
out of nowhere...

416
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:18,916
"A disembodied hand
appeared before my eyes."

417
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,916
Oh my gosh That's what
happened to Mr. oshino!

418
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26,166
the man who caused
the accident

419
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,458
also happened to be the reporter
who published your story.

420
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,750
Are you accusing
me of that, too?

421
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:34,000
It certainly
seems likely...

422
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:36,041
but if you did cause
the car to wreck...

423
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:38,166
then there's no way in
hell we'll believe

424
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,041
that you intended these 'pranks'
of yours to be harmless.

425
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,750
Luckily, no one
involved has died yet...

426
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,958
but it was only a
matter of time...

427
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,208
If we hadn't found that
hitogata in the desk

428
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:50,291
and another student
had been assigned there,

429
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:51,916
It's so creepy...

430
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:56,958
how can she keep smiling
through all of this?

431
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:59,166
Oh yes, that would
have been tragic...

432
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,166
but then...

433
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,416
if someone had died

434
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,916
maybe people would
have learned a lesson.

435
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,708
About respecting
things in this world

436
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:08,833
that can't be
explained by science.

437
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:11,333
How did all of
this happen...?!

438
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,750
Were people that freaked
out over Miss Ubusuna

439
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:17,000
and Kasai bending spoons?!

440
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:19,083
I don't think so...

441
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,416
I don't think this is
really about certain people

442
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,500
being right or wrong...

443
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,000
A lot of people
just went nuts over

444
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,416
psychic powers and curses.

445
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,791
It divided them.

446
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:34,125
Miss Ubusuna just got
caught up in revenge and fear,

447
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,000
and lost sight of
the responsibility

448
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:41,541
to use her power wisely,

449
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:42,791
Lin!

450
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,375
What are you doing...

451
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:48,750
you give those back!

452
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,916
You must be feeling exhausted
by now, Miss Ubusuna.

453
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:08,916
A zuzhou takes both mental
and physical strength.

454
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,375
And it seems you're beginning
to look pretty worn out.

455
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,833
Perhaps...

456
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,500
I suppose you
could be right.

457
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:24,250
If having powers makes you
as sad and crazy as that...

458
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,625
then...

459
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,250
I don't think I want 'em!

460
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:38,291
Whoa...

461
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,708
All of them?!

462
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:41,583
Wow, to miss that
many of them...

463
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,541
Yes, it's terribly
impressive, Mai.

464
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:44,750
Or something.

465
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,083
I knew it...

466
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:49,166
everyone, Mai is
a latent psychic.

467
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,166
I am?!

468
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,083
You've attempted to guess
which of the bulbs on the box

469
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,250
would light up and hit
the corresponding button

470
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:57,083
over a thousand
times now...

471
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,333
to not get even one hit

472
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:01,500
is almost a mathematical
impossibility.

473
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:02,750
I think it's clear that

474
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,791
this means Mai's sharp
instincts on this case

475
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:06,666
weren't a coincidence.

476
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,375
Well, I gotta say I
thought she was a rockstar

477
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,916
a long time ago...

478
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,833
Remember at the
creepy doll house...

479
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:14,375
she fell down the well and
had that trippy dream...

480
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,916
and then when the gas line
was on fire she saw that kid.

481
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:20,666
You absolutely sure
that wasn't a spirit?

482
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,500
Actually that
could be true...

483
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,333
Mai is extraordinarily
sensitive

484
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,916
when it comes to those
with intent to do harm.

485
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,041
She has a very natural
sense of self-preservation...

486
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:33,833
much like a wild animal...

487
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:37,041
she can instinctively
'sniff out' friend from foe.

488
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,333
So although Mai looks
ordinary on the outside,

489
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:41,041
inside she's
all jungle cat.

490
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,416
Who are you
calling an animal?

491
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,250
if that's true then I
guess bending spoons

492
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,166
makes you a big
hairy gorilla!

493
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,833
Hey, what is she
talking about...

494
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:51,750
tell me.

495
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,458
Mai!

496
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:54,916
You need to be
more careful...

497
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,916
I know...

498
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,625
Apparently you don't!

499
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,208
I know what you're
going to say...

500
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:00,708
I won't do it again.

501
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:01,958
Hold on, there's no way

502
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:03,583
we're gonna let you
off the hook now.

503
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:06,208
Naru, if you really have been
hiding that little ability away

504
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:07,791
I'm dying to see you do it.

505
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,833
I had no idea you
could do that.

506
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:13,000
Naru...

507
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,333
I don't have
much of a choice.

508
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:22,000
That was amazing!

509
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:24,791
Alright, Naru...

510
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:26,333
You may be able to
fake out these dupes

511
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:27,666
but I'm not buying it.

512
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,291
Monk, what are
you talking about?

513
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,458
Ahhh, you guys are so
freakin gullible

514
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,458
you'll believe anything...

515
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:34,791
Check it out...

516
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,791
he just bent it by pushing
it with his finger...

517
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:39,500
Look... you support the handle
end with your palm, like this,

518
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:41,000
try it.

519
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:42,750
Hey, he's right, it works!

520
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:43,958
You weren't using
psychic powers

521
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:46,291
you're just making
us look like idiots!

522
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:48,125
I expected more from you.

523
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:50,583
The best way to keep from
falling victim to a trickster

524
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:53,375
is to make sure you know all
of the trickster's secrets.

525
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:54,958
Trickster...?

526
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:57,833
Does he mean... that bending
the spoon in the biology lab

527
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,291
wasn't real, either?

528
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:02,458
I'll keep a lid on it...

529
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:03,541
I promise.

530
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:05,625
Alright... we'll see about that.

531
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,291
Man, I thought I was starting
to figure him out a little,

532
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:14,666
but now... I don't
think I know him at all.

533
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:23,000
[Music]

534
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:53,458
Next time, we get into file 4
"Ghost Story in the Park?!"

535
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:54,916
Finally, some fresh air!
