1
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:30,291
On kirikiri bazara baziri
hora manda manda un hatta!

2
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:32,833
On amirito
dohanba un hatta!

3
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:36,291
On biso hora daraki
shabezara hanjara un hatta.

4
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:38,916
On asan magini un hatta...

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
On shau-gya-rei
makasan maen SOWAKA!

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,333
If you bastards think
you can make it in now...

7
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:49,708
just try it!

8
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:53,916
Where's Father Brown?

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,833
He's getting Akifumi
and the rest of them.

10
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:57,583
They should be
here in no time.

11
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:59,291
Did they show up
down there too?

12
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:01,291
'Show up' isn't
the right phrase...

13
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:04,750
They've been attacked by
a mob of drowned corpses.

14
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:06,875
Its like we're in
a zombie movie.

15
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:10,250
That sounds like Katsuki!

16
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:11,375
Oh no!

17
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:21,041
John! Get to the base!

18
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:22,500
It's safe there!

19
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:23,458
What's happening?

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,125
Whatever you do, don't let
those white things touch you!

21
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:47,500
[Music]

22
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:56,666
[Music]

23
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:16,875
Mai!

24
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:18,125
Ayako...

25
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:19,916
I... I think I'm...

26
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,000
No blood...?

27
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:26,000
But I'm sure it
went through me.

28
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,833
Mai, what's wrong?

29
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,125
Monk! Behind you!

30
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:37,708
Are you okay?

31
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:39,250
What's it look like...?

32
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:40,958
I'm gonna be okay,

33
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,875
but man, does
this thing hurt!

34
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,000
Can you get up?

35
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:46,833
Yeah, now I'm
just angry...

36
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:50,000
Kyata hanjasa
hadaya sowaka!

37
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:54,458
They're glowing red.

38
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:57,083
Now open the door!

39
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:01,666
Mai! Thank goodness
you're alright.

40
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,125
Looks like everyone's
accounted for.

41
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:04,958
I'm gonna take
a nap here...

42
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:07,416
The cold floor's never
felt so comfortable.

43
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,791
Now's a good time
to get some rest...

44
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:13,041
I sense... they won't be
back for a little while.

45
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,583
If I were to fall
asleep the barrier

46
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,791
protecting us would
collapse immediately.

47
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:20,541
So... what are we
gonna do now?

48
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,916
First thing... Is we
wait 'till morning...

49
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,875
Once the sun rises
things should quiet down.

50
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,250
Naru!

51
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,750
He's fine...

52
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,958
Somehow he didn't wake up
through that whole ordeal.

53
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,250
-What is it?
-My shiki

54
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,375
that were knocked away in
the fight have returned.

55
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,041
Really?

56
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:43,333
So those were your shiki.

57
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,791
Yes...

58
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:47,291
Could you sense
their presence?

59
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:48,750
Yes...

60
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,958
It's starting to
make sense now...

61
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,833
It explains why the
spirits in this house

62
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,750
felt so empty and hollow.

63
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,291
The reason the spirits
possessing Naru

64
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,375
and the children feel
so vacant is because

65
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,125
they're different
than the norm...

66
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:03,375
They're in the service
of someone else

67
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:05,375
so they don't act
on their own.

68
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:08,000
They're basically slaves
with no free will,

69
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:10,083
left to the bidding
of their controller,

70
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,416
who exploits their
deepest personal grudges

71
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,375
and uses them as shiki.

72
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,333
These are feelings so
strong they prevent them

73
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:19,083
from finding eternal rest.

74
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,416
Who could be
doing this...?

75
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,000
And why?

76
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:28,458
Alright. Breaks over for me.

77
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,291
Time to get back to work.

78
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:32,250
But Monk you've been holding
up the barrier all night

79
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,958
and haven't
slept a wink.

80
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,291
Why don't you try
to get some sleep?

81
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,958
We just don't have
that kind of time ...

82
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:40,625
The longer we
wait the more

83
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,708
we're putting
ourselves at risk.

84
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,333
If we get attacked
again tonight,

85
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:46,416
I don't think we'll be
able to hold them off.

86
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,125
Lin stay here
with them...

87
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,083
I've gotta take
down the barrier...

88
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,333
If it goes much
longer it'll drain

89
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:56,791
what's left of my energy...

90
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:59,083
-Come on John.
-Right.

91
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,666
Wait, where
are you going?

92
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,083
Where do you think?

93
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,291
The san-roku mounds.

94
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:06,875
You heard the sutra
being recited, right?

95
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:09,375
We're up against
the three rokubu.

96
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,083
I'm pretty sure they're
taking advantage of the fact

97
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:12,875
that spirits are
attracted to the cave

98
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:15,750
so they can trap and enslave
them shortly after death.

99
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,666
That has to be what
happened with the peasants

100
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,291
that were beheaded
in the revolt,

101
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:22,208
as well as the princess and
her lover from the legend.

102
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:24,958
If you think about it, the
rokubu have had carte blanche

103
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:27,333
on every spirit from
the area for centuries.

104
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,666
So many innocent souls.

105
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,166
We have no other choice.

106
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,416
We have to act now.

107
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,625
I'll do it.

108
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:38,666
You guys should catch
up on your sleep...

109
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,041
You're practically
staggering right now.

110
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,833
No offense Ayako but this
is way out of your league.

111
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:45,500
Why don't you volunteer
after you've actually

112
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:46,958
done something productive.

113
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:48,333
Look Takigawa...

114
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm only volunteering
because I know I can do it.

115
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:52,750
you sure about this?

116
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,916
You're gonna have
to trust me...

117
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,125
I can do this...

118
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,625
Let me handle this one.

119
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:04,583
There aren't many places
like this left in the world.

120
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:07,625
I can sense a strong
energy from the past here.

121
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,833
The trees are
really alive.

122
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:11,416
-The trees?
-Yes...

123
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,750
When I was young we had a
gigantic camphor tree

124
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,666
in front of my
parents house.

125
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,541
It was absolutely
gorgeous...

126
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,041
It taught me a
lot of things

127
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,291
that I still keep
with me today.

128
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,750
And, It would always tell
me when the patients

129
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:26,541
from my parent's hospital
were going to die.

130
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,291
But whenever I would
tell my parents

131
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,833
about these prophecies,
they would scold me.

132
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:32,208
Wow.

133
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:33,916
To be honest, when
you get down to it,

134
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,625
I really don't have that
much power of my own...

135
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,500
However...

136
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,125
I am still a priestess.

137
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:44,500
Huh, she actually
sounds kind of cool.

138
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:52,541
Let's begin.

139
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:55,333
I stand here today to
beseech the gods

140
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,833
I call upon them to
descend from the heavens

141
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:00,375
and join us where
no gods dwell...

142
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,208
to end this...

143
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:04,166
ceaseless suffering.

144
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,375
I ask that my humble
plea may be heard...

145
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:09,541
and peace be restored...

146
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,750
unto the spirits
who are trapped...

147
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,250
in this haunted place

148
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:14,625
I don't get it.

149
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:17,958
She's reciting the same
prayer she always does...

150
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:21,166
but this time,
something's different.

151
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,000
May this grove reflect
the High, Heavenly Plain

152
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:26,750
and may the gods from all
corners come together as one.

153
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:29,083
It feels like the air
is getting clearer.

154
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:30,875
Rin... Pyo...

155
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:32,875
To... Sha...

156
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,791
Kai... Jin...

157
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,708
Retsu... Zai...

158
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:38,083
Zen!

159
00:08:58,458 --> 00:08:59,791
They disappeared.

160
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,250
It's Kazuyasu and Nao!

161
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,625
Come... The time for you
to achieve eternal sleep

162
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:21,458
has finally arrived.

163
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:39,625
Every time she
rings her bell...

164
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:41,583
the spirits vanish...

165
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,416
Is it possible that
all these spirits

166
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,083
are coming here because
they want to be purified?

167
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:53,666
Ayako! Behind you!

168
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:18,875
Well now... She didn't
need us after all.

169
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:21,250
If you've had that kind
of power all along,

170
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,833
why have you kept it
hidden all this time?

171
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:26,333
I've never hidden
it from anyone...

172
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:29,958
Like I said I only use it
when I know it'll work.

173
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:31,166
I don't normally
bring it up

174
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,041
because it sounds like
I'm making excuses.

175
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,458
Oh... We'd never
think that.

176
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:39,208
Up to this point there
haven't been any live trees.

177
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:42,083
When I first began you may have
noticed some elder spirts,

178
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:43,458
many with long beards,

179
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:44,958
emerging from the trees.

180
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,541
They are basically the
spirits of the trees,

181
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,208
and I borrow their power.

182
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,666
If a tree has
lost its spirit,

183
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,875
then it's as good as dead.

184
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,958
My rituals don't even need
to be done near a shrine.

185
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:57,916
Many shrines and
temples in the city

186
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
are in poor shape
as they get older,

187
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:01,458
but with the trees,

188
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:05,166
no matter what their age,
they are always the same.

189
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,125
So I guess it helped
that the mounds

190
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,583
happened to be
next to a grove,

191
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:08,833
but what if they
weren't...?

192
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:10,500
How would you have
gone about it then?

193
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,333
As long as they're
somewhere nearby,

194
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:15,208
I can summon the spirits to
wherever I need them to be.

195
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,583
Wait, I'm confused.

196
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,458
If it's that easy to do,
why didn't we do that

197
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:20,666
when were exorcising Eijiro?

198
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,208
My ritual has no effect
on human beings...

199
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:26,166
I'm really only capable
of purifying a spirit.

200
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,250
Besides, once I
utilize a tree,

201
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,791
I have to let it
rest for six months

202
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,708
before I can use it again.

203
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,541
So if I had tried to
use them on Eijiro,

204
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:34,916
I wouldn't have been
able to use them

205
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,916
when we needed
them the most.

206
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,041
So I guess that settles
everything, huh?

207
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:41,500
Not quite.

208
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:42,791
-uh? uh?
-Huh?

209
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:45,041
Remember, I only
do spirits...

210
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:47,583
but there is another
presence here...

211
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:48,583
something worse.

212
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,291
Well what is it?

213
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,583
Earlier I could sense a power
that wouldn't come near me

214
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:54,041
during the ritual...

215
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,458
If that power had
been a spirit

216
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:57,000
it would have wanted
to be purified,

217
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,708
but it was repelled.

218
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:00,791
I believe there's another
entity out there

219
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,333
we've yet to deal with...

220
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:04,000
It's very powerful and
it's been using the

221
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:06,625
Yoshimi family
as its shiki.

222
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:09,541
So it wasn't the
spirits of the rokubu.

223
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:12,750
No, I think they were being
used as its shiki as well.

224
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,041
Come to think of it,

225
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:16,083
Nao said something
about a monster...

226
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:18,708
If it's capable of
controlling so many spirits...

227
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:21,625
Then it has to be something with
a whole lot of power, right?

228
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,416
Which means that...

229
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,750
there's only one thing
that could harness

230
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,541
that level of power.

231
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,041
The Okobu...

232
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:29,458
Isn't it?

233
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,375
The piece of driftwood
that washed up in the cave...

234
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,500
It was shaped like a
statue of Buddha,

235
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:37,833
so they enclosed it in a
shrine built in its honor.

236
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:41,000
That makes it a
true yebisu...

237
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:44,458
Which means we're going
to have to take on a god.

238
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,708
Hey we're back.

239
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:53,875
What's the matter Monk?

240
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:57,083
Naru!

241
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,291
Of course!

242
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,458
Thanks to Ayako's
purification ritual,

243
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:07,375
the spirit possessing Naru
has been cleansed too!

244
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:10,041
You know it wouldn't hurt
for you to say thank you...

245
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,541
After all I had to put
aside my many resentments

246
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,541
towards you in
order to save you.

247
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,916
It's so good to see
you awake, Kazuya.

248
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,416
He's in kind
of a foul mood.

249
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,958
As usual!

250
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,291
Soo...

251
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:24,875
Anyway...

252
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,666
It's looking more and more
like the source of the curse

253
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,875
was not the spirits of the
rokubu like we thought.

254
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:31,333
It's the Okobu.

255
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:33,166
But how did
you know that?

256
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,375
my brain works
differently than yours.

257
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,125
I oughta...

258
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:38,583
Consider the shrine...

259
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:40,583
Behind it is the
cave by the sea...

260
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:42,583
with another
shrine inside it.

261
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:45,041
There you can find a
yebisu named Okobu.

262
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,875
There is a path from the
cave to the shrine

263
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:51,333
that's carved out of the
natural sea wall...

264
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:52,958
with steps made of stone.

265
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,041
Now why were
those constructed?

266
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,208
There's obviously some
meaning behind it.

267
00:13:57,291 --> 00:14:00,333
It's the divine figure
found within the shrine.

268
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:03,416
Its presence meant they
had no choice but to build it.

269
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,541
There's no way they would
have gone that far

270
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,500
if it were some minor god.

271
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:10,041
What's enshrined in that cave
is a god with enough power,

272
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:12,625
to influence people to
do its bidding.

273
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:15,083
According to some of the
folklore from this village...

274
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:16,875
cyclones and
tsunamis disappeared

275
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:18,833
after the Okobu
was worshipped...

276
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:20,125
However...

277
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:22,416
if the Iwai neglected
to worship the Okobu,

278
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,500
calamity would soon
strike the village.

279
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:26,000
What are Iwai?

280
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:27,958
They're basically
a kind of priest.

281
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,375
The shrine in
which the Okobu

282
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:31,541
was originally meant
to be worshipped...

283
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:35,125
is now cut off from the
smaller shrine inside the cave.

284
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,166
The house is what
caused the separation.

285
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,791
It was probably
part of the shrine

286
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,458
when it was first built.

287
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:42,916
The grounds surrounding the
shrine were probably divided

288
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,833
and sold as
individual properties.

289
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:47,875
The land where the Iwai
lived was divided

290
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:51,041
and sold when the five members
of the revolt were beheaded.

291
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:53,416
That seems to be the
most likely scenario.

292
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,125
Soon thereafter
that land was sold

293
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:56,958
and rezoned for
private housing...

294
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:58,458
It is the Okobu's
belief that

295
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,000
anyone who lives
on that land

296
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,333
must worship it as
their one and only god.

297
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:04,125
So when the unaware
tenants moved in

298
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,958
and neglected to worship
it, they were cursed.

299
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:10,166
Naru is amazing.

300
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,708
He solved the mystery
like it was nothing.

301
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:17,416
We now have to perform
an exorcism on the Okobu.

302
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,208
But is that
really necessary?

303
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:21,250
I mean all it needs is
to be worshipped, right?

304
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:22,916
Yes but if the
worshipping stops

305
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,708
the curse will start again.

306
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:27,833
This may only be a yebisu
but it's still a god...

307
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:29,791
That's a lot worse
than a monster...

308
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,500
Need I remind you
that you were the one

309
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,541
who said you can't
hunt monsters?

310
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,375
So we should look
the other way...?

311
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:36,750
You've got to be kidding.

312
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,250
Don't get me wrong.

313
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:40,458
I had a wonderful time
being possessed...

314
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:42,041
But it would be
downright rude of me

315
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:44,500
not to return the
favor in full.

316
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:55,708
Let's begin.

317
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:59,875
On haba haba kiuta saba
taruma saba saba kitsudo kan...

318
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:06,000
On data gato naoo
bay by ya sowaka...

319
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:09,458
On bata mari ni-oo
haybaya sowaka.

320
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:14,625
On bazara geenee
harach hataya sowaka.

321
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,750
It sounds... Like
a heart beating.

322
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,000
The... the wall.

323
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,416
The rock is pulsating...

324
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,125
and it's warm, like
a person's skin.

325
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,666
Now it's breathing...?

326
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:45,000
It's almost like the cave
itself is a living being!

327
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:47,625
Takigawa look!

328
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:49,083
The entrance is closing!

329
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,208
Not good.

330
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:55,791
Don't worry...
It'll open back up

331
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,166
when we terminate
the source.

332
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:02,750
I can't take this...!

333
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,000
Please Make it stop!

334
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,916
In the beginning
was the Word...

335
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,833
and the Word
was with God...

336
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:16,541
and the Word it was God.

337
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:20,083
He was with God
in the beginning.

338
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,208
Through him all
things were made.

339
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,625
Without him nothing was
made that has been made.

340
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,166
In him was life...

341
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,166
And that life was...
the light of all men...

342
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:46,833
Rin! Pyo! Toh! Sha!

343
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:49,625
Kai! Jin! Retsu! Zai! Zen!

344
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,458

345
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:52,833

348
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,666
Rin! Pyo! To! Sha!
Kai! Jin! Retsu! Zai! Zen!

349
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,125
There's too many
of them...!

350
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:17,583
Every time we hit
one, another spawns!

351
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,083
We can't stop now!

352
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,041
They're all... turning red.

353
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:32,000
Monk!

354
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:35,750
Tareet sut boreets hara
boreets takimei takimei.

355
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:38,916
Kara san tan uenbi... sowaka!

356
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,083
Oh no!

357
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,791
Now John... Use the vajra...

358
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,375
and destroy the yebisu!

359
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:51,375
Right!

360
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:00,916
John!

361
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,041
Hey wait!

362
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:11,750
Yasu...! Are you okay?

363
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:12,958
Well...

364
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:14,875
At least I'm still alive.

365
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:16,375
Is that all you've got? !

366
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,625
Why don't you just
shut up already?

367
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:28,000
We've all been working our
butts off trying to save you,

368
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,708
and this is the
thanks we get?

369
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:31,166
Why should we
risk our lives?

370
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,833
Just so we can protect
your selfish ego...?

371
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:36,000
Have you totally
lost your mind? !

372
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:37,541
If your pride's so important,

373
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:39,083
then try doing
things yourself

374
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,166
instead of relying on
us all the time...!

375
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,583
Pride means nothing
when other people

376
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:43,750
do everything for you ...

377
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:46,250
Get that through
your head!!

378
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:48,791
Point taken.

379
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:49,750
Come on Monk, let's go.

380
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:52,291
We've done enough already.

381
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:54,208
Sorry to let you down...

382
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,000
but we can't do it.

383
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,875
Hey... What are you doing?

384
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,333
Naru...

385
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:08,625
Don't do it!

386
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,000
Come on Naru...

387
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,083
What's going on?

388
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:31,125
It's like there's all this
air flowing out of Naru.

389
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:33,125
It's so heavy, I feel
like my entire body

390
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,750
is covered in a film
or something.

391
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,916
My ears are
ringing so bad,

392
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,166
I can't even hear anything,

393
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,416
and everything's starting
to look all distorted.

394
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:51,125
Is Naru doing this
all by himself?

395
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:35,166
What was... that?

396
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,250
It's gone...

397
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:40,500
the presence is gone.

398
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:42,625
This is no longer
sacred ground...

399
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:45,083
The other spirits
have moved on as well.

400
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:51,958
Let's go.

401
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:57,416
Hang in there, you guys.
We're almost there.

402
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:13,083
Naru?

403
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:15,666
Naru!

404
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:26,333
No! Stay with us, Naru!

405
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:30,625
Oh no... Is he gonna be okay?

406
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:32,541
Breathe, damn it...! Come on!

407
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:36,000
No... No...

408
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:37,458
you can't die.

409
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:38,791
I'm gonna call
an ambulance!

410
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:44,666
That was Qigong,
wasn't it, Lin...?

411
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,625
After Naru took that
spirit from Eijiro,

412
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:49,541
did you stop him because you
knew this would happen?

413
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:50,833
Yes, I did.

414
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:52,416
I don't understand...

415
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,333
Is Qigong really
that dangerous...?

416
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:56,791
It's supposed to be able to
heal people, right...?

417
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,208
So why did Naru end
up in the hospital?

418
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:01,416
First off, calm down Mai.

419
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,416
The extent of Naru's power
is in a league of its own.

420
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,625
Seriously?

421
00:23:07,416 --> 00:23:09,125
Since childhood...

422
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:11,791
Naru has caused
poltergeists.

423
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:15,083
I taught him how
to use Qigong

424
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:16,458
so he could
control the energy

425
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:18,000
flowing from his body

426
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:18,958
because it was too
much to handle

427
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:21,125
with his conscious
mind alone.

428
00:23:21,208 --> 00:23:23,458
But... the power Naru has

429
00:23:23,541 --> 00:23:25,791
is too much for
one person...

430
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:27,125
The thing is...

431
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:30,250
when he uses his power,
his body can't keep up...

432
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:32,416
and this happens.

433
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,166
It's all my fault...

434
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,875
The only reason he
used his energy

435
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:38,041
is because I provoked him.

436
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,125
It's his fault for allowing
himself to be provoked.

437
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:41,708
But still!

438
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:43,750
Listen Mai, Naru
was well aware of

439
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:45,916
what would happen in
this situation...

440
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,458
If he had been
thinking clearly,

441
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:50,250
he wouldn't have allowed himself
to be provoked like that...

442
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:53,458
Usually he's better at
maintaining his composure.

443
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:55,708
If I were to guess, he
was probably upset about

444
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:58,250
the blunder he
made before...

445
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:00,916
I mean you know how much
pride he has in himself.

446
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:03,500
It's okay...

447
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:05,750
I'm sure he'll recover.

448
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:09,375
He made a mistake and drew a
sword no human can bear...

449
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:12,416
So... he made
two mistakes...

450
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,958
Which means he'll be in
a bad mood for a while.

451
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:16,458
Yeah...

452
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:17,833
He will.

453
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:24,791
A funeral was held for
Kazuyasu and Nao

454
00:24:24,875 --> 00:24:26,500
at the Yoshimi's home.

455
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:27,791
And the bruises
on Hazuki's

456
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:29,875
neck and back disappeared.

457
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:33,625
With that, one of our most
horrific cases was over,

458
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:36,083
claiming two victims.

459
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:38,708
It's amazing they
were the only ones.

460
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,500
Naru!

461
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:53,000
I'm so glad you're
finally awake!

462
00:24:53,083 --> 00:24:55,125
Where are Monk
and Father Brown?

463
00:24:55,208 --> 00:24:57,708
We're right here, Kazuya.

464
00:24:57,791 --> 00:24:59,041
The hospital released
us the other day.

465
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:03,333
I'm sorry guys.

466
00:25:03,416 --> 00:25:04,791
-Huh?
-Huh?

467
00:25:04,875 --> 00:25:08,125
Did Naru just...
...apologize to someone?

468
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:12,250
Well, Lin totally
called this one.

469
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:14,458
Naru was quickly back
to his old self,

470
00:25:14,541 --> 00:25:16,000
grumpy as ever.

471
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:18,041
Way to go on the
quick recovery, kiddo.

472
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:19,708
You're making me
look like an old man.

473
00:25:19,791 --> 00:25:21,166
Well, you know...

474
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:23,333
hey you'll be out of
here next, Kazuya.

475
00:25:23,416 --> 00:25:24,708
If you're going
to keep talking,

476
00:25:24,791 --> 00:25:26,291
please go outside...

477
00:25:26,375 --> 00:25:27,666
As if it's not
totally obvious,

478
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,083
I'm in the middle
of something.

479
00:25:32,041 --> 00:25:33,166
The funny thing is,

480
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:35,875
we wouldn't want to have
Naru any other way.

481
00:25:35,958 --> 00:25:38,041
Self-centered, overly
confident, pushy

482
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:40,125
and, most of all,
narcissistic.

483
00:25:40,208 --> 00:25:41,541
That's how we like him.

484
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:42,791
Mai... Hot tea.

485
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,041
Oh sure.

486
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,791
That would make
a good picture...

487
00:25:52,875 --> 00:25:53,958
Monk...

488
00:25:55,333 --> 00:25:56,625
Ayako...

489
00:25:58,083 --> 00:25:58,958
John...

490
00:26:00,541 --> 00:26:01,666
Masako...

491
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:06,083
and Yasu, all
at Naru's side.

492
00:26:06,166 --> 00:26:07,666
It's been a long time
since I've felt like

493
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,166
I'm in a family...

494
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:11,250
But now I feel like
I really belong.

495
00:26:11,333 --> 00:26:13,041
Why do you always
get to do it?

496
00:26:14,958 --> 00:26:16,208
You're always hogging
the good jobs.

497
00:26:16,291 --> 00:26:17,916
Maybe I'd like to do it!

498
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Sit back down...

499
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:20,458
You heard Naru yourself.

500
00:26:20,541 --> 00:26:22,083
He asked me to do it!

501
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:25,333
Sometimes you just
have to step aside Mai!

502
00:26:25,416 --> 00:26:26,958
Sorry, but
this is my job.

503
00:26:27,041 --> 00:26:28,291
I have to do it myself!

504
00:26:28,375 --> 00:26:29,875
If I could have one wish,

505
00:26:29,958 --> 00:26:31,958
it would be to stay like
this with my friends

506
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:33,208
forever.

507
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:39,708
