1
00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:12,916
I'm not a dog.

2
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:19,666
It's freezing out there!

3
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:22,250
You're late.

4
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:23,375
I need tea.

5
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:24,458
Okay! Sorry

6
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:25,958
but Rokuryo High
School was on the news

7
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:28,416
again this morning and
I wanted to see it.

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,916
They said this time there
was a group of students

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,250
saying they got
bit by a dog

10
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:32,833
right in the
middle of class.

11
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:34,791
Can you believe that?

12
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:36,125
But...

13
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:38,958
The teacher claims he
didn't see anything.

14
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:40,250
Wait a second...

15
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:42,416
Didn't we get a call from
their Principal once?

16
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:45,333
Who's that?

17
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:47,500
Hello?

18
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:48,916
Oh, hi...

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm the student
council president

20
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,708
at Rokuryo High School...

21
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:53,125
The name's Yasu.

22
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:57,708
What's going on...?
I thought that you...

23
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,875
turned them down.

24
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:01,291
Actually that's
why I'm here.

25
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:03,000
I was hoping you would
be willing to reconsider.

26
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:06,250
The situation has
gotten much worse...

27
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:09,041
The student body is getting
more and more scared.

28
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:10,750
To be honest with you...

29
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:12,791
I'm actually quite interested
in the string of events

30
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:15,083
that have surrounded
your school.

31
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:16,875
However I usually
prefer to stay away

32
00:01:16,958 --> 00:01:19,000
from any cases the
media is covering.

33
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:20,833
I can understand that.

34
00:01:20,916 --> 00:01:22,250
There's been over a
dozen reporters

35
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:24,916
outside the school for
the past few days...

36
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,500
That's why we're hoping
this case can be solved

37
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:29,666
as soon as possible so we
can put it all behind us.

38
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,041
Please sir...

39
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:33,083
We need your help.

40
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:39,708
Mai... Call Rokuryo
High School for me.

41
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:42,458
Tell them we'll
take the case.

42
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:43,541
Alright!

43
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:55,583
[Music]

44
00:01:55,666 --> 00:02:05,583
[Music]

45
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:15,583
[Music]

46
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:25,583
[Music]

47
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:35,625
[Music]

48
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:45,625
[Music]

49
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:55,625
[Music]

50
00:02:55,708 --> 00:03:05,625
[Music]

51
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:17,250
[Music]

52
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:24,541
Thanks for coming.

53
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,166
I'll show you to the
Principal's Office.

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,041
Well that was
uncomfortable.

55
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:36,166
In my experience schools don't
like outsiders coming in.

56
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,416
Maybe they're just
suspicious of you, Monk.

57
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,125
Oh get real...

58
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,083
Have you seen Lin?

59
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,375
He's waiting back at
the office to hear

60
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,500
what kind of equipment
we'll need to use ...

61
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:47,208
I guess Ayako's
coming with him ...

62
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:49,000
John and Masako will
be here tomorrow.

63
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,666
Come in.

64
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,625
Excuse me, sir...

65
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:58,500
The people from Shibuya
Psychic Research have arrived.

66
00:03:58,583 --> 00:03:59,958
This is their manager...

67
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,583
Look I don't need
to know their names.

68
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:04,083
Just fix the problem
and do it quickly.

69
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:06,208
Ghosts...? I don't
believe it...

70
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:07,500
It's nonsense...

71
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:09,000
What will the board
of directors say

72
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,916
when they find out I hired
ghost chasers to handle this?

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,541
What is with
this old geezer?

74
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,875
Does he want us
to do this or not?

75
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:18,833
Yasu... Why are
you not in class?

76
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:20,833
I have a shortened
schedule today, sir.

77
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,416
Is that so?

78
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,916
I wouldn't worry...

79
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,125
But... if it's alright I'd
like to keep this brief...

80
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:29,041
I need to help
them get settled...

81
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:31,500
and I'd hate for it to
cut into my studying time.

82
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:34,958
Well... Yasu, you are one
of our best students...

83
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,166
I trust you're on
top of things...

84
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,583
Mister Matsuyama,

85
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,625
would you please show them
to the conference room?

86
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:41,958
Yeah.

87
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:46,333
So... You're the one
running this show...?

88
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:47,625
How old are you?

89
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,333
How rude!

90
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:51,541
This is gonna
be a fun job.

91
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,166
I'm seventeen.

92
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,750
And you're not in school?

93
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:57,458
I'll leave that up
to your imagination.

94
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:58,958
Is that what you
told your parents

95
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:00,958
when you decided to
become a dropout?

96
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,541
I don't know where this
occult garbage comes from...

97
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:07,041
but I do know that young
minds are impressionable

98
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:09,416
and people like you take
full advantage of that...

99
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,500
I'm not afraid to admit
that the idea of you

100
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:14,708
profiting off this scam
makes me sick to my stomach.

101
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:16,666
If it were my choice
I'd throw you out...

102
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,125
Come... In here.

103
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,250
How dare you talk
to him like that!

104
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:25,125
Watch it Mai... You're
wearing a skirt.

105
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,333
This seems decent enough
to set up base ...

106
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:28,750
What's up first?

107
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,208
Let's see...

108
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:32,208
Why don't we start by
rounding up and talking

109
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,166
to all the students that
have been involved?

110
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,208
I can get them for
you, if you'd like.

111
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:38,000
Just make sure you
do it quickly...

112
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:39,625
I have things
to do myself.

113
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,291
Actually you're
free to leave.

114
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:42,458
Thank you for your help.

115
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,041
I'm staying here...

116
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:46,541
It's my job to manage and keep
an eye on the students.

117
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:47,958
Manage?

118
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:50,041
Who does this
guy think he is? !

119
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:51,791
Once they're involved
in a haunting...

120
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:54,250
the victim becomes
a client of mine...

121
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:57,708
And as my client it's imperative
I ensure their privacy.

122
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,791
Since when are children
allowed privacy...?

123
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,916
I can see what's
going on here.

124
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,083
You're trying to
get rid of me

125
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:04,833
because I make you
uncomfortable.

126
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:07,416
A client is a client
regardless of age.

127
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,291
Now please go.

128
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:10,583
I'd like to know what
they were thinking by

129
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:12,750
calling in some kid that
believes in fairy tales

130
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,208
to do a man's job.

131
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:17,208
Okay... Then go and
ask the Prinicpal...

132
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:18,500
What?

133
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:19,791
He's right.

134
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,916
The Principal did hire us.
Talk to him.

135
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:27,541
It's fine by me...

136
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:30,000
Let him be to blame when
you kids destroy the school!!

137
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,583
What the heck...?!
That guy's an idiot...!

138
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:34,833
A real jerk...!

139
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,666
How is he supposed
to manage the students

140
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,625
when he can't even
manage himself...?

141
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:39,916
He may be top
dog around here,

142
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,250
but he needs to
be housebroken...

143
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:43,958
You're making
a scene, Mai.

144
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,500
Aw, don't worry
about it...

145
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:50,083
She's hilarious!

146
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,708
I'm impressed Naru...

147
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:54,250
I was expecting you to unload
on the guy any second...

148
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:57,000
I was definitely
fighting the urge.

149
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,541
There's no use in
lecturing a pig.

150
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:00,625
It's like...

151
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,208
You already know him.

152
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,458
This is for you, Yasu...

153
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:07,583
a list of all the students
that've been involved so far...

154
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:10,125
Once class has ended,
bring them all to this room.

155
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,208
What was that?

156
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,458
What's wrong?

157
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:18,583
Are you alright?

158
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:21,125
It's... a dog!

159
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:26,791
The one we're here for.

160
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:33,625
It's gone!

161
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,208
Everybody, get
back to class!!

162
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:40,541
You okay?

163
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:43,541
Yeah... I'm fine but...

164
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:44,708
she needs help.

165
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,416
We'll take care of you...

166
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,333
Okay?

167
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:51,125
I'll carry her.

168
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,125
Hey, Yasu?

169
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:55,375
Yeah?

170
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:57,666
I need you to group the
students together...

171
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,458
depending on
the incident...

172
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,916
then bring them back to
the conference room here.

173
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,333
Will do.

174
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,083
Geez... He's all work.

175
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,500
Well that was crazy...

176
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,958
Maybe now that he's actually
seen what's happening,

177
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:18,166
that teacher will be a
little more cooperative.

178
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:25,541
It didn't waste any time
getting started, did it?

179
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,500
You've said you're afraid
to come to school

180
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,625
because of ghosts
in the classroom.

181
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,833
Can you tell me why
you feel that way?

182
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:44,041
Yessir... but...

183
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:46,291
It wasn't just a
regular classroom.

184
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:48,333
I was in the language
lab listening to a tape

185
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:50,125
that I had made
the night before.

186
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:52,500
It was for a
homework assignment.

187
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:55,041
As I listened, I could hear
this strange voice...

188
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,208
Why is there
so much static?

189
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,583
Wait, that's not me.

190
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,791
Who is that laughing...?

191
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:10,458
It sounds like a child.

192
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:11,583
Creepy...

193
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,541
Is someone...

194
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:16,791
down there?

195
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,041
I told my
teacher about it

196
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:25,083
but she refused
to believe me...!

197
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:28,916
I swear I'm
telling the truth!

198
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,250
Did anyone else happen
to see this boy?

199
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,458
We've all seen him...

200
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:33,916
It's no secret...

201
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,375
And I know everyone in
class has heard him.

202
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,916
We all told the teacher
how afraid we were...

203
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,458
but she thought we were just
trying to get out of class...

204
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,958
That's when we decided
to stay home from school.

205
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:46,875
So there's a
child's spirit

206
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:49,208
hiding in the language lab.

207
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:51,416
Okay... Are there any
other strange occurrences

208
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,083
that have happened
here at school?

209
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:58,000
Yeah... There's the
unopened locker.

210
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,375
And the anatomy model

211
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,333
that breaks apart
when no one's there.

212
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:03,166
Weird sounds in
the music room.

213
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,375
They say that when you
open the incinerator door,

214
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:07,708
an old man's face
appears upside down.

215
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,500
Oh in the
nurse's office...

216
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,291
On the second
to last bed...

217
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,208
there'll suddenly
be someone in it.

218
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,958
Woah! Slow down!

219
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:17,916
This place is messed up!

220
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,250
I heard someone say
they'd seen Sakauchi.

221
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,375
I heard that too.

222
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,291
They passed him in the
hallway or something.

223
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,750
I heard he was seen
in a classroom.

224
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:31,458
Sakauchi...?
Who is that?

225
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,041
Umm...

226
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,666
He was a freshman
that went here...

227
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,166
He committed suicide.

228
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,083
Suicide?

229
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:41,250
All of this weird stuff
started happening...

230
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,250
sometime last fall...

231
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,208
it was right after...

232
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:48,000
Sakauchi decided to
take his own life.

233
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:50,166
I mean if you look at the
timing of the whole thing

234
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,125
it can't all just
be a coincidence.

235
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,458
And when you think about
the suicide note he left

236
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,041
it's even
more chilling.

237
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,000
What'd it say?

238
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:01,125
Just one sentence...

239
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,875
I'm not a dog.

240
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,916
Do you know what
it could mean?

241
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:12,500
Yeah I think I do
know what it means...

242
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:14,708
Everyone who goes to this
school has thought about it...

243
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,416
I do all the time.

244
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,958
Hey, did either of
you two notice...

245
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,708
how much they
hate school...

246
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,708
Yeah... So what?

247
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:28,541
You tell me...

248
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:30,625
You're the one
in high school.

249
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:31,791
Think about it.

250
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,250
The uniforms,
the hairstyles.

251
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:34,291
It's like none
of these kids

252
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:36,125
are allowed to
express themselves.

253
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:38,000
I mean I haven't
seen one kid here

254
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,125
with their hair bleached.

255
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,041
Have you?

256
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:41,166
Monk...

257
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,041
That like... was out
a long time ago...

258
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,250
Geez Mai, how old
do you think I am?

259
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:47,166
Wanna know?

260
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,250
No I don't!

261
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,208
Oh... fine.

262
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:51,750
The point I'm trying
to make is that,

263
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:53,208
judging from what I've seen,

264
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:56,708
this school seems to have
some very strict rules.

265
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:59,125
Just look at the Principal
and that Matsuyama guy.

266
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:00,666
They act like they're
running a boot camp,

267
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,750
not a high school.

268
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,750
Yeah, you're right.

269
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,375
For a lot of
these kids...

270
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,208
school is where they spend
most of their time...

271
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:10,708
And with so much pressure
from the staff...

272
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,333
the stress has
gotta get to 'em...

273
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,750
I'm not a dog...

274
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:21,958
Hey.

275
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,416
Excuse me.

276
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,708
Yasu...

277
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:27,416
Are you a victim of
this haunting as well?

278
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,958
Yes... I am.

279
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,250
Great...

280
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,500
Could you tell me
everything you remember

281
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:32,833
from the experience?

282
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,083
Well...

283
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,833
It actually started
just this morning

284
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:39,875
when an awful, nauseating smell
came into our classroom.

285
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,833
What's the matter
are you sick...?

286
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:43,833
Well, try to keep it
together until class is over.

287
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:45,750
We've got a lot to cover.

288
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,000
Now pay attention!

289
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,375
Excuse me.

290
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,333
I don't feel good either.

291
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:51,833
Can I go to the nurse?

292
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,000
The nurse?

293
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:58,916
What...

294
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,416
Stop messing around...!

295
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,250
That's enough...!

296
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:03,916
Hey...! Get back here!

297
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,208
Yasu, go get him!

298
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,083
Hey... Yasu...

299
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,875
Get up!

300
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,208
That's horrible.

301
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:17,375
This is starting to
sound more serious

302
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:18,541
than I'd thought.

303
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,291
Now...

304
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,375
Get ready, cause
it's pretty rank.

305
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:28,750
Can you smell it?

306
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,041
Oh man that's nasty!

307
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,583
It smells like a fish

308
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:34,166
that's been left out in the
sun to rot for a couple days.

309
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,416
No it doesn't!

310
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,041
It smells like a tank
full of stinky frogs!

311
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,500
Yeah that's... 'bout it!

312
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:50,416
The odor doesn't seem to be
coming from a certain area.

313
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,791
Exactly...

314
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:54,000
It's as if the air
itself is causing it.

315
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:58,500
Have you been doing
anything here?

316
00:13:58,583 --> 00:13:59,583
Umm...

317
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,875
I'm not sure I
know what you mean.

318
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,833
Séances perhaps?

319
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:05,416
Séances?

320
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,541
He's talking
about orikirisama.

321
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:08,583
No, you dummy...

322
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,333
he is not.

323
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:14,125
Orikirisama?

324
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,666
It's a popular game...

325
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,750
Started a little
over a year ago...

326
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,708
It's called orikirisama.

327
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,708
Oh... I've got one here.

328
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,291
It hasn't even
been used yet.

329
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,333
That's... it?

330
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,083
You two are
Ouija-boarding?

331
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,916
No Ouija-boarding is
used to summon foxes...

332
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
But Orikirisama
summons gods instead...

333
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:44,041
They help you find your
true love and stuff.

334
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:48,416
Cupid... Angel...
Gongen... Hanako...

335
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,500
They're alternate names
for Ouija-boarding...

336
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:51,958
No matter what
name you give them,

337
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:53,416
they're all one in the same.

338
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,791
Playing games with spirits

339
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:57,375
just for the fun of it
is dangerous and wrong.

340
00:14:57,458 --> 00:15:01,333
But... I thought since
orikirisama uses gods it's safe.

341
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:02,958
Well that's where
you're wrong...!

342
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:05,291
Any amateur can
summon a spirit...

343
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,208
but sending one back
takes training...

344
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:08,666
Never do it again!

345
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,958
He said it was popular...

346
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,500
How many use it?

347
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,041
Well uh...

348
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,625
pretty much
everyone at school.

349
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,000
Honestly...

350
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,166
I'd be surprised if
anyone didn't do it.

351
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,083
I'm back...

352
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:23,458
Almost everyone
I talked to

353
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,791
said they've done
it at least once.

354
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:28,458
I spoke to some who do
it multiple times a day.

355
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:30,541
Uh... are you okay with...

356
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,208
doing so much work for us?

357
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:33,458
Yeah, it's fine...

358
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:34,583
Oh man...

359
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,416
This is way worse
than I thought...

360
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,250
The entire student body
is Ouija-boarding...

361
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,625
How many spirits do you think
we're dealing with here?

362
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,083
Quite a few.

363
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:46,083
This school's like a cattle
car crammed to capacity.

364
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:48,916
That's... one way to put it.

365
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,916
Are you prepared for
what's to come Naru?

366
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,750
Using Ouija
boards incorrectly

367
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,958
can dredge up some
really nasty stuff...

368
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:57,083
And I am not looking
forward to it.

369
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,125
I hope you can do
something about it...

370
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,125
Oooh I know...!

371
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,708
I'll teach you how
to drive out spirits

372
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,875
so you can do it...

373
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,500
yeah right... that's it...

374
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:07,000
sound good to you?

375
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:08,291
-Monk!
-Hey...!

376
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,500
Stop it, I'm a pacifist!

377
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,250
Of all the
schools in Japan,

378
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,666
how many do you think
take part in Ouija-boarding?

379
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,250
I would assume not many

380
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:17,833
so I can see how
odd it must seem

381
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:20,083
that so many
practice it here.

382
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:23,250
Just because a group of
kids hold an amateur séance...

383
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,583
doesn't mean a spirit
will be summoned.

384
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,416
Now let's assume that
someone succeeded

385
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,500
in calling on a spirit...

386
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,958
and if that spirit happened
to be a very strong one...

387
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:33,791
I could see it
doing some damage...

388
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,541
be it physical or mental.

389
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,291
But...

390
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,125
I just can't see that
happening on such a wide scale.

391
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,541
I know.

392
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,000
So...

393
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:45,875
can playing with a Ouija
board really summon spirits?

394
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:47,833
Yeah if you're
a spiritualist.

395
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,916
I was able to summon
a ghost once back

396
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,375
when I was in
middle school...

397
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:53,375
A coin moved
all by itself...

398
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,166
and it knew some
of my thoughts...

399
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,958
It sure seemed real to me.

400
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,333
Try this...

401
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:00,458
Hold your finger over the
desk and keep it still

402
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:01,875
Like this?

403
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,791
It's shaking.
Keep it still.

404
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,791
What...? I
thought I was...

405
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:08,416
I swear I'm holding
it as still as I can.

406
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,000
When you have several people
doing that at the same time,

407
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,625
the vibrations of each
finger work together

408
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,375
to move the coin.

409
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,833
Since none of you are
trying to move your finger,

410
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:19,625
the movement of the
coin seems mysterious.

411
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,166
It sounds to me like...

412
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,291
you don't have much faith

413
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,041
in the ancient art
of Ouija-boarding...

414
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:28,958
My basic philosophy is that
spirits only know two things

415
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,791
that living
humans do not.

416
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:33,625
Death and the world
that comes after death.

417
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:35,500
I guess that's true.

418
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,250
Be that as it may...

419
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,041
there are so many spirits
to deal with here;

420
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,083
I honestly don't
know where to start.

421
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:43,416
We may have to wait until
they all come together...

422
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,958
and then throw
whatever we can at them

423
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:47,458
and see what sticks.

424
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:48,916
No hotel?!

425
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:52,291
You mean to tell me
I rode three hours

426
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,166
in the back seat
of Lin's car...

427
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,958
and now I have to
sleep on a cot,

428
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,375
in a room with
a busted heater,

429
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,291
for the entire
investigation?!

430
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,000
Calm down, Ayako.

431
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,625
You probably
won't understand

432
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,583
but this has been
a very long trip...

433
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,125
You should try being
cooped up in a car

434
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:07,791
with Lin for three hours...

435
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,250
A man who seems
to pride himself

436
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:12,000
on not uttering a single
word to his passengers...

437
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,708
It's maddening!

438
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,583
Fine... Okay...

439
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,958
But we're still better
off than the guys are,

440
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:21,166
With Masako only three
of us are sharing a room...

441
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,708
As soon as John
gets here...

442
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:25,666
the four guys will have to
share a room smaller than ours.

443
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,916
Here's where we stand.

444
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,375
There are too many
eyewitness reports

445
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:32,958
and not enough equipment.

446
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,500
When Miss. Hara arrives

447
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:37,166
I'll see if she can confirm
the presence of spirits.

448
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,791
Once we know
they're here...

449
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,583
I'll have John... Takigawa...

450
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:43,125
and Ms. Matsuzaki
ready for exorcisms.

451
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:44,791
Lin and I will
investigate anything

452
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,750
that seems uncertain or vague.

453
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,500
And I'll have Mai
relay information

454
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:49,833
and watch over the base...

455
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:52,291
Just be sure to report to
me if anything happens.

456
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:53,625
Yeah like what?

457
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:56,083
You're the sixth sense
girl, aren't you...?

458
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,541
Wasn't it just
a few cases ago

459
00:18:57,625 --> 00:19:00,041
that you were told you
had latent ESP powers?

460
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:01,375
Oh... That's right...

461
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:02,458
Guess I forgot.

462
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:03,583
Wait...

463
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:05,125
You're clairvoyant
like they are?

464
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:07,291
I thought you were
just normal like me.

465
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:08,916
Well I wouldn't
say I'm normal.

466
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,750
Certainly not...

467
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,458
In our last few cases...

468
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:14,875
you've even been of
some use haven't you?

469
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:18,916
I think criticism should
only be given by those

470
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,291
who've actually
solved a case.

471
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:24,375
You two get along well.

472
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,500
By the way. Don't you
need to get home, Yasu?

473
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,500
It's getting late.

474
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:29,500
No...

475
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:30,916
Actually I was just thinking

476
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,208
I could run errands for you
guys if you wanted me to.

477
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,125
We've got enough people
in this room already.

478
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:38,541
Thanks Yasu...

479
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,666
We're grateful for all the
help you've given us today,

480
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,958
but I think it'd be best if
you didn't stay the night...

481
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,333
It's dangerous.

482
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,708
Of course. Hey if I'm
overstepping my boundaries

483
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,291
please let me know
and I'll leave.

484
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:51,208
On second thought,

485
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,375
maybe you could give
us a hand tonight.

486
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,250
Alright.

487
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:56,583
We set up these mics
around the building

488
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,750
in case we pick up
any weird sounds.

489
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,125
Oh...

490
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:03,291
Do all spiritualists use
such high tech equipment?

491
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:04,958
Some do, but not many...

492
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:07,458
By the way, Naru's
no spiritualist.

493
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:08,875
What?

494
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,875
He would rather refer to
himself as a Ghost Hunter.

495
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:14,375
Oh, I've heard of them!

496
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,041
Sakauchi...

497
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:18,041
you know the kid who
committed suicide...

498
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:20,000
On the career
assessment survey

499
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,958
he filled out before
coming to this school,

500
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:24,708
he put down Ghost Hunter
as his job of choice.

501
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:26,791
At the time I assumed
it was a joke.

502
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:29,208
That's kinda strange...

503
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:32,125
So he was interested
in this sort of thing.

504
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,333
A boy who wanted to
become a Ghost Hunter...

505
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,250
I wonder what he'd think
if he could see us here now.

506
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:43,500
Is something wrong?

507
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:44,916
Oh... nothing.

508
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:50,208
I could have sworn I just
saw somebody standing there.

509
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,500
Hello?!

510
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,666
Alright Chief, where do
we go to set up next...?

511
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:54,833
It's your call.

512
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:57,000
Uhhh... Well...

513
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,583
Let's see.

514
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:01,583
People have been hearing
cats meowing in the gym, right?

515
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:04,208
Whatever, let's just
get this over with.

516
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:06,125
It's kind of creepy being
here at school at night

517
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:07,416
with no one around...

518
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,583
I don't always handle
the scary stuff too well.

519
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:13,500
So why did you call
me Chief back there?

520
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:16,041
Well the way I see it I'm
working for you, right...?

521
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:17,541
But I guess...

522
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,208
I could call you boss.

523
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,416
No... I don't like that either.

524
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,625
Right... Then I'd have to
call Mr. Shibuya Big Boss...

525
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:25,916
I'll think of something.

526
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,791
Knowing him he'd
probably love that!

527
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,708
You totally nailed it!

528
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:36,458
It's amazing that you can be
so relaxed at a time like this.

529
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:39,125
I just seem that way because
you're making me laugh!

530
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,416
Hold on...?

531
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,708
Where am I...?

532
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:51,791
Just a second ago
I was walking around

533
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,583
and setting up
equipment with Yasu.

534
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:57,000
Who's that?

535
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:06,041
That's the school...

536
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:08,666
Wait, that means
I'm on the roof.

537
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:21,041
Are... those souls?

538
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:23,208
Hey.

539
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:25,416
Do you know what all
those little lights are?

540
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,375
Of course I do.

541
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:29,166
That's why it's so fun.

542
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:31,291
It's so fun?

543
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:36,791
So much... fun...

544
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:38,500
There is nothing
in the whole world

545
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:40,291
that feels better than this.

546
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:41,875
It's you.

547
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:43,541
He was a freshman
that went here...

548
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:45,291
Committed suicide.

549
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:47,166
Sakauchi...

550
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,083
you know the kid who
committed suicide...

551
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,958
[Music]

552
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:53,625
Next time on Ghost Hunt,
Forbidden Pastime, Part 2.

553
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:55,000
It's about to get creepy!
