1
00:00:25,223 --> 00:00:27,100
It was Christmas Eve
and John stopped by

2
00:00:27,183 --> 00:00:29,144
with a case from
his local church,

3
00:00:29,227 --> 00:00:31,771
so we decided to
go check it out.

4
00:00:31,855 --> 00:00:34,691
They run a daycare and
orphanage out of the church,

5
00:00:34,774 --> 00:00:36,192
and the children
often become possessed

6
00:00:36,276 --> 00:00:38,319
by the spirit of a boy
who used to live there

7
00:00:38,403 --> 00:00:40,989
and went missing over
thirty years ago.

8
00:00:41,072 --> 00:00:43,074
Whenever a child
becomes possessed,

9
00:00:43,158 --> 00:00:44,951
they play a game
of hide-and-seek,

10
00:00:45,035 --> 00:00:46,494
which they call stick,

11
00:00:46,578 --> 00:00:48,955
because the boy that went
missing couldn't speak,

12
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,665
and would bang a stick on
the ground to signal

13
00:00:50,749 --> 00:00:52,250
when he was ready.

14
00:00:52,334 --> 00:00:54,419
Plus from what Father
Tojo has told us...

15
00:00:54,502 --> 00:00:56,629
Lately Kenji's been appearing
a lot more frequently

16
00:00:56,713 --> 00:00:57,964
than he used to which
could be a sign

17
00:00:58,048 --> 00:01:00,091
that the worst may
be yet to come.

18
00:01:00,175 --> 00:01:03,053
May God have mercy
on your soul

19
00:01:03,136 --> 00:01:05,055
Can you... feel it?

20
00:01:05,138 --> 00:01:06,056
Knocking... sounds.

21
00:01:09,559 --> 00:01:12,228
Mai... What are... you doing?

22
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:17,108
What? No way...!

23
00:01:17,192 --> 00:01:19,069
I think Kenji
just possessed Mai!

24
00:01:21,237 --> 00:01:31,206
[Music]

25
00:01:31,289 --> 00:01:41,216
[Music]

26
00:03:05,884 --> 00:03:07,135
My exorcism on
Thanat worked,

27
00:03:07,218 --> 00:03:08,636
but it looks like...

28
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,472
Uh... We have our work
cut out for us...

29
00:03:10,555 --> 00:03:12,223
that's what it
looks like...

30
00:03:12,307 --> 00:03:14,893
Don't just stand there,
John, do something about it.

31
00:03:14,976 --> 00:03:16,936
Sorry. I didn't
see that coming.

32
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,606
Why don't you keep her
company for awhile, dad?

33
00:03:21,775 --> 00:03:24,152
Thanat, why don't you go play
with the other children, okay?

34
00:03:26,446 --> 00:03:27,489
'Kay.

35
00:03:29,324 --> 00:03:31,201
Let's go somewhere we can
discuss this privately.

36
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:41,252
John, has this
happened before?

37
00:03:41,336 --> 00:03:42,420
Uh, no...

38
00:03:42,504 --> 00:03:44,130
Of all the exorcisms
I've done here

39
00:03:44,214 --> 00:03:46,633
I've never seen him possess
another child so quickly.

40
00:03:46,716 --> 00:03:47,967
And the knocking sounds?

41
00:03:48,051 --> 00:03:49,636
This is the first time.

42
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:51,262
The fact that Kenji's
never done this before

43
00:03:51,346 --> 00:03:53,640
is troubling, to
say the least.

44
00:03:53,723 --> 00:03:55,725
You had said the possessions
were becoming more frequent.

45
00:03:55,809 --> 00:03:57,143
Is that all?

46
00:03:57,227 --> 00:03:58,645
The amount of time the
kids spend hiding

47
00:03:58,728 --> 00:04:00,063
has increased as well...

48
00:04:00,146 --> 00:04:02,232
That's what Father
Tojo told me ...

49
00:04:04,484 --> 00:04:06,736
A few years ago we'd have
one or two possessions a year

50
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,155
but now we get
that many in one week.

51
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:11,032
I'm afraid that if this
continues another child

52
00:04:11,116 --> 00:04:13,827
will turn up missing
just like Kenji.

53
00:04:15,453 --> 00:04:17,706
In the past when I would
remove Kenji from a child,

54
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:18,873
he wouldn't put up
any resistance,

55
00:04:18,957 --> 00:04:20,709
but this time was different.

56
00:04:20,792 --> 00:04:23,253
It was an
unpleasant feeling.

57
00:04:23,336 --> 00:04:24,587
What do you believe
would happen

58
00:04:24,671 --> 00:04:26,423
if you drove him out
again right now?

59
00:04:26,506 --> 00:04:28,341
don't rightly know...

60
00:04:28,425 --> 00:04:30,343
If I were to guess I'd say
he'd attempt to possess

61
00:04:30,427 --> 00:04:32,429
another nearby child.

62
00:04:32,512 --> 00:04:34,723
But I'm certain Kenji
would become even angrier

63
00:04:34,806 --> 00:04:36,558
than he already is.

64
00:04:36,641 --> 00:04:38,852
I agree.

65
00:04:38,935 --> 00:04:40,603
I can't take
this any longer!

66
00:04:46,401 --> 00:04:47,986
Keep it together
Takigawa.

67
00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:49,487
You're a professional...

68
00:04:49,571 --> 00:04:50,572
and this is serious.

69
00:04:52,323 --> 00:04:54,367
Let's see if we can find
Kenji before it's too late.

70
00:04:57,287 --> 00:04:58,329
This is it...

71
00:04:58,413 --> 00:04:59,789
They apparently found
Kenji's whistle

72
00:04:59,873 --> 00:05:00,999
against that far wall.

73
00:05:03,626 --> 00:05:05,879
Looks like this is where
the old trash incinerator was.

74
00:05:08,423 --> 00:05:09,716
Oh I see.

75
00:05:09,799 --> 00:05:11,092
The aqueduct is
right behind it.

76
00:05:12,802 --> 00:05:15,430
Looks pretty deep.

77
00:05:15,513 --> 00:05:17,599
Father Tojo said Kenji
was playing hide-and-seek

78
00:05:17,682 --> 00:05:19,351
before he
disappeared, right?

79
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:27,567
-Takigawa!
-What is it?

80
00:05:31,696 --> 00:05:33,490
So there's a place
to stand here.

81
00:05:33,573 --> 00:05:35,658
Yep... I can see why
he'd choose this spot

82
00:05:35,742 --> 00:05:38,536
cause not many kids would
think to look over here.

83
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,997
But a child his age couldn't
scale a wall this high.

84
00:05:42,415 --> 00:05:44,209
That's true but at the
time this entire area

85
00:05:44,292 --> 00:05:46,169
was under construction.

86
00:05:46,252 --> 00:05:47,754
He could have easily
climbed on some scaffolding

87
00:05:47,837 --> 00:05:49,506
or lumber to get
over the wall.

88
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:52,300
It surely would have
made it easier for him.

89
00:05:55,512 --> 00:05:58,223
So he starts out by
jumping on some lumber

90
00:05:58,306 --> 00:05:59,891
and then as he's
climbing over the wall,

91
00:05:59,974 --> 00:06:02,268
his whistle gets caught and
falls to the ground...

92
00:06:02,352 --> 00:06:04,104
After he's made it over,

93
00:06:04,187 --> 00:06:07,315
he accidentally falls
in the aqueduct.

94
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:09,776
Water was cold that
time of year...

95
00:06:09,859 --> 00:06:12,570
Poor kid never
had a chance.

96
00:06:12,654 --> 00:06:14,614
That sound about
right to you?

97
00:06:14,698 --> 00:06:17,450
There's no way of knowing but
it is worth considering...

98
00:06:17,534 --> 00:06:19,661
I am going to see if I can
make any more progress

99
00:06:19,744 --> 00:06:21,246
on finding Kenji.

100
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,458
Lin, continue
babysitting Mai.

101
00:06:25,542 --> 00:06:27,043
Keep her busy.

102
00:06:27,127 --> 00:06:28,503
Naru!

103
00:06:28,586 --> 00:06:30,672
John, Monk,
stay with them.

104
00:06:33,967 --> 00:06:35,218
Uh... Hey there!

105
00:06:38,471 --> 00:06:40,682
What should we play,
Kenji...?

106
00:06:40,765 --> 00:06:43,810
Don't worry. It's okay, your
dad can play with us too.

107
00:06:43,893 --> 00:06:45,103
Would you stop it?

108
00:06:48,773 --> 00:06:50,775
I know it sucks but as long
as he's clinging to you

109
00:06:50,859 --> 00:06:52,944
he won't go off
hiding in the woods...

110
00:06:53,028 --> 00:06:55,196
Now, let's have some fun.

111
00:07:10,712 --> 00:07:12,714
Oh, girls, you
shouldn't have...

112
00:07:12,797 --> 00:07:14,591
It's like a
bakery in here.

113
00:07:14,674 --> 00:07:16,009
It smells delicious.

114
00:07:16,092 --> 00:07:17,052
Thanks John.

115
00:07:17,135 --> 00:07:18,386
They'll be handing
these out tonight

116
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,180
to everyone who comes to
midnight mass tonight.

117
00:07:20,263 --> 00:07:21,598
That's nice...

118
00:07:21,681 --> 00:07:24,059
I'll get my hands dirty
if you need some help.

119
00:07:28,313 --> 00:07:30,523
I'll bet our father-son
team here is game too...

120
00:07:30,607 --> 00:07:31,816
Right?

121
00:07:37,197 --> 00:07:39,282
Now All that's left is to
cover the cakes with foil

122
00:07:39,366 --> 00:07:40,784
and gift wrap them.

123
00:07:40,867 --> 00:07:41,993
You want to help
us with that?

124
00:07:46,706 --> 00:07:48,083
Wait, you're not
doing it right.

125
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,710
Oh... how should I
do it then?

126
00:07:50,794 --> 00:07:53,046
Do it the way I am
you silly goose!

127
00:07:55,298 --> 00:07:57,759
There. Now you match
the cake wrappings.

128
00:08:07,394 --> 00:08:09,229
You want me to
do it again?

129
00:08:16,277 --> 00:08:18,279
Kenji was such a
sweet-hearted child,

130
00:08:18,363 --> 00:08:20,407
and so patient waiting
for his dad.

131
00:08:28,373 --> 00:08:30,083
He would often stand at
the gates of the church,

132
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:31,793
which was the place
he said goodbye

133
00:08:31,876 --> 00:08:33,294
to his father for
the last time.

134
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,512
And now that he thinks
he's with his dad again,

135
00:08:42,595 --> 00:08:45,140
he literally can't take
his eyes off of him.

136
00:08:45,223 --> 00:08:46,975
imagine the joy he
must feel reuniting

137
00:08:47,058 --> 00:08:48,935
with his dad on
Christmas Eve.

138
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:51,187
You can't blame him
for being so happy.

139
00:08:52,772 --> 00:08:55,275
All done!

140
00:08:55,358 --> 00:08:57,694
After we get everything
put away, it's play time.

141
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,073
I know it's a
little bizarre

142
00:09:02,157 --> 00:09:04,075
but it's kinda heartwarming
seeing them together.

143
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:06,453
Yeah... but it is
still pretty weird.

144
00:09:06,536 --> 00:09:08,163
You have to admit it's
cute seeing Mai

145
00:09:08,246 --> 00:09:10,040
act half her age.

146
00:09:10,123 --> 00:09:11,624
Now if only Lin
were more into it.

147
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,626
Enough already!

148
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,964
Hey Lin. What's the matter?

149
00:09:18,048 --> 00:09:21,593
why should I have to put up
with this charade any longer.

150
00:09:21,676 --> 00:09:23,094
Get off of me!

151
00:09:25,013 --> 00:09:26,389
Take it easy, Lin.

152
00:09:26,473 --> 00:09:29,559
You need to understand that
I am not your father...

153
00:09:29,642 --> 00:09:32,479
It's all a big mistake and I
want you to leave me alone.

154
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:36,775
Mai, wait!

155
00:09:36,858 --> 00:09:38,818
Uhh, I mean Kenji!

156
00:09:47,452 --> 00:09:48,536
What's wrong?

157
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,080
Mai ran off.

158
00:09:59,005 --> 00:10:00,590
That sounds like Kenji
using his sticks.

159
00:10:02,425 --> 00:10:04,219
I think you
made him angry.

160
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:36,126
Daddy... are you
leaving me again?

161
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:43,049
I'll be back for you
as soon as I can,.

162
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:45,176
Now be a good boy and do
what the father tells you to,

163
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,594
okay?

164
00:10:46,678 --> 00:10:48,179
When will you come back...?

165
00:10:48,263 --> 00:10:51,558
Tomorrow...? The next day?

166
00:10:51,641 --> 00:10:52,851
I promise that
we'll be spending

167
00:10:52,934 --> 00:10:55,478
next Christmas together...

168
00:10:55,562 --> 00:10:57,105
Goodbye son.

169
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,656
I'll be a good boy...

170
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,283
I promise...

171
00:11:08,366 --> 00:11:10,493
Please come back soon...

172
00:11:10,577 --> 00:11:12,120
Daddy.

173
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:20,337
The sound, it
just stopped.

174
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,881
So Monk, why did you
allow Mai to run away?

175
00:11:22,964 --> 00:11:25,300
Well Lin just snapped at
her then Mai got offended

176
00:11:25,383 --> 00:11:26,885
and ran out.

177
00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:32,015
That's very
disappointing.

178
00:11:32,098 --> 00:11:34,351
Let's focus on where Mai
could be hiding from us.

179
00:11:35,518 --> 00:11:36,353
Wait...

180
00:11:36,436 --> 00:11:37,729
I know!

181
00:11:42,609 --> 00:11:44,152
Hey Mai!

182
00:11:44,235 --> 00:11:45,695
-Anything?
-Nothing...

183
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:47,739
And there's no signs
she fell in the water.

184
00:11:49,366 --> 00:11:51,242
If we're to go off of
what he's done in the past,

185
00:11:51,326 --> 00:11:53,119
he'll leave Mai on his
own accord anytime now.

186
00:11:54,788 --> 00:11:57,457
John drove Kenji out of
Thanat just a few hours ago...

187
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:00,627
and then Kenji quickly
possessed Mai who was nearby...

188
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:03,421
Apparently it was the
first time he had done that.

189
00:12:03,505 --> 00:12:05,048
Then...

190
00:12:05,131 --> 00:12:08,551
And this was also the first time
knocking sounds were involved

191
00:12:08,635 --> 00:12:11,680
You said you felt an unusual
resistance from Kenji

192
00:12:11,763 --> 00:12:13,515
when you drove him
out of Thanat.

193
00:12:13,598 --> 00:12:15,016
He must have been quite
reluctant to leave

194
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,227
his father's side with
that reaction.

195
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:19,104
That could be the case...

196
00:12:19,187 --> 00:12:20,397
The reaction and the
knocking sounds

197
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,941
were definitely more
intense this time around.

198
00:12:23,024 --> 00:12:24,859
You also said the
frequency of Kenji's

199
00:12:24,943 --> 00:12:27,237
appearances have
increased lately.

200
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,406
Up to this point he's
willfully removed himself

201
00:12:29,489 --> 00:12:31,241
from any children
he's possessed,

202
00:12:31,324 --> 00:12:33,326
however this time that
may not be the case...

203
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:34,828
That's the reason
why I asked you

204
00:12:34,911 --> 00:12:37,622
to keep Mai company.

205
00:12:37,706 --> 00:12:39,165
Yeah but...

206
00:12:39,249 --> 00:12:40,333
let's be fair.

207
00:12:40,417 --> 00:12:41,918
Lin was never made
aware of that.

208
00:12:42,002 --> 00:12:44,379
So... what do we do now?

209
00:12:44,462 --> 00:12:45,714
Do we know what happened
to Kenji's father

210
00:12:45,797 --> 00:12:47,882
or did he just disappear?

211
00:12:47,966 --> 00:12:50,051
Well practically, All I
ever heard was that

212
00:12:50,135 --> 00:12:51,636
after he left Kenji here
he started working

213
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,805
a job over in Osaka.

214
00:12:53,888 --> 00:12:55,932
he was never heard
from again...

215
00:12:56,016 --> 00:12:57,434
a few weeks after
Kenji disappeared

216
00:12:57,517 --> 00:12:58,852
Father Tojo received a letter

217
00:12:58,935 --> 00:13:00,562
stating he had
passed away,

218
00:13:00,645 --> 00:13:02,564
but it never explained
how he died.

219
00:13:03,606 --> 00:13:05,358
So why does Kenji do it?

220
00:13:05,442 --> 00:13:06,693
What?

221
00:13:08,361 --> 00:13:09,738
He hides, and then
signals to the others,

222
00:13:09,821 --> 00:13:11,406
asking to be found.

223
00:13:13,825 --> 00:13:15,702
He eventually comes out
without being found,

224
00:13:15,785 --> 00:13:17,829
so disappearing isn't
his objective...

225
00:13:17,912 --> 00:13:19,831
Now it could be, as
Father Tojo believes,

226
00:13:19,914 --> 00:13:21,666
that he just wants
to be noticed.

227
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,793
But Why Kenji...?

228
00:13:23,877 --> 00:13:26,588
Why do you continue
to play the game?

229
00:13:29,049 --> 00:13:30,342
Because he wants
to go back?

230
00:13:30,425 --> 00:13:32,552
Go back...?
Back to where?

231
00:13:32,635 --> 00:13:34,304
Back To the church.

232
00:13:34,387 --> 00:13:35,805
Oh I see.

233
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:37,015
He thinks if he can get
back to the church

234
00:13:37,098 --> 00:13:39,100
then his father
will come get him

235
00:13:39,184 --> 00:13:41,686
And the two of them
will go home...

236
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:44,105
Way to go, dad.

237
00:13:44,939 --> 00:13:46,316
That's it.

238
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,943
Kenji's spirit is lost so
he's forced to possess

239
00:13:49,027 --> 00:13:51,154
the children and play
hide-and-seek.

240
00:13:51,237 --> 00:13:52,322
The only reason he
does this is because

241
00:13:52,405 --> 00:13:54,324
it's his only chance
of being found.

242
00:13:54,407 --> 00:13:56,576
He's trying to
end the game.

243
00:13:56,659 --> 00:13:57,619
All right...

244
00:13:57,702 --> 00:13:58,661
Then let's quit
talking about it

245
00:13:58,745 --> 00:13:59,996
and go find him...

246
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,123
Because the longer we wait
the more worried I get

247
00:14:02,207 --> 00:14:04,250
about Mai's well
being in all this.

248
00:14:04,334 --> 00:14:05,877
I mean it's December and
she's not even wearing

249
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,004
a coat for crying out loud.

250
00:14:08,088 --> 00:14:10,173
It'll take more than the
just the three of us...

251
00:14:10,256 --> 00:14:11,591
I looked everywhere
for a good hour

252
00:14:11,675 --> 00:14:13,009
and came up empty...

253
00:14:13,093 --> 00:14:15,136
Why don't we enlist
the children to help?

254
00:14:16,304 --> 00:14:18,014
And how is that
gonna help us?

255
00:14:18,098 --> 00:14:20,183
The kids weren't able to
find him thirty years ago.

256
00:14:20,266 --> 00:14:22,143
Which is exactly why
we'll be following

257
00:14:22,227 --> 00:14:24,229
the children as they
look for him.

258
00:14:24,312 --> 00:14:25,522
And then we'll explore
the places the children

259
00:14:25,605 --> 00:14:27,899
haven't thought
to look, right?

260
00:14:27,982 --> 00:14:29,484
Now that is brilliant.

261
00:14:29,567 --> 00:14:31,027
Why didn't I
think of that?

262
00:14:31,111 --> 00:14:32,278
Let's hurry.

263
00:14:36,032 --> 00:14:37,367
Time to play a
little game...

264
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:39,744
When I say go I want you
to find our friend Mai,

265
00:14:39,828 --> 00:14:41,204
who's hiding
somewhere... 'kay?

266
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,915
Sound like fun?

267
00:14:43,998 --> 00:14:45,458
Yeah!

268
00:14:45,542 --> 00:14:46,501
Great...

269
00:14:46,584 --> 00:14:48,169
Ready... Go!

270
00:15:08,273 --> 00:15:10,108
Easy...

271
00:15:10,191 --> 00:15:13,028
It's hide and seek
not... wrestling!

272
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:24,914
Man these kids are
either sweethearts

273
00:15:24,998 --> 00:15:26,916
or completely out
of control...

274
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,460
You okay, John?

275
00:15:28,543 --> 00:15:29,836
Yeah...

276
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:31,129
I think they
just get excited

277
00:15:31,212 --> 00:15:33,048
when new people
come to visit.

278
00:15:33,131 --> 00:15:34,090
And though they
may seem happy,

279
00:15:34,174 --> 00:15:35,425
I think many of them are lonely

280
00:15:35,508 --> 00:15:37,844
since they haven't seen
their parents in so long.

281
00:15:37,927 --> 00:15:40,430
I suppose you're right.

282
00:15:40,513 --> 00:15:42,724
Hold on. What are
you getting at?

283
00:15:42,807 --> 00:15:44,059
Are some of these kids
gonna start thinking

284
00:15:44,142 --> 00:15:46,102
that I'm their dad?

285
00:15:46,186 --> 00:15:48,063
Don't worry
we're working...

286
00:15:48,146 --> 00:15:49,230
Honestly!

287
00:15:52,233 --> 00:15:54,110
Nice try kid,
but too obvious.

288
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,490
Of course.

289
00:16:00,909 --> 00:16:02,202
So...

290
00:16:02,285 --> 00:16:03,661
If you watch closely
you'll notice

291
00:16:03,745 --> 00:16:05,288
that the kids only
look in the places

292
00:16:05,372 --> 00:16:07,332
that are easily
accessible to them.

293
00:16:15,924 --> 00:16:17,384
Hey John...

294
00:16:17,467 --> 00:16:18,885
do ya notice...?

295
00:16:18,968 --> 00:16:20,220
none of them are
looking up

296
00:16:26,059 --> 00:16:27,936
Since they're all so small,
they're not considering

297
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:31,690
anywhere above them to be
a possible hiding place.

298
00:16:31,773 --> 00:16:33,733
And neither are we...

299
00:16:33,817 --> 00:16:35,360
Mai could have
climbed anywhere.

300
00:16:35,443 --> 00:16:36,695
What I'm really more
concerned about

301
00:16:36,778 --> 00:16:38,655
is outside the church.

302
00:16:45,578 --> 00:16:47,455
Man, she could be
anywhere out here.

303
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:49,958
I'm willing to bet
she climbed up a tree.

304
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:52,627
I'm gonna go over here and check
this side of the church.

305
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:55,046
Right. I'll
check this side.

306
00:16:56,589 --> 00:16:58,049
What...?You found
her already? !

307
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:07,684
We've been
looking for you.

308
00:17:17,402 --> 00:17:18,778
It's okay.

309
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:31,082
Poor thing...

310
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:32,500
You must have been
freezing your tail off

311
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:34,419
being up in that
tree for so long.

312
00:17:42,635 --> 00:17:44,387
You found him!

313
00:17:49,434 --> 00:17:51,186
Ahh...

314
00:17:52,979 --> 00:17:55,065
I swear, what does Lin
have that I don't...?

315
00:17:55,148 --> 00:17:56,941
I mean I'm a nice
guy, right?

316
00:17:59,027 --> 00:18:00,195
Hello Kenji...

317
00:18:00,278 --> 00:18:02,655
That man is
not your dad...

318
00:18:02,739 --> 00:18:04,741
Your real dad is
waiting in heaven

319
00:18:04,824 --> 00:18:07,744
and he wants you
to be with him.

320
00:18:07,827 --> 00:18:11,623
You don't have to play
hide-and-seek ever again.

321
00:18:11,706 --> 00:18:13,667
Kenji...

322
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,460
where are you hiding?

323
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:32,185
-He's right there.
-Huh?

324
00:18:40,193 --> 00:18:41,611
My god.

325
00:18:41,695 --> 00:18:42,987
No way.

326
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,989
How did he get up there?

327
00:19:15,729 --> 00:19:17,897
Thank you sir.

328
00:19:28,283 --> 00:19:29,409
Any sign of him?

329
00:19:29,492 --> 00:19:31,536
It doesn't look
like he's here.

330
00:19:31,619 --> 00:19:33,079
Let's spread out
and keep looking.

331
00:19:40,128 --> 00:19:42,297
What should I do...?

332
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:45,258
Father Tojo and the others
are about to leave...

333
00:19:45,342 --> 00:19:47,135
I'm right here.

334
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,732
I'm so cold...

335
00:20:03,777 --> 00:20:05,195
Daddy...

336
00:20:05,278 --> 00:20:07,739
please come get me soon.

337
00:20:07,822 --> 00:20:10,700
I miss you so much daddy.

338
00:20:29,511 --> 00:20:31,262
Daddy!

339
00:20:53,535 --> 00:20:55,495
Oh, hey there.

340
00:21:01,334 --> 00:21:03,253
Well, I guess...

341
00:21:03,336 --> 00:21:05,171
Kenji made it just in
time for Christmas...

342
00:21:49,424 --> 00:21:52,510
Well... What do you say
we throw that party now?

343
00:21:52,594 --> 00:21:53,219
I'm in...

344
00:21:53,303 --> 00:21:54,846
now who wants cake?

345
00:21:54,929 --> 00:21:56,181
All right!

346
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:01,644
A party sounds nice.

347
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:42,060
[Music]

348
00:24:06,936 --> 00:24:10,231
Next time on Ghost Hunt,
part one of Forbidden Pastime!

349
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:12,067
Ohhh. I wonder what that is.
