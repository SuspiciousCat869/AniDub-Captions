1
00:00:11,375 --> 00:00:12,333
What do you mean?

2
00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:14,541
How can an exorcism
be impossible?

3
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:16,375
Urado isn't here
because of an obsession

4
00:00:16,458 --> 00:00:17,791
with satisfying
a grudge...

5
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:21,916
He just wants to
extend his life.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,666
I have no idea how he
brings people through walls,

7
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,125
but I do know that he hunts
because he's in search of prey.

8
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:32,000
Calling him a ghost is
no longer accurate...

9
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:36,041
Imp... Demon. Devil...

10
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:37,500
He's turned
into a monster.

11
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:39,250
But Naru...

12
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:41,208
I know how to hunt ghosts,

13
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,833
but monsters lie in
a different realm

14
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:43,791
in which I'm not skilled.

15
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:48,291
That's why an exorcism
is off the table.

16
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:49,958
Unless someone here
knows a surefire way

17
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:51,583
to hunt a
monster safely.

18
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:56,458
But what about
Suzuki and Atsugi?

19
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:58,875
Are we just gonna completely
give up hope for them?

20
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:01,000
They're dead.
There is no hope.

21
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:05,000
Well...

22
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:07,125
He does have
one weakness.

23
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:10,958
Urado is trapped
inside the house.

24
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:13,500
Trapped inside the very
scene of his crimes...

25
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:16,166
He is completely
incapable of escaping.

26
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,208
Now that you mention it,
didn't Madoka say

27
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:20,666
the area outside the
house is totally safe?

28
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,666
If we were to call the police
and have the house dismantled,

29
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,375
they could locate
the missing persons...

30
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:28,958
Unfortunately
that's not our job.

31
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:40,375
[Music]

32
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:50,375
[Music]

33
00:01:50,458 --> 00:02:00,416
[Music]

34
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:06,958
[Music]

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,333
What's up? It's not like you to
run away from a case like this.

36
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,125
I'm not running Mai...

37
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:13,583
We were hired to come
here and hunt a ghost,

38
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:15,000
not a monster.

39
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,833
You're turning your
back on a threat.

40
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:18,041
Is that not
running away?

41
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:19,333
No it's not...

42
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:22,625
Now I haven't disclosed
this yet... Listen...

43
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,541
There's a rumor floating
through the grapevine

44
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,250
that the Minami Psychic
Research Council

45
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,833
is peddling
around an imposter

46
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,125
who claims to be the
great Oliver Davis...

47
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:33,625
Would you be a dear and
look into it for me, please.

48
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:36,958
That was the actual reason
Madoka hired us to come here.

49
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:39,666
And if you take that into
consideration, our job is done.

50
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:44,000
There's no reason to risk danger
to ourselves any longer...

51
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:46,125
We're pulling out.

52
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:48,666
You lied to us, Naru!

53
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,541
It's what you would classify
a strategic secret...

54
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,333
something I had to
do because some of us

55
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,125
can't keep things
to themselves.

56
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:56,916
Oh, who, me?

57
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,750
Well I'm sorry but,
unlike you,

58
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:01,041
I prefer not to
deceive people!

59
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:03,041
And since we're
being so open...

60
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:06,708
I'm sorry ma'am, but our
manager is an imposter as well.

61
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:07,833
He's the real boss.

62
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,083
Enough.

63
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,833
We need to start
breaking down HQ.

64
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:15,000
Okay... Mister Manager.

65
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:22,708
I'm not sure
about this...

66
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:24,833
I think leaving's
a bad idea...

67
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:26,291
What do you
think Masako?

68
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:30,708
What's wrong?

69
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:32,000
Nothing.

70
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:34,750
I just prefer that
someone like you

71
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,708
not call me by
my first name.

72
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,166
What the heck...?

73
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,875
What do mean by saying
"someone like me?"...

74
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,708
Why do you hate
me so much?

75
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:45,791
Are you there?

76
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,833
Why?

77
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:51,125
Why are you the only girl Naru
calls by your first name?

78
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:53,833
Huh?

79
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,708
He always calls me
and Miss Matsuzaki

80
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:58,083
by our last names but
for some strange reason

81
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,833
he gives you
special treatment.

82
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:01,916
You really
believe that?

83
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,458
I saw you two
fighting earlier.

84
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:05,708
It was like you were
married or something.

85
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:08,500
Hold on, am I detecting
a hint of jealousy?

86
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:10,541
Please, I'm not
jealous of you.

87
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:14,041
That is so adorable!

88
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:15,833
Seriously, there's
absolutely nothing

89
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,708
for you to be jealous of.

90
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,625
Every day Naru finds a
new way to make me sound

91
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:22,166
like a complete idiot...

92
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,083
And to be perfectly
honest, if there's anyone

93
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,125
he gives special
treatment to it's you.

94
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:27,250
You think so?

95
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:28,416
Yup...

96
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,250
You've got some dirt
on Naru, don't you?

97
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,291
Yes, I do...

98
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,583
but I really
wish I didn't.

99
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:36,500
What do you mean?

100
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:41,208
Well, we all know Naru has
a great deal of pride...

101
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:42,916
So even the thought
of someone having

102
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,750
the upper hand on
him upsets him...

103
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:48,291
And that's why
I believe...

104
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,458
Naru doesn't like me.

105
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,541
Even if that's the case,
I don't see any reason

106
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:55,625
why you should think
he doesn't like you.

107
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:56,666
Hey wait...

108
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,875
You're leaving...?

109
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,541
You can't be
by yourself...

110
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:00,583
I'll come too.

111
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:02,250
That's not necessary...

112
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,625
I need to take a few
moments for myself,

113
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:05,666
that's all...

114
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,041
I'll be right back...

115
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:09,041
I'll just be in
the hallway here.

116
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:09,958
You sure?

117
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:12,125
Yes...

118
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:14,083
I don't want to
be around you.

119
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:19,916
Oookay... So she
doesn't like me.

120
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,250
I get special
treatment...?

121
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:27,291
That's the last thing I
ever expected to hear.

122
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:30,208
Naru always calls you
by your first name.

123
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:31,458
Behind the celebrity,

124
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,458
I guess she's just...
an ordinary girl.

125
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:37,458
Well, now
that's better.

126
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,083
Sure took you
long enough...

127
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,833
You'd better hurry
up and start packing.

128
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:42,041
Yeah, I know...

129
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,416
Hey, where's Masako?

130
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,875
In... the hallway.

131
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,666
Everyone who's
disappeared

132
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,208
has been younger.

133
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:52,291
Make sure you're never
alone while in this house.

134
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,416
Mai?

135
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,708
Masako!

136
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,666
But she was
right here.

137
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:09,375
Oh no.

138
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,666
How could you allow her to
leave the room by herself?

139
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,375
I'm so sorry.

140
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,250
So what are you
two doing here?

141
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:21,750
We got your message at the
hotel about striking camp,

142
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:23,916
so we wanted to come
by and help you out.

143
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,583
We had no idea the
situation was this dire.

144
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:29,000
In any case, we need to
search that hidden area.

145
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,916
-I'm in.
-Me too.

146
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:33,750
Hey Naru...
Where're you going?

147
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,041
You go ahead without me.

148
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,958
I want to check Miss
Hara's bags for clues.

149
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,458
It didn't take
us long to realize

150
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:47,333
Masako wasn't in
the hidden space.

151
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:48,375
This isn't good.

152
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,166
We've already
wasted half the day.

153
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,875
Is that last floor
all that's left?

154
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,166
It is.

155
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,875
This one, right?

156
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:57,958
Okay, let's find a place where
the walls are the thinnest.

157
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:03,250
I should have tried harder
to stop her from leaving.

158
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:07,958
What am I gonna do...?

159
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,708
If anything
happened to her...

160
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:14,458
Hey if you're tired you should
consider taking a quick nap.

161
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:15,958
But...

162
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:19,000
Who knows, you may even have
one of your visions again...

163
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,500
Maybe it could help
us find Masako.

164
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:22,583
Maybe so.

165
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:23,541
Go ahead.

166
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:27,541
Well... I'll take a nap...
I guess.

167
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,041
It's the same dream
I always have.

168
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,583
There are so
many spirits...!

169
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:48,375
Are they the souls of all the
people who were killed here?

170
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:56,875
Naru...!

171
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:59,833
Okay, get a hold
of yourself Mai.

172
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:02,791
Naru...have you seen
Masako around here?

173
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,958
Is she...okay?

174
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:14,458
Naru!

175
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,291
I've seen that
door before.

176
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,166
This room...

177
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,000
This is where they
took me in that dream.

178
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,208
Masako!

179
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,125
You okay?

180
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,083
-Mai.
-Thank goodness...

181
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:50,208
You're safe...

182
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,416
Are you hurt?

183
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,791
Naru was just here...

184
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:57,583
He was right there,
comforting me.

185
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,000
You should have
seen him smiling.

186
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,750
He was so handsome.

187
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:07,041
It's gonna be okay.

188
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:08,833
Isn't that strange?

189
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:12,125
Not at all.

190
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,916
What's wrong?

191
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,541
This is all a bad
dream, right...?

192
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,791
I just went through the
most frightening experience

193
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,583
of my entire life...

194
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:30,125
I couldn't figure out
if I was alive or dead.

195
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:32,291
You're still
alive, Masako...

196
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,041
You've got to
believe me!

197
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,125
Here... take this.

198
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,500
What is it?

199
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:42,875
It's the key to the
house I used to live in

200
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,875
when I was
really young...

201
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,875
After my dad
passed away,

202
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,958
my mom would use it as
her good luck charm...

203
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,250
and now I use it as my own.

204
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,250
It's a lot easier to
believe in something

205
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,875
when you're holding onto
a piece of reality...

206
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:59,541
You are very much alive, Masako,
and you're not dreaming...

207
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,208
Can you feel
the key?

208
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:04,083
You wouldn't be able
to if this weren't real.

209
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,916
I want you to wait
here and believe...

210
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
We'll come get you.

211
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,041
Hurry back... Please Mai.

212
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,666
Please Mai.

213
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,208
-Ayako!
-Hmm?

214
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:23,333
I had one of my dreams.
Masako was in it.

215
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,708
What?

216
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,375
She was alive...

217
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:28,291
She was safe.

218
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:29,708
Really.

219
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:31,208
Yeah...

220
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,875
And I made her
a promise...

221
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,041
that we would
save her.

222
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,916
We cannot
let her down!

223
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,083
Hang in there,
Masako...

224
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:58,416
We're coming
to get you.

225
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:10,125
See how the stairs
run into the ceiling?

226
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,208
I think that's the
first floor above it.

227
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,166
I'm beginning to think that
this was the main building

228
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,541
Kaneyuki
had lived in.

229
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,208
Does this look like what
you saw in your dream?

230
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,541
Mm hmm... The room
had a fireplace.

231
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,708
And there was some kind of
closet on the right side.

232
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:28,791
There. It looks
exactly the same...

233
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:30,958
And there should be a
corridor inside that closet.

234
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,666
If this really is
the same as my dream,

235
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,750
the hedge maze should
be just up ahead.

236
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,166
I'm guessing this
was the maze.

237
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:05,375
Exactly the
same again.

238
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:06,333
Which means...

239
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,500
There's another door.

240
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:12,000
It makes sense now...
the floor...

241
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,000
was elevated in
the center area...

242
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,500
to keep this
place covered up.

243
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:24,291
She's up there...

244
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,166
-No Mai!
-Mai, Wait!

245
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:43,750
Masako.

246
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,083
Owww.

247
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,541
Mai?

248
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:52,500
Masako!

249
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,250
Ahh...

250
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:56,416
Are you okay?!

251
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,041
Yeah.

252
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:00,791
You came here...
to rescue me.

253
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,333
Alright time to
get outta here.

254
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,291
-Mai.
-What?

255
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:09,916
Blood.

256
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,500
Is that what I
slipped in earlier?

257
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:23,166
Oh my god, look at
how much there is!

258
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,500
I don't want to die.

259
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,166
Could all this blood
be from those people

260
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,000
that went missing?

261
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,166
I don't want to die.

262
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:58,791
We need to run.

263
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:03,791
Naumaku san manda
bazaradan kan.

264
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:06,208
Naumaku san manda
bazaradan kan...

265
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:08,791
Naumaku san manda
bazaradan kan.

266
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,958
Rin! pyo! to! sha!

267
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:12,833
kai! jin! retsu!
zai! zen...!

268
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:16,958
I don't want to die...!

269
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:21,958
Now...!
Let's run!

270
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:29,958
They're coming
through the wall!

271
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,583
His assistants!

272
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,458
Is this the same way
everyone else was killed?

273
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:00,958
Please...

274
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:22,041
Mai!

275
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,416
Get back!

276
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,125
It's him!

277
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:41,583
Are you hurt?

278
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:42,875
I'm fine.

279
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:45,708
Masako?

280
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:47,416
I think I'm okay.

281
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,875
We all need to get out
of here right away...

282
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,625
I wasn't able
to destroy Urado.

283
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:53,416
He'll only be
stunned for a moment.

284
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,125
We'll go out through
that window...!

285
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:14,208
Everyone! Out of
the house! Now!

286
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:15,166
Let's go!

287
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,916
Mai, how many times
did we tell you

288
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,750
not to go out on your own?

289
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:25,625
I know.

290
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,000
I'm Sorry.

291
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:29,208
But I guess something
good came out of it...

292
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,958
We found the
missing people.

293
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:33,375
Where were they?

294
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,625
They were stacked on top
of one another in a room

295
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,208
on the second floor...

296
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:39,208
All of their
throats were slit.

297
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,791
We found sets of bones
in another room...

298
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:46,000
lined up on shelves like
some kind of trophies.

299
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:48,416
They're all
Urado's victims?

300
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,833
Think so.

301
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:51,375
It looks like after
their blood was drained,

302
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:53,500
their flesh was burned
off in an incinerator

303
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:56,083
so their bones could be
displayed on the wall.

304
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:58,958
There's no way a single person
was behind this much carnage.

305
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,791
Hiroyuki tried
to conceal it...

306
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:03,708
I think that's
obvious now.

307
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,583
So many people suffered...

308
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:17,500
Oh hey. Thanks.

309
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:18,833
This really helped.

310
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:22,208
-No way!
-What's wrong?

311
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:25,416
I thought I gave this
to you in my dream.

312
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,458
Retrocognition, clairvoyance

313
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,083
and now, astral projection?

314
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,000
You're building
up quite a résumé.

315
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,541
Oh please.

316
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:35,208
Speaking of talents...
you've got some. Yeah?

317
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:36,958
What was that you
did earlier...?

318
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:38,166
It looked like
you threw something

319
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,875
when you saved
Mai back there.

320
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:41,916
Those were
just my shiki.

321
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,791
-Wow... Really?
-Shiki?

322
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,833
When you make a demon
or spirit you've captured

323
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,958
work for you,
it's called Ekiki.

324
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:51,083
Each spirit you use
is called a shiki.

325
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:53,041
Woah... How cool!

326
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,916
The sun is
starting to rise.

327
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:10,375
Naru... I think you
dropped something.

328
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:11,875
A comb?

329
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:14,208
Actually I think
that belongs to me.

330
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:16,375
Say what...?

331
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:19,000
Why on earth would you
be carrying her comb?

332
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,291
Giving us the silent
treatment, huh?

333
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:25,458
Oh dear.

334
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,958
Now that's
embarrassing.

335
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:31,208
He must have been really
worried about her.

336
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:33,500
Naru's a
kind soul.

337
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,041
What a moving story.

338
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,791
No it's not!

339
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:41,916
I can't believe
what I'm hearing.

340
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,541
Unfortunately, we're
unable to exorcise Urado.

341
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,125
We recommend that you
seal up the house

342
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,625
and let it erode over time,

343
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:50,166
just like Hiroyuki said
in his dying words.

344
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,500
Another option...

345
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:55,125
Would be to purify
it with fire...

346
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:57,166
Burn the entire
house down...

347
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,083
and you will wash
away the offense.

348
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,833
I understand...

349
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,666
Thank you all so
much for your help.

350
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,000
And with that...

351
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:13,458
we left the Miyama
mansion behind us...

352
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:14,916
forever.

353
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,875
A few weeks later, there
was an article in the paper

354
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:30,000
about a huge fire
destroying the house...

355
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:32,833
Considering to the
bizarre facts of our case,

356
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:35,125
the article was far too short.

357
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,291
What?

358
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,291
So... You're leaving already?

359
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,333
Unfortunately I am,
which is too bad

360
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:47,708
because I was just starting
to get to know everyone.

361
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,583
Since I've got
Madoka all to myself,

362
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:55,875
this is a perfect chance
for me to fish for some info.

363
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,458
So uh... tell me...

364
00:20:58,541 --> 00:20:59,958
Yeah?

365
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:02,541
I was wondering if you knew
anything about Naru's folks.

366
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:06,208
Conducting a
background check?

367
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:08,083
No, don't be silly.

368
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:12,333
His father is a "Para-
psychological Researcher".

369
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:15,541
Wow, two generations
of Ghost Hunters.

370
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:16,916
You see...

371
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,666
Naru doesn't normally
talk about himself

372
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,291
unless he's asked.

373
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:22,666
He's not trying to keep his
life a secret or anything,

374
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,500
but I guess you could say
he's just going through

375
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,666
a bit of a "situation"
right now.

376
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:28,875
Really?

377
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:30,125
wanna know?

378
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,083
Promise not to
tell anyone...

379
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:36,541
but Naru and Lin...

380
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,250
have eloped.

381
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:42,000
Wouldn't that
be hilarious?!

382
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:45,625
It sure would...

383
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:48,166
but you are
joking, right...?

384
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,958
I mean Naru and
Masako are together.

385
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:51,708
Wait... is that true?

386
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,333
Well, he was
holding her comb.

387
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:55,500
So that's why
you've been so glum.

388
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:57,333
Don't worry
about it.

389
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:58,791
He may not
show it...

390
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:00,833
but Naru is a
very caring person

391
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:02,208
when it comes
to friends...

392
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:04,166
He is by no means
a social butterfly

393
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,041
but he's not
a robot either.

394
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,958
Soo...

395
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:11,333
There was no special
meaning to it after all.

396
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:14,666
Probably not.

397
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:28,208

398
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:38,208
[Music]

399
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:53,208
[Music]

400
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:51,208
Next time
on Ghost Hunt.

401
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:52,791
The Cursed
House, Part 1.

402
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:55,333
I hope it's not as
scary as this last one!
