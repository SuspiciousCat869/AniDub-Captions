1
00:00:25,682 --> 00:00:28,727
Are you ready?!

2
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:30,270
Are you ready yet?!

3
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:34,649
Come on...

4
00:00:34,733 --> 00:00:36,943
I'm right here...

5
00:00:37,027 --> 00:00:38,737
I'm ready...

6
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,156
Come and find me.

7
00:00:49,372 --> 00:00:52,083
Get your Christmas
cakes ... Right here.

8
00:00:52,167 --> 00:00:53,501
They're really delicious!

9
00:01:10,393 --> 00:01:12,354
Hey...! Naru. Lin.
Good morning!

10
00:01:13,772 --> 00:01:15,231
What are you doing?

11
00:01:15,315 --> 00:01:17,484
It's Christmas Eve silly,
and I think this room

12
00:01:17,567 --> 00:01:20,653
is in dire need of
some festive color.

13
00:01:20,737 --> 00:01:21,946
Take it down.

14
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,783
What...? I've spent the
last hour putting it up!

15
00:01:24,866 --> 00:01:26,910
Take it down.

16
00:01:26,993 --> 00:01:29,245
Come on.

17
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:30,997
Hey! Masako!

18
00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:34,542
Oh... What a beautiful
Christmas tree!

19
00:01:34,626 --> 00:01:36,419
It really looks
great Mai.

20
00:01:39,589 --> 00:01:41,132
Hey! Hey guys!

21
00:01:41,216 --> 00:01:42,050
Ooh you have a tree!

22
00:01:42,133 --> 00:01:43,510
Nice job.

23
00:01:43,593 --> 00:01:45,845
It really puts you in the
Christmas spirit, doesn't it?

24
00:01:45,929 --> 00:01:48,098
You're a monk that
celebrates Christmas?

25
00:01:48,181 --> 00:01:50,433
Look who's talking
Miss Priestess.

26
00:01:50,517 --> 00:01:51,726
Why are you all here...?

27
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,478
There's no work
at the moment.

28
00:01:53,561 --> 00:01:56,064
We're just spending some
time with our dearest friends...

29
00:01:56,147 --> 00:01:57,732
After all it's
Christmas Eve.

30
00:01:57,816 --> 00:01:59,859
What do you say we throw
a little office party?

31
00:01:59,943 --> 00:02:01,027
If you're so desperate
to celebrate

32
00:02:01,111 --> 00:02:02,779
then find yourself
a church...

33
00:02:02,862 --> 00:02:05,281
I don't throw parties
in my place of business.

34
00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:11,287
Let me guess. You've
come to join the party?

35
00:02:11,371 --> 00:02:12,455
Uh...

36
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:13,790
no no...

37
00:02:13,873 --> 00:02:16,376
Actually I came by for
something else entirely...

38
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:18,545
I was wondering if you'd
be interested in a case...

39
00:02:18,628 --> 00:02:20,338
It's for my local parish.

40
00:02:23,883 --> 00:02:25,719
A case...? On Christmas?

41
00:02:27,846 --> 00:02:37,814
[Music]

42
00:02:37,897 --> 00:02:47,824
[Music]

43
00:04:02,148 --> 00:04:05,318
Wow! Check this
place out you guys!

44
00:04:05,402 --> 00:04:07,070
It's amazing!

45
00:04:07,153 --> 00:04:09,322
Christmas at an actual
church...! How cool...!

46
00:04:09,406 --> 00:04:11,366
This sure beats out
an office party!

47
00:04:11,449 --> 00:04:13,618
We didn't come here
to goof around Mai.

48
00:04:13,702 --> 00:04:15,870
I know we're here to
work. I'm just excited.

49
00:04:15,954 --> 00:04:17,789
This is fantastic.

50
00:04:17,872 --> 00:04:19,541
It just doesn't get
better than celebrating

51
00:04:19,624 --> 00:04:21,042
Christmas at a church.

52
00:04:21,126 --> 00:04:22,669
Yeah, we get it.

53
00:04:22,752 --> 00:04:24,838
Look we have a job to do.

54
00:04:24,921 --> 00:04:27,215
And that's why we're
here, to work...

55
00:04:27,298 --> 00:04:29,884
Though you have to admit it is
tough working on a holiday.

56
00:04:29,968 --> 00:04:31,428
That's true.

57
00:04:31,511 --> 00:04:33,304
We're gonna have to try and
wrap this up quick today...

58
00:04:33,388 --> 00:04:36,141
There's a party later on
and you will be there.

59
00:04:36,224 --> 00:04:37,934
Great... Sounds like fun.

60
00:04:43,398 --> 00:04:45,233
Ah Father Brown.

61
00:04:45,316 --> 00:04:46,943
Gday Father

62
00:04:47,027 --> 00:04:48,403
I appreciate your coming by.

63
00:04:48,486 --> 00:04:49,696
Now Kazuya...

64
00:04:49,779 --> 00:04:51,656
I'd like you to meet the
Pastor of the Church.

65
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,949
Father Tojo...

66
00:04:53,033 --> 00:04:54,951
And Father this
is my associate.

67
00:04:55,035 --> 00:04:56,619
He's the head of Shibuya
Psychic Research.

68
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:58,079
Kazuya Shibuya.

69
00:04:58,163 --> 00:04:59,539
It is a pleasure
to meet you.

70
00:05:01,374 --> 00:05:02,709
Wow!

71
00:05:09,716 --> 00:05:11,384
So pretty.

72
00:05:15,722 --> 00:05:16,890
You see that?

73
00:05:16,973 --> 00:05:18,099
There's a kid for
about every country

74
00:05:18,183 --> 00:05:20,727
in the world on
that playground.

75
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:23,271
Father Tojo helps run a day
care service out of the church

76
00:05:23,355 --> 00:05:25,774
for expats that
work here in the city.

77
00:05:25,857 --> 00:05:27,692
A majority of these
children are foreigners

78
00:05:27,776 --> 00:05:30,153
whose parents are over
here on work visas...

79
00:05:30,236 --> 00:05:31,821
The rest of the kids
are either orphans

80
00:05:31,905 --> 00:05:34,783
or those awaiting placement
in a foster home...

81
00:05:34,866 --> 00:05:36,951
But They really love it
here, as you can see.

82
00:05:37,035 --> 00:05:38,661
That's no nice.

83
00:05:42,374 --> 00:05:44,501
Wow! I've seen you on tv!

84
00:05:44,584 --> 00:05:45,919
You're that psychic!

85
00:05:46,002 --> 00:05:47,462
Oh... Hello children.

86
00:05:47,545 --> 00:05:48,797
Come on!

87
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,632
Why don't you talk to
the spirits for us huh?

88
00:05:50,715 --> 00:05:52,217
I wanna see a spirit!

89
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,635
Do it! Show us!

90
00:05:53,718 --> 00:05:54,928
We want to see a ghost!

91
00:05:57,055 --> 00:05:58,723
It's... not that easy kids...

92
00:05:58,807 --> 00:06:00,558
Maybe some
other time okay?

93
00:06:00,642 --> 00:06:01,601
Settle down, children.

94
00:06:01,685 --> 00:06:02,894
Settle down...

95
00:06:02,977 --> 00:06:04,562
I'm so sorry about that.

96
00:06:04,646 --> 00:06:05,605
It's fine.

97
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:06,981
I think I'd be
worried if the kids

98
00:06:07,065 --> 00:06:09,150
weren't so excited, ya know?

99
00:06:09,234 --> 00:06:10,318
You have a point there.

100
00:06:12,278 --> 00:06:14,656
While Father Tojo briefs us on
the details of the case...

101
00:06:14,739 --> 00:06:16,825
I'll need the rest of you
to play babysitter

102
00:06:16,908 --> 00:06:18,702
with the children
until we return.

103
00:06:21,663 --> 00:06:23,123
Alright...! Who's
ready to have some fun

104
00:06:23,206 --> 00:06:25,458
on the swing set
with Takigawa? !

105
00:06:25,542 --> 00:06:27,627
Monk... You're just
riling them up.

106
00:06:27,711 --> 00:06:29,254
Follow me!

107
00:06:33,008 --> 00:06:34,801
There you go...
Wanna go higher?

108
00:06:34,884 --> 00:06:36,469
Just hold on
tight now, okay...

109
00:06:36,553 --> 00:06:37,971
Youre that psychic!

110
00:06:38,054 --> 00:06:40,056
So... are spirits scary?

111
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,433
Show us one! Show us one!

112
00:06:41,516 --> 00:06:43,560
I wanna see!

113
00:06:43,643 --> 00:06:46,563
Well... Believe it or not it's
much harder than it looks.

114
00:06:46,646 --> 00:06:49,733
Honey I don't think you'll
be seeing any ghosts today.

115
00:06:49,816 --> 00:06:51,234
What do you know Grandma?

116
00:06:51,317 --> 00:06:52,944
Oh... Isn't that sweet?

117
00:06:54,821 --> 00:06:55,947
Nice pass there...

118
00:06:56,031 --> 00:06:57,866
Mai...! Ball's
coming to you now!

119
00:06:57,949 --> 00:06:58,992
Bring it on!

120
00:07:01,494 --> 00:07:02,954
Here goes!

121
00:07:05,874 --> 00:07:07,125
Whoops...

122
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:08,752
Sorry.

123
00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:12,797
Now Gentlemen...

124
00:07:12,881 --> 00:07:14,382
Every so often
unexplainable things

125
00:07:14,466 --> 00:07:16,301
will happen here
at the church.

126
00:07:16,384 --> 00:07:17,761
This morning one
of the children

127
00:07:17,844 --> 00:07:19,304
was behaving erratically,

128
00:07:19,387 --> 00:07:21,681
at which point I
telephoned father brown,

129
00:07:21,765 --> 00:07:24,309
And he suggested that I
contact you right away.

130
00:07:24,392 --> 00:07:25,727
You know the kids
from earlier...

131
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,062
the ones from
the daycare...?

132
00:07:27,145 --> 00:07:28,730
Like clockwork every
couple of weeks

133
00:07:28,813 --> 00:07:31,608
one of them will become
possessed by a spirit.

134
00:07:31,691 --> 00:07:34,736
I've exorcised spirits
from them a number of times.

135
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:36,071
But you're saying
no matter what

136
00:07:36,154 --> 00:07:37,781
the possessions reoccur.

137
00:07:37,864 --> 00:07:39,157
That's right.

138
00:07:40,992 --> 00:07:42,660
However the possessions
never seem to do

139
00:07:42,744 --> 00:07:44,496
any permanent harm
to the child...

140
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:47,123
They just behave like a
completely different person...

141
00:07:47,207 --> 00:07:49,459
and they're all
obsessed with hiding.

142
00:07:50,627 --> 00:07:52,253
They're hiding?

143
00:07:57,801 --> 00:08:00,011
Oh where could that
stupid ball have gone...?

144
00:08:00,095 --> 00:08:02,097
It could be anywhere...
Oh wait...

145
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,598
There it is!

146
00:08:06,476 --> 00:08:07,727
Alright.

147
00:08:20,156 --> 00:08:22,409
Whichever child is possessed
will always play a game

148
00:08:22,492 --> 00:08:23,910
we call stick.

149
00:08:23,993 --> 00:08:25,787
It's called stick?

150
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,997
Excuse me. Are you lost?

151
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,419
Are you okay...? What're
you doing out here?

152
00:08:37,716 --> 00:08:39,092
Wait! Come back here!

153
00:08:42,721 --> 00:08:44,681
Hey wait up! Why
are you running?

154
00:08:44,764 --> 00:08:46,933
I'm just trying to
help you...! Stop!

155
00:08:50,562 --> 00:08:51,646
Hey kid...!

156
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:52,731
That's weird...

157
00:08:52,814 --> 00:08:54,065
Where'd he go?

158
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,235
Oh ... Hey

159
00:08:58,653 --> 00:08:59,946
There you are.

160
00:09:01,448 --> 00:09:03,491
Please don't run! There's
nothing to be afraid of!

161
00:09:07,245 --> 00:09:09,664
Stick is essentially
just hide-and-seek,

162
00:09:09,748 --> 00:09:11,583
but instead of shouting
the kids will beat

163
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:13,460
a wooden stick
against something.

164
00:09:13,543 --> 00:09:14,753
One hit means they're
not ready yet

165
00:09:14,836 --> 00:09:16,046
and more than one hit means

166
00:09:16,129 --> 00:09:17,797
they've found their
hiding place.

167
00:09:20,342 --> 00:09:21,468
What is that sound?

168
00:09:35,565 --> 00:09:37,525
Why is it so hard to tell
where it's coming from?

169
00:09:39,903 --> 00:09:42,030
Uh... I'm afraid Thanat
is hiding again.

170
00:09:42,113 --> 00:09:43,239
What's that noise?

171
00:09:43,323 --> 00:09:44,991
That sound is
the stick...

172
00:09:45,075 --> 00:09:46,618
The boy that was behaving
strangely this morning

173
00:09:46,701 --> 00:09:48,370
must be in the
forest somewhere.

174
00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:51,164
We should all split
up and find him.

175
00:09:57,212 --> 00:09:59,756
What the... You hear that?

176
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:00,924
Is there something wrong?

177
00:10:01,007 --> 00:10:02,634
That must be Thanat.

178
00:10:02,717 --> 00:10:04,469
What is he doing?

179
00:10:04,552 --> 00:10:06,805
He's been hiding in the
forest since this morning.

180
00:10:06,888 --> 00:10:09,182
I just hope he's alright.

181
00:10:12,394 --> 00:10:14,896
Hey where did you go? !
I can't find you? !

182
00:10:22,696 --> 00:10:24,364
Where could he be?

183
00:10:30,036 --> 00:10:32,163
I'm gonna find
you eventually!

184
00:10:37,127 --> 00:10:39,087
So this is where
you've been.

185
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:44,426
Mai... are You okay?

186
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:45,844
Hey... Naru...

187
00:10:45,927 --> 00:10:47,262
I found this boy
in the woods.

188
00:10:48,972 --> 00:10:50,223
Wait a second.

189
00:10:51,766 --> 00:10:53,435
Daddy it's you!

190
00:10:53,518 --> 00:10:55,103
Huh?

191
00:10:55,186 --> 00:10:56,479
What did he say?

192
00:11:14,789 --> 00:11:16,499
He really likes Lin.

193
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,335
At least somebody does.

194
00:11:18,418 --> 00:11:19,586
Thanat...

195
00:11:19,669 --> 00:11:21,212
Come over here
for a second.

196
00:11:24,924 --> 00:11:27,427
It appears as if he's
mistaking me for his father...

197
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,220
Would you mind
telling him the truth?

198
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:32,432
Well the funny
thing is,

199
00:11:32,515 --> 00:11:34,934
you bear an uncanny
resemblance to Kenji's father.

200
00:11:38,688 --> 00:11:39,856
Who's Kenji?

201
00:11:39,939 --> 00:11:41,066
According to Father Tojo,

202
00:11:41,149 --> 00:11:42,859
there used to be a boy
here named Kenji...

203
00:11:42,942 --> 00:11:44,527
one day he disappeared.

204
00:11:44,611 --> 00:11:45,779
Shortly after that,

205
00:11:45,862 --> 00:11:47,447
the possessions
started occurring.

206
00:11:52,035 --> 00:11:53,536
Hello... You must
have gotten a chill

207
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,455
while you were outside...

208
00:11:55,538 --> 00:11:57,791
I've made some of my famous
hot tea for everyone...

209
00:11:57,874 --> 00:11:59,376
Would you all
care for some?

210
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:01,419
Oh yeah that
sounds wonderful

211
00:12:01,503 --> 00:12:03,546
Thanks alot.

212
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,006
Yes thank you.

213
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:08,051
Ahh, now that's good...

214
00:12:08,134 --> 00:12:09,886
So Naru... Do we know
anything about this boy

215
00:12:09,969 --> 00:12:11,805
that went missing?

216
00:12:11,888 --> 00:12:14,307
Actually Father, didn't you
mention that this time of year

217
00:12:14,391 --> 00:12:16,601
holds some significance
to the phenomenon?

218
00:12:16,685 --> 00:12:19,479
Kenji first arrived to your
church around this same time.

219
00:12:19,562 --> 00:12:20,939
That's right...

220
00:12:21,022 --> 00:12:22,857
it was a week before the church
moved into this building

221
00:12:22,941 --> 00:12:24,943
from another location
in the city.

222
00:12:32,242 --> 00:12:33,910
You said that Kenji was
originally brought here

223
00:12:33,993 --> 00:12:35,870
by his father...

224
00:12:35,954 --> 00:12:37,622
but even though he
promised to return

225
00:12:37,706 --> 00:12:40,542
for his boy the
following Christmas...

226
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,836
the man vanished
without at trace.

227
00:12:45,213 --> 00:12:47,173
Why don't we head
inside, Kenji?

228
00:12:48,508 --> 00:12:50,593
It was apparent from the
start that Kenji suffered

229
00:12:50,677 --> 00:12:52,887
from a mental disorder...

230
00:12:52,971 --> 00:12:56,850
which left him unable to
speak like a normal child.

231
00:12:58,768 --> 00:13:00,145
That's terrible.

232
00:13:02,022 --> 00:13:04,190
When that boy saw Lin
earlier he called him daddy...

233
00:13:04,274 --> 00:13:06,526
Wouldn't that mean
Kenji is able to talk?

234
00:13:06,609 --> 00:13:08,194
He must have had strong
feelings for his dad

235
00:13:08,278 --> 00:13:10,113
to notice him through
another body.

236
00:13:10,196 --> 00:13:11,656
I bet that's why he was
able to speak up

237
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,324
when he saw Lin...

238
00:13:13,408 --> 00:13:16,161
It must have been overwhelming
after such a long time.

239
00:13:16,244 --> 00:13:18,288
Although He may not have been
able to speak like the others...

240
00:13:18,371 --> 00:13:20,540
he was happy... and playful...

241
00:13:20,623 --> 00:13:22,417
all of the other kids took a
liking to him immediately.

242
00:13:24,169 --> 00:13:25,503
They even crafted
playground games

243
00:13:25,587 --> 00:13:27,005
to include Kenji...

244
00:13:27,088 --> 00:13:29,257
such as the hide-and-seek
game called stick.

245
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:31,384
At that time, the parish
was in its infancy

246
00:13:31,468 --> 00:13:33,928
and the building itself
under construction.

247
00:13:34,012 --> 00:13:36,473
But children were so happy
to be getting a new home,

248
00:13:36,556 --> 00:13:39,559
they just chose to play
around the construction.

249
00:13:39,642 --> 00:13:42,520
They actually found it
to be quite exciting.

250
00:13:42,604 --> 00:13:44,981
Hey...! Who wants to
play hide-and-seek?

251
00:13:45,065 --> 00:13:46,649
I do! I wanna play!

252
00:13:48,109 --> 00:13:51,071
Kenji, do you
wanna play too?

253
00:13:51,154 --> 00:13:53,031
But... You never
say anything,

254
00:13:53,114 --> 00:13:55,075
so if you can't shout
'I'm ready' or 'not yet'

255
00:13:55,158 --> 00:13:56,826
then how are you
supposed to play?

256
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,036
He's right.

257
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:05,585
I know...! What if Kenji
could give us a signal

258
00:14:05,669 --> 00:14:07,671
when he's ready or not
instead of saying it?

259
00:14:07,754 --> 00:14:09,923
Good idea!

260
00:14:11,591 --> 00:14:14,386
I found this stick for you to
signal us, okay Kenji...?

261
00:14:14,469 --> 00:14:15,762
You just tap it...

262
00:14:15,845 --> 00:14:18,056
Once for not yet and a
bunch when you're ready.

263
00:14:23,895 --> 00:14:26,314
Ready yet?

264
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:28,024
Not yet!

265
00:14:34,572 --> 00:14:36,366
Ready yet?

266
00:14:41,162 --> 00:14:42,914
Apparently Kenji was
very fond of this game...

267
00:14:42,997 --> 00:14:44,833
and played it quite often.

268
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,751
Would you say
that's true?

269
00:14:46,835 --> 00:14:48,086
Oh yes...

270
00:14:48,169 --> 00:14:49,587
Kenji was known around
the playground

271
00:14:49,671 --> 00:14:51,464
for being the
best at hiding...

272
00:14:51,548 --> 00:14:52,465
The other kids
would call him

273
00:14:52,549 --> 00:14:54,467
the Master of
Stick for that.

274
00:14:54,551 --> 00:14:57,429
Even now I can still see
the big smile on his face

275
00:14:57,512 --> 00:15:00,056
as he would step out from
wherever he was hiding...

276
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,225
so proud that no one
was able to find him.

277
00:15:03,768 --> 00:15:05,520
Later, for his birthday,
Father Tojo gave him

278
00:15:05,603 --> 00:15:07,856
a whistle on a string to
wear around his neck...

279
00:15:07,939 --> 00:15:09,357
He then replaced the
stick for the whistle

280
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:10,859
while playing the game.

281
00:15:10,942 --> 00:15:12,360
Right.

282
00:15:14,946 --> 00:15:17,407
Now try to keep this
with you all the time.

283
00:15:20,243 --> 00:15:21,494
Pay attention...

284
00:15:21,578 --> 00:15:23,079
If you ever need something
you can blow the whistle

285
00:15:23,163 --> 00:15:25,081
rather than using
your voice, 'kay?

286
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,628
Unfortunately, not
long afterwards,

287
00:15:30,712 --> 00:15:32,088
Kenji went missing.

288
00:15:33,506 --> 00:15:35,258
This was at a time when
the church's construction

289
00:15:35,342 --> 00:15:37,177
was nearly complete...

290
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,970
and the children were
looking forward to having

291
00:15:39,054 --> 00:15:41,264
their first Christmas
in their new house.

292
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,062
What...? Kenji's gone?
When did this happen?

293
00:15:49,064 --> 00:15:50,899
Well We were all playing
stick at the new house

294
00:15:50,982 --> 00:15:53,068
when it started
raining on us.

295
00:15:53,151 --> 00:15:54,361
We said we were
going back in

296
00:15:54,444 --> 00:15:57,447
but Kenji never came out
of his hiding place.

297
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:58,823
It's alright...

298
00:15:58,907 --> 00:16:00,658
I want you kids to
stay right here...

299
00:16:00,742 --> 00:16:03,286
I'll go outside and bring
Kenji back in, okay?

300
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:07,207
Kenji! Kenji!
Where are you? !

301
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:10,960
Hey Kenji...!
Can you hear me? !!

302
00:16:11,044 --> 00:16:12,545
Father...

303
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:14,589
There's no sign
of him out back.

304
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:16,007
Oh no...

305
00:16:16,091 --> 00:16:17,759
Where in the
world could he be?

306
00:16:17,842 --> 00:16:19,135
Hey Father... .

307
00:16:19,219 --> 00:16:20,970
Over here!

308
00:16:24,474 --> 00:16:25,850
The scaffolding!

309
00:16:25,934 --> 00:16:27,644
Don't tell me he's
trapped under there.

310
00:16:27,727 --> 00:16:29,145
I'll get some more hands.

311
00:16:48,832 --> 00:16:51,042
After four hours of
intense searching,

312
00:16:51,126 --> 00:16:53,169
no one ever found a
trace of Kenji.

313
00:16:53,253 --> 00:16:54,629
And then?

314
00:16:56,464 --> 00:16:58,008
The next day...

315
00:16:58,091 --> 00:17:00,343
The staff began a broader
search for Kenji...

316
00:17:00,427 --> 00:17:02,595
and found a whistle,
similar to the one he wore,

317
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:04,931
next to a storage
shed behind the church.

318
00:17:05,015 --> 00:17:07,392
They found it
behind the church?

319
00:17:07,475 --> 00:17:09,853
There's an aqueduct that runs
east to west back there.

320
00:17:12,897 --> 00:17:14,524
It's quite deep and at
the time they hadn't yet

321
00:17:14,607 --> 00:17:16,651
erected the fence
that's there now.

322
00:17:17,861 --> 00:17:20,280
So you believe he fell
into the aqueduct?

323
00:17:20,363 --> 00:17:21,740
I do.

324
00:17:21,823 --> 00:17:23,700
The police did an
extensive search between

325
00:17:23,783 --> 00:17:26,286
the church and the river
that the aqueduct feeds into...

326
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:29,205
They never found one
piece of evidence.

327
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:31,416
So the police could
never find the body...

328
00:17:31,499 --> 00:17:33,543
poor child,
that's horrible.

329
00:17:41,468 --> 00:17:43,511
Were those sounds I
heard earlier today...

330
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:45,055
from Kenji...?

331
00:17:45,138 --> 00:17:46,931
Is it possible
that he could...

332
00:17:47,015 --> 00:17:49,559
still be playing
hide-and-go-seek?

333
00:17:49,642 --> 00:17:51,686
Anything is possible Mai.

334
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,230
I wonder if he's out there
still beating his stick...

335
00:17:54,314 --> 00:17:56,941
because he lost his
whistle so long ago...

336
00:17:57,025 --> 00:17:59,527
as if he's begging to
be... found.

337
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:01,988
It doesn't sound like
there's any danger.

338
00:18:02,072 --> 00:18:03,239
Huh?

339
00:18:03,323 --> 00:18:04,574
But there is the
possibility

340
00:18:04,657 --> 00:18:07,327
that this could escalate
into something bigger.

341
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,162
What exactly do you
mean by escalate...?

342
00:18:09,245 --> 00:18:11,956
Are you saying this could maybe
turn into something worse?

343
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:16,252
I don't know... From what
I've heard so far...

344
00:18:16,336 --> 00:18:17,796
this is an innocent haunting

345
00:18:17,879 --> 00:18:19,130
because Kenji would
never do anything

346
00:18:19,214 --> 00:18:21,257
to harm the people
he cares for.

347
00:18:21,341 --> 00:18:22,425
Yeah but...

348
00:18:22,509 --> 00:18:23,927
no matter how many
times I drive him out

349
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:25,762
he always comes back again...

350
00:18:25,845 --> 00:18:27,472
Plus from what Father
Tojo has told us...

351
00:18:27,555 --> 00:18:28,932
Lately...

352
00:18:29,015 --> 00:18:30,392
Kenji's been appearing a
lot more frequently

353
00:18:30,475 --> 00:18:33,144
than he used to which could
be a sign for the worst.

354
00:18:34,938 --> 00:18:36,981
The possessions are...
changing him.

355
00:18:37,065 --> 00:18:38,942
Really...? What
do you mean?

356
00:18:39,025 --> 00:18:39,818
Well you hear
people say that the

357
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:41,152
"spirit of their
ancestors"

358
00:18:41,236 --> 00:18:42,487
is haunting them, right?

359
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:43,780
But do you think a
spirit would knowingly do

360
00:18:43,863 --> 00:18:45,532
something horrific
to their own family?

361
00:18:46,741 --> 00:18:47,909
No.

362
00:18:47,992 --> 00:18:50,328
Yet sometimes
that is the case.

363
00:18:50,412 --> 00:18:52,997
My point is that dead people
who are left to wander...

364
00:18:53,081 --> 00:18:55,166
tend to change over time.

365
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,168
Though change isn't
the right word.

366
00:18:57,252 --> 00:18:58,586
Think of it as if they
absorb the thoughts

367
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:01,256
of those around them and are
altered in the process.

368
00:19:01,339 --> 00:19:03,800
So wait, You're saying
spirits can be influenced

369
00:19:03,883 --> 00:19:05,552
by the actions of humans?

370
00:19:05,635 --> 00:19:07,303
That's one way
of putting it.

371
00:19:07,387 --> 00:19:08,888
Otherwise they'd
become too attached

372
00:19:08,972 --> 00:19:10,682
to something on earth...

373
00:19:10,765 --> 00:19:11,975
and would just end
up embodying

374
00:19:12,058 --> 00:19:14,310
the very thing
they've left behind.

375
00:19:14,394 --> 00:19:15,645
That means...

376
00:19:15,729 --> 00:19:17,981
even though Kenji was
good while he was alive...

377
00:19:18,064 --> 00:19:21,026
he may not necessarily be
so nice in the afterlife.

378
00:19:21,109 --> 00:19:22,944
That's pretty much it.

379
00:19:24,738 --> 00:19:26,364
So what do we do now?

380
00:19:26,448 --> 00:19:27,532
That's simple...

381
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,242
We'll just have to
start looking for him.

382
00:19:31,077 --> 00:19:32,746
Now let's get to work.

383
00:19:39,627 --> 00:19:40,879
It's so odd.

384
00:19:40,962 --> 00:19:43,214
Well that's an
understatement.

385
00:19:43,298 --> 00:19:45,008
You know... Lin actually
looks like he'd make

386
00:19:45,091 --> 00:19:46,509
a pretty good dad.

387
00:19:46,593 --> 00:19:48,428
You're filming?

388
00:19:48,511 --> 00:19:52,057
Strange scenes like this need
to be immortalized on tape.

389
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,434
Usually, Kenji will
emerge from the child

390
00:19:54,517 --> 00:19:57,228
after playing a game
of hide-and-seek.

391
00:19:57,312 --> 00:19:58,897
Maybe he feels more secure

392
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,815
thinking his
father is around.

393
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:02,150
One thing's for sure.

394
00:20:02,233 --> 00:20:04,069
Shooting video isn't
going to help...

395
00:20:04,152 --> 00:20:06,654
So John... lets see if
you can drive him out.

396
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,198
Okay.

397
00:20:11,534 --> 00:20:13,578
All of the curtains in
the room are closed.

398
00:20:15,538 --> 00:20:17,499
-You ready John?
-Yes.

399
00:20:26,424 --> 00:20:27,926
Our father who
art in heaven...

400
00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:30,136
hallowed be thy name.

401
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,222
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done,

402
00:20:32,305 --> 00:20:34,891
on earth as it is in heaven.

403
00:20:34,974 --> 00:20:36,935
Give us this day
our daily bread,

404
00:20:37,018 --> 00:20:39,229
and forgive us
our trespasses.

405
00:20:39,312 --> 00:20:41,690
As we forgive those who
trespass against us, and

406
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:44,192
I feel bad for Kenji...

407
00:20:44,275 --> 00:20:47,153
he just looked so happy
thinking he was with his father.

408
00:20:47,237 --> 00:20:49,698
And now he's about
to feel alone again.

409
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:52,701
Yeah... But for Kenji
to stay happy

410
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:54,744
Thanat has to stay possessed...

411
00:20:54,828 --> 00:20:56,287
it's not fair to him.

412
00:20:56,371 --> 00:20:58,665
Yeah I know but...

413
00:20:58,748 --> 00:21:00,125
Amen.

414
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,714
May god have mercy
on your soul.

415
00:21:16,057 --> 00:21:18,601
It's alright... He's
no longer possessed.

416
00:21:33,491 --> 00:21:35,160
Father!

417
00:21:37,662 --> 00:21:38,997
What is that?

418
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,749
Can you guys...

419
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:42,125
feel it?

420
00:21:47,881 --> 00:21:49,632
Those are
knocking sounds.

421
00:21:58,975 --> 00:22:00,727
Uh... Mai...?

422
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:01,686
Are you alright?

423
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:03,897
How do you feel Thanat?

424
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,148
Okay.

425
00:22:08,568 --> 00:22:10,570
Hey... What happened
to me Father?

426
00:22:15,658 --> 00:22:17,577
Mai... What
are... you doing?

427
00:22:24,709 --> 00:22:26,419
What? No way...!

428
00:22:26,503 --> 00:22:28,546
I think Kenji
just possessed Mai!

429
00:22:36,596 --> 00:22:46,564
[Music]

430
00:22:46,648 --> 00:22:56,574
[Music]

431
00:24:07,062 --> 00:24:09,814
Next time on Ghost Hunt.
Silent Christmas, Part 2.

432
00:24:09,898 --> 00:24:12,067
Wait, what just
happened to me?
