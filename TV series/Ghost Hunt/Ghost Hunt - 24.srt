1
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:14,416
All right!

2
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,166
I wanna know which one
of you hurt the children? !

3
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,333
And who made them carry
those horrible things?

4
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:19,666
What do you mean?

5
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,333
I'm talking about
those useless charms

6
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:22,583
you're making them hold...

7
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:24,375
Take those away from them!

8
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:25,500
You've brainwashed
the kids

9
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:27,375
into holding those
ridiculous charms...

10
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:28,958
And you've done
something to Hazuki.

11
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:30,458
I can see it
in her eyes...

12
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:32,875
It's the same thing
you've done to the others!

13
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:36,000
Oh no, don't tell me
she's possessed too.

14
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:38,666
How long do you think you
people can get away with this?

15
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:45,291
This is merely something
you need to make sure

16
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:47,041
that you're protected.

17
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:49,000
Please, just carry
it with you, okay?

18
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:52,791
That thing is useless.

19
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:54,916
It won't stop anything.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,125
That's not true...

21
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:59,083
Please, take it.

22
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:22,416
[Music]

23
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:32,416
[Music]

24
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:42,416
[Music]

25
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:52,458
[Music]

26
00:01:52,541 --> 00:02:02,458
[Music]

27
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:12,458
[Music]

28
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:22,458
[Music]

29
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,791
You see...? Your
piece of paper

30
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:54,958
turned out to be
completely worthless.

31
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,375
We're gonna have
to bind her.

32
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:57,833
Okay.

33
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,083
Rin...

34
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:02,625
Pyo... To...

35
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:03,666
Sha...

36
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,000
Uh... You're sure you're
okay with this...?

37
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:09,500
I thought we shouldn't use
the nine cuts on people.

38
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:11,958
This one is called the
Binding of Immobility...

39
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,416
It just keeps her
from moving around.

40
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,625
In the name of our
Lord Jesus Christ...

41
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:21,833
I command unto thee...

42
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:24,750
To whatever part of the
body thou mayest be hiding,

43
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,875
show thyself at once,

44
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,208
and flee thee
from the person

45
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,250
which thou hast
occupied.

46
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,000
Leave at once.

47
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:33,625
Leave the body you
have imprisoned

48
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:34,916
and seek not a body

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,500
that was given unto
God, the Almighty.

50
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:39,791
In the name of the
Father, the Son,

51
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,458
and the of Holy Spirit,

52
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,875
I forbid thee from entering
this hallowed body again

53
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,708
for all eternity...

54
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,500
In... principio.

55
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,208
Umm...

56
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:57,500
Hey...

57
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:58,958
Yoko?

58
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:06,000
What just... happened?

59
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,666
Who are you?

60
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:17,250
Yoko had no memory of the
last two days ever happening.

61
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,375
It's like we were
complete strangers to her.

62
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,375
Which can only mean that
she was already possessed

63
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,666
by the spirit before
we arrived here.

64
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,250
Sounds about right...

65
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,333
Of course this also means
it's a fair assumption

66
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:31,166
that every member of
the Yoshimi family

67
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,625
is possessed.

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,958
And then there's Naru...

69
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,833
I still don't understand
why he didn't even

70
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:39,083
try to run away from it.

71
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:44,208
-Naru!
-Don't do it!

72
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,583
Oh... 'Scuse me.

73
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:55,333
I'm interrupting
you guys ...

74
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:56,666
I can come back.

75
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,125
No it's alright.

76
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:00,041
Is there something
you need to tell us?

77
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,583
So did you find her?

78
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:12,875
Not yet...

79
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:14,916
And we looked
everywhere for her.

80
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,250
When we searched her
bedroom we found that

81
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:17,958
she had left her wallet
and keys behind,

82
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,291
so I doubt she
could have made it

83
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,875
very far all by herself.

84
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,416
Actually, now that
I think of it,

85
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,500
I don't believe we ever gave
her a charm for protection.

86
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:27,375
If she still hasn't
returned by morning,

87
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:30,083
I'll file a missing persons
report with the police...

88
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,666
I guess that's all we
can do for tonight.

89
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,791
Takigawa...

90
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,000
Look...

91
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,458
It's the feed
from the cave.

92
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:41,625
-John!
-Yeah?

93
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,000
Follow me.

94
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,500
Oh... right.

95
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:47,958
Hey, should I come too?

96
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,458
No. You watch the base.

97
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,125
What's going on?

98
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:56,625
What are you seeing, Mai?

99
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:57,916
I think there may be
something caught

100
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,708
on the rocks down there.

101
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:01,000
Show me.

102
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,375
Right there.

103
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:04,166
It bobs up and down
whenever the waves roll in.

104
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:17,625
No...

105
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,416
Oh god.

106
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,750
Is that...

107
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,083
Wait! Akifumi!

108
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,750
This is terrible.

109
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,958
What they found
in the cave...

110
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:34,291
turned out to
be Nao's body.

111
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:44,541
Why can't Naru be here
at a time like this?

112
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,500
Alright Masako.

113
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,500
I think you should
try to channel Nao.

114
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:03,666
Monk... Shouldn't we
invite the family in here

115
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,041
in case we make contact?

116
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,500
No way.

117
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,000
But you have to take
into consideration

118
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,708
the suddenness of
her death...

119
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:12,291
She may have things she
needs to tell her family.

120
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,375
It's possible her death
was because of foul play.

121
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:17,666
Not only that, it's
likely the murderer

122
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,041
is someone in her family.

123
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,541
You think so?

124
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:23,208
I wish it weren't the case but
that's the grim reality...

125
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:26,083
That's why we need Masako
to summon her spirit...

126
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,125
Maybe she can tell
us what happened.

127
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:36,916
Are you... Miss Nao Yoshimi?

128
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yes.

129
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,875
Nao Yoshimi...

130
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:43,666
you have passed away
and are now deceased...

131
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,166
Do you know how you died?

132
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:48,500
I fell...

133
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,291
in the sea.

134
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,416
I was looking...

135
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,875
at the water...

136
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:57,166
from just outside
the restaurant...

137
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,166
when someone pushed me.

138
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,416
But who did it?

139
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,833
Who pushed you?

140
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:07,125
Do you remember
anything...?

141
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:09,166
Even the slightest detail
could help us find out

142
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,875
who did this to you.

143
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,916
I don't know...

144
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,041
I don't want to know
who did this to me.

145
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,791
What's wrong?

146
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:23,625
Something is
pulling on me...

147
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:24,791
Let go...

148
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,250
Please! Someone help me,

149
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,375
Let go of me!

150
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:28,958
-What is it?
-Help her!

151
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,375
But I don't wanna
go in there...

152
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,500
Get away, monster!

153
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:35,000
Let go of me!

154
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:43,583
She said...

155
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,625
it was a monster, right?

156
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,750
What in the world
could it have been?

157
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:50,000
Okay, Nao herself has
confirmed the fact

158
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,458
that she was
indeed murdered...

159
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:56,166
And most likely by someone
in her own family

160
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Nao? Is that you?

161
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,000
Hello?

162
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,875
This is just like that
other dream I had ...

163
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:37,541
All of the spirits are
moving up into the sky.

164
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,083
That shrine...

165
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,791
It looks distorted again.

166
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,041
She's back...

167
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:53,000
Where are you
going, Nao...?

168
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:55,833
Wait.

169
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:57,583
I don't get it...

170
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:58,916
why is she...

171
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,625
What are you doing...
How come...

172
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:08,166
It's the ritual
of rebirth.

173
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,916
Naru!

174
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,291
Moving through a dark
hole signifies being reborn,

175
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,083
as if she's passing
through the birth canal

176
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:15,875
for a second time...

177
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:18,000
As she passes through
the cave again and again,

178
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,500
she's attempting in her own way
to leave this world behind

179
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,666
and be reborn as
something else.

180
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,666
As something else?

181
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:29,041
This cave
summons spirits.

182
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:31,083
As soon as a soul
enters the cave...

183
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,583
it will repeat
the ritual...

184
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,375
That's about all
I know so far.

185
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,708
Wait, then does that mean
I'm a spirit right now too?

186
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,500
Yes...

187
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:44,958
That's why it's best that you
not come close to here alone...

188
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:46,375
Let's go.

189
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:51,000
We get to hold
hands again.

190
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:55,500
Umm, uh...

191
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:56,791
Naru...?

192
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,833
Remember last
time when you told me

193
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:01,000
that you showed me the
way into the dream...?

194
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:03,041
Have you been doing
that this whole time?

195
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:09,958
-Mai.
-Yeah? What?

196
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,583
Naru...? What
happened to you...?

197
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:16,000
You were just here.

198
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:17,083
Where'd you run
off to...?

199
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,250
-Naru?
-Mai...

200
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,291
Mai...

201
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:22,666
What the...

202
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,083
I'm still at base?

203
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,625
Wait is it already morning...?

204
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,375
Did I sleep through
the whole night?

205
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,916
It sounds like I
ruined all the fun

206
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,916
by waking you up just now...

207
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,375
You were on a date with
him, weren't you...?

208
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,833
I ask because you were
confusing me with someone else

209
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:40,541
while you
were dreaming.

210
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,000
Oh No No No No,
I promise,

211
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,166
it was nothing
like that at all!

212
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:47,000
So tell me, did anything
productive happen to take place?

213
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:48,333
Huh...?

214
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,333
Oh you mean
like a clue?

215
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,625
So you saw
womb cycling...

216
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,250
That's interesting...

217
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:57,916
I myself have
seen that occur

218
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,625
but only around
shrines and temples.

219
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,666
The dark tunnel is
supposed to replicate

220
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,208
the feeling of being
in your mother's womb,

221
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,875
and when you exit the cave,

222
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:08,083
it's as if you're
being reborn

223
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:09,791
into a whole new life.

224
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:11,333
Wow.

225
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,583
But I don't understand
why Nao would be doing that.

226
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,625
Hey... Good to see ya...

227
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:17,666
What's up?

228
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,000
Good to see you too!

229
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,666
I called him in
for backup...

230
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,041
So man...

231
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:23,333
Why don't you
join me at base?

232
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,291
There's something that
I need to show you.

233
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:26,750
Okay.

234
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,166
Geez, I've been
here five seconds

235
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,041
and I'm already
being put to work.

236
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,791
So we should
catch up later...

237
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,625
See you around, Mai.

238
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,208
Bye... See ya later.

239
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:53,541
What is that...?
Sounds awful.

240
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,041
Not sure.

241
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,375
I just came
across it while

242
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:58,541
I was going over
yesterday's data.

243
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,666
It sounds like a
dinosaur snoring.

244
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,083
Yeah.

245
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:04,916
Hey... guys?

246
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,458
Oh no!

247
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,750
There's smoke coming
from the main building!

248
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:17,875
Are there any more
fire extinguishers?

249
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,041
Yes, uh... I'll get them.

250
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:22,125
-Here you go Monk.
-Thanks.

251
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,000
I'm gonna get more
fire extinguishers!

252
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,500
Naru!

253
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,000
I'll be right back!

254
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,333
Lin wait!

255
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:32,125
Oh no...

256
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:35,416
Ayako! Help Hiroe with
the extinguishers!

257
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,208
What...? Wait, where
are you going Mai?

258
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,958
Lin!

259
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,833
Kazuyasu's been possessed too!

260
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,416
Stop it.

261
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,666
If you open that door, you
will die, I guarantee it.

262
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,791
Listen up Mai...

263
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,791
Try using the
Nine Cuts on him.

264
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:01,416
But I'm not supposed
to do that to people.

265
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,208
If I do it I'll just
end up killing him ...

266
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:06,208
Now that thin wall isn't
going to hold for much longer.

267
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:07,791
If Naru wakes up, it's over.

268
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:13,333
Naru!

269
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,666
No... I can't do it!

270
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:25,958
Careful Lin,
he's dangerous!

271
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,958
I'm so sorry...

272
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,541
but... I have to ...

273
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:37,625
Rin! Pyo...!

274
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,125
To! Sha!

275
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:40,541
Kai! Jin!

276
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:41,500
Retsu! Zai!

277
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:42,625
Zen!

278
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:51,541
Mai, I need you to get
Takigawa over here right away!

279
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,416
Have someone
watch the base!

280
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:03,875
He did what?

281
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:05,125
C'mon John, let's go!

282
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:06,458
-Right!
-Ayako!

283
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:07,666
Masako!

284
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,791
Cover the base!

285
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:09,916
Got it!

286
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,500
There they are!

287
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:24,250
Takigawa...! Be careful!

288
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,375
He's been using
whirlwind sickles.

289
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:47,083
You did it.

290
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,541
You pushed Nao
to her death...

291
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,416
Didn't you Kazuyasu...?!

292
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,666
You're the one who
killed the dogs

293
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:54,666
and tampered with the car.

294
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,291
Now just admit it!

295
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,666
Just who the hell
are you in there...?!

296
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,708
Why are you tormenting
this family?

297
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,291
Tell me... Who are you...?

298
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,291
And Why are you trying
to release Naru...?

299
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,208
What's your
purpose for being here?

300
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:16,458
To kill... Death to everyone!

301
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,000
No! Don't do it!

302
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,791
That's awful.

303
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,500
But we can't let
it get us down...

304
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:34,125
If we leave here with our
tails between our legs...

305
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:35,416
then the lives that
have been lost

306
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,000
and the effort we've put
in will be for nothing.

307
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,041
You're right.

308
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,166
Now if I can just
find my notes

309
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,291
I can let you know
what I found out...

310
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:46,125
I'll get right
to the point...

311
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:47,916
The problem isn't with
the Yoshimi family,

312
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,416
but with the location.

313
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,750
Really...?

314
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:53,125
You mean the actual ground
the house is built upon?

315
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,333
The land used to belong to
the Fujisako family,

316
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,833
but around a-hundred
fifty years ago,

317
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:01,583
near the end of
the Edo period,

318
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,166
the family died off...

319
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:06,916
Soon after the Yoshimi
family bought the property.

320
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,083
But they died off too
after four generations...

321
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:12,458
The current Yoshimi family
is another branch on the tree,

322
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:14,666
if you will, from the
Kanazawa area.

323
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,958
That makes sense...

324
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,916
And it explains why we
were only able to find

325
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,875
records for the last
two heads of the family

326
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:21,458
inside the temple.

327
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,375
So moving on, I found
an interesting story

328
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,500
that could offer
some clues.

329
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:28,708
It's commonly referred to as the
legend of the ijin killings.

330
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:29,833
What's Ijin?

331
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,625
The definition of ijin is

332
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,416
"someone from another place"...

333
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,041
Back then villages were
closed communities...

334
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,875
so in addition to being
extremely suspicious of

335
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:39,791
any kind of outsiders...

336
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:41,666
If the stranger showed
any signs of power

337
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:42,916
that impressed the villagers,

338
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,875
they'd become an
object of worship.

339
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:47,125
What kind of power
would that take?

340
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:48,750
In those days,
outside of merchants,

341
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:51,625
most of the travelers were
heavily into religion,

342
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,875
with many of them
practicing shugenja.

343
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,791
They would visit villages
and pray that the upcoming rain

344
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,500
or harvest be
plentiful,

345
00:17:58,583 --> 00:17:59,958
and sometimes would
even fight goblins

346
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:01,875
and exorcise harmful spirits.

347
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:03,750
Wow... That's almost
exactly what we do.

348
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,041
Yes. In those days

349
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,041
you all would have
made fine ijin.

350
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,750
Although the customs have
changed over the years,

351
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,500
it's basically the same.

352
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,083
Some of the family
members said that

353
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:15,583
thirty-two years ago three
spiritualists died here...

354
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:18,541
We can't leave this place
until we clean it up.

355
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:22,041
So... Tell us what you know
about this ijin killing legend.

356
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,875
Oh right...

357
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:25,000
The Okobu you
were told about

358
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,666
is an integral part
of the story.

359
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:27,958
Okobu?

360
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,291
Long ago, there were
three shugenja monks

361
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:32,625
that came to the village.

362
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:36,291
They immediately saw
the Okobu and said

363
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,125
it would bring about a
curse to the village,

364
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:40,208
so they performed an
exorcism on it.

365
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:43,666
The Okobu morphed into
a gold statue of Buddha.

366
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,750
The shugenja said "only a
curse on the statue itself

367
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:49,500
could have caused it to
end up in such a way."

368
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,750
So they offered to build a
shrine for it in the village,

369
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,916
where it could be safe.

370
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,875
However, the village
elder's desire to own the

371
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:59,291
statue himself drove him to
kill the monks on the beach.

372
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,666
After that, the Buddha statue
turned back into driftwood.

373
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,125
The elder's family became
plagued with misfortune

374
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:07,250
and eventually died off.

375
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,625
It was dubbed
the Monk's curse.

376
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,416
So three
shugenja monks...

377
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,250
or maybe three "Rokubu?"

378
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,750
Rokubu?

379
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:18,041
The pilgrims
that traveled to

380
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,875
each of the sixty-six
sacred spots

381
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,000
and would leave a copy
of the holy sutra

382
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,416
were called
the 'sixty-six',

383
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,250
or more commonly,
the rokubu.

384
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,375
Those three mounds we
found near the shrine...

385
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,208
I wouldn't be surprised
if they were the graves

386
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:33,833
of the three monks that
were killed here.

387
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:36,750
The graves of the
three rokubu...

388
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:39,041
Hence the sanroku mounds!

389
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,541
Yeah... Hold on
just one second...

390
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:44,708
I have some folklore about
the rokubu mounds somewhere.

391
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:46,250
Ah, here it is.

392
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:48,208
In year Bunkyu ...

393
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,041
or in eighteen sixty-two,
there was a revolt

394
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:51,416
by the peasants in the area

395
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,541
that was ultimately suppressed.

396
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,708
The villagers turned
over the five peasants

397
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:58,708
that instigated the revolt in
exchange for their own lives,

398
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:00,333
but the men escaped...

399
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:03,083
When they were caught by
the mob chasing them,

400
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:04,583
they were beheaded
on the spot.

401
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:07,708
Five of them?

402
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,958
Soon after there were
countless epidemics

403
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:14,333
and strange events
surrounding the village,

404
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:17,125
and it didn't take long for
word of a curse to spread.

405
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:20,000
But after a temple was erected
next to the rokubu mounds,

406
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:22,166
the strange
phenomena disappeared.

407
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,333
Hold on...

408
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,333
Next to the rokubu
mounds is right here!

409
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,041
There's more.

410
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,625
After the leaders of the
revolt were beheaded,

411
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,875
the villagers gave
them a proper burial,

412
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:35,083
but legend has it,

413
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:36,875
if you disrespect
the graves,

414
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:38,750
strange growths will
appear on your neck,

415
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:41,625
and your head will
eventually fall off.

416
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,750
Strange growths
on your neck?

417
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,125
Five graves...

418
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,208
the revolt leaders ...

419
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:50,041
Those stones
out at the cape!

420
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,750
Those are the graves
of the peasants

421
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,833
that were betrayed and
killed by the villagers.

422
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:56,958
Of course, drowning in the
sea would be merciful...

423
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:59,041
not nearly as bad...

424
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,083
as someone chopping off
your head don't you think?

425
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:02,416
Or having...

426
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,583
the people that you
love betray your trust.

427
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,750
I shall curse you
from beyond the grave!

428
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,208
You will not escape me!

429
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:11,458
That's it...

430
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:13,125
That's what this
was all about.

431
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:19,583
Alright... What do you say
we have a go at this?

432
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:21,083
Right Now?

433
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:23,708
So between the five from
the revolt and the three monks,

434
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:26,291
which do you think is the
most likely culprit?

435
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:27,916
Honestly, I don't think
we have enough clues

436
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,291
to narrow it down for sure.

437
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,208
I guess we'll just hit them
both at the same time...

438
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,166
That came from
the hall...

439
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,083
Is there someone here?

440
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,250
Takigawa. The temperature
is dropping fast.

441
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,208
The dinosaur!

442
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:56,083
No... Listen carefully.

443
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:01,375
It's a sutra!

444
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:02,708
I don't know about you
guys but I'm convinced

445
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,583
the rokubu behind this...

446
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:07,125
I'm gonna go see if I
can tell what's going on.

447
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:09,166
Alright, I want you
girls to stay put.

448
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,791
John, you're
coming with me.

449
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:13,875
Please Be
careful you two!

450
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:18,875
Do you guys hear that?

451
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:35,916
The windows!

452
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:41,750
Rin pyo to sha kai
jin retsu zai zen!

453
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:46,500
Mai, remember they're
already dead,

454
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:47,958
so don't bother holding back!

455
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:52,416
Nao!

456
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,291
But... why would she be here?

457
00:22:57,625 --> 00:22:59,375
That's the
room Naru's in!

458
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:02,416
Rin pyo toh sha kai
jin retsu zai gyo!

459
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:07,708
But why him...? What
do they want with Naru?

460
00:23:07,791 --> 00:23:09,416
Do they want Naru ...

461
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,833
or they want to
release the spirit

462
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:12,625
that's possessing him...

463
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:14,458
Nao, please forgive me.

464
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,041
Rin! Pyo!

465
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:21,166
Whirlwind sickles!

466
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,166
They have us cornered
and outnumbered...

467
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,708
I don't think we can hold
them off for much longer!

468
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:37,250
Naru! Help us!

469
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:50,791
[Music]

470
00:23:50,875 --> 00:24:00,791
[Music]

471
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:10,833

[Music]

475
00:25:13,958 --> 00:25:16,291
Next time on Ghost
Hunt, the finale!

476
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:18,250
I just hope we live
to see the end!
