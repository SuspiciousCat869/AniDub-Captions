1
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,308
My name is Mai Taniyama,

2
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:28,685
and I'm a freshman
in high school

3
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:30,270
with a love for mystery

4
00:00:30,353 --> 00:00:33,231
and a knack for telling
spooky ghost stories...

5
00:00:33,314 --> 00:00:34,566
The other day I was
staying after class

6
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:36,151
with my friends
Keiko and Michiru

7
00:00:36,234 --> 00:00:38,028
to tell a couple
of ghost stories

8
00:00:38,111 --> 00:00:40,196
when all of a sudden
he showed up...

9
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,531
Kazuya Shibuya,

10
00:00:41,614 --> 00:00:43,241
the seventeen year
old ghost hunter!

11
00:00:43,324 --> 00:00:44,993
He's abrasive, humorless

12
00:00:45,076 --> 00:00:47,370
and most of all,
a narcissist!

13
00:00:47,454 --> 00:00:49,456
That's why I started
calling him Naru,

14
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:52,500
the gigantic ego
he carries around.

15
00:00:52,584 --> 00:00:55,670
Now the old schoolhouse nearby
is rumored to be haunted

16
00:00:55,754 --> 00:00:57,922
which is why Naru is
here investigating,

17
00:00:58,006 --> 00:01:00,842
but he's not the only one
who was called in for the job.

18
00:01:00,925 --> 00:01:03,219
There's also a shrine
maiden, a monk,

19
00:01:03,303 --> 00:01:06,222
an exorcist and a medium.

20
00:01:06,306 --> 00:01:07,724
Could the spirits here
really be strong enough

21
00:01:07,807 --> 00:01:09,392
to need so many people?

22
00:01:09,476 --> 00:01:10,810
Oh Yeah...

23
00:01:10,894 --> 00:01:13,063
One of my classmates,
who claims to be a psychic

24
00:01:13,146 --> 00:01:15,815
said the reason the spirits are
haunting the old schoolhouse

25
00:01:15,899 --> 00:01:18,818
is because my friends and I
have been telling ghost stories!

26
00:01:18,902 --> 00:01:20,320
What if that's
really true?

27
00:01:20,403 --> 00:01:22,864
Am I going to be held
responsible for this?

28
00:01:22,947 --> 00:01:24,407
I don't know what to do!

29
00:01:26,326 --> 00:01:32,082
[Music]

30
00:03:06,217 --> 00:03:09,137
I stand here today
to beseech the gods.

31
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,556
I call upon them to
descend from the heavens

32
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:13,850
and join us
where no gods dwell

33
00:03:13,933 --> 00:03:16,102
to end this
ceaseless suffering.

34
00:03:16,186 --> 00:03:18,563
I ask that my humble
plea may be heard

35
00:03:18,646 --> 00:03:20,565
to reclaim peace
unto the spirits

36
00:03:20,648 --> 00:03:22,609
trapped in this
haunted place.

37
00:03:23,943 --> 00:03:25,111
What's she doing?

38
00:03:25,195 --> 00:03:26,863
Have you never
heard of norito?

39
00:03:26,946 --> 00:03:28,948
No what's that?

40
00:03:29,032 --> 00:03:32,202
They're just
Shinto incantations...

41
00:03:32,285 --> 00:03:35,872
But I'm starting to wonder
if she can even pull this off.

42
00:03:35,955 --> 00:03:39,626
I've never seen anyone perform
a Shinto exorcism before...

43
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:40,835
Let's watch...

44
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,051
May this place be as the
high, heavenly plain...

45
00:03:48,134 --> 00:03:50,887
May the energy from all
living beings act as one,

46
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:53,515
and hail Marishiten,
the goddess of light.

47
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:57,519
I pray to thee, descend and
grant us thy divine protection.

48
00:04:00,563 --> 00:04:01,815
That's it...

49
00:04:01,898 --> 00:04:04,526
Now you'll have
nothing to worry about.

50
00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:07,487
I have to say I'm
quite impressed.

51
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,406
It was presented
beautifully.

52
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:10,907
Thank you so much.

53
00:04:12,075 --> 00:04:14,661
What would you say to a
party tonight, in your honor?

54
00:04:14,744 --> 00:04:16,955
I can't. I must stay here
for the next twelve hours

55
00:04:17,038 --> 00:04:18,248
to keep an eye on things.

56
00:04:18,331 --> 00:04:19,624
Of course, I understand.

57
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:21,209
You're a true
professional...

58
00:04:21,292 --> 00:04:23,169
Maybe we can meet up
for lunch sometime.

59
00:04:25,797 --> 00:04:27,132
She's finally done.

60
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,358
Hey... Are you alright?

61
00:04:46,609 --> 00:04:48,111
This man is bleeding!

62
00:04:48,194 --> 00:04:49,404
Oh no...

63
00:04:49,487 --> 00:04:50,947
Looks like he is too.

64
00:04:51,031 --> 00:04:53,158
-What about you Ayako?
-I'm alright.

65
00:04:53,241 --> 00:04:55,160
-You okay sir?
-Yes, I'll be fine.

66
00:04:55,243 --> 00:04:55,952
Can you stand?

67
00:04:56,036 --> 00:04:57,579
What is going on here?

68
00:05:05,628 --> 00:05:08,715
I thought you said there would
be nothing to worry about now.

69
00:05:08,798 --> 00:05:11,259
Looks like your little
exorcism didn't work...

70
00:05:11,343 --> 00:05:13,720
Your failure just sent the
principal to the hospital.

71
00:05:15,597 --> 00:05:18,016
-That was a simple accident.
-Thank you.

72
00:05:18,099 --> 00:05:19,726
I thought I did
my job very well.

73
00:05:19,809 --> 00:05:21,770
But I'm not saying
your exorcism worked.

74
00:05:21,853 --> 00:05:23,229
It couldn't have

75
00:05:23,313 --> 00:05:24,773
because there were no
spirits here to begin with.

76
00:05:24,856 --> 00:05:26,149
Yes there are...!

77
00:05:26,232 --> 00:05:28,777
I was nearly killed by
one of them earlier today.

78
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,447
Maybe it was a coincidence.

79
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:33,907
Or there's
something here...

80
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:37,118
Something too strong
for Ayako to drive away.

81
00:05:37,202 --> 00:05:38,328
If that were the case

82
00:05:38,411 --> 00:05:39,829
then there would be
more conclusive readings

83
00:05:39,913 --> 00:05:41,206
on my equipment.

84
00:05:43,124 --> 00:05:46,086
I wish I could sense
some of these spirits...

85
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:48,254
I mean if I'm the one
who brought them here,

86
00:05:48,338 --> 00:05:50,632
I'd also like to be the
one to drive them out.

87
00:05:52,133 --> 00:05:54,260
Hey, that room
didn't have a chair

88
00:05:54,344 --> 00:05:56,680
in the middle of it
yesterday, did it?

89
00:05:56,763 --> 00:05:58,932
That's one of the classrooms
on the second floor.

90
00:05:59,557 --> 00:06:00,642
Mmm hmm...

91
00:06:00,725 --> 00:06:02,102
I set the camera up
in there yesterday

92
00:06:02,185 --> 00:06:03,812
just like you told me to ...

93
00:06:03,895 --> 00:06:05,939
I swear... It wasn't there.

94
00:06:06,022 --> 00:06:07,315
Hosho...

95
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:09,734
Have you seen anyone go
inside that classroom?

96
00:06:09,818 --> 00:06:10,777
No.

97
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,945
Me neither.

98
00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:20,078
Maybe we can meet up
for lunch sometime.

99
00:06:33,883 --> 00:06:35,593
Was that a ghost?

100
00:06:35,677 --> 00:06:37,804
It looks to me
like a poltergeist.

101
00:06:37,887 --> 00:06:39,597
A poltergeist?

102
00:06:39,681 --> 00:06:41,683
It's a German word dating
back four centuries

103
00:06:41,766 --> 00:06:43,309
that means noisy ghost...

104
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:45,770
They are manifestations

105
00:06:45,854 --> 00:06:48,690
that can influence
and move objects at will.

106
00:06:48,773 --> 00:06:50,025
That is correct...

107
00:06:50,108 --> 00:06:52,318
But I don't think that's
what we're dealing with...

108
00:06:52,402 --> 00:06:54,863
Quite often objects that are
manipulated by a poltergeist

109
00:06:54,946 --> 00:06:56,573
will feel warm to the touch.

110
00:06:58,033 --> 00:06:59,659
If we look at our
thermographic image,

111
00:06:59,743 --> 00:07:02,078
we can see the chair
is not radiating heat.

112
00:07:02,162 --> 00:07:04,080
But don't forget
Tisane's criteria.

113
00:07:04,164 --> 00:07:05,623
Who's that?

114
00:07:05,707 --> 00:07:06,916
E. Tisane...

115
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,335
He was a French policeman

116
00:07:08,418 --> 00:07:11,004
who was the first one to
classify poltergeists...

117
00:07:11,087 --> 00:07:12,464
Throwing objects...

118
00:07:12,547 --> 00:07:13,548
strange noises...

119
00:07:13,631 --> 00:07:14,799
fires...

120
00:07:14,883 --> 00:07:17,635
doors closing by
themselves and so on.

121
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:19,471
There are nine different
criteria in all,

122
00:07:19,554 --> 00:07:22,807
and so far we've seen a
number of them at this site.

123
00:07:22,891 --> 00:07:24,392
We have doors closing
on their own...

124
00:07:24,476 --> 00:07:25,935
inanimate objects moving...

125
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:27,312
and glass breaking,

126
00:07:27,395 --> 00:07:29,314
which makes up three
of the nine criteria.

127
00:07:29,397 --> 00:07:31,816
But... what about Kuroda
getting attacked?

128
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,777
I'm afraid it was just
her imagination...

129
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,154
Stop playing
games with me...

130
00:07:36,237 --> 00:07:38,239
Why can't you admit that
this place is haunted?

131
00:07:41,034 --> 00:07:42,077
Alright then...

132
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,828
I'll try once more...

133
00:07:43,912 --> 00:07:45,038
I will sense them...

134
00:07:45,121 --> 00:07:47,040
if there are any
spirits here.

135
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,710
If we truly are dealing
with a spirit here...

136
00:07:50,794 --> 00:07:52,504
and Masako can't sense it,

137
00:07:52,587 --> 00:07:54,631
that would be quite a shock.

138
00:07:54,714 --> 00:07:56,925
There's no evidence
suggesting there is one.

139
00:07:57,008 --> 00:07:58,426
Why is he sticking
up for her...

140
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,095
Oh I get it.

141
00:08:00,178 --> 00:08:02,389
Even Naru's a sucker
for a pretty face.

142
00:08:02,472 --> 00:08:05,141
You're just a sucker
for a pretty face.

143
00:08:05,225 --> 00:08:06,893
Why else would you be
sticking up for her?

144
00:08:06,976 --> 00:08:08,061
Woah!

145
00:08:08,144 --> 00:08:10,772
I didn't say that
out loud, did I?

146
00:08:10,855 --> 00:08:13,191
I'm quite familiar with
Miss Hara's work...

147
00:08:13,274 --> 00:08:15,985
I firmly believe she's one
of the best in her field...

148
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:19,030
All I'm doing is giving her
the respect she deserves.

149
00:08:19,114 --> 00:08:20,532
I'm much more
talented than she is

150
00:08:20,615 --> 00:08:22,701
and I'm not getting nearly
that level of respect.

151
00:08:23,743 --> 00:08:25,954
What is it about you that I
should hold in such high regard

152
00:08:26,037 --> 00:08:27,664
because I'm
drawing a blank?

153
00:08:27,747 --> 00:08:29,207
What did you just say?!

154
00:08:33,378 --> 00:08:34,921
Creaking noises.

155
00:08:35,005 --> 00:08:36,923
Don't ghosts make
sounds like that?

156
00:08:42,637 --> 00:08:43,847
It's Masako!

157
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,390
Someone call an ambulance!

158
00:08:48,268 --> 00:08:50,395
The portion of the eastern wall
that had been demolished

159
00:08:50,478 --> 00:08:52,105
was boarded up
with weak plywood

160
00:08:52,188 --> 00:08:54,524
and was by no means
structurally sound.

161
00:08:54,607 --> 00:08:55,775
She must have leaned on it,

162
00:08:55,859 --> 00:08:57,902
causing it to break
underneath her weight.

163
00:08:57,986 --> 00:09:00,238
Miss Hara herself said
it was an accident.

164
00:09:02,574 --> 00:09:04,242
I was just being careless.

165
00:09:04,325 --> 00:09:06,536
There are no
spirits inside...

166
00:09:06,619 --> 00:09:07,912
We can't deny
it anymore...

167
00:09:07,996 --> 00:09:10,457
There's obviously
a force here.

168
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:13,918
Oh... Are you referring to the
one you failed to exorcise?

169
00:09:15,253 --> 00:09:17,047
We're playing with fire...

170
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,965
An unsuccessfully
exorcised spirit

171
00:09:19,049 --> 00:09:20,467
is like a wounded bear.

172
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:23,386
So... what happened to
Masako was Ayako's fault.

173
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:24,471
Oh please.

174
00:09:24,554 --> 00:09:26,473
Listen! From what
I saw on the video

175
00:09:26,556 --> 00:09:27,849
it was just an accident.

176
00:09:29,184 --> 00:09:31,353
But accidents keep
happening here,

177
00:09:31,436 --> 00:09:33,063
that's why they say
this place is haunted.

178
00:09:33,146 --> 00:09:34,939
That may be true...

179
00:09:35,023 --> 00:09:37,359
but there are simply not
enough readings on the equipment

180
00:09:37,442 --> 00:09:38,568
to prove it.

181
00:09:38,651 --> 00:09:40,570
There aren't any
temperature fluctuations.

182
00:09:40,653 --> 00:09:44,407
No ionic polarization and
the EMF readings are normal.

183
00:09:44,491 --> 00:09:46,201
The proof just
isn't there.

184
00:09:46,284 --> 00:09:48,912
But... Ayako was
trapped in that room...

185
00:09:48,995 --> 00:09:51,122
and I was attacked
upstairs...

186
00:09:51,206 --> 00:09:53,416
Something also moved the
chair, broke the glass,

187
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,834
and erased the video!

188
00:09:54,918 --> 00:09:57,420
Like I said I'm
still not convinced.

189
00:09:57,504 --> 00:09:59,798
Maybe we're dealing with a
highly intelligent spirit

190
00:09:59,881 --> 00:10:01,841
that knows how to hide
from your machines.

191
00:10:05,887 --> 00:10:08,223
What do you really think?

192
00:10:08,306 --> 00:10:10,475
I still believe it's
a residual haunting.

193
00:10:10,558 --> 00:10:11,976
And you... John?

194
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,145
Well I'm not sure...

195
00:10:14,229 --> 00:10:16,981
Though I do agree it's
become quite dangerous here.

196
00:10:17,065 --> 00:10:19,192
Now... Tell us what
you're thinking.

197
00:10:19,275 --> 00:10:21,861
I'll hold off on my
opinion for now...

198
00:10:21,945 --> 00:10:23,279
I'd like to
investigate this

199
00:10:23,363 --> 00:10:25,156
from a slightly
different angle.

200
00:10:27,617 --> 00:10:30,328
So what do you think
about this guy...?

201
00:10:30,412 --> 00:10:32,539
He knows how to put on a
show with all this equipment

202
00:10:32,622 --> 00:10:35,333
but I'm not convinced the boy
wonder knows what he's doing.

203
00:10:37,544 --> 00:10:38,795
Best get started then.

204
00:10:50,724 --> 00:10:53,768
The teenage exorcist finally
makes his appearance.

205
00:10:55,353 --> 00:10:58,356
Our father,
who art in heaven...

206
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,942
Hallowed be thy name.

207
00:11:01,026 --> 00:11:02,861
Is that... water?

208
00:11:02,944 --> 00:11:04,029
Holy water.

209
00:11:05,572 --> 00:11:07,157
In the beginning...

210
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,869
was the Word and the
Word was with God...

211
00:11:10,952 --> 00:11:12,620
and the Word it was God.

212
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:19,961
-What...
-More strange noises.

213
00:11:20,045 --> 00:11:21,504
Wait... Turn up the volume.

214
00:11:22,213 --> 00:11:24,049
He was with God
in the beginning.

215
00:11:26,217 --> 00:11:28,345
Through him all
things were made.

216
00:11:28,428 --> 00:11:30,930
Without him nothing was
made that has been made.

217
00:11:31,014 --> 00:11:33,683
In him was life...

218
00:11:33,767 --> 00:11:35,352
And that life was...

219
00:11:35,435 --> 00:11:37,145
the light of all men...

220
00:11:37,228 --> 00:11:39,147
The light shines
in the darkness...

221
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,816
but the darkness has
not understood it.

222
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,860
There came a man who
was sent from God;

223
00:11:43,943 --> 00:11:46,071
his name was John.

224
00:11:46,154 --> 00:11:48,573
The ceiling.

225
00:11:48,656 --> 00:11:51,034
so that through him
all men might believe.

226
00:11:51,117 --> 00:11:53,036
Hey! Where you going?!

227
00:11:53,119 --> 00:11:55,538
I hope I can get
there in time!

228
00:11:55,622 --> 00:11:56,748
He was in the world,

229
00:11:56,831 --> 00:11:58,708
and though the world
was made through him,

230
00:11:58,792 --> 00:12:00,960
the world did
not recognize him.

231
00:12:01,044 --> 00:12:02,212
Look out!

232
00:12:02,295 --> 00:12:03,254
Mai?

233
00:12:03,338 --> 00:12:05,340
Move it...! The
ceiling's falling!

234
00:12:06,966 --> 00:12:08,176
John!

235
00:12:09,344 --> 00:12:10,804
JOHN!!!

236
00:12:16,351 --> 00:12:18,061
I don't believe this.

237
00:12:18,144 --> 00:12:20,188
If Mai had not
acted so quickly,

238
00:12:20,271 --> 00:12:22,565
I could have easily been
injured or even killed.

239
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:23,775
In the interest of safety,

240
00:12:23,858 --> 00:12:26,069
I think we should
call it for the night.

241
00:12:26,152 --> 00:12:28,071
Mai. You're dismissed.

242
00:12:28,154 --> 00:12:29,197
Really?

243
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,281
Yes.

244
00:12:30,365 --> 00:12:31,449
Alright...

245
00:12:31,533 --> 00:12:33,660
I guess I'll be back
bright and early...

246
00:12:33,743 --> 00:12:35,829
While there's still life,
there's still hope.

247
00:12:35,912 --> 00:12:38,039
Just admit it and
say you're scared.

248
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:47,048
Well, seeing as I nearly
lost my head a minute ago,

249
00:12:47,132 --> 00:12:49,175
I think I'll take your advice
and retire for the evening.

250
00:12:50,218 --> 00:12:52,429
-You leaving?
-Not yet.

251
00:12:52,512 --> 00:12:54,180
There are a few more things
I want to investigate...

252
00:12:54,264 --> 00:12:56,391
Well... just try to
be careful, okay?

253
00:13:15,452 --> 00:13:16,786
Naru...

254
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,788
Did you sleep here
last night...?

255
00:13:18,872 --> 00:13:20,165
That can't be good for you.

256
00:13:22,542 --> 00:13:24,002
Hey Mai...

257
00:13:24,085 --> 00:13:25,837
What are you doing
here at this hour?

258
00:13:29,466 --> 00:13:30,467
Man.

259
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,843
He's barely gotten
a wink of sleep

260
00:13:31,926 --> 00:13:33,636
and he's still gorgeous!

261
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,430
At this hour...?

262
00:13:35,513 --> 00:13:37,390
It's almost time
for lunch, Naru...

263
00:13:37,474 --> 00:13:38,850
Morning...!

264
00:13:38,933 --> 00:13:40,727
It looks like someone
had a rough night.

265
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:41,978
It looks to me...

266
00:13:42,062 --> 00:13:43,980
like someone's trying
to leave early.

267
00:13:44,064 --> 00:13:45,357
You're right.

268
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,150
So you're finally
admitting your expert opinion

269
00:13:47,233 --> 00:13:48,401
was totally wrong...

270
00:13:48,485 --> 00:13:49,944
It that true?

271
00:13:50,028 --> 00:13:52,864
No... I'm leaving because I
already solved the case.

272
00:13:52,947 --> 00:13:54,240
Huh?

273
00:13:54,324 --> 00:13:56,785
So you cleaned that
schoolhouse... by yourself?

274
00:13:56,868 --> 00:13:58,787
No, I didn't do that.

275
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:59,996
There was no need to.

276
00:14:01,081 --> 00:14:02,540
What are you talking about?

277
00:14:02,624 --> 00:14:04,209
What did you do?

278
00:14:04,292 --> 00:14:05,377
Last night...

279
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,421
I compiled all of
my experiments.

280
00:14:08,505 --> 00:14:10,215
These are some
surveying results.

281
00:14:11,216 --> 00:14:13,343
The schoolhouse is sinking.

282
00:14:13,426 --> 00:14:15,929
In fact, it sank point two
inches just last night.

283
00:14:16,012 --> 00:14:17,472
It what?

284
00:14:17,555 --> 00:14:18,932
It's called subsidence.

285
00:14:19,015 --> 00:14:20,392
Yeah, so what...?

286
00:14:20,475 --> 00:14:22,018
You think subsidence
is to blame

287
00:14:22,102 --> 00:14:24,104
for the phenomena
we experienced?

288
00:14:24,187 --> 00:14:27,816
This entire area is built
upon reclaimed swampland.

289
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:29,651
When I looked into the
distribution of wells

290
00:14:29,734 --> 00:14:30,819
that were once in use,

291
00:14:30,902 --> 00:14:32,487
I discovered a large aquifer

292
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,739
that passed underneath
the schoolhouse...

293
00:14:34,823 --> 00:14:37,367
But when I checked the wells
that are in the immediate area,

294
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:38,743
I found them all to be dry.

295
00:14:38,827 --> 00:14:40,161
Which means...?

296
00:14:40,245 --> 00:14:41,871
The soil here was
weak to begin with,

297
00:14:41,955 --> 00:14:43,415
and since the water
has dried up,

298
00:14:43,498 --> 00:14:45,750
there's a hollowing effect
happening underground.

299
00:14:45,834 --> 00:14:47,460
So naturally, the
structure built above

300
00:14:47,544 --> 00:14:49,170
it would be sinking.

301
00:14:49,254 --> 00:14:50,839
So you're saying...

302
00:14:50,922 --> 00:14:53,883
the glass, the chair moving
and the ceiling collapsing...

303
00:14:53,967 --> 00:14:55,844
are all due to subsidence?

304
00:14:55,927 --> 00:14:57,595
Yes... The floor
in the classroom

305
00:14:57,679 --> 00:14:58,930
on the eastern side
of the building

306
00:14:59,014 --> 00:15:00,265
where the ceiling collapsed,

307
00:15:00,348 --> 00:15:02,684
was three inches lower
than on the west side.

308
00:15:02,767 --> 00:15:04,227
Three inches?

309
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:06,855
Sounds like structural
failure to me.

310
00:15:06,938 --> 00:15:09,024
But what about the
strange noises?

311
00:15:09,107 --> 00:15:11,109
Probably the sound
of the wood shifting.

312
00:15:12,193 --> 00:15:14,738
We should have the surrounding
area declared off-limits.

313
00:15:16,531 --> 00:15:17,991
It's so structurally unsound

314
00:15:18,074 --> 00:15:19,701
it might come
down any day now.

315
00:15:23,663 --> 00:15:25,248
I knew it...!

316
00:15:25,331 --> 00:15:27,500
You can't explain what
attacked me, can you?

317
00:15:29,044 --> 00:15:30,795
If what you claim
really did occur,

318
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:32,672
then perhaps it's the work
of a floating specter

319
00:15:32,756 --> 00:15:34,966
that's following you.

320
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,509
Just listen...

321
00:15:36,593 --> 00:15:38,345
I'm not making this up!

322
00:15:38,428 --> 00:15:40,805
Are you really leaving...?

323
00:15:40,889 --> 00:15:42,432
-Well?
-Yes.

324
00:15:42,515 --> 00:15:43,975
The job's done.

325
00:15:44,059 --> 00:15:45,685
Right...

326
00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:47,896
I guess it is, huh...

327
00:15:47,979 --> 00:15:49,606
It's weird.

328
00:15:49,689 --> 00:15:51,983
I get the feeling like
we're not done here yet.

329
00:15:54,527 --> 00:15:55,987
There is a spirit here...

330
00:15:56,071 --> 00:15:57,697
I know it.

331
00:15:57,781 --> 00:15:59,074
You're wrong...

332
00:15:59,157 --> 00:16:01,159
I have scientific evidence
to back up my claims.

333
00:16:01,242 --> 00:16:02,369
Did you ever consider

334
00:16:02,452 --> 00:16:04,829
that maybe the spirit is
avoiding your tests?

335
00:16:04,913 --> 00:16:07,040
Then exorcise it yourself...

336
00:16:07,123 --> 00:16:09,292
That should be easy for
someone with your skills.

337
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,712
There's nothing more for
me to investigate here,

338
00:16:12,796 --> 00:16:14,214
so I'm leaving.

339
00:16:14,297 --> 00:16:15,340
End of story.

340
00:16:22,138 --> 00:16:23,348
Oh well...

341
00:16:23,431 --> 00:16:25,183
I guess my
dream's over now.

342
00:16:26,893 --> 00:16:29,729
I mean here we are in an old
building that's so creepy

343
00:16:29,813 --> 00:16:31,648
you'd just assume
it was haunted,

344
00:16:31,731 --> 00:16:34,609
not to mention all the ghost
stories I've heard about it...

345
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:37,445
It's kind of,
romantic in a way.

346
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:39,698
Now I don't like the idea
of people dying here...

347
00:16:39,781 --> 00:16:41,241
but the ghost stories
really gave this place

348
00:16:41,324 --> 00:16:43,743
a sense of mystery and fun...

349
00:16:43,827 --> 00:16:44,911
Maybe so.

350
00:16:52,752 --> 00:16:53,795
Kuroda!

351
00:17:00,051 --> 00:17:01,219
What's going on?

352
00:17:01,302 --> 00:17:02,721
Well it's more than
just the place sinking.

353
00:17:02,804 --> 00:17:04,139
Knocking sounds...

354
00:17:04,222 --> 00:17:06,307
That's another one
of Tisane's criteria!

355
00:17:06,391 --> 00:17:07,475
Well?!

356
00:17:08,476 --> 00:17:09,644
Naru?

357
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,943
We need to get
out of here, now!

358
00:17:17,027 --> 00:17:18,069
This is it...!

359
00:17:18,153 --> 00:17:20,655
Everybody out...! Go Mai!

360
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:21,990
But what about the doors?!

361
00:17:22,073 --> 00:17:23,241
Leave that to me!

362
00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:26,161
Over here! This way!

363
00:17:30,248 --> 00:17:31,833
Are you okay, Kuroda?

364
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:33,043
You're bleeding.

365
00:17:33,126 --> 00:17:34,544
Let me see your hand.

366
00:17:34,627 --> 00:17:35,837
It's okay...

367
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,380
Cut's not too deep.

368
00:17:38,631 --> 00:17:40,008
What was that...?

369
00:17:40,091 --> 00:17:42,260
And don't try to feed me
that sinking theory again...

370
00:17:42,344 --> 00:17:44,512
That was a full on
poltergeist, wasn't it?

371
00:17:45,847 --> 00:17:48,933
That sound wasn't just the
creaking of an old building.

372
00:17:49,017 --> 00:17:51,436
Something was definitely
banging on the walls.

373
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:52,771
That means we've
already witnessed

374
00:17:52,854 --> 00:17:54,689
four of the nine criteria

375
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:56,232
that were laid
out by Tisane.

376
00:17:56,316 --> 00:17:57,525
It just goes to show

377
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:00,111
that you can't depend too
much on technology...

378
00:18:00,195 --> 00:18:01,946
For a minute there I was
actually about to believe

379
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,615
you and your phony results.

380
00:18:03,698 --> 00:18:05,325
Stick around Naru

381
00:18:05,408 --> 00:18:07,869
and you'll see how the true
professionals do things.

382
00:18:07,952 --> 00:18:10,413
Maybe it's time someone
went back to school.

383
00:18:11,998 --> 00:18:13,333
What's with them...?

384
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:15,627
I haven't seen them do
anything productive.

385
00:18:18,713 --> 00:18:20,632
Your hand... It's...

386
00:18:20,715 --> 00:18:22,801
It's nothing serious...

387
00:18:22,884 --> 00:18:24,219
It's just a scratch.

388
00:18:24,302 --> 00:18:25,387
But...

389
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:26,971
I will be fine...

390
00:18:27,055 --> 00:18:28,932
You should just
tend to Kuroda.

391
00:18:29,015 --> 00:18:29,641
But Naru...

392
00:18:29,724 --> 00:18:31,226
I'd appreciate it

393
00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:33,436
if you left me alone
for a little while.

394
00:18:35,063 --> 00:18:38,775
I'm so mad at myself
I could throw up...

395
00:18:38,858 --> 00:18:39,984
Fine.

396
00:18:53,164 --> 00:18:54,541
You're not going to
watch the monk's attempt

397
00:18:54,624 --> 00:18:55,625
with the rest of us?

398
00:18:55,709 --> 00:18:57,252
No! I'm not!

399
00:18:58,586 --> 00:18:59,838
Hey, what's up, Mai?

400
00:19:01,423 --> 00:19:03,133
Do you mind if I
give you a hand?

401
00:19:03,216 --> 00:19:04,259
Oh, I'm okay.

402
00:19:04,342 --> 00:19:06,344
I'm just taking
a few things out.

403
00:19:06,428 --> 00:19:08,638
Then please, allow me
to help you. I insist.

404
00:19:08,722 --> 00:19:11,349
Really. I'd rather
do it myself.

405
00:19:11,433 --> 00:19:14,019
Are you still buying
your boss's explanation?

406
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:17,564
Do you have any proof
that he's wrong...?

407
00:19:17,647 --> 00:19:18,732
If so, then let's hear it!

408
00:19:18,815 --> 00:19:20,400
I'm all ears over here!

409
00:19:23,445 --> 00:19:24,946
Easy now.

410
00:19:27,532 --> 00:19:31,077
On sunba nisunba un
bazaar un hatta...

411
00:19:31,161 --> 00:19:33,371
Jaku un ban koku.

412
00:19:33,455 --> 00:19:35,040
On dakini shara kyara
heigi yaya chigi yaya nei

413
00:19:35,123 --> 00:19:36,791
How in the world is
chanting that gibberish

414
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:40,170
supposed to get rid
of evil spirits?

415
00:19:40,253 --> 00:19:42,297
Geez, Naru. Stop pouting
and get back here

416
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,424
so you can tell these
idiots what's up...

417
00:19:44,507 --> 00:19:46,051
I don't know if I can
take much more of this!

418
00:19:48,345 --> 00:19:51,014
I just set the microphone
up on the second floor.

419
00:19:51,097 --> 00:19:52,390
Thank you...

420
00:19:52,474 --> 00:19:54,642
But you know I can do
this stuff myself, right?

421
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:56,436
Oh no worries mate...

422
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:57,687
Anyway, I'm going
to look around a bit

423
00:19:57,771 --> 00:19:59,314
and see if I can't
find some more clues.

424
00:19:59,397 --> 00:20:00,940
Oh... well be careful.

425
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:03,902
I think I've made
the right decision

426
00:20:03,985 --> 00:20:05,945
to wait here for Naru...

427
00:20:06,029 --> 00:20:07,989
but should I even
expect him to come back?

428
00:20:11,326 --> 00:20:12,994
Naru!

429
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:14,412
Oh hi Kuroda.

430
00:20:14,496 --> 00:20:15,455
Any news?

431
00:20:15,538 --> 00:20:16,998
Uh... Right...

432
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:19,084
The monk and the others are
making their rounds right now.

433
00:20:19,167 --> 00:20:20,710
What about Kazuya?

434
00:20:20,794 --> 00:20:22,045
I don't know where he is...

435
00:20:22,128 --> 00:20:23,838
Aww man...

436
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:25,715
are there really
any spirits here?

437
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:27,634
Yes, I saw them.

438
00:20:27,717 --> 00:20:29,511
Oh... I know...

439
00:20:29,594 --> 00:20:31,221
You've made that clear.

440
00:20:31,304 --> 00:20:33,807
They're not here anymore.

441
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:36,017
The expulsion was a success.

442
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:38,144
Yeah we've all heard
that one before.

443
00:20:38,228 --> 00:20:40,063
Well, this time
I'm sure of it.

444
00:20:40,146 --> 00:20:42,691
They're still here.

445
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:44,192
I can feel them...

446
00:20:44,275 --> 00:20:46,945
In fact there are many
spirits trapped here.

447
00:20:47,028 --> 00:20:49,614
Are you still pretending...?

448
00:20:49,698 --> 00:20:51,074
Give it a rest...

449
00:20:51,157 --> 00:20:52,659
We're the
professionals here.

450
00:20:52,742 --> 00:20:55,453
Unless I'm mistaken you
haven't done anything.

451
00:20:55,537 --> 00:20:57,288
We're good now.

452
00:20:57,372 --> 00:20:59,666
Ayako's effort may have
been a complete failure

453
00:20:59,749 --> 00:21:00,750
but mine wasn't.

454
00:21:00,834 --> 00:21:02,168
Excuse me?

455
00:21:02,252 --> 00:21:04,421
Well, it is true, isn't it?

456
00:21:04,504 --> 00:21:06,548
Don't take credit
for my work!

457
00:21:06,631 --> 00:21:07,632
Same to you.

458
00:21:07,716 --> 00:21:09,718
Get over yourself!

459
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:11,136
Would you shut up?!

460
00:21:12,595 --> 00:21:13,555
I hear something.

461
00:21:16,016 --> 00:21:17,559
Someone's here.

462
00:21:17,642 --> 00:21:18,768
I know.

463
00:21:26,735 --> 00:21:27,986
Are you nuts?!

464
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:34,576
Do you see anybody?!

465
00:21:34,659 --> 00:21:35,827
Nope.

466
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,412
We must have imagined it.

467
00:21:37,495 --> 00:21:38,955
That's crazy...!

468
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,248
All of us...?

469
00:21:40,331 --> 00:21:42,167
I definitely
heard something!

470
00:21:44,127 --> 00:21:45,712
You heard it too,
right Monk?

471
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:49,174
It was just the wind.

472
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:51,718
I am sick of this...!

473
00:21:51,801 --> 00:21:53,887
You didn't get rid of
them either, did you?

474
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:55,180
After what you said to Naru,

475
00:21:55,263 --> 00:21:57,599
this makes you
look so stupid!

476
00:21:57,682 --> 00:22:01,603
I don't remember Naru coming up
with any lame excuses, do you?

477
00:22:01,686 --> 00:22:04,356
Funny how the adults are
acting like children!

478
00:22:04,439 --> 00:22:05,148
It's back!

479
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:11,154
This is the most
activity we've seen yet!

480
00:22:11,237 --> 00:22:13,490
It sounds like
there's more than one!

481
00:22:13,573 --> 00:22:14,699
It's too dangerous in here.

482
00:22:14,783 --> 00:22:15,742
Let's get outside.

483
00:22:15,825 --> 00:22:16,951
I'm right behind you...!

484
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:18,203
Come on Kuroda...

485
00:22:18,286 --> 00:22:19,329
Follow me!

486
00:22:19,412 --> 00:22:20,330
Right!

487
00:22:27,671 --> 00:22:28,797
Mai!

488
00:22:30,298 --> 00:22:31,508
