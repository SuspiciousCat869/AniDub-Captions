1
00:00:11,791 --> 00:00:13,958
My name is Akifumi Yoshimi...

2
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:15,958
and this is my
niece Hazuki...

3
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:17,625
She's the one I was
telling you about.

4
00:00:17,708 --> 00:00:18,958
Take a look at this.

5
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:26,291
At first this
was all we saw.

6
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:27,875
We assumed it was
some kind of rash

7
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:29,375
and took her to
the hospital...

8
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:30,375
But...

9
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,333
-My god!
-a kaimyo.

10
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:40,208
It sure is.

11
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:43,583
Wait... Isn't that another
name for the dead?

12
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:46,541
Zengetsuin
rakugoku dounyo.

13
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:49,666
This foolish child is doomed
to spend an eternity in...

14
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:50,708
Hell.

15
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:52,291
"In Hell?"

16
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:54,958
Only someone with a serious
grudge could do this.

17
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:57,500
This was the beginning

18
00:00:57,583 --> 00:01:00,000
of one of our most
shocking cases.

19
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:07,000
[Music]

20
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:56,416
My name is Taizo Yoshimi...

21
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,375
and this is my wife Hiroe.

22
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:01,041
Thank you all so
much for coming.

23
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:02,916
Welcome.

24
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,208
First of all... let me
say that we're very sorry

25
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:07,583
to call you all the
way out here for this.

26
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,333
Oh... don't
worry about it.

27
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:10,875
It's Our pleasure.

28
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,083
Now if you
wouldn't mind...

29
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:16,083
I'd very much like to go over
the details of the case.

30
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,625
Yes. Of course...

31
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,666
Well, I'm afraid that
there is a bit of a curse

32
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,250
on the Yoshimi family...

33
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,583
Whenever there is a new
head of the family,

34
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,375
strange things
seem to happen.

35
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:26,875
Thirty two years ago...

36
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,791
when my grandfather
passed away

37
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,916
eight family members
soon followed.

38
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,583
When he first took
over the land,

39
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:35,041
five of my mother's
siblings died.

40
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:37,833
She was the only
one who survived.

41
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:39,375
Then my father died...

42
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:40,625
and almost immediately

43
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:43,041
those horrifying marks
appeared on Hazuki.

44
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,666
If his spirit caused this...

45
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,041
it's like he wants to behead
his own granddaughter

46
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:51,625
from beyond the grave.

47
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,375
Let's see if I
got them all.

48
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:10,875
That's Hazuki's
father, Kazuyasu.

49
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,791
He's the oldest son...

50
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:16,083
Next to him is the second
oldest Yashitaka...

51
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:17,916
Then there's Eijiro.

52
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,916
He's the husband of the
oldest daughter Teruka...

53
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,416
That's Kazuyasu's
wife Yoko...

54
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,250
and the second
oldest daughter Nao

55
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:28,541
who is just a bit older
than her brother Akifumi.

56
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:29,541
That's it...

57
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:30,708
I've got them all...

58
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,541
Sure is quiet though...

59
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,666
Nobody's said a word
all through dinner.

60
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,458
What are these people
doing here anyway?!

61
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:45,291
And why aren't you telling
them the whole story?

62
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:47,625
Please... not in front
of the guests, Eijiro.

63
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,291
It's for their
own safety...

64
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:52,125
It's irresponsible
not to tell them!

65
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,291
The family members
weren't the only ones

66
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,541
who died thirty-two years ago.

67
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,125
What do you mean?

68
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,125
I think we should tell
them the whole story, dear.

69
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:08,625
Taizo...

70
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:09,875
I know...

71
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:11,291
These people are
our last hope,

72
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:13,375
and this may make
them want to leave...

73
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,000
That's true...

74
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,500
but they have a
right to know...

75
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,416
There's more
to the story...

76
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,958
What we haven't
told you is that

77
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:25,041
three people outside of
the family died as well.

78
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:28,000
All three of them were
spiritualists, like you.

79
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:31,916
I see.

80
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,541
Don't worry. We're not gonna
let that scare us off.

81
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:40,250
Besides I really want to see
what we're up against here.

82
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,916
Thank you so much.

83
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,583
We've had consultations
with other investigators...

84
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:45,958
But when they found
out the whole truth

85
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:47,791
they didn't want
any part of it.

86
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,833
That explains why you went
all the way to Tokyo.

87
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,458
He had to.

88
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:54,916
I'm sorry about what
happened over dinner.

89
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,666
My brother Eijiro is not
usually like that...

90
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,000
actually...

91
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:01,541
I've never seen him
behave that way before.

92
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:02,916
Hold on...

93
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,333
You're saying it's
unusual for him

94
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:06,791
to behave so coarsely
in front of the guests?

95
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:09,375
Yeah... After all we
do run a hotel here.

96
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,125
What about Kazuyasu?

97
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,750
Kazuyasu's been...

98
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:16,208
well, he's been on
edge a bit lately...

99
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:18,333
For that matter
so has Yashi...

100
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,833
Since the funeral, they've
both had a pretty hard time.

101
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,125
I can understand...

102
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:24,041
I'm sure they have a
lot on their minds.

103
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:26,833
What about everyone else...?

104
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:29,083
Or has anything
strange happened?

105
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:30,666
Yeah, there was something
that was strange...

106
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,208
After grandfather's funeral

107
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,166
three of our dogs just
suddenly went missing

108
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,791
and then a few days
later we found them.

109
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:39,000
Their bodies had
washed up on the beach.

110
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,333
Yoko hasn't been the same
since then I'm afraid...

111
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:47,791
but, to tell the truth,

112
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,416
if you want to know who's
been acting the most unusual,

113
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,083
I'd have to say it
was the children.

114
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:52,416
You mean Hazuki?

115
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,625
Oh no... There's two other
children in the family

116
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:55,875
besides Hazuki...

117
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,041
Hazuki has a brother
named Katsuki.

118
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:01,666
And Teruka has a
daughter named Wakako...

119
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,750
Katsuki and Wakako have been
acting very strange lately.

120
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:07,375
How so?

121
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,000
Well, it's hard to say...

122
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,583
but they've been sticking
unusually close to each other.

123
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:14,125
They were never really
like this before...

124
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:15,833
And on top of that...

125
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:18,583
they're constantly whispering
things to each other.

126
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,375
When we ask them what
they're talking about,

127
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,500
all they do is just
giggle and wink at us.

128
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,375
Can you tell me how long
they've been doing this?

129
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:26,541
Yeah, I'd have to say

130
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,000
it was right after
Grandfather's funeral.

131
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,416
Okay. So how is
this angle looking?

132
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,875
Good. Come on back.

133
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:41,333
Huh...?

134
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:43,291
Sure is dark in here...

135
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:44,708
when did the
lights go out?

136
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,000
That's okay.

137
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:48,041
Base is just a
few doors down.

138
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:51,583
Oh, miss.

139
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,000
Did someone
just call me?

140
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,875
Oh miss.

141
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,875
Oh miss.

142
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,250
You startled me.

143
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,875
I guess you must be
Katsuki and Wakako right...?

144
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:24,916
So what are you
kids doing up so late?

145
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,250
-Go ahead and ask her.
-Okay.

146
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,166
How many did you
bring here...?

147
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,083
How many of you
are there miss?

148
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,291
How many are there?

149
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,166
There are... five of us.

150
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,333
So there's five.

151
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,083
Not good.

152
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,083
Trouble.

153
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:46,083
Something's wrong
with these kids...

154
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,375
-Let's go.
-Wait!

155
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,250
Hold on!

156
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:50,458
You said there was five.

157
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,083
Yes I did...

158
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,125
but why did you
need to know that?

159
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:56,791
That's not something for
you to worry about miss.

160
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,208
That was creepy.

161
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,541
No wonder Akifumi had so much
trouble talking about them...

162
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,458
There is definitely
something very strange

163
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:11,958
about those two.

164
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,000
What's wrong with him?

165
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,416
Stop it!

166
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,291
-Lin!
-Right!

167
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,833
Thank God...

168
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,791
At least no one was
seriously hurt.

169
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:48,083
What in the hell
came over him?

170
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,875
I don't know.
I was talking to him

171
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:51,416
about what happened
at dinner...

172
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,583
and then...

173
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:55,458
Hey where are you going?

174
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,625
Don't just walk away
when I'm talking to you!

175
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,041
Not long after that...

176
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,833
he came back
with the knife.

177
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:05,791
Could anything have put him
in a bad mood before that...?

178
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,958
Something before
dinner perhaps?

179
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,333
No. He was acting completely
normal until this.

180
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,458
He sounded possessed.

181
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:14,750
That could be...

182
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:17,250
Looks like we'll need to
call John in on this...

183
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,458
Either that or...

184
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:20,916
Do you think you
can handle this?

185
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,708
Maybe but wouldn't
Monk be better...?

186
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,041
Don't you think so?

187
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,125
that's probably
not a good idea...

188
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,625
if I did it I'm not
sure what would happen.

189
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,625
What could happen, Monk?

190
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,250
There was this one time...

191
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:35,166
I was trying to drive a
spirit out of an urn.

192
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,000
I managed to get
the spirit out,

193
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,000
but the urn was
completely shattered.

194
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:42,958
All I'm saying is this is
pretty dangerous stuff...

195
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:45,083
dharmic power
is very risky...

196
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,333
And when you're trying to touch
someone directly with it,

197
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:48,708
anything can happen.

198
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:49,916
What...? Wait a minute.

199
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,250
Are you trying to tell us

200
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,416
that you've never driven
out a spirit before...?

201
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,250
then how do you go around
calling yourself a spiritualist?

202
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:58,625
You take care of it then.

203
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,916
I'm sure he'll be safe
since your power's so weak.

204
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,583
What's that
supposed to mean? !

205
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:03,958
Well somebody needs to...

206
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:06,166
-can you do it?
-Fine...

207
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,958
But if it takes over
someone else...

208
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,000
don't blame me.

209
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:10,875
I just know how
to drive them out.

210
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,500
What matters most
right now is that

211
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:14,791
we remove this
spirit from him.

212
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,958
It seems particularly violent.

213
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:22,333
I pray in reverence
for thy spirit.

214
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,875
I humbly ask that you
bring your holy presence

215
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:26,583
into this unhallowed place.

216
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,750
And purify all
who reside here.

217
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,750
I ask that you hear my
plea so that peace...

218
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:35,208
may reign once
again in this house.

219
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:38,583
Naru... Maybe Ayako isn't
up to this after all?

220
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,250
Perhaps she isn't...

221
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:43,083
Regardless, John will
be here tomorrow.

222
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:44,958
Bring together the gods
of the four corners

223
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:47,208
and make this place as
peaceful as the Heavens.

224
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,166
Maybe Lin should do this.

225
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,750
He can't since we don't
know the spirit's identity.

226
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:53,833
Bring together the gods
of the four corners.

227
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:56,166
Bring together the gods
of the four corners.

228
00:11:58,666 --> 00:11:59,708
Just stay back...

229
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:01,125
leave quietly...

230
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,916
Lin, take care of Mai.

231
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,291
Praise be to the
goddess Marish-ten!

232
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,625
Descend and grant us
your divine protection!

233
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:20,458
Naru!

234
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,000
-Naru!
-Don't do it!

235
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:42,541
-Naru!
-Naru!

236
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,833
Are you okay?
Did it hurt you?

237
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:46,791
No...

238
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,208
how's Eijiro?

239
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:53,375
What's going on...?

240
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:54,958
What happened to me?

241
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,708
I'm just not
getting anything...

242
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,375
ever since that fox
spirit appeared

243
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:05,666
all I'm able
to pick up...

244
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,041
is static.

245
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:08,500
Spiritual interference...

246
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:09,958
it's effecting
the gauges too.

247
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,708
All of the needles
are buried.

248
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,875
It just looked like a
simple fox-spirit...

249
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,708
but I guess you can't judge
these things by appearances,

250
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:17,333
eh Naru?

251
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:18,375
Uh...

252
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:20,083
Hey, are you sure
you're okay, man?

253
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,708
Are you feeling sick?

254
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,000
No...

255
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:25,083
my back's hurting
a bit that's all...

256
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:28,291
I think I... I think I'll
go lie down for a while.

257
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:29,958
Hang on...
I need to change

258
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:31,458
so I'll walk you
to your room, kay?

259
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,666
Oh my god, I am
such an idiot!

260
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,916
Why didn't I think to
say something like that!

261
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,875
I blew my big chance!

262
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:45,166
Unbelievable.

263
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,916
-What?
-Ayako...

264
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,833
Just who does she
think she is anyway?

265
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,541
What do you mean by that?

266
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:55,208
She completely messed up
that exorcism didn't she...?

267
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:56,416
Come to think of it,

268
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,625
Has she ever been any
real help to us...?

269
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,708
And there's even something
fishy about her claim

270
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,416
to be a priestess.

271
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,000
A real priestess
would never be out

272
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,250
trying to do exorcisms
all by herself.

273
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:08,625
Everybody knows they
don't operate that way.

274
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:10,416
-They don't?
-Of course not...

275
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,625
It's obvious to me

276
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,583
that she's just claiming
to be a priestess...

277
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,666
The thing is, she does
know her way around

278
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,666
the double-aspect
Shinto technique...

279
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,583
so I'm guessing she must have
received some kind of training.

280
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:24,708
Whoah!

281
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,083
What... what
are they...?

282
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:35,791
Lin! Hallway!

283
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,125
Wait... What's up?

284
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,333
Naru! Ayako!

285
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:52,833
Is she okay?

286
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,375
This is not good.

287
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:58,333
We've really gotten ourselves
into quite a bind here...

288
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:00,166
It's that spirit again.

289
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,416
I thought for sure

290
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,083
that the spirit had
passed through Naru

291
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:05,166
and out beyond the wall...

292
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,166
But it looks like it
stayed inside him.

293
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:11,166
I'm afraid Naru's
possessed by that thing.

294
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,791
I don't want to risk going
through all that again.

295
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:21,000
And, shouldn't
he be tied up

296
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,541
or something like
we did Eijiro,

297
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:23,958
just to be safe?

298
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:25,583
This is Naru we're
talking about.

299
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,416
I don't think tying
him up would be enough.

300
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,208
Wait... what do you mean?

301
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:31,125
Exactly what I
just said, Monk...

302
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:33,166
Ayako was just damned
lucky, that's all.

303
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,375
How?

304
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,291
Whatever it is that's
possessed Naru...

305
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,958
hasn't gained full control
over his body yet...

306
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:41,958
Otherwise...

307
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,875
you wouldn't be
alive right now.

308
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,583
In fact, Naru...

309
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:49,291
is more dangerous than any of
us can possibly imagine.

310
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,875
How could Naru
be... dangerous?

311
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,250
Tell me something...

312
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:57,916
Do you think you're
pretty good in a fight?

313
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,166
More or less.

314
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,708
And against Naru?

315
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,541
In a fight to the death...

316
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:04,083
Naru would be
the victor.

317
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:09,541
So that's out...

318
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,000
I guess rolling him
up in something

319
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,083
and sticking him
in the storeroom

320
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:13,416
wouldn't do any
good either.

321
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,750
Which also means

322
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:16,416
we can't wait around
for John to get here...

323
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,708
so we're going
to have to try

324
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:19,666
and perform
another exorcism.

325
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,083
It is very difficult
to do that

326
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:23,166
without knowing the
spirit's identity...

327
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,208
and furthermore...

328
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:25,833
with strong-willed
people like Naru,

329
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:27,833
once they're possessed it's
all the more difficult

330
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,750
to drive the
spirit out.

331
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:33,375
If we provoke it into violence
it will be very dangerous.

332
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,541
So, what are we
supposed to do then?

333
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,375
Induce paralysis...

334
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:40,083
we're going to have to keep
him sedated like he is now...

335
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,916
he'll be much easier
to handle unconscious.

336
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
In the mean time,

337
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,583
let's split up and
try to figure out

338
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,625
who that spirit is...

339
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:49,750
I am a little worried
that if we leave,

340
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,875
Naru will be
defenseless like this.

341
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:54,125
I'll leave my shiki
here with him...

342
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:56,375
If I put all
five of them here

343
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,916
they'll work together and
form a perfect barrier...

344
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,250
Nothing will be
able to touch him...

345
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:02,416
However...

346
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,541
What?

347
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,583
It'll leave me completely
defenseless...

348
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,125
I won't be much help.

349
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:11,541
Well, it's not like we have
much choice in the matter...

350
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:14,208
It's not perfect but at least
it's some kind of plan...

351
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:15,791
So tell me ladies...

352
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,375
Have you two decided yet?

353
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:18,625
On what?

354
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:19,958
It's going to be
next to impossible

355
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,958
to do this without
Naru helping us out...

356
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,666
So you girls are
gonna have to decide

357
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,250
on whether you're gonna stay
here or go somewhere safer.

358
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:27,375
What are you
talking about?

359
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:29,291
There's no way
we'd abandon Naru!

360
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:30,833
She's right of course...

361
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,000
What kind of
friends would we be

362
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,958
if we took off
and left him...?

363
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,500
I don't care how
dangerous it is.

364
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:38,000
We can't leave now
when he needs us.

365
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,166
Alright, it's on then.

366
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,875
We've got to help them.

367
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:43,250
If we don't then who knows

368
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,916
what will happen to Naru
and the Yoshimi family?

369
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,208
What am I going to do?

370
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:57,916
How could it have
come to this?

371
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,333
He left me no choice.

372
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:08,708
But why?

373
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:10,291
There was nothing
I could do...

374
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:12,666
he was waiting here
when I arrived...

375
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,041
so of course I thought
you had betrayed me.

376
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,583
How could you think
I would do that?!

377
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,000
It made sense...

378
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,000
what other reason could
there be for him being here?

379
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,750
You were the
only one who knew

380
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,458
where we were
going to meet.

381
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:27,958
No... It's not like that...

382
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,708
The letters
got mixed up...

383
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:32,083
I ended up in a completely
different place.

384
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:39,791
Now that I've killed someone

385
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,875
I've got nowhere to run...

386
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:44,333
if I turn myself in
they'll kill me.

387
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,416
If you're going to die
I'll go with you.

388
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,625
They're right
behind us Naru!

389
00:18:58,625 --> 00:18:59,833
Just keep running!

390
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:03,708
A shrine!

391
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,291
Why are we here?

392
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:06,750
We should be at the sea!

393
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,125
The sea?

394
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:09,583
What does that mean?

395
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:12,333
Why am I thinking about
the sea at a time like this?

396
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:15,333
I'm sorry...

397
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:17,041
I can't run any more.

398
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,916
It seems, pretty
hopeless to me.

399
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,958
Monk?

400
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:22,708
Tell me what's to
become of us now?

401
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:24,750
I guess we'll
have to give up.

402
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,041
Give up?

403
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,666
Eijiro?!

404
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:36,916
What's going on here?!

405
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,875
I shall curse you from
beyond the grave!

406
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:43,750
You will not escape me!

407
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:55,000
Oh, it was just a dream...

408
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,208
I know I closed that
before I went to bed.

409
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,708
Am I still asleep...?

410
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:15,208
This feels like
a dream...

411
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:17,208
and there's more of
these white things.

412
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:23,708
Naru!

413
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,041
Come down here.

414
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:36,208
So did you have the dream?

415
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:38,416
You mean...?
The one before?

416
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,291
-Did it scare you?
-Oh no.

417
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,541
I wouldn't say
that it scared me.

418
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,125
That's good.

419
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:47,458
Hey Naru... are you making
me have this dream?

420
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:48,583
No, not at all...

421
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,625
All I did was guide
you to this point.

422
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:54,625
Oh, you guided me here?

423
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:00,708
So this is what it
looks like from below.

424
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,250
There's a path
over there.

425
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:06,875
I wonder what
it leads to.

426
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,125
A cave?

427
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:16,000
Are all of
these spirits?

428
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:18,333
They are the beings
that died at sea...

429
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:20,958
This is a place that
souls drift into.

430
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:31,083
A fish?

431
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:38,375
There's something strange
about that shrine over there...

432
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:41,250
It looks... distorted.

433
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,416
Mm-hmm...

434
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,250
And I don't have
any idea why ...

435
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:48,791
however... this doesn't
feel like a bad place...

436
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:51,125
Or a good place
for that matter.

437
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:53,916
Almost like... some
kind of sacred ground.

438
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,208
Sacred...?

439
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,625
Hey... When I first saw
you outside of the cave,

440
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:03,750
you told me that you had guided
me here through my dreams...

441
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:05,083
I don't quite
understand.

442
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:06,875
What are you
trying to tell me?

443
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:11,041
Naru?

444
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:23,125
[Music]

445
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:51,458
Next time
on Ghost Hunt.

446
00:23:51,541 --> 00:23:53,291
The Cursed House, part two!

447
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:55,041
It's just
getting started!
