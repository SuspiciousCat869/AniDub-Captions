1
00:00:08,916 --> 00:00:10,416
I'm Mai Taniyama,

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,791
a freshman in high school,

3
00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:14,083
and I work as a
real-life Ghost Hunter.

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,000
A few days ago,

5
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:18,958
Noriko Morishita
came to our office

6
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:20,291
at Shibuya Psychic Research,

7
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:21,833
or SPR for short,

8
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:24,791
and hired us to
investigate her house.

9
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:26,041
Once we got there,

10
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:28,083
it didn't take long for
things to get weird.

11
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,708
Furniture started
moving on its own

12
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:33,791
and an intense fire broke
out in the kitchen...

13
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:35,333
It seemed obvious
to everyone

14
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:39,250
that this was the work
of spirits, however...

15
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:40,625
Ayami didn't do it!

16
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:43,833
The possibility seemed
more and more likely

17
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:45,416
that Noriko's niece Ayami

18
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,083
was the source of
the poltergeist.

19
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:51,166
But the real suspicion was
focused on her favorite doll,

20
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,708
Minnie.

21
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:55,750
After Ayami said that she had
conversations with the doll,

22
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:58,458
we decided investigate ...

23
00:00:58,541 --> 00:00:59,458
but then...

24
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:04,541
Is it possible...

25
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:07,416
this house is
being cursed by...

26
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,041
a little girl's doll?

27
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:20,083
[Music]

28
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,875
We lost picture.

29
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:14,916
Wait!

30
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:18,416
No way.

31
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:26,458
I don't believe it.

32
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:29,791
Yea , it somehow moved back
to its original position.

33
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:30,916
This is common.

34
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:35,000
Spirits don't care for
mechanical devices.

35
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:40,916
This is going way too far.

36
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,125
Things are
getting dangerous.

37
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:44,541
I don't think
Ayami and Minnie

38
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:47,041
should be together anymore.

39
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,708
This house is teeming
with evil witches!

40
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:51,625
Even Aunt Nori?

41
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,916
Auntie is one of
the witch's minions!

42
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,166
Who is that?

43
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,583
But I don't want
Auntie to go,

44
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,000
she's my friend.

45
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:59,916
No no. I'll get rid
of her for you,

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,708
along with the rest of them.

47
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:04,041
You just need to do
exactly as I say, okay?

48
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,625
Ayami...

49
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:11,000
Did I just hear you
talking with someone?

50
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,750
Yeah. Minnie?

51
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,291
There were some
other kids too.

52
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,666
Huh. I guess they're gone.

53
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,375
I know I closed that
door when I came in...

54
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:29,708
Well, I guess they don't
like me too much, do they...?

55
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,250
So tell me, Ayami.

56
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,500
How long have these friends
of yours been coming over?

57
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:34,583
I don't know.

58
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:35,958
Would you say that
Minnie is friends

59
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,458
with these other kids too?

60
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,333
Minnie's the one that
brought them here.

61
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,708
So what's the story
on this house?

62
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:48,458
Is it notorious around
the neighborhood

63
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:49,666
for being haunted?

64
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,541
It's the doll we should
be concerned with,

65
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:52,750
not the house...

66
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,583
You said the kid claimed
that it was Minnie

67
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:56,708
that brought over the invisible
friends, didn't she?

68
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:59,166
Yeah.

69
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,750
Can a spirit possess
a doll like that

70
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,208
and communicate through it?

71
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,875
It is a definite
possibility...

72
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:08,166
Do you Want to try
and get rid of it?

73
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,416
I'd like nothing more than
to take down that doll.

74
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:14,500
Naumaku san manda

79
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,291
While Monk was performing
his exorcism,

80
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:30,125
Ayako stayed by Ayami's
side while she slept.

81
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,208
I hope this works.

82
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:41,375
Noriko, what happened?!

83
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,875
My leg...

84
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:46,083
Your ankle is dislocated.

85
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:47,291
It felt like someone
really strong

86
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:48,958
was pulling me by my leg.

87
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:52,833
A handprint!

88
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,208
Where is Minnie?

89
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,375
Minnie's with me for
a little awhile...

90
00:05:58,458 --> 00:05:59,750
Now I need you to tell me

91
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,708
all there is to know about
your new friends, okay?

92
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,416
Give her back to me!

93
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,916
How long ago did Minnie
start talking to you?

94
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,083
Give her back...!

95
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:10,375
You can't take my
friend away from me!

96
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,041
Listen Ayami.

97
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:15,083
Your Aunt Noriko is hurt,
and Minnie did it to her.

98
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,250
Now talk!

99
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,458
I don't believe you...!

100
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:22,958
You just yelled at a little
girl and made her cry!

101
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:25,125
I'm just doing my job Mai.

102
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:26,875
Well you don't
have to be so rude!

103
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:28,291
I'm sorry.

104
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:31,083
I'm sorry...

105
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:34,333
Minnie said I wasn't
allowed to talk to anybody...

106
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:37,000
She said She'd hurt me
if I made any friends...

107
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:38,625
I'm sorry.

108
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,666
When did Minnie
start talking to you?

109
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,791
When we moved
into this house.

110
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,583
Isn't this house
beautiful, Minnie?

111
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,375
Your mother is
an evil witch

112
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,375
and your father
is her servant.

113
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:03,416
They're plotting
to kill you, Ayami.

114
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,250
What about Auntie?

115
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,500
She's on your witch
mother's side,

116
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:08,666
but don't worry...

117
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,583
I'll protect you from them.

118
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:11,875
But in return,

119
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:14,958
you're not allowed to be
nice to anyone, got it?

120
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:17,375
And if you don't
do as I say...

121
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:23,166
Whenever I would
forget her promise

122
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,875
and play with Aunt Nori,

123
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:26,250
Minnie would break things

124
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,583
and mess up the
bedroom as punishment.

125
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,833
That's what you get for
breaking your promise.

126
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:34,541
Don't try me again.

127
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,708
That is so creepy!

128
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:39,916
And was it around this time

129
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,625
that Minnie started
inviting other friends

130
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:42,833
to the house as well?

131
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:44,750
Mm hmm. Lots of them.

132
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,291
Kids just like me.

133
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:49,958
Minnie says that her
friends are her servants.

134
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:51,958
She's definitely
causing this...

135
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:54,125
Makes me wonder if the previous
owner died of an illness

136
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:55,791
and then possessed the doll.

137
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,125
That thing gives
me the creeps...

138
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:58,791
This is exactly why
I've hated dolls

139
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,000
since I was a child.

140
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,250
Minnie is not the
one behind this.

141
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:05,125
How can you say that
after what we've seen?

142
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,958
Because the doll is only
being used as a vessel...

143
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,166
There's a restless spirit

144
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,583
that's possessing this house.

145
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:15,083
Until we can find a way to
discover its true identity,

146
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:17,250
Ayami is in grave danger.

147
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:18,958
Ayami's in danger?

148
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:19,916
What does he mean by that?

149
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,250
Mai!

150
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:31,666
Look... right there.

151
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,500
Bad girls?

152
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:35,500
Could that be referring to...

153
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,583
Ayami?

154
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:40,208
Ayami just confessed
to me something

155
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:43,333
that she was warned
to never speak of.

156
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:45,666
Minnie believes that
Ayami has betrayed her.

157
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,000
Mai.

158
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,458
I want you to be with
Ayami at all times.

159
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,458
Right.

160
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,291
Don't worry; they're erasing
that stuff off the wall.

161
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,708
I don't see. Why I have
to be the one to do this?

162
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,166
It's funny. Naru was the one

163
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,875
who thought Ayami shouldn't see
what was written on the wall.

164
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,333
Does he actually
have a sweet side?

165
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:19,458
Get serious Mai. No way...

166
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,666
Not in a million years.

167
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,416
-Huh?
-Nothing...

168
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,916
Just talking to myself...

169
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,375
I tend to do
that sometimes.

170
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:30,083
Meanwhile, Monk
was busy himself.

171
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:34,791
On sunba nisunba un
bazara un hatta...

172
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,541
jaku un ban koku.

173
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,875
And with that,
Minnie was destroyed.

174
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:48,416
You've been a big help...

175
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,833
thank you.

176
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:51,166
No prob...

177
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,208
I know how hard this
has been on you...

178
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,750
Especially with
Kana leaving.

179
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:58,125
I can't stay another second
in this creepy house.

180
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:02,625
I really appreciate it.

181
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,625
Auntie, how's
your foot doing?

182
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:06,916
Much Better...

183
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,458
Actually once you started
being friends with me

184
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,083
again the pain went away.

185
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,666
That's great...

186
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,875
I'm gonna go pick some
flowers for you...

187
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:15,541
D'ya Wanna come, with me?

188
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:16,708
Sounds fun!

189
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,291
What kind should we get?

190
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:21,916
The prettiest ones!

191
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,291
Like that one!

192
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:29,291
Are you okay?

193
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:30,875
My hands are stuck!

194
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:40,875
There's nothing there.

195
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,333
Ayami wait!

196
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:45,750
Mai go get her!

197
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:50,166
She's running right
towards the pond!

198
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,791
You've got to
be kidding me...

199
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,041
I watched you burn myself.

200
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:01,125
How in the world did
you come out unscathed?

201
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:05,791
Minnie, I'm so sorry!

202
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:06,833
Don't be mad at me!

203
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,416
Please don't be mad!

204
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,583
Minnie?

205
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:14,000
Please don't hurt me...!

206
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:15,083
I'm sorry.

207
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,541
Ayami!

208
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:27,500
Ayami!

209
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:31,208
Ayami!

210
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:33,750
Ayami!

211
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,208
Help!

212
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:38,916
Ayami!

213
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,125
-Auntie.
-Ayami...

214
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:45,208
It's okay...

215
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:46,583
You're safe now.

216
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,375
Is this the punishment that
Minnie threatened her with?

217
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:19,625
I've decided to move
us out of the house.

218
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,375
That's probably
a good idea.

219
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:23,166
You should know that there
are some poltergeists

220
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,166
that will follow you,

221
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,041
regardless of
where you may be.

222
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:27,208
Really...?

223
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:29,333
Is there anything at
all that we can do?

224
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,083
There's no need
to panic...

225
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:32,583
I've been doing
extensive research

226
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:34,916
on the previous
owners of this house.

227
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,166
Before you and your
family moved in,

228
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,833
a family by the name
of Watanabe lived here.

229
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:41,291
They only lived
here for three years

230
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,916
and left due to
a job transfer.

231
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,083
So they weren't driven out
of the house by the haunting?

232
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,125
That's right...

233
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:49,750
but before them was
the Nogi family.

234
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,083
They had a nine year old girl

235
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:52,958
who died of an illness here.

236
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:55,041
Before them were
the Onuma's...

237
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,500
Three of their
children died here

238
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,000
within a six month span.

239
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,041
Three of them?

240
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:00,666
Two boys and one girl.

241
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,875
Ten, eight and
seven years old.

242
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,583
Two of them were killed
in a car accident

243
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:06,333
and other died
of an illness.

244
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,833
And before them was
the Murakami family,

245
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:10,291
who had a fifteen
year old daughter,

246
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,125
but she is still
alive today.

247
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,500
If we go back even further,

248
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,166
we have the Taniguchi family.

249
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,458
During a family visit,

250
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:18,416
their ten year old niece
also died of an illness

251
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,958
here in the house.

252
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:21,458
Before that the Ikeda family

253
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:24,083
lost their youngest son
at seven years old,

254
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,875
and before them the
Tachibana family

255
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,708
lost their eight
year old daughter,

256
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:29,208
so there's a
definite pattern here.

257
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,583
That's all I could find.

258
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:36,250
So almost all the young kids
that lived here, died here?

259
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,833
What am I gonna do?

260
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:41,333
I'm going to call in
some more specialists...

261
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:42,625
If you still want
to leave the house,

262
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:45,166
I highly recommend you
wait until they arrive.

263
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:49,208
It's got to have something
to do with this doll.

264
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:51,041
I've seen this type
of case before.

265
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,666
A girl who loves a certain
doll passes away...

266
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,458
then her spirit takes
control of the doll

267
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:57,208
and manipulates
it to her will.

268
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:58,375
I told you before.

269
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:01,083
The doll itself is
not the problem...

270
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,166
Minnie is being
used as a vessel

271
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,666
for a sitebound spirit
inside the house.

272
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,250
I just don't buy it.

273
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:10,666
Hey Mai, it's good
to see you again.

274
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,958
It's good to see you too.

275
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,250
Come In.

276
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:16,000
This is John Brown,
a priest from Australia

277
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,458
and Masako Hara,
a celebrity medium...

278
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:21,791
They've joined us to aid
in the investigation.

279
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,458
What is this?

280
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:25,250
It's horrible...

281
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,791
I've never been in such
a disturbed house before.

282
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:40,791
It's okay...

283
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,125
Why don't you
sit down now?

284
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,833
Masako? What happened?

285
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:52,458
Hey! What does she
think she's doing?

286
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,500
You okay?

287
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:57,375
This house is surrounded
by the spirits of children...

288
00:14:57,458 --> 00:15:00,333
They're all
suffering terribly.

289
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:01,875
They just keep crying,

290
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:03,375
saying they want to
be with the mothers

291
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,750
over and over again.

292
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:08,666
I've never seen so many
spirits in one house...

293
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,666
and they're all
innocent children.

294
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,333
-Masako!
-Can you hear me?

295
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:15,333
Masako!

296
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:16,750
We need to get
her some air!

297
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,250
Quick somebody
open a window.

298
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,375
Our father,
who art in Heaven.

299
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:23,916
Hell be thy name

300
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,291
In the beginning
was the Word...

301
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,083
and the Word
was with God...

302
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,791
and the Word was God.

303
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:31,375
May God bless your soul.

304
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:34,125
For the time being
I've offered up a prayer...

305
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:36,791
Your niece will be safe for
the next couple of hours.

306
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:38,041
Thank you Father.

307
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:40,291
Now then Kazuya,

308
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:43,250
I'd very much like
to see this doll.

309
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,291
Naru, I can't find
Minnie anywhere...

310
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,291
It's like she just
completely disappeared!

311
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,666
So she's run
away, has she?

312
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,750
Don't worry.

313
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,041
She'll turn up soon.

314
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,916
We're picking up some
noise from the audio feed!

315
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,166
Patch it in.

316
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:31,708
Sounds like children...

317
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,458
Dear God...

318
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,291
There's so many of them.

319
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,375
Do you think they're
looking for Ayami?

320
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:40,125
John's prayer is
having some effect...

321
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:43,541
Perhaps a kekkai barrier
would help as well.

322
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:44,666
A kekkai?

323
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,208
It's a special charm

324
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,416
that's used to thwart any
spirits from entering.

325
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:51,916
It stopped all of a sudden.

326
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,125
Naru! I found Minnie! Look!

327
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:01,458
I noticed a bulge
under the covers

328
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:02,833
at the foot of Ayami's bed,

329
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:05,208
and sure enough the doll
had found its way in there.

330
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:10,750
Is Ayami alright?

331
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,291
She's fine.

332
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:14,708
Those voices stopped at
the exact same time

333
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:16,333
that Ayako found Minnie.

334
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,875
Our father, who
art in heaven,

335
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:26,666
hallowed be thy name.

336
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,250
I beseech thee, God,

337
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,916
to take pity on us,
and bless us...

338
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,166
Let thy face
shine over us.

339
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,666
In the beginning
was the Word...

340
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,958
and the Word
was with God...

341
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,958
and the Word was God.

342
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,750
And the light shineth
in the darkness...

343
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:51,166
and the darkness
comprehended it not.

344
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,375
I believe the spirit
has now been cleansed.

345
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:01,541
Though that doesn't mean

346
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,458
that it has been destroyed...

347
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,458
I think it would be best
for us to burn the doll

348
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:07,708
so that it can never be
used for evil again.

349
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:12,916
This time, Minnie
burned easily.

350
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:17,541
I believe Minnie's true
identity is the spirit

351
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:19,541
that haunts this house.

352
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,125
Do you think it could it
be one of the children

353
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:22,250
that died here?

354
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,208
There's a good chance.

355
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,208
The spirits were probably
lonely by themselves,

356
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:27,708
so they try to bring
over the children

357
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:30,166
that inhabit the house
and befriend them.

358
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:33,083
Those children become
sitebound spirits as well...

359
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:35,416
Why is it just
the children?

360
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,916
Huh?

361
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,208
If they were lonely,

362
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,208
then why not choose
Noriko or Mai,

363
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,583
someone who could act as
a substitute mother...?

364
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:43,791
However, for some reason

365
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,958
Minnie was attempting
to eliminate them...

366
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,166
Why do that?

367
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,958
Mai. How's Miss Hara?

368
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:54,458
She's still not
feeling too well.

369
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:55,666
I see.

370
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,625
Monk, I'd like you to try
cleansing the house again.

371
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:00,541
You sure?

372
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:05,333
The first to die
was Yuki Tachibana.

373
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,958
Here's her info and
posthumous Buddhist name.

374
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:09,666
She was with
the Jodo sect.

375
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,083
How'd you find
that out...?

376
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,041
Those records are
seventy years old.

377
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,458
It was rather easy.

378
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:22,583
Let me see the
records up 'till now.

379
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,833
Boy, you really are
sure of yourself,

380
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:26,708
aren't you, Naru?

381
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,333
I thought you said the
ghosts can follow us,

382
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:31,208
so will we really be
safe at a hotel?

383
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:32,791
This charm will
protect you.

384
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,333
And just to be safe,

385
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:36,916
I'm sending Father Brown and
Miss Matsuzaki to stay with you.

386
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,166
Thank you.

387
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,958
Mai are you gonna
come with us?

388
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:42,875
I can't...
I'm sorry.

389
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,125
Is it working, Miss Hara?

390
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,958
The spirits have
yet to notice...

391
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:56,750
It appears as if the
charm is working well.

392
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,041
Alright.

393
00:19:58,125 --> 00:19:59,333
Let's get back to work.

394
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:03,750
Monk. You ready?

395
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,125
I'm ready as I'll ever be

396
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,583
Naumaku san manda bazaradan.

397
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:14,375
Sendamakaro shata sowataya
un tarata, kan man.

398
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:18,125
Naumaku san manda
bodaran, on boron.

399
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:19,166
The temperature around the bed

400
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,958
has started to
drop considerably.

401
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,125
It's already down two
degrees in the last minute.

402
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:24,458
And the audio?

403
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,375
Nothing to speak
of at this point.

404
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,958
Though I'm not getting
the usual static.

405
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:30,083
naumaku san manda botanan.

406
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:32,833
Naumaku san
manda bazaradan.

407
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:35,083
Sendamakaro shata sowataya
un tarata, kan man.

408
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,166
I'm picking up
something else now...

409
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,375
Knocking sounds.

410
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:41,708
Naru look!

411
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:44,166
What the...

412
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,166
Lin, give me temp
in the living room?

413
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,291
It's currently at
negative two degrees.

414
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:49,541
It's dropping...?

415
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,541
Monk we've got you
in the wrong room...

416
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,791
All of the activity's
coming from the living room.

417
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,833
-What?
-Naru!

418
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,291
Woah, what the...

419
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:12,541
I've got multiple
apparitions in here!

420
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:18,291
Naumari saba tataki
ya tei biyari.

421
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:21,125
Saraba mottei
biyari, saraba ta...

422
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:22,125
Tarauku!

423
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:31,791
They're in pain.

424
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:34,375
Monk's exorcism hurting
those poor children.

425
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:42,500
I can't take this any longer!

426
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:44,958
Tomiko...

427
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:46,208
What was that?

428
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:55,500
Tomiko...

429
00:21:58,041 --> 00:21:59,708
my... child.

430
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,375
Tomiko

431
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:23,333
[Music]

432
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:52,083
Next time on Ghost Hunt

433
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:53,916
we conclude the case
of "The Doll House."

434
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,208
Was that not spooky?
