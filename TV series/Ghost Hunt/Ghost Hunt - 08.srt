1
00:00:08,291 --> 00:00:09,833
My name is Mai Taniyama,

2
00:00:09,916 --> 00:00:11,750
and I'm a freshman
in high school...

3
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:13,458
Another mysterious case

4
00:00:13,541 --> 00:00:15,791
was brought to
Shibuya Psychic Research.

5
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:18,791
A girl believed that her
friend was possessed by a fox,

6
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:20,541
and a teacher
collapsed after claiming

7
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:21,916
he could see ghosts.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,625
After the principal
visited us

9
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:27,000
we agreed to investigate the
events at Yuasa High School.

10
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:29,416
When we got there weird
things kept happening,

11
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,583
and the stories got
stranger and scarier.

12
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:35,416
What in the world
is going on here?

13
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,875
We did discover
an incident

14
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:38,500
about three
months earlier...

15
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:41,375
a girl named Kasai was
publicly ridiculed by teachers

16
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:42,708
for saying she
could bend spoons

17
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:45,041
using supernatural powers.

18
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:46,333
And then...

19
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:48,291
I'll curse you to death!

20
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:49,958
Not long After that,

21
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:53,791
the unexplainable and dangerous
occurrences started happening.

22
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:55,666
And poor Miss Kei
was treated horribly

23
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:56,916
by the other teachers

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,208
just because she had
the nerve to defend me!

25
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:01,291
I don't understand why
this is happening to me...

26
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:05,208
I have a really bad
feeling about all of this.

27
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:08,416
Underneath all of these
strange and mysterious events,

28
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,916
I sense a
creeping darkness

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,875
that's growing
stronger every day.

30
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:18,958
[Music]

31
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:56,500
On sunba nisunba

32
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:58,500

on dakini shara

34
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:06,083
Drive them out
and purify.

35
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:08,416
I entreat you
in serenity...

36
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,125
please receive
this humble prayer

37
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,833
and grant my fervent wish.

38
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:15,375
Our holy Father who
art in heaven...

39
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:18,083
Hallowed be thy name.

40
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:26,666
Nothing out of
the ordinary.

41
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,916
No remarkable temperature
changes to report either.

42
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:31,958
Of course not.

43
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:34,291
Because there are no
spirits in this building.

44
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:37,333
There are still unexplained
events happening here...

45
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,500
it is imperative
keep investigating

46
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,291
until we determine
their cause...

47
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:42,250
Fine.

48
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:43,666
But no matter
how hard you look

49
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,083
you won't find spirits.

50
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,958
So many foxfires,

51
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:01,083
burning all over
the building...

52
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,291
was it a dream?

53
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,916
Or could it be...

54
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,291
Wake up Mai!

55
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,000
That was so weird...

56
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,333
I've got a really bad
feeling about this.

57
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,583
I hope everyone can do
their exorcisms fast

58
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:18,291
so we can get out of here.

59
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,375
Kasai?

60
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,000
Uh, wait a second!

61
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,375
Kasai!

62
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:33,500
Yeah?

63
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:35,583
Um, well, can I help
you with anything?

64
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:36,666
No thanks.

65
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,208
Oh.

66
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,583
Are all those other
people friends of yours?

67
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,125
Huh?

68
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:44,416
It looks like they're trying
to do some sort of exorcism.

69
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,250
Oh... them, yeah

70
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,458
Monk, Ayako and John are
my friends I guess...

71
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:50,708
but actually they're
more like my coworkers.

72
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,291
And Masako Hara?

73
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,416
Ohh...

74
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,166
of course you'd
know who she is.

75
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,625
I keep forgetting that Masako
is actually kinda famous.

76
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:01,333
Yeah, I saw her on tv.

77
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:03,791
What has she said
about this school?

78
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:06,125
That there are a lot of
evil spirits hanging around?

79
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:08,541
Uh-uh, actually she doesn't
think that there are any.

80
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:09,958
Aren't any...?

81
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:13,000
Even with all of the
stuff happening here?

82
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,916
It was hard for me
to believe, too...

83
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,833
but she swears she
doesn't see them here.

84
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:18,916
So what about you?

85
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,166
Are you able to see them?

86
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,791
Oh, no no no no
no no no, not me,

87
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,041
I'm not a spiritualist.

88
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,125
I've never been
able to do that.

89
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:27,416
What about Mr. Shibuya?

90
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,333
He's a spiritualist, right?

91
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:30,791
Oh, Nar...

92
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:33,583
I mean Mr. Shibuya isn't really
a spiritualist per se...

93
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,541
he's more of a
Ghost Hunter...

94
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,666
And I think he may be
an onmyouji as well.

95
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,708
Is he really...?!

96
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:43,500
So that would mean he
does practice onmyodo...

97
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,000
Naru!

98
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:50,625
See ya later?

99
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,625
I thought there was something
fishy about that girl.

100
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,750
You're saying she came in here
to check us all out, right?

101
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:24,041
Maybe she wasn't
checking us out,

102
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,333
maybe she was just
curious or something.

103
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:28,708
Well, Kasai is aware that
the whole school thinks

104
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,541
her curse is the cause
of all of this...

105
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,250
maybe she thinks
we believe it too

106
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,166
and we're her latest
enemy, y'know?

107
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,708
She wouldn't do that!

108
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,750
Still... she does have powers...

109
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,875
According to a number
of her schoolmates,

110
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:42,875
she was apparently able to
bend spoons with her mind...

111
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:45,958
do you think it's possible
she also possesses PK-LT?

112
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:47,916
What's PK-LT?

113
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,416
I'll explain it
for Mai's sake.

114
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,458
PK-LT is the power to
affect living creatures

115
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:56,541
using only a
force of will...

116
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,708
the two major divisions
of supernatural ability

117
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:01,041
are PK and ESP...

118
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:04,000
or extra-sensory
perception.

119
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,833
This is a special
ability to know things

120
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:08,125
that normal people
wouldn't sense...

121
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:10,875
Telepathy and clairvoyance
are in this category.

122
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:13,625
PK, however, is a
force of will...

123
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:17,041
moving objects by literally
thinking them into action...

124
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:19,291
The three categories
are PK-MT...

125
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:20,708
PK-ST...

126
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:23,125
and last but
not least PK-LT.

127
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:29,291
PK-ST is the power to
affect static targets...

128
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:30,875
spoon-bending
would fall here.

129
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,291
PK-MT is the power to
affect moving targets.

130
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,958
And PK-LT, as I've said,

131
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,166
is the power to
affect living targets.

132
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:43,791
So, what makes
you think Kasai

133
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,666
is capable of
doing such a thing?

134
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,000
If you can't see
the connection

135
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,708
after everything I've said
then I can't help you.

136
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:51,916
I'm sorry I'm so
stupid, your highness!

137
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,500
Are we in agreement

138
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:56,333
then that Kasai really did
invoke a curse on the school?

139
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:57,208
A curse?!

140
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:58,750
She admitted it.

141
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,625
She said "I'll
curse you to death!"

142
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:01,875
Oh, right.

143
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:03,916
But it's not
really a curse.

144
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,333
It's more like using
psychic powers

145
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:06,583
to make people suffer...

146
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,875
that's the PK-LT part...

147
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:11,000
But judging from what I've
heard from a number of students

148
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:13,875
I don't think the girl
has that much power.

149
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:15,166
Do you guys
know about the

150
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,375
famous British psychic
Oliver Davis?

151
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:22,708
They say he can slam an l
aluminum block into the wall...

152
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:25,833
But he hasn't been
able to perform PK-LT.

153
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:28,916
This girl can't even seem
to bend spoons very well.

154
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,875
I remember when
I was little

155
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,708
there was sort of a
supernatural craze,

156
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:36,916
where tons of kids claimed

157
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,291
they could bend spoons
and perform magic...

158
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:40,375
Of course It turned out

159
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:41,958
that most of them
were just lying.

160
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:44,291
Wow... that means you
must be pretty old.

161
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:50,125
Be that as it may...

162
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:52,625
It's very important to
remember that in Kasai's case

163
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:55,291
she truly believed
in her psychic powers.

164
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,750
She felt that she was unfairly
attacked and ridiculed

165
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,833
by her teachers in front
of the entire school...

166
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,583
And then...

167
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,250
I'll curse you to death!

168
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:08,458
Strange things began happening
after she said that.

169
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,583
Those are the facts...

170
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,875
and we can't ignore them.

171
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:14,791
Something awful
has happened!

172
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,958
Mr. oshino was in
a bad car accident

173
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,166
and now he's in
the hospital!

174
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:30,291
I... I was driving...

175
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:34,000
And there it was,
right in front of me...

176
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:40,541
It's because of her...

177
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:41,708
that girl...

178
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,833
it's Chiaki Kasai...

179
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,541
When I was
leaving school...

180
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,250
she ran into me...

181
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,666
and she gave me the most
evil look I've ever seen!

182
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,041
Oh my God she
cursed me...!

183
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:57,125
She cursed me to die and now
it's really happening...

184
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,750
What do you think, Naru?

185
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,291
Was it Kasai?

186
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:06,791
I'm really not sure ...

187
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,125
but we can safely say

188
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,375
that things seem to
be getting worse.

189
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:11,666
Let's hurry back...

190
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,916
we've got a lot to do
and no time to waste.

191
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:17,541
What's wrong?

192
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:18,833
I don't know...

193
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:20,875
I just felt scared
all of a sudden.

194
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:24,750
C'mon, Kasai, admit it!

195
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,208
Why don't you just stop!

196
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:29,375
Yeah, stop using your
psychic powers or whatever...

197
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,791
what're you trying to do,
scare everyone to death?!

198
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,583
No... You're wrong.

199
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,916
You know, if poor
Mr. oshino had died

200
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,916
you'd totally be
guilty of murder!

201
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,958
Hey, maybe we
should lay off...

202
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,708
if we say too much
she could freak out

203
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:45,208
and decide to
curse us next!

204
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,208
What are you girls doing?

205
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:48,666
Kasai?

206
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:54,875
Kasai?!

207
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,291
There they go again.

208
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:58,875
It's kinda sick.

209
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,541
I don't understand
how Miss Ubusuna

210
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,208
can stick up for
her like that.

211
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,458
Don't pay any
attention to them.

212
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,708
It's not your fault.

213
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,291
You've done nothing wrong.

214
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:23,166
On sunba nisunba
un bazaar un hatta.

215
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:28,041
The Word was made
flesh and was life...

216
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:30,208
And that life was
the light of man.

217
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,958
Naumaku san manda
botan on dakini.

218
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:38,875
Praise be given as the gods
from all corners come together.

219
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:41,416
On dakini shara
kyara heigi yaya ...

220
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,666
The Word was made
flesh and was life...

221
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,375
Naumaku san manda
bazarandan kan!

222
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,250
Man, they've got their
hands full with this one.

223
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,708
They exorcized the track
team's locker room,

224
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,083
as well as that desk,

225
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:59,041
so they've hit every place
related to the incidents.

226
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:01,791
But still I...

227
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,291
I wonder if...

228
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:04,750
I mean I hope nothing's...

229
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:07,000
gonna pop out in
this room, too.

230
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,125
Naru!

231
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:19,291
Oh, how about I
make some tea?

232
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:20,583
Fine.

233
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:23,916
Hey, Naru?

234
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,583
I have a question
about Kasai...

235
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:26,833
I don't know yet.

236
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:28,166
Okay!

237
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,416
It's just that there's
something bothering me.

238
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,166
What's that?

239
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,166
Did you see it?

240
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,458
Aww, I hope it's
not a power outage.

241
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:40,833
Quiet.

242
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,791
Now don't make any
sudden movements...

243
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,291
Just stay calm.

244
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,750
It's coming toward us...

245
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,833
I'm so scared,

246
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,916
oh somebody please help!

247
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:22,916
Naumaku san manda
bazarandan kan!

248
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,041
Ah, so the spirits
have started

249
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,083
showing their faces
in here, too, huh.

250
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:36,166
Apparently.

251
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:40,416
Hey, are you alright, Mai?

252
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,541
That woman never looked
at me, not once...

253
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:44,875
she only looked at Naru!

254
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,416
Mai, snap out of it.

255
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,375
That spirit was
looking for Naru!

256
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:50,833
Naru?

257
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:52,041
That woman just now...

258
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:53,416
It wasn't a coincidence,

259
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,333
I know she came for him.

260
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:57,166
I had a dream last night...

261
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,333
and I saw foxfires
all over the school...

262
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:02,125
That thing we just
saw was one of them!

263
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,666
I can't tell you
how I know that,

264
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,958
but I'm positive I'm right...

265
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:07,500
and that woman's
eyes, those evil,

266
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:09,791
bloodthirsty eyes...

267
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,958
She was looking
straight at Naru!

268
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:24,833
What's the matter?
Your eyes are all red.

269
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:27,541
Our friend came
back to visit me.

270
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,916
Wait a second,
do you mean...

271
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,875
Turns out your
instinct was right...

272
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,833
She appeared at my
window last evening

273
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,708
I thought something worse might
happen if I looked away,

274
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:41,791
so we spent the entire
night staring at each other.

275
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,958
Why the hell
didn't you call me?!

276
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,583
Because I wanted to see
what would happen...

277
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:48,666
and I thought
it would be rude

278
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,625
to wake you up for nothing.

279
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:53,291
And what would you have done
if something bad had happened?

280
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:56,166
Well, obviously, if it
had I would have called...

281
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,625
but we just had a little
staring contest...

282
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,208
so stop worrying.

283
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,208
Then there's no way
it could be Kasai

284
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,500
I mean, for her to
cast a such big curse,

285
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,666
she'd have to have a lot
of that PK-whatever power,

286
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,458
wouldn't she?

287
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:14,416
It's PK-LT...

288
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,666
But you are right, if she
wanted to be able to affect

289
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,166
so many people
with this curse,

290
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,291
she would need to have
quite a lot of that power.

291
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:22,583
When we met her
the first time

292
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,750
she wasn't even able
to bend that spoon...

293
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,083
That's right...

294
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,833
And spirits appeared
to all of the victims

295
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:29,958
in every single incident

296
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:32,208
The Kasai theory
definitively doesn't account

297
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:33,916
for these apparitions.

298
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,458
Well, maybe she's
just off making

299
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:39,083
effigy dolls or something.

300
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,041
You mean she makes dolls
night after night

301
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,333
so she can go around
cursing everyone?!

302
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:45,625
I guess that's not
an impossible theory.

303
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:47,666
But whenever you use
straw effigy dolls

304
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,125
isn't it only supposed
to only hurt the person

305
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:51,083
where the nail is driven in?

306
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,583
She's right, and dolls
do not summon spirits.

307
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:54,875
Course not...

308
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,916
Moreover, they don't
possess the power

309
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,208
to have caused
repeated hauntings.

310
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,916
-Lin!
-Yes...

311
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,833
it's possible
that's the answer.

312
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:05,291
C'mon, fill us in.

313
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,458
I can't believe I didn't
think of it sooner...

314
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,791
Were dealing
with a zuzhou.

315
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,416
A zuzhou?!

316
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,625
There's an extremely powerful
hex at work in this school

317
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,416
to that's calling
down curses on people.

318
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,875
Are you serious?!

319
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:21,416
Okay, but what's
the connection

320
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,708
between the zuzhou
and these spirits?

321
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:26,833
This hex ,originally
derived from the Yin-yan Tao,

322
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,958
is cast by driving a
nail into a hitogata,

323
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:30,916
or straw effigy doll...

324
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,541
I'll explain this
so Mai can catch up.

325
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,083
In the Yin-yan Tao

326
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,541
there's a certain
method of cursing people

327
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:39,000
referred to as enmi.

328
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,083
It's a hex that uses
either a hitogata

329
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,458
or a possession of
the one being cursed,

330
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:45,500
and driving a nail into
the straw effigy doll

331
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,666
is one of the enmi arts.

332
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,750
The doll's function is to simply
convey the level of hatred

333
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,458
of the person
driving the nail...

334
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:55,125
the dolls themselves
can do no real harm.

335
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,458
But when the hexer, the
one performing the curse,

336
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,625
drives the nail
into the hitogata,

337
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:03,250
they call upon gods or spirits
to deliver a deathcurse.

338
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:04,333
Deathcurse?

339
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:06,500
The gods or spirits
accept the task,

340
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:09,500
and carry the curse to
the unlucky subject.

341
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:10,833
In other words,

342
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:12,375
the hexer actually contracts

343
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,875
these gods, spirits
and even demons

344
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:18,083
by performing the enmi arts.

345
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:20,416
So you're saying that
the cursed desk...

346
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,041
the hand that
attacked Mr. oshino...

347
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,916
And that woman that came
down from the ceiling...

348
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,250
Were all evil
spirits with curses?

349
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,708
Someone has cast multiple
enmi spells against people

350
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,041
at this school

351
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:33,416
and evil spirits are
appearing to those

352
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,666
who have been cursed.

353
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,875
The spirits aren't
powerful enough

354
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:38,000
to kill their targets
immediately

355
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,041
so they torment and lead
them to their deaths.

356
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,500
It's a very indirect
form of murder.

357
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,625
And if these attacks were
to happen frequently,

358
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,333
as they have at Yuasa...

359
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:48,833
It would definitely have a
negative effect on those people

360
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:50,666
who are easily influenced.

361
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,125
Yes... an extreme
example would be the girl

362
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:55,000
who believed she was
possessed by a fox.

363
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:01,541
This explains both the
incidents themselves

364
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:05,125
and why the entire school was
thrown into such a panic.

365
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:07,000
So who performed
the curses?

366
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:08,666
All the evidence
would seem to suggest

367
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,958
the hexer is Kasai.

368
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:11,291
Wait, hold on...

369
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:12,583
It has to be Kasai.

370
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,333
-You think so, too??
-Well, yeah...

371
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,083
look her abilities
were rejected

372
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:18,041
and in turn she was
made fun of and attacked

373
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,791
in front of the
whole school, right?

374
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,041
And even her teacher friend

375
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:22,458
has been put through
hell because of it.

376
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:23,833
There they go again.

377
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,333
It's kind of sick.

378
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:26,666
I don't understand

379
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,958
how Miss Ubusuna can stick
up for her like that.

380
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,791
They pushed
Kasai to the edge

381
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:35,208
so she called down a
deathcurse on them...

382
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:37,208
she's just making
good on her threat.

383
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:38,791
But it's not true!

384
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,250
Then explain why Mr. oshino,

385
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,583
who personally challenged
and laughed at her

386
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:45,166
in front of the entire school,
is now in the hospital?

387
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,250
I dunno, but...

388
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,666
What reason do you
have for believing

389
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,416
that she's not to blame?

390
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,333
I'm not sure but...

391
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:52,291
I do.

392
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:58,375
Yeah... it isn't
something I can explain,

393
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:00,083
I just know deep inside

394
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,666
that Kasai isn't the
person we're looking for.

395
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,333
She's not the one...

396
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:05,333
I know it!

397
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:13,208
Alright... I believe you.

398
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:14,458
You do?!

399
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:16,291
That's great but
someone could still die

400
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:17,500
if we don't hurry.

401
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:18,625
We have to act...

402
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,375
we can't leave the
zuzhou out there...

403
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,500
I'd like you all to
search for the hitogata...

404
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:24,750
Lin and I will go
looking for the culprit.

405
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,791
Uh, we're looking
for dolls?!

406
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,250
There are two ways to
break an enmi spell...

407
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,000
Turn the curse
back on the hexer

408
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,333
or burn the hitogata
being used.

409
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:36,250
The doll is usually
buried near the target...

410
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,125
That means if the
hexer is a student

411
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,916
or school faculty member,

412
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,708
it's most likely
around here somewhere.

413
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:43,750
'Somewhere'?!

414
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,708
Oh great, that
helps a lot...

415
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,041
what do you want us to do,
dig up the whole school?!

416
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:49,458
Well, the hexer
must have buried

417
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:51,583
my hitogata sometime
after Monday

418
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,750
when we started
investigating.

419
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:56,625
So that one should still
be fresh and easier to spot.

420
00:19:56,708 --> 00:20:00,750
I guess but, c'mon
this school is huge!

421
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,333
Perhaps you'd
like to leave.

422
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:05,750
Alright!

423
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,875
Wait a minute, Naru...!you
can't just go in there,

424
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:21,958
the class is in
session right now!

425
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,041
Don't...

426
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,458
I guess they must've
switched rooms or something.

427
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:35,666
Naru, you really
shouldn't do that either!

428
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,083
Here it is.

429
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:43,958
That's the hitogata?!

430
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:47,291
They did a good
job on it...

431
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,625
But It doesn't seem to be made
for anyone specifically...

432
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,166
it's only intention
was to curse

433
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,666
whoever sat at this desk.

434
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,750
I think you're right.

435
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,000
The hitogata caused

436
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:58,083
whoever sat here to
have an accident...

437
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:00,416
Meaning the hurt students
weren't specifically targeted

438
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,750
so much as they
were just unlucky.

439
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,000
I bet we'll find another one

440
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:05,333
in the track
team's locker room

441
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:07,000
that's aimed at the
entire club...

442
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,791
rather than at
a single person.

443
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:15,041
hm, the floor
is concrete...

444
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:17,000
they're usually buried,
aren't they?

445
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:19,000
Usually Yes, but it's
quite possible

446
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:20,125
they've been hidden
in the ceiling.

447
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:30,916
I found it!

448
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:35,666
Good work, Mai.

449
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,333
Oh, no prob!

450
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:39,500
This one is
enmi as well...

451
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:41,666
A cursed desk and
the track team...

452
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,000
if we dig a little deeper

453
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,875
we're sure to find
the culprit soon.

454
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:01,875
Its Masako!

455
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,500
NO!

456
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:23,083
[Music]

457
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:50,041
Next time on Ghost Hunt,

458
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:52,000
'The After-School Hexer'
Part Three.

459
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:53,250
Is it just me

460
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:55,208
or is school more
dangerous these days?
