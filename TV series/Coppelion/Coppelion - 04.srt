TO HELP YOU.

LET'S GO CATCH
THE CROW THAT GOT AWAY.

00:00:18,501 --> 00:00:20,669
BUT THEY'RE IN THE AIR.

00:00:20,669 --> 00:00:21,926
WE'LL NEED
A POWERFUL WEAPON

5
00:00:21,926 --> 00:00:23,606
TO BE ABLE
TO BRING THEM DOWN.

6

00:00:24,927 --> 00:00:26,675
MAYBE THIS'LL HELP.

I FOUND IT OVER THERE
AT THE WAREHOUSE.

Ibara: SWEET!
A FREAKIN' HAND ARROW!

11
00:00:33,932 --> 00:00:36,318
GOOD JOB, AOI.

12
00:00:36,318 --> 00:00:38,487

00:00:39,933 --> 00:00:41,925

GET PAST THE RIVER!

DO YOU KNOW HOW
TO USE THAT THING?

00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:34,017
THEY TAUGHT US
IN GYM CLASS

20
00:02:34,017 --> 00:02:35,419
HOW TO HANDLE
THESE KINDS OF WEAPONS.

THEY'RE TRYING
TO ATTACK US FROM THE REAR.

25
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,465
I'D SAY THEY'RE
PRETTY PISSED.

00:02:48,465 --> 00:02:49,710
ANY IDEAS?

THE TURN, TOO.

IT'S STAYING
ON OUR TAIL!

00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,712
THEY SEEM
SO DETERMINED.

33
00:03:01,712 --> 00:03:04,717
WHY DO THEY WANT
TO GET US SO BADLY?

SOMETHING TO HIDE.

FOR THE BOAT RACE STADIUM.

THE POOL THERE HAS
FILLED UP WITH RAINWATER
OVER THE YEARS.

73
00:05:19,382 --> 00:05:23,086

TO PUT OUT THE FLAMES
AND THEN ESCAPE.

TO SLOW YOU GIRLS DOWN.

WE'RE TOO LATE.

WHO DO YOU THINK
THESE PEOPLE ARE,
IBARA?

92
00:06:10,033 --> 00:06:12,713
PROBABLY
HIRED SOLDIERS.

93
00:06:12,713 --> 00:06:14,337
I SCREWED UP
AGAIN.

94
00:06:14,337 --> 00:06:16,439
I LET
PEOPLE DIE.

95
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:17,713

96
00:06:17,713 --> 00:06:20,377
I SEE IT.
LET'S CHECK IT OUT.

97
00:06:23,013 --> 00:06:25,182
I'M SO EXHAUSTED.

98
00:06:25,182 --> 00:06:27,712
LATER,
WE'LL HAVE ICE CREAM.

99
00:06:27,712 --> 00:06:29,119
HUH?

100
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,322
IBARA,
THERE'S A BUNCH
OF YELLOW BARRELS

101
00:06:32,322 --> 00:06:33,713
DOWN AT THE BOTTOM
OF THE POOL.

102
00:06:33,713 --> 00:06:34,715
BARRELS?

103
00:06:34,715 --> 00:06:36,709
YEAH. THERE'S
A TON OF THEM

104
00:06:36,709 --> 00:06:37,717
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

105
00:06:37,717 --> 00:06:39,709
I WONDER
WHAT THEY ARE.

106
00:06:39,709 --> 00:06:41,031
THAT'S NOT GOOD.

107
00:06:41,031 --> 00:06:43,710
THOSE BARRELS ARE FILLED
WITH HIGH-LEVEL WASTE.

108
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,168
HIGH-LEVEL WASTE?

109
00:06:45,168 --> 00:06:46,436
WHAT'S THAT
DOING HERE?

110
00:06:46,436 --> 00:06:49,239
WELL, THIS ANSWERS
ONE OF OUR QUESTIONS.

111
00:06:49,239 --> 00:06:50,716
THESE BARRELS
ARE THE SOURCE

112
00:06:50,716 --> 00:06:53,713
OF THE SEVERE CONTAMINATION
WE DETECTED IN THIS AREA.

113
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:56,146
WASTE HAS BEEN
LEAKING OUT FROM HERE,

114
00:06:56,146 --> 00:06:58,415
CONTAMINATING
OTHER PARTS OF THE CITY.

115
00:06:58,415 --> 00:07:02,118
HOW COULD ANYBODY
DUMP ALL THIS
WITHOUT BEING SEEN?

116
00:07:02,118 --> 00:07:03,186
OF COURSE.

117
00:07:03,186 --> 00:07:04,711
THE STEALTH BOMBER.

118
00:07:09,712 --> 00:07:11,715
Ibara: YEP. LOOKS LIKE
WE WERE RIGHT.

119
00:07:11,715 --> 00:07:13,713
THEY'RE FREE
TO DO WHAT THEY WANT

120
00:07:13,713 --> 00:07:16,709
BECAUSE THERE'S
NO OVERSIGHT EFFORTS
BEING MADE,

121
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:19,709
NO MATTER THE COST.

122
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:22,715
HIGH-LEVEL WASTE?

123
00:07:22,715 --> 00:07:25,041
YES, SIR. THEY WERE
USING THE BOMBER

124
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:27,709
TO DROP TONS OF IT
IN THE BOAT RACE STADIUM,

125
00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:30,708
SO WE'VE STARTED
LOOKING AROUND
FOR SOME CLUES.

126
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,415
Aoi: IBARA!

127
00:07:32,415 --> 00:07:34,709
LOOK AT THIS.

128
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:36,708
IT'S A STICKER
FROM ONE OF THE BARRELS.

129
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:40,023
IT SAYS, "YELLOW CAKE,"
AND HAS A CAKE LOGO ON IT.

130
00:07:40,023 --> 00:07:42,025
WHAT? YELLOW CAKE?

131
00:07:42,025 --> 00:07:43,708
Ibara: DO YOU
KNOW IT, SIR?

132
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,708
IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN,

133
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:49,432
THERE'S A BACK-END COMPANY
CALLED YELLOW CAKE IN JAPAN.

134
00:07:49,432 --> 00:07:50,715
BACK-END COMPANY?

135
00:07:50,715 --> 00:07:52,715
IT'S A BUSINESS
THAT MANAGES

136
00:07:52,715 --> 00:07:54,709
THE DISPOSAL
OF SPENT FUEL

137
00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:56,709
AND HAZARDOUS
WASTE PRODUCTS.

138
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:58,711
SO THEN
ARE THEY RESPONSIBLE

139
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:01,411
FOR USING THE BOMBER
TO DROP THE WASTE HERE?

140
00:08:01,411 --> 00:08:04,710
YES, AND IT'S PROBABLY
FOREIGN WASTE, TOO.

141
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,284
HIGH-LEVEL WASTE
IS VERY DANGEROUS,

142
00:08:07,284 --> 00:08:10,153
AND THERE AREN'T
GOOD PLACES TO DISPOSE OF IT.

143
00:08:10,153 --> 00:08:13,089
Ibara: BUT ISN'T IT OK
AS LONG AS IT'S

144
00:08:13,089 --> 00:08:16,709
BURIED FOR CENTURIES
AND PROPERLY MANAGED?

145
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:17,714
IN THEORY, YES,

146
00:08:17,714 --> 00:08:19,714
BUT WHO
WILL MANAGE IT
UNTIL THEN?

147
00:08:21,097 --> 00:08:23,708
YOU GIRLS KNOW THIS
BETTER THAN ANYONE.

148
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:26,710
THAT POOL OF WASTE
REPRESENTS MAN'S GREED

149
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:29,715
AND IS A CROSS
WE ALL MUST BEAR.

150
00:08:29,715 --> 00:08:32,715
EVERY NATION
ENDED UP WITH MORE
THAN THEY COULD HANDLE,

151
00:08:32,715 --> 00:08:36,708
AND NOW THEY'RE
LOOKING DESPERATELY
FOR A PLACE TO DUMP IT.

152
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:38,381
AND THEY'VE
FOUND A PLACE.

153
00:08:38,381 --> 00:08:40,116
YOU MEAN TO SAY...

154
00:08:40,116 --> 00:08:42,319
YES, THE OLD CAPITAL.

155
00:08:42,319 --> 00:08:44,713
YELLOW CAKE
PROBABLY FIGURED

156
00:08:44,713 --> 00:08:48,124
THAT THIS CITY WAS
ALREADY AS CONTAMINATED
AS IT COULD GET,

157
00:08:48,124 --> 00:08:50,712
SO THEY STARTED
ACCEPTING CONTRACTS

158
00:08:50,712 --> 00:08:52,711
TO DISPOSE
OF HAZARDOUS WASTE

159
00:08:52,711 --> 00:08:55,332
FROM AROUND THE WORLD
FOR EXORBITANT FEES,

160
00:08:55,332 --> 00:08:58,711
ALL FOR THE SAKE
OF IMMEDIATE PROFIT.

161
00:09:00,715 --> 00:09:02,205
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

162
00:09:02,205 --> 00:09:03,716
THEY'RE TURNING
THIS CITY INTO

163
00:09:03,716 --> 00:09:06,309
A DUMPING GROUND
FOR HAZARDOUS WASTE?

164
00:09:06,309 --> 00:09:09,708
WHAT ARE
THOSE BASTARDS
THINKING?!

165
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,715
Taeko:
IBARA, CALM DOWN.

166
00:09:11,715 --> 00:09:14,711
Ibara: HOW CAN
THEY BE SO ROTTEN?

167
00:09:14,711 --> 00:09:17,709
HAVE THEY FORGOTTEN
WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

168
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:20,323
DON'T THEY HAVE
A CONSCIENCE?!

169
00:09:20,323 --> 00:09:22,125
HOW CAN THEY--

170
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:23,708
HOW CAN THEY
DO THIS?

171
00:09:25,261 --> 00:09:27,709
WHY?! [sobs]

172
00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:30,133
THIS IS KAMATA.

173
00:09:30,133 --> 00:09:33,436
I'VE HEARD EVERYTHING
THAT YOU'VE BEEN SAYING.

174
00:09:33,436 --> 00:09:35,338
IS THE PROFESSOR
WITH YOU?

175
00:09:35,338 --> 00:09:38,041
YOU MEAN HE
HASN'T RETURNED
TO BASE YET?

176
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:42,212
HUH? NO, I FIGURED
HE WAS STILL WITH YOU.

177
00:09:42,212 --> 00:09:44,447
OH, NO. WHERE COULD
HE HAVE GONE TO?

178
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:47,117
PROFESSOR SHIBA,
ARE YOU THERE?
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

179
00:09:47,117 --> 00:09:48,710
SAY SOMETHING,
PLEASE!

180
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:49,717
WHERE ARE YOU?

181
00:09:49,717 --> 00:09:51,709
WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?

182
00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:55,325
I AM RESPONSIBLE
FOR ALL THAT
HAS HAPPENED.

183
00:09:55,325 --> 00:09:59,714
IT APPEARS
I OPENED PANDORA'S BOX

184
00:09:59,714 --> 00:10:02,715
AND DIDN'T KNOW
HOW TO CLOSE IT.

185
00:10:02,715 --> 00:10:04,300
YOU'RE WRONG!

186
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,715
EVERYONE'S
RESPONSIBLE
FOR WHAT HAPPENED!

187
00:10:05,715 --> 00:10:07,709
Kamata:
SHE'S RIGHT, PROFESSOR.

188
00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:09,472
YOU CAN'T JUST
TAKE THE BLAME YOURSELF.

189
00:10:09,472 --> 00:10:11,441
Aoi: COME BACK,
PROFESSOR!

190
00:10:11,441 --> 00:10:14,043
CAN'T YOU SEE
HOW WORRIED WE
ALL ARE FOR YOU?

191
00:10:14,043 --> 00:10:16,346
Taeko: I DON'T
THINK YOU SHOULD BE
SO HARD ON YOURSELF.

192
00:10:16,346 --> 00:10:19,416
THANK YOU.
YOUR WORDS MEAN A LOT,

193
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,418
BUT I'VE
MADE UP MY MIND.

194
00:10:21,418 --> 00:10:24,454
AS A SCIENTIST,
I MUST DO WHAT IS RIGHT,

195
00:10:24,454 --> 00:10:28,324
AND THAT IS TO TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY
FOR MY ACTIONS.

196
00:10:28,324 --> 00:10:31,060
KAMATA, I'LL LEAVE
THE REST TO YOU.

197
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,328
P-PROFESSOR!

198
00:10:32,328 --> 00:10:34,330
Ibara: I SHOULDN'T
HAVE LEFT HIM ALONE.

199
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:37,708
DAMN IT.
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING RIGHT!

200
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:40,716
YOU KNOW,
IT ACTUALLY MAKES
A LITTLE BIT OF SENSE.

201
00:10:40,716 --> 00:10:43,708
SACRIFICING THIS CITY
COULD HELP SAVE
THE WORLD.

202
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:46,276
I WOULD TEAR APART
A WORLD LIKE THAT!

203
00:10:46,276 --> 00:10:47,377
[gasps]

204
00:10:47,377 --> 00:10:49,245
REMEMBER THAT
AWFUL-TASTING APPLE?

205
00:10:49,245 --> 00:10:52,714
THAT'S WHAT'S IN STORE
FOR THE FUTURE
YOU DESCRIBE.

206
00:10:52,714 --> 00:10:54,184
IT'S NOT TOO LATE.

207
00:10:54,184 --> 00:10:56,052
WE CAN'T GIVE UP
UNTIL WE TRY

208
00:10:56,052 --> 00:10:58,221
EVERYTHING WE CAN
TO FIX THIS.

209
00:11:03,137 --> 00:11:06,131
Taeko: PROFESSOR,
WHERE ARE YOU?

210
00:11:06,131 --> 00:11:07,581
Aoi: PLEASE COME OUT!

211
00:11:07,581 --> 00:11:10,517
Ibara: THINK. WHERE WOULD
THE PROFESSOR RUN OFF TO?

212
00:11:10,517 --> 00:11:12,131
[radio whines]
THIS IS KAMATA.

213
00:11:12,131 --> 00:11:15,137
GRANNY'S BEEN RAMBLING ON
ABOUT SOMETHING OVER HERE.

214
00:11:15,137 --> 00:11:17,791
THEN LET'S HEAR
WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY.
PUT HER ON.

215
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:20,137
THE PROFESSOR
MIGHT HAVE GONE
TO THE SHRINE

216
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:21,862
SOUTH OF
THE ART MUSEUM.

217
00:11:21,862 --> 00:11:24,130
HE USED TO TAKE ME
DOWN THERE

218
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:26,138
WHENEVER I NEEDED
TO SAY MY PRAYERS.

219
00:11:26,138 --> 00:11:30,771
THAT SHRINE HAS
THE LOVELIEST VIEW
OF THE SUNSET.

220
00:11:30,771 --> 00:11:33,136
I THINK
THE DELIVERYMAN
LIKED IT THERE

221
00:11:33,136 --> 00:11:36,137
EVEN MORE
THAN I DID.

222
00:11:36,137 --> 00:11:38,131
WE'RE HEADING
OVER THERE RIGHT NOW.

223
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:39,880
Mishima:
NARUSE, WE'LL BE THERE

224
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,849
IN APPROXIMATELY
30 MINUTES.

225
00:11:41,849 --> 00:11:45,619
ROGER THAT.
HAVE THE HELICOPTER LAND
OVER AT THE AIR BASE.

226
00:11:45,619 --> 00:11:49,130
LISTEN TO ME. DO NOT
LET THE PROFESSOR DIE.

227
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:51,129
I WANT HIM CAPTURED ALIVE.

228
00:11:51,129 --> 00:11:52,526
CAPTURE HIM ALIVE?

229
00:11:52,526 --> 00:11:54,662
WHY WOULD HE
SAY IT LIKE THAT?

230
00:11:54,662 --> 00:11:56,131
THE VICE PRINCIPAL
STILL SUFFERS

231
00:11:56,131 --> 00:11:58,599
FROM THE LOSS
OF HIS FAMILY
IN THE ACCIDENT.

232
00:11:58,599 --> 00:12:01,502
HIS WIFE
AND HIS LITTLE GIRL
WERE BOTH KILLED.

233
00:12:01,502 --> 00:12:03,470
Ayame: THAT DELIVERYMAN

234
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:07,508
WOULD ALWAYS GIVE UP
HIS TIME TO ESCORT ME
TO THE SHRINE.

235
00:12:07,508 --> 00:12:09,777
HE WOULD EVEN
HELP ME UP THE STAIRS

236
00:12:09,777 --> 00:12:12,133
SINCE I CAN'T MAKE IT
ON MY OWN.

237
00:12:12,133 --> 00:12:14,133
HE NEVER ONCE
UTTERED A COMPLAINT,

238
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:16,134
EVEN THOUGH HE'S
PRETTY OLD HIMSELF.

239
00:12:16,134 --> 00:12:18,719
HONESTLY,
I FEEL BAD FOR HIM.

240
00:12:18,719 --> 00:12:21,522
HE'S ALREADY ATONED
MORE THAN ENOUGH.

241
00:12:21,522 --> 00:12:25,129
I FORGIVE HIM
FOR WHATEVER
HE MIGHT HAVE DONE.

242
00:12:25,129 --> 00:12:28,130
HE DESERVES TO HEAR THAT
IN PERSON, GRANNY.

243
00:12:32,135 --> 00:12:34,435
THIS IS GOOD. IT'S NOT
AS CONTAMINATED HERE

244
00:12:34,435 --> 00:12:36,133
AS I THOUGHT
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN,

245
00:12:36,133 --> 00:12:38,134
AND THERE'S A CHANCE
THE PROFESSOR MIGHT
STILL BE ALIVE.

246
00:12:38,134 --> 00:12:39,540
LET'S SPLIT UP
AND LOOK FOR HIM.

247
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,607
OK.

IT'S IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE.

BEAUTIFUL,
ISN'T IT?

254
00:12:57,825 --> 00:13:01,628
I LOOK AFTER IT
EVERY DAY.

00:13:01,628 --> 00:13:03,664

THE BREEZE
FEELS SO GOOD.

258
00:13:12,129 --> 00:13:14,708
THE SUN'S BRIGHT
AND WARM OUT HERE.

259
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:18,138
I'D FORGOTTEN
JUST HOW LOVELY
IT ALL IS,

YOUR MASK.

HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN SITTING HERE

263
00:13:24,518 --> 00:13:26,129
EXPOSED TO
THE CONTAMINATION?

264
00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:28,136
I TOOK IT OFF
JUST NOW.

265
00:13:28,136 --> 00:13:32,129
I HEARD THE FOOTSTEPS
OF AN ANGEL APPROACHING.

[gasps]

267

GOOD!
YOU FOUND HIM!

Taeko: WHAT'S HE DOING?
WHERE'S HIS MASK?

271
00:13:42,436 --> 00:13:44,772
I GAVE HIM THAT SHOT
OF AETHER EARLIER,

272
00:13:44,772 --> 00:13:47,135
SO THE CONTAMINANTS
HAVEN'T TAKEN
EFFECT JUST YET.

WE'VE GOTTA GET
BACK TO BASE. HURRY!

WHAT'S WRONG?
DID YOU FIND THE PROFESSOR?

TO MEET US

THE PROFESSOR
TOOK OFF HIS MASK.

HE HAS 10 MINUTES
UNTIL THE AETHER
WEARS OFF.

JUST NINE MINUTES.

FULL SPEED!

WE SHOULD PUT THE MASK

BACK ON THE PROFESSOR,

THERE'S NO USE
AT THIS POINT.

THIS IS HOW IT SHOULD BE.

I CAN SENSE THAT MY BODY
IS BEGINNING TO BREAK DOWN

DUE TO THE CONTAMINATION.

WHY'D YOU DO
SUCH A THING?

WHERE IS
THE HELICOPTER?

HE WAS ALSO A VICTIM
OF THAT ACCIDENT

00:15:19,136 --> 00:15:22,133
AND SUFFERED A GREAT LOSS
NO MAN SHOULD BEAR.

310
00:15:22,133 --> 00:15:23,737
I HEARD YOU EARLIER,

00:15:23,737 --> 00:15:26,740
HOW HE LOST
HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER.

IT'S AS THOUGH
I KILLED THEM.

I WISH I COULD TURN BACK
THE HANDS OF TIME

STILL FULL OF HOPE.

HE IS HERE ON A MISSION.

AS A SELF-DEFENSE FORCE
MEMBER,

HIS JOB IS
TO PROTECT PEOPLE.

321
00:15:51,832 --> 00:15:53,734
THAT'S WHY
HE'S HEADED THIS WAY.

WE ADULTS COMMITTED
MANY ERRORS IN OUR TIME.

00:19:21,129 --> 00:19:23,129
YOUR GENERATION
IS BURDENED

363
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:25,129
WITH A SORROW
OF OUR MAKING.

364
00:19:25,129 --> 00:19:27,136
IT'S QUITE A MESS
WE'VE CREATED,

AND YOU'RE FORCED
TO CLEAN IT UP AFTER US.

PROFESSOR SHIBA,

369
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:39,135
IT'S NEITHER
MY PLACE TO JUDGE

370
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:41,728
NOR TO TRY
TO ASSIGN ANY BLAME.

I DON'T EVEN FULLY
UNDERSTAND THE ISSUES,

BUT THERE IS SOMETHING
I DO KNOW.

373
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,603
THE SKY IS
BEAUTIFUL AGAIN TODAY.

374

IT MAKES ME HAPPY.

OF PEOPLE WHO'VE STAYED BEHIND
IN THE OLD CAPITAL.

PLEASE USE YOUR ABILITIES
TO SAVE THEM.

MR. VICE PRINCIPAL,

384
00:20:15,135 --> 00:20:17,697
THOSE GIRLS
HAVE TAUGHT ME

00:20:17,697 --> 00:20:20,700
WHAT IT REALLY MEANS
TO BE HUMAN.

JUST THE THREE OF US AGAIN.

SHOOT! YOU KNOW WHAT
I SHOULD HAVE ASKED FOR?

391
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,560
A NEW R.V.
TO GET AROUND THE CITY,

392
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,562
BECAUSE THERE ARE A TON
OF NAMES IN THIS BOOK,

393
00:20:48,562 --> 00:20:52,532
AND THAT MEANS WE'RE
GOING TO HAVE TO COVER
A LOT OF GROUND ON FOOT.

394
00:20:52,532 --> 00:20:54,136
OH, WELL, THEN.

395
00:20:54,136 --> 00:20:56,703
ALL THIS WALKING IS
GOOD FOR OUR HEALTH
AFTER ALL, YOU KNOW.

396
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:59,130
WE'LL TAKE OUR TIME
AND DO SOME SIGHTSEEING.

IS GOING TO BE
THE CENTER OF THE CITY.

TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

YOU CAN STOP TRYING
SO HARD ALL OF THE TIME.

WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
TALKING ABOUT?

401
00:21:09,783 --> 00:21:12,129
I HAVEN'T BEEN
TRYING TOO HARD.

402
00:21:12,129 --> 00:21:13,134
THAT'S ENOUGH.

NOT BE AS STRONG

AS YOU ARE,

408

BUT THERE'S
SOMETHING
I REALIZED TODAY.

YOU'RE
NOT INVINCIBLE.

410

SOMETIMES EVEN
YOU COULD USE
A LITTLE HELP.

YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE ON
ALL THIS BY YOURSELF.

TAEKO IS RIGHT.
