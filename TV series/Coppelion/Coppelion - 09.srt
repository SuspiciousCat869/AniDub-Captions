THIS IS ALL
THE CABLING?

THERE'S NO WAY
THAT THIS
IS ENOUGH

TO REACH
ALL THE WAY TO

YOU'RE RIGHT
ABOUT THAT.

THAT'S WHY WE HAVE
A DIFFERENT PLAN.

WAIT. DIDN'T YOU KNOW?

ABOUT ELECTRICAL STUFF.

DID YOU DO BEFORE
THE ACCIDENT?

IN THE PAST.

UP AT THE SKY, ISN'T IT?

EVEN THOUGH I KNOW
IT'S ALL ARTIFICIAL,

THE IMPACT IS REAL.

00:09:14,528 --> 00:09:17,196
MAYBE SINCE IT'S
MY LAST TIME SEEING IT,

202
00:09:17,196 --> 00:09:19,525
I THINK IT LOOKS
MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN EVER.

I KNOW THAT FEELING
VERY WELL.

SEND-OFF CEREMONY.

UP TO THAT POINT,
I HAD BEEN DYING TO GET
OUT OF THAT PLACE.

OUTSIDE THOSE GATES.

[components rattling]

316
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:28,494
HARUTO.

317
00:13:28,494 --> 00:13:31,015
NARUSE. HEY.

318
00:13:31,015 --> 00:13:32,493
WHAT'S GOING ON?

319
00:13:32,493 --> 00:13:34,219
YOU LOOK GROUCHY.

320
00:13:34,219 --> 00:13:36,487
I'M NOT.
I JUST WANT TO KNOW

321
00:13:36,487 --> 00:13:38,089
IF YOU'RE
REALLY ON OUR SIDE.

322
00:13:38,089 --> 00:13:41,092
WE NEED TO GET THAT
OUT IN THE OPEN
RIGHT NOW.

323
00:13:41,092 --> 00:13:44,494
HONESTLY, I'M NOT SURE
ABOUT IT MYSELF.

324
00:13:44,494 --> 00:13:48,133
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'D GO THIS FAR
TO SAVE THOSE HUMANS.

325
00:13:48,133 --> 00:13:50,168
WHAT GOOD
DOES IT DO FOR US?

326
00:13:51,202 --> 00:13:52,904
IF I HAD TO GIVE A REASON

327
00:13:52,904 --> 00:13:54,939
WHY I'M HELPING YOU
DESPITE MY FEELINGS,

328
00:13:54,939 --> 00:13:57,842
WELL, I GUESS IT'D BE
BECAUSE I WANT TO SPEND

329
00:13:57,842 --> 00:14:00,491
MORE TIME WITH HUMANS,
UNDERSTANDING THEM.

330
00:14:00,491 --> 00:14:03,882
Ibara: WOW. LOOK AT ALL
THE STARS IN THE SKY.

331
00:14:03,882 --> 00:14:05,491
ARE THESE
ALL PROJECTIONS?

332
00:14:05,491 --> 00:14:07,218
Kurobe: WOULD YOU
LOOK AT THIS?

333
00:14:07,218 --> 00:14:09,187
YOU PULLED OUT ALL
THE STOPS TONIGHT,

334
00:14:09,187 --> 00:14:10,491
HAVEN'T YOU,
NO-SENSE?

335
00:14:10,491 --> 00:14:13,488
I ASKED HIM
TO DO THIS
FOR US, FOREMAN.

336
00:14:13,488 --> 00:14:15,026
Ibuki:
AFTER ALL, THIS IS

337
00:14:15,026 --> 00:14:17,128
OUR LAST DINNER PARTY
AT THE PLANET.

338
00:14:17,128 --> 00:14:18,491
YOU'RE RIGHT, IBUKI.

339
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:21,494
OK, THEN. LET'S EAT UP
AS MUCH AS WE CAN

340
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:23,490
SO WE'RE READY
FOR TOMORROW!

341
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,488
ALL RIGHT,
NOW YOU'RE TALKING!

342
00:14:25,488 --> 00:14:28,487
[laughter]

343
00:14:33,487 --> 00:14:35,914
WOW. THESE RICE BALLS
ARE DELICIOUS.

344
00:14:35,914 --> 00:14:37,496
SURE ARE.

345
00:14:37,496 --> 00:14:38,983
HUH?

346
00:14:40,018 --> 00:14:42,020
HMM?

347
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,087
[groans]

348
00:14:44,222 --> 00:14:46,488
WHAT?
WHAT'S WRONG?

349
00:14:46,488 --> 00:14:47,496
IT'S
SO MUCH EASIER

350
00:14:47,496 --> 00:14:49,794
TO GET NUTRITION
THIS WAY.

351
00:14:49,794 --> 00:14:50,829
DON'T BE LIKE THAT

352
00:14:50,829 --> 00:14:52,997
WITHOUT TRYING
SOMETHING FIRST.

353
00:14:52,997 --> 00:14:55,200
IT'S DELICIOUS,
I PROMISE.

354
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,136
NO, THANKS.
HUMAN FOOD'S
NOT REALLY MY THING.

355
00:14:58,136 --> 00:15:01,206
WHAT'D YOU SAY,
YOU COCKY LITTLE
BASTARD?

356
00:15:01,206 --> 00:15:02,207
THAT'S IT.

357
00:15:02,207 --> 00:15:04,142
HOLD
THE KID DOWN!

358
00:15:04,142 --> 00:15:05,977
GIVE HIM
A TASTE OF SOME
HUMAN FOOD.

359
00:15:05,977 --> 00:15:08,079
STOP IT! STOP IT!
LET ME DOWN!

360
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,491
YEAH. THAT'LL
TEACH YOU.

361
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:10,949
COME ON AND EAT.

362
00:15:10,949 --> 00:15:13,487
IT'LL MAKE YOU
BIG AND STRONG,
PREPPY.

363
00:15:13,487 --> 00:15:14,853
[laughs]

364
00:15:14,853 --> 00:15:16,120
I MISS AOI.

365
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,189
I WISH SHE
WOULD COME JOIN US
FOR DINNER.

366
00:15:18,189 --> 00:15:19,489
Taeko: ME, TOO.

367
00:15:19,489 --> 00:15:21,192
YOU KNOW
SHE'D LOVE THE FOOD.

368
00:15:21,192 --> 00:15:22,491
[grumbles]

369
00:15:22,491 --> 00:15:23,493
HMM.
EH?

370
00:15:23,493 --> 00:15:25,496
THIS ISN'T SO BAD.

371
00:15:25,496 --> 00:15:27,832
[laughs]

372
00:15:27,832 --> 00:15:29,100
YOU SEE THERE?

373
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,002
ISN'T HAVING
A MEAL TOGETHER
WORTH IT

374
00:15:31,002 --> 00:15:32,170
AND TASTY, TOO?

375
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:34,491
Aoi:
THOSE RICE BALLS...

376
00:15:34,491 --> 00:15:36,975
I WAS THE ONE
WHO MADE THEM.

377
00:15:36,975 --> 00:15:39,811
DID YOU THINK
THEY WERE OK?

378
00:15:39,811 --> 00:15:40,845
[gasps]

379
00:15:40,845 --> 00:15:42,491
THEY WERE DELICIOUS,
OF COURSE.

380
00:15:42,491 --> 00:15:43,815
NO KIDDING.

381
00:15:43,815 --> 00:15:45,496
ANYONE CAN MAKE
SIMPLE RICE BALLS,

382
00:15:45,496 --> 00:15:46,985
AND THEY'LL TASTE
JUST FINE--

383
00:15:46,985 --> 00:15:47,986
[grunts]

384
00:15:49,493 --> 00:15:50,788
COME ON, AOI.

385
00:15:50,788 --> 00:15:53,157
YOU SHOULD
SIT DOWN
AND JOIN US.

386
00:15:53,157 --> 00:15:54,792
[crying]
IBARA!

00:15:54,792 --> 00:15:55,927

00:15:55,927 --> 00:15:57,795
[laughter]

00:15:57,795 --> 00:15:59,964
Aoi: I MISSED YOU.

390
00:16:03,167 --> 00:16:04,802
[radio whines]

391
00:16:04,802 --> 00:16:07,495
Ayame:
ARE THE CONTRACTIONS
GETTING CLOSER TOGETHER?

392
00:16:07,495 --> 00:16:10,494
YEAH. THEY'RE
AROUND 10 MINUTES
APART NOW.

393
00:16:10,494 --> 00:16:12,210
[snoring]
HER WATER'LL BREAK SOON,

394
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:13,945
SO BE READY FOR THAT.

395
00:16:13,945 --> 00:16:16,491
MOVE HER
INTO THE DELIVERY ROOM
BEFORE THEN.

396
00:16:16,491 --> 00:16:19,083
ALL RIGHT, NARUSE,
HERE'S HOW OUR PLAN

397
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,491
IS GOING TO GO
MOVING FORWARD.

398
00:16:21,491 --> 00:16:23,494
AFTER THE TRAIN
MAKES ITS DESTINATION--

399
00:16:23,494 --> 00:16:25,494
ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?

400
00:16:25,494 --> 00:16:28,492
THE HELICOPTER
WILL SHOW UP THERE
TO RESCUE US, RIGHT?

401
00:16:28,492 --> 00:16:30,862
THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A PERFECT PLAN TO ME.

402
00:16:30,862 --> 00:16:32,196
Ibuki: WAIT.
HUH?

403
00:16:32,196 --> 00:16:34,999
MISS IBUKI,
WHAT IS IT?

404
00:16:34,999 --> 00:16:37,001
I NEED YOU TO...

405
00:16:37,001 --> 00:16:39,003
SAVE ONE MORE PERSON
FOR ME.

406
00:16:39,003 --> 00:16:40,204
HUH?
HUH?

407
00:16:40,204 --> 00:16:41,491
[neighs]

408
00:16:41,491 --> 00:16:44,491
YOU GOTTA GET IN THERE.
COME ON. GET IN.

409
00:16:44,491 --> 00:16:46,177
SAY, MR. GENNAI...
EH?

410
00:16:46,177 --> 00:16:48,046
ARE YOU REALLY
TRYING TO TAKE

411
00:16:48,046 --> 00:16:49,948
ALL THESE ANIMALS
WITH US, TOO?

412
00:16:49,948 --> 00:16:51,115
YOU BETCHA.

413
00:16:51,115 --> 00:16:53,084
IF I LEAVE THEM
HERE AT THE PLANET,

414
00:16:53,084 --> 00:16:54,919
THEY'LL BE SWALLOWED UP
BY THE ZONE,

415
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:56,054
AND THEY'LL ALL DIE,

416
00:16:56,054 --> 00:16:58,022
SO I ASKED KUROBE
TO BUILD A SHELTER

417
00:16:58,022 --> 00:17:00,124
FOR ALL THE ANIMALS
TO USE AS WELL.

418
00:17:00,124 --> 00:17:02,193
OH. THERE ARE SO MANY.

419
00:17:02,193 --> 00:17:03,494
THAT'S COOL.

420
00:17:03,494 --> 00:17:04,494
IT'S LIKE...

421
00:17:04,494 --> 00:17:05,997
HMM?
HMM?

422
00:17:05,997 --> 00:17:08,099
IT'S LIKE
THE STORY
OF NOAH'S ARK.

423
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:10,101
NOAH'S FAMILY
GATHERED UP

424
00:17:10,101 --> 00:17:11,869
ALL THE ANIMALS
TWO BY TWO

425
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:13,972
AND PUT THEM
IN THE ARK HE BUILT.

426
00:17:13,972 --> 00:17:16,107
THEY BECAME
THE GUARDIANS
OF THE NEW WORLD.

427
00:17:16,107 --> 00:17:18,209
WOW. GUARDIANS
OF THE NEW WORLD?

428
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:20,945
YES, THOUGH ONLY
LIVING CREATURES

429
00:17:20,945 --> 00:17:22,914
ARE ALLOWED
IN THAT ARRANGEMENT.

430
00:17:22,914 --> 00:17:24,493
HUH?
ROBOTS MUST REMAIN

431
00:17:24,493 --> 00:17:26,117
IN THE WORLD THAT
WILL BE DESTROYED.

432
00:17:26,117 --> 00:17:28,496
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

433
00:17:28,496 --> 00:17:30,989
DID THEY REALLY SAY
THAT THEY'RE JUST GOING

434
00:17:30,989 --> 00:17:32,890
TO LEAVE YOU BEHIND
ALL ALONE?

435
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,489
THAT'S AWFUL, NO-SENSE.

436
00:17:34,489 --> 00:17:37,489
I WON'T LET THEM DO THAT.
COME WITH US!

437
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:39,489
IF I JOINED YOU
ON YOUR MISSION,

438
00:17:39,489 --> 00:17:41,496
I WOULD ONLY SERVE
TO SLOW YOU DOWN.

439
00:17:41,496 --> 00:17:43,234
I AM A GUIDE ROBOT

440
00:17:43,234 --> 00:17:45,203
DESIGNED TO EXIST
AT THE PLANET.

441
00:17:45,203 --> 00:17:47,805
MY PURPOSE
HAS COME TO AN END.

442
00:17:47,805 --> 00:17:49,007
THAT'S NOT TRUE!

443
00:17:49,007 --> 00:17:50,489
YOU'RE A LIVING BEING

444
00:17:50,489 --> 00:17:51,976
WITH A GENTLE HEART!

445
00:17:55,246 --> 00:17:57,491
Ibara: A FIRST DIVISION
SOLDIER?

446
00:17:57,491 --> 00:17:59,250
JUST HANG ON
A MINUTE.

447
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,953
ARE YOU SAYING THIS PERSON
YOU WANT US TO SAVE

448
00:18:01,953 --> 00:18:03,788
IS A MEMBER
OF THE FIRST DIVISION?

449
00:18:03,788 --> 00:18:05,490
[pants]
YES.

450
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,491
HE'S NOT
A BAD PERSON.

451
00:18:07,491 --> 00:18:09,494
I'M SURE HE'S STILL
SOMEWHERE NEARBY.

452
00:18:09,494 --> 00:18:12,797
PLEASE, YOU HAVE
TO SAVE HIM.

453
00:18:12,797 --> 00:18:15,233
YOU'RE REALLY
ASKING A LOT OF US,
YOU KNOW.

454
00:18:15,233 --> 00:18:17,201
WHY IS HE
SO IMPORTANT TO YOU?

455
00:18:17,201 --> 00:18:19,003
BECAUSE HE'S
THIS CHILD'S FATHER.

456
00:18:19,003 --> 00:18:20,004
WHAT?
[gasps]

457
00:18:20,004 --> 00:18:21,494
YOU KNOW WHAT?

458
00:18:21,494 --> 00:18:23,141
I MAY HAVE MET
THIS GUY.

459
00:18:23,141 --> 00:18:24,491
WHERE?!

460
00:18:24,491 --> 00:18:26,911
AT THE WATER
TREATMENT FACILITY.

461
00:18:26,911 --> 00:18:29,013
WHEN I WAS
BEING HELD,

462
00:18:29,013 --> 00:18:31,215
ONE OF THE SOLDIERS
HELPED ME ESCAPE.

463
00:18:31,215 --> 00:18:34,018
THAT'S EXACTLY
SOMETHING HE'D DO.

464
00:18:34,018 --> 00:18:37,489
PLEASE, WILL YOU
FIND HIM FOR ME?

465
00:18:37,489 --> 00:18:39,857
WELL, HE DID
HELP AOI OUT.

466
00:18:39,857 --> 00:18:43,194
I GUESS IT WOULD BE
A GOOD THING
TO REPAY HIM.

467
00:18:43,194 --> 00:18:45,495
Kurobe: OK,
THE MAINTENANCE TEAM

468
00:18:45,495 --> 00:18:47,491
IS READY TO MOVE OUT.

469
00:18:47,491 --> 00:18:50,201
Ibara: ROGER.
LET'S DO A FINAL
HEAD COUNT.

470
00:18:50,201 --> 00:18:52,490
Kurobe: 1, 2, 3--

471
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:54,487
HUH? WHERE'D GENNAI GO?

472
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:58,487
I'M GONNA MISS YOU,
NO-SENSE.

LET THEM REST

ON THE VERGE

AND JUST HOW DO YOU
EXPECT ME TO CALM DOWN?

517
00:20:34,005 --> 00:20:37,008
SOME UNIDENTIFIED,
PROBABLY CRAZY PERSON

518
00:20:37,008 --> 00:20:40,111
IS SENDING ME
STRANGE MESSAGES
FROM THE OLD CAPITAL

I GAVE HER ACCESS
TO YOUR LINE TO USE
IN AN EMERGENCY.

00:20:48,488 --> 00:20:50,487
WHAT DID SHE SAY
IN THE MESSAGES?

523
00:20:50,487 --> 00:20:51,496
BUT, VICE PRINCIPAL,

524
00:20:51,496 --> 00:20:54,488
THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
MY OWN PRIVATE LINE.

WHY WOULD SHE BE
TRYING TO CONTACT US

USING THAT FATSO'S LINE,
ANYWAY?

WHY DIDN'T SHE USE HERS?

HAS A GOOD REASON
FOR NOT USING IT.
