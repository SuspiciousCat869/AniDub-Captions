AN IDENTICAL COPY

WE COPPELION
ARE ALL CLONES

THEN THEY WERE STORED
IN AN INVENTORY

00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:53,889
BACK TO THE PLANET,
GENNAI.

161
00:08:53,889 --> 00:08:55,887
CONSIDER IT DONE.

162
00:08:57,882 --> 00:08:59,888
Kurobe:
HEY, KID, YOU THERE?

163
00:08:59,888 --> 00:09:01,442
YES. WHAT IS IT?

164
00:09:01,442 --> 00:09:03,244
WE'VE GOT
A BIG PROBLEM.

165
00:09:03,244 --> 00:09:05,613
THOSE NUTSO SISTERS
AND THE FIRST DIVISION

166
00:09:05,613 --> 00:09:07,615
HAVE CAPTURED
YOUR LITTLE FRIEND HERE.

167
00:09:07,615 --> 00:09:09,383
[groans]
OZU SISTERS,

168
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:11,880
DON'T YOU KNOW
THEY'RE JUST USING YOU?

169
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,885
LISTEN TO ME.

170
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,885
THE FIRST DIVISION
HAS PUT TOGETHER

171
00:09:14,885 --> 00:09:16,223
A PLAN TO...

172
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:18,359
COLLECT ALL
THE OLD CAPITAL'S WASTE.

173
00:09:18,359 --> 00:09:21,887
THEN THEY'LL PUT THAT WASTE
AROUND THE OUTSIDE
OF THE SARCOPHAGUS,

174
00:09:21,887 --> 00:09:24,331
WHICH ITSELF
WILL BE STUFFED

175
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:26,634
WITH EVERY PIECE
OF DYNAMITE THEY HAVE,

176
00:09:26,634 --> 00:09:28,369
AND BLOW THE PLACE UP.

177
00:09:28,369 --> 00:09:31,605
AND THEN THE ENTIRE WORLD
SUCCUMBS TO CONTAMINATION,

178
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:33,881
AND EVERYONE DIES.

179
00:09:33,881 --> 00:09:35,883
IF YOU KNOW ALL THAT,
THEN WHY ARE--

180
00:09:35,883 --> 00:09:37,211
[clink]

181
00:09:37,211 --> 00:09:39,313
ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?

182
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:41,282
ONCE MANKIND
IS OBLITERATED,

183
00:09:41,282 --> 00:09:43,886
THE WORLD WILL BELONG
TO US COPPELION.

184
00:09:43,886 --> 00:09:46,884
WE'RE THE MOST SUPERIOR
RACE EVER.

185
00:09:46,884 --> 00:09:49,523
HOW'S THAT FOR
THE MOST CHEESIEST
LINE, SHION?

186
00:09:49,523 --> 00:09:51,258
[both laughing]
GOOD ONE!

187
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:53,394
LET'S TAKE OVER
THE WORLD!

188
00:09:53,394 --> 00:09:55,884
[laughing]

189
00:09:55,884 --> 00:09:57,431
HONESTLY,
THE TWO OF US

190
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:59,366
ARE IN A BAD MOOD
TODAY,

191
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:01,302
SO I'LL END THIS
RIGHT NOW.

192
00:10:01,302 --> 00:10:02,536
THIS IS BAD.

193
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:03,884
SHE'S GONNA
GET KILLED.

194
00:10:03,884 --> 00:10:04,888
WAIT A MINUTE.

195
00:10:04,888 --> 00:10:06,473
I THINK THAT NARUSE
MIGHT HAVE

196
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:08,881
ONE OF MY NEWEST GRENADES
WITH HER IN HER PACK.

197
00:10:08,881 --> 00:10:10,444
Kurobe:
YOUR NEWEST WHAT?

198
00:10:11,881 --> 00:10:14,880
Ibara:
3, 2, 1...

199
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,880
ZERO!

200
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:20,354
[squeals] MY EARS!

201
00:10:20,354 --> 00:10:23,457
IT'S AN ULTRASONIC
GRENADE! DAMN IT!

202
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:25,626
I GUESS SHE HAD ONE
OF THOSE, ALL RIGHT.

203
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:27,885
YEAH, AND IT
SURE DOES WORK.

204
00:10:31,886 --> 00:10:33,880
EAT THIS.

205
00:10:34,889 --> 00:10:36,637
THIS WAY, IBARA.

206
00:10:39,573 --> 00:10:41,375
GUESS WE'RE
PLAYING TAG.

207
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,277
NOW I'M
REALLY PISSED.

208
00:10:43,277 --> 00:10:44,511
Soldier:
NEVER MIND THEM.

209
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:45,880
HUH?
HUH?

210
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,448
THOSE SURVIVORS
CAN'T GO ANYWHERE

211
00:10:47,448 --> 00:10:49,880
SINCE YOU'VE SURROUNDED
THIS AREA WITH WASTE.

212
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,585
YOU SHOULD USE
THIS OPPORTUNITY

213
00:10:51,585 --> 00:10:53,354
TO HEAD
FOR THE SARCOPHAGUS.

214
00:10:53,354 --> 00:10:55,623
HUH?
HMM?

215
00:10:55,623 --> 00:10:58,325
AND YOU SHOULD
SHUT UP, MORON.

216
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:00,327
WE ARE NOT
GOING ANYWHERE

217
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:02,886
UNTIL WE KILL
EVERY LAST ONE OF THEM.

218
00:11:02,886 --> 00:11:04,365
[panting]

219
00:11:04,365 --> 00:11:06,888
HEY, WHAT'S
TAKING YOU
SO LONG, GENNAI?

220
00:11:06,888 --> 00:11:09,470
SHH. BE QUIET.

221
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,888
LOOK OVER THERE.

222
00:11:14,475 --> 00:11:16,881
THIS DAY KEEPS
GETTING BETTER,
DOESN'T IT?

223
00:11:16,881 --> 00:11:18,579
THEY'RE TRYING
TO TRAP US HERE

224
00:11:18,579 --> 00:11:20,381
TO BUY
THEMSELVES
MORE TIME!

225
00:11:20,381 --> 00:11:21,881
IBARA,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

226
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:22,883
YOU'RE CRAZY!

227
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:25,882
WOULD YOU STOP
BEING SO RECKLESS?

228
00:11:25,882 --> 00:11:26,884
Soldier: FIRE!

229

SHE OVERTOOK
THE TANK!

00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:37,886
WAY TO GO!

233
00:11:37,886 --> 00:11:39,888
OK, EVERYBODY IN.

234
00:11:39,888 --> 00:11:41,568
[motorcycle roaring]
EH?

235
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:42,889
HEY!

236
00:11:42,889 --> 00:11:45,889
LET'S PLAY
A GAME OF TAG!

237
00:11:45,889 --> 00:11:47,887
Kurobe:
STEP ON IT, GENNAI!

238
00:11:49,883 --> 00:11:50,885
IT'S NO USE.

239
00:11:50,885 --> 00:11:52,579
THEY'RE GAINING
ON US FAST!

240
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:53,883
WHAT SHOULD WE DO?

241
00:11:53,883 --> 00:11:55,887
WE'VE GOTTA TRY
SOMETHING QUICK.

242
00:11:55,887 --> 00:11:58,352
HAVING THIS TANK
SHOULD HELP,
AT LEAST.

243
00:11:58,352 --> 00:11:59,886
W-WHAT?

244
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:01,455
THIS ENDS...

245
00:12:01,455 --> 00:12:03,624
RIGHT NOW!

246
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,272
EAT THIS!

247
00:12:12,272 --> 00:12:14,174
YOU'RE GOING
TO END THIS NOW?

248
00:12:14,174 --> 00:12:15,531
HOW DO YOU PLAN
ON DOING THAT?

249
00:12:17,911 --> 00:12:19,523
DOES
THE CANNON WORK?

250
00:12:19,523 --> 00:12:20,980
YOU MEAN THIS?

251
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,529
HEY, HURRY,
AND DO SOMETHING.

252
00:12:25,522 --> 00:12:26,525
DAMN.

253
00:12:26,525 --> 00:12:28,955
LOOK FOR
SOME CANNON SHELLS.

254
00:12:28,955 --> 00:12:29,989
CANNON SHELLS?

255
00:12:29,989 --> 00:12:31,257
YAH!

256
00:12:32,526 --> 00:12:34,528
I DON'T SEE ANY
OVER HERE, IBARA.

257
00:12:34,528 --> 00:12:36,963
HEY, I FOUND SOMETHING.
IS THIS ONE?

258
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,169

GOT IT.
HUH?

266
00:13:01,221 --> 00:13:02,856
I FOUND SOME SHELLS
DOWN HERE.

267
00:13:02,856 --> 00:13:05,522
OK, GENNAI,
WE'RE LOCKED
AND LOADED.

YOU PUNCHED THROUGH
A HYDROGEN TANK.

274
00:13:23,243 --> 00:13:26,112
YOU NEED TO LEARN
HOW TO CONTROL
YOUR OWN STRENGTH.

AH, HELL, YEAH.

00:13:41,261 --> 00:13:43,525
THAT SHOULD
TAKE CARE
OF THOSE TWO.

00:13:43,525 --> 00:13:44,864
I DON'T KNOW,
THOUGH.

282
00:13:44,864 --> 00:13:47,525
DO YOU THINK
THAT WE OVERDID
IT A LITTLE?

283
00:13:47,525 --> 00:13:48,527
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

ONLY AN INSTANT,

BUT THE OZU SISTERS
ARE DEFINITELY

NOW YOU'VE DONE IT.

YOU'VE REALLY
PISSED ME OFF.

293
00:14:05,118 --> 00:14:07,887
SO WHAT'S
HER SPECIAL ABILITY?

DON'T KNOW.

W-WHAT WAS THAT?

300
00:14:26,528 --> 00:14:29,242
IS THAT
HER SPECIAL ABILITY,

301
00:14:29,242 --> 00:14:30,528
SHOOTING
ELECTRICITY?

THINKING?

305
00:14:41,921 --> 00:14:43,526
THEY SHOULD HAVE
THOUGHT TWICE

306
00:14:43,526 --> 00:14:45,892
ABOUT MESSING WITH
MY BODY LIKE THIS.

307

IN ORDER TO GET
THE RESCUE TEAMS

TO THE SITE
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE,

309
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:52,232
THEY HAD NO CHOICE
BUT TO PUSH THE BOUNDARIES

310
00:14:52,232 --> 00:14:53,531
AND TIMING
OF THEIR RESEARCH.

311
00:14:53,531 --> 00:14:56,035
THERE GOAL WAS
TO SAVE LIVES.

00:15:23,263 --> 00:15:25,164
WE'RE MANUFACTURED
AND USED UP

321
00:15:25,164 --> 00:15:26,526
WITHOUT
A SECOND THOUGHT,

322
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:28,835
AND THEN WHEN WE'RE
OF NO USE ANYMORE...

323
00:15:31,523 --> 00:15:33,973
Haruto:
SO HOW LONG
WILL WE LIVE?

324
00:15:33,973 --> 00:15:34,974
HUH?

325
00:15:34,974 --> 00:15:36,276
Mishima:
WE'RE NOT SURE.

326
00:15:36,276 --> 00:15:38,523
NOW IT'S ALL STARTING
TO MAKE SOME SENSE,

327
00:15:38,523 --> 00:15:40,526
THE REASON WHY
YOU AND YOUR SCIENTISTS

328
00:15:40,526 --> 00:15:42,882
DECIDED TO GIVE US
THE NAME COPPELION.

329
00:15:42,882 --> 00:15:44,530
IT'S SO THAT
WHEN WE DIE OFF,

330
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:47,530
NONE OF YOU
WILL HAVE TO FEEL
ANY REMORSE OR GUILT.

331
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:50,056
AT SOME POINT,
WE'LL JUST DROP DEAD

332
00:15:50,056 --> 00:15:52,258
LIKE A LAB RAT
DURING A TEST.

333
00:15:52,258 --> 00:15:56,527
Kanon: DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT THAT MEANS,
IBARA NARUSE?

334
00:15:56,527 --> 00:15:58,965
WE COPPELION ARE ALL
CONDEMNED TO DIE

335
00:15:58,965 --> 00:16:00,529
SUDDENLY AND
WITHOUT ANY WARNING.

336
00:16:02,168 --> 00:16:04,527
IT'LL JUST HAPPEN
ONE DAY.

337
00:16:04,527 --> 00:16:07,273
THE WARMTH
IN OUR BODIES
WILL LEAVE US.

338
00:16:07,273 --> 00:16:10,176
IT COULD BE
NEXT YEAR,
NEXT WEEK,

339
00:16:10,176 --> 00:16:12,530
OR IT COULD EVEN
HAPPEN TONIGHT,

340
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:14,527
AND THAT'S IT.
WE'RE DONE.

341
00:16:14,527 --> 00:16:18,117
NO ONE KNOWS
HOW LONG WE'LL
BE ALIVE.

342
00:16:18,117 --> 00:16:19,986
IT CAN'T BE.
HMM?

343
00:16:19,986 --> 00:16:21,524
DID THEY
REALLY SAY THAT,

344
00:16:21,524 --> 00:16:24,123
BOTH HARUTO AND
THE VICE PRINCIPAL?

345
00:16:25,522 --> 00:16:27,193
DO YOU
UNDERSTAND IT NOW?

346
00:16:27,193 --> 00:16:29,896
WE ARE AT WAR
WITH HUMANITY.

347
00:16:29,896 --> 00:16:32,526
EITHER WE'LL BE
THE ONES TO DIE FIRST,

348
00:16:32,526 --> 00:16:36,169
OR WE DESTROY THEM
BEFORE WE LET THAT
HAPPEN.

349
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:38,524
YOU SHOULD REALLY
CONSIDER JOINING US.

350
00:16:38,524 --> 00:16:40,139
IT WOULD BE SO GREAT.

351
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:41,525
WITH OUR
COMBINED EFFORTS,

352
00:16:41,525 --> 00:16:43,276
WE'D BE
AN UNSTOPPABLE FORCE.

353
00:16:43,276 --> 00:16:46,245
WE CAN KILL
THE VICE PRINCIPAL
TOGETHER.

354
00:16:46,245 --> 00:16:47,528
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

355
00:16:47,528 --> 00:16:49,182
I REFUSE!

356
00:16:49,182 --> 00:16:51,150
WHAT?

357
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,251
IT'S THEIR FAULT.

358
00:16:52,251 --> 00:16:54,120
HOW CAN YOU?

359
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,530
IT'S THE HUMANS
WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE
FOR OUR PITIFUL FATE.

360
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:00,026
[sighs]
IT'S INEVITABLE.

361
00:17:01,127 --> 00:17:03,096
ALL LIVING THINGS
WILL DIE.

362
00:17:03,096 --> 00:17:05,522
THERE'S NOTHING
WE CAN DO ABOUT IT.

363
00:17:09,268 --> 00:17:11,270
GOD, YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

364
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:14,524
IT'S NOT LIKE DEATH
WILL GREET US PEACEFULLY

365
00:17:14,524 --> 00:17:16,522
WHILE WE'RE LYING
IN OUR BEDS, YOU KNOW.

366
00:17:16,522 --> 00:17:18,144
GET REAL!

367
00:17:18,144 --> 00:17:20,279
THAT MORNING OF OUR
SEND-OFF CEREMONY,

368
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:23,116
I DON'T KNOW WHY,
BUT I HAD A FEELING

369
00:17:23,116 --> 00:17:24,984
I'D NEVER RETURN
TO OSAKA AGAIN.

370
00:17:24,984 --> 00:17:27,528
MAYBE IT WAS
MY DNA TELLING ME

371
00:17:27,528 --> 00:17:30,056
THAT I DIDN'T
HAVE THAT MUCH TIME
LEFT TO LIVE.

372
00:17:30,056 --> 00:17:31,157
HMM.
OH.

373
00:17:31,157 --> 00:17:33,523
SO IF WHAT YOU SAY
IS TRUE, KANON,

374
00:17:33,523 --> 00:17:36,029
THEN I'LL LIVE MY LIFE
TO THE FULLEST HERE.

375
00:17:36,029 --> 00:17:38,131
THAT WILL BE
GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.

376
00:17:40,967 --> 00:17:43,970
THAT WOULD
NEVER WORK FOR ME.

377
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:46,527
LOOK AT THIS FILTHY,
CONTAMINATED CITY,

378
00:17:46,527 --> 00:17:49,275
THIS GODFORSAKEN PLACE
THAT HUMANS FEAR.

379
00:17:49,275 --> 00:17:52,529
I WANT THE WHOLE WORLD
TO END UP LIKE THIS.

380
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:55,181
UNTIL I
MAKE THAT HAPPEN,

381
00:17:55,181 --> 00:17:57,183
THE ELECTRICITY IN ME

382
00:17:57,183 --> 00:17:59,185
WILL NOT BE STOPPED!

383
00:17:59,185 --> 00:18:01,524
GET OUT OF THERE,
IBARA!

384
00:18:01,524 --> 00:18:02,955
YOU WON'T GET AWAY.

385
00:18:02,955 --> 00:18:03,923
[thunder crashes]
DIE!

386
00:18:08,529 --> 00:18:09,996
[gasps]

387
00:18:09,996 --> 00:18:12,832
IF YOU DECIDE TO BREAK
THE RULES, KANON OZU,

388
00:18:12,832 --> 00:18:15,001
THEN YOU
GET PUNISHED!

389
00:18:17,526 --> 00:18:19,105
WAY TO GO!

390
00:18:19,105 --> 00:18:21,240
YOU TOOK HER DOWN
IN ONE PUNCH.

391
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,942
JUST TO BE SAFE,

392
00:18:22,942 --> 00:18:25,845
I'M GOING
TO SEDATE THEM WITH
MY TRANQUILIZER GUN.

393
00:18:25,845 --> 00:18:28,147
LET'S HOPE
IT WORKS ON THEM.

394
00:18:29,148 --> 00:18:30,950
[sighs]

395
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:31,951
[dart thwips]

396
00:18:34,053 --> 00:18:35,529
WELL, I COULD
TELL YOU THIS MUCH.

397
00:18:35,529 --> 00:18:37,256
I DON'T WANT
TO TAKE THESE GIRLS

398
00:18:37,256 --> 00:18:38,858
BACK TO THE PLANET
WITH US.

399
00:18:38,858 --> 00:18:41,227
DID YOU SAY
WE'RE GOING BACK
TO THE PLANET?

400
00:18:41,227 --> 00:18:43,029
BUT WE CAME
ALL THIS WAY OUT

401
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:44,197
TO GET
TO THE HOSPITAL.

402
00:18:44,197 --> 00:18:46,032
AND THESE GIRLS
CHANGED OUR PLAN,

403
00:18:46,032 --> 00:18:47,531
SO WE HAVE
TO GO BACK.

404
00:18:47,531 --> 00:18:48,935
IT WON'T BE
THAT EASY.

405
00:18:48,935 --> 00:18:49,936
HUH?
HUH?

406
00:18:49,936 --> 00:18:51,523
WAIT A SEC.

407
00:18:51,523 --> 00:18:52,530
SO YOU'RE SAYING
THEY SURROUNDED

408
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:54,941
THE ENTIRE AREA
WITH WASTE?

409
00:18:54,941 --> 00:18:57,523
THE BASTARDS HAVE US
TRAPPED IN HERE?

410
00:18:57,523 --> 00:18:59,912
THE WIND IS
STARTING TO PICK UP.

411
00:19:03,015 --> 00:19:06,529
MISS AOI,
I HAVE BROUGHT YOU
YOUR 3:00 SWEETS.

412
00:19:06,529 --> 00:19:08,955
SWEETS?

413
00:19:08,955 --> 00:19:11,257
NICE TRY THERE.

414
00:19:11,257 --> 00:19:14,127
YOU'RE NOT FOOLING ME
THAT EASY, MR. NO-SENSE.

415
00:19:14,127 --> 00:19:15,527
LEAVE
THE SWEETS THERE.

416
00:19:15,527 --> 00:19:17,522
THEN GET LOST!

417
00:19:21,523 --> 00:19:24,036
WAIT! YOU'RE
REALLY LEAVING?

418
00:19:25,522 --> 00:19:26,522
PLEASE COME BACK.

419
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,977
MISS AOI, WHY DO
YOU KEEP YOURSELF

420
00:19:30,977 --> 00:19:33,146
LOCKED INSIDE
OF THIS STOREROOM?

421
00:19:33,146 --> 00:19:35,524
I, NO-SENSE,
AM A ROBOT.

422
00:19:35,524 --> 00:19:38,528
BUT I POSSESS
DEEP EMOTIONAL
SENSITIVITY.

423
00:19:38,528 --> 00:19:41,087
HOWEVER,
SINCE THE DAY
I WAS CREATED,

424
00:19:41,087 --> 00:19:43,529
I HAVE NEVER BEEN
OUTSIDE THE PLANET.

425
00:19:43,529 --> 00:19:45,529
I DO NOT KNOW
WHAT IT MEANS

426
00:19:45,529 --> 00:19:47,927
TO FEEL
THE WARM RAYS
OF THE SUN

427
00:19:47,927 --> 00:19:50,523
OR THE FEELING
OF THE BREEZE
CARESSING MY CHEEK.

428
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,131
BUT YOU'RE
JUST A ROBOT.

429
00:19:52,131 --> 00:19:54,526
EVEN IF A BREEZE
DID BLOW ON YOUR CHEEK,

430
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,135
I DON'T THINK
YOU'D FEEL IT.

431
00:19:56,135 --> 00:19:57,528
THAT IS CORRECT.

432
00:19:57,528 --> 00:19:59,205
I AM A ROBOT.

433
00:19:59,205 --> 00:20:00,907
I AM BUT
AN IMITATION,

434
00:20:00,907 --> 00:20:02,942
A MODEL BASED
ON A HUMAN BEING.

435
00:20:02,942 --> 00:20:06,212
THAT IS WHY I
ENVY YOU, MISS AOI.

436
00:20:06,212 --> 00:20:07,980
YOU POSSESS
FREE WILL

437
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:11,522
AND CAN GO OUTSIDE
TO FEEL THE BREEZE
AS YOU PLEASE.

438
00:20:11,522 --> 00:20:13,152
YOU'RE BETTER OFF
NOT KNOWING

439
00:20:13,152 --> 00:20:15,154
WHAT IT'S LIKE
ON THE OUTSIDE.

440
00:20:15,154 --> 00:20:19,529
I MEAN, THE BREEZE
IN THIS CITY'S
SO CONTAMINATED.

TELL FROM HERE?

YES. I HAVE
COUNTERS SET UP
ALL OVER THE CITY.

HIGH-LEVEL WASTE
AROUND THIS AREA,
