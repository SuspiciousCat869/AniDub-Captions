NOW FIRE
AT THE TWO OF US!

00:00:23,205 --> 00:00:25,792
Haruto: NARUSE!

["Angel" by angela playing]

00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,394
NARUSE,
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

8
00:02:01,394 --> 00:02:04,402
COME ON, NARUSE.
SAY SOMETHING, ANYTHING.

9
00:02:04,402 --> 00:02:07,394
SHE'S UNCONSCIOUS.
WHAT ARE WE
GONNA DO?

10
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:08,710
Haruto:
TURN HER FACE-UP.

11
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,978
Kurobe: SHE'S
BADLY BLEEDING.

12
00:02:09,978 --> 00:02:11,879
SHE'S LOSING
A LOT OF BLOOD.

[all gasp]

14
00:02:14,816 --> 00:02:16,784
Kurobe: THERE'S
A PIECE OF SHRAPNEL

15
00:02:16,784 --> 00:02:17,986
LODGED IN HER GUT.

16
00:02:20,855 --> 00:02:22,396
SHE'S NOT BREATHING.

17
00:02:22,396 --> 00:02:23,791
SHE'S IN CARDIAC ARREST.

18
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:25,400
EH? THAT'S NOT GOOD.

19

Haruto:
HEY, FUKASAKU.

00:02:34,102 --> 00:02:35,394
WHAT'S WRONG?

25
00:02:35,394 --> 00:02:37,905
NO. IBARA IS
GONNA DIE,

AND IT'S MY FAULT.

27

EVERYTHING UP AGAIN.

SHE'LL ONLY DIE
IF WE DON'T HELP.

EVERYONE HAS
TO DO THEIR PART

00:02:50,394 --> 00:02:52,398
AND WORK TOGETHER
AS A TEAM
TO SAVE HER.

WON'T STOP.

NO, DON'T.

KEEP APPLYING PRESSURE
AROUND THE WOUND

DOESN'T BLEED OUT.

HE CAN'T TAKE
THE SHOCK, THOUGH.

YOU'LL HAVE
TO PRESS DOWN
ON THE WOUND.

TO GET SHOCKED.

A TRANSFUSION.

CAN YOU DO IT?

A THIRD-YEAR STUDENT.

BE BETTER IF I
WEREN'T AROUND.

A HELP TO ANYBODY.

00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:25,786
HAVE YOU SEEN
AOI AROUND?

164
00:08:25,786 --> 00:08:28,402
I CAN'T SEEM
TO FIND HER
ANYWHERE.

165
00:08:29,402 --> 00:08:32,394
WELL, ABOUT THAT...

166
00:08:32,394 --> 00:08:34,398
[pounding]

167
00:08:34,398 --> 00:08:35,930
Ibara: HEY!

168
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,798
OPEN UP, AOI!

169
00:08:37,798 --> 00:08:41,135
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
ALL COOPED UP IN THERE?

170
00:08:41,135 --> 00:08:43,804
IT'S TIME
FOR BREAKFAST.

171
00:08:43,804 --> 00:08:45,072
OPEN THIS DOOR
RIGHT NOW!

172
00:08:45,072 --> 00:08:46,707
[groans]

173
00:08:46,707 --> 00:08:49,393
YOU DON'T HAVE
A KEY TO THIS ROOM,
MISS IBUKI?

174
00:08:49,393 --> 00:08:50,397
NOT EVEN A SPARE?

175
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:52,079
I'M SORRY.
SHE LOCKED HERSELF IN

176
00:08:52,079 --> 00:08:53,914
WITH THE ONLY ONE
WE HAVE.

177
00:08:53,914 --> 00:08:56,817
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON WITH
THAT GIRL, ANYWAY?

178
00:08:56,817 --> 00:08:59,401
TAEKO AND I ARE
OUT OF COMMISSION
WITH OUR INJURIES.

179
00:08:59,401 --> 00:09:01,401
SHE NEEDS
TO TAKE UP
THE SLACK.

180
00:09:01,401 --> 00:09:03,858
SHE'S PROBABLY
FEELING GUILTY,

181
00:09:03,858 --> 00:09:06,397
THINKING SHE'S TO BLAME
FOR YOUR INJURIES.

182
00:09:06,397 --> 00:09:08,095
YOU THINK SO?

183
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:11,397
HER CAPTURE IS WHAT
PUT US IN THIS MESS
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

184
00:09:11,397 --> 00:09:13,901
MAYBE YOU COULD
GIVE HER A LITTLE
PEP TALK, IBARA.

185
00:09:13,901 --> 00:09:16,396
I BET THAT WOULD
MAKE HER FEEL BETTER.

186
00:09:16,396 --> 00:09:18,072
GIVE IT A TRY.

187
00:09:18,072 --> 00:09:22,009
AOI, I KNOW
THAT YOU'RE FEELING
REALLY BADLY.

188
00:09:22,009 --> 00:09:23,778
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

189
00:09:23,778 --> 00:09:25,813
LOCKING YOURSELF
IN THIS ROOM

190
00:09:25,813 --> 00:09:27,982
AND HIDING FROM
YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES

191
00:09:27,982 --> 00:09:29,116
JUST MAKES YOU...

192
00:09:29,116 --> 00:09:30,396
A LOSER.

193
00:09:30,396 --> 00:09:31,400
[sobs]

194
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,154
OR EVEN WORSE,
A GOOD-FOR-NOTHING.

195
00:09:33,154 --> 00:09:36,090
[sobbing]

196
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,926
IS THAT HOW YOU
WANT TO BE SEEN, AOI?

197
00:09:38,926 --> 00:09:39,960
[crying]

198
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,130
HELLO?
ARE YOU LISTENING, AOI?

199
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:57,393
[yawns]

200
00:09:57,393 --> 00:09:59,393
HEY, KUROBE.

201
00:09:59,393 --> 00:10:02,883
I BROUGHT
THE COPPELION BOY
WITH ME.

202
00:10:02,883 --> 00:10:05,086
I DON'T KNOW THIS PLACE.
WHERE ARE WE?

203
00:10:05,086 --> 00:10:07,988
A POLICE STATION,
OF COURSE.

204
00:10:07,988 --> 00:10:09,890
I'M NOT ABOUT TO
BRING THAT BASTARD

205
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,399
BACK WITH US
TO THE PLANET.

206
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:14,695
Kurobe:
DAMN WHITE-COAT FREAK.

207
00:10:14,695 --> 00:10:16,831
HE DOESN'T WEAR
AN OXYGEN TANK.

208
00:10:16,831 --> 00:10:18,399
HE MUST HAVE
A SERIOUS DEATH WISH.

209
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,399
[chuckles]

210
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:20,399
Kurobe: WHATEVER.

211
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,397
HE JUST GIVES ME
THE CREEPS.

212
00:10:22,397 --> 00:10:23,904
WHO ARE YOU GUYS
WORKING FOR?

213
00:10:23,904 --> 00:10:26,073
WHY ARE YOU COLLECTING
ALL THAT WASTE?

214
00:10:26,073 --> 00:10:29,009
Haruto: AND NOT
JUST THE LOW-LEVEL WASTE

215
00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:30,878
AT THE WATER TREATMENT
PLANT,

216
00:10:30,878 --> 00:10:34,782
BUT THE HIGH-LEVEL WASTE
IN THE BOAT RACE
STADIUM AS WELL.

217
00:10:35,883 --> 00:10:37,985
CURIOUSLY
ALL THE CANISTERS

218
00:10:37,985 --> 00:10:39,396
WERE LABELED IN ENGLISH,

219
00:10:39,396 --> 00:10:41,021
INDICATING THEY CAME
FROM OVERSEAS.

220
00:10:41,021 --> 00:10:44,396
ARE YOU WORKING WITH
THE BACK-END COMPANY
YELLOW CAKE?

221
00:10:44,396 --> 00:10:47,061
I DON'T KNOW
OF ANY YELLOW CAKE.

222
00:10:47,061 --> 00:10:49,393
WE'RE NOT DOING THIS
FOR MONEY.

223
00:10:49,393 --> 00:10:51,393
OH, SO NOW YOU TALK?

224
00:10:51,393 --> 00:10:53,067
Haruto: THEN WHAT
ARE YOU AFTER?

225
00:10:55,396 --> 00:10:58,038
SO YOU DON'T WANT
TO TELL ME THAT, DO YOU?

226
00:10:58,038 --> 00:10:59,401
[gunshot]

227
00:10:59,401 --> 00:11:02,395
WHAT THE HELL?
YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO SHOOT HIM.

228
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:04,393
HUH?

229
00:11:04,393 --> 00:11:06,393
[laughing]

230
00:11:10,395 --> 00:11:11,819
IT'S A NEUROTOXIN.

231
00:11:11,819 --> 00:11:13,393
WITHOUT THIS ANTIDOTE,

232
00:11:13,393 --> 00:11:15,401
YOU'LL HAVE FIVE SECONDS
UNTIL YOU'RE DEAD.

233
00:11:15,401 --> 00:11:18,058
THAT'S HOW LONG
YOU HAVE TO ANSWER ME.

234
00:11:18,058 --> 00:11:19,059
5...

235
00:11:19,059 --> 00:11:20,398
WAIT A SECOND, KID.
4...

236
00:11:20,398 --> 00:11:21,929
HE HAS NO FEAR OF PAIN...
3...

237
00:11:21,929 --> 00:11:23,931
OR DYING.
2...

238
00:11:23,931 --> 00:11:24,932
[gasping]

239
00:11:24,932 --> 00:11:25,933
AND 1.

240
00:11:25,933 --> 00:11:27,735
WAIT. I'LL TELL YOU.

241
00:11:27,735 --> 00:11:29,737
[gunshot]

242
00:11:29,737 --> 00:11:30,905
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

243
00:11:30,905 --> 00:11:33,040
DID HE JUST
BEG FOR HIS LIFE?

244
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,942
IF HE WAS
READY TO DIE,

245
00:11:34,942 --> 00:11:37,011
THEN HE WOULD
HAVE COMMITTED
SUICIDE ALREADY.

246
00:11:37,011 --> 00:11:40,014
THAT WOULD PROTECT
THE FIRST DIVISION'S SECRET.

247
00:11:40,014 --> 00:11:43,400
BUT HE HAS A REASON
FOR WANTING TO STAY ALIVE.

248
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,020
THERE'S
NO STOPPING US NOW.

249
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,021
WHAT'S THAT?

250
00:11:47,021 --> 00:11:48,122
WHAT ARE
YOU SAYING?

251
00:11:48,122 --> 00:11:50,991
THE FIRST DIVISION
HAS NO LEADER.

252
00:11:50,991 --> 00:11:55,029
EVERY LAST SOLDIER
IS PROBABLY ON HIS WAY
TO THE SARCOPHAGUS

253
00:11:55,029 --> 00:11:57,097
TO CARRY OUT
HIS MISSION.

254
00:11:57,097 --> 00:11:59,700
THE SARCOPHAGUS?

255
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:03,393
WE'RE COLLECTING
ALL OF THE WASTE
AT THE SARCOPHAGUS.

256
00:12:03,393 --> 00:12:05,393
FROM THERE,
WE WILL SPREAD TERROR

257
00:12:05,393 --> 00:12:07,708
THROUGHOUT
THE ENTIRE WORLD.

258
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:08,709
[laughs]

259
00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:11,111
HUH?

260
00:12:11,111 --> 00:12:13,714
[laughs]

261
00:12:13,714 --> 00:12:16,397
Haruto:
NARUSE, COME IN.

262
00:12:16,397 --> 00:12:18,919
HARUTO.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

263
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:21,398
WHAT?
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

264
00:12:22,398 --> 00:12:23,924
[whimpers]

265
00:12:23,924 --> 00:12:24,925
[gasps]

266
00:12:24,925 --> 00:12:26,393
Taeko:
MISS IBUKI.

267
00:12:26,393 --> 00:12:28,862
THE BABY'S COMING.

268
00:12:37,537 --> 00:12:39,540
THE BABY'S
COMING NOW?

269
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,147
[gasping]
OH, NO.

270
00:12:41,147 --> 00:12:42,281
Gojiro: IBUKI!

271
00:12:42,281 --> 00:12:44,016
ARE YOU HAVING
CONTRACTIONS AGAIN?

272
00:12:44,016 --> 00:12:46,536
I CAN'T
STAND UP.

273
00:12:46,536 --> 00:12:49,534
HER CONTRACTIONS ARE
GETTING CLOSER TOGETHER.

274
00:12:49,534 --> 00:12:53,126
CALL THE RESCUE HELICOPTER
IMMEDIATELY!

275
00:12:53,126 --> 00:12:55,128
[German accent]
WE ALL KNOW AUSTRALIA
IS POWERFUL

276
00:12:55,128 --> 00:12:57,542
AND HAS THE LARGEST
NATURAL RESOURCE.

277
00:12:57,542 --> 00:13:01,134
PLEASE CONSIDER
AN EXCLUSIVE AGREEMENT
WITH ITALY.

278
00:13:01,134 --> 00:13:03,540
NO, NO!
PLEASE CONSIDER FRANCE!

279
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,204
WHAT?

280
00:13:05,204 --> 00:13:08,274
YOU'RE SAYING
THE WOMAN IS ABOUT
TO GO INTO LABOR?

281
00:13:08,274 --> 00:13:10,534
YES, SIR.
IT LOOKS THAT WAY.

282
00:13:10,534 --> 00:13:12,211
WE NEED MORE
MEDICAL ASSISTANCE.

283
00:13:12,211 --> 00:13:14,539
CAN YOU SEND
A HELICOPTER OVER NOW?

284
00:13:14,539 --> 00:13:17,539
IF ONLY IT WAS
MY CALL, NARUSE,

285
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:19,536
BUT THE PRIME MINISTER

286
00:13:19,536 --> 00:13:21,854
HAS MADE THIS CONFERENCE
THE HIGHEST PRIORITY.

287
00:13:21,854 --> 00:13:24,924
HE'S TRYING TO DISPLAY
JAPAN'S POWER

288
00:13:24,924 --> 00:13:27,539
SO THAT HE CAN PRESERVE
THE COUNTRY'S DIGNITY.

289
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:29,195
AND THAT'S A GOOD REASON

290
00:13:29,195 --> 00:13:31,864
HE WON'T SEND EVEN
A SINGLE HELICOPTER OUT?

291
00:13:35,537 --> 00:13:38,871
MR. GOJIRO,
IS SHE HOLDING UP OK?

292
00:13:38,871 --> 00:13:40,536
JUST FOR NOW,

293
00:13:40,536 --> 00:13:43,075
BUT SHE'S
GONNA GIVE BIRTH
WITHIN TWO DAYS.

294
00:13:43,075 --> 00:13:44,541
THE HELICOPTER,
WHERE IS IT?

295
00:13:45,912 --> 00:13:48,181
YOU HEAR THAT?

296
00:13:48,181 --> 00:13:49,215
[rotors whirring]

297
00:13:49,215 --> 00:13:51,184
[sighs]

298
00:13:51,184 --> 00:13:53,536
Kurobe:
I'M TELLING YOU,

299
00:13:53,536 --> 00:13:55,922
THIS BASTARD'S
COMPLETELY NUTS.

300
00:13:55,922 --> 00:13:56,989
[chuckles]

301
00:13:56,989 --> 00:13:59,192
EVEN IF IT IS
THEIR GOAL,

302
00:13:59,192 --> 00:14:02,195
IS THE FIRST
DIVISION CAPABLE
OF SUCH A THING?

303
00:14:02,195 --> 00:14:03,896
IMAGINE...

304
00:14:03,896 --> 00:14:07,300
THE SARCOPHAGUS
CONSTRUCTED AROUND
THE ACCIDENT SITE

305
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,069
IS FILLED WITH DEADLY
CONTAMINATED MATERIALS.

306
00:14:10,069 --> 00:14:12,905
IN A WAY,
IT'S LIKE A MASSIVE BOMB.

307
00:14:12,905 --> 00:14:16,175
JUST HAVING IT THERE
IS DANGEROUS ENOUGH.

308
00:14:16,175 --> 00:14:18,538
BUT WHAT IF SOMEONE
DETONATES IT?

309
00:14:18,538 --> 00:14:21,080
IT WOULD BE
COMPLETELY DESTROYED,

310
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,542
AND THE COUNTRY
WITH IT AS WELL.

311
00:14:23,542 --> 00:14:25,051
ONE THING'S FOR SURE.

312
00:14:25,051 --> 00:14:27,286
THE FIRST DIVISION
HOLDS A SERIOUS GRUDGE

313
00:14:27,286 --> 00:14:29,088
AGAINST
THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT.

314
00:14:29,088 --> 00:14:30,536
THEY SHOULD
COMPLAIN DIRECTLY

315
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,536
TO THE PRIME MINISTER
THEN!

316
00:14:32,536 --> 00:14:34,539
COME ON.
CALM DOWN, KUROBE.

317
00:14:34,539 --> 00:14:36,996
I'M SURE HE'LL
FIND OUT ABOUT IT SOON.

318
00:14:36,996 --> 00:14:39,538
NARUSE
HAS ALREADY REPORTED
TO THE VICE PRINCIPAL

319
00:14:39,538 --> 00:14:41,538
AND GIVEN HIM
ALL THE DETAILS.

320

324
00:14:54,146 --> 00:14:56,015
LET ME GUESS.

325
00:14:56,015 --> 00:14:59,538
YOU'VE ASCERTAINED
WHAT THE FIRST DIVISION
IS PLANNING.

326
00:14:59,538 --> 00:15:02,541
I HAVE, AND
THE PRIME MINISTER
SHOULD BE UPDATED.

327
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:05,892
WE NEED REINFORCEMENTS
SENT A.S.A.P.

328
00:15:05,892 --> 00:15:07,543
I WON'T TELL HIM
ANYTHING

329
00:15:07,543 --> 00:15:11,063
THAT COULD NEGATIVELY
IMPACT HIS LEADERSHIP
AT THIS CONFERENCE.

330
00:15:11,063 --> 00:15:12,231
WHAT'S THAT?

331
00:15:12,231 --> 00:15:14,543
THIS WHOLE THING
MAY SEEM SILLY TO YOU,

332
00:15:14,543 --> 00:15:17,541
BUT IF WE FALL BEHIND
THE REST OF THE WORLD,

333
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,139
OUR NATION
WILL BE AT RISK.

334
00:15:20,139 --> 00:15:22,535
JUST WAIT UNTIL
THE CONFERENCE IS OVER.

335
00:15:22,535 --> 00:15:26,078
UNTIL THEN, I'LL LEAVE
THE FATE OF JAPAN

THE SO-CALLED HELPERS
ARE GOING TO ABANDON
MY DAUGHTER!

YEAH,
AND TO BE CLEAR,

00:16:02,214 --> 00:16:03,536
I DON'T
KNOW ANYTHING

ABOUT DELIVERING

GET HER TO THE HOSPITAL,

00:16:07,053 --> 00:16:08,888
WE COULD END UP
LOSING BOTH OF THEM.

MAKING YOUR WAY

OUR HEADQUARTERS SET UP.

YOU THINKING?

DO YOU
WANT TO GET ATTACKED
BY THE GHOSTS AGAIN?

WE'RE GOING ANYWHERE.

I WON'T LET THEM ATTACK.

IN ORDER TO BE
ABLE TO GAIN ACCESS
INTO THE SARCOPHAGUS.

430
00:19:06,538 --> 00:19:09,168
THAT'S BECAUSE
THE SARCOPHAGUS ITSELF

HAS BECOME
