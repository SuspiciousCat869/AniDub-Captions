THE GHOSTS HANG OUT.

161
00:08:09,465 --> 00:08:11,124
THEY'VE BEEN
BUILDING IT UP

162
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:12,435
GRADUALLY
OVER MANY YEARS.

163
00:08:12,435 --> 00:08:13,436
[gasps]

164
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,774
HEY!

165
00:08:18,774 --> 00:08:20,125
Ibara:
STOP RIGHT THERE!

166
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,130
HMM?

167
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:23,131
ONE MOVE, AND I'LL
SHOOT YOU DOWN.

168
00:08:23,131 --> 00:08:25,125
HEH.

169
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,582
IBARA, YOU GOTTA
GET AWAY!

170
00:08:26,582 --> 00:08:27,783
HUH?

171
00:08:27,783 --> 00:08:29,127
THESE GUYS
ARE INSANE,

172
00:08:29,127 --> 00:08:31,129
AND THEY'RE
NOT AFRAID
OF BEING SHOT!

173
00:08:31,129 --> 00:08:34,123
THREATS LIKE
THAT WON'T DO US
ANY GOOD AT ALL!

174
00:08:38,527 --> 00:08:40,124
SHOOT ME.

175
00:08:40,124 --> 00:08:42,129
[gasping]

176
00:08:42,129 --> 00:08:44,533
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
LITTLE GIRL?

177
00:08:44,533 --> 00:08:46,569
I'M UNARMED.

178
00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:49,131
GO RIGHT AHEAD
AND KILL ME.

179
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:52,775
[grunts]

180
00:08:52,775 --> 00:08:54,124
AH, SHIT.

181
00:08:54,124 --> 00:08:55,511
[soldiers grunting]

182
00:08:55,511 --> 00:08:57,124
Kurobe: WHY
DIDN'T YOU SHOOT,
YOU IDIOT?

183
00:08:57,124 --> 00:08:59,124
STOP!

184
00:08:59,124 --> 00:09:01,584
[grunting]

185
00:09:01,584 --> 00:09:04,123
[grunting continues]

186
00:09:05,521 --> 00:09:06,522
HUH?

187
00:09:06,522 --> 00:09:08,724
WELL, WELL.

188
00:09:08,724 --> 00:09:12,123
SEEMS LIKE
THE CLASS PRESIDENT
NEEDS HELP.

189
00:09:12,123 --> 00:09:13,729
WHO ARE YOU?

190
00:09:13,729 --> 00:09:17,130
OH, HEY. IT'S THE GUY
FROM THE CLEANUP CREW.

191
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:24,128
OPEN FIRE!

192
00:09:25,841 --> 00:09:27,126
[chuckles]

193
00:09:38,126 --> 00:09:39,130
WHA--

194
00:09:48,731 --> 00:09:51,123
IT'S OVER.

195
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:52,129
FOR YOU.

196
00:09:52,129 --> 00:09:54,126
[screams]

197
00:09:56,539 --> 00:09:58,507
Kurobe: HEY, KID!

198
00:09:58,507 --> 00:10:00,127
OPEN UP
THIS DANG THING!

199
00:10:00,127 --> 00:10:01,477
LET'S GET
OUT OF HERE!

200
00:10:03,579 --> 00:10:06,128
Coppelion:
AOI FUKASAKU,
OVER HERE!

201
00:10:06,128 --> 00:10:08,128
Kurobe: GET YOUR ASS
OVER HERE!

202
00:10:08,128 --> 00:10:09,652
I'M SAVED.

203
00:10:09,652 --> 00:10:11,128
THE HOSTAGE
IS GETTING AWAY!

204
00:10:11,128 --> 00:10:12,128
[gasps]

205
00:10:12,128 --> 00:10:14,127
[screams]

206
00:10:14,127 --> 00:10:16,124
RUN FASTER,
LITTLE GIRL!

207
00:10:16,124 --> 00:10:17,860
THEY'RE COMING
AFTER YOU!

208
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,130
COME ON.
I GOT YA!

209
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,464
GRAB MY HAND!
COME ON!

210
00:10:22,464 --> 00:10:24,127
[Aoi screams]

211
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:26,468
Kurobe:
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

212
00:10:26,468 --> 00:10:28,470
[distant chatter]

213
00:10:34,531 --> 00:10:36,144
HARUTO!

214
00:10:36,144 --> 00:10:38,914
OH. DIDN'T YOU
HEAR THE BELL?

215
00:10:44,525 --> 00:10:46,154
[gasps]

216
00:10:46,154 --> 00:10:47,155
[metal clangs]

217
00:10:47,155 --> 00:10:48,525
[groans]

218
00:10:48,525 --> 00:10:50,525
Haruto:
DON'T BREAK IT.

219
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:51,960
YOUR ROCK-HARD HEAD

220
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,533
MIGHT SPLIT
THE CARRIER IN TWO.

221
00:10:54,533 --> 00:10:55,931
WAIT A MINUTE.

222
00:10:55,931 --> 00:10:57,532
HARUTO KUROSAWA

223
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:59,167
FROM
THE CLEANUP CREW?

224
00:10:59,167 --> 00:11:02,524
I RECEIVED AN URGENT CALL
FROM THE VICE PRINCIPAL

225
00:11:02,524 --> 00:11:04,533
ORDERING US TO ASSIST
YOUR MEDICAL UNIT.

226
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,909
OH, YOU'RE AWAKE NOW.

227
00:11:07,909 --> 00:11:09,211
I JUST WOKE UP.

228
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:11,079
GLAD TO SEE
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

229
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:13,148
SORRY ABOUT THAT
BACK THERE.

230
00:11:13,148 --> 00:11:16,184
WE WERE A LITTLE LATE
COMING TO YOUR RESCUE.

231
00:11:16,184 --> 00:11:19,531
NO, IT WAS MY FAULT
FOR RUNNING OFF ON MY OWN.

232
00:11:19,531 --> 00:11:23,125
OH. WERE YOU
ABLE TO GET AOI
BACK HERE ALL RIGHT?

233
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:25,527
Kurobe: WE HAD
TO LEAVE HER BEHIND.

234
00:11:25,527 --> 00:11:26,530
WHAT?

235
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:28,530
WHY IS THIS HAPPENING?

236
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:31,530
I CAN'T BE HELD HOSTAGE
BY THESE MANIACS!

237
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,524
MORONS!

238
00:11:33,524 --> 00:11:35,270
LET ME OUT OF HERE!

239
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:38,106
WHY DO I ALWAYS
HAVE BAD LUCK?!

240
00:11:38,106 --> 00:11:39,524
[groans]

241
00:11:39,524 --> 00:11:41,109
EH, IT AIN'T
MY FAULT,
SISTER.

242
00:11:41,109 --> 00:11:42,531
IT WAS HIS
AWFUL DRIVING

243
00:11:42,531 --> 00:11:44,279
THAT MADE ME
DROP HER.

244
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,114
WE HAVE
TO RESCUE HER.

245
00:11:46,114 --> 00:11:48,283
SETTLE DOWN THERE,
NARUSE.

246
00:11:48,283 --> 00:11:51,119
I STUCK A TRANSMITTER
ON AOI FUKASAKU

247
00:11:51,119 --> 00:11:53,121
THAT'LL LET US DETECT
HER LIFE SIGNS.

248
00:11:53,121 --> 00:11:54,526
ARE YOU GUYS ABLE...

249
00:11:54,526 --> 00:11:56,258
Haruto: IT HAS A SENSOR
THAT SENDS A SIGNAL

250
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:57,959
AS LONG AS SHE'S ALIVE.

251
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,529
WITH IT, WE'LL BE ABLE
TO TRACK WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

252
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:04,526
HOLD ON. YOU MEAN
YOU LEFT AOI BEHIND

253
00:12:04,526 --> 00:12:06,529
JUST SO YOU
COULD MONITOR
THE MOVEMENTS

254
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:08,527
THE FIRST DIVISION
MAKES?

255
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:09,871
DOESN'T IT
BOTHER YOU...

256
00:12:09,871 --> 00:12:10,872
HUH?

257
00:12:10,872 --> 00:12:12,527
NOT BEING ABLE TO KNOW

258
00:12:12,527 --> 00:12:15,277
EXACTLY WHAT
THE FIRST DIVISION
WANTS WITH US?

259
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:17,979
THAT'S NO REASON
TO SACRIFICE A FRIEND.

260
00:12:17,979 --> 00:12:20,282
DID I SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT SACRIFICING?

261
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:22,525
THEY'LL KEEP HER ALIVE

262
00:12:22,525 --> 00:12:24,086
SINCE SHE'S
USEFUL TO THEM.

263
00:12:24,086 --> 00:12:25,087
HUH?

264
00:12:25,087 --> 00:12:26,888
JUST WAIT AND SEE.

265
00:12:26,888 --> 00:12:29,257
THE EXPLOSION EARLIER
RENDERED THEIR BASE

266
00:12:29,257 --> 00:12:31,860
IN THAT MOUNTAIN OF JUNK
COMPLETELY USELESS.

267
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,533
THEY CAN'T STAY THERE
ANYMORE,

268
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:35,532
SO THEY'RE GONNA HAVE
TO MOVE ALONG.

269
00:12:35,532 --> 00:12:38,066
WE'LL BE ABLE
TO GRAB AOI FUKASAKU

270
00:12:38,066 --> 00:12:40,068
JUST AFTER THEY
MAKE THEIR MOVE.

271
00:12:40,068 --> 00:12:42,531
SO ALL WE CAN DO
IS SIT AROUND HERE
AND WAIT

272
00:12:42,531 --> 00:12:45,532
UNTIL THE GHOSTS
DECIDE THAT THEY'RE
READY TO MOVE ON?

273
00:12:45,532 --> 00:12:47,876
PRECISELY.

274
00:12:47,876 --> 00:12:49,878
I JUST FEEL SO BAD
FOR AOI

275
00:12:49,878 --> 00:12:52,080
TRAPPED ALL ALONE
AND CRYING.

276
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,081
[shrieks]

277
00:12:53,081 --> 00:12:55,083
[laughs]

278
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:57,526
THIS RICE BALL
IS SO YUMMY!

279
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,054
MISO SOUP, PLEASE!

280
00:13:06,061 --> 00:13:08,525
I'M NOT SURE
THIS FIRE IS
SUCH A GREAT IDEA.

281
00:13:08,525 --> 00:13:10,899
WON'T THEY BE ABLE
TO FIGURE OUT
WHERE WE ARE?

282
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:12,527
I DOUBT IT.
THE FIRST DIVISION

283
00:13:12,527 --> 00:13:15,270
HAS PROBABLY GOT
THEIR HANDS FULL
PREPARING TO MOVE OUT.

284
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,531
I CAN KEEP A LOOKOUT
FOR NOW.

285
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:20,527
YOU SHOULD GO
GET SOME REST, NARUSE.

286
00:13:20,527 --> 00:13:23,529
HEH. MY WOUNDS
HAVE HEALED UP ALREADY.

287
00:13:23,529 --> 00:13:25,524
DROP THE ACT.

288
00:13:25,524 --> 00:13:27,849
YOU ALWAYS HAVE BEEN
A LOUSY LIAR.

289
00:13:28,884 --> 00:13:30,529
WHILE YOU WERE ASLEEP,

290
00:13:30,529 --> 00:13:32,888
I CHECKED YOU OVER
FROM HEAD TO TOE.

291
00:13:32,888 --> 00:13:36,858
THESE PAST FEW DAYS HAVE
COMPLETELY WORN YOU OUT.

292
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:39,227
EVEN WITH YOUR
RECUPERATIVE ABILITIES,

293
00:13:39,227 --> 00:13:42,530
YOU STILL COULD USE
A FULL DAY'S REST
TO RECOVER.

294
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,233
UM, CHECKED
HEAD TO TOE

295
00:13:45,233 --> 00:13:47,269
IN MY SLEEP?

296
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:49,171
I'M JUST SAYING

297
00:13:49,171 --> 00:13:52,528
THEY KEEP TALKING
ABOUT RESCUING US
BECAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT,

298
00:13:52,528 --> 00:13:54,142
BUT OUR LIVES
SUCKED ALREADY

299
00:13:54,142 --> 00:13:56,529
WITH THE RECESSION
GOING ON AND ALL THAT.

300
00:13:56,529 --> 00:13:59,530
BUT HERE, WE DON'T HAVE
TO WORK OR PAY TAXES

301
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:03,151
OR DO ANY OF THAT
TROUBLESOME STUFF
LIKE WE USED TO.

302
00:14:04,525 --> 00:14:06,531
[sighs] I DON'T
EVER WANT TO RETURN

303
00:14:06,531 --> 00:14:08,531
TO THAT KIND
OF B.S. SOCIETY.

304
00:14:08,531 --> 00:14:10,525
[sighs] KUROBE,

305
00:14:10,525 --> 00:14:12,526
TRY TO LOOK AT IT
LIKE THIS.

306
00:14:12,526 --> 00:14:16,231
THOSE CHILDREN BEAR
A HEAVY RESPONSIBILITY

307
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:18,266
FORCED ONTO THEM
AT BIRTH.

308
00:14:18,266 --> 00:14:21,526
THEY WILL BE BOUND
BY THAT CURSE

309
00:14:21,526 --> 00:14:24,239
UNTIL THEY COMPLETE
THEIR MISSION.

310
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:26,525
WOW.

311
00:14:26,525 --> 00:14:29,528
THE STARS
LOOK AMAZING
OUT HERE.

312
00:14:29,528 --> 00:14:34,149
DO YOU KNOW WHY
YOU CAN SEE THEM SO WELL
IN THE OLD CAPITAL, NARUSE?

313
00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:35,527
HMM?

314
00:14:36,852 --> 00:14:40,528
THERE ARE NO LIGHTS
FOR MILES AROUND HERE.

315
00:14:40,528 --> 00:14:43,526
THE TECHNOLOGICAL SPIRIT
THAT BUILT THIS CITY

316
00:14:43,526 --> 00:14:46,061
ULTIMATELY DESTROYED IT.

317
00:14:46,061 --> 00:14:50,198
AREN'T HUMAN BEINGS
THE MOST PITIFUL CREATURES?

318
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,525
TELL ME SOMETHING.

319
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:56,527
WHAT SORT OF WORK
DOES THE CLEANUP CREW
DO, HARUTO?

320
00:14:56,527 --> 00:14:59,040
[beeping]
THE TRANSMITTER'S
MOVING.

321
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,275
WHAT?

322
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:03,044
THE FIRST DIVISION
IS MAKING ITS MOVE NOW.

323
00:15:03,044 --> 00:15:06,047
NARUSE, YOU READY?

324
00:15:06,047 --> 00:15:08,528
YES.

325
00:15:08,528 --> 00:15:11,853
Kurobe: OK,
IS EVERYBODY ON BOARD?

326
00:15:11,853 --> 00:15:14,524
WHY ARE YOU DRAGGING
ME ALONG WITH YOU?

327
00:15:14,524 --> 00:15:17,225
WE NEED MANPOWER,
SO SUCK IT UP
THERE, GENNAI.

328
00:15:17,225 --> 00:15:18,531
STEP ON IT,
HARUTO.

329
00:15:18,531 --> 00:15:20,262
LET'S GET
THIS THING
MOVING.

330
00:15:20,262 --> 00:15:22,998
HOLD IT,
YOU TWO.
SEE THIS?

331
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:27,035
Kurobe: IT'S A MAP
OF ALL THE ZONES,

332
00:15:27,035 --> 00:15:29,037
THE HEAVILY
CONTAMINATED AREAS.

333
00:15:29,037 --> 00:15:30,528
THOSE ARE ALL ZONES?

334
00:15:30,528 --> 00:15:32,528
IT'S OK FOR YOU TWO,

335
00:15:32,528 --> 00:15:35,176
BUT IT'S TOO DANGEROUS
FOR US ORDINARY HUMANS.

336
00:15:35,176 --> 00:15:37,279
WE'LL NEED TO DETOUR
AROUND THE ZONE

337
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,947
TO CATCH THOSE GHOSTS.

338
00:15:38,947 --> 00:15:41,532
MAYBE HARUTO AND I
SHOULD BE THE ONES
TO GO OUT THERE.

339
00:15:41,532 --> 00:15:43,528
YOU KIDDING?
I'M NOT MISSING THIS.

340
00:15:43,528 --> 00:15:47,022
Gennai: THE FOREMAN
THINKS HE'S SOME
KIND OF JARHEAD.

341
00:15:53,528 --> 00:15:54,896
Haruto: THE FIRST DIVISION

342
00:15:54,896 --> 00:15:57,032
IS HEADED
DIRECTLY NORTHWEST.

343
00:15:57,032 --> 00:15:59,527
I GUESS THEY FIGURED OUT
WHERE THEY WANT TO GO.

344
00:15:59,527 --> 00:16:02,528
CAN YOU TELL FROM
THE LOOKS OF THINGS
WHERE WE MIGHT BE?

345
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,528
IS THIS
A TRAIN STATION?

346
00:16:04,528 --> 00:16:06,524
Kurobe:
IT IS.

347
00:16:06,524 --> 00:16:08,944
A TRAIN, HUH?
WHAT A WASTE.

348
00:16:08,944 --> 00:16:11,530
BY NOW,
IT MUST BE A HEAP
OF RUSTED METAL.

349
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:13,048
Gennai:
NOT AT ALL.

350
00:16:13,048 --> 00:16:14,049
HUH?

351
00:16:14,049 --> 00:16:15,532
Gennai:
WE WERE USING IT

352
00:16:15,532 --> 00:16:19,154
UNTIL JUST RECENTLY
TO TRANSPORT
ALL SORTS OF GOODS

353
00:16:19,154 --> 00:16:21,856
FROM THE CENTER
OF THE OLD CAPITAL.

354
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:23,530
REALLY?
IT WAS STILL RUNNING?

355
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:26,525
SURE WAS.
WE RAN POWER LINES

356
00:16:26,525 --> 00:16:28,029
FROM THE HYDROELECTRIC PLANT

357
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:29,831
TO KEEP THE TRAIN
OPERATIONAL.

358
00:16:29,831 --> 00:16:32,834
HMM, BUT IT'S NOT
UP AND RUNNING
ANYMORE.

359
00:16:32,834 --> 00:16:35,529
THE POWER LINE
HAS A BREAK SOMEWHERE,

360
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:39,525
BUT THE ZONE
IS PREVENTING US
FROM DOING REPAIRS.

361
00:16:41,528 --> 00:16:43,979
DON'T BE FRIGHTENED.

362
00:16:43,979 --> 00:16:45,530
[gasps]

363
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:48,850
WE'RE JUST GOING
TO NEED YOUR HELP
A LITTLE LATER.

364
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:51,987
ONCE WE'RE DONE, I PROMISE
I'LL SEND YOU BACK HOME.

365
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:55,023
[thinking]
HE'S SO LYING.

366
00:16:55,023 --> 00:16:58,193
I'M SO GOING
TO BE KILLED.

367
00:17:02,831 --> 00:17:05,200
Haruto: THE FIRST DIVISION
MADE A RIGHT TURN.

368
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,836
THE ROAD LEADS
TO A MASSIVE ZONE.

369
00:17:07,836 --> 00:17:11,524
Kurobe:
THAT ONE'S NOT
SO DANGEROUS.

370
00:17:11,524 --> 00:17:14,843
SEE? IT SHOWS
IT'S LOW-LEVEL HERE.

371
00:17:14,843 --> 00:17:16,011
LOW-LEVEL?

372
00:17:16,011 --> 00:17:18,529
IT'S NOT AS BAD
AS OTHER ZONES,

373
00:17:18,529 --> 00:17:20,215
BUT IT'S
GETTING WORSE.

374
00:17:20,215 --> 00:17:22,528
SOMETHING OR SOMEONE

375
00:17:22,528 --> 00:17:24,185
HAS GOT BE THE CAUSE

376
00:17:24,185 --> 00:17:26,528
OF THE INCREASE
IN POLLUTION OVER THERE.

377
00:17:26,528 --> 00:17:28,530
SO WHAT'S
IN THAT AREA, ANYWAY?

378
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,158
I COULD TELL YOU,

379
00:17:30,158 --> 00:17:32,994
BUT WHY DON'T YOU
JUST TAKE A LOOK
FOR YOURSELF?

380
00:17:34,525 --> 00:17:37,528
Ibara: WHAT ARE
ALL THOSE POOLS?

381
00:17:37,528 --> 00:17:39,524
IT'S A WATER
TREATMENT PLANT.

382
00:17:39,524 --> 00:17:41,524
BACK IN THE DAY,
THESE SUPPLIED

383
00:17:41,524 --> 00:17:42,937
EVERYONE'S
TAP WATER.

384
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:46,528
NOWADAYS,
THEY'RE FULL OF
CONTAMINATED WATER.

385
00:17:46,528 --> 00:17:48,843
[gasps]
HUH?

386
00:17:48,843 --> 00:17:51,012
WE SPOTTED
THE FIRST DIVISION.

387
00:17:54,082 --> 00:17:56,525
BRING THEM UP SLOWLY.

388
00:17:56,525 --> 00:17:57,529
CAREFUL.

389
00:17:57,529 --> 00:17:59,529
WHAT IN THE HELL?

390
00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:03,529
THEY'RE LOADING
THOSE YELLOW BARRELS
INTO A TRUCK.

391
00:18:03,529 --> 00:18:06,531
Ibara:
THAT'S LOW-LEVEL WASTE.

392
00:18:06,531 --> 00:18:09,531
Kurobe: WAIT.
THAT COULD MEAN
THAT BARRELS LIKE THOSE

393
00:18:09,531 --> 00:18:12,267
ARE AT THE BOTTOM
OF ALL THESE POOLS.

394
00:18:12,267 --> 00:18:14,169
SO WHAT'S
OUR PLAN NOW?

395
00:18:14,169 --> 00:18:17,005
OUR FIRST PRIORITY
IS GETTING AOI.

396
00:18:17,005 --> 00:18:18,526
NOT SO FAST.

397
00:18:18,526 --> 00:18:20,532
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"NOT SO FAST"?

398
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:22,877
THINGS WERE JUST
STARTING TO GET GOOD.

399
00:18:22,877 --> 00:18:25,080
I HAVE AN IDEA.

00:18:26,915 --> 00:18:27,949

HEY, GUYS!

410
00:18:49,525 --> 00:18:51,039
NOW TO CLEAN UP.

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,533
HARUTO, WAIT.

412
00:18:52,533 --> 00:18:54,042
DON'T DO THAT.

413
00:18:54,042 --> 00:18:56,529
IF YOU SHOOT THEM,
THEY'LL DIE.

414
00:18:56,529 --> 00:18:58,213
THAT'S JUST
HOW IT WORKS.

415

WON'T BRING US
ANYTHING IN RETURN.

00:19:10,533 --> 00:19:12,160
JUST LEAVE

00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:49,838
THE YELLOW CAKE...

481
00:23:49,838 --> 00:23:51,532
NEXT TIME ON "COPPELION"...

482
00:23:51,532 --> 00:23:53,108
HARUTO.
