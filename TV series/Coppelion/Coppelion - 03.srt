00:07:58,507 --> 00:08:01,148
AND GRANNY AYAME HAS
NOW GONE MISSING.

162
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:03,142
ARE THERE
OTHER SURVIVORS,

163
00:08:03,142 --> 00:08:04,613
OR IS SHE IT?

164
00:08:04,613 --> 00:08:08,584
NO, THERE'S
THE KAWABATA FAMILY.

165
00:08:08,584 --> 00:08:11,144
OH, AND THERE'S
ALSO A MAN
NAMED HEIJI

166
00:08:11,144 --> 00:08:12,688
WHO LIVES
IN THIS AREA.

167
00:08:12,688 --> 00:08:14,141
STRANGELY, THOUGH,

168
00:08:14,141 --> 00:08:15,691
THEY'VE ALL
GONE MISSING.

169
00:08:15,691 --> 00:08:18,149
ACTUALLY WE'VE
ALREADY ENCOUNTERED
ALL OF THEM.

170
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:20,796
THAT LADY
IS THE ONLY ONE
WE HAVEN'T SEEN.

171
00:08:20,796 --> 00:08:22,143
THAT'S GREAT.

172
00:08:22,143 --> 00:08:24,143
THEY'VE BEEN RESCUED
AND ARE SAFE?

173
00:08:24,143 --> 00:08:26,635
[gasps]
NO, I'M AFRAID NOT, SIR.

174
00:08:26,635 --> 00:08:29,143
MR. KAWABATA IS DEAD.

175
00:08:29,143 --> 00:08:30,706
SO IS HIS WIFE.

176
00:08:30,706 --> 00:08:32,775
IT'S ALL
BECAUSE OF ME.

177
00:08:32,775 --> 00:08:34,145
I'M SO SORRY.

178
00:08:34,145 --> 00:08:36,746
IBARA, YOU KNOW
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

179
00:08:36,746 --> 00:08:38,514
SHE'S RIGHT.
WE ALL DID

180
00:08:38,514 --> 00:08:41,784
THE VERY BEST
WE COULD,
REALLY.

181
00:08:41,784 --> 00:08:44,587
WHAT ABOUT
THEIR DAUGHTER MIKU?
IS SHE SAFE?

182
00:08:45,588 --> 00:08:46,856
YES.

183
00:08:46,856 --> 00:08:48,824
SHE'S BEING
TAKEN GOOD CARE OF.

184
00:08:48,824 --> 00:08:51,594
THAT'S GOOD.
THAT'S REALLY GOOD,

185
00:08:51,594 --> 00:08:53,896
'CAUSE
THAT LITTLE GIRL
IS MY LAST HOPE.

186
00:08:53,896 --> 00:08:57,466
SHE WAS BORN
HERE IN THE CITY
AFTER THE ACCIDENT.

187
00:08:57,466 --> 00:09:00,503
THIS IS
HER HOMETOWN.

188
00:09:00,503 --> 00:09:02,148
PROFESSOR,
IF WE DON'T HURRY,

189
00:09:02,148 --> 00:09:03,506
GRANNY WON'T SURVIVE.

190
00:09:03,506 --> 00:09:05,142
TAKE US OUT, KAMATA.

191
00:09:05,142 --> 00:09:06,509
[gasps]

192
00:09:06,509 --> 00:09:08,577
WHERE
DO YOU THINK
SHE MIGHT BE?

193
00:09:08,577 --> 00:09:11,148
Professor: WE'RE
GOING TO SEARCH
THE SHRINE.

194
00:09:11,148 --> 00:09:13,883
GRANNY GOES THERE
TO PRAY.

195
00:09:13,883 --> 00:09:16,685
IT'S NORTH
OF THE RACETRACK.

196
00:09:16,685 --> 00:09:18,141
THE RACETRACK?

197
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:20,149
THAT'S A HIGHLY
CONTAMINATED AREA.

198
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:22,149
DO YOU BELIEVE
IT'S A ZONE?

199
00:09:22,149 --> 00:09:23,793
YES.
WE'VE BEEN THERE ALREADY,

200
00:09:23,793 --> 00:09:25,895
AND WE KNOW
YOUR SUITS WON'T HELP.

201
00:09:25,895 --> 00:09:27,596
HURRY UP, KAMATA!

202
00:09:27,596 --> 00:09:29,732
STEP ON IT!

203
00:09:32,568 --> 00:09:35,638
WHAT IS CAUSING ALL
OF THIS TO HAPPEN?

204
00:09:35,638 --> 00:09:39,149
IN ALL MY YEARS,
I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE IT.

205
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:42,444
THIS SEVERE
CONTAMINATION COMES
FROM SOMETHING.

206
00:09:42,444 --> 00:09:44,580
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THAT COULD BE?

207
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,581
ANY IDEAS?

208
00:09:45,581 --> 00:09:47,143
NOT AT THIS MOMENT,

209
00:09:47,143 --> 00:09:50,686
BUT I KNOW IT'S
DEFINITELY MAN-MADE.

210
00:09:50,686 --> 00:09:54,150
NOTHING
IN THE NATURAL WORLD
IS THIS HARMFUL.

211
00:09:58,794 --> 00:10:00,896
Mushanokoji:
I'VE COMPILED
THE LIST OF NAMES

212
00:10:00,896 --> 00:10:02,464
YOU REQUESTED,
VICE PRINCIPAL.

213
00:10:02,464 --> 00:10:03,799
YOU THINK
THIS DELIVERYMAN

214
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:06,802
IS THE ONE
PROVIDING RELIEF
IN THE OLD CAPITAL

215
00:10:06,802 --> 00:10:09,572
AND THAT HE'S ALSO
THE ONE WHO DEVELOPED

216
00:10:09,572 --> 00:10:13,143
THE ADVANCED
BARRIER SUITS
USED BY THE SURVIVORS?

217
00:10:13,143 --> 00:10:14,143
AFFIRMATIVE.

218
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,611
ONLY A SENIOR
SCIENTIST

219
00:10:15,611 --> 00:10:17,847
FROM TRISTAR
INDUSTRIES
WOULD BE CAPABLE

220
00:10:17,847 --> 00:10:19,782
OF CREATING
SOMETHING
LIKE THAT.

221
00:10:19,782 --> 00:10:21,450
SENIOR SCIENTIST, HMM?

222
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:24,453
IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT
THIS GUY'S PAY GRADE

223
00:10:24,453 --> 00:10:26,143
IS FAR BEYOND
THAT LEVEL.

224
00:10:26,143 --> 00:10:27,143
WHAT?

225
00:10:27,143 --> 00:10:29,141
CUT TO THE CHASE,
DOCTOR.

226
00:10:29,141 --> 00:10:30,141
WHO IS HE?

227
00:10:30,141 --> 00:10:32,146
HIS NAME IS DENJIRO SHIBA.

228
00:10:32,146 --> 00:10:35,798
HE'S ON THE LIST
OF THOSE WHO WENT MISSING
FOLLOWING THE ACCIDENT.

229
00:10:35,798 --> 00:10:39,146
HE SPECIALIZED
IN ATOMIC PHYSICS

230
00:10:39,146 --> 00:10:41,770
DURING HIS TENURE
AT TRISTAR INDUSTRIES.

231
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:44,473
HE WAS THE ONE
WHO DEVELOPED THE THEORY

232
00:10:44,473 --> 00:10:47,149
BEHIND THE BARRIER SUIT
OVER THREE DECADES AGO.

233
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:49,149
THAT'S NOT THE END
OF IT, EITHER.

234
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,146
PROFESSOR SHIBA
DESIGNED THE SYSTEM

235
00:10:52,146 --> 00:10:54,783
FOR THE PLANT THAT CAUSED
THE BIG ACCIDENT.

236
00:10:54,783 --> 00:10:56,149
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

237
00:10:56,149 --> 00:10:58,520
Mushanokoji:
HE BUILT THAT PLANT.

238
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,143
IT WAS HIS BABY.

239
00:11:04,472 --> 00:11:05,930
[counter beeping]

240
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,930
WE CAN'T GO
ANY FURTHER, PROFESSOR.

241
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:10,331
IT'S HIGHLY CONTAMINATED

242
00:11:10,331 --> 00:11:12,678
ALL THE WAY
TO THE TREES
TO THE NORTH.

243
00:11:12,678 --> 00:11:15,678
WHO KNOWS WHAT'LL
HAPPEN IF WE CONTINUE
IN THIS DIRECTION?

244
00:11:15,678 --> 00:11:16,681
DAMN IT.

245
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,678
WE'LL GO,
PROFESSOR SHIBA.

246
00:11:22,678 --> 00:11:24,677
THE TWO OF YOU
SHOULD WAIT HERE.

247
00:11:28,216 --> 00:11:30,185
TAKE THIS RADIO
WITH YOU.

248
00:11:30,185 --> 00:11:32,677
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING,
JUST LET ME KNOW.

249
00:11:32,677 --> 00:11:33,684
OH, YEAH.

250
00:11:35,056 --> 00:11:36,191
GIVE ME
YOUR SHOULDER.

251
00:11:38,426 --> 00:11:39,680
WHAT'S THIS?

252
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,129
IT'S A CURE-ALL
THAT WE DEVELOPED

253
00:11:41,129 --> 00:11:43,198
CALLED AETHER.

254
00:11:43,198 --> 00:11:44,682
WELL,
THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY,

255
00:11:44,682 --> 00:11:46,683
BUT IT'S REALLY JUST
A PREVENTATIVE MEASURE

256
00:11:46,683 --> 00:11:48,236
AGAINST MILD SYMPTOMS.

257
00:11:48,236 --> 00:11:50,405
IT DOESN'T LAST
THAT LONG, I'M AFRAID.

258
00:11:50,405 --> 00:11:53,241
IT'S ONLY GOOD
FOR 10 MINUTES
AFTER EXPOSURE.

259
00:11:53,241 --> 00:11:54,678
THIS IS
THE LAST OF IT,

260
00:11:54,678 --> 00:11:56,077
SO DON'T DO
ANYTHING RASH.

261
00:11:56,077 --> 00:11:59,214
IT ALMOST SOUNDS
LIKE A MAGIC POTION.

262
00:11:59,214 --> 00:12:01,676
WHAT EXACTLY
IS IT MADE OF?

263
00:12:01,676 --> 00:12:05,019
IT'S CREATED
FROM CELLS EXTRACTED
FROM EACH ONE OF US.

264
00:12:05,019 --> 00:12:06,187
WHAT?!

265
00:12:06,187 --> 00:12:08,122
A COPPELION'S
SOMATIC CELL

266
00:12:08,122 --> 00:12:11,326
CARRIES A SPECIAL
ION EXCHANGER.

267
00:12:11,326 --> 00:12:12,684
THAT'S INSANITY.

268
00:12:12,684 --> 00:12:15,230
HOW CAN YOU
BE OK WITH THAT?

269
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:18,681
YOU'RE VICTIMS
OF THEIR CRUEL EXPERIMENTS.

270
00:12:18,681 --> 00:12:21,302
WHY DO YOU DO
WHAT THEY SAY
LIKE MINDLESS PUPPETS?

271
00:12:23,104 --> 00:12:24,681
I JUST WANTED A CHANCE

272
00:12:24,681 --> 00:12:27,342
TO SEE THE CITY
WITH MY OWN EYES.

273
00:12:27,342 --> 00:12:30,678
WITHOUT THE GOVERNMENT
OR THE ACCIDENT,

274
00:12:30,678 --> 00:12:32,677
WE WOULD NEVER
HAVE BEEN BORN.

275
00:12:32,677 --> 00:12:35,679
THIS CITY,
AS BAD OFF AS IT IS,

276
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:38,319
WE HAVE
A DEEP CONNECTION TO IT.

277
00:12:38,319 --> 00:12:39,684
WE'VE NEVER
BEEN HERE BEFORE,

278
00:12:39,684 --> 00:12:42,323
BUT WHEN I GAZE
ACROSS ITS HORIZON,

279
00:12:42,323 --> 00:12:44,683
I FEEL A STRONG SENSE
OF NOSTALGIA.

280
00:12:44,683 --> 00:12:46,677
[gasps]
[gasps]

281
00:12:49,397 --> 00:12:51,299
I GUESS IT MAKES SENSE.

282
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:54,135
ULTIMATELY, THIS PLACE
IS MY HOMETOWN.

283
00:12:54,135 --> 00:12:55,680
[Shiba sighs]

284
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,339
WHAT STRONG CHILDREN.

285
00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:01,242
THEY'VE ACCEPTED
THEIR CRUEL FATE

286
00:13:01,242 --> 00:13:03,684
WHILE STILL
RETAINING THEIR PRIDE.

287
00:13:03,684 --> 00:13:07,684
I, ON THE OTHER HAND...

288
00:13:07,684 --> 00:13:09,676
Ibuse:
DENJIRO SHIBA,

289
00:13:09,676 --> 00:13:11,185
ONCE A HIGHLY
RESPECTED LEADER

290
00:13:11,185 --> 00:13:13,678
IN THE FIELD OF
ENERGY ENGINEERING.

291
00:13:13,678 --> 00:13:17,025
IT WAS HIS IDEA
TO BUILD A PLANT
IN THE OLD CAPITAL.

292
00:13:17,025 --> 00:13:19,060
THERE WAS STRONG
PUBLIC OUTCRY AT FIRST,

293
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,128
BUT IT GAVE WAY

294
00:13:20,128 --> 00:13:22,330
DUE TO HIS
TECHNICAL BRILLIANCE.

295
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,676
AND THEN
THE ACCIDENT
HAPPENED.

296
00:13:24,676 --> 00:13:26,334
GUESS THAT EXPLAINS
WHY HE CHOSE

297
00:13:26,334 --> 00:13:28,685
TO REMAIN IN THE CITY
DOING VOLUNTEER WORK.

298
00:13:28,685 --> 00:13:31,683
THE MAN FEELS GUILTY
FOR CAUSING THAT TRAGEDY.

299
00:13:33,107 --> 00:13:34,142
HMM.

300
00:13:34,142 --> 00:13:35,143
NARUSE.

301
00:13:35,143 --> 00:13:36,677
YES?

302
00:13:36,677 --> 00:13:37,680
WHAT'S THE LATEST?

303
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,679
HAVE YOU CAPTURED
THE DELIVERYMAN?

304
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:41,684
UH, WHAT?
DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT HIM?

305
00:13:41,684 --> 00:13:44,684
PROFESSOR,
THEY'RE IN CONTACT
WITH SOMEONE.

306
00:13:44,684 --> 00:13:47,221
NARUSE,
THAT DELIVERYMAN

307
00:13:47,221 --> 00:13:48,684
IS NO ORDINARY
CIVILIAN.

308
00:13:48,684 --> 00:13:52,678
HE'S A SCIENTIFIC
GENIUS FROM TRISTAR
INDUSTRIES,

309
00:13:52,678 --> 00:13:54,362
DENJIRO SHIBA,

310
00:13:54,362 --> 00:13:56,264
THE MAN
WHO DESIGNED THE PLANT

311
00:13:56,264 --> 00:13:57,684
THAT DESTROYED
THE OLD CAPITAL.

312
00:13:57,684 --> 00:14:00,301
THEY KNOW
WHO YOU ARE,

00:14:00,301 --> 00:14:02,679

WE'LL BE THERE
IN TWO HOURS.

314
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:05,340
DON'T LET HIM ESCAPE.
IS THAT CLEAR?

315
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,678
YES, SIR.
WE'LL GO CAPTURE
AND DETAIN HIM.

316
00:14:08,678 --> 00:14:12,677
SO, UM, DON'T YOU GUYS
THINK THE PROFESSOR
HAS HIS RADIO ON

317
00:14:12,677 --> 00:14:14,676
AND CAN HEAR
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?

318
00:14:14,676 --> 00:14:16,351
Shiba:
I HEARD EVERYTHING.

319
00:14:16,351 --> 00:14:18,086
THERE'S NO NEED
TO WORRY.

320
00:14:18,086 --> 00:14:19,682
I WON'T RUN OR HIDE.

321
00:14:19,682 --> 00:14:22,678
I WILL ATONE
FOR MY SINS.

322
00:14:22,678 --> 00:14:23,685
BUT RIGHT NOW,

323
00:14:23,685 --> 00:14:26,227
GRANNY IS
OUR MAIN PRIORITY.

324
00:14:30,678 --> 00:14:33,676
Woman:
H-HELP ME!
SOMEONE!

325
00:14:33,676 --> 00:14:34,676
HUH?

326
00:14:34,676 --> 00:14:36,676
THAT WAS GRANNY.

327
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:38,439
GRANNY,
WHERE ARE YOU?

328
00:14:38,439 --> 00:14:42,110
Ayame: THERE'S A GIANT CROW
CHASING AFTER ME!

329
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,678
[gasps]
GIANT CROW?

330
00:14:43,678 --> 00:14:46,347
I ESCAPED
TO THE ART MUSEUM!

331
00:14:46,347 --> 00:14:48,149
PLEASE COME SAVE ME!

332
00:14:48,149 --> 00:14:49,680
Shiba:
THE ART MUSEUM?

333
00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:53,021
IT'S IN THE FOREST
TO THE NORTHEAST.

334
00:14:53,021 --> 00:14:55,677
YOU GUYS TAKE
THE TRUCK, AND WE'LL
MEET YOU THERE.

335
00:14:55,677 --> 00:14:57,681
MAKE SURE
YOU STEP ON IT,
PROFESSOR.

336
00:14:57,681 --> 00:15:00,061
OK, IF YOU
HEAD EAST,

337
00:15:00,061 --> 00:15:02,681
THERE'S
AN ENTRANCE
TO ROUTE 15.

338
00:15:02,681 --> 00:15:04,399
THE ART MUSEUM
IS PAST IT.

339
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:05,400
ROGER THAT.

340
00:15:07,435 --> 00:15:11,039
PROFESSOR, I THINK
THIS SHOULD BE OUR
LAST VOLUNTEER MISSION.

341
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:12,173
WE'RE HUMANS.

342
00:15:12,173 --> 00:15:14,242
THERE'S NOT MUCH MORE
WE CAN DO.

343
00:15:14,242 --> 00:15:17,681
WE SHOULD LET THE GIRLS
TAKE OVER FROM HERE.

344
00:15:17,681 --> 00:15:22,016
KAMATA, YOU'VE BEEN
INVALUABLE TO ME.

345
00:15:22,016 --> 00:15:24,685
WHEN THE HELICOPTER
COMES, I WANT YOU
TO GET ON IT.

346
00:15:24,685 --> 00:15:27,221
FIND A NEW LIFE
OUTSIDE THE CITY.

347
00:15:27,221 --> 00:15:28,676
DON'T WORRY.

348
00:15:28,676 --> 00:15:30,992
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I INTEND TO DO,

349
00:15:30,992 --> 00:15:34,295
BUT ONLY
AFTER I MAKE SURE YOU GET
ON THAT HELICOPTER, TOO.

350
00:15:35,681 --> 00:15:39,100
PROFESSOR, WE'RE LEAVING
THIS CITY TOGETHER.

351
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,201
GOT THAT?

352
00:15:43,237 --> 00:15:45,440
[footsteps]

353
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,108
[all gasp]

354
00:15:48,242 --> 00:15:49,678
WHAT WAS THAT?

355
00:15:49,678 --> 00:15:52,246
IT CAME FROM
THE ART MUSEUM.
LET'S GO.

356
00:15:52,246 --> 00:15:55,316
HEY, NOT SO FAST!
WAIT FOR ME, IBARA!

357
00:15:57,681 --> 00:16:01,680
Taeko:
A FLOCK OF CROWS?

358
00:16:07,128 --> 00:16:08,679
WHAT JUST
HAPPENED HERE?

359
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:10,098
I DON'T KNOW.

360
00:16:10,098 --> 00:16:12,685
I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE
OF A DARK SHADOW
ABOVE ME,

361
00:16:12,685 --> 00:16:14,679
AND THEN THERE
WAS AN EXPLOSION.

362
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:16,003
GO FIND SOME COVER,

363
00:16:16,003 --> 00:16:18,172
AND STAY THERE
UNTIL I COME BACK.

364
00:16:18,172 --> 00:16:19,340
IBARA!

365
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,209
I'M GONNA GO RESCUE
GRANNY AYAME.

366
00:16:21,209 --> 00:16:23,010
YOU TWO WATCH OVER
THE PROFESSOR.

367
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:24,678
ALL RIGHT.

368
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,056
GRANNY AYAME,
ARE YOU THERE?!

369
00:16:35,056 --> 00:16:37,425
GRANNY!

370
00:16:38,681 --> 00:16:40,128
[echoed]
GRANNY, COME IN.

371
00:16:40,128 --> 00:16:41,129
OH.

372
00:16:42,363 --> 00:16:43,431
THAT RADIO...

373
00:16:44,685 --> 00:16:47,235
I WONDER IF IT'S HERS.
[footsteps]

374
00:16:47,235 --> 00:16:49,370
Taeko: IBARA!

375
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:51,105
WHAT ARE
YOU GUYS
DOING HERE?

376
00:16:51,105 --> 00:16:53,341
I TOLD YOU
TO WAIT UNTIL
I RETURNED.

377
00:16:53,341 --> 00:16:54,375
LOOK UP THERE!

378
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,110
[gasps]

379
00:16:58,179 --> 00:17:00,014
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

380
00:17:00,014 --> 00:17:02,116
IS IT A MONSTER
OR SOMETHING?

381
00:17:02,116 --> 00:17:03,284
I DON'T KNOW,

382
00:17:03,284 --> 00:17:05,386
BUT MAYBE THAT'S
WHAT GRANNY SAW,

383
00:17:05,386 --> 00:17:07,989
THE GIANT CROW.

384
00:17:07,989 --> 00:17:10,258
DID YOU SEE
ANY SIGN OF GRANNY?

385
00:17:10,258 --> 00:17:12,994
NOTHING MUCH,
JUST THIS RADIO
ON THE FLOOR.

386
00:17:12,994 --> 00:17:13,995
DAMN IT.

387
00:17:13,995 --> 00:17:15,196
WHAT'S GOING ON?

388
00:17:15,196 --> 00:17:18,332
WELL, MAYBE SHE JUST
RAN OFF ON HER OWN.

389
00:17:18,332 --> 00:17:20,201
WASN'T SHE
ONE OF THE ONES

390
00:17:20,201 --> 00:17:23,204
WHO ESCAPED FROM PRISON
LIKE THE OTHERS?

391
00:17:23,204 --> 00:17:25,678
GRANNY AYAME
WAS LEFT BEHIND

392
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:27,008
IN A NURSING HOME.

393
00:17:27,008 --> 00:17:28,409
LEFT BEHIND?
BUT WHY?

394
00:17:28,409 --> 00:17:32,113
THE ELDERLY
WERE ABANDONED
BY THEIR FAMILIES.

395
00:17:32,113 --> 00:17:34,382
THEY USED THE ACCIDENT
AS AN EXCUSE.

396
00:17:34,382 --> 00:17:38,680
THE OLDER FOLKS
WERE LEFT WITH NO CHOICE
BUT TO LIVE HERE.

397
00:17:40,188 --> 00:17:41,677
THAT'S AWFUL.

398
00:17:41,677 --> 00:17:43,391
HOW COULD THEY?

399
00:17:43,391 --> 00:17:45,259
IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

400
00:17:45,259 --> 00:17:48,679
IF I HADN'T BUILT
THAT DAMN THING,

401
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:51,999
NOBODY WOULD HAVE HAD
TO SUFFER LIKE THIS.

402
00:17:51,999 --> 00:17:53,134
[sighs]

403
00:17:53,134 --> 00:17:55,677
THESE HANDS
DESTROYED A CITY

404
00:17:55,677 --> 00:17:59,006
[crying]
AND RUINED
SO MANY LIVES.

405
00:17:59,006 --> 00:18:01,683
YOU WERE A SCIENTIST.
DON'T BLAME YOURSELF.

406
00:18:01,683 --> 00:18:03,679
THE CITY
WANTED THAT PLANT,

407
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,680
SO AS A SCIENTIST,
YOU WORKED HARD

408
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,679
TO GIVE THEM
WHAT THEY NEEDED.

409
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,084
YOU DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING WRONG.

410
00:18:10,084 --> 00:18:11,681
NO MATTER
WHAT PEOPLE SAY,

411
00:18:11,681 --> 00:18:13,679
I'LL ALWAYS
LOVE SCIENCE.

412
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:14,681
IT'S MY MOTHER.

413
00:18:14,681 --> 00:18:17,291
SCIENCE IS WHAT MADE ME.

414
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:20,677
[sighs]

415
00:18:20,677 --> 00:18:21,680
HUH?

416
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,683
DAMN IT,
IT'S COMING BACK!

417
00:18:23,683 --> 00:18:26,300
WHAT THE HELL IS
THAT THING, ANYWAY?

418
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,335
JUST A SEC.

419
00:18:27,335 --> 00:18:29,203
I'LL GIVE IT
A CLOSER LOOK.

420
00:18:29,203 --> 00:18:30,338
WHA--HUH? WAIT.

421
00:18:30,338 --> 00:18:31,684
WHY'D YOU TAKE OFF
YOUR GLASSES?

422
00:18:31,684 --> 00:18:33,374
YOU WON'T BE ABLE
TO SEE AS WELL.

423
00:18:33,374 --> 00:18:34,683
IT'S QUITE
THE OPPOSITE.

424
00:18:34,683 --> 00:18:37,111
TAEKO'S VISION
IS TOO POWERFUL.

425
00:18:37,111 --> 00:18:40,683
THE GLASSES
REDUCE HER SIGHT
TO REGULAR LEVELS.

426
00:18:40,683 --> 00:18:42,677
WHY DON'T I
GET TO HAVE

427
00:18:42,677 --> 00:18:44,185
COOL POWERS,
TOO?!

428
00:18:44,185 --> 00:18:45,684
I CAN SEE IT NOW.

429
00:18:45,684 --> 00:18:48,684
I KNOW WHAT THAT GIANT CROW
UP THERE REALLY IS.

430
00:18:48,684 --> 00:18:50,091
GOOD WORK, TAEKO.

431
00:18:50,091 --> 00:18:51,676
WHAT IS IT?

432
00:18:51,676 --> 00:18:53,678
IT'S A B-2 STEALTH BOMBER.

433
00:18:53,678 --> 00:18:56,677
IT'S SPECIALLY BUILT
TO AVOID RADAR DETECTION.

434
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,680
WAIT.
IT'S PREPARING TO LAND.

435
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,002
WHAT?

436
00:19:01,002 --> 00:19:03,680
THE ENTIRE CITY
IS OVERGROWN WITH TREES.

437
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,306
WHERE DOES IT THINK
IT'S GOING TO LAND?

438
00:19:05,306 --> 00:19:07,008
WAIT.
THERE IS ONE PLACE.

439
00:19:07,008 --> 00:19:10,044
THERE'S AN AIR BASE
BEHIND THE MUSEUM.

440
00:19:10,044 --> 00:19:13,680
Taeko: I DIDN'T KNOW
THE SELF-DEFENSE FORCE
HAD A STEALTH BOMBER.

441
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,384
WE DON'T, AND THAT
MEANS ONE THING,

442
00:19:16,384 --> 00:19:18,683
THAT THIS IS AN INVADER
FROM THE OUTSIDE.

443
00:19:18,683 --> 00:19:20,678
AN INVADER? REALLY?

444
00:19:20,678 --> 00:19:22,678
I WONDER
WHO THAT COULD BE.

445
00:19:22,678 --> 00:19:25,679
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
YOU'RE GOING TO FIND OUT,

446
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,685
CLASS PRESIDENT
IBARA NARUSE.

447
00:19:27,685 --> 00:19:29,683
[sighs]

448
00:19:29,683 --> 00:19:30,685
I THOUGHT SO.

449
00:19:32,685 --> 00:19:35,102
Taeko: I WISH
THERE WAS SOMETHING
WE COULD DO.

450
00:19:35,102 --> 00:19:36,683
Aoi: OH, ARE YOU
GOING TO BE

451
00:19:36,683 --> 00:19:38,105
ALL RIGHT
ON YOUR OWN?

452
00:19:38,105 --> 00:19:39,307
OF COURSE I AM.

453
00:19:39,307 --> 00:19:41,684
I HAVE THE STRENGTH
OF 10 MEN AFTER ALL.

454
00:19:41,684 --> 00:19:43,244
JUST LEAVE IT TO ME.

455
00:19:49,676 --> 00:19:52,676
HEY, THIS KIND OF
REMINDS ME OF SCHOOL.

456
00:19:52,676 --> 00:19:55,056
Ayame: LET ME GO! NO!

457
00:19:55,056 --> 00:19:57,682
SOMEONE HELP ME! OHH!

458
00:19:57,682 --> 00:20:00,227
Man: WE CAN'T LET YOU GO
AFTER WHAT YOU'VE SEEN.

459
00:20:00,227 --> 00:20:02,263
NOW SHUT UP, AND GET IN.

460
00:20:02,263 --> 00:20:04,065
I FOUND 'EM.
THEY HAVE GRANNY.

461
00:20:04,065 --> 00:20:05,066
HUH? WHAT THE...

462
00:20:05,066 --> 00:20:06,067
SHE DOESN'T HAVE A SUIT?

463
00:20:06,067 --> 00:20:07,068
SHE'S A MONSTER!

464
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:10,681

466
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:14,442
WHO ARE YOU
CALLING A MONSTER?!

00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:17,685
[yelling]

468
00:20:17,685 --> 00:20:19,280
BOSS,
WE DUMPED THE GOODS,

469
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,676
AND WE'RE
ON OUR WAY BACK.

470
00:20:20,676 --> 00:20:21,684
GOODS?

471
00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:25,019
[sighs]

IT'S A SMOKE SCREEN!

[Ayame gasping]

475
00:20:36,681 --> 00:20:39,266
GRANNY,
GET OUT OF THERE!

476
00:20:39,266 --> 00:20:41,168
SHIT.
FORGET ABOUT HER.

477
00:20:41,168 --> 00:20:42,681
JUST TAKE OFF.

478
00:20:48,676 --> 00:20:50,211
YOU SAVED ME.

479
00:20:55,683 --> 00:20:57,251
Ibara: THEY GOT AWAY.

480
00:20:58,419 --> 00:21:01,022
Taeko: IBARA!
HUH?

481
00:21:01,022 --> 00:21:03,024
WE GOT OURSELVES
A RIDE.

482
00:21:03,024 --> 00:21:04,676
HEY, NICE CAR.

483
00:21:04,676 --> 00:21:06,327
GRANNY AYAME,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

484
00:21:06,327 --> 00:21:08,329
DAMN DELIVERYMAN,

485
00:21:08,329 --> 00:21:10,097
WHAT TOOK YOU
SO LONG?

486
00:21:10,097 --> 00:21:12,233
MY APOLOGIES, GRANNY.

487
00:21:12,233 --> 00:21:14,679
WELL, THAT'S
ONE PROBLEM SOLVED.

488
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:17,038
KAMATA,
TAKE CARE OF GRANNY.

489
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:18,039
WHAT?

490
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:20,441
I OWE THE GIRLS
MY HELP.

491
00:21:20,441 --> 00:21:23,681
Shiba: SO LET'S GO CATCH
THE CROW THAT GOT AWAY.

492
00:21:23,681 --> 00:21:25,679
I WONDER WHAT
THEY COULD BE DOING

493
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,182
THAT REQUIRES
SUCH AN EXPENSIVE
AIRCRAFT LIKE THAT.

494
00:21:28,182 --> 00:21:31,419
AND WHO THE HECK ARE
THESE GUYS, ANYWAY?

495
00:21:31,419 --> 00:21:34,221
IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE
A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS
FOR THAT CREW.

496
00:21:34,221 --> 00:21:37,024
HOW 'BOUT WE JUST
GO AND ASK THEM?

497
00:21:37,024 --> 00:21:39,677
WELL, BUT THEY'RE
WAY UP IN THE AIR NOW.

498
00:21:39,677 --> 00:21:41,685
WE'RE GONNA NEED
A POWERFUL WEAPON.

499
00:21:41,685 --> 00:21:43,064
Aoi: IBARA!

500
00:21:44,098 --> 00:21:45,676
MAYBE THIS'LL HELP.

501
00:21:45,676 --> 00:21:47,681
[grunting]

502
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:50,204
I FOUND IT
OVER THERE
AT THE WAREHOUSE.

503
00:21:50,204 --> 00:21:52,679
SWEET!
A FREAKIN' HAND ARROW!

504
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:55,209
YOU'RE PRETTY HANDY
TO HAVE AROUND, AOI.

505
00:21:55,209 --> 00:21:57,378
IS EVERYONE READY?

506
00:21:57,378 --> 00:21:58,979
ALL SET!

507
00:21:58,979 --> 00:22:00,678
Ibara: COPPELION, MOVE OUT!

508
00:22:00,678 --> 00:22:02,383
LET'S FOLLOW THAT CROW.

509
00:22:07,439 --> 00:22:09,441
["Tokumade" by angela playing]

510
00:23:37,934 --> 00:23:39,930
Taeko: HIRED SOLDIERS...

511
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:41,266
YELLOW CAKE...

512
00:23:41,266 --> 00:23:42,938
THE DESIRES OF MODERN PEOPLE...

513
00:23:42,938 --> 00:23:44,938
A CROSS THAT MUST BE BEARED...

514
00:23:44,938 --> 00:23:46,934
A BOX NO ONE
KNOWS HOW TO CLOSE...

515
00:23:46,934 --> 00:23:48,937
THE PRIDE OF A SCIENTIST...

516
00:23:48,937 --> 00:23:50,575
NEXT TIME ON "COPPELION"...

517
00:23:50,575 --> 00:23:52,410
SUNSET.
