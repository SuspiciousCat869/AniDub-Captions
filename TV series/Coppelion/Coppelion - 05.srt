163
00:08:36,965 --> 00:08:38,360
PLEASE COME GET US

164
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,361
SO WE CAN
GET OUT OF HERE!

165
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:45,039
MR. KAJII, DO YOU
HAPPEN TO KNOW

166
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:47,363
OF A PLACE CALLED
JASA HEADQUARTERS?

167
00:08:47,363 --> 00:08:50,044
YES. THAT'S WHERE
WE ALL LIVE.

168
00:08:51,079 --> 00:08:52,369
IBARA, OVER THERE.

169
00:08:56,365 --> 00:08:59,754
DAMN. THOSE GHOSTS
DON'T GIVE UP
EASILY, DO THEY?

170
00:08:59,754 --> 00:09:02,363
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO
SNEAK OUR WAY OUT.

171
00:09:02,363 --> 00:09:04,368
AOI,
KEEP ABSOLUTELY QUIET.

172
00:09:04,368 --> 00:09:05,793
[gasps]

173
00:09:05,793 --> 00:09:08,763

00:09:10,361 --> 00:09:13,369
MM-MMM. MM-MMM.

176
00:09:13,369 --> 00:09:14,769
[soft grunting]

177
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:15,937
Gojiro: OH, NO.

178
00:09:15,937 --> 00:09:17,360
SHE'S HAVING
CONTRACTIONS
AGAIN.

179
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,360
Taeko: OH, NO.

180
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,360
THERE THEY ARE!

181
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,365
[girls gasp]

182
00:09:20,365 --> 00:09:22,360
WE'VE BEEN SPOTTED.
LET'S GO.

183
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,365
TAKE 'EM OUT!

184
00:09:23,365 --> 00:09:24,365
DAMN IT.

185
00:09:32,787 --> 00:09:36,057
LOOKS LIKE YOU NEED
A LITTLE BIT OF HELP
THERE, EH, IBUKI?

186
00:09:36,057 --> 00:09:37,361
MAYBE A LITTLE.

187
00:09:37,361 --> 00:09:38,993
WHO IS THIS GUY?

188
00:09:38,993 --> 00:09:40,363
HE'S
ONE OF US.

189
00:09:40,363 --> 00:09:42,360
PICK UP THE PACE, FOLKS.

190
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,363
THE GHOSTS
MEAN BUSINESS.

191
00:09:44,363 --> 00:09:46,368
EVERYONE GET
IN THE ARMORED VEHICLE!

192
00:09:48,069 --> 00:09:49,363
HEH HEH HEH.

193
00:09:49,363 --> 00:09:51,363
[yelling]
TAKE THIS!

194
00:09:52,363 --> 00:09:54,360
[laughs]

195
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,778
I'LL WASH YOU
ALL THE WAY
TO THE OCEAN!

196
00:09:56,778 --> 00:09:57,779
[laughs]

197
00:09:57,779 --> 00:09:59,369
HOW DO YOU
LIKE ME NOW?!

198
00:09:59,369 --> 00:10:00,369
[laughs]

199
00:10:00,369 --> 00:10:01,369
HURRY UP!

200
00:10:01,369 --> 00:10:03,051
CAN YOU WALK?

201
00:10:03,051 --> 00:10:04,852
YEAH.

202
00:10:04,852 --> 00:10:05,953
TAEKO, BEHIND YOU!

203
00:10:05,953 --> 00:10:06,954
[gasps]

204
00:10:06,954 --> 00:10:08,990
[machine gun fires]

205
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:11,993
PICK IT UP.
I'M ALMOST OUT OF WATER.

206
00:10:11,993 --> 00:10:13,361
HURRY! GET IN!

207
00:10:13,361 --> 00:10:14,362
Taeko:
WE'RE IN.

208
00:10:14,362 --> 00:10:16,064
EVERYBODY'S
INSIDE NOW!

209
00:10:16,064 --> 00:10:18,361
STEP ON IT, GENNAI!

210
00:10:18,361 --> 00:10:19,366
YOU GOT IT!

211
00:10:26,874 --> 00:10:30,078
[panting]
OH, MAN.
THAT WAS CLOSE.

212
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:31,946
THEY HAD GUNS,
AND THEY WERE
SHOOTING AT ME.

213
00:10:31,946 --> 00:10:33,364
AOI'S TAKING IT HARD.
THAT WAS INSANE...

214
00:10:33,364 --> 00:10:35,883
HOW ARE YOU DOING?
[gasps]

215
00:10:35,883 --> 00:10:37,368
[gasping]
TAEKO!

216
00:10:43,411 --> 00:10:45,091
Ibuse:
VICE PRINCIPAL,

217
00:10:45,091 --> 00:10:47,706
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
THE SELF-DEFENSE
FORCE, RIGHT?

218
00:10:47,706 --> 00:10:50,706
THEN HOW DID WE
GET ROPED INTO
A SECURITY DETAIL?

219
00:10:50,706 --> 00:10:53,142
AREN'T THERE GUARDS
FOR THIS SORT
OF THING?

220
00:10:53,142 --> 00:10:55,011
IT'S THE PRIME MINISTER'S
ORDERS.

221
00:10:55,011 --> 00:10:56,145
Man: AH!

222
00:10:56,145 --> 00:10:59,148
THERE YOU ARE,
MISHIMA. [chuckles]

223
00:10:59,148 --> 00:11:01,150
THANKS FOR ALL
YOUR HARD WORK.

224
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:04,120
I CAME ALL THIS WAY
JUST TO SEE YOU.

225
00:11:05,704 --> 00:11:07,390
PRIME MINISTER
I ASSURE YOU

226
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:10,159
WE MAINTAIN
EXTREMELY CLEAN
AIR HERE.

227
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:13,095
YOU DON'T
NEED TO WEAR
THAT MASK.

228
00:11:13,095 --> 00:11:16,098
THIS CITY IS RATHER CLOSE
TO THE CONTAMINATED ZONE.

229
00:11:16,098 --> 00:11:18,167
THERE'S ALWAYS
THE POSSIBILITY.

230
00:11:18,167 --> 00:11:20,136
CONTAMINATION'S
NOT A PROBLEM HERE.

231
00:11:20,136 --> 00:11:22,706
A MASK ALONE
DOESN'T HELP ANYWAY.

232
00:11:22,706 --> 00:11:25,704
YOU HAVE TO WEAR
A FULL SUIT.

233
00:11:25,704 --> 00:11:27,176
I HAVE AN IDEA.

234
00:11:27,176 --> 00:11:29,704
LET'S TALK
INSIDE MY LIMOUSINE.

235
00:11:30,706 --> 00:11:32,215
Ibuse: GUESS
HE'S NOT GOING

236
00:11:32,215 --> 00:11:34,116
TO TAKE
THAT THING OFF,
IS HE?

237
00:11:34,116 --> 00:11:36,706
THE PRIME MINISTER
IS IGNORANT,

238
00:11:36,706 --> 00:11:39,155
NOT UNLIKE MOST
OF HIS CONSTITUENCY.

239
00:11:39,155 --> 00:11:41,424
Prime Minister:
THANK YOU FOR
TAKING THE RISK

240
00:11:41,424 --> 00:11:43,706
TO BROADCAST
THAT VIDEO
THE OTHER DAY.

241
00:11:43,706 --> 00:11:46,711
THE INTERNATIONAL
CONFERENCE IS
BEGINNING TOMORROW.

242
00:11:46,711 --> 00:11:49,711
THERE WILL BE
LEADERS FROM ALL
AROUND THE WORLD

243
00:11:49,711 --> 00:11:51,467
MEETING
IN THE NEW CAPITAL.

244
00:11:51,467 --> 00:11:53,707
IT'S A GREAT
OPPORTUNITY.

245
00:11:53,707 --> 00:11:55,338
THE WORLD
WILL COME TOGETHER

246
00:11:55,338 --> 00:11:57,106
TO GAIN A BETTER
UNDERSTANDING

247
00:11:57,106 --> 00:11:58,712
OF ENVIRONMENTAL
POLLUTION.

248
00:11:58,712 --> 00:12:01,244
SO, VICE PRINCIPAL MISHIMA,

249
00:12:01,244 --> 00:12:04,146
HOW ARE THOSE DOLLS
OF OURS PERFORMING?

250
00:12:04,146 --> 00:12:06,148
THE DOLLS?

251
00:12:06,148 --> 00:12:08,284
OH, YEAH.
I'VE HEARD OF THEM.

252
00:12:08,284 --> 00:12:10,712
THEY'RE CALLED
COPPER ION OR
SOMETHING, RIGHT?

253
00:12:10,712 --> 00:12:12,321
IT'S COPPELION, SIR.

254
00:12:12,321 --> 00:12:14,423
Ibara: VICE PRINCIPAL,
I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

255
00:12:14,423 --> 00:12:16,459
TAEKO'S BEEN SHOT.
PARDON, SIR.

256
00:12:16,459 --> 00:12:18,712
IS SHE IN ANY DANGER
OF DYING?

257
00:12:18,712 --> 00:12:21,130
NO, SIR.
SHE'LL SURVIVE,

258
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:24,267
BUT EVEN WITH
OUR REGENERATIVE
ABILITIES,

259
00:12:24,267 --> 00:12:26,711
SHE'LL NEED AT LEAST
A WEEK OF BED REST.

260
00:12:26,711 --> 00:12:28,404
I DON'T THINK
WE'LL BE ABLE

261
00:12:28,404 --> 00:12:30,172
TO EVADE THE GHOSTS
THAT LONG.

262
00:12:31,706 --> 00:12:33,442
ARE YOU REFERRING
TO THE FIRST DIVISION?

263
00:12:33,442 --> 00:12:34,443
[crash]

264
00:12:34,443 --> 00:12:37,446
[gasping]

265
00:12:37,446 --> 00:12:41,117
D-DID YOU SAY,
"THE FIRST DIVISION"?

266
00:12:41,117 --> 00:12:42,451
Ibara:
VICE PRINCIPAL,

267
00:12:42,451 --> 00:12:44,708
WE REALLY
NEED YOU TO SEND
THAT HELICOPTER

268
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:47,705
TO HELP GET TAEKO
AND THE PREGNANT
LADY TO SAFETY.

269
00:12:47,705 --> 00:12:48,709
ME, TOO! ME, TOO!

270
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:49,713
IT'LL BE THERE A.S.A.--

271
00:12:49,713 --> 00:12:51,260
Prime Minister: WAIT!

272
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:55,064
ELIMINATING THE ENEMY
IS THE FIRST PRIORITY.

273
00:12:55,064 --> 00:12:57,709
WHO IS THAT,
AND WHAT DOES HE MEAN?

274
00:12:57,709 --> 00:13:00,436
HE OBVIOUSLY
DOESN'T KNOW
WE'RE A RESCUE UNIT

275
00:13:00,436 --> 00:13:02,171
AND NOT
A FIGHTING UNIT.

276
00:13:02,171 --> 00:13:05,709
[groans] I AM
PRIME MINISTER NATSUME!

277
00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:08,711
YOU'RE MY SUBORDINATE,
AND YOU'LL DO AS I SAY!

278
00:13:08,711 --> 00:13:12,705
YOU ARE NOW OFFICIALLY
A FIGHTING UNIT.
YOU HEAR ME?!

279
00:13:12,705 --> 00:13:15,318
BUT, SIR, THEY'RE
NOT EQUIPPED FOR
THAT ASSIGNMENT.

280
00:13:15,318 --> 00:13:17,711
Ibara: I DON'T CARE IF
YOU'RE THE PRIME MINISTER!

281
00:13:17,711 --> 00:13:21,023
WE'RE HERE
FOR RESCUE MISSIONS, IDIOT!

282
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,258
WHAT?!

283
00:13:22,258 --> 00:13:23,710
YOU INSOLENT GIRL!

284
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:27,096
THERE ARE
A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE
WHO NEED OUR HELP.

285
00:13:27,096 --> 00:13:29,365
NOW LISTEN HERE,
YOU STUPID CHILD!

286
00:13:29,365 --> 00:13:31,711
I AM THE MOST
IMPORTANT MAN
IN JAPAN,

287
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:33,369
AND MY ORDER
IS FINAL!

288
00:13:33,369 --> 00:13:34,370
[gasps]

289
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,138
WIPE OUT
THE FIRST DIVISION!

290
00:13:36,138 --> 00:13:39,707
AND I'M NOT SENDING
A SINGLE HELICOPTER
UNTIL YOU DO!

291
00:13:39,707 --> 00:13:43,045
JUST A MINUTE,
PRIME MINISTER!
YOU LISTEN TO ME!

292
00:13:43,045 --> 00:13:44,708
YOU THERE,
PRIME MINISTER?

293
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:48,351
NO! IBARA,
WHY'D YOU YELL AT HIM
LIKE THAT?!

294
00:13:48,351 --> 00:13:50,704
MM, I MIGHT
HAVE OVERREACTED.

295
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,421
I'M SORRY, AOI.

296
00:13:52,421 --> 00:13:55,057
YOU'RE SCREAMING
LIKE LITTLE BABIES
BACK THERE.

297
00:13:55,057 --> 00:13:57,326
QUIET DOWN NOW,
AND ACT YOUR AGE!

298
00:13:57,326 --> 00:13:59,362
[whimpers]
WHY'S HE YELLING?

299
00:13:59,362 --> 00:14:00,711
WHAT DID I DO?

300
00:14:00,711 --> 00:14:03,032
HE'S LIKE THAT
TO EVERYONE.

301
00:14:03,032 --> 00:14:05,704
HE IS OUR LEADER,
FOREMAN KUROBE.

302
00:14:05,704 --> 00:14:07,103
A FOREMAN?

303
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,270
THAT'S RIGHT.

304
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:10,206
AND I'M GENNAI,
THE HANDYMAN.

305
00:14:10,206 --> 00:14:12,174
I'M PLEASED
TO MEET YOU.

306
00:14:12,174 --> 00:14:13,342
YOU, TOO.

307
00:14:13,342 --> 00:14:15,710
WE'RE THE UNIT--
OH, WE KNOW.

308
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:19,382
YOU'RE THAT SPECIAL
UNIT THEY CALL
COPPELION, RIGHT?

309
00:14:19,382 --> 00:14:22,704
YOU CAME
DOWN HERE TO RESCUE
FOLKS LIKE US.

310
00:14:22,704 --> 00:14:24,708
WELL, WE'RE TRYING
TO HELP OUT.

311
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:27,223
[sighs]
BUT I'M SORRY.

312
00:14:27,223 --> 00:14:29,709
WE CAN'T DO THAT
WITHOUT A HELICOPTER.

313
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:33,129
HEY, FOREMAN,
I'M WORRIED ABOUT
MY DAUGHTER'S CONDITION.

314
00:14:33,129 --> 00:14:35,097
TAKE US BACK
TO JASA HEADQUARTERS

315
00:14:35,097 --> 00:14:36,706
SO SHE CAN GET
SOME REST.

316
00:14:36,706 --> 00:14:38,200
THIS IS WHY
I TOLD YOU

317
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,712
NOT TO GO WALKING
OUTSIDE ON YOUR OWN.

318
00:14:40,712 --> 00:14:42,712
WE'VE ALL SEEN
THAT THE GHOSTS

319
00:14:42,712 --> 00:14:44,710
HAVE BEEN ACTING
STRANGE LATELY.

320
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:47,343
BUT IBUKI
IS NEARLY
FULL-TERM NOW.

321
00:14:47,343 --> 00:14:49,011
SHE COULD
GO INTO LABOR

322
00:14:49,011 --> 00:14:50,704
AT JUST ABOUT
ANY TIME.

323
00:14:50,704 --> 00:14:52,706
Kurobe:
I'M WELL AWARE OF THAT.

324
00:14:52,706 --> 00:14:55,084
NOW LET'S GET THE HELL
BACK TO OUR HIDEOUT.

325
00:14:55,084 --> 00:14:57,086
Mishima:
PRIME MINISTER
NATSUME,

326
00:14:57,086 --> 00:15:00,122
PLEASE RECONSIDER
YOUR ORDER
TO NARUSE.

327
00:15:00,122 --> 00:15:03,259
WE SHOULD
AT LEAST GO RESCUE
THE PREGNANT WOMAN.

328
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:06,707
CHIEF CABINET
SECRETARY...

329
00:15:06,707 --> 00:15:10,299
Secretary: RIGHT NOW,
NOTHING YOU SAY WILL
GET THROUGH TO HIM.

330
00:15:10,299 --> 00:15:12,301
Mishima:
THE PRIME MINISTER
TURNED PALE

331
00:15:12,301 --> 00:15:14,707
THE MOMENT
I MENTIONED
THE FIRST DIVISION.

332
00:15:14,707 --> 00:15:16,372
DOES THAT HAVE
SOMETHING TO DO

333
00:15:16,372 --> 00:15:17,712
WITH WHY HE
WON'T RESPOND?

334
00:15:17,712 --> 00:15:20,276
I'M A VERY BUSY MAN,
VICE PRINCIPAL.

335
00:15:20,276 --> 00:15:22,011
I'M SORRY,
BUT THE CONFERENCE

336
00:15:22,011 --> 00:15:23,709
IS MY PRIORITY
RIGHT NOW.

337
00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:25,114
IT SHOULDN'T
BE A PROBLEM

338
00:15:25,114 --> 00:15:27,416
TO HAVE THE DOLLS
HANG IN A LITTLE LONGER,

339
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:30,352
CONSIDERING THE MONEY
WE SPENT CREATING THEM.

340
00:15:31,387 --> 00:15:33,389
Ibuse: THAT BONY
OLD BASTARD!

341
00:15:33,389 --> 00:15:35,424
I'VE KNOWN OUGAI
A LONG TIME.

342
00:15:35,424 --> 00:15:37,704
HE CAN BE HARD
TO DEAL WITH,

343
00:15:37,704 --> 00:15:41,704
BUT WITHOUT HIM,
ALL OF JAPAN WOULD HAVE
BEEN A WRECK BY NOW.

344
00:15:41,704 --> 00:15:44,366
OH? YOU WOULD THINK
A PATRIOT LIKE THAT

345
00:15:44,366 --> 00:15:47,169
WOULD GIVE
A DAMN ABOUT
THE OLD CAPITAL.

346
00:15:47,169 --> 00:15:49,704
HIS HANDS ARE TIED
LIKE OURS, IBUSE,

347
00:15:49,704 --> 00:15:53,275
WHICH IS WHY WE
HAVE TO GO TO A LESS
THAN OPTIMAL PLAN B.

348
00:15:53,275 --> 00:15:54,706
WHAT?

349
00:15:54,706 --> 00:15:57,712
WE'LL HAVE TO CALL IN
THE CLEANUP CREW.

350
00:15:57,712 --> 00:15:59,712
Gennai: WE'RE HERE.

351
00:15:59,712 --> 00:16:02,351
Aoi: THOSE ARE SOME
STRANGE-LOOKING BUILDINGS.

352
00:16:02,351 --> 00:16:05,121
[scoffs] MOST OF 'EM
GOT SO CONTAMINATED,

353
00:16:05,121 --> 00:16:07,705
EVEN A PIG
WOULDN'T LIVE THERE.

354
00:16:07,705 --> 00:16:11,393
THEY USED TO BE
MAJESTIC MONUMENTS
TO SCIENCE.

355
00:16:11,393 --> 00:16:14,063
NOW THEY'RE JUST
WITHERING HEAPS OF RUST.

356
00:16:15,364 --> 00:16:17,133
WE JUST PASSED GATE ONE,

357
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:19,712
WHICH CAN ONLY BE
OPENED OR CLOSED
FROM THE INSIDE.

358
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:22,138
IF AN INTRUDER
TRIES TO GET IN,

359
00:16:22,138 --> 00:16:24,706
A SIREN SOUNDS, AND
THE GATE IS ELECTRIFIED.

360
00:16:24,706 --> 00:16:27,009
[radio whines]
Mishima: NARUSE, COME IN.

361
00:16:27,009 --> 00:16:29,706
VICE PRINCIPAL.
WHAT'S THE LATEST
ON THE HELICOPTER?

362
00:16:29,706 --> 00:16:32,248
I CAN'T SAY THAT
I HAVE GOOD NEWS.

363
00:16:32,248 --> 00:16:35,704
WE'VE BEEN ORDERED
TO GO TO THE CONFERENCE
AS SECURITY.

364
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:37,119
NO WAY!

365
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:39,710
HOW ARE WE
GOING TO HANDLE THIS
WITHOUT ANY SUPPORT?

366
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,123
CALM DOWN.

367
00:16:41,123 --> 00:16:43,709
THE CONFERENCE WILL BE
OVER IN THREE DAYS.

368
00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:45,161
THREE DAYS.

369
00:16:45,161 --> 00:16:46,708
BUT THAT'S
PRETTY LONG.

370
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:49,713
Mishima: YOU'LL JUST
HAVE TO HANG IN THERE.

371
00:16:49,713 --> 00:16:53,335
I SHOULD BE ABLE
TO HOLD OUT FOR
ANOTHER THREE DAYS.

372
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,338
WE CAN DO IT, SIR.

373
00:16:56,338 --> 00:16:58,340
YOU SHOULDN'T BE
BY YOURSELF, THOUGH.

374
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,342
I'LL MOBILIZE SOMETHING
FROM THIS END.

375
00:17:00,342 --> 00:17:01,343
HUH?

376
00:17:01,343 --> 00:17:03,345
Aoi: HEY, WHAT'S THAT?

377
00:17:03,345 --> 00:17:05,705
Kurobe: HOME, SWEET HOME.

378
00:17:05,705 --> 00:17:09,318
IT'S THE LARGEST SAFE ZONE
IN THIS CITY.

379
00:17:09,318 --> 00:17:11,710
WE CALL IT THE PLANET.

380
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:19,094
[computerized]
WELCOME TO THE PLANET,

381
00:17:19,094 --> 00:17:22,064
HOME TO THE SCIENCE
OF THE FUTURE.

382
00:17:22,064 --> 00:17:25,267
WOW. IT'S SO COOL.

383
00:17:25,267 --> 00:17:27,303
IT'S LIKE
A SPACE STATION.

384
00:17:27,303 --> 00:17:30,272
Kurobe: HMPH.
WHEN YOU'VE LIVED HERE
AS LONG AS WE HAVE,

385
00:17:30,272 --> 00:17:31,709
IT CAN FEEL
LIKE A PRISON.

00:17:40,709 --> 00:17:43,319
WHY DON'T YOU
INTRODUCE YOURSELF?

390
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:46,388
I AM YOUR ROBOT GUIDE
TO JASA.

391
00:17:46,388 --> 00:17:49,058
MY NAME IS NO-SENSE.

392
00:17:49,058 --> 00:17:51,327
MASTER GENNAI
GAVE ME THIS NAME

393
00:17:51,327 --> 00:17:54,706
BECAUSE I
POSSESS A HEART
RICH IN EMOTIONS.

UH...

YOU MIGHT
WANT TO CONSIDER
A DIFFERENT NAME.

396
00:17:59,201 --> 00:18:01,403
HE POSSESSES
ARTIFICIAL
INTELLIGENCE,

397
00:18:01,403 --> 00:18:04,709
BUT HAS TO BE TOLD
EVERY LITTLE THING
TO UNDERSTAND.

DO WE NEED TO DO

404
00:18:16,252 --> 00:18:18,704
TO TAKE CARE
OF THE GIRL
WITH THE GLASSES?

TO NEED A LOT OF OXYGEN
TO HELP HER HEAL.

HEY, THERE'S
THE OXYGEN CHAMBER.

408

I USE IT
FOR ANTI-AGING
TREATMENTS.

409
00:18:29,265 --> 00:18:31,133
WE'RE GONNA NEED
TO CLEAN IT.

410
00:18:31,133 --> 00:18:33,709
THAT DAMN THING REEKS
OF OLD-MAN ODORS.

I'M SORRY.

414

I'VE BECOME
A BURDEN TO YOU

415
00:18:39,308 --> 00:18:42,044
WHEN YOU WERE
COUNTING ON ME THE MOST.

416
00:18:42,044 --> 00:18:43,705
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

417
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:46,706
YOU SHOWED
COURAGE IN SAVING
A PREGNANT WOMAN.

418
00:18:46,706 --> 00:18:48,150
IBARA'S RIGHT,

419
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:50,019
AND THIS GIVES ME
AN OPPORTUNITY

420
00:18:50,019 --> 00:18:53,222
TO SHOW I CAN
KICK SOME BUTT
WHILE YOU'RE OUT,

421
00:18:53,222 --> 00:18:55,057
SO TAKE YOUR TIME

DON'T WORRY.

BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY,
YOU SAVED THE BABY.

KIND OF ACTED
ON ITS OWN.

YOU GUYS MUST NEED

A LOT OF ELECTRICITY
TO POWER THIS PLACE.

439

IT DOES TAKE
A LOT OF ELECTRICITY,

440
00:19:37,704 --> 00:19:39,168
BUT IT CAN BE PROVIDED

441
00:19:39,168 --> 00:19:41,437
WHEN YOU HAVE
A STEADY ENERGY SOURCE.

442

YOU MEAN SOMETHING
LIKE SOLAR POWER?

BE ENOUGH.

00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,712
Mishima: WHAT?

473
00:20:59,712 --> 00:21:02,704
I CAN'T HEAR YOU WELL,
MUSHANOKOJI.

474
00:21:02,704 --> 00:21:05,712
CAN YOU GET ME
IN CONTACT WITH
THE CLEANUP CREW?

475
00:21:05,712 --> 00:21:08,323
AS I WAS TRYING
TO TELL YOU,
VICE PRINCIPAL,

476
00:21:08,323 --> 00:21:10,713
THIS IS
A CLEAR VIOLATION
OF THE LAW.

477
00:21:10,713 --> 00:21:13,711
PRESENTLY, SIR,
YOUR JURISDICTION

478
00:21:13,711 --> 00:21:17,066
IS SOLELY LIMITED
TO THE MEDICAL UNIT
OF COPPELION

479
00:21:17,066 --> 00:21:19,368
HEADED
BY IBARA NARUSE.

480
00:21:19,368 --> 00:21:22,709
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO CONTACT ANY MEMBER
OUTSIDE YOUR GROUP.

481
00:21:22,709 --> 00:21:26,712
ONLY THE PRIME MINISTER
COULD MAKE THAT KIND
OF AN EXCEPTION FOR YOU.

482
00:21:26,712 --> 00:21:28,710
MUSHANOKOJI...

483
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:31,113
WOULD YOU BE
INTERESTED IN EATING

484
00:21:31,113 --> 00:21:34,349
THE MOST
DELICIOUS SUKIYAKI
IN ALL OF KYOTO?

485
00:21:34,349 --> 00:21:36,705
YES, I WOULD.

486
00:21:38,387 --> 00:21:39,421
HUH?

487
00:21:39,421 --> 00:21:41,056
THIS IS VICE
PRINCIPAL MISHIMA.

488
00:21:41,056 --> 00:21:43,225
CHANNEL THREE,
CLEANUP CREW,
COME IN.

489
00:21:44,704 --> 00:21:47,704
Boy: WHAT CAN I DO
FOR YOU, VICE PRINCIPAL?

490
00:21:47,704 --> 00:21:51,709
I WANT YOU TO RENDEZVOUS
WITH THE MEDICAL UNIT
IMMEDIATELY.

491
00:21:51,709 --> 00:21:54,069
THE MEDICAL UNIT?

492
00:21:54,069 --> 00:21:57,005
OH, YOU MEAN
CLASS PRESIDENT
IBARA NARUSE.

493
00:21:57,005 --> 00:21:59,706
ROGER THAT, VICE PRINCIPAL.

494
00:21:59,706 --> 00:22:01,343
I'M ON MY WAY.

495
00:22:07,567 --> 00:22:09,569
["Tokumade" by angela playing]

496
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:39,392
Ibara: THE FIRST DIVISION...

497
00:23:39,392 --> 00:23:40,527
THE GHOST'S LAIR...

498
00:23:40,527 --> 00:23:42,032
THE WHITE COAT...

499
00:23:42,032 --> 00:23:44,028
A HEAVY RESPONSIBILITY...

500
00:23:44,028 --> 00:23:46,034
A CURSE, PITIFUL CREATURES...

501
00:23:46,034 --> 00:23:47,767
A CAREFULLY THOUGHT-OUT PLAN...

502
00:23:47,767 --> 00:23:48,928
THE SIMPLE THINGS...

503
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:50,187
NEXT TIME ON "COPPELION"...

504
00:23:50,187 --> 00:23:51,731
PLANET.
