TO HEAD TOWARDS

FINALLY YOU STOPPED.

Kanon: HEY THERE.
[gasps]

167
00:08:08,533 --> 00:08:10,840
THIS IS
A NICE SURPRISE.

168
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,842
BEFORE WE GET
TO THE SARCOPHAGUS,

169
00:08:12,842 --> 00:08:15,244
LET'S BEAT THE CRAP
OUT OF THIS LITTLE WUSS.

170
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:17,213
IT'S WORKING.
THE OZU SISTERS

171
00:08:17,213 --> 00:08:18,881
ARE STARTING
TO TAKE THE BAIT.

172

[wind blowing]

173
00:08:20,049 --> 00:08:22,251
CHECK IT OUT.
DO YOU SEE THOSE CLOUDS?

174
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,534
THE WIND IS STARTING
TO PICK UP.

175
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,856
BUT IT WAS SUNNY

176
00:08:26,856 --> 00:08:28,534
JUST A FEW
MINUTES AGO.

177
00:08:28,534 --> 00:08:31,530
WE'RE DOWN NOW
TO MAYBE SEVEN
OR EIGHT HOURS AT THE MOST.

178
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:32,537
SEVEN OR EIGHT HOURS?

179
00:08:32,537 --> 00:08:34,532
THEN WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO GET THE TRAIN

180
00:08:34,532 --> 00:08:37,535
UP AND RUNNING
A LOT FASTER THAN
WE PLANNED. GREAT.

181
00:08:37,535 --> 00:08:40,035
Kanon: COME BACK HERE,
YOU TWERP!

183
00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:43,537
YOU WON'T GET AWAY,
YOU LITTLE RAT!

184
00:08:43,537 --> 00:08:45,875
HA HA!

185
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:48,077
HARUTO,
WHAT TIME YOU GOT?

186
00:08:48,077 --> 00:08:49,945
0900 HOURS.

187
00:08:49,945 --> 00:08:52,534
WE'VE GOT
UNTIL SUNSET.

188
00:08:52,534 --> 00:08:55,017
DAMN THAT AOI FUKASAKU.

189
00:08:55,017 --> 00:08:57,019
I DON'T KNOW WHERE
SHE'S GONE OFF TO,

190
00:08:57,019 --> 00:08:59,088
BUT I'M GONNA FIND HER,
THAT'S FOR SURE.

191
00:08:59,088 --> 00:09:00,534
AW, JEEZ.

192
00:09:00,534 --> 00:09:03,529
I KNEW
I SHOULDN'T HAVE
GONE OUTSIDE AGAIN.

193
00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:06,896
I WANNA GO BACK
TO THE PLANET'S
STOREROOM.

194
00:09:06,896 --> 00:09:11,066
MISS AOI, THAT WOULD
NOT DO YOU ANY GOOD
OR SOLVE ANYTHING.

195
00:09:11,066 --> 00:09:12,935
YOU MUST REMAIN STRONG

196
00:09:12,935 --> 00:09:15,534
AND OVERCOME THE OBSTACLES
THAT ARE FACING YOU.

00:09:15,534 --> 00:09:17,273
STOP LECTURING ME,

THERE ARE THINGS
IN THIS WORLD

THAT I CAN'T
DO ANYTHING ABOUT!

200
00:09:20,876 --> 00:09:23,145
I THINK I SEE...
NO MATTER WHAT I DO,

201
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:25,881
I CAN'T WIN AGAINST
THOSE TWO SISTERS!

202
00:09:25,881 --> 00:09:30,085
THAT IS NOT TRUE.

203
00:09:30,085 --> 00:09:32,538
THE WORLD IS
A DARK AND SAD PLACE

204
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:36,091
ONLY IF YOU MAKE IT OUT
TO BE LIKE THAT.

YOU PIECE OF JUNK.

212
00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:03,533
I'LL MAKE SCRAP
OUT OF YOU!

213
00:10:03,533 --> 00:10:06,922
TAKE THAT AND
THAT AND THAT!

214
00:10:06,922 --> 00:10:09,529
STOP. STOP BEATING HIM.

215
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:12,127

AT YOUR FACE

I SAID STOP!

BITCH, WHO DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE TALKING TO?

YOU'VE GONE TOO FAR.

00:10:23,038 --> 00:10:25,529
I'LL TAKE YOU ON NOW.

00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:27,910
THAT'S SURPRISING
COMING FROM YOU.

222
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,246
YOU'RE NORMALLY
SUCH A WHINY BABY.

00:10:30,246 --> 00:10:33,015
SO YOU
WANNA FIGHT ME,

PLEASE, GET AWAY,

SHE'LL ELECTROCUTE HERSELF.

THAT'S INFORMATION
WE CAN USE.

SHE SAYS SINCE
HER FIRST TRIMESTER.

00:14:38,155 --> 00:14:41,058
BECAUSE MISS IBUKI
ASKED US TO.

318
00:14:41,058 --> 00:14:42,699
IBUKI DID?

319
00:14:42,699 --> 00:14:45,229
HEY, IS SHE
A COPPELION?

320
00:14:46,699 --> 00:14:49,693
[laughs]
WELL DONE,
COMRADE.

321
00:14:49,693 --> 00:14:51,068
GET ME
THE HANDCUFFS.

322
00:14:51,068 --> 00:14:54,694
DON'T PRESS YOUR LUCK,
YOU STUPID HUMANS!

323
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:56,693
STAND DOWN,
HARUTO!

324
00:14:56,693 --> 00:14:58,700
[gasps]

325
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,444
DID YOU JUST SAY,
"HARUTO"?

326
00:15:02,346 --> 00:15:05,182
CLASS PRESIDENT
IBARA NARUSE.

327
00:15:05,182 --> 00:15:07,701
SO IT LOOKS LIKE
WE MEET AGAIN.

328
00:15:07,701 --> 00:15:10,701
I CAN SENSE YOU HIDING
BACK THERE, YOU KNOW,

329
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,702
HARUTO KUROSAWA.

330
00:15:12,702 --> 00:15:16,699
I'D SUGGEST YOU DON'T
TRY ANYTHING DANGEROUS
THAT YOU MIGHT REGRET.

331
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:18,262
OUR BELOVED
CLASS PRESIDENT

332
00:15:18,262 --> 00:15:21,165
WOULD BE LIKELY
TO LOSE HER LIFE
IF YOU DID.

333
00:15:21,165 --> 00:15:23,067
DROP YOUR WEAPONS
AND COME ON OUT.

334
00:15:23,067 --> 00:15:25,135
YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO BE AFRAID OF.

335
00:15:26,701 --> 00:15:28,138
I MEAN, AFTER ALL,

336
00:15:28,138 --> 00:15:29,698
YOU DON'T HAVE
THE STINK OF HUMANS

337
00:15:29,698 --> 00:15:31,696
ALL OVER YOU
LIKE THIS ONE DOES.

338
00:15:31,696 --> 00:15:33,177
YOU STILL POSSESS
THE NOBILITY

339
00:15:33,177 --> 00:15:34,698
OF THE COPPELION
WITHIN YOU.

340
00:15:34,698 --> 00:15:36,346
I'LL TAKE HER DOWN,
HARUTO,

341
00:15:36,346 --> 00:15:37,696
SO DON'T LISTEN TO HER.

342
00:15:37,696 --> 00:15:38,696
[growls]

343
00:15:38,696 --> 00:15:41,385
[screaming]

344
00:15:41,385 --> 00:15:44,354
[electricity crackling]

345
00:15:45,422 --> 00:15:46,699
Haruto:
STOP IT, KANON!

346
00:15:46,699 --> 00:15:47,701
HEH.

347
00:15:49,259 --> 00:15:51,228
WHAT EXACTLY
DO YOU WANT?

348
00:15:53,363 --> 00:15:55,999
Officer: HE WAS CARRYING
ALL THESE WEAPONS?

349
00:15:57,693 --> 00:16:00,003
[gasps]
HARUTO, RUN AWAY.

350
00:16:00,003 --> 00:16:01,693
THIS IS THE DEAL.

351
00:16:01,693 --> 00:16:04,693
YOU HAVE ONE
OF TWO SIMPLE CHOICES
TO MAKE HERE.

352
00:16:04,693 --> 00:16:06,443
YOU CAN COME
JOIN ME AND SHION

353
00:16:06,443 --> 00:16:09,693
AS WE STICK IT
TO THE HUMANS LIKE YOU
KNOW THEY DESERVE,

354
00:16:09,693 --> 00:16:14,284
OR YOU CAN EXPERIENCE
THE POWER OF MY THUNDERBOLT
IN HER PLACE IF YOU'D LIKE.

355
00:16:14,284 --> 00:16:16,019
COME TO YOUR SENSES,
KANON.

356
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:18,288
IF YOU'RE SEEKING
REVENGE ON THE HUMANS,

357
00:16:18,288 --> 00:16:20,457
YOU SHOULD STOP
WASTING YOUR TIME.

358
00:16:20,457 --> 00:16:22,700
LOOK AT THEIR HISTORY
TO UNDERSTAND WHY.

359
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:26,230
THEY CONTINUALLY
CREATE PATHS TO THEIR
OWN SELF-DESTRUCTION,

360
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:29,233
AND THEY'RE DOOMED TO
REPEAT THESE TRAGEDIES
INDEFINITELY.

361
00:16:29,233 --> 00:16:31,034
LIKE I CARE.

362
00:16:31,034 --> 00:16:32,436
TAKE THAT!
[thunder crashes]

363
00:16:32,436 --> 00:16:34,438
[screaming]

364
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,377
THERE WAS A TIME
WHEN YOU DESPISED HUMANS,
HARUTO KUROSAWA.

365
00:16:40,377 --> 00:16:41,698
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

366
00:16:41,698 --> 00:16:43,147
IT'S TRUE.

367
00:16:43,147 --> 00:16:45,215
I DID DESPISE THEM,

368
00:16:45,215 --> 00:16:49,701
BUT MY DNA
REFUSES TO LISTEN
TO MY LOGIC.

369
00:16:49,701 --> 00:16:51,701
[gasps]
HARUTO.

370
00:16:51,701 --> 00:16:54,124
HMPH.

371
00:16:54,124 --> 00:16:57,127
I COULDN'T BE MORE
DISAPPOINTED IN YOU!

372
00:16:57,127 --> 00:16:58,701
[grunts]

373
00:17:00,693 --> 00:17:03,033
[gasps]
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

374
00:17:03,033 --> 00:17:04,700
NOW'S YOUR CHANCE.
RUN!

375
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,696
TRAITOR!
GET GOING!

376
00:17:06,696 --> 00:17:08,338
Ibara: THANKS.

377
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,700
STOP, DAMN IT!

378
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:15,379
[groans]
YOU BETTER STOP!

379
00:17:15,379 --> 00:17:16,699
I DON'T THINK SO.

380
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:19,449
[laughs] LOOKS LIKE
I CAUGHT UP, AOI FUKASAKU.

381
00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:21,185
[squeals]

382
00:17:21,185 --> 00:17:22,694
[screams]

383
00:17:25,697 --> 00:17:26,701
HUH?

384
00:17:26,701 --> 00:17:28,699
MISS AOI.
[gasps]

385
00:17:31,161 --> 00:17:33,694
I AM SORRY
TO KEEP YOU WAITING.

386
00:17:33,694 --> 00:17:35,701
OH, NO-SENSE,

387
00:17:35,701 --> 00:17:37,699
THANK GOD YOU'RE OK!

388
00:17:40,699 --> 00:17:43,700
Ibara: I WONDER IF AOI
GOT AWAY SAFELY.

389
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,242
[sighs]

390
00:17:45,242 --> 00:17:47,311
THIS DIVERSION STUFF
ISN'T EASY.

391
00:17:47,311 --> 00:17:49,695
HARUTO, ARE YOU OK?

392
00:17:49,695 --> 00:17:52,693
THEY TOOK ALL
OF MY WEAPONS FROM ME.

393
00:17:52,693 --> 00:17:55,152
AND ALL I HAVE
IS THIS GUN.

394
00:17:55,152 --> 00:17:57,287
IBUKI AND I MET
HERE IN THIS PARK.

395
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,193
A CRAMPED SHELTER
WAS THE ONLY PLACE
WE COULD MEET.

396
00:18:03,193 --> 00:18:06,700
WE BOTH KNEW THAT
OUR RELATIONSHIP
WAS FORBIDDEN.

397
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,365
FORBIDDEN?

398
00:18:08,365 --> 00:18:10,700
WHY WOULD A RELATIONSHIP
BE FORBIDDEN?

399
00:18:12,202 --> 00:18:14,698
BECAUSE I'M A MEMBER
OF THE FIRST DIVISION.

400
00:18:14,698 --> 00:18:16,306
I'VE FORGOTTEN
WHAT IT MEANS

401
00:18:16,306 --> 00:18:18,694
TO BE HUMAN
A LONG TIME AGO.

402
00:18:18,694 --> 00:18:20,701
I'M A GHOST,

403
00:18:20,701 --> 00:18:23,693
A GHOST THAT HAUNTS
THIS CITY.

404
00:18:23,693 --> 00:18:26,283
THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE
WHERE I FIT IN,

405
00:18:26,283 --> 00:18:29,086
BUT IBUKI IS DIFFERENT.

406
00:18:29,086 --> 00:18:31,701
SHE SHOULDN'T BE
IN A PLACE LIKE THIS.

407
00:18:31,701 --> 00:18:33,056
BUT YOU'RE
DIFFERENT NOW

408
00:18:33,056 --> 00:18:34,699
BECAUSE OF WHAT
SHE MEANS TO YOU,

409
00:18:34,699 --> 00:18:37,060
AND THAT'S WHY YOU
WANT TO PROTECT HER.

410
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,695
YOU ARE NOT A GHOST.

411
00:18:38,695 --> 00:18:40,330
YOU'RE
A LIVING PERSON

412
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:42,695
JUST LIKE
MISS IBUKI.

413
00:18:42,695 --> 00:18:44,699
Gennai: OK.
[laughs]

414
00:18:44,699 --> 00:18:47,304
THE ELECTRICAL CABLES
ARE FIXED.

415
00:18:47,304 --> 00:18:51,700
HEY,
I FINISHED REPAIRING
THE ELECTRICAL CABLES.

416
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,377
HUH?

417
00:18:53,377 --> 00:18:55,078
Gojiro:
THE WAY IT'S LOOKING,

418
00:18:55,078 --> 00:18:57,447
WE'LL BE SWALLOWED UP
BY THE STORM.

419
00:18:57,447 --> 00:18:59,694
ARE YOU SURE
WE'LL MAKE IT IN TIME?

420
00:18:59,694 --> 00:19:00,700
I THINK SO,

421
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,120
THOUGH IT
IS A RACE
AGAINST NATURE.

422
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,354
GOOD GOD.

423
00:19:04,354 --> 00:19:06,699
WE COULD BE
CONTAMINATED
ANY TIME NOW.

424
00:19:06,699 --> 00:19:09,693
REMEMBER,
THIS IS FOR IBUKI.

425
00:19:09,693 --> 00:19:11,700
SHE'S NEVER SEEN
THE OUTSIDE WORLD BEFORE.

426
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,297
[gasping]

427
00:19:13,297 --> 00:19:16,166
AND NOW SHE'S
ABOUT TO GIVE BIRTH
TO A CHILD

428
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,368
IN THIS
GODFORSAKEN PLACE.

429
00:19:18,368 --> 00:19:20,695
I WANT THAT CHILD
TO LIVE ITS LIFE

430
00:19:20,695 --> 00:19:23,240
WITHOUT EVER NEEDING
A HAZMAT SUIT.

431
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,695
ACHIEVING THAT
WILL BE MY FINAL ACT

432
00:19:25,695 --> 00:19:28,111
OF REPENTANCE
FOR MY MANY SINS.

433
00:19:28,111 --> 00:19:31,014
GOJIRO, WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

434
00:19:31,014 --> 00:19:33,016
LET'S CHECK HOW
THE CURRENT'S FLOWING.

435
00:19:33,016 --> 00:19:34,699
OH, RIGHT,
ABSOLUTELY.

436
00:19:34,699 --> 00:19:36,699
WE CAN USE
THIS MEASURING DEVICE.

437
00:19:36,699 --> 00:19:38,702
IT'LL SIGNAL
WHETHER OR NOT

438
00:19:38,702 --> 00:19:41,291
AN ELECTRICAL CURRENT
IS FLOWING.

439
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:44,127
HUH?
WELL, THAT'S ODD.

440
00:19:44,127 --> 00:19:45,700
THIS ISN'T RIGHT
AT ALL.

441
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,699
I SWEAR I FIXED
THE CABLES
CORRECTLY.

442
00:19:48,699 --> 00:19:51,699
THEN SOMETHING
AT THE SUBSTATION
HAS GONE WRONG.

443
00:19:51,699 --> 00:19:54,697
WELL, GET OVER THERE
AND FIX IT AS QUICK
AS YOU CAN, GENNAI.

444
00:19:54,697 --> 00:19:58,008
DO YOU HAVE
ANY IDEA HOW BIG
THE SUBSTATION IS?

445
00:19:58,008 --> 00:20:01,311
IT'LL BE DIFFICULT
JUST FIGURING OUT
WHERE THE PROBLEM LIES.

446
00:20:01,311 --> 00:20:04,314
NO, LET ME WORRY
ABOUT THE SUBSTATION.

447
00:20:04,314 --> 00:20:05,415
WHAT?

448
00:20:05,415 --> 00:20:07,117
THAT'S A KIND OFFER,
GOJIRO,

449
00:20:07,117 --> 00:20:08,697
BUT ELECTRICAL REPAIRS
AREN'T SOMETHING

450
00:20:08,697 --> 00:20:11,054
TO BE LEFT FOR AMATEURS
TO HANDLE.

451
00:20:11,054 --> 00:20:13,223
I CAN DO IT.
AFTER ALL,

452
00:20:13,223 --> 00:20:16,696
I USED TO WORK FOR
THE POWER COMPANY.

453
00:20:16,696 --> 00:20:18,693
HUH? HEY, WAIT.

454
00:20:18,693 --> 00:20:19,694
GOJIRO!

455
00:20:19,694 --> 00:20:21,298
THE POWER COMPANY?

456
00:20:22,697 --> 00:20:24,201
Kurobe: WAIT A MINUTE...

457
00:20:25,697 --> 00:20:28,700
HEY,
WHERE'D YOU GO, AOI?

458
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,241
DAMN IT, HARUTO.

459
00:20:31,241 --> 00:20:33,143
WE COMPLETELY
LOST HER.

460
00:20:35,412 --> 00:20:37,698
THE WIND IS
PICKING UP.

461
00:20:37,698 --> 00:20:39,116
Haruto:
THIS ISN'T GOOD.

462
00:20:39,116 --> 00:20:40,701
IF THE WIND
GETS ANY STRONGER,

463
00:20:40,701 --> 00:20:42,386
I DON'T THINK
THE CABLES'LL HOLD.

464
00:20:42,386 --> 00:20:43,696
Soldier:
FOUND THEM!

465
00:20:43,696 --> 00:20:46,699
Ibara: KANON. RUN!

466
00:20:46,699 --> 00:20:48,258
Soldier: THEY'RE
MAKING A RUN FOR IT!

467
00:20:49,259 --> 00:20:50,696
DON'T LET THEM
ESCAPE!

468
00:20:52,694 --> 00:20:55,165
YOU, ACTIVATE
THAT THING.

469
00:20:55,165 --> 00:20:57,100
YES, SIR.
WHAT THING?

470
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,696
[panting]

471
00:20:59,696 --> 00:21:00,702
I MADE IT.

472
00:21:00,702 --> 00:21:03,407
THIS MUST BE
THE SUBSTATION.

473
00:21:03,407 --> 00:21:05,696
PLEASE HANG IN THERE,
