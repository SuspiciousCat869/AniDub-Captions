00:07:56,401 --> 00:07:57,841
HEY, ARE YOU
LISTENING?

162
00:07:57,841 --> 00:07:59,370
[gasping]
WHAT'S WRONG?

163
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:00,837
YOU LOOK PALE.

164
00:08:01,841 --> 00:08:03,474
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY.

165
00:08:03,474 --> 00:08:05,476
MAYBE THE AETHER
IS WEARING OFF.

166
00:08:05,476 --> 00:08:08,841
THE GIRL DID
SAY IT'S ONLY SUPPOSED
TO LAST 10 MINUTES.

167
00:08:08,841 --> 00:08:12,846
OH, GOD. THEN YOU
NEED TO GO AND GET
INSIDE THE SHELTER RIGHT NOW,

168
00:08:12,846 --> 00:08:14,840
BEFORE THE AETHER
WEARS OFF.

169
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,837
I'LL DO THE DRIVING.
OK.

170
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:20,324
THANKS, GOJIRO.

171
00:08:20,324 --> 00:08:22,360
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

172
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,839
IT'S TOO MUCH!

173
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:25,163
IT HURTS!

174
00:08:25,163 --> 00:08:26,838
HANG IN THERE.

175
00:08:26,838 --> 00:08:27,846
KEEP BREATHING
STEADILY.

176
00:08:27,846 --> 00:08:29,367
I CAN'T!

177
00:08:29,367 --> 00:08:30,368
[screams]

178
00:08:30,368 --> 00:08:32,303
[radio whines]
GRANNY AYAME.

179
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,338
IT'S POSSIBLE
THE BABY'S CAUGHT

180
00:08:34,338 --> 00:08:36,837
ON SOMETHING
INSIDE THE WOMB.

181
00:08:36,837 --> 00:08:39,343
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
CAUGHT ON WHAT?

182
00:08:39,343 --> 00:08:40,840
WAIT A MINUTE.

183
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,247
YOU MENTIONED EARLIER
THAT SHE'S BEEN ANEMIC

184
00:08:43,247 --> 00:08:45,550
SINCE HER
FIRST TRIMESTER.
IS THAT CORRECT?

185
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,518
YES.
[groans]

186
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,838
HURRY UP, YOU GUYS!
WE GOTTA GET GOING!

187
00:08:51,838 --> 00:08:54,158
THE TRAIN IS ALMOST
AT THE PLATFORM!

188
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,593
HEY!

189
00:08:55,593 --> 00:08:58,162
THE MAINTENANCE TEAM
IS ARRIVING NOW!

190
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,840
WHERE'D
EVERYBODY GO?!

191
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,837
WE HAVE TO GET
OUT OF HERE!

192
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:05,369
DAMN MONSTER.

193
00:09:05,369 --> 00:09:06,471
Ibara: DON'T SHOOT.

194
00:09:06,471 --> 00:09:07,844
GET TO THE PLATFORM.

195
00:09:07,844 --> 00:09:09,843
[gasping]

196
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:14,844
HURRY. THE TRAIN'S
GONNA LEAVE.

197
00:09:14,844 --> 00:09:18,249
JUST GET GOING,
AND DON'T WORRY
ABOUT ME. [gasps]

198
00:09:18,249 --> 00:09:20,451
YOU GUYS ARE
GETTING ON A TRAIN?

199
00:09:20,451 --> 00:09:22,320
WELL,
I'LL MAKE SURE THEN

200
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,843
THAT TRAIN
TAKES YOU TO HELL!

201
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:29,846
OW. OW. OW.

202
00:09:29,846 --> 00:09:31,562
[laughs]

203
00:09:31,562 --> 00:09:34,398
DAMN YOU,
CLASS PRESIDENT.

204
00:09:34,398 --> 00:09:36,167
I'LL TRASH
THAT TRAIN.

205
00:09:36,167 --> 00:09:38,840
THE ONLY THING
THAT'S GETTING TRASHED
IS THAT CEILING.

206
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,837
WHAT? A BOMB?

207
00:09:43,241 --> 00:09:45,409
GOD DAMN YOU,

Aoi: IBARA!
HURRY!

210
00:09:52,838 --> 00:09:54,519
EVERYONE ELSE
IS ON BOARD NOW.

211
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:56,354
COME ON!
WE'VE GOTTA
GET GOING!

212
00:09:56,354 --> 00:09:58,456
I CAN'T SLOW DOWN
THE TRAIN ANY MORE.

213
00:09:58,456 --> 00:10:01,846
I HAVE TO PICK UP THE PACE
IN ORDER TO BREAK
THROUGH THE ZONE.

214
00:10:01,846 --> 00:10:03,461
LET'S GO!

215
00:10:03,461 --> 00:10:06,464
[panting]

00:10:06,464 --> 00:10:08,533
[crash]
HUH?

217
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:12,570
Ibara: SHION.

00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,206
[giggles]

219
00:10:15,206 --> 00:10:17,508
YOU KNOW WHAT
I THINK WOULD BE FUN?

220
00:10:17,508 --> 00:10:18,843
SMASHING EVERYTHING.

221
00:10:18,843 --> 00:10:20,545
STOP THIS RECKLESSNESS.

222
00:10:20,545 --> 00:10:22,213
PUT THAT THING DOWN.

223
00:10:22,213 --> 00:10:25,216
EH, I'M LOSING
MY STRENGTH.

224
00:10:25,216 --> 00:10:26,837
HANG ON!

225
00:10:26,837 --> 00:10:28,185
[gasps]

226
00:10:30,837 --> 00:10:32,423
SH-SHION.

227
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:35,839
Aoi: YOU GOTTA GET
ON THIS TRAIN RIGHT NOW!

228
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,595
PLEASE, HURRY!

00:10:43,568 --> 00:10:45,436
[chuckles]

230
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:46,845
WAY TO GO, FOREMAN.
YES!

231
00:10:46,845 --> 00:10:48,840
NOW THAT'S WHAT
I CALL TEAMWORK!

232
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,242
Aoi: IBARA, ARE YOU OK?

233
00:10:51,242 --> 00:10:52,846
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT'S WRONG?

234
00:10:54,845 --> 00:10:56,213
THE FIRST DIVISION?

235
00:10:56,213 --> 00:10:58,844
LET'S ALL GET
OUT OF THIS ALIVE.

236
00:10:58,844 --> 00:11:01,285
COME GET
ON THE TRAIN, GUYS!

237
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,523
Kurobe: JESUS.

238
00:11:05,523 --> 00:11:08,259
SHE BROUGHT
THE WHOLE GANG
ALONG WITH US.

239
00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:10,839
Solider:
YOU'RE AN ANGEL.

240
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,265
Aoi: MR. GENNAI!

241
00:11:14,265 --> 00:11:16,300
THIS IS SOME KIND
OF JOKE, RIGHT?

242
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,235
WHY'D THIS
HAVE TO HAPPEN?

243
00:11:18,235 --> 00:11:20,538
DON'T DIE,
MR. GENNAI.

244
00:11:20,538 --> 00:11:22,573
OH, YOU SWEET
LITTLE GIRL.

245
00:11:22,573 --> 00:11:24,475
THIS ISN'T
YOUR FAULT.

246
00:11:26,344 --> 00:11:28,546
I WISH HE HAD TAKEN
MY AETHER SHOT.

247
00:11:28,546 --> 00:11:31,382
HOW BAD OFF IS HE NOW?
CAN WE SAVE HIM?

248
00:11:32,843 --> 00:11:36,354
HOW MUCH TIME
DOES THE POOR GUY
HAVE LEFT TO LIVE?

249
00:11:36,354 --> 00:11:38,155
I REALLY DON'T KNOW.

250
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:40,844
Gojiro, over P.A.:
OK, EVERYONE, LISTEN UP.

251
00:11:40,844 --> 00:11:43,461
THE TRAIN WILL BE
AT THE ZONE SOON,

252
00:11:43,461 --> 00:11:46,530
SO HANG TIGHT, BECAUSE YOU
ALL KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS.

253
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,466
THIS IS WHEN THINGS
GET SERIOUS.

254
00:11:48,466 --> 00:11:52,203
THE HEAVY FOG FROM THE ZONE
IS FIVE KILOMETERS
AHEAD OF US.

255
00:11:52,203 --> 00:11:54,837
ALL OUR HARD WORK
COMES DOWN TO THIS MOMENT.

256
00:11:54,837 --> 00:11:57,241
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT
THROUGH THAT FOG!

257
00:11:57,241 --> 00:11:59,310
EVERYONE GO GET
INSIDE THE SHELTER.

258
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:01,837
I'LL TAKE OVER
THE DRIVING
FROM HERE ON OUT.

259
00:12:01,837 --> 00:12:02,844
OK. YOU GOT IT.

260
00:12:02,844 --> 00:12:04,844
WHERE'S HARUTO?
I NEED HIM UP HERE.

261
00:12:04,844 --> 00:12:06,550
THIS IS NO TIME
FOR HIM TO BE

262
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:09,220
SITTING AROUND
OR SLACKING OFF
AND WASTING OUR--

263
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,454
HMM?

264
00:12:10,454 --> 00:12:13,838
I'M SORRY, KID,
BUT HE'S, UH...

265
00:12:13,838 --> 00:12:15,839
NO! YOU'RE LYING!

266
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,841
LET ME GO! HARUTO!

267
00:12:17,841 --> 00:12:20,845
HE CAN'T BE DEAD!
HE JUST CAN'T!

268
00:12:20,845 --> 00:12:23,234
HARUTO!

269
00:12:28,328 --> 00:12:30,888
Ayame: ALL RIGHT,
LISTEN CAREFULLY.

270
00:12:30,888 --> 00:12:32,324
THE WAY
IT LOOKS NOW,

271
00:12:32,324 --> 00:12:33,757
THE BABY IS
BEING OBSTRUCTED.

272
00:12:33,757 --> 00:12:35,322
IF WE MAKE A MISTAKE,

273
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:36,960
BOTH MOTHER AND CHILD
COULD DIE.

274
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,029
Taeko: BUT WHY IS
THIS HAPPENING?

275
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:41,064
YOU'RE GONNA FIND OUT
SOON ENOUGH.

276
00:12:41,064 --> 00:12:44,968
RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE
TO MAKE AN IMPORTANT
LIFE-OR-DEATH DECISION,

277
00:12:44,968 --> 00:12:47,971
DO WE SAVE THE MOTHER
OR THE CHILD?

278
00:12:50,674 --> 00:12:53,322
HARUTO,
YOU LIED TO ME.

279
00:12:53,322 --> 00:12:56,847
YOU PROMISED
WE'D SEE EACH OTHER
AGAIN SOON.

280
00:12:56,847 --> 00:12:59,082
[sobbing]

281
00:12:59,082 --> 00:13:02,686
IBARA, PLEASE
PULL YOURSELF
TOGETHER.

282
00:13:02,686 --> 00:13:04,325
THIS IS NO TIME
FOR TEARS.

283
00:13:05,656 --> 00:13:08,323
THE ZONE
HAS ALMOST
CAUGHT UP TO US.

284
00:13:11,728 --> 00:13:14,320
Gojiro: HEY, ARE YOU
PAYING ATTENTION, COPPELION!

285
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,667
WE'RE ALMOST
AT THE FIVE-KILOMETER POINT!

286
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:19,324
COME TAKE OVER!

287
00:13:19,324 --> 00:13:22,072
YOU'VE GOTTA
SNAP OUT OF IT
RIGHT NOW, IBARA!

288
00:13:22,072 --> 00:13:25,327
IT WAS YOUR STRENGTH
AND DEDICATION
TO THE MISSION

289
00:13:25,327 --> 00:13:27,077
THAT BROUGHT US
THIS FAR.

290
00:13:27,077 --> 00:13:29,012
IF IT HADN'T BEEN
FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP,

291
00:13:29,012 --> 00:13:31,882
WE WOULD HAVE
ALL GIVEN UP
A LONG TIME AGO.

292
00:13:31,882 --> 00:13:33,917
THIS IS A SAD WORLD,

293
00:13:33,917 --> 00:13:35,052
AND PEOPLE
LOSE SIGHT

294
00:13:35,052 --> 00:13:36,954
OF WHY THEY
SHOULD GO ON LIVING.

295
00:13:36,954 --> 00:13:39,325
EVERYONE'S FELT
THAT WAY AT ONE TIME
OR ANOTHER,

296
00:13:39,325 --> 00:13:41,320
THAT THERE'S
NO FUTURE,

297
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,328
THAT IT'D BE EASIER
IF WE JUST--

298
00:13:43,328 --> 00:13:45,323
I'VE FELT
THE SAME WAY, TOO,

299
00:13:45,323 --> 00:13:47,664
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
CHANGED ALL THAT?

300
00:13:47,664 --> 00:13:48,832
YOUR SMILE.

301
00:13:48,832 --> 00:13:50,834
WHEN WE ALL SEE
YOUR BEAUTIFUL SMILE,

302
00:13:50,834 --> 00:13:54,321
IT GIVES US THE COURAGE
TO MOVE FORWARD
AND KEEP LIVING.

303
00:13:54,321 --> 00:13:56,325
I'M TELLING YOU
THE TRUTH HERE, IBARA.

304
00:13:56,325 --> 00:13:58,875
YOUR SMILE HAS GOT
THAT KIND OF POWER.

305
00:14:00,328 --> 00:14:02,327
Haruto: NARUSE.

306
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,849
DON'T LOOK SO SAD.

307
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:09,323
HARUTO?

308
00:14:10,325 --> 00:14:12,689
[crying]

309
00:14:12,689 --> 00:14:14,625
I'M SORRY, AOI.

[gasps]

311
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,795
LET'S DO THIS.

312
00:14:18,795 --> 00:14:21,320
LET'S BUST
THROUGH THAT ZONE.

313
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,667
Gojiro:
HURRY UP, COPPELION!

314
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:25,902
I'LL TAKE OVER FROM HERE.
HUH?

315
00:14:25,902 --> 00:14:28,672
YOU NEED TO GET
BACK TO THE SHELTER.

316
00:14:28,672 --> 00:14:30,707
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT,
GRANNY AYAME?

317
00:14:30,707 --> 00:14:33,877
WHY DO YOU WANT ME
TO CHOOSE BETWEEN
MOTHER AND CHILD?

318
00:14:33,877 --> 00:14:37,014
THE UMBILICAL CORD
HAS WRAPPED AROUND
THE BABY'S NECK.

319
00:14:37,014 --> 00:14:39,983
THERE IS DEFINITELY
A POSSIBILITY
OF SUFFOCATION.

320
00:14:39,983 --> 00:14:41,785
SOMETIMES
THESE THINGS
WILL HAPPEN,

321
00:14:41,785 --> 00:14:43,854
BUT YOU CAN
TAKE CARE OF IT.

322
00:14:43,854 --> 00:14:45,328
THE THING IS,
IN THIS CASE,

323
00:14:45,328 --> 00:14:47,991
YOU'LL PROBABLY
HAVE TO PERFORM
A CAESARIAN SECTION.

324
00:14:47,991 --> 00:14:51,328
IT'S THE BEST WAY
FOR US TO ENSURE
THE BABY'S SAFETY.

325
00:14:51,328 --> 00:14:53,325
CAESARIAN SECTION?

326
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:54,831
BUT HERE'S
THE PROBLEM.

327
00:14:54,831 --> 00:14:56,328
SINCE YOU HAVE
NO EXPERIENCE

328
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:58,328
PERFORMING A SURGERY
SUCH AS THIS,

329
00:14:58,328 --> 00:15:00,003
THERE'S NO WAY
TO KNOW FOR SURE

330
00:15:00,003 --> 00:15:01,322
THAT THE MOTHER
WILL SURVIVE,

331
00:15:01,322 --> 00:15:02,906
WHICH IS WHY
I WAS JUST SAYING

332
00:15:02,906 --> 00:15:04,328
THAT--THAT, WELL...

333
00:15:04,328 --> 00:15:06,643
THAT YOU
WANT ME TO CHOOSE

334
00:15:06,643 --> 00:15:09,325
WHICH ONE
I WANT TO SAVE.

335
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,328
[beeping]
HEY.

336
00:15:10,328 --> 00:15:11,915
LOOK AT
THE COUNTER
READINGS.

337
00:15:11,915 --> 00:15:13,325
THE NUMBERS
ARE RISING UP

338
00:15:13,325 --> 00:15:14,985
AND GOING FASTER
AND FASTER.

339
00:15:14,985 --> 00:15:17,754
889. 895.

340
00:15:17,754 --> 00:15:19,756
EXCEEDING
MAXIMUM LIMIT!

341
00:15:19,756 --> 00:15:21,758
A WHITE CLOUD
IS DIRECTLY AHEAD.

342
00:15:21,758 --> 00:15:25,762
IS THAT IT?
IS THAT THE ZONE BARRIER
WE HAVE TO GET PAST?

343
00:15:25,762 --> 00:15:28,324
IT'S SO CRAMPED IN HERE!
[moos]

344
00:15:28,324 --> 00:15:29,933
[over P.A.]
THIS IS IBARA.

345
00:15:29,933 --> 00:15:32,969
WE'RE ABOUT TO PASS
DIRECTLY THROUGH
THE ZONE FOG.

346
00:15:32,969 --> 00:15:35,772
THOSE OF YOU
IN THE SHELTER
NEED TO STAY PUT.

347
00:15:35,772 --> 00:15:38,775
DO NOT OPEN THE DOORS
UNTIL I GIVE
THE ALL CLEAR.

348
00:15:38,775 --> 00:15:41,327
WHATEVER'S GONNA HAPPEN,
IT'LL BE OVER QUICKLY.

349
00:15:41,327 --> 00:15:44,047
REMEMBER,
WE RISKED OUR LIVES

350
00:15:44,047 --> 00:15:46,049
FIGHTING FOR THIS ONE,
SINGLE MOMENT.

351
00:15:46,049 --> 00:15:48,327
WE'RE GOING
TO MAKE IT OUT ALIVE!

352
00:15:48,327 --> 00:15:50,087
THE STRENGTH
OF OUR CONVICTIONS

353
00:15:50,087 --> 00:15:51,788
HAS BROUGHT US
THIS FAR.

354
00:15:53,056 --> 00:15:54,323
WE'LL GO ON

355
00:15:54,323 --> 00:15:56,760
WITHOUT ANY DOUBT
OR HESITATION.

356
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,030
HOLD STRONG, AND BELIEVE
IN THE POWER OF LIFE.

357
00:16:01,329 --> 00:16:03,322
Ibuki:
TAEKO, LISTEN TO ME.

358
00:16:03,322 --> 00:16:06,903
I WAS PREPARED
FOR THE WORST
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING, OK?

359
00:16:07,904 --> 00:16:09,323
I'LL RISK DEATH.

360
00:16:09,323 --> 00:16:10,640
IT'S OK.

361
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,327
YOU JUST HAVE
TO SAVE THIS CHILD.

362
00:16:12,327 --> 00:16:15,011
IT WON'T BE LIKE THAT,
MISS IBUKI.

363
00:16:15,011 --> 00:16:17,329
DON'T WORRY.
I STUDIED HARD
IN SURGERY

364
00:16:17,329 --> 00:16:20,083
SO THAT I WOULD BE READY
FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

365
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,018
I'M GOING
TO PROVE IT TO YOU.

366
00:16:22,018 --> 00:16:24,087
I'LL SAVE BOTH YOU
AND YOUR BABY.

367
00:16:26,321 --> 00:16:28,321
ARE YOU READY
TO DO THIS, AOI?

368
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,760
YEAH!
LET'S BREAK THROUGH IT!

369
00:16:34,931 --> 00:16:36,833
[gasps]

370
00:16:42,327 --> 00:16:44,708
IT'S SO WHITE,

371
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,810
A WHITE WORLD.

372
00:16:48,812 --> 00:16:50,323
Ibara: MAKE IT THROUGH.

373
00:16:50,323 --> 00:16:51,815
MAKE IT THROUGH.

374
00:16:51,815 --> 00:16:53,323
MAKE IT THROUGH.

375
00:16:53,323 --> 00:16:54,818
MAKE IT THROUGH.

376
00:16:54,818 --> 00:16:57,921
MAKE IT THROUGH!
MAKE IT THROUGH!

377
00:16:57,921 --> 00:17:01,326
[train horn honks]

378
00:17:05,695 --> 00:17:07,321
LOOK AT THAT,

379
00:17:07,321 --> 00:17:08,932
A FLOCK OF BIRDS.

380
00:17:08,932 --> 00:17:11,320
WAY TO GO, IBARA!
YOU DID IT!

381
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,903
WE MADE IT
THROUGH THE FOG!

382
00:17:12,903 --> 00:17:14,638
SHELTER,
THIS IS IBARA.

383
00:17:14,638 --> 00:17:15,906
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

384
00:17:15,906 --> 00:17:18,975
SHELTER,
PLEASE RESPOND.

385
00:17:18,975 --> 00:17:21,044

LOUD AND CLEAR.

386
00:17:21,044 --> 00:17:22,329
[cheering]
CAN YOU HEAR US?

387
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:23,780
WE'VE ALREADY
STARTED

388
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,816
THE CELEBRATION
BACK HERE.

389
00:17:25,816 --> 00:17:27,818
[overlapping chatter,
laughter]

390
00:17:30,323 --> 00:17:33,857
OK, THE READINGS
HAVE FALLEN WITHIN
SAFE LEVELS.

391
00:17:33,857 --> 00:17:35,326
SO HERE'S
SOME GOOD NEWS.

392
00:17:35,326 --> 00:17:38,320
IT'S SAFE FOR
EVERYONE TO COME
BACK OUT NOW.

393
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,322
YOU DID IT,

WE SHOWED THEM.
[laughs]

397
00:17:45,702 --> 00:17:48,320
OUCH! YOU'RE
CRUSHING MY BONES!

398
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,841
OOPS. I'M SORRY.
I FORGOT ABOUT
YOUR ARM.

399

Soldiers: ONE!
[Aoi squealing, laughing]

00:17:52,328 --> 00:17:53,944
IS EVERYONE
DOING OK?

403
00:17:57,681 --> 00:18:00,323
WE MADE IT
RIGHT PAST THAT
THICK ZONE FOG.

404
00:18:00,323 --> 00:18:02,323
THE PLAN WAS
A HUGE SUCCESS.

00:18:02,323 --> 00:18:03,323

406
00:18:03,323 --> 00:18:04,654
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

407
00:18:04,654 --> 00:18:06,690
YOU DON'T SEEM
VERY HAPPY
ABOUT THIS.

408
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:10,927
WE ALL OWE HIM
OUR THANKS AS WELL,
THAT'S FOR SURE.

409
00:18:10,927 --> 00:18:14,321
I FOUND THIS BOMB
THAT HARUTO HAD LEFT BEHIND.

410
00:18:14,321 --> 00:18:17,322
I'M SURE HE WOULD HAVE
WANTED YOU TO HAVE IT.

411

SO IT WAS YOU!

ON MY DAUGHTER!

HOW MISS IBUKI'S
CHILDBIRTH
IS GOING?

JUST FORGET ABOUT IT.

ON THE RADIO RIGHT AWAY.

TO FIGURE OUT
WHETHER OR NOT

TO GO AHEAD WITH
THE CAESARIAN SECTION.

IF WE
DON'T ACT QUICKLY,

THE BABY
WILL CHOKE TO DEATH.

DID SHE SAY,
"CAESARIAN SECTION"?

437
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:22,325
ARE IBUKI AND THE BABY
ALL RIGHT?

I CAN'T STEP AWAY,
BECAUSE I'M
OPERATING.

THERE'S NO NEED
TO WORRY NOW.

BOTH MISS IBUKI
AND HER BABY.

JUST GET THIS TRAIN
TO A SAFE LOCATION.

I DON'T GET IT.

AM I STILL ALIVE.

THERE'S NO HOPE,
ANYWAY.

466
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,682
WE'RE JUST GONNA
DROP DEAD SOMEDAY

WITHOUT ANY WARNING.

468

WHY CAN'T WE JUST
END IT RIGHT HERE
AND NOW?

WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

YOU'RE LUCKY THAT YOU
STILL HAVE THE ABILITY
TO FEEL PAIN.

LOOK AT ME.

00:20:59,322 --> 00:21:01,865
YOU SEE, MY BODY
IS CONSTANTLY TINGLING

474
00:21:01,865 --> 00:21:03,800
FROM ALL
THIS ELECTRICITY.

475
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,320
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT PAIN FEELS LIKE ANYMORE.

476
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,326
THAT'S SO SAD.

477
00:21:09,326 --> 00:21:10,940
I'M A DOLL,

478
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:13,076
AND THAT'S ALL
I'LL EVER BE.

479
00:21:13,076 --> 00:21:15,327
I WAS NEVER HUMAN
TO BEGIN WITH.

480
00:21:15,327 --> 00:21:18,682
I'M NOTHING
BUT AN ANIMATED DOLL.

481
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,020
IS THAT IT,
MR. GENNAI?

482
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,789
YES, IT IS.

483
00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:27,724
IN A LITTLE WHILE NOW,

484
00:21:27,724 --> 00:21:30,327
THE SKYSCRAPERS
WILL BE PAINTED RED

485
00:21:30,327 --> 00:21:32,326
WITH THE LIGHT
OF THE SETTING SUN.

486
00:21:32,326 --> 00:21:36,324
I HOPE I GET TO SEE IT
WITH ALL OF YOU.

487
00:21:36,324 --> 00:21:38,835
YOU WILL, I PROMISE.

NO WAY.
