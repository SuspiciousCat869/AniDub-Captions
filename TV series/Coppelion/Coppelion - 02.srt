00:07:44,734 --> 00:07:47,637
YOUR PARENTS MUST BE
WORRIED SICK ABOUT YOU.

165
00:07:47,637 --> 00:07:50,707
THAT'S NOT
A PROBLEM FOR US.

166
00:07:50,707 --> 00:07:53,020
THE THREE OF US
WERE CREATED ARTIFICIALLY

167
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,644
THROUGH GENETIC ENGINEERING.

168
00:07:54,644 --> 00:07:57,018
GENETIC
ENGINEERING?

169
00:07:57,018 --> 00:08:00,450
[chuckles]
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
OF "COPPELIA"?

170
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:04,022
IT'S A FRENCH COMIC BALLET
FROM THE 19th CENTURY.

171
00:08:04,022 --> 00:08:08,491
IT'S ABOUT A GIRL
WITH BEAUTIFUL EYES
NAMED COPPELIA

172
00:08:08,491 --> 00:08:13,630
WHO'S ALWAYS READING
BY THE SECOND-FLOOR WINDOW
OF DR. COPPELIUS' HOUSE.

173
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:16,466
THE THING IS SHE
ISN'T ACTUALLY A GIRL.

174
00:08:16,466 --> 00:08:18,635
SHE'S A DOLL
CREATED BY THE DOCTOR.

175
00:08:18,635 --> 00:08:21,022
THAT'S WHERE OUR NAME
COMES FROM.

176
00:08:21,022 --> 00:08:23,440
WE'RE LIVING DOLLS.

177
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,015
Ibara:
WHAT THE HELL?

178
00:08:25,015 --> 00:08:26,743
THIS PLACE IS HUGE.

179
00:08:26,743 --> 00:08:28,022
WE DON'T HAVE
MUCH TIME.

180
00:08:28,022 --> 00:08:29,022
START LOOKING.

181
00:08:29,022 --> 00:08:32,022
HEY! MIKU!

182
00:08:32,022 --> 00:08:35,518
COME ON OUT!

183
00:08:35,518 --> 00:08:36,753
WHERE ARE YOU?!

184
00:08:36,753 --> 00:08:40,016
ANSWER US! MIKU!

185
00:08:42,425 --> 00:08:44,461
MI--[gasps]

[wind blowing]

187
00:08:47,631 --> 00:08:50,021
THERE'S SOMETHING
OVER THERE.

188
00:08:50,021 --> 00:08:52,017
WHAT DO YOU THINK
IT COULD BE?

189
00:08:52,017 --> 00:08:53,403
LET'S FIND OUT.

190
00:08:58,508 --> 00:09:00,022
OH, MY GOD.

191
00:09:00,022 --> 00:09:02,015
IBARA, THAT'S...

192
00:09:03,017 --> 00:09:05,448
Ibara:
THAT'S THE GRAVEYARD.

193
00:09:05,448 --> 00:09:07,751
IBARA, MIKU.

194
00:09:07,751 --> 00:09:10,720
YEAH, SHE'S NOT AROUND.

195
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,356
WELL, YOU SEE,
I WAS ARRESTED

196
00:09:13,356 --> 00:09:16,017
BACK WHEN I WAS
ONLY 20 YEARS OLD...

197
00:09:16,017 --> 00:09:19,529
UM, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO TELL ME
ABOUT YOUR PAST.

198
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:21,731
FOR KILLING
MY CHILD.

199
00:09:21,731 --> 00:09:23,015
[gasps]

200
00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:26,015
I KILLED
MY OWN BABY.

201
00:09:27,021 --> 00:09:29,639
[crying]
AN INNOCENT NEWBORN.

202
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:33,710
I TREATED MY BABY
LIKE A LITTLE
TOY DOLL.

203
00:09:35,016 --> 00:09:36,546
I GAVE UP MY RIGHT

204
00:09:36,546 --> 00:09:38,515
TO BE ANY KIND
OF MOTHER.

205
00:09:38,515 --> 00:09:39,616
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

206
00:09:39,616 --> 00:09:42,318
[crying]
BUT FOR MIKU,

207
00:09:42,318 --> 00:09:44,017
I WANT
TO BE DIFFERENT.

208
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:45,588
I WANT
TO PROTECT HER.

209
00:09:45,588 --> 00:09:47,390
[crying]

210
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:49,592
I'M ACTUALLY
KIND OF JEALOUS.

211
00:09:50,627 --> 00:09:52,020
IF I WAS GROWING UP

212
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,730
WITH A MOTHER
OF MY OWN,

213
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,016
SHE MIGHT DO
THE SAME FOR ME.

214
00:09:57,534 --> 00:10:01,404
AOI, YOU'RE
NOT A DOLL.

215
00:10:01,404 --> 00:10:02,739
IT'S YOUR EYES.

216
00:10:02,739 --> 00:10:06,018
THEY'RE TOO KIND
TO BE A DOLL'S EYES.

217
00:10:06,018 --> 00:10:08,018
[crying]

218
00:10:10,747 --> 00:10:14,551
UM, I NEED TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM.

219
00:10:17,018 --> 00:10:18,321
[door closes]

220
00:10:18,321 --> 00:10:20,323
[toilet flushing]

221
00:10:23,678 --> 00:10:24,846
MS. YUKIKO.

222
00:10:24,846 --> 00:10:27,049
WHERE DID SHE GO?

223
00:10:27,049 --> 00:10:29,336
Aoi: IBARA!

224
00:10:29,336 --> 00:10:30,852
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
AOI?

225
00:10:30,852 --> 00:10:33,655
I LEFT FOR A MINUTE,
AND NOW MS. YUKIKO'S
GONE!

226
00:10:33,655 --> 00:10:35,337
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

227
00:10:35,337 --> 00:10:38,794
I THINK SHE MIGHT
HAVE GONE OUTSIDE
TO LOOK FOR MIKU.

228
00:10:40,028 --> 00:10:41,797
THAT'S STRANGE,

229
00:10:41,797 --> 00:10:44,341
BECAUSE SHE'S
THE ONE WHO SAID
THAT MIKU WOULD BE HERE.

230
00:10:44,341 --> 00:10:46,668
YEAH. WHAT ARE YOU
GETTING AT?

231
00:10:46,668 --> 00:10:49,638
MIKU ISN'T
HER REAL CHILD.

232
00:10:49,638 --> 00:10:52,338
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
IBARA?

233
00:10:52,338 --> 00:10:54,344
ARE YOU SAYING
THAT SHE...

234
00:10:54,344 --> 00:10:55,977
[gasps]

235
00:10:55,977 --> 00:10:58,780
AOI, DO YOU KNOW
WHERE SHE MIGHT
BE GOING TO?

236
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,949
I'M SORRY.
I DON'T HAVE
ANY IDEA.

237
00:11:02,984 --> 00:11:06,755
Ibara: MR. KAWABATA,
WE'VE GOT TROUBLE!

238
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,994
WHAT THE HELL?
NOW THE DAD'S GONE.

239
00:11:12,994 --> 00:11:16,338
IT LOOKS LIKE WE
MIGHT HAVE BEEN TRICKED,
DON'T YOU THINK?

240
00:11:16,338 --> 00:11:19,801
I MEAN, WE NEVER
ACTUALLY SAW THIS CHILD,
DID WE, IBARA?

241
00:11:19,801 --> 00:11:21,937
THEY DIDN'T WANT US
TO SAVE THEM,

242
00:11:21,937 --> 00:11:23,805
SO THEY MADE
THAT STORY UP.

243
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,875
THERE'S A CHILD
SOMEWHERE.

244
00:11:28,338 --> 00:11:30,341
Ibara: AOI.

245
00:11:30,341 --> 00:11:33,344
IBARA,
THANK GOODNESS
YOU'RE HERE.

246
00:11:33,344 --> 00:11:36,344
OH, WHAT DO
YOU THINK WE
SHOULD DO NOW?

247
00:11:36,344 --> 00:11:38,344
WE'RE GOING TO LOOK
FOR MS. YUKIKO.

248
00:11:38,344 --> 00:11:41,339
SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE
BEEN ABLE TO GET
TOO FAR AWAY YET.

249
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:44,337
BUT WE
DON'T KNOW WHERE
TO LOOK FOR HER.

250
00:11:45,727 --> 00:11:47,896
Ibara: THESE ARE
MS. YUKIKO'S
SPARE BOOTS.

251
00:11:47,896 --> 00:11:48,964
TRACK THE SMELL.

252
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:54,069
Ibara: THEY WERE
PROBABLY ARGUING OVER

253
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:55,837
WHETHER TO SEND OUT
AN S.O.S.

254
00:11:55,837 --> 00:11:57,339
MS. YUKIKO DIDN'T AGREE

255
00:11:57,339 --> 00:11:59,674
WITH HER HUSBAND'S DECISION
TO CALL FOR HELP,

256
00:11:59,674 --> 00:12:01,340
SO SHE TOOK
THE CHILD HOSTAGE.

257
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,844
NO WAY.

258
00:12:02,844 --> 00:12:05,046
SHE'S JUST NOT
THAT KIND OF PERSON.

259
00:12:05,046 --> 00:12:07,983
SHE'S CHANGED
THE WAY SHE THINKS
ABOUT THINGS

260
00:12:07,983 --> 00:12:10,719
AFTER LIVING
IN THIS CITY
FOR SO LONG.

00:12:14,341 --> 00:12:17,058
IS HE SAYING
THAT SHE'S
UP IN THERE?

264
00:12:17,058 --> 00:12:18,760
OH, NO.

265
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,339
THAT'S THE HOTEL
WE SAW THAT'S
FALLING OVER.

266
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,338
YOU TWO,
STAY RIGHT HERE

267
00:12:24,338 --> 00:12:26,001
WHILE I GO
LOOK INSIDE.

268
00:12:26,001 --> 00:12:27,341
IBARA, WAIT!

269
00:12:27,341 --> 00:12:28,837
IT'S DANGEROUS!

270
00:12:28,837 --> 00:12:31,337
IF RAIN GETS
INTO THEIR HAZMAT SUITS,

271
00:12:31,337 --> 00:12:32,340
THEY'RE IN TROUBLE.

272
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,343
THERE'S NO TIME TO WASTE!

273
00:12:33,343 --> 00:12:36,011
Aoi: OK!
BUT BE CAREFUL!

274
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:50,342
HMM.

275
00:12:50,342 --> 00:12:53,061
WHAT? IS THERE
SOMETHING WRONG,
TAEKO?

276
00:12:53,061 --> 00:12:55,730
DON'T YOU HEAR
THE HELICOPTER
COMING THIS WAY?

277
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:57,336
Mishima:
NARUSE, COME IN.

278
00:12:57,336 --> 00:12:59,344
WE'RE HERE.
WHERE'S THE CHILD?

279
00:12:59,344 --> 00:13:01,836
Ibara: I'M LOOKING
FOR HER RIGHT NOW.

280
00:13:01,836 --> 00:13:03,772
COME TO THE LEANING HOTEL.

281
00:13:03,772 --> 00:13:05,342
WE'RE ON OUR WAY.

STAY AWAY!

284
00:13:16,918 --> 00:13:19,020
IF YOU COME
ANY CLOSER,

285
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,922
I'LL SHOOT.

286
00:13:22,338 --> 00:13:23,925
I MEAN IT.

287
00:13:23,925 --> 00:13:25,342
STAY AWAY.

288
00:13:26,342 --> 00:13:27,696
WHERE IS MIKU?

289
00:13:27,696 --> 00:13:29,341
WE HAVE TO GET
OUT OF HERE.

290
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:32,000
THERE IS NO MIKU.

291
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,345
WE'VE BEEN
FOOLING YOU FROM
THE VERY BEGINNING.

00:13:34,345 --> 00:13:35,904
[laughs]

293
00:13:35,904 --> 00:13:37,973
AND YOU FELL FOR IT!

294
00:13:41,336 --> 00:13:42,877
HAND OVER THE GIRL.

00:13:47,983 --> 00:13:50,752
MIKU. I TOLD YOU
TO STAY INSIDE.

298
00:13:50,752 --> 00:13:52,344
OH, NO.
SHE'S RUNNING OUT OF AIR.

299
00:13:52,344 --> 00:13:53,688
GET BACK!

300
00:13:53,688 --> 00:13:56,339
SHE'S MY PRECIOUS
LITTLE GIRL.

301
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:58,693
I DON'T WANT
TO LOSE ANOTHER ONE.

302
00:13:58,693 --> 00:14:02,697
MY HUSBAND AND I
WILL PROBABLY
BE ARRESTED.

303
00:14:02,697 --> 00:14:04,338
WE'LL BE TAKEN AWAY,

304
00:14:04,338 --> 00:14:06,701
AND THEN
SHE'LL BE ALL ALONE.

305
00:14:06,701 --> 00:14:09,339
THERE'S STILL A CHANCE
TO SAVE HER, MS. YUKIKO.

306
00:14:09,339 --> 00:14:11,806
YOU HAVE
TO HAND HER OVER TO ME.

307
00:14:11,806 --> 00:14:13,339
WHAT IS WRONG
WITH YOU?

308
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:14,341
HUH?

309
00:14:14,341 --> 00:14:17,341
DON'T YOU HAVE
ANY FEELINGS?

310
00:14:17,341 --> 00:14:21,883
YOU'RE JUST
A COLD-BLOODED PUPPET,
AREN'T YOU?

311
00:14:21,883 --> 00:14:24,345
IF YOU DO HAVE
A SHRED OF HUMANITY,

312
00:14:24,345 --> 00:14:28,023
THEN PLEASE
JUST LEAVE US ALONE.

313
00:14:29,342 --> 00:14:32,694
YOU ALL CAN'T SURVIVE
IN THESE CONDITIONS.

314
00:14:32,694 --> 00:14:34,896
YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND ANYTHING.

315
00:14:34,896 --> 00:14:38,341
PEOPLE MADE
THE CHOICE
TO STAY BEHIND HERE.

316
00:14:38,341 --> 00:14:41,770
WE'RE ABLE TO LIVE
OUR LIVES FREELY
AND ON OUR OWN.

317
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:44,039
WE JUST WANT
TO LIVE HERE
IN PEACE!

318
00:14:49,844 --> 00:14:52,340
I'M SORRY, BUT I JUST--

319
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,883
JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
THESE MATTERS.
