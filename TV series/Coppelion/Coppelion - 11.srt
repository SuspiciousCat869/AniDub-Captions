THEY WON'T STOP
UNTIL THEY'VE
DESTROYED THE CITY.

00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,826
WHY DO YOU HUMANS
TRY TO HURT EACH OTHER?

10
00:02:18,826 --> 00:02:20,728
IF YOU WERE
ALL MADE EQUAL,

THE POLICE STATION.

WE'RE
IN SERIOUS TROUBLE.

39
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:13,207
GO FOR ITS SWITCH.
HMM?

40
00:04:13,207 --> 00:04:15,776
THERE'S A MANUAL SWITCH
AT THE END OF THE ABDOMEN

41
00:04:15,776 --> 00:04:17,207
THAT OPENS UP THE HATCH.

WE SUPPOSED TO CLIMB
ALL THE WAY UP THERE?

WE'VE GOTTA
GO FASTER!

00:04:34,728 --> 00:04:37,207
WE'LL USE THIS WIRE GUN
TO GET AT THE SWITCH.

52
00:04:37,207 --> 00:04:39,200
I THINK
I CAN HIT THE SPIKE

53
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,868
COMING OUT
OF THE IRON SPIDER'S
ABDOMEN.

00:04:40,868 --> 00:04:42,603
WE'LL CLIMB OUR WAY UP.

55
00:04:42,603 --> 00:04:43,871
WHAT IF
THE OZU SISTERS

56
00:04:43,871 --> 00:04:45,806
ATTACK THE WIRE
ONCE IT'S SET UP?

57
00:04:45,806 --> 00:04:48,201
I'M GONNA HAVE
TO KEEP THEM OCCUPIED THEN.

58
00:04:48,201 --> 00:04:50,201
THAT MEANS
I CAN'T GO UP THERE.

59
00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:52,200

TO PUSH THE SWITCH.

I SEE SOMETHING.

THAT MUST
BE THE SWITCH

WE COULDN'T
FIND THEIR BODIES
ANYWHERE,

00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:45,204
NOT THE OZU SISTERS
OR THE WHITE COAT.

137
00:08:45,204 --> 00:08:46,880
OUR PLAN
WILL BE EXPOSED

138
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,550
IF WE DON'T DRAW
THEIR ATTENTION BACK TO US.

139
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,951
THAT'S TRUE,
BUT WE HAVE

140
00:08:50,951 --> 00:08:53,200
A BIGGER PROBLEM
TO DEAL WITH.

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,822
IT'S ALREADY
1600 HOURS?

TO THE TIME?

00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,691
YOU WERE OUT
FOR A WHILE,

EARLIER TO YOU.

IT'S NOT HERE YET?!

NO. I HAVEN'T SEEN
A TRACE OF IT.

148
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:10,205
THE MAINTENANCE TEAM
MIGHT HAVE RUN INTO
SOME TROUBLE.

149
00:09:10,205 --> 00:09:12,773
THEN I'M GONNA GO

STAY HERE, AND REST.

00:09:25,953 --> 00:09:28,200
I'LL GO CHECK OUT
WHAT HAPPENED.

BUT YOU'RE GONNA
BE BACK SOON, RIGHT?

SCIENCE WILL ALWAYS
HAVE TWO SIDES TO IT.

YOU'RE DEFINITELY
ON THE POSITIVE SIDE,

00:10:11,531 --> 00:10:14,208
THE ARMORED TRAIN
IS COMPLETE.

167
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:18,200
IT'S AMAZING
YOU DID THIS REBUILD
IN JUST HALF A DAY.

168
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,209
HEY, HOW ARE YOU GUYS
ON THE DIVERSION TEAM
DOING?

169
00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:23,844
WE HAD
SOME SETBACKS.

170
00:10:23,844 --> 00:10:26,205
BUT WHATEVER.
WE DON'T HAVE
MUCH TIME LEFT.

171
00:10:26,205 --> 00:10:28,849
HOW'S MISS IBUKI
HOLDING UP
BACK THERE?

172
00:10:28,849 --> 00:10:30,517
Kurobe: I HAVEN'T BEEN
INSIDE THE SHELTER,

173
00:10:30,517 --> 00:10:31,885
SO I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY.

174
00:10:31,885 --> 00:10:35,202
ALL WE CAN DO IS PRAY
FOR A SAFE DELIVERY.

175
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:37,204
THE TRAIN'S READY,
BUT THERE WAS A PROBLEM

176
00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:38,792
AT THE TRANSFORMER
SUBSTATION,

177
00:10:38,792 --> 00:10:40,206
SO GOJIRO
WENT TO FIX IT.

178
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,565
IF WITHIN
THE NEXT 40 MINUTES,

179
00:10:45,565 --> 00:10:47,200
WE DON'T GET
THAT TRAIN STARTED,

180
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,207
THEN YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.

181
00:10:48,207 --> 00:10:50,504
YOU'RE ALL GONNA DIE.

182
00:10:50,504 --> 00:10:51,538
WHAT?!
WHAT?!

183
00:10:51,538 --> 00:10:53,209
I KNEW SENDING GOJIRO

184
00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:56,201
OUT THERE ON THIS JOB
WAS A MISTAKE.

185
00:10:56,201 --> 00:10:57,844
HMM. THE GUY SAID
HE COULD FIX IT

186
00:10:57,844 --> 00:11:00,207
BECAUSE HE USED TO WORK
FOR THE POWER COMPANY.

187
00:11:00,207 --> 00:11:02,201
I'M GOING
TO THE SUBSTATION.

188
00:11:02,201 --> 00:11:03,617
[thunder crashing]

189
00:11:03,617 --> 00:11:05,652
Haruto:
WE COPPELION EXIST

190
00:11:05,652 --> 00:11:06,820
BECAUSE OF
HUMAN MISTAKES,

191
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,206
SO WHY AM I TRYING
TO SAVE THEM?

192
00:11:12,206 --> 00:11:16,206
Ibara: HARUTO, YOU
STILL WANT TO BELIEVE
IN HUMANS, DON'T YOU?

193
00:11:20,441 --> 00:11:22,309
DAMN IT. WHY?

194
00:11:22,309 --> 00:11:24,511
WHY ISN'T IT
GETTING ANY POWER?

195
00:11:24,511 --> 00:11:28,482
I'M RUNNING OUT OF TIME
WITH NO HELP.

196
00:11:28,482 --> 00:11:29,483
IBUKI.

197
00:11:30,484 --> 00:11:32,553
OH, IBUKI.

198
00:11:32,553 --> 00:11:35,522
I'M SORRY
YOUR DAD CAN'T DO
ANY MORE FOR YOU.

199
00:11:35,522 --> 00:11:36,523
[footstep]
HUH?

200
00:11:36,523 --> 00:11:38,492
YOU CAN STILL DO IT.

201
00:11:38,492 --> 00:11:40,845
HOW ABOUT
YOU LET ME HELP YOU?

202
00:11:44,498 --> 00:11:45,852
I FIGURED IT OUT.

203
00:11:45,852 --> 00:11:48,302
YOU WORKED
AT THAT COMPANY,
DIDN'T YOU?

204
00:11:48,302 --> 00:11:49,436
[gasps]
DAMN IT.

205
00:11:49,436 --> 00:11:51,846
THAT KUROBE'S
A BLABBERMOUTH.

206
00:11:51,846 --> 00:11:53,540
THERE'S NO POINT
IN HIDING IT NOW.

207
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,846
IF WE DON'T HURRY,
THE WIND'LL
SWALLOW US UP.

208
00:11:55,846 --> 00:11:58,278
LET'S SPLIT UP
AND TRY TO FIND
THE BREAK.

209
00:11:58,278 --> 00:11:59,279
HMM.

210
00:12:00,314 --> 00:12:01,582
Gojiro:
IN THOSE DAYS,

211
00:12:01,582 --> 00:12:03,317
I OFTEN FELT
SO POWERLESS.

212
00:12:03,317 --> 00:12:07,321
THE COUNTRY
SPENT HUGE AMOUNTS
OF MONEY EVERY YEAR,

213
00:12:07,321 --> 00:12:09,456
BUT MOST OF THE FUNDING
THAT SHOULD HAVE GONE

214
00:12:09,456 --> 00:12:11,525
TO SAFETY MEASURES
WAS CUT.

215
00:12:11,525 --> 00:12:13,851
IN THE END,
FACILITY MANAGEMENT

216
00:12:13,851 --> 00:12:15,844
WAS REASSIGNED
ELSEWHERE.

217
00:12:15,844 --> 00:12:17,464
COMPANY EMPLOYEES
STARTED LEAVING

218
00:12:17,464 --> 00:12:19,433
NOW-DANGEROUS
WORKPLACES.

219
00:12:19,433 --> 00:12:20,501
[grunts]

220
00:12:20,501 --> 00:12:22,847
I BEGAN TO THINK...
[crackling]

221
00:12:22,847 --> 00:12:25,339
THIS IS JUST
HOW THE COUNTRY WORKS.

222
00:12:25,339 --> 00:12:28,442
THE WHEELS FELL OFF
A LONG TIME AGO.

223
00:12:28,442 --> 00:12:30,577
EVERYONE ACTED
LIKE NOTHING WAS WRONG.

224
00:12:30,577 --> 00:12:33,414
THEY KEPT THEIR HEADS
BURIED IN THE SAND.

225
00:12:33,414 --> 00:12:37,418
THAT ACCIDENT
WAS THE PRICE
WE ULTIMATELY PAID.

226
00:12:37,418 --> 00:12:41,422
IT IS TRUE I WAS A COG
IN THAT BIG MACHINE.

227
00:12:41,422 --> 00:12:45,426
IT COST MONEY TO DO
REGULAR INSPECTIONS.

228
00:12:45,426 --> 00:12:47,843
THAT'S WHY I FOLLOWED
COMPANY ORDERS

229
00:12:47,843 --> 00:12:49,563
AND CUT BACK ON
HOW MANY WE PERFORMED.

230
00:12:49,563 --> 00:12:50,564
OVER HERE.

231
00:12:50,564 --> 00:12:52,433
BECAUSE OF WHAT I DID,

232
00:12:52,433 --> 00:12:54,201
MILLIONS HAD TO SUFFER.

233
00:12:54,201 --> 00:12:56,236
Haruto: BUT YOU STAYED
UNTIL THE VERY END,
DIDN'T YOU?

234
00:12:56,236 --> 00:12:59,440
THE ONLY ONE LEFT
IN THAT TREACHEROUS
WORKPLACE.

235
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,846
WHEN THE WHEELS FALL OFF,
WE JUST HAVE TO FIX 'EM.

236
00:13:09,216 --> 00:13:11,846
AH, THE POWER'S WORKING.

237
00:13:11,846 --> 00:13:13,454
WAY TO GO, GUYS.

238
00:13:13,454 --> 00:13:14,455
[boom]

239
00:13:14,455 --> 00:13:15,851
EH?

240
00:13:15,851 --> 00:13:19,426
WHAT IN THE HELL
CAUSED THAT SOUND?

241
00:13:19,426 --> 00:13:22,429
OH, NO.
THE POWER'S FAILING.

242
00:13:22,429 --> 00:13:25,432
DO YOU THINK THAT SOUND
COULD HAVE BEEN...

243
00:13:25,432 --> 00:13:28,435
Both:
AN ELECTRICAL POLE FALLING!

244
00:13:28,435 --> 00:13:30,571
[panting]
HARUTO,

245
00:13:30,571 --> 00:13:33,207
WHY DO YOU
HELP US HUMANS?

246
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,848
WE CREATED
THIS ROTTEN MESS,

247
00:13:36,848 --> 00:13:40,514
AND WE'LL MAKE
THE SAME KIND OF MISTAKES
ALL OVER AGAIN.

248
00:13:40,514 --> 00:13:42,182
YOU'RE RIGHT.

249
00:13:42,182 --> 00:13:46,487
THAT'S WHY YOU NEED
TO BE THE ONE
TO HELP THEM.

250
00:13:46,487 --> 00:13:48,847
NO MATTER
HOW DANGEROUS
THE SITUATION IS,

251
00:13:48,847 --> 00:13:50,845
YOU FACED THE PROBLEM
WITHOUT RUNNING AWAY.

252
00:13:50,845 --> 00:13:53,427
AS LONG AS THERE ARE
STILL BRAVE PEOPLE
LIKE YOU,

253
00:13:53,427 --> 00:13:54,849
ACCIDENTS
CAN BE AVOIDED.

254
00:13:54,849 --> 00:13:57,847
SO YOU SEE,
THIS TIME, MR. GOJIRO,

255
00:13:57,847 --> 00:14:00,367
I WANT YOU
TO SAVE MANKIND.

256
00:14:04,849 --> 00:14:06,540
CAN YOU FIX IT, GENNAI?

257
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,175
[gunshots]
HUH?

258
00:14:08,175 --> 00:14:09,176
WHAT WAS THAT?

259
00:14:09,176 --> 00:14:10,410
IT SOUNDED
LIKE GUNSHOTS.

260
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:13,850
PLEASE HANG IN THERE,
HARUTO! DON'T DIE!

261
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,283
TOO BAD.

262
00:14:16,283 --> 00:14:18,844
HE WAS SO CLOSE.

263
00:14:18,844 --> 00:14:22,843
WHAT EXACTLY IS IT
THAT YOU WANT
FROM ALL THIS?

264
00:14:22,843 --> 00:14:24,258
WHAT'S WORTH IT?

265
00:14:24,258 --> 00:14:26,560
I DEVOTED MYSELF
TO THE SOLE PURPOSE

266
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,462
OF SERVING SOCIETY
AND THE PEOPLE.

267
00:14:28,462 --> 00:14:30,849
TO GIVE OUR LIVES
TO PROTECT THIS COUNTRY,

268
00:14:30,849 --> 00:14:34,201
THAT'S THE PLEDGE
MY MEN AND I MADE
BACK THEN.

269
00:14:34,201 --> 00:14:36,846
I WONDER WHY
THEY'RE GIVING US
THESE MASKS.

270
00:14:36,846 --> 00:14:39,239
I THOUGHT THIS WAS
AN EARTHQUAKE
RESCUE.

271
00:14:40,274 --> 00:14:42,442
THAT DAY, WE HEADED OUT

272
00:14:42,442 --> 00:14:44,844
TO RESCUE
THE CITY'S CITIZENS.

273
00:14:44,844 --> 00:14:45,847
LISTEN UP!

274
00:14:45,847 --> 00:14:47,581
OUR MISSION IS
TO PROTECT THIS LAND

275
00:14:47,581 --> 00:14:50,417
AND THE PEOPLE
AT ALL COSTS.
IS THAT CLEAR?

00:14:50,417 --> 00:14:52,252
[soldiers yell]

277
00:14:52,252 --> 00:14:54,254
I WENT
LOOKING AROUND TO FIND

278
00:14:54,254 --> 00:14:55,850
THE THEN
MINISTER OF DEFENSE.

279
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:59,193
HE WAS A LONGTIME

DEFENSE MINISTER

281
00:15:01,395 --> 00:15:04,398
YOU KNOW HIM
AS THE CURRENT
PRIME MINISTER.

282
00:15:04,398 --> 00:15:05,849
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

283
00:15:05,849 --> 00:15:08,845
HOW CAN SOMEONE FORSAKE
ALL OUR CITIZENS?

285
00:15:10,404 --> 00:15:12,272
WE'RE BEING
LEFT IN THE DARK.

286
00:15:12,272 --> 00:15:13,574
WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON?

287
00:15:13,574 --> 00:15:15,309
I DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA.

288
00:15:15,309 --> 00:15:17,277
ALL I KNOW
IS OUR PRIORITY

289
00:15:17,277 --> 00:15:19,246
IS PROTECTING
THE PRIME MINISTER.

290
00:15:19,246 --> 00:15:22,844
UNDERSTOOD.
LEAVE THIS AREA TO US.

291
00:15:22,844 --> 00:15:24,843
LOOK AFTER THE COUNTRY,

Kunikida: BY THE TIME
I REALIZED THE TRUTH,

294
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:33,327
IT WAS ALREADY TOO LATE.

295
00:15:33,327 --> 00:15:35,846
THE GOVERNMENT
ABANDONED THE CITIZENS

296
00:15:35,846 --> 00:15:39,399
AND RAN AWAY
TO SAVE THEIR OWN NECKS.

297
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:41,847
IT'S ALWAYS THE WEAK
AND THE BRAVE

298
00:15:41,847 --> 00:15:45,505
WHO ARE THE ONES WHO GET
LEFT BEHIND IN HELL.

299
00:15:45,505 --> 00:15:50,849
WE DON'T NEED
A FUTURE THAT DEMANDS
SUCH A HIGH COST.

300
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:55,415
THEN WHY DIDN'T
YOU TAKE ANY ACTION
AT ALL UNTIL NOW?

301
00:15:55,415 --> 00:15:57,217
WHAT?

302
00:15:57,217 --> 00:15:59,848
ALL THIS TIME,
LIKE A GHOST,

303
00:15:59,848 --> 00:16:03,423
YOU SAT AND WATCHED
WHAT WAS HAPPENING
TO THIS WORLD.

304
00:16:03,423 --> 00:16:05,847
YOUR MOTIVATIONS
WERE THE SAME AS MINE.

305
00:16:05,847 --> 00:16:07,847
YOU SEE, I KNOW YOU HAVE

306
00:16:07,847 --> 00:16:09,846
A LEVEL OF BELIEF
IN HUMANITY,

307
00:16:09,846 --> 00:16:12,849
AND NOW YOU WANT TO SEE
JUST HOW FAR IT CAN GO.

308
00:16:12,849 --> 00:16:16,169
THOSE GIRLS LANDED
IN A DARK WORLD,

309
00:16:16,169 --> 00:16:19,273
AND NOW THEY'RE
TRYING TO LIGHT
THE WAY FOR MANKIND.

310
00:16:19,273 --> 00:16:21,208
YOU WANT THEM TO SUCCEED,

00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,849
TO COMPLETE THEIR JOURNEY.

312
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:25,848
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT I WANT.

313
00:16:25,848 --> 00:16:28,148
I HAVE COMRADES WHO
SHARE MY MISSION.

314
00:16:28,148 --> 00:16:29,583
THERE'S
NO TURNING BACK.

315
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:30,849
I MUST CONTINUE.
