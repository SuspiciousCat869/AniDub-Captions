IT'LL JUST GIVE HIM

TO THIS TYPE OF HARSH,

WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH THE TWO OF YOU NOW?

NOTHING.
IT'S JUST THAT

CAN'T SURVIVE

IT'S A MODERN
NECESSITY!

271

TO GET US
A SHINY NEW ONE,

HOW DO YOU ADDRESS
THE SAFETY

OF THE SELF-DEFENSE

ON THIS TEAM?

288
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,159
WE HAVE
THE BARRIER SUIT.

289
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:03,749
IT WAS DEVELOPED
TO PROTECT AGAINST
THE HARSHEST CONDITIONS.

TESTS HAVE PROVEN
THEY'RE 99% EFFECTIVE.

291
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:11,753
OF COURSE THE LAST 1%
IS ALWAYS ON OUR MINDS.

292
00:16:11,753 --> 00:16:13,752
TURN THAT THING OFF.

293
00:16:13,752 --> 00:16:15,755
IT DOESN'T APPLY
TO US, ANYWAY.

294
00:16:15,755 --> 00:16:18,751
COME ON. LET'S GO.

WE'D LIKE
THE WHOLE NATION

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,757
TO SEE THE STATE
OF THE OLD CAPITAL.

301
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:45,752
I WONDER WHAT EXACTLY
IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW
DOWN AT THE EPICENTER.

302
00:16:45,752 --> 00:16:48,753
I'VE HEARD
THAT PEOPLE CAN'T
GO ANYWHERE NEAR IT

303
00:16:48,753 --> 00:16:50,757
BECAUSE IT'S
SO CONTAMINATED.

304
00:16:50,757 --> 00:16:53,279
BUT SOMEONE IS
MONITORING IT, RIGHT?

305
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,281
WHO CARES, ANYWAY?

306
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:57,752
I SAY WE STAY
IN A HOTEL!

307
00:16:57,752 --> 00:17:00,386
HEY, IBARA,
DON'T YOU THINK
WE DESERVE IT

308
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:02,255
AFTER COMING
ALL THIS WAY?

309
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:04,424
LOOK AT THAT HOTEL, AOI.
HOW'S THAT?

SERIOUSLY?

312
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,463
THAT HOTEL IS
FALLING OVER!

313
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:13,266
THIS CITY SUFFERED
A CATASTROPHE,

314
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:15,757
AND WE ARE
JUST ABLE TO SEE
ALL OF ITS SCARS.

Man: THE FOG SURE
IS THICK TODAY.

316
00:17:21,752 --> 00:17:25,445
WE PROBABLY
WON'T EVEN BE ABLE
TO SEE THE COFFIN.

317
00:17:25,445 --> 00:17:27,757

TO THE TV STATION.

YES, SIR,

320
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:34,053
BUT DON'T BLAME ME
IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG.

321
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,757
HOW ARE THINGS LOOKING,

00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,750
A THICK FOG SURROUNDS
THE EPICENTER,

324
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,195
OBSCURING OUR VIEW.

325
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:44,197
THIS FOG IS
ACTUALLY A CLUSTER

326
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:46,752
OF FINE PARTICLES
KNOWN AS HOT PARTICLES.

327
00:17:46,752 --> 00:17:49,235
THEY GET PICKED UP
BY THE SEA BREEZE,

328
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,204
MIX WITH THE MOISTURE
IN THE AIR,

329
00:17:51,204 --> 00:17:52,272
AND FORM A MIST.

330
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:53,756
Announcer:
DO THESE HOT PARTICLES

331
00:17:53,756 --> 00:17:57,076
MEAN THAT
THE EPICENTER IS STILL
HIGHLY CONTAMINATED?

332
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,378
THAT IS CORRECT.

333
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:00,179
A PERSON
COULD NOT SURVIVE

334
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,282
ANYWHERE WITHIN
OR EVEN AROUND IT.

335
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:03,756
Announcer: I SEE.

336
00:18:03,756 --> 00:18:06,486
IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU'D HAVE TO USE
A ROBOT OR THE LIKE

337
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:08,254
TO BE ABLE
TO EXAMINE THE SITE.

338
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:09,422

339
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:18,131

THE FOG, IT'S CLEARING.

00:18:20,757 --> 00:18:22,748
WE'VE GOT 50 SECONDS.

343
00:18:22,748 --> 00:18:24,748
WE CAN'T STAY
ANY LONGER THAN THAT.

344
00:18:24,748 --> 00:18:26,754
Mishima:
CITIZENS OF JAPAN,

345
00:18:26,754 --> 00:18:29,749
PLEASE STOP
WHAT YOU'RE DOING
FOR JUST A MOMENT,

346
00:18:29,749 --> 00:18:31,748
AND TAKE A LOOK
AT YOUR TV SETS.

347
00:18:31,748 --> 00:18:36,748
IN ONE DAY,
THE WHOLE WORLD CHANGED.

348
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:37,756
WHY DID THIS HAPPEN?

349
00:18:37,756 --> 00:18:40,186
COULD WE HAVE DONE
ANYTHING TO PREVENT IT?

350
00:18:41,755 --> 00:18:44,424
WHAT YOU'RE SEEING NOW
IS THE EPICENTER

351
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:46,426
THAT DESTROYED 90%
OF THE OLD CAPITAL.

352
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:48,757
SO, CITIZENS OF JAPAN--

353
00:18:48,757 --> 00:18:52,065
NO, PEOPLE OF THE WORLD,

354
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:55,752
PANDORA'S BOX HAS BEEN
OPENED BY HUMAN HANDS.

355
00:18:55,752 --> 00:18:59,405
OUR PROBLEM NOW
IS WE DON'T KNOW
HOW TO CLOSE IT.

356
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:00,755
[wind blowing]

357
00:19:00,755 --> 00:19:02,508
LET'S GO.

358
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:04,510
OUR JOB IS
TO FIND PEOPLE.

359
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:11,250
Y-YOU'RE RIGHT.

360
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,754
LET'S GO!

361
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:23,756
HUH?
THAT TALL TOWER,

362
00:19:23,756 --> 00:19:25,749
WHAT IS THAT?

363
00:19:28,754 --> 00:19:31,204
IT'S A PLANT
OF SOME KIND, I THINK.

364
00:19:31,204 --> 00:19:32,756
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.

365
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:35,755
THAT PLACE
IS CRAZY HUGE.

366
00:19:35,755 --> 00:19:38,755
IT'S WAY BIGGER
THAN THE PRISON
NEXT TO IT.

367
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:48,488
Aoi: OH, MY GOD!

368
00:19:48,488 --> 00:19:51,057
THIS PLACE IS
FREAKING HUMONGOUS!

369
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:53,292
LOOK HOW FAR DOWN
IT GOES.

370
00:19:54,748 --> 00:19:57,063
IT'S LIKE A TOWN
UNTO ITSELF.

371
00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:58,064

HUH? HEY,

375
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:06,072
THE NUMBERS
ON THE COUNTER

376
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:07,750
HAVE
REALLY SPIKED.

377
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,075
IS IT A PERSON?

378
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:13,279
WAIT. IT POINTS
TO WHERE WE CAME FROM.

379
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:16,416
THAT'S THE SAME DOG
FROM THIS MORNING.

380
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:19,052
Taeko: HE MUST HAVE
FOLLOWED US HERE.

381
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:21,756
HMM. HOW MANY
MORE DISTRACTIONS
WILL THERE BE?

382
00:20:21,756 --> 00:20:23,222
HE'S GOING
TO KEEP US

383
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,158
FROM FINDING
THE PEOPLE
WE NEED TO HELP.

384
00:20:25,158 --> 00:20:26,426
I'LL GO TALK TO HIM

385
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:28,757
SO HE'LL STAY HERE
AND BE OUT OF OUR WAY.

386
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:31,756
THIS IS
THE PERFECT JOB FOR ME,

387
00:20:31,756 --> 00:20:34,434
BECAUSE I
MANAGED THE ANIMALS
BACK AT THE SCHOOL.

388
00:20:35,751 --> 00:20:37,752
ALL RIGHT.
IF WE FIND ANYONE,

389
00:20:37,752 --> 00:20:39,338
WE'LL COME BACK
FOR YOU.

390
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:40,754
Ibara:
KEEP YOUR RADIO ON.

391
00:20:40,754 --> 00:20:42,308
WE'LL BE
ON CHANNEL TWO.

392
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:43,309
OK.

393
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,749
HEY, IBARA,

394
00:20:45,749 --> 00:20:47,757
HOW IS SHE SO GOOD
WITH ANIMALS?

395
00:20:47,757 --> 00:20:49,749
WELL, SHE'S
GOOD WITH THEM

396
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:50,752
BECAUSE
IT WAS WRITTEN

RIGHT INTO HER
GENETIC CODING.

398
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:56,189
SHE WAS BORN WITH
THE ENHANCED SENSES
OF AN ANIMAL.

Y-YEAH. I THINK SO.

427
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,079
IS IT THE SAME DOG,

WAS FOLLOWING US?

NO, THIS ISN'T
THAT DOG.

AT ITS FANGS.

THAT TAEKO,
