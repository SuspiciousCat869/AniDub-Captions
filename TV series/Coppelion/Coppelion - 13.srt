329
00:17:01,471 --> 00:17:02,572
I AM MISHIMA,

330
00:17:02,572 --> 00:17:04,674
THE COMMANDER
OF THIS RESCUE TEAM.

331
00:17:04,674 --> 00:17:07,310
FIRST, LET ME APOLOGIZE
FOR THE TROUBLE

332
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:09,479
OUR INEFFECTIVENESS
HAS CAUSED.

333
00:17:09,479 --> 00:17:12,582
HMM. SO YOU'RE
THE ONE THEY CALL
VICE PRINCIPAL.

334
00:17:12,582 --> 00:17:14,968
YOU'RE JUST
THE STRAITLACED
KIND OF MAN

335
00:17:14,968 --> 00:17:16,972
I IMAGINED
YOU WOULD BE.

336
00:17:16,972 --> 00:17:19,970
THIS GUY HERE IS
MY FRIEND GENNAI.

337
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:21,424
WOULD YOU
PLEASE PUT HIM

338
00:17:21,424 --> 00:17:22,966
ON THE CHOPPER
WITH US?

339
00:17:22,966 --> 00:17:24,327
HE DESERVES
THE OUTSIDE WORLD

340
00:17:24,327 --> 00:17:25,970
AS MUCH
AS ANY OF US.

341
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:28,364
PLUS, I'M GONNA
HAVE A NEW LIFE.

342
00:17:28,364 --> 00:17:31,970
I WANT TO SHOW
THE OLD GEEZER
WHAT IT CAN BE.

343
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:33,966
UNDERSTOOD.

344
00:17:33,966 --> 00:17:36,473
WE'LL HELP
IN ANY WAY WE CAN.

00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:41,969
WHAT THE HELL?

349
00:17:41,969 --> 00:17:43,969
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOU GUYS?

350
00:17:43,969 --> 00:17:46,974
WE'RE GIVING UP AND
TURNING OURSELVES IN.

351
00:17:46,974 --> 00:17:50,687
YOU CAN PUT RESTRAINTS
ON US AND TAKE US AWAY.

WE DIDN'T BRING
ANY HANDCUFFS WITH US.

355
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:57,969
HUH?
NOW SHUT UP,

356
00:17:57,969 --> 00:17:59,662
AND GET IN THE CHOPPER.
[groans]

357

THIS REALLY IS GOODBYE,
ISN'T IT?

IT'S THE PHOTO WE
ALL TOOK TOGETHER
YESTERDAY.

Gojiro:
YESTERDAY, HUH?

363
00:18:26,389 --> 00:18:29,692
IT SEEMS LIKE
IT WAS AGES AGO.

364
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,974
I CAN'T BELIEVE
IT'S BEEN JUST FOUR DAYS

365
00:18:31,974 --> 00:18:33,972
SINCE THE FIRST TIME
WE MET.

366
00:18:33,972 --> 00:18:38,535
IT REALLY FEELS
LIKE WE'VE BEEN
TOGETHER FOR DECADES.

367
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:41,638
TIME MOVES
IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS.

368
00:18:41,638 --> 00:18:44,407
THERE HAS BEEN
A HEAVY PRICE PAID

369
00:18:44,407 --> 00:18:46,972
WITH ALL THE YEARS
WE'VE LOST HERE,

370
00:18:46,972 --> 00:18:49,971
BUT I FEEL
LIKE WE WERE ABLE

371
00:18:49,971 --> 00:18:53,349
TO GET THEM BACK
OVER THESE LAST FOUR DAYS
IN SOME WAY.

372
00:18:53,349 --> 00:18:54,350
HMM.

373
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,485
ME, TOO, DAD.

374
00:18:55,485 --> 00:18:56,968
THAT'S ENOUGH.

375
00:18:56,968 --> 00:18:59,289
I REALLY HATE
ALL THESE MUSHY MOMENTS,

376
00:18:59,289 --> 00:19:00,974
SO I'M JUST
GONNA GO AHEAD

377
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:02,974
AND EXCUSE MYSELF.
SEE YOU LATER.

378
00:19:02,974 --> 00:19:04,294
WHAT? THAT'S IT?

379
00:19:04,294 --> 00:19:06,966
I WILL BE
ON MY WAY
AS WELL.

THANK YOU
FOR EVERYTHING,
MISS AOI.

WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO NOW?

382
00:19:11,267 --> 00:19:14,470
MASTER IBUKI HAS
OFFERED ME A NEW JOB

383
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:16,966
AS A BABYSITTING ROBOT
FOR HER TWINS.

384
00:19:16,966 --> 00:19:20,376
MISS AOI,
FROM A BIOLOGICAL
PERSPECTIVE,

385
00:19:20,376 --> 00:19:22,278
YOU ARE
A FULL-FLEDGED ADULT,

386
00:19:22,278 --> 00:19:24,547
AND AS AN ADULT,

387
00:19:24,547 --> 00:19:26,382
YOU MUST GET
YOUR ACT TOGETHER.

00:19:32,288 --> 00:19:33,966
Aoi: I WON'T EVER FORGET

392
00:19:33,966 --> 00:19:35,692
WHAT YOU TAUGHT ME,
NO-SENSE,

393
00:19:35,692 --> 00:19:37,660
THAT JUST
A SINGLE THOUGHT

394
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,973
CAN CHANGE
THE ENTIRE WORLD.

395
00:19:39,973 --> 00:19:41,731
WE'LL KEEP THAT IN MIND

396
00:19:41,731 --> 00:19:44,701
AS WE STRIVE TO LIVE
HERE IN THIS CITY.

397
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,706
I GUESS WE'D BETTER
GET GOING, TOO.

398
00:19:49,706 --> 00:19:52,969
DON'T WANT TO KEEP
THAT HELICOPTER WAITING.

SOMETHING

00:19:54,974 --> 00:19:57,480
I WOULD LIKE YOU
TO DO FOR ME.

401
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,970
REALLY?
WHAT IS IT,
MISS IBUKI?

402
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:04,970
I WANT YOU
TO NAME THESE TWO
BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN.

403
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,972
WHA? I'M SORRY,

404
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,691
BUT THIS IS
SO SUDDEN.

405
00:20:08,691 --> 00:20:11,694
IN THAT CASE,
I'D BE HAPPY TO NAME THEM.

406
00:20:11,694 --> 00:20:13,970
THIS LITTLE BOY
WILL BE RIKU,

407
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:15,565
AND THIS GIRL
SORA.

408
00:20:15,565 --> 00:20:16,699
WHAT DO
YOU THINK?

409
00:20:16,699 --> 00:20:17,974
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

410
00:20:17,974 --> 00:20:20,270
THOSE ARE
J.S.D.F. BRANCHES.

411
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:22,505
I THINK THOSE
ARE GREAT NAMES.

412
00:20:22,505 --> 00:20:23,969
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
TARO?

413
00:20:23,969 --> 00:20:24,972
DO YOU LIKE THEM?

414
00:20:24,972 --> 00:20:26,966
AGREED. THEY'RE PERFECT.

415
00:20:26,966 --> 00:20:31,281
RIKU, SORA,
TAKE A GOOD LOOK
AROUND HERE.

THIS IS WHERE
YOU WERE BORN.

THANK YOU SO MUCH,
EVERYONE.

I'LL BE THE BEST
MOTHER I CAN

423
00:20:48,975 --> 00:20:50,667
TO THESE CHILDREN.

424
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:51,973
PLEASE, DO THAT.

425
00:20:51,973 --> 00:20:54,370
CONSIDERING
THE CIRCUMSTANCES,

426
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:56,372
IT'S THE BEST THING
YOU COULD DO
FOR THOSE GIRLS.

HUH?

00:20:57,373 --> 00:20:59,375

THE TRUTH IS...

433
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:31,973
RIKU AND SORA
ARE YOUR CHILDREN,
TOO, GIRLS!

00:21:31,973 --> 00:21:34,969

AND VISIT US SOMETIME!

00:21:35,973 --> 00:21:38,348

WE'LL BE WAITING!
