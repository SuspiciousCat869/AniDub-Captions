00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:45,166
[LUCIFER gasps]

2
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,625
[BELIAL] Enjoying your
accommodations, Lucifer?

3
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:48,916
[LUCIFER grunts]

4
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:53,291
[LUCIFER] The ice I can deal
with, but the view sucks.

5
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:55,375
All I can see is your ugly face.

6
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:59,541
As impertinent
as ever, of course.

7
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:01,041
I know that look.

8
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:04,041
That insufferable arrogance
is your trademark.

9
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:08,625
[BELIAL] But since you're so
famous in heaven and hell alike,

10
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:10,750
I'll have to give you
the VIP treatment

11
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:13,041
for your extended
stay here.

12
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:15,750
Alright. Let's see
what you've got.

13
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:17,708
[BELIAL]
Hm! Ha!

14
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:23,125
[LUCIFER gasps, screams]

15
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:30,041
[LUCIFER grunts] I'm sorry,
but the service here is awful.

16
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:32,625
I'm afraid I'll have to
speak with your manager.

17
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:35,875

[LUCIFER screams, groans]

29
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:21,125
The former leader of the Seven
Virtues reduced to this!

30
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:23,916
My, how the times have changed!

31
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,958
Leader? Oh, was I?
I never thought much of it.

32
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,458
[BELIAL grunts]

33
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:33,583
[LUCIFER screams]

34
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,875
[BELIAL] I doubt this will
teach you any humility,

35
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:40,875
but I might as well have a
little fun before you die.

36
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:44,166
Speaking of which, do you
have any last words?

37
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,666
Now would be the time.

38
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,500
[LUCIFER]
Where is Maria?

39
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:51,416
[BELIAL] Hm! Why does one measly
human mean so much to you?

40
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,583
Or perhaps Maria herself isn't
what you need so badly.

41
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:58,291
What the hell are
you trying to say?

42
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:02,041
[BELIAL chuckles]
Let me have my fun!

43
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,875
You know, I am aware that
you've hidden your angel blood

44
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:07,333
inside the girl.

45
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:10,083
What were you hoping to
accomplish with such a plan?

46
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,083
Surely you didn't think you
could sneak your way back

47
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,375
into heaven with
some cheap trick?

48
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:15,958
At any rate...

49
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:17,291
[snaps]

50
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:26,833
[gasps]
Maria!

51
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:29,333
[BELIAL] Goodness, no need
to get in such a tizzy.

52
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:30,833
She's only sleeping.

53
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:32,875
Though, provided I
don't wake her myself,

54
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:37,083
she'll stay that way for all
of eternity. Ha, ha, ha...

55
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:39,416
[LUCIFER]
I'm going to strangle you.

56
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,375
The angel's blood is far better
off in my hands, anyway.

57
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:45,375
I have the means to put
it to use, after all.

58
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:48,625
That is to say, I'll be the
one returning to Heaven.

59
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,958
Oh? And then what?

60
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,333
They won't treat a demon
with half of the mercy that

61
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:55,083
you're showing me.

62
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:58,041
[BELIAL] You don't remember
me at all, do you?

63
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:00,000
I was the angel, Satanael!

64
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:02,791
[LUCIFER]
Sorry. Not ringing any bells.

65
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:08,000
I see. Your arrogance has once
again rendered you blind.

66
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:11,416
But I will never forget
your prideful accusations

67
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,458
that robbed me
of my divinity.

68
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:17,166
I-I'm afraid that
I don't understand.

69
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,833
[LUCIFER]
You're being kicked out.

70
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:22,250
[BELIAL] But why? After all
the work that I've done!

71
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:25,208
[LUCIFER] It's simple.
You spread lies to humanity,

72
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,541
selling them on promises
of false miracles.

73
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:30,583
[BELIAL] The only thing I
spread was the love of God!

74
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:33,666
True or not, if humans believe,
isn't that enough?

75
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,750
You really don't
get it, do you?

76
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,833
[BELIAL] I performed
my duty as an angel!

77
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:40,333
I've heard enough of this.

78
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:43,625
[BELIAL gasps]
Please, wait! Michael!

79
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:48,000
Surely you don't agree with her!
I only sought glory for God!

80
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:50,416
This is all a terrible mistake!

81
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,041
You'll blame anyone
but yourself, won't you?

82
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:56,208
You can take your
complaints to Hell.

83
00:05:56,291 --> 00:06:00,041
[BELIAL gasps, screams]

84
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:02,541
My judgement is never mistaken.

85
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:05,500
[BELIAL]
Lucifer! Mark my words!

86
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:12,916
Someday, no matter what
it takes, I will make you pay!

87
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,500
The humiliation I suffered has
haunted me every last moment,

88
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:17,875
until this day.

89
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,458
Isn't that sad!

90
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:22,541
I'd already forgotten about you
as soon as you left my sight.

91
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:25,541
[BELIAL gasps ]
On second thought,

92
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:28,166
burning you to death
seems like a waste.

93
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,750
In fact, I think I'll
keep you around a bit.

94
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:34,625
for an eternity of torment,
to be specific.

95
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:35,916
[LUCIFER gasps]

96
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,833
[LUCIFER groans]

97
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:45,208
[BELIAL laughs]
If you want to cry and beg,

98
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:48,666
I won't complain. I wont
forgive you either, though!

99
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,041
[LUCIFER]
How pathetic do you think I am?

100
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:54,166
Pathetic? Hah, that reminds me!

101
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,291
Maybe I do remember
you after all!

102
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:59,666
I seem to recall an angel that
wanted to suck up to God so bad,

103
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:04,000
she'd feed any old lie to humans
just to get their attention.

104
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,666
She preyed on their desires
and snatched up followers

105
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,708
just like a Demon Lord.

106
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:13,250
[BELIAL] It's an angel's
duty to gather followers!

107
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,333
I did it all in the name of God!

108
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:18,333
And I was better at it than
any of the Seven Virtues!

109
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:20,000
I should have been the leader!

110
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:23,125
You didn't possess a
fraction of my devotion!

111
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:26,375
[BELIAL gasps] That's why you
sent me here, isn't it?

112
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:27,875
Jealousy!

113
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:30,291
You condemned me to Hell because
I was more loyal than you.

114
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:33,333
Because I saved more humans
than you, or anyone else!

115
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:35,000
Your lies ruined them!

116
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:38,416
[gasps]
What, pray tell, does that mean?

117
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,708
[LUCIFER grunts]

118
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:43,625
[LUCIFER] The humans you guided
became dependent on miracles.

119
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,666
They looked to God
for the wrong things.

120
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,541
They prayed for miracles
that would never happen!

121
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:51,000
And when God didn't
show up, for good reason,

122
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,541
they found their
pleasure in sin instead!

123
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:57,250
If it weren't for your vanity,
you would have seen the truth.

124
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:59,625
You diminished humanity.

125
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:02,875
You turned them away from
God for your own glory.

126
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,583
That's why you belong here.

127
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,833
You were always
like a Demon Lord.

128
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:10,833
Honestly, you should
be thanking me.

129
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:13,958
You seem to be doing well
down here with your kind.

130
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:16,083
[BELIAL growls]

131
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:17,208
[BELIAL]
Silence!

132
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:20,208
[gasps]

133
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,833
[BELIAL] Do you have
any idea how much I've

134
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:24,416
suffered down here?
What it took to survive?

135
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,500
I was forced to make company
with those vile Demon Lords!

136
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:29,583
My pride as an
angel was destroyed!

137
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:32,000
But at long last,
I've clawed my way back up.

138
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:34,208
And we're about to see a
miracle that will make all my

139
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:35,791
suffering worthwhile.

140
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:40,125
[grunts] A miracle, huh?
You must have made a deal.

141
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:44,208
I'm not obligated to
tell you anything.

142
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,583
That's fine. I think
I figured it out.

143
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:49,708
The angels. You're handing
Hell over to them.

144
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:51,291
[BELIAL]
Hell will be meaningless.

145
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:55,833
Even Earth won't matter anymore!
This will be the new age of God!

146
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:56,958
And to be quite frank,

147
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,458
they couldn't have
done it without me!

148
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:02,958
That is why I'll be returning
to my rightful place in Heaven

149
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:05,125
as the angel Satanael!

150
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:09,458
So, if you want the Seven
Mortal Sins, you can have them!

151
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:12,625
I think I'll take you
up on that offer.

152
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,125
Perfect timing.

153
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:18,375
[LUCIFER laughs] You ran
your mouth just enough.

154
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,500
[laughing continues]

155
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,208
I fail to see the humor here.

156
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:24,583
[LUCIFER] You just lost and
you don't even know it!

157
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:25,791
[BELIAL]
Uh?

158
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,375
[LUCIFER] You really
are slow, aren't you?

159
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:30,083
You never had a place in Heaven,
and now you've lost your place

160
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:32,375
in Hell because you couldn't
keep your mouth shut.

161
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:36,583
[ASMO screams]

162
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:38,750
[LUCIFER] The only reason your
former subordinates were

163
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:41,416
forced to endure torture,
is because you held power

164
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,125
over them as the leader
of the Mortal Sins.

165
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,208
[BEELZE gags]

166
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:51,166
[screams]

167
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,916
[BELPHE pants]

168
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:11,791
[BEELZE]
Mm!

169
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,750
[LUCIFER]
The Sins are strong.

170
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:16,166
Even if you do wield
more magic than them,

171
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,291
it was surely vanity that
made you think you could

172
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,416
defeat them all so easily.

173
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:24,375
[LUCIFER] It was a contract
that held them in check.

174
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:28,333
Your power as leader
that made them bow.

175
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,166
[BELPHE sighs]

176
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,583
[LUCIFER] And now
that you've willingly

177
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:34,916
relinquished that power,
you must know what's happening.

178
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,791
You can feel it, can't you?

179
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:39,958
The commandments that held
them are being released,

180
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,666
one after another.

181
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:45,416
I bet they'll be right here on
your doorstep, any second now.

182
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,541
[BELIAL gasps]

183
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:56,916
[LUCIFER]
I've been waiting.

184
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:02,625
Uh... Hello, girls.

185
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:04,208
You Filthy traitor!

186
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:06,458
So you're a fancy-pants
fallen angel?

187
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,166
I always knew you were a
two-faced little harpy.

188
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,666
You're a meanie!

189
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,458
More than that, selling off the
underworld is a deplorable

190
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:14,916
business decision.

191
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,208
We've had enough, Belial.
You might as well surrender!

192
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:22,041
[BELIAL chuckles]
"Surrender"?

193
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,583
You certainly think
highly of yourself!

194
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:25,833
[SATAN grunts]

195
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,500
[BELIAL] My commandments
may have been dispelled,

196
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:29,708
but I'm far from helpless.

197
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:32,250
Perhaps you failed to
notice that I have absorbed

198
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,791
all of Lucifer's power!

199
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:37,291
[BELIAL grunts]

200
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:41,958
Oh! It's so big! I can
feel it filling me up!

201
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:44,125
I'm going to overflow!

202
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:49,166
[moans]

203
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,416
Goodness me!

204
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,333
I never knew stealing power
could be such a turn-on!

205
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:59,125
I can feel you
inside me, Lucifer.

206
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,500
You really know how
to treat a lady!

207
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,750
I think it's about time
we settle our debts.

208
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,958
We've come prepared for war!

209
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:11,250
You'll have it! I shall be
happy to face you all at once!

210
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,333
[ASMO]
Pheromone Wind!

211
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:15,416
[MAMMON shouts]

212
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,333
[BELPHE grunts]

213
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:18,250
[BEELZE grunts]

214
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:21,416
[SATAN yells]
You shall fall!

215
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:25,416
[BELIAL]
Punish my enemies. Dáinsleif!

216
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:29,083
[SATAN, BEELZE gasp]

217
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,916
[MAMMON]
That's quite impressive!

218
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:35,125
[ALL shout]

219
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:43,166
[BELIAL laughs]
Pardon my coarseness,

220
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,458
but I do believe I
just came a little!

221
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:49,000
Limitless heavenly power
really does it for me!

222
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:51,291
You had the right idea, Lucifer.

223
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:53,041
[LUCIFER]
It's Maria's blood.

224
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:57,041
[BELIAL] Indeed! I had Dáinsleif
suck up every last drop.

225
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:58,791
And it was a wonderful gift.

226
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:02,291
Normally, an angel's blood is
deadly poison to a Demon Lord.

227
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:05,500
But if you run it through a
human first that changes things.

228
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:09,125
Now at long last, I've taken
my rightful power back.

229
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:12,041
This has given me a
lovely idea! That is to say,

230
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,708
I have concocted an even
crueler means of destroying you.

231
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:26,166
[MARIA gasps]

232
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,041
[MARIA]
L-Lucifer?

233
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,666
[LUCIFER]
I'm here, Maria.

234
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,833
The time has come.

235
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:33,416
Your nightmare will
end at last, Maria.

236
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,625
[MARIA]
Huh?

237
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,708
[BELIAL]
Simply take this silver stake,

238
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:40,000
and use it to pierce
Lucifer's heart.

239
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:42,375
[gasps]
But I could never do that!

240
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:44,333
Of course you can!

241
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,000
You must seize the
reins of destiny

242
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:49,625
and take your heart back.

243
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:53,916
This is your final chance to
return to a life on Earth!

244
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,791
Think of it as
a gift, from me.

245
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,666
[LUCIFER grunts]

246
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:02,000
[LEVI grunts]

247
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:06,541
Could you hurry up?
I'm freezing here!

248
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:10,291
The ice in Cocytus
can't be broken.

249
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:11,833
You should know that.

250
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,958
[LEVI]
But I got places to be!

251
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:15,333
Specifically, with Lucifer,

252
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:18,041
who I bet is in a whole
bunch of trouble right now!

253
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,375
[ASTA] I have a bad
feeling about this, too.

254
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,833
[LEVI]
Right? So help me!

255
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:26,875
I might have a good idea.
We'll use my guitar.

256
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,083
[LEVI]
Huh?

257
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,666
[ASTA]
If it creates a vibration,

258
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,625
it can shatter the ice. Maybe.

259
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:35,875
[LEVI] Um, okay,
but who's gonna play it?

260
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,083
[ASTA]
He will.

261
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,416
[LEVI]
Behemoth?

262
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,583
Here. Now drive it
deep into her chest.

263
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:44,875
[MARIA grunts]

264
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:48,708
You let her go!
This is our fight!

265
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:52,208
[BELIAL laughs]
I already won!

266
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:55,083
You've lost your power and
you're riddled with holes!

267
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:55,750
[laughs]

268
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:56,416
[MARIA screams]

269
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,333
Maria!

270
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:00,250
You're both under the
mistaken assumption

271
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:04,500
that you have any choice in
the matter. Now, play along.

272
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:07,166
[screams]

273
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,750
No. Don't make me!

274
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,541
[screams]

275
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:14,833
[BELIAL]
Stop making this difficult.

276
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:17,250
Don't worry about me, Maria!

277
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,791
You don't have to suffer.
Drive the stake into my heart!

278
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:22,791
[MARIA]
You asking me to kill you?

279
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:25,541
You know I could never do
something like that, Lucifer!

280
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:26,541
[LUCIFER]
Just do it!

281
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:29,833
[BELIAL laughs]

282
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:31,291
How touching.

283
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:34,208
It seems you have a bit of
angel left in you after all!

284
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:38,833
Sacrificing yourself
for a human, so noble!

285
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:43,500
B-But I... I don't want
it to end this way!

286
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,791
Then you're going
to disobey me?

287
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:48,708
[MARIA] Don't say that!
I don't understand.

288
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:51,041
This isn't like you, Lucifer!

289
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:52,875
I'll be honest with you.

290
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:56,583
I really do feel bad about
what I did. Believe me.

291
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,875
[LUCIFER]
I got you wrapped in all this.

292
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:02,083
And look how it turned out.

293
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:05,583
At least you can set things
straight now, and be free again.

294
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:11,083
[MARIA gasps]
Lucifer, I can't.

295
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,666
[LUCIFER]
Just freakin' stab me already!

296
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,916
If you won't run that
damn thing into my chest,

297
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
then I'll do it myself!

298
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:19,291
[MARIA gasps]

299
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:26,916
There you go... Good Girl.

300
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,166
[MARIA gasps]

301
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:39,833
[MARIA]
I stabbed her... I killed her!

302
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:44,458
[MARIA gasps]
Lucifer!

303
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:46,583
[gasps]
Oh, no.

304
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:47,916
What the hell?

305
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,458
How terrible.

306
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:52,541
[BELIAL chuckles]

307
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:57,416
My! What a tragedy. For everyone
but me, that is! Ha, ha!

308
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,666
Hm?

309
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,666
[MARIA gasps]

310
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:09,375
[MARIA shouts]

311
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:12,833
[BELIAL gasps]

312
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:17,291
She... She took the heart?!

313
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:29,458
You're... still alive?
What is this?

314
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:30,958
[LUCIFER sighs]

315
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,791
[chuckles]
Sucks to be you right now.

316
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:40,125
You mean that you switched
hearts in preparation

317
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:44,375
for this exactly? You couldn't
have foreseen my plan!

318
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,500
[LUCIFER]
Maybe, maybe not.

319
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:49,375
I know my acting was a
little melodramatic but,

320
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:51,083
when you're dealing
with someone as lowdown

321
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:54,000
and dirty as you, a girl's
gotta go the extra mile.

322
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,500
[BELIAL growls]

323
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:59,666
Jeez, Maria. You really had
me worried for a second. Ha!

324
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,750
I-I didn't know you--

325
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,958
[gasps]

326
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,375
It's shining so bright.

327
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:09,000
[LUCIFER] I gave you
my heart, Maria. Literally.

328
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:12,041
Treat it well, or you'll
make me sad.

329
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,666
[MARIA gasps]

330
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:18,916
You're mean. I can't believe
you put me through that.

331
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,416
[MARIA] I really thought
I killed you back there.

332
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,791
But... we did it!

333
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:29,291
[BELIAL grunts]
Curse you! Both of you!

334
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:41,125
[LUCIFER chuckles]
Kicking your ass is fun.

335
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:42,916
You want another round?

336
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,375
You bet I do!
Now, we'll settle this!

337
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:51,791
I'll pay you back for
every last insult!

338
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:55,291
I've never once
forgotten who I am!

339
00:18:55,375 --> 00:19:00,125
My name is Satanael,
the first angel created by God!

340
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:03,083
You have condemned me to Hell
with your baseless accusations,

341
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,958
and for that, you will die!

342
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:08,458
[LUCIFER grunts]

343
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,458
[LUCIFER] See, this is
why nobody likes you.

344
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:13,291
It's been ages and you're still
letting this run your life!

345
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:15,500
Get over it already!

346
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,666
Shut up and die!

347
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:21,708
[LUCIFER, BELIAL grunting]

348
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:26,916
Here's a little
secret that might

349
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,541
put things in to perspective.

350
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,416
I wasn't the one who sent you
to Hell in the first place.

351
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,291
God did.

352
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:34,208
[gasps]

353
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,958
[LUCIFER] Actually, I guess this
knowledge was a little above

354
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,458
your pay grade.

355
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:41,625
Only God has the ultimate
authority to condemn an angel.

356
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:44,416
Everything I did back
then was in His name.

357
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,083
Exactly the same as you.

358
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:48,750
[gasps]
You're lying to me!

359
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,583
[LUCIFER]
Don't you have any pride?

360
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:53,000
You go on and on about
how you were wronged,

361
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:56,833
but you still suck up to God,
even from down here in Hell.

362
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:59,250
Come on. Instead of
begging for scraps,

363
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:02,791
why don't you try starting
a rebellion like me?

364
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:05,333
[BELIAL]
You damned apostate!

365
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:07,916
[LUCIFER] I'd rather be a
heathen than a dog.

366
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,500
And I'd rather be dead than
bend over backwards

367
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:13,208
for another one of
God's ridiculous whims.

368
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:16,666
If it's death you want,
then I'll grant your wish!

369
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:20,166
[LUCIFER grunts]

370
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,333
[gasps]

371
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:22,916
This isn't like the
last time we fought.

372
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,333
Your weak attacks won't
work on me anymore!

373
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,000
[LUCIFER, BELIAL grunt]

374
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:31,500
[BELIAL gasps]

375
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:33,916
Your sword sure
likes to break, huh?

376
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,916
Dumpsleif, or whatever
the hell you call it.

377
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,458
[BELIAL grunts]
How dare you.

378
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:42,166
It was enough trouble the
first time I had to fix it!

379
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,875
I'm wrapping this up.

380
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:50,791
[BELIAL screams]

381
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:55,833
[gasps]
Seems their duel has ended.

382
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:00,250
Wow, she lost bad.

383
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:03,625
It feels good to be on
the winning side for once.

384
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:05,583
And now that Belial
has renounced us,

385
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:08,041
Lucifer can be our new leader.

386
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:09,500
[BEELZE whimpers]

387
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:16,791
[LEVI] There you are!
I knew you'd pull through!

388
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,541
You're just awesome
like that, after all.

389
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:22,583
[ASTA gasps]
You okay, Belial?

390
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,541
Seems I've lost this
one for good, huh?

391
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:27,875
[LUCIFER]
Wow.

392
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:29,875
I thought you'd die before
you admitted that one.

393
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:31,375
Though I'm glad
you stuck around,

394
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:34,375
because now I get to subject
you to eternal torment.

395
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:36,125
[LUCIFER chuckles]

396
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:37,750
[LUCIFER] I'm new to
this Demon Lord thing,

397
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,166
so I'd better try my best.

398
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,208
You seem to have done
pretty well for yourself

399
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:46,083
down here in Hell, so I'll
banish you Earth this time.

400
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:48,541
I hate you so much.

401
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:50,208
[BELIAL, MARIA gasp]

402
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:52,458
That doesn't sound good.

403
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,375
If I had known it
would end like this,

404
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:57,875
I would have spent more
time taunting you.

405
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:03,541
[MAMMON]
Oh, dear.

406
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:05,750
[BELIAL]
The appointed time has arrived!

407
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:07,083
[SATAN]
The what?

408
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,416
[LUCIFER gasps]

409
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:22,625
[SATAN]
It's... an angel!

410
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,041
Hello, Michael!
