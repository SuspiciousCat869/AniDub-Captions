1
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:48,708
[MARIA]
It's an angel.

2
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:50,000
[LUCIFER grunts]

3
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:53,875
[BELIAL laughs]

4
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:57,958
Well, it looks like
I win in the end.

5
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:02,250
Heaven. I'm comin' home at last!

6
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:07,291
[BELIAL continues laughing]

7
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:11,916
You traitor, you!

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,208
Belial. How could you do this?

9
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:16,541
[BELIAL continues laughing]

10
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:20,541
[MICHAEL]
It's been a while, Lucifer.

11
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:22,000
[LUCIFER]
Michael.

12
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:24,291
At long last,
you're finally here.

13
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,583
Welcome, Michael!

14
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:28,041
Who are you, pray tell?

15
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:32,000
I am Satanael, the angel.
Do you not recognize me?

16
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:35,333
[MICHAEL] Belial, the Demon
Lord of Vanity.

17
00:01:35,416 --> 00:01:37,875
[gasps]
As I promised I would,

18
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:40,458
I will surrender Hell
to your control.

19
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:41,458
--Damn you!

20
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:43,166
--Please be careful!
--Damn you!

21
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:46,583
[BELIAL] Too long I have lived
in the fiery pits of Hell.

22
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:48,625
Now, I will return
to God's side,

23
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:50,750
where I've always belonged!

24
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:54,250
[MICHAEL] God does not make
deals with Demon Lords.

25
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:56,708
It's good that you
wish to do right by God.

26
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:59,666
Obeying is the solemn
duty of righteous creatures.

27
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:03,291
But one must not
expect remuneration.

28
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:05,958
All they had to do was tell you
they'd let you return to Heaven

29
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:08,708
if you helped with a coup,
and you joined right in.

30
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:11,333
I bet you didn't
even need convincing.

31
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:13,041
Belial, you're way too easy.

32
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:16,416
Anyone can see
right through you.

33
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,875
Did you seriously believe
God was planning to pardon

34
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:21,125
all your past
transgressions?

35
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,541
Please. I wouldn't be
surprised if God didn't know

36
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:27,208
about it in the first place.
They played you like a fiddle!

37
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,666
No, that can't be.

38
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,250
[ASTA]
Are you all right, Belial?

39
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,083
I think it's time to
end this bullshit.

40
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:36,375
What do you think Arch Angel?

41
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,541
[MICHAEL]
Loyalty.

42
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:49,916
[LUCIFER]
Hm! Well, well.

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,333
[MICHAEL] The Holy Light Wings.
The proof of credence and truth

44
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:55,208
granted by God to
the true leader of the

45
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:57,416
Seven Lively Virtues.

46
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,750
You lost these when you decided
to turn away from God.

47
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:14,500
[ANGELS shout]

48
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,791
[MICHAEL grunts]

49
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,166
[LUCIFER grunts]

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,958
[LUCIFER screams]

51
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,875
[MICHAEL]
Lucifer! You can still repent!

52
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,416
Turn yourself towards the light!

53
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,666
[LUCIFER]
Apologize? Whatever.

54
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,875
If you think I'll give up,
then you don't know me!

55
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:36,250
Lucifer, please!

56
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,666
[LUCIFER]
I've said what I have to say!

57
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,541
I'm not changing my mind!

58
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:40,791
[gasps]

59
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:48,083
[LUCIFER gasps, screams]

60
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:53,166
[MICHAEL]
I wanted to save you, Lucifer.

61
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,750
[LUCIFER] Is that a fact?
The way I remember it,

62
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:58,500
when it counted, you weren't
there for me at all, Michael.

63
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:01,166
You knew about God's errors,
didn't you?

64
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,625
Lucifer. I'm a loyal angel.

65
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:07,083
So you're going to accept God's
mistakes and do nothing?

66
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,416
God does not err.

67
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,625
[MARIA shouts]

68
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:18,083
Don't tell me you've abandoned
reason and logic entirely!

69
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,125
Hear me now. By order
of our omnipotent Lord,

70
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:31,666
I will now purge Hell of its
iniquities once and for all!

71
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,375
We will make a sacrifice
for the new world order.

72
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:40,416
[ALL gasp, shout]

73
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:44,541
[BELIAL]
Michael!

74
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:45,625
[gasps]

75
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,000
[BELIAL shouts]

76
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,958
[ASMO]
This is bad.

77
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,875
At this rate, I'm worried
Hell won't survive.

78
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:11,458
[MAMMON] We're gonna have to
take out Michael, and fast!

79
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,583
[BEELZE]
Alright. Let's fight!

80
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,625
I'm getting excited now!

81
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:19,041
[BELPHE]
I'm not, not even a little bit,

82
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,708
but I'll do my best to
keep a positive attitude.

83
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:26,750
[LUCIFER] Not so fast.
We can't underestimate Michael!

84
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:29,125
She is a worthy opponent.
Each "feather" of the

85
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,875
Light Wings has enough
vigor to rival the powers of all

86
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:33,833
Seven Lively Virtues combined!

87
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,541
[MAMMON gasps]
Yes, you're right.

88
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:37,916
Which means first things first:

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,333
we've got to do something
about those wings.

90
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:43,291
Gnosis. Now!

91
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:49,875
[GNOSIS growls]

92
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:52,708
By the honor of the
noble Byrnedale Family,

93
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:55,125
taste my vengeance.

94
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:58,666
[GNOSIS]
As you wish. Let it begin!

95
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,000
[BELIAL shouts]

96
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,250
[BELIAL]
I will have justice!

97
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:19,750
[BELIAL]
Michael!

98
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:22,041
[MICHAEL] There is
nothing more left to say.

99
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,708
[MICHAEL]
Hm!

100
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,458
The Byrndale House
is so famous,

101
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,916
there's no soul in Hell that
doesn't know its name.

102
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,250
As a daughter of that
illustrious house,

103
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:37,125
I am the most beautiful.
The most lovely by far!

104
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:38,333
[MICHAEL chuckles]

105
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:43,083
[BELIAL]
Hear me now, Angel! Mark me!

106
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:49,458
I am the Demon Lord Belial!
Michael, prepare yourself!

107
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:50,875
[MICHAEL shouts]

108
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:56,416
[BELIAL grunts]
Your proud wings of light.

109
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,000
At least I'll fall back
to Earth with one in hand.

110
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:01,375
[MICHAEL gasps]

111
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:09,583
[SATAN]
Lord Belial! Excellent work!

112
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,458
I guess it's true.
Anything's possible!

113
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:17,416
[ASMO gasps] Watching them
go to town made me all wet!

114
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,416
Just what I'd expect
from our former leader.

115
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,166
[BEELZE]
Mm-hm.

116
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,083
[BELIAL gasps]

117
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:28,000
[gasps]
What is it, Astaroth?

118
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:32,541
Darling, Belial. I'll follow
you anywhere you go!

119
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:34,333
Do as you wish, then.

120
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,833
[MARIA]
What is this?

121
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,333
Oh, wow.

122
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:49,166
It's over there, too!

123
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,958
Is that a statue?

124
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:58,125
[gasps]
O-O-Of me?

125
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,958
I think it's about time I
introduce the new leadership!

126
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,500
[LUCIFER] The Demon Lord
of Envy. Leviathan!

127
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:17,708
And the top dog? The Head of
the Seven Sins? Yours truly.

128
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:21,333
The great Demon Lord
of Pride. Lucifer!

129
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,000
[SATAN grunts]

130
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:32,625
Alright, Sins, let's do this.
Come at me and see how you fare.

131
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,166
[MAMMON grunts]
She's strong.

132
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,291
[ASMO] That's true.
But then again, so are we!

133
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,500
[BEELZE] Come on, everyone!
Keep fighting!

134
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,625
[SATAN]
Lord Belial showed us the way!

135
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,708
We just have to follow her lead!

136
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:47,000
[MICHAEL] I'll expel that fiery
passion of yours, Wrath!

137
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:54,250
[shouts] Oh, come on.
If you wanna take me down,

138
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:57,166
then you're gonna have
to do better than that!

139
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:02,791
Blade of Wrath! Howl for me!
Execution Purgatory Slice!

140
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:03,666
What?

141
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,916
[gasps]

142
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:09,916
[MICHAEL shouts]

143
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,208
Heh. Do you feel my rage?
Do you understand now?

144
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,000
[MICHAEL grunts]

145
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,958
[BELPHE] You're the final boss,
it's only standard that

146
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:22,208
everybody work together
to take you down.

147
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:24,958
[MICHAEL gasps]
Don't touch me!

148
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:28,541
[BELPHE giggles]

149
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:37,416
[BELPHE] Well, talk about
getting burned, huh?

150
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,416
[MICHAEL gasps]

151
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,625
[ASMO chuckles] Since you love
those light wings so much,

152
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,875
how about I pluck them
off of you one by one?

153
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:48,875
[MICHAEL gasps]
No! Stop it! Please don't!

154
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,166
[BEELZE]
It's time to eat.

155
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:50,791
[MICHAEL gasps]

156
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,416

[MICHAEL groans]

159
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:01,291
[ASMO gasps] I love those noises
you're making right now!

160
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,375
[gasps]
It's really hot!

161
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:08,041
[moans] You sure know how
to push my buttons!

162
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:12,625
[MICHAEL gasps]
Damn you all!

163
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,083
[ASMO shouts]

164
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:20,541
[BEELZE grunts]

165
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:26,083
[sighs] Taking this path
won't profit you one bit,

166
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:29,583
Demon Lord of Greed.
Why not walk away?

167
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:34,000
Well that depends on your
definition of profit, Angel.

168
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:37,458
Be eaten by darkness.
Return to dust.

169
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:38,583
[MAMMON gasps]

170
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:40,750
I'd rather not.

171
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,833
[MAMMON shouts]

172
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:45,500
What is this?!

173
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:47,125
[gasps]

174
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,458
[MICHAEL grunts]

175
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:50,958
Oh, no!

176
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,333
[MICHAEL gasps] My wings!
They're rotting away!

177
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,291
This can't be happening!

178
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:08,125
I'm done. I guess it's up to
you now. Finish it, Lucifer.

179
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:11,666
[LUCIFER] So? What do you think
of the power of the Deadly Sins?

180
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:15,000
You did well, but if you
really wanna win the day?

181
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:18,458
You'll have to beat me first!

182
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:21,000
Fine then. Let's dance.

183
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,291
Huh?

184
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:25,541
[MICHAEL]
Follow me!

185
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:26,750
[LUCIFER]
Wait!

186
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,291
[MICHAEL]
Lucifer, let's fight here,

187
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:44,458
with the whole
world on the line!

188
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:48,083
[LUCIFER scoffs] Fine by me.
Come and get me, Michael!

189
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:52,125
[LUCIFER, MICHAEL shout]

190
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:58,583
Look, they're right there!

191
00:11:58,666 --> 00:11:59,958
[MARIA]
It's begun.

192
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:05,333
I'm overjoyed. You never fought
me head on, did you know that?

193
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:07,375
[LUCIFER, MICHAEL shout]

194
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:09,041
Yes, I did. Plenty of times!

195
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,125
You weren't serious back then.

196
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:12,958
[LUCIFER grunts]

197
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:14,416
It wasn't like this!

198
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,750
You never took me seriously,
not like I wanted you to!

199
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,708
What are you, stupid?

200
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:22,583
[MICHAEL] When you were sent
down, I thought of it like God

201
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:25,458
giving me one more chance
to prove my true worth.

202
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:28,583
Now that you mention it,
you were smiling, weren't you?

203
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,791
[MICHAEL] This time,
you'll take me seriously.

204
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,125
[LUCIFER, MICHAEL grunt]

205
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:39,500
[LEVI] Wait a second.
I think Michael likes her.

206
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:40,791
[MARIA]
Mm?

207
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:44,791
[LEVI] For a loyal angel,
God is everything.

208
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:47,833
That's why she's gone
weird like this.

209
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:51,791
[MICHAEL] Lucifer.
I'm happy. I feel great.

210
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:55,333
Cause at long last,
I'm fighting with you!

211
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:57,791
[LUCIFER] I feel great, too!
Because after I cut ties

212
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:01,416
with you, Angels, I saw what
real friendship looks like!

213
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,125
You lie!

214
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,208
[LUCIFER] Demon Lords who
say what they think and feel

215
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:06,666
are honest at least!

216
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:10,125
Unlike your kind, who will
say anything to please God!

217
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:14,750
[MICHAEL]
Hmph.

218
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,458
In the face of this tyranny,
you do as you're told!

219
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:19,333
You're just a fraud!

220
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,291
[MICHAEL] The foolish and
disgraceful humans will find

221
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:26,625
themselves in Hell
where they belong.

222
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:30,583
We will return everything to its
original chaos, and recreate the

223
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:33,458
Earth and Heavens
with a new world order.

224
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:36,041
This is God's will. Amen.

225
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:39,708
Are you fucking kidding me?
You created human kind.

226
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,000
Now you're just
going to sit back

227
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,458
and watch while
they're demolished?

228
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,583
And why, because they
won't behave?

229
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:48,208
You made this world!
Don't turn your back on it now!

230
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,083
My grace has reached its limits.

231
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:55,125
This is what God
has spoken, Lucifer.

232
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:58,291
[LUCIFER] Then stop obeying
and follow your own desires!

233
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:06,333
Oh, wow. I didn't realize.
I didn't know Lucifer

234
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:09,541
was the only one trying
to protect the human race.

235
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:14,125
[MARIA'S MOTHER]
Maria. Don't forget.

236
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:18,291
This angel is always watching
over us, no matter what happens.

237
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:22,083
Come what may, my darling.
She'll always be on our side.

238
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,875
What's that angels name?

239
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:26,083
Please tell me mama,
I want to know.

240
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,750
[MARIA'S MOTHER]
I'd be glad to.

241
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,666
[cars smashing]

242
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,416

[LUCIFER gasps]

247
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:55,291
This Holy Lance of Longinus was
made to destroy demon lords,

248
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:59,291
like you. Bye, Lucifer.
This is the end.

249
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:04,333
[LUCIFER groans]

[MARIA gasps]

254
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:22,083
[MARIA]
What's that Angel's name?

255
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,291
Please tell me, Mama,
I want to know!

256
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,083
[MARIA'S MOTHER]
I'd be glad to.

257
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:32,166
Lucifer!

258
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:36,791
If you hadn't turned
your back on God,

259
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:39,583
then we could've been together.

260
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:41,458
[LEVI]
Lucifer!

261
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:46,666
[MARIA] Demon lords can't die,
can they? Lucifer!

262
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,333
[MICHAEL]
Goodbye, Lucifer.

263
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:59,666
[LEVI, MARIA sob]

264
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,875
[MARIA] What do I need
to do for a Demon Lord

265
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:30,750
to hear my prayers, Levi?

266
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:34,583
[LEVI gasps]
Well, let's see.

267
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:37,625
You could make a
sacrifice for her, but...

268
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:40,583
[MARIA gasps]
In that case.

269
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:45,541
Demon Lord Lucifer,
I will sacrifice myself.

270
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,791
If only you will
come back to me.

271
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,291
That won't work.

272
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,750
You were always so
sure of yourself.

273
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:54,500
So arrogant, and over-confident.

274
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:58,250
But you can't even grant
me one single solitary wish?

275
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:01,083
You call yourself
a Demon Lord?!

276
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,625
[MARIA] Then come
back to life, Lucifer!

277
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:12,666
Please come back. Don't leave
me here alone like this.

278
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,666
Come back to me right now!

279
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:19,916
Maria?

280
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,416
[LUCIFER]
You know,

281
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,375
I think there's something
wrong with you.

282
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:42,041
I can't believe you offered
yourself as a sacrifice.

283
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:45,250
[MARIA] I can't explain it but,
I always had a feeling things

284
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:49,125
would turn out this way.
I guess I was enchanted by you.

285
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:52,583
Relax. I'm okay with this.

286
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,958
[LUCIFER gasps]

287
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:14,083
[LEVI]
Lucifer! Don't go!

288
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:17,791
[LUCIFER] Maria. I was
the one enchanted by you.

289
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:21,875
I've been watching you.
Ever since I was in Heaven.

290
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:23,375
You've always prayed to me.

291
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:25,458
During the good
times and the bad.

292
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:28,208
You'd always tell me what's
going on in your life.

293
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,541
And even though you talked
a little too much about

294
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:33,541
insignificant things,
I didn't mind terribly.

295
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:37,458
All I know is, I didn't want to
destroy the world you live in.

296
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:40,916
[LUCIFER] Maria. I swear to you,
I will use every ounce

297
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,083
of my power to put a
stop to this injustice!

298
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:49,125
[MICHAEL] Lucifer?
What did that fool human do?

299
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,750
Did she sacrifice her
own life for yours?

300
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:55,166
Yes, she did! Don't ever
look down on another human

301
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:58,333
just because you think
they're stupid, you hear me?

302
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:01,125
[LUCIFER] If the leader
comes back to life,

303
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:04,208
then so do the rest of
the Seven Mortal Sins.

304
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:07,416
Remember? That's how
Demon Lords work.

305
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,083
Take this!

306
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,375
[LUCIFER] That lance may
have been created to destroy

307
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:24,250
demon lords, but...
Maria sacrificed herself

308
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:28,958
to bring me back to
life again. So now?

309
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:31,041
It won't work on me!

310
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,333
[MICHAEL gasps]
What's this?

311
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:35,583
This isn't the
Lucifer that I know!

312
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:36,541
Who are you?

313
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,208
[LUCIFER shouts]

314
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,416
I am a fallen angel!

315
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,708
The leader of the
seven Mortal sins!

316
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,583
And I stand here before you,
blessed with another chance

317
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:51,333
at life through the gift
of the body of Maria!

318
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:54,791
[gasps] No, it can't be
a trinity! How's this possible?

319
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:58,958
She's absorbed all the power
from the other Deadly Sins!

320
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:02,041
[LUCIFER] It's what the humans
call a miracle, Michael.

321
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:04,666
After all, it's not like
God's the only one

322
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:09,500
that can make miracles happen.
I know Hell. I know Heaven.

323
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,833
They've both been my home!

324
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:16,583
And I want to overturn them.
So all can be free.

325
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:20,708
So that everything can
be as it was meant to be!

326
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:22,541
[BEELZE]
Tears of blood.

327
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:25,166
[MAMMON]
The sadness of Maria's death.

328
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,333
[SATAN]
Feelings of self-loathing.

329
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:30,041
[BELPHE]
And all forms of regret.

330
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,208
[ASMO]
That is what Lucy will destroy.

331
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:33,541
[LUCIFER]
This is her gift!

332
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:36,083
This is the miracle
Maria has created!

333
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:41,125
[MICHAEL gasps, screams]

334
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:46,166
Once again,
I've failed to succeed.

335
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:53,041
[grunts] So. Finish it.
Kill me. I want it to be you.

336
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:56,875
Prepare yourself.
It shall be so.

337
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:59,166
[MICHAEL sighs]

338
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,500
[gasps]

339
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:05,666
It's finished.

340
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:09,875
Michael. This time,
I will forgive your crimes.

341
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:15,333
You pity me? A terrible way
to say goodbye, Lucifer.

342
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:17,875
[LUCIFER gasps]

343
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:28,166
[LUCIFER]
The Seven Lively Virtues.

344
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,958
Get ready, because I'm
coming for you next!

345
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,666
Prepare yourselves for
a full on invasion!

346
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:44,791
[LEVI sobs]

347
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:47,583
I'm so torn up inside,
I honestly can't tell if I

348
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:50,750
should be happy you're back
or sad she's gone forever!

349
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:52,541
Maria...

350
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:56,333
[gasps]

351
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:01,333
[LEVI]
H-Huh? What's this?

352
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:02,916
[ALL}
Huh?

353
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:21,958
Maria, you're alive?

354
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:25,416
[MARIA gasps]

355
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,083
Where am I?

356
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:30,666
[gasps]

357
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:40,291
Oh, Lucifer. I saw
the entire thing.

358
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:41,083
Yeah?

359
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:42,625
[LEVI sobs]
Oh, Maria!

360
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:44,250
She's alive?

361
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:46,833
Maria's totally lucky Lucy
had some leftover angel blood

362
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:49,000
or she'd be pushing up daisies.

363
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:52,166
Do you really believe that's
how Maria came back to life?

364
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,208
Come on, Belph!
That's impossible!

365
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:56,791
[MAMMON] No, that's what
they'd call a miracle.

366
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,291
[SATAN]
One too many you ask me.

367
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:01,583
Well, at least it
was interesting.

368
00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:07,041
Now that you brought Maria
back, does that mean there's

369
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:09,125
no more angel blood flowing
through your veins, Lucy?

370
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:11,833
Look, as far as I'm concerned,
I'm done with the angel stuff.

371
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:13,500
But Lucifer?

372
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:21,833
[LUCIFER]
Ya know why?

373
00:23:21,916 --> 00:23:24,916
Well, I'll tell you.

374
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,541
'Cause I'm the best there is.

375
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:30,625
The leader of the
Seven Mortal Sins!

376
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:40,666
The Demon Lord
of Pride! Lucifer!

377
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:53,666
The Demon Lord
of Pride! Lucifer!

378
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:56,541
[ASTA] Oh, Belial.
It's time to eat.

379
00:23:58,125 --> 00:24:00,583
[ASTA] Also, do me
a favor, will ya?

380
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:03,041
Come to my street
concert tonight!
