1
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,500
[MICHAEL] How long
must you make me wait?

2
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:48,541
[MICHAEL] I was promised
the souls of the damned,

3
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:52,500
driven mad with corruption,
and I expect nothing less.

4
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:56,416
All in good time.
Surely you don't doubt me.

5
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,833
Now that I have seized
Lucifer's secret weapon,

6
00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:02,625
there's precious little
that can stand in my way.

7
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:06,000
Come, let us seal
our pact at last.

8
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:08,625
[MICHAEL] Is that what
you're calling it?

9
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:13,291
Just hurry up. We don't
have long to finish this.

10
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:55,625
[BELIAL] Wrath, I have tempered
my expectations when it comes to

11
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,208
your intelligence,

12
00:02:57,291 --> 00:03:02,083
but I had hoped you could at
least win a fight. For shame.

13
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:07,583
I have no regrets. I fought
with honor and lost fairly.

14
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,166
[BELIAL]
Hm.

15
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:11,333
[gasps]

16
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:16,166
[SATAN grunts]

17
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,541
[BELIAL]
What good is Honor?

18
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:22,666
I'm only interested in victory.

19
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,708
[SATAN screams]

20
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:28,583
[BELIAL] Am I to simply
pardon your failure?

21
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,000
I accept my defeat.
Do ask you will!

22
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:31,666
[BELIAL]
I shall!

23
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,000
[screams]

24
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:36,416
[BELIAL]
Lucifer's magic was weakened,

25
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,791
you should have finished her
instead of indulging in your

26
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,625
misguided sense of chivalry!

27
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:45,000
The Mortal Sins have allowed
themselves to become weak.

28
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,375
I am your leader.

29
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:47,583
[SATAN grunts]

30
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:49,208
[BELIAL] And yet all of you
choose to ignore

31
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:54,833
my expert guidance.
Tell me. Why is that?

32
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:57,500
Because you don't have faith
in anyone but yourself.

33
00:03:57,583 --> 00:04:00,166
We don't trust you! Wake up!

34
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,041
If you want loyalty,
you should try to inspire it!

35
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,625
It's not about you!

36
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:08,750
[screams]

37
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,375
[BELIAL]
In my infinite mercy,

38
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:14,708
I shall grant you one last
opportunity to redeem yourself.

39
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:18,583
Simply perform your duty and
protect the Gates of Hell.

40
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:23,583
Hah. Lucifer will come
knocking soon, I'm sure.

41
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,458
And should you allow
her to pass through,

42
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:28,500
the gates themselves
will be your judge.

43
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:31,791
Consumed by its indignation,
your agony will be immortalized

44
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:34,041
in living stone,
for all eternity.

45
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:36,291
Right next to Lucifer herself.

46
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:37,875
[BELIAL chuckles]

47
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:39,666
[SATAN]
So be it.

48
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:42,125
[SATAN gasps]

49
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,750
[LEVI] Hey, if you're
gonna rescue Maria,

50
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:52,333
shouldn't you hurry?

51
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:55,625
[LUCIFER chuckles]
Just one last thing.

52
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,208
[LEVI gasps]

53
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:05,750
[LEVI]
Okay, I got all my stuff.

54
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,166
[LUCIFER]
What "stuff"?

55
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,541
[LEVI] Souvenirs from Earth
I'm bringing with me!

56
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,541
[LUCIFER]
Throw that crap out.

57
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:12,750
What?!

58
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:22,083
[GATES OF HELL] Through me you
pass into the city of woe.

59
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:26,250
Through me you pass
into eternal pain.

60
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:31,875
Through me among the
people lost for aye.

61
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:38,916
Before me things create
were none, save things Eternal.

62
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,833
And Eternal, shall I endure.

63
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:46,708
All hope abandon
ye who enter here.

64
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:02,958
[SATAN gasps]

65
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:10,541
[SATAN] I will honor my promise.
Hear me, Gates of Hell! Open!

66
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,458
I've given my command. Now obey!

67
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:26,541
[SOULS OF THE DAMNED groan]

68
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:38,375
[SATAN]
You will not defy me!

69
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:44,875
[MARIA shouts]

70
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:47,083

[LUCIFER chuckles]

77
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,500
[MALE SOLDIER A]
I've got you in my sights.

78
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:42,125
There's gonna be nothing left
but atom dust when I'm done

79
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:42,625
with you!

80
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:44,541
Oooh, scary.

81
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,916
[MALE SOLDIER A]
I'm goin' home a hero!

82
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,375
I like the way you think,
little man.

83
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:54,250
It doesn't matter what you do,
so long as you win.

84
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:57,416
Is that the plan?
I'd call that pride.

85
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,625
[MALE SOLDIER A laughs]
Suck it!

86
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:12,125
[MALE SOLDIER A]
Wait, what?

87
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,791
[LUCIFER chuckles]
And speaking of prideful,

88
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,458
you really thought you
could defeat me with

89
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:19,083
this little pea shooter?

90
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,833
You'll most certainly
make a fine follower.

91
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,541
[FEMALE JUDGE A]
Guilty.

92
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:31,791
I hereby sentence you
to the death penalty.

93
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:35,791
[FEMALE JUDGE A gasps]

94
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:39,958
[FEMALE JUDGE A gasps]
What is this?

95
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:43,291
[LUCIFER chuckles] What gives
you the right to judge someone?

96
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:44,541
To murder them?

97
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:47,625
Is "justice" an absolute
that you alone decide?

98
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:50,625
My duty is to ensure that the
law is carried out properly,

99
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,625
regardless of what
conclusion it brings.

100
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,250
I have made no mistake.

101
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:57,333
So, "the law" gives you
the right to play God?

102
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:59,916
Justice can never be
burdened with doubt!

103
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,666
Here, in the court of law,
the judge is God!

104
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:07,208
Isn't that handy!
But I'm the judge now.

105
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:10,958
And I happen to find you
guilty of pride, that is.

00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,875
[FEMALE BEACHGOERS chatter]

107
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:18,208
[LUCIFER] You came here
just to show off your body.

108
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:22,333
You're sizing each
other up. Pathetic.

109
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,958
You can party here until
Asmodeus makes you kiss her

110
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:30,416
feet again, or you can come
with me, and keep your pride.

111
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,750
Say it with me! Melancholy!

112
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,875
[CROWD]
Melancholy!

113
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:37,416
[FEMALE SINGER A]
I think it's time for me

114
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,958
to drop some rhymes!

115
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:41,291
[LUCIFER] You're nothing
but a second-rate rip-off,

116
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,375
I bet you can't even sing.

117
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:46,333
You think you're so cute
you can get away with this?

118
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:48,166
How prideful!

119
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:53,291
And you all know you're
supporting a no-talent hack.

120
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,875
But you have too much
pride to admit that!

121
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,041
[LUCIFER]
Next up.

122
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,500
The producers,

123
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,958
so proud of yourselves for
thinking up this cash-grab.

124
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:05,541
You're mine.

125
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:11,541
[LEVI]
Whoa! I can't believe it.

126
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:14,791
You've gathered a whole army
of followers in no time at all!

127
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:17,041
[LUCIFER] Humans care about
themselves more than

128
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:21,041
anything else. That means
they're all guilty of pride.

129
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:25,000
Every human is born with that
arrogance in their heart.

130
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:28,375
That's why pride is
the sin that rules all.

131
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:31,833
In fact, I could condemn
all of humanity to Hell

132
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:35,000
if I saw fit to.
Can you imagine that?

133
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:38,958
Not a single, miserable soul
making it to heaven?

134
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:43,125
God knows this, and that's
why they fear me.

135
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:48,458
[GATES OF HELL ]
One million. Ten million.

136
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:52,666
One hundred million followers
you bring to these gates.

137
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,166
You may pass.

138
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,708
Make way for the Demon Lord!

139
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,125
[SATAN grunts]

140
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:11,833
You kept your word.
Thank you, Satan.

141
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:14,875
'Course I did. But still.

142
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:18,125
I didn't expect you to come
with an army of followers.

143
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:21,916
This is my underworld
comeback tour.

144
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,541
I couldn't show up
empty-handed, right?

145
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:27,791
[SATAN chuckles]
That works for me.

00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:40,625
[CHARON roars]

160
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,291
[BELIAL] I'm not pointing
fingers, but let's discuss

161
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:51,375
strategy to avoid any
further disappointments.

162
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:54,250
[MAMMON] Any reason
why Satan is missing?

163
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:56,166
[BELIAL]
Evidently, her loyalties now lie

164
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,000
with that fallen angel.

165
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,041
[BEELZE] I knew Lucifer
would keep her word!

166
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:02,333
[BELPHE]
Wow, you're killin' it, Lucy.

167
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:05,125
[ASMO] Just let her come,
Belial. It'll be fun.

168
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,083
[ASTA chuckles]

169
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,625
Enough of your sass!

170
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:10,958
You must perform your
duty as the Mortal Sins!

171
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:14,833
Go and confront Lucifer.
Strike the bitch down!

172
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:19,250
Heed my commands and this time,
we shall be victorious!

173
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:20,625
[SATAN]
It's too late for that.

174
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:21,875
[BELIAL gasps]

175
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:26,541
Lucifer has bested us fairly,
one after another.

176
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:30,791
Now, she returns as a true Demon
Lord, followers at her side.

177
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:35,500
[SATAN] We have no need
for you anymore, Belial.

178
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:39,166
You may do as you please, but
you will do it without my aid.

179
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,458
Farewell.

180
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:46,833
[MAMMON] Consider our business
arrangement terminated.

181
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:48,291
Good day!

182
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:53,041
[BELIAL]
Degenerates, all of them.

183
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,541
[gasps]

184
00:13:57,208 --> 00:14:01,458
[ASTA]
Maria? A living human, in Hell?

185
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:04,416
[BELIAL] She's my ace in
the hole, so to speak.

186
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,458
[ASTA gasps]

187
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,208
[BELIAL] I
assure you, Melancholy,

188
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:11,500
if you stay at my side, you will
see a most wondrous chain of

189
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:15,541
events that will turn this world
upside down and put us on top.

190
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:20,458
[ASTA sighs]
I owe you my life, Belial.

191
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:26,458
Wherever you go, I'll follow.
To the bitter end, if need be.

192
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,791
Now, little ladies, I believe
it's time you pay the toll.

193
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:36,375
What? Y'mean it's not free?

194
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,958
[LUCIFER grunts]

195
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,791
[CHARON] I'm the only one who
can ferry you across this river.

196
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,500
I deserve a little something,
wouldn't you say?

197
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,000
[LUCIFER]
Like what?

198
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:47,375
Oh, not much. Just perhaps
some of those delicious souls

199
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,375
you brought along.
The bikini babe ones!

200
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,625
[LUCIFER] I don't think so.
I need those.

201
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:54,416
Well, this old-timer has
to get his jollies somehow,

202
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,625
so why don't you give me a peek
at your panties, pretty please?

203
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:58,958
[LEVI]
Creep!

204
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,750
[LUCIFER] I'm always happy
to amuse a panty fan.

205
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,791
But, if I show you,
I'll feel like you won.

206
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:06,708
Yeah, you tell him!
You stupid pervy boat man.

207
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:07,958
Just die already!

208
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,916
[CHARON laughs]

209
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,500
[CHARON] Ooh, licky licky licky,
my spit is nice and sticky!

210
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:17,041
[LUCIFER gasps]

211
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,916
[laughs]

212
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,083
A pleasant flavor,
with no aftertaste,

213
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,041
but a bit too mild
if you ask me.

214
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,583
I need something more than that.
I'm getting' licky with it!

215
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:30,250
[LUCIFER grunts]
The hell you are!

216
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,333
What is that awful smell?

217
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:33,958
Don't let him beat you!

218
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:36,708
[CHARON laughs]
Most young ladies pass out

219
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,833
when they get a
whiff of my musk!

220
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:40,416
You're a pain in the ass!

221
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,666
[LUCIFER grunts]

222
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,625
[CHARON]
Licky licky!

223
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:51,958
[LUCIFER groans]

224
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,625
[LUCIFER]
Screw this!

225
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:58,833
[LUCIFER] You saw your panties,
now lay off, you old freak!

226
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,291
[CHARON groans]

227
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:03,458
[CHARON]
Just kidding.

228
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:08,208
Even for Hell,
this is getting weird.

229
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:11,208
Now I have an excuse
to rip you to shreds!

230
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,375
[LUCIFER grunts]

231
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:21,125
You're a feisty one,
aren't you, little lady?

232
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,416
But I've got plenty of tricks!

233
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,375
[LUCIFER gasps]

234
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,708
[CHARON giggles]

235
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,500
[CHARON]
Licky time!

236
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:37,750
[LUCIFER shouts]

237
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:42,833
--[CHARON chuckles]
--[LUCIFER shouts]

238
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,791
[CHARON]
You like it? You like it?

239
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:50,166
--[CHARON chuckles]
--[LUCIFER shouts]

240
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:54,041
[CHARON laughs] This is a
full-service ferry, missy,

241
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,125
you should be thrilled.

242
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:56,583
[LUCIFER]
You wish.

243
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:59,458
[CHARON] Hm? I may not
be much of a looker,

244
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:02,375
but experience counts
for something, don't it?

245
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:03,666
Let her go!

246
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,583
I'm the only one who gets
to have tongue-time

247
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:06,958
with Lucifer, asshole!

248
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:10,125
[CHARON]
Yeah? Yeah? Yeah? Ha, ha, ha!

249
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:11,541
Somebody stop me!

250
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:14,208
You suck, old man!

251
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:17,291
[LEVI whimpers]

252
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:20,125
Let us go!

253
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:29,625
[CHARON]
Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!

254
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,958
[LUCIFER gasps]
Nice job, Levi.

255
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:35,208
[LEVI chuckles]
I accept kisses as payment.

256
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:36,833
[WHALE roars]

257
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:38,833
[CHARON] We were having
a moment, damn it!

258
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:41,083
Now, get out of my way!

259
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:48,250
[CHARON]
And stay down!

260
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:53,583
[CHARON yelps]

261
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:58,791
[LEVI]
The souls of the dead.

262
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:02,000
[LUCIFER] Figures. They must
hate him as much as we do.

263
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,166
[LEVI] It's not enough.
I'll go finish him off.

264
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:16,208
[CHARON] Panties! I can
die without regret!

265
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:20,083
[CHARON groans]

266
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,083
Whew! That was fun!

267
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:30,416
The part where I kicked
his ass, at least.

268
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,375
[LUCIFER]
Yeah. Good work.

269
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:34,166
I feel bad for
your whale, though.

270
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,500
Guess that's it for him.

271
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,000
[LEVI]
Whatever.

272
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,666
There's a like a bazillion more
Whales where he came from.

273
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:44,083
More importantly. I'll take
my kiss now, please!

274
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,375
[LUCIFER] Sorry, we're here.
Business first.

275
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,041
[LEVI]
C'mon, don't be stingy!

276
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:55,583
[MAMMON] You surprised me!
All those followers!

277
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:58,375
It was quite the
triumphant return!

278
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:01,250
And we won't be
missing Charon, either.

279
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:05,500
Hey there! Haven't seen you in
a while, you're looking good!

280
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,208
Can you hurry, please?

281
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:11,458
Just conquer Hell or whatever
so I can get some sleep.

282
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:14,500
You made it! I'm so glad!

283
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,708
[LUCIFER chuckles]

284
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,583
[LEVI whimpers]

285
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:23,666
First things first. We need
to know what your plan is.

286
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,333
[BELPHE]
Depending on what it is,

287
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,583
we might end up fighting again.

288
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:33,333
Are you here to destroy Hell?

289
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:36,500
[LUCIFER] Not me, no,
but that's what God wants.

290
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:37,958
[ALL]
Hm?

291
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,333
[LUCIFER] The Seven Lively
Virtues received a decree

292
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:44,166
from God to purge
both Hell and Earth.

293
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,041
It won't be long now.

294
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,541
And what is your part in this?

295
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:53,583
[ASMO] Something tells me your
plan's gonna be pretty crazy.

296
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:56,666
Defeat God.
Flip Heaven and Hell,

297
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,583
and create a
new world order.

298
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:02,875
[BELPHE] Ooh! You like
to think big, don't you?

299
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:04,375
[LUCIFER]
God is a sore loser.

300
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:07,333
They're being childish because
no matter how much mankind

301
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:10,500
learns and grows, they always
find new ways to sin.

302
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:13,791
Humans help Hell flourish,
but Heaven, not so much.

303
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:16,250
I got sick of the whole
song and dance myself,

304
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:19,541
but God didn't like it
when I pointed that out.

305
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,958
Does Lord Belial
know about this?

306
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,875
[LUCIFER]
You bet she does.

307
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:25,875
[ASTA gasps]

308
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:29,833
If you don't trust me, by all
means, just ask her yourself.

309
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:31,166
[BELPHE]
Nah, it's cool.

310
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,500
[MAMMON]
I'm done with her.

311
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:33,625
Me too.

312
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:35,166
[ASMO]
That settles it.

313
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,416
[ASTA gasps]

314
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,791
We will protect Hell.
That's our duty.

315
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:41,916
[LUCIFER grunts]

316
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,666
Why does she get
all the cuddles?

317
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,708
[ASTA]
Belial.

318
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,000
Still siding with her?

319
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:56,458
[ASTA grunts]
She wouldn't lie to me.

320
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:59,750
I don't want to be enemies
with you, but I trust Belial!

321
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:05,958
[ASTA gasps] Uh, hey. You guys?
I'm standing right here.

322
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:08,916
Wow, you sure
are stupid, aren't you?

323
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,958
Belial is obviously full
of crap, you dummy!

324
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:15,291
[LEVI grunts]

325
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:18,208
[ASTA sighs]

326
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,083
[LEVI grunts]
Don't worry.

327
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:26,958
I'll take care of
this one for you.

328
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:30,291
Why, thank you, Levi.

329
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:31,375
[LEVI gasps]

330
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:32,375
[LUCIFER]
Why, thank you, Levi.

331
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,583
Why, thank you, Levi.

332
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:36,458
Thank you, Levi.
You're the only one for me.

333
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:39,333
In fact, when we're done
saving the world together,

334
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:41,083
I think we should get married.

335
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:44,875
Then have the hottest,
wildest honeymoon ever!

336
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:48,500
[LEVI gasps]

337
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:50,375
[LEVI]
Hold on a sec!

338
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:53,750
[LUCIFER gasps]

339
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:55,791
[LEVI] You better not cheat
on me while I'm gone!

340
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:58,291
You're all mine!

341
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:00,125
[LEVI]
Keep an eye on her, Behemoth!

342
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:02,125
I'm counting on you!

343
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:04,583
She always was
the jealous type.

344
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:09,666
[LUCIFER]
Better finish that fight quick,

345
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,666
or I might make
out with someone!

346
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,541
Why do you have to
tease me, you big meanie!

347
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:22,166
Let's make this quick Astaroth,

348
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:25,125
I don't have time
to screw around!

349
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:26,666
Well, tough luck.

350
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:30,750
