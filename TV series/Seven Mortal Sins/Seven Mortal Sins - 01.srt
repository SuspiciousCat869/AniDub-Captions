1
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:44,333
[LUCIFER] Ugh. Man, this sucks.
If you're gonna kick me

2
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:47,000
out of Heaven, then at least
let me plead my case.

3
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:50,041
You're awfully petty, God.
Or maybe you're just senile.

4
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:52,416
You have been around
for all eternity...

5
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,791
What's that, God?
Can't hear me over the cheers

6
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:56,708
of all your righteous angels?

7
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:58,625
And screw you too, Michael.

8
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:00,958
I watched your back so
many times, and you stab me

9
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:03,208
in mine the first chance
you get. This is why

10
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:06,541
you'll always be second place,
you conniving little cheat.

11
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:09,375
Well, good riddance!
I'll fall to Earth, Hell,

12
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:13,583
or wherever it takes to get you
two-faced chumps out of my life!

13
00:01:27,916 --> 00:01:30,166
[MARIA screams]

14
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:39,000
[MARIA gasps]

15
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:46,291
[MARIA] Um, hello?
You okay? Hello?

16
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:50,416
[LUCIFER] Uh...?
Wait. You can see me?

17
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,958
Yeah, of course I can.
Should I call someone?

18
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:55,416
[LUCIFER]
Strange...

19
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,541
What are you?
Not a human.

20
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:00,833
[MARIA]
Is that a joke?

21
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:08,750
[MARIA] I don't see any
injuries. That's good.

22
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:12,708
[LUCIFER] Over something like
this? Who do you think I am?

23
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:15,625
I need to get
you down somehow.

24
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:17,250
Hold on. I'll go find help.

25
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:20,916
Would you listen for a second?
I'm telling you, I'm an angel.

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,791
If you're human, you wouldn't
be able to see me.

27
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:26,000
But... I...

28
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:30,333
Give me a break.
Come over here.

29
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,500
Tell me your name.

30
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:36,333
Maria. Maria Totsuka.

31
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,208
[MARIA gasps]

32
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:41,458
Maria. You're very
blessed, aren't you?

33
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:46,125
[MARIA gasps]
What's that?

34
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:51,708
[MARIA gasps, squeals]

35
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:54,666
[LUCIFER] I'll entrust
an angel's life to you.

36
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:59,041
[LUCIFER]
Remember my promise.

37
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,500
Am I... dreaming?

38
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:06,541
[MINA]
Whoa, what happened?

39
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,125
Maria...?

40
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:17,208
[LEVI hums]

41
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:20,750
[LEVI sighs] When do I
get to be a Mortal Sin?

42
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:27,166
Cower before Leviathan,
the dark Lord of Envy!

43
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:31,583
Well, Behemoth? Was I cool?
No? Still need some work?

44
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:32,500
[LEVI giggles]

45
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:33,916
[BEHEMOTH squeaks]

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,875
Don't tease me.
I'm trying my best!

47
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:41,125
[LEVI] Uh-- Wait,
where are y'all going?

48
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:42,666
[LEVI gasps]

49
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:56,500
[LEVI grunts, yells]

50
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,541
[LEVI]
Seriously, what the heck?

51
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:08,958
Is that a cross? Oh, my gosh--
we got a real fallen angel!

52
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,541
[LEVI]
Whoa. It's gotta be.

53
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:19,166
That looks like Lucifer, too.
She's the triple crown!

54
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,958
That's number one in Heaven...
Number one I want to torment...

55
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:23,791
Number one I wanna see
in Hell! Here she is,

56
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:27,416
right on my doorstep, ready to
make my dreams come true!

57
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,291
Oh, great. So you
know who I am, huh?

58
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:34,208
[LEVI] Of course I do.
I'm your biggest fan!

59
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,750
[LUCIFER] Figures.
They hate my guts in Heaven,

60
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:39,958
but I'm some kind of
celebrity down here.

61
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:42,916
By the way, isn't it
kind of cold for Hell?

62
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,791
[LEVI] Oh, that's 'cause
this is Cocytus,

63
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:47,041
the lowest level
of the underworld.

64
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:51,750
Here, even someone as hot as you
gets frozen in no time flat.

65
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,541
[LUCIFER]
Yeah, I'm seeing that.

66
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:57,041
So much for stretching
my legs after a long trip.

67
00:04:57,125 --> 00:05:00,375
[LEVI] Hold on.
I'll thaw you out. Hey, Whale!

68
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:04,666
[WHALE roars]

69
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,666
[LUCIFER gasps]

70
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,250
Aw, jeez. That's hot.

71
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,916
[LEVI] Mmm... The sweet
smell of searing flesh...

72
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,333
Her clothes melting
right off...

73
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,250
This is what hell is about!

74
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:18,875
You don't mind
the torment, do you?

75
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,375
There's an awful lot
of that down here,

76
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:22,625
but nothing an archangel
can't handle.

77
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:25,083
You can still scream
if you like, though.

78
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,958
[LUCIFER]
Tch.

79
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:31,625
[LEVI] Your skin is everything I
dreamed of. It's soft as silk.

80
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:34,791
Oh, I'm dripping with envy...

81
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,000
Stop it!

82
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,250
[LEVI sighs]
Sorry, but I can't resist!

83
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,541
You really should
put some clothes on!

84
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:41,875
[LUCIFER]
You're the one who--

85
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:45,250
Don't worry. I won't
let you get cold again.

86
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,500
Keep your tongue
to yourself, pervert!

87
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,916
[LEVI] I don't think you're
being very honest with yourself.

88
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,583
Why don't you let your
body do the talking?

89
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:59,916
[LEVI] That's right.
Open up and let me in.

90
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,541
[LUCIFER]
I said stop!

91
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:04,708
[LEVI] I've been a fan of yours
for a long, long time.

92
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:07,375
I think fate
brought us together.

93
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:08,875
Now, here's an idea!

94
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:11,083
What do you say we
conquer Hell together?

95
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:13,833
Then I can finally
be a Mortal Sin!

96
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,083
[LUCIFER]
Not interested.

97
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,375
[LEVI groans]

98
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:17,583
[LUCIFER] I'm not
interested in hearing you

99
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,583
run your mouth anymore, either.

100
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:22,791
I don't care about Heaven
or Hell or any of that crap.

101
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:26,583
I'm going to do whatever
I want from now on.

102
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,333
But what about me?

103
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:29,500
Who cares?

104
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:33,541
[LEVI yells, grunts]

105
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:36,541
[LEVI]
Okay, owie...

106
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,666
Y'know, I expected
some resistance

107
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,958
at first, but then
we'd kiss and make up

108
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:43,500
and you'd tell me how
awesome my evil plans are.

109
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,583
Then, you'd make
all my dreams come true,

110
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:48,958
'cause you're sweet like that,
but also a badass.

111
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,583
This isn't like
my fantasy at all!

112
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,541
If you think a little water
is going to hurt me,

113
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,875
you're even dumber
than you look!

114
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:03,250
Okay, you guys, attack!

115
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,458
Are all the demons down here
weak and useless like you?

116
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:12,791
Because this
doesn't even tickle.

117
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:15,375
That arrogance is
gonna be your downfall.

118
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,166
[LUCIFER gasps]

119
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:23,083
[MICHAEL] Your arrogance has
proven to be your downfall.

120
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:26,958
I'm afraid this is the end,
Archangel Lucifer.

121
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:30,875
God has spoken. You are
to be cast from Heaven.

122
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:33,875
Is that so?
Cast from Heaven?

123
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:39,208
Indeed. You must atone for your
sin of pride--for all eternity.

124
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:42,250
You shall never return
to these hallowed skies.

125
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,666
With that, I bid you farewell.

126
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,625
[LUCIFER] If you're going
to laugh, do it Michael.

127
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:48,750
[LUCIFER gasps]

128
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:51,541
[LUCIFER]
Go ahead! Do it!

129
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:55,375
[LUCIFER gasps]

130
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:57,000
[LEVI]
Ha ha!

131
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,375
Whoa! Awesome!

132
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,083
[LEVI] Beautiful, powerful--
you've got it all!

133
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,083
I can't hold back;
it's like a tidal wave!

134
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,666
[LEVI laughs]

135
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:28,500
You're so cool. I love you.

136
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,333
I don't even
know who you are.

137
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:31,875
I'm Levi, of course!

138
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:35,291
The demon lord who commands
all waters, Leviathan.

139
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,541
You and I are going places.

140
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:39,166
Just think of me as
your partner in crime.

141
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,375
[LUCIFER gasps]

142
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,625
[LEVI] I promise, you came
to the right place.

143
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:52,375
You're gonna stand on top
of all the Mortal Sins.

144
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:55,708
Make me yours and the rest
of Hell will follow.

145
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,208
[LEVI giggles]

146
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:03,125
You're lucky I haven't
put an end to you.

147
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,666
[LUCIFER gasps]

148
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,958
Ow! My hand!

149
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:11,041
Try that again
and I'll rip it off!

150
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:14,916
Aww... But intimacy is
important, you know.

151
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,916
But intimacy is
important, you know.

152
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,041
[LUCIFER] I heard you
the first time.

153
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,791
[LEVI] Yeah, but you were
supposed to give me a kiss

154
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:24,208
and say you were sorry.
Let's try again.

155
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:26,375
[LUCIFER]
I'm good, thanks.

156
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,250
[LEVI] This is Pandemonium.
It's the gathering place

157
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:35,250
of the Seven Mortal Sins,
who rule all of Hell.

158
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:38,083
[SATAN]
That's far enough, angel.

159
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:41,833
[LEVI] That's the Demon Lord
of Wrath, Satan.

160
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:45,291
Your kind isn't welcome in
the hall of the Mortal Sins.

161
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,875
I would start running,
if I were you.

162
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,375
[LUCIFER] I saw you peeping
on me earlier, but I suppose

163
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:55,750
you were too shy to say hello.
Isn't that cute?

164
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:58,875
You... You will pay
for your insolence!

165
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,083
[SATAN yells]

166
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:07,833
Well! You're quite
formidable for an angel!

167
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:12,041
You were able to dodge
my trusty axe... once.

168
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,041
[LUCIFER] Twice.
Your axe is slow.

169
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:18,541
Too bad.
You left yourself open!

170
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,458
What?

171
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:23,791
[SATAN screams]

172
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:33,000
[SATAN groans]

173
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,291
[SATAN grunts]

174
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,166
It looks like the
gang's all here!

175
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,708
[LUCIFER]
Hmm?

176
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,875
What a rare treat, seeing an
angel in our humble home.

177
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:54,708
Might I interest you in one
of my miraculous elixirs?

178
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,916
Aren't you cute? Would you
mind if I took a little taste?

179
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,833
I can show you pleasures
you've only dreamed of.

180
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,625
[BEELZEBUB giggles]

181
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:13,083
Okay, an angel.
Whatever. Don't care.

182
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:16,458
[SATAN groans]

183
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:19,041
These are the Mortal Sins
you keep talking about?

184
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,833
Mm. They're the seven rulers
who preside over all the other

185
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:27,083
demons in the underworld.
Looks like one is missing.

186
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,208
[MAMMON] Leviathan, dear.
It's fine if you want

187
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,291
to give your friend
as an offering,

188
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:32,958
but I must remind
you once again

189
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:36,291
that only the Seven Mortal Sins
are allowed in these halls.

190
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:39,041
You're gonna be the offering
when we're done here!

191
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:42,875
Things are gonna change!
'Cause I have her with me now!

192
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:47,041
[SATAN snarls] Fine.
I'll rip you both to shreds.

193
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,375
[BELIAL]
Quell your wrath, Satan.

194
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,541
[SATAN]
You can't stop me.

195
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,458
[BELIAL] Don't get
ahead of yourself.

196
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,291
If you've forgotten
who stands at the top

197
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:59,083
of the Mortal Sins,
I'd be happy to remind you.

198
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,875
Tell me instead.

199
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:07,750
Heh. You storm in,
you don't introduce yourself,

200
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:10,125
and you make
demands of me?

201
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,708
[LUCIFER] That's about
the gist of it, yes.

202
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,500
[BELIAL] I owe you
no explanation,

203
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:18,333
but I'll humor you
this once, I suppose.

204
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,250
I'm the daughter of
the Byrndale family.

205
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,958
Perhaps the most famous clan
in all the underworld.

206
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:28,916
You must be quite ignorant
not to recognize me.

207
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,375
My beauty is widely renown.
My elegance is legendary.

208
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,791
God! You talk a lot!

209
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:37,583
[BELIAL gasps] I was
just getting started!

210
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:40,916
Anyhow, that's the Demon Lord
of Vanity, Belial.

211
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,625
[BELIAL]
Argh! Let me say it!

212
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:48,458
Indeed, it is I. Greatest
of the Seven Mortal Sins.

213
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:51,333
Belial, feared and beloved!

214
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,041
If you have to toot
your own horn that much,

215
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,250
you can't be that great.

216
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,958
I know someone like you.

217
00:12:57,041 --> 00:13:00,416
They had the audacity
to call themselves "God."

218
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,708
[BELIAL] Enough small talk.
Who are you, anyway?

219
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:06,000
[LEVI]
She's Lucifer! Duh!

220
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:10,541
This is Lucifer? The Archangel?
The leader of the Seven Virtues?

221
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:11,875
[LUCIFER sighs]

222
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,583
[BELIAL] My goodness,
how the lofty have fallen!

223
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:18,333
You must have made
a terrible blunder!

224
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:21,083
You can spare me your
fabricated explanation.

225
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,291
I've seen through
your deception.

226
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:26,833
This is merely a ploy
to invade our domain.

227
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:30,791
Heed my command,
Mortal Sins! Attack!

228
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:40,041
Mm... I see you're all
paralyzed with fear.

229
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:43,375
Very well, I shall show
you how this is done.

230
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:47,833
None is my equal. Face me,
and you will know defeat.

231
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:49,625
This might actually be fun!

232
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:52,416
Leviathan was the one
who dragged me here.

233
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,916
But I'm starting to think this
might have been my destiny.

234
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,416
Don't you?

235
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,500
The one that should rule the
Seven Mortal Sins... is me.

236
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:04,916
[MARIA]
Mm...!

237
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,583
[MINA] Maria, do you really
need another angel accessory?

238
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:10,416
Sure! I've been collecting
them since I was a kid!

239
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,083
Yeah, I know. I've heard
the story before.

240
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:16,541
Okay, but you believe
in angels, don't you?

241
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:19,166
I mean, that's what we're
taught, but I'd have to see one.

242
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,875
Like in person.

243
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:23,500
Then what?

244
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:27,416
[MINA] I dunno, I guess I'd say,
"What's up angel? I'm Mina!"

245
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,000
Or do you think they only
speak Latin or something?

246
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:43,416
[MARIA] She wouldn't
believe me if I told her.

247
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:49,250
[MINA] If angels exist, that
means demons are real, too huh?

248
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:51,458
The dark lord from ages past

249
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:54,166
shall rise again to
torment foolish humans!

250
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,291
[MARIA laughs] I don't think
that's how it goes, but okay.

251
00:14:58,416 --> 00:14:59,875
Are you all right?

252
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:03,458
You've been weird since that
thing happened in the church.

253
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:07,500
Yeah. I'm feeling a bit odd.

254
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,083
Well, you're still
not as odd as me,

255
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:11,708
so I wouldn't worry too much.

256
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:15,000
Maria. If you wanna
talk, I'm here.

257
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:18,666
That means a lot to me. Thanks.

258
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:22,166
[MARIA] Maybe I was just
dreaming. I don't know.

259
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:26,500
[MARIA] Ah! Hey, uh, Mina...
What are you doing?

260
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,083
[MINA]
Sorry, but I can't resist

261
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:30,291
those child-bearing
hips of yours.

262
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:34,250
What I'm saying is, "Maria!
I want you to have my baby!"

263
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,541
[MARIA] Stop it--
that feels weird!

264
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:41,125
You truly are audacious.

265
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:44,708
Shall I expound upon the torment
you'll suffer at my hands?

266
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:46,291
Don't care.

267
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:49,750
If you think you can kick my
ass, then let's see you do it.

268
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:53,333
This is Dáinsleif,
demonic blade of my Byrndale.

269
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:55,625
Once it leaves its scabbard,
it will not return

270
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:59,041
until its foes
no longer draw breath!

271
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,250
Thousand Apocalypse!

272
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:02,791
[LEVI]
Aah!

273
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,666
[BELIAL grunts]

274
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,000
[BELIAL gasps]

275
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,166
[BELIAL] My precious
family heirloom,

276
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,708
shattered into
itty bitty pieces!

277
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:24,041
I hope the place you
bought it accepts returns.

278
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:27,250
[BELIAL growls] You rotten
little heavenspawn!

279
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:33,833
[BELIAL yelps, moans]

280
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:35,583
[BELIAL grunts]

281
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:41,166
[LUCIFER] Hmm. I thought
your sword was junk,

282
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,541
but your armor fell
apart even easier.

283
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,583
And by the way, even
if I came from Heaven,

284
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,583
I'm no longer an angel.

285
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:52,250
This is pretty underwhelming,
as far as spoils of war go.

286
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:56,041
To think that I would be forced
to suffer such an indignity!

287
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,791
I thought Belial
was all badass?

288
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,416
I believe she's
second to Satan,

289
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,166
like she's second
in everything else.

290
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,750
[BELPHEGOR] Uh-huh.
And you know what they say

291
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,875
about second place.

292
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:08,750
They're the first loser.

293
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:11,583
Very well. I suppose
I can lend a hand.

294
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,250
[BEELZEBUB chews] 

295
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,625
[BEELZEBUB] One ass-beating
wasn't enough for you?

296
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:17,166
[SATAN grunts]

297
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,833
[GNOSIS] Pardon me,
my lady, may I speak?

298
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,958
You may.

299
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,958
[GNOSIS] It is I, your
faithful servant, Gnosis.

300
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:28,500
It pains me to see
you in such a state.

301
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,750
Please, use my body
as you see fit

302
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:33,875
and I vow to protect you
with all of my strength.

303
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:36,083
[BELIAL]
Very well.

304
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:39,250
[GNOSIS roars]

305
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:42,666
[GNOSIS growls]

306
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,166
[LUCIFER]
Uh--?

307
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,875
Fallen angel.
You shall suffer

308
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:49,000
for every insult
you have dealt me!

309
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,541
[LUCIFER gasps]

310
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:59,375
[LUCIFER groans]

311
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:00,916
Bye-bye.

312
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,458
[BELIAL] Heed your
leader, Mortal Sins!

313
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:08,833
Do not let Lucifer escape!
Use as much force as you like!

314
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:10,958
We can always piece
her together later.

315
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:13,625
[LUCIFER gasps]

316
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,833
[MAMMON] I suppose
I can give it a try!

317
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:17,375
[LUCIFER gasps]

318
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:23,708
[SATAN]
Get over here!

319
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,250
[LUCIFER]
Satan!

320
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:27,291
[SATAN]
We're not done!

321
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:30,625
[BELPHEGOR]
There you go.

322
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,958
[LUCIFER screams]

323
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:39,250
I wanna fight too.
Don't be greedy.

324
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,125
[BELPHEGOR]
Oopsie!

325
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:47,250
Ah! Asmo...
Such a perv.

326

327

[LUCIFER gasps]

328
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:55,583
Wow, I've never done it
with a fallen angel before.

329
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:59,916
By the way, I'm Asmodeus,
the Demon Lord of Lust.

330
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,166
I can't wait to hear all
your screams and moans!

331
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:06,291
Now is not the time!
Keep your grubby hands off her!

332
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:08,458
Besides, if Lucifer
wants to have sexy time,

333
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,500
then she should
have it with me!

334
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:13,625
[LUCIFER grunts]
No! No sexy time!

335
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,041
[BEELZEBUB]
All of you stop it!

336

339
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:22,125
It's over! Time to put you
in your place, fallen angel.

340
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,541
This is a land of
many torments,

341
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:26,708
and I shall give you
the full course!

342
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,583
[LUCIFER] You know, I get it.
The feeling of contempt

343
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:32,583
is mutual, but do you really
have to treat me like crap

344
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:34,666
just because of
the wings on my back?

345
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:38,208
I'm not too happy with
the angels myself right now.

346
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:39,708
[BELIAL]
Is that so?

347
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:43,041
Then I know just the thing.
It might hurt, though!

348
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:48,458
[LUCIFER cries out]

349
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:51,375
[LUCIFER pants]

350
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,958
[BELIAL] There's one left--
would you like to try?

351
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:56,041
I promise, it's quite fun!

352
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,583
No thanks. I kinda
lost my motivation.

353
00:19:58,666 --> 00:19:59,916
You're sick.

354
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,875
I'm afraid that's a bit
violent for my tastes.

355
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:04,583
I'm fine with
fighting someone,

356
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:08,000
but when it comes to torture,
I'd rather pass.

357
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,333
[BELIAL chuckles]

358
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:13,291
Too bad. It's your loss.
You can cry if you'd like.

359
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,291
[LUCIFER]
In your dreams, bitch.

360
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:16,791
And just so you know,
this is only

361
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,791
the beginning
of your suffering.

362
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:22,333
I have all manners of
torture lined up for you!

363
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,208
[MAMMON] That's enough
for me, ladies.

364
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:25,375
Yeah, I'm done here.

365
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:26,708
[BEELZEBUB]
Uh-huh.

366
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:30,041
I dunno. I bet something
crazy's about to go down.

367
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,958
Hear my words, Mortal Sins!

368
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,000
[LUCIFER] I've now been freed
from my bonds to God.

369
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,041
You have my thanks.

370
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:50,500
I'll introduce myself
once more. I am Lucifer.

371
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,791
The demon lord cast to Hell
for the sin of pride.

372
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:56,208
[BELIAL gasps]

373
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:59,291
[ASMO] The passage from
this realm has opened.

374
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:00,958
[LEVI] 
Take me with you!

375
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,500
[SATAN]
Is she being cast out?

376
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:04,541
Or is she intending
to go to Earth?

377
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,250
[BELIAL] Well, I hope
she learned her lesson.

378
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,958
I imagine it's the last
we'll see of her, either way.

379
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:10,958
I wouldn't say that.

380
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:17,000
She bears the horns of a true
demon lord now. You lost.

381
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,500
[BELIAL gasps, groans]

382
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:22,625
This is the last indignity!
Curse you, Lucifer!

383
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:34,083
[MINA] Bye, Maria.
I'm heading off.

384
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:35,416
[MINA sighs]

385
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,708
[MINA] Okay. Well, see you
next semester, I guess.

386
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:46,125
[MARIA gasps]

387
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:50,541
[MARIA gasps, yelps]

388
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:58,541
[LEVI] Lucifer, wake up!
Are you okay?

389
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:06,875
[MARIA] It's the fallen
angel from before.

390
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,833
You again, huh?

391
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:12,500
Who's she?

392
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:17,000
[LUCIFER]
Maria Totsuka.

393
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:19,166
I'm not an angel.

394
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:31,500
Not anymore, at least.
I'm a demon lord.
