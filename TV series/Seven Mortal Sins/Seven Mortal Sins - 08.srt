1
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:38,916
[groaning]

2
00:00:58,041 --> 00:00:59,708
Filthy wretch.
It was your crime

3
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:03,166
that brought her here, and you
would dare defile her again?

4
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,500
Hell is the only place for you.

5
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:08,250
The girl that you killed,
on the other hand, is innocent.

6
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:10,500
Heaven is her reward.

7
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,833
[SATAN] Begging will
not belay your torment.

8
00:01:18,916 --> 00:01:21,583
There is no grace
or mercy here.

9
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:26,958
[SATAN] Your very soul
will be ripped to shreds!

10
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:28,708
Pathetic.

11
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:31,500
[BELIAL] Living up to
your title, Lord of Wrath?

12
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:35,083
I'm surprised to see you here.
You don't often stop by.

13
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:37,291
So what brings you
to the Gates of Hell?

14
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:39,625
I thought the very sight
of humans disgusted you,

15
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:42,416
even when only
their souls remain.

16
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,583
Indeed. Such vile creatures have
no place in Hell or elsewhere.

17
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:50,875
I can't fathom why God
created the things.

18
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:52,500
There's a theory called
the Balance of Nature

19
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:54,791
that may explain
their existence.

20
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:59,250
Oh? I've never heard of such
a thing. Is it a human concept?

21
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:02,583
It's about equilibrium.
If something ugly exists,

22
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:05,500
then something
beautiful can exist.

23
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:08,500
I don't know.
Seems like a fair trade.

24
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:11,083
Ahem. Speaking of
wretched creatures,

25
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:13,250
that fallen angel
defeated Gluttony.

26
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,791
[SATAN gasps]

27
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,208
[SATAN]
Beelzebub?!

28
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:24,791
[BELIAL]
She never stood a chance.

29
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:28,250
The poor thing fell ill, then
Lucifer took advantage of her.

30
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:29,833
Has she no sense of honor?

31
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:33,250
[BELIAL] Now, Gluttony is little
more than Lucifer's house cat.

32
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:34,416
[SATAN gasps]

33
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,000
[SATAN]
That sounds adorable!

34
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:39,666
No, strike the image
from your mind!

35
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,875
[BELIAL]
There's only one answer,

36
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:42,708
and I think you know what it is.

37
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:45,666
Revenge!

38
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,916
I can't believe I let her slip
through my fingers like that.

39
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,875
Must be losing my touch.

40
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,625
I'm not worried about Maria.

41
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:34,000
You'll get her back soon;
I know it.

42
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:37,041
[LUCIFER] Thanks for the
vote of confidence, Bub.

43
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:39,916
Go ahead and have some.
It's good.

44
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,458
[BEELZE]
Mm.

45
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:51,541
[LEVI] Are you kidding me?
Maria's finally out of my hair,

46
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,750
and then this little
freeloader shows up?

47
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:56,041
"Feed me more."
Ugh, she only wants you

48
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,416
for your food,
can't you see that?

49
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,166
I'm gonna strangle
that spoiled brat!

50
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:08,333
[SATAN] Lucifer, it seems
I underestimated

51
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:10,625
the extent of your
spinelessness.

52
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:14,583
Yeah? Just here to
talk trash, Satan?

53
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:17,791
My axe shall speak
for me on that matter.

54
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:20,166
[LUCIFER] Fair enough.
I should've seen this coming,

55
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,333
since you and Belial
are the last ones left.

56
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:27,125
[SATAN] Return Beelzebub
and I may be merciful.

57
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:31,125
I like it here. I tried to
leave, but then I came back.

58
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:32,583
And there you have it.

59
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,750
[SATAN] Was it not
enough to defeat her?

60
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,875
You had to steal
her heart as well?

61
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:41,000
You have no idea the kind
of wrath I'll unleash!

62
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,666
Look out!

63
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:58,041
That hurt.

64
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:01,291
Forgive me. I had to move
quickly. Can you still fly?

65
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:04,083
Course I can.
Don't touch me.

66
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:09,750
[SATAN] You should have run
while you still had the chance.

67
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:12,166
Don't even worry, Lucifer,
I'll take her out.

68
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,875
[SATAN] You think
you're equal to me?

69
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:16,750
I'm better. I'm gonna shove
that stupid axe of yours

70
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:19,416
up your sorry ass and
take your throne in Hell!

71
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:26,083
Huh. I like your moxie. I'll get
to you next, Lucifer. Just wait.

72
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:29,000
Don't you dare take
your eyes off me!

73
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:32,666
[MARIA groans]

74
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,416
[MARIA]
Where am I?

75
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:38,083
[BELIAL] A place that no
mere human has ever had

76
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:40,500
the privilege of laying eyes on.

77
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:44,125
This is the Ninth Circle
of Hell, known as Cocytus.

78
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:47,791
We're in Castle Pandemonium.
You're here to stay.

79
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,458
That doesn't impress me.

80
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:53,291
You demons are my enemy
and the enemy of God, too.

81
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,666
Kidnapping me was
pointless, you know.

82
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:59,625
I'm human, but I'm on Lucifer's
side and she will stop you.

83
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:02,958
Her baseless pride seems
to be rubbing off on you.

84
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:06,875
[BELIAL]
But it is quite curious.

85
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:10,458
I wonder why she has
such interest in a human.

86
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:13,041
You wouldn't happen
to know, would you?

87
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,000
Something to do
with Heaven, perhaps?

88
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:18,083
You did speak of God
just a moment ago.

89
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:19,500
She didn't tell me anything.

90
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:21,375
You're quite loyal, aren't you?

91
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:23,583
But I'll have my
answer in due time.

92
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:27,291
[MARIA] All I can do is wait.
I just hope Lucifer's all right.

93
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:42,000
[SATAN]
Beelzebub.

94
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:45,250
I never thought you would
take such a liking to Lucifer.

95
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:49,166
Ah! Could it be that I
envy that fallen angel?

96
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,125
[LEVI] You bet you do!
I know that face!

97
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:54,583
Trust me, I'm the expert!
Now suck it!

98
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:12,291
[SATAN laughs]

99
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,250
I was hoping that
would finish the job.

100
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:18,833
This is bad. There's no
water. I need a plan!

101
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,625
[SATAN] The destruction
that we wrought has awakened

102
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:25,541
the wrath of the city. Its
strength courses through me!

103
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:28,416
Your temper tantrum
is over, I presume?

104
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,916
I can throw a
tantrum all night.

105
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,375
C'mon, Whale!

106
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:36,166
[WHALE roars]

107
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,000
[LEVI]
Full speed ahead!

108
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,375
You think she's okay?

109
00:08:55,458 --> 00:09:00,083
[WHALE roars]

110
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:03,166
If I fight here by the ocean,
then nobody can beat me!

111
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,625
[SATAN] You've chosen your
final resting place well.

112
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:08,125
We can do battle here,
free of any obstacles.

113
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:10,333
[LEVI groans]
Would you shut up?

114
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:13,750
Who even talks like that?
You are so stupid!

115
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,041
And you're finished!

116
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:39,458
A waste of time.
I'd hoped for some fun.

117
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:48,375
[LEVI gasps]

118
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:13,000
[LEVI] I'm sorry.
Looks like I let you down again.

119
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:18,666
Levi lost. I think she's hurt.

120
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,833
[LUCIFER]
It was inevitable.

121
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:23,083
[BEELZE] Should we
see if she's okay?

122
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,708
[LUCIFER]
No. I need a game plan,

123
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,958
or I'll suffer the
same fate as her.

124
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,750
[LUCIFER] 
My magic is still too weak.

125
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:33,208
Uh... What's this?

126
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:36,291
You're my friend.
I'm happy here with you.

127
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:39,833
Food makes me feel strong.
It might help you, too.

128
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:47,083
Thank you. Ah!
What am I scared of?

129
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,750
No one's gonna beat me!

130
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:52,500
Even if they do, I'll always
figure something out.

131
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,041
Uh-huh.

132
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:06,458
[LUCIFER] Good. That hit the
spot, Bub. I'll handle the rest.

133
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:12,333
[LUCIFER] All that's left
is for me to kick some ass.

134
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,208
[BEELZE] I'll be
cheering for you.

135
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,166
[BEELZE] I know you want to
save Maria as quick as you can,

136
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,791
but you need to get
rid of that curse

137
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:27,333
before you go
back to Hell.

138
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:30,000
[LUCIFER] I'm on top of it.
You should go home, though.

139
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,041
For real this time.

140
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,500
[BEELZE] Soon, okay?
And I have to come back

141
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:37,125
so we can eat more
yummy food together!

142
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,166
You have to pull through,
no matter what!

143
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:44,125
I'll be waiting and believing
in you, just like Maria.

144
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:51,000
[LUCIFER] That's right.
My friends are counting on me.

145
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,583
Levi...

146
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:24,583
She's here.

147
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:26,416
Bring on the
big guns, Satan.

148
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,916
I won't bow to anyone. Got it?

149
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,666
That's what I like to hear!
Now, let me introduce you

150
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,541
to my followers,
wielding the greatest power

151
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:40,333
that humanity has to offer!

152
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:43,666
Boys, this is war!

153
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:57,625
[MALE SOLDIER A] 

154
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:36,333
[SATAN] Bury your fear!
Continue the assault!

155
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,708
Show the strength
of your training.

156
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:41,083
The strength of your wrath!

157
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:51,875
[LUCIFER gasps]

158
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,833
[SOLDIERS]
Victory! Victory! Victory!

159
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:53,333
Ba, ba, baloo boo.
Boobaba-Zeh-booboo.

160
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:56,166
I release you from
the deep abyss.

161
00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:00,125
Beelze. bubu-bubu.
baba-lululu.

162
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:03,708
[BEELZE]
Levi.

163
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:05,250
[LEVI gasps]

164
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,333
[SATAN]
Aah!

165
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:26,583
[WHALE roars]

166
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,500
[LEVI] Thought you could
write me off that easy?

167
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:42,000
Time to give you
a burial at sea!

168
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:44,666
[LUCIFER] Nice work, Levi.
Good to have you back.

169
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:49,291
[LEVI giggles] I finally
did something right!

170
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:52,333
You're really gonna love
me after you see this!

171
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:59,125
[SOLDIERS yell]

172
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,208
Hear their cries for revenge
thunder across the sky!

173
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,166
I can feel their wrath!

174
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,375
Ah! White hot rage is
coursing through my veins!

175
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:10,666
Now tremble before
my might, unleashed!

176
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,750
[LEVI screams]

177
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:16,750
Come forth! Face me!

178
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,291
[LUCIFER yells]

179
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:23,500
[LUCIFER grunts]

180
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:27,916
[SATAN yells]

181
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,916
[WHALES roar]

182
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:38,833
[LEVI]
What, are you stupid?

183
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:40,750
You're gonna blow up
the whole world!

184
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,583
You want a whole planet full of
dead humans clogging up Hell?

185
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,583
'Cause that's what
you're about to get!

186
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:48,500
She's right! You're all brawn
and no brains, huh?

187
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:51,583
[SATAN laughs]

188
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,125
[LEVI screams]

189
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,166
Lucifer!

190
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,166
Just for fun...
If I win,

191
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:03,291
how 'bout you do me
an itty-bitty favor?

192
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:07,083
Sure, why not? I wouldn't
get your hopes up, though!

193
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:15,125
[BELIAL] It seems Wrath
is enjoying herself.

194
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:16,791
There's no stopping her now.

195
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,375
[MARIA] She'll lose
like the rest of you.

196
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:21,291
Well, aren't you sassy?

197
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:24,416
And what makes you think
Lucifer will pull through?

198
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:30,041
I don't need a reason.
All I need to do is have faith!

199
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:33,000
Did you forget
about this already?

200
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,375
We're not the ones
who took it from you.

201
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:38,541
If it wasn't for Lucifer, you
wouldn't be in Hell right now.

202
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,541
And you still have faith?

203
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,083
She was just...

204
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:44,416
[BELIAL]
Poor, innocent thing.

205
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,916
You know she's not an angel
anymore, don't you?

206
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,083
[MARIA sighs]

207
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:52,375
But never fear.
Once we defeat Lucifer,

208
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:55,583
you and your dear heart
will be free.

209
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:56,541
[MARIA gasps]

210
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:59,583
Really? You mean that?

211
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:02,625
Well, of course! You and I
don't have to be enemies.

212
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,791
Just help us put an end to this.

213
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:05,791
But I...

214
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,791
[BELIAL laughs]

215
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:15,083
[LUCIFER]
What do you think?

216
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:18,791
Not a human in sight!
A lovely view.

217
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:22,750
Of course! We deserve
a proper battlefield, right?

218
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:24,708
[SATAN] Let me ask
you one thing first.

219
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:28,958
If you lose this duel, what will
become of the human girl?

220
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:32,625
[LUCIFER] Maria's fate
and my fate are inseparable.

221
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,125
[SATAN]
Huh.

222
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:40,750
[LUCIFER gasps]

223
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:51,125
The commandment
was released? But why?

224
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:54,333
They haven't even begun the
battle! I sealed Lucifer's magic

225
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,833
so you could defeat her,
you witless lout!

226
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:59,125
[MARIA gasps]

227
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:02,166
[BELIAL sighs]
I shouldn't blame Wrath.

228
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:05,958
Not everyone
can be on my level.

229
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:07,875
[MARIA sighs]

230
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:12,583
[MARIA] You can do it, Lucifer.
I still believe in you.

231
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:15,333
[LUCIFER] I can't tell if you're
stupid or just plain crazy.

232
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:18,083
[SATAN] I won't have you blaming
your defeat on that curse.

233
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:19,458
[LUCIFER]
Works for me.

234
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:22,708
[SATAN] I, the Third Mortal Sin,
Demon Lord of Wrath,

235
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:26,625
challenge you to a duel.
Try to lose with honor!

236
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,333
[SATAN yells]

237
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,125
[SATAN yells]

238
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,416
Don't tell me you're
retreating already!

239
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,291
Where's all your bluster?
Give me a challenge, damn it!

240
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,416
[LUCIFER] Quite the beast,
aren't you?

241
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,000
[SATAN yells]

242
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,541
[LUCIFER gasps]

243
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,333
[SATAN yells]

244
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:24,958
[LUCIFER yells]

245
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:33,000
[LUCIFER pants]

246
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:36,708
Is this really the best
you've got? How unfortunate.

247
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,916
[SATAN]
Trying to run?

248
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,666
[LUCIFER gasps]

249
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:58,416
[SATAN yells]

250
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,250
[SATAN]
I can't see!

251
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:14,041
[LUCIFER]
No brains after all.

252
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:42,291
I admit defeat. You've
bested me. Well fought.

253
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,916
I shall grant any favor you ask.

254
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,416
[SATAN groans]

255
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,375
Then I would have you
open the Gates to Hell.

256
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:55,541
As you wish,
Demon Lord Lucifer.

257
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,333
[LUCIFER]
Only one remains.

258
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:01,708
Ready your neck for
the gallows, Belial.

259
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:03,875
I'm coming for you!

260
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:09,666
[BELIAL]
Lucifer!

261
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:13,333
Curse you and your imbecilic
sense of honor, Wrath!

262
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:18,791
[BELIAL] Hmph. No matter.
So long as I have the human,

263
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:20,833
all will fall into place.

264
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:25,916
[BELIAL laughs]
