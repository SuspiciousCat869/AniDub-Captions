[DEMON LORD roars]

2
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:40,083
[SOLDIER A] We did it!
We beat the demon lord!

3
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:41,916
That means we won
the whole game!

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,291
Guess we're done
till the next update.

5
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:46,791
[BELPHE sighs] That boss
was brand new.

6
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:49,791
They finish this stuff as
fast as I throw it at them.

7
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:53,250
I'm gonna lose all my
subscribers at this rate.

8
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:56,500
I'd better cook up a new
expansion for these nerds.

9
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:35,625
[LEVI hums]

10
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:38,000
Next one on the list is
the Demon Lord of Sloth.

11
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:39,541
What can you tell me?

12
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:41,291
[LEVI hums]

13
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:43,625
She's strong,
but she's super lazy.

14
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:46,166
When she loses her temper,
she's real scary.

15
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,833
All she ever does
is lay around,

16
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:50,583
but she's somehow able to
get thousands of followers.

17
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:51,958
There anything else?

18
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:56,208
Uh... She runs some online
game thing with Mammon.

19
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:57,583
[LUCIFER]
"Online"?

20
00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:00,458
[LEVI] Like, the internet?
That thing Maria uses?

21
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:01,750
Well, Sloth brought it to Hell.

22
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,166
[LUCIFER]
Hmm...

23
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,416
[LEVI hums]

24
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,416
Hey, look! It's Behemoth!

25
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,958
[LEVI giggles]
Ahh...

26
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:15,833
[LEVI cries]

27
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:19,833
Save the stomping for
Belphegor, not my bubble art!

[phone rings]

32
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,625
Mm? Get the phone!

33
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:34,833
Stop ringing!

34
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,375
[LUCIFER gasps]

35
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,791
Behemoth, huh?

36
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:00,291
[LUCIFER yells]

37
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:13,875
[BELPHE giggles] Wow. Rocking
your birthday suit today?

38
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,666
Can't blame you.

39
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:21,083
It's hard enough to get out of
bed, let alone put clothes on.

40
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,875
[LUCIFER]
We meet again, Belphegor.

41
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:25,916
I see you saved me the trouble
of hunting you down.

42
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,291
[BELPHE]
No prob, Lucy. Any time.

43
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,250
[LUCIFER] Call me Lucy again
and I'll yank that tail

44
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:34,083
straight off your ass. Anyway,
let's get this over with.

45
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:37,125
[BELPHE] Yeah, Belial is way
not cool with you. She told me

46
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:41,458
to stop you, so I guess that
means we're gonna have to fight.

47
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:43,750
I'm glad we're
on the same page.

48
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:47,416
[BELPHE]
Ahh... Mm...

49
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,333
That's great,
but instead of fighting,

50
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:50,875
why don't we play a game?

51
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:51,750
[LUCIFER]
What game?

52
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,125
[BELPHE]
My game, of course!

53
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:56,958
Mammy set up an
MMO RPG and I run it.

54
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,916
The idea is,
there's a demon lord

55
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,041
that tries to take over
the world, then, like,

56
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,375
a bunch of heroes come
together to stop them.

57
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:04,791
[LUCIFER]
Oh, yeah?

58
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:07,125
[BELPHE] So, you can be
the hero, or you can be the...

59
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:08,958
[LUCIFER]
Demon lord, obviously!

60
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,916
[BELPHE]
Uh-huh. Shoulda figured.

61
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,541
Then I'll start a
new event in the game

62
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:16,166
where the players have to team
up and beat Demon Lord Lucifer.

63
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,291
[LUCIFER] The players? I thought
I was supposed to be facing you.

64
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,875
Uh? But I have a ton
of subscribers,

65
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:25,500
and they're gonna wanna get
their money's worth, you know?

66
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:28,125
These "subscribers" are
your followers, I assume?

67
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:29,875
Oh, my god,
that's totally it!

68
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:33,333
They'll try to stop big, evil
Lucy from taking over the world.

69
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,791
If they lose, you can take
my seat as a Mortal Sin.

70
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:36,958
How about that?

71
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,625
Ah? Seems like you're
fairly confident.

72
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,916
[BELPHE]
And if you lose...

73
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,625
Do whatever you want with me.
That's not gonna happen, though.

74
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:48,708
Ah... Well, guess we'll see!

75
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:51,458
[LUCIFER yells]

76
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:56,583

Mmm...

00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,458
[LUCIFER yells]

79
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,500
[LUCIFER] Out of my way,
weaklings!

80
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,250
[PLAYERS scream]

81

[BELPHE sighs]

82
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:11,125
Don't worry, guys, Belphegor's
here to lend you a hand.

83
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:13,333
[PLAYERS]
Our savior!

84
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,625

[BELPHE grunts]

86
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:25,416
[BELPHE]
You are like a demon!

87
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,875
On second thought,

88
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:29,666
we might have to recruit a
legendary hero for this one.

89
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,666
[indistinct chatter]

90
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:35,541
You guys hold down the fort
in the meantime. I'll be back!

91
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:37,916
And here I thought the game
was getting too easy!

92
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,750
We'll probably die a bunch, but
I bet the loot's gonna be epic!

93
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,250
[FEMALE SOLDIER B] Don't leave!
If you have to pee,

94
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,291
then do it in a soda bottle.

95
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,291
[MALE SOLDIER C] I'm totally
gonna livestream this raid!

96
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:50,458
I'm gonna be internet famous!

97
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,125
[MARIA] I think that's
everything.

98
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,916
[phone buzzes]

99
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,625
Why would Levi call me?

100
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,541
[MARIA yelps]

101
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:05,541
[MARIA gasps]
What happened?

102
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:12,750
Hello? Somebody answer, please!
Excuse me! Hey! Help!

103
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:18,250
[MARIA gasps]
What's with all this fog?

104
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,500
[MARIA] Maybe there was
no one out here after all.

105
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:26,500
[BELPHE]
Are you lost?

106
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:29,250
[MARIA gasps]
Uh-- Uh...

107
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,250
Pick that up for me, 'kay?

108
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,333
[BELPHE] Pretty light, huh?
That's cause it's a magic sword.

109
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:42,583
Yeah.

110
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:45,208
It has a low strength
requirement to equip.

111
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:47,333
And now, your armor!

112
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,583
[MARIA]
Ah--!

113
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:55,125
Try it on, girlfriend!
Looks like it'll fit.

114
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:58,541
[MARIA grunts]

115
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,541
[MARIA]
It's a little heavy...

116
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:04,916
[BELPHE] Let's try
it out in combat!

117
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,500
[MARIA]
Uh-- Wait, what?

118
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,666
[MARIA]
Huh?

119
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,666
[DRAGON roars]

120
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,291
[MARIA screams]

121
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:21,208
[BELPHE] Mm! I knew that
armor was the right call.

122
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:23,875
Look, not a scratch on you!

123
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:25,625
Aah! I can't move!

124
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:26,708
[DRAGON roars]

125
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,250
[MARIA screams]

126
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:34,250
Stop it! This isn't funny!
Please, let me go!

127
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,875
Aah! Stupid lizard!

128
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,541
[MARIA screams]

129
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:45,416
[MARIA screams]

130
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,250
[BELPHE giggles]
That's good enough for me!

131
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,125
[BELPHE]
This world needs your help.

132
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:56,416
A great and powerful demon lord
threatens to bring it to ruin!

133
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,583
[MARIA]
Demon lord?

134
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:59,000
Anyway, the details
don't really matter,

135
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,833
but the point is,
it's your problem now,

136
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,625
'cause you're
the legendary hero.

137
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,291
[MARIA yelps]

138
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,791
[MARIA]
I can't even... stand up.

139
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,791
Okay then, Plan B.

140
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:16,000
[MARIA yelps]

141
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,500
[BELPHE chuckles]
Shazam!

142
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,541
[BELPHE]
There! You like this better?

143
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:24,125
At least I can move...

144
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:27,416
But the back is really
riding up my, um...

145
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,250
[BELPHE]
Don't you play video games?

146
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:32,500
The skimpier the armor,
the better the defense!

147
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:35,166
[MARIA] How is that supposed
to make any sense?

148
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,416
Would you stop
complaining, girlfriend?

149
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,791
Take it for a spin and
you'll change your mind!

150
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,333
[MARIA]
Uh...

151
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,750
[MALE SOLDIER A]
We are so screwed!

152
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:53,291
[MALE SOLDIER B] No kidding!
Our "free-to-play" weapons suck!

153
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:58,750
[SOLDIERS scream]

154
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:03,625
[BELPHE] I bet you can totally
own that thing, Maririn!

155
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:06,500
"Maririn"?
Hold on, is that me?

156
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:09,166
I'm not strong enough to
save the world on my own.

157
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,708
Help me. You must become
the hero of legend and fight!

158
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:15,041
For great justice!

159
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:19,250
A hero? I could try...

160
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,541
[MARIA yells]

161
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,791
[MALE SOLDIER B]
Your DPS must be off the charts!

162
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,125
[FEMALE SOLDIER B]
That's a magic sword, huh?

163
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:49,208
[FEMALE SOLDIER B]
What's your handle?

164
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:52,166
[MARIA]
The Hero Maririn.

165
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,125
[BELPHE] She's picking
this up pretty quick.

166
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:08,625
[BELIAL] I'm not much for video
games. Are we winning or not?

167
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:10,791
Getting there. I had
a minor setback,

168
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:14,583
'cause Lucifer stomped
all my players. But no biggie.

169
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:18,166
The Hero Maririn's got our back.
All according to the playbook.

170
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,375
She just has to level up.

171
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,583
[BELIAL] Very well.
I'll take your word.

172
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:25,166
[BELIAL] Just one thing. While
you're waiting on this "hero,"

173
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,458
could you straighten up
a bit? This is shameful.

174
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:30,041
But this is how I like it.

175
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:33,583
If I want a snack or something,
I don't even have to get up.

176
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:36,208
I can just grab it with my tail.

177
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:37,750
[BELIAL sighs]

178
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,833
[MARIA] Wait, why's
the demon lord here?

179
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,333
Well, why not?

180
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:48,083
Even demon lords enjoy a dip
in the hot spring sometimes.

181
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,625
If you say so.

182
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:03,125
Lucifer? Is that you?

183
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:04,916
What a surprise!

184
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I get it! You're the hero
everyone's been waiting on.

185
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:13,541
I guess so... Never mind that!
This is awkward!

186
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:16,458
Why are you the bad guy
all of a sudden?

187
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:19,083
'Cause it's fun.
Isn't it obvious?

188
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:21,375
Stop complaining
and get over here.

189
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:22,916
A bath'll loosen you up.

190
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,625
[MARIA]
Not a chance.

191
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:27,833
It's cliché, but you can take
half the world if you join me.

192
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,750
No thanks!

193
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,333
[LUCIFER] You've
gotten awfully cocky

194
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:33,708
all of a sudden.
What happened?

195
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,166
The whole world
is counting on me.

196
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,041
I can't let them down when
they need a hero! I'm sorry!

197
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,416
Maririn, we love you!

198
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,541
Kick her ass!

199
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,375
[indistinct cheers]

200
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,458
Wow, you're quite the
celebrity, aren't you?

201
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,208
Can't say no to your fans!

202
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:47,750
En garde!

203
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:54,166
[MARIA] I'm gonna be a hero!
I'm gonna save the world!

204
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:57,416
Fine, have it your way!
I'll make this quick.

205
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,333
[MARIA gasps]

00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:01,666
[MARIA yelps]

207
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,375
Do your research next time.

208
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:06,166
This place is the Chanel
Number Five hot springs.

209
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:09,458
You didn't read
the sign, did you?

210
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:12,125
Your lingerie
won't save you here!

211
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,791
[MARIA screams]

212
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:22,125
I can't do it.
I was so sure...

213
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,875
You really think you would
save the world if you beat me?

214
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:27,458
Whether I call myself
a demon or not,

215
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:31,625
I'm helping people here.
Wait and see.

216
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,041
[CAT]
Meow!

217
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,625
Meow! Okay,
that was fun,

218
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:38,375
but it would be lame if the
hero lost the fight already.

219
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,666
So why don't we just
make a hasty retreat!

220
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,666
[LUCIFER]
It's you...

221
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,416
Catch you on
the flipside, Lucy.

222
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,958
[CAT]
Meow!

223
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:53,166
[BELPHE] Okay, we're switching
you to plant panties.

224
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,750
[MARIA groans]
They're awfully itchy...

225
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,708
[BELPHE] I hear ya, but all
the plants in this jungle

226
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:00,375
are poisonous,
so whatcha gonna do?

227
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:03,166
[MARIA gasps]
I won't get sick, will I?

228
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,916
It's like they say--
whatever doesn't kill you

229
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,750
only makes you stronger!

230
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:09,125
You don't have any more
magic armor you can give me?

231
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:12,291
After last time? Nope,
now you gotta earn it.

232
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:15,041
And besides, if you can't
deal with some itchy panties,

233
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,708
how are you supposed
to beat a demon lord?

234
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:20,541
[MARIA] You're right,
Miss Kitty. Please...

235
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:23,958
Whatever it takes,
teach me to be a real hero!

236
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:29,166
[BELPHE] Alright, I'll school
you, but it's not gonna be easy.

237
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,916
The demon lord isn't
going to wait for us.

238
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,875
We gotta get you
into fighting shape.

239
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:35,833
That means it's time
for a training montage!

240

241
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:58,458
Okay, and punch!

[MARIA moans]

252
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:23,666
[BELPHE] In the cave behind the
waterfall of Julio Iglesias,

253
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,833
there is an angel who
controls the power of water.

254
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:29,916
She's the guardian of a
legendary piece of equipment.

255
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,833
[MARIA] Wait, so I'm
fighting angels now, too?

256
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:35,125
I don't know if I like that.

257
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,416
[BELPHE]
To protect the world,

258
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,625
sometimes you have to
do complicated things.

259
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,583
[MARIA]
Um. Hello there.

260
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:45,250
I've been waiting.
It must be the will of Heaven

261
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,708
that has brought you
here to me, mighty hero.

262
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:51,750
But before you reach your
destiny, you must face a trial.

263
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:55,041
[MARIA gasps]
Uh... Levi?

264
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:59,041
Indeed. I'm the angel,
Levi. Uh-- Ah--!

265
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:02,041
What in the hell are
you doing here, Maria?

266
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,250
You're an angel?

267
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,333
Shut your trap! I don't
wanna talk about it!

268
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:07,541
Why d'you have to ruin
everything for me?

269
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:10,833
Your angel wings are really
cute. You should keep them!

270
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:12,583
Forget the dumb trial, okay?

271
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,500
I'll just give you
the equipment.

272
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:15,958
[MARIA]
Are you sure?

273
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:19,333
As long as you leave.

274
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,625
Take it and get out.

275
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,500
One more thing.

276
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,916
Don't tell Lucifer about this.

277
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,125
[MARIA giggles]
It is cute, though.

278
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:32,541
If you say another word,
I will so put a curse on you!

279
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:37,541
[MARIA] This outfit looks just
like the one I had before...

280
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:40,875
[BELPHE] It's cheaper to do a
re-skin instead of a new design.

281
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,791

Ah! She totally came back!

00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,583
She sure kept us waiting!

285
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:54,958
Just in time! Whew!

286
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,583
That's cool and all,
but I have to work

287
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:58,583
in an hour. I gotta log off.

288
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:00,125
Wow, is it that late?

289
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,708
[FEMALE SOLDIER 6B]
Shoot. I've got a test today.

290
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:04,875
[BELPHE]
Aw. You can't leave now!

291
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:08,125
[MARIA]
Ah-- Miss Kitty?

292
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:11,333
You're gonna miss the
big boss fight, you guys.

293
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:14,625
But I'll get fired if I take
any more time off from work.

294
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,708
[BELPHE] If your boss won't let
you have any fun, you should

295
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:20,500
just quit, right? Work is
for losers, I always say.

296
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:24,458
I'll give you some rare loot
if you stick around.

297
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:26,666
Whoa! This is Demon Gear!

298
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,291
We can take out the
demon lord for sure now!

299
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:32,291
Guess we can stick
around a bit, right?

300
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:34,750
[MALE SOLDIER C]
Dude, screw our jobs!

301

[LUCIFER laughs]

302
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,583
That's what I'm
talking about!

303
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:44,541
Destruction, panic,
chaos, running wild!

304
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:47,125
Once you've gone demon lord,
you can't go back!

305
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:48,666
But I still need more!

306
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:52,500
I need to strike an even greater
fear in your shaking hearts!

307
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,750
The Hero of Legend.
With your training complete,

308
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:59,041
you can vanquish the
demon lord at last.

309
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,750
[MARIA]
Mm.

310
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:01,791
[PLAYERS cheer]

311
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,958
I finally get
to kick some butt!

312
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,833
Your friend there really has
you on a short leash, Maririn.

313
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,458
You've got one last
chance to back out.

314
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:14,041
I won't listen to your
deceitful words, Demon Lord!

315
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,375
Fine by me, but I'm
gonna strip you bare

316
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:20,291
and leave you crying for
your mommy. Time to party!

317
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:24,500
[MARIA yells]

318
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,625
[MARIA yelps]

319
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:32,291
Just like before. You can't
keep your clothes on.

320
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:36,083
[MARIA gasps, moans]

321
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:38,958
I can tear them off all day!

322
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,708
[MARIA gasps]

323
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:45,041
That's some armor!

324
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,958
It's over!

325
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:51,208
[LUCIFER cries out]

326
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:54,500
[BELPHE] You did it!
Now finish her off!

327
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,375
[MARIA]
No, it's not right.

328
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:57,875
[PLAYERS cheer]

329
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,583
[MARIA]
Hm.

330
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,708
[MALE SOLDIER D] Okay,
seriously, going to work now.

331
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:03,083
[MALE SOLDIER A]
Me, too.

332
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:04,916
[FEMALE SOLDIER B]
Ugh, I stayed up all night.

333
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,666
This event was the best
one yet, Belphegor!

334
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:08,791
Catch you later!

335
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,416
Thanks for the loot!

336
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:15,541
It's not over! The story's
only got one ending

337
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,333
and she has to die. If you're
gonna be lame about it,

338
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,125
I'll finish her off myself.

339
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:21,125
[MARIA gasps]

340
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:23,041
[BELPHE]
So long, Lucifer!

341
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,583
[BELPHE grunts]

342
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:28,833
[MARIA screams]

343
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:31,791
You're being a real pain!

344
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:35,625
This is a video game--you need a
cooler special move than that!

345
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,916
Here, let me show you!

346
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,500
BELPHE wails]

347
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:41,916
The game isn't built for this--
you'll make the servers crash!

348
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,791
You think I even
know what that means?

349
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:47,125
I don't care about your rules--
I'm here to kick your ass!

350
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,291
[MARIA gasps]

351
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:49,583
[BELPHE gasps]

352
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,791
I was having fun
when this was easy,

353
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:55,666
but now you made everything
suck! Whatever! I give up!

354
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,625
[LUCIFER]
You admit defeat?

355
00:20:57,708 --> 00:21:00,166
Everything's glitched out, I'm
gonna lose all my subscribers,

356
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:04,666
and it'll take forever to
fix this. So yeah, you win!

357
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:08,833
I'm never playing games
with you again! You cheat!

358
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,208
[BELIAL growls]

359
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:17,750
You were supposed to
be fighting Lucifer!

360
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:21,958
Yeah, but it was hard.
Games're s'posed to be fun.

361
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:25,416
I'm not gonna play
if it's a chore.

362
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,458
Huh?

363
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:29,666
Uh--! Awww, lame!

364
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:34,375
Glad you came to your senses,
instead of killing me.

365
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:35,958
I was afraid you'd
become another one

366
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:38,791
of Belphegor's
fantasy world followers.

367
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:40,583
That whole thing
was so crazy!

368
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,125
I really thought
I was a hero, too!

369
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:45,125
Even with the hornets
and the itchy plants

370
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:48,083
and naked stuff, I still
thought it was pretty fun.

371
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:50,500
I believed it until
the very end.

372
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:53,208
But when we fought,
it just seemed so fake.

373
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,375
Like part of a screenplay.

374
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:57,166
[LUCIFER] Of course.
It is a game, after all.

375
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:00,083
That means it's not really
possible to save the world.

376
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:01,791
Then what would the players do?

377
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:05,166
When one demon lord dies,
another one will take its place.

378
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:08,125
Sorry. I feel so dumb now.

379
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:10,083
[LUCIFER] Since you're
such a fancy hero now,

380
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:12,500
are you gonna fight me
and save the real world?

381
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:15,416
Or do you need your magic
lingerie to do that?

382
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,375
Uh! Would you
stop picking on me?

383
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:20,833
By the way, what's
the deal with her?

384
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:23,083
[MARIA]
Oh, uh...

385
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:25,375
[LUCIFER] Are those angel wings?
If you're trying to pick

386
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:30,041
a fight with me, Levi,
I'll be happy to oblige.

387
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:32,083
[LEVI]
I'm so dead...
