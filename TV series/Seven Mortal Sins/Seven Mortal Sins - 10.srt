1
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,791
[LUCIFER grunts]

2
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:41,375
We really have to
go down this cliff?

3
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:45,500
[sighs]This is going to
be a massive pain the ass!

4
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:55,041
[LUCIFER] Hm? Huh? So this
is what happens to people

5
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:56,291
when they kick the bucket.

6
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:59,166
Well, at least they're
having a good time.

7
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,416
[LUCIFER grunts]

8
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:04,833
[LUCIFER]
Uh?

9
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:14,666
[LUCIFER] We've just entered
the Second Circle of Hell.

10
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,708
I see why they call it the
Hell of Violent Storms.

11
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:00,541
[ASMO]
Well, well, well.

12
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:03,416
I didn't expect you to
come to me like this.

13
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,500
[BELIAL]
Where are the other Sins?

14
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:08,125
[ASMO] Oh, they decided to
return to their own hells.

15
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:11,291
So they can be there to welcome
Lucifer with open arms.

16
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:12,916
[BELIAL]
I see.

17
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,916
So the 7 mortal sins are
siding with a fallen angel?

18
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,708
What's next, all of
Hell will freeze over?

19
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,791
I think it's high time you
came clean about a few

20
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:24,583
important topics. Mainly,
I wanna know about Heaven.

21
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:27,041
I'm sure I have no idea
what you're talking about.

22
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:30,083
Vanity suits you,
"playing the fool" does not.

23
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:32,583
What makes you think
I'm playing the fool?

24
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:35,166
Your pheromones reek of
the scent of your lies.

25
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,958
I smell duplicity
and double-dealing

26
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:39,166
all over you, Belial!

27
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,125
[BELIAL gasps]
What are you doing?

28
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,041
[ASMO] You will tell me
why you betrayed Hell

29
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:47,041
or suffer the consequences
of your silence!

30
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:50,416
[BELIAL gasps]

31
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,750
[ASMO] You know I take an
incredible amount of pleasure

32
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,375
in watching you suffer.

33
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,750
I almost hope you
hold your tongue.

34
00:03:56,833 --> 00:04:00,625
My mouth's watering at the
thought of torturing you.

35
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:03,750
[BELIAL] I see. You're going
to turn against me?

36
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:06,291
The leader of the 7 mortal sins?

37
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:07,625
[ASMO]
Leader?

38
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:09,250
Well, you've certainly
been leading the effort

39
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,416
to beguile us from
the very beginning.

40
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,958
Haven't you, Vanity?

41
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:14,958
[BELIAL]
Hmph!

42
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:17,791
[ASMO]
So you wanna be in charge?

43
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:19,125
[BELIAL]
Yes.

44
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,375
I'm going to amass enough
power to rival Heaven

45
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:23,625
and bring them to their knees.

46
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,791
I think you need a hobby.

47
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,166
The current state of the Sins

48
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,000
leaves us without
a proper leader.

49
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,375
We're weak and we're vulnerable.

50
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:35,166
We cannot defeat
Heaven like this.

51
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,291
That is why I'm paying
a visit to everyone

52
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:39,666
and imploring them
to hear me out.

53
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:43,458
I see. You're trying to
make an offensive move

54
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:48,041
against the armies of Heaven?
Ha! Count me in.

55
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:50,833
You want to organize the
ranks of Hell, do you?

56
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,916
We could use a little
development, I think.

57
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,291
Is there meat? If so, then yes.

58
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,583
[BELPHE]
That sounds like a real pain,

59
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:03,416
but if you wanna be the one
to do all of the hard work,

60
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,583
then knock yourself out.

61
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:08,625
[gasps]
You don't need my permission.

62
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,375
I'll support you,
no matter what.

63
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:12,333
You know that, don't you?

64
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:16,791
So what do you say?
Asmodeus, dark sin of lust?

65
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:19,333
Please let me be the leader.

66
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:22,208
Oh. Fine. Yes.

67
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:25,208
I don't know about you, but I
can't wait to get a real taste

68
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,958
of the Heavenly Host.

69
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:30,583
I'm getting all wet just
thinking about it.

70
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:33,083
Thank you very much.

71
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,750
[BELIAL chuckles]

72
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:40,041
[BELIAL chuckles] That certainly
brings memories to mind,

73
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:43,250
but let's get back to
the business at hand.

74
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:45,125
[gasps]

75
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:49,541
As leader of the seven sins, and
as a penance for your actions,

76
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,833
I command that Asmodeus,
Lord of Lust,

77
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:54,375
be punished for High Treason!

78
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,000
[ASMO shouts]

79
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:05,125
[ASMO gasps]
You can't do this, Belial!

80
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:08,208
You selected me to be the
leader of the sins, right?

81
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:10,041
As long as that decision stands,

82
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:13,416
none of you can
defy my authority!

83
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,625
[ASMO shouts]

84
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:20,458
[BELIAL] You'll regenerate just
a bit more quickly than my winds

85
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:24,000
can cut your skin and
tear into your flesh!

86
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:27,458
You of all people should
know pain is pleasure.

87
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:30,875
Perverts love that sort of
thing.

88
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:34,791
The pain feels too good! Oh! Oh!

89
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,500
[BELIAL chuckles]

90
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:41,000
[LUCIFER grunts]
This is wind is crazy strong.

91
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:46,500
[LUCIFER]
Who is that?

92
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:51,083
Oh damn. It's Asmodeus.

93
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:55,625
[ASMO gasps]
Lucifer. She got me good.

94
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:59,333
She brought me to
ecstasy many times over.

95
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:01,375
[LUCIFER]
Don't worry, I'll save you!

96
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:05,541
No, don't! I am the demon
lord of lust, remember?

97
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:09,291
All the pleasures of the flesh
fall under my dominion.

98
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:13,166
This will not defeat me.
I decided to choose you.

99
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,750
And I can live with that.

100
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:19,958
[shouts] You must hurry, Lucy.
Time is running out.

101
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:22,625
The rest of the sins
are in grave danger!

102
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,041
[ASMO grunts]
Belial is-- ow!

103
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:29,000
H-Hurry up and go.
Forget about me!

104
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,708
[ASMO screams]

105
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:41,375
This is so gross!
These are my good shoes too.

106
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:44,666
[LUCIFER grunts]
You're annoying. Spit it out.

107
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,666
Come on.

108
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,208
[LUCIFER gasps]

109
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:57,333
[BEELZE whimpers]

110
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:02,500
[LUCIFER]
Bub!

111
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:05,875
[BEELZE whimpers, coughs]

112
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,666
Let her go right now!

113
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,875
[BEELZE]
Lucifer. Don't...

114
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,375
But Bub?

115
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:15,125
It's okay. This is my atonement.

116
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:16,416
[LUCIFER gasps]

117
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:22,750
[BELIAL] So tell me:
how did Lucifer seduce you?

118
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:24,500
She gave me a lotta fun.

119
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:28,208
[BELIAL] She gave you "fun"?
Heh. You mean she gave you food.

120
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:32,625
Fine then. She's not the only
one who can feed your passion.

121
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:38,875
[BELIAL] Help me, and you
can help yourself, Bub.

122
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:43,000
No, thank you. I'm fine.
Just fine. Thanks.

123
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,625
I see.

124
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:51,250
[BEELZE whimpers]

125
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:55,875
When I tell you to eat, Missy.
You open up wide. Ha, ha, ha!

126
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:59,708
We cannot defy Belial.
I had no choice, Lucifer.

127
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:01,708
You must believe me.

128
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:06,333
Your meat is the only meat I
want to scarf down. I'm sorry.

129
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:09,625
[LUCIFER sighs] You're a
good little demon, Bub.

130
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:12,916
[chuckles]

131
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,333
[LUCIFER shouts]
No!

132
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,083
Bub!

133
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,541
[BEELZE] I must pay
my penance, Lucifer.

134
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:24,083
[LUCIFER] In order to
end your eternal Hell,

135
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:26,791
the leader of the Sins
will have to change!

136
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:33,250
[BEELZE whimpers]

137
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:36,916
Don't you worry about
a thing, all right?

138
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,625
This will all be over soon.

139
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:41,083
The meat you love'll
be yours again!

140
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,833
[MAMMON] So you've shown
your true colors at last.

141
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:51,791
What's wrong? Are you
regretting your choice?

142
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:54,458
Is the Lord of Greed
having buyer's remorse?

143
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:55,916
[MAMMON]
Don't be ridiculous.

144
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,833
All investments come with
a certain amount of risk.

145
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:01,625
But, the old adage is true:
the greater the risk,

146
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:03,750
the greater the
potential for reward.

147
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,791
[BELIAL]
How very greedy of you.

148
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:08,416
Am I to assume you've chosen
that fallen angel as your

149
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,375
next investment opportunity?

150
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,833
[MAMMON]
Yes. Lucifer's quite a woman,

151
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,833
her upside is too
big to pass up.

152
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,833
In fact, the opportunity
is so great,

153
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,750
I'm thinking about going all in.

154
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:22,458
Know what a gambler does when
the cards are bad? He folds.

155
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:25,250
You overplayed your hand!

156
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,416
[MAMMON gasps]

It is holding on to its vanity.

a fool to believe it can ever

and you have my word:
I will make this lie true!

00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:50,083
It was the Byrnedale

that gave you all the confidence
to trust in my leadership.

they wanted to become

00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,166
Sadly for you, there's no one
left to take your side, Lucifer!

310
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:21,166
[BELIAL laughs]

311
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,166
Always quick to
run away, that one.

312
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,916
You must be very careful.

313
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,166
[LUCIFER grunts]

314
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,375
Please, she is mighty.

315
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,708
Her power grows
stronger by the minute.

316
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:41,583
I fear she is more
powerful than all of us.

317
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,041
Yes, I know.

318
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:50,333
[LEVI]
Whale. Do it!

319
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,458
[WHALE A roars]

320
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:55,166
[ASTA] Hey! You can't
use servants! That's cheating!

321
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:58,750
[LEVI shouts] You're not
supposed to topple over, Whale!

322
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:01,666
[ASTA] Well, that was
certainly anti-climactic!

323
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:05,541
If we don't do something quick
we're gonna be gonners! Help!

324
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,583
[ASTA] I don't have
any magic left.

325
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:09,125
I suppose I could do
another rap ballad?

326
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:12,208
[LEVI] I don't want a song!
I want you to save our asses!

327
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:13,500
[ASTA]
Too late.

328
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,833
[BELIAL]
Wake up.

329
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,416
[MARIA gasps]

330
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,833
[BELIAL] I need your help and
you're going to give it to me.

331
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:31,875
In so doing, we will bring a new
fearsome power to my Dáinsleif.

332
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,750
[MARIA gasps]
Stop it.

333
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:38,083
[BELIAL chuckles]

334
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:42,625
[MARIA gasps]

335
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:44,916
[BELIAL]
Angel blood. I knew it.

336
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,583
She's as cunning
as she is shrewd.

337
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:50,208
What better place to hide
Angel's Blood than in the veins

338
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:51,375
of a human.

339
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:54,500
[gasps]
I don't understand.

340
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,541
[BELIAL] This is all about
Lucifer having her

341
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:57,875
chance to return to Heaven.

342
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,125
[MARIA gasps]

343
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:02,833
[LUCIFER] I'll entrust
an angel's life to you.

344
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,625
[gasps]

345
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:07,250
What's wrong? Did you not
realize you were being used

346
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:10,041
till just this moment?
Don't worry.

347
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:14,875
A plan can come to an end
just as quickly as it starts.

348
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:17,250
[MARIA screams]

349
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:22,291
[LUCIFER]
The Ninth Circle. Cocytus.

350
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:25,666
The giants, sealed in this
eternal frozen ice Hell,

351
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,583
are from the
ancient age of myth.

352
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:29,125
Those that rebelled against God

353
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,541
and were defeated
by the Holy Armies.

354
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,000
[gasps]

355
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,625
[LUCIFER grunts]

356
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:42,250
[GIANT A roars]

357
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:43,875
[LUCIFER shouts]

358
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:47,416
[LUCIFER]
Belial, you crafty bitch.

359
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,583
So, this is the last barrier
I have to break through?

360
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,625
[LUCIFER grunts]

361
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:56,958
[LUCIFER] If you really
think these oversized freaks

362
00:20:57,041 --> 00:21:00,000
could hold me back, then you
don't know me at all!

363
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:03,958
[GIANT A groans]

364
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:06,500
You're gonna hafta do
better than that!

365
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:14,625
[LUCIFER grunts]
They're tougher than I thought.

366
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,083
Look! In case you
hadn't noticed,

367
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,125
I'm a little busy right now!

368
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,166
[LEVI]
Lucifer!

369
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,333
[LUCIFER]
Huh?

370
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,041
[LUCIFER]
Levi what the hell?

371
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:28,166
[LEVI]
Save me!

372
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:31,000
[LUCIFER] Sorry, you're on
your own! Good luck!

373
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:38,166
[LUCIFER pants]

374
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,083
You're trying to force
me to use the last bit

375
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:43,083
of my magic on
these sorry ass giants.

376
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:46,583
You guys tried to defeat
Heaven and lost everything.

377
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:47,458
Guess what?

378
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:49,041
I'm gonna try, too!

379
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:51,125
But I'm gonna win!

380
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:04,666
[LUCIFER pants]

381
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,958
[LUCIFER]
Hm! I actually made it.

382
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:09,416
[exhales]

383
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:17,958
Maria. I'm coming for you.

384
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,416
[laughs]
