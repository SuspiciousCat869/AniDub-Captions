[MARIA gasps]

2
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:14,541
I'm not an angel.
Not anymore, at least.

00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:20,375
[LUCIFER chuckles]

4
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:25,291
[MARIA shudders]

5
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:40,416
This isn't fair.
I have to die for nothing?

6
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,500
It doesn't even hurt, does it?
Who says you're gonna die?

7
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:48,000
Wait. I can't feel
a thing. But why?

8
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:50,000
[LUCIFER] Here.
See for yourself.

9
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:51,541
[MARIA gasps]

10
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:55,375
[MARIA]
That's my heart...

11
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:00,625
That's right.
Did you miss the part

12
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:03,416
where I pulled it out
of your chest just now?

13
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:09,541
[MARIA]
The wound is healing.

14
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:13,416
[LUCIFER] Yep. Nice and tidy.
How about a "thank you"?

15
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,416
But how? None of this
makes any sense.

16
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:23,791
I can't live without a heart.
I must be dreaming.

17
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,250
Since you're so stupid,
I'll explain things.

18
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:29,041
Not only are you still alive--
as long as Lucifer here

19
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,208
has your heart, you'll
stay that way forever.

20
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,708
But if you wanna die,
I could help ya.

21
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,708
I'll just grab that
beating heart of yours

22
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:38,458
and squeeze it till there's
nothing left but a bloody pulp.

23
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:41,000
Y-You're awful! Stop it!

24
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:42,583
That's enough!
Give it back!

25
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:43,750
[LUCIFER]
Nope.

26
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,916
Why are you
doing this to me?

27
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:51,333
[MARIA groans, gasps]

28
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:55,041

[LUCIFER chuckles]

30
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:58,375
[LEVI]
Wow. Badass.

31
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:01,291
So tell me, what are you gonna
do with a human girl's heart?

32
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,291
None of your business.
How about that?

33
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:06,541
Ahh! I wanna know...

34
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,458
I'm so pissed off.
I want a damn rematch.

35
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:13,875
I was outnumbered, that's all.

36
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:16,666
Those Mortal Sins have no idea
who they messed with.

37
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,291
I promise, I'm going
to show them

38
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:22,500
just how terrifying I can be...
next time we fight!

39
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:29,750
[SATAN] Now we know the strength
of the Seven Lively Virtues.

40
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:31,458
Or a fallen one, at least.

41
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,416
Looking to purchase
a new axe?

42
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,625
[ASMO moans]

43
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:39,916
[ASMO] I thought I'd finally get
to see what angel tastes like.

44
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,500
It's not fair!

45
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,708
[BELIAL] You saw
how amazing I was.

46
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:46,083
I made a fool out of
that arrogant angel.

47
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,666
Let's forget her and move on.

48
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,083
By the way Belial,
why are you still naked?

49
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:54,791
Are you too vain to admit that
she destroyed your clothes?

50
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:56,625
[BELIAL] I branded
that fallen angel

51
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:59,833
with the Garb of Punishment.
A secret weapon passed down

52
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:03,333
through generations of
the Byrnedale Family.

53
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:05,833
I have thoroughly
ensured her undoing.

54
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:09,083
Who cares if I happened
to do so in the nude?

55
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,375
That only means I'm not
dependent on my wardrobe

56
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:14,541
for success.
I should be proud.

57
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:24,041
Sounds like some revisionist
history, but what do I know?

58
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,708
She is the Sin of Vanity.
It's impossible for her

59
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:29,000
to see the truth when
it's not in her favor.

60
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,541
Well, Lucifer. I hope
you're crazy enough

61
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,833
to come back
for another battle.

62
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:39,833
[MARIA weeps]

63
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,833
[LUCIFER] Stop whining
and come with me.

64
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:51,458
[LEVI] Wait, what? We're taking
this stupid crybaby with us?

65
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:55,291
Uh-huh. Got a
problem with that?

66
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:59,250
I'd rather just put her
out of her misery.

67
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:06,708
Dinner is served, my friend!

68
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,333
[MARIA screams]

Am I not good enough for you?

72
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,291
I'm taking her with me and
that's all you need to know.

73
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,708
You don't have any
say in the matter.

74
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:26,958
But why? She's a human!
She'll only slow us down!

75
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:30,375
[LUCIFER] If she does, I can
always get rid of her later.

76
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:33,000
I won't drag you by your hair,
but I can't make any promises

77
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:35,791
about your heart if
you don't come along.

[MARIA gasps]

79
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:49,458
[LEVI] Is this our
new home? Sweet!

80
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:50,958

Mm?

[faint chatter]

82

Seemed like the nicest place in
town, so I thought "why not"?

83
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:03,000
Hey, Maria. Hotel reservations
are a human thing, You do it.

84
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:04,333
[MARIA gasps]

85
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:07,166
Good evening, ma'am. Can I
get your name, please?

86
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,458
[MARIA]
Is this gonna work?

87
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:15,375
It's Totsuka. Maria Totsuka.

88
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,500
[RECEPTIONIST] I'll check
for your reservation.

89
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:23,125
[RECEPTIONIST]
There we are...

90
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,125
All right, everything
is in order.

91
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:27,166
According to our records,
it says you'll be staying

92
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,708
in the presidential suite
indefinitely, correct?

93
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,666
I guess so...

94
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,750
--[LUCIFER] Come on.
--[MARIA gasps]

95
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:39,791
[MARIA] What kind
of magic did she work?

96
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,250
[LEVI hums]

97
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,166
[LUCIFER] I suppose
this will do.

98
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,166
[MARIA] Whoa. I don't
know if I feel comfortable

99
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,666
spending the night here,
since I know

100
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,958
we're definitely
not paying for it.

101
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:59,375
"Spending the night"? This
penthouse belongs to you now.

102
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:01,083
It's your new home.

103
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,208
Wait, it's mine?

104
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:04,208
That's right.
For all eternity.

105
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,166
I don't need a
place like this.

106
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,541
I don't even know why
I'm here in the first place.

107
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,875
Why do you need me?

108
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:13,208
Stop asking questions.
It's not important.

109
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,208
[MARIA]
That's not fair.

110
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:18,625
You took my heart away.
Can't you at least tell me why?

111
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,000
What, this little thing?

112
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,208
[MARIA gasps]

113
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,916
It's not really your
heart anymore, is it?

114
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,666
You're cruel!

--Lay off.
--No fair.

Why are you acting
like such a prude?

126
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:30,583
[LUCIFER] You need
to cool your jets.

127
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,625
[LEVI]
I can't with you around!

I got it!

[LUCIFER] You really want
that back, don't you?

130
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:41,041
What's the matter?
You don't trust a demon lord

131
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:44,500
to take care of your
heart? Come get it.

132

Afraid of a little water?

Uh, I'm okay, thank you.

What are you doing?

C'mon, stop your
whimpering and get naked.

[MARIA] Ah... I'll swim in
my clothes; just let me go.

Who the hell goes swimming
with their clothes on?

139

That's bad manners,
if you ask me.

No, it's not!

That wasn't so hard,
now, was it?

Ahh. You should make her
fly out a window instead,

00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,833
[LEVI]
She's ignoring me.

159
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,791
Lucifer!

160
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:08,375
Hey, look! Here!
I'll show you a cool trick.

161
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:09,916
Ta-da!

162
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:15,208
[LUCIFER laughs]
A whirlpool? This is fun!

163
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,500
Make it go faster.

164
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:19,000
[LEVI]
Sure! Anything for you!

165
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,666
[MARIA squeals]

166
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,500
You sure are helpless...

167
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,208
[MARIA coughs]

168
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:38,666
[LEVI] Just let her drown!
Why do you like her so much?

169
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,416
Who knows?
I do whatever I want.

170
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,875
[LEVI groans]

171
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:44,625
[LEVI]
This blows.

172
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:45,958
[MARIA]
I don't know...

173
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:49,666
I don't know why you
chose me, either.

174
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,125
Not this again.

175
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:53,708
If you don't need me,
then let me go!

176
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:57,333
[LUCIFER] Don't you realize
I'm doing you a favor?

177
00:11:57,416 --> 00:12:00,000
Stop complaining and just
roll with it, all right?

178
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,083
"Roll with it"? Seriously?

179
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:09,166
Listen. You can't die anymore.
You won't grow old. You'll stay

180
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:12,625
young and beautiful just like
you are for all eternity.

181
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:15,875
Immortality. Isn't that
all you humans long for?

182
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:19,708
I was fine before! Turn me
back to normal. Please!

183
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:22,583
[LUCIFER] That's what you want?
To grow old and shriveled up?

184
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:25,333
Ravaged by age and disease?

185
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:29,458
Come back to me in 60 years and
see if you feel the same way.

186
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,000
Kidding. You don't get
to make that decision,

187
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:34,375
because I'm
the one in charge.

188
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:38,416
All you need to worry about
is following instructions.

189
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,416
[LEVI] She's ruining everything!
Pay attention to me, damn it!

190
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,083
[LEVI groans]

191
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:48,291
[LUCIFER] I want the best food
this world has to offer.

192
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,500
Let's see what they've got here.

193
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:53,041
Hmm. This sounds impressive.

194
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:56,208
"The Premium Dinner, Full Course
Special." Let's see if they

195
00:12:56,291 --> 00:13:00,833
can satisfy me with their
primitive human cuisine.

196
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:02,041
Mm?

197
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:04,041
I'll cook for you.

198
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,291
If you really want to be
satisfied, then you need

199
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,375
a home-cooked meal
straight from Hell!

200
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:11,916
Just sit tight and let me
do my thing, 'kay?

201
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,458
[LEVI hums]

202
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:15,708
This'll be good.

203
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:18,208
Uh... I think I'll pass.

204
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:31,875
[LEVI gasps]

205
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:34,000
[LEVI growls]

206
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,541
[LUCIFER] What did
you do to me, Belial?

207
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:13,250
[LEVI] Luci-poo,
I'm so lonely without you.

208
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,250
I wonder where you ran off to.

209
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:16,791
Do you know
where she went?

210
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,291
[MARIA] 
Uh, no.

211
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:21,375
[LEVI] She should've taken
me with her! What's the deal?

212
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:24,166
[MARIA]
By the way...

213
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,458
[LEVI]
Hmm?

214
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:28,708
It looked scary, but your
food was wonderful.

215
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:33,458
Mm... You weren't supposed
to eat any in the first place!

216
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:37,125
Just so we're clear, I hate
your guts! So I don't need

217
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:40,166
your compliments!
You're my worst enemy!

218
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:44,166
You're the one who's getting
between me and Lucifer!

219
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,833
I wish you were dead!
I wish I could kill you!

220
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:49,625
[MARIA squeals]

221
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:52,541
Please stop it.

222
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,250
[MARIA gasps]

223
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,291
I know she said
you're immortal,

224
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:59,583
but it might be fun
to try at least.

225
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:02,458
[MARIA]
Huh?

226
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:03,958
No!

227
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:05,875
You think Lucifer
would forgive me

228
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:09,333
if I ripped you to pieces
or filled you with holes?

229
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:15,083
[MARIA pants]

230
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:20,958
[MARIA sighs]

231
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:27,416
Why is this happening
to me? She's crazy.

232
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:31,041
[LEVI laughs]

233
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:33,291
[LEVI]
You sure look pathetic!

234
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,458
[MARIA gasps, squeals]

235
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,416
[MARIA]
No!

236
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:42,416
[MARIA squeals]

237
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:45,541
[LEVI] 
I don't need to kill you.

238
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:48,291
I thought of something
even better. I'm going

239
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:52,291
to torment your sorry ass
until you wish you were dead!

240
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:54,291
[MARIA gasps]

241
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:57,291
[MARIA squeals]

242
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:58,875
[MARIA cries out]

243
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:01,541
Yes, that's it! You keep
screaming and moaning

244
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:03,375
like a little bitch
and I'll do the rest!

245
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,416
[MARIA]
This feels disgusting!

246
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,416
[MARIA pants]

247
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,083
[LEVI]
My goodness.

248
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:13,833
Sure would be humiliating if
someone saw you like this.

249
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,833
This is a busy hotel.

250
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:19,333
That someone could use this
elevator any minute now.

251
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:20,333
[bell rings]

252
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:21,875
[MARIA gasps]

253
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:27,750
[MAN]
Uh...?

254
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:34,875
[MARIA grunts, gasps]

255
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,416
[MAN]
Eh?

256
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,250
Why don't you scream
like you did a second ago,

257
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:44,250
so he knows what a
little freak you are?

258
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,250
Let me go!

259
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:46,916
[LEVI, MARIA moan]

260
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,833
[MARIA gasps]

261
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:57,000
[MARIA squeals]

262
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:58,791
Are you okay?

263
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:03,666
Ah! Uh... I'm fine.
Just a tickle, that's all.

264
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,833
[MAN]
I see.

265
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:07,125
You can't play this off
forever, you know.

266
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:09,750
I bet you'll feel better if
you let out a little moan.

267
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,625
Sure, he'll think you're
a perv, but who knows?

268
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:13,416
He might be into it.

269
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,625
Disgusting. I won't
let that happen.

270
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,041
[LEVI groans]

271
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,750
[MARIA whimpers]

272
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,083
[MARIA moans]

273
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,083
[LEVI giggles]
That one was pretty loud.

274
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,916
There's no way
he didn't hear you.

275
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,041
Pretty embarrassing, huh?

276
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,291
Ah... Why me?

277
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,541
Huh?

278
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,875
[MARIA]
What did I ever do to you?

279
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:35,500
[MAN gasps]

280
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,250
[LEVI] That's a nice
pose you've got there.

281
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,625
And he just turned around!

282
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:41,875
You really like to
put on a show, Maria!

283
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:45,333
[MARIA] It's not my fault.
I just want to be normal.

284
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:48,291
Too late for that now! Besides,
you were never "normal"

285
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:51,208
to begin with! There has
to be something about you

286
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,791
if you caught the attention
of a fallen angel!

287
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:56,666
I don't want
anyone's attention.

288
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,250
I don't care what
either of you do.

289
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:01,083
I just want to go
back to my home.

290
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:05,041
You don't have to do this.
I'm suffering enough.

291
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:08,916
[MARIA moans]

292
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,125
[LEVI] She chose you over anyone
and you can't even be happy?

293
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:14,250
You can't even appreciate it?

294
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,416
I would give anything
for what you have!

295
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,875
I'm boiling with envy!
It's consuming me!

296
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:24,083
Envy, and anger,
and contempt for you!

297
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:26,125
[MARIA moans]

298
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,041
[LEVI] I don't know
what else to do.

299
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,875
All I want is for her
to smile at me!

300
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:34,291
Why you?
Am I not good enough?

301
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:37,958
[LEVI, MINA] Is there
something wrong with me?

302
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:40,750
[MINA] I mean, I'm just as cute
as her and just as nice.

303
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,916
What am I missing?

304
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,583
I never thought I was the
jealous type, but jeez...

305
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:48,958
What can I do? It's not like
I can be somebody else.

306
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:52,416
It's nobody's fault, but I'm
gonna end up resenting her.

307
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,041
I don't know.

308
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:58,416
I've never had strong
feelings for anyone before.

309
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,291
[MARIA]
I'm jealous too.

310
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:04,875
It must be nice to have a
person who you love so much.

311
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:07,125
Are you crazy?

312
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:09,375
[MARIA] Maybe I'm just glad
that humans and demons aren't

313
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,000
so different. I don't think
there's anything wrong with

314
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:14,500
wanting something, and I don't
think there's anything wrong

315
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:18,041
with you for wanting it.
Even if it doesn't make sense.

316
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:21,875
You can't help...
who you are, right?

317
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:23,083
[LEVI gasps]

318
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:25,583
Why are you telling me this?

319
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:28,416
[MARIA] It'll work out
one way or another.

320
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,916
[LEVI gasps]

321
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,041
[MARIA] Instead of being
angry, just be yourself.

322
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:39,166
Stop it! Don't act
like we're the same!

323
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,250
Envy is a mortal sin!
Stop trying to justify it!

324
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:46,291
It's not a sin.
I think it's only human.

325
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:51,250
No! What are you saying?
I-I don't wanna hear this!

326
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,458
[LEVI squeals]

327
00:20:57,125 --> 00:21:01,500
[LEVI] What's going on?
That was you this entire time?

328
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:10,708
[LUCIFER]
I think you lost this one.

329
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,916
[LUCIFER] You may be the
self-proclaimed Demon Lord

330
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,916
of Envy, but this human
had something to teach you

331
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,541
about the sin
you're so proud of.

332
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,166
Either way, I don't
want you laying

333
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,583
a finger on her again.
You understand?

334
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:28,041
[MARIA gasps]

335
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:32,000
[LEVI] If that's what
you want. I'm sorry.

336
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,416
It's fine. Maybe that
wasn't fun for you,

337
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,416
but I had a blast watching.

338
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:41,958
Finally awake, are you?
Feeling better now?

339
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:43,541
Yeah, I think so...

340
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:46,333
[LUCIFER] Good.
Then let me try this.

341
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,833
Whoa, hey, what are you doing?

342
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:56,333
Focus, okay? I need you
to find something for me.

343
00:21:56,416 --> 00:22:01,375
[MARIA gasps, moans]

344
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:11,458
[MARIA]
I think I see something.

345
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:14,625
[LUCIFER] What is it, Maria?
Tell me. Where?

346
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,166
[MARIA gasps]

347
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,916
It's Miami!

348
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,875
All right, let's get moving!

349
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:27,500
What are we gonna do?

350
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:30,583
We're leaving.

351
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:32,500
To Miami?
