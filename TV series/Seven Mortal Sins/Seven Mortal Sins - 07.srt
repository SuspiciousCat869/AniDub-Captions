[ANNOUNCER]
Welcome to Gourmet Nouveau,

3
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:03,083
here in the heart of Paris, the
culinary capital of the world!

4
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:05,333
Our host tonight
in this feast of pleasures

5
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:07,375
is none other than Beelzebub,
the Queen of Gluttony!

6
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:09,666
[FOLLOWERS] We thank you for
this meal, Beelzebub.

7
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,000
Welcome one, welcome all, to a
feast you won't soon forget.

8
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:17,416
Together we shall eat to our
fill and celebrate the joys of--

00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,166
[LUCIFER laughs]
What a joke.

10
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,416
Even for a demon, your party
is terribly low-class.

11
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,125
Don't you have any shame?

12
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:29,958
When it comes to pigs, I guess
they'll swallow anything.

13
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:32,416
Lu... Lucifer?

14
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,166
I'm sure my invite was lost in
the mail, so I just dropped by.

15
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,541
You know what I've been up
to lately, so I'll spare you

16
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:42,541
the whole backstory.
Let's cut straight to the chase.

17
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:45,000
I came here because
I want to fight.

18
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:46,458
Right now?

19
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:48,791
Don't look so scared,
I prefer to beat my opponents

20
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:51,875
at their own game, so to speak.
Since you've got the food

21
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:55,250
all laid out, I challenge you
to an eating contest!

22
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:57,208
But I... uh...

23
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:58,916
[ANNOUNCER] Did you hear that,
ladies and gentlemen?

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,666
What a rare opportunity!

25
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:04,166
Beelzebub is going to show us
the true meaning of gluttony!

26
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:09,208
No, wait...

She sure is adorable,
isn't she? There's no contest.

33
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:01,541
I mean, when it comes to
eating too, of course. Ah--!

34
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,041
[LUCIFER]
Mmm...

35
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,916
She's really
savoring every bite!

36
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,916
When you're done
with that, eat me too!

37
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,958
I can think of plenty of places
your tongue would love!

[audience gasps]

39
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:22,416
What? You gain followers
by stealing their hearts.

40
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,791
Every demon lord knows that.

41
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,750
We're just eating,
aren't we?

42
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,458
Of course.

43
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:36,291
[LEVI giggles] Lucifer's
got this in the bag!

44
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:37,833
Let's hope.

45
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,166
[LUCIFER]
M-My stomach...

46
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,208
[MARIA]
What's wrong?

47
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:48,208
You can do it--
just hang in there!

48
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:50,000
[ANNOUNCER] With only
five minutes to spare,

49
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:53,125
Beelzebub gets a second wind!
Seems like slow and steady

50
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:57,041
wins the gourmet race as well!
Let's watch the master at work!

51
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:01,166
[LUCIFER groans]
I'm not done.

52
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,458

I gotta go.

00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:21,791
Hey, wait!

00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,333
Let's go!

00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:32,708
[LUCIFER] This is stupid!
What is going on here?

64
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:36,541
[LUCIFER] Ow... Why?
It's just food!

[BEELZE retches]

66
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,750
Oh, geez, not you too. Hasn't
there been enough puking today?

[LUCIFER gasps, moans]

68
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,750
You really like
to scare us, huh?

69
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,583
I'm glad you're awake!

70
00:05:57,666 --> 00:06:02,583
Where am I? What's this?
What happened?

71
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,333
[LUCIFER]
Who the hell are you?

72
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:09,125
We took you to a hospital.

73
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:12,041
You don't remember passing
out in the bathroom?

74
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:15,833
Passing out? Mm...

75
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,000
[LUCIFER gasps]

76
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:20,125
How pathetic.
I just ate too much!

77
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:21,916
It's a bit more than that.

78
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,250
It appears that you're
suffering from a stomach flu.

79
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,583
A stomach flu?

80
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:30,250
I'm afraid we can't send
you back home just yet.

81
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,833
I have a number of
tests I'd like to run.

82
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:37,666
I need someone to fill out your
paperwork--a relative, perhaps?

83
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,166
Huh? Why me?

84
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,666
Because we don't know
any other humans here.

85
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,666
Fair enough.

86
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,958
Uh, yeah. I guess I'm
kinda like a relative.

87
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:48,750
In that case,
please come along.

88
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,833
You're doing her
a favor, trust me.

89
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:52,375
It's a whole stack
of documents.

90
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:53,916
You'll want to
sit down for this.

91
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,875
Sounds like fun.

[DOCTOR]
Maria Totsuka.

94
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,291
What exactly is your
relationship to the patient?

95
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,375
Well, uh...
It's complicated,

96
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:10,208
but we'll be stuck
together for a while.

97
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:11,875
[DOCTOR]
Oh, what a shame.

98
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:15,083
You mean...
I can't do this after all?

99
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:18,083
I'm not worried about the
papers--I'm worried about her.

100
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:19,958
Having the right person
by her side can be

101
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:24,416
even more important than having
the right doctor. Understand?

102
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,541
I think she'll be okay.

103
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:30,333
It's true, we do have kind
of a strange relationship,

104
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:34,416
but we get along pretty well
most of the time. And...

105
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,916
...she's pretty tough.
A little flu won't beat her.

106
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:42,208
Sorry, ma'am, but I need you
to take those big horns

107
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:44,125
out of your hair
before we get started.

108
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:45,958
You can see them?

[DOCTOR B]
Uh-huh...

110
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:56,083
Oh, actually, you can keep
them on. They're fine.

[MALE DOCTOR A]
Hm. This is weird.

112
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:02,375
It's showing two heartbeats.
That's not right.

113
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:05,583
[LUCIFER] These people
aren't helping.

114
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:08,125
They're just getting on my
nerves. I don't have enough

magic right now to stop
all their stupid questions.

[MARIA gasps]
You okay?

117
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:16,041
I can't believe I need
a human to help me walk.

118
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:19,250
It's nice.
For me, at least.

119
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,000
What? Nice how?

120
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,916
[MARIA laughs]
Never mind.

121
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:34,666
How did I end up like this?
What a mess.

I'm crammed in here with all
these filthy, dying humans,

125
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,791
and this bed
is like a coffin!

126
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:47,083
It's a pain in the ass.

I'm used to partying all night.

You expect me to go to sleep
like somebody's grandmother?

Screw this!

Is there something wrong?

133
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,833
[LUCIFER] Yeah, everything!
How am I supposed to sleep

134
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:10,375
with all this noise? I asked for
a private room! What gives?

135
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,625
Sorry, but it's
doctor's orders.

136
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,208
What does that mean?

137
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,208
It's 'cause you're
a first-time patient.

138
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,500
It may be noisy,
but you're right next to

139
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:21,500
the nurse's station, so we're
here if you need anything.

I wonder what Maria and Levi
are up to right now.

144
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:39,500
Actually, I like the time alone.
It's been way too long.

145
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,416
This isn't like me at all.

You're late! What could
possibly be more important

00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,375
than coming to see me?

We couldn't get in before
visiting hours began

Excuses!

151
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:55,708
Here's a change of clothes
and a towel to wipe

152
00:09:55,791 --> 00:10:01,041
yourself down with. I'll take
out your IV in just a second.

I'll clean you up, don't worry!

I can clean myself, Levi!

This stupid thing's in the way!

Lucifer, take it easy!

157
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:13,250
Stop treating me like a child!
It's just a stomach ache!

When you're done,
give me a call, okay?

159
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:22,916
Thanks, we'll just be a sec.

160
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,875
And off comes your top!
Here we go!

161
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,375
Aah! No! Why is
that so hot? Ow!

162
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:34,083
You're grumpy.
What's the deal?

163
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,375
"Grumpy"?

164
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,041
[MARIA] Did you
have a bad night?

165
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,250
You bet I did!
This bed is rock hard,

166
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:42,166
the pillow isn't fluffy, there's
no room to stretch, it's noisy,

167
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,958
I had to go to bed at nine,
the jackass next to me

168
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,375
wouldn't stop coughing, and
nobody would listen to me!

169
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:48,291
[LUCIFER groans]

170
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:49,833
Is your stomach hurting?

171
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,583
Everything's going to be
fine--just try to relax!

172
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:56,083
You're a million years too young
to be lecturing me, Maria.

173
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,208
Damn it.

174
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:59,166
I'm not lecturing you;
I'm worried!

175
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,708
[LUCIFER groans]

176
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:03,833
[MARIA]
Oh, hello.

177
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:06,625
Seems the intravenous
analgesic didn't work.

178
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,666
We'll try a suppository.

179
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,416
Wait. What's that?

180
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,416
[DOCTOR]
Turn over, please.

181
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,291
Uh... Um, no thanks.

182
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,750
[DOCTOR] Don't be
difficult, please.

183
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:20,375
What are you
doing back there?

184
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,250
[LUCIFER wails]

185
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,333
[DOCTOR]
Now stay still.

186
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:28,333
[LUCIFER]
I... I'm not ready for this.

187
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:29,833
[LUCIFER wails]

188
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:32,458
Butt stuff!

189
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:34,333
[LUCIFER screams]

190
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:41,250
[DOCTOR] Call me if
the pain doesn't go away.

191
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,833
You okay?

192
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,583
[LUCIFER] This is
worse than Hell.

193
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:47,916
I've hit rock bottom.
I have nothing.

194
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,708
[LEVI]
Hey, don't say that.

195
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:52,166
[LUCIFER] Leave me
to my shame. Go home.

196
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,250
But, uh...

197
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:54,958
Go away.

198
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:59,041
[LEVI] That was funny,
but I feel bad.

199
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:01,875
I'll find a way to cheer
her up somehow!

200
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:14,791
[DOCTOR] Look at that,
out cold already.

201
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,625
[BELIAL] You never had a clue
it was me, did you?

202
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:23,333
Like taking candy
from a baby. Pathetic.

203
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,916
My Seven Commandments must
have done quite a number

204
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,708
on your magic for
this to happen.

205
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:34,208
What's your true endgame?

206
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:37,125
What lies beyond
your petty revenge?

207
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:41,083
I'll draw those secrets
from your body itself.

208
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:44,375
Let thy flesh relinquish what
thy tongue keeps hidden.

209
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:48,666
[BELIAL chants]

210
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,333
[BELIAL chuckles]

211
00:12:56,416 --> 00:13:00,208
My goodness, quite the
secret you had tucked away!

212
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:06,166
A heart? It's not yours.
Ah, must be that human girl's.

213
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:08,958
[LUCIFER groans]

214
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,750
Oh, no! It's gone!

215
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:15,541
Belial! Must be! Who else?

216
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:18,250
[MARIA] They said your
doctor quit all of a sudden.

217
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,791
[LUCIFER]
I see.

218
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,416
[LUCIFER] I was
far too careless.

219
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,041
Belial played me for a fool.

220
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:28,958
I doubt she knows the secret
of Maria's heart just yet,

221
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,708
but I'd better think of
a way to get it back soon.

222
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:35,541
In the meantime, let's hope
Maria doesn't find anything out.

223
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,750
[MARIA]
Lucifer. Are you okay?

224
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:40,750
Your stomach hurt?

225
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,291
[LUCIFER]
No, I'm fine.

226
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,916
You sure? If something's wrong,
we should call a nurse over.

227
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,958
Don't try to tough it out.

228
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:51,250
[LUCIFER] It's nothing.
I was just thinking.

229
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,916
It looks like you've got
a new neighbor moving in.

230
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,458
[LUCIFER]
Mm?

231
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:57,666
Anyway, I'll go have a chat
with the replacement doctor

232
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,458
and see if they need any
more tests. Levi should have

233
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:03,166
a change of panties for
you when she stops by.

234
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,666
Maria.

235
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,375
Uh-huh?

236
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:07,958
[LUCIFER sighs]

237
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:11,333
I'm sorry to impose on you like
this, for such a silly thing.

238
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:12,875
No big deal.

239
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:15,583
[LUCIFER] Although I guess
I'm imposing on you all time,

240
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:17,458
dragging you
into this mess.

241
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:20,083
[MARIA gasps]
You're acting weird.

242
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:23,041
Did they put you on a
new drug or something?

243
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,916
I was trying to say
"thank you"--is that so weird?

244
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,208
It sure is. I think all this
bed rest is hurting your pride,

245
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:33,000
but you'll be back to your
old self soon. I hope.

246
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,541
Ugh, gimme a break.

247
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,041
[LUCIFER] I just need to beat
the rest of the Mortal Sins.

248
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:42,166
My pride and her heart will take
care of themselves after that.

249
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,833
[NURSE] This medicine should
help your gastric dilation.

250
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,333
I don't think we'll
have to operate,

251
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:49,041
but I'm afraid you won't be
eating solids for a while.

252
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:51,750
[LUCIFER] Lot of stomach
problems going around.

253
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:54,916
[NURSE] Let me know if you
need anything, Miss Beelzebub.

254
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,583
[LUCIFER]
Hm? Beelzebub?

255
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:59,166
[BEELZE belches]

256
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,625
[LUCIFER]
That was one dangerous meal!

257
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,750
[LUCIFER] Come to think of it,
she was burping an awful lot

258
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:05,500
after the eating contest.

259
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,791
Even the Demon Lord of
Gluttony couldn't handle it!

260
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,500
I did good after all!

261
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,625
Hey, neighbor, you okay?

262
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:12,875
[BEELZE]
Um, yeah.

263
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:15,208
Tummy problems, huh?
I hear ya.

264
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,833
I got hit with a
nasty stomach flu.

265
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,875
[BEELZE] Then you
can't eat, either?

266
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:21,875
Not a bite! I haven't
eaten in days,

267
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:24,500
so I'm getting totally hangry.

268
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:26,625
[BEELZE] All I can
think about is food.

269
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,291
You must have one
heck of an appetite

270
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:31,291
to say that when your
belly is about to pop!

271
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:32,666
[BEELZE]
Food isn't the bad guy.

272
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:33,916
[LUCIFER]
Hm?

273
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,958
[BEELZE] Food makes you
smile when you're sad.

274
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:39,166
Food's a good friend
I can't wait to see again.

275
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,333
Can't argue there.

276
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:43,333
[LUCIFER chuckles]

277
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:44,750
Whoa! Lucifer!

278
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,541
[BEELZE belches]

279
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,583
[MARIA]
What's going on?

280
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:50,375
[LUCIFER laughs]

281
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,416
It's okay, guys, she's cool.

282
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,375
Turns out she comes
to this hospital a lot,

283
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:57,291
so she was sharing some
tips with me, right?

284
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:58,541
[BEELZE giggles]

285
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,833
[LEVI groans]

286
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,750
[LEVI] Nice that they finally
let you use the bath!

287
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,666
[LUCIFER]
I can do that myself.

288
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,166
Nuh-uh, the nurses said
that you need a bath buddy.

289
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,375
So I'm gonna scrub
every inch of you.

290
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:20,458
[LUCIFER moans]

291
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:23,083
[LUCIFER] My boobs are
clean enough now, I think.

292
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:25,583
[LEVI giggles]
You don't like it?

293
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,625
No, I really don't.

294
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,458
[LEVI] You only get to
have one demon girlfriend,

295
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:34,125
and that's me! I don't
like you getting all cozy

296
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,875
with that shrimp, Beelzebub!

297
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:39,333
You're making me angry!

298
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:42,916
[LEVI]
Too bad! I'm not letting go!

299
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,041
That's enough! What's gotten
into you? Maria, come help me!

300
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,750
If you don't like me,
then say so!

301
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:51,583
It's not fair! I give you
everything I've got,

302
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:54,250
but I don't get
anything from you!

303
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:57,500
Do you have any idea how
lonely that makes me feel?

304
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,750
Levi...

305
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,666
[LEVI]
This is all wrong.

306
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,791
Ever since you fell from
Heaven, I've been trying

307
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:07,000
my best to help, but now
I don't know what to do!

308
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:10,375
I'm dumb, okay? You have
to spell stuff out to me!

309
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:12,041
I don't think you
treat me very fairly,

310
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,958
but I don't want
to go back to Hell!

311
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:18,291
I want to stay with you!
I love you!

312
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:19,541
I know.

313
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:22,000
[LEVI]
Do you hate me?

314
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:25,583
Of course not.
Don't be ridiculous.

315
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,125
[LEVI]
You mean it?

316
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,333
[LUCIFER] Don't expect
this every night, okay?

317
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:34,458
[LEVI] Okay. I'm
so happy, though.

318
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:37,291
All my worries are melting away.

319
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,416
When're you gonna grow up?

320
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:45,875
[LEVI groans]

321
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,958
[LUCIFER] Ugh, gross!
You have got to be kidding me!

322
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:54,625
When I get out of here,
I'm gonna wring your neck!

323
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,291
I finally get to
eat some actual food,

324
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,916
and it's just some
crappy porridge?

325
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,708
Ahh! So yummy.

326
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,583
What? You like this?

327
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,166
When you haven't
eaten in forever,

328
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,875
the first bite is bliss.
Hello again, old friend.

329
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:13,125
I'm skeptical, but...

330
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:16,125
Mm! Actually, even if
the taste is bland,

331
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:18,750
the sensation is rather nice.

332
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:20,291
[BEELZE chuckles]

333
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:28,125
Ahh... I'd be a lot happier
if I had some meat.

334
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,583
It's good, though.

335
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,708
You don't want
something more?

336
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:34,708
What else do I need?
The porridge part is sweet,

337
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:38,458
but the side dishes it comes
with are salty. It's ecstasy.

338
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:41,000
[LUCIFER]
Huh. Let's see...

339
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,416
That is pretty good.

340
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,500
Told you!

341
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,416
I don't get it.
This is just porridge.

342
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,125
That's the whole point.

343
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:53,708
I'm really lost here.

344
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:56,875
Porridge is simple--
a little bland--

345
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:59,458
but that's why the other
flavors stand out.

346
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:02,666
Oh, I see. For someone who's
been robbed of flavor for days,

347
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:06,541
it feels so refreshing to have
them come back, one by one.

348
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,625
So, you finally get it, huh?

349
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:10,791
What makes you the Demon Lord
of Gluttony, though?

350
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:11,791
[BEELZE]
Hm?

351
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:13,666
Doesn't make sense to me.

352
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,750
A real glutton doesn't
appreciate the little things.

353
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:18,208
[BEELZE]
Aww...

354
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,125
And what? Do you have to go
to the hospital every time

355
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:23,666
you decide to binge on food?
If you're a demon lord,

356
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,875
shouldn't you have
magic to fix that?

357
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,375
I think it's fun.

358
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,250
At the hospital?

359
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,583
I got to make friends
with you, at least.

360
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,500
And the porridge is nice, too.

361
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,041
[LUCIFER]
Ah...

362
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,208
Quite the coincidence that
we were both discharged

363
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:44,750
from the hospital at
the exact same time.

364
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,916
I hope you didn't
have too bad a time.

365
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,666
[LUCIFER chuckles]
It's no vacation.

366
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,708
I do not approve of
this stupid arrangement!

367
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:52,666
What the hell is she doing here?

368
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,833
They must've planned
this together.

369
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:57,666
[LUCIFER]
Humans really are stupid.

370
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:01,333
They eat to live, but eat
too much and it's a sin?

371
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:04,416
That just makes you want to do
it more, though, doesn't it?

372
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,708
I love food, and I love
to share it, too.

373
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:11,083
I want people to be able
to eat to their fill.

374
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,750
[LUCIFER] Humans always turn it
into too much of a good thing.

375
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,500
[BEELZE]
I did too, at first.

376
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:18,833
But even if you eat and eat,
you'll never be satisfied

377
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:21,958
until you understand
what makes food special.

378
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,833
[LUCIFER]
Okay, let's dig in.

379
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:28,875
Smells great!

380
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,375
[BEELZE sniffs]

381
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,458
It's not a contest, right?

382
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:35,166
[LUCIFER]
More like a game.

383
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,250
I serve you the meat and you
have to savor every bite.

384
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:39,958
Simple enough?

385
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:42,500
[BEELZE]
Uh-huh. Sounds like fun.

386
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:46,250
[BEELZE]
Mmm...

387
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:49,250
You really know a thing
or two about meat, don't you?

388
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,875
I guess so.

389
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,083
[BEELZE] By the way,
you can have my throne in Hell.

390
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:54,291
I don't mind.

391
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:55,291
[MARIA gasps]

392
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:56,791
How am I supposed
to enjoy my meal

393
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,166
when they're
getting all cozy?

394
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,375
I don't need your throne.
When this is over with,

395
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:03,291
it'll all be meaningless,
you wait and see.

396
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,333
Today, we're celebrating
our good health.

397
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:06,333
Okay!

398
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:08,708
Here you go--say "ah"!

399
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:11,833
Ah--! More, more!

400
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:14,958
Okay, Bub. But just one
bite at a time, got it?

401
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,166
[BEELZE]
Mm...

402
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:19,666
[LEVI] Lucifer. Why are
you so cruel to me?

403
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,125
What does she mean
it'll be meaningless?

404
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:24,250
[BEELZE] Thanks for
the food, Lucifer.

405
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:27,708
[LUCIFER] I hope you like
the chain, too. Little Bub.

406
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:31,291
[BEELZE] Yeah. It goes
perfect with my collar.

407
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:32,458
You keep doing what you're doing

408
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,875
and let me handle
the complicated stuff.

409
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:37,958
[BEELZE]
Okay. I'll be waiting.

410
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:43,083
Ever hungry...
for your return to Hell.

411
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:44,791
[BEELZE giggles]

412
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:46,625
All right, ladies,
let's walk off those calories

413
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:49,791
while we plan our next move.

414
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,541
Come on, Levi.
Stop whining.

415
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:54,666
[LEVI]
Anything for you!

416
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,208
[MARIA gasps]

417
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,291
Oh, I didn't see you!
My friend is better now!

418
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:06,250
[MARIA]
What happened? I can't move!

419
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,125
[MARIA]
No. It can't be...

420
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:21,333
What's up? Did she leave?

421
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,000
[LUCIFER]
Belial!
