then leave already!
And don't come back!

159
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,583
[MARIA sighs]

160
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,250
[MARIA]
Another one?

161
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,541
This is a soul contract!

162
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:14,333
[MAMMON]
It seems that somebody

163
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:17,208
still hasn't learned
their lesson.

164
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,666
[MARIA gasps]

165
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,125
[MAMMON] If you agree
with all the details,

166
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:32,333
sign at the bottom here
and we're almost done.

167
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:38,041
[MARIA] What did she do?
I can't move.

168
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,208
All right, one more.

169
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:45,041
[MAMMON] Splendid.
Everything's in order now.

170
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:47,666
Here's your elixir,
as promised.

171
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:55,666
All I have to do is drink it?

172
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:59,666
That's right, dear, and all
of your dreams will come true.

173
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,583
After all this time.
Thank you, Mammon.

174
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,750
Good! Every last drop!

175
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:09,250
Now follow me this way,
if you would.

176
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:16,958
Right here. Step inside.

177
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:19,208
Of course. As you wish.

178
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:30,833
Now, you're next. We have a very
important matter to discuss.

179
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:38,333
I release your restraints.

180
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:40,500
[MARIA gasps]
I'm free?

181
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,708
[MAMMON] What exactly
is the relationship

182
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:46,333
between you and Lucifer?

183
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:49,333
Why would a human
accompany a fallen angel?

184
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:50,958
[MARIA]
Well, uh...

185
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,000
[MARIA]
Should I tell her?

186
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:58,125
I can't tell how evil she is.
She seems reasonable enough.

187
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:01,083
It must be quite the secret
if you won't tell me.

188
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,833
[MARIA]
No. She's still a demon lord.

189
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,916
There's no telling what she's
hiding beneath that smile.

190
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:16,041
I think I understand now.
That must be awful.

191
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:19,583
[MARIA] Does she know
about my heart? How?

192
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,208
[MAMMON] Lucifer
slapped your hand away

193
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:25,250
to hide the truth from me,
but I figured it out.

194
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,125
[MARIA]
That's why she did it?

195
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:29,166
[MAMMON]
You're just a victim.

196
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:33,166
Lucifer took something precious
from you, didn't she?

197
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:39,000
But you don't have to worry
anymore. Come closer. Here.

198
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:40,541
[MARIA gasps]

199
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:46,916
It's all right. Don't be shy.
I can make you whole again.

200
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,041
I trust you. My worries
are melting away.

201
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:56,833
[MARIA] Somehow...
this feels right.

202
00:13:56,916 --> 00:14:00,041
Good. Drink your fill of me.

203
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:03,916
Then, like the others,
you'll find joy in serving me.

204
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,541
You'll find peace in caring
for my dear children.

205
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:13,333
Not here. Better hurry.

206
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:26,500
[LEVI]
Ugh! Where are you?

207
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:30,416
[LUCIFER screams]

208
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,583
Was that her?

209

Damn it! Aahh!

213
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:48,500
Don't worry--
I'll save you!

214
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:49,833
[LUCIFER moans]

215
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,458
Don't you dare help me!

216
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:53,916
[LUCIFER moans]

217
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,791
If I can't do this on my own,
then all of this is pointless.

218
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,708
Are you sure?

219
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:03,125
Don't worry about me;
I'll be fine!

220
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,500
It's more important to
take care of Maria!

221
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,750
Not a chance!
I'm staying!

222
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:11,791
Mm...! I can't stop you.
But one thing, okay?

223
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:13,166
This is kind of embarrassing,

224
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,750
so would you quit
staring at me, please?

225
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:30,125
[BABY giggling]

[BABY giggling]

230
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:49,625
Uh-oh. This does not look good.
Did I go to Hell?

231
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:57,333
[LUCIFER] Agh!
Damn son of a bitch. Dammit!

[LUCIFER wails]

234
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,250
Seems like she's
really suffering.

235
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,041
But all the moaning
and sweaty clothes

236
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:09,541
and hair clinging to her is
kinda hot. Actually, super hot.

237
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:12,083
I know envy is kind of my
thing, but I never thought

238
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:15,625
I'd be jealous of a stupid,
inanimate horse!

239

[LEVI groans]

240
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,458
I'm here!
If I can't save you,

241
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,708
I can at least suffer
by your side!

242
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:23,208
As long as we're together,
no pain is too great!

243
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:26,416
I won't let that horse
get the better of us!

244
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,291
[LEVI screams]

245

[LEVI screams]

247
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:35,083
Stop moving!

[LEVI moans]

What's that you're holding?

253
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:57,541
He's my sweet little boy. I have
to take special care of him.

254
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:00,333
There's no way that
thing is her child.

255
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:02,000
Listen.

256
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:04,291
You have to get out of here!

257
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:07,625
Those aren't your babies
you're holding! It's a trick!

[BABY cries]

259
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,416
I'm so sorry.
Please don't cry.

[BABY cries]

00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,000
[MARIA]
Uh, there, there.

262
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:23,833
Good... boy? Girl?
Just be quiet, okay?

263
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:25,083
[MAMMON]
They asked for happiness

264
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:27,750
and that's exactly
what I gave them.

265
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:30,541
[BABY coos]
Mama...

266
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,958
[MAMMON chuckles]
See their smiles?

267
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:35,500
This is all they ever
needed in the whole world.

268
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:40,583
To offer up their love to these
children, for all eternity!

269
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,291
[MARIA]
Your children?

270
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,375
It's fine; they don't
know any better.

271
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:47,708
I've made them think they're
caring for their own children.

272
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:50,375
[MARIA] Why would you
do something like that?

273
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:52,375
[MAMMON]
For profit, of course.

274
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:55,750
I've taken all of their assets.
They don't need them anymore.

275
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:59,000
It was all in the contract.
Nothing shady about it.

276
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,541
[MARIA gasps]

277
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:04,458
[MARIA] That's what
those papers were!

278
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:09,541
Mm. My husband left me with
an unimaginable debt, you see.

279
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:14,625
As well as 500,000 children
I have to raise all on my own.

280
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:18,625
That requires a tremendous
amount of resources.

281
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:20,125
You cheated them!

282
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:21,541
[MAMMON]
The children are happy.

283
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:24,250
The mothers are happy
and I'm happy.

284
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:25,666
What else matters?

285
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,791
Now that you're here,
you'll be happy as well.

286
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,125
I refuse. This isn't right.

287
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:32,500
[MAMMON]
In what way?

288
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:34,375
[MARIA] I can't criticize you
for wanting the best

289
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:37,208
for your kids or for
trying to get out of debt.

290
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:41,041
But look! Your children
want their real mother!

291
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,375
[MAMMON]
Whatever for?

292
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:45,208
The human concept of
babysitting works just fine!

293
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,791
The mother might
feel that way, sure.

294
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:49,291
But what about the child?

295
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,750
This one was crying
until you showed up.

296
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:54,333
It knows who its mother is!

297
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,750
No one can take your place.
They need you!

298
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:01,375
What choice do I have?

299
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:04,500
I'm a working woman. I don't
have time for family, too.

300
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:07,500
[MARIA] I don't care if
you're a demon. A mother needs

301
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:10,208
to be with her children,
no matter what it takes!

302
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:13,416
Love will always find a way!

[MARIA pants]

309
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:36,500
You have to let them go.

310
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:39,375
Even if it's tough,
there must be a better way.

311
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:43,250
You're asking me to break my
contract when they're happy?

312
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,791
[MARIA]
They seem happy.

313
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:47,375
But deep down, they're probably
just scared or running away

314
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:50,916
from something painful in
their life. Isn't that sad?

315
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,458
How is that my problem?
And what gives you

316
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:54,958
the right to decide
what they need,

317
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:58,250
especially when it's contrary
to their own wishes?

318
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,708
That's arrogance.
Foolish pride.

319
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:03,375
Did you say "pride"?

320
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,500
[LUCIFER]
You called?

321
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:11,375
Are you taking after me now?
Aren't you so cute?

322
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,083
Lucifer, you're okay!

323
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,875
Mammon. This fight is over.

324
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:18,291
Your torture room
barely slowed me down.

325
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,666
More unfounded pride!

326
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,375
All right, then. I can go
another round, if you like.

327
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,750
Of course!
I won't be satisfied

328
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:29,416
until I bleed you
for every last penny!

329
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:42,708
[MAMMON]
Ah! My shop!

330
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,708
Don't let it burn! You win.

331
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:49,208
This started with
a broken window;

332
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,208
it should end with one too.

333
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,375
[MAMMON]
No! Don't!

334
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:54,666
Augh! My money!

335
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:01,250
This is so lame. I finally
get alone time with Luci,

336
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:02,875
then she makes me rescue you.

337
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,125
Thank you, anyway.

338
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:06,541
Well, you did help me
find her, so I suppose

339
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:09,083
that's enough to spare
your life this time.

340
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:14,291
All my precious things!

341
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,750
[MAMMON groans]

342
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:23,708
I assume I won't
be needing this.

343
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:30,000
[indistinct chatter]

344
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:39,166
You're free.

345
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:42,416
[LEVI] Can we eat now?
I'm starving!

346
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,041
[LUCIFER] Maria, what's
famous around here?

347
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:47,208
[MARIA]
Fish and chips, I guess?

348
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:50,000
[LUCIFER] Mm... You think
that'll be good?

349
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:52,541
[MARIA]
Uh... I hope so.

350
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:04,125
Now Mammon has fallen?
I'm gonna strangle you, Lucifer!

351
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:10,041
[MAN] Your cryptocurrency
is catching on splendidly.

352
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:13,666
You were right again, milady.

353
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,916
[MAN 4A] The era of
the Mammoncoin has begun.

354
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,666
Heh. There's truly no end
to human greed, is there?

355
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,458
I'm grateful for that.

356
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:26,083
After all, I can't let
my children go hungry.

357
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:29,125
And they're just as
greedy as their mother.
