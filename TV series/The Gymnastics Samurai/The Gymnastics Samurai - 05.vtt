Stay calm and focus.

00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:14.973 position:50% align:center
We've only got one week left.

00:00:15.056 --> 00:00:16.307 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:00:21.896 --> 00:00:24.774 position:50% align:center
[LEONARDO] Joe's battle is
right around the corner. Indeed!

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:27.110 position:50% align:center
Here we come, Sekigahara!

00:00:36.995 --> 00:00:39.247 position:50% align:center
[LEONARDO] Is there another
Sekigahara that day?

00:02:14.884 --> 00:02:16.761 position:50% align:center
Well, you're in
excellent condition.

00:02:17.637 --> 00:02:22.058 position:50% align:center
But this is the NHK Cup, and
it won't be an easy one for you.

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:24.310 position:50% align:center
You're going up against
the next generation.

00:02:24.394 --> 00:02:26.604 position:50% align:center
Young, talented gymnasts.

00:02:26.688 --> 00:02:30.066 position:50% align:center
Of course, Minamino'll be there.

00:02:31.067 --> 00:02:32.110 position:50% align:center
Work hard.

00:02:32.193 --> 00:02:34.195 position:50% align:center
Compete like you're
a beginner again.

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:36.781 position:50% align:center
Okay? Don't forget what
you've been training to--

00:02:36.865 --> 00:02:39.826 position:50% align:center
[phone rings]

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:42.078 position:50% align:center
It's okay. I'm listening
to every word.

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:42.746 position:50% align:center
I swear.

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.831 position:50% align:center
Go on. Get it!

00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:47.459 position:50% align:center
[REI]
Will it be another late one?

00:02:47.542 --> 00:02:51.171 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Amakusa and I need
to talk some after practice,

00:02:51.254 --> 00:02:53.423 position:50% align:center
so I should be
home just before eight.

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:57.594 position:50% align:center
[REI] Got it. Dinner will
be ready and waiting!

00:02:57.677 --> 00:02:59.304 position:50% align:center
So, next week.

00:02:59.387 --> 00:03:00.638 position:50% align:center
Rei's coming, right?

00:03:00.722 --> 00:03:03.808 position:50% align:center
Yes. She's so excited.

00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:05.810 position:50% align:center
I can't disappoint her.

00:03:05.894 --> 00:03:06.936 position:50% align:center
[AMAKUSA]
Matter of fact.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.397 position:50% align:center
I invited my daughter, too.

00:03:09.481 --> 00:03:11.232 position:50% align:center
And this was her response.

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:16.321 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
Oh, that's, uh...

00:03:16.404 --> 00:03:17.864 position:50% align:center
Unbelievable, huh?

00:03:17.947 --> 00:03:20.241 position:50% align:center
Extorting her own father!

00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:22.285 position:50% align:center
So, this is what I said.

00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:27.540 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
Wow. Um, okay.

00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:30.377 position:50% align:center
Do I go too easy on her?

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.545 position:50% align:center
I do, don't I?

00:03:33.922 --> 00:03:38.760 position:50% align:center
[LEONARDO]

[REI]
Boo! You can't end in "n"!

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:52.941 position:50% align:center
[LEONARDO]
No! I've lost!

00:03:53.024 --> 00:03:55.402 position:50% align:center
[REI]
Which means I win!

00:03:55.485 --> 00:03:57.779 position:50% align:center
It's amazing how much
you've picked up, Leo.

00:03:57.862 --> 00:04:00.240 position:50% align:center
You started living
with us in November, right?

00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:02.617 position:50% align:center
I can't believe
it's been six whole months!

00:04:02.701 --> 00:04:06.162 position:50% align:center
Yes. Fun makes time fly, indeed.

00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:07.497 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.917 position:50% align:center
Rachel, is something
happening on July 5th?

00:04:11.001 --> 00:04:12.627 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:12.711 --> 00:04:15.213 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you could say that.

00:04:15.296 --> 00:04:17.173 position:50% align:center
It's actually my birthday!

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:19.592 position:50% align:center
Really? Are you
going to celebrate?

00:04:19.676 --> 00:04:20.635 position:50% align:center
Yep!

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:22.929 position:50% align:center
Our family has a
very important rule.

00:04:23.013 --> 00:04:24.139 position:50% align:center
No matter what,

00:04:24.222 --> 00:04:27.225 position:50% align:center
we spend the entire day
together on birthdays.

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:35.233 position:50% align:center
[REI] Which means Dad'll be
home, even if he's really busy.

00:04:35.316 --> 00:04:36.192 position:50% align:center
No exceptions.

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:39.237 position:50% align:center
That's what Mom decided.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.489 position:50% align:center
Sounds like a great birthday.

00:04:46.995 --> 00:04:50.415 position:50% align:center
[REI] This year, um,
will you celebrate with us?

00:04:50.498 --> 00:04:51.708 position:50% align:center
[LEONARDO]
Huh?

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:53.251 position:50% align:center
Well, I mean,

00:04:53.335 --> 00:04:58.340 position:50% align:center
it's just that these days
you're like family.

00:04:58.423 --> 00:04:59.758 position:50% align:center
You know?

00:05:01.926 --> 00:05:04.346 position:50% align:center
Family?

00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:07.182 position:50% align:center
So, do you want to?

00:05:08.516 --> 00:05:10.310 position:50% align:center
Indeed, I would love that!

00:05:10.393 --> 00:05:11.686 position:50% align:center
It's a promise!

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:12.562 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:13.772 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:15.732 position:50% align:center
It's a promise, indeed!

00:05:18.943 --> 00:05:20.945 position:50% align:center
[REI] Break it and
you're subject to seppuku.

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:22.697 position:50% align:center
[LEONARDO]
Harakiri?

00:05:46.262 --> 00:05:47.305 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER A]
The day's finally here,

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:48.890 position:50% align:center
and what a beautiful one it is.

00:05:48.973 --> 00:05:51.810 position:50% align:center
Welcome to the 42nd NHK Cup!

00:05:51.893 --> 00:05:52.977 position:50% align:center
This year's competition

00:05:53.061 --> 00:05:56.231 position:50% align:center
has garnered more
attention than usual.

00:05:56.314 --> 00:05:58.650 position:50% align:center
All eyes are on the new
generation of young athletes

00:05:58.733 --> 00:06:00.985 position:50% align:center
hoping to restore Japan
to its former standing

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:04.906 position:50% align:center
in the gymnastics world
after years of disappointment.

00:06:06.825 --> 00:06:08.118 position:50% align:center
Where is he?

00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:09.744 position:50% align:center
[TAKIZAWA]
He's just doing his thing.

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:20.005 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:36.938 position:50% align:center
Hey there, Jotaro.
It's been a while.

00:06:37.022 --> 00:06:38.398 position:50% align:center
Coach Nakanomori!

00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:41.109 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's been a long time.

00:06:41.192 --> 00:06:42.527 position:50% align:center
Saw your press conference.

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.405 position:50% align:center
Your announcement
of non-retirement, I guess.

00:06:45.488 --> 00:06:48.533 position:50% align:center
You always did like to
surprise people, didn't you?

00:06:48.616 --> 00:06:50.035 position:50% align:center
It was almost as unexpected

00:06:50.118 --> 00:06:53.621 position:50% align:center
as when you announced your
marriage to a famous actress.

00:06:53.705 --> 00:06:54.956 position:50% align:center
Let go.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.875 position:50% align:center
[NAKANOMORI]
Come on, where are your manners?

00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.878 position:50% align:center
You should greet
your fellow athlete.

00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:02.756 position:50% align:center
That old man? I'll pass.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.509 position:50% align:center
Better keep moving.

00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:10.180 position:50% align:center
Don't want your shoulders
getting cold. Tetsu.

00:07:16.394 --> 00:07:17.687 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry about that.

00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:20.190 position:50% align:center
Guess I'm not the world's
most competent coach.

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:21.691 position:50% align:center
No, it's fine.

00:07:21.775 --> 00:07:25.570 position:50% align:center
He's still young yet, but
there's no doubting his talent.

00:07:25.653 --> 00:07:27.072 position:50% align:center
That and his drive will make him

00:07:27.155 --> 00:07:29.366 position:50% align:center
a true leader in
the gymnastics world.

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:31.368 position:50% align:center
Starting today.

00:07:38.708 --> 00:07:41.294 position:50% align:center
[LEONARDO] Oooo!
So this is Joe's battlefield.

00:07:41.378 --> 00:07:44.464 position:50% align:center
His Sekigahara is finally here!

00:07:44.547 --> 00:07:46.216 position:50% align:center
Now. Take this.

00:07:49.094 --> 00:07:51.304 position:50% align:center
Let's root for Dad
with everything we've got!

00:07:51.388 --> 00:07:53.473 position:50% align:center
Indeed, let's!

00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:57.185 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER A] The competitors
are entering now.

00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:01.731 position:50% align:center
Joining us as a commentator,

00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:04.567 position:50% align:center
is Olympic athlete
Takashi Kamimura.

00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:07.779 position:50% align:center
Are there any competitors
you're especially curious about?

00:08:07.862 --> 00:08:08.780 position:50% align:center
There are.

00:08:08.863 --> 00:08:10.073 position:50% align:center
Several of the
young gymnasts here

00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:12.117 position:50% align:center
have stood out in recent years.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.577 position:50% align:center
First up, we have
the third-place finisher

00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:18.707 position:50% align:center
from last year's nationals,
Jun Dojima of Houkokukai.

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:22.210 position:50% align:center
Then there's Shigeru Nishikiori
of Rittai University,

00:08:22.293 --> 00:08:25.088 position:50% align:center
who placed second
at nationals last year.

00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:28.633 position:50% align:center
And here is Hiroshi Okamachi
of Shirando University.

00:08:28.717 --> 00:08:32.137 position:50% align:center
He's the champion of both last
year's nationals and NHK Cup,

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:36.307 position:50% align:center
and the current leader in
Japanese men's gymnastics.

00:08:36.391 --> 00:08:38.101 position:50% align:center
However, he'll have
to defend his title

00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:40.061 position:50% align:center
against some
strong competitors--

00:08:40.145 --> 00:08:45.150 position:50% align:center
including rising star
Tetsuo Minamino of Play Sports.

00:08:45.233 --> 00:08:46.151 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER A]
He's popularly known as

00:08:46.234 --> 00:08:48.862 position:50% align:center
the "Bandana Prince" these days.

00:08:48.945 --> 00:08:49.904 position:50% align:center
[KAMIMURA]
He's grown dramatically

00:08:49.988 --> 00:08:51.990 position:50% align:center
as an athlete
over the past year.

00:08:52.073 --> 00:08:53.324 position:50% align:center
That growth is even
more impressive

00:08:53.408 --> 00:08:55.785 position:50% align:center
when you remember that
he's still in high school.

00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:58.955 position:50% align:center
People already see him as
a force to be reckoned with.

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:00.749 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER A] These
four are likely to be the ones

00:09:00.832 --> 00:09:03.543 position:50% align:center
vying for victory today.

00:09:03.626 --> 00:09:06.087 position:50% align:center
And Jotaro Aragaki
of Yotsuba Sports Club

00:09:06.171 --> 00:09:07.547 position:50% align:center
will also be competing,

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:10.383 position:50% align:center
months after his notorious
retirement press conference.

00:09:10.467 --> 00:09:12.886 position:50% align:center
Now, that could be interesting.

00:09:12.969 --> 00:09:15.805 position:50% align:center
He's been in a slump
for the past few years.

00:09:15.889 --> 00:09:18.099 position:50% align:center
Based on his performance
at the last nationals,

00:09:18.183 --> 00:09:21.144 position:50% align:center
he's likely to have a
tough fight ahead of him.

00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:23.229 position:50% align:center
Go, Dad! You've got this!

00:09:23.313 --> 00:09:26.399 position:50% align:center
Charge forth and fight
like the samurai you are, Joe!

00:09:26.483 --> 00:09:29.235 position:50% align:center
Takizawa, you rock! Good luck!

00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:33.615 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER A] Thirty-six
gymnasts are competing

00:09:33.698 --> 00:09:35.325 position:50% align:center
at this year's tournament.

00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:37.202 position:50% align:center
They have been
divided into groups of six

00:09:37.285 --> 00:09:39.204 position:50% align:center
and will rotate through events.

00:09:40.789 --> 00:09:42.457 position:50% align:center
Leading off the group
that's first on the floor

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:45.919 position:50% align:center
is Okamachi,
last year's champion.

00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:53.009 position:50% align:center
[KAMIMURA] He executes a sharp
roundoff before a double double!

00:09:53.093 --> 00:09:54.761 position:50% align:center
A powerful, E-level skill.

00:09:54.844 --> 00:09:57.055 position:50% align:center
And his landing was perfect.

00:09:57.138 --> 00:09:58.348 position:50% align:center
As a gymnast,

00:09:58.431 --> 00:10:00.850 position:50% align:center
Okamachi's hallmarks
are precision and finesse.

00:10:00.934 --> 00:10:03.269 position:50% align:center
He performs each skill
with great accuracy.

00:10:03.353 --> 00:10:07.023 position:50% align:center
Like this. Watch. There he goes.

00:10:13.154 --> 00:10:14.531 position:50% align:center
[KAMIMURA] See how his
toes point straight up

00:10:14.614 --> 00:10:16.449 position:50% align:center
at the ceiling
during his handstand?

00:10:16.533 --> 00:10:18.493 position:50% align:center
It's truly beautiful.

00:10:18.576 --> 00:10:19.661 position:50% align:center
Technical difficulty isn't

00:10:19.744 --> 00:10:22.122 position:50% align:center
the only consideration
in gymnastics.

00:10:22.205 --> 00:10:24.708 position:50% align:center
Correct posture during
execution is crucial, as well.

00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:27.711 position:50% align:center
The slightest mistake
there can result in a deduction.

00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:33.508 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER A] A magnificent
performance from Okamachi.

00:10:33.591 --> 00:10:35.385 position:50% align:center
We can expect a high score.

00:10:37.012 --> 00:10:39.472 position:50% align:center
There it is--9.475!

00:10:39.556 --> 00:10:41.016 position:50% align:center
A high score on his first event

00:10:41.099 --> 00:10:43.476 position:50% align:center
and a good start
at defending his title.

00:10:44.811 --> 00:10:46.062 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:10:46.146 --> 00:10:48.189 position:50% align:center
Next up, let's take
a look at the pommel horse.

00:10:48.273 --> 00:10:50.483 position:50% align:center
Go Dojima! Good luck!

00:10:53.194 --> 00:10:54.612 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER A]
Dojima executes a flair spindle

00:10:54.696 --> 00:10:56.656 position:50% align:center
into an E-level combination.

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:58.366 position:50% align:center
[KAMIMURA]
An excellent performance so far,

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:00.326 position:50% align:center
which is no surprise.

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:01.828 position:50% align:center
His technique on
this particular event

00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:04.205 position:50% align:center
has stood out since
his high school years.

00:11:04.289 --> 00:11:07.667 position:50% align:center
He's even been called the
"Child of the Pommel Horse."

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:10.086 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER A
9.425!

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:11.921 position:50% align:center
Another high score!

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:18.428 position:50% align:center
Over on the still rings--we
have Nishikiori.

00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:20.805 position:50% align:center
He goes from an L-cross Honma

00:11:20.889 --> 00:11:23.600 position:50% align:center
and pulls up with straight
arms into a Maltese cross.

00:11:23.683 --> 00:11:25.894 position:50% align:center
Good execution on
some difficult skills.

00:11:25.977 --> 00:11:27.354 position:50% align:center
Upper-body strength is crucial

00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:29.773 position:50% align:center
to maintaining one's
stability on the still rings.

00:11:29.856 --> 00:11:32.734 position:50% align:center
Just look at him.
Very impressive.

00:11:32.817 --> 00:11:36.071 position:50% align:center
His score should be
coming up shortly.

00:11:36.154 --> 00:11:40.867 position:50% align:center
9.45! Nishikiori scores a 9.45!

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:43.745 position:50% align:center
Okamachi, Nishikiori,
and Dojima are separated

00:11:43.828 --> 00:11:46.456 position:50% align:center
by a narrow margin
in the current standings.

00:11:46.539 --> 00:11:48.667 position:50% align:center
But despite their
excellent performances,

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:51.086 position:50% align:center
none of these
three hold the top spot.

00:11:51.169 --> 00:11:52.337 position:50% align:center
We knew it was possible,

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:54.255 position:50% align:center
but this is still
a surprising development.

00:11:54.339 --> 00:11:55.715 position:50% align:center
Leading the pack.

00:11:55.799 --> 00:11:57.967 position:50% align:center
It's Minamino!

00:11:58.051 --> 00:11:59.469 position:50% align:center
That's right!

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:01.513 position:50% align:center
In first place, outperforming
even last year's champion,

00:12:01.596 --> 00:12:03.723 position:50% align:center
is Tetsuo Minamino!

00:12:07.977 --> 00:12:09.688 position:50% align:center
[INTERVIEWER] Tell us:
How does it feel to be ranked

00:12:09.771 --> 00:12:12.107 position:50% align:center
ahead of the reigning
NHK Cup champion

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:14.401 position:50% align:center
after the first day
of competition?

00:12:14.484 --> 00:12:15.902 position:50% align:center
Who cares?

00:12:15.985 --> 00:12:19.906 position:50% align:center
In first place, we have
17-year-old Tetsuo Minamino.

00:12:19.989 --> 00:12:21.658 position:50% align:center
He has some strong competition,

00:12:21.741 --> 00:12:25.662 position:50% align:center
so we'll see if he's able to
hold onto his lead on day two.

00:12:26.538 --> 00:12:28.289 position:50% align:center
You're in 15th place!

00:12:30.083 --> 00:12:32.127 position:50% align:center
Your performance
was great today.

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:34.629 position:50% align:center
I mean it.
You did really well, Dad!

00:12:34.713 --> 00:12:35.964 position:50% align:center
Indeed, Joe.

00:12:36.047 --> 00:12:38.258 position:50% align:center
Even if you are ranked low,
you did your best.

00:12:38.341 --> 00:12:39.968 position:50% align:center
So let's be happy!

00:12:51.896 --> 00:12:54.733 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
You know, to be honest with you,

00:12:54.816 --> 00:12:56.735 position:50% align:center
this is the best
I've felt in years!

00:12:56.818 --> 00:12:58.445 position:50% align:center
That's what I thought!

00:12:58.528 --> 00:13:00.321 position:50% align:center
You could tell, huh?

[LEONARDO]
Okay!

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:03.867 position:50% align:center
Beat 14 people,
and you've got a comeback!

[squawks]

00:13:40.612 --> 00:13:42.030 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER A] Three events
have finished so far,

00:13:42.113 --> 00:13:43.740 position:50% align:center
and the vault is underway.

00:13:43.823 --> 00:13:45.825 position:50% align:center
Much like the first,
the second day of competition

00:13:45.909 --> 00:13:48.578 position:50% align:center
has been filled with
incredible performances.

00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:51.873 position:50% align:center
But nobody can seem
to stop Minamino.

00:13:51.956 --> 00:13:53.917 position:50% align:center
How will Okamachi do?

00:14:02.258 --> 00:14:03.843 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER A]
A small hop on the landing.

00:14:03.927 --> 00:14:05.762 position:50% align:center
You know he can't be
happy about that.

00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:07.472 position:50% align:center
He may not have
stuck the landing,

00:14:07.555 --> 00:14:10.975 position:50% align:center
but we can still expect
a high score for that pass.

00:14:11.059 --> 00:14:14.479 position:50% align:center
Here it is now. 9.4!

00:14:14.562 --> 00:14:16.564 position:50% align:center
A solid performance
that shows his determination

00:14:16.648 --> 00:14:18.483 position:50% align:center
to hang onto his title.

00:14:21.236 --> 00:14:23.655 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER A]
Minamino is up next.

00:14:23.738 --> 00:14:25.407 position:50% align:center
Yesterday, he showcased
his layout Cuervo

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:27.701 position:50% align:center
with a single twist.

00:14:36.459 --> 00:14:38.003 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER A]
He stuck it!

00:14:38.086 --> 00:14:40.839 position:50% align:center
Minamino finishes
with a perfect landing!

00:14:40.922 --> 00:14:42.590 position:50% align:center
Let's watch that again.

00:14:46.011 --> 00:14:47.929 position:50% align:center
[KAMIMURA]
That was the Driggs.

00:14:48.013 --> 00:14:51.016 position:50% align:center
It's a higher-level skill
than the layout Cuervo.

00:14:52.892 --> 00:14:53.852 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER A]
He continues to impress

00:14:53.935 --> 00:14:55.603 position:50% align:center
with ambitious techniques.

00:14:55.687 --> 00:14:57.397 position:50% align:center
Let's see his score.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:02.152 position:50% align:center
9.55! He's beaten
Okamachi's score.

00:15:02.235 --> 00:15:03.653 position:50% align:center
The higher the difficulty level,

00:15:03.737 --> 00:15:06.406 position:50% align:center
the more likely it is
for errors to occur.

00:15:06.489 --> 00:15:08.491 position:50% align:center
But he raised it anyway.

00:15:08.575 --> 00:15:10.243 position:50% align:center
You have to wonder
why he'd take the risk

00:15:10.326 --> 00:15:12.579 position:50% align:center
when he's already at the top.

00:15:12.662 --> 00:15:15.165 position:50% align:center
It's like we don't
even exist to him, you know?

00:15:15.248 --> 00:15:18.251 position:50% align:center
He doesn't care about us.
Or the cup.

00:15:18.335 --> 00:15:19.836 position:50% align:center
He acts like the only person
he's competing

00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:22.213 position:50% align:center
against here is himself.

00:15:22.297 --> 00:15:24.132 position:50% align:center
The guy's a total jerk.

00:15:26.426 --> 00:15:28.845 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER A]
We are seeing error after error.

00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:29.763 position:50% align:center
[KAMIMURA]
They're feeling the pressure

00:15:29.846 --> 00:15:31.681 position:50% align:center
from Minamino's performance.

00:15:31.765 --> 00:15:33.224 position:50% align:center
His focus and
intensity this year

00:15:33.308 --> 00:15:36.770 position:50% align:center
seem to be intimidating
his competitors.

00:15:36.853 --> 00:15:38.813 position:50% align:center
I wonder how Dad's holding up.

00:15:38.897 --> 00:15:41.524 position:50% align:center
There's no need
to worry about Joe.

00:15:41.608 --> 00:15:44.277 position:50% align:center
Look at him.

00:15:44.361 --> 00:15:47.155 position:50% align:center
He's smiling.

00:15:47.238 --> 00:15:50.575 position:50% align:center
So we'll smile while
we cheer him on, won't we?

00:15:50.658 --> 00:15:52.243 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:15:53.661 --> 00:15:54.788 position:50% align:center
We're at the end

00:15:54.871 --> 00:15:56.748 position:50% align:center
of the competition's
second and final day.

00:15:56.831 --> 00:15:59.709 position:50% align:center
It all comes down
to this last event.

00:16:03.713 --> 00:16:04.714 position:50% align:center
What's up?

00:16:04.798 --> 00:16:06.591 position:50% align:center
You curious?

00:16:06.675 --> 00:16:08.009 position:50% align:center
[TETSUO]
Not really.

00:16:08.093 --> 00:16:10.011 position:50% align:center
[NAKANOMORI]
I heard from Amakusa.

00:16:10.095 --> 00:16:13.515 position:50% align:center
It sounds like you made quite
the demand a while back.

00:16:14.307 --> 00:16:16.726 position:50% align:center
Well, the Jotaro
we've seen here today.

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:18.687 position:50% align:center
Oh, sorry, I guess
that doesn't have anything

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:20.689 position:50% align:center
to do with you, does it?

00:16:20.772 --> 00:16:24.150 position:50% align:center
Never mind. It doesn't matter.

00:16:24.234 --> 00:16:26.444 position:50% align:center
Go as far as
you'd like out there.

00:16:26.528 --> 00:16:29.781 position:50% align:center
This competition is yours.
For sure.

00:16:32.659 --> 00:16:36.454 position:50% align:center
And now, let's see how Minamino
fares on the horizontal bar.

00:16:36.538 --> 00:16:39.416 position:50% align:center
You can almost feel the
anticipation in the arena.

00:16:39.499 --> 00:16:40.792 position:50% align:center
As if everyone's waiting to see

00:16:40.875 --> 00:16:43.837 position:50% align:center
if a new gymnastics
superstar will be born today.

00:16:49.718 --> 00:16:51.553 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER A]
Look at that giant swing.

00:16:52.929 --> 00:16:54.222 position:50% align:center
[KAMIMURA]
A Kolman!

00:16:56.307 --> 00:16:58.560 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER A] You can tell
he's not feeling any pressure.

00:16:58.643 --> 00:17:01.104 position:50% align:center
This is an athlete
with an iron will.

00:17:04.357 --> 00:17:07.694 position:50% align:center
[TETSUO]
To win. That's all that matters.

00:17:14.826 --> 00:17:16.995 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER A]
He did it!

00:17:17.078 --> 00:17:20.373 position:50% align:center
A remarkable performance
from start to finish!

00:17:27.672 --> 00:17:31.217 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER A] And the winner
of the 42nd NHK Cup is...

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:34.387 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER A] 
...Tetsuo Minamino!

00:17:35.513 --> 00:17:36.931 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER A]
The 38th World Championships

00:17:37.015 --> 00:17:38.600 position:50% align:center
will be held in August,

00:17:38.683 --> 00:17:40.018 position:50% align:center
and the gymnasts
who will represent Japan

00:17:40.101 --> 00:17:44.189 position:50% align:center
have been selected based
on the NHK Cup results.

00:17:44.272 --> 00:17:47.359 position:50% align:center
This will be Minamino's
second World Championships.

00:17:47.442 --> 00:17:50.070 position:50% align:center
His first was last year.

00:17:50.153 --> 00:17:52.113 position:50% align:center
[KAMIMURA] That tournament
may very well be what led

00:17:52.197 --> 00:17:55.742 position:50% align:center
to the rapid progress we've seen
from him in recent months.

00:17:55.825 --> 00:17:57.118 position:50% align:center
A single experience
can be enough

00:17:57.202 --> 00:18:00.163 position:50% align:center
to trigger substantial
growth in an athlete.

00:18:01.664 --> 00:18:05.126 position:50% align:center
[OKAMACHI]
I lost this time. You won.

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:06.878 position:50% align:center
But it won't happen again.

00:18:06.961 --> 00:18:08.922 position:50% align:center
I want this as badly as you.

00:18:12.634 --> 00:18:16.221 position:50% align:center
The kind of upsurge we saw here
has been rare in recent years.

00:18:16.304 --> 00:18:19.474 position:50% align:center
Yes, and based on the
youth of the top-rankers.

00:18:19.557 --> 00:18:22.769 position:50% align:center
I think it's safe to say
the next era is here.

00:18:22.852 --> 00:18:24.562 position:50% align:center
Not all of them are that young.

00:18:24.646 --> 00:18:27.816 position:50% align:center
It looks like
Jotaro Aragaki placed sixth.

00:18:27.899 --> 00:18:28.983 position:50% align:center
A significant step up

00:18:29.067 --> 00:18:31.569 position:50% align:center
after finishing in
15th on the first day

00:18:32.278 --> 00:18:33.822 position:50% align:center
[KAMIMURA] Likely because
Minamino's performance

00:18:33.905 --> 00:18:37.826 position:50% align:center
intimidated the other gymnasts
into making mistakes.

00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:39.035 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER A]
So would you say

00:18:39.119 --> 00:18:41.121 position:50% align:center
it was his competitors'
errors that saved him?

00:18:41.204 --> 00:18:42.539 position:50% align:center
[KAMIMURA]
No. In fact,

00:18:42.622 --> 00:18:45.083 position:50% align:center
I was impressed by how
meticulous he was out there.

00:18:45.166 --> 00:18:46.876 position:50% align:center
Back when he was
known as "the Samurai,"

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.712 position:50% align:center
his routines were
certainly dynamic,

00:18:48.795 --> 00:18:50.880 position:50% align:center
but they also had
some roughness to them.

00:18:50.964 --> 00:18:53.341 position:50% align:center
I saw none of that
this time, though.

00:18:53.425 --> 00:18:54.676 position:50% align:center
His style has
changed dramatically

00:18:54.759 --> 00:18:57.303 position:50% align:center
from what we've seen
in previous years.

00:18:59.806 --> 00:19:02.934 position:50% align:center
Oh, Grandma? Yeah, just now.

00:19:03.018 --> 00:19:05.020 position:50% align:center
Dad actually placed sixth!

00:19:10.483 --> 00:19:12.152 position:50% align:center
I'm off, Leo.

00:19:12.235 --> 00:19:14.863 position:50% align:center
Leo? He's gone.

00:19:16.698 --> 00:19:18.575 position:50% align:center
We finally found you.

00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:24.205 position:50% align:center
[REI]
Dad! Have you seen Leo anywhere?

00:19:24.289 --> 00:19:25.290 position:50% align:center
What?

00:19:25.373 --> 00:19:27.000 position:50% align:center
[REI]
He just up and vanished on me!

00:19:27.083 --> 00:19:29.419 position:50% align:center
I wonder if he got lost.

00:19:29.502 --> 00:19:31.963 position:50% align:center
Don't think so.
He's right there.

00:19:32.047 --> 00:19:33.048 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:33.131 --> 00:19:35.842 position:50% align:center
Leo! You disappeared!

00:19:35.925 --> 00:19:39.054 position:50% align:center
Indeed! With my
Ninja Art of Disappearing.

00:20:03.953 --> 00:20:05.121 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:20:05.205 --> 00:20:06.915 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO yawns]
Thirsty.

00:20:06.998 --> 00:20:09.459 position:50% align:center
Hey, Dad! Look!

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:13.421 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
A journey for training?

00:20:13.505 --> 00:20:16.591 position:50% align:center
I checked his room,
and he wasn't there!

00:20:16.675 --> 00:20:17.884 position:50% align:center
You know him.

00:20:17.967 --> 00:20:21.012 position:50% align:center
I'm sure he's out
goofing around, like usual.

00:20:21.096 --> 00:20:23.223 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I'm sure.

00:20:24.891 --> 00:20:27.435 position:50% align:center
[AMAKUSA]
So? Have you rested enough?

00:20:27.519 --> 00:20:30.689 position:50% align:center
Yes. I took three days off,
so I'm good.

00:20:30.772 --> 00:20:32.607 position:50% align:center
The NHK Cup went well.

00:20:32.691 --> 00:20:36.152 position:50% align:center
Almost no sign of the small
errors you used to make.

00:20:36.236 --> 00:20:40.031 position:50% align:center
You've achieved the precision
we've been training for.

00:20:40.115 --> 00:20:43.535 position:50% align:center
Our next step: Tackling
the high-level skills.

00:20:43.618 --> 00:20:46.746 position:50% align:center
It won't be easy,
but if you can't master those,

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:49.416 position:50% align:center
you won't be going
to Athens next year.

00:20:51.001 --> 00:20:53.128 position:50% align:center
[AMAKUSA] Now, it's looking
like we're gonna be holding

00:20:53.211 --> 00:20:56.131 position:50% align:center
a joint training camp
with China.

00:20:56.214 --> 00:20:58.967 position:50% align:center
You're one of the gymnasts
being tapped to participate.

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:01.720 position:50% align:center
Huh? A training camp with China?

00:21:01.803 --> 00:21:03.805 position:50% align:center
Right. The reigning
team champions

00:21:03.888 --> 00:21:05.640 position:50% align:center
after last year's Worlds.

00:21:05.724 --> 00:21:08.268 position:50% align:center
There's a lot to be
learned from them.

00:21:08.351 --> 00:21:10.520 position:50% align:center
That's the objective:
to get top gymnasts together

00:21:10.603 --> 00:21:12.605 position:50% align:center
who can heighten
each other's skills.

00:21:12.689 --> 00:21:16.109 position:50% align:center
Liu Longxiang, China's
superstar, will be there, too.

00:21:16.192 --> 00:21:19.362 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO] He took gold
in the individual all-around.

00:21:19.446 --> 00:21:21.948 position:50% align:center
Even Minamino can't touch him.

00:21:22.032 --> 00:21:24.743 position:50% align:center
His score at the
NHK Cup was high.

00:21:24.826 --> 00:21:27.662 position:50% align:center
But nowhere near Liu's.

00:21:27.746 --> 00:21:30.749 position:50% align:center
I think this is exactly
what you need right now.

00:21:30.832 --> 00:21:32.167 position:50% align:center
When does it start?

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:33.960 position:50% align:center
It's slated for
the beginning of July.

00:21:34.044 --> 00:21:35.754 position:50% align:center
First through sixth.

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:39.132 position:50% align:center
What, are you busy then?

00:21:39.215 --> 00:21:41.134 position:50% align:center
Not July.

00:21:41.885 --> 00:21:44.846 position:50% align:center
Sure enough,
my wish had come true.
