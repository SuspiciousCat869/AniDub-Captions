00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.042 align:middle
[TAKIZAWA]
I... Um. Uh...

00:00:12.125 --> 00:00:13.292 align:middle
[AYU]
Hmm?

00:00:14.833 --> 00:00:15.958 align:middle
Well, it's just...

00:00:16.042 --> 00:00:18.250 align:middle
I, um, wanted to tell you.

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:21.542 align:middle
Or not tell but ask you.

00:00:21.625 --> 00:00:23.208 align:middle
[AYU]
Yeah, what?

00:00:23.292 --> 00:00:25.083 align:middle
[TAKIZAWA]
I've been, you know,

00:00:25.167 --> 00:00:28.875 align:middle
doing gymnastics
for a long time, right?

00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:30.458 align:middle
And tomorrow, um...

00:00:30.542 --> 00:00:32.792 align:middle
There's this
kinda big tournament.

00:00:32.875 --> 00:00:35.958 align:middle
So, I was wondering
if maybe you wanna...

00:00:36.042 --> 00:00:37.958 align:middle
Yeah, I guess.

00:00:38.875 --> 00:00:41.875 align:middle
[screams]

00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:49.625 align:middle
[TAKIZAWA screams]

00:00:52.375 --> 00:00:54.208 align:middle
[MARI]
Rain, huh?

00:02:29.667 --> 00:02:30.583 align:middle
[NEWSCASTER]
Rain is in the forecast

00:02:30.667 --> 00:02:32.833 align:middle
for today, November 14th.

00:02:32.917 --> 00:02:34.667 align:middle
With a high of
nine degrees Celsius,

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.458 align:middle
we're looking at
a pretty chilly day,

00:02:36.542 --> 00:02:38.583 align:middle
even for this time of year.

00:02:38.667 --> 00:02:41.917 align:middle
Next, in America,
California's governor-elect...

00:03:00.208 --> 00:03:01.958 align:middle
Well, then. I'm off.

00:03:02.042 --> 00:03:06.042 align:middle
'Kay. I'll head up there later
with Grandma and all the rest.

00:03:06.125 --> 00:03:07.667 align:middle
You got everything?

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.292 align:middle
[JOTARO] Yep. And I made sure
to say goodbye to your mom.

00:03:11.875 --> 00:03:13.292 align:middle
Huh?

00:03:15.042 --> 00:03:16.833 align:middle
Turn around.

00:03:25.042 --> 00:03:27.000 align:middle
Do your best, Samurai!

00:03:28.125 --> 00:03:29.500 align:middle
I will!

00:03:31.667 --> 00:03:33.458 align:middle
[ANNOUNCER] We're here
at the All-Japan Artistic

00:03:33.542 --> 00:03:35.167 align:middle
Gymnastics Championships.

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.542 align:middle
This competition gathers
the sport's top performers

00:03:37.625 --> 00:03:40.875 align:middle
at all levels--adults,
students, and junior athletes--

00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:44.458 align:middle
to determine who is the
number one gymnast in Japan.

00:03:45.417 --> 00:03:46.833 align:middle
[ANNOUNCER] The morning
session just finished,

00:03:46.917 --> 00:03:50.417 align:middle
and we are now moving on
to the afternoon performances.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.458 align:middle
Tell me, Kamimura,
is there anyone in particular

00:03:53.542 --> 00:03:54.958 align:middle
we should be looking out for?

00:03:55.042 --> 00:03:59.417 align:middle
Well, I'd say to keep a close
eye on Minamino, for sure.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.500 align:middle
He's proved his talent both
at the NHK Cup earlier this year

00:04:02.583 --> 00:04:05.167 align:middle
and again at the world
championships this past summer,

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.208 align:middle
where he took home silver
in the individual all-around.

00:04:08.292 --> 00:04:09.708 align:middle
[ANNOUNCER]
It's been about 20 years

00:04:09.792 --> 00:04:13.375 align:middle
since Japan's glory days as
the "kingdom of gymnastics."

00:04:13.458 --> 00:04:15.250 align:middle
This young star promises
to bring the country back

00:04:15.333 --> 00:04:16.917 align:middle
to prominence in the sport.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.875 align:middle
He's been gaining increased
attention as people

00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.292 align:middle
put their hopes on him to
elevate Japan's standing

00:04:21.375 --> 00:04:22.917 align:middle
in the gymnastics world.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.167 align:middle
Tetsu!

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.792 align:middle
[AMAKUSA] Looks like
everyone's here for Minamino.

00:04:32.417 --> 00:04:34.708 align:middle
Now, then, how's the leg feel?

00:04:34.792 --> 00:04:37.125 align:middle
I took a painkiller
a little earlier.

00:04:37.208 --> 00:04:39.333 align:middle
So, it's good.

00:04:39.417 --> 00:04:41.167 align:middle
You've made it this far.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.125 align:middle
I won't tell you not to push.

00:04:43.208 --> 00:04:46.667 align:middle
That said, don't push
harder than you have to.

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.792 align:middle
Just do what you've been doing.

00:04:48.875 --> 00:04:50.042 align:middle
Believe in yourself

00:04:50.125 --> 00:04:52.458 align:middle
and trust the training
you've done to get here.

00:04:52.542 --> 00:04:54.208 align:middle
Okay, let's go.

00:04:54.292 --> 00:04:55.875 align:middle
Time to head into battle!

00:04:58.917 --> 00:05:00.125 align:middle
[KAZU]
Whoa.

00:05:00.208 --> 00:05:02.375 align:middle
So this is what a gymnastics
tournament's like?

00:05:02.458 --> 00:05:03.875 align:middle
[REI]
Pretty awesome, huh?

00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.625 align:middle
Aren't you glad you came?

00:05:05.708 --> 00:05:07.542 align:middle
I can't really tell yet.

00:05:07.625 --> 00:05:09.292 align:middle
Jeez. You said you
wanted to come--

00:05:09.375 --> 00:05:10.750 align:middle
it's not like I dragged you.

00:05:12.458 --> 00:05:13.875 align:middle
The match'll be thrilling,

00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.750 align:middle
but I doubt that's
why he's here, is it?

00:05:17.667 --> 00:05:21.542 align:middle
It's not easy to have
your affection go unreturned.

00:05:21.625 --> 00:05:24.625 align:middle
And I know that from personal
experience, darling.

00:05:24.708 --> 00:05:26.417 align:middle
Shut up, you old baldy!

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.208 align:middle
You'd better watch
that mouth of yours!

00:05:29.292 --> 00:05:32.833 align:middle
[AYU] Hey. It's Mr. Joe's
turn in not too long, right?

00:05:32.917 --> 00:05:34.833 align:middle
So, when is he gonna come out?

00:05:39.292 --> 00:05:40.375 align:middle
Just wait.

00:05:40.458 --> 00:05:43.250 align:middle
I think he knows
how much I want him there.

00:05:43.333 --> 00:05:45.917 align:middle
He'll come. I have faith in him.

00:05:48.792 --> 00:05:52.625 align:middle
Faith. Leo will come, I know it.

00:06:14.625 --> 00:06:18.333 align:middle
Ready, Tetsu? You're on.

00:06:23.167 --> 00:06:26.458 align:middle
All right. Next up,
we have Minamino on the floor.

00:06:37.583 --> 00:06:38.833 align:middle
[ANNOUNCER]
His first pass is

00:06:38.917 --> 00:06:41.125 align:middle
a double-twisting double back
tucked somersault.

00:06:41.208 --> 00:06:42.792 align:middle
A perfect landing!

00:06:42.875 --> 00:06:44.167 align:middle
You see that height?

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:45.833 align:middle
He must've trained
his lower body quite hard

00:06:45.917 --> 00:06:48.333 align:middle
to get that kind
of jumping power.

00:06:51.458 --> 00:06:54.250 align:middle
[ANNOUNCER] A combination
of E- and D-level skills!

00:06:54.333 --> 00:06:56.417 align:middle
Landed this one, as well.

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:00.333 align:middle
[cheering]

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.250 align:middle
[KAMIMURA] He's maintaining
a nice, clean line

00:07:05.333 --> 00:07:07.708 align:middle
from his toes to his shoulders.

00:07:07.792 --> 00:07:10.292 align:middle
[ANNOUNCER]
No real errors so far.

00:07:10.375 --> 00:07:14.917 align:middle
We're seeing what earned him
that silver medal at worlds.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.167 align:middle
And now, his
final tumbling pass.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:19.833 align:middle
He finishes with...

00:07:19.917 --> 00:07:21.583 align:middle
...a double layout!

00:07:29.292 --> 00:07:31.542 align:middle
What? He fell?

00:07:31.625 --> 00:07:33.458 align:middle
[gasps]

00:07:35.458 --> 00:07:37.292 align:middle
9.075.

00:07:37.375 --> 00:07:40.208 align:middle
A big mistake like
that right at the end.

00:07:40.292 --> 00:07:43.083 align:middle
That isn't something
you expect from Minamino.

00:07:44.583 --> 00:07:47.458 align:middle
[NAKANOMORI]
Tetsu.

00:07:54.333 --> 00:07:56.167 align:middle
I can make up for it.

00:07:57.417 --> 00:07:59.167 align:middle
Minamino's starting
his second event.

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:01.292 align:middle
Let's see how the
pommel horse goes.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000 align:middle
[KAMIMURA]
His hips are high,

00:08:03.083 --> 00:08:05.042 align:middle
and both legs are
nearly horizontal.

00:08:05.125 --> 00:08:07.208 align:middle
An impressive routine so far.

00:08:08.875 --> 00:08:10.125 align:middle
[ANNOUNCER]
You can tell he means to make up

00:08:10.208 --> 00:08:13.292 align:middle
for his earlier mistake
with his performance here.

00:08:15.042 --> 00:08:17.250 align:middle
[ANNOUNCER]
Wait, did he just break form?

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.625 align:middle
[ANNOUNCER]
What's going on with him today?

00:08:21.708 --> 00:08:23.792 align:middle
His movements seem
even sharper than usual,

00:08:23.875 --> 00:08:25.458 align:middle
but he keeps making these slips.

00:08:25.542 --> 00:08:27.375 align:middle
It could be that's the problem.

00:08:27.458 --> 00:08:28.958 align:middle
Those cleaner
movements might actually

00:08:29.042 --> 00:08:31.250 align:middle
throw off his rhythm some.

00:08:31.333 --> 00:08:33.917 align:middle
He's got talent,
but he's still only 18.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.125 align:middle
It's probably
his first time dealing

00:08:35.208 --> 00:08:37.542 align:middle
with something like this.

00:08:37.625 --> 00:08:39.417 align:middle
[ANNOUNCER]
9.15!

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:43.583 align:middle
That isn't the kind of score
Minamino is used to getting.

00:08:43.667 --> 00:08:48.708 align:middle
[AUDIENCE cheering]

00:08:53.208 --> 00:08:55.292 align:middle
[ANNOUNCER]
And here's a double layout!

00:08:58.625 --> 00:09:01.083 align:middle
[ANNOUNCER] Nothing to complain
about with that landing!

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.292 align:middle
[ANNOUNCER]
His score. Whoa, 9.5!

00:09:05.375 --> 00:09:07.000 align:middle
Surprisingly high for him.

00:09:08.167 --> 00:09:09.292 align:middle
[ANNOUNCER]
High enough that he's now

00:09:09.375 --> 00:09:11.417 align:middle
at the top of the standings.
That's right!

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:15.083 align:middle
In the lead, it's none
other than Jotaro Aragaki.

00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.792 align:middle
Go, Dad!

00:09:24.292 --> 00:09:26.417 align:middle
You've got to be kidding me!

00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.250 align:middle
[ANNOUNCER]
It may be cold outside,

00:09:30.333 --> 00:09:32.292 align:middle
but things are
heating up in the arena.

00:09:32.375 --> 00:09:34.125 align:middle
You can tell the competitors
came ready to fight

00:09:34.208 --> 00:09:36.292 align:middle
with everything they've got.

00:09:46.042 --> 00:09:48.750 align:middle
Okamachi and the other
top gymnasts especially.

00:09:48.833 --> 00:09:50.333 align:middle
Between the training camp
and the worlds,

00:09:50.417 --> 00:09:51.958 align:middle
they're in great shape.

00:09:52.042 --> 00:09:53.375 align:middle
Even outside of
their specialties,

00:09:53.458 --> 00:09:56.375 align:middle
they're including many
high-difficulty skills.

00:09:57.125 --> 00:09:58.000 align:middle
[ANNOUNCER]
Let's take a look at Aragaki

00:09:58.083 --> 00:10:01.208 align:middle
over on the pommel horse.

00:10:01.292 --> 00:10:04.333 align:middle
He has been performing
very well today.

00:10:04.417 --> 00:10:07.458 align:middle
We'll see if he continues
that trend in this event.

00:10:07.542 --> 00:10:08.750 align:middle
You got this! Good l--

00:10:08.833 --> 00:10:11.917 align:middle
Good luck!

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:18.042 align:middle
Great so far.

00:10:18.125 --> 00:10:20.875 align:middle
What surprises me most
is his precision.

00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.792 align:middle
[ANNOUNCER]
Can you elaborate on that?

00:10:22.875 --> 00:10:24.750 align:middle
[KAMIMURA] It's actually
very hard to continue rotations

00:10:24.833 --> 00:10:26.417 align:middle
on just one pommel.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:29.833 align:middle
But even so, his toes
are still nicely pointed.

00:10:29.917 --> 00:10:31.958 align:middle
He's executing a difficult skill

00:10:32.042 --> 00:10:35.208 align:middle
while remaining conscious
of every part of his body.

00:10:35.292 --> 00:10:37.375 align:middle
Back at the NHK Cup,
he performed well,

00:10:37.458 --> 00:10:39.542 align:middle
but nowhere near this level.

00:10:39.625 --> 00:10:42.625 align:middle
His energy brings a certain
beauty to the routine.

00:10:42.708 --> 00:10:44.917 align:middle
Such a drastic change
is especially surprising

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.250 align:middle
coming from a veteran gymnast.

00:10:51.125 --> 00:10:51.958 align:middle
[ANNOUNCER]
You can feel the emotion

00:10:52.042 --> 00:10:54.208 align:middle
in Aragaki's performance.

00:10:54.292 --> 00:10:55.417 align:middle
The mood of the audience shows

00:10:55.500 --> 00:11:01.458 align:middle
that they're
picking up on it, too.

00:11:01.542 --> 00:11:03.708 align:middle
[ANNOUNCER]
A nice, smooth dismount.

00:11:03.792 --> 00:11:07.042 align:middle
9.425! Another high score!

00:11:07.125 --> 00:11:09.375 align:middle

You're doing
really well out there.

[TAKIZAWA]
Do you know why?

00:11:37.375 --> 00:11:39.250 align:middle
It's because today is different.

00:11:39.333 --> 00:11:40.583 align:middle
Huh?

00:11:40.667 --> 00:11:45.125 align:middle
[TAKIZAWA] Today is the
day--that I prove my love.

00:11:45.208 --> 00:11:46.542 align:middle
Huh?

00:12:06.625 --> 00:12:10.333 align:middle
[TAKIZAWA]
What's up, people! Oh, a newbie?

00:12:10.417 --> 00:12:12.875 align:middle
Hey, hey! Takizawa's the name.

00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.333 align:middle
We should go out some time,
if you're game.

00:12:15.417 --> 00:12:17.625 align:middle
Wait! Ow, hey, ow!

00:12:19.333 --> 00:12:22.000 align:middle
<i>Iru al la infero!</i>

00:12:28.792 --> 00:12:31.417 align:middle
Nice. A difficult move.

00:12:32.542 --> 00:12:33.792 align:middle
[KAMIMURA]
He ends with a Tsukahara.

00:12:33.875 --> 00:12:35.833 align:middle
That's a Super E level skill!

00:12:40.625 --> 00:12:44.125 align:middle
Ayu, <i>iru al la infero</i> !

00:12:44.208 --> 00:12:45.792 align:middle
" <i>Iru al</i> ." What?

00:12:45.875 --> 00:12:48.625 align:middle
It means "go to hell"
in Esperanto.

00:12:48.708 --> 00:12:50.875 align:middle
Does he hate you?

00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.250 align:middle
[ANNOUNCER]
9.55!

00:12:52.333 --> 00:12:55.500 align:middle
That's today's highest score
for the parallel bars!

00:12:55.583 --> 00:12:57.750 align:middle
Go, Tackey!

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:00.875 align:middle
Love.

00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.667 align:middle
[AMAKUSA]
What do you mean "love"?

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:06.083 align:middle
You stupid kid.

00:13:06.167 --> 00:13:10.500 align:middle
You've been with
the club for 13 years now.

00:13:10.583 --> 00:13:13.833 align:middle
What today proves is
just how hard you've worked.

[ANNOUNCER] Takizawa jumps
all the way to second place!

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:29.958 align:middle
Moving from the
parallel bars to the vault,

00:13:30.042 --> 00:13:33.250 align:middle
and the gymnast who's
got everyone excited today.

00:13:33.333 --> 00:13:37.083 align:middle
Up now, Jotaro Aragaki!

00:13:37.167 --> 00:13:39.542 align:middle
He won an individual
silver medal at the Olympics,

00:13:39.625 --> 00:13:43.167 align:middle
causing a "samurai boom"
across Japan.

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:45.583 align:middle
It's been rough since
the tragedy of Lausanne.

00:13:45.667 --> 00:13:48.583 align:middle
He's had a long,
hard road these last six years.

00:13:48.667 --> 00:13:51.917 align:middle
He even came close
to retiring at one point.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.542 align:middle
But he refused to give up.

00:13:53.625 --> 00:13:54.958 align:middle
He focused, trained hard,

00:13:55.042 --> 00:13:58.292 align:middle
and faced the gymnastics
world head-on.

00:13:58.375 --> 00:14:01.500 align:middle
Now today, here in
Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium,

00:14:01.583 --> 00:14:06.500 align:middle
and against all odds,
Japan's Samurai has returned!

00:14:31.917 --> 00:14:33.667 align:middle
[ANNOUNCER]
That's the Yeo II.

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:36.167 align:middle
A move created by the
"god of vaulting,"

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:39.167 align:middle
South Korean gymnast,
Yeo Hong-Chul!

00:14:45.542 --> 00:14:46.875 align:middle
[ANNOUNCER]
That was a close one!

00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:50.708 align:middle
But Aragaki managed
to hold onto his landing.

00:14:50.792 --> 00:14:52.125 align:middle
[KAMIMURA]
He quickly stabilized his body

00:14:52.208 --> 00:14:54.083 align:middle
by moving his feet together.

00:14:54.167 --> 00:14:55.458 align:middle
Smart move.

00:14:55.542 --> 00:14:57.375 align:middle
Takes experience, though.

00:14:58.375 --> 00:15:00.833 align:middle
[ANNOUNCER]
He scores a 9.7!

00:15:00.917 --> 00:15:03.625 align:middle
At this rate, no one's going
to catch up to the samurai

00:15:35.583 --> 00:15:37.792 align:middle
Wait, Tetsu. Let's talk.

00:15:38.667 --> 00:15:41.833 align:middle
Tetsu. Tetsuo!

00:15:44.083 --> 00:15:45.292 align:middle
You were off today.

00:15:45.375 --> 00:15:47.500 align:middle
I noticed it immediately.

00:15:47.583 --> 00:15:50.333 align:middle
But I purposefully didn't
say anything about it.

00:15:50.417 --> 00:15:53.042 align:middle
And do you know why?

00:15:53.125 --> 00:15:54.375 align:middle
Because normally,
you would've been able

00:15:54.458 --> 00:15:57.208 align:middle
to recover from it
just fine on your own.

00:15:57.292 --> 00:15:58.875 align:middle
Today.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.958 align:middle
You lost focus
on your own routine

00:16:05.042 --> 00:16:07.792 align:middle
because of somebody
else's performance.

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:11.625 align:middle
What is your
ultimate goal, here?

00:16:11.708 --> 00:16:13.542 align:middle
And do you really
think you can reach it

00:16:13.625 --> 00:16:15.333 align:middle
while looking
the wrong direction?

00:16:15.417 --> 00:16:18.292 align:middle
Is it something that
can be attained so easily?

[TETSUO grunts]

00:16:27.083 --> 00:16:29.667 align:middle
Damn it. Tomorrow.

I'll give it my all.

00:16:53.917 --> 00:16:56.917 align:middle
I know you can do this, Tetsu.

00:16:59.083 --> 00:17:00.917 align:middle
I can't believe
the samurai's at the top!

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.375 align:middle
This is so cool!

00:17:02.458 --> 00:17:04.875 align:middle

You might say that

[REI]
But why?

00:17:25.625 --> 00:17:28.125 align:middle
I'd like to borrow you
for a bit if I can.

00:17:28.208 --> 00:17:30.125 align:middle
It's concerning Leonardo.

00:17:30.208 --> 00:17:31.625 align:middle
Huh?

[MARI]
Mm.

00:17:44.333 --> 00:17:46.625 align:middle
I'm going to lure his
chaperone away from the room.

00:17:46.708 --> 00:17:48.875 align:middle
That should give you
a chance to slip in.

You do want
to talk to him, right?

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:54.292 align:middle
Yeah. But, um, why now?

00:17:54.375 --> 00:17:55.875 align:middle
[SCARLETT]
Tell me, kid.

00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:58.500 align:middle
You know what they call
him back in England?

00:17:58.583 --> 00:17:59.917 align:middle
Huh? Well, a friend of mine

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.750 align:middle
said he's called
"the Pride of Royal."

00:18:02.833 --> 00:18:04.167 align:middle
Yes.

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:07.167 align:middle
The young genius
whose talent was so great--

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:10.708 align:middle
he stood out even in
a top ballet company.

00:18:10.792 --> 00:18:14.083 align:middle
But eventually,
it was that same talent

00:18:14.167 --> 00:18:15.958 align:middle
that drove him to run away.

00:18:18.917 --> 00:18:21.750 align:middle
[SCARLETT] Expectation
can be a heavy burden.

00:18:21.833 --> 00:18:23.417 align:middle
And just because
someone's a genius

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:26.750 align:middle
doesn't mean they have the
mental strength to bear it.

00:18:28.125 --> 00:18:29.375 align:middle
Poor Leo.

00:18:29.458 --> 00:18:31.375 align:middle
[SCARLETT]
He's needed back at the company,

00:18:31.458 --> 00:18:34.042 align:middle
and it's my job
to make that happen.

00:18:34.125 --> 00:18:37.750 align:middle
Thing is, if I take him back
in the shape he's in now.

00:18:37.833 --> 00:18:40.417 align:middle
I doubt he could bring
himself to get up on stage.

00:18:41.417 --> 00:18:46.125 align:middle
Even worse, it might make him
quit dancing altogether.

[gasps]

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.542 align:middle
That would mean I failed
at the job I was given.

Which is where
you come into play.

You don't have to stand.

00:19:26.833 --> 00:19:28.500 align:middle
Come and have a seat.

Huh? Um. Sure.

[LEONARDO]
Sorry.

00:19:35.083 --> 00:19:37.250 align:middle
For leaving
without saying anything.

00:19:37.333 --> 00:19:40.375 align:middle
That's okay. I guess.

00:19:40.458 --> 00:19:42.875 align:middle
I decided to go back to England.

00:19:42.958 --> 00:19:45.292 align:middle
I'm returning to

00:19:45.375 --> 00:19:47.500 align:middle
Wait. Back to them?

But, Leo, they were
the whole reason that you--

[LEONARDO]
Ran away?

00:19:52.542 --> 00:19:54.333 align:middle
Yes, you're right about that.

So, then, why?

00:19:57.208 --> 00:19:59.042 align:middle

Because of you guys.

My time here helped.

I'm really feeling
a lot stronger now.

00:20:03.333 --> 00:20:05.000 align:middle
I want to dance again,

00:20:05.083 --> 00:20:07.667 align:middle
and I have you
to thank for that.

I'm truly grateful.

[REI]
Even if that's true,

00:20:14.542 --> 00:20:18.042 align:middle
you should watch Dad
compete before you go.

00:20:18.125 --> 00:20:20.208 align:middle
Leo, he believes in you.

He's trusting you to come!

00:20:22.292 --> 00:20:23.583 align:middle
He said he thinks
you know how much

he wants you there!

And we'll both
do what we have to.

Come on, now, you really think

00:20:38.667 --> 00:20:41.292 align:middle
I should go and watch Joe?

00:20:41.375 --> 00:20:44.375 align:middle
At the expense of
my own responsibilities?

No, I...
