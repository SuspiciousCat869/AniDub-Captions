--[COMPUTER] You've got mail.
--[REI] Let's see.

00:00:19.936 --> 00:00:22.564 position:50% align:center
Wait. That means
good things are coming?

00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:29.863 position:50% align:center
Ahh!

00:00:30.655 --> 00:00:32.532 position:50% align:center
Kitty Zhang?

00:00:32.615 --> 00:00:33.742 position:50% align:center
Yeah, yeah!

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:35.952 position:50% align:center
You met her during
training camp, remember?

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:38.038 position:50% align:center
She plans to come visit Japan!

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.541 position:50% align:center
Wow, Rachel.

00:00:41.624 --> 00:00:43.835 position:50% align:center
You made a friend
in China, did you?

00:00:43.918 --> 00:00:46.379 position:50% align:center
Well, I would love
the chance to meet her.

00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:48.131 position:50% align:center
I suppose I'll allow it.

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:49.924 position:50% align:center
Just be sure to behave yourself.

00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:51.051 position:50% align:center
Okay, Dad, question:

00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:52.302 position:50% align:center
Can Kitty come
and stay at our house

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:55.138 position:50% align:center
since I'm gonna be on
summer vacation anyway?

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:58.516 position:50% align:center
Sure. If she's a friend of
yours, she's welcome.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.601 position:50% align:center
[REI]
Mm!

00:00:59.684 --> 00:01:01.728 position:50% align:center
You had better
behave too, Bigbird!

00:01:01.811 --> 00:01:04.147 position:50% align:center
Act up and it's back
to South America!

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.648 position:50% align:center

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:07.817 position:50% align:center
Don't worry! If we work hard,

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:10.278 position:50% align:center
I'm sure we can
impress Rae's friend!

00:01:11.446 --> 00:01:14.074 position:50% align:center
Don't let up, Dad!
Keep on training hard.

[JOTARO]
Yeah.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.497 position:50% align:center

I can stretch any further.

[JOTARO]
Hmm?

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:03.016 position:50% align:center
Your triple's looking stable.

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.018 position:50% align:center
And your timing's improving.

00:03:05.101 --> 00:03:07.103 position:50% align:center
You'll get there any day now.

00:03:08.271 --> 00:03:10.357 position:50% align:center
I think so.
Feels like I'm close.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.486 position:50% align:center
Once you complete this move,
it'll be named the Aragaki.

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.946 position:50% align:center
Don't lose your focus.

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:20.492 position:50% align:center
Somethin' the matter?

00:03:20.575 --> 00:03:23.203 position:50% align:center
I wonder if once
I master the triple,

00:03:23.286 --> 00:03:25.121 position:50% align:center
a quadruple might be possible.

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:27.332 position:50% align:center
Huh? Slow it down, bud.

00:03:27.415 --> 00:03:30.627 position:50% align:center
Ya gotta be able to grab the bar
before ya go tryin' to raise it.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.420 position:50% align:center
You're right.

00:03:32.504 --> 00:03:34.255 position:50% align:center
That's enough for today.

'Kay.

00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:40.637 position:50% align:center
[AMAKUSA] Well, if you do
pull off a quadruple someday.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.764 position:50% align:center
It'll be different
than this triple.

00:03:42.847 --> 00:03:46.226 position:50% align:center
There's no way you could
make it work as a release move.

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:48.395 position:50% align:center
I think you'd wanna
make it a dismount.

00:03:48.478 --> 00:03:50.980 position:50% align:center
You'd do four turns
and then land.

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:54.484 position:50% align:center
A quadruple dismount.

00:04:04.202 --> 00:04:07.539 position:50% align:center
He instinctively opens up
after the first three turns.

00:04:07.622 --> 00:04:11.543 position:50% align:center
He still can't visualize
himself going for a fourth.

00:04:11.626 --> 00:04:12.961 position:50% align:center
Still don't have a feel for it?

00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:15.255 position:50% align:center
No, not yet.

00:04:15.338 --> 00:04:16.881 position:50% align:center

00:04:16.965 --> 00:04:19.718 position:50% align:center
Check your form on video.

00:04:19.801 --> 00:04:21.636 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:04:22.554 --> 00:04:25.181 position:50% align:center
Leo! You can go on home.

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:27.726 position:50% align:center

[JOTARO]
Hm?

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:32.939 position:50% align:center
Is it all right if I come
with you this time?

00:04:33.023 --> 00:04:34.983 position:50% align:center
I think I can help.

00:04:35.066 --> 00:04:38.069 position:50% align:center
I promise to work
just as hard as you are!

00:04:41.906 --> 00:04:43.199 position:50% align:center
That all right?

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:44.701 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:47.704 position:50% align:center
I'm in your debt!

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.332 position:50% align:center
[AMAKUSA]
Right there.

00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:53.126 position:50% align:center
You've still got
height to work with,

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:55.795 position:50% align:center
but your form slips
after your third rotation.

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:59.090 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO] I jump and turn once,
then once again,

00:04:59.174 --> 00:05:03.678 position:50% align:center
and a third time,
then there's the fourth.

00:05:03.762 --> 00:05:04.971 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:05:05.055 --> 00:05:07.432 position:50% align:center
I just can't seem
to picture that fourth turn.

00:05:07.515 --> 00:05:08.558 position:50% align:center
Well,

00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:11.186 position:50% align:center
honestly, I expected
you to hit a wall.

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:13.021 position:50% align:center
What you're doing isn't normal.

00:05:13.104 --> 00:05:16.441 position:50% align:center
People don't try quadruples
in official matches.

00:05:16.524 --> 00:05:17.650 position:50% align:center
You've set a goal for yourself

00:05:17.734 --> 00:05:20.653 position:50% align:center
that not even
Liu Longxiang is aiming for.

00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:23.281 position:50% align:center

you make a breakthrough.

Hmm?

00:05:29.204 --> 00:05:30.538 position:50% align:center
You need to spin longer.

Right?

00:05:31.623 --> 00:05:33.458 position:50% align:center
Then spin around
like a ninja star!

00:05:33.541 --> 00:05:36.086 position:50% align:center
Or like one of those
fun little pinwheels!

00:18:53.675 --> 00:18:56.177 position:50% align:center
To survive by accepting
that you might die.

00:18:56.261 --> 00:18:57.345 position:50% align:center
To understand your weakness is

00:18:57.429 --> 00:19:00.098 position:50% align:center
to carry an unmoving
blade in your heart.

00:19:00.181 --> 00:19:02.350 position:50% align:center
Use that blade
to clear your path!

00:19:02.434 --> 00:19:06.771 position:50% align:center
A steadfast heart without
worry, or contempt, or fear.

00:19:06.855 --> 00:19:09.649 position:50% align:center
That's what each one of us
stands to gain today!

00:19:09.733 --> 00:19:12.569 position:50% align:center
So if you wish
to become true ninjas.

00:19:12.652 --> 00:19:16.448 position:50% align:center
If you have the strength
to fight for peace.

00:19:16.531 --> 00:19:20.160 position:50% align:center
Then stand up now.
Stand and fight at my side.

00:19:33.048 --> 00:19:34.215 position:50% align:center
[KITTY]
Well, Rei.

00:19:34.299 --> 00:19:36.217 position:50% align:center
I had a really fun summer
vacation with you.

00:19:36.301 --> 00:19:37.344 position:50% align:center
Thanks for having me.

00:19:39.137 --> 00:19:41.723 position:50% align:center
[KITTY]
I'll e-mail you.

00:19:41.806 --> 00:19:43.391 position:50% align:center
Later.

00:19:53.943 --> 00:19:55.362 position:50% align:center
[REI]
Kitty!

00:19:58.698 --> 00:20:00.617 position:50% align:center
I know now.

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:03.244 position:50% align:center
I wanna be a famous actress!

00:20:05.121 --> 00:20:07.123 position:50% align:center
Thing is, I love movies.

00:20:07.207 --> 00:20:10.669 position:50% align:center
Watching them and
pretending to be in them, too.

00:20:10.752 --> 00:20:13.421 position:50% align:center
I didn't think much
about it before now,

00:20:13.505 --> 00:20:15.090 position:50% align:center
but spending time with you

00:20:15.173 --> 00:20:18.802 position:50% align:center
and seeing the way you give
yourself to the things you love.

00:20:18.885 --> 00:20:20.178 position:50% align:center
The way you go
from having a dream

00:20:20.261 --> 00:20:25.350 position:50% align:center
to working to make it
come true, it inspired me.

00:20:25.433 --> 00:20:26.810 position:50% align:center
So I'm gonna do more!

00:20:26.893 --> 00:20:28.728 position:50% align:center
I'll find things I like to do!

00:20:28.812 --> 00:20:31.815 position:50% align:center
I wanna discover as
much fun stuff as I can!

00:20:31.898 --> 00:20:34.776 position:50% align:center
And I wanna study
acting properly, too!

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.445 position:50% align:center
You figured it out.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.033 position:50% align:center
I'm looking forward to it.

00:20:42.117 --> 00:20:43.827 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Same!

00:20:50.959 --> 00:20:53.795 position:50% align:center
Samurai. Do your
best for Rei's sake.

00:20:53.878 --> 00:20:55.296 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:20:56.256 --> 00:20:58.216 position:50% align:center
Don't "lurk in the shadows"
too long, Ninja.

00:20:58.299 --> 00:20:59.718 position:50% align:center
Uh?!

00:21:01.136 --> 00:21:02.762 position:50% align:center
Later!

00:21:06.224 --> 00:21:08.309 position:50% align:center
I said it. Out loud.

00:22:51.871 --> 00:22:54.499 position:50% align:center
Ohh!

00:22:54.582 --> 00:22:55.917 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:22:57.502 --> 00:22:58.920 position:50% align:center
[AMKUSA]
Mm.
