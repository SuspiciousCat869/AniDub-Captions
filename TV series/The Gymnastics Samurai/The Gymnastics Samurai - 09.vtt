[LIAM]
It really is too bad about Tony.

00:00:13.221 --> 00:00:14.639 position:50% align:center
[NOEL] Yeah, if it
hadn't been for that fall,

00:00:14.723 --> 00:00:16.850 position:50% align:center
his score would've
been a lot higher.

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:19.602 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:25.316 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:00:34.826 --> 00:00:37.203 position:50% align:center
[NOEL]
That's Japan's Samurai.

00:00:37.746 --> 00:00:39.581 position:50% align:center
He's amazing on the bar.

00:00:39.664 --> 00:00:41.416 position:50% align:center
A Samurai?

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:43.418 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and from what I hear,

00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:46.463 position:50% align:center
he's going to be trying out
a new triple today.

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:48.173 position:50% align:center
A brand new move.

00:00:48.256 --> 00:00:50.175 position:50% align:center
If he pulls it off
in this competition,

00:00:50.258 --> 00:00:52.677 position:50% align:center
it'll be named
the Aragaki, after him.

00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:54.929 position:50% align:center
Aragaki.

00:00:58.558 --> 00:00:59.768 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:01:06.358 --> 00:01:07.776 position:50% align:center
That's Aragaki for you.

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:09.402 position:50% align:center
He's all fired up.

00:01:09.486 --> 00:01:11.404 position:50% align:center
Just like a samurai!

00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:31.591 position:50% align:center
[LIAM]
The triple! He did it!

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:53.446 position:50% align:center
[LEONARDO]
Anything I can do to help Joe,

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.324 position:50% align:center
even if it's just
something small.

00:03:39.678 --> 00:03:41.888 position:50% align:center
I still haven't managed
to stick the landing.

00:03:41.971 --> 00:03:43.181 position:50% align:center
Maybe not,

00:03:43.264 --> 00:03:44.974 position:50% align:center
but your turns are looking
a lot smoother now.

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:46.351 position:50% align:center
You've figured it out.

00:03:46.434 --> 00:03:48.311 position:50% align:center
We just need to keep drilling.

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:49.562 position:50% align:center
Shoulder good?

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:50.980 position:50% align:center
It feels fine.

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:53.233 position:50% align:center
Keep up with your acupuncture.

00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:55.360 position:50% align:center
It's just a month
till All Japan.

00:03:55.443 --> 00:03:56.653 position:50% align:center
Perfect this move,

00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:59.155 position:50% align:center
and it'll put you a
big step closer to Athens.

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:00.865 position:50% align:center
I'll get it in time.

00:04:02.617 --> 00:04:04.160 position:50% align:center
I know you can do this, Joe!

00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:05.286 position:50% align:center
And I'll show my support

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.540 position:50% align:center
by doing lots of
my own turns, indeed!

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:17.590 position:50% align:center
You're really pushing hard.

00:04:18.383 --> 00:04:19.551 position:50% align:center
You bet.

00:04:19.634 --> 00:04:21.344 position:50% align:center
You're not the only one
with somethin' to prove.

00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:22.470 position:50% align:center
Seriously, dude.

00:04:22.554 --> 00:04:24.472 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna bring it at All-Japan.

00:04:24.556 --> 00:04:26.808 position:50% align:center
This is love. Pure love.

00:04:26.891 --> 00:04:30.020 position:50% align:center
Feel me? My heart
is on the line!

00:04:31.312 --> 00:04:32.939 position:50% align:center
If there's one thing
I've learned,

00:04:33.023 --> 00:04:36.067 position:50% align:center
it's that you have to fight,
or you're gonna get burned!

00:04:36.151 --> 00:04:38.987 position:50% align:center
I've gotta go out
there and crush it!

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.239 position:50% align:center
All right!
One more set!

00:04:46.161 --> 00:04:47.620 position:50% align:center
[REPORTER]
Sightings of the white owl Fuku

00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:51.374 position:50% align:center
have been causing quite a stir
among Ikebukuro's residents.

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:53.835 position:50% align:center
He kept working till
he had it perfected.

00:04:53.918 --> 00:04:57.422 position:50% align:center
Joe's special move:
the Aragaki Mark II!

00:04:57.505 --> 00:04:58.548 position:50% align:center
No way!

00:04:58.631 --> 00:05:00.258 position:50% align:center
That's awesome news, Dad!

00:05:00.342 --> 00:05:03.011 position:50% align:center
I still haven't managed
to land it successfully,

00:05:03.094 --> 00:05:05.096 position:50% align:center
so "perfected" might
be the wrong word.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.932 position:50% align:center
It won't take Japan's
Samurai much longer, though.

00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:10.560 position:50% align:center
The turns are perfect,
and the landing will follow.

00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:14.022 position:50% align:center
I know your support had
a lot to do with it, Leo.

00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:16.941 position:50% align:center
For Joe, I'll do anything.

00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:18.943 position:50% align:center
No sacrifice is too great.

00:05:19.027 --> 00:05:21.780 position:50% align:center
I'll help him,
body, heart and soul.

00:05:22.697 --> 00:05:25.116 position:50% align:center
[BB]
What're you doin', crazy bird?

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.327 position:50% align:center
[REPORTER] Fuku flew the coop
more than ten days ago now

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.038 position:50% align:center
and shows no sign
of returning home.

00:05:30.121 --> 00:05:31.289 position:50% align:center
There have been
repeated sightings

00:05:31.373 --> 00:05:33.124 position:50% align:center
throughout Toshima Ward.

00:05:33.208 --> 00:05:34.376 position:50% align:center
Everyone is eager to see

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:37.170 position:50% align:center
where the runaway owl
will show up next.

00:05:37.253 --> 00:05:38.880 position:50% align:center
You're gonna get caught.

00:05:38.963 --> 00:05:41.091 position:50% align:center
Hey, Bigbird, you're in the way.

00:05:44.886 --> 00:05:46.346 position:50% align:center
[BOYS]
Fuku, please!

00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:49.140 position:50% align:center
It's time to come home!

00:06:48.158 --> 00:06:51.244 position:50% align:center
[REI] Hey, Leo.
You remember Fuku, don't you?

00:06:51.327 --> 00:06:53.496 position:50% align:center
The white owl we saw on TV?

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.248 position:50% align:center
Yes, the one on the news.

00:06:55.331 --> 00:06:57.250 position:50% align:center
Kazu told me he saw it!

00:06:57.334 --> 00:06:58.418 position:50% align:center
But then Fuku flew away

00:06:58.501 --> 00:07:01.212 position:50% align:center
before he could
call the TV station.

00:07:01.296 --> 00:07:02.297 position:50% align:center
I wonder if the poor thing

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.467 position:50% align:center
is scared 'cause
everyone's chasing it.

00:07:07.677 --> 00:07:10.555 position:50% align:center
I hope Fuku can go home soon.

00:07:27.238 --> 00:07:29.866 position:50% align:center
Just a week to spare
before the competition.

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:31.951 position:50% align:center
Cut things close,
but you made it.

00:07:32.035 --> 00:07:35.080 position:50% align:center
[LEONARDO]
Joe! You did it, indeed!

00:07:35.163 --> 00:07:37.290 position:50% align:center
I always knew you could!

00:07:37.374 --> 00:07:39.709 position:50% align:center
I believed in you, Joe!

00:07:39.793 --> 00:07:42.671 position:50% align:center
Listen up. This is crunch time.

00:07:42.754 --> 00:07:44.172 position:50% align:center
We need to start
thinking about how

00:07:44.255 --> 00:07:46.675 position:50% align:center
to rework your routine
to add the Mark II.

00:07:46.758 --> 00:07:48.218 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:07:56.101 --> 00:07:58.770 position:50% align:center
[LEONARDO] The Samurai's
unbeatable, indeed!

00:07:58.853 --> 00:08:02.065 position:50% align:center
Rachel will be so
excited when we tell her!

00:08:03.692 --> 00:08:05.485 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
I want to thank you, Leo.

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:12.617 position:50% align:center
There's no need.

00:08:12.701 --> 00:08:15.161 position:50% align:center
You didn't ask me to help.
I wanted to.

00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:19.708 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
You know, when I first met you,

00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:23.044 position:50% align:center
I was planning to retire
from gymnastics.

00:08:23.128 --> 00:08:25.255 position:50% align:center
I was getting up
the nerve to tell Rei,

00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:28.008 position:50% align:center
but every time I tried,
you would show up.

00:08:28.091 --> 00:08:29.551 position:50% align:center
Then there's Britney.

00:08:29.634 --> 00:08:32.929 position:50% align:center
Things really turned around
when you introduced me to him.

00:08:33.013 --> 00:08:36.307 position:50% align:center
I finally understood what
Amakusa was trying to tell me,

00:08:36.391 --> 00:08:37.559 position:50% align:center
and thanks to that,

00:08:37.642 --> 00:08:40.895 position:50% align:center
I was able to see
gymnastics in a new light.

00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:42.731 position:50% align:center
Wow, I didn't know.

00:08:42.814 --> 00:08:46.276 position:50% align:center
However it happened,
I'm glad you didn't retire.

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:48.987 position:50% align:center
Yeah, me too.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:54.534 position:50% align:center
I can picture you competing
at All-Japan so clearly, Joe!

00:08:54.617 --> 00:08:59.831 position:50% align:center
You land the Aragaki Mark II,
amazing everyone in the crowd.

00:08:59.914 --> 00:09:01.541 position:50% align:center
It's thrilling, you know.

00:09:01.624 --> 00:09:04.210 position:50% align:center
Watching you do gymnastics.

00:09:04.294 --> 00:09:08.089 position:50% align:center
I feel like it
gives me courage, indeed.

00:09:08.173 --> 00:09:09.966 position:50% align:center
Leo.

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:10.967 position:50% align:center
[LEONARDO]
Hmm?

00:09:11.051 --> 00:09:13.970 position:50% align:center
I want to help you,
too, if I can.

00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:17.891 position:50% align:center
Ballet matters to you.

00:09:17.974 --> 00:09:20.310 position:50% align:center
It's not just a hobby.

00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:23.938 position:50% align:center
Before you came here to Japan,

00:09:24.022 --> 00:09:28.026 position:50% align:center
I bet it'd been a big part
of your life for a long time.

00:09:28.109 --> 00:09:29.611 position:50% align:center
If you decide
to stop being a ninja

00:09:29.694 --> 00:09:31.821 position:50% align:center
and return to the ballet world,

00:09:31.905 --> 00:09:34.574 position:50% align:center
I'll support you however I can.

00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:38.370 position:50% align:center
We all will. Got that?

00:09:38.453 --> 00:09:42.540 position:50% align:center
If you're injured,
Britney will fix it for sure.

00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:50.632 position:50% align:center
Look, it's Fuku!

00:09:50.715 --> 00:09:52.133 position:50% align:center
Wait, who?

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:54.969 position:50% align:center
The runaway owl?

00:09:57.097 --> 00:09:59.015 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
Its leg is caught in the fence.

00:09:59.099 --> 00:10:01.059 position:50% align:center
Don't worry! I'll save you!

00:10:02.811 --> 00:10:05.730 position:50% align:center
Joe, careful up there!

00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:11.820 position:50% align:center
Yeah. That's a good bird.

00:10:11.903 --> 00:10:13.780 position:50% align:center
Stay still for me.

00:10:16.241 --> 00:10:17.867 position:50% align:center
Joe!

00:10:20.662 --> 00:10:22.288 position:50% align:center
You really scared me there.

00:10:22.372 --> 00:10:24.290 position:50% align:center
Will Fuku be okay?

00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:27.502 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
It's flying just fine.

00:10:27.585 --> 00:10:29.379 position:50% align:center
So probably.

00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:31.339 position:50% align:center
That's good, indeed!

00:10:31.423 --> 00:10:34.050 position:50% align:center
Joe, the great owl rescuer!

00:10:37.721 --> 00:10:38.471 position:50% align:center
[LEONARDO]
Hm?

00:10:38.555 --> 00:10:40.140 position:50% align:center
Joe?

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:43.351 position:50% align:center
Huh...?

00:10:57.741 --> 00:11:00.285 position:50% align:center
[VOICE I] Leo really
loves ballet, doesn't he?

00:11:00.368 --> 00:11:01.786 position:50% align:center
[VOICE J]
It's impossible not to smile

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:03.413 position:50% align:center
when you see him perform.

00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:05.915 position:50% align:center
He just looks so happy.

00:11:09.002 --> 00:11:11.004 position:50% align:center
[VOICE J] So expressive
at such a young age.

00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:13.465 position:50% align:center
He has extraordinary talent.

00:11:13.548 --> 00:11:15.884 position:50% align:center
[VOICE A] He could be
the best dancer in decades.

00:11:15.967 --> 00:11:18.011 position:50% align:center
The boy is clearly a genius.

00:11:18.094 --> 00:11:19.429 position:50% align:center
[VOICE B]
He has a bright future.

00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:22.724 position:50% align:center
A world-class principal
dancer in the making.

00:11:23.433 --> 00:11:25.185 position:50% align:center
[VOICE I]
The pride of Royal!

00:11:32.359 --> 00:11:34.694 position:50% align:center
[VOICE C] Today's
performance was lackluster.

00:11:34.778 --> 00:11:37.989 position:50% align:center
He seemed almost like a
regular scholarship student.

00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:44.287 position:50% align:center
[VOICE D]
I expected more from him.

00:11:44.371 --> 00:11:47.040 position:50% align:center
[VOICE C] This should be
easy for a genius like you.

00:11:47.123 --> 00:11:48.124 position:50% align:center
What's the matter?

00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:49.793 position:50% align:center
[VOICE J]
Come on. You can do this.

00:11:49.876 --> 00:11:51.628 position:50% align:center
[VOICE E]
There's no way you'll fail.

00:11:51.711 --> 00:11:54.297 position:50% align:center
[MADAM]
Please don't disappoint me.

00:11:55.048 --> 00:11:56.216 position:50% align:center
[VOICE C]
That's it!

00:11:56.299 --> 00:11:59.135 position:50% align:center
A performance befitting
the "pride of Royal"!

00:12:04.099 --> 00:12:06.393 position:50% align:center
[VOICE E]
He's different than the rest us.

00:12:06.476 --> 00:12:09.479 position:50% align:center
[VOICE F] He could never
understand how we feel.

00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:12.065 position:50% align:center
[VOICE G]
Must be nice being a genius.

00:12:16.194 --> 00:12:17.320 position:50% align:center
[VOICE I]
Don't worry about it.

00:12:17.404 --> 00:12:19.114 position:50% align:center
You're a genius, after all.

00:12:19.197 --> 00:12:20.824 position:50% align:center
[VOICE H]
Show me more emotion!

00:12:20.907 --> 00:12:21.991 position:50% align:center
More! More!

00:12:22.075 --> 00:12:23.785 position:50% align:center
Yes, that's it!

00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:26.955 position:50% align:center
[VOICE J] Go on. Be the
genius we all know you are.

00:12:28.498 --> 00:12:29.749 position:50% align:center
[VOICE B]
There it is.

00:12:29.833 --> 00:12:32.794 position:50% align:center
That's how the "pride
of Royal" should perform.

00:13:19.758 --> 00:13:26.514 position:50% align:center
[LEONARDO] Ninja. Will the
shadows hide me, too?

00:13:31.436 --> 00:13:33.813 position:50% align:center
An owl-related injury, huh?

00:13:33.897 --> 00:13:35.690 position:50% align:center
Yeah, my bad.

00:13:37.984 --> 00:13:39.194 position:50% align:center
[BRITNEY]
It's a sprain.

00:13:39.277 --> 00:13:40.653 position:50% align:center
The bones seem fine,

00:13:40.737 --> 00:13:43.323 position:50% align:center
and it doesn't look
like you hurt anything else.

00:13:43.406 --> 00:13:44.949 position:50% align:center
That includes your shoulder.

00:13:45.033 --> 00:13:46.368 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
So what are we looking at?

00:13:46.451 --> 00:13:47.410 position:50% align:center
Treatment-wise.

00:13:47.494 --> 00:13:49.537 position:50% align:center
I've already
contacted the clinic.

00:13:49.621 --> 00:13:52.207 position:50% align:center
We'll get you an
injection of painkillers.

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:55.085 position:50% align:center
Then we can talk about
adjusting your training plan.

00:13:55.168 --> 00:13:57.796 position:50% align:center
A sprain.
Right before All-Japan.

00:13:57.879 --> 00:14:00.006 position:50% align:center
We can't do anything
to change the past.

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:01.841 position:50% align:center
And at least it wasn't a break.

00:14:01.925 --> 00:14:03.301 position:50% align:center
Wait! Joe!

00:14:03.385 --> 00:14:06.346 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me you're really
still planning to compete?

00:14:06.429 --> 00:14:08.306 position:50% align:center
You've got an injury.

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:11.893 position:50% align:center
Yeah, something like this
isn't all that big a deal.

00:14:11.976 --> 00:14:13.978 position:50% align:center
I mean, it's nothing
compared to my shoulder.

00:14:14.062 --> 00:14:15.647 position:50% align:center
That became a chronic problem.

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:18.441 position:50% align:center
One that put your whole
future as a gymnast on the line.

00:14:18.525 --> 00:14:19.567 position:50% align:center
Exactly!

00:14:19.651 --> 00:14:21.194 position:50% align:center
Maybe it's not bad now,

00:14:21.277 --> 00:14:23.863 position:50% align:center
but pushing too
hard could make it worse.

00:14:23.947 --> 00:14:25.407 position:50% align:center
It's true,
there's still some risk,

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:27.158 position:50% align:center
even with a simple sprain.

00:14:27.242 --> 00:14:28.827 position:50% align:center
Tape and painkillers
may get you through

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:30.495 position:50% align:center
the competition just fine,

00:14:30.578 --> 00:14:33.498 position:50% align:center
but there is always a chance
that you could reinjure it.

00:14:33.581 --> 00:14:34.499 position:50% align:center
And if that happened,

00:14:34.582 --> 00:14:36.042 position:50% align:center
there might be
long-term effects.

00:14:36.126 --> 00:14:37.127 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:39.337 position:50% align:center
I think competing's
a bad idea, Joe!

00:14:39.421 --> 00:14:40.755 position:50% align:center
Easy, ninja.

00:14:40.839 --> 00:14:42.924 position:50% align:center
For serious athletes,
this is the norm.

00:14:43.008 --> 00:14:44.968 position:50% align:center
They almost always
have some injury.

00:14:45.051 --> 00:14:47.303 position:50% align:center
It's just a matter
of dealing with it.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.391 position:50% align:center
Though, I'll admit owls
aren't usually involved.

00:14:51.474 --> 00:14:52.934 position:50% align:center
Just for me.

00:14:53.018 --> 00:14:55.603 position:50% align:center
But, Joe, what if
it's worse than you think?

00:14:55.687 --> 00:14:57.397 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
Hey, don't worry.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:58.815 position:50% align:center
It's gonna be fine.

00:14:58.898 --> 00:15:00.442 position:50% align:center
We perfected
the Mark II together,

00:15:00.525 --> 00:15:02.485 position:50% align:center
and I swear I'll land it.

00:15:10.493 --> 00:15:11.870 position:50% align:center
How was your day?

00:15:11.953 --> 00:15:13.455 position:50% align:center
Doesn't look good.

00:15:13.538 --> 00:15:14.873 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I kinda tripped.

00:15:14.956 --> 00:15:17.584 position:50% align:center
Ugh. You never
change, do you, Dad?

00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:19.461 position:50% align:center
I chose dishes
from Mom's recipes

00:15:19.544 --> 00:15:21.963 position:50% align:center
that are supposed
to help with injuries.

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:25.967 position:50% align:center
That sounds great.
Thank you.

00:15:26.051 --> 00:15:28.053 position:50% align:center
[REI] Are you going to
the hospital tomorrow?

00:15:28.136 --> 00:15:30.930 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO] I already had
Britney do some adjustments.

00:15:31.014 --> 00:15:32.557 position:50% align:center
The pain's mostly gone.

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.517 position:50% align:center
[REI] So just straight
to the club, then?

00:15:34.601 --> 00:15:36.644 position:50% align:center
[BB]
Get better soon!

00:15:52.786 --> 00:15:55.413 position:50% align:center
[LEONARDO]
Samurai, can you hear my voice?

00:15:55.497 --> 00:15:57.248 position:50% align:center
Listen closely,

00:15:57.332 --> 00:15:59.959 position:50% align:center
you have an injury that
must not be taken lightly.

00:16:00.043 --> 00:16:02.462 position:50% align:center
Now is not the time
to push yourself.

00:16:02.545 --> 00:16:04.964 position:50% align:center
Give up on the
tournament and rest.

00:16:05.048 --> 00:16:08.176 position:50% align:center
This is a message
from God, indeed.

00:16:08.259 --> 00:16:10.845 position:50% align:center
Do you understand?
Give up on the--

00:16:21.356 --> 00:16:23.233 position:50% align:center
Leo, I'm going to compete.

00:16:23.316 --> 00:16:24.859 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:32.742 --> 00:16:35.120 position:50% align:center
Why not skip this one?

00:16:35.203 --> 00:16:37.372 position:50% align:center
There are other tournaments.

00:16:37.455 --> 00:16:40.500 position:50% align:center
Other chances for you to win.

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:42.752 position:50% align:center
Don't compete.

00:16:42.836 --> 00:16:44.170 position:50% align:center
I don't want to see
you fail out there

00:16:44.254 --> 00:16:46.381 position:50% align:center
and become useless.

00:16:49.426 --> 00:16:51.928 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
Sure, I might fail.

00:16:52.012 --> 00:16:54.889 position:50% align:center
But that won't make me useless.

00:16:54.973 --> 00:16:58.351 position:50% align:center
Before all this,
I didn't understand anything.

00:16:58.435 --> 00:17:00.437 position:50% align:center
I thought if I just
practiced as much as I could,

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.605 position:50% align:center
I'd get stronger.

00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:04.024 position:50% align:center
I had tunnel vision.

00:17:04.107 --> 00:17:05.358 position:50% align:center
Kept pushing forward on my own,

00:17:05.442 --> 00:17:08.278 position:50% align:center
till suddenly I was
being forced to retire.

00:17:10.196 --> 00:17:12.198 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
But then, I realized something.

00:17:17.162 --> 00:17:18.872 position:50% align:center
I'm not in this alone.

00:17:18.955 --> 00:17:20.665 position:50% align:center
My friends and
family are with me,

00:17:20.749 --> 00:17:24.836 position:50% align:center
and thanks to them,
I can keep doing what I love.

00:17:24.919 --> 00:17:27.339 position:50% align:center
I want to honor
their faith in me.

00:17:27.422 --> 00:17:31.426 position:50% align:center
I'll do anything I have to,
overcome every hurdle.

00:17:31.509 --> 00:17:33.928 position:50% align:center
Because you know what I see
when I look beyond them?

00:17:34.012 --> 00:17:37.057 position:50% align:center
The smiles of those
who support me.

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:39.100 position:50% align:center
I won't ever back down again.

00:17:41.644 --> 00:17:44.064 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
That's the kind of gymnast I am.

00:17:46.733 --> 00:17:47.901 position:50% align:center
Now, tell me.

00:17:47.984 --> 00:17:51.112 position:50% align:center
What is it that
you're so afraid of?

00:17:53.198 --> 00:17:54.699 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO] I don't know
why you're here in Japan

00:17:54.783 --> 00:17:57.660 position:50% align:center
or what made you want
to become a ninja,

00:17:57.744 --> 00:18:01.456 position:50% align:center
but I do know that you're
an amazingly talented dancer.

00:18:01.539 --> 00:18:05.752 position:50% align:center
And I can tell that you're
used to working hard.

00:18:05.835 --> 00:18:08.213 position:50% align:center
I've decided to stick with it.

00:18:08.296 --> 00:18:12.175 position:50% align:center
What do you say, Leo? Will you?

00:18:13.134 --> 00:18:16.638 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO] You can still dance,
so why won't you?

00:18:16.721 --> 00:18:19.015 position:50% align:center
If anyone can
keep fighting, it's you.

00:18:23.269 --> 00:18:25.647 position:50% align:center
I can't do it, though.

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:28.733 position:50% align:center
I can't become strong.

00:18:30.485 --> 00:18:32.946 position:50% align:center
I'm not like you, Joe.

00:18:36.324 --> 00:18:38.702 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:18:38.785 --> 00:18:40.370 position:50% align:center

[AMAKUSA]
Jotaro!

00:18:49.295 --> 00:18:51.214 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
A traffic accident?

00:18:51.297 --> 00:18:53.508 position:50% align:center
[AMAKUSA]
She's in critical condition.

00:18:53.591 --> 00:18:56.386 position:50% align:center
I can figure something out
here with the other five.

00:18:56.469 --> 00:18:58.388 position:50% align:center
You get ready
to head back to Japan.

00:18:58.471 --> 00:19:01.766 position:50% align:center
I'll have a ticket
for you as soon as possible.

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:04.102 position:50% align:center
Leave me in. I'll stay.

00:19:04.185 --> 00:19:08.356 position:50% align:center
You'll what? Wait!
Jotaro! Jotaro!

00:19:21.036 --> 00:19:22.579 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:19:25.832 --> 00:19:29.169 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
Tomoyo. I...

00:19:34.007 --> 00:19:37.010 position:50% align:center
A second one?

00:19:41.473 --> 00:19:43.016 position:50% align:center
[TOMOYO]
Sometimes things are hard,

00:19:43.099 --> 00:19:44.934 position:50% align:center
or they don't go the way I want.

00:19:45.018 --> 00:19:48.188 position:50% align:center
But... I just have
to stick with it.

00:19:48.271 --> 00:19:51.608 position:50% align:center
I mean, this is
something I love doing.

00:19:51.691 --> 00:19:54.694 position:50% align:center
Nothing else matters, you know?

00:19:56.529 --> 00:19:59.366 position:50% align:center
Stick with it, huh?

00:19:59.449 --> 00:20:01.743 position:50% align:center
Just stick with it.

00:20:01.826 --> 00:20:04.204 position:50% align:center
[REI]
Don't be sad, just smile!

00:20:09.167 --> 00:20:11.169 position:50% align:center
I'll work hard. Okay?

00:20:11.252 --> 00:20:13.463 position:50% align:center
Even if Mom's not around now.

00:20:13.546 --> 00:20:15.965 position:50% align:center
So you have to
work hard, too, Dad.

00:20:16.049 --> 00:20:17.217 position:50% align:center
And no giving up.

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:20.470 position:50% align:center
Because I love watching
you do gymnastics!

00:20:23.139 --> 00:20:25.642 position:50% align:center
[TOMOYO] But... I just
have to stick with it.

00:20:25.725 --> 00:20:28.770 position:50% align:center
I mean, this is
something I love doing.

00:20:28.853 --> 00:20:31.898 position:50% align:center
Nothing else matters, you know?

00:20:31.981 --> 00:20:33.525 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:22:26.221 --> 00:22:28.223 position:50% align:center
Back home. Good work.

00:22:29.432 --> 00:22:32.435 position:50% align:center
[REI]
Hey, Where'd Leo go?

00:22:32.519 --> 00:22:35.105 position:50% align:center
Did he run off somewhere
to "train" again?

00:22:35.188 --> 00:22:35.730 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
Rei.

00:22:35.814 --> 00:22:36.648 position:50% align:center
[BB, REI]
Hmm?

00:22:36.731 --> 00:22:38.775 position:50% align:center
We need to talk about something.

00:22:38.858 --> 00:22:40.026 position:50% align:center
What?

00:22:41.069 --> 00:22:42.612 position:50% align:center
[REI]
He did?

00:22:42.696 --> 00:22:45.073 position:50% align:center
Yeah, so I've got to do it.

00:22:45.156 --> 00:22:48.785 position:50% align:center
I'll land the Aragaki Mark II
at All-Japan and win.

00:22:50.078 --> 00:22:52.455 position:50% align:center
I'll believe in him
like he does me

00:22:52.539 --> 00:22:54.207 position:50% align:center
and keep doing the
best I possibly can

00:22:54.290 --> 00:22:56.251 position:50% align:center
right up to the end.

00:22:56.334 --> 00:22:58.294 position:50% align:center
I'll keep believing in him, too.
