You are an embarrassment
to the sport of gymnastics.

Oh, right! Meanie!

Idiot. It's Tetsuo Minamino.

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:30.780 position:50% align:center
Well, what are
you doing here, kid?

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:33.116 position:50% align:center
No one told me
that you were coming.

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:34.117 position:50% align:center
Is Nakanomori up to--

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.036 position:50% align:center
It's nothing to do

Hey, uh, maybe stay out of this?

00:01:41.726 --> 00:01:44.854 position:50% align:center
[AMAKUSA] You're on.
You said you wanted a match.

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:45.939 position:50% align:center
We'll do it.

00:01:46.022 --> 00:01:47.982 position:50% align:center
Um. We will, really?

00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:50.193 position:50% align:center
Not now, but in six weeks.

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:51.653 position:50% align:center
He's got an injury.

00:01:51.736 --> 00:01:54.072 position:50% align:center
We need some time.

00:01:56.616 --> 00:01:58.368 position:50% align:center
You better bring it.

00:02:04.916 --> 00:02:07.460 position:50% align:center
We're having a
gymnastics duel, indeed!

00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:41.721 position:50% align:center
This is his performance
from last year's nationals.

00:03:41.805 --> 00:03:45.100 position:50% align:center
Watch this, his layout Tkatchev.

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:48.728 position:50% align:center
You notice that wide,
clean release?

00:03:48.812 --> 00:03:51.940 position:50% align:center
He can see the bar and confirm
where his hands will land.

00:03:52.023 --> 00:03:55.276 position:50% align:center
His aerial intuition
gives him a real edge.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.570 position:50% align:center
He lands multiple
difficult moves here,

00:03:57.654 --> 00:03:59.906 position:50% align:center
all of them close to perfection.

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.867 position:50% align:center
Came in fifth in
the individual all-around.

00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:10.750 position:50% align:center
[AMAKUSA]
And he's 17 years old.

00:04:10.834 --> 00:04:13.503 position:50% align:center
He's the sport's next ace,
no question.

00:04:13.586 --> 00:04:16.631 position:50% align:center
Given your injury, and the
training time it's cost you,

00:04:16.715 --> 00:04:18.466 position:50% align:center
chances are you're gonna lose.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.428 position:50% align:center
Uh?! Then why'd
we accept the match?

00:04:21.511 --> 00:04:23.304 position:50% align:center
The next competition's key.

00:04:23.388 --> 00:04:25.932 position:50% align:center
That'll be your big comeback.

00:04:26.016 --> 00:04:29.352 position:50% align:center
You need to reignite your
fighting spirit first, though.

00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:33.440 position:50% align:center
Practice is good,
but it won't be enough.

00:04:33.523 --> 00:04:35.692 position:50% align:center
And that is where
the kid comes in.

00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:38.611 position:50% align:center
You'll get the challenge of
facing a serious competitor

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:41.614 position:50% align:center
without the risk of
damaging your record.

00:04:41.698 --> 00:04:45.035 position:50% align:center
Sounds pretty perfect
if you ask me.

00:04:46.536 --> 00:04:48.872 position:50% align:center
What's wrong? You're not game?

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:50.999 position:50% align:center
That isn't like you.

00:04:51.082 --> 00:04:54.252 position:50% align:center
I figured you'd be
all over this kind of thing.

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:57.881 position:50% align:center
You better bring it.

00:04:57.964 --> 00:05:00.508 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
Hmm...

00:05:00.592 --> 00:05:06.556 position:50% align:center
Okay. I'm in. Let's do this.

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:09.225 position:50% align:center
Then come ready
to train tomorrow morning.

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:10.977 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:05:13.355 --> 00:05:15.857 position:50% align:center
[REI] Yay, you're not
fired anymore!

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.610 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad you were able to
make up with Mister Amakusa.

00:05:18.693 --> 00:05:22.572 position:50% align:center
Indeed, let's celebrate you
being an official gymnast again!

00:05:23.823 --> 00:05:24.949 position:50% align:center
We're all relieved.

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:26.284 position:50% align:center
Grandma, too.

00:05:26.368 --> 00:05:28.036 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
Huh?

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:31.289 position:50% align:center
That ever happens again, he can
find somewhere else to stay.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.211 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's true!

00:05:37.545 --> 00:05:38.630 position:50% align:center
[LEONARDO]
It gets better.

00:05:38.713 --> 00:05:40.799 position:50% align:center
We've got even more
good news to share!

00:05:40.882 --> 00:05:42.133 position:50% align:center
[REI]
Hmm?

00:05:42.217 --> 00:05:44.844 position:50% align:center
Joe is going to take on
another gymnast in a duel!

00:05:44.928 --> 00:05:47.847 position:50% align:center
A duel?

00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:51.267 position:50% align:center
Ohh... The one they were
talking about on the news?

00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:52.352 position:50% align:center
The "prince" guy.

00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:54.229 position:50% align:center
That's him, right?

00:05:54.312 --> 00:05:55.605 position:50% align:center
Is he really that good?

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:58.191 position:50% align:center
Yeah, seems like it.

00:05:58.274 --> 00:05:59.693 position:50% align:center
But you're a samurai.

00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:01.319 position:50% align:center
So you'll win for sure!

00:06:01.403 --> 00:06:05.115 position:50% align:center
Right! Let me know
if I can do anything to help.

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:06.449 position:50% align:center
Rei.

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:08.827 position:50% align:center
You know, just in case,
we should pray!

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:12.163 position:50% align:center
Please let Joe be
the victor of the duel.

00:06:15.417 --> 00:06:16.710 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:23.842 --> 00:06:25.385 position:50% align:center
Does it still hurt?

00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:26.845 position:50% align:center
A bit.

00:06:26.928 --> 00:06:28.805 position:50% align:center
Shoulder aside,
you're in good shape.

00:06:28.888 --> 00:06:31.433 position:50% align:center
The fatigue seems to be gone.

00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:33.935 position:50% align:center
I think you should be able
to resume practice now.

00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:35.562 position:50% align:center
Just in time.

00:06:35.645 --> 00:06:37.355 position:50% align:center
Let's get started!

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:39.524 position:50% align:center
I'm not gonna let you get
carried away, though.

00:06:39.607 --> 00:06:42.360 position:50% align:center
You'll do exactly
as I say. Got it?

00:06:42.444 --> 00:06:43.236 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
Got it.

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:44.529 position:50% align:center
[AMAKUSA]
Mm.

00:06:44.612 --> 00:06:46.906 position:50% align:center
In that case, we can
talk about your training.

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:50.160 position:50% align:center
Or, I should say, retraining.

00:06:50.243 --> 00:06:52.954 position:50% align:center
I have to retrain?

00:06:54.205 --> 00:06:56.041 position:50% align:center
[AMAKUSA]
He's a tough opponent, for sure,

00:06:56.124 --> 00:06:58.918 position:50% align:center
but not an unbeatable one.

00:06:59.002 --> 00:07:00.086 position:50% align:center
There.

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.297 position:50% align:center
You see the slight gap
between his legs?

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.632 position:50% align:center
We've got a
possible points deduction.

00:07:04.716 --> 00:07:06.092 position:50% align:center
Fact of the matter is,

00:07:06.176 --> 00:07:08.678 position:50% align:center
a difficult skill can lose
points as well as earn them.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.265 position:50% align:center
You know that from experience.

00:07:16.686 --> 00:07:18.104 position:50% align:center
[AMAKUSA]
Adding difficulty's not worth it

00:07:18.188 --> 00:07:20.148 position:50% align:center
if it results in deductions,

00:07:20.231 --> 00:07:23.860 position:50% align:center
and that means, we need
to focus on eliminating errors.

00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:27.030 position:50% align:center
But how?

00:07:27.113 --> 00:07:30.241 position:50% align:center
It starts with a sense of
stability in your body.

00:07:30.325 --> 00:07:33.703 position:50% align:center
Stability leads
to precise technique.

00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:35.580 position:50% align:center
Your muscles, your core.

00:07:35.663 --> 00:07:37.832 position:50% align:center
We'll retrain it all.

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:42.337 position:50% align:center
One more set!

00:07:49.678 --> 00:07:50.887 position:50% align:center
Tighten your core!

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:53.056 position:50% align:center
Don't just rely
on your strength.

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:55.350 position:50% align:center
We're talking
handstand basics, here.

00:07:55.433 --> 00:07:56.851 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.154 position:50% align:center
[REI]
Boo!

00:08:08.238 --> 00:08:10.407 position:50% align:center
You seem so happy lately, Dad!

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.326 position:50% align:center
Yeah? I've mainly just
been feeling worn out.

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:14.828 position:50% align:center
Oh, really?

00:08:14.911 --> 00:08:16.371 position:50% align:center
I don't know
the right way to put it--

00:08:16.454 --> 00:08:18.665 position:50% align:center
I guess it kinda seems like

00:08:18.748 --> 00:08:21.167 position:50% align:center
you're doing exactly
what you want to be doing!

00:08:21.251 --> 00:08:25.714 position:50% align:center
I think you're at your best when
you're focused on gymnastics!

00:08:25.797 --> 00:08:27.674 position:50% align:center
I am?

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:34.514 position:50% align:center
Yes. I am.

00:08:34.597 --> 00:08:38.560 position:50% align:center
[LEONARDO] Joe! I can help you
with your stretches, just ask!

00:08:38.643 --> 00:08:39.686 position:50% align:center
No, no, no, no, no!

00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:41.021 position:50% align:center
Now's not really the best time!

00:08:41.104 --> 00:08:44.649 position:50% align:center
Please, just stop.
Get off me, Leo!

00:08:44.733 --> 00:08:47.694 position:50% align:center
Leo, it's time for
Sunday Western Theater!

00:08:47.777 --> 00:08:50.113 position:50% align:center
Sunday what, now?

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.326 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:24.332 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
Yeah!

00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:35.218 position:50% align:center
[LEONARDO]
Joe, Joe, Joe!

00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:36.636 position:50% align:center
Way to go, Joe!

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.847 position:50% align:center
[BULLIES]
Samurai! Samurai!

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:43.560 position:50% align:center
[LEONARDO] What's this?
An angry mob? Oh! It's Rei!

00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:48.231 position:50% align:center
[BULLIES]
Samurai! Samurai!

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:50.483 position:50% align:center
Hey, wait! Come back here.

00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:55.655 position:50% align:center
[LEONARDO]
And then she just kept walking.

00:10:55.739 --> 00:10:57.907 position:50% align:center
Man, poor Rei.

00:10:57.991 --> 00:11:00.952 position:50% align:center
Any idea what it was about?

00:11:01.036 --> 00:11:02.746 position:50% align:center
Stuff like this.

00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:04.914 position:50% align:center
It's totally Balkan Peninsula!

00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:07.709 position:50% align:center
Balkan Peninsula?

00:11:07.792 --> 00:11:09.961 position:50% align:center
Now, go shop!

00:11:10.045 --> 00:11:11.796 position:50% align:center
[LEONARDO]
Indeed, at once!

00:11:14.049 --> 00:11:16.176 position:50% align:center
Hey, 'sup?

00:11:16.259 --> 00:11:17.761 position:50% align:center
What's with the outfit?

00:11:17.844 --> 00:11:20.221 position:50% align:center
Dude, the ninja look
is totally in this year.

00:11:20.305 --> 00:11:22.724 position:50% align:center
We're turning Ikebukuro
into Nikebukuro,

00:11:22.807 --> 00:11:24.392 position:50% align:center
and it's gonna
be sick, just watch!

00:11:24.476 --> 00:11:27.187 position:50% align:center
--Um, no.
--Anyway, I'm starving.

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:28.563 position:50% align:center
You wanna go grab some dinner?

00:11:28.646 --> 00:11:30.398 position:50% align:center
We sell food here, you know.

00:11:30.482 --> 00:11:31.858 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:31.941 --> 00:11:34.069 position:50% align:center
Well, I thought it might
be nice to get out for a bit.

00:11:34.152 --> 00:11:36.780 position:50% align:center
Like, just the two of us.

00:11:36.863 --> 00:11:39.157 position:50% align:center
Order.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.201 position:50% align:center
Fried udon, please.

00:11:45.246 --> 00:11:47.665 position:50% align:center
[AMAKUSA]
We've made some decent progress.

00:11:47.749 --> 00:11:50.543 position:50% align:center
How's the shoulder feel?

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:56.466 position:50% align:center
It's good.
Like, no pain at all. Whoa.

00:11:57.759 --> 00:11:59.803 position:50% align:center
A lot better, huh?
Most of the pain

00:11:59.886 --> 00:12:02.722 position:50% align:center
was coming from chronic
inflammation of the joint.

00:12:02.806 --> 00:12:04.641 position:50% align:center
The solution's pretty simple.

00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:07.852 position:50% align:center
Train to strengthen the inner
muscle that supports the joint.

00:12:07.936 --> 00:12:10.313 position:50% align:center
So, now, we can move on.

00:12:10.397 --> 00:12:12.399 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't say
you're fully recovered,

00:12:12.482 --> 00:12:14.776 position:50% align:center
but it's time
to shift our focus.

00:12:16.653 --> 00:12:18.738 position:50% align:center
Here, I've got
your routine all set.

00:12:18.822 --> 00:12:21.991 position:50% align:center
Take a good look--we
start practicing it today.

00:12:23.576 --> 00:12:25.954 position:50% align:center
[AMAKUSA] And, no,
the Aragaki's not on there.

00:12:26.037 --> 00:12:27.580 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:27.664 --> 00:12:28.790 position:50% align:center
[AMAKUSA]
An incredible triple flip

00:12:28.873 --> 00:12:31.418 position:50% align:center
that leaves the audience
gasping every time.

00:12:31.501 --> 00:12:32.794 position:50% align:center
Your invention
and the hardest flight

00:12:32.877 --> 00:12:35.422 position:50% align:center
move on the horizontal bar.

00:12:35.505 --> 00:12:37.841 position:50% align:center
Also a huge strain
on the shoulders.

00:12:37.924 --> 00:12:40.719 position:50% align:center
Sorry. You're just
not ready for it.

00:12:40.802 --> 00:12:43.930 position:50% align:center
I'm fully aware that the Aragaki
is a special move for you,

00:12:44.014 --> 00:12:46.391 position:50% align:center
and not only because it's
one you invented.

00:12:48.309 --> 00:12:52.439 position:50% align:center
But, it's my responsibility to
do what's best for you.

00:12:53.481 --> 00:12:55.608 position:50% align:center
[AMAKUSA]
As your coach.

00:12:56.276 --> 00:12:57.485 position:50% align:center
And I trust you.

00:12:57.569 --> 00:13:00.238 position:50% align:center
A lot of things have
changed, but that hasn't.

00:13:03.992 --> 00:13:06.453 position:50% align:center
And now,
our last profile of the night.

00:13:06.536 --> 00:13:08.788 position:50% align:center
We'll turn to the
gymnastics world--

00:13:08.872 --> 00:13:12.083 position:50% align:center
and the talented young gymnast
who's been stirring things up.

00:13:12.167 --> 00:13:16.129 position:50% align:center
Tetsuo Minamino, also known
as the "Bandana Prince"!

00:13:16.212 --> 00:13:19.758 position:50% align:center
Hey, your duel with him's
this coming Sunday, isn't it?

00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:20.467 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:22.093 position:50% align:center
Well, you ready?

00:13:23.553 --> 00:13:25.889 position:50% align:center
I feel good!

00:13:26.681 --> 00:13:29.225 position:50% align:center
I'll pack lunch
and go cheer you on!

00:13:29.309 --> 00:13:31.644 position:50% align:center
I'll also be there
to show my support!

00:13:31.728 --> 00:13:33.605 position:50% align:center
You too, Lady Mari?

00:13:33.688 --> 00:13:36.483 position:50% align:center
I can't make it.
Gotta watch the bar.

00:13:36.566 --> 00:13:39.235 position:50% align:center
Okay. You'll come, though?

00:13:39.319 --> 00:13:42.781 position:50% align:center
[BB]
Hm?! Hmm...

00:13:42.864 --> 00:13:44.866 position:50% align:center
I'm a bird, you know.

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.123 position:50% align:center
[AMAKUSA]
Why are you still here?

00:13:52.207 --> 00:13:53.917 position:50% align:center
Coulda sworn I told you
to head home early

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.628 position:50% align:center
so you'll be nice
and rested for tomorrow.

00:13:56.711 --> 00:13:59.673 position:50% align:center
Right. I'll go in a minute.

00:13:59.756 --> 00:14:00.799 position:50% align:center
What's the deal?

00:14:00.882 --> 00:14:02.342 position:50% align:center
Nerves getting to you?

00:14:02.425 --> 00:14:04.386 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Sure, that's it.

00:14:04.469 --> 00:14:07.013 position:50% align:center
Cut the crap.

00:14:07.097 --> 00:14:11.768 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
I guess it just feels surreal.

00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:13.978 position:50% align:center
I bombed at nationals.

00:14:14.062 --> 00:14:16.106 position:50% align:center
I was even set to retire.

00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:21.236 position:50% align:center
But... I'm still here.
Still fighting.

00:14:22.821 --> 00:14:25.740 position:50% align:center
So, tomorrow, I'm gonna
give it everything I've got

00:14:25.824 --> 00:14:28.284 position:50% align:center
and see how far I can go.

00:14:28.368 --> 00:14:32.580 position:50% align:center
I'm back, doing
what I love the most.

00:14:32.664 --> 00:14:35.083 position:50% align:center
It's like a turtle's shell.

00:14:35.166 --> 00:14:37.836 position:50% align:center
Without gymnastics,
you're not complete.

00:14:37.919 --> 00:14:40.839 position:50% align:center
That's what the sport is to you.

00:14:40.922 --> 00:14:44.676 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
Amakusa, I like turtles, too.

00:14:44.759 --> 00:14:46.678 position:50% align:center
[AMAKUSA]
Oh, you idiot.

00:14:57.355 --> 00:14:59.524 position:50% align:center
Let's go.

00:14:59.607 --> 00:15:01.901 position:50% align:center
[AMAKUSA] I got special
permission to use the gym.

00:15:03.778 --> 00:15:07.657 position:50% align:center
They're normally closed,
but I explained the situation.

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:20.462 position:50% align:center
Looking forward to our match.

00:15:31.014 --> 00:15:33.016 position:50% align:center
I'll judge you both impartially.

00:15:33.099 --> 00:15:34.601 position:50% align:center
That okay?

00:15:36.519 --> 00:15:38.605 position:50% align:center
Jotaro, you're up first.

00:15:41.733 --> 00:15:43.401 position:50% align:center
Go on, man! You've got this!

00:15:43.485 --> 00:15:46.696 position:50% align:center
Joe! Show him
your samurai spirit, indeed!

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.282 position:50% align:center
Do your best. Good luck!

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:58.416 position:50% align:center
You ready?

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:00.502 position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:16:19.229 --> 00:16:20.730 position:50% align:center
So high!

00:16:21.648 --> 00:16:23.566 position:50% align:center
That's what sets him
apart on the bar.

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:26.695 position:50% align:center
Jotaro's height is what
earned him his medals.

00:16:27.237 --> 00:16:29.239 position:50% align:center
The layout Kovacs!

00:16:32.909 --> 00:16:34.577 position:50% align:center
Old school Kovacs!

00:16:37.872 --> 00:16:39.082 position:50% align:center
Moron, you're too far!

00:16:39.165 --> 00:16:40.291 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:40.375 --> 00:16:42.335 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
I'm too far. Can I grab it?

00:16:44.129 --> 00:16:46.172 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
Yes. I can!

00:16:51.302 --> 00:16:53.722 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
I've got this. I can do it!

00:17:21.124 --> 00:17:23.543 position:50% align:center
[TAKIZAWA]
Yeah! Stuck that landing!

00:17:28.798 --> 00:17:30.800 position:50% align:center
You looked
awesome up there, man.

00:17:30.884 --> 00:17:32.719 position:50% align:center
Crazy-good performance!

00:17:32.802 --> 00:17:35.138 position:50% align:center
Yes. That was
truly brilliant, Joe!

00:17:35.221 --> 00:17:36.264 position:50% align:center
Great job, Dad!

00:17:36.348 --> 00:17:39.184 position:50% align:center
Watching you up
there again was amazing.

00:17:41.394 --> 00:17:42.812 position:50% align:center
[TETSUO]
Idiots.

00:17:46.358 --> 00:17:47.859 position:50% align:center
Move it.

00:17:53.198 --> 00:17:55.658 position:50% align:center
Wonder what
his routine will be like.

00:18:07.837 --> 00:18:09.589 position:50% align:center
A perfect layout Kovacs.

00:18:09.673 --> 00:18:12.217 position:50% align:center
Looks like he's improved
since the nationals.

00:18:14.219 --> 00:18:15.845 position:50% align:center
He's so good.

00:18:31.611 --> 00:18:32.737 position:50% align:center
A triple flip?

00:18:32.821 --> 00:18:35.073 position:50% align:center
Hey, Dad, that's your move.

00:18:35.156 --> 00:18:37.283 position:50% align:center
Did he just...?

00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:54.092 position:50% align:center
[TETSUO]
Do you get it now?

00:18:54.175 --> 00:18:58.555 position:50% align:center
There's no place for you in
gymnastics anymore, old man.

00:18:59.514 --> 00:19:02.892 position:50% align:center
Now quit.
You're done in this sport.

00:19:02.976 --> 00:19:03.977 position:50% align:center
What happened?

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:05.854 position:50% align:center
Did you lose, Dad?

00:19:08.189 --> 00:19:11.693 position:50% align:center
Amazing. He corrected
his errors--

00:19:11.776 --> 00:19:14.362 position:50% align:center
perfected every skill
in that routine.

00:19:14.446 --> 00:19:16.448 position:50% align:center
And that Aragaki.

00:19:16.531 --> 00:19:19.826 position:50% align:center
In such a short time,
he mastered it.

00:19:24.998 --> 00:19:28.418 position:50% align:center
That means,
I can totally still do this!

00:19:28.501 --> 00:19:29.753 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:29.836 --> 00:19:32.088 position:50% align:center
You've proved what
I'm trying to do is possible.

00:19:32.172 --> 00:19:33.173 position:50% align:center
Thank you!

00:19:33.256 --> 00:19:35.050 position:50% align:center
Back off!

00:19:35.133 --> 00:19:38.887 position:50% align:center
I said if you lost
you had to quit for real.

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:40.805 position:50% align:center
Wait, what?

00:19:40.889 --> 00:19:43.224 position:50% align:center
Oh, you're gonna play dumb?

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:51.149 position:50% align:center
Ninja... <i>Dogeza</i> !

00:19:51.232 --> 00:19:52.484 position:50% align:center
--Huh?
--Huh?

00:19:52.567 --> 00:19:53.526 position:50% align:center
What are you doing?

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:54.903 position:50% align:center
[LEONARDO]
I'm begging you!

00:19:54.986 --> 00:19:58.448 position:50% align:center
Please let Joe continue
with gymnastics!

00:19:58.531 --> 00:20:02.369 position:50% align:center
He may have lost the duel, but
his performance was fantastic!

00:20:02.452 --> 00:20:04.579 position:50% align:center
Watching him gave me chills.

00:20:04.662 --> 00:20:09.084 position:50% align:center
That routine--came from
the heart of a true samurai!

00:20:09.959 --> 00:20:12.587 position:50% align:center
So, please, let me see more.

00:20:12.671 --> 00:20:14.130 position:50% align:center
Let him compete!

00:20:14.214 --> 00:20:16.716 position:50% align:center
Don't take gymnastics from Joe!

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.468 position:50% align:center
Leo.

00:20:19.844 --> 00:20:21.513 position:50% align:center
[AMAKUSA]
I second that.

00:20:22.222 --> 00:20:23.682 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
Amakusa?

00:20:23.765 --> 00:20:26.976 position:50% align:center
His performance should be even
better at the next competition.

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:31.356 position:50% align:center
It'll muzzle the people accusing
him of faking his retirement.

00:20:31.439 --> 00:20:34.275 position:50% align:center
So, please, relent.

00:20:35.068 --> 00:20:36.861 position:50% align:center
[LEONARDO]
Please, indeed!

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:54.254 position:50% align:center
This is stupid.

00:21:03.638 --> 00:21:07.225 position:50% align:center
Wait! See you at the next meet.

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:18.194 position:50% align:center
[AMAKUSA]
Jotaro. There's no time to rest.

00:21:18.278 --> 00:21:20.697 position:50% align:center
The next competition's
in the spring.

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.824 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna push
you harder than ever.

00:21:22.907 --> 00:21:24.701 position:50% align:center
So you better get ready.

00:21:27.454 --> 00:21:28.788 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
Right!

00:23:00.088 --> 00:23:02.215 position:50% align:center
[HOMELESS MAN A] You kiddin' me,
that was a fixed race!

00:23:02.298 --> 00:23:03.591 position:50% align:center
[HOMELESS MAN B]
Seriously.

00:23:03.675 --> 00:23:06.553 position:50% align:center
Can't go around pullin'
crap like that.

00:23:06.636 --> 00:23:07.721 position:50% align:center
[HOMELESS MAN A]
Hmm?
