[AMAKUSA] Now, it's looking
like we're gonna be holding

00:00:09.884 --> 00:00:12.512 position:50% align:center
a joint training camp
with China.

00:00:12.595 --> 00:00:15.765 position:50% align:center
You're one of the gymnasts
being tapped to participate.

00:00:17.142 --> 00:00:18.977 position:50% align:center
[AMAKUSA] That's the objective:
to get top gymnasts together

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.396 position:50% align:center
who can heighten
each other's skills.

00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:25.525 position:50% align:center
Liu Longxiang, China's
superstar, will be there, too.

00:00:25.608 --> 00:00:28.111 position:50% align:center
I think this is
exactly what you need.

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:29.571 position:50% align:center
When does it start?

00:00:29.654 --> 00:00:31.531 position:50% align:center
It's slated for
the beginning of July.

00:00:31.614 --> 00:00:32.866 position:50% align:center
First through sixth.

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:33.992 position:50% align:center
Ah...

00:00:34.075 --> 00:00:35.660 position:50% align:center
Not July.

00:00:35.744 --> 00:00:36.953 position:50% align:center
What, are you busy?

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.250 position:50% align:center
Well, it's Rei's birthday.

00:00:42.334 --> 00:00:44.085 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:00:45.503 --> 00:00:48.506 position:50% align:center
[KAZU]
A lost cicada, a stray hat,

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.468 position:50% align:center
and the sound of
waves stuck in my ears.

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:53.011 position:50% align:center
All of these things...

00:00:53.094 --> 00:00:55.638 position:50% align:center
[REI] If you're not back for
my birthday, we're not family.

00:02:31.276 --> 00:02:32.736 position:50% align:center
Hey, where's Leo?

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.821 position:50% align:center
Is he not back yet?

00:02:34.904 --> 00:02:37.032 position:50% align:center
No, not yet.

00:02:37.115 --> 00:02:38.700 position:50% align:center
Ugh, that is so not cool.

00:02:38.783 --> 00:02:41.244 position:50% align:center
I could really use
some help around here.

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:43.955 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm sure
he'll be back soon.

00:02:46.916 --> 00:02:49.252 position:50% align:center
Leo came to us out of nowhere,

00:02:49.336 --> 00:02:52.630 position:50% align:center
so it only makes sense that
he'd leave the same way.

00:02:54.758 --> 00:02:56.551 position:50% align:center
He's a fugitive ninja.

00:02:56.634 --> 00:02:57.927 position:50% align:center
Where'd he go?

00:02:58.011 --> 00:03:00.847 position:50% align:center
We accept those who come
and respect those who leave.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.308 position:50% align:center
And above all, we don't pry.

00:03:10.315 --> 00:03:12.525 position:50% align:center
Well, bye! See ya, Ayu!

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:14.277 position:50% align:center
Yeah, laters!

00:03:14.361 --> 00:03:16.821 position:50% align:center
Rei, be careful.

00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:18.531 position:50% align:center
Sure!

00:03:21.326 --> 00:03:23.787 position:50% align:center
Okay, that was a little harsh.

00:03:26.706 --> 00:03:28.583 position:50% align:center
[MARI] I shoulda promised
he'd come back?

00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:31.544 position:50% align:center
I'm not in the business
of false hope.

00:03:35.548 --> 00:03:37.342 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
I'm home!

00:03:37.425 --> 00:03:38.885 position:50% align:center

Hey.

00:03:38.968 --> 00:03:40.011 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
Hmm?

00:03:41.012 --> 00:03:43.598 position:50% align:center
What, still no Leo?

00:03:43.682 --> 00:03:45.684 position:50% align:center
Nope. Still not back.

00:03:48.353 --> 00:03:49.604 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Young people
are wandering the streets

00:03:49.688 --> 00:03:52.190 position:50% align:center
of Ikebukuro, wreaking havoc.

00:03:52.273 --> 00:03:54.651 position:50% align:center
Who knows what they'll do next?

00:03:56.361 --> 00:03:59.030 position:50% align:center
All these street gangs
and gal circles.

00:03:59.114 --> 00:04:00.615 position:50% align:center
It's crazy.

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:01.825 position:50% align:center
You should be careful

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:04.202 position:50% align:center
when you're coming home
from practice late.

00:04:04.285 --> 00:04:06.037 position:50% align:center
You're right.

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:11.710 position:50% align:center
Actually, we need
to talk about that.

00:04:11.793 --> 00:04:15.171 position:50% align:center
What? We need to talk
about street gangs?

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:17.632 position:50% align:center
No, um, practice.

00:04:17.716 --> 00:04:18.967 position:50% align:center
[exhales]

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.136 position:50% align:center
I thought that you'd joined
a gang or something.

00:04:23.346 --> 00:04:25.390 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
Anyway, the thing is,

00:04:25.473 --> 00:04:28.143 position:50% align:center
there's this special
training camp coming up.

00:04:28.226 --> 00:04:29.394 position:50% align:center
[REI]
Oh, yeah?

00:04:29.477 --> 00:04:32.439 position:50% align:center
Yeah. It's a joint one
with Japan and China.

00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:34.983 position:50% align:center
All their top gymnasts
are gonna be there.

00:04:35.066 --> 00:04:36.359 position:50% align:center
That's awesome!

00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:37.736 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
Mm-hmm.

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:42.490 position:50% align:center
But... there is one problem.

00:04:42.574 --> 00:04:43.950 position:50% align:center
The training camp.

00:04:44.034 --> 00:04:47.871 position:50% align:center
It's in July.
First through sixth.

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:51.583 position:50% align:center
I know, that means
I'd be gone for your birthday.

00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:54.878 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO] But the team
from China is supposed to be

00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:56.671 position:50% align:center
the best in the world.

00:04:56.755 --> 00:04:59.174 position:50% align:center
I'd get to watch them
practice up close.

00:04:59.257 --> 00:05:02.093 position:50% align:center
So, if it's okay.

00:05:02.177 --> 00:05:05.013 position:50% align:center
I'd really like to participate.

00:05:11.895 --> 00:05:14.439 position:50% align:center
[REI] Well,
that's a tough call, but...

00:05:14.522 --> 00:05:16.024 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:05:16.107 --> 00:05:18.943 position:50% align:center
I can't ask you to miss out on
something important like that.

00:05:19.027 --> 00:05:21.363 position:50% align:center
We'll still celebrate
your birthday, I swear!

00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:23.073 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry!

00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:24.991 position:50% align:center
It's okay.

00:05:41.049 --> 00:05:44.135 position:50% align:center
Don't be sad. Just smile.

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:45.720 position:50% align:center

Hey, Mom.
My birthday's coming up.

00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:20.630 position:50% align:center
Dad won't be around,
and Leo still hasn't come back.

00:06:20.714 --> 00:06:21.798 position:50% align:center
But I'll be fine.

00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:25.051 position:50% align:center

so hard lately.

00:06:25.135 --> 00:06:27.012 position:50% align:center
It's just one day.

00:12:05.517 --> 00:12:07.894 position:50% align:center
Please, sir, you have
to make him better!

00:12:12.315 --> 00:12:14.567 position:50% align:center
This is all my fault.

00:12:24.411 --> 00:12:26.121 position:50% align:center
Hey, I'm back.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.792 position:50% align:center
Rei?

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:34.713 position:50% align:center
She at the bar?

00:12:34.796 --> 00:12:36.715 position:50% align:center
[door sliding open]

00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:41.219 position:50% align:center
Joe! I have returned
from my journey!

00:12:41.302 --> 00:12:43.513 position:50% align:center
What have you been
doing this whole time?

00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:44.681 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:44.764 --> 00:12:47.600 position:50% align:center
I wrote that I was
going off for training.

00:12:47.684 --> 00:12:50.812 position:50% align:center
Now, Rachel,
where are you hiding?

00:12:50.895 --> 00:12:52.856 position:50% align:center
She's not here.

00:12:52.939 --> 00:12:54.816 position:50% align:center
[LEONARDO] Did she go out
for a walk with BB?

00:12:54.899 --> 00:12:56.443 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:13:04.409 --> 00:13:06.036 position:50% align:center
Rei.

00:13:07.037 --> 00:13:10.623 position:50% align:center
[phone rings]

00:13:11.916 --> 00:13:15.295 position:50% align:center
Joe, where are Rachel and BB?
Don't you know?

00:13:15.378 --> 00:13:19.674 position:50% align:center
[phone rings]

00:13:19.758 --> 00:13:20.675 position:50% align:center
Hello?

00:13:20.759 --> 00:13:21.676 position:50% align:center
[MARI]
Who is this?

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.095 position:50% align:center
It's me, Jotaro.

00:13:24.179 --> 00:13:25.638 position:50% align:center
[MARI]
Where's Rei? It's so loud,

00:13:25.722 --> 00:13:28.224 position:50% align:center
I didn't hear the
phone ring when she called.

00:13:28.308 --> 00:13:31.102 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO] She was gone
when I got back. BB, too.

00:13:31.186 --> 00:13:32.645 position:50% align:center
She didn't leave a note?

00:13:32.729 --> 00:13:34.064 position:50% align:center
No.

00:13:34.147 --> 00:13:36.816 position:50% align:center
If she's not here or with you,
then where would she go?

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:38.985 position:50% align:center
Maybe there was an emergency.

00:13:39.069 --> 00:13:40.987 position:50% align:center
I'll go and look.

00:13:41.071 --> 00:13:42.280 position:50% align:center
What happened?
She's gone?

00:13:42.364 --> 00:13:44.115 position:50% align:center
And you have no idea where?

00:13:48.286 --> 00:13:50.413 position:50% align:center
[LEONARDO]
I'll help you look, indeed!

00:13:53.166 --> 00:13:54.793 position:50% align:center
You head over
to the supermarket.

00:13:54.876 --> 00:13:56.336 position:50% align:center
Roger!

00:13:58.797 --> 00:14:01.091 position:50% align:center
[MARI]
Sorry to bother you with this.

00:14:01.174 --> 00:14:03.051 position:50% align:center
I appreciate it.

00:14:03.134 --> 00:14:06.137 position:50% align:center
Yeah, yeah,
"Operation 'Bukuroad" is a-go.

00:14:06.221 --> 00:14:08.598 position:50% align:center
KK, thank you!

00:14:08.682 --> 00:14:10.100 position:50% align:center
Where are you, Rei?

00:14:10.183 --> 00:14:12.060 position:50% align:center
Please! Rachel!

00:14:12.143 --> 00:14:14.854 position:50% align:center
If you can hear me,
say something!

00:15:03.111 --> 00:15:04.487 position:50% align:center
Ms. Mari, we got her.

00:15:04.571 --> 00:15:08.533 position:50% align:center
Ayu? "Operation 'Bukuroad"
is complete.

00:15:15.165 --> 00:15:16.124 position:50% align:center
[MARI]
Rei.

00:15:16.207 --> 00:15:17.709 position:50% align:center
Hey, Grandma.

00:15:17.792 --> 00:15:20.378 position:50% align:center
There's my little delinquent.

00:15:20.462 --> 00:15:22.130 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry.

00:15:22.213 --> 00:15:25.175 position:50% align:center
I didn't know what to do.

00:15:29.679 --> 00:15:31.931 position:50% align:center
I'm usually fine.
I mean, Dad goes off

00:15:32.015 --> 00:15:34.893 position:50% align:center
to competitions and
practice all the time.

00:15:34.976 --> 00:15:38.396 position:50% align:center
But having BB around
always made it better, you know?

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.023 position:50% align:center
And then we got Leo.

00:15:40.106 --> 00:15:41.191 position:50% align:center
He was there to play with me

00:15:41.274 --> 00:15:44.069 position:50% align:center
and make stuff fun
even when Dad was gone.

00:15:44.152 --> 00:15:47.113 position:50% align:center
He listened
when I needed to talk.

00:15:47.197 --> 00:15:50.450 position:50% align:center
Then he left us with
nothing but a dumb note,

00:15:50.533 --> 00:15:51.910 position:50% align:center
and suddenly things
that had been fine

00:15:51.993 --> 00:15:54.579 position:50% align:center
weren't fine at all anymore.

00:15:54.662 --> 00:15:56.915 position:50% align:center
I got so angry and stupid.

00:15:56.998 --> 00:16:00.335 position:50% align:center
Now BB's sick because of me.

00:16:00.418 --> 00:16:01.836 position:50% align:center
I wanted to be like Mom,

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:05.382 position:50% align:center
but I'm just getting further
and further away from that.

00:16:05.465 --> 00:16:07.592 position:50% align:center
I'm lost.
I don't know what to do.

00:16:10.387 --> 00:16:12.472 position:50% align:center
So, is that the problem?

00:16:12.555 --> 00:16:15.266 position:50% align:center
Well, time to
change course, then.

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:16.643 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:16.726 --> 00:16:18.436 position:50% align:center
[MARI] For starters,
Tomoyo was a little different

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.063 position:50% align:center
than the way you imagine her.

00:16:20.146 --> 00:16:21.439 position:50% align:center
What?

00:16:21.523 --> 00:16:24.442 position:50% align:center
It's true, she was
normally prim and proper,

00:16:24.526 --> 00:16:28.571 position:50% align:center
but when she got sloppy,
she got real sloppy.

00:16:28.655 --> 00:16:31.783 position:50% align:center
When she got mad,
she yelled real loud.

00:16:31.866 --> 00:16:35.286 position:50% align:center
Sometimes it went
beyond yelling.

00:16:36.287 --> 00:16:37.956 position:50% align:center
Mom did that?

00:16:38.039 --> 00:16:39.165 position:50% align:center
Of course, kid.

00:16:39.249 --> 00:16:42.168 position:50% align:center
Everyone needs to vent,
or they'll go crazy.

00:16:42.252 --> 00:16:43.712 position:50% align:center
Especially with your dad.

00:16:43.795 --> 00:16:46.423 position:50% align:center
He's a guy who really
needs things spelled out.

00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:48.925 position:50% align:center
"Clueless" doesn't
begin to describe him.

00:16:49.009 --> 00:16:50.301 position:50% align:center
[REI]
But...

00:16:50.385 --> 00:16:53.388 position:50% align:center
But that's not how she
acted in front of you, right?

00:16:53.471 --> 00:16:54.556 position:50% align:center
[REI]
Mm-hmm.

00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:57.726 position:50% align:center
She was always so kind,
and always smiled.

00:16:57.809 --> 00:17:00.186 position:50% align:center
She supported Dad
no matter what.

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:01.730 position:50% align:center
[MARI]
You were her baby girl.

00:17:01.813 --> 00:17:04.733 position:50% align:center
Of course she wanted
to set a good example.

00:17:04.816 --> 00:17:07.485 position:50% align:center
Now, tell me, what was her job?

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:10.447 position:50% align:center
Huh? She was an actress!

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:12.866 position:50% align:center
[MARI] And you got
to see her act every day.

00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:15.535 position:50% align:center
From the best seat in the house.

00:17:18.038 --> 00:17:19.039 position:50% align:center
You don't have
to keep pretending

00:17:19.122 --> 00:17:22.584 position:50% align:center
like everything
is fine when it's not.

00:17:22.667 --> 00:17:25.628 position:50% align:center
If you need to say something,
then just say it.

00:17:26.421 --> 00:17:28.381 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
Rei!

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.724 position:50% align:center
You're okay. Rei.

00:17:37.807 --> 00:17:40.894 position:50% align:center
I was worried. So, so worried!

00:17:40.977 --> 00:17:43.063 position:50% align:center
You can't just
wander off like that.

00:17:43.146 --> 00:17:44.606 position:50% align:center
It's dangerous!

00:17:44.689 --> 00:17:46.107 position:50% align:center
Do you know what
could have happened to you?

00:17:46.191 --> 00:17:48.818 position:50% align:center
Do you?

00:17:51.112 --> 00:17:54.115 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO] Sorry. Maybe we
can go to the park tomorrow.

00:17:54.199 --> 00:17:56.951 position:50% align:center
[REI] It's okay.
Do your best at practice!

00:17:57.035 --> 00:17:58.620 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO] I've got
a competition coming up,

00:17:58.703 --> 00:18:00.497 position:50% align:center
so I can't play right now.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.457 position:50% align:center
[REI] I'm fine.
I'll just watch some movies.

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:03.792 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
Sorry, Rei.

00:18:03.875 --> 00:18:05.126 position:50% align:center
[REI]
It's fine!

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:06.628 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
Rei, I'm sorry.

00:18:06.711 --> 00:18:08.213 position:50% align:center
[REI]
I know, Dad.

00:18:08.296 --> 00:18:09.923 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
I'm really sorry!

00:18:10.006 --> 00:18:11.800 position:50% align:center
[REI]
Don't worry about it.

00:18:12.592 --> 00:18:14.344 position:50% align:center
Happy birthday, sweetheart!

00:18:14.427 --> 00:18:16.262 position:50% align:center
Ready for your present?

00:18:18.473 --> 00:18:20.100 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Daddy!

00:18:20.183 --> 00:18:22.519 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
Don't wander too far, okay?

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:25.438 position:50% align:center
[REI]
Hey, Dad.

00:18:28.108 --> 00:18:29.401 position:50% align:center
The thing is,

00:18:29.484 --> 00:18:32.320 position:50% align:center
I never told you,
but I can't ride a bike!

00:18:32.404 --> 00:18:33.697 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:36.116 position:50% align:center
I was so happy when
you bought it for me.

00:18:36.199 --> 00:18:39.411 position:50% align:center
It was such a great present.

00:18:39.494 --> 00:18:42.288 position:50% align:center
But, that was right
before a competition,

00:18:42.372 --> 00:18:46.084 position:50% align:center
so I couldn't ask you
to teach me how to ride it!

00:18:50.588 --> 00:18:52.007 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:54.551 position:50% align:center
I'm... sorry!

00:18:54.634 --> 00:18:56.511 position:50% align:center
So sorry!

00:18:56.594 --> 00:19:01.433 position:50% align:center
Really! Rei. Oh, Rei! I'm sorry.

00:19:01.516 --> 00:19:05.270 position:50% align:center
Always causing problems for
the poor women in your life.

00:19:05.353 --> 00:19:08.857 position:50% align:center
How did I give birth
to such a problem child?

00:19:10.984 --> 00:19:13.570 position:50% align:center
Please forgive me!

00:19:13.653 --> 00:19:16.448 position:50% align:center
Rachel, I'm so happy
to see you, indeed!

00:19:17.741 --> 00:19:18.950 position:50% align:center
[REI]
Leo?

00:19:19.034 --> 00:19:21.494 position:50% align:center
Now, then, why'd you
go running off like that?

00:19:21.578 --> 00:19:24.039 position:50% align:center
I've been so worried about you!

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:26.708 position:50% align:center
You've been worried?!

00:19:28.168 --> 00:19:29.836 position:50% align:center
Uh, what's wrong?

00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:31.379 position:50% align:center
[REI]
You left with no warning!

00:19:31.463 --> 00:19:33.006 position:50% align:center
Where have you been
this whole time?

00:19:33.089 --> 00:19:34.591 position:50% align:center
I told you, I was training--

00:19:34.674 --> 00:19:36.384 position:50% align:center
[REI] You didn't say
how long you'd be gone!

00:19:36.468 --> 00:19:38.595 position:50% align:center
I thought I'd never
see you again!

00:19:38.678 --> 00:19:39.971 position:50% align:center
You stupid ninja!

00:19:40.055 --> 00:19:44.809 position:50% align:center
[LEONARDO] Uh...
Um. Ninja Art. Dogeza!

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.815 position:50% align:center
Morning, everyone!

00:19:50.899 --> 00:19:52.484 position:50% align:center
Bigbird, you're back!

00:19:52.567 --> 00:19:55.111 position:50% align:center
Yes, he should be fine now.

00:19:55.195 --> 00:19:56.279 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry!

00:19:56.363 --> 00:19:58.948 position:50% align:center
Don't be sad. Just smile!

00:20:06.206 --> 00:20:08.583 position:50% align:center
Only go as fast as you want to.

00:20:09.793 --> 00:20:12.337 position:50% align:center
Where there's a will,
there's a way, Rachel!

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.547 position:50% align:center
All right. I'll hold on.

00:20:14.631 --> 00:20:16.549 position:50% align:center
Start off nice and slow.

00:20:16.633 --> 00:20:20.804 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah! Rachel!
You've totally got this!

00:20:24.808 --> 00:20:28.353 position:50% align:center
Wait up! Seriously.
You're going too fast!

00:20:28.436 --> 00:20:30.063 position:50% align:center
What?

00:20:32.524 --> 00:20:33.483 position:50% align:center
[REI]
Dad, look!

00:20:33.566 --> 00:20:35.610 position:50% align:center
I'm riding a bike!

00:20:37.362 --> 00:20:39.739 position:50% align:center
It was easy!

00:20:39.823 --> 00:20:42.283 position:50% align:center
She has a very good sense
of balance, indeed.

00:20:42.367 --> 00:20:44.744 position:50% align:center
Well, that's
my daughter for you.

00:20:45.412 --> 00:20:48.623 position:50% align:center
BB, come here!

00:20:48.707 --> 00:20:49.624 position:50% align:center
Who, me?

00:20:49.708 --> 00:20:52.085 position:50% align:center
[BB screams]

00:20:52.168 --> 00:20:53.628 position:50% align:center
Hang on, BB!

00:20:57.966 --> 00:21:00.885 position:50% align:center
[BB]
BB!

00:21:01.678 --> 00:21:04.556 position:50% align:center
Hey, BB, we're flying!

00:21:08.268 --> 00:21:10.937 position:50% align:center
Rachel seems like
she'll be fine now.
