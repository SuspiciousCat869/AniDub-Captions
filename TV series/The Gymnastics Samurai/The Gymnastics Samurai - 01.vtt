There was plenty of hype

individual medals--

00:01:29.047 --> 00:01:34.386 position:50% align:center

so I can keep up!

Tell me. How's the shoulder?

You can push yourself to the max

00:20:24.724 --> 00:20:28.269 position:50% align:center
I married a woman I didn't
deserve, and we had a daughter.

00:20:28.353 --> 00:20:31.231 position:50% align:center
She's an amazing little girl.

00:20:31.314 --> 00:20:33.775 position:50% align:center
And I'm proud to be her father.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:38.738 position:50% align:center
She told me once that she loved
watching me do gymnastics,

00:20:38.822 --> 00:20:42.283 position:50% align:center
and I thought maybe it meant
she's proud of me too.

00:20:42.367 --> 00:20:44.536 position:50% align:center
Having a family
changed some things,

00:20:44.619 --> 00:20:45.829 position:50% align:center
but not my love for gymnastics

00:20:45.912 --> 00:20:49.040 position:50% align:center
or the strength that
I drew from the sport.

00:20:49.124 --> 00:20:50.625 position:50% align:center
Until now,

00:20:50.709 --> 00:20:54.838 position:50% align:center
I've lived most of my life as
a gymnast, first and foremost.

00:20:54.921 --> 00:20:57.257 position:50% align:center
But after giving it
careful thought,

00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:00.468 position:50% align:center
I've come to a decision.

00:21:00.552 --> 00:21:03.471 position:50% align:center
Today, I'm here
to announce that I,

00:21:03.555 --> 00:21:08.059 position:50% align:center
Jotaro Aragaki, intend to reti--

00:21:32.834 --> 00:21:36.171 position:50% align:center
I intend to retire. Later.

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:44.637 position:50% align:center
That's right. Not yet.
