00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.043 position:50% align:center
A million words aren't enough to
describe a thing of such beauty.

00:00:43.126 --> 00:00:47.464 position:50% align:center
Each time he performs,
I think that same thing.

00:00:52.427 --> 00:00:53.762 position:50% align:center
He's a star.

00:00:53.845 --> 00:00:56.806 position:50% align:center
It's easy to understand
why the boss is so insistent.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.558 position:50% align:center
He's the pride of Royal.

00:01:11.363 --> 00:01:13.031 position:50% align:center
It's time, Leonardo.

00:01:13.114 --> 00:01:14.657 position:50% align:center
You're coming back with us.

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:15.950 position:50% align:center
Understand?

00:01:16.034 --> 00:01:18.703 position:50% align:center
But... I'm a simple
ninja, indeed.

00:01:18.787 --> 00:01:20.372 position:50% align:center
Now, don't make this difficult.

00:01:20.455 --> 00:01:23.416 position:50% align:center
That'd just cause trouble for
the people you're staying with.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.419 position:50% align:center
The Aragaki family, wasn't it?

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:51.069 position:50% align:center
[TOM]
We've brought him.

00:01:53.196 --> 00:01:55.323 position:50% align:center
Want to hear
something interesting?

00:01:55.407 --> 00:01:56.825 position:50% align:center
When I was younger
and ran away from home,

00:01:56.908 --> 00:02:00.870 position:50% align:center
my mother would hang me
from a tree as punishment.

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:02.580 position:50% align:center
Upside down.

00:02:02.664 --> 00:02:07.627 position:50% align:center
As you can imagine,
it was quite painful.

00:02:07.711 --> 00:02:10.296 position:50% align:center
I hope your little
trip was worth it.

00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:17.178 position:50% align:center
Now, change your clothes
this minute and get up there.

00:02:17.262 --> 00:02:18.638 position:50% align:center
Not yet.

00:02:18.722 --> 00:02:20.306 position:50% align:center
I can't do it.

00:02:23.852 --> 00:02:25.562 position:50% align:center
[LEONARDO]
I can't perform.

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:27.939 position:50% align:center
Not the way I am now.

00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:34.320 position:50% align:center
Ninja... Dogeza!

00:02:34.404 --> 00:02:35.321 position:50% align:center
I beg you.

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:37.407 position:50% align:center
Please, let me go back to Japan!

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.492 position:50% align:center
I must, in order to dance again!

00:02:39.576 --> 00:02:42.162 position:50% align:center
Otherwise,
I'll be completely useless!

00:02:42.245 --> 00:02:43.913 position:50% align:center
It's what I need!

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:46.041 position:50% align:center
Please let me go!

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:58.887 position:50% align:center
Very well, just this once.

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.514 position:50% align:center
But you may only
stay until winter.

00:03:01.598 --> 00:03:03.391 position:50% align:center
If you break your promise again,

00:03:03.475 --> 00:03:07.395 position:50% align:center
you'll wish I'd hung you
upside down from a tree.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.405 position:50% align:center
[REI]
Hey, check it out.

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.157 position:50% align:center
It turned out
pretty good, right?

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.327 position:50% align:center
Come on, are you ready to play?

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.996 position:50% align:center
Yes! That sounds fun, indeed!

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.457 position:50% align:center
I wanna start from
the first scene, okay?

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.292 position:50% align:center
Let's go to my room!

00:05:03.261 --> 00:05:05.096 position:50% align:center
[NAKANOMORI]
Well, this is it.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.058 position:50% align:center
The site of our joint
training camp with China.

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:10.060 position:50% align:center
Wow, it hasn't changed at all.

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:11.519 position:50% align:center
Oh!

00:05:13.438 --> 00:05:16.316 position:50% align:center
Now, this takes me back.

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:18.943 position:50% align:center
[LI]
You must be from the Japan team!

00:05:19.027 --> 00:05:20.653 position:50% align:center
We've been waiting for you guys!

00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:23.365 position:50% align:center
I'm Li from the General
Administration of Sport.

00:05:23.448 --> 00:05:25.200 position:50% align:center
Thank you for coming to meet us.

00:05:25.283 --> 00:05:28.953 position:50% align:center
Nakanomori, Japan
Gymnastics Association.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.333 position:50% align:center
I've been looking forward to
seeing our teams work together.

00:05:33.416 --> 00:05:36.086 position:50% align:center
Since we got here
a little earlier than you,

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:39.339 position:50% align:center
our gymnasts are already
over in the practice area.

00:05:44.928 --> 00:05:47.263 position:50% align:center
Ohh! I remember this, too!

00:05:48.973 --> 00:05:50.975 position:50% align:center
Hey, guys, check it out.

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:53.353 position:50% align:center
It looks like...

00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:02.612 position:50% align:center
[DOJIMA] That combination
into a Maltese cross.

00:06:02.696 --> 00:06:05.949 position:50% align:center
It's what I did in
my routine at the NHK Cup.

00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:08.326 position:50% align:center
[DOJIMA] And he has all
those weights on, too.

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.203 position:50% align:center
They're the best for a reason.

00:06:10.286 --> 00:06:13.206 position:50% align:center
And there's the best
of the best right there.

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:18.336 position:50% align:center
The winner of last year's world
championships, Liu Longxiang.

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:22.716 position:50% align:center
Man, after all this time.

00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:24.926 position:50% align:center
Can't believe it's still here!

00:06:25.552 --> 00:06:27.137 position:50% align:center
The gymnast.

00:06:31.141 --> 00:06:32.517 position:50% align:center
Welcome, everybody.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.560 position:50% align:center
I hope you came ready to work

00:06:33.643 --> 00:06:36.187 position:50% align:center
and show each other
your very best.

00:06:36.271 --> 00:06:37.522 position:50% align:center
That's why we're here:
so gymnasts

00:06:37.605 --> 00:06:40.734 position:50% align:center
from both countries
can share their expertise.

00:06:40.817 --> 00:06:42.444 position:50% align:center
You'll find this is more
than just a chance

00:06:42.527 --> 00:06:46.406 position:50% align:center
for each team to grow,
but a cultural exchange, too.

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:48.241 position:50% align:center
So, get ready--

00:06:48.324 --> 00:06:50.285 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:50.368 --> 00:06:52.954 position:50% align:center
[TETSUO]
The reason I'm here...

00:06:53.038 --> 00:06:56.833 position:50% align:center
...is to prove
that I can beat you.

00:06:57.834 --> 00:07:00.253 position:50% align:center
So let's have a match.

00:07:00.337 --> 00:07:03.131 position:50% align:center
Such grit. Such fire.

00:07:03.214 --> 00:07:05.717 position:50% align:center
This must be what they
call the "Japanese spirit."

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.802 position:50% align:center
I admire your
passion, young man.

00:07:07.886 --> 00:07:09.054 position:50% align:center
We accept.

00:07:09.137 --> 00:07:12.682 position:50% align:center
To turn you down would
be to lose face. Liu!

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.360 position:50% align:center
That guy.

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:27.489 position:50% align:center
Self-centered
and selfish. But...

00:07:35.205 --> 00:07:37.248 position:50% align:center
[LI]
He goes right into a Kolman!

00:07:43.421 --> 00:07:45.590 position:50% align:center
Consecutive Tkatchevs?

00:07:45.674 --> 00:07:47.217 position:50% align:center
He didn't do that last time.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.843 position:50% align:center
He upped the difficulty!

00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:51.262 position:50% align:center
Yeah, this guy's a total jerk.

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:03.483 position:50% align:center
To keep the match fair,

00:08:03.566 --> 00:08:06.778 position:50% align:center
we coaches will be deciding
on the scores together.

00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:08.863 position:50% align:center
9.675.

00:08:08.947 --> 00:08:12.075 position:50% align:center
With such a high score,
he stands a chance.

00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:14.869 position:50% align:center
It's your turn now, Liu!

00:08:31.553 --> 00:08:33.304 position:50% align:center
A full twisting Tkatchev.

00:08:33.388 --> 00:08:35.098 position:50% align:center
A Liukin?

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:41.396 position:50% align:center
And now a Def?

00:08:48.069 --> 00:08:51.531 position:50% align:center
Pogorelov? He's really
not messing around.

00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:53.616 position:50% align:center
That's the hardest of
the Tkatchev, Gienger,

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.077 position:50% align:center
and JÃ¤ger moves, in succession!

00:09:02.125 --> 00:09:05.295 position:50% align:center
Go figure he'd finish it off
with a Super E level skill.

00:09:05.378 --> 00:09:06.880 position:50% align:center
The Faldan!

00:09:07.756 --> 00:09:13.303 position:50% align:center
His score. It's 9.825!

00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:17.223 position:50% align:center
[DOJIMA] No wonder he dominated
last year's championships.

00:09:21.353 --> 00:09:25.940 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO] Um. Do you think
I could try something, too?

00:09:26.608 --> 00:09:27.984 position:50% align:center
Of course you can!

00:09:28.068 --> 00:09:30.862 position:50% align:center
We welcome anyone
with true passion!

00:09:33.615 --> 00:09:35.241 position:50% align:center
What the heck is he doing?

00:09:35.325 --> 00:09:38.995 position:50% align:center
Does he honestly think
he can beat that score?

00:09:48.171 --> 00:09:49.673 position:50% align:center
Go for it.

00:09:50.632 --> 00:09:52.425 position:50% align:center
You've put in the time.

00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:53.885 position:50% align:center
Done the training.

00:09:53.968 --> 00:09:55.887 position:50% align:center
There shouldn't be a problem.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:58.056 position:50% align:center
So, go for it.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.271 position:50% align:center
The Aragaki. A triple!

00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:11.069 position:50% align:center
Wow, he totally nailed it.

00:10:11.152 --> 00:10:11.695 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:10:11.778 --> 00:10:14.739 position:50% align:center
--Huh?
--Huh?

00:10:14.823 --> 00:10:18.243 position:50% align:center
Yes! All right!
Yes! I did it!

00:10:18.326 --> 00:10:20.620 position:50% align:center
I really did it! Woo-hoo!

00:10:20.704 --> 00:10:22.914 position:50% align:center
[OKAMACHI]
He just jumped off?

00:10:22.997 --> 00:10:25.208 position:50% align:center
[NISHIKIORI]
After only doing a single move?

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:26.626 position:50% align:center
[DOJIMA]
His own move.

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:28.211 position:50% align:center
And now he's
freaking out about it.

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:31.256 position:50% align:center
He's only predictable in
just how unpredictable he is.

00:10:31.339 --> 00:10:32.882 position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:34.467 position:50% align:center
Uh. Uh...?

00:10:34.551 --> 00:10:36.219 position:50% align:center
[laughter breaks out]

00:10:44.436 --> 00:10:45.478 position:50% align:center
[LI]
I'm pleased.

00:10:45.562 --> 00:10:48.231 position:50% align:center
We're already off
to a great start!

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:51.860 position:50% align:center
That match was a perfect
way to begin this camp.

00:10:51.943 --> 00:10:53.903 position:50% align:center
Gentlemen,
for the next few days,

00:10:53.987 --> 00:10:57.866 position:50% align:center
I hope you'll give it your all
to make your time here worth it.

00:11:18.845 --> 00:11:20.889 position:50% align:center
So many people!

00:11:20.972 --> 00:11:23.641 position:50% align:center
That's 'cause today's
the camp's open practice day,

00:11:23.725 --> 00:11:26.102 position:50% align:center
so a lot of the press is here.

00:11:26.186 --> 00:11:28.271 position:50% align:center
Good thing, too, since
that's how I got permission

00:11:28.355 --> 00:11:29.814 position:50% align:center
for you guys to come watch.

00:11:29.898 --> 00:11:32.692 position:50% align:center
Where's Joe practicing?
I don't see him.

00:11:33.985 --> 00:11:35.278 position:50% align:center
[REI]
Dad!

00:11:35.362 --> 00:11:36.696 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.823 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
Rei!

00:11:39.574 --> 00:11:41.326 position:50% align:center
Well, surprise.

00:11:41.409 --> 00:11:43.244 position:50% align:center
Hey. I'm sorry.

00:11:43.328 --> 00:11:44.954 position:50% align:center
You didn't have to do this.

00:11:45.038 --> 00:11:47.749 position:50% align:center
[AMAKUSA] Why not? I thought
they'd like to check it out.

00:11:47.832 --> 00:11:50.585 position:50% align:center
I mean, yesterday
was Rei's birthday.

00:11:50.669 --> 00:11:53.213 position:50% align:center
Think of this visit
as my present to her.

00:11:54.297 --> 00:11:56.591 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO] Well,
happy birthday, sweetheart.

00:11:56.675 --> 00:11:58.968 position:50% align:center
You already told me
on the phone yesterday.

00:12:02.555 --> 00:12:04.182 position:50% align:center
The daughter?

00:12:06.976 --> 00:12:08.561 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:12.649 --> 00:12:14.484 position:50% align:center
[LEONARDO]
Tetsu!

00:12:16.486 --> 00:12:18.321 position:50% align:center
I'm Leo. You know,
the ninja, Leo.

00:12:18.405 --> 00:12:20.115 position:50% align:center
You remember me, don't you?

00:12:20.198 --> 00:12:22.283 position:50% align:center
I was with Joe when you
had your big duel.

00:12:22.367 --> 00:12:25.078 position:50% align:center
Hey, why are you
out running all alone?

00:12:25.161 --> 00:12:27.122 position:50% align:center
You don't want to practice
with the others?

00:12:27.205 --> 00:12:29.499 position:50% align:center
And why haven't you said
a single word to me?

00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:31.418 position:50% align:center
Is it training?

00:12:31.501 --> 00:12:34.004 position:50% align:center
What's that got to do
with gymnastics, though?

00:12:34.963 --> 00:12:38.258 position:50% align:center
Whoa! You're so fast,
Tetsu, wow!

00:12:38.341 --> 00:12:40.051 position:50% align:center
But I can keep up
with you, indeed.

00:12:40.135 --> 00:12:42.095 position:50% align:center
Because I'm a ninja.

00:12:42.178 --> 00:12:43.596 position:50% align:center
Damn it.

00:12:53.481 --> 00:12:55.442 position:50% align:center
[LEONARDO]
That was a lot of fun, Tetsu!

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.240 position:50% align:center
Where are we?

00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:06.161 position:50% align:center
[DOJIMA]
Something going on out there?

00:13:06.244 --> 00:13:09.831 position:50% align:center
No, it's just Minamino seems
to be out pretty late.

00:13:09.914 --> 00:13:13.376 position:50% align:center
Right. He's been off
on his own this whole time.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:15.628 position:50% align:center
I almost feel sorry for him.

00:13:15.712 --> 00:13:18.965 position:50% align:center
Getting beaten that first
day must've been rough.

00:13:20.592 --> 00:13:22.969 position:50% align:center
The more competitive
that somebody is,

00:13:23.053 --> 00:13:27.390 position:50% align:center
the more likely one
failure will break them.

00:13:27.474 --> 00:13:29.976 position:50% align:center
It's not that
uncommon in sports.

00:13:34.147 --> 00:13:35.815 position:50% align:center
That way?

00:13:43.698 --> 00:13:46.409 position:50% align:center
Could it be that
you can't read a map?

00:13:47.494 --> 00:13:49.120 position:50% align:center
It's okay, indeed!

00:13:49.204 --> 00:13:52.332 position:50% align:center
Bad at maps,
but very good at gymnastics.

00:13:52.415 --> 00:13:54.334 position:50% align:center
Ugh...

00:13:56.378 --> 00:13:57.962 position:50% align:center
[TETSUO sighs]

00:13:58.046 --> 00:13:59.798 position:50% align:center
Damn it.

00:14:04.928 --> 00:14:07.263 position:50% align:center
Hey. Tetsu.

00:14:07.347 --> 00:14:09.015 position:50% align:center
Why do you do gymnastics?

00:14:12.602 --> 00:14:14.396 position:50% align:center
When Joe practices or competes,

00:14:14.479 --> 00:14:16.523 position:50% align:center
he always has fun.
Shouldn't yo--

00:14:16.606 --> 00:14:20.151 position:50% align:center
Don't lump me in
with that loser.

00:14:20.235 --> 00:14:24.322 position:50% align:center
He's done. Has been
for a long time now.

00:14:24.406 --> 00:14:26.241 position:50% align:center
For him to keep trying so hard.

00:14:26.324 --> 00:14:28.910 position:50% align:center
It's embarrassing.

00:14:28.993 --> 00:14:31.955 position:50% align:center
If he can't win, then he
doesn't belong in this sport.

00:14:45.969 --> 00:14:49.055 position:50% align:center
But don't you think
it's kind of scary?

00:14:49.139 --> 00:14:51.558 position:50% align:center
Going through life
thinking that way.

00:14:53.685 --> 00:14:56.438 position:50% align:center
I mean, what if
someday you realize

00:14:56.521 --> 00:14:58.481 position:50% align:center
that you aren't
good enough on your own?

00:14:58.565 --> 00:14:59.357 position:50% align:center
What'll you do?

00:14:59.441 --> 00:15:00.859 position:50% align:center
[TETSUO]
Shut up.

00:15:03.445 --> 00:15:05.238 position:50% align:center
I will win.

00:15:08.533 --> 00:15:12.203 position:50% align:center
[TETSUO]
Even if I'm not on top now,

00:15:12.287 --> 00:15:15.498 position:50% align:center
in the end, I will be.

00:15:15.582 --> 00:15:18.126 position:50% align:center
That's the kind of gymnast I am.

00:15:20.754 --> 00:15:22.547 position:50% align:center
[NAKANOMORI]
Finally, there you are.

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:25.383 position:50% align:center
I had a feeling you might
have gotten lost out here.

00:15:25.467 --> 00:15:27.302 position:50% align:center
Now. Let's get back.

00:15:27.385 --> 00:15:29.763 position:50% align:center
You don't want to lose
next time, do you?

00:15:39.105 --> 00:15:41.900 position:50% align:center
[LI] That's it for our
last day of joint training.

00:15:41.983 --> 00:15:43.651 position:50% align:center
We may not have had long,

00:15:43.735 --> 00:15:46.237 position:50% align:center
but we did a lot with
the time we were given.

00:15:46.321 --> 00:15:48.990 position:50% align:center
It's true that China and Japan
are long-standing rivals,

00:15:49.074 --> 00:15:51.326 position:50% align:center
but more than that,
we're friends.

00:15:51.409 --> 00:15:55.163 position:50% align:center
So let's go out there and
show the world what we can do!

00:15:55.246 --> 00:15:56.539 position:50% align:center
It isn't much,

00:15:56.623 --> 00:15:58.667 position:50% align:center
but we've prepared a dinner
party to close the camp

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:00.627 position:50% align:center
and celebrate
the work we've done.

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:04.381 position:50% align:center
We hope you'll enjoy
your last night together.

00:16:07.592 --> 00:16:08.802 position:50% align:center
[REI]
I'm gonna get a drink.

00:16:08.885 --> 00:16:09.678 position:50% align:center
You want anything?

00:16:09.761 --> 00:16:11.471 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes. Milk, please.

00:16:11.554 --> 00:16:12.764 position:50% align:center
[REI]
Got it.

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:28.071 position:50% align:center
Uh, hi, can I help you?

00:16:28.154 --> 00:16:28.947 position:50% align:center
Your mom.

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:31.408 position:50% align:center
She was Tomoyo Mifune, right?

00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:33.076 position:50% align:center
[REI gasps]

00:16:33.159 --> 00:16:35.120 position:50% align:center
Huh?! Those photos!

00:16:35.203 --> 00:16:37.956 position:50% align:center
Great, huh?
I'm a huge fan of hers!

00:16:38.039 --> 00:16:40.542 position:50% align:center
I knew you were her
daughter the second I saw you!

00:16:40.625 --> 00:16:42.502 position:50% align:center
I mean, you look just like her!

00:16:42.585 --> 00:16:45.463 position:50% align:center
Wow, you really think so?

00:16:45.547 --> 00:16:49.467 position:50% align:center
Sorry. I'm Kitty Zhang.
Maybe we could chat for a bit?

00:16:49.551 --> 00:16:52.429 position:50% align:center
Hello, Kitty.
Sure! Sounds great.

00:16:55.557 --> 00:16:58.351 position:50% align:center
Truth is, I thought this
camp might be a waste of time,

00:16:58.435 --> 00:17:00.311 position:50% align:center
but I was wrong.

00:17:00.395 --> 00:17:03.356 position:50% align:center
Japan's really upped
its game in recent years.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.275 position:50% align:center
This has been
a great experience.

00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:08.403 position:50% align:center
[OKAMACHI] Agreed.
I feel like I've learned a lot.

00:17:08.486 --> 00:17:11.948 position:50% align:center
Though, what was up
with that one guy?

00:17:12.032 --> 00:17:16.953 position:50% align:center
What he did during the match the
first day was pretty strange.

00:17:17.037 --> 00:17:18.496 position:50% align:center
Heh. Yeah.

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:21.791 position:50% align:center
Honestly, he's always been
a little bit "out there."

00:17:24.336 --> 00:17:26.004 position:50% align:center
[loud banging]

00:17:26.087 --> 00:17:27.589 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
What's that?

00:17:34.763 --> 00:17:36.973 position:50% align:center
A triple back.

00:17:37.932 --> 00:17:41.936 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, did you think
you had a monopoly on triples?

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:43.646 position:50% align:center
Jotaro Aragaki.

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:45.231 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
Hmm?

00:17:45.315 --> 00:17:48.651 position:50% align:center
I was there seven years ago.

00:17:48.735 --> 00:17:51.404 position:50% align:center
I watched the "Japanese Samurai"
take home Olympic silver

00:17:51.488 --> 00:17:53.615 position:50% align:center
with my own eyes.

00:17:54.908 --> 00:17:56.117 position:50% align:center
[LIU]
Are you surprised?

00:17:56.201 --> 00:17:57.285 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's just...

00:17:57.369 --> 00:18:00.330 position:50% align:center
I've never heard
you talk before.

00:18:00.413 --> 00:18:03.291 position:50% align:center
I don't see the point
in making idle chatter.

00:18:03.375 --> 00:18:07.253 position:50% align:center
That said, there's something
I'd like to ask you.

00:18:08.713 --> 00:18:10.715 position:50% align:center
Why are you here?

00:18:10.799 --> 00:18:12.008 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:13.385 --> 00:18:16.513 position:50% align:center
[LIU] Do you know why we
agreed to this training camp?

00:18:16.596 --> 00:18:18.056 position:50% align:center
It was so we could
see what the up-and-coming

00:18:18.139 --> 00:18:21.184 position:50% align:center
young Japanese gymnasts
could do.

00:18:21.267 --> 00:18:22.602 position:50% align:center
In reality,

00:18:22.686 --> 00:18:25.397 position:50% align:center
while Tetsuo Minamino is still
rough around the edges,

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.691 position:50% align:center
he is very talented.

00:18:27.774 --> 00:18:31.277 position:50% align:center
I'm sure he'll be one of the top
gymnasts in the world someday,

00:18:31.361 --> 00:18:34.572 position:50% align:center
blowing the other athletes
here out of the water.

00:18:34.656 --> 00:18:37.909 position:50% align:center
I know, because
that was my trajectory.

00:18:39.869 --> 00:18:41.788 position:50% align:center
[LIU]
I stepped over the competition

00:18:41.871 --> 00:18:45.208 position:50% align:center
and climbed my way to first.

00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:47.377 position:50% align:center
I know my own limits, though.

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:50.922 position:50% align:center
I'm at my peak now,
but in a few years,

00:18:51.006 --> 00:18:55.051 position:50% align:center
I'll be overtaken
by other gymnasts.

00:18:55.135 --> 00:18:57.512 position:50% align:center
Everyone will lose someday.

00:18:57.595 --> 00:19:00.223 position:50% align:center
There's only so
far you can push.

00:19:00.306 --> 00:19:02.934 position:50% align:center
So I ask again:
why are you here?

00:19:03.018 --> 00:19:05.562 position:50% align:center
You're already past
your peak as a gymnast.

00:19:05.645 --> 00:19:08.314 position:50% align:center
Do you really think you
can win at this point?

00:19:08.398 --> 00:19:12.027 position:50% align:center
Uh? Win? Um.
I don't really know.

00:19:14.946 --> 00:19:17.365 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
I hurt my shoulder pretty badly,

00:19:17.449 --> 00:19:20.201 position:50% align:center
and I wasn't at
my best for a long time.

00:19:20.285 --> 00:19:23.079 position:50% align:center
Everyone around me
was really worried.

00:19:23.163 --> 00:19:27.917 position:50% align:center
And so, I decided to retire.

00:19:29.377 --> 00:19:31.838 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
But, you know, even then.

00:19:31.921 --> 00:19:33.340 position:50% align:center
I found myself thinking.

00:19:33.423 --> 00:19:34.507 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
"Man."

00:19:36.509 --> 00:19:39.137 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
"I know I can still do this."

00:19:41.806 --> 00:19:44.434 position:50% align:center
My coach told me it
was impossible,

00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:46.561 position:50% align:center
and in my head, I understood.

00:19:46.644 --> 00:19:49.022 position:50% align:center
But it just didn't matter.

00:19:49.105 --> 00:19:51.274 position:50% align:center
Because I still had
a body that could move.

00:19:51.358 --> 00:19:54.027 position:50% align:center
I could still swing on the bar.

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:55.945 position:50% align:center
The Aragaki, too.

00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:59.532 position:50% align:center
I couldn't do it for
a long time, but then I did.

00:19:59.616 --> 00:20:01.034 position:50% align:center
And that feeling.

00:20:01.117 --> 00:20:03.787 position:50% align:center
I was so happy,
I just kept shouting.

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:05.914 position:50% align:center
"All right! I did it!" 

00:20:08.625 --> 00:20:10.126 position:50% align:center
I may be told
something's impossible,

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:12.712 position:50% align:center
but I don't have to believe it.

00:20:12.796 --> 00:20:17.133 position:50% align:center
I did the Aragaki again,
so what else can I do?

00:20:17.217 --> 00:20:19.302 position:50% align:center
I plan to find out.

00:20:19.386 --> 00:20:22.138 position:50% align:center
Everyone hits
their limit sometime.

00:20:22.222 --> 00:20:25.183 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
Yeah, that's probably true.

00:20:25.266 --> 00:20:28.687 position:50% align:center
But as long as my body
will move, I'll keep trying.

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:31.189 position:50% align:center
I won't give up.

00:20:31.272 --> 00:20:33.316 position:50% align:center
Ever.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:36.695 position:50% align:center
What, so you plan to
keep at it until you die?

00:20:36.778 --> 00:20:37.946 position:50% align:center
Die?

00:20:38.029 --> 00:20:43.660 position:50% align:center
Uh... Well.
I don't know. Maybe.

00:20:43.743 --> 00:20:45.829 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I do.

00:20:49.374 --> 00:20:56.756 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:59.884 position:50% align:center
I haven't laughed
like that in a long time.

00:20:59.968 --> 00:21:01.928 position:50% align:center
Well, I've got
more practice to do.

00:21:02.012 --> 00:21:03.221 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:03.304 --> 00:21:06.307 position:50% align:center
[LIU] By the way, let me
give you some advice.

00:21:08.143 --> 00:21:12.230 position:50% align:center
[LIU] You won't be able to
compete with just the Aragaki.

00:21:12.313 --> 00:21:16.026 position:50% align:center
The other day, you wouldn't
have beaten my score,

00:21:16.109 --> 00:21:20.155 position:50% align:center
obviously, but you wouldn't
have beaten Minamino's, either.

00:21:22.282 --> 00:21:26.077 position:50% align:center
Goodbye, Japanese Samurai.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:03.842 position:50% align:center
I can't win with
what I've got now.

00:23:03.925 --> 00:23:05.593 position:50% align:center
I have to do it.

00:23:06.386 --> 00:23:08.096 position:50% align:center
A quadruple.

00:23:09.139 --> 00:23:11.057 position:50% align:center
[AMAKUSA]
The Aragaki Mark II, huh?
