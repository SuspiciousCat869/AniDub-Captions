00:00:12.971 --> 00:00:14.305 position:50% align:center
Truly though.

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:15.890 position:50% align:center
This is yummylicious.

00:00:15.974 --> 00:00:17.475 position:50% align:center
You don't have
to go on about it.

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:18.727 position:50% align:center
By the way,

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.395 position:50% align:center
where are you picking up
all these weird words?

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:28.403 position:50% align:center
Hey! Cut that out!

00:00:29.946 --> 00:00:31.781 position:50% align:center
[REI]] You need to be
more careful, Leo.

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:33.867 position:50% align:center
He'll snap up anything you drop.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.535 position:50% align:center
Please forgive me!

00:00:35.618 --> 00:00:37.996 position:50% align:center
And you need to know
that you're a bird.

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:40.582 position:50% align:center
If you eat people-food,
it'll make you sick.

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:43.126 position:50% align:center
Havin' a good morning?

00:00:44.127 --> 00:00:46.713 position:50% align:center
Um. You've got a
little bedhead, Dad.

00:02:22.892 --> 00:02:24.686 position:50% align:center
[AMAKUSA] We'll tackle
your moves one at a time

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:26.604 position:50% align:center
with care and precision.

00:02:26.688 --> 00:02:29.566 position:50% align:center
I'd say that you're on
the right track already.

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:32.402 position:50% align:center
The NHK Cup is soon.

00:02:32.485 --> 00:02:33.737 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.280 position:50% align:center
As we were just shown.

00:02:35.363 --> 00:02:39.117 position:50% align:center
You've been getting outpaced
by some talented rookies.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.952 position:50% align:center
That Minamino kid?

00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:48.877 position:50% align:center
It isn't just him.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.505 position:50% align:center
A whole new crop of gymnasts
are pushing this sport forward.

00:02:53.757 --> 00:02:55.258 position:50% align:center
But don't forget.

00:02:55.342 --> 00:02:57.844 position:50% align:center
Our strategy stays
the same for now.

00:02:57.927 --> 00:03:00.138 position:50% align:center
Keep on polishing
the moves you have.

00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:04.267 position:50% align:center
Furthermore, at events, your
form has to be utterly perfect,

00:03:04.351 --> 00:03:06.144 position:50% align:center
or there's no point.

00:03:06.227 --> 00:03:09.230 position:50% align:center
You need to focus like
you never have before.

00:03:09.314 --> 00:03:11.066 position:50% align:center
Sir!

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:15.236 position:50% align:center
Tackey. Uh. What are Joe
and his coach talking about?

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.489 position:50% align:center
Prob'ly the NHK Cup.

00:03:17.572 --> 00:03:19.199 position:50% align:center
The NHK cup, huh?

00:03:19.282 --> 00:03:20.867 position:50% align:center
What does NHK stand for?

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.787 position:50% align:center
[TAKIZAWA]
Hm? Oh. Well. "N" is for Ninja.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.205 position:50% align:center
That's for sure.

00:03:25.288 --> 00:03:28.416 position:50% align:center
H is for "has" and K is for
"kangaroo" in his pouch!

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.584 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:03:29.668 --> 00:03:31.252 position:50% align:center
Forget the letters, man.

00:03:31.336 --> 00:03:33.296 position:50% align:center
It's a real big competition.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.297 position:50% align:center
[LEONARDO]
Oh yeah?

00:03:34.381 --> 00:03:36.508 position:50% align:center
[TAKIZAWA]
Mm.

00:03:36.591 --> 00:03:38.093 position:50% align:center
It's a whole thing, dude.

00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:41.012 position:50% align:center
It starts with these two
super huge competitions.

00:03:42.764 --> 00:03:43.765 position:50% align:center
And once they're finished,

00:03:43.848 --> 00:03:46.226 position:50% align:center
the field gets narrowed
down, ya know?

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:48.520 position:50% align:center
And after that's done, you're
left with the best of the best!

00:03:48.603 --> 00:03:50.897 position:50% align:center
I mean, you just took a group
of incredibly tough athletes

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.357 position:50% align:center
and narrowed it down even more!

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.359 position:50% align:center
So yeah, it's a major event!

00:03:54.442 --> 00:03:55.985 position:50% align:center
It must be, indeed.

00:03:56.903 --> 00:03:57.821 position:50% align:center
Crazy, right?

00:03:57.904 --> 00:03:59.698 position:50% align:center
You freaked out?

00:03:59.781 --> 00:04:01.282 position:50% align:center
Joe's marching to battle.

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:04.411 position:50% align:center
This'll be his
personal Sekigahara.

00:04:04.494 --> 00:04:06.955 position:50% align:center
The battle that decides the war!

00:04:07.038 --> 00:04:08.331 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:20.844 --> 00:04:22.303 position:50% align:center
Sekigahara?

00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:23.096 position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:24.681 position:50% align:center
This time it's not a duel.

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:29.269 position:50% align:center
So I'll get to watch you do your
gymnastics in a big place soon!

00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:30.353 position:50% align:center
Why are you so interested

00:04:30.437 --> 00:04:33.606 position:50% align:center
in watching me do
gymnastics anyway?

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.608 position:50% align:center
You've brought it up
a couple times now.

00:04:35.692 --> 00:04:37.360 position:50% align:center
And the other day.

00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:40.363 position:50% align:center
Ninja... Dogeza!

00:04:40.447 --> 00:04:42.991 position:50% align:center
Don't take gymnastics from Joe!

00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:48.621 position:50% align:center
Why would you go
that far for my sake?

00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:50.957 position:50% align:center
Didja follow my career?

00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:54.753 position:50% align:center
Uhhh...

00:04:54.836 --> 00:04:55.503 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
Hmm?

00:04:55.587 --> 00:04:56.963 position:50% align:center
Yeah. That's right!

00:04:57.047 --> 00:04:58.465 position:50% align:center
You're super famous, Joe!

00:04:58.548 --> 00:04:59.341 position:50% align:center
At Edo Wonderland?

00:04:59.424 --> 00:05:00.550 position:50% align:center
Yes. Indeed.

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:01.760 position:50% align:center
But listen my friend,

00:05:01.843 --> 00:05:04.596 position:50% align:center
I only need one reason
to fight beside you.

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:08.558 position:50% align:center
It's my duty as the
Aragaki clan's ninja!

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:11.353 position:50% align:center
Indeed. I am a ninja.

00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:13.480 position:50% align:center
I am a ninja indeed.

00:05:13.563 --> 00:05:19.527 position:50% align:center
[BULLIES]
Samurai! Samurai! Samurai!

00:05:19.611 --> 00:05:20.528 position:50% align:center
[BULLY A]
I will retire.

00:05:20.612 --> 00:05:22.739 position:50% align:center
[ALL 3]
Later!

00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:23.740 position:50% align:center
[KAZU]
Hey. Hey, slow down.

00:05:23.823 --> 00:05:25.075 position:50% align:center
What's your hurry?

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:26.076 position:50% align:center
[BULLY A]
She has homework.

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:27.452 position:50% align:center
Yeah, later!

00:05:27.535 --> 00:05:28.536 position:50% align:center
Let's go play baseball.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:29.537 position:50% align:center
Later!

00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:32.916 position:50% align:center
[laughter]

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:34.167 position:50% align:center
[LEONARDO]
Hiyah.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.378 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:05:48.932 --> 00:05:50.558 position:50% align:center
[REI]
What did you just do?

00:05:50.642 --> 00:05:52.769 position:50% align:center
Hiyah! Gave him a chop.

00:05:52.852 --> 00:05:54.646 position:50% align:center
Why did you hit my classmate?

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:57.732 position:50% align:center
Because you made
a face like you were upset.

00:05:57.816 --> 00:05:59.359 position:50% align:center
[REI]
Hmm?!

00:05:59.442 --> 00:06:01.361 position:50% align:center
I don't think I made a face.

00:06:01.444 --> 00:06:02.946 position:50% align:center
Are the kids from
your school alw--

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:05.448 position:50% align:center
[REI] No! And I don't want
you to tell Dad or Grandma

00:06:05.532 --> 00:06:07.033 position:50% align:center
about what you saw.

00:06:07.117 --> 00:06:08.243 position:50% align:center
And no more hitting.

00:06:08.326 --> 00:06:10.704 position:50% align:center
Leave the kids from
my school alone, okay?

00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:11.788 position:50% align:center
I'm serious.

00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:13.832 position:50% align:center
Either listen
or I'm done with you.

00:06:19.713 --> 00:06:21.256 position:50% align:center
What does that mean?

00:06:22.507 --> 00:06:24.718 position:50% align:center
[AMAKUSA] It's almost time
to call it a day, Jotaro.

00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:27.012 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
Got it.

00:06:27.095 --> 00:06:28.513 position:50% align:center
[AMAKUSA]
How's Rei doing?

00:06:28.596 --> 00:06:31.433 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO] Rei's good. She's been
a huge help back at home.

00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:32.976 position:50% align:center
Kid's a trooper.

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:35.395 position:50% align:center
Good. And she's
in elementary school?

00:06:35.478 --> 00:06:37.397 position:50% align:center
Yeah,
she just started 4th grade.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.775 position:50% align:center
Right. Right.
She seems mature for her age.

00:06:40.859 --> 00:06:42.861 position:50% align:center
Good thing she
took after Tomoyo.

00:06:42.944 --> 00:06:44.362 position:50% align:center
Seriously.

00:06:44.446 --> 00:06:47.574 position:50% align:center
She's half the reason I have
time to practice this much,

00:06:47.657 --> 00:06:49.617 position:50% align:center
so I have to do her proud.

00:06:49.701 --> 00:06:52.662 position:50% align:center
Good man. Let's go.

00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:09.763 position:50% align:center
What, this? My daughter
told me about it.

00:07:09.846 --> 00:07:12.432 position:50% align:center
These phone charms are all
the rage with her classmates.

00:07:12.515 --> 00:07:13.641 position:50% align:center
Seriously, Coach?

00:07:13.725 --> 00:07:15.643 position:50% align:center
You ever hear of a "selfie"?

00:07:15.727 --> 00:07:18.688 position:50% align:center
I take one every day and
then text it to my daughter.

00:07:20.482 --> 00:07:21.816 position:50% align:center
[chuckles nervously]

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.610 position:50% align:center
[AMAKUSA] For some reason,
she never replies though.

00:07:23.693 --> 00:07:25.195 position:50% align:center
Oh...

00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:31.117 position:50% align:center
Well, Ayu, I think
I should head home now.

00:07:31.201 --> 00:07:33.953 position:50% align:center
Thanks again for helping me
with my homework today.

00:07:34.037 --> 00:07:35.372 position:50% align:center
For sure. Yeah.

00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:37.415 position:50% align:center
You're like,
super smart, anyway.

00:07:37.499 --> 00:07:39.042 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:40.293 position:50% align:center
See you tomorrow!

00:07:40.377 --> 00:07:41.836 position:50% align:center
'Kay!

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.760 position:50% align:center
[AYU]
Uh... What's up?

00:07:52.263 --> 00:07:53.390 position:50% align:center
I tried to help Rachel

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:55.100 position:50% align:center
and now she says
she's done with me.

00:07:55.183 --> 00:07:57.143 position:50% align:center
Lady Ayu. What's that mean?

00:07:57.227 --> 00:07:58.269 position:50% align:center
[AYU]
Hmmm...

00:07:58.353 --> 00:07:59.938 position:50% align:center
You can't ever see her again?

00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:01.106 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:02.440 position:50% align:center
But why not?

00:08:02.524 --> 00:08:05.110 position:50% align:center
I dunno. What'd'ja do?

00:08:05.985 --> 00:08:07.904 position:50% align:center
That is indeed what happened.

00:08:07.987 --> 00:08:09.030 position:50% align:center
Sucks dude.

00:08:09.114 --> 00:08:10.782 position:50% align:center
S'kinda like the
Battle of Red Cliffs.

00:08:10.865 --> 00:08:11.658 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:11.741 --> 00:08:13.159 position:50% align:center
I mean like, before you knew it.

00:08:13.243 --> 00:08:15.161 position:50% align:center
You were standing
in a sea of fire, right?

00:08:15.245 --> 00:08:17.330 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah. Right.

00:08:17.414 --> 00:08:18.790 position:50% align:center
It's not on you.

00:08:18.873 --> 00:08:21.543 position:50% align:center
Ya can't always guess which
way the wind'll blow next.

00:08:21.626 --> 00:08:22.460 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:08:22.544 --> 00:08:25.255 position:50% align:center
It's a chaotic world. Be afraid.

00:08:30.385 --> 00:08:31.761 position:50% align:center
I'm heading out!

00:08:31.845 --> 00:08:33.430 position:50% align:center
Bu-bye, hope you
have a good day!

00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:35.849 position:50% align:center
Yeah, hope ya have a good day!

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:51.614 position:50% align:center
Good morning.

00:08:51.698 --> 00:08:53.408 position:50% align:center
Where'd your ninja friend go?

00:08:53.491 --> 00:08:57.412 position:50% align:center
He mentioned something about
Red Cliffs and then took off.

00:09:00.582 --> 00:09:02.375 position:50% align:center
Okay, hurry on in now!

00:09:02.459 --> 00:09:04.044 position:50% align:center
Bell should ring any second.

00:09:04.127 --> 00:09:07.881 position:50% align:center
Uh-oh. Here it goes.
Ding, dong, ding--

00:09:11.301 --> 00:09:14.304 position:50% align:center
Hold on. Ya have some
kind'a business here?

00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:16.723 position:50% align:center
Indeed,
I seek truth and justice.

00:09:16.806 --> 00:09:18.683 position:50% align:center
Truth and justice, eh?
You a cop then?

00:09:18.767 --> 00:09:20.226 position:50% align:center
Somethin' about
your story stinks.

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.854 position:50% align:center
If you're a good guy then
take off the headgear.

00:09:22.937 --> 00:09:25.148 position:50% align:center
You don't have
anything to hide, do ya?

00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:26.066 position:50% align:center
Insolent man!

00:09:26.149 --> 00:09:27.776 position:50% align:center
That'd be you!

00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:37.911 position:50% align:center
[KAZU]
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:09:37.994 --> 00:09:41.122 position:50% align:center
No big deal but when we played
yesterday, I got a hat trick.

00:09:41.206 --> 00:09:43.083 position:50% align:center
Whoa, you're just like Ronaldo!

00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:44.584 position:50% align:center
[BULLY A]
Na, he's more like Henry.

00:09:44.668 --> 00:09:47.253 position:50% align:center
The other day, I sprang
a perfect Bergkamp trap!

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.629 position:50% align:center
'Kay! Now pass
around the handouts.

00:10:29.713 --> 00:10:30.964 position:50% align:center
Round and round, kids.

00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:33.758 position:50% align:center
I'm going round and round, too.

00:10:36.011 --> 00:10:37.637 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:10:37.721 --> 00:10:39.514 position:50% align:center
Hey, Aragaki. What'cha think?

00:10:39.597 --> 00:10:41.766 position:50% align:center
Will the samurai come to
Parents' Day for once?

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:43.101 position:50% align:center
I bet he'll skip again.

00:10:43.184 --> 00:10:44.644 position:50% align:center
Know what that means?

00:10:44.728 --> 00:10:47.022 position:50% align:center
The Samurai will come
to Parents' Day.

00:10:47.105 --> 00:10:47.731 position:50% align:center
When, guys?

00:10:47.814 --> 00:10:48.815 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Later!

00:10:48.898 --> 00:10:50.150 position:50% align:center
[laughter]

00:10:50.233 --> 00:10:51.609 position:50% align:center
Hey, stop acting like jerks.

00:10:51.693 --> 00:10:54.362 position:50% align:center
Rei's dad can't come because
he's so busy with his job.

00:10:54.446 --> 00:10:56.656 position:50% align:center
He needs to train all the time,
'cause if he loses again,

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.034 position:50% align:center
he'll have to retire for real.

00:11:26.102 --> 00:11:28.646 position:50% align:center
Hey, Leo. You're here, right?

00:11:30.607 --> 00:11:33.568 position:50% align:center
You spotted me out.
Perceptive indeed.

00:11:34.778 --> 00:11:38.281 position:50% align:center
Come here.
I'll let you meet my mom.

00:11:39.074 --> 00:11:40.325 position:50% align:center
Your mother is...?

00:11:40.408 --> 00:11:43.244 position:50% align:center
Hey there, Mom.
This my ninja friend, Leo.

00:11:43.328 --> 00:11:45.789 position:50% align:center
He followed me and dad
home from Edo Wonderland,

00:11:45.872 --> 00:11:48.375 position:50% align:center
and now he lives with us.

00:11:50.794 --> 00:11:53.129 position:50% align:center
Indeed. It is an honor.

00:11:54.255 --> 00:11:57.384 position:50% align:center
Say, your mother was
a famous actress, wasn't she?

00:11:57.467 --> 00:11:59.010 position:50% align:center
[REI]
Yeah! But that's not all.

00:11:59.094 --> 00:12:01.513 position:50% align:center
She was amazing
in real life, too!

00:12:01.596 --> 00:12:03.890 position:50% align:center
She could do anything
she set her mind to.

00:12:03.973 --> 00:12:05.684 position:50% align:center
She cooked
the tastiest food ever.

00:12:05.767 --> 00:12:09.062 position:50% align:center
And she always made time
to cheer on Dad.

00:12:09.145 --> 00:12:11.940 position:50% align:center
She was always smiling.

00:12:12.023 --> 00:12:15.485 position:50% align:center
Indeed, she sounds
a lot like you, Rachel.

00:12:20.532 --> 00:12:22.409 position:50% align:center
What's on your mind?

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:24.994 position:50% align:center
[REI]
We're not the same.

00:12:25.078 --> 00:12:28.748 position:50% align:center
But I need to do my best,
just like she always did.

00:12:29.249 --> 00:12:30.667 position:50% align:center
Rachel.

00:12:34.045 --> 00:12:36.923 position:50% align:center
Since we met, my days
have been filled with joy,

00:12:37.007 --> 00:12:38.925 position:50% align:center
all thanks to your family.

00:12:39.009 --> 00:12:42.345 position:50% align:center
I feel very grateful.
To you especially.

00:12:42.429 --> 00:12:45.348 position:50% align:center
Your kindness has meant
the world to me, Rachel.

00:12:45.432 --> 00:12:49.394 position:50% align:center
And now, I think I have
a chance to return the favor.

00:12:50.311 --> 00:12:51.855 position:50% align:center
What's gotten into you?

00:12:51.938 --> 00:12:54.315 position:50% align:center
Let's go to grandma's
place already!

00:13:04.492 --> 00:13:05.577 position:50% align:center
[AYU]
Thanks and all.

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:07.912 position:50% align:center
But could you stay
on your side of the bar?

00:13:07.996 --> 00:13:09.831 position:50% align:center
Wait, shouldn't
you be at practice?

00:13:09.914 --> 00:13:11.458 position:50% align:center
Nope, I wrapped up early.

00:13:11.541 --> 00:13:13.126 position:50% align:center
For me. That's no big.

00:13:13.209 --> 00:13:16.004 position:50% align:center
Anyway, anyone would do
what I'm doin', ya know?

00:13:16.087 --> 00:13:17.922 position:50% align:center
Greetings, I'm back, indeed.

00:13:18.006 --> 00:13:19.591 position:50% align:center
[AYU]
Hey, Leo.

00:13:20.717 --> 00:13:22.427 position:50% align:center
Wait. Is Rachel gone?

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:23.887 position:50% align:center
You like, just missed her.

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:25.513 position:50% align:center
She finished her homework.

00:13:25.597 --> 00:13:26.890 position:50% align:center
[LEONARDO]
I see.

00:13:28.808 --> 00:13:30.935 position:50% align:center
Hey, Leo, take a look at this.

00:13:31.853 --> 00:13:33.229 position:50% align:center
Seeing this Parents' Day
announcement

00:13:33.313 --> 00:13:34.898 position:50% align:center
really takes me back.

00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:37.192 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec. Does it really?

00:13:37.275 --> 00:13:38.485 position:50% align:center
What the--?

00:13:38.568 --> 00:13:40.945 position:50% align:center
I don't remember
my last Parents' Day.

00:13:41.029 --> 00:13:42.572 position:50% align:center
I've never heard
of a Parents' Day.

00:13:42.655 --> 00:13:44.282 position:50% align:center
Can you explain it?

00:13:44.366 --> 00:13:45.617 position:50% align:center
[TAKIZAWA]
You know, man,

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:47.369 position:50% align:center
it's when your Mom
dresses up to go your school!

00:13:47.452 --> 00:13:49.245 position:50% align:center
And you say
if she's gonna wear that,

00:13:49.329 --> 00:13:51.039 position:50% align:center
you'd rather she not go at all.

00:13:51.122 --> 00:13:53.291 position:50% align:center
And then she hits
you upside your head.

00:13:55.919 --> 00:13:57.671 position:50% align:center
[AYU]
Oh. What's up, Mari?

00:13:57.754 --> 00:13:59.214 position:50% align:center
[TAKIZAWA]
Wassup!

00:14:02.258 --> 00:14:04.594 position:50% align:center
[MARI]
Hm.

00:14:04.678 --> 00:14:06.388 position:50% align:center
Where did you get this form?

00:14:06.471 --> 00:14:09.015 position:50% align:center
[TAKIZAWA] From the trash.
I was taking it out.

00:14:09.099 --> 00:14:12.727 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:14:12.811 --> 00:14:14.396 position:50% align:center
I guess Rachel
must've dropped it.

00:14:14.479 --> 00:14:16.690 position:50% align:center
Want me to take it back to her?

00:14:16.773 --> 00:14:17.399 position:50% align:center
Come here.

00:14:17.482 --> 00:14:19.651 position:50% align:center
We need to talk, Leo.

00:14:22.404 --> 00:14:23.488 position:50% align:center
Just remembered.

00:14:23.571 --> 00:14:24.989 position:50% align:center
We got a package,
but it's all tied up.

00:14:25.073 --> 00:14:26.825 position:50% align:center
Come and help me
with the knots, Takizawa.

00:14:26.908 --> 00:14:27.909 position:50% align:center
Huh? Say what?

00:14:27.992 --> 00:14:28.910 position:50% align:center
You want me to
tie the knot with you?

00:14:28.993 --> 00:14:30.412 position:50% align:center
I mean this is kinda sudden.

00:14:30.495 --> 00:14:31.913 position:50% align:center
Not that I'm against it.

00:14:34.207 --> 00:14:35.667 position:50% align:center
What's the matter?

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:37.877 position:50% align:center
It's about Parents' Day.

00:14:37.961 --> 00:14:40.714 position:50% align:center
I've gone before. Several times.

00:14:43.675 --> 00:14:45.093 position:50% align:center
[BOY CLASSMATE A]
Has her family ever come before?

00:14:45.176 --> 00:14:46.469 position:50% align:center
I don't remember seeing them.

00:14:46.553 --> 00:14:47.804 position:50% align:center
[BOY CLASSMATE B]
She looks so cool!

00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:49.097 position:50% align:center
[BOY CLASSMATE C]
What gives? Your grandma's here?

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:50.890 position:50% align:center
Where's the samurai?

00:14:50.974 --> 00:14:51.766 position:50% align:center
[BOY CLASSMATE D]
Your grandma doesn't look

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:53.018 position:50% align:center
like a samurai at all.

00:14:53.101 --> 00:14:54.102 position:50% align:center
So what's going on?

00:14:54.185 --> 00:14:56.771 position:50% align:center
Is the samurai coming or not?

00:14:57.313 --> 00:14:58.523 position:50% align:center
He's busy.

00:15:06.156 --> 00:15:07.782 position:50% align:center
Rei.

00:15:07.866 --> 00:15:09.159 position:50% align:center
Goodness.

00:15:09.242 --> 00:15:11.745 position:50% align:center
They just kept going on about
the missing "samurai."

00:15:11.828 --> 00:15:13.872 position:50% align:center
Weird, they aren't
normally like that.

00:15:13.955 --> 00:15:16.291 position:50% align:center
Oh. Thank you for
leaving work for me.

00:15:16.374 --> 00:15:17.792 position:50% align:center
Sorry for the trouble.

00:15:19.252 --> 00:15:22.756 position:50% align:center
She's a thoughtful child
who has a strong imagination.

00:15:22.839 --> 00:15:25.884 position:50% align:center
When things go wrong, she has
a tendency to blame herself.

00:15:25.967 --> 00:15:28.053 position:50% align:center
Understand?

00:15:28.136 --> 00:15:30.430 position:50% align:center
With her father the way he is,

00:15:30.513 --> 00:15:33.516 position:50% align:center
and a grandma who
can't help but stand out.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.602 position:50% align:center
She threw the notice away.

00:15:35.685 --> 00:15:37.020 position:50% align:center
So I'll take the hint.

00:15:37.103 --> 00:15:40.148 position:50% align:center
Going would just
cause trouble for her.

00:15:40.231 --> 00:15:42.650 position:50% align:center
This is a hint. A valuable clue.

00:15:42.734 --> 00:15:45.362 position:50% align:center
One that I intend to act on.

00:15:47.322 --> 00:15:50.408 position:50% align:center
Milady. Might I ask
you for a favor?

00:15:53.953 --> 00:15:58.500 position:50% align:center
[REI] Later, Dad. Make sure
you lock up! I'll see ya!

00:15:58.583 --> 00:16:03.713 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
Have a good day.

00:16:03.797 --> 00:16:04.714 position:50% align:center
I'm serious.

00:16:04.798 --> 00:16:06.883 position:50% align:center
Either listen or
I'm done with you.

00:16:12.889 --> 00:16:14.974 position:50% align:center
All right. You ready
to hit the gym?

00:16:15.058 --> 00:16:17.769 position:50% align:center
Forgive me,
but I can't join you today.

00:16:17.852 --> 00:16:20.980 position:50% align:center
Oh. Somethin' come up?

00:16:21.064 --> 00:16:22.482 position:50% align:center
Do your best at practice!

00:16:22.565 --> 00:16:25.276 position:50% align:center
You'll need to be in perfect
form to win your Sekigahara.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.987 position:50% align:center
Uh. Yeah. Right.

00:16:33.702 --> 00:16:34.953 position:50% align:center
[BULLY C]
'Kay, who's next?

00:16:35.036 --> 00:16:36.121 position:50% align:center
[BOY CLASSMATE F]
Look, that's my Mom over there!

00:16:36.204 --> 00:16:37.997 position:50% align:center
[BULLY D]
Your family looks real fired up.

00:16:38.081 --> 00:16:40.208 position:50% align:center
[BOY CLASSMATE F] Hey, look!
Kazu's mom is here too now!

00:16:40.291 --> 00:16:42.043 position:50% align:center
That's almost everyone.

00:16:42.127 --> 00:16:45.380 position:50% align:center
Hey. Someone kinda
cool looking showed up.

00:16:45.463 --> 00:16:46.715 position:50% align:center
Is that a foreigner?

00:16:46.798 --> 00:16:49.134 position:50% align:center
It could be
someone's older brother.

00:16:52.637 --> 00:16:53.888 position:50% align:center
[BOY CLASSMATE G]
No way!

00:16:53.972 --> 00:16:54.764 position:50% align:center
[BOY CLASSMATE H]
He looks like a secret agent!

00:16:54.848 --> 00:16:56.099 position:50% align:center
[BOY CLASSMATE I]
So cool!

00:16:56.182 --> 00:16:56.641 position:50% align:center
[BOY CLASSMATE J]
Is that someone's big brother?

00:16:56.725 --> 00:16:58.226 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:58.309 --> 00:17:00.687 position:50% align:center
[BOY CLASSMATE K] Do we have a
secret foreign exchange student?

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:03.857 position:50% align:center
[BOY CLASSMATE L] I'm confused.
Who's family is he?

00:17:05.275 --> 00:17:07.068 position:50% align:center
Hi, Rachel!

00:17:07.152 --> 00:17:08.319 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:17:08.403 --> 00:17:09.821 position:50% align:center
That's your brother?

00:17:09.904 --> 00:17:11.197 position:50% align:center
[BOY CLASSMATE M]
He called her Rachel!

00:17:11.281 --> 00:17:12.198 position:50% align:center
[BOY CLASSMATE G]
What?

00:17:12.282 --> 00:17:13.158 position:50% align:center
[BOY CLASSMATE H]
No way!

00:17:13.241 --> 00:17:14.492 position:50% align:center
[BOY CLASSMATE I]
He's with you?

00:17:18.872 --> 00:17:21.624 position:50% align:center
All right, kids.
Who can solve this one?

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:26.296 position:50% align:center
Rachel! Go! You got this!

00:17:26.379 --> 00:17:28.715 position:50% align:center
That guy's been cheering
you on like crazy, look.

00:17:28.798 --> 00:17:30.508 position:50% align:center
He's still at it.

00:17:31.092 --> 00:17:33.595 position:50% align:center
Rachel! Rachel!

00:17:33.678 --> 00:17:35.722 position:50% align:center
Who's this "Rachel"?

00:17:35.805 --> 00:17:37.390 position:50% align:center
Oh, do you mean Aragaki?

00:17:37.474 --> 00:17:39.517 position:50% align:center
Okay, sure, Aragaki.

00:17:39.601 --> 00:17:42.520 position:50% align:center
Three hundred and seventeen
with a remainder of one.

00:17:42.604 --> 00:17:43.605 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER]
Correct!

00:17:43.688 --> 00:17:46.983 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Good show!
Great work, Rachel!

00:17:47.067 --> 00:17:51.488 position:50% align:center
Clap everyone!

[applause]

00:17:54.574 --> 00:17:56.993 position:50% align:center
Okay, okay.
Calm it down, everyone.

00:17:57.077 --> 00:17:59.371 position:50% align:center
We've got a lot more
math to get through.

00:18:02.332 --> 00:18:04.626 position:50% align:center
Hey, hey! Look here!

00:18:04.709 --> 00:18:06.211 position:50% align:center
Rachel knows this one too!

00:18:06.294 --> 00:18:08.463 position:50% align:center
Ask her again!
Don't be shy, Rachel!

00:18:08.546 --> 00:18:09.798 position:50% align:center
Raise your hand!

00:18:09.881 --> 00:18:11.800 position:50% align:center
[CLASSMATES]
C'mon, Rachel. Do it!

00:18:11.883 --> 00:18:21.309 position:50% align:center
Rachel! Rachel! Rachel!

00:18:24.187 --> 00:18:25.814 position:50% align:center
[KAZU]
She's over here, Leo!

00:18:25.897 --> 00:18:27.273 position:50% align:center
Can you believe it, Rachel?

00:18:27.357 --> 00:18:29.609 position:50% align:center
Your classmates and I have
become fast friends, indeed!

00:18:29.693 --> 00:18:32.445 position:50% align:center
Hey. Why do you call her
"Rachel" instead of Rei?

00:18:32.529 --> 00:18:34.531 position:50% align:center
Are you and
Aragaki really related?

00:18:34.614 --> 00:18:35.907 position:50% align:center
She your sister?

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:38.034 position:50% align:center
[LEONARDO] Actually,
I'm a ninja who's sworn an oath

00:18:38.118 --> 00:18:39.119 position:50% align:center
to defend Rachel.

00:18:39.202 --> 00:18:40.286 position:50% align:center
[BOY CLASSMATE N]
For real? No way.

00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:42.205 position:50% align:center
I've never met a ninja before!

00:18:42.288 --> 00:18:44.833 position:50% align:center
[BULLY A]
That kicks butt, Rachel!

00:18:44.916 --> 00:18:45.834 position:50% align:center
Ya hear that, Rachel?

00:18:45.917 --> 00:18:47.502 position:50% align:center
All these boys are nice, indeed!

00:18:47.585 --> 00:18:49.671 position:50% align:center
You should be
friends with them--

00:18:54.634 --> 00:18:56.344 position:50% align:center
You are such an idiot!

00:18:57.554 --> 00:18:58.805 position:50% align:center
What's wrong with you?

00:18:58.888 --> 00:19:01.433 position:50% align:center
Stop giving them new ways
to make fun of me!

00:19:01.516 --> 00:19:03.476 position:50% align:center
When it was just you going
"Rachel, Rachel, Rachel,"

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:05.603 position:50% align:center
it felt like a Hollywood
actress' name.

00:19:05.687 --> 00:19:06.938 position:50% align:center
But just 'cause
I let you say it,

00:19:07.022 --> 00:19:09.399 position:50% align:center
doesn't mean I want
everybody chanting it at me!

00:19:09.482 --> 00:19:11.234 position:50% align:center
What are you doing
at my school anyway?

00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:13.903 position:50% align:center
I didn't tell anyone
about Parents' Day, did I?

00:19:13.987 --> 00:19:16.114 position:50% align:center
If I wanted you here,
I would've asked you to come!

00:19:16.197 --> 00:19:17.699 position:50% align:center
And also, what's up
with that suit?

00:19:17.782 --> 00:19:19.784 position:50% align:center
You're not even a ninja now!

00:19:19.868 --> 00:19:22.037 position:50% align:center
As for you jerks,

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:23.413 position:50% align:center
is it really that much
fun to gang up

00:19:23.496 --> 00:19:24.873 position:50% align:center
on one girl all the time?

00:19:24.956 --> 00:19:26.082 position:50% align:center
And what's so great

00:19:26.166 --> 00:19:27.584 position:50% align:center
about shouting
"samurai this, samurai that,"

00:19:27.667 --> 00:19:28.960 position:50% align:center
making fun of my dad?

00:19:29.044 --> 00:19:31.421 position:50% align:center
He trains daily from the
crack of dawn until sundown!

00:19:31.504 --> 00:19:33.423 position:50% align:center
How dare you use him
to embarrass me.

00:19:33.506 --> 00:19:34.966 position:50% align:center
You don't even know him!

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:37.844 position:50% align:center
My dad's the best samurai in
the world and I'm proud of him!

00:19:37.927 --> 00:19:39.888 position:50% align:center
You twerps are nothing
compared to my dad!

00:19:39.971 --> 00:19:42.349 position:50% align:center
You're barely
even foot soldiers!

00:19:49.814 --> 00:19:52.233 position:50% align:center
Ninja...

00:19:53.485 --> 00:19:54.694 position:50% align:center
...Dogeza.

00:19:57.947 --> 00:20:00.075 position:50% align:center
Hey. You do it too.

00:20:03.536 --> 00:20:06.247 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
We're really sorry.

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:28.228 position:50% align:center
Why'd you do all that, Leo?

00:20:28.311 --> 00:20:31.398 position:50% align:center
Because you were
losing your smile.

00:20:32.816 --> 00:20:36.194 position:50% align:center
You deserve to have fun at
school and anywhere else you go.

00:20:36.277 --> 00:20:37.737 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:20:37.821 --> 00:20:39.739 position:50% align:center
[LEONARDO] I thought I saw a
chance to make things better,

00:20:39.823 --> 00:20:41.574 position:50% align:center
so I took it.

00:20:42.492 --> 00:20:43.535 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, but...

00:20:43.618 --> 00:20:45.954 position:50% align:center
...I am always gonna
try to help you.

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:51.710 position:50% align:center
Jeez, Leo!

00:20:51.793 --> 00:20:53.586 position:50% align:center
Everyone's gonna think I have
a bad temper 'cause of you.

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:55.839 position:50% align:center
I told those jerks everything
I was thinking.

00:20:55.922 --> 00:20:57.382 position:50% align:center
This is the worst.

00:20:57.465 --> 00:20:58.717 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:00.719 position:50% align:center
Do you think that you could
forgive me someday?

00:21:00.802 --> 00:21:02.303 position:50% align:center
I dunno.

00:21:02.387 --> 00:21:04.431 position:50% align:center
Things are pro'lly gonna be real
rough for me at school tomorrow.

00:21:04.514 --> 00:21:07.183 position:50% align:center
So... we'll see.

00:21:07.267 --> 00:21:09.978 position:50% align:center
I am truly so sorry.

00:21:10.061 --> 00:21:12.397 position:50% align:center
[REI]
Hm. Are you really? Oh, hey.

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:13.732 position:50% align:center
For the record,

00:21:13.815 --> 00:21:16.317 position:50% align:center
nobody's allowed to call me
Rachel except for you.

00:21:16.401 --> 00:21:17.861 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:21:17.944 --> 00:21:20.280 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Rachel!

00:21:20.363 --> 00:21:22.532 position:50% align:center
[REI]
Also, we're out of milk.

00:21:22.615 --> 00:21:24.284 position:50% align:center
[LEONARDO]
I'll obtain some in a jiffy!

00:21:28.496 --> 00:21:30.874 position:50% align:center
Seriously? Oh! She's here.

00:21:30.957 --> 00:21:32.667 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:44.971 position:50% align:center
Good morning.
