One man sits alone,

00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:16.516 position:50% align:center
contemplative amidst
the noise of the gym.

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:20.437 position:50% align:center
This is gymnast, Jotaro Aragaki.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.898 position:50% align:center
Better known to
his fans as "Samurai." 

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:26.901 position:50% align:center
[DOCUMENTARY]
After graduating high school,

00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:29.195 position:50% align:center
Aragaki joined a corporate team.

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.449 position:50% align:center
He competed in his
first Olympics in 1992,

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:34.659 position:50% align:center
taking home
an individual bronze.

00:00:34.743 --> 00:00:36.745 position:50% align:center
This August, four years later,

00:00:36.828 --> 00:00:40.248 position:50% align:center
the rising star made
his second Olympic appearance.

00:00:40.331 --> 00:00:41.916 position:50% align:center
There, he won a silver medal,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.628 position:50% align:center
setting off a wave of
samurai fever across Japan.

00:00:46.671 --> 00:00:49.966 position:50% align:center
[DOCUMENTARY]  On his days off,
he spends time with his family.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.969 position:50% align:center
He married popular actress,
Tomoyo Mifune,

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:54.888 position:50% align:center
and they have
one young daughter.

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:59.559 position:50% align:center
Truth is,
I compete for my family,

00:00:59.642 --> 00:01:02.145 position:50% align:center
so they can see me
doing my best.

00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:05.106 position:50% align:center
Now, that was six years ago,

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.567 position:50% align:center
filmed shortly after
his second Olympics.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.988 position:50% align:center
So, we can all agree he had a
successful early career, right?

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:14.949 position:50% align:center
There was something odd about
him even back then, though.

00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:17.577 position:50% align:center
You may say "odd,"
but I say endearing.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.246 position:50% align:center
[COMMENTATOR B] I'm a big fan
of Mr. Aragaki, and personally,

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.708 position:50% align:center
I was hoping for an end
more befitting a samurai.

00:01:23.792 --> 00:01:27.504 position:50% align:center
[MC sighs] Have to wonder
what his coach thought about it.

00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:33.510 position:50% align:center
That was idiotic!

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:36.137 position:50% align:center
[MC] Some critics
have been suggesting

00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:38.098 position:50% align:center
that the press conference
was a stunt,

00:01:38.181 --> 00:01:40.725 position:50% align:center
calling it a "fake retirement"
intended to--

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:42.352 position:50% align:center
Later.

00:01:42.435 --> 00:01:45.355 position:50% align:center
I will retire. Later.

00:01:47.023 --> 00:01:48.358 position:50% align:center
Well, moving on.

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:51.236 position:50% align:center
There's more exciting news
from the gymnastics world.

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:53.071 position:50% align:center
[NEWSCASTER]
Yes, a successful performance

00:01:53.154 --> 00:01:55.657 position:50% align:center
from the high school student
everyone's got their eye on--

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.785 position:50% align:center
the "Bandana Prince,"
Tetsuo Minamino!

00:01:58.868 --> 00:01:59.869 position:50% align:center
He's gotten a new nickname

00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:02.455 position:50% align:center
after receiving
top scores at All-Japan.

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:03.707 position:50% align:center
Some people are now calling him

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.793 position:50% align:center
the savior of
Japanese gymnastics.

00:02:06.876 --> 00:02:09.170 position:50% align:center
We caught up
with him after practice.

00:02:11.006 --> 00:02:12.298 position:50% align:center
Not much.

00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:17.387 position:50% align:center
I just have to win.

00:03:52.816 --> 00:03:55.068 position:50% align:center
I'm from <i>Pathos Weekly</i> .

00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:56.695 position:50% align:center
About yesterday's
press conference--

00:03:56.778 --> 00:03:58.863 position:50% align:center
Can you tell us why you
retracted your retirement?

00:03:58.947 --> 00:04:02.075 position:50% align:center
Did you have some kind of
disagreement with your coach?

00:04:02.158 --> 00:04:03.410 position:50% align:center
No.

00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:04.869 position:50% align:center
Your scores haven't
really been stellar lately.

00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:08.248 position:50% align:center
You sure you can keep
your career going?

00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:10.917 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I think so.

00:04:11.001 --> 00:04:12.419 position:50% align:center
[REPORTER]
Hmm...

00:04:12.502 --> 00:04:14.295 position:50% align:center
Is there anything else you would
like our readers to know?

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:16.089 position:50% align:center
Something juicer, maybe?

00:04:16.172 --> 00:04:18.758 position:50% align:center
[AMAKUSA]
What are you people doing?

00:04:20.802 --> 00:04:23.722 position:50% align:center
Did I agree to an interview?

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.194 position:50% align:center
I know I totally blindsided you.

00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:42.115 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.
But please, just let me try.

00:04:42.198 --> 00:04:44.784 position:50% align:center
I think I can still compete.

00:04:46.494 --> 00:04:49.414 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I might not be as
powerful as I used to be,

00:04:49.497 --> 00:04:52.083 position:50% align:center
but I'll make up for it
by practicing even harder.

00:04:52.167 --> 00:04:53.043 position:50% align:center
I'll practice more th--

00:04:53.126 --> 00:04:54.461 position:50% align:center
Enough.

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:06.681 position:50% align:center
If you want to keep going, then
that's your decision to make.

00:05:06.765 --> 00:05:09.434 position:50% align:center
But I won't have
anything to do with it.

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:15.732 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
Amakusa!

00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:18.318 position:50% align:center
[AMAKUSA] There is no place
for you at this club.

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:28.453 position:50% align:center
Yeah, uh, Amakusa kinda
fired me from the club.

[REI]
It's Dad.

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:38.338 position:50% align:center
He was kicked
out of the club today.

00:05:38.421 --> 00:05:41.257 position:50% align:center

Enough, Bigbird!

00:05:49.307 --> 00:05:53.186 position:50% align:center
Okay, your first apology
didn't work, so you try again.

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:56.189 position:50% align:center
He made it pretty clear.

00:05:56.272 --> 00:06:00.944 position:50% align:center
I've seen him get angry before,
but not like that.

00:06:04.114 --> 00:06:05.281 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, though.

00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:07.826 position:50% align:center
I'll convince him
to forgive me somehow.

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:09.244 position:50% align:center
Until then,

00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:11.955 position:50% align:center
I just need to figure out what
I can manage on my own.

00:06:17.877 --> 00:06:20.839 position:50% align:center
No one to help me
and no equipment.

00:06:20.922 --> 00:06:23.299 position:50% align:center
What kind of training can I do?

00:06:27.178 --> 00:06:28.930 position:50% align:center

What about that time you
used a nail instead of a needle

00:09:58.098 --> 00:10:00.642 position:50% align:center
and hit it with a hammer till
my arm was soaked in blood?

00:10:00.725 --> 00:10:01.226 position:50% align:center
Idiot!

00:10:02.977 --> 00:10:05.063 position:50% align:center
Now, then, I'm Britney.

00:10:05.146 --> 00:10:07.315 position:50% align:center

Leo, make sure you don't get
in the way of Dad's training.

00:10:37.095 --> 00:10:38.596 position:50% align:center
Understood!

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.808 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO] I'll buy a new light

Good.

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:48.773 position:50% align:center

I'm home, indeed!

Joe! Are you finished training?

00:11:28.313 --> 00:11:31.191 position:50% align:center
Work was a lot
of fun again today!

00:11:31.274 --> 00:11:34.361 position:50% align:center
I still need a bunch of help,
but no one minds.

00:11:38.281 --> 00:11:40.533 position:50% align:center
Joe, what's wrong?

00:11:44.079 --> 00:11:46.206 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
I know what that's like.

00:11:46.289 --> 00:11:49.292 position:50% align:center
Always needing someone's help.

00:11:49.376 --> 00:11:52.504 position:50% align:center
Rei's smile is the reason
I didn't retire.

00:11:52.587 --> 00:11:56.049 position:50% align:center
I thought I could make it all
work on my own somehow.

00:11:56.132 --> 00:11:58.426 position:50% align:center
But I've been failing
for a while now.

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:02.138 position:50% align:center
As a gymnast and a father.

00:12:02.847 --> 00:12:04.099 position:50% align:center
Joe, slow down.

00:12:04.182 --> 00:12:06.434 position:50% align:center
What are you talking about?

00:12:06.518 --> 00:12:10.480 position:50% align:center
It's no wonder Amakusa doesn't
want anything to do with me.

00:12:10.563 --> 00:12:13.149 position:50% align:center
A lousy dad
with a hurt shoulder.

00:12:13.233 --> 00:12:15.235 position:50% align:center
I'm a total mess.

00:12:15.318 --> 00:12:16.361 position:50% align:center
A what?

00:12:16.444 --> 00:12:18.947 position:50% align:center
You have an injured shoulder?

00:12:21.157 --> 00:12:22.450 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
Yeah.

00:12:23.034 --> 00:12:25.078 position:50% align:center
I know someone who can heal you!

00:12:26.788 --> 00:12:28.748 position:50% align:center

00:12:32.836 --> 00:12:33.962 position:50% align:center

Now, onward!

00:12:35.088 --> 00:12:36.840 position:50% align:center

fearlessness of a ninja!

00:12:36.923 --> 00:12:38.925 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
Hey! Stop it. I'm going!

00:12:46.266 --> 00:12:47.767 position:50% align:center
[LEONARDO]
Is she dead?

00:12:48.768 --> 00:12:51.771 position:50% align:center
No, still alive! That's good.

Hmm...

00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:18.340 position:50% align:center
Yes? Oh, no!

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:22.469 position:50% align:center
Let's see.
So, it's the shoulder.

00:13:22.552 --> 00:13:23.887 position:50% align:center
You can tell?

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:25.305 position:50% align:center
[BRITNEY chuckles]

00:13:25.972 --> 00:13:29.142 position:50% align:center
All right, lose the
clothes and lie down.

00:13:34.189 --> 00:13:36.066 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO] How did you
know about my shoulder?

00:13:36.149 --> 00:13:39.527 position:50% align:center
Huh? From your friend Leo.

00:13:40.403 --> 00:13:41.821 position:50% align:center
Yes? How can I help?

00:13:41.905 --> 00:13:43.656 position:50% align:center
I'll do my ninja-best.

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.909 position:50% align:center
So I can see Joe the Samurai!

00:13:45.992 --> 00:13:47.202 position:50% align:center
Now, here we go.

00:13:47.285 --> 00:13:48.745 position:50% align:center

00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:50.497 position:50% align:center
Are you ready?

00:14:01.257 --> 00:14:03.635 position:50% align:center
Okay, you're free to sit up.

00:14:03.718 --> 00:14:06.763 position:50% align:center
Well? Is it all healed up now?

00:14:12.519 --> 00:14:13.645 position:50% align:center
Whoa!

00:14:13.728 --> 00:14:16.773 position:50% align:center
[BRITNEY]
You were treated by the best.

00:14:16.856 --> 00:14:20.652 position:50% align:center
That said,
it was quite a close call.

00:14:20.735 --> 00:14:22.862 position:50% align:center
You're lucky you didn't
start training seriously

00:14:22.946 --> 00:14:24.489 position:50% align:center
in your current condition.

00:14:24.572 --> 00:14:27.117 position:50% align:center
If you had, that shoulder
would have exploded.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.368 position:50% align:center
Boom!

00:14:28.451 --> 00:14:29.953 position:50% align:center
"Boom"?

00:14:30.036 --> 00:14:32.580 position:50% align:center
Listen, I'm not trying
to frighten you,

00:14:32.664 --> 00:14:35.709 position:50% align:center
but I am a medical professional.

00:14:35.792 --> 00:14:37.043 position:50% align:center
And I can tell you,

00:14:37.127 --> 00:14:41.256 position:50% align:center
your case is serious--a
matter of life and death.

00:14:41.339 --> 00:14:45.218 position:50% align:center
My shoulder would
explode, and I'd die?

00:14:46.428 --> 00:14:48.096 position:50% align:center
[BRITNEY]
Here.

00:14:49.597 --> 00:14:53.059 position:50% align:center
New routine: I want you
doing tai chi every day.

00:14:53.143 --> 00:14:55.895 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, I'll provide
detailed instruction.

00:14:55.979 --> 00:14:57.689 position:50% align:center
Doing this will
help my shoulder?

00:14:57.772 --> 00:14:59.649 position:50% align:center
It won't explode?

00:14:59.733 --> 00:15:02.402 position:50% align:center
Tai chi trains your body
without causing it stress.

00:15:02.485 --> 00:15:05.739 position:50% align:center
It enhances strength and
increases one's stamina.

00:15:05.822 --> 00:15:07.657 position:50% align:center
A good place to start.

00:15:07.741 --> 00:15:10.577 position:50% align:center
Along with regular
acupuncture, of course.

00:15:11.745 --> 00:15:14.539 position:50% align:center
Maybe if I just did
some simple gymnast--

00:15:14.622 --> 00:15:18.251 position:50% align:center
No! Unless you want to die.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.628 position:50% align:center
Gotcha.

00:15:31.765 --> 00:15:34.517 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO] Is it really okay
for us to be doing this here?

00:15:54.996 --> 00:15:57.791 position:50% align:center
[BRITNEY]
Stabby stab.

00:16:19.187 --> 00:16:21.731 position:50% align:center
Well? How does your body feel?

00:16:21.815 --> 00:16:23.483 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
Pretty good, actually.

00:16:23.566 --> 00:16:26.695 position:50% align:center
So, you know, there's something
called overtraining syndrome.

00:16:26.778 --> 00:16:28.613 position:50% align:center
You ever heard of that?

00:16:28.697 --> 00:16:29.906 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
No.

00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:32.992 position:50% align:center
[BRITNEY] It's not that
well-known in Japan yet.

00:16:33.076 --> 00:16:36.413 position:50% align:center
Simply put, it's when you
train too much without rest.

00:16:36.496 --> 00:16:39.791 position:50% align:center
The stress leaves your body
feeling constantly fatigued.

00:16:39.874 --> 00:16:41.501 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
I guess that makes sense.

00:16:41.584 --> 00:16:43.461 position:50% align:center
[BRITNEY] There are
psychological effects, too,

00:16:43.545 --> 00:16:45.714 position:50% align:center
like irritability,
even depression.

00:16:45.797 --> 00:16:48.133 position:50% align:center
It's a serious condition.

00:16:48.216 --> 00:16:50.468 position:50% align:center
One that you were on
the verge of developing.

00:16:50.552 --> 00:16:51.511 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
Huh?

00:16:51.594 --> 00:16:53.179 position:50% align:center
It didn't have to be tai chi.

00:16:53.263 --> 00:16:55.432 position:50% align:center
Just something
that wasn't gymnastics.

00:16:55.515 --> 00:16:57.934 position:50% align:center
So your body
could rest and heal.

00:17:02.063 --> 00:17:03.648 position:50% align:center
Jotaro.

00:17:03.732 --> 00:17:04.524 position:50% align:center
I'm good.

00:17:04.607 --> 00:17:06.234 position:50% align:center
Just a little tired.

00:17:06.317 --> 00:17:08.528 position:50% align:center
I think you should give
your body a break.

00:17:08.611 --> 00:17:10.530 position:50% align:center
What if you make things worse?

00:17:10.613 --> 00:17:13.408 position:50% align:center
Push too hard and you'll
hurt your shoulder again.

00:17:13.491 --> 00:17:14.576 position:50% align:center
It's fine.

00:17:14.659 --> 00:17:17.829 position:50% align:center
Either I keep training
like this or lose.

00:17:17.912 --> 00:17:21.374 position:50% align:center
[AMAKUSA] Hey, try listening
to me once in a while!

00:17:23.126 --> 00:17:24.586 position:50% align:center
That coach.

00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:27.839 position:50% align:center
I take it he's the one who told
you that you should retire?

00:17:27.922 --> 00:17:29.591 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:17:29.674 --> 00:17:31.634 position:50% align:center
[BRITNEY]
Hmph.

00:17:31.718 --> 00:17:33.470 position:50% align:center
Interesting.

00:17:51.363 --> 00:17:54.783 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
Tomoyo. I've been such an idiot.

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:01.414 position:50% align:center
Well, talk. I'm a busy man.

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:03.583 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
Amakusa!

00:18:03.667 --> 00:18:06.086 position:50% align:center
I am truly sorry!

00:18:06.169 --> 00:18:10.465 position:50% align:center
I saw what I wanted
to see instead of the truth.

00:18:10.548 --> 00:18:12.050 position:50% align:center
I trusted my body so much;

00:18:12.133 --> 00:18:16.012 position:50% align:center
I was sure I could push it
to do what I needed it to.

00:18:16.096 --> 00:18:17.597 position:50% align:center
I was too blinded
by that to realize

00:18:17.681 --> 00:18:21.351 position:50% align:center
you were urging me
to retire for my own good.

00:18:21.434 --> 00:18:25.855 position:50% align:center
But I get it now.
I finally understand.

00:18:25.939 --> 00:18:30.235 position:50% align:center
And I swear, if you'll be
my coach again, I'll do better.

00:18:32.529 --> 00:18:33.697 position:50% align:center
I'll listen to what you say,

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:36.449 position:50% align:center
like I should have
been doing all along.

00:18:36.533 --> 00:18:39.786 position:50% align:center
I know I'm completely
hopeless on my own.

00:18:41.621 --> 00:18:43.915 position:50% align:center
Without you. I think.

00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:48.712 position:50% align:center
Please say yes!

00:18:48.795 --> 00:18:50.296 position:50% align:center
One more chance!

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:52.841 position:50% align:center
Just give me one more
chance to fight with you.

00:18:52.924 --> 00:18:54.426 position:50% align:center
Please!

00:19:06.146 --> 00:19:08.523 position:50% align:center
[AMAKUSA] That's not how
a samurai should act.

00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:10.734 position:50% align:center
My turn now.

00:19:10.817 --> 00:19:12.736 position:50% align:center
Listen.

00:19:12.819 --> 00:19:14.446 position:50% align:center
You're old for this sport.

00:19:14.529 --> 00:19:17.949 position:50% align:center
Your stamina and technique will
only continue to go downhill.

00:19:18.033 --> 00:19:20.827 position:50% align:center
That shoulder is
a ticking timebomb.

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:23.038 position:50% align:center
And even if I give it my all,

00:19:23.121 --> 00:19:26.750 position:50% align:center
those are simple facts
that I can't change.

00:19:26.833 --> 00:19:29.544 position:50% align:center
The only thing
I can do is work with you

00:19:29.627 --> 00:19:32.088 position:50% align:center
to figure out a way we can
overcome those obstacles

00:19:32.172 --> 00:19:34.257 position:50% align:center
and keep on fighting.

00:19:36.384 --> 00:19:40.180 position:50% align:center
I'll be going into this almost
as clueless as you are.

00:19:41.306 --> 00:19:43.099 position:50% align:center
But you'll try?

00:19:45.352 --> 00:19:46.603 position:50% align:center
Aw, man.

00:19:46.686 --> 00:19:49.522 position:50% align:center
I'm crazy, starting from
scratch again at this age.

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:54.903 position:50% align:center
Amakusa.

00:19:55.612 --> 00:19:58.656 position:50% align:center
Well, let's see just
how far we can take this.

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.243 position:50% align:center
I can't thank you enough!

00:20:05.955 --> 00:20:08.124 position:50% align:center
This is a big change.
What happened?

My acupuncturist
helped me realize some stuff.

00:20:13.004 --> 00:20:14.339 position:50% align:center
What?

00:20:14.422 --> 00:20:18.218 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Referral from Leo.

00:20:18.301 --> 00:20:23.473 position:50% align:center
I see. Sounds to me
like you owe the ninja one.

00:20:24.182 --> 00:20:26.434 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
I guess so.

00:20:28.895 --> 00:20:31.439 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
Leo. Let's go.

00:20:31.815 --> 00:20:33.733 position:50% align:center
[LEONARDO]
Joe! How was it?

00:20:33.817 --> 00:20:35.235 position:50% align:center
Comeback starts tomorrow.

00:20:35.318 --> 00:20:35.902 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:20:35.985 --> 00:20:38.196 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey, Jotaro!

00:20:38.279 --> 00:20:40.323 position:50% align:center
Tackey, you're here!

00:20:40.407 --> 00:20:42.617 position:50% align:center
Leomaru!

00:20:42.701 --> 00:20:45.120 position:50% align:center
--Hey! Yeah!
--Hey! Yeah!

00:20:46.413 --> 00:20:48.081 position:50% align:center
You've been AWOL for a while.

00:20:48.164 --> 00:20:49.416 position:50% align:center
What's up with that, huh?

00:20:49.499 --> 00:20:51.668 position:50% align:center
[JOTARO]
Uh, I was sorta fired.

00:20:51.751 --> 00:20:53.336 position:50% align:center
No way! For real, man?

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:55.880 position:50% align:center
Amakusa, Dude,
you shoulda heard him.

00:20:55.964 --> 00:20:59.217 position:50% align:center
"Haven't had any word
from Jotaro lately, have you?

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:02.053 position:50% align:center
"Any rumors about him
going to another club?"

00:21:02.137 --> 00:21:04.723 position:50% align:center
He asked like
five thousand times!

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.362 position:50% align:center
We'll keep working hard, right?

00:21:19.446 --> 00:21:20.655 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:21:31.082 --> 00:21:32.334 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:35.712 --> 00:21:38.465 position:50% align:center
You are an embarrassment
to the sport of gymnastics.

00:21:38.548 --> 00:21:40.008 position:50% align:center
Moron!
