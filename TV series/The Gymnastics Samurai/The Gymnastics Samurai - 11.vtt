[NEWSCASTER] Jotaro Aragaki
gave an incredible comeback

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.041
performance at
yesterday's All-Japan

00:00:21.125 --> 00:00:24.583
Could we be looking at
another wave of samurai fever?

00:00:24.667 --> 00:00:26.333
All right. I'm off.

00:00:26.417 --> 00:00:28.417
[REI]
Mm. See ya there later.

00:00:42.041 --> 00:00:43.250
[BB]
Hmm?

00:00:46.917 --> 00:00:49.625
Don't be sad.
You should just smile.

00:00:52.542 --> 00:00:54.500
[AYU]
Huh? Seriously?

00:00:54.583 --> 00:00:55.834
That's what he told me.

00:00:55.917 --> 00:00:57.542
He's leaving, so he
won't be able to watch Dad.

00:00:57.625 --> 00:00:59.083
London, huh?

00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:01.667
So Leo's decided to return
to his own battlefield

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.250
and fight once more.

00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:05.583
And we'll miss him,
but what can we do?

00:01:05.667 --> 00:01:07.834
If he says he wants
to dance again

00:01:07.917 --> 00:01:10.417
shouldn't we support him?

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.875
I guess it was pretty weird,

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:14.417
him hanging
around being a ninja.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.250
Hey.
You're forgetting something.

00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:17.083
[ALL]
Huh?

00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:18.500
Well, think about it.

00:01:18.583 --> 00:01:19.542
He looked up to the Samurai

00:01:19.625 --> 00:01:21.208
and loved his
gymnastics so much,

00:01:21.291 --> 00:01:23.417
he became your family ninja.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.250
Maybe that is a little weird,

00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:27.458
but what's weirder
is him leaving like this.

00:01:27.542 --> 00:01:28.542
Yeah, but, what he said

00:01:28.625 --> 00:01:30.500
about going back
to the ballet company.

00:01:30.583 --> 00:01:32.750
Oh, please!
No way is that the true story.

00:01:32.834 --> 00:01:34.625
He would have said
something about it sooner.

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:35.875
Total lie.

00:01:37.208 --> 00:01:38.375
[BRITNEY]
Hmm...

00:01:38.458 --> 00:01:40.834
The boy could be right. Yes.

00:01:40.917 --> 00:01:45.417
It's definitely possible. Maybe.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.834
[car horn honks]

00:01:54.875 --> 00:01:57.583
That's it! I'm fixing this!

00:01:57.667 --> 00:01:59.166
[BB squawks]

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.458
Don't send me back
to South America!

00:02:00.542 --> 00:02:03.000
Sorry, Kazu. Get out!

00:02:03.083 --> 00:02:04.667
He's coming.
He'll bring good luck.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:05.875
And me?

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:08.250
You go to the venue
and give Dad a message.

00:02:08.333 --> 00:02:10.417
Tell him that I'm
bringing Leo, for sure!

00:02:11.875 --> 00:02:14.333
Right, and take one for me,
too, while you're at it.

00:02:14.417 --> 00:02:16.291
Huh? Hey, wait--

00:02:16.375 --> 00:02:18.500
How'm I supposed to get
to the arena, though?

00:02:18.583 --> 00:02:20.291
[BRITNEY]
Simple!

00:02:20.375 --> 00:02:23.208
I shall see that
you get there safely.

00:02:23.291 --> 00:02:24.792
Great, thanks!

00:02:24.875 --> 00:02:26.917
Kazu, you've got this.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.417
Yeah. Sure.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.500
Tell Dad.

00:02:31.583 --> 00:02:33.625
Yeah. I will!

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.542
Now, let's go.

00:02:39.917 --> 00:02:42.125
[AMAKUSA]
So, I bet Rei was happy.

00:02:42.208 --> 00:02:44.291
Um, sure she was.

00:02:44.375 --> 00:02:46.583
[AMAKUSA]
And? She's coming today, right?

00:02:46.667 --> 00:02:48.750
She is, yeah.

00:02:48.834 --> 00:02:51.500
Daughters can be
difficult sometimes.

00:02:51.583 --> 00:02:53.834
Just watch, she'll
grow up before you know it.

00:02:53.917 --> 00:02:56.583
Be too cool to answer
your messages anymore.

00:02:56.667 --> 00:02:57.750
Seriously?

00:02:57.834 --> 00:02:59.291
[AMAKUSA]
Yep.

00:02:59.375 --> 00:03:02.250
I told my daughter there'd be
a live broadcast today, too.

00:03:02.333 --> 00:03:05.083
A lot can change in a year.

00:03:05.166 --> 00:03:06.500
I mean, think about us.

00:03:06.583 --> 00:03:08.583
One year ago.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.750
You stuck with me, though.

00:03:23.083 --> 00:03:25.291
Something's changed
since yesterday.

00:03:27.125 --> 00:03:28.667
[REI]
Hurry, Grandma!

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.834
The agent said they'd be leaving
the hotel just past noon.

00:03:31.917 --> 00:03:33.583
Isn't a round trip
to and from Narita

00:03:33.667 --> 00:03:35.250
gonna be cutting it super close?

00:03:35.333 --> 00:03:37.041
That's why we need to hurry!

00:03:37.875 --> 00:03:39.458
Quiet back there!

00:03:42.333 --> 00:03:44.208

So...

There's the Samur--

I mean, Aragaki's dad.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.250
[ANNOUNCER B]
And now, our gymnasts.

00:03:50.333 --> 00:03:53.667
Jotaro Aragaki,
from Yotsuba Sports Club.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.500
Aragaki's dad, I have a message!

Hey, Aragaki's dad!
Can you hear me?

00:04:01.834 --> 00:04:06.041

--What's Bri want?

00:04:15.458 --> 00:04:17.333
Well, he's listening now.

00:04:17.417 --> 00:04:19.375
I have a message
from your daughter!

00:04:19.458 --> 00:04:22.083
She said she's
bringing Leo for sure!

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.291
Oh, and Takizawa,
Miss Ayu says, "Do your best!"

00:04:32.375 --> 00:04:34.834
Huh?! Love!

00:04:40.083 --> 00:04:43.041
[REI] This is taking
too long! Come on!

00:04:43.125 --> 00:04:45.417
Can't you just pass
the car in front of us?

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.083
It's an unmarked police car.

00:04:48.166 --> 00:04:49.875
Calm down.
You've heard the saying,

00:04:49.959 --> 00:04:51.750
"Haste makes waste,"
haven't you?

[squawks]

00:04:53.417 --> 00:04:55.083

Yes?

[REI]
Where are you right now?

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.583
[SCARLETT]
Nearing the airport.

00:05:02.667 --> 00:05:03.917
We'll be arriving shortly.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.291
Find a way to stall Leo!

00:05:05.375 --> 00:05:07.208
We'll be there soon, too!

00:05:07.291 --> 00:05:08.750
Understood. Will do.

00:05:08.834 --> 00:05:10.166
Goodbye now.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.417
Who was that?

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.709
Just Headquarters.

00:05:12.792 --> 00:05:14.375
Checking in.

00:05:20.875 --> 00:05:21.917
[ANNOUNCER A] Let's see
if he sticks the landing

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.709
on this last pass.

00:05:26.583 --> 00:05:27.583
[ANNOUNCER A]
He did it!

00:05:27.667 --> 00:05:29.834
Another solid landing
from Aragaki.

00:05:29.917 --> 00:05:31.917
He's doing very well today, too.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.542
He took advantage of his height
to deliver a dynamic routine.

00:05:38.834 --> 00:05:41.375
[ANNOUNCER A
9.525!

00:05:41.458 --> 00:05:44.417
Even better than
his score yesterday.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.875
[KAMIMURA] He certainly earned
it with that performance.

00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:49.583
[ANNOUNCER A] Now, last up
in Group One is Minamino.

00:05:49.667 --> 00:05:51.875
He made some mistakes
in the first round.

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:54.125
I'm sure the
pressure's on today.

00:05:58.333 --> 00:06:01.041
I notice he seems to be
missing his usual arm cover.

00:06:01.125 --> 00:06:04.250
I wonder if it's a sign that
something's changed with him.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.250
[ANNOUNCER A]
A double-double layout!

00:06:12.333 --> 00:06:14.750
That was a Super E level skill!

00:06:14.834 --> 00:06:15.875
No wavering.

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:16.875
Seems he's worked through

00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:18.834
whatever held him
back yesterday.

00:06:18.917 --> 00:06:21.750
And he included more twists
than Aragaki's Tsukahara.

00:06:21.834 --> 00:06:25.125
He's serious about improving
his performance today.

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.250
[ANNOUNCER A]
A Fedorchenko.

00:06:28.333 --> 00:06:29.417
Front splits.

00:06:30.375 --> 00:06:32.625
Now, his last pass.

00:06:36.875 --> 00:06:38.875
There it is! A double double!

00:06:39.709 --> 00:06:41.875
He made a real statement
with that routine.

00:06:41.959 --> 00:06:44.000
It would be considered
difficult at the world level,

00:06:44.083 --> 00:06:45.792
and he pulled it off perfectly.

00:06:46.792 --> 00:06:50.917
[ANNOUNCER A] 9.775!
He's ahead of Aragaki now.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.083
[ANNOUNCER A] This is the true
Tetsuo Minamino!

00:06:55.166 --> 00:06:56.667
He's strong.

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:59.000
That kid's gonna make you fight
for it every step of the way.

00:07:12.875 --> 00:07:13.792

We're here.

00:07:13.875 --> 00:07:14.792
Uh, Yeah.

Thanks a lot for
the ride, Grandma.

00:07:16.667 --> 00:07:19.917
Bring that boy back,
even if you have to drag him.

00:07:53.291 --> 00:07:54.792
We'll be fine.

00:07:54.875 --> 00:07:56.000
Let's wait.

00:07:56.083 --> 00:07:56.875
No.

There he is!

Get out of here. I can take

Why did you come here, Rei?

00:10:16.792 --> 00:10:17.542
Why not?

00:10:17.625 --> 00:10:18.875
Dad's been waiting for you.

00:10:18.959 --> 00:10:22.709
[LEONARDO] Joe can fight
fine without me there!

00:10:22.792 --> 00:10:26.166
He isn't weak
and broken like I am.

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:27.792
He's always so strong.

00:10:29.333 --> 00:10:31.417
For starters, the image
of Tomoyo in your head

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.583
isn't as accurate as you think.

00:10:37.542 --> 00:10:38.834
You're wrong about Dad, Leo.

00:10:38.917 --> 00:10:40.834
He isn't always that strong.

00:10:40.917 --> 00:10:43.458
He's not some superhero
from a movie.

00:10:43.542 --> 00:10:44.959
For years after Mom died,

00:10:45.041 --> 00:10:48.959
he struggled with
gymnastics so much.

00:10:49.041 --> 00:10:51.542
He just kept on losing.

00:10:51.625 --> 00:10:53.333
And if you hadn't come,

00:10:53.417 --> 00:10:56.291
I think he might
actually have quit.

00:10:56.375 --> 00:10:58.458
He needs you to come out
and support him today.

00:10:58.542 --> 00:11:01.333
Without you there,
I'm worried he could lose.

So please.

Stick by Dad and
watch him till the end!

00:11:04.917 --> 00:11:07.041
You're the Aragaki family ninja.

00:11:07.125 --> 00:11:09.208
And the Samurai is in trouble!

00:11:09.291 --> 00:11:12.625
Just stop, Rachel.
You don't know anything.

00:11:12.709 --> 00:11:16.625
I don't have the strength
to help Joe or anyone else.

00:11:16.709 --> 00:11:20.417
Whatever you think I did,
it was just coincidence.

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:21.625
Look at me now.

00:11:21.709 --> 00:11:24.792
So scared of letting
Joe down, I ran away.

00:11:24.875 --> 00:11:28.166
That's what I've been doing
this whole time--running!

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:30.291
If you knew the real me,

00:11:30.375 --> 00:11:33.125
then you would leave
right now and never look back!

00:11:36.458 --> 00:11:38.125
I'm not going anywhere!

00:11:38.208 --> 00:11:39.458
Neither is Dad!

00:11:39.542 --> 00:11:40.959
If you're broken,
then we'll stick by you

00:11:41.041 --> 00:11:43.917
until you're back
on your feet again.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.667
We'll go to London
if you need us.

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:47.166
Because you're you!

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:48.709
So come and watch Dad.

00:11:48.792 --> 00:11:51.750
We both want our Leo
to be there today!

[REI] "The ninja way is
to fight with all you have!

00:11:57.667 --> 00:12:01.834
To survive by accepting
that you might die in the end.

00:12:01.917 --> 00:12:04.000
To understand
your own weakness is

00:12:04.083 --> 00:12:06.500
to carry an unmoving

Use that blade

Okay?

[ANNOUNCER A]
The first group is on the vault,

00:12:46.917 --> 00:12:50.166
their fourth event,
and Aragaki is up now.

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:51.792
He scored two tenths
of a point higher

00:12:51.875 --> 00:12:53.375
than Minamino
on the still rings,

00:12:53.458 --> 00:12:55.709
slightly narrowing
the gap between them.

00:12:55.792 --> 00:12:57.709
Will he narrow it further here?

00:13:04.041 --> 00:13:07.375
Another Yeo II,
like in the qualifiers!

00:13:07.458 --> 00:13:08.875
Slight stumble there.

00:13:08.959 --> 00:13:11.625
Disappointing, considering
how precise it was otherwise.

[ANNOUNCER A]
9.675.

00:13:15.375 --> 00:13:18.125
Definitely not a low score,
but that misstep hurt.

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:25.041
He landed the Lu Yufu!

00:13:25.125 --> 00:13:28.250
Looks like Minamino's
continuing the day's streak.

00:13:28.333 --> 00:13:30.458
[KAMIMURA] I've never seen a
Japanese gymnast try that vault

00:13:30.542 --> 00:13:32.709
in an official competition.

00:13:32.792 --> 00:13:34.417
[ANNOUNCER A]
Now, for the score.

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:38.208
9.725. That's a high one!

00:13:38.291 --> 00:13:40.750
That widens his
lead over Aragaki.

00:13:40.834 --> 00:13:43.583
He may be too strong to beat.

00:13:43.667 --> 00:13:46.041
Aragaki has just two events
left to pull ahead:

00:13:46.125 --> 00:13:48.333
the parallel bars
and the horizontal bar.

00:13:49.041 --> 00:13:50.333
[AYU]
No good.

we'll get 'em there in time.

Woo-hoo!

00:14:17.083 --> 00:14:19.417
Group One has finished up
on the parallel bars,

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:20.500
which means each of the groups

00:14:20.583 --> 00:14:22.625
has now wrapped up
their fifth event.

00:14:22.709 --> 00:14:25.500
Let's take another look
at the standings.

00:14:25.583 --> 00:14:27.959
At the top right now
is Tetsuo Minamino.

00:14:28.041 --> 00:14:29.792
His score on the
parallel bars gives him

00:14:29.875 --> 00:14:34.041
a total of 47.425 points.

00:14:34.125 --> 00:14:37.208
Still in second place
is Jotaro Aragaki.

00:14:37.291 --> 00:14:39.583
With a total of 47.325,

00:14:39.667 --> 00:14:41.959
he trails Minamino
by one tenth of a point.

00:14:43.875 --> 00:14:46.250

but you want to
know what I think?

Four difficult release

Is he some kind of machine?

00:16:01.458 --> 00:16:04.083
All that's left now
is the landing!

00:16:06.917 --> 00:16:08.792

A layout double double.

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:11.917

And he does it!

00:16:12.959 --> 00:16:15.125
That was executed perfectly!

00:16:15.208 --> 00:16:17.291
An unbelievable routine.

00:16:17.375 --> 00:16:20.417
Those consecutive release skills
have high point values,

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.250
but the risk is equally high.

00:16:22.333 --> 00:16:25.583
He could have easily made
an error at any moment.

00:16:25.667 --> 00:16:27.583
To execute them
without hesitation

00:16:27.667 --> 00:16:29.875
requires not only
world-class technique

00:16:29.959 --> 00:16:32.834
but also extraordinary focus.

He edged ahead of Minamino
to claim first place!

00:20:04.709 --> 00:20:06.250
You know,
with the current rules,

00:20:06.333 --> 00:20:08.834
the highest skill level
classification is Super E,

00:20:08.917 --> 00:20:12.125
so difficulty can add three
tenths of a point at most.

00:20:12.208 --> 00:20:13.959
And yet, look at
the incredible moves

00:20:14.041 --> 00:20:15.750
that he chose to incorporate.

quadruple dismount,

which may be called
the Aragaki II.

00:20:20.041 --> 00:20:23.709
Those skills go well
beyond Super E difficulty.

00:20:23.792 --> 00:20:26.375
There were much easier ways
to get the points he needed,

00:20:26.458 --> 00:20:29.667

the risk for a reason.

perhaps the first step
on the road to a new era.

00:20:44.458 --> 00:20:47.208
light at the end of
that long tunnel.

00:20:47.291 --> 00:20:48.542
Jotaro Aragaki.

00:20:48.625 --> 00:20:49.792
The Samurai.

00:20:49.875 --> 00:20:51.917
Today, he showed
the people of Japan--

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.166
no, the people of the
world--who he really is!

00:21:07.959 --> 00:21:10.375
I know, Tetsu, but what
else could you expect

00:21:10.458 --> 00:21:13.291
from the only
gymnast you admire.

00:21:51.083 --> 00:21:52.291
'Kay, I gotta admit,

00:21:52.375 --> 00:21:54.083
his battlefield's a
little prettier than mine.

00:21:54.166 --> 00:21:57.250
Just wait. He'll be so surprised
when he finds out we came.

00:21:57.333 --> 00:21:58.250
No way.

00:21:58.333 --> 00:21:59.959
He never doubted that we would.

00:22:07.333 --> 00:22:10.792

00:22:12.208 --> 00:22:14.000
