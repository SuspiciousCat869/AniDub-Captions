so I'd like to come along

162
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,916
and make sure that all is well,
but unfortunately,

163
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,166
we still have to sell off
the Brewers' stuff.

164
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,291
So we're goin' to the
Teiwaz branch on Dort 6.

165
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,541
Don't let me down, all right?

166
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,250
Just leave it to us.

167
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,375
Well, remember not to mess
around with Gjallarhorn

168
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:26,875
while you're down there.

169
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:29,000
Keep your eyes open
around those guys.

170
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:31,083
'Cause the soldiers they've
got are much better trained

171
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,583
and far more motivated

172
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:34,833
than the ones in the Outer
Spheres like Mars or Jupiter.

173
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:36,375
Huh...

174
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:38,833
Come on. We're not gonna know
anything until we fight 'em.

175
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:41,541
[AMIDA]
You really don't get it, do you?

176
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:43,875
We're inside the
Earth Sphere now.

177
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:48,250
In the Outer Spheres you're used
to, they're basically no rules.

178
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:51,541
But law and order are
strictly enforced out here.

179
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:54,666
If you kill someone, you'll
be charged and punished.

180
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,291
[NAZE] Teiwaz may be respected
in the Outer Spheres,

181
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:58,916
but on Earth, it's no different

182
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,875
than any run-of-the-mill
corporation.

183
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,541
So if you don't
wanna be crushed,

184
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,500
then I would suggest you
behave yourselves.

185
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:09,541
Got it? Don't cause
any trouble out there.

186
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:13,791
[EIN]
They're at the Dort colonies?

187
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,291
[GAELIO]
Yeah.

188
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,916
Apparently, they got a call from
the Mustache Man on watch.

189
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,125
Now I'll finally get my
chance to settle things

190
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:21,291
with those brats.

191
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,666
But, sir, are we allowed
to deploy ships

192
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,666
without receiving prior orders?

193
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,916
We're just using
them for a drill.

194
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,708
I don't see any problem with it.

195
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:31,708
Besides, we won't have
any other missions

196
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:35,208
while McGillis is off
on vacation anyway.

197
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:38,083
It's a chance to get
revenge for your superiors.

198
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:39,416
Get ready.

199
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:41,708
Sir.

200
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,791
[ATRA] Oh! I'm really
looking forward to this.

201
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,208
[KUDELIA]
Me, too.

202
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:50,125
[ATRA] Oh, can we withdraw
money when we get there?

203
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,708
Teiwaz has an affiliated bank

204
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,083
so I think you guys
should be just fine.

205
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:56,041
[ATRA]
Awesome!

206
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:59,208
[FUMITAN]
Why? Why did I...?

207
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:04,666
They're fine. The launch is
safely in route to Dort 3.

208
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,916
Thanks a lot. For helping
us out with this, I mean.

209
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,708
Of course.

210
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,416
All right, let's get movin'!

211
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,375
Contact the
controller for Dort 2.

212
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:14,750
[beeping]

213
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:15,625
What is it?

214
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,833
It looks like another ship.

215
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:18,666
A what?

216
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,166
It's getting closer.

217
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,666
[UNION MEMBER A]
You're Tekkadan, right?

218
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,958
Welcome to Dort 2. We're happy
to have you as our guests.

219
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,791
Please follow our guide.

220
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,833
[ORGA]
Hold on. Do you know us?

221
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:29,916
[UNION MEMBER A]
Of course.

222
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,833
We've been anticipating
your arrival.

223
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,333
And we're looking
forward to seeing

224
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:36,041
all the young heroes
face-to-face.

225
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:36,916
Heroes?

226
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,166
What's that about?

227
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:42,375
All right, then. Guide us in.

228
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,250
[UNION MEMBER A]
So you're really Tekkadan!

229
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:48,375
[ORGA]
Uh, yeah.

230
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:49,958
I'm kinda surprised.

231
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,625
You're a lot younger
than I thought you'd be.

232
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:52,791
You're only kids.

233
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,041
[EUGENE]
What about it?

234
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,500
Don't underestimate us
just 'cause we're young.

235
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,375
Please don't get the wrong idea.

236
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,791
Can't tell ya how much we were
looking forward to your arrival

237
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:03,000
and finally getting to
meet you in person.

238
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,750
[UNION MEMBER C] Wait, are
you Kudelia Aina Bernstine?

239
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,666
Huh? No, I'm afraid
I'm not. Sorry, uh--

240
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:12,083
Kudelia's gone to a different
colony for other matters.

241
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,083
She won't be here.

242
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,541
Oh, really? Ah, that's too bad.

243
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,833
I did think you looked
old for a teenager.

244
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:19,000
[MERRIBIT]
Uh. Old?

245
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:21,083
[SHINO] Wait, you know
about Kudelia too?

246
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,833
Oh yeah, of course we do.

247
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,375
Well, I-I mean, after all,

248
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:27,166
she is the Maiden of Revolution
for the Mars movement.

249
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,416
She's the star of hope
for all of us workers

250
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,833
in the Earth Sphere.

251
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,375
[UNION MEMBER B] Just like
the young band of knights

252
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,500
who're so bravely protecting
her on her journey to Earth.

253
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,208
What's a "band of knights"?

254
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:38,458
Beats me.

255
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:41,000
Is it just me, or is
this a little weird?

256
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,458
Thanks so much for coming.

257
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:44,416
We wanna welcome you
all to Dort 2.

258
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,708
Yeah, thanks for
the hospitality.

259
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,708
With your permission,
would it be all right

260
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,000
if we begin unloading our cargo?

261
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,041
Sure, go right ahead.

262
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,666
Now listen up, guys.

263
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:58,083
You understand that this is our
first job as members of Teiwaz

264
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,791
so let's some
kick some ass!

265
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,333
[GROUP]
Yeah!

266
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:09,875
[BISCUIT] This is what
you meant by shopping?

267
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:11,375
[KUDELIA]
Let me ask you two a question.

268
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:14,500
When was the last time any
of you washed properly?

269
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:15,875
Do you remember?

270
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:18,708
Uh, I think it was maybe...
four or five days ago.

271
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,416
Ew!

272
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,375
To be honest, I've
been kinda concerned.

273
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:26,791
Inside the ship, there's
a very distinct odor.

274
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:29,791
[ATRA] Now that you
mention it, it does stink.

275
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,750
When everyone's together,
sometimes I gag a little.

276
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:33,750
[MIKAZUKI]
Uh...

277
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,250
[BISCUIT]
Do we smell that bad?

278
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:36,458
[ATRA]
You really do.

279
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:39,125
In fact, when I go
near Mr. Yukinojo,

280
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:40,958
it totally makes
my eyes burn.

281
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:43,208
[KUDELIA]
Hygiene is very important.

282
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:47,000
So let's buy detergent, cleaning
tools, and clothes for everyone.

283
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,125
How about we clean up
around the ship, too?

284
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:52,166
[ATRA] Okay, count me in.
I'd be glad to help!

285
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:57,875
So, what're you lookin' at?

286
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,666
Huh? Well...

287
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,333
When I was a little kid,

288
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:03,708
it was always a dream
of mine to come here.

289
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:05,166
What are you talkin' about?

290
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,416
Well, I've never
told anyone this,

291
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,916
but I'm actually from these
colonies originally.

292
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,500
[MIKAZUKI]
Huh?

293
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:15,500
[BISCUIT] But it wasn't here.
I lived in the slums of Dort 2.

294
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,708
Mom and Dad used to break
their backs in the factories

295
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,125
day and night.

296
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,375
Guess you could say
we were kinda poor.

297
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:22,916
Even in the Earth Sphere,

298
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,125
our life was the same as the
people who lived down on Mars.

299
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:28,958
[UNION MEMBER A] Only a
small handful of the people

300
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,750
who transferred from
Earth have any real money.

301
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,750
Those of us born and
raised in the colonies

302
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,208
might as well be
expendable tools.

303
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,958
We're made to work
for next to nothin'.

304
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,250
And if we ever get injured
and slow down a little,

305
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,458
we get the boot.

306
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:45,208
And we don't get
any insurance, either.

307
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,250
So we can't afford to get sick.

308
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:48,750
[UNION MEMBER A]
While the people on Earth

309
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:51,541
lead their fancy lifestyles
and suck up all the profits.

310
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:54,541
We've been enduring this
injustice for decades now.

311
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,250
So you're nothin'
but expendable tools...

312
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:58,791
Sounds a lot like
the time we spent

313
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:00,583
back in the CGS, doesn't it?

314
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:03,166
No matter what planet
you're on, it's the same.

315
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,333
The pompous ones are
always scum bags.

316
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:07,458
Then, a ray of hope came
out of the darkness

317
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,750
and shone down upon
each one of us.

318
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,666
We heard about
Kudelia Aina Bernstein

319
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,666
and the incredible things
she's been doing.

320
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,708
[ALL gasp]

321
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,416
A young woman who's
not only leading

322
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,000
the Mars independence movement,

323
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:19,958
but also influenced
a powerful magnate

324
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:21,458
of Earth's economic bloc.

325
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:24,291
Could there be anything
more exciting than that?

326
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:27,333
Because of her, we realized
that if we rise up,

327
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:29,416
we can change this world.

328
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,833
[UNION MEMBER B]
Then we were surprised to hear

329
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:32,958
that the ones who are
escorting her to Earth

330
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:36,291
are a group of young men
who're still in their teens.

331
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,583
So that means...

332
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,500
We're the "band of
knights," bro!

333
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:40,833
[UNION MEMBER B]
That's right.

334
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:43,166
There's Miss Kudelia,
the Maiden of Revolution,

335
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,333
and Tekkadan,
who fight to protect her.

336
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:48,708
You guys are a symbol
of hope to all of us.

337
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:52,166
[EUGENE] I see. Guess that
explains the warm welcome.

338
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,375
[SHINO]
Hope, huh?

339
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:55,750
Heh. I could get used to this.

340
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:58,833
In any case, I find it
more than a little strange

341
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:00,333
that a new company
like Tekkadan's

342
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:03,166
already known all
the way out here.

343
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,583
How'd you find out about
us in the first place?

344
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,291
Oh, our supporter told us.

345
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:08,791
Who might that be?

346
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,583
[RIDE] Hey, Boss, I finished
unloading everything.

347
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:14,208
Good work. Now go ahead
and get back to the ship.

348
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:15,708
[RIDE]
Will do.

349
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,416
Can you please confirm that
all cargo is accounted for?

350
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,750
Okay, I'd be glad to.

351
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,541
[MIKAZUKI] You've got an
older brother, Biscuit?

352
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:22,333
[ATRA]
Huh?

353
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:23,291
[BISCUIT]
Yeah.

354
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:24,500
But it's been a long time

355
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:26,458
since the two of us
have seen each other.

356
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:29,333
Back when our mom and dad
got into an accident and died,

357
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:32,000
Cookie, Cracker, and I were
adopted by our grandmother,

358
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:34,375
and went to go live
with her on Mars.

359
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:35,791
My big brother was
going to school

360
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,958
when all of this happened.

361
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:41,416
He was smart and taken in
by a company executive.

362
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:46,500
We haven't kept in touch since.
Wonder if he's still in Dort 3.

363
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,291
Why don't you try
givin' him a call?

364
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:49,916
Uhh...

365
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,583
Yeah, but if I were to call him
up all of a sudden like that,

366
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:54,083
it might freak him
out, you know?

367
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:55,875
Now stop making excuses!

368
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:57,208
Huh?

369
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,833
[ATRA] You need to let him
know that you're here!

370
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:03,000
He's your big brother. I'm sure
he wants to see you again too.

371
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,291
A-Atra...

372
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,833
[KUDELIA]
I think she's right.

373
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:09,375
If you don't at least try to
see him before we leave here,

374
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:11,666
you might end up regretting it.

375
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:16,041
[ATRA]
Like Mr. Akihiro.

376
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,791
I'm sure he wishes
he could've spent

377
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,583
more time with his brother.

378
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,916
Please contact him.

379
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,166
All right?

380
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,916
[phone ringing]


381
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,583
[SAVARIN]
What is it?

382
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,125
[SUBORDINATE A] We just
received a call for you.

383
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,125
Somebody saying
he's your brother.

384
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:39,958
My brother?

385
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,083
Put him through.

386
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:45,041
[BISCUIT]
Um, hey, Savarin?

387
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:47,625
I-It's me, Biscuit.

388
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:50,458
You're kidding.
Is it really you, Biscuit?

389
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,125
[BISCUIT]
Y-Yeah. That's right.

390
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:55,750
I'm working for an organization
called Tekkadan now.

391
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:56,625
[SAVARIN]
Tekkadan?

392
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:57,875
[BISCUIT]
Um, Yeah.

393
00:16:57,958 --> 00:16:59,750
And I'm actually
out here on Dort 3

394
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,708
taking care of some business.

395
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:04,750
So, uh... if it's not
too much trouble,

396
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:07,416
could we maybe meet
up for a little while?

397
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,333
Savarin, you still there?

398
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:12,875
[SAVARIN]
Uh. Uh...

399
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:15,541
I'm sorry. I was just surprised
because this is so sudden.

400
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:16,958
How 'bout this?

401
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:19,250
[BISCUIT]
Mh-hm. Mh-hm.

402
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:20,833
Okay, I got it.

403
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,625
I'll see you later then.

404
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,166
He agreed to meet with me.

405
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,916
[ATRA]
Oh, that's great!

406
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
[BISCUIT]
Mh-hm.

407
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,666
You don't seem very
happy about it.

408
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,000
No, I'm happy. It's just...

409
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:38,208
The two of us live in
such different worlds now.

410
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,500
I'm not sure how
to talk to him.

411
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:43,208
I'm sorry. Hope I didn't
cause you any trouble.

412
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:47,583
No, not at all. I'm probably
thinking about it too much.

413
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,000
[ATRA]
Want me to come along?

414
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,500
Huh?

415
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:51,708
[ATRA] Wouldn't that make things
easier for the two of you

416
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:52,625
if I'm there?

417
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:54,250
Uh, well, maybe, but...

418
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,208
Mm! Okay, let's do it.

419
00:17:56,291 --> 00:18:00,083
That way it might not feel
quite as awkward... Oh...

420
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:01,000
[KUDELIA]
Hm?

421
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,833
[ATRA]
I'm sorry, Miss Kudelia.

422
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,666
Would you mind if I left the
rest of the shopping to you?

423
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,333
Uh. No, of course not.

424
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:11,666
[UNION MEMBERS gasping]

425

[UNION MEMBER A] After all this
time, it's finally gonna start.

426
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,750
[UNION MEMBER B]
I can't wait.

427
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:19,291
Our years of endurance
are finally paying off.

428
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,250
[EUGENE]
Hey, isn't that...?

429
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,625
A Mobile Worker?

430
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,291
What's going on here?

431
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,875
This was the cargo
we were transporting?

432
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:29,916
[MERRIBIT] Uh, I-I thought it
was only industrial supplies.

433
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,500
[UNION MEMBER C]
Whoa! Amazing!

434
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:34,500
This is even more
than I expected.

435
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,250
[SHINO]
Okay, this is crazy.

436
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,583
Why didn't they tell us
about this stuff?

437
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,458
[MERRIBIT]
I'll check the order form.

Hey, what're you guys
plannin' to do here?

439
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:44,416
[UNION MEMBER B]
Hm?

440
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,916
Haven't you heard?

441
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,291
Surely our supporter told you
that we needed your help.

442
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,750
I mean, that's why you brought
us all this firepower, isn't it?

443
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:53,208
Supporter? We were only
doing what we were--

444
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:55,416
Nobody said anything
about weapons!

445
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,833
Who have you been talkin' to?

446
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:58,541
I-I don't know the name.

447
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:01,333
They just told us they
were Kudelia's proxy.

448
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:02,958
What?

449
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,750
[UNION MEMBER A] They said
she's ready to get going

450
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,250
and start a rebellion.

451
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,375
Not just on Mars
as we once thought,

452
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,208
but in every other sphere, too!

453
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:11,541
[UNION MEMBER B]
Then we were assured

454
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,541
that all of the necessary
arms and ammo we'd need

455
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:17,333
to help see it through would be
provided by her via Tekkadan.

456
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:18,833
Doesn't make any sense.

457
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,708
I've got a bad
feeling about this.

both hands so we can see 'em!

I don't want your excuses!
