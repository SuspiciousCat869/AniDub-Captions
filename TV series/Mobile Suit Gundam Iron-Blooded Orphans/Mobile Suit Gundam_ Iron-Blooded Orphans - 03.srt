Now's not the time for
us to start fighting. Hm?

I mean we've all
got our opinions,

162
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,000
but we need to put our
differences aside

00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:08,041
and work together, all right?

164
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:09,708
Eh? Then that means...

Yeah. I decided to stay.

So are you gonna stick
around, Old Man?

170
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,416
Yeah. Well, I'm
getting older,

Mikazuki around here?

[YUKINOJO]
No. Not sure where he is.

[ORGA]
What?

183
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,458
[KUDELIA] Mikazuki controlled
that thing like it was

part of his own body.

185
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:06,083
He must've trained
for years to do that.

186
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:09,875
[ORGA] Nah... That was
his very first time.

00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:11,375
What?!

188
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,500
And he was still able to fight
those machines like that?

189
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:16,458
Well, I've been told the
Alaya-Vijnana System

190
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:20,041
was originally made to
be used in Mobile Suits.

191
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,875
Must be easier to
operate instinctively

192
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:24,458
than a Mobile Worker.

What're you gonna do, now?

196
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:33,458
I can't go back. Not to Father.

197
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,083
So, what then?

'Cause before... I thought that
I could make a difference.

Well, I feel as strongly
as I ever did.

But, to do what
I know is right...

205
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,708
More innocent lives
may have to be taken

206
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:57,583
and I don't know
if I can handle it.

207

So you think the death of my

It's nothing like that, at all.

212
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:17,916

'Cause I feel so powerless.

[DEXTER]
Of the remaining assets,

214
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:22,333
it appears that Maruba
ran off with the majority

215
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:23,875
of the cash, already.

216

Adding what we were able to
salvage on the battlefield

217
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,666
and then calculating
the total amount that

218
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,916
we're to receive into
the overall budget...

219
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,791
I've never seen so much money!

220
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,791
Look. There're plenty
of companies who have

221
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:36,916
this kinda cash,
you idiot!

222
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,291
[DEXTER]
There's more.

223
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,791
From the total, we then
subtract the severance pay,

224
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,333
Mobile Worker repair,
and maintenance costs,

225
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:46,791
and from that we get a
new total which becomes...

Even if we all try
to cut corners...

You'd have about three months

00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:59,875
Well, the young miss said
it herself and I believe her.

314
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:01,708
That lady is one smooth talker.

315
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,208
I'm not gonna do that.

--[BISCUIT gasps]
--[TODO] What?

317
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:08,416
[ORGA] As far as I'm concerned,
we have no reason to trust him.

318
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,916
So, I won't give
in to his demands.

319
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,708
Mika!

320
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:12,875
[MIKAZUKI]
Hm?

321
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,958
[ORGA]
You up for it?

322
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:16,250
[MIKAZUKI]
Yeah, sure.

323
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,791
[EUGENE] Hey, wait!
What's goin' on here?

324
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,583
He knows what I meant.

325
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:22,458
He's gonna fight him...

326
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,000
...to the death.

327
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:31,541
[ORGA]
Uh... Sorry about the wait.

328
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:34,541
We've agreed to accept
your challenge.

329
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:37,041
All right...

330
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,458
[YUKINOJO] System optimization
should've eased the shock,

331
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,833
so that should make
things a little smoother.

332
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:43,375
Just don't push it.

333
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:45,041
[KUDELIA] What do you think
would happen if I were to try

334
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:47,208
using the Alaya Vijnana System?

335
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:50,375
Would I be able to control
it any way I wanted?

336
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:52,750
Cause if I can make it work,

337
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:54,125
at least I could
be of some help.

338
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:55,166
[ORGA]
Don't even bother.

[gasps]

340
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,833
Some of us were
just lucky, I guess.

341
00:14:58,916 --> 00:14:59,708
[KUDELIA]
Huh?

342
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:02,208
Long time ago, Mika, me,

343
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:05,958
and eight other kids
had them implanted.

344
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,875
It didn't work on four of them,

345
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:09,458
so they sent 'em
to the hospital.

346
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:10,875
[gasps]

347
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:14,500
[ORGA] Even to this day,
they're probably still in there.

348
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,000
If they're alive, that is.

349
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,333
[KUDELIA gasps]

350
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,166
[ORGA] Mika's had it
done three times, now.

351
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,666
Which is a lot,
for surgery like that.

352
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,958
And each one, was of
his own free will

00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,166
The name's Crank Zent.

[MIKAZUKI] Huh? Oh yeah, uh...
CGS Third Group.

358
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,958
My name's Mikazuki Augus.

00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,500
Come on.

360
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,416
[MIKAZUKI] How do we
decide who the winner is?

361
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,916
Are we gonna battle
to the end?

362
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,166
[CRANK]
There's no need for that.

363
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,833
[CRANK]
What Coral wanted--No.

364
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:33,750
What we wanted was to
take Kudelia's life.

365
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:36,333
But, I never wanted to
see innocent children

366
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:38,041
victimized like this!

367
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:40,458
You've already
killed so many...

00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:42,541

It's too late for that now.

[gasps]

371
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:46,583
[MIKAZUKI] Orga told me
exactly what I need to do.

372
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:49,041
And now I'm ready
to take you down!

373
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:57,916
[ORGA] If he wants to
stay alive out here,

374
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,125
Mika knows that
he's got to be tough.

375
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:06,791
Yes, of course.
But why all the surgeries?

376
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:09,958
He's rough around the edges,
but the kid has heart.

377
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:12,333
He's a real contradiction.

378
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:16,041
He's strong. That must be why.

379
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:19,666
It's incredible...
What he can do.

380
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:23,458
You think I'll be able
to fight like he does?

381

[ORGA]
You?

382
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,375
[KUDELIA] I'm not talking
about having surgery

383
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:29,291
and going out onto
the battlefield.

384
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,250
That's not the place for me.

385
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:34,541
I can do my fighting
another way.

Just so we're clear,

and to help all of my comrades.

That's gonna be our new name.

Such a young fighter.
How did he do it?

413
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:24,166
[MIKAZUKI] Hey. What happens
if I'm the winner?

414
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,416
I don't think we ever
talked about that.

415
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,166
I didn't like it.

I'm sorry.

You're a warrior, I know.

419
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,500
But when I left, losing
wasn't an option. That's all.

420
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:44,416
And... I disobeyed a
superior officer.

421
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,375
If I go back empty-handed now,

422
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:51,916
all of the troops will
pay for my actions.

423
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,416
But then, if I die battling you,

424
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,458
then all the responsibility
can go down with me.

You see, son,

00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,166
I can't bring myself

Hey, c'mon. Who cares? He won.

That's not what we're
talking about.

Maybe if we'd
tried to negotiate,

00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:57,041
we would've actually ended
up with a little money.

Then you'll have some money.
