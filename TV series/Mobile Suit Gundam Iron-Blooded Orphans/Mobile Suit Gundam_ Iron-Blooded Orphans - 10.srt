Ok, that shouldn't be a problem.

154
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,916
What is, are the other
scoundrels in our line of work.

155
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,083
Exactly.

I don't follow.

157
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,291
[AMIDA] The path around
the Ariadne Network

158
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,708
is effective for
avoiding Gallerhorn.

159
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,416
But, there are pirates who're
known to prey on ships

passing through there.

161

[NAZE] The Turbines are known
for being a militant group,

162
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:53,458
So, unless they're
some kinda daredevils,

163
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:56,166
I doubt anyone else would
pick a fight with us.

Okay, we're all done here.

[RIDE] Hey, hold on.
Where are you goin'?

166
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,333
[TAKAKI] The simulator.
I wanna get some training in.

167
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:15,041
We might be asked to work
outside one of these days.

168
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:18,416

way too much energy.

[NAZE]
Oh, that's right.

170
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,750
We left Saisei in such a hurry,
that I forgot to tell you.

171
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:25,458
We've decided to station a
representative from Teiwaz

Yeah. Serving as an

I thought becoming blood

[NAZE]
Don't jump to conclusions.

180
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,750
We need a liaison for both

Anyway, she's a pretty
versatile woman to have around.

[MERRIBIT] Nice to meet you.
My name's Merribit Stapleton.

186
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:56,750
She used to work in
the banking division

of the Teiwaz organization.

188

When it comes to business,
she's the best there is.

Lucky you. You're inexperienced
in that department, am I right?

00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,625
She can teach you
everything you'll need.

Yeah. I bet.

There's nothing but guys here.
Might be a bad idea.

Huh? You two already
know each other?

00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,083
Yes. I met him a few
days ago on <i>Saisei</i> .

Well, then. That makes

This is a great ship.

run by children.

Oh, by the way.
About your handkerchief...

247
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,250
So you did remember
after all.

248
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:20,666
Sorry. I kind of lost it.
I was pretty wasted then.

Please, don't worry about it.

Wasn't expecting to see
it again, anyway.

why you were there that night?

No, of course not! It was a
coincidence that I was there.

it's your job. But remember,

Uh, yeah. Sure!

Don't be. Mikazuki was there.

And there were other ones, too.

Compared to the older

I was still young and small,

00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,125
so I took care of
all the chores.

Unfortunately, I wasn't really
that good at doing them well.

and I got scolded
for it every time.

292
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:22,083
I got bullied and
beat up a lot, too.

293
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,541
If I made a mistake,

294

they wouldn't give me
any food for days.

I couldn't sleep.

00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:16,416
And girls aren't
allowed in the CGS.

310
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,583
[ATRA ] I can work.
We're about the same age.

[door clatters]

314
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,208
This is all I got.

315
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:33,750
[HABA]
Hm?

316
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:36,125
[MIKAZUKI] I don't care what
it is, just sell me some food.

317
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:37,625
What's wrong?

318
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:41,291
It looks like she's too hungry
even to stand up anymore.

319
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,791
[HABA sighs]

320
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:51,083
[ATRA] He saved me.
Once the manager heard all

321
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:55,666
I'd been through, she hired
me right on the spot.

322
00:15:55,750 --> 00:16:00,125
After that, I started to help
make deliveries to CGS.

323
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:03,041
I'm here 'cause
Mikazuki saved me.

324
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:05,416
I have so much to
be grateful for.

325
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,375
I see. You went through
some hard times, huh?

326
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:11,458
No. It's not like that.
Ever since I met Mikazuki

327
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,916
and the others,
things have been great.

328
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,375
[KUDELIA] You know what, Atra?
I'm kinda jealous of you.

329
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:19,041
Huh?

330
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,833
[KUDELIA] You may not
have siblings or parents,

331
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:23,666
but you have an entire families'
worth of people you can trust,

332
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:27,083
and I know there're so many out
there who aren't as fortunate.

333
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:31,375
I have parents, but I don't feel
that I can trust them at all.

334
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:34,250
In fact, my father
hates everything I do.

335
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:35,250
And wants me dead.

336
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:36,583

[whimpers]

338
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,416
Sometimes I...

339
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,000
[ATRA]
Excuse me, but... Um...

340
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,958
Maybe it's a misunderstanding.

341
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:50,291
I-It has to be, right? I mean,
a father wouldn't do that.

342
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:53,291
They're supposed to love their
daughters, no matter what.

343
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:55,750
When Mr. Ivan, who lived
next to me, had a daughter,

344
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:59,083
she was all he could talk
about for months at a time.

345
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:02,208
I-I'll just shut up. Sorry.

346
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:04,083
I-I don't know even
what I'm saying.

347
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:07,250
[KUDELIA sobs]
It's fine.

348
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:09,291
Don't worry.

Kudelia?

00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:13,625
Please don't forget that you're
one of our friends, too.

351
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,833
You're part of our family now.

352
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:19,250
Seriously? You mean that?

354
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,666
Oh?

355

[KUDELIA] Thank you.
That makes me very happy.

Wait.

part of the same family.

That means...!

Oh, wow! We could be
just like the Turbines!

Yes! That way everyone
gets what they want!

do our best, Kudelia!

faster than usual.

00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,083
Wanna go another round?

[AKIHIRO] No... I can't.
It's almost time for my patrol.

371
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:20,500
[LAFTER] Bummer. Wait... Are you
sure everything's all right?

372
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:21,333
[AKIHIRO]
Hm?

373
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:22,541
You were so different.

374
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:24,625
I've never seen
you fight like that.

375
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:26,875
It was a lot less
reckless and suicidal,

376
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:28,916
but still pretty persistent.

377
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,291
Well... Keep it up, Akihiro.

378
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,625
[AKIHIRO grunts]
Right.

379
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:39,416
[AKIHIRO]
I changed, huh?

[FUMITAN] Please come
in from the cargo hatch.

381

Your patrol duties will
be starting in 15 minutes.

Roger that.

383
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,250
Hey, Akihiro, are you
about to go on patrol?

384
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,500
[AKIHIRO]
Yeah.

385
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:57,958
Awesome. Would you mind
if I tagged along, too?

386
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:00,000
I've been hittin' the
simulator pretty hard.

387
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:02,125
I won't be any trouble.
I promise.

388
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:05,125

are better than one out there.

What's goin' on?

392
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:20,083
[TAKAKI]
I got a message from my sister.

393
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,166
See, I've always
had this dream about

394
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,541
letting her go off
to school some day.

395
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:28,375
So, I want to learn
a few other jobs.

396
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:31,250
And, if I can do that,
I can make more money .

397
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:35,375
I really want to work hard
for her. I-I'm sorry.

398
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:36,958
[AKIHIRO]
Hm. What?

399
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:39,375
You can't talk about your
family to Human Debris?

400
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:40,666
[TAKAKI]
Uh, no. I just...

401
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,041
Forget about it.

402
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,125
I could see you were tryin'
hard for your sister.

403
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:46,291
Nothing wrong with that.

404
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:51,000
You know. I've never told
anyone about this, but...

405
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:53,333
...I had a younger brother.

406
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:55,125
Are you serious?

407
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:57,291
[AKIHIRO]
His name was Masahiro.

408
00:19:57,375 --> 00:20:00,541
We were part of a family that
owned a merchant ship fleet.

409
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:04,125
And we used to travel between
spheres for weeks at a time.

410
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:07,541
Here you are.

411
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:08,916
[AKIHIRO grunts]

412
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,791
You too, huh?

413
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:10,666
[MASAHIRO]
Yeah!

414
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,041
Okay. Try your hand at this one.

Don't push yourself
too hard, Masahiro.

419
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:24,083
Hey, don't laugh at me!
It isn't funny!

420
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,625
Ah! I'm not gonna fall behind!

421
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:29,166
[AKIHIRO]
Then one day...

422
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:34,208
[gunshots]

423
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:37,708
[AKIHIRO]
We were hit by pirates.

424
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:42,250
All the adults were killed,
Including our parents.

425

[MASAHIRO, AKIHIRO whimper]

426
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:48,666
[AKIHIRO] After that, we were
treated as Human Debris.

427
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,333
We were separated
and sold for dirt cheap

428
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,291
to anyone who would take us.

429
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,791
Let go! Give him back to me!

430
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:59,291
Big Brother! Please, help me!

431
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:00,750
I'm gonna find you!

432
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,083
[PIRATE A]
Shut up.

433
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,458
[MASAHIRO]
Brother!

434
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:09,541
[AKIHIRO] Since that day,
I haven't seen any sign of him.

435
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:12,250
Then again, I've been
busy taking care of myself

436
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:16,458
all these years. Truth be told,
I'd forgotten all about him.

437
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,125
Now that I've joined Tekkadan,

438
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:21,250
they're just as important
as any brother to me.

439
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,125
But it makes me think.

440
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,791
I had a real family
of my own once.

441
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:29,791
If he's alive, he'd be about
as old as you, Takaki.

442
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:31,041
No kidding.

443
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:33,291
[AKIHIRO] But, he's probably
long gone now.

444
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,416
[gasps]
Don't say that, Akihiro.

445
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,208
I'm sure if you keep
going down this path,

446
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:38,958
you'll see him again.

447
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:41,666
I hope you're
right about that.

448
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:44,875
Well. I think we've
come far enough.

449
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:45,916
Let's go home.

450
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,541

Sounds good.

[FUMITAN]
Communication from our Graze.

463

by unknown fighters.

00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:17,583
Three have been spotted.

465
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:20,125
[grunts] You've gotta be
kidding me. Distance?

466
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:21,833
[BISCUIT]
About 1,600.

467
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:29,458
[growls]
Crap!

468
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:34,125
[grunts]

469
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:36,291
Takaki. What?

470
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,416
[gasps]

471
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:49,750
Whoa...

Mikazuki...

00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:12,000
[CHAD]
Yeah, I know. You're right.

477
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,958
The sleeve is completely frayed.

478
00:24:14,041 --> 00:24:16,250
But it's okay.
Just leave it like that.

479
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:18,833
Before I came here, all I
ever had were clothes

480
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:21,208
that were worn out,
ripped, or tattered,

481
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:24,041
so it feels better
when they're dirty.

482
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:25,958
What? Who am I?

483
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:28,375
I'm Chad! Chad Chadan!

484
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:31,000
You know, I'm always
on the bridge!
