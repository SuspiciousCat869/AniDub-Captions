No!

That's not bad at all.

These things are beasts.
Every one of them are equipped

with an unusually thick
amount of armor plating.

You're right. Where is he?

Who knows. He could
be up in his room.

just died after all.

A funeral?

00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,958
That's right. Where I am from,
it's the very old tradition.

224
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:26,541
It's the way my
colony honors the dead.

225
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:29,750
The ceremony allows
the soul to be free.

226
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,958
That way, it can be
safely reborn.

Sounds strange.

Apparently, funerals were
a fairly important tradition

00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,708
for much of Earth's history.

232
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,208
By going through
these ceremonies,

233
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,416
they say the soul of the dead
forgets the pain they had

234
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,708
when they were alive and move
into a state of total peace.

235
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,958
Is that true?

00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,083
I'm serious. If it were up
to me, I think we should.

forget their pain,

Well, if that's the case,
then we'll lend you a hand.

everyone else.

To be honest,
I don't really get it.

252
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:38,041
All that talk about the
soul being reborn...

We'll be able to see the dead
when its our turn to die.

This funeral is just
a waste of time.

We should be more concerned
about staying alive,

256
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,208
than worrying about
the after life.

are entitled to your opinion.

here accepts the deaths

of their friends
quite so easily.

These funerals... They're just
as much for the living.

262
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,125
It allows people to move on...

263
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:10,125
...and accept the absence
of those they've lost.

264

Mm?

So the souls of those

will go to where they belong.
And be reborn.
