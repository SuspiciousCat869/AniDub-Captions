handing that over--

157
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:31,083
[ORGA] It means you guys
don't belong to anybody now.

158
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:35,125
I'm not lookin' for gratitude,
so do whatever you want.

159
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:38,291
But, if you're stayin',
I'll protect ya'.

160
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:42,916
You will? You'd do that
for garbage like us?

161
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,708
[chuckles]

162
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,916
[ORGA]
'Course I would.

163
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,375
So you ready to make our mark?

164
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:53,458
We'll see.

00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,708
Hey! Let's do this.

166
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,083
[DANTE, CHAD]
Sure.

167
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,833
I think someone
needs to calm down.

168
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:01,208
It's just paperwork.

169
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,375
I managed to get
ahold of Orcus.

170
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:06,666
It took some doing, but he
agreed to guide us to Earth.

171
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,458
Yeah? How much do they want?

172
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:11,166
[TODO sighs] Forty-five percent
of what we're getting paid.

173
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,500
That's one hell of
a service charge.

174
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,666
We don't have much
of a choice, do we?

175
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,708
You've got to be kiddin' me!

176
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,458
Forty-five percent for
guide work's a rip off!

177
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:23,833
Todo, your sorry ass better
not be takin' a kick-back.

178
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:26,208
If you don't like it,
you handle negotiations.

179
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:27,625
What'd you say?

180
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,208
Now, now...

181
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:31,916
We still need to decide who's
gonna go to Earth with us.

182
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
[EUGENE] What's everyone
else supposed to do?

183
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:37,333
Orga and I talked it over.
We can still sell the stuff

184
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:39,833
from the battle. And there's
always the usual farming work

185
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:40,833
to float us--

186
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:42,166
I shoulda known
this would happen.

187
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,458
How boring...

188
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,708
I'm sorry, were you
expecting some excitement?

189
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:49,416
Legitimate jobs are
always dull. You know that.

190
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,791
[EUGENE]
Well, don't you think escorting

191
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,625
Kudelia will be kinda risky?

192
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:56,208
Yeah, but that's different.
After all, she's a celebrity.

193
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:58,583
If we can manage to
get her to Earth safely,

194
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,958
the Tekkadan name will
spread like wild fire.

195
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:03,291
Maybe it'll bring
in some more jobs,

196
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,250
We might be able to
lead a decent life

197
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,083
instead of
just scrapin' by.

198
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:10,125
There's definitely some risk
involved, but it's worth it.

199
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:13,375
But, we've got more ridin'
on this than money.

200
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:16,333
Our whole future
depends on it.

201
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:17,875
Think so, huh?

202
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:23,083
[TODO] Hmph. I wouldn't bank
on that future just yet, boy.

203
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,000
Yummy!

Hey, keep it down, Shino!

205
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:29,916
[SHINO]
Huh?

206
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,666
So, whatcha drawin'?

207
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,750
Wouldn't you like to know?

Come on. Show me.

Back off! It's a secret.

[TAKAKI]
You're so lame.

211
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:42,916
[RIDE]
Now, go bug someone else.

00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,750
Why aren't you eating, Miss?

'Cause I've realized how
weak I am... and helpless.

The funds you requested

215
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,916
have been wired to the
designated account.

00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,333
Please confirm it.

It's there. Thank you.

218
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,208
[NOBLISS]
My pleasure.

219
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,750
Though I must say,
I'm surprised.

220
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:03,916
Your decision was
not an easy one.

221
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,125
You're quite brave, my lady.

222
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,458
[KUDELIA]
You're too kind.

223
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,250
[NOBLISS]
Her young warriors in tow,

224
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,625
the war goddess rushed
into the jaws of death,

225
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:15,208
ready to build an eternal
paradise atop their corpses.

[gasps]

227

[NOBLISS] It's like a tale
from mythology, isn't it?

228
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:23,208
I knew my confidence in you
wasn't misplaced, my young hero.

Another bowl, please!

Those boys...

231
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:29,500
I'm afraid I'm gonna rob
them of their happiness.

232
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,500
[SHINO] Eat up! It'll put
some hair on your chest!

233
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:34,291
But despite that fear,
I still...

234
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:35,500
[MIKAZUKI]
You're lookin' upset again.

235
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:36,833
[KUDELIA]

236
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:40,583
Mikazuki. It's nothing...

237
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:43,583
I think I'm gonna go out
after I finish eating.

00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:45,500
Do you wanna tag
along with me?

00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:46,750
[KUDELIA]
Huh?

00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:52,166
[GAELIO] It doesn't get
more barren than this.

241
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,291
Is there a reason
we're in this dump?

242
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,750
Kudelia Aina Bernstein.

243
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:58,583
No one knows where she is now.

244
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,083
I know that name.

245
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:03,666
The one responsible for the
Noachis July Assembly?

246
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,541
[MCGILLIS] That's the one.
Just before we left Earth,

247
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,375
I heard rumors that she
was negotiating with

248
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,541
the Arbrau government
on her own.

249
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,500
[GAELIO]
What? I can't believe that.

250
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,333
Negotiating with Earth's
economic bloc

251
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:17,916
should be impossible for someone
who's from the Outer Sphere.

252
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:20,875
[GAELIO]
Hm?

00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,583
[GAELIO]
What am I looking at?

254
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:31,041
[MCGILLIS] I've received reports
that a battle took place here

255
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,833
a few days ago.

256
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:35,333
And, before that occurred,
Kudelia's father,

257
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:39,583
Norman Berstein went up and
paid our friend Coral a visit.

258
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:41,125
I see...

259
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:44,541
[gasps] You think Major Coral
had her targeted, don't you?

260
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:48,583
Then, that means the missing
company must have come out here.

261
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:51,750
Capturing her would put
them in some good graces.

262
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:55,083
Especially with the
Regulatory Bureau.

263
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:57,833
And our little inspection
wouldn't even make them

00:12:57,916 --> 00:12:59,541
break a sweat.

I'm not really sure.

It's something Orga

Look, why don't we just

It'd be a lot less boring.
