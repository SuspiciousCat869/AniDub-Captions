00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,250
But considering this situation,

158
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:25,500
can it wait until after
we leave the island?

159
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,250
Sure.

160
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,708
[ORGA]
Ever since we were kids...

161
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,208
[BISCUIT]
Hm?

162
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,291
...you never complained about
any of my reckless ideas.

163
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:33,666
Not even one time.

164
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,583
I did complain, actually,

165
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,875
but you just didn't
bother to listen to me.

166
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:43,208
[exhales] Well, maybe. Guess I
haven't grown up at all, huh?

167
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:46,500
Now, cause I'm being
hard headed, you want to leave?

168
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:48,875
Am I really such a bad guy?

169
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:54,208
[BISCUIT] Maybe we should
discuss this a little later.

170
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:57,166
We've got more urgent things
to deal with anyway.

171
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:01,208
[ORGA]
Alright. That's a promise.

172
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,125
[TEKKADAN MEMBER B]
Hand me the wrench.

173
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,500
[BISCUIT]
Old Man, How's it going?

174
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:12,166
[YUKINOJO] Hm? Hey!
We've got three ready so far.

175
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,791
But I should ask you
the same question?

176
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,333
Are you holding up all right?

177
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,791
[BISCUIT] Hey, even I can
operate a Mobile Worker.

178
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:21,083
You know what I mean.
You and Orga okay?

179
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,875
[BISCUIT]
Yeah it's fine now.

180
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:25,083
We've promised to talk
more about everything

181
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,958
after we leave the island.

182
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,458
[YUKINOJO]
Hm.

183
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:32,250
Glad to hear it.
Here, I'll help you put that on.

184
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:33,583
[gasps]

185
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:36,125
[MERRIBIT] So far it looks
like everything's ready.

186
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:39,583
[ORGA] I wanted to ask
Biscuit to stay in Tekkadan,

187
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:42,750
but I couldn't bring
myself to say it.

188
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:45,458
[BISCUIT] I just think that
if we want to survive,

189
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:47,541
we gotta keep thinking
one step ahead.

190
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,333
We have to.

191
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:51,583
Oh, "We" have to, huh?

192
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:54,000
Well, I'm happy to hear
you talking like that.

193
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,125
[gasps]

194
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:56,833
[YUKINOJO]
As far as Orga's concerned,

195
00:09:56,916 --> 00:10:00,125
I think he needs
someone like you around.

196
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,208
[MERRIBIT] I suppose even you
have a hard time telling him

197
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:03,958
what you're feeling.

198
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:05,125
[grunts]

199
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:11,833
[MERRIBIT] But, you still have
plenty of chances to say it.

200
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:13,375
[ORGA]
Guess you're right.

201
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:15,583
[OPERATOR A]
Captain Stenja.


202
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,708
It's past the deadline
for their surrender.


203
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:20,125
[CORLIS] Hmph. Well, well.
That's more like it.

204
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:23,125
At last. I can avenge
the death of my brother.

205
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:27,625
These space rats will rue the
day they crossed Corlis Stenja.

206
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:31,125
Attention all ships!
Commence the clean-up operation!

207
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:33,833
Glory to Lady
Carta's battlefield!

208
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:45,541
It's started.

209
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,041
You better Hurry, Mikazuki.

210
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,833
Right.

211
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:51,166
Is this really all
we've got left?

212
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,750
'Cause I'm not really
sure how to use it.

213
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:54,750
[gasps]

214
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:58,208
[MIKAZUKI]
Wait... That'll work.

215
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,583
Alright. Huh?

216
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:02,958
What is that?!

217
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:04,625
[MIKAZUKI] Found it next to
one of those containers.

218
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,125
[SHINO]
Woah!

219
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,333
[SHINO gasps]

220
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:11,000
[SHINO] A saturation
attack, huh? So typical.

221
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,041
[LAFTER] It's useless
against Mobile Suits.

222
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:21,000
I guess when you're rich, you
don't care about wasting ammo.

223
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:25,291
[ORGA] Akihiro, can you aim for
the ship from your position?

224
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:26,041
[AKIHIRO grunts]

225
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,208
[AKIHIRO]
I'll try.

226
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:32,791
What the...?!

227
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:34,541
[OPERATOR A] We're being
attacked by the Mobile Suits.

228
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:37,208
Those Martian space rats
think they know battle theory,

229
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:38,416
do they?!

230
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,958
Fine, then! send out
our Mobile Suits too.

231
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,250
[grunts]
I missed.

232
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:45,833
[LAFTER]
Aim it right, idiot.

233
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,791
Do you want Amida
to yell at you?

234
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,625
[AKIHIRO]
But... I, uh...

235
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,208
[ORGA] What in the hell are
they doing out there?

236
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:53,375
Biscuit! Move it!

237
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:54,958
[AKIHIRO] Hang on.
How am I supposed to--

238
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:58,500
[MIKAZUKI] Akihiro, you still
have that sensation, don't you?

239
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,458
[MIKAZUKI]
Just follow that and shoot.

240
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:02,666
[grunts]
Now I get it.

241
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:08,875
[CREW grunts]

242
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:10,916
There's a direct hit on
the starboard hangar block.

243
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,583
We're taking in water
from the impact area.

244
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,833
I want you to send in
the landing troops first.

245
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:17,500
Once it's finished,
all hands abandon ship.

246
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,333
Looks like he was able
to correct his aim

247
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:20,791
just by using his senses.

248
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:23,875
The Alaya-Vijnana?
That is so cheating.

249
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:26,583
[gasps]

250
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:27,666
[ORGA] The Mobile Suits
are coming this way.

251
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,958
[LAFTER giggles]

252
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,791
[ORGA] Try to get rid of them
while they're over the water.

253
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,208
[AZEE, LAFTER]
Roger that.

254
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,291
If they can keep this up,

255
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,416
they're not even
gonna need our help.

256
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:44,750
[SHINO]
The hell was that?!

257
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,458
Wait a minute.

258
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:47,750
Are those...?

259
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,875
Lafter and Azee, need you
to focus your fire

260
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:55,333
on the suits over the ocean.

261
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:56,416
[AZEE, LAFTER]
Got it!

262
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,750
Now, you guys take
care of the rest!

263
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:01,875
[SHINO] Oh, we're on it.
Come on, lets go!

264
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:06,291
You have gotta be kiddin' me!

265
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:11,791
[SHINO gasps]

266
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:19,541
[gasps]
Huh?

267
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:22,833
It's time for you to pay the
price for humiliating us!

268
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,875
[ORGA] Damn it, looks like
they got onto the island

269
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:27,375
a lot sooner than I
thought they would.

270
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,541
[CARTA] Remember!
We are the Outer Earth

271
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:35,083
Orbit Regulatory Joint Fleet!

272
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:37,458
[ROYAL GUARDS] We are
perseverance and fortitudeness!

273
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:38,666
[ROYAL GUARD A grunts]

274
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,291
[CARTA gasps]

275
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:43,166
[AKIHIRO]
It was okay to shoot, right?

276
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,458
[MIKAZUKI]
'Course it was.

277
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:47,916
Barbarian! Where are
your manners?!


278
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,458
[CARTA] It's judgment day
for these savages,

279
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:57,000
so dont show them any mercy!

280
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:59,541
[ROYAL GUARDS]
Iron-fisted punishment!

281
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:03,041
Spearhead Formation. Charge!

282
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,625
[ROYAL GUARDS]
Single point breakthrough!

283
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:10,333
[SHINO] Time for a
little target practice!

284
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,541
[CARTA]
Bring it on.

285
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:12,583
What the...?

Mikazuki!

288
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,916
[shouts]
I'm gonna squash you!

289
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,083
Huh?

290
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:22,250
[MIKAZUKI]
Hm...

00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:29,666
[gasps]

292
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,166
[ROYAL GUARD A] Lady Carta.
Our formation's been disrupted!

293
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,416
What have you done?!

00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,583
[ROYAL GUARD F grunts]

295
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,333
[SHINO]
Come on!

296
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:38,750
Unless you wanna die,
keep moving!

297
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:44,791

[grunts]

300
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,583
We're all using
an Alaya-Vijnana,

301
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,625
so you don't stand
a chance against us!

302
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,583
[ROYAL GUARD B]
I got you!

303
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:04,208
Didn't think Gjallarhorn would
be so easy to take down,

304
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:05,625
here on Earth!

What are you doing?!

307
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,208
Now, spread out and take them
down one by one if you have to!

308
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:15,750
[ROYAL GUARDS]
Y-Yes, ma'am!

309
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,666
Where are the naval forces?!

310
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,291
[ROYAL GUARD A] They're in
combat with unknown machines.

313
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:33,625
[LAFTER grunts]
They got through.

314
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,958
Akihiro, two coming your way!

315
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:42,375
Oh well, I didn't have
many shots left anyway.

316
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:45,250
But that's alright.

317
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,791
It doesn't matter!

318
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:50,333
[grunts]
It's too powerful!

319
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:56,583
This style suits me better!

320
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:01,833
[TAKAKI]
Well?

321
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,625
They're here. And it's a
bunch of landing troops,

322
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,416
just like boss said.

323
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,416
Let's see what we're
up against. Come on.

324
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,916
All right.

325
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,791
[ORGA] Mika and the others
are putting up a good fight.

326
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,958
[ORGA gasps]
We got company?

327
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,208
[TAKAKI]
Confirmed.

328
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,416
Landing troops just hit
the northeastern shore.

329
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,791
Heading towards
Makanai's place.

330
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,958
Figured as much. How many?

331
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,916
[TAKAKI] Six Mobile Workers
and about twenty soldiers.

332
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,708
[ORGA] Copy that. The two
of you can leave there now

333
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:30,291
and join up
with Kudelia. Got it?

334
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:31,708
[TAKAKI, RIDE]
Yes, sir.

335
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:34,000
Looks like you were right.
They've taken the bait.

336
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:35,875
As much as they hate our guts,

337
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,750
I just knew there'd be no
way they could ignore

338
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:41,458
Kudelia and Mr. Makanai.
And I figured they'd land here

339
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,958
if we made the back of
the island look weaker.

340
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:47,708
But, I didn't expect them
to drop forces from the sky.

341
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:50,500
Yeah, well things are still
going just like we planned

342
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,500
So far, so good. Heh.

--[explosions]
--[BISCUIT gasps]

344
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,666
[ORGA] All right, let's go
to the next phase.

345
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,916
[BISCUIT]
Got it.

346
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,833
Why hasn't the boss
called us yet?

347
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:06,708
There's way too
many of these guys!

348
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:09,250
Stop complaining and just shoot.

349
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:10,666
[ORGA]
You've all managed to hold on,

350
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,750
and we've lured
them in. Good job.

351

Now get the hell out of there!

[DIOS, GATT]
Yes, sir.

[CARTA]
I won't accept this.

The Issue family name
can't be tarnished!

355
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,416

[ROYAL GUARD B]
Lady Carta!

357
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,541
[ROYAL GUARD A] There's a
report that the landing troops

358
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,625
have taken control
of the target point.

359

[CARTA] Perfect! And where
is that girl, Kudelia?

360
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,375

Uh. They're still searching

What?

365
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:48,750
What happened?

366
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:49,958
[ROYAL GUARD A]
We uh...

367
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:52,583
We just lost contact
with the landing troops.

368
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,250
[GATT]
They're coming!

Now hit it, Boss!

370
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:03,750
[DIOS, GATT]
Yeah! All right!

[DIOS, GATT]
On our way!

373
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:10,250
Now all that's left are
those landing vessels.

374
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:13,791
Yeah, but... we still
have to stay on guard.

375
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,125
[RIDE]
I hope everyone's okay.

376
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,083
Come on, we're on
guard duty right now.

377
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:21,708
[RIDE]
I know that.

378
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:25,416
[MAKANAI] Interesting. They all
appear to be children,

379
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,458
but they're still
quite efficient.

380
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,708
I must admit, I'm impressed.

381
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:31,708
If we go off shore
aboard those vessels,

382
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:34,333
the arranged ship will
be waiting for us.

Let's go.

00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,583
[ORGA] How many more
enemy units are there?

385
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,541
[BISCUIT] The Ahab Wave
reactions indicate there are

386
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,541
five on Mikazuki's runway side,

387
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,500
and three more by Azee and
Lafter on the coastline.

[ORGA]
Those two should be just fine.

389

They've piloted Mobile

00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:54,166
longer than we have.

00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:07,208
Didn't Eco tell us not to get
seawater on these machines?

Well, guess I can't help it now.

going to get in trouble!

if we get rid of them,

00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,875
we can get everybody
off the island safely.
