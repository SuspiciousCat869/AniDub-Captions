principles when it
comes to finishing a job.

156
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:01,208
You think you have principles
when you're working

157
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:03,875
for that bloated coward?
Don't make me laugh.

158
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:06,250
Being seen as beneath
that sadistic bastard

159
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:07,916
makes my skin crawl.

160
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,291
All right, so what
are you gonna do?

161
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,458
If you want to think of
yourselves as grown-ups,

162
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:15,666
you need to face the
consequences of your actions.

163
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,916
[gasps]

164
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:23,041
I haven't changed my mind.
We can't accept your offer.

165
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:24,208
[NAZE]
Hm.

166
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,791
You might have your
way of doin' things,

167
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:28,875
But we have our own
sense of honor to protect.

168
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:31,500
[NAZE] So. You're saying
that you're willing

169
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:32,958
to fight against us?

170
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:35,625
That's right. And we'll prove
to you that we're more

171
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,500
than just a bunch of kids.

172
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,125
That goes for you too, Maruba.

173
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,333
Huh?

174
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,208
[ORGA] We lost a lot
of friends back there.

175
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,125
We're gonna make sure you
pay for each one of 'em.

176
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:45,333
Let's see ya try it!

177
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:46,666
Your loss, kid.

178
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,541
That arrogance of yours
is gonna cost you, dearly.

179
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:54,791
[NAZE] Sorry Amida.
Looks like you're up.


180
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:57,833
Well, it is a grown-up's job
to scold naughty children,

181
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:59,000
isn't it?

182
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:02,000
Uh-huh. You could
punish me any day, dear.

183
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,708
Tell Lafter she better wear
a normal suit this time.

184
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,208
[OPERATOR A]
Yes, ma'am.

185
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:10,041
Everybody prepare for battle!
Get to your stations, now.

186
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,250
Azee, I need you
to come with me.

187
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:14,875
[AZEE]
Yes, ma'am. Of course

188
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,791
[BISCUIT]
I told you to watch yourself!

189
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,833
There was still
room for negotiation!

190
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:21,000
[ORGA]
I'm well aware of that.

191
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:24,083
But I have no intention
of backing down.

192
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:25,291
[BISCUIT exhales]

193
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:27,500
[ORGA]
Those bastards on our six,

194
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:30,333
which gives us a chance to show
them Tekkadan's true power.

195
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:31,791
Are you with me or not?

196
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,083
[EUGENE]
You're damn right!

197
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:35,958
Hell yeah! Time to
show 'em how it's done.

198
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:39,416
We might not get another chance
to negotiate with Teiwaz,

199
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,458
so let's grab it!

200
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:41,125
Yes sir.

201
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,541
[EUGENE]
Right!

202
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,583
Confirming Ahab Wave reaction.

203
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,833
They've increased their speed
and are closing in fast!

204
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:49,041
[ORGA]
Okay! Stow away the bridge.

205
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:51,875
Now! Maintain speed
and turn one-eighty.

206
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,458
Prepare to exchange fire.

207
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:55,666
[CHAD] Yes, sir.
Stowing away the bridge.

208
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:01,541
[FUMITAN] This ship will
now engage in battle.

209
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,000
Deactivating artificial gravity.

210
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,041
[ATRA]
No! Wait a minute!

211
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,541
[ATRA gasps]

212
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:09,041
[FUMITAN] Everyone, prepare for
the turn in 120 seconds.

213
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:10,958
Akihiro, you got this?

214
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:11,916
[AKIHIRO]
Yeah. All right.

215
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,750
[ORGA]
Mika?

216
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:13,625
[MIKAZUKI]
I'm on it.

217
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,000
[ORGA]
I'm countin' on ya.

218
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:15,833
Outta the way.

00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,083
[KUDELIA grunts]
Oh, sorry.

220
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,416
You go too, Shino.

221
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,458
Yes! I'm ready!

222
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:21,458
[EUGENE]
I'll go too.

223
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,333
[ORGA]
No, Eugene. You stay put.

224
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:24,333
[EUGENE]
What?

225
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,750
[ORGA]
Take command of the ship.

226
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,750
'Cause you're the only one
I can trust to pull it off

227
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:31,416
[gasps]
Kay... If you insist.

228
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,291
[FUMITAN] Miss Kudelia,
please evacuate to the core.

229
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,750
I'll help you get into a normal
suit before you go down.

230
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,750
I guess I'll be in the
way if I stay here?

231
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:39,625
Huh?

232
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,958
It's fine. I'll go by myself.

233
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,958
You need to focus on
helping everyone, Fumitan.

234
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,625
[FUMITAN] If that's what
you want, I'll obey.

235
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,625
Please. Be careful, Miss.

236
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,250
[grunts]

237
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:52,791
[ORGA]
Sorry, Biscuit.

238
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,166
[BISCUIT]
No turning back, huh?

239
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,791
[ORGA] You got it.
I'm gonna need your help.

240
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:57,666
Sure thing.

241
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,791
[CHAD]
Turning 180 degrees!

242
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,500
[AZEE] I'll go first, ma'am.
Preparing to head out.

243
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:10,875
[AMIDA]
Right.

244
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,083
Azee Gurumin, launching!

245
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:15,833
[AMIDA]
They're going by the book.

246
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:18,083
They maintained their speed
while turning their ship to

247
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:22,208
face us directly. You've passed
the first test, kids.

248
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:25,416
Amida Arca, Hyakuren,
heading out!

249
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,583
[YUKINOJO]
Sorry about this, Mikazuki.

250
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:32,208
The reactor hasn't
been fine-tuned yet.

251
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:35,166
I really wish I didn't have
to send you out like this.

252
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,583
[MIKAZUKI] As long as
it moves, I can get by.

253
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:40,500
Try not to die out there.
I'd feel guilty.

254
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,541
I plan to live longer
than you, Old Man.

255
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:45,458
[chuckles]
Now don't get carried away.

256
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:48,291
Stay sharp, ya hear me?

257
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,791
Hey!

258
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:53,791
Once Akihiro's Graze is out,
we'll get Barbatos out too.

259

[MIKAZUKI gasps]

260
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,750
It's not just the reactor.

261
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:59,625
There's also a weird strain
on all the motors.

262
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:03,541
Well... we'll just
do what we can, right?

263
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:07,791
Mikazuki The target has deployed
Mobile Suits. Two so far.

264
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:09,750
Understood. Let's do this!

265
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:12,333
[YUKINOJO]
Okay! Bring down Barbatos.

Heh. Took you long enough.

Is that it?

Can't we evade their missiles?

280
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,208
[BISCUIT] If we don't maneuver
properly, they'll close in,

281
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:28,750
and then we'll be within range
of their Anti-ship Napalm.

even the Nanolaminate
armor will disintegrate!

287
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,250
We need to stay far enough
to still intercept them!

[ALL grunt]

289
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,625
Keeping our distance
isn't enough!

00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:49,208
[OPERATOR 0A] The enemy
is holding their course.

They're surprisingly
brave for children.

[NAZE]
Is this gonna take long?

293

Hey, why don't you get
Lofter to come out and play?

Yes sir.
