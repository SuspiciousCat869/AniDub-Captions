[KUDELIA gasps]

160
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:27,166
[ORGA]
So, are those children...?

161
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,583
[NAZE] Mm-hm... The product
of yours truly, of course.

162
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,291
Each from different mothers.

163
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:35,083
You're talking about stupid
things again, dear.

164
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,166
Back to business.

165
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,708
Oh, right. Apologies.

166
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:41,708
I've seen what you can do,
and I'm quite impressed.

167
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:44,500
So, what is it that you want?

168
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:45,708
[ORGA grunts]

169
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,208
[BISCUIT]
As we said before,

170
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:50,458
Miss Kudelia Aina Bernstine
hired us to be her escorts,

171
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:53,000
and expects all of us
to take her to Earth.

172
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,625
But to do that,
we need a guide

173
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:57,875
to secure a route and
guarantee safe passage.

174
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:00,583
We would like that
guide to be you, sir.

175
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,750
And one more thing...

176
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,291
If it's all right with you,

177
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:07,250
we'd like Tekkadan to become
a division of Teiwaz.

178
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:08,500
[NAZE]
Hm?

179
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,875
We've been targeted by
Gjallarhorn recently...

180
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:13,000
[NAZE] ...and with Teiwaz
as your backing support,

181
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:16,458
you would be able to fight back
if things went south, right?

182
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:17,291
[BISCUIT]
Yes, sir.

183
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:18,625
[NAZE]
Hm.

184
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:21,041
[ORGA grunts]

185
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:24,333
[NAZE chuckels]
Sure. Fine with me.

186
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,000
I'll discuss it
with the old man.

187
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,791
[EUGENE, BICUIT laugh]

188
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,291
We appreciate it.

189
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,833
Well, don't thank me;
you're not in just yet.

190
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,541
I'm only making
the introductions.

191
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:36,250
You can negotiate with
the old man, yourselves.

192
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:39,166
Then, it'll all be up to you.

193
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,916
Fair enough.

194
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,750
[KUDELIA] We'll be negotiating
with your father, Mr. Naze?

195
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,333
What? No, I didn't mean that.

196
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:49,416
Obviously. He means
McMurdo Barriston,

197
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,875
the boss of Teiwaz.

198
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,666
By the way, you mentioned
speaking with him.

199
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,750
Something about Miss Kudelia.

200
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:58,250
I believe you said
she was property?

201
00:09:58,333 --> 00:09:59,458
[NAZE grunts]

202
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:02,541
I'm not really sure
how to answer that.

203
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:05,750
Gjallarhorn. What do you
know about them, exactly?

204
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:08,125
What most people know, I guess.

205
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,666
They're military.
Pretty powerful, too.

206
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,583
That's all I really
know about 'em.

207
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:16,125
Three hundred years ago,
they ended the Calamity War.

208
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,833
After that, they used their
immense military power to

209
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:21,833
prevent further war and have
kept an independent eye on the

210
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:26,500
four economic blocs of Earth.
That is Gjallarhorn.

211
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,583
These days, each of
the economic blocs

212
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,625
feel like they're
nothing but a burden.

213
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,458
Something to do with
the fact that, lately,

214
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:36,166
Gjallarhorn uses their power
for their own interests.

215
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:41,000
Then, in the middle of all this
chaos, you showed up Miss:

216
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:44,458
Kudelia from the
Noachis July Assembly.

217
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:48,916
The heroine of the times who led
the Mars independence movement.

218
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,541
You're a regional
independence activist.

219
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:54,666
That alone makes you a target.
And now you plan to go around

220
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,166
them to negotiate with
one of Earth's leaders.

221
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,458
This is a serious
matter for Gjallarhorn.

222
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:01,833
In fact, it's something
that could shake up

223
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,916
their entire
governing system.

224
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:07,708
[EUGENE] I didn't get
anything you just said,

225
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:10,000
but I'm guessing that
she's really important?

226
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,000
You still haven't
answered my question.

227
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:13,666
How does that make her property?

228
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,333
Ask the old man if
you really wanna know.

229
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:19,750
See, the young lady sitting
there is much more important

230
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:22,916
than she seems.
Way above my paygrade.

231
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:33,083
[ATRA] That was rough.
I'm glad you're safe.

232
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:35,083
[MIKAZUKI]
Yeah, thanks to Akihiro.

233
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,916
You're a really good pilot, man.

234
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,208
My machine was
roughed up, though.

235
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:42,916
[MIKAZUKI] Maybe so, but mine
got it even worse.

Hm?

There's plenty left.

Nah. I'm good.

eat twice as much.

[TAKAKI]
Hey! Mikazuki!

242
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,666

just got back!

All right.

00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,125
I'm gonna go to the hanger
and help the old man.

246
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,083
Tell them I'll leave
it to them.

247
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:03,875
Uh... Yeah, sure.

[AKIHIRO, ATRA grunt]

00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:08,500
Well, we talked it over.

250
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:11,916
Teiwaz has decided to let us
speak with Mr. Barriston.

251
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,875
And if all goes well,
we're as good as in!

00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:15,500
[CREW cheers]

253
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,208
[ORGA]
Calm down.

254
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:20,875
We're not a division of
Teiwaz yet. We gotta negotiate.

Weak

[BISCUIT]
From this point,

257
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,500
we'll be heading out to <i>Saisei</i>
accompanied by the Turbines.

258
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:28,041
[DANTE]
<i>Saisei</i> ?

259
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:30,166
[BISCUIT] Yeah, it's a massive
space ship that Teiwaz uses

260
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,625
as their main headquarters.

261
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,458
According to them,
it isn't far from here.

262
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:34,416
[SHINO]
Awesome!

263
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,416
[FUMITAN]
Excuse me, boss.

264
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,291
I've made contact with Mars.

265
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,083
Excellent. Tell them
our situation and--

266
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:41,375
But before I do,

267
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,458
there's a message you
may want to see first.

268
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:44,958
[ORGA]
Hm?

269
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:48,000
[BISCUIT] I just can't
believe the Mars funds

270
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,291
are almost completely
dried up now.

271
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:52,875
Knew it would go someday,
but not this fast.

272
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:54,208
[BISCUIT]
It's hard for our other members

273
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:55,791
to do business down there.

274
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,583
Not with Gjallarhorn always
keeping an eye on 'em.

275
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,875
We have to do something.

Ma'am! There you are!

Have the talks finished yet?

279
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:10,291
[AMIDA] Yeah It looks like we'll
be taking those guys with us

280
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:11,583
back to Saisei.

281
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,583
Was the kid in the white
mobile suit here, too?

282
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,916
I don't think any
of the pilots came.

283
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,166
Does it bother you?

284
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,291
[LAFTER] Well, hot and
bothered's more like it.

285
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:23,250
It's hard to find someone who
can really light my fire.

286
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,625
'Course, no one does that
better than my darling.

287
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:26,916
Whatever.

288
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,208
Well anyway,

289
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:31,166
They're an interesting bunch,
that's for sure.

290
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,708
But they would've had it easier

291
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:35,791
if they accepted
Naze's proposition.

292
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:38,041
[YUKINOJO] I thought I told
you to be careful up there!

293
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:38,708
[BOY A]
Yeah, yeah.

294
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:40,375
[ORGA]
Old man.

295
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:42,375
Things going well?

296
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:44,791
We got some spare parts
in stock for that one,

297
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:49,541
so we should be able to
fix it. The real problem is...

298
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,916
[ORGA]
Mika!

299
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,208
[MIKAZUKI]
Orga. I heard it went well.

300
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,291
[ORGA]
Yeah... somehow.

[ORGA grunts]

302
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:03,666
You didn't do so bad yourself.

303
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,916
Huh?

304
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,541
Not this time. I wasn't
much help to you. Sorry.

305
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:11,791
Come on. You did great.
Give yourself some credit.

306
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:14,333
[MIKAZUKI]
No, it wasn't good enough.

307
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:15,750
[gasps]

308
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,916
[MIKAZUKI]
I've gotta try a lot harder.

309
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,583
[ORGA sighs]

310
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:28,708
[ORGA] You're right. I'm gonna
have to try harder too.


311
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:35,500
[RIDE] Jeez! How long does
it take to get to <i>Saisei</i> ?

312
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,583
It's been like ten days already!

00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,625
[YAMAGI]
I heard we're almost there.

314
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:42,666
[TAKAKI] Hey, have you
seen Mikazuki recently.

315
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,875
[YAMAGI] No. I think he's on
the other ship with Mr. Akihiro.

316
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:48,208
Something about training
in their simulators.

317
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:50,208
Huh? Training?

318
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:51,875
[RIDE]
They're amazing.

319
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,500
Seriously...
They're already strong,

320
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:56,291
but they just keep pushin',

321
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:58,166
Unlike some people...

322
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,958
[SHINO] There's an entire
ship full of babes out there,

323
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:04,083
but none of them will
even look my way.

324
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,958
What? Do you really
care about that crap?

325
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:10,541
[ATRA] You do know they're all
Mr. Naze's wives, don't you?

326
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:11,708
Of course they wouldn't.

327
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:13,416
[EUGENE]
Tell that to Shino.

328
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,500
[SHINO]
It's not fair!

329
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:23,625
Property... Me?
What does that even mean?

330
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:24,875
And, why does Teiwaz...?

331
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,833
[ATRA]
Miss Kudelia.

332
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,333
Oh, hi Atra.

333
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:30,958
Do you want to go over to
the other ship, later on?

334
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:33,333
Hm? To the Turbines?

335
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:34,416
What for?

336
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,000
[ATRA giggles]

337
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:38,083
[NAZE]
All right. Get to it.

338
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:41,500
Now, what did you
want to talk about?

339
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,416
[BISCUIT grunts]

340
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,958
So, what's this?

341
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:46,708
A list of our assets.

342
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:49,500
It includes everything we seized
from Gjallarhorn on Mars.

343
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,125
That's quite impressive.

344
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:53,666
Thank you. We were
wondering if...

345
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,583
...if maybe you would
be willing to introduce us

346
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:57,833
to a trader we
could sell them to.

347
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,333
Well, haven't you kids
worked with any before?

348
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:02,625
[BISCUIT] There are a couple of
merchants we've known since the

349
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:05,958
CGS days... but they're
unusual items.

350
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,916
I don't really think an
average trader would be able

351
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,916
to handle them.

352
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,875
Yeah. You're probably right.

353
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:14,000
Of course, we'd be happy
to pay you a commission.

354
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:16,083
Do you think it's possible?

355
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,541
Anything's possible, kid.

356
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:21,208
But are you that
strapped for cash?

357
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,500
Well... we, uh...

358
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:24,416
To be honest,
we're in trouble.

359
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,708
[NAZE] Really? Then why did
you reject my offer after I said

360
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,500
I'd provide work
for all of you?

361
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:30,666
[ORGA]
Uh...

362
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:31,875
[NAZE]
Hm?

363
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:35,500
Well, I mean, you said
we'd be separated.

364
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,458
That wasn't an option.

365
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:38,958
[NAZE]
You'll have to explain that.

366
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,750
[ORGA gasps]

367
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,583
[gasps]

368
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,625
[ORGA]
We just can't leave each other.

369
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:47,458
Well that's creepy.

370
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:50,916
I didn't realize I was dealing
with a ship full of love birds.

371
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,291
Call it whatever you want.

372
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:56,458
I said... Tekkadan can't
leave each other.

373
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:59,583
And said I'll need
an explanation.

374
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,541
[ORGA]
Because...

375
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:03,000
Orga.

376
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,416
[NAZE]
Hm?

377
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,791
[ORGA]
We're connected. That's why.

378
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,000
What?

379
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:10,125
[ORGA] Connected with
our fallen friends,

380
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:12,791
when we spill our
own blood in battle.

381
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:15,708
And together our spirits
harden like iron.

382
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,833
So, you see...

383
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:20,000
We can't leave each other.

384
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:21,875
We're bound forever.

385
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:25,791
As one unit,
whatever the cost. Understand?

386
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:28,750
Oh, okay. That's what you were
talkin' about when you pointed

387
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:30,958
your gun at that
bastard, Maruba, isn't it?

388
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:32,458
[ORGA]
Huh?

389
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:34,958
[NAZE] You mentioned following
orders, and your friends.

390
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:36,041
[gasps]

391
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,791
[NAZE]
So tell me:

392
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:40,416
were those the fallen friends
you were talking about.

393
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,208
[ORGA exhales]

394
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:44,208
[NAZE] If you can't
go back, that's fine.

395
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:48,291
But remember, if you're
gonna protect Tekkadan now,

396
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:49,666
you won't have anyone to blame

397
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,291
but yourself when
things get bad.

398
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:55,458
One order from you could
be death for those kids.

399
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,458
You and you alone hold
their lives in your hands.

400
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:01,875
I wonder. Can you handle
that responsibility?

401
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:04,166
Do you have what it takes, Orga?

402
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,916
[ORGA grunts]

403
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,125
[ATRA, KUDELIA]
Aw...

404
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,500
[KUDELIA giggles]

405
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:15,125
[ATRA] So... all the children
here are Mr. Naze's, right?

406
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:18,000
Yep! But each one has
a different mother.

407
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:20,250
Our darling stays pretty busy.

408
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,791
[ATRA]
Uh...

409
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,208
[AMIDA] We keep all
of the infants here

410
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:25,333
on the ship with us.

411
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:28,291
Uh! You mean there are others?

412
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,458
[LAFTER] Yeah. The older
ones are attending school

413
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:32,416
on the surface.

414
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:36,000
You must be lonely without
your big brothers, huh?

415
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:39,500
[AMIDA] So you see,
this is our family.

416
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:43,958
Mm... You smell so good!

417
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,333
[ATRA]
Family...

418
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:48,958
[BABY coos]

419
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:50,708
[giggles]

420
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:51,583
[ATRA]
There's a smile.

421
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:53,500
[KUDELIA]
Uh? Huh?

422
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:55,958
You've had such a serious
look on your face lately.

423
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:58,375
I wanted to cheer you up.

424
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:01,208
[KUDELIA gasps]
Atra.

425
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,750
[ATRA sighs]

426
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,291
Cute, aren't they?

427
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:06,583
[KUDELIA]
Hm...

428
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:09,041
Yeah.

429
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:11,208
[ORGA]
I think I'm more than prepared.

430
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:12,791
Yeah?

431
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,166
[ORGA]
And we're finished taking orders

432
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,875
from some idiot who
isn't one of our own.

433
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:21,750
I won't ever have my friends
dying in vain again.

434
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:24,166
Not while I'm in
charge of Tekkadan.

435
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,958
If we die, we die with honor.

436
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:29,541
[BISCUIT]
Orga.

437
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,208
And I'll be right
down there with 'em.

438
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:34,541
[NAZE gasps]

439
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:38,666
[ORGA] If it's for them,
I would lay down my life.

440
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,125
[BISCUIT]
Uh, are you all right!

441
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,541
There's no point in
you dying too, kid.

442
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:44,041
You're the leader.

443
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,250
And if you're not around,
Tekkdan really will break up.

444
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:49,458
[gasps]

445
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:52,500
[NAZE] It's funny... You talk
about spilling blood

446
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,791
and your connection
with each other.

447
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:57,416
But you don't call people
like that your "friends".

448
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,375
[BOTH gasp]

449
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:01,625
That's "family".

450
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:03,291
[gasps]

451
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:05,416
[NAZE] Well, I know
what you want now.

452
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,000
[BISCUIT]
What? Umm...

453
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,875
So I'll see what I can
do about it, all right?

454
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:13,291
[gasps]
Thank you very much!

455
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:14,666
Thank you, sir!

456
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:19,125
[ORGA groans]

457
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:20,416
Um...

458
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,250
[ORGA]
I messed up.

459
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:25,166
How? He told us he'd
see what he could do.

460
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,166
That's not the problem, okay?

461
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,416
When you're talkin' busines,

462
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,000
the most important thing
is to be on even terms.

463
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:33,500
But he treated me like a kid.

464
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:34,750
[laughs]

465
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,750
[ORGA]
Hm? What's so funny?

466
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:41,625
[BISCUIT] It'll be fine.
Whatever happens, you know that

467
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:44,041
we'll still follow you,
no matter what comes our way.

468
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:46,125
[ORGA grunts]

469
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:48,708
[ORGA]
Yeah.

470
