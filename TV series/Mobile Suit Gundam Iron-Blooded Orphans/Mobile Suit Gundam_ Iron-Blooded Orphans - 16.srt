I'm not sure what you're
trying to pull here,

From our position,

it appears that the procession

Dort's headquarters.

Security forces are here,

00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:50,083
[GAELIO] Gjallarhorn seems
rather relaxed about this.

I don't understand, sir.

186
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:57,666
The union members must be
hoping to try and negotiate


187
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,916
with the Dort officials,
but, of course,

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
that's an impossibility.

Still, after bringing
Mobile Workers

What does that mean?

00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:13,541
Gjallarhorn will corner
them till they attack.

194
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:17,000
And I assure you, they're
just the tip of the iceberg.

195
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,458
If trouble does start,
the other dissidents

will take their own actions
against Gjallarhorn.

But wouldn't that
complicate things further?

198
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:27,625
Hardly, it's exactly what
they're hoping for.

00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:12,625
[EIN] I know Specialist
Major Bauduin is a man

476
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:14,166
who can be trusted.

477
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,583
For him, it's "early to
bed, early to rise."

478
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:18,208
He never even wastes food.

479
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:20,708
There's an order to
every aspect of his life

480
00:24:20,791 --> 00:24:22,708
and I can tell his
heart is pure.

481
00:24:22,791 --> 00:24:24,541
Now he's piloting
the Mobile Suit

482
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:27,208
that's been in his
family for centuries.

483
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:29,583
With him, I'll finally
be able to wipe out

484
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:31,416
those filthy bastards.

485
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,125
Next time on <i>Mobile Suit Gundam:</i>
<i>Iron-Blooded Orphans</i> ,

486
00:24:35,208 --> 00:24:38,291
Episode 17,
"Kudelia's Decision."
