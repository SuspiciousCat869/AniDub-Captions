[SHINO]
Okay, we got it open.

161
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,125
No... Takaki.

162
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,250
[SHINO]
Let's get him outta there.

163
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,333
[RIDE]
Hope he's all right! Takaki!

164
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:43,750
[SHINO]
Shut up, Ride!

165
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:44,875
[DANTE gasps]

166
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:45,666
Oh, man...

167
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,541
He's hurt, bad! Takaki!

168
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,041
[SHINO]
I said shut up!

169
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,625
Now you'd better close it.
The suit was stopping the blood.

170
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,541
[ORGA] A doctor's comin'
from Naze's ship.

171
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:54,750
Try and stabilize him!

172
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,333
[DANTE] How? We've never
done this before.

173
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:59,541
They told me to bring
this over, so I--

174
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,333
[gasps]

175
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,791
[MERRIBIT]
I'll take that.

176
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,750
First, I need the
transfusion pack.

177
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:12,666
Then, you'll need to get the
Medical Nanomachine ready.

178
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,500
Hurry!

179
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:14,458
[ALL]
Yes, ma'am!

180
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:15,666
[CREW MEMBER A]
Let's get going!

181
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,958
[CREW MEMBER B]
I know exactly where it is.

182
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,625
[CREW MEMBER C]
Start up the Nanomachine!

183
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:32,000
[MERRIBIT] Well, good news.
He's fine, Boss.

184
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:36,125
Hey. Look, uh...
Thanks for the help today.

185
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,625
I didn't know--

186
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:39,666
Interplanetary travel without
a doctor aboard the ship?

187
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:43,125
Sorry, but it seems to me that
you're not doing your job.

188
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:47,000
[ORGA exhales]

189
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:50,666
[YUKINOJO groans]

190
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:55,541
[ATRA] Uh... Hey, Mikazuki.
Is Takagi getting better?

191
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,791
[MIKAZUKI] Merribit says
that he's gonna be okay.

192
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,791
Oh! I'm so glad to hear it.

193
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:03,083
So, who were those guys
that attacked us out there?

194
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,375
[MIKAZUKI]
Hm...

195
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,833
[LAFTER] What's up, Azee?
Did you find out anything?

196
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:11,041
[AZEE]
Hmm...

197
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:13,208
Based on their Ahab
Reactor's frequency,

198
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,250
they appear to be Rody frames.

199
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:16,666
[LAFTER]
You sure?

200
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,291
I don't remember their suits
being so round and cute.

201
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,375
Did you just call them "cute"?

202
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,250
What'd you find out
about this big one?

203
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,208
[AZEE] Well, I didn't
have enough samples,

204
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,916
so I wasn't able to find
the closest match.

205
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,625
But, from what I've got,
it's most similar to the...

206
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:32,666
...Barbatos?

207
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,208
Huh? They don't look
anything alike.

208
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:38,541
If you're curious, you can
look it up yourself.

209
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,541
But all that matters right now,

210
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:43,125
is that we've just been
challenged to a fight.

211
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,958
[LAFTER]
Huh.

212
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:46,750
[NAZE]
Let me get this straight.

213
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,708
You actually believe
that it's wise

214
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:51,750
to go up against our
organization.

215
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:55,041
Right, Mr. Brooke Kabayan?

216
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:58,458
Don't think you can't be
defeated just 'cause Teiwaz

217
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:01,291
has your back. They're not
the only ones who've been

218
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:05,625
growing more powerful.
Surely, you know that.

219
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:08,125
Just don't blame me if
you're sorry later on.

220
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:10,916
[chuckles]

221
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,375
[BOTH]
Uh?

222
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:18,041
[NAZE] Geez. That fat idiot
sure has a big mouth, huh?

223
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,750
Yeah...

224
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:22,708
[AMIDA] So, any word
on Takaki's condition?

225
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:25,458
[BISCUIT] He's stable, now.
And thanks to Ms. Stapleton,

226
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,083
he should make
a full recovery.

227
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,666
I told you she's a
versatile woman.

228
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,875
[ORGA]
Yeah...

229
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:33,375
[NAZE gasps] Was there
some kinda problem?

230
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,833
She told me it wasn't right
to be up here without a doctor

231
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:38,458
on board and that I wasn't
doing my damn job.

232
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:39,625
I don't disagree.

233
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,000
[ORGA grunts]

234
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:44,791
Anyway, those guys that
attacked us. Who were they?

235
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,708
Those were the Brewers.

236
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:49,000
Basically, they're a bunch
of pirates who're mostly

237
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,583
active along the routes
between Mars and Earth.

238
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,208
Pirates, huh?

239
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:56,333
That means they were probably
after the ship's cargo, then.

240
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:59,041
They were more interested in
having us hand over Kudelia

241
00:11:59,125 --> 00:11:59,791
than anything else.

242
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,291
[ORGA, BISCUIT gasp]

243
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,958
[NAZE] In fact, they rather
arrogantly told us that our

244
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:06,708
lives would be spared if we
let her come with them.

245
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,000
Can they do that?

246
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:11,166
I mean, do they really have
that kinda muscle?

247
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:15,250
They're certainly well known as
being a militant organization.

248
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:18,875
 Of course, there's no way
they could ever defeat Teiwaz.

249
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:21,375
Which is why I can't
understand how they think

250
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:23,875
they can talk so
tough this time.

251
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:26,416
Maybe they've gotten
more powerful support.

252
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,125
But how did they even know about
Kudelia in the first place?

253
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:33,916
Good point. It sounds to
me like there's a lot more

254
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,958
behind this than we know.


255
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:40,583
[EIN] So, this is Earth.
I'm really here.

--[door hums]
--[OFFICERS laugh]

257
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:45,500
[OFFICER A] Hey rookie,
Where are your bags?

258
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,666
Didn't you get clearance
to go to Earth, too?

259
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,500
Wait, of course you didn't
If some filthy animal

260
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:54,583
born on Mars went down there,
the whole planet would stink.

261
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,750
Maybe you shouldn't
say that, sir.

262
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:59,666
He came here on Specialist
Major Fareed's ship.

263
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,291
And, as you well know,
the Fareed family is one of the

264
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,250
Seven Stars who
lead Gjallarhorn.

265

[OFFICER A scoffs]

266
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,166
Somebody needs to
put him in his place.

267
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,250
You know that even associating
with a man like you could ruin

268
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,666
Specialist Major
Fareed's good name.

269
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:17,083
There may be a misunderstanding.
'Cause, currently, I report to

270
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:20,791
Major Bauduin. So I assure you,
there's nothing to worry about.

271
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:23,833
The Bauduin family is one
of the Seven Stars, too.

272
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,416
You makin' fun of me?

273
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:30,375
No. Thanks for teaching a hick
like me. I really appreciate it.

274
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:32,833
[OFFICER A]
Let's go.

275
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:36,000
[OFFICER B gasps]
Yes, sir.

276
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,583
All I want is to make
sure those kids don't live

277
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:41,083
to see another day.

278
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:44,416
As long as I get
that opportunity...

279
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,833
...I'll follow anyone I have to.

280
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:53,166
[IZNARIO] The Mars expedition
went well. Excellent work, men.

281
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,583
[MCGILLIS, GAELIO]
Sir.

282
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,166
[IZNARIO] Both the Inspection
Bureau Director-General

283
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:00,083
and Regulatory Chief of
Staff deemed it worthy

284
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,208
of the Fareed family name.

285
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:04,041
Yes, sir.

286
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:07,375
[IZNARIO] Gaelio, I want to
thank you for guarding my son.

287
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:09,583
Yes, Lord Iznario.

288
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,916
Although, he was the one
who saved my neck out there,

289
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,083
most of the time. If I'm
really being honest about it.

290
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:18,666
[IZNARIO laughs]
That sincerity of your is

291
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,791
quite a valuable asset.

292
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:23,208
I should thank
Lord Bauduin myself.

293
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:26,125
[GAELIO] I'm quite
grateful, my Lord.

294
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:29,250
Tell me, McGillis.
Now that you're back,

295
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,625
will you be able to spend
some time at our home?

296
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:36,666
No, sir. As of now, I have
other duties to attend to.

297
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,125
[IZNARIO]
I see. Very well.

298
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:45,083
[GAELIO] Didn't you have
to go home after all this?

299
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:47,083
I've already seen my Father.

300
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:50,000
And I have no intention
of doing it again.

301
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,708
That makes sense.

302
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:54,500
It's probably better
if you don't have to.

303

[BUTLER] Welcome back,
Master Gaelio.

304
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:04,125
[GAELIO] I can't believe it's
been three months since I left.

305
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,500
Mars is a little
too far from home.

306
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:09,083
But I'd say the trip
was well worth it.

you're still just a little kid,

312
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:25,041
Aaen't ya?

313
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,041
[ALMIRIA] It's good to see
you again too, brother.

314
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:29,583
But you should know,
I'm a full-grown lady now.

315
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,708
I even learned the
proper way to brew tea.

316
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:34,125
I can't wait to make
you some, Macky.

317
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:36,166
I'm looking forward
to it, then.

318
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,416
[GAELIO]
I think I'll pass.

319
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,750
[ALMIRIA grunts]

320
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,541
[ALMIRIA grunts]

321
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,791
Huh?

322
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:47,666
[ALMIRIA yelps]

323
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,166
[MAID]
You all right, Miss?

324
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,083
[ALMIRIA] I-I'm fine. I was only
checking the temperature.

325
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:52,666
[MAID]
But, Miss...

326
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:56,958
[GAELIO] So, You heard anything
from the little mustache man?

327
00:15:57,041 --> 00:16:00,583
I have. He's much more
useful than I expected.

328
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:03,583
In fact, he's located the
whereabouts of Miss Bernstine.

329
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:06,333
[gasps]
Then I'll leave here at once.

330
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:07,791
Then I can get my revenge.

331
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:09,333
[MCGILLIS]
Relax.

332
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:12,208
Even if you left right now,
I doubt that you'd make it.

333
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:14,291
They're most likely on the move.

334
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:16,791
Well, anyway, he asked
me for some money

335
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,333
and said he'd use some pirates.

336
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:19,875
Seriously?

337
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:23,166
It would seem Tekkadan's much
farther than we had thought.

338
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:27,208
Apparently, they're not flying
on the Ariadne routes.

339
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:30,791
Now they're surrounded by the
silence of deep outer space.

340
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:34,041
I say we should sit back and
let the rats clean the sewers.

341
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,458
[GAELIO]
Hm.

342
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:38,666
[MCGILLIS] Gaelio. We must look
at the bigger picture.

343
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,375
[GAELIO]
Hm!

344
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,791
Now that we're
back from Mars,

345
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,000
things have become
much clearer to me.

346
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:46,625
Gjallarhorn has quite
an impressive reach,

347
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:49,333
but it isn't in the
remote spheres.

348
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:52,166
And there are seeds of
corruption, like Coral,

349
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,791
slowly growing inside.

350
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,833
[GAELIO Well, it's the
current regime's fault

351
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,916
if that's what's going on.

352
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,750
Yes. You're right.

353
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:02,916
[GAELIO] At the same time, the
supremacy of the regime that's

354
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,791
in place now is also what's
made Gjallarhorn so strong.

355
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:09,458
Nobody's trying to
reform the inside.

356
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:12,791
Which is precisely why we
need a chess piece to move.

357
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:15,125
A powerful one that could
shake up the regime.

358
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,833
And you think Kudelia
might be just the pawn

359
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:19,166
you're looking for, huh?

360
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,583
Possibly. In due time...

361
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:23,958
[GAELIO]
Hm?

362
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:28,625
Kay, it's ready. Here, Macky.
I hope you like it.

363
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,458
[MCGILLIS]
Thank you, Almiria.

364
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:31,916
Hey, what about mine?

365
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,291
[ALMIRIA] You said you
didn't want any, remember?

366
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:35,625
[GAELIO]
You little...

367
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:38,583
[MCGILLIS]
Mm! It's delicious. Very nice.

368
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:39,750
Really?

369
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,166
Yes.

370
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,375
When we get married, I'll make
it for you every day.

371
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,416
You can still
change your mind.

372
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,625
It'll be too late after
the engagement party.

373
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:50,500
[ALMIRIA] You are so immature!
Every time somebody wants to

374
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,958
marry you, you run off on
one of your "missions".

375
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,291
Just stay out of this.

376
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,041
Father doesn't know what
to do with you, anymore.

377
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:58,750
[GAELIO] H-Hey, look just
leave me alone, all right!

378
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:05,250
[KUDELIA]
I wasn't able to help him.

379
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:06,666
What's wrong with me?

380
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:10,125
--[door hums]
--[EMBI] Uh... Hey, Ms. Kudelia.

381
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:13,541
[KUDELIA] Huh? Oh! I didn't
see you guys there.

382
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,000
What're you up to?

383
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:17,875
We thought we should take
up a collection for Takaki.

384
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:20,333
[ELGAR]
Do you have anything for him?

385
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:21,958
You mean like snacks?

386
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,125
[ELGAR]
Yeah!

387
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:24,916
[EMBI] So what are
you doin' here, anyway?

388
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,416
I-I was just, uh...

389
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:33,416
Feeling a little useless,
I guess. Because I...

390
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,000
[ATRA] I know something
that you can do.

391
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:37,541
[KUDELIA]
Hm?

392
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,875
You could go and visit him.

393
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:42,250
[KUDELIA gasps]

394
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:43,750
[KUDAL]
You piece of crap!

395
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,458
--[thudding]
--[MASAHIRO grunts]

396
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,333
We finally got our
hands on a hostage,

397
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:54,500
Then, you blew it! Didn't you?!
How did you let him escape? Huh?

398
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,625
What the hell were
you thinking?!

399
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,500
Oh, and then on top
of everything else,

400
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:01,666
you guys got your Man Rodi's
all beaten up out there!

401
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,000
These Mobile Suits are a lot
more expensive than you

402
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,458
Human Debris!
You know that, right?!

403
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:09,458
[BREWERS gasp, grunt]

404
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:11,583
[KUDAL] Let me hear
your pitiful excuses.

405
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,625
Come on, let's hear it.

406
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:16,583
[MASAHIRO]
I-I'm sorry, sir.

407
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:18,750
[KUDAL] What's that?
You're gonna need to speak up.

408
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:21,708
[BROOKE] Kudal! We need
a tactical meeting.

409
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:22,875
Come to the bridge.

410
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:25,083
Okay, I'll be
right there, Captain.

411
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:28,083
Heh. You space rat.

412
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:29,791
Learn some respect!

413
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:32,375
[BREWERS grunts]

414
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,125
[MASAHIRO groans]

415
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:35,875
[BREWER D]
Are you OK, Masahiro?

416
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:37,041
Yeah, somehow...

417
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,416
Sorry, man. Wish we
coulda helped you.

418
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,791
Well, I'm the one who
let him slip away.

419
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:44,875
So I guess I'm the one
who should get it.

420
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:48,166
Oh yeah. Right before he
escaped, I thought I heard you

421
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,250
communicating with
the pilot for a while.

422
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:51,791
--[MASAHIRO] Uh, I was just--
--[BREWER B] Damn it!

423
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,583
This wouldn't have happened
if it wasn't for him!

424
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:56,625
Because of those bastards,

425
00:19:56,708 --> 00:20:00,208
Pedro isn't here
with us anymore.

426
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:01,791
I'm gonna kill them.

427
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:04,500
No matter what it takes,
I'll kill them!

428
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:05,500
I swear it!

429
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,000
[MASAHIRO grunts]

430
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:18,208
[AKIHIRO] Guess I'm being
punished for what I've done.

431
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,916
[ORGA]
What's that supposed to mean?

432
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,625
[AKIHIRO]
Oh, hey...

433
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:27,291
[ORGA] Listen. Akihiro, you
can't start blamin' yourself

434
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:30,750
for what happened
to Takaki. Understand?

435
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:32,875
Because I'm the one
who gave the order.

436
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:35,250
[AKIHIRO]
No, it's not that.

437
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:38,625
This doesn't seem like
you at all, Akihiro.

438
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:42,125
[AKIHIRO] Yeah, you're right.
It isn't like me...

439
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,000
...or Human Debris either.

440
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,666
What are you talkin' about?

441
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,958
[AKIHIRO] My younger
brother was out there.

442
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,458
[MIKAZUKI]
Your brother?

443
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,708
His name's Masahiro.

444
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:57,416
We were separated when we
were sold off as Human Debris.

445
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,000
I promised I'd find him.

446
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:02,416
But as the months
turned into years,

447
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,916
it felt like he
was already dead.

448
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,041
And then you saw him.

449
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,666
[AKIHIRO] Yeah. He was
piloting the Mobile Suit

450
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,458
that attacked Takagi.

451
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:17,583
You know, I was really
starting to have fun.

452
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:21,000
Forming Tekkadan with you
guys and fighting together.

453
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:24,250
Saying things like,
"for my friends."

454
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:28,666
I even liked training hard with
Lofter and the rest of them.

455
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,208
But I was having
such a good time

456
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:34,416
that I forgot I was still trash.

457
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,708
Human Debris aren't
supposed to be happy.

458
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:40,541
And that's why I'm
paying for it now.

459
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:41,833
[gasps]

460
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,291
I get it. So because of us,

461
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:48,000
you're having to go
through this. Is that it?

462
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:50,666
[AKIHIRO gasps] No. That's not
what I'm trying to say at all.

463
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,708
If Tekkadan being fun was
