00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,958
Then, they'll be no
question that we are

159
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:38,125
the ones with the power to lead.

160
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,791
[GAELIO gasps]

161
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:47,833
[GAELIO] Show them
our origin. Is that it?


162
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:57,125
[YAMAGI] I wonder if...
boss is doing okay.

163
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:58,958
We haven't gotten any
orders in a while.

164
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,375
[TAKAKI]
Yeah...

165
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:03,458
Can't imagine
how it must've felt

166
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,125
seeing Biscuit die like that.

167
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:08,208
[grunts]
I'm sure it was terrible.

168
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:09,916
Damn Gjallarhorn to hell.

169
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,708
Next time around,
I'm gonna kill 'em.

170
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:12,958
[TAKAKI]
Calm down.

171
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,083
We need to find out what
Boss wants to do first.

172
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:17,458
Aren't you even mad
about what happened?

173
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:18,791
Or maybe you're just scared.

174
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:19,833
[TAKAKI]
Not even close, Ride!

175
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:21,083
So what is it, then?!

176
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,583
[TAKAKI] All I said was
that we have to wait.

177
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,083
[RIDE]
You are always trying to.--

178
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:27,541
[YUKINOJO] That's enough!
Now go and argue somewhere else.

179
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,625
Some people want to eat
their food in peace.

180
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:30,833
[ALL gasp]

181
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:32,416
[YAMAGI]
We're sorry.

182
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,791
So, is Orga doin' any better?

183
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:43,083
I brought him food earlier,
but he didn't come out.

184
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:44,166
[YUKINOJO]
I see...

185
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,375
--[clattering]
--[ATRA] Oops! S-Sorry.

186
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:47,958
Atra, are you all right?

187
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:50,291
Uh, yeah.

188
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,083
You sure?

189
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:55,791
[ATRA] I was just remembering
back when Cookie and Cracker

190
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:58,041
asked me to look after Biscuit.

191
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,916
[MERRIBIT] Would you like me
to take over in the kitchen

192
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,958
for a while?

193
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:03,833
[ATRA]
No. I'm fine.

194
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,000
Well...

195
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,291
[YUKINOJO]
Just let her take care of it.

196
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,375
Huh?

197
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,000
[YUKINOJO]
If she keeps herself busy,

198
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,458
it might keep her
mind off things.

199
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:15,916
[YUKINOJO]
Mmm... This is delicious.

200
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,625
[ATRA giggles]
Glad you like it!

201
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:25,333
I'm so confused. I wish
I knew a way to help him.

202
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:29,166
But, my job is to stay out of
the way, if that makes sense.

203
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,375
You just have to let him be.

204
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:34,416
Besides, nothin' you say'll
cheer him up anyway.

205
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,666
Right.

206
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,000
But, it looks to me like
the guy's really bein'

207
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,083
hard on himself, this time.

208
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:43,166
Which is too bad, 'cause those
kids need someone to lift

209
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:46,583
their spirits They need
their leader back.

210
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,208
[gasps]
You're kidding, right?

211
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:56,333
No, I'm not. He went down in
the skirmish. Now he's gone.

212
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,583
And Orga got banged up
pretty bad out there,

213
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:01,041
so I'm takin' over for today.

214
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,500
This is too much
to take, Shino.

215
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,750
I mean, he just
found out that his

216
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:09,458
older brother killed himself.
It doesn't seem fair...

217
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:12,250
It's time. Further
transmissions aren't safe.

218
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:16,583
[SHINO] Yeah, okay. Sounds like
I'd better get going.

219
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:19,291
[EUGENE] Hey. How's Orga
taking all this?

220
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:23,208
[SHINO] I don't know. We haven't
seen him since it happened.

221
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:26,375
In fact, we haven't
heard a thing.

222
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:28,958
Everyone's just
sort of waiting.

223
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:33,791
[MAKANAI] It appears
the mood inside the ship

224
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:37,625
is becoming rather unstable.

225
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:40,333
The death of one who's so
close must be difficult

226
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,083
for such young children.

227
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,500
I suppose it's possible
a thing like this

228
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:47,875
could even take away
Tekkadan's will to fight.

229
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,541
Well, if they all decide
that they're ready to quit,

230
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:53,333
there's no way I can
change their mind.

231
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:56,125
But just let me assure you.
If that happens,

232
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,375
then I'll escort you by myself.

233
00:12:58,458 --> 00:12:59,541
Oh?

234
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,458
'Cause I need to
keep moving forward

235
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:04,166
and do everything I can.
I haven't traveled this far

236
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,791
just to throw it all away.
This is too important to me.

237
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:11,250
I must say, you have courage
for such a young girl.

238
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,708
Now, what did you
want to discuss?

239
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:16,250
Well at the moment sir,
we're staying on course

240
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,958
and heading to
Parliament in Edmonton.

241
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:21,708
But between here and there,
I'm almost certain that

242
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,875
Gjallarhorn plans to
set up traps to try

243
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:26,041
and ambush us along the way.

244
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:29,083
So, I think changing our
destination would be safer.

245
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,291
[MAKANAI]
You do? Where, then?

246
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,500
[KUDELIA] Our best bet
is Anchorage, Alaska.

247
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,208
[MAKANAI]
Are you serious?

248
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:38,125
But what are we supposed
to do when we get there?

249
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:41,333
First, we can all disembark at
the port. Then, board a train

250
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,666
owned by Teiwaz and
head to the election.

251
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,583
[AIDE A]
A train?

252
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:45,958
[MAKANAI]
Interesting.

253
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,416
Wasn't aware such
a thing still existed.

254
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,500
Once every week, it transports
cargo from Anchorage here,

255
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,375
through the city
of Fairbanks

256
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,708
and runs all the
way to Edmonton.

257
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:59,458
The train isn't marked
or particularly unusual,

258
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:01,666
so it won't raise any suspicion.

259
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,583
Also, its route is
far from any cities,

260
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,625
which means our
Ahab reactors aren't

261
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:09,583
going to interfere with their
radio waves whatsoever.

262
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,083
[AIDE A]
Yes, of course.

263
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:14,000
That way, we can haul the Mobile
Suits without any problem.

264
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:16,958
I've made the necessary
arrangments with Teiwaz.

265
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:18,833
The Montag Company
approves too,

266
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:21,375
so I think we've got
everything taken care of.

267
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:24,208
You've put together
quite an amazing plan.

268
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:27,250
Particularly since you've never
even been to Earth before,

269
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,083
as far as I know.

270
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,791
I'm always studying.

271
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:36,125
I have to. It helps me to live
up to people's expectations.

272
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,541
I see.

273
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:42,541
Ah, well, I have no objections.
It's in your hands, now.

274
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:46,500
Thank you very much, sir.
And if I may, There are still

275
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:48,666
a couple of things that
I'd like to ask of you.

276
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,166
[MAKANAI]
Oh?

277
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,791
Out in Anchorage, I hear that
there's a powerful member

278
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,250
of the Arbrau Parliament.

279
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:57,625
He's a collegue of yours,
named Lasker Alesi, right?

280
00:14:57,708 --> 00:15:00,375
Yes. That's correct, young lady.

281
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:02,791
[KUDELIA] Could you please
ask for his assistance?

282
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:05,291
He can transfer us
to the train faster

283
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:08,750
and make sure that it's
done more discreetly.

284
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:12,291
You have a point, there. Very
well, I'll arrange for it then.

285
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:13,041
[KUDELIA]
One more thing.

286
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,500
[MAKANAI]
Hm?

287
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,541
[KUDELIA] You said you could
win if we make it in time,

288
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,708
but once we get
there and it begins,

289
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:21,916
we still have no guarantee that
you'll be re-elected, do we?

290
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,833
[chuckles] What's the matter?
You don't trust me?

291
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:27,916
We only have one chance, sir.

292
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,750
I just want to make certain
we've done all we can.

293
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:33,625
've been told that Mr. Alesi
has quite a bit of influence

294
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,291
within the Makanai faction.

295
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:38,833
And I was wondering if it would
be possible to ask him to lobby

296
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:42,083
for you in Parliament,
until we get there ourselves?

297
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:44,750
I can see you've
thought of everything.

298
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:47,625
All right, then.
I'll tell him to do so.

299
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:50,250
[gasps]
Thank you so much.

300
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,416
[MAKANAI]
First, the leader of Teiwaz,

301
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,416
then that merchant Montag.

302
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,083
And this time, it's me.
Well, you certainly know

303
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,916
how to get your way
with men, don't you?

304
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,458
You want independence from Mars.
And your qualities as an

305
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:08,666
idealistic young woman have
the ability to move people,

306
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:13,625
yet you're also a realist who
wants to deregulate half-metal.

307
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:17,416
No doubt about it. You'll be a
good leader, one of these days.

308
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,125
[KUDELIA] Actually, sir.
I don't want to become a leader.

Huh?

324
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:57,958

Sure, I guess we might be a

Take the Turbines for example.

their own conclusions.

a strong sense of duty.
