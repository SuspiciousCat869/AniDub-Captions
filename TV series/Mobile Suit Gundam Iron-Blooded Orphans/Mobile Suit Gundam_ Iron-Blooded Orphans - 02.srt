Hm?

00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,875
[KUDELIA] That system uses
special nanomachines,

32
00:01:35,958 --> 00:01:37,916

[YUKINOJO] Once those
nanomachines go into the body,

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,750
they create a
kind of "brain lobe"

36
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:46,875
that controls spatial awareness.

37
00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:49,916
Then, through that, it connects
to an external device,

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,291
making a system that allows
the brain to directly

39
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:54,750
process all of the
Mobile Suit data.

Look, Mikazuki, the feedback
from a Mobile Suit is

a whole lot different
than a Mobile Worker's.

47

00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,666
Yes, sir. But I...

161
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,208
[CRANK]
Good. We need to fall back.

162

[EIN]
What do you mean?

164
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,625
Looks like his thrusters
are malfunctioning.

165
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:28,916
The remaining Mobile Workers are
safe and have cleared the area.

166
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,166
It's time to retreat.

167
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,000
[MIKAZUKI]
I'm not done.

168
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:33,791
[EIN]
But why, sir?

169
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:34,916
[CRANK]
You heard me!

170
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,208
[gasps, grunts]

171
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,833
[MIKAZUKI]
I'm not done yet.

172
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,625
[grunts]
I'm not...

173
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:44,625

[engine rummbles]

177
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:12,000
[ATRA] Something's not right.
Is everything okay?

178
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,500
[COOKIE, CRACKER]
Hey! Hey!

[ATRA gasps]

00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:15,916
[COOKIE, CRACKER]
Hey!

181
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,458
Now stop! You're speeding up.
You gotta slow down!

182
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:24,125
[COOKIE, CRACKER yelp]

183
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:27,125
[CORAL]
You what? How could you fail me?

184
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:30,458
And, there's more, sir.
Captain Orlis died in battle.


185
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:33,666
We lost a third of our
soldiers as well as a Graze.


186
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,125
Our only choice was to retreat.

187
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,166
[CORAL]
Don't give me that!

188
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,041
[CORAL]
How could this happen?

189
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:41,583
I wanted the leader of the
Martian independence movement

190
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:45,208
to be destroyed on that base.
Kudelia Aina Berstein

191
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:48,250
should've never
made it out alive.

192
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,625
With her gone forever,

193
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,791
it would've caused an
upheaval on Mars and only

194
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:55,000
strengthened their hatred
toward the people of Earth.

195
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,208
It would've worked perfectly!

196
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:02,750
[CORAL] Now, we'll never get
any funding from Nobliss.

197
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:05,875
And if we lost a Mobile
Suit out there, too...

198
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:08,958
When is Specialist Major
Fareed due to arrive here?

199
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,833
Sir, two days.

200
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:14,750
All right By the time he's here,
I want Kudelia captured.

201
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:18,875
All evidence of the battle is to
be erased. I want them all dead!

202
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:19,541
[CRANK]
But, sir...

203
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:21,625
What?

204
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,291
[CRANK]
We were fighting...

205
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:24,541
...against children.

206
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:25,958
[CORAL]
Children?

207
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,791
So you went out there and
allowed some little punks

208
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:28,625
to defeat you?

209
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,250
[CRANK]
Did you hear me?!

210
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:33,666
[CRANK]
I can't, in good conscience,

211
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,041
fight soldiers who're so young.

212
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:39,375
Especially when I know they're
fighting against their will.

213
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:42,916
You need to man up! Who cares
how old the fighters are?

214
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,833
I'm giving you a direct order.
Exterminate them.

215
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:48,583
Failure is not an option.
Do you hear me?

Hey! Just a little higher.

220
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,125
[CORPSMAN B ] Some of them
might be buried down underneath.

221
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:05,500

No... This can't be.

224
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,500
[CHAD]
Yeah, I'm sure.

225
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:15,625
This is all that's left of
his Alaya-Vijnana System.

226
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,375
[SHINO] Danji. We used
to talk about this.

227
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:19,958
You always said
you wanted to die

228
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:23,333
smothered between huge boobs.

229
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,291
They'd be really soft, you know?

230
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:30,375
Not rock hard like this
old busted cockpit.

231
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:33,583
Hey, Danji. Answer me...

232
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:38,000
[AKIHIRO] Hey. It looks like the
First Corps survivors are back.

all those space rats gone?

them all out here.

Yes sir.

[SASAI]
Haeda. What're we gonna do now?

238
00:11:57,041 --> 00:12:00,375
We're all being targeted
by Gjallarjhorn. Maruba's gone!

239
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:01,875
Look, I don't know.

240
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:04,500
Let's take what we can,
then get the hell outta here.

241
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:07,708
I'd better come up with
my next move, quick.

my brother. Now let's go!

I came down to make delivery.

00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:14,416
So where are all the usual

so worried about you.

Okay. Really sorry, Atra.

seen Mikazuki?

[YUKINOJO]
Just hold on a minute.

261
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,750
I wasn't able to cut the
link with this suit

262
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:53,708
while you were sitting in
the cockpit, unconscious.

263
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:55,916
[MIKAZUKI]
How many died?

264
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,708
[gasps]

265
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:01,916
[YUKINOJO] There were
42 from Third Group

266
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,083
and 68 from First Corps.

267
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:09,500
But just so you know,
you and this one here...

268
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:11,375
...did a good job.

[ATRA grunts, gasps]

00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,000

00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:27,583
Oh... Yeah. Hey... Mikazuki?

[MIKAZUKI]
What's up?

274
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:32,125
I, uh... You okay?

275
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:36,125
[MIKAZUKI]
Yeah. Thanks for askin'.

276
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:39,416
I'm kinda in a hurry, though.
See ya later.

277
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,708
Oh... Sure.

278
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:47,958
[ATRA] I'm so stupid.
Why'd I ask him that?


279
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:50,208
I knew he wasn't all right.


280
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:54,833
[KUDELIA] Many years
after the Calamity War,

281
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:57,208
Mars was completely divided
and then governed

282
00:13:57,291 --> 00:14:00,000
by the four different
economic blocks.

283
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:04,458
As a result of this, poverty
spread across the planet.

284
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:09,250
And, sadly, most of these
victims were only children.

285
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:12,458
Even to this day, with all
the time that's passed,

286
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:14,750
so many lives are being lost.

287
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:18,000
They're innocent little
ones who suffer each day.

288
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:20,000
And, something must be done.

289
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:28,041
[KUDELIA]
So many died today...

290
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:30,000
[sobs]

291
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:33,083
[KUDELIA]
And it's all because of me.

292
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:34,500
[FUMITAN]
Miss?

293
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:38,166
[KUDELIA gasps] Fumitan!
Where were you? I was worried.

294
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,250
[gasps]

295
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,291
[FUMITAN] Oh. I'm quite
all right, Miss.

296
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,000
It's just a scratch.

297
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:46,541
Anyway, I'm sorry about
what happened.

298
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:49,500
When there's an emergency,
I've been given strict orders

299
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,875
to contact Mr. Bernstein
before anybody else.

300
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,208
[gasps]
What did father say?

301
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:56,416
[FUMITAN] Well, he was
very worried about you.

302
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,166
And he wants you back
home right away.

303
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,166
[gasps]

304
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,916
Sorry. Not yet.

305
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,500
[FUMITAN]
Huh?

306
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,375
[KUDELIA] I requested
that this trip to Earth

307
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:08,083
was to be done
in total secrecy.

308
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:11,333
And yet, It's quite clear to me
now that I was the target of

309
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:15,541
Gjallarhorn's attack. But for
some reason My father,

310
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:18,083
who's completely against
the freedom movement,

311
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,666
gave his full support.

312
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,791
I don't want to believe he's...

313
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,291
What's that, Miss?

314
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,000
[KUDELIA]
The way things are, now,

315
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:29,166
I don't know that I'll be able
to return to my father,

316
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:32,250
unless I can confirm
I'm wrong about this.

317
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:35,291
I understand. But, Miss...

318
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,708
...there's no point
in staying here now.

319
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:38,791
It just seems...

320
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,625
[MIKAZUKI]
So, you're still here?

321
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:44,791
[KUDELIA]
Uh, Mikazuki. Well, uh...

322
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:51,375
Thank you so much. I really
appreciate your protecting me.

323
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,541
[MIKAZUKI]
You don't have to thank me.

324
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:58,166
Uh...Yes, but because
of me those people...

325
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,166
[MIKAZUKI]
You gotta stop this, all right?

326
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:03,833
[MIKAZUKI] You really
think all those people died

327
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:05,958
'cause of something you did?

328
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,416
Don't disrespect my
friends like that.

329
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,041
[gasps]

330
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:16,625
[KUDELIA]
He's right.

331
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:19,500
I didn't know what
I was saying.

332
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:22,375
Completely ignorant
of what was going on.

333
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:27,291
I just wanted understand,
yet the whole time...

334
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:30,083
[KUDELIA]
Those eyes...

335
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:34,166
[KUDELIA] It felt like he
could see right through me.

336
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,208
[KUDELIA]
Like he was laughing at me.

337
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:38,458
[CRACKER giggles]

338
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:42,500
[COOKIE] Whoa! See this?
It looks like a butt!

339
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,250
[ATRA]
Hey. Stop that!

340
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:45,875
You shouldn't play
with your food?

341
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:48,541
[grunts]
Just put it down.

342
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,041
[KUDELIA]
Um. S'cuse me...

343
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:51,666
[CRACKER]
So, who are you?

344
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,166
Is she your friend, Atra?

345
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,041
[ATRA]
What? No...

346
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:55,833
Need some help?

347
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,833
Oh, I'm sorry.

348
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:00,625
My name is
Kudelia Aina Bernstein

349
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:02,041
Kudelia?

350
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,916
[KUDELIA] I heard you talking
back here, so I just...

351
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,250
Hold on! Aren't you the
one who's on the news?

352
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:08,833
[CRACKER] Wait. Are you
saying she's a celebrity?

353
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,833
[COOKIE giggles]
I want an autograph.

354
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:12,458
[CRACKER]
Yeah! Could I get one too?

355
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:15,333

You fool!

[ORGA grunts]

358
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:20,791
[HAEDA]
You made us look like idiots.

359
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:21,791
Using us for your own gain--

360
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,250
Well, I heard that
when First Corps

361
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,500
went in for their
surprise attack,

362
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:29,791
all of you guys ran
into a little situation.

363
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,166
[scoffs]

364
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,000
So how is that our problem--

00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,625
[grunts]

366
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:38,791
Kid, I've heard enough
outta you. You got it? Huh?!

367
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:40,625
What the hell are
you looking at?

368
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:43,000
Do you all want
some of this too?

369
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:47,125
[ORGA]
No. This is between...

370
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:49,250
...you and me.

371
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,916
Come on. Let's do it. 

372
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,833
[chuckles]

373
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:57,625

[ALL grunting]

375
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,666
[HAEDA]
Just leave him.

376
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,875
Figure out the damage from
the battle and report to me.

377
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,083
[SASAI]
And hurry up!

378
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,500
[ORGA grunts]

379
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:08,375
Orga!

380
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:11,125
Dammit! I won't forgive them.

381
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,500
Me either. We can't.

382
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:15,666
[ALL gasp]

383
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,541
Who knows? Might be our chance.

384
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,958
[EUGENE]
Wait. Are you sure?

385
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:29,916
You said you wanted to do
this before, Eugene.

386
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,583
It's time to take over.

387
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:35,000
[EUGENE] Yeah, I did.
But in a situation like this?

388
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:37,375
We've already lost
so many out there.

389
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,833
Listen. Maruba was a
good-for-nothin' bastard,

390
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:42,166
but those guys in
First Corpse are worse.

391
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,625
To them, we'rejust human shields

392
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,875
who can go off and fight
their battles for 'em.

393
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,375
It won't take too much
longer before their business

394
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:52,416
goes south. Then the jobs'll
get even more dangerous for us.

395
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,041
No way we'll make
it out in one piece.

396
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,333
And if we leave,

397
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:59,166
kids like us'll never
be able to find jobs.

398
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,791
Looks like we don't
have any other choice.

399
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:04,541
What do you think about this?
Are you in or out?

400
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,833
We're nothing but
human debris.

401
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:10,208
Each one of us are
here against our will.

402
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:12,916
So I'll follow
whoever's in charge.

403
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,625
Whether it's the
other guys, or you.

404
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,000
[ORGA shuckles]

405
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,958
[EUGENE]
Okay. Let's have a meeting

406
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,583
and figure out our next move.

407
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,708
[BISCUIT] Hey, wait.
What about Mikazuki?

408
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,375
Ah. Guess I forgot.

409
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,458
[BISCUIT]
Are you serious?

410
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:31,291
If Mika's against me on this,
that's it you guys.

411
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:32,541
I'll call it off.

Eh... That won't happen.

[ORGA] I'm sure he'll
have my back on this one.

416
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,916
If he knows I'm serious,
he won't even hesitate.

417
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,666
[EIN] You're not gonna
take the troops?

418
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,458
[CRANK]
No. I'm going alone.

419
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:48,500
[EIN] But, sir. Even three
of our Mobile Suits

420
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:50,083
weren't any match
for those guys.

421
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,250
[CRANK]
I underestimated them,

422
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,875
but I won't make the
same mistake twice.

423
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:57,208
[EIN] In that case, sir.
I want to go with you and--

424
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,416
[CRANK] You got banged
up pretty badly,

425
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,125
so you'll only slow me down.

426
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,958
[gasps]
But... I have to.

427
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:06,375
[CRANK]
Fighting against children...

428
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:07,916
[EIN]
Lieutenant?

429
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,625
Please, Ein. I'm going alone.

430
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:12,333
I have a plan and
I don't want to

431
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:15,250
drag the rest of
you down with me.

432
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:18,333
No, of course not.

433
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,208
I don't want to fight them.

434
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:23,666
But if there's no choice,
I'll have to engage.

435
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:26,000
[CRANK]
Ein...

Mika.

438
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,125
[MIKAZUKI]
Huh?

439
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:36,250

Really improved your looks.

440
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:37,541
Yeah, thanks.

441
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:41,000
[ORGA] Don't you want
to say goodbye?

442
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:43,041
A lot of our boys
went down, back there.

443
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,500
[MIKAZUKI]
Nah. That's okay.

444
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:48,500
It's like you said,
years ago...

445
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,208
"You'll have plenty of
time to see the dead

446
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,666
when it's your
turn to join them.

447
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:56,208
So just try and keep
the living alive.

448
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:59,625
And give everything you've
got to protect them."

449
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:01,333
I said that, huh?

450
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:02,958
Maybe so...

451
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,250
Heh.

[ORGA]
I want you to do somethin'.

455
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,958
And, it's kinda important, so--

456
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:18,208
That's it? You're just gonna
accept before hearing it?

457
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:19,750
Of course I will.

458
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:22,583
'Cause it's you.
If you wanna do something,

459
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,333
that's good enough for me.

460
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,500
[ORGA chuckles]
Knew I could count on you.

It's nothing. Thanks.

Well, well!

Thank you for coming
here gentlemen.

466
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:48,208
It's been quite a while
hasn't it, Major Coral?

467
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:49,666
It's rather cramped in here,

468
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,958
but I've prepared a
little party for you two.

469
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:54,625
Though, you must be tired

commotion around here...

483
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:27,208
I can tell they're
hiding something.

484
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:28,541
It's obvious.

[CRACKER] Hey, Cookie.
Miss Kudelia is so beautiful!

490
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:16,791
Like really pretty!
But, I couldn't help noticing...

491
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:18,333
She's kinda clumsy, isn't she?

492
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:20,375
[COOKIE] C'mon, now.
Don't say that, Cracker.

493
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,291
I can see she's
workin' pretty hard.

494
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:24,541
Maybe it's up to the two
of us to teach her stuff.

495
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:26,833
[CRACKER] Sure! And we should
tell her she's awesome

if she acts
like a good girl
