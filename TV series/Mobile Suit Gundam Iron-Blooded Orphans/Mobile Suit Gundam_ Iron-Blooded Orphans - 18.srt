and you won't be
a human anymore.

158
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,791
Won't be human, huh?

159
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,250
I know what that's like.

160
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:39,125
The Earth people in Gjallerhorn
remind me all the time.

161
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,750
[GAELIO]
Huh?

162
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:44,416
I'm not like them because
I was born half-Martian.

163
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,833
[GAELIO]
What?

164
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,958
[EIN] But they aren't the only
ones who feel that way.

165
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,958
It's Earth people in general.

166
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:53,333
They only approve of you if
you've got pure bloodlines.

167
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,916
It's the same on Mars, too.

168
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,791
That's where my mother's from.

169
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,333
I was only allowed
in Gjallerhorn

170
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:01,875
because my father was
already an officer.

171
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,500
There was still
discrimination though.

172
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:07,791
But Lieutenant Crank...
he was different.

173
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:10,958
He always treated me
like everybody else.

174
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,416
[CRANK]
Listen, Ein.

175
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,875
Your worth has nothing to do
with where you were born.

176
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:18,291
[EIN]
Thank you, Sir. I just...

177
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:21,083
There are no two people
who're exactly alike.

178
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:24,416
That's why it's pointless to
group them together as one.

179
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,583
The most important thing
is choosing the path

180
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,250
that's right for you.

181
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,208
Don't let 'em get ya down.

182
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:33,750
Just show those guys
how you want to live.

183
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,458
You're right, Sir.

184
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,375
[EIN]
He inspired me.

185
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:41,250
And gave me the strength
I needed to move on.

186
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:45,250
Now I don't care what people
think. I believe in myself.

187
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,583
[GAELIO] Kinda sounds to me
like you think I'm no different

188
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,708
than all the others
who bullied you.

189
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:51,250
[EIN]
N-No, that's not true, Sir. I--

190
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,708
It's fine. Relax.

191
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:57,583
I don't think I've ever met a
man who's quite like you, Ein.

192
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,833
And you were right when you
said we have to be the ones

193
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:02,708
who face Tekkadan head-on
and bring them down.

194
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:05,541
But at this rate,
I'm not so sure.

195
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:06,791
We're entering the territory

196
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:09,458
of the Outer Earth Orbit
Regulatory Joint Fleet.

197
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:12,666
Though you're a Seven Star, they
won't let us do as we please.

198
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,333
Oh, I'm well aware.

199
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:17,041
And while bowing down to that
woman is the very last thing

200
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,541
I wanna do,

201
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,541
there's no other choice.

202
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:25,708
[MCGILLIS] As I told you, I
represent the Montag Company.

203
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:29,625
It's a pleasure to see you once
again, Miss Bernstine.

204
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:30,875
You know this guy?

205
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:32,416
We met briefly, once.

206
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,541
Now tell us your proposal.

207
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,666
[MASKED MAN] We have the means
necessary to provide you

208
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,625
with a reentry ship
down to Earth.

209
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:39,833
[ORGA]
Huh?

210
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,666
You desire a revolution

211
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,291
and we'd like to
extend our support.

212
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,916
If that's agreeable
to you, Miss.

213
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,958
So you're offering
to be our advocate?

214
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,625
I could've sworn you were
here to talk business.

215
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:53,625
[MASKED MAN]
Yes, of course I am.

216
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,333
When you've achieved
your goals,

217
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,250
Nobliss Gordon and
McMurdo Barriston

218
00:10:57,333 --> 00:11:00,333
will each gain the rights
to all half-metals

219
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:04,333
To put it simply,
my company wants in.

220
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,291
N-Nobliss?

221
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,875
Now I understand.

222
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,250
[MASKED MAN]
What do you say?

223
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,166
Negotiations haven't
started yet.

224
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,666
Do you think they'll succeed?

225
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,750
[MASKED MAN] Based on what
I've seen at the Dort Colonies,

226
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,708
I've reason to
believe they will.

227
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:19,250
How soon do you need an answer?

228
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,625
Afraid we don't have
a lot of time left.

229
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:24,916
Please, make your
decision quickly.

230
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,291
Man, who would've ever guessed
that Barriston and Gordon

231
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:28,833
were connected like that?

232
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:30,083
Yeah.

233
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:32,250
Seemed like Naze
knew all about it.

234
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:35,833
I can't figure out why he didn't
wanna fill the rest of us in.

235
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,166
I guess it means
he doesn't think

236
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,208
we're important enough
to hear those things yet.

237
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:40,750
Huh?

238
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,375
[ORGA] They do business by
tryin' to outsmart each other.

239
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:46,916
And right now, we're only
scurryin' around their feet.

240
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,458
So if we really want them to
think of us as their equals,

241
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:52,541
we need to make some changes.

242
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:59,000
[TAKAKI]
Look at this stuff comin' in.

243
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:01,291
Apparently, the Montag Company
thought it'd be nice

244
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,125
to bring over some gifts.

245
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:06,333
We got missiles, loads of
ammo, all kinds of weaponry.

246
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:08,875
Yeah, and even new
parts for Barbatos.

247
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:10,583
Seems kinda fishy to me.

248
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,833
It sorta feels like they're
taking advantage of us,

249
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:13,750
you know?

250
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,083
Like they say:

251
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,083
"There's no such thing as
somethin' for nothin'."

252
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:19,708
Hey, be careful when you're
countin' those things, Ride!

253
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,208
[RIDE]
Got it!

254
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:22,250
[ORGA]
Hey, Mika.

255
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,375
[MIKAZUKI]
Hm?

256
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:24,791
How's the cargo lookin'?

257
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,291
[MIKAZUKI]
I'm not sure, yet.

258
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:29,625
The old man's still checkin'
to find out what we've got.

259
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:33,416
Hang on. Why's
chocolate man here?

260
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,583
[BISCUIT]
Huh?

261
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,208
[MASKED MAN chuckles]

262
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:38,875
I hope your twin sisters are
doing well these days.

263
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,375
Hey, wait. Are you the guy
we met from Gjallarhorn?

264
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,791
No way. What the hell
are you doin' here?!

265
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,291
Did you come to
set a trap for us?

266
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,041
Answer me!
Who's side are you on?!

267
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,208
Honestly, how would it
benefit me to come aboard

268
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,375
and then pull
something like that?

269
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:53,541
You'd better start talkin'.

270
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,166
[MCGILLIS]
I will.

271
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,916
Because we both know you'd see
through it if I were deceptive.

272
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,916
I want to reform Gjallarhorn,

273
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,333
and finally put an end
to all the corruption.

274
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:04,458
What?

275
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:06,458
[MCGILLIS]
Then as a new organization,

276
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,416
we'll be allowed more freedom.

277
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,041
With you on the outside,
you're in the perfect position

278
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:14,083
to help us return to
our former glory.

279
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:16,041
I'm not so sure we'd
be able to do that, so--

280
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,375
I disagree.

281
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:19,666
I've seen what you've
accomplished with Kudelia.

282
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,666
And that's why I'm fully
prepared to lend a hand.

283
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:26,791
You see, we share
mutual interests. Don't we?

284
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,166
Still think it's a trap?

285
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,875
Right now, it's hard to say.

286
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,083
[MCGILLIS chuckles]

287
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:33,333
[MCGILLIS]
Well, think about it, won't you?

288
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:36,791
Oh. And don't say
a word about me.

289
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:39,125
Because if you do...

290
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:40,541
...it's all over.

291
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,791
The deal's
off the table.

292
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,291
Phew. I'm starved...

293
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:57,041
Oh, uh, would you like to eat
something, Miss Kudelia?

294
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:00,875
Uh, excuse me?

295
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,458
Oh. I'm sorry.
I didn't see you there.

296
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:10,250
You don't look very well to me.

297
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,208
Maybe you need to
get a little rest.

298
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:13,625
I really appreciate it,

299
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:16,666
but I have to prepare
for negotiations, so--

300
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,541
Look, I understand
your situation,

301
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,208
but that won't matter
if you fall ill.

302
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:24,583
No. It's okay. I'll be fine.

303
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,250
Miss Kudelia...

304
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:29,625
[MIKAZUKI]
You know...

305
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,083
She's pretty incredible.

306
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:32,333
[ATRA]
Huh?

307
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,625
[MIKAZUKI]
Like a whole different person...

308
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,541
Maybe she's forcing herself.

309
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:38,750
[MIKAZUKI]
Huh?

310
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:41,750
I mean, before, when
she was standing there

311
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:44,750
in front of the camera and
talking to everybody...

312
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:48,791
...her legs were
kinda shaking.

313
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:50,291
I see.

314
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,041
[CARTA]
Men! Stand proud!

315
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:56,833
For we are the Outer Earth Orbit
Regulatory Joint Fleet!

316
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:59,958
[SUBORDINATES] We are
perseverant and fortitudinous!

317
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:00,750
[sighs]

318
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,833
Just perfect.

319
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:07,583
Now, the Kudilia-woman is still
headed our way, isn't she?

320
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:10,333
Her name is Kudelia
Aina berstine, ma'am.

321
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:12,666
According to Specialist
Major Bauduin's report,

322
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,791
it's confirmed.

323
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:16,041
Well, I sincerely hope so.

324
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,666
To the old men representing
the Seven Stars,

325
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,958
and to that one man
in particular,

326
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:23,833
it'll be a chance to show
them what we're made of.

327
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,916
[SUBORDINATE B] The Specialist
Major requested to join us

328
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,666
on the battlefront, ma'am.

329
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,666
[CARTA] I can assure you
there's nothing to worry about.

330
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:35,000
A sad loser like that Gaelio-boy
could never steal our thunder.

331
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:37,916
Oh, I'm so pumped up,
I can't even stand it!

332
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,333
They better not change course.
Hurry up and get here.

333
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:45,083
Then we'll squash
you fools to death!

334
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:48,750
[REPORTER A]
A few questions, Ms. Fleurs.

335
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,166
[REPORTER B] There's been
a lot of talk lately

336
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,875
about the ex-prime minister,
Makanai, running.

337
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,000
[REPORTER A]
As a member of parliament,

338
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,583
care to comment on
his alleged bribery?

339
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:56,750
[REPORTER B] At the general
assembly meeting in two months,

340
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,833
can we expect you to be
vying for the nomination

341
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,208
of prime minister as well?

342
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,125
There'll be an official
announcement soon.

343
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:04,708
Till then, I must ask
for your patience.

344
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:09,375
That's all for now, gentlemen.
Have a lovely weekend.

345
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:12,833
Makanai still at the
Oceanian Federation?

346
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,666
[IZNARIO]
Don't worry.

347
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,833
We're keeping an eye on him.

348
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:20,000
So was he the one who
called for this girl?

349
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:23,833
People are always in search
of an idol they can believe in.

350
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:27,125
But of course,
they're just fictitious.

351
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:30,125
Most don't seem to
care about the truth.

352
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:36,916
[MAKANAI humming]

[MAKANAI sighs]

354
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,750
[AIDE A] Excuse me, but
haven't you had enough, Sir?

355
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,541
I feel like celebrating.

356
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:49,208
After all, an important
guest is on the way.

357
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:50,250
[AIDE A]
Yes, of course.

358
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,291
Though she may have
just been lucky.

359
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:55,208
Lucky? Well, I suppose so.

360
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:58,958
Random twists of fate always
decide things in the end.

361
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,250
Don't they?

362
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:03,250
To me, she won't be
the Maiden of Revolution.

363
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:06,833
She just might be
my Lady Luck instead.

364
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:08,083
Sir.

365
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,625
Right now, I feel like
a princess in a castle

366
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:14,375
who's waiting for her Prince
Charming to arrive.

367
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:15,958
[NAZE]
Based on what I've read,

368
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:18,666
the Montag Company's been
around for a hundred years.

369
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,083
And they haven't run
into any real problems.

370
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,250
At least as far as we know.

371
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,875
Can't believe Tekkadan
got caught up

372
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:26,458
in another annoying thing.

373
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,500
[AMIDA] They may be a
little hard to handle,

374
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,833
but what's wrong with
some excitement?

375
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,541
You know, I think you might
just have a point there.

376
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:36,291
Those are the same reasons I
can't get enough of you in bed.

377
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:37,666
[AMIDA chuckles]

Come on! What the hell?!

Hey, what's wrong, man?!

381

They do train hard.

The one with muscles?

00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,541
Yeah, he's playing with
that pierced idiot.

the others, doesn't he?

00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:59,208
What do you mean?

00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:00,041
[LAFTER sighs]

388
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:01,333
[LAFTER]
I don't know.

389
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,541
It's kinda hard to explain...

Are you all right?

00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,041
Sorry to make you keep
trainin' with me like this.

[SHINO]
Hm?

395
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,833
To be honest, I guess
I never realized

396
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,458
you had such a sense of duty.

397
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:19,958
Seriously?

398
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:22,708
Yeah, well, things are kinda
different for me these days.

399
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:25,250
'Cause I'm free of that now.

400

To tell you the truth,

401
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:30,458
having to give my friends
directions and bark out orders,

402
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:32,916
that isn't for me,
anymore, ya know?

403
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,458
What if somebody died
following my commands?

404
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:39,625
If I can go fight in a Mobile
Suit out on the front lines,

405
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,875
I won't have to worry
about things like that.

406
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:44,458
And I'd still be able to
protect the other guys.

407
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,125
Makes sense.

408
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:50,333
[YUKINOJO] Hm. Don't think I've
ever seen you lookin' better.

409
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,500
I just hope it improves
your mobility a little

when you need it the most.

00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,500
Hey! You can finish
up now, Yamagi.

413
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,958
Not yet. Needs a
little more work.

The rest of 'em
go out and fight.

Best we can do is
give our support.

If we hadn't run
into that man...

419
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,291
[KUDELIA] But I know
I have to make it to Earth.

420
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:34,875
To achieve our goal,
to carry out your dying wishes.

Maybe I don't have a choice.
Will I have to work with him?

[ATRA]
Miss Kudelia!

Oh, hey, Atra.

I'm so glad I found you.

this way, is something wrong?

00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,375
I didn't think it
was good for you

00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,291
to go this long without eating.

[KUDELIA]
I'm so sorry.

00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:04,291
They're all my fault.
Please forgive me.

N-No, don't say that.

435

[ATRA]
You know, I've been thinking

436
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,416
We should really talk
to each other more.

437
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,166
Uh, I'm sorry. I guess that
came out kinda weird, huh?

438
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,541
But just remember,

439
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:23,708
if you ever feel like things
are getting sorta tough,

440
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:26,083
I want you to tell
me about it, okay?

441
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,000
You can count on me.

442
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,500
Uh.

443
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,875
Then again, maybe I'm not
exactly the most reliable girl.

444
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,250
I think I'm the one
you can't depend on.

445
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,708
[ATRA]
Huh?

446
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:39,416
[KUDELIA] 'Cause, lately...
I just feel so powerless.

447

But It has to stop.

00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:43,458
I know I can't stay
like this anymore.

449
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,208
To give hope...

450
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:48,500
...and to try and
lead other people...

451
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,166
...I need to make a change.

452
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,000
[MIKAZUKI]
You're really something.

453
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:54,250
[ATRA]
Mikazuki. Why're you...?

454
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:57,625
Hm? Oh, the lunch box!
Thanks a lot.

455
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,166
[MIKAZUKI] You were able
to stop Gjallarhorn

00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,291
just by using your voice.

457

As far as I know,
even Orga can't do that.

It's a r-revolution, right?
I'd like to do "revolution."

462

[MIKAZUKI]
I'll help, too.

463

about what it means

to have sense of duty.

465
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:27,000
And ever since, I've been
thinking about that myself.

466
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:29,708
While there isn't really
a whole lot I can do,

467
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:32,375
I promise, if you
have the responsibility

468
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:37,208
of going to Earth now, I'll
help you any way that I can.

469
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:38,583
Yeah, me too.

470
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:39,833
That isn't something
you should ever

471
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:41,750
have to deal with by yourself.

472
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:44,583
'Cause we're your friends
and your family.

473
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:46,333
Together, we can...

474
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:50,041
[KUDELIA crying]

475
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:52,541
N-No, please don't cry.

476
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,916
Mikazuki, you've gotta
hurry up and do something!

477
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,166
Uh, wait. Me?

478
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,208
[ATRA] Everybody knows:
When a girl's crying,

479
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:00,291
a boy is supposed to make
her feel better.

480
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:03,666
This is when you should hold
her in your arms. Come on!

481
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:10,125
Mikazuki, hold on, I--

482
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:16,625
[KUDELIA crying]

483
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:18,666
[ATRA]
Miss Kudelia...

484
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:21,041
It's okay. Really.

485
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:23,500
And you've had to keep
this inside for...

486
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,583
Mikazuki.
D-Don't worry about me.

487
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:31,041
Yeah, but... you're
crying, too, Atra.

488
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:34,208
No, I'm just fine.
You don't...

489
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:42,541
[BOTH crying]

490
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:56,875
[NAZE] I've researched
that company of theirs.

491
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:59,541
And they seem pretty
legitimate to me.

492
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:01,708
But it's still a
dangerous bet, guys.

493
00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:04,166
Yeah, I know it. The thing is--

494
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,333
[door opens]

495
00:23:05,416 --> 00:23:07,666
[KUDELIA]
It's our only option, isn't it?

496
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,708
M-Miss Kudelia.

497
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:14,125
I'll use anything I can.
And do whatever it takes.

498
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:17,166
In for a penny, in for
a pound, aren't ya?

499
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:20,041
Are you in, Brother?

500
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:23,333
Okay. It looks like
they've got a deal.

501
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:12,875
[DANTE]
Sometimes when I'm feeling down,

502
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:15,833
I just look at the diagram
of an electric circuit.

503
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:17,833
Staring into all
that information,

504
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:19,458
so efficiently laid out,

505
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,583
makes me think it's pretty
inefficient to feel bad

506
00:24:21,666 --> 00:24:23,458
when people call
my character "dull,"

507
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:25,583
or that they can't
remember my name.

508
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:28,500
A-Anyway, I'm Dante Morgro.

509
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:30,750
Don't you forget it, okay?

510
