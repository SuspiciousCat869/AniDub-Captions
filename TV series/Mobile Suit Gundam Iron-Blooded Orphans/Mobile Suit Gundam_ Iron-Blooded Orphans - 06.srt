00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,500
Understood, sir.

160
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:43,791
[CHAD] I look forward
to it, Miss, uh...?

161
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,291
Fumitan Admoss.

162
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:48,041
[CHAD]
I never knew. It's pretty.

163
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,083
[MIKAZUKI]
Mm?

164
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,791
[ATRA]
Oh! Hey, Kudelia.

165
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:58,875
[KUDELIA gasps]

166
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:00,416
[MIKAZUKI]
What are you doing?

167
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,041
Catching my breath. I just
discussed our next plan

168
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,166
of action with the
boss and the others.

169
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,666
Uh huh.

170
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,041
I was kinda surprised you
weren't there to participate.

171
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:09,916
[MIKAZUKI]
Hm...

172
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,375
[ATRA]
Hm?

173
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:14,708
It's just not my speed.
I don't like stuff like that.

174
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:17,166
I wouldn't understand it anyway.

175
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,416
[KUDELIA]
Mm, but...

176
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,458
What's that?

177
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:22,875
It's our lunch.

178
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:25,708
Everybody's busy, so we're
delivering them ourselves.

179
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,041
[KUDELIA]
Oh, I see.

180
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:27,791
[ATRA]
Later.

181
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:28,333
[KUDELIA]
H-Hold on.

182
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:29,916
[ATRA]
Huh?

183
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,541
I-If it's not too much trouble,
I'd like to help you guys out.

184
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:33,250
Huh?

185
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:33,916
[ATRA]
Uh...

186
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,958
[CREW chatters]

187
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,833
[ATRA] Great work!
Take a break, guys!

188
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,000
It's lunch time!

[CREW cheers]

190
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:49,125
One for you...

191
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:50,375
[BOY A]
Thanks, Mikazuki!

192
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:52,083
Don't worry,
there's plenty to share.

193
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,250
Okay, here you go.

194
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:54,833
Hey, thanks a lot, Kudelia.

[AKIHIRO grunting]

196
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,083
Akihiro. Lunch time.

197
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:01,666
[AKIHIRO]
Kinda busy.

198
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,083
[MIKAZUKI]
I'll leave it here.

199
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:05,458
[AKIHIRO]
Mikazuki.

200
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:07,458
[MIKAZUKI]
Hm?

201
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:10,458
[AKIHIRO] Let's train with
the simulator after this.

202
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:11,750
[MIKAZUKI]
Okay.

203
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:17,041
[ATRA] So, are we gonna try and
meet with that Teiwaz person?

204
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:19,708
Hold on, I thought Teiwaz
was a company, not a person.

205
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:20,666
Isn't that right?

206
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,125
Yes.

207
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:23,958
But unfortunately, we don't
know who to mediate with,

208
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:26,875
so even having a meeting
will be pretty difficult.

209
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:27,666
[MIKAZUKI]
I see.

210
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,333
You "see"?

211
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:32,583
This is really important.
Aren't you interested?

212
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:35,875
Not really. Orga will make
sure everything's all right.

213
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:38,333
And to be honest, I still
have no idea why you're

214
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:39,875
even goin' to Earth
in the first place.

215
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:43,041
[gasps] I didn't know that
we were gonna go to Earth!

216
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,541
Wait, didn't I tell you?

217
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,458
Oh, great. What am I
supposed to do?

218
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:49,625
I don't have any clothes that're
cool enough to bring there.

219
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,166
What's the matter with
what you're wearing?

220
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,125
[ATRA] We're going to Earth!
If I wear this, they'll think

221
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:55,958
I'm just a poor girl
from the country!

222
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:58,500
Freedom for the
Martian people.

223
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:02,666
Winning that is the reason
I decided to go to Earth.

224
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,208
In the Calamity War,
300 years ago,

225
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:07,541
the subdivided nations
of Earth were united

226
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:10,541
into four economic blocs.
Did you know that?

227
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:11,750
[MIKAZUKI]
No, I didn't.

228
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:14,708
[KUDELIA]
Oh, I see...

229
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:17,375
Well, following that,
all of the Outer Spheres,

230
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:20,291
like Mars and Jupiter,
were divided among the

231
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,416
different economic blocs
and then put under

232
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,041
their administration.

233
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:28,083
The Chryse Autonomous Region
came under the jurisdiction

234
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:30,666
of the Arbrau economic bloc.

235
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,666
But thanks to the unfair
Trans-Planetary Economic Pact

236
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,291
from the pioneer days,
people living there were

237
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:39,916
unjustly exploited
for many years.

238
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,500
I've been negotiating with the
Arbrau government of Earth

239
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:46,083
in the hopes of reforming
this unfortunate reality.

240
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,916
And the other day,
Togonosuke Makanai,

241
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,583
the leader of Arbrau,

242
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:55,375
agreed for the first time to
hold talks on this issue.

243
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,250
If all goes well,

244
00:10:57,333 --> 00:11:00,416
we'll have won economic
independence for Mars.

245
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,916
That is my goal, and I
truly believe it will lead

246
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,208
to the happiness of
everyone who lives there.

247
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:06,958
[clapping]

248
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,958
That's amazing, Miss Kudelia.

[KUDELIA gasps]

250
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:12,666
Okay... So you plan
on goin' to Earth

251
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,458
because you want
to make us happy?

252
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:15,833
[KUDELIA]
Uh...

253
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:18,125
[gasps]

254
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:20,541
Yes. That's my intention.

255
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:25,208
[elevator beeps, doors clatter]

256
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,958
[CREW MEMBER C] This thing
really took a beating out there.

257
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:30,333
[CREW MEMBER D] I'm surprised
he made it back alive.

258
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:33,250
[YUKINOJO] Alright, stop moving
your mouths and move your hands.

259
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:34,625
[CREW MEMBER C] 
Yes, sir.

260
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,833
[ATRA] Thanks for your
hard work! We brought lunch.

261
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:38,833
Ah, great. I appreciate it.

262
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:42,791
Hey! Stop what you're doin' and
come have some food, you guys!

263
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:43,833
Yes, sir!

00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,583
Nice! I'm starving!

265
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,750
[ATRA]
There's no need to rush, boys.

266
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,541
Here now, don't be shy.

267
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,583
[gasps]
Thanks a lot, Miss.

268
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:54,333
Do you want me to
help out here?

269
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:57,500
Yeah. When it's time
for the heavy lifting.

270
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:00,250
We're still doing some fine
tuning right now, though.

271
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,375
And you'd... need to
know how to read.

272
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,791
Yeah, okay, I understand.

273
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:07,791
Mikazuki. You really
don't know how to read?

274
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:08,875
[MIKAZUKI]
Mm.

275
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:11,375
How could that be? I mean,

276
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:14,791
you operate this complicated
machine all the time.

277
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:17,250
[MIKAZUKI] Well, it's not
like I move it by reading.

278
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,666
It's basically the
same as a Mobile Worker.

279
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,583
The rest is instinct.

280
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,541
[KUDELIA gasps]
Really?

281
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,458
Yeah. I don't know why
you're so surprised.

282
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:27,708
[KUDELIA] Hold on.
Didn't you go to school?

283
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,833
No I didn't.

284
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,333
I think the ones who did
are a minority around here.

285
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:35,000
[YUKINOJO] Well, a lot of them
were desperate just to survive.

286
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:37,500
So there wasn't much
time for an education.

287
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:40,166
A few of 'em are from
slightly better facilities,

288
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,625
so they might
have learned some.

289
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,375
I had no idea.

290
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,625
I finished the deliveries.

291
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,375
[MIKAZUKI] Do you know
how to read, Atra?

292
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:51,125
Yeah! The shop
keeper taught me.

293
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:54,166
Mikazuki. I was just wondering,
would you maybe like to

294
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,500
learn how to read and write?

295
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:56,583
[MIKAZUKI]
What?

296
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:58,541
I would be glad
to show you.

297
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,958
'Cause knowing how can
be a really useful skill,

298
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,666
as well as a great tool.

299
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,458
By reading books or
writing letters and essays, 

300
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:08,291
you can expand your own
world like never before.

301
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:09,250
[ATRA]
Uh.

302
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:10,666
No kidding.

303
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,291
So I'll be able to read
different types of books, huh?

304
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,208
Yes! Exactly.

305
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:16,541
[YUKINOJO]
Hmm.

306
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,833
[MIKAZUKI]
I guess it's worth a shot.

307
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:19,500
[EMBI]
Me too!

308
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:20,708
I'd like to learn,

309
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,208
if you wouldn't mind
having another student.

310
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:23,791
Think we could join Mikazuki?

311
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,208
Please! Come on!

312
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:27,833
Yeah, I wanna learn how!
Will you be our teacher, too?

313
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:30,708
Me? A teacher? I uh...

314
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:31,541
[ATRA giggles]

315
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:32,166
[KUDELIA]
Uh.

316
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,333
[YUKINOJO grunts]

317
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:39,666
Sure. If you're okay with it,
then let's all study together.

318
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:40,666
Awesome!

319
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,333
This is so cool!
We're gonna study!

320
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:44,833
Yeah! That's the
right attitude, you guys!

321
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:46,208
All right... I can
teach you too,

322
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,375
so if you have
any questions, just ask.

323
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,041
[EMBI]
Wait. You, Atra?

324
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:52,000
[ELGAR]
Think I'd prefer Miss Kudelia.

325
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,583
Huh? Hold on! What's that
supposed to mean?

326
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:55,708
[TROW]
It's nothin'!

327
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:59,083
[ATRA]
I can do it too. Ugh...

328
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,750
Connection. Think...

329
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:15,333
[FUMITAN] Is there something
I can help you with, sir?

330
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:18,708
Uh. Yeah, uh...

331
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:22,125
Actually. Would you mind
watching things here for minute?

332
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,000
[FUMITAN]
No. Not at all.

333
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,208
Thanks. I'll be right back.

334
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:34,583
[NOBLISS] I see. Coral bit
the big one, huh?

335
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:38,375
I didn't expect that
idiot to be this useless.

336
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:41,916
Those kids seem more
capable than he ever was.

337
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:48,250
[grunts] The young knights
protecting their new princess.

338
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:51,458
This might be even more
interesting than I thought.

339
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,500
[MCGILLIS] All right.
Second Lieutenant Ein Dalton?

340
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,041
Sir!

341
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,375
[MCGILLIS] We know that you
engaged a civilian organization

342
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:02,041
outside Chryse under
Coral's orders.

343
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,583
Your company planned
to defeat them

344
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,458
with your overwhelming power,

345
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:08,000
but that plan went
south rather quickly.

346
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,833
I want to know
why that happened.

347
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:13,125
Was it due to the
enemy's Mobile Suit?

348
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:14,875
[EIN]
Yes, sir.

349
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:17,750
I want to hear your
honest impression.

350
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,041
How would you gauge
his abilities?

351
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:22,083
Well, at first...
I was surprised

352
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,916
a civilian organization
even had a Mobile Suit.

353
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,250
But then, once the
battle started,

354
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,583
it turned into a different
kind of surprise.

355
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,625
A little more specific.

356
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:35,875
It was... something I never
experienced in training.

357
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:38,916
The mobility,
the reaction speed...

358
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,833
Their tactics caught us off
guard and that's when we...

359
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:46,666
[MCGILLIS] I see.
This certainly helped.

360
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,041
That's all for now.
You are dismissed.

361
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:52,333
[EIN] Specialist Major, sir.
I have a favor to ask.

362
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:53,250
Go ahead.

363
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:54,916
I wasn't good enough out there

364
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,666
and my superior officers
paid the price.

365
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,541
I can't return to Mars
in disgrace like this.

366
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:01,916
And therefore...

367
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,875
...I request permission
to join the pursuit force.

368
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:07,458
Please give me
this chance, sir.

369
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:11,041
I understand what you're saying.
I'll think about it.

370
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,750
[EIN]
Thank you, sir.

371
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:15,916
You'll have orders later.
You can go now.

372
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,958
Sir!

373
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,583
[MCGILLIS]
Gundam, huh?

374
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,083
[KUDELIA]
Okay.

375
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,166
Learning how to write your name
is the perfect way to start.

376
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,875
Try making it as
neat as you can.

377
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:40,708
[EMBI] Miss Kudelia!
Look at my writing.

378
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:41,833
Me too!

379
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:43,958
[EMBI]
Did I do it okay?

380
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,583
[KUDELIA]
Let's see.

381
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,916
Huh. You both
did a great job.

382
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,125
[EMBI, ELGAR]
We're awesome!

383
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,333
[grunts]

384
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:53,541
[EMBI, ELGAR]
Huh?

385
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,166
[EMBI, ELGAR laugh]

386
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:55,916
[MIKAZUKI]
Hm?

387
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,083
[KUDELIA]
Hm?

388
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,333
[KUDELIA giggles]

389
00:16:58,416 --> 00:16:59,666
Not too bad.

390
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,125
But a couple of your letters
are kinda backwards.

391
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:04,541
See? And this one too.

392
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:05,208
Huh?

393
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,583
[EMBI, ELGAR laugh]

394
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:11,375
[MIKAZUKI] Okay I knew there
was something wrong with it.

395
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:14,041
I think you should stick
to piloting, Mr. Mikazuki.

396
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,666
Writing isn't your thing.

397
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,375
I can't wait to tell
all the other guys

398
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:18,916
how I beat you at handwriting.

399
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,541
[TAKAKI] Embi, Elgar! You need
to quit running your mouths

400
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,125
and start focusing on practice!

401
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:23,875
Fine.

402
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:25,333
[ELGAR]
I'll race ya!

403
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:27,833
Things are different now that
the adults are all gone!

404
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,208
We're gonna need to man up,

405
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:31,291
and do our best to
contribute to Tekkadan.

406
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:32,416
Do you understand me?

407
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,375
[EMBI, ELGAR]
Yeah.

408
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,000
Takaki is strict.

409
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:36,333
He has to be.

410
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:38,500
He's the leader of all the
younger children here.

411
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:42,250
He's doin' his best so he can
catch up to the rest of us.

412
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,125
Wait, isn't that
spelled with a "d"?

413
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:46,916
But it's pronounced
with a "z", right?

414
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:53,166
[MIKAZUKI]
Huh?

415
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,416
[MIKAZUKI]
Orga?

416
00:17:58,458 --> 00:17:59,458
[BOY SOLDIER A]
Come on, let's go!

417
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:00,875
[BOY SOLDIER B]
Okay!

418
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:01,958
[BOY SOLDIERS grunt]

419
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:04,083
Hey, kids. Watch where
you're runnin'.

420
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,916
[BOY SOLDIER A] I-It won't
happen again, Boss.

421
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,666
Fine. Just be careful.

422
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,541
[BOY SOLDIER A]
Right!

423
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,125
[BOY SOLDIER B]
Sorry, sir.

424
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:12,166
Way to go, dummy!

425
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,000
[BOY SOLDIER A]
Shut up!

426
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:13,625
[BISCUIT]
Orga.

427
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:14,875
[gasps]

428
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:20,416
[BISCUIT] I'm sorry. But without
some kind of connnection,

429
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,291
it'll be almost impossible
to negotiate with Teiwaz.

430
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,041
What should we do?

431
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:27,041
[BISCUIT] I don't know,
but we should be careful

432
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,166
about this before we
make any rash decisions.

433
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:32,625
I've been thinkin'.
Goin' over it again and again,

434
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:35,833
but I can't find a better way
to get us outta this mess.

435
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,958
Try not to take this
the wrong way,

436
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:41,500
but this job may be a little
too much for Tekkadan right now.

437
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,958
I mean, none of us have
any work experience.

438
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,083
[ORGA]
So what, then?

439
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,416
[BISCUIT gasps]

440
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,916
Should we break our promise,
give up on Kudelia,

441
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,708
and hand her over to the first
Gjallarhorn ship we find?

442
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:54,541
No. That's not what I'm saying.

443
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,750
Maybe we could subcontract
another company

444
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,291
to take the job over for us.

445
00:18:58,375 --> 00:18:59,625
[ORGA]
Out of the question.

446
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:03,291
We made a commitment.
We're gonna move forward.

447
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,500
[BISCUIT] Don't you feel like
you're kinda rushing things?

448
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:06,916
[ORGA]
Hm?

449
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,083
To be honest with you, it almost
seems like you're trying

450
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:12,083
to take the most
dangerous path on purpose.

451
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:14,250
[ORGA]
Hm. Maybe.

452
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:15,875
I don't get it.

453
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:19,041
Why are you so stuck on
moving forward, Orga?

454
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,541
Because I'm bein' watched.

455
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,250
[BISCUIT]
Huh?

456
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:26,791
Whenever I turn around,
I see his eyes locked on me.

457
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,416
[BISCUIT]
Whose eyes?

458
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,208
[ORGA]
Mika. That kid's amazing.

459
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:34,791
Through the years,
he's always been so brave.

460
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,541
Mastered a Mobile Suit
in his first battle

461
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:40,000
and now he's learning
to read and write.

462
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,708
I know that when
he's looking at me,

463
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:47,375
it's like he's asking, "Orga,
what are we gonna do next?

464
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:48,791
And what are some
of the new things

465
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,708
that you're gonna
show me, today?"

466
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:53,625
I can't let him down.

467
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:56,250
I can't betray those eyes.

468
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:57,541
[BISCUIT gasps]

469
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:02,708
As far as he's concerned, I need
to be completely fearless.

470
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:05,791
It's because of him that
I've gotta keep my cool.

[gasps]

472
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:12,083
We head to the Teiwaz
headquarters. No changes.

00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:24,708
[MIKAZUKI]
So, you are here.

00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:26,708
[ORGA]
That's right.

[MIKAZUKI]
You were watching us, earlier.

[ORGA]
You knew, huh?

477
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:34,166
Question: Why'd you wanna
learn to read and write

478
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,833
all of the sudden?

479
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,833
Because Kudelia said that
she'd teach me, I guess.

480
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,500
And all of the others, too.

00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:41,791
Ah.

482
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,666
Plus, if I can't
read and write,

483
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,291
I can't help out with
Mobile Suit maintenance.

484
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,958
Also, I can't do it yet,

485
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,916
but some day I want to
read all kinds of books

486
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,458
and try to learn everything
that I can about vegetables.

487
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:55,041
Forgot about that.

488
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:57,458
You did tell me you wanted
to run a farm, didn't you?

489
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:59,583
Just like Biscuit's
grandmother, Sakura.

Mm.

Aw, nah, this is nothin'.

And, you?

Figured the battle the other
day would've worn you out.

Don't worry. I'm fine.

'Cause Earth is still far away.

But you've decided
to go, huh?

[ORGA]
Yeah. The die's been cast.

500

It's up to us to keep going
'till the bitter end, right?

[MIKAZUKI]
Right.

'Cause we finally found a
place where we belong.

As it stands now,

Um, excuse me, Miss Kudelia.

Did I spell all
these words right?

Hm.

Uh. The first

Hm? Oh! It's cool, isn't it?

Huh? It is.

The operation hurts, but I
think I'll have it done again.

It's way too painful!
