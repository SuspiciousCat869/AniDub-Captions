[ORGA gasps, grunts]

5
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,833
So, what do you want
me to do next, Orga?

6
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:33,291
[MIKAZUKI]
Orga...

7
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:35,708
[grunts]

8
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:39,833
[ORGA]
Hey. Mika...

9
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:43,416
[MIKAZUKI] C'mon, man. You can't
keep slackin' off like this.

10
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,833
Think of what'll happen if they
catch us back here again.

11
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:47,500
Yeah, I know. You're right.

12
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:49,916
[YUKINOJO]
Mikazuki! Did you find him?

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,958
[MIKAZUKI]
Yeah.

14
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:52,875
[ORGA grunts]
What's up, Old Man?

15
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:55,541
[YUKINOJO] Now, don't
gimme that. Maruba's callin'.

16
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:56,708
[ORGA]
The president?

17
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:58,041
[YUKINOJO]
Look, guys,

18
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:59,583
I thought we've already
been through this before.

19
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:02,000
[ORGA] Come on. It's the only
place that warm around here.

20
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:03,583
[YUKINOJO]
Gimme a break...

21
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:06,375
--[ORGA] Hey Mika! Time to go.
--This engine room's top secret.

22
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:07,708
[MIKAZUKI]
Right.

23
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:22,875
[MARUBA]
We've received word


24
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,833
from the Chryse
Autonomous Region.


25
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:27,500
Their representative's
daughter's going to Earth,

26
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:29,666
along with her escort.

27
00:01:32,916 --> 00:01:35,291
You boys in the Third Group
are gonna take her.

28
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:38,000
[BOTH gasp]

29
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:42,208
S'cuse me, but are you referring
to Kudelia Aina Bernstein,

30
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:43,458
by any chance?

31
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:45,083
[MARUBA]
Have you heard of her, Biscuit?

32
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:46,458
[BISCUIT]
Indeed, sir.

33
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:48,375
She's involved in the
freedom movement, isn't she?

34
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:51,416
[MARUBA] Right. And her trip to
Earth is about that very thing.

35
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,000
The independence of Mars.
Noble, isn't it?

36
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:58,083
But, why do you want us
to do a big job like this?

37
00:01:58,166 --> 00:02:00,833
Well, actually she
handpicked you guys, herself.

38
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:01,833
[BISCUIT]
What? You mean--

39
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:03,208
Regardless of the assignment,

40
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:05,500
just make sure that you
remember one thing.

41
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:10,000
You little punks are to do
exactly as we say. Understand?

42
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:11,625
[TAKAKI grunts]

43
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:13,041
[DANJI]
This sucks!

44
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:15,416
Can you believe all these
landmine setting drills?

45
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,041
[RIDE] It's like
they're torturing us.

46
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:18,875
Tomorrow, we've
got removal drills.

47
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:19,791
[DANJI]
Oh, man...

48
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:20,916
[explosions]

00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,958
[DANJI]
Hm?

50
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:33,375
[grunts] Damn that kid.
How does he do it?

51
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,208
[gasps, grunts]

52
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:41,500
[AKIHIRO] Mikazuki Augus.
You know how to dodge, don't ya?

53
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:44,291
I gotta pilot those things.
I hope that some day...

54
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:45,833
[SASAI]
What's going on!

55
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:46,541
[grunts]

56
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:47,833
Pick up the pace, kid!

57
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:50,208
Todo, you're suppose to be
keeping 'em in line!

58
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:53,583
[chuckles] All right, brats!
You've got work to do!

59
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:58,125
Oh, jeez... Hmph. These space
rats better settle down.

60
00:02:58,208 --> 00:02:59,833
Takaki, you gonna be okay?

61
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:02,666
[TAKAKI]
Yeah... I'm fine.

62
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,291
[grunts]

63
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:12,625
[SOLDIERS chatter]

64
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:14,708
[EUGENE] They put us in
charge of escorting her?

65
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:18,291
You know a girl like that has
to smell pretty incredible!

66
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:19,750
Right, Mikazuki?

67
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:22,875
Yeah, whatever. She's just
human like the rest of us.

68
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:24,208
Doubt she'd be any different.

69
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:25,458
[SHINO]
Huh?

70
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:26,666
[DANJI] He's clueless
when it comes to girls.

71
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,625
Trust me, you're wasting
your breath.

72
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:28,500
Takaki.

73
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,083
Hey. You need some water?

74
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,708
Why are you wearing
that bandage?

75
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:34,000
Oh, it's no big deal.
Happens all the time...

76
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:36,708
[EUGENE] The president knows.
He sees we're strong.

77
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,458
When an outfit like
ours pulls together,

78
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:42,583
we're unstoppable. Unlike all
of his brown-nosing employees.

79
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,291
I'm tellin' you guys.

80
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:46,583
We're gonna breeze past
those smooth-talkin' jerks

81
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:47,958
and take their place
as First Corps!

82
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:50,666
[ORGA] Listen, no matter
how senile Maruba gets,

83
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,083
he's always gonna
see us as expendable.

84
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,875
So I wouldn't get your hopes
too high if I were you.

85
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,666
[grunts]
Oh yeah?

86
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,208
Well, if that's true, did ya
ever think maybe the reason he

87
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:03,916
sees us that way is 'cause we've
got you for a group leader?

88
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Now, that's enough, Eugene.

89
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:06,750
[EUGENE]
Aw, shut up, Biscuit.

90
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:09,166
Let's not forget
he's the one who--

91
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,708
[groans]

92
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:12,583
Tryin' to start a
fight out here?

93
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:13,625
Don't make me do this.

94
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,291
Hey, let go!
You're tearin' it off!

95
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:18,458
[ORGA] Nah, we're just having a
little disagreement. That's all.

96
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:21,875
Y-Yeah, right.
That's all it is.

97
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:23,125
[EUGENE]
C-Come on, Mikazuki!

98
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:26,083
Really sorry, Akihiro.
They're a little rowdy.

99
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,166
[AKIHIRO]
Same as always.

100
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,208
[KUDELIA]
The time's come, Mother.

101
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:33,833
I'll be leaving now.

102
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:37,541
[TOMOMI] So soon, Aina?
I had no idea.

103
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,291
Please remember to
mind you manners

104
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:41,708
around the peolpe out there

105
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:43,583
[KUDELIA] I always thought
Father didn't like that

106
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:46,333
I was so involved in
the freedom movement.

107
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:49,250
But, this time he's being so
supportive and allowing me

108
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:52,333
to go to Earth as a mediator
between our two sides.

109
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:53,458
[TOMOMI]
It's in your nature

110
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:56,000
to take things
so negatively, Kudelia.

111
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:59,333
Your father's always kept
your best interests at heart.

112
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,458
He truly cares about you.

113
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,916
[KUDELIA] My mother would
rather ignore these things.

114
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,125
She's never made any
effort to understand

115
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,666
what's going on out there.

116
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,791
I refuse to live like that.
I want a better understanding

117
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,625
by experiencing
the truth myself.

118
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:15,583
[FUMITAN] Is that why you chose
Third Group as your escorts?

119
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:18,625
[KUDELIA] Yes. Because these
children are precisely the kind

120
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:21,791
of soldiers born out of the
Earth Sphere's oppressive rule.

121
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:25,125
They embody the problems
burdening each one of us.

122
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,708
By getting to know them
on a more personal level,

123
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:29,291
I hope to share
some of their pain

124
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,583
and let them know that
they are not alone.

125
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,333
[CORAL]
It's beautiful, isn't it?


126
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,833
The delicate nature of youth
and wide-eyed innocence.


127
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:39,750
The Bernsteins are a family
deeply involved with Earth,

128
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,750
yet their daughter's seen
as the leader of the very

129
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:44,125
Independence movement
against it.

130
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:47,958
Ironic, isn't it?
Norman Bernstein.

131
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:50,541
[grunts] My daughter's
been quite foolish.

132
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,875
[CORAL] But, when foolishness
goes that far,

133
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:54,416
it's rather magnificent.

134
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,333
Which is the reason
that Chryse--

135
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:59,208
No-- It's the reason those
bastards all over Mars

136
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,625
support what she's trying to do.

137
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:04,000
Now, then. I'm sure she'd
like nothing more

138
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:08,166
than to live eternally in the
hearts and minds of the people.

139
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,083
So, in a way, you might
say we're helping her.

140
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:13,916
[grunts]
Of course, Sir Coral.

141
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,375
But, please, promise
me you'll be kind.

142
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:19,333
[CORAL] He sells out his
daughter for his own gain,

143
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:22,958
then asks me to be "kind"?
What a pathetic coward.

144
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:25,000
I think he could learn
something from her.

145
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:26,250
[ADJUTANT A]
Sir.

146
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:28,166
[CORAL] But, now that
inspection from Earth

147
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,541
is a golden opportunity.

148
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,125
To receive Nobliss's support,

149
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:35,583
we need to do everything in our
power to ensure this plan works.

150
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:38,916
All right, Orlis,
The mission's been finalized.

151
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,125
You take command, this time.

152
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:41,333
Yes, sir.

153
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:44,125
[CORAL] Crank!
Support your former student.

154
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:44,958
Sir.

155
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:45,625
[CORAL]
Ein!

156
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:46,916
[gasps]
Yes, sir.

157
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,625
[CORAL] This is your
first official assignment.

158
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:49,833
Do your best!

159
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:51,458
[EIN]
I will, sir.

160
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:54,041
[GAELIO]
Mars? Seriously?

161
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:56,458
As a colony, that planet's
resources are all used up,

162
00:06:56,541 --> 00:07:00,000
if you asked me. And that
place is out in the boonies.


163
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:02,541
Do we really need Gjallarhorn
inspectors out there?


164
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,041
I've just confirmed it.

165
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:07,083
Are these frontier operations
boring you, Gaelio?

166
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:10,000
As if. I'll work hard
as an officer

167
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:12,500
of the inspection division,
Major McGills.

168
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:14,875
You can count on me,
as always, Sir.

169
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:16,791
Well, whether we
like it or not,

170
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:20,416
Earth Sphere's economy depends
on that used-up colony.

171
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,041
To succeed, it's imperative
that they can continue

172
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,583
making significant
contributions.

173
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:28,166
So it's of utmost importance
that the Mars Branch

174
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,833
clean up their act and become
proud members of Gjallarhorn:

175
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:34,041
the true keepers
of the world order.

176
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:36,875
I kinda feel bad for
those guys down there.

177
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,083
[MCGILLIS]
The push for independence

178
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,541
is spreading across Mars
at an alarming pace.

179
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:41,500
[GAELIO]
Hm?

180
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:42,833
[MCGILLIS]
Before much longer,

181
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:45,208
we may be too busy to
worry about anybody else.

182
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:46,583
[YOUNG SOLDIER A]
We're supposed to start heading

183
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,666
down to the south
route to Block D.

184
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,666
[Young soldier B]
I'm tired.

185
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,666
[Young soldier C]
Let's get goin'.

186
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:55,708
[SOLDIERS snoring]

187
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:06,208
[MIKAZUKI, AKIHIRO grunt]

188
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:07,916
[AKIHIRO]
Muscle weighs more.

189
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,583
M-My body's just heavier
than yours, all right?

190
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,291
[MIKAZUKI] Yeah, keep tellin'
yourself that.

191
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:13,750
[AKIHIRO grunts]
Hey!

192
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:16,416
[YUKINOJO] Okay Just finished
checkin' the equipment

193
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,625
for your trip.

194
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,166
[ORGA]
Good job, man.

195
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,583
[YUKINOJO] So, she's supposed
to come down tomorrow, huh?

196
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:25,000
[ORGA] Yeah. And, then we'll
get goin' the day after.

197
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,916
I figure it should take
us about five months

198
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,500
to make it to Earth and back.

199
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,666
[YUKINOJO] It's gonna
be quiet around here.

200
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:34,166
I heard she picked
you herself. Not bad.

201
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,041
You gotta be kiddin' me.

202
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:38,791
We're just being used.
Same as always.

203
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,791
Maruba thinks we're
nothin' but a buncha rats

204
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:43,625
runnin' around this place.
He just knows we can

205
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:46,916
move a little faster
thanks to our "Whiskers".

206
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,833
Yeah, those things...

207
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:53,041
The old Man-Machine Interface,
the Alaya-Vijnana System.

208
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,500
They're just 's awful.

209
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,583
[ORGA] Yeah, but ...
having it implanted

210
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,708
is the price you pay
if you wanna work here.

211
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,250
[YUKINOJO]
Well, guess it's better than

212
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,333
not having a job at all.

213
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:05,208
[chuckles] I still remember
back when you got yours.

214
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:06,958
They didn't give
you any anesthesia,

215
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,375
but you didn't cry once.

216
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:10,625
Then you got punched
for being a wise ass.

217
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:13,416
[ORGA] If I cried,
I would've been punched, too.

218
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,666
Anyway, Third Group
doesn't mean crap here.

219
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,041
They either smack
us for a few laughs,

220
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,333
or use us as human shields.

221
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:24,500
But... I won't let 'em
take away my pride.

222
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:27,291
I can't show any weakness.

223
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,625
To Mikazuki, you mean?

224
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:30,833
[ORGA chuckles]

225
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:34,958
It must be tough, Captain.

226
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,083
[PROTESTERS shouting]

227
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,875
[PROTESTER 0A] We demand
independence from Earth

228
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:43,208
for the Chryse
Autonomous Region!

229
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,416
[PROTESTERS]
Independence!

230
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,166
[PROTESTER A] That's right!
No more colonial rule!

231
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,041
[PROTESTERS]
No more!

232
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,916
[PROTESTER A]
Protect the autonomy of Mars.

233
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,958
[ATRA hums]

234
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:03,416
[HABA]
You're in a good mood.

235
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,750
[ATRA gasps, grunts]

236
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,166
I-I'm sorry.

237
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,833
[HABA] It's fine. With the
protest going on outside,

238
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:13,791
I don't think we'll have
customers anyway.

239
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:16,083
I know. It's for
that boy, isn't it?

240
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:18,000
[ATRA gasps]

241
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:18,791
Oh, uh...

242
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,208
[HABA]
I understand.

243
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:22,333
He's got a big job and
you're gonna miss him

244
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:24,208
while he's gone, aren't you?

245
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,666
Make sure you finish it by
tomorrow's deliveries.

246
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,166
[ATRA]
Yes, ma'am.

247
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:32,750
[MARUBA] It's truly an honor
to have you here with us.

248
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:35,583
I've admired your political
activism for quite some time,

249
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:36,583
Miss Kudelia.

250
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:37,833
--[MARUBA chuckles]
--[knocking]

251
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:39,041
[MARUBA]
Come in.

252
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,541
Hello, sir. Third Group
reporting in, as requested.

253
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:46,416
[MARUBA] All right.
These are the young men

254
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,208
who'll be escorting
you to Earth.

255
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:53,166
Nice to meet you.
I'm Kudelia Aina Bernstein.

256
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:56,333
Hey, there.

257
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:57,958
What's up? My name is--

258
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:00,375
[HAEDA] Don't you even know how
to greet someone properly?

259
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,333
Unbelievable!

260
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,916
[MARUBA] Now, where were we?
About tomorrow's schedule...

261
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,541
[KUDELIA]
And, you...?

262
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,208
[MIKAZUKI grunts]

263
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,791
[KUDELIA]
What's your name?

264
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:11,416
I'm Mikazuki Augus. Hello.

265
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,083
[KUDELIA] Would it be
possible for you to show me

266
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,083
around this place?

267
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,250
--[MIKAZUKI] Huh?
--[MARUBA] What?

268
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,958
Fumitan? I'll leave
the rest up to you.

269
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,250
Of course, as you wish.

270
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:19,916
[MARUBA]
Uh...

271
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,125
Okay then, Mikazuki.

272
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,666
[FUMITAN]
I hope you don't mind.

273
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,708
I believe you wanted to
discuss our schedule?

274
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:25,708
[MARUBA]
B-But...

275
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,250
'Kay, follow me.

276
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,250
[MARUBA]
I, uh...

277
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,708
[KUDELIA]
Hey! Wait! Come back!

278
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:35,166
[MIKAZUKI] So, behind this
is the engine room.

279
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,708
[KUDELIA]
S'cuse me--

280
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:38,291
[MIKAZUKI] And we have our own
Ahab Reactor down here too.

281
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:39,875
[KUDELIA]
Um... Hold on!

282
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:40,958
[MIKAZUKI]
Uh?

283
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:43,416
[KUDELIA pants]

284
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,708
[KUDELIA]
Um...Let's shake hands.

285
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,458
It's nice to meet you.

286
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:52,583
[MIKAZUKI]
Uh...

287
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:54,041
Is everything all right?

288
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,000
[MIKAZUKI grunts]

289
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,541
[KUDELIA]
I hope this is okay.

290
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,500
I just wanted you to show you
that I see you as an equal.

291
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:01,666
I can't do it 'cause my hands
are really dirty right now.

292
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,333
[gasps]

293
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,708
Of course. I only...

294
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:09,958
[MIKAZUKI] Oh well. I guess
that means the two of us

295
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,541
weren't on equal
terms to begin with.

296
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,125
[gasps]

297
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,875
[BISCUIT]
You can't get to sleep, Orga?

298
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:24,041
[ORGA] And it looks
like you can't, either.

299
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:25,833
Something just
doesn't seem right.

300
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:29,708
[BISCUIT] Indeed. I mean, to me,
Kudelia's just some naïve girl,

301
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,333
but I know how
important she really is

302
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:34,208
and what she represents.
Even Gjallarhorn could act

303
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:36,666
against somebody
like that influential.

304
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,250
So what does she want with a
little outfit like ours, anyway?

305
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:42,916
I don't know. It's not like we
have a choice now, anyway.

306
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,083
But, if this whole
thing's a trap,

307
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,416
we'd better be ready
to crush 'em.

[SUBORDINATE A] The transmission
with headquarters

00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:54,416
[MCGILLIS]
Good.

311
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,625
[GAELIO]
Depending on the relay point

312
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,208
for our communications
is pretty annoying.

313
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:00,500
I'll probably never
get used to this.

314
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,625
[MCGILLIS] The Ahab Reactor
creates the kind of energy

315
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:05,958
that not only powers the ship,
but also makes it possible

316

to sustain life in space.

317
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:11,541
We have no choice but to
ignore some of the downsides.

318
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,583
[GAELIO] But that's the
very reason why Earth

319
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,458
has trouble seeing this far.

320
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:18,000
It only makes more work
for all of us inspectors.

321
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:21,333
This was practically the cause
of the war 300 years ago,

wasn't it?

323
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,708
But it isn't always easy to
let go of a power like that,

324
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:28,333
once you obtain it.
I suppose it's human nature.

325
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,250
We'll stop at nothing,

326
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:33,541
even if it's a power that
could destroy us all.

00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:37,250
Right, Biscuit?

462
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,166
So true.

463
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,500
[beeping]

464
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:40,208
[TODO]
Huh?

465
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,666
[TODO shouts]

466
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,791
[YOUNG SOLDIER E]
What is that?

467
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:44,125
[YOUNG SOLDIER F]
A signal flare?

468
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:46,666
[EUGENE gasps]
Who did that? First Corps?

469
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,666
[ORGA] Yeah. Looks like those
guys are gonna help us out

470
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,541
and be our decoys after all.

471
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:54,083
[HAEDA] All right! What were
you thinkin', Todo? Tell me!

472
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,125
C'mon, I didn't do anything.
You've gotta believe me!

473
00:18:56,208 --> 00:19:00,291
[HAEDA growls]
Those little brats!

474
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:02,500
[SHINO]
Whoa! The enemy is moving!

475
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:03,625
I bet they are.

476
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:04,875
[EUGENE]
Huh?

477
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,791
If I'm right about this.
They're gonna make sure

478
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:09,166
that nobody gets
outta this base alive.

479
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,500
[YUKINOJO]
Yamagi! Number 12!

480
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:11,666
[YAMAGI]
Yeah--

481
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,666
Hold on! You guys,
I can try and help, too.

482
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,208
[YUKINOJO]
It's too dangerous, Miss.

483
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:16,083
Just stand back!

484
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:17,291
[KUDELIA sighs]

485
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:19,958
Aren't those...?

486
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,666
[BOTH]
The landmines we buried!

487
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:22,833
Awesome!

488
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:26,458
Okay! Let's take
'em down, you guys!

489
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:27,250
[gasps]

490
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,000
[ORGA]
What?

491
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,250
Is that artillery?

492
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,041
[BOTH grunt]

493
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:32,416
No way!

494
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,625
[YOUNG SOLDIER G]
What's goin' on?

495
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:34,791
[YOUNG SOLDIER G gasps]

496
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,500
[ORLIS] Can anyone explain
why it's taking so long

497
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,083
to neutralize a
facility like this?

498
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,416
Wait what?

499
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,500
[ORLIS] All of you Mobile
Workers are gonna get

500
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:48,041
a cut in pay.

501
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:49,333
[CRANK]
Orlis!

502
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:52,916
Why did you open fire?
Our objective here is--

503
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,166
You keep your mouth shut, Crank,
I'm the one in charge now.

504
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,416
[grunts]

505
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,333
[ORLIS] If the objective
is so damn important,

506
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:01,166
why don't you go
find her, yourself?

507
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,125
Ein, you too.

508
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:04,041
[gasps]
Y-Yes, sir.

509
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:07,500
[EUGENE] Impossible! We can't
win against Mobile Suits.

510
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,208
What are we supposed
to do now?

511
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,500
L-Let's go.

512
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:11,333
We're trapped.

513
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,541
[ORGA]
We are.

514
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:18,083
There's no place we can run.
There never was...

515
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,750
...right, Mika?

516
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:26,041
Yeah. So, what do you
want me to do next, Orga?

517
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,458
[chuckles]

518
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:35,416
[laughs] I'll squash you
all like little bugs!

519
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,250
[EIN] Lieutenant Crank,
Captain Orlis--

520
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,250
No use stopping him.

521
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:42,041
If we could've
deployed here sooner,

522
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,458
we wouldn't have had so
many casualties laid out

523
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:46,416
all over the battlefield.

524
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,291
[ORGA] Hold your positions.
We just need to stay put

525
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,250
till Mika gets back here.

526
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,625
And,when he does,
we'll deliver the final blow.

527
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:58,833
We can all get outta this
rotten place. Are we clear?

528
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:01,500
The base! Stop it!

529
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,750
My friends are still inside.

530
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:09,333
Danji! No! Danji!

531
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:13,166
Gotta keep moving. Just a
little longer. Just a little--

532
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,625
[EUGENE]
Orga! It's looking this way.

533
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:21,458
[ORLIS] So, tell me.
Are you the one in charge here?

534
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:25,041
[EUGENE]
We're all gonna die!

535
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:29,208
[ORGA] We're not gonna die.
We'll never die.

536
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:30,875
Not like this.

537
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,750
[ORGA]
Not fighting out here.

538
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:41,000
This is not the end!

539
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:41,875
[laughs]

540
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:44,291
[ORGA]
Is it, Mika?!

541
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,125
[ORGA grunts]

542
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:04,916
[MIKAZUKI] So, what do you
want me to do next, Orga?

543
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:08,875
[ORGA]
It's clear to me now.

544
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:10,291
[MIKAZUKI]
Huh?

545
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,666
[ORGA]
We're going.

546
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,291
[MIKAZUKI]
Where?

547
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:22,208
[ORGA]
Anywhere but here.

548
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:31,666
[ORGA] To a better place.
Where you and me belong.

549
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,291
[grunts]

550
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:35,166
[MIKAZUKI]
Let's go.

551
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:37,625
All of us...

552
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:38,875
...together.

553
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:43,916
♪

554
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,166
[ATRA] I really hope
he likes the bracelet

555
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,541
that I made for him.

556
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:16,791
I wonder if he'll
always wanna wear it.

557
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:19,958
Ew... It'll probably
start to smell bad.

558
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,083
Well, maybe he should try
and air it out in the sun

559
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:23,708
once and a while.

560
00:24:23,791 --> 00:24:26,833
But, he won't be able to
if he goes out into space.

561
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:29,416
What am I gonna do?

562
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:33,916
Next time on <i>Mobile Suit</i>
<i>Gundam: Iron Blooded Orphans,</i>
