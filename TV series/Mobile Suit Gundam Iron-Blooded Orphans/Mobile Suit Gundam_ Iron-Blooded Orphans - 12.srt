Our ship is carrying
Ahab Reactors.

Without any Adriadne signals,

it should be impossible

They know things
about our ships,

Smells like a rat to me.

Only Teiwaz knew our route.
At least, that's what I thought.

Is that right?

42
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:56,000
Our own navigation officer
came up with it by herself.

43
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:59,333
Of course, we logged it in to
Teiwaz before we left Saisei.

44
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:00,875
Then if our info was leaked,

45
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:03,208
it would have to have come
from someone back there.

[BISCUIT] Could something
like that really happen?

Once an organization gets

it's not that easy to monitor

We could do that,

[BISCUIT] Yeah. After the
Calamity War came to an end,

A passage runs through it
almost like a secret corridor.

71
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:46,291
[CHAD] Why has all the debris
clumped together like that?

72
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:49,041
[BISCUIT] Ahab Reactors have
a fairly long shelf life.

Many of them are still
perfectly operational.

[CHAD] So the gravity
from the reactors

is attracting the debris.

00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:11,916
[LAFTER]
Hey, don't worry about it.

158
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,708
Besides, aren't you rescuing
Akihiro's brother?

159
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,250
Once I heard that,

160
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,708
there's no way I could just
sit back and let you go solo.

161
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,625
[FUMITAN]
Barbatos and Hyakuri

162
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,916
are on their
second acceleration.

163
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,333
Good. Then it's
our turn to move!

164
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:27,708
[CREW]
Yes, sir.

165
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,166
[MASAHIRO]
Hm? Where'd you get that?

166
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,750
[BREWER A grunts]
No way. We had extra?

167
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:46,625
It's Pedro's. Guess the staff
left it here by mistake.

168
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:50,125
I see... Sorry, man.

169
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,916
Yeah, I know it sucks...

170
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,791
...but maybe Pedro's been
reborn somewhere better.

171
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,083
What're you talkin' about?

172
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,541
Well uh...

173
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:00,750
I heard that's what happens
whenever humans pass away.

174
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,291
They don't stay dead.
They get to come back.

175
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:04,875
[BREWER A]
But, how does that work?

176
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,583
[BREWER D] They're born
from their mom's belly

177
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:10,125
and then they become
babies all over again.

178
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:13,458
They forget everything and get
a chance to redo their life.

179
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:18,500
But that's only for humans,
isn't it? Not us Debris.

180
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,625
We die. That's all there is.

181
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,041
[BREWERS sigh]

182
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:23,458
We don't know for sure, though.

183
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:25,875
If I'm reborn, I'll be rich and
get to eat steak every--

184
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:28,208
[KUDAL]
So you want to be reborn, huh?

185
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:29,708
[BREWER A gasps]

186
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:32,000
[KUDAL] No problem! We can try
it right now, if you like.

187
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,583
--Well?
--[BREWER A grunts]

188
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,250
[KUDAL] You need to
stop talking nonsense,

189
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,375
and finish up in here, brats!

190
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,541
There's a lot of
work to be done.

191
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,750
[BREWER A grunts]

192
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,666
[KUDAL]
Hey.

193
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,166
Yes, sir?

194
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:51,125
Try not to screw things
up next time, kid.

195
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:54,791
If you fail again, it won't
just be you who get punished.

196
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:58,416
I'll throw all of you naked into
the cold, dark, void, got it?

197
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,291
So don't test me.

198
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,041
[MASAHIRO]
Sir.

199
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,125
[LAFTER]
We'll enter the corridor soon.

200
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,958
Oh. So it isn't a tunnel
like I thought it was, huh?

201
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,541
[LAFTER] You can't see
it with the naked eye,

202
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,458
if that's what you mean.

203
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,166
Uh... what are you doing?

204
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,500
[MIKAZUKI]
Studying.

205
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:18,291
[LAFTER]
Oh, I see.

206
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:21,666
Oh, communications with
the ship will be cut soon.

207
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,541
[SHINO] You're out here
pretty early, Akihiro.

208
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,000
[AKIHIRO]
Hm?

209
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:34,625
You've still got plenty
of time before dispatch.

210
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:37,541
Shouldn't you rest up a
little before heading out?

211
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,791
No. I'm fine here.

212
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:42,541
[SHINO]
Hmph. If you say so...

213
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,333
[FUMITAN] It seems
data links with Barbatos

214
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,000
and Hyakuri have been severed.

215
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,625
It's almost time, then.

216
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:51,083
Look at that. There's even
more debris around us.

217
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:56,583
Eugene, take the helm.

218
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:57,583
Huh?

219
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,916
Times like this,
it's gotta be you.

220
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,416
You're the best choice here.

221
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,041
[gasps]

222
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,083
Jeez! No pressure, right?

223
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,833
Fine. I'll babysit
you guys again.

224
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,291
[OPERATOR A] I'm linking
our navigation system

225
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,166
with the <i>Isaribi's</i> .

226
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,750
That's it, boys.

227
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:17,458
Now we're completely dependent
on you to get us through this.

228
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:20,333
We'll have our eyes closed
until then, so be gentle.

229
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:21,708
[ORGA]
Got it.

230
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:24,708
[FUMITAN] We'll be entering
an area of dense debris.

231
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,958
Any impacts could
cause the ship to shake.

232
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:29,208
All crew should be on alert.

233
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,166
It's finally starting.

234
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,583
[sighs]

235
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:40,833
[gasps]

236
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:43,916
Mikazuki will be all right.

237
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,416
I know it.

Yeah...

All right.

Tsk.

00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,916
[ORGA]
Let's go.


243
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,833
[LAFTER] Okay, we should be
getting closer to the point.

244
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,083
[MIKAZUKI]
I can't see anything.

245
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:20,708
Stay sharp. They could
find us at anytime now.

246
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,708
[BREWER OPERATOR] Man Rodi
on patrol, reporting:

247
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:29,083
We've spotted enemy
Mobile Suits approaching.

248
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,750
The rats are trapped.

249
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,833
[chuckles]
Send out our Mobile Suits.

250
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:39,875
They're here.

[BREWER B] That white one!
I'll avenge Pedro.

252
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,458
[KUDAL] They can't use long
distance communication here.

253
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,625
You need to cut
their numbers. Quickly!

254
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:51,333
Just don't forget
the main target

255
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,666
is the hunk of junk
that's following them.

256
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,416
Surround them and don't let
them get back to their ship.

Yes, sir.

[BREWER A] Don't rush.
Block their escape route.

Drive them towards our ship.

out here, I can barely maneuver!

from their scouts.

make them suffer!

sign of their ship?

Huh? It can't be!

Ah! They came cutting
through the Debris Zone?

the "Hammerhead".
Whaddya say?

Yes, sir! All crew,
prepare for impact.

Impossiblle!

How'd we let them ambush us?
Now what are we gonna do?

301
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,708
We can't afford to back
down on this job.

302

Gjallarhorn doesn't hand
them out to just anyone.

This is our golden ticket.

we'll gain their support!

Hey, you don't have
to tell me that, boss.

Listen close, kids.

469
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:15,041
I'm about to teach you the
basics of good business.

470
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:19,041
First, "Quickly and Carefully,"
that should be your motto.

471
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:21,583
Now, this next part
is really important:

472
00:24:21,666 --> 00:24:22,916
No matter what happens,

473
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,291
you should never mix
business with pleasure.

474
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:26,666
Understand?

475
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:29,500
If you can do that,
then you've got it made.

476
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:31,083
So go for it!

477
00:24:31,166 --> 00:24:35,000
Next time on <i>Mobile Suit</i>
<i>Gundam: Iron Blooded Orphans,</i>

00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:37,875
Episode 13,
"Funeral Rites."

00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:39,083
I love you.
