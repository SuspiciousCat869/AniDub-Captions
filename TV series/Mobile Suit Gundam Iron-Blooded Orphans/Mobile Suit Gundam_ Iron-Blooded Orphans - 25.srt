That's right, Gaelio.

Come at me
with your hatred.

Use your fury against me.

Friendship, love, trust...

Such soft-hearted emotions.

they won't reach me.

What I told you
before was the truth.

If I'm going to lead Gjallarhorn
in the right direction,

I needed you as I do Ein.

And for as long
as I can remember,

you were my only friend. Truly.

[EIN]
He tried to save you.

He showed you mercy
and you repaid him

by pulling him
into a cold grave!

He's reacting way too
fast for me to hit him.

Or your friends. Never!

Sorry to worry you, Alesi.

Though I see it's
no different in here.

[CHAIRMAN A] Mr. Makanai, please
give your general policy speech.

[MAKANAI]
Wait.

231
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:01,166
I will use the time given.

232
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:04,000
However, there's someone
here who wishes to speak

233
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:06,250
even more than I do.

00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,625
Uh... Are you
certain that's okay?

246
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:35,666
[KUDELIA] My name is
Kudelia Aina Bernstein.

247
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,833
Recently, I came
from Mars to negotiate

248
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:41,750
with the former
Prime Minister Makanai.

249
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:45,875
And I'm here now because he's
graciously allowed me this time.

250
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:48,250
You have no right to
speak in this Parliament!

251
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,500
During the course of
my long journey here,

252
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:54,916
Gjallarhorn interfered several
times with lethal intent.

253
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,625
And now, my
comrades are fighting

254
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:00,666
that same interference
outside of these very walls.

255
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,375
[TAKAKI]
Boss, can you hear me?

256
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:06,958
I put up all the
LCS drones we have.

257
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:09,000
You should be able to
reach everybody now.

258
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,125
[ORGA]
Good job.

259
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:12,750
It's Orga!

260
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,750
Can you all hear me?

261
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:18,833
Makanai and Kudelia
have reached Parliament.

262
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:21,875
Looks like our
job was a success.

263
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:23,708
So...

264
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:25,541
Stay alive out here!

265
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:28,875
Don't go dying on me.

266
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:33,666
If anyone disobeys, so help
me, I'll kill you again!

267
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,916
Do whatever it takes
to keep on breathing!

268
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,708
Live! Even if you
have to die trying!

269
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,250
That's our leader,

270
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:46,500
and something tells me
he's wanted to give

271
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:48,458
that order for some time.

272
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,375
But it's been hard for him.

273
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,958
Don't die--live.

274
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:56,291
It's pretty simple when
you put it into words.

275
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:58,458
Guess he couldn't
say 'em before.

276
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,375
It just wasn't the right time.

277
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,250
[ORGA]

His movements are...

280
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:15,125
[KUDELIA] There's a great
injustice taking place,

281
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:18,375
and that's the inequality
between Earth and Mars.

282
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:21,291
I tried to fix it,
but now I realize

283
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:24,250
that there's an even
greater disparity.

284
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:27,208
This Parliament, a place
where I thought everything

285
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:30,791
could be resolved,
is actually no different.

286
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:36,000
However, those of you who
are assembled here today...

287
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,416
You have the power
to oppose and right

288
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,291
this disproportionate wrong.

289
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,291
It's your choice.

290
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:46,708
So I beg you.
Please, choose hope!

291
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:50,041
[EIN]
You won't win!

292
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:58,166
[EIN] This is the end
of your useless struggle,

293
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,750

you doing, Mika?!

and frame with one stroke?!

297

[MIKAZUKI] I finally
understand how to use this.

298
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,833
I can't believe
it was so simple.

299

Shut up.

so much noise out here

00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,083
[ATRA]
Yes.

320
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:27,958
I'm sure of it.

321
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:30,625
You were awesome,
Miss Kudelia.

322
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,291
[ORGA]
Mika.

323
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,833
[MIKAZUKI]
Hey, Orga.

324
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:38,375
[ORGA]
Hm?

325
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:39,833
[MIKAZUKI]
Did we make it?

326
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:40,916
[ORGA]
Huh?

327
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,833
Is this it?

328
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,666
The place where we belong.

329
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:49,250
[ORGA]
Yeah, it is.

330
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:50,708
At least one of them.

331
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,125
[MIKAZUKI]
I see.

332
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,541
[MIKAZUKI]
It's beautiful.

333
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:00,958
[MAKANAI]
Hm...

334
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:03,333
In regard to the
half-metal resources,

335
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:06,875
I'd say the rough draft looks
promising in its current form.

336
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:09,333
We'll discuss the
details in due course.

337
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,666
Certainly, that
sounds just fine.

338
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,750
Thank you for
arranging everything.

339
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:17,250
I appreciate it.
So does Tekkadan.

340
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,708
They certainly
deserve their reward.

341
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:22,166
It's been four days, right?

342
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,375
Do they still plan
on leaving here tomorrow?

343
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,416
What will you do after that?

344
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,291
[KUDELIA]
I suppose...

345
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,041
[MCGILLIS] Your exile
destination is ready, Father.

346
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,708
It's time to go.

347
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:37,000
[IZNARIO]
McGillis, you...

348
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:39,375
You have only a few
moments to leave here.

349
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,916
The Inspection Bureau
can be ruthless.

350
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,166
Besides your prison sentence,
our family line could end.

351
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,000
Just who are you to say that?

352
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:48,250
It's all your-- 

353
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,416
[MCGILLIS] Right now,
it's time to be patient.

354
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,291
If you do not stand down,

355
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,625
you will never
come back here again.

356
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:57,250
Please, just leave
the rest to me.

357
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,791
I will protect the
Fareed family name.

358
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:05,708
[IZNARIO] You do understand,
don't you, McGillis?

359
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:09,625
Forgetting your debt to me
after I saved you from despair

360
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:12,833
will only insure that
misery awaits you.

361
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:17,166
[MCMURDO] Arbrau's
proposed hiring Tekkadan

362
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,125
as their military advisor.

363
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:20,708
Interesting, isn't it?

364
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:23,500
Distrust of Gjallarhorn
is spreading like wildfire

365
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:26,125
throughout the other
economic blocks as well.

366
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:28,458
I've no doubt each one
will begin expanding

367
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:32,083
their military forces without
relying on them at all.

368
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:33,833
[MCMURDO] A shift like
that will surely move

369
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:36,583
at an accelerated pace
in the Outer Spheres.

370
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:39,625
Soon you'll be benefiting from
those business opportunities.

371
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,666
Not as much as you
will with Tekkadan

372
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,666
in your back pocket.

373
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,500
The half-metal issue is
beginning to heat up, also.

374
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,000
Looks like we'll both
be busy. Won't we?

375
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,041
[TODO]
Are you deaf?

376
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:53,083
I said I'm here to pick him up.

377
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,416
[BUTLER 25A]
I'm sorry, sir,

378
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,000
but what exactly is your
relation with Mr. Fareed?

379
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:59,708
Well I suppose
you could say I'm...

380
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,666
...his right-hand man.

381
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,291
[ALMIRIA crying]

382
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:09,083
Macky, I miss him so much.

383
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:11,000
[MCGILLIS]
Be strong, Almiria.

384
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:14,000
You wouldn't want
Gaelio to see your tears.

385
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,208
[ALMIRIA]
You...

386
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:18,000
You won't go anywhere, will you?

387
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:20,541
No, of course not.

388
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:21,958
[YUKINOJO] Start loading
the ones that can't run

389
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,083
on their own.

390
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,708
We're leaving tomorrow.

391
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:26,666
Move like you got a purpose!

392
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,250
[SOLDIERS]
Yes, sir!

393
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,666
[EUGENE] It's hard to believe
we're finally going back home.

394
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:34,750
I just hope the ones we lost
can finally rest in peace.

395
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,166
Me too.

396
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:39,083
We'll have to explain
things to Cookie and Cracker.

397
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,375
And they're gonna
cry, I'm sure.

398
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:42,541
[EUGENE sighs]

399
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:44,250
So try to break it
to them easy, Eugene.

400
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,250
[gasps]

401
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,541
[EUGENE]
No way! You tell 'em!

402
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:48,958
Idiots.

403
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:50,291
[RIDE]
It's all right, guys.

404
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,125
Maybe you should
get me to do it.

405
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:53,833
[EUGENE]
Huh? Seriously?

406
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:55,708
[TAKAKI] Ride, what are
you doing out here?

407
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,291
You still need plenty of rest!

408
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:58,708
With all they've been through,

409
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:00,666
I honestly didn't think
those kids would ever

410
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,541
be able to return.

411
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,458
Return to what?

412
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:05,916
To being children again.

413
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,583
[YUKINOJO chuckles]
They're still brats, all right.

414
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:09,833
That'll never change.

415
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:12,625
[ECO, LAFTER sobbing]

416
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:13,791
[NAZE]
There, there.

417
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,916
You did well.
I'm so proud of you.

418
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,416
Well it doesn't sound
like you mean it.

419
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,958
You can do a lot
better than that!

420
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:20,791
You're not going to join in?

421
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,208
I don't think so...

00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:24,958
[AMIDA]
You're adorable.

423
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:27,125
[AZEE]
Hey. Please stop, Amida.

424
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,791
[ORGA] Brother, sorry for all
the trouble we caused you.

425
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,458
[NAZE]
Hey, cut it out, would ya?

426
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:36,416
You guys did a
great job out there.

427
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,041
So be proud of yourselves.

428
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,208
[ORGA]
I don't know...

429
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:43,125
We lost a lot of our family.

430
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,541
[NAZE]
I see.

431
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:48,208
Then are you saying what
you told me before was a lie?

432
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:50,916
You said you were finished
taking orders from idiots,

433
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,166
and having your
friends die in vain.

434
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,791
As the boss of Tekkadan,

435
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:58,416
you are the one
who is in charge.

436
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,916
And they died with honor.

437
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,125
[NAZE] Yeah, they were
finally able to perish

438
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:06,583
with some dignity.

439
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,708
So you should be proud, Brother.

440
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:11,000
Proud of those
who've fallen in battle,

441
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:13,500
as well as the ones
who are still with you.

442
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:15,333
No matter what
happens in the future,

443
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:18,541
you have to be the one to
keep believing in your ideals.

444
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:19,791
You're the leader.

445
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:21,916
You have to be unwavering.

446
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,458
No matter what happens,
stay the course.

447
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:28,750
[ORGA]
Right.

00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:30,041
[ATRA]

449
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:31,250
[MIKAZUKI]
Hm?

[ATRA] Hey! Are you
feeling any better now?

451
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:34,791
[MIKAZUKI]
Mm-hmm.

452
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:37,041
This eye still
can't see very well,

453
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:38,500
and this hand is busted.

454
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:39,791
But that's it.

455
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:41,500
Sounds pretty bad.

456
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:43,208
[MIKAZUKI] It moves when
I'm connected to Barbatos

457
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:44,875
with the Alaya-Vijnana.

458
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:47,250
So I can still work, at least.

459
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:48,541
I guess that's good.

460
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:50,000
[MIKAZUKI]
Could be worse.

461
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:53,625
This is what protected
my left arm.

462
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:56,166
Well in that case, I'll use
a thicker thread next time,

463
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,750
and that'll make you even safer.

464
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,375
Think it'd probably
just get in my way.

465

00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:07,625

Oh, I want one too.

00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:12,291
[MIKAZUKI]
What?

00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:15,291
[KUDELIA] It's homework, so you
can study on your way back home.

Oh, yeah, I forgot.

475
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:19,291
You won't be coming
back to Mars with us.

476
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:20,875
My work's just started.

477
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:22,291
Might be a while.

478
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:23,166
[MIKAZUKI]
Thanks a lot.

479
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,583
[KUDELIA]
Not at all.

480
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:25,750
[KUDELIA]
Your hand.

481
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:26,750
Huh?

482
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:29,041
Yeah, it doesn't move anymore.

483
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:30,250
I had no idea...

484
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:32,250
[MIKAZUKI]
Don't cry, okay?

485
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:33,625
I mean it's not like
I'm gonna be able

486
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:36,041
to hold you with this hand.

487
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:38,125
You are so dense
sometimes, you know?

488
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:38,916
Huh?

489
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,958
Miss Kudelia.

490
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,333
What's going on?

491
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:44,541
Between the three of us,

492
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:46,416
you're the one whose
got it the worst.

493
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,083
So whenever you're
having a hard time,

494
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:52,541
we're gonna make you feel
better, that's how this works.

495
00:22:52,625 --> 00:22:53,625
Exactly.

496
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:54,625
[MIKAZUKI]
Huh?

497
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:57,291
[KUDELIA]
Because we're a family.

498
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:02,666
[ORGA] Everyone,
you kicked ass out there.

499
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,541
Thanks to your hard work,

500
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:08,250
we've completed
Tekkadan's very first job!

501
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:11,875
That means this
is just the beginning.

502
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:14,541
From here on,
we'll get even bigger!

503
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:18,666
But for right now,
you've earned yourself

504
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,500
a little R and R.

505
00:23:20,583 --> 00:23:21,833
And one last thing...

506
00:23:21,916 --> 00:23:24,625
Every one of you has a
big bonus coming your way!

507
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:26,458
[ALL]
Yeah!

508
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,500
[MIKAZUKI]
Orga.

509
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:33,625
[ORGA]
Mika.

510
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:37,666
[ORGA]
It's over.

511
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,000
[MIKAZUKI]
Sure is.

512
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:45,041
I uh, got a question.

513
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:47,750
What should we do next, Mika?

514
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:49,958
I think you know
the answer to that one.

515
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:56,583
[ORGA]
You're right. I do.

516
00:23:58,541 --> 00:23:59,875
[ORGA]
Let's go home.

517
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,666
[MIKAZUKI]
To Mars.
