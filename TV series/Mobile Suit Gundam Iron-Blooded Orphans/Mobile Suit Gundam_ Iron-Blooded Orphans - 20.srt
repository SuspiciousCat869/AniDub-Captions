Can I get you something to eat?

Mr. Makanai.

Look, we don't have much time.

Think you could hurry
this up a little?

[MAKANAI] Don't worry
about Gjallarhorn, my boy.

Huh?

205

They won't come here.
I can guarantee that.

206
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:20,375
How can you be
so certain, Mr. Makanai?

207
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:22,666
[MAKANAI] Do you have any
idea which jurisdiction

208
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,833
this island belongs to,
young miss?

209
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:26,291
Uh, that's...

210
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,416
The Oceanian Federation, right?

211
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,291
If Gjallarhorn wanted to come
out here, then they would have

212
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:34,083
to get permission from
the Federation first.

213
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:35,333
Isnt that correct?

214
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:36,791
[MAKANAI]
Absolutely.

I can see you're beautiful

216
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:41,291

How wonderful.

Oh, you're too kind.

219
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,125
But there's no reason for
the Oceanian Federation

220
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:48,708
to harbor people like us.

221

[MAKANAI]
Actually, there is.

222
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:54,916
You're popular. The Federation
is so grateful, they'd probably

223
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,083
give you an award if
they had the chance.

224

What are you talking about?

225

Everything went
better than expected.

00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:04,208
The reforms in
the Dorts, I mean.

Huh?

228
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,666
[MAKANAI] It turned out
to be quite the success.

229
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,375
Apparently, the union
laborers obtained working

230
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:14,125
conditions equal to
those on Earth.

231
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,916
[KUDELIA]
Is that so?

232
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,041
Their wishes came true.
Thank goodness.

233
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:22,458
[MAKANAI]
No, thank you.

234
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:25,083
It was your actions that
triggered the whole thing.

235
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,666
Wait, our actions?

236
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:30,000
[MAKANAI] Yes. I don't know what
will happen from here on out,

237
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,291
but I suspect that
productivity in the Dorts

238
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,291
will drop temporarily.

239
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:37,416
It might hurt the African
Union for the time being,

240
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,166
but for the other
economic blocks,

241
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,833
it will serve as a great boon.

242
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:44,250
And having benefited from
such a magnificent event,

243
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:48,000
the Oceanian Federation would
never sell you to Gjallarhorn.

251
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:06,083
[KUDELIA] Ah,yes, of course.
It's long overdue.

252
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,875
Truth be told,
that's something I have

253
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,208
always wanted to see
realized as well.

258
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,583
[KUDELIA]
B-But why?

259
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,125
[MAKANAI]
Because I fell from power

260
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:21,708
and am currently
living in exile.

261

You what?

263
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:25,750

So...

264
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:26,916
[MAKANAI]
In other words,

265
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,041
I have absolutely no
power over anything.

266
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:33,000
The hell are you sayin'? We came
all the way to Earth just to

267

meet an old fart who
can't do anything

268

but sit around and stroke
his damn beard all day?

269
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,625
[MERRIBIT]
Boss, please!

270
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:41,666
[KUDELIA]
So, that means...

271
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,000
...everything that we've
been doing was pointless?

272
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,208
I'm not saying that, no.

273
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,666
Quite the opposite, in fact.

274

[KUDELIA gasps]

275
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:55,791
There are still ways
to turn this around.


276
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,875
[YUKINOJO]
General assembly meeting?

277
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:02,291
[MERRIBIT]
That's right.

278
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,416
Apparently there's an election
for the prime minister

279
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,500
of Arbrau soon. Mr. Makanai
wants us to take him

280
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,250
where the meeting
is set to be held.

281
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,916
That was his request
as I understood it.

282
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,625
And if hes able to attend,

283
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:16,291
then he'll be elected as
prime minister again?

284
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:17,958
[MERRIBIT]
He seems pretty confident.

285
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,833
All right, then why don't
we just take him there?

286
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,208
[BISCUIT]
No way!

287
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:24,041
Look, Togonosuke Makanai's
been exiled from Arbrau.

288
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:25,916
They're not exactly
going to welcome him.

289
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,666
And, if that weren't bad enough,
I heard his rival Henri Fleurs

290
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,708
has the total support
of Gjallarhorn.

291
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:33,708
[YUKINOJO] You're kidding,
So if we accept,

292
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,208
you're saying we're gonna
have to fight them head on.

293
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:37,666
Talk about annoying.

294
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,416
[ORGA] Yeah, and that's not
even the worst part of it.

295
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,666
[SHINO]
What?

296
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,166
[ORGA]
I understand.

297
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,000
We'll go back and discuss
this with the rest of our crew.

298
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:48,041
[MAKANAI]
Go back?

299
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:50,958
Not good. Not good at all.

300
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:55,500
I think what we have here
is a grave misunderstanding.

301
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:56,875
What do you mean?

302
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,083
[MAKANAI] Do you have a plan
for getting back to Mars

303
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:01,375
in one piece?
Do you even have a ship

304
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,500
that can take you
off this planet?

305
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,708
Why are you saying this?
I don't under--

306
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,083
[MAKANAI]
I told you.

307
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:10,083
The Oceanian Federation
is making sure no one

308
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:13,750
will sell you out to Gjallarhorn
for as long as you're here.

309
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:16,208
However, if the mood struck me,

310
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:19,041
I could change that
of my own volition.

311
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,458
[ORGA]
Was that a threat?

312
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:24,000
[MAKANAI chuckles]
Certainly not.

313
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:27,750
Well, anyway. Take your
time to think it over.

314
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:31,041
I do hope you make
the right choice.

315
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:33,208
No one talks that
way to Tekkadan.

316
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:35,375
Well, what now?

317
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:36,958
[ORGA]
Hm.

318
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:40,750
[KUDELIA] There's no need for
you to be swayed by Mr. Makanai.

319
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,416
Miss Kudelia...

320
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,500
[KUDELIA]
I mean it.

321
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,125
In the end,

322
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:48,541
the reason I've come this far is
because all of you helped me.

323
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,375
And if it wasn't
for your dedication,

324
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:53,000
I couldn't have left
Mars in the first place.

325
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,750
I can't thank you enough.

326
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:58,125
[BISCUIT] Hey, don't mention it.
After all, that was our job.

327
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:01,375
Yes, I know. As of now,

328
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:05,291
that jobs been carried out
to my total satisfaction.

329
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:08,291
So from this point on,
it's all up to me.

330
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:11,625
Everyone, you don't have to
worry about me anymore.

331
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:14,416
You can each follow
your own path.

332
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:17,625
[ORGA]
If only we had one...

333
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:20,583
--[footsteps]
--[ORGA] Hm?

334
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:24,458
Hey, Boss! We're receiving
a QCCS call. Come on!

335
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:27,625
[EUGENE] Hey, what's up?
Can you hear me?

336
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:28,458
Eugene!

337
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:29,625
You're still alive, huh?

338
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:32,583
'Course! Chad and Dante
are all right too.

339
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:35,291
[SHINO chuckles]
Aw, man! You really are tough.

340
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,791
[EUGENE]
You know it.

341
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:40,208
The Oceanian Federation decided
to harbor us for a while.

342
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:41,583
The Turbines too.

343
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:42,958
[BISCUIT]
Are you serious?

344
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:45,458
[EUGENE]
Yeah. It's pretty amazing.

345
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:47,791
They're treating us like
friggin' heroes here.

346
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,333
The beating we gave Gjallarhorn

347
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:50,791
must have really
made an impression.

348
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:51,666
[RIDE]
For real!

349
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,083
We're some hardcore badasses!

350
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:54,250
[RIDE]
Kinda embarrassing...

351
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:57,000
So glad you're safe. Good job.

352
00:14:57,083 --> 00:15:01,458
Ya' bunch of Idiots. Next time,
try calling us sooner.

353
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:05,208
You kidding me? You don't know
what we had to go through.

354
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:09,041
By the way, Naze wanted to know
what was happening down there.

355
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,416
[ORGA]
All right.

356
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,583
Tell Brother I want to talk
to him about somethin'.

357
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,250
[EUGENE]
Understood.

358
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,083
And one more thing.

359
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,125
Biscuit, we need to talk.

360
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,416
Huh?

361
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:26,791
[NAZE] I see. Sounds like
a crafty old fox to me.

362
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:29,458
He isn't going to be
that easy to deal with.

363
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,583
So, what's the plan?

364
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:35,291
[ORGA] Well honestly, the risk
is probably the same either way.

365
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:38,416
I am a little worried.
Isn't Mr. McMurdo expecting

366
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,375
Kudelia's negotiation
with Makanai to go well?

367
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:45,500
[NAZE] Orga. Look, you don't
need to feel obligated

368
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,250
to the old man in any way.

369
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:48,708
[ORGA]
Huh?

370
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:51,250
[NAZE] You've done more than
enough to repay your debt.

371
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:54,000
Besides, I'm sure he
just thinks of this

372
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:57,208
as another one of his gambles.
Don't worry, all right.

373
00:15:57,291 --> 00:16:00,208
You don't need to
consider his feelings.

374
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,041
Now, just forget
about all of that

375
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:04,250
and tell me what
you really think.

376
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,375
I mean which way do
you want to go here?

377
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:10,250
There isn't anything
holding you back.

378
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:14,500
[ORGA] All right. I'm thinking
of taking on Makanai's request.

379
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:16,583
[NAZE] Even if doing that
could possibly endanger

380
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:18,416
the lives of your family?

381
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,208
[ORGA] Either way, we can't
go back to Mars like this.

382
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:24,916
Suppose we did
go back there.

383
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,666
We might get a little fame, be
able to find work for a while.

384
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:33,125
That isn't going
to last too long.

385
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:36,333
We're still nobodies, Brother.

386
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:40,666
And I want for us to become
something much bigger.

387
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,083
[chuckles]

388
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:43,500
[NAZE]
Do what you will.

389
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:45,916
Whatever path you choose,
I'll be ready to help you.

390
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,666
After all, that's what big
brother's are for, right?

391
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,041
[ORGA exhales]

392
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,666
[NAZE] Oh. Are Lafter
and the others okay?

393
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:56,000
[ORGA]
Y-Yeah. I'll get them now.

394
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,750
[LAFTER]
Eco!

395
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:59,666
[AZEE]
You got a call from Naze.

396
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,708
[ECO]
Really? I'll be right there.

397
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:05,375
[footsteps]

398
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:08,958
[ORGA] What'd you and
Eugene talk about?

399
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:11,041
[BISCUIT]
Ah... It was nothing.

400
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,375
[ORGA]
Well, I've decided.

401
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:17,333
I'm taking on Makanai's request.
If there's a risk either way,

402
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:20,041
figure it's better to take the
one with a bigger return.

403
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:20,791
Don't you think?

404
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,500
[BISCUIT exhales]

405
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,083
[ORGA]
Biscuit?

406
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:24,958
[BISCUIT]
Let's go back.

407
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,375
Huh?

408
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,625
[BISCUIT]
We did all we set out to do.

409
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:31,125
I think its time
for us to head home.

410
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,250
Teiwaz might give us a
ride if we travel lightly

411
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:34,750
and leave everything here.

412
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:36,625
[ORGA]
But we cant do that.

413
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:38,041
[BISCUIT gasps]

414
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:41,333
If we only do small jobs
on Mars, we'd just go back

415
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:44,416
to being nothing but
punk-ass kids again.

416
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,750
We'll get taken advantage
of like before.

417
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,875
We have to rise above all that.

418
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:53,250
Higher than Teiwaz.
Even higher than Makanai.

419
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:54,166
[ORGA]
Steal from them if--

420
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,291
[BISCUIT]
Just stop it!

421
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,000
[ORGA gasps]

422
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:59,958
'Cause we've done more
than enough as it is.

423
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:02,458
Please. You're not thinking
about the rest of us.

424
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,375
There must be a way
to go back to Mars

425
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,125
without having to endanger
everybody's lives.

426
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:09,666
I don't think about my friends?
Is that what you're saying?

427
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,250
That's not what I mean!

428
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:14,083
I'm asking you not to purposely
take the dangerous path, Orga.

429
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:15,291
It's totally reckless!

430
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,291
I thought long and
hard about this!

431
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:20,333
It might be tough, but I know
it's what's best for our future.

432
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:21,833
[BISCUIT] What if we
get ourselves into this

433
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,833
and somebody dies along the way?

434
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:26,375
Because then there wont
be a future. Not for them!

435
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:29,041
I've decided! We have
to move forward!

436
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:31,583
Listen to me! If you do, I'll...

437
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:33,833
You'll what?

438
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,541
[BISCUIT]
I'll quit Tekkadan.

439
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,083
[ORGA gasps]

440
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,083
[ORGA]
Hey! Biscuit!

441
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:42,541
[gasps]

442
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,125
[BISCUIT]
A message?

443
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:49,750
[EUGENE] Yeah. It was forwarded
to us from the Dort Colonies.

444
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:52,666
It's... It's from
your older brother.

445
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,291
[BISCUIT]
Wait, Savarin?

446
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,916
[BISCUIT sobs]

447
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,916
[gasps]

448
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,791
Uh, Boss?

449
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:02,125
[ORGA grunts ]

450
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:05,291
[MERRIBIT] You scared me.
Is something the matter?

451
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:06,708
[ORGA]
No.

452
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:10,416
[MERRIBIT sighs]

453
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,708
[ORGA]
I've made up my mind.

454
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:14,666
We're gonna take on
Makanai's request.

455
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,541
If he's made Prime Minister,

456
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:19,166
it's good for
Teiwaz's business, right?

457
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,958
[MERRIBIT exhales]

458
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:24,541
[ORGA] I had no idea
Biscuit felt that way at all.

459
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,833
Is that what this is about?

460
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,250
I didn't think he'd
take it that far.

461
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:32,125
[MERRIBIT] It might have to
do with what Eugene told him.

462
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,000
[ORGA]
Huh?

463
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:36,416
About what happened
to his older brother.

464
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,083
[SAVARIN] What I tried to do
was for the benefit of my

465
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:44,375
fellow union members
and everyone else.

466
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,416
I acted on the belief
it would succeed.

467
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,916
But, things didn't
go as planned,

468
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,541
and the result was unspeakable.

469
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:56,500
Maybe Mr. Navona and I carried
a burden that was beyond us,

470
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:59,291
and pushed ourselves too hard.

471
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:00,791
We could've left the colonies

472
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:04,083
and found simpler
lives somewhere else.

473
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:08,125
But, once we got caught
up in everything,

474
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:11,625
it was impossible to get away.

475
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:14,833
And I admit I didn't
know what else to do.

476
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:17,000
I don't ever want you
to be swayed by others,

477
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:22,416
so find your own path in
life and never look back.

478
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,500
Cherish the ones
who are close to you.

479
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:29,875
I pray that you have a
happy and fulfilling life.

Uh, hey. You're still working?

485

[YUKINOJO] Yeah. Eco told
me about the suspension,

486

it ready for land battle.

Sorry. Hope I'm not
bothering you,

496
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:15,083
but I figured you hadn't
eaten in awhile.

[KUDELIA]
Uh...

earlier, but you had to go.

Wait, is that a fish?

You've had it before?

[KUDELIA]
Yes. It's my father's favorite.

502

Now, you don't have to
eat it if you don't like it.

503

[KUDELIA]
No, I'll have some.

to keep my strength up.

Hey!

[YUKINOJO]
You serious about this?

508
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:40,708
You'd really want
to quit Tekkadan?

509
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:43,875
[BISCUIT] Well, Orga's only
thinking about moving ahead.

510
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:47,208
That's not anything new.
He always hits life head on.

511
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:48,791
[BISCUIT]
That's true.

512
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:52,291
And if it weren't for him, we
never would have come this far.

513
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:55,000
Then again, maybe it
was only blind luck

514
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:56,708
that got us where we are now.

long we're gonna be able

to keep this going.

517
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:02,583
Just seems like everyone
would be a lot safer

518
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:05,000
if we took a calmer path.

519
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:06,458
You may be right.

[BISCUIT]
Yeah?

its hard to say, isn't it?

the future's got in store.

524

I'm sure even Orga
shakes in his boots

when he takes a
big step forward.

Make no mistake. It's a hell
of a lot more than luck

527
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:24,458
that got Tekkadan
to where it is now.

It was Orga. It was
all of our friends.

And, uh, and it was you too.

talk it out with him?

my back. I counted on that.

hand over Kudelia
