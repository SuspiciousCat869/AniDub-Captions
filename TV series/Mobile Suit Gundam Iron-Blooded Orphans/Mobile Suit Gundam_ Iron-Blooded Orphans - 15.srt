00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,250
[BISCUIT]
Brother, stop this!

157
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,458
Ow! She bit me!

158
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:33,958
[BISCUIT]
Atra!

159
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,541
Hey, what do you
think you're doing?!

160
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:37,416
[SUBORDINATE A]
You fool.

161
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,041
I could ask you
the same thing.

162
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,625
Why are you giving weapons
to the people in the slums?

163
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,625
Hold on, what're
you talking about!?

164
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,083
I am talking about
all the goods

165
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,208
that your friends
hauled into Dort 2!

166
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:49,208
W-Wait, we were only
delivering the supplies

167
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:51,250
that Teiwaz gave to us.

168
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:52,791
Weapons were inside?

169
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,375
[SAVARIN]
I see.

170
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:56,791
So you guys were
just pawns as well.

171
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,083
Can't blame you for that.

172
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:02,750
But I can blame
Kudelia Aina Bernstine!

173
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,000
[ATRA]
Huh?

174
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:06,833
[BISCUIT] Brother, wait.
You have it all wrong.

175
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:08,291
Gjallarhorn?

176
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,916
This is the leader of the
Mars independence movement?

177
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,541
She's a lot younger than
I thought she'd be...

178
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,291
[SAVARIN] She's been
working with Tekkadan.

179
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:16,625
[SOLDIER A]
You sure about that?

180
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:17,458
[BISCUIT]
No... Please...

181
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:18,208
She isn't--!

182
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,666
It's just as you said.

183
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,750
You've managed to capture
the Kudelia Aina Burnstine.

184
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:23,791
[BISCUIT]
Huh?!

185
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:28,208
[LAFTER] The <i>Isaribi</i> 's coming
here? Is everything okay?

186
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:31,208
Orga and the others managed
to land themselves in trouble

187
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:32,541
when they made their delivery.

188
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:33,750
Huh?

189
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,666
It's happening in all
industrial colonies.

190
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,666
The workers' frustrations
are just about

191
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,041
to reach their limits.

192
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:41,083
I guess centralized
control from Earth

193
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:43,125
isn't working for them anymore.

194
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,416
Far as I know, most of
the upper management staff

195
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,750
are from there.

196
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,916
Everything runs smoothly
as long as they're happy,

197
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,375
but the scumbags push the
blame onto the workers

198
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,541
whenever profits take a dive.

199
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,541
[AMIDA] Once people started
demanding better treatment

200
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,833
through protests, it was
just a matter of time

201
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,416
till they became more common.

202
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,750
[LAFTER]
I see...

203
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,041
You really should study
more often, Lafter.

204
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,250
Fine.

205
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,458
Y'know, maybe I
should start to protest

206
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,708
for better treatment
around here, too.

207
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,041
You've been more
than a little lax

208
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:12,208
in your responsibilities,
darling.

209
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:14,458
I'm sorry about that.

210
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:18,625
Can you accept the recklessness
of our new brother as my excuse?

211
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,708
[ALL]
No, we can't!

212
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,625
[CHILDREN, SHINO laughing]

213
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:27,208
[SHINO] You're all full
of energy, aren't ya?

214
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:29,958
Ha! Whoa! All right!
Hold on tight!

215
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:34,291
We'll head to Dort 3 in about
an hour. Be ready to move.

216
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,291
We've got a launch
prepared for you.

217
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,375
I hope you guys
are able to use it.

218
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:41,208
Thanks a lot. Me, too.

219
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:42,708
Dort 3, huh?

220
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:45,000
Now I probably shouldn't
be asking this,

221
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,666
but are weapons
really the only way?

222
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,583
The company has to meet us
at the negotiating table.

223
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,458
And we're willing to
do whatever it takes

224
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,458
to make sure that happens.

225
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:56,250
There are many union
members who believe

226
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,291
what we're doing isn't
extreme enough,

227
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,125
and wanna take
things even further.

228
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,625
I wouldn't be
surprised in the least

229
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:04,541
if they were planning
something big on their own.

230
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,291
We've held them
back by asking them

231
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,208
to wait for the
negotiation results,

232
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:10,250
but they could riot
at any moment.

233
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,375
And the problem isn't
just here, either.

234
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:14,500
Dissatisfaction's
spreading like wildfire

235
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:17,958
through all the Dort colonies.

236
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:21,208
I hesitate to ask, but...
if it's possible,

237
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,083
could you lend us a hand?

238
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:26,125
As you can see, we're nothing
but a bunch of amateurs

239
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,333
when it comes to fighting.

240
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:30,458
I'm sorry. If we do that,

241
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:34,375
it'll make trouble for
someone we owe a lot to.

242
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:36,333
Well, it just was a shot
in the dark anyway.

243
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:37,833
Please, forget I asked.

244
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:38,583
It's fine...

245
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,250
Mr. Navona! Look!

246
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,208
[NAVONA]
What happened?

247
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,416
[UNION MEMBER B] It's from one
of ours, undercover in Dort 3.

248
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,083
They captured someone wearing
a Tekkadan uniform.

249
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:50,000
Our guy thinks that's
Miss Kudelia there with him.

250
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:53,583
No, what are they doing?
That girl is our cook!

251
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:55,208
What in the hell
happened over there?

252
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:56,708
[ringing]

253
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:57,750
[ORGA]
What is that?

254
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:00,708
[SHINO]
Uh, it-it's our terminal.

255
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,708
Hey, Orga?

256
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:05,291
Mika! Are you safe? Talk to me!

257
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,083
[MIKAZUKI]
Yeah. What's up?

258
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:10,250
I'm just makin' the
scheduled contact.

259
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,041
[ORGA]
Are you with Kudelia?

260
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:13,958
[MIKAZUKI]
Mh-hm.

261
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,000
Did something happen?

262
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:19,625
[ORGA] It's Biscuit and Atra.
They've been captured.


263
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:22,875
[FUMITAN]
Please wait, Miss.

264
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,416
But Atra and Biscuit are...

265
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,833
The two of you need
to hide somewhere

266
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:27,833
until Orga comes down
to pick you up.

267
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,416
[KUDELIA]
What about you?

268
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,000
Can you look after
Kudelia for me?

269
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:33,666
[FUMITAN]
Understood.

270
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:37,583
Because protecting the young
miss is also my responsibility.

271
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,083
All right, good.

272
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:42,416
[FUMITAN] We'll be waiting
here for you. Now be safe.

273
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:45,625
Mikazuki!

274
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,083
[GAELIO]
Ein.

275
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,708
So have you finished
tuning the machine, yet?

276
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,916
Yes. I can be ready anytime.

277
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,666
[GAELIO]
I understand that you're eager,

278
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,750
but we're gonna need permission
to enter first, all right?

279
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,333
[OFFICER A]
Specialist Major Bauduin.

280
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,125
The captain wants
to speak with you.

281
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,583
[GAELIO]
Yeah, all right.

282
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:08,208
Now show me you can
handle my Schwalbe Graze.

283
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:09,791
Sir!

284
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:12,041
[GAELIO] Have Kimaris ready for
activation before I'm back here.

285
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,458
[MECHANIC A]
Understood!

286
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,416
[GAELIO] Captain, did we finally
get permission to enter?

287
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,458
Actually, I'm afraid you might
have to wait a little longer.

288
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:22,708
Why's that?

289
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:24,666
You didn't give
them advance notice.

290
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,875
Permission won't
be easily granted.

291
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,875
Those space rats are
right in front of us!

292
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:31,791
Well, perhaps that operation
is having an influence

293
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,291
on their current procedures.

294
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:35,833
"That operation"?

295
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:38,916
Oh, the Regulatory
Bureau's extensive suppression

296
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
of dissatisfied people, huh?

297
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:43,416
They'll provoke the
dissidents into attacking,

298
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,208
and then round all of
them up in one fell swoop.

299
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,166
They're setting an
example, is that it?

300
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,541
Precisely, and that's
the very reason why

301
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:53,916
any ships with the Seven Stars
emblem aren't welcome.

302
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,166
The activists will be cautious.

303
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:59,208
Let the Regulatory Bureau
take the credit for this one.

304
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,291
It'll be better for everyone.

305
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,000
Please be patient.

306
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:05,458
If you want me to play
politics, then I will.

307
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:06,916
Thanks, Captain.

308
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,083
That was really great, Captain.

309
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,041
[CAPTAIN A]
There's nothing great about it.

310

Contact the Mobile Suit Deck.

311
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:19,625
Don't let the Specialist
Major go out in Kimaris.

312
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:23,958
For goodness sake. It's my
daughter's birthday today.

313
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,916
So when the hell are we gonna
be able to get in there?

314
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,166
With security this tight,
it's gonna be a problem.

315
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,583
[EUGENE] Wouldn't it
have been faster to go

316
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:35,916
from the industrial area
with the union guys?

317
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
[ORGA]
No use saying that now. Shino!

318
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:38,708
[SHINO]
Huh?

319
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:41,250
Dock wherever you can.

320
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:42,208
[SHINO]
Got it.

321
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:43,916
[EUGENE]
Seriously?

322
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,583
[footsteps]

323
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:57,750
[UNION MEMBER D] You're from
Tekkadan, isn't that right?

324
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:01,666
[SOLDIER A, ASTRA grunting]

325
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,833
[SOLDIER A]
What a stubborn girl.

326
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:05,583
We know what
you've been planning,

327
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:08,500
so you might as well
stop trying to hide it.

328
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:11,375
There isn't anything
for me to talk about.

329
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:13,166
Not to you two.

330
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,083
Is that so?

331
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:19,875
I'm not saying another
word to you.

332
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:22,333
You're just wasting your time.

333
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:27,416
You'll get it worse back
at the base, sweetheart.

334
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,458
They got drugs and everything.

335
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:33,333
Heh. You'll tell us
one way or the other.

336
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:34,916
It takes a special
kind of person

337
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
not to crack under
intense interrogation.

338
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:41,083
[BISCUIT]
Atra... Why did you do that?

339
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:43,625
[SAVARIN] Biscuit, if she told
you anything about her plans,

340
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:44,625
you need to tell me.

341
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:45,875
Do you understand?

342
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,666
I can use it to negotiate
with Gjallarhorn.

343
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,458
So did you know
that Cookie and Cracker

344
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,625
turned nine years old this year?

345
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:54,541
They're both happy and healthy.

346
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:57,666
Every day, they help
Grandma on her farm.

347
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,791
And do you know how they were
able to grow up to be so big?

348
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:03,833
Because you let us go to
Mars and start a new life.

349
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:05,833
I did that because
you were in the way.

350
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:07,500
I wanted you gone.

351
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:10,583
When we were little kids,
I wanted to be just like you.

352
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,666
You meant everything to me.

353
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,125
So why are you doing
something so horrible?!

354
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,916
Don't you see what's
happening here?

355
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,541
What if the union
members start a riot

356
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,000
with the weapons you delivered?

357
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:21,500
Gjallarhorn was
waiting for this.

358
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:24,041
An armed uprising gives them
the justification they need

359
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:25,666
to suppress the workers!

360
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,583
People in the slums we once
lived in will die needlessly.

361
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,375
Do you really want that
kind of bloodshed?!

362
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:31,833
But it still doesn't
give you the right

363
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:34,416
to hand Kudelia over to
Gjallarhorn and let her die!

364
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,333
If we hand over the Maiden of
Revolution, this could end!

365
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:39,791
We might be able to strike up
some kinda deal with them!

366
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:42,000
If sacrificing her
stops a massacre,

367
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,625
I'm more than willing to do it!

368
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:46,458
But that girl isn't
Kudelia, you idiot!

369
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,083
What?

370
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,875
She has nothing to do with this.

371
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:59,958
[SAVARIN] No. She is
Kudelia Aina Bernstein.

372
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:01,833
Now, wait a minute,
you can't mean that...

373
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:05,541
[SAVARIN] Being a different
person is of little consequence.

374
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,625
If she can stop
Gjallarhorn, that's enough.

375
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:09,916
[BISCUIT] Do you hear what
you're saying, brother?

376
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,125
[SAVARIN]
This conversation's over!

377
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:13,500
Because right now,

378
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:16,458
we don't have time to go
looking for other options.

379

[door opens]

380
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,750
Where are you going, Miss?!

381
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:34,625
I'm so worried about
Atra and Biscuit.

382
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:37,208
If I go and turn myself in,
at least I know they'll be safe.

383
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:39,083
I'm afraid I can't
let you do that.

384
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:41,125
Please, Fumitan,
I have to help them.

385
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,666
No, at this point, it might
even be more dangerous

386
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,875
for Miss Atra if they find out
she's only an imposter.

387
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:48,583
[gasps]

388
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:53,666
Listen, Atra told me that I'm
part of the Tekkadan family now.

389
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,666
If I hand her over
to save my own skin,

390
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:00,083
I'll be no different
than my father.

391
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:03,041
I realize who's
important in my life.

392
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,208
It's you, Atra, and Tekkadan.

393
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:08,625
And I have no intention
of betraying any of you!

394
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:15,375
[FUMITAN] You haven't changed
after all these years, have you?

395
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:16,958
[KUDELIA]
Huh?

396
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:22,416
[FUMITAN] Those bright, honest
eyes. I hated them. Always have.

397
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,791
Fumitan...

398
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:25,833
[FUMITAN]
You could have hope

399
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:28,166
because you didn't
know any better.

400
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,708
I wished that reality
would slap you in the face

401
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:33,541
and cloud those eyes
once and for all.

402
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,250
[KUDELIA]
What are you saying?

403
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:36,541
[FUMITAN]
But before I knew it,

404
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:39,458
I was the one whose
feelings had changed.

405
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:40,958
If they hadn't,

406
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:44,750
I wouldn't understand
things the way I do now.

407
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:47,333
Because I've
realized every action

408
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:50,208
comes with a responsibility.

409
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:51,375
[KUDELIA]
Fumitan.

410
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:53,458
What are you talking about?

411
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:02,875
[MASKED MAN] I've been waiting
a long time to meet you.

412
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:05,875
Miss Kudelia Aina Bernstein.

00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:08,833
[KUDELIA]
Wh-Who are you?

[MASKED MAN] Someone like
you shouldn't die here.

415
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:14,125
This place will soon
be caught in the chaos

416
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:15,833
of the worker's armed uprising.

417
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:18,708
I suggest you leave
before it's too late.

418
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,750
[KUDELIA]
What do you want?

419
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,375
[MASKED MAN] Who do you
suppose had Tekkadan

420
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:25,458
haul the weapons being
used for this revolt?

421
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:28,500
None other than your
benefactor: Nobliss Gordon.

[KUDELIA gasps]

423
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:34,416
I'm confident you're old enough
to know exactly what that means.

424
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,833
He's the kind of
man that will do

425
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:38,041
whatever it takes to use you.

426
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:42,333
Even sending one of his
own to be at your side.

427
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,791
Wh-What are you trying to say?

428
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:47,541
You never had a moment's
doubt about your maid here?

429
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:49,916
[KUDELIA]
Fumitan's like family to me.

430
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,041
We're practically sisters
we've been together so long.

431
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,916
I won't allow you to
accuse her of such things.

432
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
[MASKED MAN] Now why don't
you let her deny it herself?

433
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:04,875
What this man's saying
is true. I'm sorry.

434
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:10,041
No... You must be lying.
This has to be a joke.

Goodbye, Young Miss.

[KUDELIA]
Wait. Wait, Fumitan!

00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:21,500
You are the Maiden
of Revolution.

Please, take care of yourself.

You can become

you into this mess, Atra.

I'm the one who got caught.

I hope Miss Kudelia's okay.

Well, Mikazuki's with
her so I'm sure she is.

Yeah.

Why did you let them
beat you like that?

What, this? It's nothing.

when I was a little girl.

Besides, Miss Kudelia is
a part of our family now.

You're right.

So how'd it go
with your brother?

454

things you were hoping to?

466
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,916
No, wait! Don't shoot! It's me!

467
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,166
Mikazuki?

468
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,458
What happened?

469
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:38,916
Did those bastards
do this to you?

470
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,166
[ATRA]
Huh? Mm.

471
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,750
Hold on, where's Kudelia?
Is she someplace safe?

472
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:44,916
Huh?

473
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,375
[MIKAZUKI]
Yeah, she's hiding at a hotel.

474
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:49,333
[sighs]

475
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,291
I'm so glad.

476
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,833
[BISCUIT]
Come on.

477
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:55,833
Let's get outta this hell hole.

478
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:59,666
[ATRA]
Huh?

479
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,208
Mikazuki!

480
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:06,000
[BISCUIT] Okay...
Now what're we gonna do?

481
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:07,333
I'm not really sure, yet.

482
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:10,208
Huh? You hadn't
thought about it?

483
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:11,583
That's...

484
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:14,083
They're out here!
Don't let them get away!

485
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,041
Wait! Biscuit!

486
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:19,583
Mika!

487
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:20,583
[MIKAZUKI]
Orga.

488
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:21,583
[BISCUIT]
Huh? What are you...?

489
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:22,583
No time! Get in!

490
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:24,166
[SAVARIN]
Biscuit!

491
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,416
If you leave now,

492
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,458
so many people in Dort 2
will lose their lives.

493
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:31,666
I'm begging you. Bring me
that girl so I can save them!

494
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,125
This is our only chance.

495
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:34,583
[ORGA]
Who's that?

496
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:37,000
It's Biscuit's older brother.

497
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:42,125
I'm grateful for all
you've done, Brother.

498
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:44,916
You worked hard and did what
you could to take care of us

499
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,375
after Mom and Dad died.

500
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:50,291
I wouldn't be here today
if it wasn't for you.

501
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:51,291
Then, I--

502
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:52,791
[BISCUIT]
I'll never forget it!

503
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:54,125
And I appreciate everything you
did for our sisters and me

504
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,750
more than you'll ever know!

505
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:59,833
But... that was then!
I'm a member of Tekkadan now!

506
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:02,375
--Wait...
--[fence rattling]

507
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:04,000
You won't get away!

508
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:05,125
[ORGA]
Biscuit!

509
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:08,750
Punch it!

510
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:09,916
Let's get outta here!

511
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,708
[SOLDIER A]
Stop right there!

512
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:17,541
[SOLDIER A]
Wait!

513
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:20,000
I'm so sorry, Mr. Navona.

514
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:23,708
The only thing I can
do now... is...

515
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:29,916
All right. Are you ready?

516
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,625
[ORGA]
Kudelia's missing? Dammit...

517
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:41,791
We're gonna have to find her

518
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:43,958
before she gets caught
in the crossfire.

519
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:49,916
Miss Kudelia. Where did you go?

520
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
[KUDELIA panting]

521
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:58,916
[KUDELIA]
Fumitan. Where are you?

522
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,666
Fumitan....

523
00:24:10,958 --> 00:24:12,833
[FUMITAN] I'll have to
thank that Masked Man

524
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:14,791
for what he's done.

525
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:18,875
I thought I had understood
my mission and obligations.

526
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:21,750
But being so
foolishly innocent,

527
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:26,541
she will surely believe
in me, and look for me.

528
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:30,333
Goodbye... Young Miss.

529
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:34,458
