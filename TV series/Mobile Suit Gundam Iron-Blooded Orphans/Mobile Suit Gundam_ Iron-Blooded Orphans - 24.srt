00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:40,291
[MEMBER 24A] Alesi, this
is not what you told me.

158
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:42,583
[MEMBER 24B] Will Mr. Makanai
really make it or not?

159
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,083
[ALESI]
He's very close.

160
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:46,458
Don't worry.
He'll be here, gentlemen.

161
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,250
But Gjallarhorn's
forces are on the move

162
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,458
at this very moment.

163
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,416
And I've been told
that Iznario Fareed

164
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,833
has just come here as well.

165
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:54,916
[ALESI] Then it appears
we have the perfect fodder

166
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,416
to put Henri's faction
at a disadvantage.

167
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,750
If Gjallarhorn were to infringe
upon Arbrau's sovereignty,

168
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,958
I don't think the people
would look favorably on it.

169
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:05,625
[MEMBER 24B]
But he still has to get here.

170
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:09,166
Of course. I'm aware that if
Makanai doesn't make it in time

171
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,291
this election will
have been for nothing.

172
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,500
Now calm down.

173
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,333
[HENRI] You told me
to leave this up to you.

174
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:21,083
[IZNARIO] I know of
Makanai's faction's plans.

175
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,083
Then why aren't--

176
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:23,791
It's all taken care of.

177
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,875
No matter how hard
they may struggle,

178
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,708
it will be to no avail.

179
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:31,916
[ORGA]
Listen up.

180
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,125
We're just about out of time.

181
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:35,916
So whether it all works or not,

182
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,500
this will be our
last operation, guys.

183
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:39,666
Now, Merribit.

184
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,833
Yes, boss?

185
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:42,208
[ORGA] I want you to
take all the wounded

186
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,166
and leave right away.
Understood?

187
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,083
Huh? But if I...

188
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:48,375
[ORGA] And I'll have the
rest of you act as decoys

189
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,375
to try and draw in Gjallarhorn.

190
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,958
[MAKANAI]
Hmm...

191
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:55,208
I know it sounds risky.

192
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:57,333
But if we're gonna
pull this thing off,

193
00:09:57,416 --> 00:10:00,833
then we have to do
anything we can to win.

194
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:03,083
If you don't agree to this plan,

195
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,875
no one will stop you
from going with Merribit

196
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,041
and the wounded.

197
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:10,875
But if you'll
join me on this...

198
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:13,375
Take whatever
you have left in you

199
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,083
and bet it all on Tekkadan!

200
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:16,291
[MERRIBIT]
You're insane!

201
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:17,750
Acting as decoys?

202
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,125
Betting away their lives?

203
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:21,791
Do you want these
kids to die out there?

204
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,583
[ORGA]
Now look...

205
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:26,833
We lived by risking
our lives for money.

206
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:29,541
Ever since we started
this damn job.

207
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:33,833
In fact, it was ever
since we were born.

208
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:38,125
But know this:
Our lives aren't disposable.

209
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:42,000
Who we are doesn't fade
once we're dead and gone.

210
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:45,166
Not as long as Tekkadan exists.

211
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,791
Some died before we
ever made it to this place.

212
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:52,750
But their deaths
were not in vain.

213
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:58,125
It's time for all of us to be
our chips on the battlefield.

214
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:02,291
The more lives we gamble,
the bigger our reward.

215
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:05,250
And the brighter our future.

216
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:07,875
Every person that we lose

217
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:11,083
will carve out the destiny
for those of us remaining.

218
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:13,291
--[MERRIBIT] But you can't...
--[RIDE] Boss is right.

219
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:19,041
For the longest time now,
I always thought we'd die

220
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,291
sooner or later... You know?

221
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:26,750
But even if one of
us loses our life,

222
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,750
that'll make Tekkadan's
future even greater

223
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:31,125
than it was before.

224
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,458
[TAKAKI] And the survivors
will only grow stronger

225
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:36,041
after the sacrifices
every one of them made.

226
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:38,291
Yeah, that's right,
Takaki. You tell 'em.

227
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:39,583
[ORGA]
Exactly.

228
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,041
It doesn't make a hell
of a lot of difference

229
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:43,875
who lives or who dies.

230
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:46,291
We are all one.

231
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:49,166
We are all... a family.

232
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,333
[MERRIBIT gasps]

233
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:52,750
[ORGA] For the fate
of Tekkadan itself,

234
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:54,791
risk everything you've got!

You're wrong. You're so wrong.

[YUKINOJO]
Yeah. Have to say I agree.

244
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,333
[MERRIBIT]
If it's the wrong thing to do...

...then why are they...?
