listen to my words.

159
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,500
None of it will matter.

160
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,541
[KUDELIA]
So I'm gonna fight.

161
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:14,000
Alone, if I have to.

162
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:17,833
I won't run. Not again.

163
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:20,250
It's like Fumitan told me.

164
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,208
I wanna be...

165
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:24,958
...like the girl in the book...

166
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:27,208
I want to become hope.

167
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,750
Did you hear that?

168
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:32,958
See? Even Kudelia thinks we
should join in the fight.

169
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:35,125
It'd be kinda lame if
we don't do somethin'.

170
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:38,083
Uh, hold on a minute!
It isn't that easy!

171
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:41,125
Mika, what do you think?

172
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:43,916
I'll do whatever you
want me to do, Orga.

173
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,125
But... I don't wanna keep
watching them lose like this.

174
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:49,666
Mikazuki...

175
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:54,125
You guys are wearin' me out.

176
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:58,125
Well, guess it won't do us
any good standin' around here.

177
00:08:58,208 --> 00:08:59,125
Let's do this.

178
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,500
[EUGENE]
Sounds good!

179
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:01,750
[SHINO]
That's more like it.

180
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,666
[BISCUIT] Well, guess
we'll just get arrested

181
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,166
if we wait out here.

[REPORTER A] Reporting live
from the center of Dort 3.

183
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,833
The chaos has died
down considerably,

184
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:14,333
and the town has
become eerily quiet.

185
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:17,500
But still, distant gunfire
can be heard at times,

186
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:20,875
and it seems the resistance
against Gjallarhorn rages on.

187
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:24,166
What? Stop broadcasting?

188
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:28,416
But people are dying over here.
Don't you care about that?!

189
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,458
Fine. I got it.

190
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:33,833
Dort Company headquarters has
taken this situation seriously.

191
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,958
[PRODUCER A]
Hey, that's enough. Pack it up.

192
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:36,958
Huh?

00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,166
[CAMERAMAN A]
What do you mean?

194
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,333
[PRODUCER A]
They don't want any more reports

195
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:41,416
about how bad
things are out here.

196
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,833
They said it damages
the image of the colonies

197
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,375
as a place of peace
and opportunity.

198
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:47,875
[REPORTER A]
Are you serious?

199
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:52,000
I guess reporting the truth
isn't important to them now.

200
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,208
Hold on...

201
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:54,625
Uh. I-It's her.

202
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:56,875
She was at the protest before.

203
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:00,916
None of the civilian transport
elevators are running now.

204

What about the maintenance
ones? Maybe we--

[PRODUCER A]
Hey, you guys!

206
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:05,875
Who's that?

207
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:08,833
Wait, isn't that the
reporter we saw on the news?

208
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,125
[PRODUCER A]
Excuse me, but you were with

209
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,875
the protesters earlier,
weren't you?

210
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:13,625
Uh. Are you talking to me?

211
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,000
[PRODUCER A]
Can I have a word with you?

212
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:16,125
I'd like to intervie--

213
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,041
Sorry, but we're kinda
in a hurry here.

214
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,500
You'd better clear the area.

215
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,958
Please. It'll just
take a minute, okay?

216
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,541
Personally, I feel
that our story

217
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,708
is a little one-sided
this time around.

218
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,958
I wanna report the voices of
you workers as much as possible,

even though I'm not sure
how far I can go with it.

problem or somethin'?

Please, wait.

If you're able to deliver
my message to the people,

223
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,666
then it'll be worth it.

224
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,166
That's the whole reason
I came here from Mars.

Of the independence movement?

their own private vessel.

Yeah, but--

Because I need to
tell each one of you

what's happening at
the Dort colonies.

What's going on?
