An attack?

00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,250
[ORGA]
From where?

318
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,750
You found them! Great work!

319
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:29,250
I've seen how these damn rats do
things ever since I was on Mars.

320
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,583
I'll end it here,
once and for all!

Crap. They're here again!

00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,500
Akihiro, can you go?

331
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,791
You have to ask?

332
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:11,833
I have no choice!

333
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:13,666
Those suits're fast!

00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:19,625

There're so many of 'em!

You guys!

00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,166
Sorry for making you wait!

338
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,666
Took us a little while
to change out the armor.

339
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,291
But we'll be sure to make
up for the lost time.

[AKIHIRO grunts]
What 're you two doing here?

341
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,333
[LAFTER] Darling asked us
to lend you boys a hand.

Brother asked you?

343
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,166
[AKIHIRO]
Then that machine is...

344
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,291
If we tried using
Hyakuren out here,

345
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:00,958
then it'd be the same as
announcing we're in Teiwaz.

346
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:04,333
[LAFTER] So we gave it brand new
armor and renamed it Rouei.

347
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:06,083
Not bad, huh?

348

It's even faster than before.

350
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,791
[GAELIO] I prepared this
just so I can finally

bring an end to you.
