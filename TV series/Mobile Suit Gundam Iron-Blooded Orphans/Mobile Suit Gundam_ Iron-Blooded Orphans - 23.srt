00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:24,708
[MERRIBIT]
Hey, you two.

157
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:26,125
W-What's wrong?

158
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,791
[RIDE] That's enough. You should
just stay out of this.

159
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:29,958
Huh?

160
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,208
[TAKAKI]
Believe me.

161
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:33,958
Nobody here's getting
dragged into anything.

162
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:36,791
Every choice that we've made
so far has been our own.

163
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,708
[MERRIBIT] I understand that,
but... I just think...

164
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:42,833
It might be difficult for you
all to see any other options,

165
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:43,916
right now.

166
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,291
You've been so
blinded by this situa--

167
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,625
If they don't pay for
what they've done,

168
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49,250
we couldn't live
with ourselves.

169
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:51,125
[gasps]

170
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,583
[sighs]

171
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:02,416
[GAELIO] Seriously?
Ein's regained consciousness?

172
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,833
[ENGINEER-A] Yes, sir. We were
waiting for you. This way...

173
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,958
[GAELIO] Why are
we stopping? Where is he?

174
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,375
[EIN]
Specialist Major Bauduin.

175
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:12,583
[gasps]

176
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:16,000
Wait! It can't be! Is that you?

177
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:16,750
[EIN]
Yes, sir.

178
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,791
[GAELIO gasps]
Ein...

179
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:22,958
[sighs] So it was a success.
That's Wonderful.

180
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,833
I'm glad. Really...

181
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:28,583
[ENGINEER A] Please.
Have a look, Specialist Major.

182
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:29,833
[GAELIO]
Hm?

183
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,541
[ENGINEER A] This is the
Second Lieutenant, now.

184
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:32,958
[gasps]

185
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,666
[ENGINEER A] The Alaya-Vinyana
integrated perfectly.

186
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,000
[EIN] Thank you so much
for what you've done.

187
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:40,791
Now I'll finally be able
to avenge Lieutenant Crank.

188
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,458
[GAELIO]
I see.

189
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,291
[EIN]
Throughout my entire life,

190
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,625
I've only met two people
who've earned my respect.

191
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:50,375
I don't think I've
ever been so happy.

192
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,833
I'll be indebted to you
till I take my last breath

193
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:55,375
for this gift you've given me.

194
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:59,625
[GAELIO]
Of course... Ein.

195
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:04,375
[MCGILLIS]
That was his greatest wish.

196
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:05,958
As his senior officer,

197
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:10,375
you were able to offer him the
opportunity to fully realize it.

198
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,958
All that's left now, is for
you to assist him by

199
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:17,166
setting the stage and taking
him to face the enemy.

200
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:21,958
Gaelio. With Gjallarhorn in
such a dark state of corruption,

201
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,708
It's truly a wonder
that your heart

202
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,791
has managed to remain so pure.

203
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,958
You're mocking me now,
is that it?

204
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,500
[MCGILLIS]
I'm serious.

205
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:33,125
And not just you. Ein as well.

206
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:36,083
I sincerely believe that the
two of you have what it takes

207
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:38,625
to utterly reform
that organization.

208
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:39,875
Even Ein, huh?

209
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:43,250
Indeed. If this mission
proves successful,

210
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:47,416
his contribution to Gjallarhorn
will be quite immeasurable.

211
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,333
And regardless of
his appearance,

212
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:55,041
the battle he's about to
enter could make him a hero.

213
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:57,125
[GAELIO exhales]

214
00:10:57,208 --> 00:11:00,541
[GAELIO] Thanks so much.
I appreciate this

215
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:05,333
[MCGILLIS]
Gaelio... Carta...

216
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:08,166
You were always
dear friends to me.

217
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,166
I never lied to
you about that.

218
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:15,708
And I believe the two of you
will change Gjallarhorn forever.

219
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,333
[ORGA]
I dunno, Mika.

220
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:22,125
I'm startin' to think
I really am losin' it.

221
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,583
[MIKAZUKI]
How come?

222
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:26,416
Tellin' all you guys we're
fightin' to get our revenge,

223
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,958
putting everybody's
lives in danger...

224
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:32,750
This is exactly the reason why
Biscuit said he wanted to quit.

225
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:37,416
That night. He talked
to me about that.

226
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,708
[gasps]

227
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:41,708
[ORGA]
He did?

228
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:42,750
[MIKAZUKI]
Hey, Biscuit.

229
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,708
[BISCUIT]
Uh... Mikazuki?

230
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,541
Gjallarhorn's on their
way to the island

231
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:48,083
[BISCUIT]
Are you serious?!

232
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,875
Yeah. I'm gonna need
you to follow me.

233
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:52,333
Orga's making a plan
and he wants you there.

234
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,791
Uh... You sure?

235
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:55,916
[MIKAZUKI]
Hm?

236
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,125
Well, yeah.
Did Something happen?

237
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:01,000
[BISCUIT]
Uh... You could say that.

238
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:03,833
We argued about what
we're gonna do next.

239
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,208
[MIKAZUKI]
Hm?

240
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:10,208
Mikazuki, I'm not gonna quit.

241
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:11,833
[MIKAZUKI]
W-What are you talkin' about?

242
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:14,166
[BISCUIT]
Oh... it's Nothing.

243
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,083
Biscuit. Are you sayin'
that you wanted to leave?

244
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:20,708
[BISCUIT]
No... Well, uh, maybe.

245
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:22,666
Guess I was just afraid.

246
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:27,583
Orga makes the decisions.
And he has led us this far,

247
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:30,208
but I started to realize
that he's only giving us

248
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:35,208
what we've been wishing for.
That's why I'm not gonna leave.

249
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:38,208
I'm staying right here.

250
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:43,041
Only way I'll go, is if
we all head home together.

251
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,208
[grunts]

252
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:48,666
Hey, uh, it's my turn
to be on lookout now.

253
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:57,250
[ORGA] If we can all
go home together, huh?

254
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,458
Well, in that case...

255
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:03,500
...there's no way that any
of us can go back now.


256
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,083
Biscuit...


257
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:18,833
[LAFTER] Mikazuki? Are you
ready to switch off again?

258
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,083
On my way.

259
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,041
--[gasps] What's that?
--[radar beeps]

260
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,416
[gasps]
An Ahab Wave?

261
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,541
[ELITE GUARD A]
We now have visual contact

262
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,125
with their freight train.

263
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:35,208
Listen up. Retreating is not
an option, do you understand me?

264
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,625
[ELITE GUARDS]
Yes, ma'am.

265
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:39,916
[CARTA] What doesn't kill you
only makes you stronger!

266
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,458
And no matter what happens,
they won't take my dignity.

267
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:45,791
I promise, McGills.

268
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:48,291
We won't leave here
untill we are victorious.

269
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,708
Our fleet's reputation
is at stake.

270
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:53,666
[CARTA] That's right. So let's
show them what we can do.

271
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,000
Hey Boss, we've got three
Mobile Suits dead ahead.

272
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:57,791
They look like the
ones from the island.

273
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,208
[SHINO sniffs]
Aww, man!

274
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,458
I was just in the middle
of an awesome dream, too.

275
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:04,541
[AKIHIRO] What? I can barely
sleep ridin' in this thing.

276
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,833
Dammit!

277
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:10,208
[MAKANAI] But I was assured we
were traveling on a safe route

278
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:14,166
that Gjallarhorn's surveillance
wouldn't be able to detect.

279
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:17,958
[KUDELIA] It doesn't make sense.
How did they find us so quickly?

280
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,875
There's only one person I know
who could've tipped them off.

281
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,208
[gasps]

282
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:23,541
[ORGA]
I can't believe he stabbed us

283
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:24,958
in the back like that.

284
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:27,666
So you're saying you
have somebody in mind?

285
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:31,500
Yeah. But we'll talk later.
Yamagi, stop the train!

286
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:32,750
[YAMAGI]
All right!

287
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,625
[ORGA grunts]

288
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,208
Sure there's only three of 'em?

289
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,916
[YAMAGI]
Yeah, at least so far.

290
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
[YUKINOJO] Mikazuki. Make sure
Barbatos is ready to launch.

291
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:44,625
Got it?

292
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:45,541
Yeah.

293
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:49,458
[gasps]
Is that her?

294
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:50,958
No way.

295
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,541
[CARTA]
I represent Gjallarhorn's

296
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,125
Earth Headquarters.

297
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:58,125
I'm commander of the Outer Earth
Orbit Regulatory Joint Fleet,

298
00:14:58,208 --> 00:14:59,708
Carta Issue.

299
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:02,333
I challenge you to
a duel, Tekkadan!

300
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:06,000
Three of our Mobile Suits
against three of yours!

301
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,875
[SHINO] Hang on a minute.
You ee that red cloth?

302
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:10,125
It's a challenge.

303
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,333
[CARTA] ...hand over
Togonosuke Makanai

304
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:15,000
and Kudelia Aina
Bernstein immediately...

305
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:17,541
[ATRA] Who are those people?
What's that woman talking about?

306
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,083
[CARTA]
And of course,

307
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,958
all members of Tekkadan shall
surrender themselves to us.

308
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:24,875
