As head of the family,

I try to provide that for
'em once and a while.

Guess that makes sense.

Okay. Let's take our
profit and party tonight.

160

Ha, ha! All right!

161
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:45,500
Hold on just a minute, Orga.
We need to try thinking ahead

162
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:46,875
and using our money
a little more wise--

163
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,500
[ORGA] Let's get goin'.
We've gotta spread the word.

[EUGENE]
Yeah Awesome!

[thudding]

167
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,291
[MCMURDO] So, you're the
activist who wants Mars

168
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,541
to have its independence.

169
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:00,500
It's a pleasure to meet
the girl in the limelight.

170
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,666
E-Excuse me, sir?

171
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,375
As a plan to begin rejuvenating
the sagging Martian economy,

172
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:10,333
you demanded that the rulers
of Earth deregulate all

173
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:13,416
half-metal
resources indefinitely.

174
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,625
And, to spearhead the autonomous
distribution on Mars,

175
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:19,125
you're going to Earth yourself.

176
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:21,208
That right, Ms. Bernstine?

177
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:22,708
Yes, sir.

178
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:25,041
[MCMURDO] From all of the
information we've gathered,

179
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,916
The head of Arbrau, Makanai,

180
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,458
is doing everything in his
power to see that it happens.

[KUDELIA gasps]

182
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:32,916
That's such wonderful news.

183
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,666
[MCMURDO] Though, worst-case
scenario, this could mean war.

184
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,041
[gasps]

185
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,750
I don't understand.

186
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:42,500
[MCMURDO] Well, anytime you want
more rights, organizations come

187
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,875
out of the woodwork
and start scheming.

188
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:48,000
Using whatever little dirty
tricks they can think of.

189

[gasps]

190
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:51,666
[MCMURDO] And the wounds
can take a while to heal.

191
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,916
'Cause even if you win
the rights you fought for,

192
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,666
the friction between the
opposing parties will remain.

193
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,916
But why? How could they?

00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,000
[MCMURDO] Young lady, how would
you feel about appointing

[gasps]

197
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:13,125
[MCMURDO] By allowing us
to work alongside you,

198
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:16,166
as your direct appointees on
these matters, we can do

199
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,875
something about the immediate
problems that you'll be facing.

200
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:23,458
Though, there might be some
things even we can't avoid.

Well, I...

May I have a little time
to think everything over?

203

It seems clear. Can't decide?

Yeah, you're right.

214

[MIKAZUKI] I guess this is kinda
like that day I took somebody's

215
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:55,375
life for the first time.
Just like me,

216
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:59,041
our entire future depends
on the decision you make.

And no one can
choose it for you.

So you're gonna have
to rely on yourself.

00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:07,250
But I didn't have the
strength to admit it.

313
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:11,625
I'm sorry. Thank you
so much, Fumitan.

314
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:12,666
Well, I...

315
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,625
Oh, yeah!

316
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:16,166
[FUMITAN]
Hm?

317
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,625
What's this?

318
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,708
Do you think it's pretty?
It's just a little something

319
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:22,708
I picked up when we all
went out shopping earlier.

320
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,041
[KUDELIA giggles]

321
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,166
[KUDELIA]
They're a matching pair.

322
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,500
[gasps]

323
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:37,791
[sighs]

324
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,125
[exhales]

325
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,666
[MIKAZUKI] Now, Orga,
If you go to sleep out here,

326
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,125
you're just gonna
catch a cold. Come on.

327
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,125
[ORGA grunts]

328
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:53,291
[BISCUIT] I see. So what you're
saying is that essentially,

329
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,541
Kudelia would be under
Teiwaz's care, then.

330
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:58,041
Do you think I should've
spoken against it?

331
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,375
Why would you?

332
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,375
Well, if Teiwaz
comes in on this,

333
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,583
there's gonna be
a lot less profit.

334
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:07,333
And Orga hasn't even been told
about what's going on yet.

335
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:10,500
If all this ends up leading
us to some kinda war,

336
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:11,833
we'll be in big trouble.

337
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:15,208
He knows we couldn't
handle something like that.

338
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:19,041
Fact is, it's only been
a matter of luck so far.

339
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:22,083
Seems like we've been in over
our heads most of the time.

340
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:24,625
And going up against people
way out of our league.

341
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,958
[MIKAZUKI] Maybe. But if it
weren't for what Orga's done

342
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:31,083
for us, then we wouldn't
have come this far.

343
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:35,500
You're right, Though, sometimes
I wish he'd try relying on us

344
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,750
a little more, ya know?

345
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,125
[MIKAZUKI]
Yeah.

346
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:45,750
--[ORGA grunts]
--[clattering]

347
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:46,708
[ORGA]
Huh?

348
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:49,625
[RIDE grunts]

349
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:50,250
[ORGA]
Hey!

350
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:51,791
[gasps]

351
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,458
[ORGA] What're you doin' out
here this time of night, Ride?

352
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:54,500
[RIDE]
I Uh...

353
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:55,791
[ORGA]
Huh?

354
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,333
Is that food?

355
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,916
You didn't feel like eatin'
this stuff with everybody else?

356
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,166
What's goin' on here, buddy?

357
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,500
[RIDE grunts]
I'm just keeping it

358
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,541
for when those little
brats complain.

359
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:06,583
Like you?

360
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,458
No! It's for all
the younger kids!

361
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:10,750
Thought it'd be a good idea to
have something sweet around

362
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:14,416
when they start crying.
So I figured...

363
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,500
[RIDE] They all...

364
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:18,333
--[ORGA laughs]
--[RIDE] Hey Come on!

365
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:20,500
I thought I told ya
I'm not a kid, anymore.

366
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:21,125
[RIDE]
Huh?

367
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:21,958
[ORGA gags]

368
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:28,833
[gasps]
You okay? B-Boss!

369
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:30,166
[TAKAKI]
I wonder if those engineers

370
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,333
have already gotten started.

371
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:33,958
What's the matter, Yamagi?

372
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,083
It's nothing.

373
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:37,500
Ah, yeah. I understand.

374
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:40,458
Believe me. I wish I could
go to the ceremony, too.

375
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:45,250
[CHIEF MECHANIC gasps] I never
thought I'd get to touch the

376
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,416
Barbatos with my very own hands!

377
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,083
[TAKAKI] Woah! They really
took it apart fast.

378
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:53,375
[YUKINOJO] When I got here,
it'd already been disassembled.

379
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:56,541
[YAMAGI] Excuse me, but what's
so great about this suit?

380
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,000
[CHIEF MECHANIC]
Are you kidding?!

381
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,708
This is one of the 72 Gundam
frames that brought an end

382
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:02,916
to the entire Calamity War!

383
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,375
But after all these years,
the information was lost.

384
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,583
So now, it's called a
phantom machine!

385
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,125
And now I get to tune it up

386
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:11,875
without any budgetary
limitations at all!

387
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,291
They're allowed to do this?

388
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,583
Well, apparently,
the boss of Teiwaz

389
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,416
has taken a liking to Mikazuki.

390
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,041
[CHIEF MECHANIC]
Just you wait and see!

391
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,083
All expendable parts
will be replaced!

392
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,125
The frame and the reactor
will be readjusted for

393
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:25,750
optimum performance, and I'll
gather the research to

394
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:28,416
create the perfect
version of the Barbatos.

395
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,416
Think it's just
what she needed.

396
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,666
[SHINO] Hey, what's up guys?
You need any help down here?

397
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,541
[YUKINOJO] Hey! So what
about the ceremony?

398
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:39,000
Yeah, sorry. I guess
I overslept a little.

399
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,916
You're gonna need some
more people, right?

400
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,583
We will, but uh,
are you okay?

401
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,333
Why do you look so shiny?

402
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:49,041
Oh! Yeah, well, I worked up a
pretty good sweat, last night.

403
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:50,333
[YUKINOJO]
What do you mean by that?

404
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,000
[SHINO laughs]

405
00:18:57,375 --> 00:19:00,416
[AMIDA ] You're just too big.
I'm afraid it doesn't fit.

406
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,625
[BISCUIT]
Uh...

407
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,708
Uh, what am I supposed
to do with this?

408
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,791
[LAFTER]
Come on. Give it to me.

409
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:09,750
There. Clothes make the man.
You're lookin' good.

410
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:10,833
[gasps]

411
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,333
You're right. I am a man, now.

412
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:14,416
[LAFTER]
Huh?

413
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,833
[BISCUIT] Akihiro, I'm a little
surprised to see you here.

414
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:21,875
This doesn't seem like
it's your kinda thing.

415
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,166
[AKIHIRO]
'Course it is.

416
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,333
[gasps]

417
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:25,625
[AKIHIRO]
'Cause this is for our family.

418
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,291
Yeah.

419

[KUDELIA]
Sorry about this, Atra.

420
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,083
Thanks for all your help.

421
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:34,666
Sure...

422
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:38,500
Kudelia, you don't look
so good. Do you feel okay?

423
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:40,250
Is something's wrong?

424
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:45,166
Mikazuki... Know I understand
how he's felt all along.

425
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:48,416
What do you mean?

426
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,750
Those're strange pictures.

427
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:57,041
These are letters. Together,
they spell "Orga Itsuka."

428
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,250
Really?

429
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,083
[NAZE]
It's for the ceremony.

430
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:01,583
[MIKAZUKI]
Huh...

431
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:04,000
Are there any letters
for my name, too?

432
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,875
[NAZE]
Lemme think.

433
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:07,500
Hm...

434
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:08,541
[gasps]

435
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:13,291
[MIKAZUKI]
So this is me, right?

436
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,166
Yeah! Like it?

437
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:18,291
Well. Kudelia's been teaching
us some different ones,

438
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:21,666
but I'd rather learn these.
They really look beautiful.

439
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,875
[knocking]

440
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:24,333
[ORGA]
Sorry guys.

441
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,791
I know you've been waiting.

442
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:29,291
[NAZE]
Nice! Lookin' good, Orga.

443
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,458
Ah, thanks.

444
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:33,458
Did you make these
for the ceremony?

445
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:34,500
Yeah.

446
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,333
Hey, look! We've got
the same letter.

447
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:37,083
Huh?

448
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:38,333
He's right!

449
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:41,916
That's the "g" from Orga
and the "g" from Augus.

450
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,875
[NAZE]
It can also be read as an "I."

451
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:44,875
"I"?

452
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:47,416
[NAZE]
Yeah, meaning "oneself".

453
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,250
Through the years, your position
is gonna change a lot.

454
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:55,083
So don't lose yourself
along the way, all right?

455
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:56,833
Or you can't
protect your family.

456
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:58,166
[gasps]

457
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:01,083
[KUDELIA]
Excuse me.

458
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:02,333
[ORGA]
Hm?

459
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:04,208
[NAZE]
Wow! You look great.

460
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:05,583
[MIKAZUKI]
What's the matter?

461
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:09,083
Thanks to you, Mikazuki,
I've made my decision.

462
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,125
[MIKAZUKI]
Huh?

463
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:10,750
[KUDELIA]
And boss?

464
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:11,833
[ORGA]
Hm?

465
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:15,916
No. Orga Itsuka.
We need to talk.

466
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,166
[ORGA]
