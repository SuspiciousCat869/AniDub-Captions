1
00:00:08,583 --> 00:00:16,125
[AKIRA giggling]

2
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:17,375
[AKIRA] So, girls...

3
00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:19,708
What do you think about
this new face of mine?

4
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:21,916
Be honest--
Pretty hideous, isn't it?

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,625
Pretty sad, isn't it?

6
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:24,541
[AKIRA giggles]

7
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,541
Pretty ironic, isn't it?

8
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:29,083
My wish was to
ruin Iona's career.

9
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:31,958
But the only thing
that got ruined was my face.

10
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:35,250
It was my intention
to end her modeling career.

11
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:38,291
But it happened to me instead.
Freaking insane, isn't it?

12
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:40,791
[crazed giggling]

13
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,458
[AKIRA]
C'mon, it's funny, isn't it?

14
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:44,458
[crazed giggling]

15
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:46,500
[AKIRA] You should be laughing!

16
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:49,125
[crazed giggling]

17
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:51,083
[AKIRA]
So...

18
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:52,833
--[AKIRA] Laugh, damn it!
--[YUZUKI] Ruko!

19
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:54,000
[AKIRA] I used to be super-cute,

20
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:55,500
but now look
at what I've become!

21
00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:57,583
Guess I'm not too
Aki-lucky anymore, am I?

22
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:58,708
C'mon! Look!

23
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:00,625
I'm a freaking mess!

24
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,500
[YUZUKI] Back off, Akira!

25
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:06,458
[AKIRA] This is all your fault.

26
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:07,500
[RUKO] What?

27
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:09,083
[AKIRA] I lost to you.

28
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,333
[AKIRA] And now I'm all alone
with this jacked-up face.

29
00:01:14,416 --> 00:01:16,000
Let's fix that.

30
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:18,458
[AKIRA] You and you and Iona.

31
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm gonna carve all your faces
up so you look just like me!

32
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:23,666
[POLICE OFFICER A]
What are you kids doing here?

33
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:26,541
[POLICE OFFICER A] Hold up!

34
00:01:26,625 --> 00:01:28,208
Stay right there, you two!

35
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:32,125
Ruko! Let's book it!

36
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:33,666
Uh, right!

37
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:45,541
[YUZUKI] She kept her memories.

38
00:01:45,625 --> 00:01:48,083
[RUKO] Uh... Yeah.

39
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:49,791
[YUZUKI] Then we're good.

40
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:51,416
[RUKO] No, we're not.

41
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,500
This is awful.

42
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:55,875
Akira's right about
the stuff she said.

43
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:59,416
Her wish getting
corrupted is my fault!

44
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,875
Ruko.

45
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,666
[YUZUKI] Look,
you still don't have a wish.

46
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,416
You should quit now
while you're ahead.

47
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,458
[RUKO] Wha--?

48
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,541
Really.

49
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:12,833
If something bad happens,

50
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:14,500
think about what it
would do to your grandma.

51
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:17,208
The same thing goes
for you, too, Yuzuki!

52
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:18,750
Think about how
your parents would feel

53
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:20,708
if something happened to you!

54
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:21,958
And Kazuki!

55
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,291
He'd be heartbroken,
wouldn't he?

56
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:29,458
[YUZUKI] I can't quit.

57
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:30,625
You have to!

58
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:33,208
C'mon, you saw what
losing did to Akira!

59
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:34,833
[YUZUKI]
I won't end up like her.

60
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:37,541
Yeah, but you don't know that!

61
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:38,541
[YUZUKI] Ruko.

62
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,000
It's sweet of you
to worry, it is.

63
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:42,583
No, please.

64
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:45,458
I have to keep pushing,
just a little more.

65
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:48,791
I've come way too far
to give up on my dream now.

66
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:51,708
And I'm this close
to making it happen.

67
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:53,541
So--God, I hate this--

68
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:55,791
We can't be friends anymore.

69
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:58,416
No matter what, I'm
going to be an Eternal Girl.

70
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,125
If you keep
hanging around with me,

71
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,666
our friendship could
be used against you,

72
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,583
and I don't
want you to suffer.

73
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:04,958
[RUKO] No, wait!

74
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,208
[YUZUKI] I'm sorry.

75
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:09,791
Yuzuki! Please, don't go!

76
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,250
[YUZUKI] Ruko!

77
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,666
[YUZUKI] It was really
fun being your friend!

78
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,958
Our matching scrunchies?

79
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:18,791
I will treasure that forever!

80
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:19,875
Then why...?

81
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,958
Next time we meet,
I'll be a new me!

82
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,666
No more regrets!

83
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,708
I'll finally be Kazuki's
girlfriend for real!

84
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:24,541
[TAMA] Hey... Ru?

85
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:26,958
[TAMA] Ru?

86
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:37,041
Ruko!

87
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:38,958
Call home if
you're gonna be late!

88
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:41,666
And where in the world have
you been all this time, anyway?

89
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,708
[RUKO] None of your business.

90
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:46,583
[slap lands]

91
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:51,458
Fine, so it's not
my business or whatever.

92
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:54,291
But still, you shouldn't
worry Grandma like that.

93
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:55,750
It's not cool.

94
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,000
You okay?

95
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:01,500
Is she--
Is she home?

96
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:02,500
Yeah.

97
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,291
Go let her know
you're all right.

98
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:24,750
Hi. Sorry.

99
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,583
[HATSU] Oh, thank
goodness you're home!

100
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,791
Cold cold, go away!

101
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,291
[HATSU] Lucky for you
I made some hot cider.

102
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:34,666
I had a feeling you'd be cold

103
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,083
after walking
outside for so long!

104
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:40,375
Don't just stand there!

105
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,250
Grandma...

106
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:48,708
Why aren't you asking me
questions about where I've been?

107
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,708
Because, dear, I know
when you're ready to talk...

108
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,583
...you'll let me know.

109
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,166
Sound good to you?

110
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:05,333
[RUKO sobbing]

111
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:12,375
[TAMA] Ru?

112
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:14,708
Did the hot cider taste yummy?

113
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,750
[TAMA] Are you asleep?

114
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,083
I wish you were awake
and having a battle

115
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,708
'cause I like seeing
how much fun you have.

116
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,041
But you know...

117
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:33,125
[TAMA] There's one thing
that I don't like.

118
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:34,916
Seeing you sad.

119
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,625
[KAZUKI yawning]

120
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:42,958
[YUZUKI] Morning, Kazuki!

121
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,500
[KAZUKI] Whoa, you made this?

122
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:48,000
[YUZUKI] Yep, sure did!

123
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,666
And by some miracle, I didn't
even burn down the house!

124
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:56,083
Here, I made soup, too!

125
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,208
[KAZUKI] Thank goodness.

126
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:58,416
[YUZUKI] For soup?

127
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,833
No, that you finally
came out of your room

128
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:01,375
after last night.

129
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:02,500
I worried about you.

130
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,000
[YUZUKI]
Girls have days like that,

131
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,375
so the best thing to do is
steer clear and leave 'em be.

132
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:07,791
Yeah, say no more.

133
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,125
[YUZUKI] Good, now eat.

134
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:11,250
Right. And thanks for cooking.

135
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,500
It's good!

136
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,000
The last time you
made French toast,

137
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:26,625
it was a real
disaster, remember?

138
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:27,708
Yeah.

139
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,958
I used to rush things
way too much.

140
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,666
Lose my cool and mess up.

141
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,750
No more of that!

142
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,666
'Cause I've learned
to calm down.

143
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,666
Take my time and set my sights.

144
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:41,500
That way everything
works out in the end, right?

145
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,041
I guess so.

146
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,375
[YUZUKI] Seeing some friends?

147
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:48,166
[KAZUKI] Oh, yeah.

148
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,791
I won't be gone for too long.

149
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,208
Well, that's good.

150
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:52,666
'Cause I'm making
dinner tonight.

151
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,208
Really?

152
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,708
I wonder what
we should have?

153
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:58,375
We had French toast for
breakfast, so for dinner...

154
00:08:58,458 --> 00:08:59,958
--Curry udon!
--Curry udon!

155
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,333
Yeah, that's right, Kazuki,

156
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,333
I know you better
than you know yourself!

157
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:09,458
[KAZUKI] Well...

158
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:10,708
Gotta jet.

159
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,375
Cool, have a good time!

160
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:28,666
[YUZUKI] Hitoe. I'm sorry,

161
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,375
but I can't do it.

162
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,041
I can't lose and
end up like you did.

163
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,750
[YUZUKI] I'm gonna make
my wish come true.

164
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:56,291
[MALE SHOPKEEPER A] Morning.

165
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,833
[SELECTOR B] Hey.

166
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,291
Did you write that?

167
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,958
[SELECTOR B] Not trying
to get on your case,

168
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:24,416
but isn't it kinda dangerous
to find opponents like that?

169
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,208
[YUZUKI] Yeah, I dunno,
you're probably right.

170
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,458
[SELECTOR B] Look, personally,
I don't have a problem with it,

171
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,916
but I could see where
other Selectors would.

172
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,541
Even my LRIG thinks
it's kinda sketchy.

173
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,000
[YUZUKI] Well...

174
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:38,666
[YUZUKI] I can't wait for
opponents to come find me.

175
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,875
I need to get this
thing done already.

176
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:41,666
Huh?

177
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,750
'Cause I'm so close.

178
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:46,208
After I beat you,
my wish will come true.

179
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,416
Wow, pretty
confident, aren't you?

180
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,500
All right, then.

181
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:50,875
Let's do this.

182
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:53,750
--Open!
--Open!

183
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,291
Something tells me
today's the day.

184
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,791
I don't know what
it is, but I feel different.

185
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,500
I think it's
the end of the road.

186
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:15,375
Perhaps so.

187
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,458
Hanayo! Get ready!

188
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,208
This girl is crazy serious.

189
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,041
[YUZUKI] It's not wrong.

190
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,958
It never was.

191
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:31,875
I don't care
what people think.

192
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:37,291
[YUZUKI] The bond we have...

193
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:39,333
[HONOKA] When I see you
stalking him all day,

194
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:42,291
it just makes me
feel sorry for him.

195
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:44,041
[YUZUKI] The love I feel...

196
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:47,083
[AKIRA] That is super-duper
naughty--You dirty girl!

197
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:50,458
Spell!

198
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:52,333
Fissure of Condemnation!

199
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:54,666
[YUZUKI] Direct Damage!

200
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,375
[YUZUKI] I'm not wrong.

201
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:03,000
[YUZUKI] I can change it all.

202
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,125
[YUZUKI]
No matter what it takes,

203
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:07,875
I won't let this world
deny my feelings anymore!

204
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:11,333
[YUZUKI] In the end...

205
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,333
...Kazuki will be mine!

206
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:17,583
[HANAYO] Understood!

207
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:23,083
[BOY 6B] Crap!

208
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:24,500
Dude, you beat me!

209
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,083
Wow, you're so good, Kazuki!

210
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:28,041
[BOY 8A]
Good? He's the best!

211
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,041
[BOY 8A] Now it's my turn
and you're goin' down!

212
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,666
[BOY 6B]
No way I'm losing to you!

213
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:35,375
Hey, so can you
take a look at my deck?

214
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:36,583
Sure thing.

215
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,375
Oh, you're gonna use Red?

216
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,666
Yep.

217
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,875
'Cause I think the
gem-themed SIGNI is so cute.

218
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:43,625
Yuzuki thinks so, too.

219
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:47,833
You know,
I'm a little thirsty.

220
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:48,916
Hey, um...

221
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,750
If I get juice,
can I bring it in here?

222
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,625
Oh. Yeah, of course.

223
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:55,208
[HONOKA]
Kazuki, will you come with?

224
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,458
[KAZUKI] Hey, wait...
What about--

225
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:05,916
No, over here.

226
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,875
[KAZUKI]
Huh?

227
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,833
[HONOKA]
Sorry I had to trick you.

228
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,375
I just said the
whole juice thing

229
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:20,125
because I couldn't think of
a better way to get you alone.

230
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,333
Do you think...

231
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:25,000
...we could go out together?

232
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,416
Um, look...

233
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,041
I do like you, Honoka,
but just not in that way.

234
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,708
Sorry...

235
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,500
Because there's
somebody else, right?

236
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,791
No, there's
nobody else, I swear.

237
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,333
[HONOKA] Are you sure?

238
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,000
What about Yuzuki?

239
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:45,083
It's not because of her?

240
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,958
You two are
always together,

241
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,916
so you can't blame
people for thinking it.

242
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,916
We all know!

243
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,166
[KAZUKI] Wait!

244
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,500
You all know what?
What are people thinking?

245
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:57,125
Duh, that you and Yuzuki
are like, "doing stuff!"

246
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:59,375
[HONOKA] Everyone says you are.

247
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:01,583
You didn't know?

248
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,333
Who the hell is "everyone?"

249
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:04,958
I mean, that's so messed up!

250
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:07,083
Who'd even say
that kind of sicko crap?

251
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,375
Tell me!

252
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:10,458
How could you think
such a thing about Yuzuki?

253
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,333
So who was it? Tell me!

254
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:14,583
Matsumoto?

255
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:15,833
Or Senda?

256
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:17,583
Give me some names now!

257
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:19,208
I'll go set 'em straight!

258
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,208
Well, if the
rumors aren't true,

259
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:24,083
why are you so upset over
what people say about you guys?

260
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,250
Drop it!

261
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:26,791
If I'm wrong about
your weird relationship,

262
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:27,708
then prove it!

263
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:30,250
Uh, prove it how?

264
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:31,333
Kiss me.

265
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:32,500
Huh?

266
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,083
Why do I have to do that?

267
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,833
Well, since I
bared my soul to you,

268
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,208
the least you could
do is give me a kiss!

269
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,000
If you're single and
not doing something weird

270
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,750
with your sister,
what's the harm?

271
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,958
Am I right?

272
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:45,541
This is insane.

273
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,625
No, Kazuki, wait!

274
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:51,375
[YUZUKI] Something...
is definitely different.

275
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:54,666
Summon Cannon and with
its effect, banish Lotus!

276
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,250
[SELECTOR B screams]

277
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,125
[YUZUKI] I don't feel like
I have a fever or anything,

278
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:03,041
but I'm burning up inside.

279
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:06,041
Is this a sign
that maybe my wish...

280
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,333
It will come true.

281
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:09,791
At last.

282
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:13,208
Yuzuki, listen to me.

283
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:16,000
I'm going to ask one last time.

284
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,916
Yeah, what is it?

285
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,750
[HANAYO] You are correct.

286
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:23,541
If you do win this battle, your
fondest wish will come true.

287
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,208
[HANAYO]
Are you sure about this?

288
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,541
When I saw
what Hitoe became,

289
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:35,250
I was mad that you
kept me in the dark.

290
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,208
But still...

291
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:38,791
Even if you had told
me what could happen

292
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,583
right from the
very beginning,

293
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:42,958
I would have wanted
to keep on fighting.

294
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,666
I don't care what it might take.

295
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,208
I'll become an Eternal Girl
at any cost!

296
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:49,416
Now, attack with Eagle! Go!

297
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:52,958
[YUZUKI] Right.

298
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,333
I've gotta do this for my wish.

299
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:58,208
I feel really bad about
what happened to Hitoe.

300
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,583
But...

301
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,333
Her wish was something
that could come true

302
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:03,125
without being a Selector.

303
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:05,500
[YUZUKI] But mine?

304
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,083
There's nothing I can do.

305
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,166
People will always frown on it.

306
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,416
I need power.

307
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,000
I need a miracle.

308
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,541
[HANAYO] Yuzuki.

309
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,541
Since you've
made your decision,

310
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:19,500
let us join together
for one final attack.

311
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,833
Now, the oath.

312
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:33,333
Do you remember it?

313
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:35,333
Yeah, it's... uh...

314
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:36,666
"I accept..."

315
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,708
"...the laws of the Selector."

316
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:41,125
"I accept the laws
of the Selector."

317
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,208
And, um...

318
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:43,458
"And upon this sacred oath,

319
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:45,750
a new Eternal Girl
shall be born!"

320
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,416
[HANAYO, YUZUKI]
Adamasphere!

321
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:54,166
[SELECTOR B screaming]

322
00:16:58,458 --> 00:16:59,833
[YUZUKI] Is this...?

323
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:03,166
[HANAYO] It is the birth
of a new Eternal Girl.

324
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:12,583
[YUZUKI]
Wait...

325
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,291
What's happening?

326
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,250
[YUZUKI screaming]

327
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:33,833
[HATSU] It's your
day off from school, Ru.

328
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:35,833
Wouldn't you rather
be playing your card game?

329
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:37,333
[RUKO] Mm, nah.

330
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,083
[RUKO] I always have
a good time with you,

331
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:42,958
no matter what
we do. And besides...

332
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,750
...WIXOSS battles
might be fun, but...

333
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:48,083
after seeing all
the pain they cause...

334
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:52,250
I... I...

335
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,125
We can't be friends anymore.

336
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:57,166
What is it?

337
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:58,916
[RUKO] Nothing!

338
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,333
Just trying to swallow a hiccup!

339
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:02,791
All right.

340
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:05,500
[RUKO] I have to stay away
from those cards!

341
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:11,250
[phone vibrating]

342
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:12,500
Hello?

343
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,083
[BOY 8A] Dude, why did
you take off like that?

344
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:15,541
Honoka's pretty ticked.

345
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,375
She said you
treated her like crap!

346
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,708
You gotta apologize!

347
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:21,166
I'll help you
smooth things over,

348
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,625
but get back here right--

349
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,916
Why are girls
such drama queens?

350
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,750
[KAZUKI] Yuzuki's not like that.

351
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:32,208
She's always smiling.

352
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,541
And honest, too.

353
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:36,000
Even if she's upset.

354
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:37,833
She tries to keep it to herself.

355
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:44,250
[HONOKA] Duh, that you and
Yuzuki are like, "doing stuff!"

356
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,250
[KAZUKI] No, that's crazy!

357
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:54,750
Hey, I'm home.

358
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,000
[tumbling noise]

359
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,166
Yuzuki? What happened?

360
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,916
[HANAYO'S voice] Just got
dizzy for a moment.

361
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,666
Sorry. I'll be fine.

362
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,541
Look, you better lie down.

363
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:09,791
Can you walk?

364
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:15,583
[HANAYO (Y)]
Thank you, Kazuki.

365
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,208
No problem.

366
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:23,333
Did you put something on?

367
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:24,666
What?

368
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,166
[KAZUKI] Like perfume?

369
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,625
You smell nice.

370
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:32,958
You know, they say if you
like someone's natural smell,

371
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:35,291
that person is
the love of your life.

372
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,541
I didn't come up
with the idea.

373
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,916
Just saying, that's all.

374
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,250
C'mon, what are
you talking about?

375
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,416
If you're trying
to make me laugh,

376
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,416
this is just kinda awkward!

377
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,791
Even if you like your family,

378
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,833
the "love of your life"
is someone else.

379
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,500
[HANAYO (Y)]
And if I was someone else?

380
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:53,333
[KAZUKI] Other than my twin?

381
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:55,375
We were born as
two halves of one whole,

382
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:57,708
so in order for
us to be complete...

383
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:01,875
...maybe we just
need to be together.

384
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:07,500
Something's not right.

385
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:08,750
[HANAYO (Y)] With who?

386
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:09,916
[KAZUKI] You.

387
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,083
My friends.

388
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:14,125
Did someone say
something to you?

389
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,791
You can talk to me
about anything.

390
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,666
All right?

391
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,958
Kazuki...

392
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:22,833
I'm yours if you need me.

393
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,583
[HANAYO (Y)] Now and forever.

394
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,166
[knocking]

395
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,541
[HITOE'S MOTHER] Can I come in?

396
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:51,416
[HITOE'S MOTHER] Hitoe?
Did you eat, dear?

397
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:55,375
No, not even the
lunch I brought you?

398
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:58,375
Sweetie, you have
to eat something.

399
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,041
Oh, before I forget,

400
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,458
I got a little
gift for you.

401
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:04,125
Take a look.

402
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:05,458
[HITOE gasps]

403
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:06,791
[HITOE'S MOTHER] You like
this game, don't you?

404
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,708
I saw an ad about
a new WIXOSS deck

405
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:12,250
being released, so I thought
I'd get you one to cheer you up.

406
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,791
Why don't you flip through it
and see what you got?

407
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,875
Oh, I bought a cake, also.

408
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:19,250
Tell you what, I'm gonna bring
up a big ol' slice for you,

409
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:20,333
okay?

410
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:21,625
Be right back.

411
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,166
[choked sob]

412
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:34,916
[HITOE sobbing]

413
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:52,750
[HITOE gasps]

414
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:58,916
Nice to meet you...

415
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,416
...Selector.

416
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:33,666
[YUZUKI] A card game?

417
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,000
[KAZUKI]
Wait, the card did what now?

418
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:36,541
[RUKO] A wish.

419
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:38,375
[KAZUKI] I assume you're the one
responsible for all of this?

420
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,625
[YUZUKI]
Thank you for that, Hanayo.

421
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:41,958
[RUKO] Wait a minute,
does this mean

422
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:44,208
you're all better now
and you remember me?

423
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:45,166
[RUKO] Next time:

424
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,000
"The Cruel Truth."
