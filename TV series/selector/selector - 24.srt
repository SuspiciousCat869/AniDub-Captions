You can't die!

Yuki!

[TAMA] I'm supposed to
believe there isn't a door,

00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,208
but that's not true.

16
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:30,416
There is one.

17
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,083
Right here.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,166
I just have to select it.

19
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,375
[HITOE] We'll be in trouble
if that groundskeeper

finds us in there.

[IONA]
What a sight to see.

25
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:41,125
Those tears of yours, Ru.

26
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:44,375
They shine like gems.
They're beautiful.

27
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:49,375
[IONA] I wanted to be
your LRIG so badly.

28
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:52,458
You're the strongest
Selector I'd ever encountered.

29
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:55,750
With you, I knew that
I could defeat anyone

30
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:58,416
and I longed for it.

31
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,708
I couldn't help my desire.

32
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:03,125
I was formed from Mayu's sorrow,

33
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:08,416
darkness, filth,
and pain, after all.

34
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,000
All those horrible feelings,
they echoed in my heart.

35
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,916
But, as I battled
alongside you,

36
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,625
I felt something else.

37
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,041
Your warmth and light.

38
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,416
It did more than just touch me.

39
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,583
It illuminated me
and began to spread.

40
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,791
[IONA]
And as it did...

41
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:36,000
I felt something beautiful
and precious overcome me.

42
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:40,291
My heart, however corrupt,
had been born anew.

43
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:43,708
And best of all,
you showed me something new.

44
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,916
That which I truly desired.

45
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,333
Yuki...

46
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:51,250
[IONA]
While I can say it, thank you.

47
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,250
Stop!

48
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,166
You don't have
to thank me, okay?

49
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,250
And stop making this sound
like you're saying goodbye!

50
00:04:57,333 --> 00:05:00,625
[MAYU] I don't understand.
Why is she crying?

51
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,875
Parting wasn't
this painful for me.

52
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:04,625
What is it that
the two of them have?

Aww...

55

as if I gave a damn.

56
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,875
The Battle ends when a LRIG
disappears, so you lose,

57
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:16,041
unless she's still with us.

58
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:21,000
So tell us, Iona,
or should I say, "Yuki."

59
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:25,500
Can you still battle,
or have you vanished?

There's no need for you
to do something like that.

You can't let me
become a part of you.

[RUKO]
Because Tama is my friend.

83

Yuki is my friend.

84
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:02,208
And the one who created
them both is you.

But right now,
you're not my friend.

I don't like you
very much at all

wasn't how things were,

if we'd somehow met before you
started the Selector Battles,

she longed for that world.

163
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,958
She wanted to be a part
of it more than anything.

164
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:15,625
That's why just when
her life came to an end,

165
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,875
Mayu did indeed
make a selection.

166
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:22,250
And with it, Tama awakened.

167
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,166
Beyond the wall of black,

168
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,875
beyond the wall of white,

169
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:30,833
there existed a world
full of countless shades.

170
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:34,166
Tama, longing for
light like Mayu,

171
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,000
was released into
this colorful new world.

172
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,416
[MAYU]
You're wrong! That's not true!

173
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,416
[MAYU]
Lies... All lies.

174
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,666
I wouldn't do that.
That isn't like me!

175
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,541
[RUKO] Why don't you come
see the outside world

176
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:52,708
with all of us?

177
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,083
We'd love to show it to you.

178
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,333
[MAYU]
How can you say such a thing?

179
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,833
Didn't you hear what I said?

180
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:03,041
I've long since died!

181
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:26,375
Uh oh. What's going on?

182
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:28,333
--[screaming]
--[RUKO] Mayu!

183
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,208
Ruko...

184
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:37,833
Hold on!

185
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,208
[MAYU]
Why?

186
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:42,458
Why are you trying to
protect the LRIGs I created?

187
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:46,416
Back then, no one
ever tried to protect me.

188
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,666
No one held me
in their arms.

189
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:01,375
No one!

190
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:07,166
[RUKO] I'm sure if this
wasn't how things were,

191
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:10,541
if we'd somehow met before you
started the Selector Battles,

192
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,375
I would have really liked you.

193
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,833
And we would have been friends.

194
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:17,750
[MAYU] If we had,
could things have changed?

195
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:36,875
[MAYU] I thought if
I were to die here,

196
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:41,000
all alone and forgotten
by the outside world,

197
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,833
I wanted others to know...

198
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:45,250
...that in some
small way I existed,

199
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:48,791
and I wanted them to feel the
pain of the life I lived here.

200
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:53,208
Even if the only way
was through hatred.

201
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,750
[RUKO] But...
You can change all that!

202
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:58,041
You can make friends! Real ones!

203
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:01,083
And not through hatred
and hurting people, either!

204
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:05,666
Guess what color
card I selected, Ru?

205
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:10,416
[RUKO] Why do you
want me to do that?

206
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,541
[MAYU]
With Urith at Level 5,

207
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:16,375
she's able to control
all of the colors.

208
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:20,458
But you see, this move
can only be used once, however.

209
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:24,500
If you can guess which color
I selected, you win, Ru.

210
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:26,333
Get it wrong, and it's over.

211
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:33,000
[MAYU] This card is
the color of my heart.

212
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:36,000
[RUKO]
What is she trying to say?

213
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,708
Is it the color of black?

214
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:40,166
The hatred she embodied by Kuro?

215
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,958
Or is it the color of white?

216
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:44,166
The love embodied by Shiro?

217
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:52,666
[MAYU (MERGED)]
Beyond the wall of black,

218
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,500
beyond the wall of white,

219
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:57,625
there existed a world
full of countless shades.

220
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,000
[RUKO]
I understand.

221
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,416
[URITH]
Hurry it up, already!

222
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,291
How long are you gonna
make me hold back?

223
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:14,708
[MAYU]
So tell me, Ru.

224
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,833
What color is this card?

225
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,875
It's the same
as this world.

226
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,875
So the "color" is obvious.

227
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:30,458
There is none.

228
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:35,166
What?!

229
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:40,625
[URITH screaming]

230

W-Wait a second!

232
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,250
No, not this!

233
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:48,916
Mayu, please, you can't let me
be executed without a fight!

234
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,541
No!

235
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:51,791
[screaming]

236
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:03,708
[MAYU] I have nothing in
my hand, and no Arts to use.

237
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:07,500
Simply put, I can't do
anything in this turn at all.

238
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:10,166
Do you know why
I chose non-colored?

239
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:14,208
Because it's one that erases all
and marks the end of everything.

240
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,625
Maybe that's true.

241
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:22,458
But that also means that
it marks a new beginning.

242
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:26,041
And because of that, you can
color it any way you want.

Paint the entire world.

Don't be afraid.

00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:37,375
So you mean...
I can have a second chance?

Yep.

will hold me and call my name?

Yes.

But this time, let's make
your real wish come true.

Hang on. But my wish--

257
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:39,333
It was to turn the
girls who became LRIGs

258
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,291
back to their original selves.

259

Isn't that correct?

260
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:49,583
It's to turn the girls
who became LRIGs into humans.

Once you've returned
to your original form,

then the Tama and Yuki
parts of you--

actually become human.

making a selection means
one thing, not everything.

269
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:15,916
I've made my selection.

270
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,041
I'm not going
to budge ever again.

I won't make one choice
at the sacrifice

if it brings me pain and tears,

that's still better than giving
up halfway or compromising.

276

That's my final decision.

[RUKO] Wow, the Activation
Ability on Yuzuki's new LRIG

318
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:48,375
is crazy powerful!

319
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:50,458
Kazuki recommended
I try some different cards

320
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,458
so I could learn
a few new tricks.

321
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,875
And while I've gotten
better overall, to be honest,

322
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:58,458
none of the new LRIGs match me
nearly as well as Hanayo did.

323
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:09,250
[RUKO] The world of the
Selector Battles has ended.

324
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:10,666
We're free.

325
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,333
[RUKO] All of the girls who
were sealed into cards as LRIGs

326
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:21,375
were able to return
to their former selves

327
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:24,625
and their former lives,
just like I had hoped.

328
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,625
The Selector Battles...

329
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:31,000
Sometimes I wonder if
those girls even remember

330
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,458
what the game was about.

331
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:47,916
A game that was born from the
hatred and sorrow of one girl.

332
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,625
Someone who never
knew love, only loneliness.

333
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:56,333
It was a game of broken rules.

334
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:58,333
One where sadness awaited you,

335
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:00,500
no matter what
selection you made.

336
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,458
But still...

337
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:05,416
A lucky few of us,

338
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,583
we were able to find
something within that world.

339
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,083
We found a way
around the rules,

340
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:19,166
a way to make our own selection.

341
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,833
The right one.

342
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:25,833
The funny thing is, if we
didn't participate in the game,

343
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:29,666
we never would have found out
what was really important to us.

344
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,875
But that's not
the end of the story.

345
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:39,083
Instead, it's a new beginning.

346
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:48,791
[RUKO] So even if there's
a long road ahead of me,

347
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:50,916
it's the one I've chosen.

348
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,875
[TAMA]
Ru...

349
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:00,708
[TAMA]
Ru!

350
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:14,458
[RUKO] I know there's
a choice out there

351
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:16,416
that sacrifices nothing.

352
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:23,625
[RUKO] And I know I'm
going to find it somehow.

353
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:30,958
[RUKO] So I keep looking.
And that is my selection.
