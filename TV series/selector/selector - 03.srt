1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,125
[HITOE] Here it is.
My favorite place.

2
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:18,583
[HITOE] No one ever
comes around to this side.

3
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:21,125
So it's always nice and quiet.

4
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:22,333
[RUKO] I get it.

5
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:24,416
So this is where you
have your card battles?

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,500
[HITOE gasps]

7
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:28,791
Oh, no. I only got
my cards recently.

8
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:31,208
I just like quiet places.

9
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:33,375
Actually, the
match with Akira...

10
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:36,833
Um... It was my...
 first battle.

11
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:39,125
I do come here to
practice a bit, though.

12
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:41,666
Midoriko cooks up
different battle situations

13
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,041
and gives me tips
on how to handle them.

14
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:46,750
I take notes, too.

15
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:49,791
[RUKO] Wow. Cool!

16
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:53,208
[HITOE] N-no, don't
look! I-it's a secret!

17
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:56,083
Besides, they're
pretty much useless.

18
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:59,083
You saw how much good they
did in my battle, right?

19
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:00,750
I just wasn't ready yet.

20
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:02,750
I feel so... I dunno... lost.

21
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:04,291
[RUKO] Huh? I don't get it.

22
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:06,458
Why do you want
to battle me then?

23
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:08,250
Oh, well.

24
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:12,208
You didn't seem very strong,
so I thought I would be okay.

25
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:14,875
Dang. Not pulling
any punches huh?

26
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:16,125
[HITOE gasps]

27
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:19,250
I... know it's wrong!
But, no matter what...

28
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:22,375
I just... I have to win this.

29
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:25,041
[RUKO] Her wish must
really mean a lot to her.

30
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:28,166
[HITOE whimpers]

31
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:32,416
[RUKO] If I lost, at least I
would be helping someone else.

32
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,833
And maybe it would give
her some confidence.

33
00:01:35,916 --> 00:01:37,208
[HITOE whimpers]

34
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:38,666
[HITOE gasps]

35
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:44,083
Ruko.

36
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:47,291
All right. Let's have a battle!

37
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:49,416
[HITOE gasps]

38
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:52,708
[YUZUKI] Open!

39
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:38,916
OMG. Can I call you "Yuzu-poo?".
I'm gonna call you Yuzu-poo!

40
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,625
[AKIRA giggles]

41
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:41,083
[YUZUKI growls]

42
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,375
Oh! I go first!

43
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:52,625
Draw, Ener Charge!
Summon, Amethyst!

44
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,166
[YUZUKI] If she uses that stupid
peeping thing, I'm screwed!

45
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,125
With the power of Amethyst,
I'll banish the Refries.

46
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,916
And attack Sapphire!

47
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,458
[YUZUKI] I'll go all out
and crush her before she

48
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,208
levels enough
to use that move!

49
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:07,541
[YUZUKI] Hanayo, Attack!

50
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,000
[HANAYO yells]

51
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:14,666
[AKIRA] Ouch! So aggressive!
You're a real bully, huh?

52
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,000
See how you like it!

53
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,750
Piriluk. Grow!

54
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:22,875
[AKIRA] Here's a spell
for you! Bye-bye Mr. Card!

55
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:25,208
What a pity.

56
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:26,125
It's all good...

57
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:27,791
What shall I choose?

58
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,875
Let's see... That one!

59
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:38,208
Aw. Only Level 1? Lame.

60
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:39,708
[YUZUKI grunts]

61
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:40,916
[AKIRA] You can't just smother
your opponent with a bunch

62
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,291
of weaksauce cards.

63
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:43,875
You're gonna eat those words
when I clean the floor

64
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,125
with your face!

65
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:47,375
Just trying to give you
some friendly advice.

66
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,791
I know red decks are supposed
to be, like, straightforward

67
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,375
and all, but jeez, loosen up!

68
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,708
[YUZUKI gasps]

69
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:56,083
[KAZUKI] Your gameplay is
way too straightforward.

70
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,625
And what's so wrong
with being straightforward?!

71
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,083
Open!

72
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,833
The field here seems
totally different

73
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,708
than my battle against Akira.

74
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:19,458
Sounds weird, but it
almost feels warm.

75
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:20,833
Now that you mention it...

76
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:23,958
It's not anything like
Yuzuki's field, either.

77
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:26,458
We've even got a
nice breeze, huh?

78
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:29,125
[MIDORIKO] Our setting is a
manifestation of the affinity

79
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:30,583
between the Selectors.

80
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:31,708
Affinity?

81
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:34,750
Your deck is green
and Ruko's is white.

82
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:37,083
It's a bit of a
rare combination.

83
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:40,541
But when the two come together,
a warm light is born.

84
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,041
[HITOE] I see.

85
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:45,083
I feel like I can just relax
and enjoy myself this time!

86
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:45,916
Let's go!

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,750
Good! Let's do our best.

88
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:51,875
Hitoe's LRIG is nice
too. I hope they win.

89
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:53,541
Meow?

90
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,875
[HITOE] You're first,
Ruko! Good luck!

91
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,083
Oh. Okay.

92
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,750
First I draw... Ener Charge.

93
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,708
Tama, Grow.

94
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,458
No Level 1 cards.

95
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:09,500
Your turn now!

96
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:10,625
I won't lose!

97
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:11,958
Drawing 2 cards!

98
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:13,166
Ener Charge!

99
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,583
Summon: Mi-Ke and Mi-Ke!

100
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:21,041
Mi-Ke! Attack!

101
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,500
[MIDORIKO grunts]

102
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,041
[RUKO grunts]

103
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,500
[TAMA shouts]

104
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,708
[RUKO] This is intense.

105
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:32,625
It's nothing like playing with
Grandma, that's for sure.

106
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,166
Hah!

107
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,000
[RUKO] My ears are burning...

108
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:39,375
When the attacks hit,
it's almost painful.

109
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:44,333
But I'm happy. And...
I wanna keep on fighting!

110
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:48,208
Tama, Grow to level 2!
Round and Square!

111
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:51,125
Attack Mi-Ke with
Round and Banish!

112
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:52,291
[MIDORIKO grunts]

113
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:53,916
And now attack
with Square!

114
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,458
Midoriko! Block it!

115
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,250
[TAMA squeals]

116
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,541
[MIDORIKO grunts]

117
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:00,833
[RUKO] Tama, attack!

118
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:03,083
Wha--! Again?! Get ready!

119
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:04,333
[TAMA yells]

120
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:10,291
[MIDORIKO grunts]

121
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:13,916
[TAMA cheers]

122
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,333
[HITOE] Are you okay?!

123
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:17,875
Don't worry about me!
Just use Grow!

124
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:18,875
Yeah, okay.

125
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:22,750
Midoriko: Level 2!
Summon: Shiro!

126
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,583
Midoriko Arts: Giant!

127
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:27,916
Shiro's power gains plus five
thousand in the next turn!

128
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,458
Shiro, attack!

129
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:34,708
[TAMA giggles]

130
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,458
I shouldn't win. It's wrong.

131
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:44,000
What's going on?

132
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,625
Well, whatever it is,
it's not our problem!

133
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:48,541
Time to attack! And quickly!

134
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,791
Yeah... Okay, uh...

135
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,750
Because... I don't--

136
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:55,416
[TAMA screams]

137
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,875
Tama!

138
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,458
Now, Piriluk. Grow!

139
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:05,000
My Ener's
not ready yet.

140
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:10,083
[PIRILUK] Arts. Peeping Analyze.

141
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,041
Be strong, all right?

142
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,291
[YUZUKI whimpers]

143
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:14,708
[YUZUKI] I knew it was coming.

144
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:17,916
That move doesn't just attack
my cards. It attacks me.

145
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,750
[AKIRA] Let's find out your
little wish, shall we?

146
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,083
[YUZUKI] She'll know.
She'll know my secret.

147
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:25,916
[HANAYO] Who cares
if she finds out?

148
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,458
[YUZUKI] Hanayo...

149
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,041
[HANAYO] If your wish comes
true, everyone will know anyway,

150
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:32,125
won't they? Just
brace yourself.

151
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:34,333
Knowing her, she'll probably
say something horrible

152
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:35,625
to get under your skin.

153
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:38,166
But remember:
your wish is nothing

154
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,750
for you to be ashamed of!

155
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:45,541
First, toss out all those
level one cards of yours!

156
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:46,791
[YUZUKI grunts]

157
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:49,583
And then the fun part!
Show me your big wish!

158
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,541
Piriluk, go peek-a-boo!

159
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,458
That's immoral.

160
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:01,375
[YUZUKI gasps]

161
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,583
She's in love
with her twin.

162
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,666
Whoa! No way!

163
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,250
You're sayin' that shrimpy
dude you were makin' doe eyes

164
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,791
at before is
your twin brother?!

165
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:13,000
--Stay calm.
--Yeah, fine.

166
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,041
I'm cool.

167
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,041
Gawd, that is
super-duper naughty!

168
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:19,625
Okay, maybe it's a little hot.
But not, like, for real!

169
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:22,625
--You dirty girl!
--Please, shut up. Please.

170
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:25,500
You know, they have a
word for that sort of thing.

171
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:29,083
I won't say it.
But it's spelled:

172
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,166
I-N-C.

173
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,625
Shut your whore mouth!
That's enough, ya hear me?

174
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,958
Shut up!

175
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:38,125
Yuzuki!

176
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:40,083
Use Dominating Fury!

177
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:42,166
Are you out of your mind?!
You can't use such a

178
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,083
high energy
Art right now!

179
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,958
Stop it! This instant!

180
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,458
[RUKO grunts]

181
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:54,500
[RUKO] If I win, Hitoe's
wish won't come true.

182
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,708
And I don't even have
anything to fight for.

183
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,000
But still!

184
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:58,666
[TAMA] No!

185
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,666
[RUKO gasps]

186
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,250
[TAMA] Tama. Want to win.

187
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:06,583
Hold on. Did you just
speak a whole sentence?

188
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:10,583
[TAMA] Tama. Wants to
win. The battle...

189
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:13,708
No giving up!
I don't want to lose!

190
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:15,375
Tama.

191
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:19,000
[HITOE] Ruko! You weren't
planning to give up were you?

192
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:22,833
Why? If you let me win the
battle, there would be no point!

193
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:24,666
That wouldn't make me happy!

194
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,166
No, I just--

195
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,125
I don't know why I even
bothered trying to hide it.

196
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:33,541
It's obvious I don't
have any friends.

197
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:36,875
I moved to Tokyo from
Aomori quite a while back.

198
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:39,791
But I was behind in school,
and my accent was funny.

199
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:43,416
So everyone did their
best to ignore me.

200
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,000
I was completely
miserable.

201
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:49,291
Then one day, I got a letter
from a friend back home.

202
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:53,416
I read it over and
over again. It saved me.

203
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:57,625
You have to understand:

204
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:00,833
To someone like me, a friend
is a very precious thing!

205
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:02,041
I didn't know.

206
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:03,375
[HITOE] No matter how
badly I want to win,

207
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:06,125
I'm not going to tarnish
my wish by cheating!

208
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,000
I'll give this
everything I've got!

209
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:11,708
And then... my wish
will come true!

210
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:14,500
That was so cool. I'm jealous.

211
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,500
Huh? Really?

212
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:20,833
[RUKO] I'm sorry.
I don't have a wish yet.

213
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:23,458
But I still wanna battle
with all I've got!

214
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:26,541
--[TAMA squeals delightedly]
--Let's give it our best!

215
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:27,541
Win or lose!

216
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:28,458
Yeah-ha!

217
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:29,541
Thanks, Ruko!

218
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,666
All right! Let's
show 'em what we got!

219
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,125
Okay!

220
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,833
[RUKO] This is fun!

221
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:37,875
Tama, attack!

222
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:39,583
[TAMA shouts]

223
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,625
[RUKO] It doesn't matter
what happens anymore!

224
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:44,208
I'm so excited,
I could almost scream!

225
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:47,125
Oversize! Power-up
all of the SIGNIs!

226
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:50,500
Yeah? I don't think
so! Anti-Spell!

227
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:51,833
[TAMA squeals]

228
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:54,833
[RUKO] I've never felt
anything like this before!

229
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,125
[MIDORIKO grunts]

230
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:57,583
Midoriko!

231
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:00,666
[MIDORIKO] I'll be fine.

232
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,333
[MIDORIKO grunts]

233
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:05,166
And, hey. Ya done good.

234
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,375
[HITOE giggles]

235
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:14,916
It's over? Guess I won.

236
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,666
So, this is
a real battle.

237
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,708
I had... no idea.

238
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:26,791
Wait a second.
I thought it was over.

239
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:30,166
Why aren't we going
back to the real world?

240
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:34,416
What should we do? Hey, Tama.

241
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,375
[TAMA grunts]

242
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:36,708
What's wrong?

243
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:42,291
[TAMA whimpers]

244
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:43,750
Hey!

245
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:52,958
[RUKO] Are you hurt?

246
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:53,750
Tama!

247
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,291
[RUKO screams]

248
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,041
[RUKO gasps]

249
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:04,875
Looks like
she evolved.

250
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:08,583
Evolved? Is that different
from powering up with "Grow?"

251
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:11,125
Yeah. As Selectors
draw closer and closer

252
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:14,500
to becoming an Eternal Girl,
their LRIGs take on new forms

253
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:17,208
and develop greater powers.

254
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:20,125
Wow! You're amazing, Tama!

255
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,000
Aww, thanks, Ru!

256
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,958
And... you're still talking!

257
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,375
[RUKO gasps]

258
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:32,833
[HITOE groans softly]

259
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:38,500
Oh.

260
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:39,916
[TAMA giggles]

261
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,291
I guess she keeps her
evolved form even after

262
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,208
the battle's done.

263
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:48,833
You're right. The text printed
on the card changed, too.

264
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,958
Um... I'm sorry. I mean...

265
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:54,166
I shouldn't have said
what I said before.

266
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,833
Obviously, you two are
more than strong enough.

267
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,833
[RUKO] That's sweet of you.

268
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,666
[HITOE] One more loss
and I'm finished.

269
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,791
I can't say things have
gone quite like I planned,

270
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,208
but this was my choice.
So no matter what happens,

271
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:06,833
I won't have any regrets!

272
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,791
Except for not getting
my wish, of course.

273
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:10,583
Um... Hitoe?

274
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:11,916
Uh, yes?

275
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,208
So I was thinking, outside
of all this Eternal Girl

276
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:17,291
battle stuff, you and I
could maybe just be friends?

277
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:19,125
Wha--?! Really?

278
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:22,041
Of course! I actually
just moved here.

279
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,166
So I haven't made
many friends, either.

280
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,041
Bu-- You...

281
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:29,750
I didn't care at first. But
now that I've opened up more.

282
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,416
I... Um...

283
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,541
Okay, this is getting,
like, super awkward.

284
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:34,541
If you don't want to...

285
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,250
Oh no, that would
be wonderful!

286
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,041
[WOMAN] Excuse me.

287
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:38,375
[BOTH gasp]

288
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,625
This is a library. Can you
keep it down, please?

289
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,750
--Right! Sorry...
--Right! So sorry...

290
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,541
[HITOE] So, um... I just...

291
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:48,541
I think I need some
time to process this!

292
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:50,000
All right, then.

293
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,500
[TAMA snores softly]

294
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:56,708
Already zonked!

295
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,166
[RUKO giggles]

296
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,000
[RUKO] Ugh. It's getting late!

297
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:06,625
Wish I had a cell phone,
so I could call home.

298
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:11,708
[RUKO gasps]

299
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,333
[HATSU] Oh, neat!

300
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,666
You bought a book
about your card game?

301
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,708
Looks quite
comprehensive.

302
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:22,291
After you study up
on this, I bet no one

303
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:23,750
will be able to beat you!

304
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,875
Yeah. There's a lotta
cards here I don't know.

305
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,000
This one looks
pretty awesome.

306
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,791
Do you have a
secret strategy?

307
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:34,708
[RUKO] I wish. But
maybe with a little work!

308
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:37,000
Anyway, I got the idea
from a girl I met today

309
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:38,916
who took all kinds of
notes on the game.

310
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,541
Does that mean you
made another friend?

311
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,541
Yeah. At least I hope so.

312
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,583
Hm.

313
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,333
[kettle whistles]

314
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:50,083
All right, all right.

315
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:52,208
Once I'm done making dinner,
let Grandma have a look

316
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:53,791
at that book of yours, too.

317
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,000
Okay, and then
we'll have a battle!

318
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,416
[RUKO] Let's see...
With Tama's new powers,

319
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,000
it looks like I can
use more red cards

320
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:04,208
and then activate
the Search effect.

321
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:05,541
Ooh, hold on.

322
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,458
I'd have to trade out
some powerful cards

323
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:08,958
if I wanted to do that.

324
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:12,208
Then Yuzuki's pure red deck
would have an edge for sure.

325
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:14,250
I'll battle
because it's fun.

326
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:16,166
That's more than
enough for me.

327
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,875
Everything else,
I can worry about later.

328
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:20,916
[phone ringing]

329
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,041
Oh. I got it Gram'ma!

330
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:28,166
Hello? Oh. Kazuki!
Is something up?

331
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:33,625
[RUKO] She didn't
say anything to me.

332
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:38,791
[RUKO panting]

333
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,916
[RUKO] So Yuzuki still
hasn't come home yet?

334
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,833
Did she call?

335
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:44,500
I called her,
but no answer.

336
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:48,541
I thought for sure she
would've been at your place.

337
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,000
You don't think...

338
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,166
Akira...?

339
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,250
[KAZUKI gasps]

340
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:56,958
[train clattering]

341
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,541
[AKIRA] Aww, what's wrong?

342
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,250
[AKIRA] Things were
just getting fun

343
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:13,750
and you're burnt out already?

344
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,750
[AKIRA giggles]

345
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,208
[AKIRA] Don't get all butt-hurt!

346
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:18,708
Really, it's no biggie!

347
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:21,541
Since I'm such a good pal,
I'll put you out of your misery!

348
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:26,125
[YUZUKI] If I had that
Adamasphere card

349
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:30,166
Kazuki was talking about,
I could have countered this.

350
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,625
Okay, Piriluk,
kindly do the honors!

351
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:34,083
Boom!

352
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,250
[HANAYO screams]

353
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,625
Hanayoooo!

354
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:46,833
[YUZUKI sobbing softly]

355
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:50,666
[YUZUKI] I'm sorry...
This is all my fault.

356
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,333
[KAZUKI] Yuzuki!

357
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:52,791
[YUZUKI gasps]

358
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:55,583
You okay?

359
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,333
You battled Akira,
didn't you?

360
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:02,833
Hold on!

361
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,041
The least you could do
is explain yourself!

362
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,458
[YUZUKI] Let me go!

363
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,583
I told you you wouldn't
stand a chance with your deck!

364
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:09,500
Why'd you do it?

365
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:10,375
Shut up!

366
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:11,583
Yuzuki...

367
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,875
You wouldn't understand
even if I told you!

368
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,958
Don't act like you care!
Leave me alone!

369
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,416
[KAZUKI] Here.

370
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,583
[YUZUKI gasps]

371
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:26,333
This... This is...

372
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:28,666
Momoka tracked
one down.

373
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,250
Guess I was too late. Huh?

374
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:32,916
Oh. I get it now.

375
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,375
So that's what you two
were talking about earlier.

376
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,000
Wait, you guys
were there?

377
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
[KAZUKI] Anyway, she
found another customer

378
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:44,208
who was willing to trade. So she
worked something out for us.

379
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,750
[YUZUKI] I feel so stupid.
Why didn't you tell me

380
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,250
you were doing this?

381
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,708
There was a chance the
trade wouldn't work out.

382
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:57,083
I didn't want to get
your hopes up for nothing.

383
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,750
I shouldn't have been
so hard on you about losing.

384
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:03,125
Right? I mean, you
just started after all.

385
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,000
Kazuki...

386
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,416
Now that you
have a new card.

387
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,791
Maybe you'll win the
next match! No big whoop!

388
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:13,041
We can do this together.
I've got your back.

389
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:17,083
[YUZUKI whimpers softly]

390
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,500
What's, uh...?

391
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:23,041
Whatever, I'm fine! I just
need a moment alone, okay?

392
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:23,875
Sorry!

393
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:26,041
[YUZUKI] Hang on.
Yuzuki.

394
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:29,500
It's okay. She's upset now,
but she has a nice brother

395
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:31,083
like you to
look after her.

396
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,125
Yeah. Thanks.

397
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:36,958
Back when I was a kid, I used
to be kinda shy and wimpy.

398
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:39,541
But Yuzuki always had
confidence in me.

399
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:42,250
So now, I want to do
everything I can for her.

400
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:45,666
Work as hard as she does
to make her wish come true.

401
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,791
I already have
everything I need.

402
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:51,333
So the least I can do is help
fight back some of this sadness

403
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:52,791
that's eating at her.

404
00:19:56,458 --> 00:20:01,208
[YUZUKI] Stupid Kazuki. Why is
he so nice to me all the time?

405
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:04,000
[YUZUKI sobs]

406
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,416
[YUZUKI] Don't you realize
you're just making

407
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,458
this harder on me?

408
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:13,000
[AKIRA] Good evening, everyone!

409
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:15,458
[STAFF WOMAN] Akira, you're
late! Hurry and get ready.

410
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:16,708
I'm sorry, ma'am!

411
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:18,250
[CAMERAMAN A]
Looking good, Iona!

412
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,375
[CAMERAMAN B]
Oh, yeah-yeah, just like that!

413
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,458
[AKIRA] Everyone decent, I hope?

414
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,958
Damn it!
This is bullshit!

415
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:35,583
I've beaten Hitoe!
I've beaten Yuzuki!

416
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:38,833
So why the hell isn't
anything changing?!

417
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:41,333
You told me I'll get kicked
to the curb after losing

418
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:43,666
three measly battles. But
how many of the damn things

419
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,916
do I have to win to
be an Eternal Girl?!

420
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,500
Winning alone isn't enough to
qualify you as an Eternal Girl.

421
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,875
Certain conditions need to
be met before your wish

422
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:52,916
can be granted.

423
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,458
[AKIRA] Like what?
Let's hear it!

424
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:59,000
If you don't talk,
I'll rip you in half!

425
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,750
Go on. You better hurry.

426
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:08,458
If you think I'm bluffing,
you're dead wrong!

427
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:10,750
Tear me up, then.

428
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:13,666
Do not test me!
You really wanna die?

429
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,666
Get over yourself!

430
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:19,625
You arrogant little shit! You're
just like her, aren't you?

431
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:22,916
Iona. I am gonna pull
your head outta your ass

432
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,041
and drag it through
the frikkin' mud.

433
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:27,125
Just you wait.

434
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:34,958
[VOICE] Say, Iona. I just
got a sense of Akira's battle.

435
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:36,958
It smells like a victory to me.

436
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:40,708
She seemed upset. Are
you sure she didn't lose?

437
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:42,125
What does it
matter anyway?

438
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:45,458
Let's just crush her already!
I wanna see her cry!

439
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:49,333
The only way she'll learn is if
you grind her under your heel!

440
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,833
Don't make me burn you.

441
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:52,583
Behave.

442
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,875
Uh-oh. Scary.

443
00:21:54,958 --> 00:22:01,375
[giggling]

444
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:34,916
[RUKO] It's nothing
to apologize for.

445
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,625
[YUZUKI] Orichalcum, attack!

446
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:38,958
[RUKO] I wonder what it
feels like to be in love.

447
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:40,166
[YUZUKI laughs]

448
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,250
[YUZUKI] That almost
sounded painful for you!

449
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:43,791
[HITOE] WIXOSS is so surprising.

450
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:46,875
[RUKO] Next time:
"That Wish Is Blasphemy."
