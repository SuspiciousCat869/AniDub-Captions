1
00:00:08,291 --> 00:00:09,708
[YUZUKI] And yet,
she did grant my wish.

2
00:00:09,791 --> 00:00:12,708
Holding up her end of this
perverse contract, I suppose.

3
00:00:12,791 --> 00:00:15,250
And I became an Eternal Girl.

4
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:17,000
To repeat the cycle.

5
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:19,291
Get it now?

6
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:21,416
That's the ugly truth
behind this game!

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,875
[RUKO gasps]

8
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:27,041
[HITOE gasps]

9
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:32,000
[YUZUKI gasps]

10
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:37,000
[HITOE screams]

11
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:37,916
[YUZUKI] Hitoe!

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,375
Hitoe!

13
00:00:50,458 --> 00:00:52,916
Oh my gosh! Are you okay?

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,375
[YUZUKI] Ruko!

15
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:56,916
Go get help! Call an ambulance!

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,666
But I don't have
a cell phone!

17
00:00:58,750 --> 00:00:59,666
Come on, think.

18
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,166
[YUZUKI] Hitoe has
one! Just hurry!

19
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,333
What? Oh, right!

20
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:40,291
[RUKO] Yeah, nothing serious.

21
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:42,958
The doctor said
she's stable now.

22
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:44,666
Uh-huh.

23
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,458
Yeah, they called them.

24
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,708
I hope this is okay, but,
I, uh, I wanted to wait

25
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:51,333
with Hitoe a bit longer.

26
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:54,625
You know, until her
parents show up at least.

27
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,916
[HATSU] Sure. That's fine.

28
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,916
Of course you can
stay with your friend.

29
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,875
I'm just glad you called.

30
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:06,958
But--how are you? I'm worried.

31
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:09,791
No, don't. I'll be okay.

32
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,666
I'll call again if
anything else comes up.

33
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:14,875
Mm-hmm...

34
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,958
[YUZUKI] Why didn't
I listen to you?

35
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,416
[RUKO gasps]

36
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:41,333
I should've stopped
while I had the chance...

37
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:42,833
Oh, Yuzuki...

38
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:44,458
Do you know how this happened?

39
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:46,416
I think so.

40
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:52,083
I won the battle and then,
well, it was strange.

41
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:55,083
[VOICE] And now...

42
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,166
You become an LRIG.

43
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:05,000
[YUZUKI] Where am I?

44
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,166
What's... going on here?!

45
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,666
[VOICE] Nice to meet you.

46
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,125
[YUZUKI gasps]

47
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,125
[VOICE] Yuzuki.

48
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:26,875
Who are you?

49
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:29,666
My name is... Mayu.

50
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,208
That's insane.

51
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,833
[YUZUKI] It was like some sort
of weird initiation.

52
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,166
She told me all about
Selectors, LRIGs,

53
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,000
and how Eternal Girls work.

54
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,250
If you become an LRIG,

55
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:45,041
then apparently
you wake up there.

56
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:47,416
[RUKO] You think Hanayo went
through the same thing?

57
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,916
I would imagine so.

58
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,208
Mayu...

59
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:51,416
A white room...

60
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,875
[RUKO] Wh- Tama?

61
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,625
Do you know something?

62
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:57,000
My memory is
still too fuzzy.

63
00:04:57,083 --> 00:05:00,208
[RUKO] So, who is
this "Mayu" girl?

64
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:03,000
I dunno, she didn't
talk about herself much.

65
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,875
I see...

66
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,333
[YUZUKI] I know
what you're thinking.

67
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:08,666
That Hanayo was tricking me
this entire time.

68
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,250
[RUKO gasps]

69
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:10,666
[TAMA] Huh...?

70
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,250
She didn't mention a word
about her taking my place,

71
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:13,416
or any of that.

72
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,541
If what Mayu
told me is true,

73
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:18,333
she's out there living
my life right now.

74
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:21,208
All that talk about
helping me with my wish.

75
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,500
Figured she was laughing
at me the whole time.

76
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,416
Don't say that!

77
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,875
Well, that's what I thought.

78
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,583
But...

79
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,333
[YUZUKI] Hanayo.

80
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,041
How could you do this?

81
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:33,250
We were friends!

82
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,166
[MAYU] Don't blame her.

83
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,250
LRIGs are not allowed to share
the truth with their Selectors.

84
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:41,250
[YUZUKI] Why do you know
this and nobody else?

85
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:42,541
What is this place?!

86
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,000
What the hell are you?!

87
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:48,916
[MAYU] If this rule is broken.

88
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,041
If their Selector learns the
truth and refuses to battle

89
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:55,208
anymore, that LRIG will
forever lose her chance

90
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:57,750
to escape the world
inside her card.

91
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:02,166
Then you're doing it too.

92
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:06,125
You're trying to
trick poor Hitoe.

93
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:08,083
It's not that simple.

94
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,666
I'll try to explain.

95
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,833
[HITOE gasps]

96
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:20,833
Nice to meet you, Selector.

97
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,416
[YUZUKI] I couldn't believe it.

98
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,666
Hitoe became a Selector
again and I was her LRIG.

99
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,500
I didn't know what to do.

100
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,500
Should I hide the
truth from her?

101
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:34,333
Was it my job to
force her into battle?

102
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:38,791
At the very least, I knew I'd be
stuck in this card if I didn't.

103
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:40,291
But after what happened.

104
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,416
Let's be friends, Hitoe.

105
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,291
How do-- How do
you know my name?

106
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:48,583
Who are you?

107
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:51,208
[YUZUKI] Well, let's just
say I'm magic, okay?

108
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,208
[YUZUKI] Even though we
didn't know her for long,

109
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,458
I still felt like we
were good friends.

110
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:01,208
But after her wish
was corrupted,

111
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:03,541
she really did forget about us.

112
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:06,750
I'm your LRIG now,
so take good care of me!

113
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:09,291
[HITOE] LRIG? What?

114
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,541
[YUZUKI] For starters,
can you tell me your wish?

115
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,250
[HITOE] My wish...?

116
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:18,083
[YUZUKI] Yeah, if you have one,
I can make it come true.

117
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,083
I'm Yuzuki, by the way.

118
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,166
I think you and I
will be good friends.

119
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,000
Yu... zu... ki...

120
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,208
[HITOE whimpers]

121
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:30,500
[HITOE]

122
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,416
[YUZUKI] "I've gotta fight
my way outta here."

123
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,125
"Even if I have to
hurt Hitoe to do it.

124
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:38,000
I need to see Kazuki again."

125
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,541
That was all I could think.

126
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,333
Hey, don't be shy.

127
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:46,375
You must have a wish.

128
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:47,833
[HITOE] I-I don't know.

129
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:51,125
[HITOE'S MOTHER] Hitoe?

130
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:54,041
You okay? Did something happen?

131
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,958
Talk to me, Hitoe! Please!

132
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:59,291
[YUZUKI] I knew her wish
was already dead.

133
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:02,083
But what could I do?

134
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:04,833
This was the only
chance given to me.

135
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:07,958
I had to take it.

136
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,416
But then...

137
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:16,333
[YUZUKI] Just as I was starting
to think I'd have to give up,

138
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:19,958
I guess I got lucky and
something happened.

139
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,208
Hitoe?

140
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:39,291
[YUZUKI gasps]

141
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:39,958
[HITOE grunts in pain]

142
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,041
[YUZUKI] Oh my gosh.

143
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,750
Are you okay?

144
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,166
[HITOE screams]

145
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,458
If it hurts, why are you
putting yourself through this?!

146
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,125
I don't know why.

147
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:51,166
I just... feel like...

148
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,166
This is something important.

149
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:59,708
[HITOE] But I think,
maybe, I do have a wish.

150
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:01,166
Huh?

151
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,500
I wanna have friends.

152
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:08,875
And for some reason that hurts.

153
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:14,583
[YUZUKI] After all the horrible
things she went through.

154
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:16,750
All that pain and confusion.

155
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,916
[YUZUKI] She still asked
for the same thing.

156
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,583
[HITOE whimpers]

157
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,250
[HITOE] Can I have friends?

158
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,375
Can you do that...?

159
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,208
You have my word.

160
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,291
I promise I'll make
your wish come true.

161
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:52,958
[YUZUKI] How could I say no
to a crying girl, you know?

162
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:54,416
Whether it was right or not,

163
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,708
I guess I got caught
up in the moment.

164
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:08,458
[YUZUKI] Will Hitoe's wish
turn out like mine?

165
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:13,125
Even I can make it come true,
is it really worth the cost?

166
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:17,708
Makes me wonder if Hanayo
went through all this, too.

167
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:21,416
I wonder if she felt as
lost and hurt as I do now

168
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,791
And if her wish came true...

169
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,375
[YUZUKI cries softly]

170
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,833
[YUZUKI] Hanayo...

171
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,291
[YUZUKI sobs]

172
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:35,958
[YUZUKI] After that,
I started to rethink things.

173
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:38,208
[YUZUKI] Hey, Hitoe?

174
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:41,083
If you want your
wish to come true,

175
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:44,000
we'll have to find a battle.

176
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:46,083
Okay, I'll try...

177
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,875
[YUZUKI] I intentionally
had her battle you.

178
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:52,000
And then told you the
truth in front of her.

179
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,041
So it's not quite
what it looked like.

180
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:57,416
I was hoping she'd refuse to
fight after she heard that.

181
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,875
But, if she quit,

182
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,208
then you'd be stuck in the
card forever, wouldn't you?

183
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:02,208
That doesn't matter.

184
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:03,416
[TAMA gasps]

185
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,208
She's my friend.

186
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:11,000
If I have to sacrifice her, then
I might as well just disappear.

187
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:15,916
And besides, if I can't live
as Yuzuki Kurebayashi anymore.

188
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,875
If I can't even love
Kazuki as myself anymore,

189
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:21,666
then what's the point?

190
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,916
I give up...

191
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,375
Yuzuki...

192
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,250
[HITOE'S MOTHER] Hitoe?

193
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,750
[RUKO] Uh, hello!

194
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,625
[HITOE'S MOTHER] Oh, Ruko!

195
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:32,583
Where's Hitoe? Is she okay?

196
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:34,875
Uh, yeah, everything
is just fine.

197
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,333
Mostly, at least.

198
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:38,375
Seems like she's
calmed down now.

199
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,750
The doctor's with her.
You can go inside.

200
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,833
[HITOE'S MOTHER gasps]

201
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:46,000
[groans]

202
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:49,875
Oh, no. I'm all right.

203
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:55,083
I'm just scared...

204
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,750
[RUKO gasps]

205
00:11:56,833 --> 00:12:00,541
Hitoe was... She was
so sweet before...

206
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:03,833
But now, I don't know
what's going on in her head.

207
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,875
It's terrifying...

208
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,375
What am I supposed to do?

209
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:10,333
What can I do?

210
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:14,000
It's like I don't even
know her anymore...

211
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:15,583
I'm at a loss...

212
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,250
[RUKO sighs]

213
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:33,333
Hey, Yuzuki.

214
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:36,208
Can I take you to
my place for now?

215
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:37,458
This is all my fault...

216
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:38,708
Huh?

217
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,708
[YUZUKI] I was the one
who made her battle.

218
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:44,000
[RUKO] Well, yeah.

219
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:46,708
But... you just wanted
to help, right?

220
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:51,458
Even though the truth was
more than Hitoe could take,

221
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:54,541
your intentions
were still noble.

222
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:57,875
[YUZUKI] Thank you, Ruko...

223
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,833
Ah! I just realized.

224
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:02,375
This'll be the second
time you've stayed over!

225
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:03,791
[YUZUKI] Oh, um...

226
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,333
[RUKO] Hm?

227
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:09,541
Actually, before we go back,
can we stop somewhere for a sec?

228
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,291
Is this good?

229
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:28,500
Can you see from here?

230
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:31,333
Yeah...

231
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:33,791
[LANDLADY] Well, if it
isn't Yuzuki and Kazuki.

232
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:34,875
Are ya steppin' out?

233
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,500
Just to the
convenience store.

234
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:39,083
[LANDLADY] Looks like we've
got snow coming, so be careful.

235
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:40,291
[HANAYO (Y)] Yes ma'am.

236
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:42,041
[KAZUKI] See you later.

237
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:51,166
Yuzuki, something
bothering you?

238
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,500
[KAZUKI grunts]

239
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:05,958
What's this about?

240
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:07,875
I want to be
boyfriend and girlfriend.

241
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,833
[KAZUKI gasps]

242
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,583
[RUKO gasps]

243
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,166
[YUZUKI whimpers]

244
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,500
[HANAYO (Y)]
This is the only time

245
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:17,666
we can be together as lovers.

246
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,333
Mom and Dad are still
upstairs watching TV.

247
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:22,833
No one from school's
here to see us.

248
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:26,000
In weather like this, if we
happen to share an umbrella,

249
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,750
no one will bat an eye, right?

250
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,083
What now?

251
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:03,375
[RUKO gasps]

252
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,541
Aw, isn't it beautiful, Kazuki?

253
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:09,166
Snowing, just for us.

254
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:15,833
You really are
strong, huh?

255
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,250
Uh?

256
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,875
[KAZUKI] You've been like that
ever since were little.

257
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:21,708
You always protected me.

258
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:26,250
Kept me on the right path.

259
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,500
I should've told you...

260
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:31,791
For my entire life,
I've loved you...

261
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,083
Thank you.

262
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,208
But I want to protect you, now.

263
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:42,750
As your brother...

264
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,666
...and your boyfriend.

265
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,416
[RUKO gasps]

[YUZUKI whimpers]

267
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:16,458
[YUZUKI] She made my wish
come true, didn't she?

268
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:19,583
Even though she took my body,
she still kept her word.

269
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:22,458
[YUZUKI cries softly]

270
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:25,541
[YUZUKI] Thank you, Hanayo.

271
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,250
You were my friend...

272
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:46,041
Yuzu... ki...?

273
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:52,125
[URITH] Setting your little
plan into motion, are you?

274
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,583
That's right.

275
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:54,666
[URITH] I wonder...

276
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,166
You think she'll really come?

277
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,500
[IONA] Oh, don't worry.

278
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,500
She'll come.

279
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,541
She's the same as me.

280
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:03,375
I suppose that's true.

281
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,916
And by that, I mean you both
have WIXOSS on the brain

282
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,291
and not much else.

283
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,083
Nothing personal, of course.

284
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,666
[URITH laughs]

285
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,958
[URITH] Though I wonder if two
of you might be one too many.

286
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,625
[YUZUKI] That doesn't matter.

287
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:18,958
She's my friend.

288
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,958
If I have to sacrifice her.

289
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,250
Then I might as
well just disappear.

290
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,250
[RUKO] We're all still friends.

291
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:29,708
[YUZUKI] She made my wish
come true, didn't she?

292
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:32,958
Even though she took my body,
she still kept her word.

293
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,958
[RUKO] If my wish
came true, then...

294
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,958
"My wish?"

295
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:41,416
Ugh...

296
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:54,875
Oh, Ru.

297
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:56,041
Is something the matter?

298
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:58,708
Uh, no, I'm fine,
just spacing out.

299
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:01,000
So, what are you up to
out here, Grandma?

300
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,500
[HATSU] Nothing exciting.

301
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:03,875
It started to snow,

302
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:07,416
so I'm trying to dry off the
potatoes I left outside.

303
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,958
Here, let me help.

304
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:15,500
Hey, Grandma?

305
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:16,833
[HATSU] Hm?

306
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,666
All my life...

307
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:22,333
I never really wanted to
be anything or do anything.

308
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:26,458
And I didn't really care
if I had friends or not.

309
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,375
I guess that's
not really normal,

310
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:31,375
so I can't blame
you for worrying.

311
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:33,375
But I've changed my mind now.

312
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,458
[HATSU] Hmm...

313
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:38,625
I made friends...

314
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,375
And realized I was wrong.

315
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:41,500
We had fun.

316
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,166
I was happy.

317
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:47,708
I wanted to, I mean, I want to
stay with them forever.

318
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:51,291
So I mean, I guess
what I'm asking is

319
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,541
if there's anything
I can do for them.

320
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,291
I'm sure you'll come up
with something on your own.

321
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:00,333
Huh?

322
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:01,833
I have faith.

323
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:04,875
You are my Ru after all.

324
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,541
You can do anything.

325
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,041
Heh. Grandma.

326
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,208
Now, let's see...

327
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:16,791
Guess we can't put
them back outside.

328
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:19,833
No, but maybe over there, where
they can still get some sun.

329
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:21,291
Okay!

330
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,083
[RUKO] Tama?

331
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,250
You're acting weird...
What's wrong?

332
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:41,291
I wonder if you were like
me when you were a real girl.

333
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:45,958
Bet you had all sorts
of friends, back then.

334
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:48,166
It'd be fun to find out
what kind of wish y--

335
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,666
[TAMA] Stop it!

336
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,708
I don't know, okay?

337
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,041
I don't remember
any of that stuff!

338
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:56,541
I'm sorry!

339
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:59,041
[TAMA] I didn't know
that other stuff either!

340
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:01,125
Not about Selectors
switching with LRIGS

341
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,125
or wishes or the weird room!

342
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:04,375
I wouldn't lie to you!

343
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:05,750
Please believe me, Ru!

344
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:08,416
I just wanted to battle
together, I promise!

345
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,500
Of course I believe you.

346
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:13,250
[TAMA] You mean it?

347
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:14,208
[RUKO] Uh-huh!

348
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:15,500
You're my friend!

349
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:17,125
We have to trust each other.

350
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,708
Guess you're right...

351
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:23,833
[RUKO grunts]

352
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:27,166
It sure has been
a long day, huh?

353
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,666
I'm going to bed!

354
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:32,833
[RUKO] Night-night, Tama.

355
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,500
[computer keys
clacking sporadiccaly]

356
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:45,875
[RUKO grunts softly]

357
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:47,041
Wha...?

358
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:49,291
[RUKO groans]

359
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:50,708
[GIRL 10A] Hey,
did you see this?

360
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,708
[GIRL 10B] Yeah, the Iona
fan event thing, right?

361
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:54,875
[RUKO] Ah...?

362
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:55,958
[GIRL 10B] But on the ad,

363
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,875
it said it's only for
"select" people.

364
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,916
[GIRL 10A] Do you have to win
a contest or something?

365
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,583
[GIRL 10B] It didn't seem
like it, but I dunno.

366
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,666
[GIRL 10C] There's no
address listed either.

367
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,916
[GIRL 10A] It doesn't list
anything but a contact.

368
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,416
[GIRL 10D] Oh yeah.

369
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,458
I sent them an e-mail about it,
but I didn't get a reply.

370
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:12,708
[GIRL 10C] What the heck?

371
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,166
[YUZUKI] Ruko!

372
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:16,541
[YUZUKI] We gotta
find that thing.

373
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,666
Do a search for it!

374
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,666
Try typing: "Iona Fan Event."

375
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,583
[RUKO] Uh, right.

376
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:31,750
[TAMA] What is it, Ru?

377
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:37,500
[RUKO] An Iona fan event,
just like they said.

378
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:40,208
"To those who are
forced to select."

379
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:43,000
"To those who do not
refuse to select."

380
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:46,416
Then it has hashtag
"Selector" at the bottom.

381
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,791
So, what do you guys
think she's trying to do?

382
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:51,083
She's calling us out.

383
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:52,333
[RUKO gasps]

384
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:54,250
[YUZUKI] She's bringing
the Selectors together.

385
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:35,541
[RUKO] It's happening
really close to here, too.

386
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:36,875
[TAMA] Is something wrong?

387
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:37,916
[HITOE] I don't want to hear it

388
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,416
and I have nothing
to say to you.

389
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,458
[RUKO] I'm sure my
plan is gonna work.

390
00:23:41,541 --> 00:23:43,041
[TAMA] No! I don't want to!

391
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:44,666
[RUKO] I finally
thought of a wish.

392
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:45,583
[RUKO] Next time:

393
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:47,333
"The Summer of Dreams."
