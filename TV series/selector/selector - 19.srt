No...

00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:20,416
You guys missed quite
the show, by the way.

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,041
Hitoe was acting all hardcore.

5
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:26,750
"I won't let anyone hurt Ruko!"
And then I kicked her ass!

00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:34,458
If you want to
battle me that badly,

10
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:35,875
then let's get it over with!

11
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:40,916
She's here! Finally!

12
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:48,458
The rain kept me.
I hope I'm not too late.

13
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:52,375
[AKIRA laughs] I did exactly
what you asked me to!

00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:54,750
--what you asked me to!

00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,125
with her little buddy Iona!

18
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:01,375
Not too shabby,
if I say so myself!

What an Aki-Lovely plan, right?!

Um, so what do we
want me to do next, Urith?!

What was that?

00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,708
[MAYU]
I've never seen such a thing.

33
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:20,458
Iona is the Girl of Black.

34
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:22,875
Tama is the Girl of White.

35
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:26,625
But how is it even possible for
darkness to long for the light?

36
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,958
Is it because she went
to the outside world?

37
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:33,333
And because she met Ru?

38
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:36,958
[giggles] Oh, Ru.

39
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:40,333
I have the feeling you're going
to add a twist to their stories.

40
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,916
And make them
far more interesting!

You brought them
here of all places?

42

What would you have done
if someone saw you?

[gasps] I... don't know!

I'm so sorry--I know
I let you down this time,

Please forgive me... Okay?

[MILULUN] Stupid? You're
the one who screwed up!

Um, about that.
Uh, it's Hitoe's fault!

53
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:16,000
This all happened
because of her!

That stupid, four-eyed uggo.

55
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,083
She didn't even have
her LRIG with her.

What were you thinking?

Hurting her? And leaving
a mark on her face?

[URITH (I)]
Delicate places-- like this.

70
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:16,583
Ones that are softer
and easier to harm.

I'm not interested in you.

No, too easy.
You're much too frail.

a way that would ensure

00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,416
you'd come to me,
but unfortunately,

[URITH (I)] It's simple really,
so I can break you.

This girl's nuts.

--[AKIRA] She hates me...
--[URITH (I)] Things of beauty.

Things of power.
Things of splendor.

And things that epitomize all
that's right in the world.

00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:14,875
Those are the things
I love seeing broken.

96

All things are at
their most brilliant

97
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:22,000
when they're being
broken into tiny bits.

98
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,041
It's obvious, right?

99
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:31,333
[URITH (I)]
It started off small at first.

100
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:36,916
[URITH (I)] Breaking this
tiny thing, or that.

101
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,083
[crunching]

102
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,041
[URITH (I)]
Watching its life fade,

103
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:44,750
feeling its body
go cold in my hand.

104
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:46,625
And since these
were small things,

105
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:48,916
it was easy to hide from adults.

106
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,375
But soon that wasn't enough.

[URITH (I)] Thankfully,
I realized everything was fine,

110
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,875
as long as no one found out.

111
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:05,750
All I needed to do was scar
someplace that couldn't be seen.

112
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:08,125
That way, no one
could say a word.

113
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:10,875
And the softest place
that can't be seen.

114
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:14,125
From the outside,
anyway, is the heart.

[URITH (I)]
What, with brute force?

118
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:21,833
As if I would ever
do something so crude.

119
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:24,416
And besides,
where's the fun in that?

120

[URITH (I)]
Instead...

121
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,833
...I just lead them to hate
themselves with a passion

122
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,083
that overwhelms them.

123
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:33,541
So overwhelming,
as a matter of fact,

124
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:36,625
those poor, pathetic souls

[HITOE whimpers]

126
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:42,375
[URITH (I)]
But, I failed once.

127
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:46,375
A mistake led to discovery,
so I had to behave myself.

128
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:50,291
Acting like a normal
good girl, making friends.

129
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,458
[URITH (I)]
All the while,

130
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:56,791
suppressing the overpowering
need to break someone.

131
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:59,625
But that life was
so dreadfully boring

132
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:02,416
that I became the one
who felt like dying.

133
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:07,291
[URITH (I)]
And then...

134
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,291
[URITH (I)]
...I met someone.

135
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:16,000
[URITH (I)]
An LRIG.

136
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,541
[gasps] Tama!

137
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:21,041
To me, being a Selector
is purely transcendent!

138
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,833
In the real world, I have to
worry about harming people,

139
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:26,000
but in battle there's no need!

140
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:30,125
There I'm allowed to scar and
injure as much as I please!

141
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:33,166
There's no authority,
no law to stop me!

142
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:38,708
[URITH (I)] I've broken so many
innocent girls, I've lost count.

143
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:41,625
I stomped their
fondest wishes away.

144
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:44,208
Denied them all hope.

145
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,666
I crushed their very hearts.

146
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:50,916
Still to this day.

147
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,375
I can hear their cries,
and it's wonderful.

148
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:56,083
You're disgusting!

149
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:59,000
That's it?
That's your wish, Urith?

150
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:02,250
To ruin people's lives?
To make them miserable?

151
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,500
[URITH (I)]
No.

152
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:06,125
I just wanted to ride
the storm, that's all.

153
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:09,583
That beautiful vortex
of sorrow, hate, and regret

154
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:12,125
that I hold oh-so dear.

155
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:15,541
That's why I actually
wanted to be an LRIG.

156
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:20,833
[URITH] You mean
I can become one of them?

157
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,666
Really?

158
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,666
That's right.

159
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,208
In fact, there's
already a Selector

160
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,583
highly deserving of you waiting.

161
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,333
Now, let's see.

162
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:38,375
I must say that frightful
new appearance of yours

163
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,583
will look quite
fitting beside her.

164
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,500
[IONA] And then,
the two of us became a pair.

[RUKO whimpers]

167
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:50,791
[URITH (I)] Indeed,
but truth be told,

168
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:54,500
you were a bit too
refined for my tastes.

169
00:09:54,583 --> 00:10:00,250
[chuckles] Say, has this
thought ever crossed your mind?

170
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:03,333
That the real world
can just go to hell?

171
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,333
[URITH (I)]
Think about it.

172
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,166
There's nothing here;

173
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:12,750
just false images, deceit,
and pretentious lies.

174
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:15,458
But the battlefield
isn't like that at all.

175
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,416
There is something there.

176
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,791
The truth.

177
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:21,750
Where else can you battle for
your fondest desire,

178
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:25,625
then savor every miserable sob
of your fallen opponents?

179
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,875
It's sublime!

180
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:31,708
It's where I was
meant to be! [laughs]

181
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:34,375
I wanna stay there forever,
watching the madness.

182
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,541
All that lovely despair.

183
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,791
That's why I'm going to
continue to win my battles

time and again,
crushing every wish!

So come on, let's battle!

You, too, Iona.

189

That is why you
became her LRIG, right?

190
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,958
Ruko, please listen.

191
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:59,791
You're the most powerful
Selector I've ever met.

192

As a result, I'm dying to hear
what whimpers you'll make

193
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:05,208
when I crush you
into little pieces.

will you let out?

Don't do it, Ruko! [grunts]

It might not be my style,

but if you refuse to
battle me here and now.

200
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,666
I will break her.

Yeah, she's serious.

There's no telling what
she'll do if you refuse.

[AKIRA]
No...

324
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:29,833
Urith told me...

325
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:33,041
She told me I was
beautiful and precious.

326
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:36,000
She wants to be with me.

327
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:40,791
[AKIRA] Of course she does,
I'm her Aki-lovely.

00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,208
Aki-lovely.

Are you okay, Iona?!

Poor thing...

00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:41,625
[IONA]
Everything is shining in white.

348
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,083
It's so bright.

349
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,583
[MAYU] That strange thing
is happening again.

350
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:53,458
Dark is crossing
once more with light.

351
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:57,125
Well, well.

352
00:18:57,208 --> 00:19:00,125

twist to their stories.

[TAMA gasps]

354

I know that one for sure!

366
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:54,500
That little maneuver can negate
any attack, if you hadn't heard!

367
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,041
Tama!

368

[TAMA]
I'm jealous...

00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:11,458
You're so... strong together...

372
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:16,250
I think... I might even lose.

00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:22,625
But... Hitoe will be saved...

Tama...

375
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:26,458
[IONA]
As I thought.

376
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:27,833
Huh?

377
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:30,500
[IONA]
Tama is light.

378
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:35,250
[IONA]
There once was a girl of fate.

379
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:38,000
[gasps]

380
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:39,916
[IONA] She was in
solitude from the moment

381
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,416
she was born into her world.

382
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,041
A solemn existence.

383
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:46,750
[MAYU growls]

384
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:49,125
[IONA] She didn't know
the world outside.

385
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,000
And was neither
loved nor touched

386
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,541
by any other soul at all.

387
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:57,166
Her life was one lived alone,

388
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,375
and her bitter isolation
made every day

389
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,541
feel like an eternity.

390
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,833
[IONA]
Remember Fumio Futase's story?

391
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:11,041
[gasps]

392
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:13,250
About a Girl of Black
and a Girl of White?

393
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:16,291
Well, those two girls are
both from the same person.

394
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,083
An original girl.

395
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:20,291
The one that we know as Mayu.

396
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:24,291
For us, she's something more.

397
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:26,750
Mayu...

398
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:28,625
...is also our mother.

[MAYU]
You're so bad.

402
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:37,833
[gasps, grunts]

403
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:39,000
Iona!

404
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:45,500
[IONA whimpers]

405
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:48,583
[MAYU] Just when everyone was
starting to have so much fun,

406
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:53,125
[MAYU] You had to go and
ruin things, didn't you?

407
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:54,208
Oh well.

408
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:56,375
You are cruel and wicked, Iona.

409
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:59,041
You bring misery.

410
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:00,958
As the Girl of Black.

411
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,708
[IONA] Your strength
flowed into me, Ruko.

412
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:37,125
It felt nice and warm.

413
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:40,375
[MAYU]
A... lot... of... friends...

414
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:42,791
[TAMA] I feel like something's
trying to take me over!

415
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:44,750
[MILULUN] Guess it was
just one big game after all!

416
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:47,000
