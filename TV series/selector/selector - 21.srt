1
00:00:11,458 --> 00:00:14,291
A... ki... ra...

2
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:21,833
[MILULUN]
Jeez, Aki-lovely!

3
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:23,125
That was nasty!

4
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:26,708
Milulun's so scared!

5
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:29,666
[AKIRA]
I have to... keep doing them...

6
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:30,875
Huh?

7
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:32,625
[AKIRA]
Selector battles.

8
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:34,125
Oh?

9
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:36,583
And what's your wish?

10
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:38,000
Urith's scar,

11
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:39,250
I want it to heal...

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,458
[AKIRA]
...as quickly as possible.

13
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:43,500
Hmph.

14
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:46,541
Well, it will if you're lucky!

15
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:50,000
That's right, Aki-lucky.

16
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:22,583
[RUKO]
Are you all right, Hitoe?

17
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:24,291
You didn't get hurt, did you?

18
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:26,041
Oh, no, I'm fine, thanks.

19
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:28,541
I'm just a little
shaken up, that's all.

20
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:29,500
I'm sorry.

21
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:30,958
It's my fault.

22
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:33,583
No, wait. I need to
apologize to you.

23
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:35,583
You had to suffer
through a battle for me.

24
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:36,958
Yeah, but--

25
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:40,000
Plus, Iona had to relive
all those painful memories.

26
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:42,000
[gasps]

27
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:43,791
I don't deserve your sympathy.

28
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:45,041
[RUKO, HITOE]
Huh?

29
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:48,333
Both Shiro and I were
made by and from Mayu.

30
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:50,250
So then, in essence,
we're the ones who

31
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:52,041
created the Selector battles.

32
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:53,791
But that's Mayu's
fault, not yours--

33
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:56,833
You girls have every right to
hate us for what we've done!

34
00:02:56,916 --> 00:03:00,750
And yet, you've still tried
to save all three of us.

35
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:03,458
[HITOE] I don't condone
what Mayu's done, but,

36
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:05,875
I do understand
where's she coming from.

37
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:10,166
Before now, I didn't have any
friends either; I was all alone.

38
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,208
I know how painful that is...

39
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:14,041
[gasps]

40
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,791
Every single time
I left the house,

41
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:19,333
I saw so many happy people

42
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,500
walking and talking
with their friends.

43
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:22,791
That just made me feel like

44
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:25,708
I was the loneliest person
in the entire world.

45
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:29,083
After hearing what Iona told
us about Mayu's history,

46
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:30,875
the loneliness that
I felt was nothing

47
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:34,000
compared to the sorts of things
she's had to go through...

48
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:35,166
Poor thing.

49
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,166
So, then...

50
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,833
Maybe that's it, guys.

51
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:43,208
Maybe what's it?

52
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:44,583
Mayu's wish.

53
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:47,291
Her real one, I think.

54
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:50,166
You mean it isn't... revenge?

55
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,625
[YUZUKI] Well, it always
felt kind of weird to me.

56
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:53,875
Why did Mayu make the rules

57
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:56,875
to the Selector
battles the way she did?

58
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:59,083
The girl who wins has
their wish taken away

59
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:00,833
and is sealed into a card?

60
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:02,666
That's a really
horrible thing and all,

61
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,625
but as far as revenge goes,
it doesn't make much sense.

62
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,708
I mean...

63
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,708
Things aren't as bad when
we're talking like we are now,

64
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:18,541
but more than anything else,
being in a card is... lonely.

65
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,166
It's a crushing... emptiness.

66
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,458
[YUZUKI]
So maybe Mayu's real wish,

67
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,625
It isn't revenge,
but wanting everyone to

68
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,500
know what it feels
like to be lonely.

69
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,875
To feel what she's been through.

70
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:32,708
[gasps]

71
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:34,500
[RUKO, HITOE]
Yuzuki...

72
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:35,583
I'm sorry!

73
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:38,875
I had no idea you felt that way!

74
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:41,750
So from now on, I'm going
to keep you close to me,

75
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,958
--even when I'm sleeping, okay?
--[YUZUKI] I'm fine! Thanks,

76
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:45,708
but come on, this is
mostly just weird!

77
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:50,666
Iona...

78
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:58,458
[IONA]
Unbelievable.

79
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,000
[RUKO]
What?

80
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:02,791
[IONA] With everything horrible
that she's put you through,

81
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,541
I find it rather surprising that

82
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,750
you're still looking
at Mayu with sympathy.

83
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,833
[RUKO]
Well, that's not entirely true.

84
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:11,541
But if you ask me,

85
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:14,333
I think the reason we
feel the way we do

86
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:16,666
is 'cause of how we
feel for you and Tama.

87
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,625
[RUKO]
I mean, you told us that

88
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:22,833
you and she were created
by and from Mayu, right?

89
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:27,291
Well, if that's the case, then
Mayu can't be all bad, can she?

90
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,750
[IONA]
You really think so?

91
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,333
Yeah, and you know what?

92
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:35,250
Since you guys became friends
with us, I bet Mayu could, too.

93
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,791
We just have to
convince her to listen,

94
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:39,500
and I think we can do that
by speaking from our hearts.

95
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:44,791
[IONA]
Yeah, but, my heart aches.

96
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:47,916
It must be because I
shouldn't feel this way...

97
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,666
Because I'm the Girl of Black.

98
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:53,750
But even though
this feeling hurts...

99
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:56,875
...it's so warm.

100
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:59,666
All I want to do is
keep embracing it.

101
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:04,625
What, why?

102
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:05,958
It's all wrong!

103
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,166
What's going on?

104
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,333
Why isn't Kuro the same anymore?

105
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:19,625
Selector battles need both--

106
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:23,958
Bright light on one side, and
shrouded darkness on the other.

107
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:26,375
If Kuro's going to
be this useless,

108
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,375
then she leaves me
no other choice.

109
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,791
We'll burn her card to ashes.

110
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,583
Won't we, Shiro?

111
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,166
[URITH (I)]
I can't believe this pampering.

112
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,625
A private hospital room
for this measly scratch?

113
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:43,125
That's the Urazoe
family for you.

114
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:45,250
[TAMA]
Um, are you okay, Urith?

115
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:47,541
Yes, it's a minor
wound, that's all.

116
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,375
[URITH (I)] Say, mind
if I ask you something?

117
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:53,583
Huh?

118
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:54,625
[URITH (I)]
Iona passed through many hands

119
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,416
as both a LRIG and a Selector

120
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,333
after Mayu created her
as the Girl of Black.

121
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:02,708
But where were you before
you ended up as Ruko's LRIG?

122
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:09,000
To be honest... Well, all I
seem to remember is meeting Ru.

123
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,041
I forgot about Mayu and Kuro

124
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:13,750
and everything else that
happened before that.

125
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:17,250
Even though I didn't have
any memory of my past...

126
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,750
It didn't matter because
I had Ru in my life.

127
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:21,791
I felt like I was born
just to meet her.

128
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,041
Oh.

129
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:27,833
Now, I know why Mayu did it.

130
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:28,916
Huh?

131
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,666
She got rid of you
and sent you here

132
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,083
because you're vomit-inducing.

133
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,500
[gasps]

134
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:35,916
[URITH (I)] She must have
gotten sick of your sweet,

135
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,958
little sunny spirit, clinging
like gunk to her heart.

136
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:42,000
She couldn't take any more,
so it was "so long, Shiro."

137
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,166
I bet you anything that's why

138
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,333
she put you in
Ruko's hands first.

139
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,875
Ruko is one horrifying girl.

140
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:51,875
After all, she can
destroy everything.

141
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:54,708
[whimpers]

142
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:02,125
[ELDORA]
So, Chiyori? What's next?

143
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:03,416
What do you mean?

144
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,833
"Even if I know the truth
behind the battles,

145
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:06,541
I'm never giving up my dream!

146
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:09,750
Hoo-yeah, onto the
next big battle!"

147
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:12,166
[ELDORA] That's you in
a nutshell, isn't it?

148
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,916
Such incredible evil.

149
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,083
Huh?

150
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,375
[CHIYORI]
There's no two ways about it.

151
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:19,000
How else could you describe
Selector battles?

152
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:22,541
Win or lose, only a
tragic ending awaits!

153
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:25,375
To suggest I jump into one
is real messed up and mean!

154
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:26,958
What are you, the
villain of a story

155
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:28,208
who wants to see me suffer?

156
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:31,458
Heh-heh. I gotta admit,
that would be amusing.

--[CHIYORI growls]
--[ELDORA grunts]

158

Just kidding, but
remember what you said.

159
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:37,916
Your wish is to enter
the world of the cards.

160
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,666
Or did you change
your mind already?

161
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,583
[CHIYORI]
Huh?

162
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:41,625
[ELDORA]
Guess that answers that.

163
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:45,333
[CHIYORI]
Yeah, you're right.

164
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,583
But if I lose one more time,
I'll be out of the game

165
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,666
and you won't be
my LRIG anymore.

166
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,166
[ELDORA] Well, sure, but
there's no use dwelling on it.

167
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,833
We'll jump off that bridge
when we come to it.

168
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:56,375
Yeah, I guess so.

169
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,500
Hey, on the subject of battles,

170
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,916
you were a human once
too, right, Eldora?

171
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,583
What was your wish back then?

172
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:06,750
Huh?

173
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:09,125
Well, uh... I forgot.

174
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:10,125
[CHIYORI]
Liar!

175
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:12,166
What? I just don't
wanna tell you!

176
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,833
Treat it like one of those
plot twists you like.

177
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,041
Why, you!

178
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:17,666
Don't get all worked up.

179
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,916
Really.

180
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,375
Besides, my wish totally
wasn't anything special.

181
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:25,833
I was pretty into it,
like you are, though.

182
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:27,083
[CHIYORI]
Uhh...

183
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,250
[HITOE]
Well, in any case,

184
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:35,166
I guess we need to speak
with Tama then, don't we?

185
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,708
[RUKO]
Yeah, but...

186
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,041
Are you okay with that?

187
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,583
It means seeing Urith.

188
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:40,625
[YUZUKI]
Good point.

189
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:42,500
Ruko and I can go without you.

190
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,500
It's okay. I appreciate
the concern, but I--

191
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:47,125
[phone rings, buzzes]

192

[RUKO, HITOE gasp]

194
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:53,458
[YUZUKI]
Maybe it's Urith!

[hands clap]

197
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:58,875
[CHIYORI]
Please battle me!

198
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:00,083
[RUKO, HITOE]
Uh...

199
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,041
[CHIYORI]
It doesn't matter which one

200
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:02,416
of you guys I face either!

201
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,750
Just battle me, please!

202
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,250
Hey, get a hold of yourself!

203
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:09,333
If you lose one more time,
don't you know what'll happen?

204
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,125
Justice will prevail!

205
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:14,416
You're justice. Does make
us the evil ones?

206
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,333
[YUZUKI] Geez, you mean
you still don't get it,

207
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,791
even after what Fumio told us?

208
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,250
[AKIRA]
If they won't battle...

209
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,291
[RUKO, HITOE gasp]

210
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:25,000
[AKIRA]
...how's about doing it with me?

211
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,333
What are you waiting for?

212
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:29,833
Let's start the party.

213
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:32,916
Uh-oh! My Selector
Sense detects a villain!

214
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,333
[RUKO]
Wh-- Akira?

215
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:35,875
[ELDORA]
Cool. We'll fight.

216
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,250
[CHIYORI]
Huh?

217
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,958
[ELDORA]
Let's take this chick on.

218
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:40,750
Hey! I'm the Selector!

219
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,958
That's my call to make, not
yours, so pipe down, okay?

220
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,250
Why?

221
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,166
Oh wait, you're not
scared of losing, are you?

222
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,458
[growls] No, I'm not
scared of anything!

223
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:51,916
Let's do it, scar-face!

224
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,833
Chorizo's gonna mop
the floor with you and

225
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,500
end your wicked schemes!

226
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,500
No, don't!

227
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:01,250
[YUZUKI]
Wait, Chiyori, stop!

228
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:02,541
[RUKO]
Enough!

229
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,708
[CHIYORI yelling]

230
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,250
[AKIRA]
Hey!

231
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,041
You better get back here!

232
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:11,083
Lousy bitches!

233
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:14,750
[phone buzzes]

234
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:15,791
[gasps]

235
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:26,625
[GROUP panting]

236
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,375
[HITOE]
Ruko.

237
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:31,583
You don't think Akira's
going to chase us, do you?

238
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:32,958
[CHIYORI]
What gives?!

239
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,625
Are you two mental?!

240
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,666
Why did you guys
screw up my battle?

241
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:37,750
Because--

242
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:38,916
[YUZUKI]
If you really want to battle,

243
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,583
then we're not gonna stop you,

244
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,916
but be more selective
about who you fight, okay?

245
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,416
[ELDORA] Whatever. It
doesn't matter who we face.

246
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,458
[RUKO]
What?

247
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,000
That's right!

248
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,583
'Cause no matter who I square
off against, I'm gonna win!

249
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,791
[ELDORA laughs]
Pretty bold from someone

250
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:53,833
who's lost twice already!

251
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:55,250
[CHIYORI growls]
Yeah?!

252
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:56,833
Well, I can't wait to
win so I can get rid of

253
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,125
your snarky, back-talking
butt forever!

254
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,916
[ELDORA] Like having you
as a Selector is a picnic?

255
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
--Puh-leeze! 
--[CHIYORI] What?!

256
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,916
Why, you little creep!

257
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,666
[HITOE]
I'll do it. I'll battle Chiyori.

258
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,291
--No!
--[YUZUKI] Huh?!

259
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,833
She's lost twice already
now, so her wish...

260
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:16,583
Don't you know what'll
happen if you beat her?

261
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,291
It'll be corrupted.

262
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:19,583
Hitoe...

263
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:21,500
It's all right Ruko.

264
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:25,083
I'm doing this, because
Chiyori is only one loss away.

265
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:26,541
What?

266
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,791
[YUZUKI] Wait, don't tell
me you're gonna let her win.

267
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:30,166
[HITOE]
No.

268
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,291
You see, right before
I had my third loss

269
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,208
and my wish got reversed,

270
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:36,458
Midoriko said this to me.

271
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:37,333
Drop me!

272
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:38,041
[HITOE gasps]

273
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,500
Throw me away, now!

274
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,250
Midoriko...

275
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:44,166
She knew what would happen
to my wish if I lost.

276
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,875
She tried to warn me in her
own way and give me an out,

277
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:48,916
but I just wouldn't
listen to her.

278
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,875
My wish was to have friends,

279
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:54,291
so when I lost, I was
hurt and isolated.

280
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,833
But hers, it's
nothing like that.

281
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:58,750
[ELDORA]
Aah, just shut it!

282
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:01,500
Hey, I'm the one who gives
the orders, remember?

283
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,583
And once I'm the heroine
of the WIXOSS world,

284
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,375
your time of
punishment's coming!

285
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:06,791
[ELDORA]
That'll be the day!

286
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,625
[YUZUKI]
Good grief.

287
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:11,833
If Fumio didn't get through
to her, then I say do it.

288
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:16,166
[HITOE] If Chiyori wins,
that's another story, but,

289
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,416
if I beat her today,

290
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,791
then I can prevent her
wish from coming true.

291
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,458
But that's what bothers me.

292
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,166
What'll happen to
her if she loses

293
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,791
and her wish gets corrupted?

294
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,416
I wouldn't worry much about it.

295
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,833
Her wish is based on
her love of WIXOSS.

296
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:31,750
So the reverse of that should
make her end up hating the game.

297
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,125
If you ask me,

298
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,375
that shouldn't make her
current situation any worse.

299
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,833
[CHIYORI growls]
Now I'm really mad!

300
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,458
I'm gonna win, you'll see!

301
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:44,291
Then I'll never have to lay eyes
on you ever again, you jerk!

302
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:45,625
[ELDORA]
Talk to the hand.

303
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,250
--[HITOE] Chiyori.
--[CHIYORI] Hm?

304
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:48,708
I'll do it.

305
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,708
I'll battle you if that's
what you really want to do.

306
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:54,583
--[ELDORA] Oh?
--[CHIYORI] Uhh... Hm?

307
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,750
Yeah, of course I do!

308
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:59,000
Yay! It's battle time!

309
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:00,416
It's history in the making!

310
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,666
Behold, the first chapter
in a new tale of WIXOSS!

311
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,666
A new heroine takes the mantle
and forges into battle!

312
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:09,083
Are you ready?

313
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,125
Duh, I was born ready!

314
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:12,333
[HITOE, CHIYORI]
Open!

315

A battlefield. One just opened.

316
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,458
It seems that there are others.

317
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:23,125
More Selectors who hunger
for battle, just like I do.

318
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:25,333
[TAMA]
I know... But why?

319
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:26,791
Doesn't it hurt you?

320
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,333
[URITH (I)]
Of course, it does.

321
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,375
A little at least.

322
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:33,000
But soon enough the
pain will go away.

323
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,291
And I'm going to triumph.

324
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,875
I've stacked sufficient wins,

325
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,416
so just one more will
make my wish come true.

326
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,500
I'll become an LRIG again.

327
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:43,000
As for you...

328
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:46,500
You'll come outside and
gain Iona Urazoe's body.

329
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:47,666
[TAMA gasps]

330
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,750
[TAMA]
But why would I want that?

331
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,625
You told me how
much you like Ruko

332
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:53,791
and how you want to
be friends with her.

333
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:56,708
That is your
fondest wish, right?

334
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,083
If that's truly the case,

335
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:00,666
then you and I have
a mutual interest.

336
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:04,208
See, if we win this battle,
then this body will be yours.

337
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:07,333
That'll let you be friends
with Ru, not as a LRIG,

338
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:10,416
but as a human being like her.

339
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,500
[CHIYORI]
Here we go!

340
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,916
Chiyori Moonlight
Chorizo Attack!

341
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,583
That's the dumbest name yet!

342
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:22,875
Not bad, Chorizo!

343
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:24,291
[HITOE]
Are you okay, Yuzuki?

344
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:25,750
[YUZUKI]
I'm fine!

345
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:28,375
Hey, look, don't worry
about me, okay?

346
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,125
We can't lose this one!

347
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:31,791
Yuzuki, now, Grow!

348
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,625
[RUKO] Eldora and
Yuzuki are both strong.

349
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:38,375
They are, but this match
is already decided.

350
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:39,416
Right.

351
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,416
Since Yuzuki is
part of a red deck,

352
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,875
she can burn Chiyori's
Ener every turn.

353
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:47,041
Meaning the odds are stacked
pretty heavily against Chiyori,

354
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,416
aren't they?

355
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,958
They are, and Chiyori
probably doesn't know that.

356
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:52,500
However...

357
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:55,916
There's no way that Eldora,
being a LRIG, isn't aware of it.

358
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,416
[gasps]

359
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,291
[RUKO]
Wait a minute!

360
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,833
[YUZUKI yelling]

361
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:04,625
What? No!

362
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:07,583
If I keep this up, I'm
gonna lose! Oh, crap!

363
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:08,541
[ELDORA]
Chiyori, what now?

364
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,625
[CHIYORI]
I-I don't know!

365
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,541
[ELDORA]
Losing's not such a bad thing.

366
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:13,958
[CHIYORI]
What?

367
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,041
[ELDORA] You'll be able
to retire from battles,

368
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,333
and go back to being
a normal girl again.

369
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:19,458
Huh?

370
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:20,833
Eldora, she's--

371
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:21,958
[RUKO]
I knew it!

372
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,500
Eldora's doing the
same thing as Hitoe!

373
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,250
They're both trying to save
Chiyori from more battles,

374
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,541
from more pain and suffering.

375
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:30,375
[CHIYORI]
C'mon!

376
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,000
What're you saying?!

377
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:33,708
--[ELDORA] Hey, girls!
--[YUZUKI, HITOE gasp]

378
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,791
[ELDORA]
I know it's out of place

379
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,791
to ask this during
a battle, but...

380
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:39,083
Even if I lose here today,
do you think maybe

381
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,250
you guys can be friends
with this weirdo?

382
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,250
What?!

383
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,000
I know she looks all loony now,

384
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:46,000
but believe it or not,
back when I first met her,

385
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,958
she dressed super-modest,
and to be honest,

386
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,208
--was kind of a nerd.
--[CHIYORI] Hey!

387
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:50,958
Don't tell 'em that stuff!

388
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:59,333
[CHIYORI]
Wait. Did you just talk?

389
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,416
[ELDORA]
Yep, and my name is Eldora.

390
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,625
I'm pleased to
meet you, Selector!

391
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:05,083
Huh?

392
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:06,916
You're so cute!

393
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,791
Like super-adorable!

394
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,958
[STUDENTS]
Ssh!

395
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:14,208
[CHIYORI] This is so "you"!
Think it'll look good on me?

396
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:15,833
You trying to copy my style?

397
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:17,166
I'm fine with being pals,

398
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,208
but wearing matching
clothes is kinda dorky.

399
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:20,750
Well, if you don't like it,

400
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:23,000
then I guess you'll just have
to wear something else then.

401
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,000
[ELDORA]
I'm on paper, I can't!

402
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:27,708
Oh, yeah! Well, I think
maybe I can fix that!

403
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:28,583
Just a sec!

404
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:29,625
[ELDORA]
What?!

405
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,916
--Time to draw!
--[ELDORA] No! Stop!

406
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,541
[ELDORA] She can be a
real handful at times,

407
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:39,166
but to be honest, I was really
glad she was my Selector.

408
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,500
I'll admit she can be
a bit of a dingbat.

409
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:44,166
But still, she's a good
person and a lot of fun!

410
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,458
Eldora...

411
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:47,250
From the very beginning,

412
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,916
you were planning to lose
this battle, weren't you?

413
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,291
[CHIYORI]
Wait, is that true?

414
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:52,666
[ELDORA]
Not necessarily.

415
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,125
I just thought the odds were
against us, that's all.

416
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,333
It's not like an LRIG can
sway the results or anything.

417
00:17:57,416 --> 00:18:00,041
You meanie! Thanks for
not bothering to tell me!

418
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:02,125
Big jerk! You suck!

419
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:03,833
That was so evil of you!

420
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,583
--Take this!
--[ELDORA] Yep, I have to agree.

421
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:09,791
I'm a jerk, and that's why
we shouldn't be together.

422
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:10,708
[gasps]

423
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:11,916
[ELDORA]
I meant it when I said

424
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,166
I was glad you were
my Selector, but still.

425
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,916
You're slow-headed, naive,
and a total spaz.

426
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,250
You dress crazy and

427
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,166
you've gotta be the
goofiest gal I've ever met.

428
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,916
Eldora?

429
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,750
That's you, all right.

430
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:27,333
And I want you stay just like
that and never change, okay?

431
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:28,958
[gasps]

432
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,041
Wait, please!

433
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:31,416
[ELDORA]
All right then, Yuzuki.

434
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,250
Let's get this mess over with.

435
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,500
So Chiyori, what's next? Orochi?

436
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,083
We could go into the Ener Zone!

437
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:41,000
Or how 'bout going all out
with Arts for our next move?

438
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,166
Stop it!

439
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,000
[gasps]

440
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:45,666
Chiyori?

441
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,125
[CHIYORI]
Please.

442
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:50,416
This isn't over yet! Just
come on, stupid brain, work!

443
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,625
Think of a way to turn
the tables in this game!

444
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:55,916
'Cause if I don't,
it's gonna happen!

445
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,666
I'll be separated
from Eldora forever!

446
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,541
[CHIYORI]
Wait.

447
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:05,916
Now I've got it!

448
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,458
[ELDORA]
Huh?

449
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:10,041
[CHIYORI] Eldora, we'll use Life
Cloth with Spell, plus Rush!

450
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,750
[HITOE sighs]

451
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,125
[CHIYORI]
And we'll pair Arts,

452
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:15,458
Cloth Crush Flash with it
to cause direct damage!

453
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:17,500
Wait, what?
Chiyori, that's not--

454
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,916
Do it!

455
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,333
[ELDORA]
...going to work.

456
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:30,583
[CHIYORI gasps]

457
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:32,416
[ELDORA] With Yuzuki's
deck being what it is,

458
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,000
the odds are against you.

459
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:36,875
To be honest, if you don't pull
a Shiira within three turns,

460
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,041
Hitoe's gonna win.

461
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:39,375
[CHIYORI gasps]

462
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:40,458
I could lose.

463
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:42,000
[ELDORA]
Uh-uh, no way!

464
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,791
Don't you dare make yourself
lose on purpose, 'kay, Hitoe?

465
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:47,833
See, I wanna become a human
again one day, you know?

466
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:49,083
I do.

467
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:50,708
But if I'm stuck with
an unskilled Selector

468
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:54,250
like Chiyori here, then
that's never gonna happen.

469
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,083
Eldora...

470
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:58,666
[ELDORA]
Quit crying and keep going.

471
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,333
If you put a Burst into play,

472
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,125
you still have a
chance of winning.

00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:06,958
[CHIYORI gasps]

474
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:08,208
[ELDORA]
Turn end.

475
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,666
Orochi! Echidna!

476
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,708
Attack!

477
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:15,958
[ELDORA groans]

478
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,958
Are you okay?

479
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:20,875
[ELDORA]
It's your turn.

480
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,750
Eldora! You listen!

481
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:25,500
I promise that I'm
never gonna forget you!

482
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,083
That's turn end.

483
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,708
I swear to you that this isn't
gonna be the final chapter!

484
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:34,166
And when I get finally
get inside WIXOSS,

485
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:37,000
I'm gonna be the heroine
of the story, you'll see!

486
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:39,666
And then I'll make sure you're
the most minor character!

487
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,416
[HITOE]
Orochi.

488
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,500
Now, attack.

489
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:47,625
[ELDORA yells]

490
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:51,875
Eldora!

491
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:53,375
[ELDORA]
Chiyori...

492
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,125
Come on.

493
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:57,666
We've still got one last turn.

494
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,875
[CHIYORI]
No. Please!

495
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:00,958
That's enough!

496
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,000
[CHIYORI sobs]

497
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,458
[ELDORA]
But Chiyori...

498
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:11,125
Despite the trash
talk, I did like you.

499
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:14,416
[gasps]

500
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,541
[ELDORA]
Turn end.

501
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,750
I guess that's it.

502
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:21,583
All that's left...
is the finishing blow.

503

[foosteps]

505
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:44,458
You're a bit late.

506
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:45,708
"Aki-'ovely."

507
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,625
[AKIRA]
Not today.

508
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,416
No Aki-lucky.

509
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,000
No Aki-lovely.

510
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:54,916
I'm the one who'll beat you,

511
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,583
the one who'll save you.

512
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:02,166
[AKIRA]
Just... Akira Aoi.

--[VOICES chattering]
--[MAYU] Shut up.

514
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,250
[MAYU]
Shut up.

515
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:36,833
Shut up!

516
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:37,875
But that's wrong!

517
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:38,958
You're lying!

518
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:40,875
That's not how it works!

519
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:42,791
Or else, it's completely wrong.

520
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:44,500
Absolutely wrong!

521
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:46,958

"This Warmth is at its Limit."
