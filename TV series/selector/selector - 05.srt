1
00:00:08,458 --> 00:00:11,416
[KAZUKI] Attack with
Cannon. And end turn.

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,291
[BOY] Argh, dang,
Kazuki, you're good!

3
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:15,916
Okay, one more match!

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,125
I'm not gonna quit until
I win at least one of these!

5
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:20,625
'Kay, but you realize that
means you're never goin' home.

6
00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:22,416
[BOY] Wise guy, eh?

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,125
Can't believe we finally
caught you without your sister.

8
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,416
Come on, you don't have
to say it like that.

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,458
[GIRL A] Hey, guys?
Can we play too?

10
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:34,666
We got decks and all,
but I dunno.

11
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,541
The rules are kind of
hard to understand.

12
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:39,250
[GIRL B] You're good
at this. Right, Kazuki?

13
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:40,583
[KAZUKI] Huh?

14
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:42,875
If you don't mind, could
you teach me a few tricks?

15
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:45,375
Oh, uh. Sure.

16
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,000
[RUKO] A WIXOSS party?

17
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,250
It's really just an excuse
for people to play together.

18
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,916
When we did these before,
it was all guys, but lately,

19
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,791
a bunch of girls your age
have been showing up too.

20
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:31,333
You three should come!
Oh come on, please?

21
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:32,625
Just sign up already!

22
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:34,541
Oh, and you should all
wear matching outfits!

23
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:38,458
That would be adorable!
I could help out, if you like!

24
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:39,375
[MAN'S VOICE] Momoka?

25
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:40,833
Huh?

26
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:44,083
You finally came by!

27
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:46,500
Oh, and you can still sign
up the day of the event,

28
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,208
so don't be afraid to
stop by and check it out.

29
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:51,750
Um... Cool.

30
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:52,291
So?

31
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:53,541
[MOMOKA giggles]

32
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:54,916
I'll be done in a few minutes.

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,708
Hang tight.

34
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:57,166
[MAN] Cool.

35
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:00,166
Yuzuki?

36
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,791
Sorry. What do you think?
Are we in, or what?

37
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:10,291
[IONA] Participating as a
Selector without having a wish

38
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,541
is more than just wrong.

39
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,250
It's blasphemy.

40
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,416
[YUZUKI] I'm going either way!

41
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,875
I might even find another
Selector to battle!

42
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:24,166
Yeah... But my wish already--

43
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,583
Right. It already came true.

44
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,000
Uh-huh.

45
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:31,208
So if I won, it wouldn't
be fair to the person I beat.

46
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,750
There's no need to
be greedy, after all.

47
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:36,583
But if the other player isn't
a Selector, it'll be fine.

48
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:39,333
Meaning we're free to fight
all the dudes we want.

49
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:41,916
Good point! As long as
nobody's dreams are at stake,

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,083
I'm definitely up
for a battle or two!

51
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:45,333
Yeah!

52
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:49,083
Sure. That sounds okay.
I suppose I'm on board.

53
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:52,416
If nothing else, it's a chance
to try out my new deck.

54
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,750
Right, Midoriko?

55
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,500
[HITOE gasps]

56
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:57,458
[HITOE] Midoriko?

57
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,583
Oh. Mm-hmm.

58
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,000
Okay! Sweet!

59
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,458
[HITOE &amp; RUKO giggle]

60
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,333
[YUZUKI] So, ladies, I was
thinking about Momoka's idea

61
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,375
for us to match our outfits.
We could be like a pop group!

62
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:14,750
Huh?

63
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:17,875
[HITOE] That's cute,
but... kinda pricey.

64
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,375
Yeah, we spent
too much on cards.

65
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:22,625
Oh well.

66
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,166
Oh! Hey, look!

67
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,958
[YUZUKI] Now that's more
in our price range!

68
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:30,416
It's not quite as fancy. But
we can still match with these!

69
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,750
Scrunchies, huh?

70
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,833
Mm-hmm! We might not
look much like a pop group.

71
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,000
But try it!

72
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,333
[HITOE gasps]

73
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:38,375
Well, you gotta go with
green to match your deck!

74
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:39,791
Ahh...

75
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:40,791
[HITOE giggles]

76
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,166
Oh, cool,
I found a red one.

77
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,250
Ruko's deck is white.
Huh... No luck.

78
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,166
You can take this
weird-looking one instead.

79
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,041
Don't give me
the icky one!

80
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,291
[YUZUKI] How's this?

81
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:51,750
[RUKO] You're picking
ugly ones on purpose!

82
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:52,875
Stop it!

83
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:55,250
[YUZUKI] Okay, sorry!

84
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:57,458
[HITOE] And then,

85
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:59,041
we all bought these
matching scrunchies!

86
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:02,208
That's lovely! And I'm thrilled
that you're making new friends.

87
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,500
But your hair is still
wet from your shower.

88
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:07,208
Your scrunchie is
going to mess it up.

89
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:08,750
It's fine! So, anyway.

90
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,458
Ruko almost got this
weird-looking one,

91
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,125
but she ended up
with aqua instead,

92
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,708
even though her
deck is white.

93
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:15,791
[HITOE'S MOTHER] All right, you
can tell me all about it later,

94
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:18,708
but first, go dry your hair,
and put something warmer on!

95
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,000
You're going to
catch your death.

96
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:22,416
[HITOE] Yes ma'am.

97
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,875
[MIDORIKO sighs]

98
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:27,416
Aw. It did get all messed up!

99
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,000
Yeep! And the
scrunchie's all damp, too!

100
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,375
Of course it is.

101
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:35,000
Ugh. I'm so stupid.

102
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:36,041
[MIDORIKO] Hitoe?

103
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,916
Yeah, what is it?

104
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,291
I think it's best
if you get rid of me.

105
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,833
Wha--! Get rid of you? Why?

106
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:45,000
[MIDORIKO] Your wish
already came true.

107
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:48,583
There's no need for
you to battle anymore.

108
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,875
Sure. But who
cares about that?

109
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:53,250
I like you a whole
bunch, Midoriko.

110
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,916
I would never want
to get rid of you!

111
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,625
I'm afraid that if you keep me,
something might happen.

112
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:00,083
Something terrible.

113
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:03,916
[HITOE] So what?

114
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,833
[MIDORIKO gasps]

115
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:10,791
[HITOE] Before I even met Ruko
and Yuzuki, you were my friend,

116
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:13,458
Midoriko, and nothing
will change that!

117
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,000
Oh, Hitoe...

118
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,666
[HITOE] I don't want to hear
you talk like that ever again!

119
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,000
Oh yeah. Still need
to dry my hair.

120
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:27,166
[YUZUKI grunts softly]

121
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,416
Aw! I suck.

122
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,458
[KAZUKI] Something wrong?

123
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:32,333
Not really.

124
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:34,916
I just can't get my hair
tied up right, that's all.

125
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,916
You are kind of clumsy
with that stuff.

126
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,416
Here, let me get it for you.

127
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,750
Huh?

128
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,250
No, it's fine! Really!

129
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:42,666
[KAZUKI] Don't freak out.

130
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,041
[YUZUKI] I'm not freaking out!
I just need to learn!

131
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,750
[RUKO] It's cold!

132
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:57,375
Oh. Here, look! There's a
big giraffe on the building!

133
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:02,583
Cool! Is it gonna
battle the other giraffe?

134
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:06,458
Tama. Not everything is
about battles, you know?

135
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:09,458
I am right.
So battle me.

136
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:10,916
[RUKO gasps]

137
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:16,291
[RUKO] Iona was
really pretty, but, uh,

138
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,125
she was also kind of scary.

139
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:19,083
Don't you think?

140
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:21,250
Tama can beat
all the scaries!

141
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:22,708
[RUKO chuckles]

142
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:29,250
[turnstile beeps]

143
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:36,541
[HITOE] Looks like
I'm here a bit early.

144
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:39,541
I made it to the
meeting spot...

145
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,375
I'll be waiting...

146
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:42,833
And send.

147
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,958
[HITOE] It's funny,
but when I'm standing

148
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:53,291
in a big crowd like this. I
almost feel like a normal girl.

149
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:56,208
[MIDORIKO] Come on, Hitoe,
you are a normal girl.

150
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:58,458
I'll take your
word for it.

151
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,208
It's nice out.

152
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:08,541
[HITOE] When I first moved
to Tokyo, somehow, I felt like

153
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,291
there wasn't a sky here.

154
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:13,375
Thanks to all the
skyscrapers and stuff.

155
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:17,625
But there it is, as bright
and blue as it's ever been.

156
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:24,083
All this time, I never
noticed. How sad.

157
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,875
I just needed to look up.

158
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:28,583
Hitoe...

Please! Hurry!

161
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:41,833

[train doors ding]

163
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:44,375
[YUZUKI] Ruko! Let's go!

164
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:45,708
[RUKO] I'm sorry!

165
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,125
There were a whole bunch
of people in the bathroom

166
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,750
and the kid behind me was
about to go in her pants,

167
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,291
so I let her cut in line.

168
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:51,833
[YUZUKI] We're making
Hitoe wait!

169
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:53,875
Okay, okay!

170
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:56,541
[YUZUKI] Huh. She
said she'd be here.

171
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,208
Too short! I can't see!

172
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,000
Guessing you came
up empty too?

173
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:07,833
Uh-huh.

174
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,875
[YUZUKI] She isn't answering
my texts, either.

175
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:13,125
Maybe she got mad at us
because we were late.

176
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:16,000
She wouldn't lose her temper
over something like that.

177
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:17,875
Right? Back me up
on this, Hanayo.

178
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:20,208
[YUZUKI] Hanayo?

179
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,083
Oh. Yeah, of course.

Somethin' goin' on, Tama?

183
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:28,250
There's a battlefield
somewhere! Close!

184
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,500
What?! Around here?

Midoriko! I'm sorry!

189
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,750
No. Don't worry about me.

190
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:50,583
But it's my fault
you're suffering!

191
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:53,000
I'll try to end this
quickly, okay?

192
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:55,083
I don't need to win,
I'll lose on purpose.

193

Please! You have
to keep fighting!

194
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,291
You can't give up!

195
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:02,625
It's fine. Really. The only
wish I wanted already came true.

196
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,541
And now, neither one
of us have to go through

197

these painful battles anymore!

Huh?

There's something important
I haven't told you.

What do you mean?

202
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:18,541
You know all about winning
and becoming an Eternal Girl.

203
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,708
Your wish.

204
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:23,208
[YUZUKI] Hitoe?

205
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:24,208
Where did you go?

--[YUZUKI] Hitoe!

[TAMA] Hmm...

213

went bye-bye.

Hey, Hanayo, do you
know anything about this?

Hey. Look!

220
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,666

Wha-What do you want?
How do you know my name?

[HITOE screams]

00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:04,875
[HANAYO] Stand back!
Don't touch her!

230

Whoever you are,
leave me alone!

231
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,000
I...

232
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:11,083
[TAMA] Hitoe... lost.

233
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:13,541
[RUKO] What?

234
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,750
Tama is not sensing
her Selector power.

235
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,333
She had a battle and lost.

236
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:18,541
No...

237
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:21,375
Are you saying she's
not a Selector anymore?

238
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:23,125
Did something messed
up happen to her

239
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:25,000
'cause she lost
her third battle?

240
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:26,458
What is this?

241
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:30,041
[YUZUKI] Hanayo!

242
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:36,500
After three losses, your
status as a Selector is revoked.

243
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:39,083
As for your wish,
it becomes corrupted.

244
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:40,166
[RUKO gasps]

245
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,708
[YUZUKI] You mean like
you get a curse?

246
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:43,208
[HANAYO] Yes.

247
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:47,916
For example, let's say your
wish was to become wealthy.

248
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,916
After losing three battles,
not only would that wish

249
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,250
fail to come true, you
would plummet into poverty.

250
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,666
[HANAYO] If your wish was
to be an expert pianist,

251
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,708
you wouldn't just lose your
piano. Something would happen

252
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:04,916
that would prevent you
from playing ever again.

253
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,458
Something to ensure your
wish could never come true.

254
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:10,625
That's awful.

255
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:14,083
I'm not really getting this.
So, what happened to Hitoe?

256
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:17,541
All I can tell you is her
wish was to "make friends".

257
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:21,416
You can imagine what a
corruption of that would be.

258
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,333
So, you're saying
she lost her friends?

259
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:26,000
[HANAYO sighs]

260
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,208
Far worse than that.

261
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:30,833
She can never make
friends again.

262
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:33,541
You saw what
state she was in.

263
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:36,458
Seems if anyone has even the
potential to be her friend,

264
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:39,250
her body goes through
some sort of violent shock

265
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,583
when they try to approach her.

266
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:42,958
No way!

267
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:45,458
[HANAYO] Horrible, but
unfortunately, there's more.

268
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:48,958
With her third loss, not only
is her Selector status gone,

269
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:51,791
so are all her memories
related to those battles,

270
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:54,125
as if they never
even took place.

271
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:57,416
[HITOE] What is this?

272
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,416
What's happening? I'm scared!

273
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:04,750
[YUZUKI] Hitoe, what's wrong?

274
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:08,375
[HITOE] How did they
know me? Who were they?

275
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,125
[HITOE grunts]

276
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,666
[HITOE] That didn't hurt me.

277
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,666
[HITOE] Why...?

278
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:24,916
[HITOE grunts]

279
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,375
[HITOE] Oh, God! Why?!
Why does this hurt?

280
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:32,416
I can't! No! It hurts
just thinking about them!

281
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,083
Make it stop!

282
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,833
That's it!

283
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:47,458
I'll win and wish for Hitoe
to go back to normal!

284
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,750
I finally have a dream
worth fighting for!

285
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,000
I didn't think of that! Right!

286
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:52,208
[HANAYO] It won't work.

287
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,750
[BOTH] Huh?

288
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:56,583
Even though it didn't happen
as a result of winning battles,

289
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,500
her wish did come true.

290
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:02,541
The corruption cannot be undone
by another Selector's wish.

291
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,333
What the hell?!

292
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:06,666
That's kind of an important
detail you decided to keep

293
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,125
secret from me!

294
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:11,708
Damn it, why won't
you say something?!

295
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:13,708
Hanayo!

296
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:17,083
[YUZUKI whimpers]

297
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:20,625

[MIDORIKO sighs]

300
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:31,625
Yeah the sky would
get cloudy, wouldn't it?

301
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:35,416
Looks like rain soon, too.

302
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,500
I know I don't have
any right to cry.

303
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,750
After ruining such
an innocent wish,

304
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:43,750
any fate I face
will be too kind.

305
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:57,791
I really did care
for you, Hitoe.

306
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:01,291
And yet, after this,
I wish that we had

307
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:03,708
never even met each other.

308
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,375
[MIDORIKO sobs]

Goodbye...

311
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:36,083
[YUZUKI] I trusted you
all this time, Hanayo.

312
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:39,708
I don't know what to do.
I'm afraid of you!

313
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,083
You can get rid of me.

314
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:48,708
[HANAYO] It'll be easy.
Just throw me away.

315
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:51,041
That's not funny!

I figured it might be
Yuzu-poo and the gals,

up, you know?
