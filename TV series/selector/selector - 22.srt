[CHIYORI] W-Wait!
Who are you? What do you want?

00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:24,208
Um, well, you see--

00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:26,291
Want me to donate
to your religion?

8
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:27,750
Or join some pyramid scheme?

00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:29,250
Too bad!
I don't have any money!

No, we just--

[CHIYORI gasps]
What?

12
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:36,583
We just want to
ask you if we can be friends.

13
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:38,416
If you wouldn't mind.

[CHIYORI]
Say what?!

15
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:46,708
This has gotta be
some kind of trick!

16
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:47,958
Right!

17
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:49,375
There's no way anyone
would wanna be friends

18
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:51,250
with someone like me!

19
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:54,083
You guys are just
trying to rob me!

20
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:55,708
[sobbing]

[HITOE]
Oh, no.

22
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:00,291
[ELDORA]
Well, at least you tried.

23
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:03,375
I feel bad.

24
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:06,000
This is never gonna work
if she doesn't trust us.

25
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:07,541
[ELDORA]
Ah, just give her time.

26
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:09,833
I'm sure she'll come around.

27
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:12,375
I bet she'll be all,
"Yeah, let's all be friends,

28
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:14,750
like you asked,
is that okay?"

29
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:17,125
Something dumb like that.

30
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:19,416
This is really embarrassing.

31
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,125
[ELDORA] Well, when
that finally happens,

32
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:23,958
just promise you'll treat
my partner good, 'kay?

33
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:25,666
Here goes!

34
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,666
See ya, card! Bye!

35
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,083
Wait! You can just climb
out of a card that way?

36
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:31,125
[ELDORA]
Yep!

37
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:34,666
Well, you girls
take care now, you hear?

--[ELDORA humming]
--[RUKO] Uh...

[RUKO]
Eldora...

40
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:49,708
She really did love Chiyori.

41
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:51,375
That was so sweet of her.

42
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:53,250
She's not the only nice LRIG.

43
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:55,041
Yuzuki's done so much for me.

44
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:56,250
I'm so grateful.

45
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:57,625
C'mon, stop.

46
00:01:57,708 --> 00:02:01,250
And besides,
it's only natural isn't it?

47
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:03,916
We think of LRIGs
as tricking their Selectors,

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,250
but I realized something
when I became one.

49
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:08,666
LRIGs are like any
other girl in this game.

50
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,166
They get hurt, too.

51
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,250
And some of them make
the ultimate sacrifice

52
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:13,750
for their Selectors.

53
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:16,541
Midoriko.

54
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:17,875
Yeah, you're right.

55
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:19,791
All of the girls who are
involved in these Battles

56
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:21,291
get hurt.

57
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:23,833
We're all the same.

00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:24,875
[IONA]
No.

59
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:30,000
[IONA] There is one girl who's
different from all the others.

60
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,291
That's Mayu.

61
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:33,708
She's jealous of
all the other girls.

62
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:37,500
And that's why she crushes
their wishes the way she does.

63
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:38,666
Ruko.

64
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,708
I need you to take me somewhere.

65
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:43,208
To Urith.

66
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,708
All right, here it is.

67
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:27,958
[URITH (I)]
Construction's almost done,

68
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:31,583
and this is going to be
my room, believe it or not.

69
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,250
You weren't here
for the fan event,

70
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:36,333
but I fought against Ruko
in this very building.

71
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:42,833
She was as beautiful
as she was powerful.

00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,625
You, on the other hand...

74
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,916
You're the exact
opposite of Ruko.

75
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,666
Pathetic.

76
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,375
Despite all of your tough talk,

77
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:57,333
you haven't been able
to kill anybody.

Don't you remember
what you said?

[URITH (I)] And it wasn't just
her wish, but her very life

82

that you snatched
away from her.

--Some victory.
--[AKIRA] I don't care!

It never mattered to me whether
that girl was alive or dead.

87
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:25,333
Back then, a win was a win.

88
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,541
I was so different.

What are you saying?

Now you look on the outside
just like you do on the inside.

You're worried about your face

soul is twisted.

She was right.

99
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:02,916
Every single thing about me
was filthy and disgusting.

100
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,791
Yet, still,
you took your hands.

101
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:06,916
Instead of being repulsed,

102
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,375
you reached down
deep within my soul.

103
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:12,000
I truly thought you were
trying to save me then.

104
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,166
You like to
find things of beauty

105
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,041
and break them into
tiny pieces, don't you?

106
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,583
You take things
that are truly lovely

107
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,958
and make them
filthy and corrupt.

108
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:25,416
You used me to
get what you wanted.

109
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,708
I was simply a pawn.

110
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:30,500
Just a tool you used
to force Ruko to fight you.

111
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,583
My, how surprising.

112
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:35,083
And here I thought
you were a hopeless idiot.

113
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,958
Perhaps I should've given
you an inkling of credit.

114

So I suppose now you
wanna have your revenge?

115
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:43,333
Though the odds of you
doing so are laughable,

116
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:46,500
what do you hope to gain by
beating me in a Selector battle?

117

Do you want
to see me ruined,

118
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:49,958
like you did the last Iona?

Or just maybe...

You want to put a scar on me

00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:56,083
that would mirror the
nasty one you're sporting?

The scar that I'll give you...

125
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,916
It will be a pure
and beautiful wound

126
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,583
inflicted on you
by my boundless love.

127
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,500
But it's also that
same deep, abiding love

128
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:14,666
I have for you that's
gonna heal that scar in turn.

129
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,458
I'll become an LRIG.

130
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:19,083
And once I've turned back
into a human again,

131
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:21,416
the first thing that I'm
gonna do is track you down.

132
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,625
And then scar you.

133
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,375
Then I'll battle
again for my wish,

134
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,416
and guess what
that's gonna be?

135
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,291
To heal your scar.

136
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,625
Then I'll be
an LRIG again,

137
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:36,166
and then a human,
and an LRIG after that.

138
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:40,166
And then every single time,
from here on out,

139
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,916
I'm gonna leave
a scar on your body.

140
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,750
A physical reminder
of something.

141
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:52,041
Akira Aoi's love for Urith.
Like the last one I left!

142
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,583
And see, by doing this,

143
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,375
you won't be able to
simply pull my strings

144
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:57,791
and get rid
of me that easily!

145
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:00,125
I'm gonna leave a
permanent mark on you.

146
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:03,291
One that'll make sure
you'll never forget me!

147
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,166
[URITH (I)]
You're an interesting one.

148
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,916
I'll give you that.

149
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:12,583
All right.
Then let's get to it!

150

If you're battle-hungry,
then Tama and I are starving.

[TAMA]
Ru... I'm sorry.

152
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,541
You see...

153
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:24,583
During that last battle, when
those dark feelings came in

154
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:29,083
and took control of me,
I had a thought.

155
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,291
[TAMA] If that wish
could come true...

156
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:32,291
My wish...

157
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:35,416
I'd do anything
to make it happen.

158
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,000
Anything.

159
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:40,708
Even if I make people cry!

You wanna see Iona?

[RUKO] Yes, it's important
we speak with her right away.

Oh, hey, I remember you.

You're Iona and
Akira's friend, right?

166
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,083
How's Iona's wound?

167
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:01,166
Wait, what?

[STAFF B]
Hold on a second.

[HITOE] A Battle put
Urith in the hospital?

172
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:10,583
That's odd.

173
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:11,833
Yeah, I know.

174
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:13,791
I wonder what really happened.

[YUZUKI] I'm getting
a bad vibe from this, guys.

What's wrong, Yuzuki?

179
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,291
[YUZUKI] A Battlefield
just opened up somewhere!

180

[RUKO]
Huh?

181
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:26,000
Can we find out
who's battling?

182
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,250
Um, maybe.

183
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,250
Iona, can you tell us
what's going on?

184
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:33,041
It's strange,
but I can't sense much.

185
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:36,500
It's almost as if the battle
is being hidden by something.

186
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:37,750
Or by someone.

187

Stay away, I don't want
you to see me like this.

Hey, let's go get
something to drink.

203
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,458
Something's wrong.

00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:44,916
You've been
acting strange lately.

You know that, right?

206
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,291
So that explains it.

00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:55,291
All those looks
you've been giving me.

have I been acting strange?

"If you want to
meet Iona Urazoe..."

"Head here."

00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,125
[IONA]
That email was very literal.

231
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,125
What?

232
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,208
This isn't Urith anymore.

233
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:10,041
It's the real Iona.

234
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,583
So you mean the first
one and not someone else

235
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,791
using her body, the way
Urith or an LRIG would?

00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,416
[IONA (REAL)]
Lrig.

237
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:28,333
[IONA (REAL)]
Been awhile, hasn't it, Lrig?

238
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,000
How strange.

239
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,875
We meet once again and
you look just like me now.

240
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:36,166
Huh? You just call her Lrig?

241
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,250
Yes, of course.

242
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,458
It's what I've
always called her.

243
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:43,875
[IONA]
LRIG.

[IONA (REAL)]
Lrig?

245
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:47,375
So that's your name, is it?

246
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:51,125
Not exactly, but I don't
have one, so that'll do for now.

247
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:52,708
You're such a strange girl.

248
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:55,083
[IONA]
So what's your fondest wish?

249
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:56,791
Fondest wish?

250
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,166
Let me see...

251
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,958
To be honest, I wish I
wasn't Iona Urazoe anymore.

252
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:14,666
You see, back then, everyone had
such high expectations of me.

253
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,375
I needed to not only live up
to the Urazoe name,

254
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:20,750
but also to my
responsibilities as a model.

255
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,166
I had little time for myself.

256
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:28,375
[IONA (REAL)] The closest thing
I had to a friend was Lrig.

257
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:31,041
She didn't say much
and I didn't ask much.

258
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:34,083
And amidst all the craziness,
I found playing WIXOSS

259
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,916
to be relaxing, even fun.

260
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,791
Lrig and I battled
alongside each other.

261
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,375
And then...

262
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,208
An Eternal Girl was born.

263
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,750
I went to the White Room,
met Mayu,

264
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,750
and found out
what had happened.

265
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,041
[MAYU]
Understand now?

266
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:01,208
You see what Selector
Battles are all about?

267
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:03,541
Are you upset?

268
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:04,708
Don't worry.

269
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:06,583
All you have to do
is become an LRIG

270
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:09,250
and drag a Selector
into Battle like I said.

271
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,083
[IONA (REAL)]
It doesn't matter.

272
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:16,916
My wish to no longer be
Iona Urazoe already came true.

273
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,750
So there's no reason
for me to battle anymore.

274
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:22,291
[MAYU]
Wait...

275
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:25,333
You don't care about
becoming a human again?

276
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:26,625
Your life is over.

277
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,333
Are you okay with that?

278
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,208
[IONA (REAL)]
Yes. It's fine.

279
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:31,416
[MAYU]
But that's wrong!

280
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,625
You're lying!

281
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:33,541
[IONA (REAL)]
What?

282
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:35,083
[MAYU]
That's not how it works!

283
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,000
Tell me this is terrible!

284
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,750
Tell me you want to become
a human again no matter what!

285
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,833
Let me hear you scream
and wail for it!

286
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:43,666
Or else it's completely wrong!

287
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,833
Absolutely wrong!

288
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:49,666
[IONA (REAL)]
And then, I became an LRIG.

289
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:54,916
Afterwards, I was an
LRIG for two other Selectors,

290
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,291
but knowing what I did, I
never coerced them into Battle.

291
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,791
Still...

292
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:03,291
They dreamt about
their wishes coming true.

293
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:06,250
So they battled anyway, right?

294
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,541
What's more, the Selectors
I was paired with

295
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:10,000
weren't suited for Battle.

296
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,500
They lost every single one
that they fought in.

297
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:16,458
As a result of that,
their wishes were reversed.

298
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,333
Sad.

299
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,375
Mayu didn't like me very much.

300
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:21,583
That's why she did what she did.

301
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,083
It makes sense.

302
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:25,500
Why else would she assign me
as an LRIG to weaker girls?

303
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:26,791
She'd do that?

304
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:30,000
Honestly,
I didn't care that much.

305
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:33,791
About myself, or even
about the other girls, but...

306
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,291
With all the tears I've seen,

307
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,750
this game became
really hard to bear.

308
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,166
And then I felt
something strange.

309
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,458
My real body...

310
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,166
This one, I mean...

311
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,500
It became so hollow.

312
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,166
[YUZUKI]
Hollow?

313
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,583
It was then I knew
what I had to do.

314
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,375
I needed to go back.

315
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:56,458
If no one resided
in Iona Urazoe's body,

316
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,250
then my life
would truly end.

317
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,958
[HITOE gasps]
I see now.

318
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:02,916
If Urith is no longer in
Iona's body, then that means--

319
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,125
[YUZUKI]
Her wish must have come true,

320
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,708
and an Eternal Girl was born!

321
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:06,958
This is complicated!

322
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:09,375
Yeah, like why the heck
is Iona's body hollow?

323
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:10,750
And if Urith became an LRIG,

324
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:13,125
then Tama should be a
human now, shouldn't she?

325
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:14,916
And in Iona's real body, too!

326
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,583
Yeah.

327
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:17,291
Right, Iona?

328
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,916
That's right, but Tama refused.

329
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,416
Wha--Refused?

330
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,125
Goodness, why didn't
you become Iona Urazoe?

331
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:36,125
No one would ever want to remain
as an LRIG, wouldn't you agree?

332
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:36,958
[TAMA]
I don't.

333
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,125
[MAYU]
Yes, you do.

334
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:40,083
I sensed your feelings.

335
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,750
You want to be human.

336
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,458
That way you can eat ice cream
with Ru under the summer sun

337
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:46,458
and buy scrunchies together.

338
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:49,750
Yes, but I'm originally a card.

339
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,833
I'm not a human.

340
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:53,416
If I were to become one,

341
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,125
that means I'd have
to take someone's body.

342
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:59,541
They'd become an LRIG, and that
could make them sad and lonely--

343
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,666
No more excuses!

344
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,708
I told you I could
sense your feelings!

345
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:05,875
So I know,
for that wish of yours,

346
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,625
you'd do anything!

347
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:11,666
Even if that meant you had to
make someone else miserable!

348
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,416
[TAMA] Urith unleashed
the bad version of me.

349
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,708
I don't want that me
to come out again.

350
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:19,750
[TAMA gasps]
But Ru...

351
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,333
I can sense her.

352
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,291
She's still looking
everywhere for me,

353
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,416
even after what
happened last time.

354
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,541
But...

355
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,875
Even though I wish
I could be with her,

356
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:32,500
Ru'll never
be able to find me.

357
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,625
Because the bad Tama
isn't the same Tama

358
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:37,291
that Ru knows and loves!

359
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,416
And that's why I
won't become a human,

360
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:43,125
because I can't let Ru find me,
even if it breaks my heart.

361
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:46,583
Ru and I were friends,
but we can't ever be again.

362
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:47,708
Besides...

363
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,416
I broke the promise
I made to her

364
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,000
so that her wish
could come true!

365
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,791
[RUKO] The thing is,
I have a wish to fight for!

366
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,291
It's to save you.

367
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,500
You and Tama!

368
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:02,708
[RUKO] Plus everyone else
who became LRIGs!

369
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:05,291
You'll see! I swear!

370
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,291
I'll bring you all
back to normal!

371
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,291
[TAMA]
That's Ru's wish.

372
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:12,791
I'm gonna do whatever it
takes to make it come true!

373
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,958
[IONA (REAL)]
Thanks for walking me here.

374
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:23,916
It's been a pleasure.
Be safe now.

375
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,333
You do the same.

376
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,666
[YUZUKI] This might be
weird coming from me,

377
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,666
but no more
Selector Battles, 'kay?

378
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:33,000
Never again, understand me?

379
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:36,458
Um... Anything to add, Iona?

380
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:38,875
Take care.

381
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:42,041
You know, I have to
give you credit, Lrig.

382
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,958
It seems you've grown up
a bit since last time.

383
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,416
Thank you.

384
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,291
And I'm sorry.

385
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:00,375
[YUZUKI]
Tama.

386
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,250
She's with Mayu now.

387
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,750
[YUZUKI] Just when we decide
to talk to Mayu, this happens.

388
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:11,458
That plan's shot.

389
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:12,583
No, not yet.

390
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:14,000
What?

391
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:16,083
I think the only thing
that's changed is the order.

392
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,291
Our plan was to get
her out of that room,

393
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,791
and then to convince her
to stop all these battles.

394
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,958
But now I just need
to win a few of them.

395
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:26,166
I'll become an LRIG and get
transported to the White Room.

396
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,791
To where Mayu and Tama are.

397
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,041
[gasps]

398
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:30,458
[RUKO] Once I'm there,
I'm sure I can get Mayu

399
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:31,541
to change her mind.

400
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:33,416
That's too dangerous,
Ruko, don't!

401
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,333
But we have to
get to her somehow.

402
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:36,333
[YUZUKI]
Are you nuts?

403
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:38,125
You can't face her alone!

404
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:40,833
[IONA]
Don't worry, she won't.

405
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:43,791
It's fine. I'll protect you.

406
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,458
Iona.

407
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:48,791
[RUKO]
Wait!

408
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,416
That's not right.

409
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,416
We've been calling
her "Iona" all this time,

410
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,250
but that was never even
her name in the first place!

411
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:57,083
Oh. Good point.

412
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,458
[IONA]
I'm fine with "Iona."

413
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:01,416
No way!
Let's come up with new name!

414
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:06,125
We can think
of something. Right?

415
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:09,791
Sure thing! What should it be?

416
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:10,958
[HITOE]
Uh...

417
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:12,708
Is there any word
that's your favorite?

418
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,541
[YUZUKI] Yeah, like how
Chiyori's was "Chorizo"

419
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,041
and she said she
wanted to be called that

420
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:17,416
when she became an LRIG.

421
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,875
What's yours?

422
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,500
Let me think.

423
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:23,083
[gasps]

424
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,666
[IONA]
It's snow.

425
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,708
[RUKO, HITOE gasp]

426
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,416
[IONA]
My favorite thing.

427
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,666
That's it. It's snow.

428
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,125
[IONA]
Back in that room with Mayu...

429
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:49,291
[MAYU]
Shut up!

430
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,083
[MAYU sobbing]

431
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,625
[MAYU]
Shut up. Shut up!

432
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:57,625
[IONA] We could never venture
into the outside world,

433
00:20:57,708 --> 00:21:01,000
but we could still
hear it through our walls.

434
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:03,875
But sometimes it was silent.

435
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,500
[IONA]
The snow...

436
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:12,416
...took away all of those sounds
we didn't want to hear.

437
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,916
It was as if it
erased the entire world.

438
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,791
The snow was cold, yet kind.

439
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:23,583
Snow, huh?

440
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:26,125
What about "Yuki"?

441
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:27,916
[YUZUKI]
Yeah, "Yuki" means "snow"

442
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,041
and it's really pretty, too!

443
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:31,083
It is!

444
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,666
Wow, that's the
perfect name, Ruko!

445
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,750
"Yuki."

446
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:37,916
I like that. "Yuki."

447
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,291
[YUZUKI] Now we don't
have to say "LRIG Iona"

448
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:41,250
and "human Iona" or whatever.

449
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,208
Ah! Oh, darn, it totally
slipped my mind!

450
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:46,375
I meant to ask Iona about
who sent us that text

451
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,291
that told us
where to find her.

452
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:49,458
[RUKO]
Oh, right!

453
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:52,083
Ah, geez, that was
really stupid of us.

454
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:53,666
[IONA]
Is there an e-mail address?

455
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,000
[HITOE]
Oh, yeah.

456
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:57,875
Looks like their handle
is "Shadow Prince."

457
00:21:57,958 --> 00:22:00,125
[RUKO] Do you guys know
anyone who goes by that name?

458
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:01,250
[gasps]

459
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:07,541
[YUZUKI]
Um, yeah. I do.

460
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:12,041
[MAYU]
Shiro.

461
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:13,750
You know what?

462
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:18,000
[MAYU]
Kuro is the bad girl.

463
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:20,291
And you're the good one.

464
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:21,833
Even so...

465
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:24,291
You're far more
spiteful than she is.

466
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:26,291
Spiteful? I am?

467
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:27,958
Let me show you.

468
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:30,625
You're like a beautiful rose.

469
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:33,833
[MAYU]
But one with thorns!

470
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:35,250
You cut me deeply!

471
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:36,833
And leave me alone
here to wither!

472
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:37,875
[gasps]

473
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:44,625
[MAYU] So now I've decided
to lock you away for good!

474
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:46,166
I'm such a fool!

475
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,541
Why did I let you go?

476
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:49,458
I never will again!

477
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:53,833
[TAMA]
No, please!

478
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:55,625
Ru!

479
