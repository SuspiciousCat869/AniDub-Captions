00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:11,791
[TAMA]
There exists a room of sorrow.

2
00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:16,416
It has a window, and the views
from it can be seen clearly.

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,041
Everyone besides me,
they look so happy.

4
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:23,458
I can see them and
the world they live in

5
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:25,083
moving and changing,

6
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:27,333
but I'm frozen in place here.

7
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:29,208
In this lonely room,

8
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:32,916
I waited for the day
I could finally go outside.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,833
However, there are
no doors in this place.

10
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:41,125
So because of this, I want
the world outside the window

11
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:45,083
to stop and stand still,
just like it is in here.

12
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,583
And that is my only wish.

13
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:21,666
[HANAYO (Y)]
You actually came.

14
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,208
I'm surprised,
but I'm glad you did.

15
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,833
Yeah, this isn't
awkward at all, huh?

16
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:28,875
[HANAYO (Y) laughs]
I bet.

17
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:31,333
But I wanted to talk
to you about something.

18
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:33,625
[YUZUKI]
Yeah, what?

19
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:36,250
You hate me, don't you?

20
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:38,041
I can't blame you.

21
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,583
Yuzuki...

22
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:42,666
[YUZUKI]
How far did you go with him?

23
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,166
[HANAYO (Y)]
How far?

24
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,875
A kiss, that's it.

25
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:49,250
You... kissed him?

26
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:51,125
[YUZUKI]
No, it's okay!

27
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:54,208
Look, you've gotta remember
that was my wish, too.

28
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,583
All Hanayo did was fulfill it.

29
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:58,500
She did what I couldn't.

30
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:00,083
She kissed him!

31
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:02,291
Something that I never had the
guts to do with Kazuki myself!

32
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:03,166
[BOTH gasp]

33
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,583
But he's--

[laughing]

35
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,958
[YUZUKI]
Hey, what's so funny, Hanayo?

36
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:11,125
[HANAYO (Y)]
You haven't changed,

37
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:13,083
even after being an LRIG.

38
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:14,833
Still straightforward
and gullible.

39
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:16,333
Hey, watch it!

40
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:19,625
And hurt easily while trying
your hardest to look strong.

41
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:21,833
But you know what?

42
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:25,416
You and Kazuki
are so much alike.

43
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,500
I need you to understand
that when I started this,

44
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:30,250
all I wanted was
to grant your wish.

45
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,375
One that wasn't easy to bear.

46

[HANAYO (Y)]
When we were together,

50
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,250
that's all I thought about.

51
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:48,583
At least at first.

52
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,291
But soon...

53
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:53,291
I realized that I
was in love with him too.

54
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:54,541
Oh no...

55
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:56,958
[HANAYO (Y)] That's why
I can't do this anymore.

56
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:59,750
Don't get me wrong,
I love Kazuki.

57
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,500
But I like you a lot as well!

58
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,916
I know in my heart that if
finding happiness with Kazuki

59
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,916
becomes my wish and not yours,

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,708
then that would be a total
betrayal to you, Yuzuki!

61
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:09,750
Hanayo...

62
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,416
[HANAYO (Y)]
And I don't want that!

63
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,166
I can't betray you
or deceive him!

64
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,291
Kazuki doesn't know the truth
and he believes that I'm you!

[KAZUKI]
What was that about?

Yuzuki... What was all
that stuff you were saying?

Kazuki, hold on!

Kazuki, look,
you're not a Selector,

76
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:46,833
so you can't
hear Yuzuki's voice!

00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:57,250
Continue to fulfill my wish!

00:05:57,333 --> 00:06:00,750
I don't care if you think
you're betraying me, just do it!

You have to keep it up
or else you're gonna die!

So... You believe us?

107
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:27,166
I can feel her
presence in this card.

108
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,958
So yes, I do.

109
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,208
If an Eternal Girl
doesn't fulfill her wish,

110
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,208
then she ends up disappearing.

111
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:36,416
That's why we gotta save Hanayo.

112
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,000
I've gotta hurry
and become an LRIG.

113
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:40,750
You only have one win.

114
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,250
You'll have to fight
a lot more Battles.

115
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:43,666
[YUZUKI]
There's not enough time!

116
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,791
[HITOE] Then I'll
start battling again!

117
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,500
As long as it's not
with the same LRIG,

118
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:49,083
I can do it too, right?

119
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:50,291
So now...

120
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:51,500
We just have to split up
and find Selectors--

121
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,041
[YUZUKI]
It'll be too late!

122
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:55,583
Hanayo doesn't have long!

123
00:06:55,666 --> 00:07:00,458
[IONA] Maybe you don't
have to win multiple times.

124
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:01,625
Think back to what happened

125
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:04,250
when you were a
Selector before.

126
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:08,708
You were on the verge of having
your wish granted, but then...

127
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:11,416
Tama didn't accept it,
and as a result of that,

128
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,166
an Eternal Girl wasn't born.

129
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,416
Does that mean...?

130
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,875
If Tama is willing
to accept Ruko's wish now,

131
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:20,500
it can come true
and end this whole mess?

132
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:21,833
Yeah, but...

133
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:23,458
I thought you couldn't
even go to the White Room

134
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:26,000
unless you became an LRIG first.

135
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:29,166
[IONA] Yes, but the Battlefield
is linked to the White Room.

136
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,000
What?

137
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,208
Tama will be nearby,

138
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:33,416
so I'll call out to
her during the Battle.

139
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,958
And if my voice is
indeed able to reach her...

140
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:39,291
Then that means
my wish can be granted!

141
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:51,666
Yuzuki...

142

[YUZUKI]
Um, Hitoe?

143
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,875
Can you ask Kazuki
something for me, please?

144
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,458
Huh?

145
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,791
I know this is kind of weird,
but it's eating me up inside.

146
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:03,750
I need to know if he loves me
or Hanayo in my form better.

147
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:04,750
Okay.

148
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,541
[YUZUKI]
Uh, no, wait, never mind!

149
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,166
I'll ask him.

00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,583
When I'm released
from this dumb card!

151

Right, Ruko?

152

Don't try to lose on purpose!

going to make Ruko shine,

I gotcha! Yuzuki?

162
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:00,875
I heard her.
And I'm not gonna go easy!

163
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,791
Fiery Ambition!

164
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,750
Yuki!

165
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,666
[TAMA]
Yuki?

166
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,000
That voice, it's--

167
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,458
[RUKO]
Tama?

168
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:17,375
Who is this... Yuki?

169
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,250
Tama.

170
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,541
[IONA]
It's me. Kuro.

171
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:26,916
No, wait. I'm not her anymore.

172
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,416
I'm Yuki now.

173
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,208
See, just like you,
Ruko gave me a brand new name.

174
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:33,333
Yuki!

175
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,541
[IONA] Tama.
We were both born from Mayu.

176
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:47,791
[TAMA]
Uh-huh.

177
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:51,416
[IONA] But the person
who gave us our names,

178
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,125
the one who taught us about
the outside world, was Ru!

179
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:57,083
Right.

180
00:09:57,166 --> 00:10:00,000
[IONA] Well, we should
show her our gratitude, then,

181
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,625
by granting Ru's wish together!

182
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:03,750
Yuki!

183
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,708
What do you say?

184
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:10,041
Let's help the one
who's done so much for us!

185
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:11,333
Yuzuki!

186
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:12,500
Ready?

187
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,083
[TAMA]
I'm ready!

188
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:22,833
Let's do it. "I accept."

189
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:28,166
[IONA]
Ruko!

190
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,833
"I accept the
laws of the Selector."

191
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:43,041
"And upon this sacred oath..."

192
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:50,500
[RUKO, TAMA] "...a new
Eternal Girl shall be born!"

193
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,916
[YUZUKI screaming]

194
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,291
Yuzuki!

195
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,875
[HITOE]
What?

196
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,708
[YUZUKI]
The room...

197
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:29,583
[KAZUKI] Hitoe!
Did Yuzuki come back, too?

198
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:30,875
[HITOE]
Ruko!

199
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:31,875
[YUZUKI]
What the...?

200
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,916
Um, maybe her wish was granted?

201
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,625
I-I think something is wrong.

202
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,416
Yuki's card hasn't changed.

203
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,625
We should be able to tell.
This isn't normal.

204
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:43,000
Guys, listen.

205
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:46,625
I know I'm an outsider here,
but can I say something?

206
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:50,083
Ruko only did that Battle
to get to the White Room

207
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:52,416
so she could meet
this Mayu, right?

208
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,333
[HITOE]
Uh, yeah.

209
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:57,291
Is that the only place
that Mayu could possibly be at?

210
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:58,583
What?

211
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,125
[KAZUKI] You told me
that Mayu created a world

212
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:01,375
of Selector Battles

213
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:04,583
to escape the miserable
one she lives in, right?

214
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:07,916
If so, is there a chance she's
suffering in this real world

215
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,958
as we speak?

216
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:09,833
[gasps]

217
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:11,291
[YUZUKI]
Yeah, you're right!

218
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,625
So then even if we
don't go to the White Room,

219
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:16,500
maybe we can find the
real Mayu here and convince her!

220
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:19,166
If so, then why
didn't Yuki tell us that

221
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,875
in the first place?

222
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:23,916
[YUZUKI]
Hitoe, what's wrong?

223
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,250
[HITOE] That place we
got a small glimpse of

224
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,083
before we exited
the battlefield?

225
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:31,416
[YUZUKI]
Yeah! That's the White Room!

226
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,208
[HITOE]
That's what I thought.

227
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:34,708
But I just remembered...

228
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:37,250
I've seen a place
like it before.

229
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:50,291
You must be her.

230
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:51,791
Mayu.

231
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,791
You're so incredibly stupid.

232
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,291
That Shiro...

233
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,583
She's playing hide-and-seek now.

234
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,000
It doesn't matter.

235
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:02,666
Even if both of your
feelings are in sync.

236
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:06,166
Without Shiro, your wish
is never going to come true!

237
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,291
[IONA]
Mayu, please listen.

238
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:09,250
We just came here to talk.

239
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,375
What did you just say to me?

240
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,416
Um... She said,
"We just came here--"

241
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,625
[MAYU]
"We" came here to talk to Kuro?

242
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,208
"We?"

243
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,416
You're supposed to
be all alone, you know.

244
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,875
The word "we" isn't one
that suits you at all, Kuro.

245
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:28,125
Yeah, well, her name's
not Kuro anymore!

246
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:29,583
It's Yuki now!

247
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:30,833
"Yuki"?

248
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:33,625
[laughing]
Pathetic!

249
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:36,083
I know it means "snow,"
but seasons don't mean anything

250
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,875
when you're
trapped inside a card!

251
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,416
And get over yourself!

252
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,666
She's just an LRIG.

253
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,041
You don't need to
bother with her feelings!

254
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:46,125
But Yuki's feelings
are your feelings, too.

255
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:47,916
[RUKO]
And so are Tama's.

256
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,541
Because both of them
were born from you.

257
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,333
They're both part of you.

258
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:55,291
They're the two sides of Mayu.

259
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:58,708
One side loved the snow,
because it covered up the sounds

260
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:01,625
you didn't want to hear
with a dark silence,

261
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,791
like a security blanket.

262
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:06,750
But your other side
longed for something else.

263
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:09,625
The pleasant summer sun
that was bright

264
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:13,666
and gave warmth to
everything its rays touched!

265
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:17,666
Yuzuki told us what it's like,
being trapped inside a card.

266
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,250
She said it's lonely.

267
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:22,708
You can see and hear the outside
world, but you can't take part!

268
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,916
How sad.
And being alone like that

269
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,833
is just what you've been
dealing with, too, isn't it?

270
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,875
You hate being the only
one locked away in this room,

271
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:34,458
so you want everyone else
to feel as lonely as you!

272
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,583
You think I'm lonely, do you?

273
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:39,875
You think you know
so much about my life?

274
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:41,416
We're trying to help you!

275
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,625
[URITH]
Don't worry, Mayu isn't alone.

276
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:47,791
Been awhile since you've
seen me in this form, huh?

277
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,041
[IONA]
Urith!

278
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:51,916
Become an LRIG
to a strong Selector.

279
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,375
That was your wish,
wasn't it, scum?

280
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:55,833
Me, on the other hand,

281
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:58,416
I wanted to be an
LRIG to a Selector, as well.

282
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,916
One who could bring
pain and despair to everyone.

283
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,125
My wish came true and
it led me right to her.

284
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,250
I couldn't ask for
a better partner than Mayu.

285
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:10,166
She's brought so much
suffering to countless girls.

286
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,500
I've finally found
my true Selector at last!

287
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,583
Well, what are we
waiting for? Let's battle!

288
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,916
I've been wanting to smack that
ignorant little face of yours

289
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,333
for a long time!

290
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:22,916
You're not scared, are you?

291
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,708
Mayu! We didn't come here
to fight with anyone!

292
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,458
We only came here to talk!

293
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:29,000
So please listen!

294
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,750
These Battles don't have to
be painful and heartbreaking!

295
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:34,166
It's a game.
It's supposed to be fun!

296
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,541
[MAYU]
Fun, huh?

297
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:38,416
For you, but I'm afraid
I don't share your opinion.

298
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,708
You mean like the Battle
you had in the library courtyard

299
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,916
with no wishes at stake, right?

300
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,125
A Battle so boring that it
actually made me yawn.

301
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,083
I know all about that.

302
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,916
All right.

303
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,166
Then, for laughs,
I'll give it a try myself.

304
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,166
[RUKO gasps]

305
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,541
Now, let's begin.

306
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,291
You spoke of having
fun in your Battles.

307
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:14,625
So show me, Ruko.

308
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,000
Damn it!

309
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,750
This won't change anything!

310
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,500
All I wanted was to talk.

311
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:22,208
If we just battle, there's
no way I'll convince her.

312
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:24,500
On the contrary,
that might be the only way.

313
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,000
What?

314
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,583
Mayu used to play
WIXOSS all the time,

315
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:31,916
but she never battled
someone else before.

316
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,375
Being alone, she only faced
the imaginary opponents

317
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,083
that she created.

318
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:37,708
Ru.

319
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:40,625
I was able to change due to
the Battles I saw you fight.

320
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:41,958
That's right.

321
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:43,833
See, the way that you battle...

322
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:46,666
It's so brilliant,
it transforms people.

323
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,500
It moves their hearts.

324
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:51,666
What are you two
babbling about over there?

325
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,083
I'm going first since
you're taking so long.

326
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:56,000
Urith. Now Grow!

327
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,250
[RUKO]
She's strong. But...

328
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:14,833
Yuki. Looks like
what you said is true.

329
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:17,625
If we don't move how she
predicts, she gets agitated.

330
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,833
And starts to lose control.

331
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,750
[RUKO]
End turn!

332
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,375
Huh? Wait, why?

333
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:26,000
Mayu, hurry up with
the next order, would ya?!

334
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,208
[MAYU]
What? I don't get it.

335
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:30,541
I thought she would have
launched another attack.

336
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,333
If she had, I would
have gained enough Ener

337
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:35,166
to unleash Arts on this current
turn, but since she didn't,

338
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,958
I don't know what kind of
strategy she's planning anymore.

339
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:38,458
It's wrong.

340
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:40,625
Mayu!

341
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:43,958
[MAYU]
Even so... I won't lose.

342
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:46,708
Because of the rules I created.

343
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:49,833
Summon Brionac
and attack Ahriman!

344
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:57,291
[URITH] That didn't
do a damn thing, amateurs.

345
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:58,708
[MAYU]
Kuro?

346
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:01,250
Did you happen to forget
the rules of Selector Battles?

347
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:02,750
[IONA]
What?

348
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,833
Just look at yourself.

349
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:10,375
[MAYU]
There was someone else

350
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:11,416
you should have
been worried about

351
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,208
other than Hanayo.

352
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:16,708
With the real Iona Urazoe
returning back to her old body,

353
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:17,791
"Yuki,"

354
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:19,250
you failed at
being an Eternal Girl

355
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:22,000
according to the
rules of the game.

356
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,583
[RUKO]
Please, no!

357
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,000
[IONA]
It's fine.

358
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,458
Sooner or later,
I knew this was going to happen.

359
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:28,750
What?!

360
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:30,083
[IONA]
Don't worry about me.

361
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:32,708
I never really
existed, after all.

362
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:34,250
I'm not a real person.

363
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:37,708
Just a character Mayu made up.

364
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:41,958
Just like my namesake,
I'll disappear, like snow.

365
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:43,625
Yuki! You can't!

366
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,791
No please, I won't let you!

367
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,083
[TAMA]
Ru...

368
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:49,875
Tama?

369
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:52,791
[TAMA]
I can't get out of this place.

370
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:53,958
Sorry.

371
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:56,333
Can you please bring
Yuki to where I am?

372
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:57,833
Please, Ru.

373
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:00,125
I can try.

374
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:01,583
Hey, what's the hold-up?

375
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:04,041
C'mon, keep this Battle going!

376
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,583
Ruko? Wait, what are you doing?

377
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:09,750
Get back here!

378
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:12,000
You can't quit in
the middle of a Battle!

379
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,375
[HITOE]
Over here!

380
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:23,250
The library?

381
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,333
This courtyard seems familiar.

382
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:37,250
[HITOE]
It's right up ahead!

383
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,583
[YUZUKI] Whoa,
there's a mansion back here?

384
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:40,875
Behind the Library.

385
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:42,083
They're both on
the same property

386
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:44,000
and used to be
part of the house.

387
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:47,458
I heard it got remodeled
and the library was moved.

388
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:50,916
I think I've seen
this house before.

389
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,500
Mm-hmm.

390
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:55,541
It does feel awfully
similar, doesn't it?

391
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,583
[YUZUKI]
Do you think Mayu's in there?

392
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:59,083
I dunno. But still...

393
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:05,291
Let's go find out!

394
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,208
[RUKO]
Yuki! Stay with me!

395
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:15,041
I'm taking you to where
Tama is, so just hang on, okay?

396
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:16,458
What gives?

397
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:19,333
That yard was exactly
like how it was at the library,

398
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:23,291
but then, everything else
here is all wrong!

399
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:25,208
[IONA]
I think I understand now.

400
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:26,416
[RUKO]
Huh?

401
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,083
[IONA] It's why Mayu
kept Tama sealed away,

402
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:31,958
and wouldn't let her participate
in Selector Battles for so long.

403
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,833
I never understood what changed.

404
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,333
What made her awaken.

405
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:39,625
But now I--
I think I understand why.

406
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,041
You do?

407
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:50,208
It's because--

408
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:54,291
[KAZUKI]
I don't think anyone lives here.

409
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:55,708
[CUSTODIAN 11A]
What are you kids doing?

410
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:57,583
This is private property.

411
00:20:57,666 --> 00:21:00,041
[KAZUKI] Um...
We're not trespassing, sir.

412
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,291
We're friends with
the girl who lives here.

413
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:05,458
[CUSTODIAN 11A]
Hm? The girl who lives here?

414
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:10,541
[IONA] Mayu. She probably
died some time ago.

415
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:15,041
[MAYU]
That's right, Kuro.

416
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:18,250
As you guessed,
I'm no longer among the living.

417
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:20,083
[RUKO]
You're really dead?

418
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:21,583
[MAYU]
Now, Kuro.

419
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:25,500
Since you're a part of me,
you won't let me die all alone.

420
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:29,416
Shouldn't you disappear with
the one who granted you life?

421
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:34,083
Urith. Now Grow, Level 5.

422
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:45,458
[screaming]

423
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:49,708
[RUKO]
Oh no... Yuki!

424
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:53,208
Yuki! Wake up! Say something!

425
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:56,125
Yuki! No!

426
00:21:56,208 --> 00:22:06,208
No!

427
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:16,208
No!

428
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:26,208
No!

429
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:36,208
No!

430
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:46,250
No!

431
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:56,250
No!

432
00:22:56,333 --> 00:23:06,250
No!

433
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:16,250
No!

434
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:26,291
No!

435
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:36,291
No!

436
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:44,875
No!

437
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:46,916
[RUKO]
Next time: "This Selection."
