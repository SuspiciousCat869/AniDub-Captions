1
00:00:09,166 --> 00:00:12,583
[KAZUKI] What?! You were
playing WIXOSS until four AM?

2
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:15,083
[RUKO] Yeah, I showed it to
my Grandma, and she got hooked.

3
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:17,958
The deal was, loser had to
peel tangerines, and I lost.

4
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:19,708
Now my hands are
all orange. Look!

5
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:20,875
[YUZUKI] Ewww!

6
00:00:20,958 --> 00:00:22,583
--[RUKO yawns]
--[YUZUKI] Yeesh.

7
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:24,166
There's this stuff
called "soap"?

8
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,750
Yeah, thanks.

9
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:28,416
So you were saying we don't need
to battle each other anymore?

10
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:33,375
Yeah. The world can make
room for one more Eternal Girl.

11
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:35,583
Both of us can have
our wishes come true!

12
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:40,708
But... I don't have one.
I haven't even thought about it.

13
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:43,875
C'mon!

14
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:45,958
--[KAZUKI] Let's go!
--Hey, wait up, you guys!

15
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:20,708
Finding other Selectors
is a real pain in the butt,

16
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:22,291
not to mention exhausting.

17
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,166
You mean there
aren't too many?

18
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,291
No. Or at least it
seems like that,

19
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:27,958
since there's no
easy way to find 'em.

20
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:29,791
Right? Tell 'er, Hanayo.

21
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:33,583
Yes. But LRIGs are
attracted to each other.

22
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:36,125
We can identify
Selectors on sight.

23
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:38,333
Right over there for example.

24
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:39,791
Huh?

25
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:44,958
[YUZUKI] Iona Urazoe.

26
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:47,250
What about her?
Is she a Selector?

27
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:50,708
She's on TV a lot. Even
had a new single jus' drop.

28
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:52,916
[HANAYO] The girl next
to her is one, too.

29
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,333
[YUZUKI] Really? She's in
magazines a lot too, it's...

30
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:59,291
Oh, come on. It's
on the tip of my tongue.

31
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:00,166
[GIRL A] Akira!

32
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:00,958
That's her!

33
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:01,416
Uh...

34
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,666
Ah?

35
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,375
Hey, look it says here
she goes to Gochu High!

36
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:06,875
[YUZUKI gasps]

37
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:09,708
Wait! Which high
school? Say it again?

38
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,958
Uh... What...?

39
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,875
[students murmuring]

40
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:16,541
--Uh...
--Huh?

41
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,916
[RUKO] Maybe this
isn't the best time.

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,833
[YUZUKI] C'mon, better
now than never!

43
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:22,500
But I get first
dibs, okay?

44
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,875
I'll set up matches for
after-school and--

45
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:26,375
Aah!

46
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:28,416
It's her! Akira!

47
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,208
[RUKO] Wow!

48
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:33,291
Just like the pictures...
She's so pretty.

49
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:35,458
Now's our chance!
Let's go challenge her!

50
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:41,541
[GIRL] Wait! Akira, please!
I'm begging you!

51
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:43,166
You have to battle me!

52
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,333
[ALL] Huh?!

53
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:45,500
That girl is...

54
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:46,333
...a Selector?!

[GIRL gasps]

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,041
You're... Selectors too?

57
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:51,500
Who are these
losers?

58
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,666
Akira's too busy to sign
autographs right now.

59
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,541
So buzz off!

60
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:57,583
Uhh! No. Wait. I just want--

61
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,625
[AKIRA laughs]

62
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:00,458
[gasps]

63
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:01,875
Thanks for being my fan!

[AKIRA] If you want
something autographed,

66
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:06,250
then let's go someplace
private! You guys, too!

67
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,333
Wha--? Us?

68
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:09,791
[YUZUKI] C'mon, Ruko!

69
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:15,416
Akira's too
nice to her fans.

70
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,083
[AKIRA] Here! Perfect!

71
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,208
[AKIRA] All right!

72
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,375
With all these
Selectors, I'm so lucky!

73
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,791
Or as I like to
say: "Aki-lucky"!

74
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,208
Um... I don't--

75
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:33,250
So let's get a battle done
before class starts, okay?

76
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,333
Which one of you
girls is up first?

77
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:36,500
[GIRL] I-I am.

78
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:38,666
[AKIRA] All righty then.
What's your name?

79
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,791
Ahh! My name is Hitoe.

80
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:44,041
Love it! Now let's get
this party started, yo!

battle ready to: Open!

Ah...

[HITOE whimpers softly]

87
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,875
[HANAYO] I assume you
both are wondering

88
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,500
what you're doing here.

89
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:26,708
When a battlefield is
opened, any Eternal Girl

90
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:28,833
candidates nearby
are drawn inside.

91
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:30,041
Well that's lame!

--Tama!

Hey! You're gonna get
my hair all goofed up

95
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:36,916
if you keep doing that!

96
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,375
Look, it's starting!

97
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,291
I'm first. Guess
it's now or never!

98
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,166
Let's go: Battle Start!

99
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,791
Are you ready, Midoriko?

100
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:51,083
Yeah. Leave it to me!

101
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,291
My LRIG is
Aki-lucky, too!

102
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:56,916
Meet Piriluk! Go
stompy-stompy on them, okay?

103
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,875
Understood.

104
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,833
[HANAYO] A green deck
versus a blue deck, huh?

105
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:04,416
There's a possibility
this Hitoe girl may have

106
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,875
the upper hand.

107
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:10,541
Draw! Energy charge,
Midoriko! Now Grow!

108
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:13,541
First up: Summon Sparrow!

109
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:21,166
Sparrow! Attack!

110
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,333
[MIDORIKO grunts]

starting off strong!

[PIRILUK grunts]

113
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:29,875
It worked?

114
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,750
All I have to do is
keep Midoriko growing

115
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,166
so we don't
lose momentum!

116
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,000
Ooh, what a meanie!
Whatever shall we do?

117
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,583
You got this, Piriluk, just
Grow and we'll take her out.

118
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,333
[AKIRA] But those green
decks really are unnerving!

119
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:44,666
There's no telling what
cards Little Miss Four-Eyes

120
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,125
has in her hand!

121
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:49,125
To make things less scary...

122
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:52,291
I think I'll just have her
throw one of those cards away.

123
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,541
[HITOE gasps]

124
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:57,625
[AKIRA] All right, Hitoe, I'm
gonna choose one of your cards

125
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:01,458
at random. Hope it's one you
can afford to play without!

126
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,750
Spell: Too Bad!

00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:06,791
'Kay, not looking. Oh yeah!

128
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,833
I'm bettin' that's a
Level 3 card, isn't it?

129
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:09,750
Expose.

130
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:10,750
[HITOE gasps]

131
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:14,166
[AKIRA] Bullseye!
Aki-lucky guess!

132
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,666
The card just vanished!

133
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,333
It's one of the blue
deck's top strategies.

134
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:22,041
A player can force their
opponent to lose a card.

135
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,291
That sucks.

136
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:25,583
[AKIRA] Piriluk, Grow!
And while you're at it,

137
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:29,416
freeze Hitoe's Sparrow!
Clip its wings!

[AKIRA] Aww, your cute little
birdy's been put on ice

140
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:35,958
'til the next turn!

141
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:38,875
No. Midoriko...
What should I do?

142
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,833
I only have two cards
left! If I mess up...

143
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,000
[HITOE sobs]

144
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:44,416
Just calm
down, Hitoe!

145
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,250
If that's already
gotcha freakin' out,

146
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,666
wait 'til you see the other
stuff I've got in store!

147
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,208
Go, Piriluk.

[HITOE screams]

150
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:58,416
[AKIRA] Seen this
one? Super handy.

151
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,125
I pick a level,
then you throw away

152
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:01,458
all your cards that match it.

153
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,208
All... my cards...?

154
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:05,000
I wonder what
I should pick?

155
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:08,041
Let's see... Level... two?

156
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,458
[HITOE whimpers]

157
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:12,416
This is bad!
She can read her!

158
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,958
[AKIRA] Three?

159
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:14,541
Four...?

160
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,833
[HITOE gasps]

00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,375
Yeah, that's the one.

162
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:21,416
All Level Four cards:
Go buh-bye!

163
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,166
[HITOE screams]

164
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,250
[HITOE gasps]

165
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,708
[BOTH gasp]

166
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,375
[HITOE sobs]

167
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:29,583
[AKIRA laughs]

168
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,416
[AKIRA] Jeez,
pull it together!

169
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,708
[AKIRA sighs]

170
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:34,166
[AKIRA] Not that you
have any hope of winning,

171
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,500
but now you got me
wondering why

172
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,208
you want to become
an Eternal Girl.

173
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:39,708
Let's find out your
little wish, shall we?

174
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,166
Ah...

175
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:48,125
[PIRILUK] The poor thing.

176
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,833
[PIRILUK] She has no friends.

177
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:53,541
[HITOE gasps]

178
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,041
[AKIRA cackles]

179
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,250
Aw, nobody wuvs Hitoe!

180
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,666
--[MIDORIKO] Hitoe! Come on!
--She doesn't have any fwiends!

181
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,291
We're still in this, so ignore
her and don't give up!

182
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,708
--[HITOE sobs quietly]
--[AKIRA] Loser!

183
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:05,708
Screw this!

184
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,916
Yuzuki, what--?!

185
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,041
I'm gonna put a stop
to her right now!

186
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,250
I know! I'll interfere
just like Kazuki did

187
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:12,958
when you and I
had our battle!

188
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,541
That should do the trick!

189
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:15,375
[HANAYO] It won't.

190
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:16,708
Why not?

191
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:19,083
Kazuki didn't stop the
battle the last time,

192
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,083
it was the teacher.

193
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,666
And that was only because
of an irregular occurrence.

194
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:27,458
An interruption by someone who
knew nothing about the cards.

195
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:32,500
Also... if ever a battle
is stopped on purpose,

196
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:33,833
a huge penalty
is issued.

197
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,166
A penalty?

198
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,375
What about one for the way
Akira's been playing?

199
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,708
She hasn't broken
any rules thus far.

200
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:41,208
Yeah, but--!

201
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:44,541
Dang. This game...
it's horrible...

202
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,125
[RUKO] How could she...?

203
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:51,625
[TAMA yells]

204
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:52,500
[RUKO gasps]

205
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:55,125
[TAMA meowing]

206
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:56,375
Tama.

207
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:59,083
Yeah, Piriluk?
Finish this.

208
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:01,625
Hitoe!

209
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:04,500
I... don't have any
Life Cloth left.

210
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:05,958
You can't give
up now!

211
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:08,166
Take guard against
the attack!

212
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,875
Why? I'm just gonna lose
anyway. What's the use?

213
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:14,666
[MIDORIKO] Believe
in me! Please!

214
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,250
Hitoe...

215
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,875
[MIDORIKO gasps]

216
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:26,958
[MIDORIKO screams]

217
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,416
[HITOE gasps]

218
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:37,958
[HITOE whimpers]

219
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,833
Midoriko!

220
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:50,541
[HANAYO] The game's over.
Akira won.

221
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,000
[RUKO gasps]

222
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,250
Hmph.

223
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,416
[HITOE] I'm sorry.

224
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,958
I tried, but... I can't.

225
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:22,083
Midoriko begged me to
fight, but I gave up.

226
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,416
And now she's the
one paying for it.

227
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,833
It's all my fault!

228
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,625
Um... You okay?

229
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:30,250
[HITOE sobs]

230
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:31,916
[RUKO] Hitoe!

231
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,875
So. Who wants
to battle next?

232
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:41,208
Oh! Already, Piriluk?

233
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:44,083
Crud. She falls
asleep so quickly.

234
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,583
Well, then. We'll just
have to battle tomorrow!

235
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,791
Okay? Can I get
your cell number?

236
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,791
Well, you see... I
don't have a cell phone...

237
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,875
No way, that is
so old school!

238
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:55,375
What's yours?

239
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:56,375
I, um...

240
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:57,833
Yuzuki.

241
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,541
Gotta go! We're super
late for class!

242
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,208
[KAZUKI &amp; YUZUKI gasp]

243
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:10,958
[AKIRA] I am not letting you go
until you give up the digits.

244
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:12,333
Right now.

245
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:13,916
[YUZUKI gasps]

246
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:23,125
[school bells chiming]

247
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:24,000
[YUZUKI] Ruko!

248
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,041
Ah.

249
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:27,041
D'ja get in trouble
for being tardy?

250
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:29,875
[RUKO] Yeah. But I just had
to stand out in the hall.

251
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,375
It was math class so
I was lucky, or, sorry,

252
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,500
I mean, "Aki-lucky"!

253
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,291
[YUZUKI] Oh God, make me cringe.

254
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:38,083
Damn. Akira's a monster.

255
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:40,291
She'd probably thrash me as
hard as that other girl.

256
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,333
Well, why did you give her
your phone number then?

257
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:44,458
What choice did I have?!
She wasn't gonna let us go!

258
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:47,458
Oh. Hey, I could battle
Akira if you want me to.

259
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:48,916
[HANAYO] Don't worry.

260
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:53,041
As long as you don't agree
to a battle, you'll be fine.

261
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,166
[YUZUKI] Yeah, good point.

262
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,333
I was watching from the
outside. And you're right.

263
00:12:58,416 --> 00:12:59,750
She's strong.

264
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:02,041
[YUZUKI] Yeah, but that Hitoe
girl wasn't bad either.

265
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:04,166
I didn't know all the
Eternal Girl candidates

266
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,833
would be this tough.

267
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:08,500
I wonder... if I
can win at all.

268
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:13,625
Sure you can! I mean, all you
need to do is update your deck.

269
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:16,333
But that means we'd have
to go to the card shop.

270
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:20,125
Umm... Yeah, unless
that's a problem?

271
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,291
Uh. No.

272
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:25,458
Ooh, I've never been
to one before! Can I go?

273
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,333
Sure, we'll all
go together.

274
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:28,833
[RUKO] Cool!

275
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:36,041
[RUKO] Whoa. I never knew
there was a card shop

276
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:38,208
in this neighborhood.

277
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:40,916
So, Kazuki, you're really
an expert on all this stuff,

278
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,250
aren't you?

279
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,583
Yeah. I was playing WIXOSS
before it got popular

280
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,083
with everyone else.

281
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:49,750
When I recommended it to Yuzuki,
her deck had Hanayo in it.

282
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,208
Right, Yuzuki?

283
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:52,250
[YUZUKI gasps]

284
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,416
[YUZUKI] Uh... Right!

285
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,500
Well, we're here.

286
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,125
It's so big!

287
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:09,291
[RUKO] Wow. This place takes
cards pretty seriously.

288
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:11,958
Huuuh...

289
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,000
[SHOP KEEP] Hey! Kazuki!

290
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:23,291
We just got a new
WIXOSS set in today!

291
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:26,083
And Yuzuki tagged
along too! Been awhile.

292
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,333
Yeah... Guess so.

293
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,666
We're hoping to update
Yuzuki's deck today.

294
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,333
Would you mind giving
us some advice?

295
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:36,208
'Course not! You know I'd do
anything for you, Kazuki!

296
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,875
Just tell me what you
need and I'm all yours!

297
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,833
[YUZUKI groans softly]

298
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:45,250
[SHOP KEEP] Let's see, Yuzuki's
deck is Red Ambition, so...

299
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:49,125
In my opinion, it should cycle a
lot better with an Adamasphere.

300
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:50,916
Oh, yeah, I think I've
heard of that one.

301
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,166
It's a SIGNI from the
new series, right?

302
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,750
[SHOP KEEP] Yep.

303
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,125
But there's aren't any singles
on the collector's market yet.

304
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:58,583
[KAZUKI grunts]

305
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:05,000
[KAZUKI sighs]

306
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:07,125
All these packs
and nothin'.

307
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,708
What about these cards?

308
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:11,875
Nah. They won't really mesh well
with the rest of Yuzuki's deck.

309
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,666
[RUKO gasps]

310
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,250
Well, if you don't want
this one, do you think

311
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,583
I could have it then?

312
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:18,916
Huh?

313
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,750
[RUKO] Well, tell me
if I'm doing this wrong,

314
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,916
but it looks like if I use
this little buddy in my deck,

315
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,791
I can search
non-colored SIGNIs.

316
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:28,541
Oh yeah! You sure can!
I'm surprised you know that!

317
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,291
For a newbie, you're good!

318

have to wait for someone

to sell a single.

321
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:43,833
For now, you'll just have to get
better with the deck you have.

322
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:46,208
All right, it's your turn.

323
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,791
I'll draw this
one and charge...

Y'know, you'd probably do better
if you strategize your growing.

[KAZUKI] You have to.

too straightforward.

means I'm honest, doesn't it?
