00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:09,625
[MAYU]
Do you know the Girl of White?

2
00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:11,208
So pure and innocent,

3
00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:14,416
with a heart as warm
as the morning sun.

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,750
But there is a Girl
of Black as well.

5
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:21,291
Cruel and wicked, with a heart
as cold as the darkest night.

6
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:26,041
She burns with jealousy.

7
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:28,708
Resenting every shining
smile that dances upon

8
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:30,416
the cheeks of the Girl of White.

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,916
And eventually, that bitter
hatred turns to thoughts

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,583
of erasing her very existence.

11

Huh...?

The girls I just spoke of...

15
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:55,208
They may be separate, but they
came from the same person.

16

Are you ready to go?

17
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,250
To the world of black and white?

All right, good work you two!

You're free to go.
See you next time!

22

Come meet me in my

Not that name.

Not with people around.

I, uh...

Yeah, I'm sorry...

Remember.

29
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,625
This is our little secret.

30
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:25,291
I'll be waiting.

00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:26,750
Okay!

Oh, Iona.

You don't know
what you're in for.

34
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:39,083
[RUKO] You're saying Iona
is the Girl of Black?

35
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:41,833
Is that true?

36
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:43,458
You can tell me.

37
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:46,916
[IONA]
What's... happening to me?

38
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,750
So do you know...
where Fumio ended up?

39
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,375
[FUMIO] That was the last
I ever saw of her.

40
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:53,625
[HITOE]
I hope she's okay...

41
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:56,291
[YUZUKI sighs]
This is getting confusing.

42
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:59,458
So there's a Girl of Black
and maybe she's an LRIG?

43
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:01,166
What does that mean
for the game?

44
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,583
Anything?

45
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,583
And is the Girl of White
out there, too?

Oh, nothing.

00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:13,125
Mayu didn't tell me
anything else.

50
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,625
I'm afraid I'm
as confused as you.

[CHIYORI]
I'm awesome!

57
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:26,583
[ELDORA] She has these
little conniption fits

58
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:27,625
from time to time.

59
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:30,250
Just ignore her and carry on.

60
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,333
So the WIXOSS novel
you wrote is, like,

61
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:35,208
the symbol of eternal friendship
between you and Fumio?!

62
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:36,750
Oh my gosh! I love it!

63
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:38,166
That's so cool!

64
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,625
Friendship?

65
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:42,291
But it was just
an online thing

66
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:43,583
when you first
started, wasn't it?

67
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,375
[FUMIO]
Yes.

68
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:47,958
I didn't know much
about being a novelist.

69
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:50,375
But when I did some research,
I read that a lot of people

70
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,208
test the waters that way.

71
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:07,750
[FUMIO gasps]

72
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:08,958
[FUMIO] To be honest,
I didn't expect things

73
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,583
to turn out so well.

74
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,875
A touching friendship,
a happy ending!

75
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,833
It's all so cool,
I could explode!

76
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,750
[ELDORA] What "happy ending"?!
This whole thing is a disaster!

77
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:22,208
[HITOE] I wonder what the
original Fumio is doing now.

78
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:24,333
[ANN] There's no way
for us to find her.

79
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:27,208
It's bad enough to have
to go through all this once.

80
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,625
But then getting out
of that card

81
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:30,500
only to become a Selector again.

82
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:31,541
That's awful.

83
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,250
[YUZUKI]
But wait. I don't get it.

84
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,416
You wrote some books.

85
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,958
Wish granted. You're done.

86
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,291
Why would you still be
fighting as a Selector?

87
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:41,416
It's not like it's
your wish, right?

88
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,250
That's a bit ironic
coming from you, I'd say.

89
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,166
Like how?

90
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,458
[FUMIO]
If you're a LRIG now,

91
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:48,500
that means you were
a Selector yourself once.

92
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:51,291
You must have had a dream that
meant more to you than anything.

93
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:53,541
I'm sure you believed
the words of your LRIG

94
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,333
and counted on her
to grant that wish,

95
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:57,250
no matter what kind
of miracle it took.

96
00:05:57,333 --> 00:06:01,708
[YUZUKI] Hanayo wasn't trying
to deceive me on purpose.

97
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:04,291
She was always
looking out for me.

98
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:05,750
Even now.

99
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,541
That hasn't changed.

100
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:12,166
[FUMIO] Would it be enough
if your wish only came true

101
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,958
for a short while?
After all you've been through?

102
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,291
Well, I mean--

103
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,041
[FUMIO] I imagine it's precisely
the sort of thing

104
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:21,291
that would be meaningless
if it didn't last forever.

105
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:24,291
[YUZUKI sighs]
No... you're right.

106
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:25,833
I wasn't thinking.

107
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,166
[FUMIO]
How about you?

108
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,375
[CHIYORI gasps]

109
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:31,750
[ELDORA sighs]

110
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,041
Now you know.

111
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,291
That's how Fumio felt, too.

112
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:38,125
Being a novelist didn't
mean writing one book.

113
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:41,208
It meant writing them
for her entire life.

114
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:43,541
Writing only two novels
doesn't give me the right

115
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:46,458
to call myself a novelist.

116
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:49,125
I'm merely an ephemeral
shell of an existence

117
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,541
that will fade once
the writing stops

118
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,125
There's no end.

119
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:56,625
The wishes that we grant
are not mere fleeting fancies.

120
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,833
They must continue until death.

121
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:00,750
A miracle forged in tears.

122
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,083
There's no end.

123
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,916
No escape from this.

124
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,291
Unlike Fumio, I was neither well
read nor particularly creative.

125
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:11,875
That's why my choice of
subject matter is what it is.

126
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,500
Thankfully, my personal story

127
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:15,791
proved interesting
enough to sell books.

128
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,208
Or it has thus far.

129
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:20,750
[ANN] But the well of
knowledge has since gone dry.

130
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,083
[ELDORA]
You reached the end.

131
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,916
That's why you've got
writer's block, now, huh?

132
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,541
But it's all gonna work out!

133
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,083
Fueled by the power
of friendship,

134
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:29,541
her stories will live on in your
heart and continue forever!

But I know you can do it!

141

[FUMIO]
I'm not a writer!

142
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,000
I never was!

143
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,541
But I can't stop!

144
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:44,875
[CHIYORI whimpers]

145
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,375
[FUMIO] I don't know if
it's the promise we made,

146
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:49,333
or something built into me,
or just a fear of the abyss

147
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:51,000
that keeps me going.

148
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,458
What am I doing?

149
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:54,125
Why am I doing it?

150
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,958
I don't even know
who the hell I am anymore.

151
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:58,916
[ELDORA]
If you aren't trapped in a card,

152
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,625
you're trapped by a wish.

153
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:03,375
What can you call this
existence, but a curse?

154
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,250
Imprisoned by
the dream of another.

155
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,291
Forced to struggle
for it as an LRIG

156
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:11,041
and forever after,
until you lose yourself.

157
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:13,083
[FUMIO] I'm going to
the White Room again.

158
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,416
I'm going to speak
with Mayu again.

159
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,875
Because if I don't, then the
story can't continue, you see?!

160
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,291
So who's battling me next, you?

161
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:23,458
--You?!
--[CHIYORI gasps]

162
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:25,791
I don't care who,
but let's make it quick.

163
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:28,791
[CHIYORI gasps, whimpers]

164
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,083
[HITOE]
I'm not gonna battle you!

165
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,291
And neither will Chiyori!

166
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:35,583
I see. That's a pity...

167
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,250
But wait...

168
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,208
Thanks to that last battle...

169
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,375
...I can continue
the story after all.

170
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,166
I need to write.

171
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,791
I need to write...

172
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,833
[ANN]
You understand now?

173
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm sure you think you're
acting on some sort of

174
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,208
moral high ground
by refusing to battle,

175
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:53,666
but it's not that simple.

176
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,250
--No, that's not what I'm--
--[ANN] Some people have

177
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,875
no choice but to do this.
And she's one of them.

179

The White Room...

00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,500
The giant window...

182
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,458
I have to write...

183
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,000
I have to go...

00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,500
...to the White Room...

185
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,833
[YUZUKI]
Don't let it upset you too much.

186
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:16,541
Fine...

187
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,000
[YUZUKI sighs]

--[CHIYORI sobs]
--Chiyori?

189
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,000
[YUZUKI] All she ever talks
about are those novels.

190
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,333
That must've been
pretty rough on her.

191
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:33,208
You're the one
I'm worried about.

192
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:36,333
[chuckles]
Yeah, it did kinda shake me up.

193
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:37,625
Poor Hanayo.

194
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:39,666
She's suffering just like me.

195
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,041
I guess there're
no winners here after all.

196
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:44,208
Even if an LRIG
becomes human again,

197
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:46,291
they still can't really be free.

198
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:47,791
Don't lose hope.

199
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:50,208
That's just another reason
for us to put an end to this.

200
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,500
[RUKO]
I'm so dumb.

201
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,000
I thought if everyone
knew the truth,

202
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,833
they wouldn't want
to battle anymore.

203
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:57,125
Like it's that easy.

204
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:57,958
Don't say that.

205
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,000
It's true.

206
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,875
Not everybody is like me.

207
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,958
Some Selectors need to win.

208
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:06,250
[YUZUKI] No. Fumio's
a special case, okay?

209
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,833
[RUKO]
It's not just her. Akira, too.

210
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,125
Even though the game hurt her,

211
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:13,000
she needs it to get
her confidence back.

212
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:15,333
I can't say I'm happy
to be a Selector,

213
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:17,333
but it did let me meet you guys.

214
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,333
[YUZUKI]
Hey, come on! Not you, too!

215
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,166
[RUKO] That doesn't mean
I want to give up.

[YUZUKI, HITOE gasp]

00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,250
We can't judge.

218
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,833
Every Selector deals with their
suffering in a different way.

219
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,708
But no matter who they
are or what they do,

220
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:31,583
I'm not going to stop until I've
saved every one of them!

Ruko...

223
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:40,125
[RUKO] That goes for
Fumio and Futase, too.

224
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:42,291
I'm sure there's some way
to get them back to normal

225
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,083
and I'm gonna find it.

226
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,208
Iona, what you said...

227

[IONA]
You have to find yourself again.

228
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:49,875
I became your LRIG
because I believed in you!

229
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:53,125
Because I knew
you were strong!

230
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:56,458
That meant a lot,
and it helped remind me

231
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:59,458
of what I need to do
to stay on my path.

232
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:00,958

Actually, though.

240
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:28,833
I have another favor to ask.

[gasps] What? I'll do it!

Anything!

243
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:34,583
[URITH (I)] It's something
that only you can accomplish.

Mm-hmm!

[AKIRA]
Sure. I understand.

246

But, it's her. She'll
probably refuse to battle.

00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:55,041
Then you find what she
treasures most in this world.

Ah?

249
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:59,500
[URITH (I)] You're smart,
you can figure it out.

I'm looking forward
to a good show.

I'm home, Grandma!

Uh. Hello again!

Hi! It's nice to have you!

The Girl of Black.

[MAYU]
The Girl of Darkness.

260

What's happening?

00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:39,041
[MAYU] As I said,
you're the Girl of Black.

[IONA]
What does that mean?

263
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:45,375
[MAYU] You envy everyone,
bring everyone suffering.

264
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:48,958
You hate everyone,
and everyone hates you.

265
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,250
[MAYU]
Such a bad girl.

266
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,916
Such a lonely, lonely girl.

00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,958
[IONA] You're lying.
I don't believe you!

00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:01,166
[MAYU] Drowning, dripping,
drenched in hatred.

269
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:05,291
Oh, make them suffer!
Make them feel your pain!

270
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:06,500
[IONA]
No...

271
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,208
No, stop it!

272
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,750
[MAYU]
Battling for all eternity.

273
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:15,166
Spreading misery to everyone.
Such is the fate of

--the Girl of Black.
--[IONA] It's not true!

Stop it...

Wha-What now?
I think she's sick.

277
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:26,708
Do you have any medicine?

278
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,166
Let me see!

279
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,500
[YUZUKI] Wait! How are we
supposed to give it to her?

280
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,500
Oh. Guess you're right.

281
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:33,833
[YUZUKI]
This has never happened to me,

282
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:35,791
so I don't know what to say.

283
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:38,708
[RUKO]
Iona...

284
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:40,208
Can you tell us what's wrong?

285
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,833
Are you cold?
Do you have a fever?

286
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:44,458
Is it a stomach ache, maybe?

287
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,583
[IONA]
Why is she acting like this?

288
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,541
[RUKO] If there's anything
I can do, just tell me!

289
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:49,750
Please!

290
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:52,500
[IONA] Why is she
so worried about me?

291
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,416
I'm right here, okay?

292
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,125
[IONA] Is that why
this hurts so much?

293
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:00,708
I'm cold, that's all.

294
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:05,375
[MAYU]
You should know better.

295
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:08,333
Of course it hurts.

296
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:13,083
You're the Girl of Black.
Your body rejects the light.

297
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:14,916
And it rejects you as well.

298
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,625
Longing for white
will only bring you

299
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,291
more and more suffering.

300
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:22,458
But please, be as
miserable as you like.

301
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,166
She seems to be doing better.

302
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,000
Yeah.

303
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,583
[YUZUKI]
It's tricky...

304
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:35,083
...but this
"Girl of Black" thing

305
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,416
might be the piece of
the puzzle we're looking for.

306
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,750
Right.

307
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:42,083
Then you think Iona's
hiding something from us?

308
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:44,916
[YUZUKI] We'll get some answers
out of her when she wakes up.

309
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,041
Maybe we just need
to be her friend.

310
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:49,375
That might be the only way
to get her to open up.

311
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:50,541
[YUZUKI]
You think?

312
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,083
I don't think she
wants to trick us.

313
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,708
She probably has a reason
for not talking.

314
00:14:54,791 --> 00:15:00,875
It was wrong, but, I mean...
I had things I didn't tell Tama.

315
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:03,583
I was so wrapped up
in my own feelings.

316
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:07,000
I didn't think about what

--Stop it!

476
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:27,291
Can't have these little nerds
getting any big ideas,

477
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:28,833
you know.

478
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:30,916
If you want to
battle me that badly,

479
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,208
then let's get it over with!

480
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,541
Ruko!

481
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,541
But after I win, you're
gonna stop this for good!

482
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:37,958
[AKIRA]
That's cute and all,

483
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:40,708
but I don't think you
understand the situation here.

484
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:44,041
She's here!

485
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:45,500
Finally!

486
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:54,375
The rain kept me.
I hope I'm not too late.

487
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,625
Urith...

488
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:34,875
[URITH (I)]
How unsightly.

489
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:36,791
How disgusting.

490
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:38,833
I'm not interested in you.

491
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:40,500
What a letdown.

492
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:42,458
And besides, where's
the fun in that?

493
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:44,333
It might not be my style.
