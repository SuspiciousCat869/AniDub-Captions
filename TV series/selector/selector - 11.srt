00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:09,708
[NEWS ANNOUNCER (F)] It looks
to be a wet one tomorrow

2
00:00:09,791 --> 00:00:10,916
with scattered showers
throughout the day...

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,875
[HATSU] Suppose I won't
be hanging anything

4
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:13,916
outside to dry tomorrow.

5
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:16,666
[RUKO] Grandma, I'm home!

6
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,250
Oh, hi, want a snack?

7
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:20,708
There's something
I gotta check first!

8
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:22,833
Sure, no hurry.

9
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:25,041
[YUZUKI] Oh, come on!
Why are you so slow?

10
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,583
I'm not used to
Ayumu's laptop!

11
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:29,166
Here we go...

12
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:37,250
[RUKO gasps]

13
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:41,833
[RUKO] Whoa...

14
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,375
Holy crap!

15
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:46,083
Iona really is trying to gather
all the Selectors together!

16
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,875
It's happening
really close to here, too.

17
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:40,500
[YUZUKI] Around here, huh?

18
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:41,958
[RUKO] Yeah.

19
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,166
[YUZUKI] Ruko?

20
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,791
This is...

21
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:00,208
[HATSU] They're only one
building away from a Tetris.

22
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:04,166
And then the whole city
might just disappear on us.

23
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:09,166
[TAMA] Ru?

24
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,625
[RUKO gasps]

25
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,250
[TAMA] Is something wrong?

26
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:15,583
Huh-uh. Not at all.

27
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:18,208
[TAMA groans]

28
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:21,041
Ruko, listen...

29
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:23,041
If something's
bothering you,

30
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:28,000
or if you've got something
on your mind, say it.

31
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,375
Yuzuki...

32
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:32,125
Is it... true?

33
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,000
Am I scary?

34
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:36,500
'Cause people say they
never know what I'm thinking.

35
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:37,833
Huh?

36
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:39,833
No, that wasn't what
I was trying to say before!

37
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:42,166
I meant you try to figure
things out all on your own,

38
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,000
and hold everything inside.

39
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:47,750
Uhhh... You know,
kinda like I do?

40
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:50,041
I'm sorry, okay?

41
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:51,875
Still friends, right?

42
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:53,625
Like back when we bought these?

43
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,333
'Course we are...

44
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,583
You're one of the kindest
people I've ever known.

45
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:02,041
What? Hey!
Come on, knock it off!

46
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:03,625
You're making me blush.

47
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,583
Turns out you're
also one of the strongest.

48
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:08,958
Ru?

49
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:12,583
I wish...
I could be like that...

50
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:19,541
Yuzuki... Tama... I'm sorry.

51
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:24,000
I've decided
to battle Iona.

52
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:25,416
[TAMA gasps]

53
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,583
Wha... What are
you talking about?

54
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,625
I thought you said
you gave up battling!

55
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,833
[RUKO] Yeah... I did.

56
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:33,916
Huh...?

57
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,625
The thing is...

58
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:39,416
Now, I have
a wish to fight for!

59
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,416
It's... a good one.

60
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,541
It's to save you. You and Tama!

61
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:48,000
Plus everyone else
who became LRIGs!

62
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:51,583
I swear! I'll bring
you all back to normal!

63
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,291
I'll get you out
of this crazy game.

64
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,750
I don't care what I
have to sacrifice to do it.

65
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,583
That's my one and only wish!

66
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,041
Oh, Ru...

67
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:06,333
That's sweet, but
it can't be done. Sorry.

68
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:08,250
Wha--? Why not?

69
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:12,375
'Cause like me, every LRIG
used to be a normal girl.

70
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:15,041
And the LRIGs who
replace winning Selectors

71
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,750
become normal girls again.

72
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,291
Even though
they're bound by an oath

73
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:22,833
to fulfill your wish, there's
a limit to what they can do.

74
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,500
So you're telling me
there are some wishes

75
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:29,875
that can never come true?

76
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:32,583
Like going back in time
or reshaping reality?

77
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,458
[MAYU] That's correct.

78
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,583
[YUZUKI gasps]

79
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:36,000
[MAYU] But it's not
my place to decide

80
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,875
which are possible
and which are not.

81
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,333
[YUZUKI] What?

82
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:42,458
[MAYU] Most wishes can come true

83
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,291
thanks to the
efforts of the LRIG.

84
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:47,541
Assuming, of course, that she
upholds her end of the oath.

85
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:50,916
Whether it's due to personal
morality, common sense,

86
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,208
or simply a matter
self-preservation,

87
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:56,291
an LRIG may become reluctant.

88
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,666
But she must cast
these feelings aside,

89
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:02,000
and prioritize the Selector's
wish above her own life.

90
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,541
If an LRIG refuses the wish...

91
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,833
...she will remain
trapped in her card,

92
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:10,000
unable to return
to the outside world.

93
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,500
Therefore, to
guarantee both the wish

94
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,958
and her eventual
escape from her card.

95
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,750
From the moment they meet,
she must do anything

96
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:20,291
and everything to
reach that conclusion.

97
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,250
Even deceiving her Selector.

98
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,458
That's why...

99
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:25,791
[MAYU] Otherwise,
you wouldn't agree

100
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,916
to the ritual of
acknowledgement.

101
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,500
It's a catalyst, you see, a
trigger for the transformation.

102
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,833
[HANAYO] Now... the oath.

103
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,500
Do you remember it?

104
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:39,750
Yeah. It's, uh...
"I accept."

105
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,708
"The laws of the Selector."

106
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:45,083
"I accept the laws of
the Selector." And, um...

107
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:46,416
[BOTH] "And upon
this sacred oath,

108
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,666
a new Eternal Girl
shall be born!"

109
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,416
[MAYU] Once an Eternal Girl,
she is obligated

110
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,541
to fulfill the wish
that has been made.

111
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,375
Though she may
have deceived you,

112
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:00,125
she has entered a contract
that cannot be broken.

113
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,541
For if she fails
to uphold her end.

114
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:05,500
The Eternal Girl
will disappear.

115
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,125
[YUZUKI] Remember
what Hanayo said?

116
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:12,458
[YUZUKI] About how you couldn't
wish Hitoe's memories back?

117
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:14,083
That probably
means you can't just

118
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:16,125
"undo" things with another wish.

119
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:19,375
Yeah, but those girls,
the ones who are LRIGs.

120
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,125
I have no idea
how to get them out,

121
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:24,458
or if it's even possible,
but, this Mayu girl...

122
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:26,541
The one in that
weird white room.

123
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,416
She might. I just
don't know how to

124
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,458
get back to that
place to ask her.

125
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:31,875
Maybe I can get 'em out.

126
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:33,333
[RUKO] Huh?

127
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:37,083
I'm not sure why,
but somewhere deep down,

128
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:38,833
I feel like I might know how.

129
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:42,291
I think I might be able to turn
all the LRIGs back to normal.

130
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:43,916
Wha...?!
You really think so?

131
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,250
Yeah, kinda!

132
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,791
But there's this feeling,
something inside saying

133
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:51,375
"Yes. I can do this thing."
Well, maybe...

134
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:53,041
Tama...

135
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,416
Makes me wonder...

136
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,250
Uh?

137
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,125
[YUZUKI] No, that's crazy...

138
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,250
[YUZUKI] If the Eternal Girls
have so little power,

139
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,375
what's the point
in going through

140
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,041
all this mess
in the first place?

141
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,291
We're stuck in a card,

142
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:08,625
and they die if they
can't fulfill the wish!

143
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,166
If we couldn't make
the wish come true

144
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,791
and they're us now, then
aren't you condemning us all?!

145
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,333
[MAYU] There are exceptions.

146
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:16,666
[YUZUKI gasps]

147
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,000
[MAYU] That is to say,
some Eternal Girls

148
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:22,083
are more... "special"
than others...

149
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,833
You may lack
the power to create

150
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:25,916
this fairy tale
ending you so desire,

151
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,083
but there is magic
yet in this world.

152
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,375
[YUZUKI] You expect
me to buy into

153
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,666
some fantasy
mumbo-jumbo like that?

154
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:35,000
[MAYU] Given what you
have just been through,

155
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:39,250
I'm surprised you would deny
the very concept so flippantly.

156
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,541
And now it seems
the time has come.

157
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:52,083
[MAYU] Morning dawns
on your life as an LRIG.

158
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,000
You now go to
meet your Selector.

159
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,916
No, wait! Tell me who you are!

160

awfully different
from other LRIGs.

Right. But still...

supposed to be close

got close to someone,

Well, except for you

But over the last

important to me, too.

of them that, well...

me the other day

you hoped you could do
something for your friends.

it for your friends instead of

318
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,291
With lots of bacon
the way you like?

319
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:20,625
[RUKO] Oh, please!
Love you, Grandma.

320
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,750
[RUKO] All right. Here goes...

321
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:40,541
[RUKO] Oh, wow. These girls...

322
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:44,333
All of 'em are Selectors here
to fight for their wishes...

323
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:45,791

[SELECTORS gasp]

326
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:55,125
[IONA] Ladies.

327
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,375
Welcome to the fan event.

328
00:16:57,458 --> 00:17:02,166
Rather, welcome to the
Selectors-only WIXOSS party.

329
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,458
This building is
owned by my Father

330
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:06,541
and the work crews
are off today.

331
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:10,625
So we don't have to worry
about being disturbed.

332
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:13,791
We've all been battling
to make our wishes come true.

333
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:16,291
And yet, we don't
know how many wins

334
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:20,416
we need to make that happen.
Frustrating, isn't it?

335
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,916
I started to wonder:

336
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,750
What if there was something
we could do to change that?

337
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,125
Hence this party.

338
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:29,041
With so many Selectors
gathered to do battle,

339
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,458
some are bound
to win enough

340
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:32,916
to meet these
elusive conditions.

341
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,416
As a result, a large
number of Eternal Girls

342
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,250
will be born right here today.

343
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:40,375
These Selectors...
They have no clue.

344
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:43,083
[IONA] Now, obviously,
for each of you who wins,

345
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:45,250
there will be another who loses.

346
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:48,541
Speaking personally, I have
no desire to fight anyone

347
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,625
but the strongest
Selectors available.

348
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,291
[RUKO gasps]

349
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:54,541
Therefore,

350
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,333
I have assigned you all
to tournament brackets.

351
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,875
If you win a battle, you
progress to the next round.

352
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:01,041
If you lose, you're out.

353
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:04,125
This will at least
prevent multiple losses.

354
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,833
And the Selector who makes
it all the way to the top?

355
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:09,541
Well, you'll be
facing me, of course.

356
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:20,583
[RUKO] Twelfth floor...
Room four?

357
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:34,125
[IONA] Is everyone ready?
I hope so.

358
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,791
Because the
battle begins now.

I know it hurts,
but when I'm finished,

00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:57,291
none of you will ever have
to go through this again!

This is the final blow, Tama!

Tama...

370
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:17,041
[RUKO] Please, I need
you to agree to this.

371
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:19,083
Otherwise my wish
won't come true.

372
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,041
[RUKO] I'm sorry, Tama.

373
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:23,833
But we have to do it my way.

374
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,166
[RUKO] We have to keep battling.

375
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:40,083
I shoulda
seen this coming.

376
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:43,083
Guess so. You ready
to talk to me now?

377
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:45,500
Like I said:
on the battlefield.

378
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,250
[BOTH] Open!

379
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:01,416
No new Eternal Girls
have been born yet.

Oh well!

382
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,083
On the other hand,
it looks like some Selectors

383
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,416
are losing their third
and final battles.

384
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:18,250
I will find my way there.

385
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:22,833
To that white room
where she's waiting.

mean, "wrong"?

to be like this.

remember how it was

Ruko...

406
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:09,000
[RUKO] We used to play
for fun, not to win.

407
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:12,583
No LRIGs, no battles, no wishes.

408
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:15,333
Back then, I thought
that wasn't enough.

409
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:18,416
I wanted serious battles--
serious victories,

410
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,916
instead of just
appreciating what I had.

Me, too...

412

[RUKO] Now it's gone.

We can never just enjoy
playing games again, as friends.

00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,083
That means she must remember.

418

She still has memories of us.

you to remember!

[YUZUKI] I know, but do you
want her to stay like this?!

Her life being controlled
by these stupid battles?

432
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,958
I don't. I want to be
best friends like we were!

433
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:10,666
[RUKO] Me too! I don't
wanna battle like this!

434
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,250
I wanna do it as friends,
like we used to!

435
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,375
It was so much fun,
please remember!

436
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:17,625
No, please stop it,
this is killing me!

437
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:19,666
Hitoe! Remember!

438
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:22,500
Your wish to make
friends already came true!

439
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:25,541
You can quit all of this!
You still have us!

440
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:27,958
Stop it...
Stop it! Stop it!

just shut up?

to hear any more of this!

wish come true, that's all!

we would battle

454

She still has it!

456
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:04,458
[URITH] Now, then.
Ready to say goodbye?

457
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:09,625
I've waited
long enough already.

458
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:13,083
Soon I will face my
final battle as Iona Urazoe.

459
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:14,833
[URITH] Oh, one final note.

460
00:23:14,916 --> 00:23:16,708
While it's been a
blast giving beatdowns

461
00:23:16,791 --> 00:23:18,875
to other Selectors with you.

462
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:21,875
I'm not gonna miss you
one bit, you rotten bitch.

463
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,500
[URITH] Still, I'll be beside
you to the very end... Selector.
