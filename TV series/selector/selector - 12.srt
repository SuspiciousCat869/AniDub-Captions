1
00:00:09,833 --> 00:00:12,416
[HATSU] Okay, okay,
let's all calm down!

2
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,250
You're not getting away this
time, you naughty laundry.

3
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:17,708
Hmm...?

4
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:24,666
I wonder what that is...

5
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,625
It's awfully beautiful.

6
00:01:58,208 --> 00:01:59,875
[RUKO] Her scrunchie...

7
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:05,291
She still has it!

8
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:08,958
You remember...

9
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:10,750
To tell you the truth...

10
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:13,041
...I've known for a while now.

11
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:17,000
Ever since... our last battle.

12
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:18,375
[HITOE screams]

13
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:19,333
[YUZUKI] Hitoe!

14
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:20,291
Hitoe!

15
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:22,166
[HITOE sobs]

16
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,666
Mama is here.

17
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,708
Hang on, Hitoe.

18
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:27,875
[HITOE] It hurt so much...

19
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:32,416
Like my heart was being torn
into a thousand pieces.

20
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,541
But even through
all that pain...

21
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,041
I kept thinking:

22
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:38,250
I won't... forget them.

23
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:39,500
[HITOE'S MOTHER gasps]

24
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:40,708
[HITOE'S MOTHER] Hitoe...?

25
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:42,500
[HITOE] But I knew what
it meant to lose you

26
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:45,375
and I knew that pain
would be even worse.

27
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,333
I won't be alone!

28
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:48,791
Welcome back!

29
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:51,666
But wait, if you remembered,

30
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,333
then why didn't you
tell us sooner?

31
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:55,625
[HITOE] Because I wanted
my wish to come true!

32
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,458
Because I wanted to win...

33
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:01,625
The wish itself
didn't matter...

34
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:04,708
If I won enough, Yuzuki
would complete the oath again

35
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:06,791
like she did with Hanayo.

36
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:10,083
And then she'd be
freed from the card!

37
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:11,875
That's right, isn't it?

38
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:16,416
[YUZUKI] What're you
saying, Hitoe?!

39
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,958
That wouldn't solve anything!

40
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:21,708
You'd end up like me!

41
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:24,375
I'm flattered you care
so much, but please,

42
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,250
don't worry about me.

43
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,083
I don't see this
as a bad thing.

44
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,791
In fact, it's more like
a dream come true.

45
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:34,916
Being with friends, making a
noble sacrifice to save them...

46
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,125
It's all just
so romantic...

47
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:41,708
I'm happy such a
beautiful thing even exists.

48
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:44,750
Of course, the battles
and stuff are incredible.

49
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,666
But meeting
the two of you...

50
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,166
Seeing what real
friendship is like...

51
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,833
To me, that's...

52
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:52,708
I guess...

53
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:54,375
It's like a miracle...

54
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:02,833
[HITOE] Finding a friend who can
do something important for you,

55
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:06,875
and being able to give
something back to that friend.

56
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:08,291
If I have that,

57
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:11,791
then there's not a single
wish in the world I need.

58
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:12,708
Hitoe!

59
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:18,541
[RUKO sobs]

60
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,000
Doing something
for a friend...

61
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,958
[RUKO] Please, Tama...

62
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:24,041
[TAMA gasps]

63
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:26,791
Will you finally
listen to my wish?

64
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,041
Ru, no.

65
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,541
We have to free
Yuzuki from the card.

66
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:33,333
There's a chance
to save my friends.

67
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:35,458
Nothing's more
important than that.

68
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:36,833
Huh...?

69
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:41,375
[TAMA whimpers]

70
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:46,333
I don't want you
to be so sad...

71
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:48,500
If I help, will you be
friends with me, too?

72
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:49,958
[RUKO] Uh-huh...

73
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,208
Okay!

74
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:55,375
You tell Tama what to do!

75
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:56,541
[RUKO gasps]

76
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:59,958
[TAMA] Battling's about
all I'm good for.

77
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,791
But if that can make
your wish come true.

78
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:07,041
I'll battle and battle
as much as it takes!

79
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:09,083
Thank you, Tama.

80
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:11,875
All right, guys!

81
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,375
You ready?!

82
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:15,166
Let's continue the match.

83
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,500
Oh, but Hitoe.

84
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:17,916
One last thing:

85
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,041
I'm sorry.

86
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,041
But there's no way I'll lose!

87
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:22,291
I've made my wish,

88
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:24,166
and it's coming true!

89
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,166
Ruko!

90
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,458
Attack: Arc Aura!

91
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:35,208
[TAMA yells]

92
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,291
Good game.

93
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:44,750
[HITOE groans]

94
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,375
[HITOE] I lost...

95
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:54,500
[RUKO] Hope that
didn't hurt, Yuzuki.

96
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:55,958
Only my pride...

97
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:56,666
Oh, hey.

98
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,208
What about your wish?

99
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,041
Oh yeah!

100
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,000
You finally figured it out?

101
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:04,291
It's clear now.

102
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:07,416
I want Yuzuki and all the
other girls trapped in cards

103
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,041
to be free...

104
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:09,750
Ruko, that's--

105
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:11,458
[YUZUKI] Whoa-whoa-whoa.

106
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:12,375
Slow down.

107
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:14,458
We need to talk about this.

108
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,958
[RUKO] But we did.

109
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:18,833
You're the ones who made me
realize what I needed to do.

110
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:23,083
If there's something I can do
for my friends, I should do it.

111
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:26,125
Nothing would make me
happier and that's final.

112
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,333
I'd better be going...

113
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:35,458
Wait a sec!

114
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,208
I'm coming with you!

115
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:39,000
[YUZUKI] Meaning we're coming!

116
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:42,125
[RUKO] Then-- you're
okay with my wish?

117
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:42,875
You're sure?

118
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:45,666
I guess so...

119
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,916
Not like I could
change your mind.

120
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,166
Just make sure you get
your wish right, huh?

121
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,875
I mean, yeah, duh, I want
to get out of this card.

122
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,125
But this'll be all for nothing

123
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,166
if you end up as
a LRIG yourself.

124
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,875
We're getting dumplings on the
way home and I want you there!

125

[RUKO gasps]

126
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:16,500
So, hey...

127
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,458
I can't wait to go
shopping with you, Tama.

128
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:20,291
You know, in person.

129
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:21,625
Can we eat dumplings?

130
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,708
I was thinking I'd buy
you some scrunchies.

131
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:26,166
So you can match the rest of us.

132
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,791
Sounds great!

133
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:40,958
[RUKO grunts]

134
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:45,583
[HITOE] Oh, boy...

Not good with heights...

136
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:51,333
I'd feel better about it if
I could pick out my apartment.

00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:52,791
Huh?

Hi, Ru.

your little friends.

here to support her!

make any difference.

[YUZUKI gasps]

150
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,291
Anything else, Ru?

151
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,666
A rousing speech, perhaps?

like to ask me?

No questions. No speeches.

scary when you fight?

00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,291
[URITH yells]

168
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,166
[BOTH grunting]

169
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,291
They're both so strong.

170
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:41,916
[YUZUKI] But look at Ruko.

171
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,291
[HITOE] I know.

172
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,541
[YUZUKI] Something's off...
Her eyes are so cold.

173
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,416
[RUKO] I don't get this.

174
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:54,166
Battles before were always fun,
or exciting, or something.

175
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,583
This is just... hollow.

176
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:03,125
[RUKO] It's so quiet...

177
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:07,666
[TAMA breathing]

178
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,500
[RUKO] I can even
hear Tama breathing...

179
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,958
[RUKO] This may
be my final battle.

180
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:17,333
I can't have any doubts.

181
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:18,791
Tama, Grow!

182
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,333
Use: Sword Ability!

183
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,208
[TAMA] Haah!

184
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:31,666
[URITH grunts]

185
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:36,041
[URITH pants]

186
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,750
Focus...

187
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,250
She's one of a kind.

188
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:40,708
Gotta give her that!

189
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,000
[URITH] Of course, you have
more than enough wins

190
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:45,500
to have your wish granted.

191
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:48,250
It's just the time
wasn't quite ripe.

192
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,833
This might give it the
"push" you need, though.

193
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,833
Assuming you're ready, that is.

194
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,250
Not just yet...

195
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,500
Now, Grow.

196
00:10:57,583 --> 00:11:00,500
Trust me, it won't
be much longer.

197
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:03,958
This isn't for my sake,
but for Ru's.

198
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:06,500
My Dear Ruko Kominato!

199
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:07,958
Black Desire!

200
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:11,750
[MAYU] Tama...

201
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,208
[TAMA gasps]

202
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,375
[MAYU] Tama...

203
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:20,833
[TAMA whimpers]

204
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:26,416
[RUKO] Tama!

205
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,541
[TAMA grunts]

206
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,000
[RUKO gasps]

207
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,041
[MAYU] Tama...

208
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,083
Can you hear me?

209
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,916
[TAMA] That's not Ru.

210
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,875
[MAYU] Tama.

211
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:44,166
[TAMA] But I know that voice...

212
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,083
...better than Ru's.

213
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,416
Maybe better than my own...

214
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,208
It must've been from
a long time ago...

215
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:54,333
[MAYU] You've finally
come to see me.

216
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:56,583
[TAMA] Who...

217
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,708
Who are you?

218
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:02,333
[MAYU giggles]

219
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,541
[MAYU] You poor thing.

220
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:16,166
All the pain she's
put you through.

221
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,583
[TAMA] Huh...?

222
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:19,750
[MAYU] Ru is... so cruel.

223
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:22,458
[TAMA gasps]

224
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,416
A wish to be together...

225
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,500
To never draw apart,
no matter what.

226
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:31,583
A dream that you believed in
with all your heart...

227
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,541
[MAYU] I know you love Ru,

228
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,875
but she cares for her
friends more than you.

229
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:38,708
[TAMA gasps]

230
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,333
[TAMA] No!

231
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,041
You got it all wrong!

232
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,291
Ru's not like that.

233
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,125
She said she'd be
friends with me too!

234
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,625
[MAYU] Tama...

235
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:49,458
After this, we were gonna go
eat ice cream and dumplings.

236
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,541
And then I was gonna
get a matching scrunchie

237
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,375
so I could be like
her other friends!

238
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,000
[MAYU] I'm so sorry.

239
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:57,500
[TAMA gasps]

240
00:12:57,583 --> 00:13:00,125
[MAYU] It's true that
Ru loves her friends.

241
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:03,625
She loves them so much
that she lied to you.

242
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,958
And now she's going to
become an LRIG for them.

243
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:07,375
[TAMA] That's wrong!

244
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:09,958
We're all going home
together after this!

245
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,083
So I have to win!

246
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,083
[MAYU] That won't happen.

247
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:14,750
Please listen to me.

248
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,083
Tama, try to remember!

249
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:28,416
[GIRLS crying &amp; moaning]

250
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,708
[MAYU] The solution is easy.

251
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:32,000
[TAMA gasps]

252
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:35,333
[MAYU] You want to stop Ru from
becoming an LRIG, don't you?

253
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:37,708
You don't have
to lose the fight.

254
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,791
You can refuse the
wish at the very end.

255
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,083
[TAMA] Huh...?

256
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,583
[MAYU] Yuzuki said the
same thing, right.

257
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,916
For a Selector's wish
to be fulfilled,

258
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,333
the LRIG must be in agreement.

259
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,916
[TAMA] But then, what will
happen to Ru's wish?

260
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,500
[MAYU] Win the battle and see.

261
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,791
Huh?

262
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:58,000
Then you'll know
her true feelings,

263
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:01,166
and you'll see why I'm
trying to protect you.

264
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,916
[TAMA] Protect me?

265
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,875
[MAYU] But only if you win.

266
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:07,750
[RUKO] Tama...

267
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,208
Tama!

268
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:11,875
Are you able
to get back up?

269
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:15,916
[TAMA] I'll find out
her true feelings.

270
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,208
If you're still hurt,
don't overdo it.

271
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:21,291
[TAMA] I'll fight and
I'll win the battle.

272
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:24,416
And then, it
will all be over.

273
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,875
Tama...

274
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,833
[URITH] That's a good girl.

275
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:31,375
Hate to see you give up
when it's just getting fun!

276
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:32,541
[IONA laughs]

277
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:33,708
Drawing!

278
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:34,750
Ener Charge.

279
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,291
Tama to Level 4!

280
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:40,250
[RUKO] No matter what
happens after my wish...

281
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:41,958
[TAMA] ...this is
the last battle.

282
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,541
[RUKO] I don't know
if it'll come true,

283
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,208
or if everything
will fall apart.

284
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,208
[TAMA] But we have to win!

285
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,916
[RUKO &amp; TAMA] This is the end!

286
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,625
What's that?!

287
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:54,791
It's not an attack...

288
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,250
What's happening?!

289
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,583
[HITOE] The battlefield's
coming apart!

290
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,583
[HITOE] The roof...?

291
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:21,916
Were we kicked out of the
battlefield for some reason?

292
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:24,666
No, look.

293
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,125
The sky...

294
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,166
And it seems like
they're still fighting.

295
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:35,416
[URITH giggles]

296
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:39,541
Okay, Ru, what should
I do for my next attack?

297
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,000
Hurry!

298
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,583
It's so beautiful...

299
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:51,791
[RUKO] And I just noticed... you
can see our apartment from here.

300
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:54,166
 That does make me feel better.

301
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,000
Ru?

302
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,125
What're you...?

303
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:57,291
[RUKO] Thanks, Tama.

304
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:58,500
Huh?

305
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,291
[RUKO] You wanted me
to see it one last time

306
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,791
before the end, didn't you?

307
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:05,166
The end?

308
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,625
Bye, Grandma...

309
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:11,708
I love you.

310
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:12,833
[TAMA gasps]

311
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,458
[URITH laughs]

312
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:15,916
[URITH] Can you
believe it, Iona?!

313
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,208
She thinks she's
already won this!

314
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,875
She's the best.

315
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:23,875
She honestly is...

316
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,708
My Ru...

317
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:27,375
[RUKO] What's the
next step, Tama?

318
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:28,833
Huh...?

319
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:34,083
[TAMA] Before the
last attack, an oath...

320
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:37,250
'Kay, I'm ready.

321
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,250
[YUZUKI] That's right,
before my wish was granted,

322
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,625
I took an oath with Hanayo, too.

323
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:46,875
It seals the final contract
between you and your LRIG.

324
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:50,916
But wait, if Tama lost her
memory, how does she know this?

325
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:02,625
Tell me what to say
and I'll say it.

326
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,666
[TAMA] Maybe...
she was lying to me.

327
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,541
She's not thinking
about going back.

328
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,458
She never was...

329
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:18,333
[MAYU] She thinks the only way
she can save her friends

330
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:20,500
is to become an LRIG.

331
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:21,958
[TAMA] She knew I
wouldn't agree with this

332
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,416
if she told me the truth...

333
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,625
She wants to
sacrifice herself...

334
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,916
[RUKO] Tama?

335
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,166
Please. Just tell
me what to say.

336
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:36,333
I accept the laws,
the laws of--

337
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:38,000
I accept the laws of?

338
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:41,291
The laws of the... Selector...

339
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,833
[RUKO] I accept the
laws of the Selector.

340
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,333
And...

341
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:48,875
[YUZUKI gasps]

342
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:50,375
Huh?

343
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:58,916
Tama, thank you.

344
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,333
[TAMA whimpers]

345
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,875
[URITH] Ugh! This
is taking forever!

346
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,625
The battle's almost over!

347
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:07,708
Can't we do something?

348
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:09,333
It's our turn, right?

349
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:11,083
Let's just finish 'em off!

350
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,083
[IONA] Urith, Bloody Slash.

351
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,791
Ready?

352
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:20,000
Yeah.

353
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,666
[BOTH] Use White Hope!

354
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,375
[URITH whimpers]

355
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,250
[crashing]

356
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,333
[GIRLS screaming]

357
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:34,916
[SELECTOR D] Uh-oh.
What's going on?!

358
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,708
Hang on,
is this normal?

359
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,666
[MIDORIKO] It's happening...

360
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,125
I knew it...

361
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,750
Yuzuki, what're
you looking at?

362
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,833
What's wrong?

363
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:00,666
[HANAYO (Y) sobs]

364
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,333
[KAZUKI] You okay?

365
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,375
[RUKO] Don't worry...

366
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:09,041
I don't have a single regret.

367
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:11,333
Because no matter what happens,

368
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:14,916
this was the wish that
I chose for myself.

369
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,458
I'm happy to make it...

370
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:18,958
[RUKO gasps]

371
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:30,500
[RUKO whimpers]

372
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:32,708
[HITOE] But why?

373
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,833
Ruko won, didn't she?

374
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:36,750
But the contract
wasn't completed.

375
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:37,708
Huh?

376
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,833
They skipped
the last part.

377
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,750
It goes: "And upon
this sacred oath,

378
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:44,208
a new Eternal Girl
shall be born!"

379
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:46,875
What's wrong?

380
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:48,666
[TAMA] I can't do it...

381
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,791
Even if you earned your wish...

382
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,750
I can't let you
turn into an LRIG!

383
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:57,250
I can't let you!

384
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:58,708
Tama...

385
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,875
What's happening?!

386
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:06,541
[RUKO] Stop it!

387
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:08,375
Tama, it's going away!

388
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:11,875
Finish the oath! Please!

389
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:14,375
No! Wait!

390
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:24,583
This is wrong!

391
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,291
[RUKO] But... I won
the battle, didn't I?

392
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,500
[URITH] Aww, don't
look so surprised.

393
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:35,875
Iona's been ready to have her
wish granted for some time now.

394
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:39,625
She's won a whole ton of
Selector battles, after all.

395
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:42,333
It's just we had to wait
for a certain "condition"

396
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:45,750
to fall into place before
we could seal the deal.

397
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:46,750
"Condition"?

398
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:47,875
[URITH] That's right.

399
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:50,416
But now the condition
has been met.

400
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,291
Hope you're happy, you've
been waiting long enough.

401
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,583
[IONA] That I have...

402
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,208
Not that I'm complaining.

403
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,666
But, what about me?

404
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,833
[RUKO screams]

405
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:06,875
[RUKO sobs]

406
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,208
Tama!

407
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:10,958
Snap out of it! Why
won't you grant my wish?

408
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:12,708
Did something happen?

409
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,125
Tama!

410
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:18,666
[IONA &amp; URITH] I accept...
the laws of the Selector.

411
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,458
[RUKO] No, You can't!

412
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:24,666
Damn it! Please,
just listen to me.

413
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,791
We have to turn everyone
back to normal!

414
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,208
[IONA &amp; URITH] "And upon
this sacred oath,

415
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:32,541
a new Eternal Girl
shall be born!"

416
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,916
Iona!

417
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:03,625
Wait... Iona, you're...?

418
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:05,791
[URITH (I) chuckles]

419
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,166
No, Urith...

420
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:16,541
Let's do this again sometime,
Miss Pain-in-the-ass.

421
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:22,916
Ruko...

422
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,625
Tama, why did--

423
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:28,041
[RUKO gasps]

424
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:29,833
Where did she--

425
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:31,291
[RUKO gasps]

426
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,791
[IONA] Oh, this
is gonna be fun...

427
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:37,666
Hi, Ru...

428
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,125
[RUKO whimpers]

429
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:46,583
[AYUMU] Ah, so good!

430
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:49,833
You really outdid yourself on
the sauce this time, Grandma!

431
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:52,458
[HATSU chuckles]

432
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:55,125
Ru must be having fun
and lost track of time.

433
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:56,208
She'll be fine.

434
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,500
Just eat already.

435
00:22:57,583 --> 00:23:01,416
Not yet, I made
this just for her.

436
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,791
When we eat, we do it together.

437
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:10,416
[TAMA] You told me... we'd
do everything together, Ru...

438
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,875
[RUKO gasps]

439
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:13,041
Tama!

440
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:15,291
Where did you go?

441
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:17,916
Tamaaa!

442
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:23,125
[TAMA] Being with
you... is my wish.

443
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,833
[URITH (I)] Ah, we meet again,
Miss Pain-in-the-ass.

444
00:23:31,916 --> 00:23:33,708
[IONA] So, Ru, who's
our first opponent.

445
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:34,916
I'm ready to fight.

446
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,666
[TAMA] Was it because
I did something bad?

447
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,041
[RUKO
'Cause you're my friend, okay?

448
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,125
That's why!

449
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:45,875
[RUKO] Next:
"Selector Spread WIXOSS."
