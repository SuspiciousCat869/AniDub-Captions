[HANAYO] After three losses,

your status as a

You can imagine what a
corruption of that would be.

00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:32,208
[RUKO] So you're saying
she lost her friends?

12
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:34,500
Far worse than that.

She can never
make friends again.

Horrible, but unfortunately,
there's more.

Well, it's a good thing I don't
have one, because either way,

161
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,041
I'll never battle again.

162
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,250
[TAMA] No! Please
don't give up, Ru!

163
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,625
I love battling with
you more than anything!

164
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,291
Don't quit now!

165
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:40,500
Tama... Sorry. But
I'm done. No more.

166
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:43,416
[URITH] Tell me, Little Miss
Drama Queen: wanting friends?

167
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,083
Being with someone you love?

168
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:47,833
Those are both pretty lame
wishes, don't you think?

169
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,958
[RUKO] No! Not at all!

170
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:51,708
[URITH] Deep down, you
agree, 'cause your wish

171
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:52,958
is a lot more exciting.

172
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:55,583
[RUKO] I told you
I don't have a wish!

173
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:58,958
You do. Don't try to
hide it 'cause we know.

174
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,333
How can you tell me that
when I don't even know?

175
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:05,083
Why are you saying this stuff?

176
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:08,750
[IONA] Because you and
I have... the same wish.

177
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:14,041
[IONA] It's that
feeling. I love it, too.

178
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,083
[RUKO gasps]

179
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:19,083
My life wasn't bad before
I started playing...

180
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,958
but it wasn't
especially good, either.

181
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,958
[RUKO] Wha- what do you mean?

182
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,333
I never gave my
life much thought.

183
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,583
Just accepted it
for what it was.

184
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:31,416
Until I found her.

185
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,500
And then....

186
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,416
That's when I
first felt it.

187
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,333
[RUKO gasps]

188
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:41,208
[IONA] I understood it.
I savored that feeling.

189
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:43,041
It gave me purpose.

190
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:46,750
It made me feel truly alive
for the very first time.

191
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:50,916
It felt like destiny.
Like it was part of my soul.

192
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,250
Doing battle is in my blood,
in my flesh, in my bones.

193
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,000
Do you see?

194
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,916
It is my very being.

195
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,166
But, come on...

196
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:07,041
If you lose three times,
you suffer a terrible fate.

197
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,916
And even if you win, someone
else will suffer instead.

198
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,291
How is that good?

199
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:15,208
Perhaps it's not. But
it is the nature of battle.

200
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:18,666
And our nature as
well. Both mine.

201
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,125
And yours.

202
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:21,291
Wha...

203
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:22,583
Is she wrong?

204
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,458
Stop it. Please just don't.

205
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:26,625
[URITH] Why not be
honest with yourself?

206
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:28,166
I know you've felt it.

207
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,708
And once you have, there's
no way you can ever quit.

208
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,125
[RUKO gasps]

209
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:35,458
Say what you like, but
you still yearn for it.

210
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:39,500
You lust for battle.
For victory.

211
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:43,750
I want nothing more
than to battle you.

212
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,000
[IONA] And you, me?

213
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:51,375
I do...

214
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:52,500
Yay!

215
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:53,875
Heh...

216
00:11:53,958 --> 00:12:00,875
Yes, I'd like to battle you.
I really would. Badly.

217
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:01,916
But you see--!

218
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,375
Open.

[RUKO gasps]

220
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:23,041
[URITH] What's the matter?

221
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:26,041
We both heard you. You
said you wanted to battle.

222
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:29,375
But, that's not what I meant!
You didn't let me finish!

223
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,250
[URITH] Sorry, was there
something else?

224
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,125
Ah, who cares! Forget
it and have some fun!

225
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,166
Good. Now, let's do this thing!

226
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,541
Battle!

227
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,333
Hey! Ru!

[TAMA screams]

229
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,541
This is just sad.

230
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,500
Even your pal Hitoe
put up more of a fight

231
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,916
and you know how
pathetic she is.

[URITH giggles]

233
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:44,958
[RUKO] A spell to search
for low level cards?

234
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,791
Why would she use that now?

235
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:53,875
[RUKO] I don't get it.
Something's not right here.

236
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,125
Why is she only using
low level attacks?

237
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,583
Tama! Grow!

238

[TAMA growls]

241
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:13,583
Wake up, Ru! It's
time to get serious!

242
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:21,250
Heh. Nice move, Iona.

243
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:23,500
If you could see what cards
were missing from your deck,

244
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:26,958
you could find out which ones
were used for your Life Cloth.

245
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:30,750
As a result, if
Ruko attacks now.

246
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:33,541
Tama, don't attack,
just end the turn early!

Huh?!

00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,416
What? Ah, too bad.

00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,791
with her friend's mom?
It's just down the street?

322
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:45,208
Yes, dear. She said
they were talking,

323
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,375
and all of a sudden, Ru got
upset and just ran out of there.

324
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:52,625
Weird. Dunno what that's about.
Well, you can ask her later.

325
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:54,583
'Cause I'm sure Ru's just fine.

326
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:57,750
[HATSU sighs]

327
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,541
[RUKO] What happened back there?

328
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:06,875
[RUKO] How could I?
I gave in to temptation.

329
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,541
I forgot about my friends,

330
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:12,583
forgot about what I did to
Akira. Nothing else mattered.

331
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:14,666
[IONA] That was incredible.

332
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,458
Please, tell
me you agree.

333
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,208
[RUKO gasps]

334
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:22,458
No. I wouldn't.

335
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:25,083
It's not incredible,
it's scary.

336
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,458
I feel like it's taking
me over. I've gotta quit.

337
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,125
[TAMA] No.

338
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:33,333
Tama. I'm sorry about this.

339
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:35,208
But I can't
battle anymore.

340
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:37,500
Understand?

341
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:38,958
[YUZUKI] Ruko.

342
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:42,916
[RUKO] Yuzuki!

343
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:48,041
[door creaks open]

[HITOE'S MOTHER sighs]

345

[door shuts]

346
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:19,875
So, hey... What's up?
I'm just, you know...

347
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:21,291
[YUZUKI] Did you do it?

348
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,375
Um.

349
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:24,166
[YUZUKI] Battle, I mean.

350
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,666
Uh...

351
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,000
[YUZUKI] You did.

352
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,250
[RUKO sighs]

353
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,708
I did and won. And got this.

354
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:32,166
[RUKO] Huh?

355
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,375
[RUKO gasps]

356
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:38,833
[YUZUKI] Akira wants
to meet with us.

357
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,416
Think she's here?

358
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,416
[YUZUKI] Hanayo. Sense anything?

359
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,500
[HANAYO] No. Nothing.

360
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,000
[RUKO whimpers]

361
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:01,500
[YUZUKI] Ruko.

362
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,625
[RUKO gasps]

363
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:06,333
[YUZUKI] This girl you
faced, what was she like?

364
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:08,666
She was... Well...

365
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,625
Mine was about
the same age as me.

366
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:15,416
I wonder... What wish
of hers did I kill?

367
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,166
[RUKO] Yuzuki...

368
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,375
[AKIRA] Boo-hoo!

369
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:20,750
[RUKO &amp; YUZUKI gasp]

370
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:22,625
[AKIRA] You two get to live
the bomb-diggetty lives

371
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:24,583
of Selectors, but you're
all sad and gloomy

372
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:25,958
about how hard it is!

373
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,166
[AKIRA laughs]

374
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,708
Poor "widdle" things!

375
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:31,250
On one hand, we have
super-gross Yuzu-poo

376
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,541
who's in love with
her own brother.

377
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,833
And on the other, we
have Ru-ru who, like,

378
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:38,291
gets off on WIXOSS
battles or something.

379
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,083
[AKIRA] Just like
what's-her-face.

380
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:47,083
Wait? Who do you mean?

381
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,625
What's with the mask?

382
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:52,041
What, this? Since you
asked I'll let you see.

383
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:53,208
Guess it's your lucky day.

384
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:53,958
[YUZUKI gasps]

385

[RUKO gasps]

386
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:58,666
[AKIRA] Lu-cky, lu-cky.

387
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,375
Aki-lucky.

388
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:34,125
[YUZUKI] I don't
know what it is.

389
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:35,500
But I feel different.

390
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:36,791
I think it's the
end of the road.

391
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:38,333
[KAZUKI] Yuzuki! What happened?

392
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:39,791
[RUKO] Think about how
your parents would feel

393
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:41,041
if something happened to you!

394
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:42,208
[YUZUKI] I won't
end up like her.

395
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:44,500
[RUKO] No, we're
not. This is awful.

396
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:45,416
[RUKO] Next time:

397
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,875
"That False Vow."
