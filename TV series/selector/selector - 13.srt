00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,583
It's battle time!

163
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
[YUZUKI gasps]

164
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,333
[YUZUKI]
It's her!

165
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:49,041
So you were... following us?

166
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:52,583
Sorry. My pal could stand
to work on her manners, huh?

167
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:55,375
I told you, Eldora!
I just knew they'd be here!

168
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:57,500
The heavens have parted
and Selectors have descended!

169
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:58,875
It's no mere coincidence.

170
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:00,250
This is destiny!

171
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,875
[ELDORA] Seeing as they're
holding a tournament,

172
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:04,041
it would be kinda weird
if they didn't show up.

173
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,708
Alas, though I try to escape,

174
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,708
it seems that battles
are drawn to me!

175
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,416
[ELDORA]
Yeah, you try real hard.

176
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,791
Like when you came here
looking for someone to fight.

177
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,958
Poo! Can't you play
along for once?

178
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:15,250
[ELDORA]
Sorry again, ladies!

179
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,166
I think she was dropped on
her head as a child.

180
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,166
[CHIYORI snarls]
Anyway!

181
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,375
[HITOE gasps]

182
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:23,166
[CHIYORI grunts]
Can we battle pretty please?

183
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,875
Battle...

184
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:41,625
[CHIYORI]
A back alley! [giggles]

185
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,250
It's the perfect scene!

186
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:44,833
[HITOE groans]

187
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:46,458
[ELDORA]
Out of curiosity,

188
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:49,041
you went to the big Iona
fan event thing, right?

189
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,875
I mean, you must have.

190
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:52,458
Yeah, we wanted
to go pretty bad,

191
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,000
but it just didn't work out.

192
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,500
Cryin' shame, don't ya know?

193
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,083
Ugh! That's enough!

194
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:01,208
[CHIYORI yells]

195
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:02,416
Open!

196
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,791
[WORKERS]
Huh...?

197
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,583
--[WORKER A] Are you lost?
--Wait.... What?

198
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,750
[WORKER B]
Umm...

199
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,000
Omigosh, she is so
lousy with directions,

200
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,458
we spent half the day bursting
into every other building

201
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,416
in town, running
around and around.

202
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,958
Then-- [yelps]

203
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:18,041
No! Stop! Shush! Shush!

204
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:21,333
[ELDORA]
I surrender! Mercy! Mercy!

205
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:22,666
Please ignore her.

206
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,416
We've all faced
tragedies in the past,

207
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,958
but our tears
shall become starlight

208
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,500
and our wishes shooting stars
in the field of battle!

209
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:29,958
Now open!

210
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,625
[CHIYORI]
Wait. Um. Huh?

211
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,291
[RUKO]
No battles. Sorry.

212
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:37,416
[CHIYORI]
What?

213
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,416
It just is not worth
the risk anymore.

214
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,291
[ELDORA]
Oh my.

215
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,250
But you're Selectors!

216
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:46,250
That means your wish'll
never come true!

217
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:49,500
Do you know what happens if
you lose? It's too dangerous.

218
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,333
Huh?

219
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:53,083
[ELDORA]
Heavens! Really?

220
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:53,750
I hadn't heard!

221
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,583
Oh, I know.

222
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,541
After your seventh
loss, you die.

223
00:11:57,625 --> 00:12:00,166
The magical WIXOSS factors
inside you go crazy.

224
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,666
Then it's like-- Kaboom!

225
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,041
--And your guts go-- Pchoo!
--You're wrong!

226
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,625
[CHIYORI]
Hmm?

227
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,458
[HITOE] What really happens to
you is even worse than death.

228
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:11,291
You lose all of your rights
as a Selector. And then...

229
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:15,625
[HANAYO] As for your wish,
it becomes corrupted.

230
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:19,208
For example, let's say your
wish was to become wealthy.

231
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:22,041
After losing three battles, not
only would that wish fail

232
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:24,125
to come true, you would
plummet into poverty.

233
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,916
If your wish was to be
an expert pianist,

234
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,958
you wouldn't just
lose your piano.

235
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,708
Something would happen
that would prevent you

236
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,625
from playing ever again.

237
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:35,916
Something to ensure your wish
could never come true.

238
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,875
All I can tell you is
her wish was to make friends.

239
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:42,750
You can imagine what a
corruption of that would be.

240
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:46,500
A corrupted wish.

241
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:49,208
That means... a new plot twist!

242
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:50,541
Oy...

243
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,041
I know I'm a Selector,

244
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,375
but I was able to make my wish
come true without WIXOSS.

245
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:55,333
There's another way!

246
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:56,708
I mean, I guess,

247
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:59,250
but it's way cooler to
do it with magic and stuff.

248
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:00,666
It's not nearly that simple.

249
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,208
[CHIYORI]
Hmm?

250
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:05,583
I won plenty of battles and it
only brought me more misery!

251
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,750
Even if you win
again and again,

252
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:10,166
your LRIG has to
agree to your wish.

253
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,500
And even then, the cost of
becoming an Eternal Girl

254
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,666
is too great.

255
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,958
[HANAYO]
Are you sure about this?

256
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:17,416
[gasps]

257
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,541
The oath. Do you remember it?

258
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,458
Yeah. It's, uh...

259
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:26,916
"I accept."

260
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,875
"The laws of the Selector."

261
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:31,250
"I accept the laws
of the Selector".

262
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,291
And, um...

263
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:33,625
[BOTH]
"And upon this sacred oath,

264
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:36,625
a new Eternal Girl
shall be born!"

265
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:38,166
[CHIYORI]
I know all that stuff!

266
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,416
It's right here in chapter two,
"How an LRIG is born," see?

267
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,541
"The Flames of Void Play
the Victory Song of Oblivion"

268
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,041
is the book, by the way.

269
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,291
A hundred percent awesome
and a hundred percent true!

270
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:49,625
That's just a novel!

271
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:52,166
[YUZUKI] Hitoe. Would you
show me to her, please?

272
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:54,833
[YUZUKI]
Hi, Chiyori.

273
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:55,875
[CHIYORI]
Huh?

274
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:58,708
We've met before. Remember?

275
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:00,166
[CHIYORI]
Huh?

276
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,125
[CHIYORI]
Hmm...

277
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:04,708
[ELDORA]
Oh! Yeah, right!

278
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:07,750
You totally felt familiar to me,
but I couldn't figure out why.

279
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:10,208
Come on, Chiyori,
use that noggin of yours!

280
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:11,166
You know her!

281
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,000
[CHIYORI]
Yeah?

282
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:13,375
[ELDORA]
Your first battle!

283
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,666
She's the girl who beat you?
How could you forget?

284
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,000
[CHIYORI]
Uh.

285
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:18,750
[gasps]

286
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,041
But, what happened?!

287
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,666
You're a card now?!

288
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,166
[YUZUKI]
After my wish was granted,

289
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,166
I took the place of my LRIG.

290
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,875
[ELDORA] Wow, you don't
say! You too, huh?

291
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:30,708
[YUZUKI] You get it now?
This is what happens.

292
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:35,375
I can't go to school anymore or
eat ice cream with my friends.

293
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,958
Or be with the one I love...

294
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,375
[gasps]

295
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,083
[TAMA]
I can't do it.

296
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:46,541
Even if you earned your wish, I
can't let you turn into an LRIG!

297
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,500
It doesn't matter
how many times you win,

298
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,375
you'll just end up like me!

299
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:51,500
Eldora, was it?

300
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:54,291
[ELDORA]
Huh? Oh yeah, um, that's me.

301
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,416
[YUZUKI] If you're an LRIG,
you know about Mayu

302
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,625
and the white room
and all of that!

303
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,208
If you've suffered
through this yourself,

304
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:02,625
how can you subject
someone else to it?!

305
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:05,916
[ELDORA] Well, my memory HAS
been awfully spotty lately.

306
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,833
So that's how things work, huh?

307
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,833
It seems like this is
finally sinking in.

308
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,250
Yeah.

309
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,916
So now that you know,
you won't battle anymore, right?

310
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,208
[CHIYORI]
Sweet! It's just like the novel!

311
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,416
The heroine becomes
the card in the final chapter

312
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,083
and it slaps you with a big, fat
"to be continued" at the end!

313
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:24,791
That's even better than before!

314
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:27,291
If I get a wish and I get to
enter the world of WIXOSS,

315
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,416
that's like a,
like a double wish!

316
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,500
[gasps]

317
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:32,916
[CHIYORI grunts]
Chiyorin!

318
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,458
[ELDORA]
Huh?

319
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:34,750
No, that's dumb.

320
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:35,916
Chiyorumba?

321
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,916
Chiyo, Chiyo...

322
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,083
[gasps] I need a cool LRIG name.

323
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,000
You've done this before.
What's your call?

324
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:43,208
[ELDORA] I wouldn't worry
about it if I were you.

325
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:44,166
[CHIYORI]
Wait, what does that mean?

326
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,458
When you put it that way,

327
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:46,958
it's like you don't think
I can win at all!

328
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:48,583
[ELDORA]
No, I know you can do it.

329
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:51,708
You're the best ever. All your
losses are just a coincidence.

330
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,458
[CHIYORI]
Why're you such a hater?

331
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:54,791
What now?

332
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:55,708
[sighs]

333
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:56,416
[IONA]
Ru.

334
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,958
[gasps]

335
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,958
[IONA]
Listen to me, Ru.

336
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:03,375
[RUKO]
No...

337
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:04,375
[gasps]

338
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:05,458
Stop it!

339
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:06,083
[YUZUKI]
What's wrong?!

340
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,000
[RUKO sobs]

341
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:08,791
Wait! Ruko!

342
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,333
[CHIYORI]
That's weird...

343
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:16,208
[thunder rumbles]

344
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:19,666
[RUKO panting]

345
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,875
Come back! Talk to me!

346
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:25,750
[TAMA] I'll fight,
and I'll win the battle.

347
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:28,916
And then, it'll all be over...

348
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,833
[BOTH]
Use White Hope!

349
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:37,458
[HITOE]
But why?

350
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:39,166
Ruko won, didn't she?

351
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,125
[HITOE]
Ruko?

352
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:46,041
[YUZUKI]
Hitoe?

353
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,500
[gasps]

354
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:53,291
[RUKO sobs]
Stop it!

355
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:55,625
No! Wait!

356
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:57,833
You can't! Damn it!

357
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,541
Please, just listen to me!

358
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,250
[IONA, URITH]
And upon this sacred oath,

359
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:04,375
a new Eternal Girl
shall be born!

360
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,541
[RUKO]
Iona!

361
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,708
[IONA]
Why the long face, Ru?

362
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,166
You can tell me.

363
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:29,333
[IONA]
We're partners, aren't we?

364
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:33,333
Iona... I--

365
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,875
Tama. Why did--

366
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,333
[gasps]

367
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:47,750
[RUKO gasps]
Tama! Where did you go?!

368
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,083
Tama!

369
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:55,625
What happened to her?

370
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,416
[YUZUKI]
Did you do this?

371
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,750
[IONA] Urith explained it.
Weren't you listening?

372
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,750
[HITOE] She said Iona won
more than enough battles

373
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:05,041
to have her wish granted,
but for whatever reason

374
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,583
the time wasn't right
and she needed to wait

375
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,583
for something else
to happen first.

376
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,041
[YUZUKI]
So whatever the condition was,

377
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:12,125
it was met in this battle?

378
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:14,250
[HITOE]
Iona, what was your wish?

379
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:18,041
[IONA] Hmph. To become
an LRIG, of course.

380
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,541
[HITOE gasps]

381
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,208
[IONA] But I had to be the
LRIG of someone

382
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:23,333
stronger than me,
so we could keep fighting.

383
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:25,125
So your condition wasn't to win,

384
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:26,875
but to lose to
the right Selector?

385
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:28,291
[YUZUKI] And what
happens to Ruko's wish

386
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,375
if it wasn't granted?

387
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,416
If you're her LRIG, then...

388
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,416
Then we'll work out
the details ourselves.

389
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,583
You're the best, Ru.
I knew it all along.

390
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,375
You were the one.

391
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:44,666
Tama... What happened...?

392
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,166
Where did she go?

393
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,875
[IONA]
Who knows?

394
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:52,416
[RUKO sobs]
No... Tama!

395
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:58,458
[RUKO sobbing]

396
00:18:58,541 --> 00:18:59,625
[IONA]
Why did you run?

397
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:01,000
You should've accepted.

398
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,666
I'm done with this.

399
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,708
You want to see Tama, don't you?

400
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,875
There's there only one way
for that wish to come true.

401
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,208
You have to battle.

402
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:09,500
[RUKO]
I won't do it.

403
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:12,166
Not like that! I can't!

404
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,041
[IONA] Then why do you
still carry me with you?

405
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:15,375
[gasps]

406
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:18,000
[IONA] If you're "done,"
you should throw me away.

407
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:20,083
[sobs]

408
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,291
I was right. You want it.

409
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:27,958
[IONA]
You can't give it up.

410
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,291
Ruko...

411
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:40,458
[YUZUKI]
I wasn't going to ask, but...

412
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:43,666
Why did you bring her
with you? For her sake?

413
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,375
Or did you want to
battle after all?

414
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:46,625
[HITOE]
It's too dangerous!

415
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,500
We don't know what
might happen anymore.

416
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:50,750
[YUZUKI]
No kidding! Tama disappeared.

417
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:52,500
Iona became your card.

418
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:55,208
There's no way we could've
predicted any of that!

419
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,208
Who's to say it
won't get even worse?

420
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,291
You're right.

421
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:01,666
But I have to see Tama.

422
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:06,250
And I... I still want to
help you and everyone else.

423
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:09,916
Listen to me. We agreed on this.

424
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,750
I know we did,
but everything's wrong!

425
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,875
What should I do?!

426
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:19,125
We're all as confused
about this as you are,

427
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,458
but we'll work it out
together, somehow.

428
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,375
[YUZUKI] You don't have to
shoulder the responsibility

429
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,791
by yourself. You're not alone.

430
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,875
We're friends.
We can all help each other.

431
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:29,458
[RUKO sobs]

432
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:31,750
[RUKO]
Hitoe... Yuzuki...

433
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:33,875
[RUKO sobs]

434
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:39,000
[IONA] There are too many
things I don't understand.

435
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:42,208
What is Ruko trying
to accomplish with this?

436
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:47,500
I know that we're the same. I
know that she longs for battles.

437
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:49,625
But that wish of hers
is a problem.

438
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:52,875
[RUKO] I still want to help you
and everyone else.

439
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,750
[IONA]
An LRIG only accepts a wish

440
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:57,833
that they know they can grant.
We aren't omnipotent.

441
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:00,541
And yet, they held onto
that vague impossibility

442
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:02,208
to the bitter end.

443
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:05,083
It's no surprise things went
as poorly as they did.

444
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,541
[IONA]
But I'm her LRIG now.

445
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:10,500
Things are different.

446
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,791
I'll find a way to change her.

447
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:16,333
[IONA]
I won't let her waste her time

448
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:19,000
chasing after some
impossible wish.

449
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:22,666
[IONA] I want her to battle
to her heart's content.

450
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,458
To love it and long for it.

451
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,958
[IONA]
With me at her side.

452
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:37,458
[IONA giggles]

453
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:39,875
[ANNOUNCER]
Next stop: Shinjuku Station.

454
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:41,333
Shinjuku.

455
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:48,083
She's my only clue
to finding Tama.

456
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:50,791
What? What did you say?

457
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:53,541
[RUKO] Nothing.
Just talking to myself.

458
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:01,208
[RUKO]
Wait for me, Tama.

459
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:34,875
[YUZUKI]
Akira! She's back!

460
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:36,666
[AKIRA] The next one of you
punks who says that name

461
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,041
in front of me is gonna get
their teeth kicked in, got it?

462
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:40,500
[RUKO]
What do you mean?

463
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:41,916
[AKIRA]
Would you shut the hell up?

464
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,416
[YUZUKI]
If she doesn't have Tama...

465
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,583
[RUKO]
Mastermind?

466
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:46,916
[RUKO] Next time:
"That Feverish Bond."
