--[TAMA gasps]

00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,791
May-Mayu.

00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:19,666
[URITH laughs]
It looks like Mommy's angry.

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:20,541
Iona!

7
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:21,791
[RUKO]
What's the matter?

8
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:23,250
Are you okay?

9
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:24,833
[IONA]
I'll be fine.

10
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:27,583
Don't worry, Mayu can't kill me.

11
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:29,750
I am her friend, after all.

12
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:31,000
Her child, too.

13
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:33,416
And also...

14
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,625
...Mayu herself.

...herself?"

18
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:38,000
Me.

19
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:39,458
Urith loves me.

20
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,291
[IONA]
The girl in the white room.

21
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,625
She was raised alone since
the day that she was born.

22
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:48,500
The outside world,
a mystery to her.

23
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:51,041
[MAYU panting]

24
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:25,791
[IONA]
Mayu was always alone,

25
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:28,333
never knowing what
that even meant.

26
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:41,375
[IONA] Every so often,
something or someone would come,

27
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:44,125
affecting her in some way.

28
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:46,458
That was all that
she understood.

29
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:50,500
She didn't know who she was or
what was happening around her.

30
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:59,500
[IONA] That room, and that
emptiness, was her entire world.

31
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:06,208
[IONA] Eventually, she noticed
things being placed around her.

32
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:10,708
[IONA] Occasionally
receiving an unknown visitor,

33
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,541
who would bring
these items to her.

34
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:18,583
[IONA]
She had no idea why.

35
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:21,375
Maybe it was out of pity.

36
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:23,958
Or maybe it was just
a passing whimsy.

37
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:30,791
[gasps]

38
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:39,375
[MAYU]
What... is... this?

39
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,875
[IONA] 
Thus, she found out...

40
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:50,000
that beyond her window,
there was a world outside

41
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:52,666
that she'd never
been aware of before.

42
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:59,000
[IONA] A world full of
girls who looked like her.

43
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:02,083
But unlike her,
they were not alone.

44
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:07,125
A... lot... of... friends.

45
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:11,500
[MAYU]
Their wish... came true.

46
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,750
Their wish...

47
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,000
[IONA]
Then one day...

48
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,416
[IONA]
She understood

49
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,291
she had been given some
sort of new plaything...

50
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:28,083
but one that couldn't
be played all alone.

51
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:33,791
[TAMA gasps]

52
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,708
[RUKO gasps]

53
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:37,375
[IONA]
She needed friends.

54
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:09,000
[IONA]
And thus, she created them.

55
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:10,250
"She created them"?

56
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:13,083
Yes, though not in the
literal sense just yet.

57
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:15,083
They were imaginary friends.

58
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:17,250
They existed only in her mind.

59
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:21,541
[MAYU] You're the good girl.
Shiro, the Girl of White.

60
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:25,708
You're the bad girl.
Kuro, the Girl of Black.

61
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:28,541
We'll be friends
from now on, okay?

62
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,541
[SHIRO (MAYU)]
Yup, nice to meet you.

63
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:33,125
[KURO (MAYU)]
Sure, I'll be your friend, too.

64
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,791
[laughs]

65
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:39,750
[SHIRO (MAYU)] Okay, next,
Shiro's gonna summon Tlet.

66
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,958
[MAYU]
That won't work, Shiro.

67
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,291
[KURO (MAYU)]
I'll stop that with Vimana.

68
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:46,208
[SHIRO (MAYU)]
Oh. You will?

69
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,791
[MAYU laughs]
Okay, it's Kuro's turn.

70
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,791
[KURO (MAYU)]
Here I go. Attack!

71
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:53,458
[SHIRO (MAYU) yelps]
Oh, she got me!

72
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:56,250
[MAYU laughs]
Now, it's your turn, Shiro.

73
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,625
Do your best.

74
00:05:57,708 --> 00:06:00,125
[SHIRO (MAYU)]
'Kay! Here goes!

75
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:03,791
[IONA] Eventually, the girl
started a new type of game.

76
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,750
[SHIRO (MAYU)]
The outside world?

77
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,333
Yes.

78
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:10,416
You two will bring girls
from the outside world here.

79
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,041
And you'll tell them this:

80
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,500
That if they win the game,

81
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,750
then their fondest
wish will come true.

82
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,000
[KURO (MAYU)]
All right, but how?

83
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:20,708
You're going to play
WIXOSS with them.

84
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,583
And whoever wins will take on

85
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:24,166
the wish of the
girl they brought.

86
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,500
[SHIRO (MAYU)]
The girl with the wish,

87
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,625
what's going to happen to her?

88
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:30,625
[MAYU] She'll be sealed
away in the world of cards.

89
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,083
And for her to escape from it,

90
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:34,291
she'll have to bring
another girl here.

91
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,833
[KURO (MAYU)]
What about the girl who loses?

92
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,583
[MAYU]
Her wish won't come true.

93
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,583
No, wait...

94
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:44,166
Not only that, but...

95
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,041
Her wish will be corrupted.

96
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,041
[RUKO gasps]

97
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:48,166
That's just like--

98
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,833
Just like a Selector battle.

99
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:50,875
[laughs]

100
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:58,625
[SHIRO (MAYU)] Hold on.
Isn't that kind of mean?

101
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,041
[MAYU]
Why?

102
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:02,583
A girl can choose whether
she wants to play or not.

103
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:05,833
No one's forcing her to do
this if she doesn't want to.

104
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,916
[KURO (MAYU)]
That sounds like fun.

105
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,041
[MAYU]
Doesn't it?

106
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:10,583
Great! Let's do this!

107
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:13,000
[SHIRO (MAYU)]
Okay, if you say so.

108
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,125
[IONA]
And so, it began.

109
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,208
[SHIRO (MAYU)]
Now, it's Shiro's turn.

110
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:20,750
Watch out, Kuro.

111
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:23,708
[SHIRO (MAYU)]
Rococo Boundary!

112
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:26,208
[MAYU]
Whoa! Good, Shiro!

113
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:27,541
[GIRL A (MAYU)]
Keep making moves like that and

114
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,125
you're going to win this game!

115
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:32,375
[GIRL A (MAYU)]
Remember, Shiro,

116
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,416
my wish is to become a florist!

117
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,708
[SHIRO (MAYU)]
Right! Shiro will do her best!

118
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:38,625
[MAYU]
And now it's your turn, Kuro.

119
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:43,250
[KURO (MAYU)] I'm not going
to lose to you, Shiro.

120
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:44,583
Oh, I hope you win, Kuro,

121
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:47,166
because I wanna be a
princess more than anything!

wasn't good enough!

[GIRL A (MAYU) crying]
You mean we lost?

128
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:02,625
Yes, and now that you have,
your wish will be corrupted.

129
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:05,208
What that means is you
can never become a florist.

130

[GIRL A (MAYU) sobs]

131
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,041
That's not all, either.

132
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:10,791
You'll also never
be able to smell or

133
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:13,708
even see flowers in
your life ever again.

134
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:16,333
In fact, you'll live in a world
where flowers don't exist.

135
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:18,750
[GIRL A (MAYU) cries]

136
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:22,291
[laughs] So, now I can
become a princess, right?

137
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:23,291
[MAYU]
Wrong.

[GIRL B (MAYU) screams]

139
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:30,000
[MAYU] Kuro will fulfill
your wish instead.

140
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:31,875
If you want to escape your card,

141
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:34,708
you'll have to bring a
girl here to replace you.

142
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:35,875
[IONA]
From this,

143
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:38,000
she bore even more girls...

144
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:40,333
...into this imaginary
world that she created.

145
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:41,541
[GIRLS murmuring]

146
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:43,083
[IONA]
And within it.

147
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:48,416
The laughter of those girls,
their cries, their screams...

148
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,833
...resonated over
and over again.

149
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:53,791
[IONA]
But...

150
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:57,375
...the more that her imaginary
world gained complexity,

151
00:08:57,458 --> 00:09:01,791
the more the girl realized
where she actually was.

152
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:06,583
[IONA] A world where there
were no colors, voices,

153
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,833
or anyone real, for that matter.

154
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,916
[MAYU]
Hey, Shiro? Kuro?

155
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,875
Isn't it strange?

156
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:18,416
I get to play with
so many friends.

157
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,125
But I'm the only one
who's ever actually here.

158
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:24,541
Also, the wishes
they all have...

159
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:27,000
I can't even see what
any of them are like.

160
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:29,791
[SHIRO (MAYU)]
Say, Mayu?

161
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:32,750
You must have a wish, right?

162
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,833
[KURO (MAYU)] Shiro and I will
be happy to make it come true.

163
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:36,958
[MAYU]
Thank you.

164
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:39,291
You're both such
good friends to me.

165
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,125
[MAYU]
Very well...

166
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,375
My wish...

167
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:56,708
Then, you and Tama...

168
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:59,291
[IONA]
Mhm, that's right.

169
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:02,791
It's not just Mayu's story,
but ours as well.

170
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,958
[HITOE gasps]

171
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:09,375
So then, since I met
Mayu in that room..

172
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:10,916
Yes.

173
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,250
It means that she's still out
there, influencing the game.

174
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:17,833
She's still alone,
in the same room,

175
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:20,375
wishing the same
wish for all time.

176
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:23,875
That's why I'm here.

177
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:29,583
Huh?

178
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:32,208
What is this?

179
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:33,250
[gasps]

180
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:38,541
[IONA] It was then,
that I truly awakened.

181
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:43,500
So this is the real world.

182
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,250
My name's Kuro.

183
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,625
And I'll fulfill
your fondest wish.

184
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,833
[IONA]
As for Mayu's fondest wish,

185
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:59,541
from that lonely room,
she yearns for it.

186
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:00,666
Strongly.

187
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,791
Sharply.

188
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:02,750
Earnestly.

189
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:05,625
Okay, but what is her wish?

190
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,291
--[IONA] Revenge.
--[gasps]

191
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:11,000
[IONA] Against those who
live in the outside world,

192
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,208
those who are allowed
to have wishes,

193
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:15,583
and all the girls who
are allowed to select.

194
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:18,750
She wants one thing
and one thing only.

195
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,875
[IONA]
Revenge.

196
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:24,791
That's what this is about?

197
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:27,208
[gasps]

198
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:33,000
[IONA] As for all the
other girls that Mayu bore,

199
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,125
they became LRIGs.

200
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,833
And I continued my
battles against them.

201
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:42,625
What about the ones who lost?

202
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,250
[IONA]
They disappeared,

203
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:47,958
and their Selectors
replaced them as LRIGs.

204
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:52,625
The LRIGS Mayu bore that
remain alive are me and Tama.

205
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:58,458
[IONA] Winning led me to
become a human like you.

206
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:00,500
And then, an LRIG came to me

207
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,541
and from there,
you know what happens.

208
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:03,583
[gasps]

209
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:08,083
[IONA] I continued to battle
so I could become an LRIG again,

210
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:12,625
then a Selector, then an LRIG
again, and so on, and so on...

211
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:13,958
But why?

212
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,458
[IONA]
My story.

213
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:17,666
Didn't you listen
to a word of it, Ru?

214
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:19,791
[IONA]
Kuro?

215
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:20,916
[MAYU]
Yes.

216
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,500
That's you.

217
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,125
The bad girl, Kuro.

218
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,125
You will battle for
all of eternity,

219
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,958
and you will bring
misery to everyone.

220
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,625
That is your fate,

221
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,208
as the Girl of Black.

222
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:38,000
[IONA] After numerous times
as both an LRIG and a Selector,

223
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:41,916
I became the girl
you met, Iona Urazoe.

224
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,916
[IONA]
Then Urith came to me,

225
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,666
in the same form I had
when I was called Kuro.

226
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,250
[AKIRA]
Urith.

227
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:52,166
[URITH (I)]
Heh.

228
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,875
Why the change in form?

229
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:55,375
That's cruel.

230
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:56,833
We're just her playthings.

231
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:59,083
t's like dressing
dolls in new clothes.

232
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:02,375
[giggles] Guess it was just
one big game after all!

233
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:04,500
But you're all
friends, aren't you?

234
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,666
Mayu made you and
Tama to be friends.

235
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,708
Shouldn't that count
for something?

236
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,083
Yes, it should.

237
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,166
But it makes no
difference to her now.

238
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,750
[AKIRA]
I don't care.

239
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:18,166
Even if she came to Iona, Urith
cares for me. She told me so!

240
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,666
She told me, do you hear?!

241
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,125
Lost it.

242
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,625
I was created by
Mayu to do battle.

243
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:27,375
But as I continued
to fight more of them,

244
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:28,833
a new feeling came over me.

245
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:29,875
Like what?

246
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:33,166
[IONA] For the first time,
I felt something.

247
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,458
I could actually sense my
own body and soul for once.

248
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:40,250
It was almost as if
I was finally real.

249
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:41,541
[RUKO gasps]

250
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:43,541
[IONA] Since then,
I sought to become stronger

251
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:46,708
by seeking out only the
most powerful of Selectors.

252
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,458
And then I met you...

253
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:49,375
Ru...

254
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:50,875
You were the strongest.

255
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:54,750
But your LRIG was
Shiro, and not me.

256
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:59,166
Eventually I lost to you and
my wish came true, but then...

257
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,125
You refused to battle.

258
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,041
It made me so angry.

259
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,333
You were supposed to be like me!

260
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:08,541
But you preferred
your insipid friends!

261
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,958
I didn't understand
how this could happen.

262
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:14,541
But then we battled.

263
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:17,666
Your strength flowed
into me, Ruko.

264
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,166
It felt nice and warm.

265
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,500
Life-altering.

266
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,708
You felt it, too, Tama.

267
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:26,916
I understand why it changed you.

268
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,916
The strength you and Ru shared.

269
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,541
It comes from a bond,
feeling for others.

270
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,458
You experienced that
and felt it yourself,

271
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:36,375
and that's why you
were able to change.

272
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,791
That's the reason
why you refused

273
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:40,166
to fight the battles
you used to love.

274
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:46,041
Now you have something more
important than battling!

275
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:49,625
Uh-huh. I don't need
to battle anymore.

276
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,833
'Cause I like Ru
more than battles!

277
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:54,583
[gasps] Tama...

278
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:56,333
I like Yuzuki, too.

279
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:59,375
Hitoe, of course,
and also, Grandma.

280
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:00,958
I like everybody!

281
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,041
Tama!

282
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,583
[TAMA]
I want Mayu to become friends

283
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:06,000
with everyone just like I did.

284
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,375
If she does, maybe
she'll stop doing this!

285
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,125
No one will have
to battle anymore!

286
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:11,583
Tama...

287
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,708
Your memory finally came back!

288
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:15,583
[gasps]

289
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:16,916
That's right.

290
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,875
Mayu, she was lonely
being all by herself.

291
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:22,583
I'd forgotten about her,
but now I can remember.

292
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:23,791
Tama.

293
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,250
Ruko said you thought
you might be able to

294
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,583
turn the LRIGs back
to normal, right?

295
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:31,875
[gasps] Uh-huh, but I'm
not exactly sure how to.

296
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:34,458
[IONA] Well, think about
what changed the two of us.

297
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:35,333
Huh?

298
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:37,583
Wait, you mean battling with us?

299
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:39,125
I think that's the key,

300
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:41,500
us spending time with
Ru and her friends.

301
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:42,500
So then--

302
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:43,750
If Mayu becomes
friends with them,

303
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,166
she might change her mind, too!

304
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,416
That's right.

305
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,083
So, let's get her out of
that room and fix this.

306
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,833
So if we can do that,

307
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,250
we can put an end to
all the Selector battles,

308
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:56,416
and save all of those poor girls
who turned into LRIGs, right?

309
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,041
Iona.

310
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,250
Tama.

311
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,625
You can hear us,
can't you, Mayu?

312
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,416
Playtime is over now.

313
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,791
What's more, we're going
to get you out of that room!

314
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:13,000
[MAYU whimpering]
G-Get me out? 

315
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:16,041
[whimpering] I can't
leave. It's scary!

316
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,875
No! I can't!

317
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,416
If we're gonna save
her and everyone else,

318
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,708
We stop Urith!

319
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:24,000
Yeah, that's right!
And if we defeat her,

320
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,958
we'll also be able to save Tama!

321
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,250
Once Tama's set free,

322
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,916
she and Iona can finally
be together again, too!

323
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,291
[laughing] You losers done
with this sentimental crap yet?

324
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:38,416
It's supposed to be my
turn again now, you know?

325
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,208
[chuckles] But I will admit,

326
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:43,333
I enjoy seeing all of you
overflowing with such hope.

327
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:44,708
Please love me.

328
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:45,958
[URITH (I)] Because that'll
make it all the sweeter

329
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:48,250
when I wreck every
last one of you!

330
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:51,125
And sorry, but Tama
is my weapon now.

331
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,458
She's going to crush the dreams

332
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:55,333
of all the miserable
Selectors out there!

333

No! I won't!

334

[URITH (I)]
Yes, you will,

until your own heart is broken
into tiny little pieces!

336
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:01,333
You're sick.

337
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,041
We're not gonna let you do that!

338
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:06,333
Iona's at Level 5, there's
no way Tama can beat her now!

339
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,791
Well then, why don't I try this?

Impossible!

Urith's possessing Tama?

What? No!

Get away from her now!

355

Urith, I thought you said
you wanted to be with me!

Please help me, Ru!

Iona, what's happening?

358
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:47,500
I feel like something's
trying to take me over!

No, don't! Stop!
