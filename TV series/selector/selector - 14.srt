1
00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:10,666
[YUZUKI]
I've been thinking.

2
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,791
If we want answers, we're
going to have to hunt down

3
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:14,791
the mastermind behind this game.

4
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:16,625
[RUKO]
Mastermind?

5
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:19,041
You mean the girl
in the room, right?

6
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:21,583
You saw her after
you became an LRIG.

7
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:26,000
But then we'd
have to play WIXOSS.

8
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:28,041
Not only that, we'd need
to have a wish granted.

9
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:30,875
[YUZUKI growls] I told you,
we're not resorting to that!

10
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:32,625
We'll find another way!

11
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:34,083
[RUKO]
Okay.

12

[RUKO]
I admit it.

15
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,791
I don't have a wish yet.

16
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:53,583
But things have changed.

17
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:55,083
That's not true anymore.

18
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:57,666
We have to free Yuzuki
from the card.

19
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,458
There's a chance
to save my friends.

20
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:01,916
Nothing's more
important than that.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,291
[IONA] You want to
see Tama, don't you?

22
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:05,291
[HITOE] It's too dangerous!
We don't know what...

23
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:08,000
[YUZUKI] Who's to say it
won't get even worse?!

24
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:11,208
[RUKO] We've been told nothing
but lies this entire time.

25
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:13,583
I can't play by their rules
if I expect to win.

26
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:16,333
But I can't make my wish
come true on my own, either.

27
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:17,416
And if I do nothing...

28
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,875
[RUKO gasps]

29
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,916

[HATSU]
When you're finished, Ru,

36
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,375
are you up for a game of WIXOSS?

37
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:24,500
[RUKO]
Huh?

38
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,083
I made a new deck
and I'd love to see

39
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:29,208
how it stands up against yours.
We haven't played in a while!

40
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,833
Umm... Uh-huh!

41
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,291
Sounds fun!

42
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:37,541
[RUKO] I've never seen someone
use that LRIG before.

43
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:40,000
Whoa, that's a really
cool effect, too!

44
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:42,541
You always say that, but
then you stick with Tama,

45
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:43,750
no matter what.

46
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:44,791
[RUKO]
Huh?

47
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:48,041
Uh. Well, actually,
I just recently

48
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:51,208
put together a brand
new deck as well.

[IONA]
Why aren't you using me?

52
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:58,666
This isn't a Battle

53
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,291
there's nothing at stake.

Are you really that childish?

Let's see.

56
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,583
There's no tangerines to peel,

You can't do this forever.

Or rather, a means to an end.

316
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,833
Once I have a partner,
my true wish--

317
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:46,416
[AKIRA]
Is to find another Selector

318
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,208
as powerful as your own.
And battle her.

319

[RUKO gasps]

320
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,041
[RUKO]
Akira.

321
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:53,583
Long time no see, Ru-Ru.

322
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:55,583

326
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,125
[RUKO]
You want to battle.

327
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,166
[AKIRA]
What?

328
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,041
Don't act so surprised, Ru-Ru!

329
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:18,666
Anyway, I got a brand new deck
I'm just dying to try out.

330
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,625
With this little
cutie right here.

331
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,958
Hi! My name's Milulun!

332
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:24,875
So nice to meet you!

333
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:28,750
Wait. Why would you-- I
mean, after what happened,

334
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,291
you still wanna do this?

335
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,750
[AKIRA]
Yeah, no, I get it.

336
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,958
You mean because
I'm Aki-Un-lucky now.

337
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,000
Sure, I can cover it up,

338
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,916
but this scar is never
gonna go away...

339
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,416
What am I supposed to do?

340
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,125
Spend the rest of my life
being ashamed of my own face?

341

[MILULUN]
Ooh, my poor buddy!

342
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,083
Um... Yeah, but-

343
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:52,666
Ru-Ru, please, you have
to battle me again,

344
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,083
so I can get my
confidence back

345
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,875
and claw my way
out of this hole!

if Akira or Iona

351
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,666
are planning
something with this.

Wow, don't you
look fancy, Iona!

355
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:42,166
That's one way to lose weight.

356
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:45,375
You had it all and you'd
rather be trapped in a card.

357
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:48,083
Gotta say, that is
royally messed up!

358
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:53,458
Well, if you're such a
glutton for punishment,

359
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:56,875
then let Aki-lucky
whip your ass!

[YUZUKI]
What if she goes after Ruko?

362
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:06,666
[HITOE]
Hm?

363
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:10,375
I mean, you've seen how Akira
tears into other Selectors.

364
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:14,125
If she doesn't have Tama,
Ruko might not hold up.

365
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:18,625
[HITOE] What kind of girl
do you think Tama was?

366
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:20,791
[YUZUKI]
Huh?

367
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,750
Before she got turned
into an LRIG,

368
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:25,166
she was a normal girl
just like us, right?

369
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,458
Uh... Oh, yeah.

370
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,083
Guess you're right.

371
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:30,208
Kinda hard to imagine though.

372
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:33,375
She used to make those
little "meow" noises.

373
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,125
Maybe she was a cat!

374
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:39,125
Either way, she's Ruko's
friend, just like we are.

375
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:40,875
[YUZUKI]
I know.

376
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,708
That's why she won't give up.

[RUKO]
What?

382
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:56,625
Use my card's ability.
It forces them to attack.

383
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:57,958
You know how this works.

384
00:18:58,041 --> 00:18:59,666
Just summon a high-powered SIGNI

themselves on it.

to go easy on her.

to become an LRIG

and you get stuck with

you're getting off
