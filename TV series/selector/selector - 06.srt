Hmm. Strawberries... I guess.

00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,125
[WRITER] I see! You have
cute tastes, Miss Iona.

00:00:15,208 --> 00:00:16,458
[MALE STAFF A] Hate to say
"I told you so,"

5
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:18,750
but Akira's down
in the rankings again.

6
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:21,458
On top of that, she's
been ditching work lately.

7
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:23,375
She's really not
worth it anymore.

8
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:25,250
[MALE STAFF B] Eh, her
style doesn't really match

9
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:28,375
our magazine anyway.
Kinda "low-class," y'know?

10
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:29,666
[MALE STAFF A] So
what should we do

11
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,166
about the front page
model for the next issue?

12
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,250
What d'you think? Drop
Akira and go with Yuko?

13
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:37,291
[WRITER] Well,
that's just lovely.

14
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:40,083
I wish they'd have their little
business talk somewhere else.

15
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:41,791
I like them
with some milk.

16
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,125
And just a pinch of
sugar. Is that weird?

17
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:46,791
[WRITER] Huh? Oh, right,
strawberries. Sorry...

18
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:48,958
I always take the
backside of my fork.

19
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:51,041
And smash them to bits.

20
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,666
Just so we're clear,
I'm gonna make you apologize!

21
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,125
Open!

22

[HITOE] I'm home.

23
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:39,416
[HITOE'S MOTHER] My gosh!
What happened, Hitoe?

24
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,916
You're soaked
to the bone!

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,583
Your friends didn't come
with you? Did they go home?

Anyway, dry yourself
off before-- Hitoe?

28

Looks like I'm up
first! Aki-lucky!

29

We're gonna school
this scrub, Piriluk!

30
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:09,791
And don't go easy on her
just 'cause she's a newb!

31
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:11,250
Is it okay?

32
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:12,125
[RUKO] What?

33
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:14,708
Tama... will fight to win this.

34
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:18,125
Of course.

[TAMA gasps excitedly]

36
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:24,000
I'll draw. Drop a card in the
Ener Zone, have Piriluk, Grow!

37
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:26,333
And now, say hello to Sky Cat!

38
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,291
Tama. Let's Grow!

 I summon Kukri and Ponya!

Tch! You gotta tell your
LRIG to lay off the coffee.

[TAMA giggles]

42
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,458
[RUKO] It's weird.
I've never felt like this.

43
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:41,458
But battling Akira
is awful. It's painful.

44
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,125
[RUKO] It is painful, but...

45
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:46,750
[RUKO] I love it!

46
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,791
What the hell? No fair!

47
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:51,125
I thought she was
supposed to be a newbie.

48
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:54,333
You are correct. Though
she's new to the game,

49
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:56,000
she takes battle
quite seriously.

50
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,208
Huh?

51
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,500
This is talent.

52
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,041
She has a gift.

53
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:03,000
You trying to tell
me something?

54
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:06,750
Why don't you turn around
and say it to my face? Huh?

55
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:09,750
You know what? Screw you,
I don't even care anymore!

56
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,833
You just keep your mouth shut
and do what I tell you, got it?

then all the ones in
your hand go bye-bye.

And since you dumb rookies
love to play by-the-book,

65
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,500
there's only one answer:

seem you missed.

Arrgh! Who cares! I don't
need you to tell me that!

71
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,000
Why don't you do
something useful

72
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:44,791
and figure out her
wish for me instead?

73
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,583
My wish...

74
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:49,083
Here it comes!
Try not to flip out

75
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:52,375
and wet yourself when I see
your dirty little secret.

You LRIGs can't like,

She has...
no wish.

00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:14,875
Yeah, she's right. I admit it.
I don't have a wish yet.

[AKIRA] Hah! What?
Lemme get this straight:

84
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:20,375
You're battling as a Selector,
but you have nothing

85
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:23,333
you wanna fight for?
That is, like, so messed up!

86

What are you, a
sociopath or something?

87
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:28,916
All the Selectors are,
like, do or die when it

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,458
comes to their wishes!

89
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,833
And you're just crapping all
over that so you can "have fun?"

That is sick, yo. Sick.

91
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:37,958
[IONA] Participating as a
Selector without having a wish

92
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:39,791
is more than just wrong.

00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,708
[AKIRA] What does
it matter to you?!

162
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:51,791
I can run my battles however
the hell I want, can't I?!

163
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,333
Can't I?!

164
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,750
[URITH] Yes, you certainly can.
Though I do have to question

165
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:59,291
the effectiveness of your little
method, since you lost so badly

166
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:01,000
to the next girl Iona beat.

167
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,333
[URITH] That's why you stopped
feeding off Iona's scraps,

168
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:05,916
isn't it?

169
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,375
And why you started picking on
the rookie Selectors instead.

170
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:09,708
[URITH giggles]

171
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:11,791
[URITH] Tell me how that
worked out for you again?

172
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:15,750
[IONA] Yet another
loss. Pathetic.

173
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:20,041
I don't want your filthy
hands disgracing any more

174
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,083
Selector battles.

175
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,541
Screw you!

176
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:25,541
[URITH] Your wish is to see
Iona's life ruined, right?

177
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:26,708
[AKIRA gasps]

178
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,375
[URITH] I know you
want to beat her.

179
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:30,875
So why don't you challenge
her to a battle already?

180
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:33,083
Why do you avoid it
when she's right here?

181
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,375
I told you!

182
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,791
I can battle however
the hell I want to!

183
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:40,041
And either way, when I get
my wish you're going down!

184
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,250
[YUKO] Thank you very much!

185
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:42,458
[AKIRA] Huh...?

186
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,041
[URITH giggles]

187
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,083
[URITH] Oh! Looks like
Yuko's here for the shoot!

188
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,541
[AKIRA] Are you kidding?

189
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,791
But I thought me and Iona
were doing the cover today!

190
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:52,958
[IONA] You don't have
a shoot today. Sorry.

191
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:54,416
[AKIRA] What...?

192
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,833
While you were so occupied
looking for rookie Selectors

193
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:58,875
to pick on, you seem
to have lost your

194
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:00,500
coveted position as a model.

195
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:01,708
[AKIRA gasps]

196
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,208
[URITH laughs]

197
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:06,458
[URITH] Aw, are you gonna cry?
You tried too hard to ruin

198
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:09,958
Iona's career and
ended up ruining your own!

199
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,000
[IONA] I don't want
to keep them waiting.

200
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,916
[IONA] Goodbye, loser.

201
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,833
[AKIRA] I don't care about
my career, or my life,

202
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:23,791
or anything, as long
as I can ruin yours!

203
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:26,125
I'll tear you apart!
With my own two hands

204
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,000
if I have to, you bitch!

205
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:30,958
[URITH giggles]

206
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:32,958
[URITH] Time to put
her out of her misery.

207
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,791
[HATSU] It doesn't seem
like you have a fever...

208
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,000
But you're still
not feeling well?

209
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:46,500
No... My head feels
like it's gonna explode.

210
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:48,083
I see.

211
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:50,125
Well, I'll call the school for
you and tell them what's wrong.

212
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:53,208
You just lay there and
take it easy, all right?

213
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,833
Now I'm making
Grandma worry again.

214
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:01,583
[TAMA] Ru...

215
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:04,291
Ahh, and I bet
you enjoyed it!

216
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,208
Why do I like
battles so much?

217
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:11,208
Why do I keep
wanting to have them?

218
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,041
I know all the horrible
things that'll happen

219
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:14,625
if I continue playing.

220
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,958
But still... I can't stop!

221
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:19,583
You don't have to cry, Ru!

222
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,000
Y'know what?

223
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,958
It makes Tama so happy to
see you have fun battling!

224
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:26,916
So don't be sad! We can
have lots of battles and--!

225
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,541
No! Stop it!

226
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:30,083
Please, Ru...

227
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:35,583
[BOY A] Hey, Kazuki. You aren't
too busy today, are you?

228
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:36,416
[BOY B] Yeah, let's hang!

229
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,333
[KAZUKI laughs]

230
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:39,208
Okay! Sounds good!

231
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:40,416
[BOY A] Didn't think
you'd say yes.

232
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,791
[BOY B] Cool. We can
grab some grub.

233
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,333
[KAZUKI] If you like curry,
I know a place.

234
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:45,500
[BOY A] Let's go!

235
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,250
Can we talk for a sec?

236
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:51,583
[GIRL A] Nothing personal.

237
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,458
But you and Kazuki
are kinda leaving

238
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:54,708
a bad impression on people.

239
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:55,958
[YUZUKI] What?

240
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:56,958
[GIRL B] Like, the way
you two always hang out

241
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:59,125
is bordering on creepy.

242
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,000
Jeez, could you
be any more blunt?

243
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,791
Anyway, don't look so upset.

244
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:05,416
We're not teasing, we're
actually really worried.

245
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,791
You're worried?

246
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,250
[HONOKA] We've been hearing
all those awful rumors

247
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,541
about you two, so we came
to give you some advice.

248
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:13,916
Do you think I'm stupid?
What's it matter to you?

249
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,500
[sighs]

250
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:19,166
All right, fine, I'm
actually worried about Kazuki.

251
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,583
You, I couldn't care less about.

252
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,625
When I see you
stalking him all day.

253
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:26,083
It just makes me
feel sorry for him.

254
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:28,583
[GIRL A] Yeah, it's awkward!
Maybe you don't realize it,

255
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,541
but Kazuki's actually
a pretty popular guy.

256
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:34,125
But now there's all these
weird rumors because you--

257
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:35,750
Jeez, nice attitude.

258
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:38,083
[GIRL B] Guess what they
say about them is true. Ew.

259
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:40,041
[HONOKA] Now, now...

260
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,166
[YUZUKI] Damn it...

261
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,000
[HANAYO] Yuzuki.

262
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,458
[YUZUKI] Don't talk to me!

263
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,625
[YUZUKI] What's wrong with
them? Everyone's so stupid.

264
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,208
They're the creepy ones, not me.

265
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:58,958
[YOUNG GIRL] Howdy-dooo!

266
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:04,708
I knew it! You're a
Selector, aren't you?

267
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:09,083
Yay! I finally met one.
I am the awesomest!

268
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,958
Ugh! Selectors are
so hard to find!

269
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,583
Oh, by the way,
my name's Chiyori!

270
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:18,333
So can we have a battle
already? Pretty pretty please?

271
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:20,916
Listen, kid. Here's
a little secret.

272
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,458
[CHIYORI] Ooh!

273
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:25,208
If you lose three
Selector battles...

274
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:28,500
Something unspeakably
terrible happens to you.

275
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,083
Yuzuki...

276
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:35,041
Duh, I already knew that! It's
all written down, right here!

277
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:38,541
Huh? A novel? Of WIXOSS?

278
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,250
[CHIYORI] Yup! So yeah,
after your third loss,

279
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:43,291
the magical WIXOSS Factors
inside your body go crazy

280
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:46,208
and blow up like a hot air
balloon, until "kaboom!"

281
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,083
Guts flying everywhere!

282
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,791
Pretty scary!

283
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,166
Wait, that's not--

284
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,000
[CHIYORI] That's why
Selectors are so cool, right?

285
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,125
They put their lives on the
line to fight for their wishes!

286
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,083
Uh-huh...

287
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,708
[laughter]

288
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,083
Hey, sorry.

289
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:04,500
My girl here's a little soft
in the head, you see.

290
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,625
Ugh! Eldora!

291
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:09,333
She'll see how hard my
head is when we battle!

292
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:12,375
Now! Back to what I
was saying before!

293
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:15,291
I'm offering my commemorative
first battle to you,

294
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:18,166
Ms. Selector-on-the-playground!

295
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,291
I don't know...

296
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:22,250
[HONOKA laughing]

297
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,458
Oh, stop it. You're
too much, Kazuki!

298
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:26,166
It's not that
big a deal.

299
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,750
[HONOKA] You don't have
to go home yet, do you?

300
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,875
[KAZUKI] Uh, no, I guess not.

301
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,750
[HONOKA] Oh good! There's
still a bunch of stuff

302
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:34,375
I need to ask you!

303
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:38,416
[CHIYORI] C'mon, let's
battle! Please! For me?

304
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,583
[YUZUKI] Fine.

305
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:42,125
Yuzuki!

306
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,625
Let's do this.

307
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:47,833
Yay! Finally!
It's battle time!

308
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:50,958
[knock on door]

309
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:54,916
Hey, Sweetie, I've
gotta step out for a bit.

310
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,791
Try to take it easy, okay?

311
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,416
[HITOE] It's strange...

312
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,541
I feel like I've been
searching for something.

313
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,500
But I can't remember
what it is...

314
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:11,750
[bird chirping]

315
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,916
[HITOE] I just know
that if I can't have it...

316
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,833
Nothing matters...

317
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:18,791
And there's no reason
to be alive anymore.

318
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,083
[CHIYORI sobs]

319
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:31,000
[CHIYORI] The bitter,
bitter taste of defeat.

320
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,958
[ELDORA] Yep, she's strong.
Way stronger than you, Chiyori.

321
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:36,875
Sorry about that. Bet that was
a waste of your time, huh?

322
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:39,291
You're so rude!
Learn the rules!

323
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:42,583
In her first fight the
heroine has to lose, okay?

324
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:45,541
[ELDORA] Yeah, I'll be sure
to write that one down.

325
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:48,416
[CHIYORI] Oh! Here,
give this a read, it's good.

326
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,666
We'll meet again
for sure. Right?

327
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,166
Fare thee well,
Selector!

328
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,041
[CHIYORI grunts]

329
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:55,041
[CHIYORI makes engine noises]

330
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,916
You all right?

331
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,166
[YUZUKI] Well, I finally won.

332
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,166
[HANAYO] Yes...

333
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,708
[YUZUKI] All it takes
are three losses

334
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,791
and my wish is gone forever.

335
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:10,041
But there's no telling how
many times I have to win

336
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:14,000
if I want it to come true.
Isn't that the way it works?

337
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:16,125
[HANAYO] "Only when the
conditions are met."

338
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,250
"The conditions," huh?

339
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,791
That's kind of cryptic,
don't you think?

340
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:24,333
I'm sure you'll tell me
after it's too late.

341
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:27,083
All I've thought about is
winning, but now I wonder

342
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:29,458
what would happen if
my wish was corrupted?

343
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:33,875
[YUZUKI] Maybe Kazuki would
drift away from me?

344
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:36,166
No, it has to be
worse than that.

345
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,791
I bet he would end up hating
me and I'd never see him

346
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:41,083
again for the rest of my life.

347
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,541
He was with that girl.
I wonder where they went?

348
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:48,916
[HANAYO] Stop it.

349
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,541
Maybe they went to Momoka's
place to pick out cards.

350
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:54,541
I think his friends are
still new to the game.

351
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:56,958
That used to be "our thing"
we did together, you know?

352
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,375
[HANAYO] Yuzuki, listen to me.

353
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,291
[YUZUKI] Then maybe
they'll go to a movie

354
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,041
and stop by the
food court afterwards

355
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,666
to try out their new decks.

356
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,791
Then they'll get a snack
and exchange numbers.

357
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:09,875
Laugh and smile...
Walk home together.

358
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,291
Yuzuki!

359
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:15,166
I hate it.

360
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,208
If they're going to
take Kazuki away from me,

361
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:20,000
I'd rather just die now
and get it over with!

362
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,333
[HANAYO] No matter
how upset you may be,

363
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:27,250
you should never say
something like that.

364
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:31,125
You don't think I'm serious?
I hate you for lying to me.

365
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:36,291
But, I know, I know I need you
for my wish to come true.

366
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,625
I'm not stupid!

367
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,416
I know Akira made
a fool of me,

368
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,791
but I did beat that
new girl, no problem!

369
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:45,500
If I still have a shot at
becoming an Eternal Girl,

370
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:50,083
then my wish can come true!
Kazuki can be mine forever.

371
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:53,875
And he won't be
taken away from me!

372
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:59,791
[HANAYO] Listen. I am your
LRIG, through thick and thin.

373
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:04,125
I will always follow you.
Wherever fate take us.

374
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,250
[RUKO] When I was
living with Mom,

375
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:14,541
I don't think I asked for too
much. I wasn't spoiled.

376
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,708
She always wanted
to be left alone,

377
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:20,500
so I tried not to
bother her. But--

378
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:22,458
[RUKO'S MOTHER] I don't know
what Ruko's thinking.

379
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:25,708
There's something...
scary about her.

380
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:28,791
[RUKO] I never knew how or
why I was scaring my mom.

381
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:32,208
And that made me afraid, too.

382
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:35,708
But I'm fine as long as I have
Grandma and Ayumu with me.

383
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:38,166
And I try not to ask for
too much from them.

384
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,416
I don't want to scare anyone,
or bother anyone,

385
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,041
or hurt anyone ever
again. But now--

386
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,000
[TAMA] Y'know what?

387
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,583
It makes Tama so happy to
see you have fun battling!

388
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:56,333
[RUKO panting]

389
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:59,666
[RUKO] No! No, please!

390
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,125
[RUKO grunts]

391
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,000
[AKIRA] Where do you get
off acting like a victim?

392
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,291
You just wanted
to see me suffer.

393
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:12,208
And I bet you enjoyed
it, didn't you?

394
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:13,708
[RUKO gasps]

395
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:18,125
[HATSU] Ru. Wake up, Ru!

396
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,208
There's a phone call for you.

397
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,125
I explained that
you were asleep,

398
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:25,083
but apparently, it's
something important.

399
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,541
[RUKO] Wha...?

400
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:40,708
[door bell chimes]

401
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,166
[HITOE'S MOTHER] Oh!

402
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:46,625
[HITOE'S MOTHER] Sorry to
just call out of the blue.

403
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,041
Do you like parfaits?

404
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:50,125
I probably should've
asked before I ordered,

405
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:51,666
but I hope it's okay.

406
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,041
[RUKO] Uh, thanks.

407
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,500
Hitoe usually gets the
kind with candied chestnuts.

408
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,291
This one looks awfully good.

409
00:19:57,375 --> 00:20:00,250
I'll have to come back
here with her some time.

410
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:01,708
So what did you--

411
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,583
I looked through
Hitoe's phone.

412
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:08,875
She had your number and
Yuzuki's in her contacts.

413
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,250
[RUKO] Huh?

414
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,791
You must think I'm a
horrible mother for snooping,

415
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,625
but I also found this.

416
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,000
Here.

417
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:18,708
Hold on. Is this the notebook
she kept on WIXOSS?

418
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:20,000
You've seen it?

419
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,250
Uh, yes ma'am.

420
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,416
[HITOE'S MOTHER] Hitoe
can't read it anymore.

421
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,291
She said that all the
words were "disappearing."

422
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,833
She also tells me she
doesn't remember you.

423
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:30,291
[RUKO gasps]

424
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,750
[HITOE] Today, Ruko
and Yuzuki and I

425
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,708
bought a matching
set of scrunchies.

426
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:40,333
They both looked
really cute

427
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:43,541
when they put them in their
hair. They said I was cute too!

428
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,666
I'll have to take
their word for it.

429
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,416
I was already so happy,
but having the chance

430
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,875
to be together with them,

431
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:54,083
sharing all of our fun and
joy, it was just wonderful.

432
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:57,625
Friendship truly is
a beautiful thing.

433
00:20:57,708 --> 00:21:00,666
[RUKO whimpers]

434
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,666
[HITOE'S MOTHER] She was so
happy to make new friends.

435
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,541
She wouldn't stop
talking about you.

436
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,916
I don't know what went wrong.

437
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,208
Ruko, please, if there's
anything you can tell me

438
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,166
about what happened,
even if you had an argument

439
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,416
or she got angry at you over
something, I don't care!

440
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,916
I promise I'm not trying to
blame you, but it seems like

441
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
something just snapped and I
need to know what caused it--!

442
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:22,333
[RUKO sobs]

443
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:23,833
Ruko... Tell me.

444
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,541
[RUKO whimpers]

445
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,833
[RUKO] Hitoe lost three times.

446
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:29,625
[HITOE'S MOTHER gasps]

447
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:33,166
[RUKO] I was just having fun,
battling with my friends.

448
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,791
We didn't know what
would happen if we lost.

449
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:38,250
I mean, her wish had
already come true.

450
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:41,458
We didn't know it would
get corrupted like that.

451
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:45,666
Ruko, I don't... Please, just
explain what this is about.

452
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,458
Ruko, wait!

453
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:53,250
[RUKO] I feel so lost.

454
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:56,291
Everything is wrong.

455
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:59,416
I don't know what to do anymore.

456
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,875
Help me!

457
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:35,208
[URITH] You came here because
you wanted to battle.

458
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:37,916
[RUKO] Why are you
saying this stuff?

459
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,583
[IONA] I want nothing
more than to battle you.

460
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:41,666
[RUKO] I do.

461
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,166
[URITH] Forget it
and have some fun!

462
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,166
[RUKO] Next time:

463
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,916
"The Girl's Desire."
