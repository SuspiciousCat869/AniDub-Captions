00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,125
[RUKO] Poor Yuzuki.
She was crying.

2
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:34,708
Ah.

00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:44,500
[HATSU] They're only one
building away from a Tetris.

4
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,458
[HATSU] And then the whole city
might just disappear on us.

5
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:08,666
[RUKO] If that does happen...

6
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,750
I wonder if whatever's
making Yuzuki sad

7
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:12,250
will disappear, too.

Hey, Grandma,
I'm finally--

10
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:30,250
[YUZUKI] About time!

11
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,500
We've been wondering when
you were gonna get home.

12
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:39,083
Yuzuki was nice enough
to help with dinner tonight,

13
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:40,291
such an angel!

14
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:42,375
Not to mention a real
whiz in the kitchen!

15
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:44,708
Oh, stop it! You're
embarrassing me!

16
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:46,958
What the what?

17
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,250
[YUZUKI squeals]

18
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,416
Wow, it's so tasty!
This stuff is incredible!

19
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,750
Thank you, and please,
eat as much as you want.

20
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,916
[YUZUKI] Yes, ma'am!
Ruko, you lucky punk!

21
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,625
You get to eat like
this every day?

22
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,583
Um. I guess?

23
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:36,416
[RUKO sighs]

24
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:39,791
It's fine. But is she
here 'cause she doesn't

25
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:42,500
wanna go home?

26
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:44,833
That bath felt so good!

27
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:46,500
So, Yuzuki.

28
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:48,583
Thanks to a belly full
of food and a hot bath,

Knock it off! Bad girl!

36
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:06,291
[YUZUKI] Yeah so,
um... I'm sorry.

37
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,208
I was really
mean to you.

38
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,708
[YUZUKI] Why not?

39
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,791
'Cause I have no idea
what you're thinking, Ruko!

[WOMAN'S VOICE] I don't
know what she's thinking.

41
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,625
It scares me.

42
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:25,958
It's okay! No biggie!
It's nothing to apologize for.

43
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:27,416
[YUZUKI] The truth is...

44
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,750
I was so afraid of losing
to Akira the whole time.

45
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:35,541
I was upset. And then, it
just ended in the worst way.

46
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:36,791
[RUKO] Oh.

47
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:40,541
[YUZUKI] That's not all.
There's this boy I like.

Wha--? C'mon now,
don't think like that.

51
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:51,166
Hey. I'm sure this
guy will fall for you.

52
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,166
[YUZUKI] Huh-uh.
It won't happen.

53
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,916
And it shouldn't, either.

54
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:02,041
[YUZUKI] I just wish...
these feelings would go away.

55

Hold on a sec. This guy you
have a thing for, it's not...

I wonder what it feels
like to be in love.

61
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,541
I guess you get
really excited, huh?

62
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:45,708
Yeah, excited! You know
what makes Tama excited?

[KAZUKI] Oh, she
went home already?

00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,916
Okay. Thanks so much.

and practice battle strategies.

She takes notes and
that seems to help her.

74
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,541
So I figured it wouldn't
hurt me to give it a shot.

75

That's a fantastic idea!

answer to you is yes!

[RUKO] Huh?

99
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,125
You see, during that
battle I had with Akira,

100
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:53,333
things got so painful
I started to wonder if

101
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:56,041
I'd ever even want
to play again.

102
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,958
Yeah, I know the feeling.

103
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:01,666
I knew battling as a
Selector would probably hurt,

104
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,833
but no pain, no gain, right?

105
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,791
We are trying to fight
for a wish after all.

106
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:09,875
Thing is, I enjoyed my
battle with Ruko so much

107
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:13,166
that it completely changed
my tune! It was fun!

108
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,208
Awesome! I had fun, too!

109
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:16,833
Well, in that case,
why don't we all

110
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,333
play a round,
just for kicks?

111
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:19,875
Yeah, that's a great idea!

112
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,500
[HITOE] But we're all Selectors.

113
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,125
So if we battle
against each other,

114
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:25,083
that means somebody's
wish could--

115
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:26,750
[YUZUKI] Nah, don't
worry about it.

116
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,750
As long as none of our
LRIGs are in the deck,

117
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:32,208
we can play the game just
like normal people do.

and have fun.

[HITOE] Right!

Mmman! When do I get to play?

128

Finally!

[HITOE] Okay, Summon: Baromet.

What?!

133
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,500
Wait! Yeah... Lemme see...

134
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,625
Baromet's power level
is only 7000.

135
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:13,458
So if Yuzuki has her
card Grow on next turn,

136
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,708
she'd crush it in
one shot. Right?

[HITOE gasps]

138

140
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,250
Jeez, how would you like it
if I gave away your strategies

[MIDORIKO chuckles]

147
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:34,083
You and Ruko are really
alike, aren't you?

148
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:39,250
Well, I guess Hitoe's
wish already came true.

149

So she doesn't need
to battle anymore.

150

It seems not.
You okay with that?

00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,166
I am.

152
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,000
[HANAYO] But, that
means you're...

153
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,166
It's fine.

[YUZUKI gasps]

157
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,541
Right. So sorry.

158
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:02,625
Well, you are helping me.
So there's no need to apologize.

159
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:05,333
We're friends now,
right, you big doofus?

160

So... friends tease and

like the other Selectors do.

any harm in fighting her then.

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,541
[YUZUKI sighs]

321
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:35,250
But it is. Let me
put it this way.

322
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,750
Remember when I said I wish I
knew what you were thinking?

323
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:38,708
Yeah?

324
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,833
Still do.

325
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:44,708
But there is one thing I
know for certain about you.

326
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:48,791
You really like WIXOSS battles.
You're so happy when you play.

327
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:56,416
[YUZUKI] But battling Akira
is awful. It's painful.

328
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,125
Trust me, I know
from experience.

329
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:03,958
And I'm worried that playing
her will make you hate the game.

330
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:05,750
I don't want that to happen.

331
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,208
Yuzuki.

332
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:10,791
[running footsteps]

333
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:12,000
[GIRL I] Down this way?

334
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:14,250
[GIRL G] That's what
the first-years said!

335
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,750
This isn't good.

336
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,666
I'll draw them outside
and distract them.

337
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,500
So you just stay put, okay?

338
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:20,416
[RUKO gasps]

339
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,041
No. Wait.

340
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,791
Hey, don't worry.
Be back soon!

341
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:25,625
But--

342
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:28,291
[door opens]

343
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:29,666
[crash]

344
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,666
[GIRL I] There they are!

345
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,125
[GIRL G] Don't let
'em get away!

346
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:35,458
[running footsteps]

347
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,208
Dang it all.

348
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:48,333
I'm grateful to have a friend
who's so worried about me.

349
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:52,125
But the truth is...

350
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:54,291
[RUKO] It's better
if she doesn't know.

351
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:57,291
And I can't even explain it.

352
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:00,208
But I still want to do
this for some reason.

353
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:04,541
Am I nuts? Why do I want
to battle Akira so bad?

354
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,000
It's all I can think about.

355
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:06,583
[TAMA] Ru?

356
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,041
[RUKO gasps]

357
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:14,083
Ru and Tama are the same!
Want to battle Akira, too!

358
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:15,291
[RUKO gasps]

359
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,083
[TAMA giggles]

360
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,208
[RUKO] There's something
scary about her.

361
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,208
[RUKO] But she and I...

362
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,375
We're the same.

363
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:27,833
[WOMAN] She's
frightening.

364
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,666
[WOMAN] I don't know
what Ruko's thinking.

365
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,958
There's something...

366
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:35,458
...scary about her.

367
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:36,250
[RUKO gasps]

368
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:37,958
That's not true!

369
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:41,375
[door opens]

370
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:42,833
Hey!

371
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,125
[GIRL G] Ru-ru...

372
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:53,166
Come out and play.

00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,625
[GIRL G laughs]

374
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:58,500
[GIRL G] Guess who's here?

375
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,083
[AKIRA] Whoa, awesome-sauce!

376
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,208
Ladies! Thank you so much!

377
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,083
You asked and
we delivered!

378
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:06,375
You are the best! Up top!

379
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:07,208
[GIRLS giggle]

00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,666
[AKIRA] Well, Ru-ru! Let's go!

00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,958
[GIRLS groan]

383
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:15,875
Um, Akira?
What about us?

384
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,208
Yeah I've got a shoot. Get lost.

385
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,541
[gasps]

386
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:23,500
But, I thought you said we
could hang out with you.

387
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:26,833
A top model like me hanging
with a bunch of uggos?

388
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,375
Not likely.

389
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:31,291
[GIRLS whimper]

390
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:38,875
[AKIRA giggles]

391
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:41,083
No one's gonna bother
us in here, Ru-ru!

392
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,791
So you ready to
throw down, or what?

393
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,500
[AKIRA giggles]

394
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:49,750
[RUKO] This is it. I'm
gonna play against Akira.

395
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,041

[AKIRA growls]

397
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:56,875
[IONA] Hey.

398
00:19:56,958 --> 00:20:00,041
If you're lookin' for a
battle, give me a shot.

399
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:05,958
[RUKO] That's-!

400
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:09,583
Dammit! You skank-ass ho, stop
trying to steal my opponents!

401
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,083
You misunderstand,
I'm challenging you.

402
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:14,541
What?!

403
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:17,583
It seems you only like
to prey on rookies.

404
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,333
Guess you're just
scared of me.

405
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,000
[AKIRA growls]

406
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:25,000
[STAFF WOMAN] Akira! I've
been looking all over for you.

407
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,666
Come on, you're up.

408
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,416
[AKIRA] No, wait, I, um...

409
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,166
I need a few minutes! Okay?

410
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,416
We don't have a few minutes!

411
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,958
[AKIRA] No, stop shoving!

412
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:34,541
[STAFF WOMAN] We've got a
whole crew waiting on you,

413
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,000
so get the lead out!

414
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,291
[RUKO sighs]

415
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:47,166
Um. Thanks for
that great fake-out.

416
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,875
What fake-out? I was serious.

417
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,375
[RUKO gasps]

418
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,166
You wanted to have a
battle, didn't you?

419
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,416
[RUKO gasps]

420
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,416
[IONA] Perhaps you had
a grudge with Akira?

421
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:02,458
No wait. That's not it.
You'll battle anybody.

422
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:06,625
Anything to get
your fix. Am I right?

423
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:16,916
I am right.

424
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,541
So battle me.

425
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,125
Wait a minute.

426
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:31,125
[IONA] You have no wish.

427
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,583
[RUKO gasps]

428
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,166
[IONA] Participating as a
Selector without having a wish

429
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,333
is more than just wrong.

430
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:48,958
It's blasphemy.

431
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,708
That won't go unpunished.

432
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:52,166
Wait.

433
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:01,083
[RUKO] Blasphemy?

434
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:34,125
[RUKO] A WIXOSS party?

435
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:36,333
[YUZUKI] I might even find
another Selector to battle!

436
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:38,416
[HITOE] All this time,
I never noticed.

437
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,000
[YUZUKI] I just can't get my
hair tied up right, that's all.

438
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:42,666
[HITOE] I don't want to hear
you talk like that ever again!

439
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,541
[RUKO] She was also
kind of scary.

440
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:45,333
[RUKO] Next time:

441
00:23:45,416 --> 00:23:46,833
"That Invalidated Vow."
