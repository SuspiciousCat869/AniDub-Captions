make your wish come true.

hurting someone else.

means hurting myself.

[SCHOOL GIRL B] Yeah, so?
WIXOSS is fun!

11
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,958
Even I bought a starter deck!

12
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:43,708
[SCHOOL GIRL 1A] I thought
it was a guy thing.

Hello, Ruko!
Welcome home!

20
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,625
Hey, Grandma!

21
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:53,041
Finally home!
'Bout time!

22
00:03:58,833 --> 00:03:59,833

--What's up, Grandma?

24
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,958
Yeah, just leave your bag
on the floor there, it's cool.

25
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,750
Well, that's that.

26
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:14,000
It's an apartment
building after all.

27
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,958
Grandma wins this round.

28

29
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:18,833
I thought it was gonna be
an office for sure!

30
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:22,666
Now I gotta clean the
bathroom for a whole week.

31
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,708
[HATSU] Either way,
one more pillar

32
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:27,541
is all they need
to finish the puzzle.

33
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,041
"Puzzle?" What do you mean?

34
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:30,875
[HATSU] Just think about how
many points they'll get when

35
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:34,500
they drop a pillar into
that alley over there!

36
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:35,958
[RUKO] Uhh...

37
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,375
Oh!

38
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,875
[HATSU] They're only one
building away from a Tetris.

39
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:52,208
[HATSU] And then the whole city
might just disappear on us.

40
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,458
Finally!

41
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:59,083
Jeez, Grandma,
these levels you make

42
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,041
are getting way
too hard for me!

43
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,458
[HATSU] Suppose I'd
better start on dinner.

44
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:04,916
Ooh, let me help you.

45
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
[HATSU] You've hardly
been home for five minutes.

46
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:09,166
Why don't you relax
a bit with your brother?

47
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,625
[RUKO groans]

48
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,666
Or maybe you can get a start
on bathroom cleaning duty.

49
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,500
Ah! Oh no!

50
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,083
Mmm... nah.

51
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,041

[RUKO] Ew! Would it kill
you to take off your socks?

55
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,250
Now it stinks in here!

56
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:28,500
Yeah?

57
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:31,000
No! You're gonna give me
the plague or something!

58
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,208
I'm gonna go
help with dinner!

[chuckles]

60
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,416
[HATSU] It's always a
party with Ayumu around.

61
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,833
[RUKO] Yeah, like the
stinkiest party ever!

62
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,458
Came all the way out
here just to hang with me?

63
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:46,958
You must really look
up to your big bro.

64
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:50,083
No way! I just came
to get some milk tea.

65
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:53,083
Only one vending machine
has my favorite.

66
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:57,375
[AYUMU] Listen. Try not to
worry Grandma so much, okay?

67
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:58,916
I'm worrying her?

68
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,458
[AYUMU] Yeah, a little.

69
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:02,500
She was telling me earlier that
you haven't made any friends

70
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,125
since you switched schools.

71
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:07,500
But, it's not like I really
need friends to be happy.

72
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:10,750
Well, you're not exactly shy,
so I'm sure you'll meet someone.

73
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:12,958
But you know how
Grandma can be.

74
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:15,208
She's always trying
to look out for us.

75
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:20,875
Here.

76
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:21,875
What's that?

77
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:23,333
Just open it!

78
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:27,083
It's this card game a
buddy from work told me about.

79
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:29,291
He said it's crazy popular
with girls your age.

80
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,125
I dunno, thought
it might be fun.

81
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:34,166
Yeah, I think I've seen some
girls in class playing this.

82
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,500
[AYUMU] Well, there you go.

83
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:36,791
Perfect.

84
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:39,750
Now you have a secret
weapon to make friends.

85
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:49,291
I... didn't realize I was
worrying Grandma so much.

86
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,750
[AYUMU] See ya!

87
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,583
[HATSU] Was it chilly out there?

88
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:12,041
Ah...

00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:21,541

Hm?

93
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:36,625
Friends or no friends.

94
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:39,750
I don't want Grandma to
worry about me all the time.

95
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:43,750
I guess it wouldn't hurt to
give this a look at least.

96
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:48,250
Let's see here, one of
the cards is called an LRIG

97
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:51,250
and works as the
player's avatar.

98

[RUKO] Do I just,
like, ask them?

167
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:20,375
[CARD GIRL] Hmm?

168
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:21,291
Oh!

169
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:22,708
I wonder if they
could hear you,

170
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,916
'cause I don't think the
other girls' cards can talk.

Um, hi?

I knew it!
You're a "Selector"!

I... don't know
that... word.

179

Ah! So I'm not crazy? You
can hear her voice, too?

180

'Course I can! Here, look.
I have an LRIG just like you.

Ahh...

182
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:52,791
[GIRL] Her name's Hanayo!

183
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,625
Now, en garde!

Perfect! We've got the
whole roof to ourselves!

186
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,583
Your card can speak.
Like, real sentences,

187
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:13,500
but mine is kinda
not quite there.

188
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:17,041
She, well, mostly just makes
these little cat noises.

189
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,625
Ruko, right? Kazuki.

190
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:21,958
That is super cool. You can
hear all the LRIG's too.

191
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,416
Huh? I still don't
get how that works.

192
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,666
Yeah, it's weird.
Only Selectors can hear 'em.

193
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,958
But it's okay, since
Yuzuki fills me in on

194
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,333
what Hanayo is saying.

195
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:32,875
That word again...

196
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:36,125
[YUZUKI] Here, let me explain...
There are some players,

197
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:38,500
specially chosen ones,
who get to compete to

198
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,291
become the "Eternal Girl".

199
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:41,958
Wait. Compete for what?

200
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:44,083
If you become "The Eternal
Girl", your one true wish

201
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:45,583
will be granted.

202
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,625
And you can make it happen
just by winning enough battles!

203
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:50,083
Your wish will come
true, just like magic?

204
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,750
Well, that's
what they say.

205
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:54,416
[HANAYO] That's a bit
of an oversimplification.

206
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,500
More precisely, the Eternal Girl
is someone with the power

207
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:58,916
to make dreams come true.

208
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,125
If cards can talk, then
maybe anything could happen.

209
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,458
[HANAYO] I admit, it does
sound like pure fantasy.

210
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:06,791
Granting wishes and all that.

211
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:10,625
However, these cards have
the power, without a doubt.

212
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:13,000
So long as you are able
to triumph in battle,

213
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,916
you can make
anything a reality.

214
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,541
That doesn't apply to
all players, though.

215
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:20,791
Only Selectors have
living LRIGs like me.

216
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:25,083
You are different.
You are the chosen ones.

217
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,958
Perhaps you've
noticed this yourself,

218
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,875
but several celebrities
have announced

219
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,416
they're playing WIXOSS as well.

220
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,833
Since there's no easy
way to find and identify

221
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:35,000
other Selectors, it's
possible they're trying to

222
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,458
use the media to draw
out competitors.

223
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:38,875
Really?

224
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:41,791
[HANAYO] There is one
last thing you must know.

225
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:44,791
If you lose three battles,
you also lose your right

226
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:45,958
to be a Selector.

227
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,500
How is that?

228
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:50,625
[HANAYO] The moment you lose
your 3rd battle, we disappear.

229
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:53,625
Needless to say, no
wishes will be granted.

230
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,625
And even if you picked
up the cards again.

231
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,666
Your life would
never be the same.

232
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,125
Cool story, Hanayo.
Thanks a bunch.

233
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:02,041

don't need one to battle!

out the name of your LRIG,

then launch your attack.

00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,833
That was weird.
What do you think?

321
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:19,291
Huh, Tama?

322
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:25,833
Aww... She's been out cold
since the battle ended.

323
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:28,458
She really is super
cute, isn't she?

324
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,083
Well, most of the time.

325
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:36,333
[RUKO gasps]

326
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,250
[YUZUKI] They use up all
of their power in battle.

327
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:42,500
Ahh...?

328
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,125
[YUZUKI] When it's over,
they usually just sleep.

329
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,625
Hanayo's the same.

330
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:53,208
[RUKO] Oh. I see. So, uh...
Kazuki's not with you anymore?

331
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:54,625
[YUZUKI] Just because
we're twins, doesn't mean

332
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:57,666
we're connected at the hip.

333
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,083
Listen. Could you not
tell anyone about what

334
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:01,333
Hanayo said earlier?

335
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:02,500
[RUKO] Said about what?

336
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:03,666
[YUZUKI] You trying
to make fun of me?!

337
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:07,041
I, uh, really don't
know what you mean!

338
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,500
[YUZUKI] Uhh...

339
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:15,875
Hey, uh... If you're not
too busy, you wanna hang out?

340
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:22,041
Oh, Ru, you're home.
And you brought a friend.

341
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,375
Hi! Nice to meet you!

342
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,291
You don't mind if we
hang out here, do you?

343
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:30,500
[HATSU] Of course not. In fact,
I need to step out for a bit.

344
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,250
Help yourselves
to rice crackers!

345
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:40,416
[YUZUKI] Well, don't I feel
dumb?! Heh! S'funny!

346
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,833
I thought you must've heard
what she said for sure!

347
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:45,541
No. I don't think I did.

348
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,458
[YUZUKI] I was flipping
out over nothing!

349
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:51,625
Totally. I'm guessing it
was your wish Hanayo said?

350
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:54,041
Sorry. Bein' nosey.

351
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,541
[YUZUKI] Yeah...

352
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,416
It's something I want to
come true, no matter what.

353
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,000
But it's not the kind of
wish someone can make happen,

354
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:05,625
like with a bunch of
hard work or whatever.

355
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,333
That's all I'll say.

356
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:08,875
I understand.

357
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,750
[YUZUKI] I had given up, of
course, but when I met Hanayo

358
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:14,833
and become a Selector, she
told me that even miracles

359
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,541
aren't beyond my reach.

360
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,250
And I wanna
believe her.

361
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:21,291
I want to believe that I can win
and become the Eternal Girl.

362
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,458
To have the power to
make my wish come true.

363
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:27,041
And all you have
to do is win, huh?

364
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,125
Well, okay then, let's
have a card battle!

365
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,333
Only this time I'll
lose on purpose, cool?

366
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:35,000
I'm not interested in this
"Eternal Girl" thing anyways.

367
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:36,958
No thanks. I'll pass.

368
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:40,083
If Kazuki ends up hating
me, then there's no point.

369
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:42,000
It defeats the
purpose of my wish.

370
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,791
Hm? What
does that mean?

371
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:47,291
Nothing.

372
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,458
[HATSU] Tea time, ladies!

373
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:50,916
Back already?

374
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,500
[HATSU] Rice crackers are a
sorry snack for you girls,

375
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,916
so I picked up something
a little more tasty.

376
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,083
[RUKO] Ooh! Treats!

377
00:20:57,166 --> 00:21:00,291
Wow, cake, n' macarons.
And Bavarian cream.

378
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:03,916
Grandma, this is nuts. There's
no way we can eat all this--

379
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,375
Thanks a bunch!

380
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,333
[YUZUKI squeals]

381
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:11,458
Oh my gosh, it's so good!
All of it is just amazing!

382
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:12,958
Glad to hear it!

383
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:15,541
Why didn't you tell me you
had such a nice friend, Ru?

384
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,000
Uhh...

385
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,000
[YUZUKI groans]

386
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,500
Now I'm all recharged!
See you later!

387
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:26,958
Yeah! See ya!

388
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:33,125
[RUKO] I don't know too
much about WIXOSS yet.

389
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:36,666
And to be honest, it
all seems kinda scary.

390
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:40,416
But it's thanks to you
Grandma's so happy.

391
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,875
I'm glad I met you.

392
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:43,750
[TAMA yawns gently]

393
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:44,666
[RUKO giggles]

394
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,416
[HATSU] Ru, hon!
Dinner's ready!

395
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,791
[RUKO] Coming!

396
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:51,291
Oh, I uh, wanted to
show you something.

397
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:53,375
[HATSU] What's that?

398
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:56,833
[RUKO] Actually. Yuzuki wasn't
the only friend I made today.

399
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:59,208
There's one more...

400
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:00,708
Her name's Tama.

401
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:34,291
[GIRL] You have to battle me!

402
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:36,708
[YUZUKI] I can't
lose to her. And I won't.

403
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:38,000
[RUKO] Tama!

404
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,833
[GIRL] Have a
battle with me!

405
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:41,500
[YUZUKI] Iona Urazoe...

406
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:42,958
[GIRL] You have to!

407
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:46,916
[RUKO] Next time:
"That Poisonous Meeting."
