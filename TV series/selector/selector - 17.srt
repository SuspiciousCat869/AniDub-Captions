1
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:19,208
[MAYU]
Another wish.

2
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:21,500
Falling like
a star from the sky.

3
00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:24,333
[MAYU]
Wait.

4
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:26,166
How strange.

5
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,708
It seems that one
had escaped my notice.

6
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:36,250
[IONA] Even if I wanted to,
I could never grant Ruko's wish.

7
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:38,333
Releasing all of
the LRIGs from their cards

8
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:40,083
simply isn't possible.

9
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:44,041
And if I can't grant the wish,
that means Tama couldn't either.

10
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:45,791
But Ru still believes.

11
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:47,541
She still persists.

12
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:51,416
[RUKO]
Hello?

13
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,041
Sorry we kind of
just let ourselves in.

14
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:55,500
Are you...?

15
00:00:58,291 --> 00:00:59,666
[ALL gasp]

16
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,166
[RUKO] So, you're the one
who wrote the novel?

17
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,041
[FUMIO]
As I said.

18
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:39,041
I'm Fumio Futase.

19
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:42,416
That's crazy. I didn't
realize you were so young.

20
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,750
You're in high school?

21
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:45,000
And you're published?

22
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:47,750
[YUZUKI] Yeah, that's a
Fujikou High uniform.

23
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:50,416
I wonder if anybody knows.

24
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,000
[FUMIO]
Hmph.

25
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:54,666
Cutting to the chase, which one
of you wants to battle first?

26
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,791
Then you are one!

27
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,375
A Selector!

28
00:02:57,458 --> 00:03:00,208
I would be delighted to meet any
of you on the stage of battle.

29
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:02,125
[gasps]

30
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:04,500
A high school author Selector,
rockin' a bad girl haircut?!

31
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:06,833
Now that is the most
awesome character ever!

32
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:09,375
I'm transforming into
Burning Chorizo mode!

33
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,416
I think there's been a
misunderstanding.

34
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,000
We didn't come here
to battle you.

35
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:15,000
[FUMIO]
Is that so?

36
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,833
Excuse me for
being presumptuous,

37
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:19,916
but what other reason could
Selectors have to meet up?

38
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,291
[YUZUKI]
Just because we're Selectors

39
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:23,208
doesn't mean we have to battle.

40
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:26,208
And now I'm beginning to
think you're mocking me.

41
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,833
You're saying none of you
have a wish worth fighting for?

42
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:31,625
Even if you win,
they don't come true.

43
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:34,291
Not how you'd think, at least.

44
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:37,125
If you'll let us tell you
the truth about this, Fumio,

45
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:38,791
I think you might
change your mind.

46
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,166
Spreading the
noble truth? I see!

47
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,583
You're an LRIG--Don't
act like you don't know!

48
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:46,416
Yes. I am frightfully
well-informed.

49
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,666
And I'm not
the only one, either.

50
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,708
Let me be frank:

51
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:53,125
This "hidden truth"
behind our wishes?

52
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:55,208
I know exactly what happens.

53
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:57,125
And it still doesn't
change my opinion.

54
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:59,250
[RUKO]
What...?

55
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,708
[URITH (I) "She is
the ruler of White Garden.

58

The truth lingers on
her lips, revealing the laws

59
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,125

Say.

62
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,958
How much do you think
this author really knows?

63
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:18,750
[TAMA groans]

64
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:22,458
Heh. Aren't you just
a barrel of laughs?

65
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,791
Ru...

66
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:27,666
No... that doesn't make sense.

67
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,875
[ANN] Even if she knows
the same facts,

68
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,458
that doesn't mean
she has to come

69
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,375
to the same conclusion as you.

70
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:35,666
[FUMIO]
Yes, it's all quite cruel.

71
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:40,291
If a Selector loses three times,
her wish becomes tainted.

72
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:42,958
But if she manages to
win enough battles,

73
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,916
it only serves to grant
freedom to her LRIG.

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,291
Not truly free though,

75
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,708
the LRIG must now grant
her former Selector's wish.

76
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:53,500
That Selector, meanwhile,
becomes imprisoned as an LRIG.

77
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:54,500
Anything I missed?

78
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:55,750
[YUZUKI gasps]

79
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,750
If you know all that,
then why keep battling?!

80
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:00,791
Yeah! No good can
ever come of this!

81
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,583
[FUMIO]
Interesting.

82
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:04,666
You're among a chosen few,

83
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,750
yet you deny your very
existence as Selectors.

84
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:10,375
I'll admit, that's
a new one for me.

85
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:13,625
Plenty of Selectors have
approached me, by the way.

86
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:15,833
All of 'em dying to battle.

87
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,166
And after reading my novel,
how could they resist?

88
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,791
[YUZUKI]
What do you expect?

89
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:21,375
That's because they
read your novel!

90
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:23,875
Fumio, we don't want to fight.

91
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:26,958
But I do think you know
something about WIXOSS

92
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:29,750
that we don't, and I'd
like to hear what that is.

Obtaining knowledge.

94
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,125
That's your wish then,
in a sense?

95
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:36,291
Huh?

96
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:39,125
[FUMIO] You're a Selector,
so act like one.

97
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:40,750
Battle me for your wish.

98
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:44,166
If you win, I'll tell you
everything you wanna know.

99
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,708
[HITOE]
I dunno, Ruko.

00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,125
Nothing's ever free.

101
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:50,041
If it is worthwhile, there
is always struggle for it.

102
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:54,041
However, I shall warn you
that Fumio has never lost once.

107

00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,166
[FUMIO]
That LRIG isn't normal.

162
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,083
[ANN] As usual,
you're quick to catch on.

163
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:12,708
Just as I thought.

164
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:14,625
I can't put my finger on it.

165
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:17,291
But somehow, she's
different than me.

166
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:19,041
--[FUMIO] Hmm...
--[ANN] Still...

167
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:21,833
She doesn't seem to get along
with her Selector at all.

168
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,708
Whatever power they
possess is wasted.

169
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:26,333
[FUMIO] Then let's see if
we can force it out of them.

170
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:30,541
[gasps]

171
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:33,333
[IONA grunts]

172
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:41,250
[panting]

173
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,916
[RUKO]
I'm-I'm gonna lose.

174
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,125
She's not just strong, she's
always one step ahead of us.

175
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,833
I don't know what
I'm supposed to do.

176
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:52,833
[IONA] Well, for starters, why
don't you stop cowering in fear?

177
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:56,166
[gasps] That's not
what I'm doing at all!

178
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,708
[IONA] Before, you had
a hunger for battle.

179
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:01,208
You had the conviction
to tear down any wall,

180
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,416
to defy any limit.

181
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,541
Um...

182
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:04,416
That's not true...

183
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,458
You wanna save your friends?

184
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,875
Right now, you don't have
the strength to save anyone.

185
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,208
[gasps]

186
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:11,791
[IONA]
Not Yuzuki,

187
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:14,666
and certainly not all the other
girls transformed into LRIGs.

188
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,125
[RUKO]
I'll find a way!

189
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:20,083
I have to, somehow.

190
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:23,125
No one should have to
suffer like Hitoe did.

191
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:26,875
Having such an innocent wish
twisted into something so cruel.

192
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:29,166
Or Yuzuki, who fought and fought

193
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,458
only to have her whole
life taken from her.

194
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:34,291
I don't care what it takes!

195
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:37,208
I'll find a way to end
this game, no matter what!

196
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,666
Now Grow!

197
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:42,083
Just 'cause you say it,
doesn't make it true.

198
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,250
[gasps]

199
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,083
It infuriates me that
I lost to someone

200
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:47,416
who spews such
idealistic nonsense.

201
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,583
That I lost to an utter fool,
who'd naïvely help others

202
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,208
before herself.

203
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:55,333
That I lost to someone
so disgustingly pure.

204
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:56,375
[IONA sighs]

205
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:57,500
I didn't mean to--

206
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,875
[IONA]
You have to find yourself again!

207
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:02,416
I became your LRIG
because I b elieved in you--

208
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,208
Because I knew you were strong!

209
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:05,958
So find that strength!

210
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:08,750
The strength you had
when you were with Tama!

211
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:11,833
Or else, she'll be one more
friend you fail to save!

212
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:13,291
[gasps]

213
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,875
[RUKO]
Tama...

214
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,833
[RUKO]
That's right.

215
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:27,041
I have a wish
worth fighting for,

216
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,958
and I don't care if
I have to play this game

217
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:30,125
to make it happen.

218
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:32,041
I don't care what I have to do.

219
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,416
I'll save my friends!

220
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,583
[FUMIO] I know this sounds
ironic coming from me,

221
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,125
but this isn't a novel.

222
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:39,833
Let's not get carried away.

223
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,791
Just because you have
a character moment,

224
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:42,416
doesn't mean that you'll win.

225
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,125
[ANN]
Haa...

226
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,583
[ANN grunts]

227
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,250
[FUMIO]
Hmph.

228
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,541
I can't lose here.

229
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:54,000
I won't back down ever again!

230
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:56,875
[RUKO]
Iona, Grow!

231
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:57,708
--You're kidding.
--[ANN gasps]

232
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,000
No way!

233
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,875
She's at level four already!

234
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:02,666
That's as high as it goes!

235
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:07,250
What is she... doing?

236
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,166
[FUMIO]
What the--?

237
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,875
I've never seen anything
like this before.

238
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:24,208
[IONA]
This is it. Ruko's power.

239
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:26,416
This is what Tama felt.

240
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,875
What she believed in.

241
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,916
[ANN]
That's not fair!

242
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,333
How did you do that?!
Nobody can even do that!

243
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:35,083
There is no level 5!

244
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:38,583
Oh, wow! Yes! It's on now!

245
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,916
A forbidden power that
awakens when the hero

246
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,458
is backed into a corner!

247
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:45,625
Super exciting and super cliché!

248
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,916
[YUZUKI] Looks like Ruko's
finally having fun again!

249
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,333
[HITOE]
Mm-hmm!

250
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:51,375
Even though it took a Battle,
I'm still happy for her.

251
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:53,250
[YUZUKI]
Whatever works, right?

00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,208
Any chance...

254
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:59,083
...I could ask...
to give me an encore...?

Sorry, show's over.

I gave it my best...

00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:15,708
I'm sorry...

00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:19,041
No. It's fine.

Thank you for what
you said, Iona.

261
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:25,083
And the whole transforming
thing was pretty awesome, too.

262
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,583
[IONA]
Why?

263
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:29,541
Why did I tell her that?

264
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,875
[RUKO giggles]

265
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:37,458
Well, I certainly
wasn't expecting that.

266
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:38,833
Your LRIG's strange.

267
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:40,625
[RUKO]
Huh?

268
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,875
So, tell me, Iona, was it?

269
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:45,125
How much do you know about Mayu?

270
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,625
Here it comes!

271
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,666
Just so we're clear,
I wasn't the one

272
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,166
who told Fumio
about Mayu, you know.

273
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,125
She knew before we even met,

274
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:56,250
about her and the room
and everything else.

275
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:57,375
[CHIYORI]
Huh?!

276
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:58,458
[RUKO]
But how?

277
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:01,125
I wasn't always Fumio Futase.

278
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:02,291
Before this...

279
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:03,375
...I was an LRIG.

280
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:04,833
[ALL gasp]

281
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,833
You... used to be an LRIG?

282
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,333
[YUZUKI]
But you became a human.

283
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:14,750
You won the game.

284
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,666
Why would you wanna
be a Selector?

285
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,125
Is there something
we don't know?

286
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,666
It was for her, my Selector.

287
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:26,541
[FUMIO]
I did it to fulfill her wish.

288
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:30,291
[FUMIO]
And Fumio isn't my name.

289
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:31,416
It's hers.

290
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:35,000
But all of you know
how that works.

291
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,166
Although we are apart now,

292
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,291
we are as bound by her
wish as the day we met.

293
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:43,583
[FUMIO (ORIGINAL)]
You can... move around?

294
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,416
[LRIG] You're watching me
do it, aren't you?

295
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,916
And you can talk, too--
just like a real girl.

296
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,458
[LRIG]
Kinda goes without saying.

297
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:50,875
[FUMIO (ORIGINAL)]
Huh...?

298
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,166
[LRIG]
Actually.

299
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,041
You don't seem too surprised.

300
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,416
You're more like "Oh, hey,
it's a talking card,

301
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,000
don't see that
every day, huh?"

302
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:01,583
[FUMIO (ORIGINAL)] Hmph.
I read a lot of fantasy books.

303
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,875
Maybe I've been conditioned.

304
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,041
[LRIG]
Hmm...

305
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,625
I guess I still need
to introduce myself.

306
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:09,375
You can call me Fumio.

307
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:10,333
What's your name?

308
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,333
[LRIG]
I can't really remember.

309
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:14,291
Call me whatever you want.

310
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,666
I see.

311
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,250
Then from now on,
your name's "Futase."

312
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:22,791
[FUMIO]
Whoever I was before was lost.

313
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:25,958
For me, this was a new name
and a new beginning.

314
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:40,833
[FUTASE] You click and click and
click on that thing every day.

315
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,958
Is it really that much fun?

316
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:46,166
[FUMIO (ORIGINAL) sighs]
Not really...

317
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,208
Not right now at least.

318
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:51,083
The story isn't coming together,
