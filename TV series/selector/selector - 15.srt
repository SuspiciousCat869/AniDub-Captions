1
00:00:10,541 --> 00:00:12,750
[RUKO]
I'm serious!

2
00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:14,458
I wasn't going easy on her--

3
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:16,708
Everything felt
wrong that time!

4
00:00:16,791 --> 00:00:18,666
[RUKO sniffs]

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,125
[IONA]
I see.

6
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:26,291
[TAMA cries]

7
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:28,166
[MAYU]
Why are you crying?

8
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:33,208
[crying continues]

9
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:39,041
[MAYU] Are you thinking
about your friends?

10
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:40,500
[gasps]

11
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:46,375
Or more specifically...

12
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:47,291
...about Ru?

13
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:48,750
[TAMA]
Huh...?

14
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:31,500
[GIRL C pants]

15
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:32,541
Seriously?

16
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:33,958
Yeah, isn't it
the creepiest thing

17
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:35,708
--you've ever heard?
--[GIRL C] They're coming!

18
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:36,666
You see there?

19
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,333
Look, what did I tell you?

20
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:44,833
[BOY A] Whoa, so it
really is true, huh?

21
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,208
--[GIRL D] Seriously?
--[GIRL E] Yeah!

22
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:51,666
Akira's on the cover!

23
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,125
[GIRL F]
What, where?!

24
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:57,291
[GIRL E] Ugh! Do those
two have, like, zero shame?

25
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:58,708
[GIRL F]
I know!

26
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:00,958
They were walking side by
side like it was nothing.

27
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,416
[GIRL G]
The Kurebayashi twins?

28
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,000
Is that who you mean?

29
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,166
[GIRL E] Yeah, the two who are
always eating lunch together.

30
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,791
[GIRL F]
On the rooftop, by themselves.

31
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:12,041
But, come on, is it really true?
They are brother and sister.

32
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,916
Maybe those two
are just really close.

33
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,958
[GIRL E]
Too close if you ask me!

34
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,708
[KAZUKI]
Well, see you later.

35
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:23,541
[gasps]

36
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,000
[HANAYO (Y)]
Yup.

37
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:34,750
[gasps]

38
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,625
Hello, Ruko. How is she?

39
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:47,375
Ah? Um. Good;
she's with Hitoe now.

40
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:49,875
But they haven't been doing
WIXOSS battles or anything.

41
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:52,000
I see.

42
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,333
But you are.

43
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,208
Aren't you?

44
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:57,250
[RUKO]
Um. Yeah...

45
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,291
Why is that?

46
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:00,958
What do you mean?

47
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:04,333
[HANAYO (Y) sighs]
Never mind.

48
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:06,250
Keep battling all you like.

49
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,333
[IONA]
She used to be an LRIG.

50
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:12,666
She knows.

51
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,750
Oh yeah, she knows
all about you.

52
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:17,666
Like just how different
you are from the other girls.

53
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,625
[YUZUKI]
What is she trying to pull?

54
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:27,958
This can't be good.

55
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:29,958
Well...

56
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:32,250
What's the matter?
You're spacing out.

57
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:36,583
[gasps] I'm a bit worried
about Ruko, that's all.

58
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:37,291
[YUZUKI]
Yeah?

59
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:38,916
It's just...

60
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,875
I got to thinking, and if what
you said about Akira is true,

61
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:45,291
she probably will
go after Ruko, and soon.

62
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,500
[IONA]
Don't be ashamed.

63
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,375
I know you want to battle.

64
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:00,833
[IONA]
I know how much you enjoyed it.

65
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:04,750
How your blood would flare
and your body would tingle.

66
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,958
I could feel your passion.

67
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:10,666
[IONA]
Is it because Tama's gone?

68
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,125
Because I'm your LRIG now?

69
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:16,083
Is it not fun anymore
because you're not with her?

70
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:19,250
Is that why you can't battle?

71
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,750
It makes no sense.

72
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:24,333
Don't you realize you're
the most powerful Selector

73
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:27,666
I've ever known? And I'm
the most powerful LRIG?

74
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,416
It's a miracle that
we've come together

75
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,875
and you're letting
it all go to waste.

76
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:34,083
[GIRL J]
What? A new pack came out?

77
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,583
[GIRL I]
Yep! I just got it yesterday!

78
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,083
[GIRL J]
Aw, can you show it to me?

79
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:38,416
[GIRL I]
Sure!

80
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,625
[IONA] That's why you're
still carrying me around.

81
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:42,166
Isn't it? You hunger for it.

82
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,416
No, I don't.

83
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,083
[IONA] Using me to
find Tama is just the lie

84
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:46,666
you're telling yourself.

85
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,041
Stop feeling guilty.

86
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:49,458
Take advantage of me.

87
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:50,416
Don't say that.

88
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,750
[IONA]
Why?

89
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,708
Take advantage of me--make
yourself feel better.

90
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,666
You want this.

91
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,291
That's not true!

92
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:04,750
[IONA]
Of course it's true.

93
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:07,041
Selectors fight to make
their wish come true.

94
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:09,916
And LRIGs fight to return
to the outside world.

95
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,708
We've always taken
advantage of each other.

96
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,500
[RUKO]
It's not always like that!

97
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,583
Hanayo's still keeping Yuzuki's
wish for her, even now!

98
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:20,208
[IONA] She wants to live in
the outside world, she has to.

99
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:21,666
That's not my point!

100
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,958
[IONA] You're saying
she wants to do it,

101
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:26,666
but how much do you really
know about her anyway?

102
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,291
[gasps]

103
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,000
You don't know anything.

104
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:32,375
Even about Tama.

105
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:33,791
But that's all right.

106
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:36,083
There's no need for you to know.

107
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:39,125
Let's just keep taking advantage
of one another, okay?

108
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:43,083
And that way, you can keep
savoring your battles.

109
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:53,333
[RUKO] I'm telling you,
that's all wrong.

110
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:57,208
I didn't care about winning
or wishes, or anything.

111
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,708
It's because I was with Tama.

112
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:01,750
I liked battling
together with her.

113
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:02,916
We were both a team!

114
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,375
What are you talking about?

115
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,125
It's not the battle
part I liked.

116
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:09,125
And it's not
the battles I miss now.

117
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,208
I liked being with Tama!

118
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:12,250
Nonsense.

119
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,583
You just can't admit
you're like me.

120
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:17,416
You're only making excuses for
your own desire to battle.

121
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,125
I just want Tama back!

122
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:22,166
Iona.

123
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,666
You promise you
don't know anything

124
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,083
about what happened to her?

125
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:28,208
I'm begging you,
if you have even one clue.

126
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:29,875
I'll do anything
to get her back!

127
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:31,583
And I don't care what it takes!

128
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:32,875
Do you know where she is?!

129
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:33,916
Where she might be?!

130
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Anything!

131
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,250
No.

132
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:40,166
[RUKO] You're not just
saying that to trick me?

133
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,000
Maybe... she's with Mayu.

134
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:44,166
[RUKO]
Huh?

135
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,375
Wait, what was that?

136
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,791
Never mind. It's nothing.

137
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:58,958
[MAYU]
Welcome back, Tama.

138
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:00,583
[TAMA]
Huh?

139
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:03,541
It would seem
you won your battle.

140
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:04,708
Uh-huh...

141
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,458
But I had to lie to Ru.

142
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:07,666
You did.

143
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,750
And I didn't even say
goodbye, either.

144
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:14,916
So now, Ru is probably
awfully sad and crying, too.

145
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,750
Yes, but Ru lied to you first.

146
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,083
Remember?

147
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,541
Huh...?

148
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:28,208
[RUKO] So, hey, I can't wait
to go shopping with you, Tama.

149
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,541
[TAMA]
Can we eat dumplings?

150
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:32,791
[RUKO] I was thinking
I'd buy you some scrunchies.

151
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,541
So you can match the rest of us.

152
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,500
[TAMA]
Ru...

153
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,208
[RUKO]
I love you.

154
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:40,958
But now, after
winning the battle,

155
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:44,125
you know... that Ru is a liar.

156
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:47,541
She abandoned you, chose her
other friends instead.

157
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,166
You're wrong!

158
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,041
Ru was trying to save Tama and
Yuzuki and Hitoe and everyone!

159
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,041
That was gonna be her wish!

160
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,875
And yet, she's given up
on all of you now.

161
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:01,583
No! It was my fault
that it all went wrong!

162

scared about how lonely

Yes...

[MAYU]
It's a frightening place.

178
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:37,000
Both your emotions and your soul

00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,125
will become
hopelessly entangled.

You will be hurt.

Everyone out there is a liar.

Pain and sorrow...

They're the only things
you can count on.

You can hear them...

The people...

187
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:54,208
They're crying...

Yeah, but some are nice,
like Ru and Grandma--

It's scary!

Don't!

195
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:07,125
I-I don't wanna
leave, Tama!

196
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:11,125
I can't ever live in that
horrible world again!

Stay here, with me, forever.

[TAMA]
I know her.

207
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,875
I remember her voice.

208
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:42,333
She's...

[TAMA]
Ma... yu...

Wow, you remembered me?

211
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:05,333
As for Ru, do you
still want to see her?

212
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:06,458
Yes.

213
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,791
Really bad.

What if I said
I won't forgive you?

00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:14,333
Then I'd say
I still wanna see her.

00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,416
I see.

217
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,375
Well.

218
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,458
I suppose I'll let you.

[HITOE]
Hold on a sec.

220
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,291
It's like we said
on the phone, Ruko.

221
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:32,166
She's up to something.

00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,333
[HANAYO (Y)]
Never mind.

223
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:36,500
Keep battling all you like.

Is that why...?

What? You know something?

Tell me.

[gasps] Um, nevermind.

Look, here it is!

231
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,083
You see now?

232
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,208
Akira's looking for Selectors!

[whines]

234
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:01,083
She's also posting
rumors on the internet.

235
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:02,750
Look at this.

[RUKO]
Wait, "mysterious LRIG cards

What could she be up to?

238
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:11,125
[HITOE] She's not just
drawing out Selectors,

239
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:14,041
she's also spreading the word
about them to everyone else.

240

[YUZUKI]
Got more fans than ever, too.

241

That's already been
retweeted over 5,000 times.

242

At this rate, she'll--

LRIG cards can speak,

00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,791
and then you can get
your wish to come true.

245
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,083
That sounds familiar.
Is it from the novel?

Even if it is, it's stupid.

No one's ever gonna believe
a crazy rumor like that.

about it on the internet.

I'm worried about.

Look, don't worry.

no one'll ever believe it.

We can't be so sure!

Okay, but what?

I don't know, but we
can't just leave this be.

259
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,750
The first thing we should do
is try to figure out

260
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:52,875
why Akira is doing this.

You have to admit,

she is... really pretty.

[YUZUKI]
Hitoe!

00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,541
We need to be planning,
not praising her looks!

Uh! Right! I'm sorry!

266
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:07,000
For some reason, she does look
a lot nicer than before, right?

267
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,000
It even seems like
her scar is gone.

268
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,583
[YUZUKI] I'm sure she just
covered it with makeup.

[HITOE]
You think?

You met with her?!

she'd go after you, Ruko.

So, did you beat Ruko or not?

so we weren't able to finish,

00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:12,875
No, she's stupid!

326
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:15,625
What possessed you
to do such a thing?!

327
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:19,166
Well, I just had a bad feeling
that if I said no to her,

328
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,250
there was a chance
that something

329
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:21,833
even worse might happen.

330
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,208
Save the lame excuses.

331
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:25,375
You just wanted to
battle her, didn't you?!

332
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:26,541
[RUKO]
Ah...?

333
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:27,708
[HITOE] Now you're
jumping to conclusions!

334
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:30,291
[YUZUKI]
Am I? Are you carrying Iona?

335
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,875
[gasps]
Uh...

336
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:38,625
Is that true?

337
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:39,708
Yeah...

338
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:42,000
Is it because you
want to find Tama?

339
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,208
Yeah.

340
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:44,291
[YUZUKI] But if you
lose Selector battles,

341
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,291
you might not get that chance!

342
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:49,916
[IONA]
How petty.

343
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,666
Your grandma would be crushed
if something happened to you.

344
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,625
[IONA]
Ridiculous.

345
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:54,083
I know that, but...

346
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:55,583
[IONA]
She's not like you.

347
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:58,583
We said we'd work
together to find Tama, remember?

348
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:03,916
[IONA] Ruko only truly enjoys
life when she's in battle.

349
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,625
[YUZUKI] And that you
didn't have to shoulder

350
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:07,458
this responsibility on your own.

351
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:08,833
[IONA]
She's like me.

352
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,375
We should be working together.

353
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:12,166
Fighting together.

354
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,166
[RUKO]
It's because I was with Tama.

355
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,750
[IONA]
They're misleading her.

356
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:19,458
They're the reason
Ruko is like this.

357
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:24,125
It's okay, we understand.
We feel the same way you do.

358
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:25,416
What?

359
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,708
You know that special
way you feel about Tama?

360
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:32,625
Well, Hitoe and I, we feel
the same way about you.

361
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:34,250
We do.

362
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:36,583
And if you disappeared
the same way Tama did,

363
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:38,958
we'd be just as
upset as you are.

364
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,666
Yuzuki...

365
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,166
You know what?

366
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,291
When you won that battle with
Iona, I got really scared.

367
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:49,166
I thought at first that we
might not ever see you again.

368
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,083
And I was really worried
that you were going to be

369
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,833
transformed into an LRIG.

370
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:56,916
Or, in the worst case, you
might even disappear forever.

371
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,625
[RUKO]
Hitoe...

372
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:01,250
[HITOE] We know you
wanted to sacrifice yourself,

373
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,583
for Tama and for all the
other Selectors and LRIGs

374
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,083
who are suffering.

375
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:08,041
Yeah, but Hitoe, you would do
the same thing for Yuzuki.

376
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:11,791
I would've done anything,
no matter what happened to me,

377
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,083
because we're friends.

378
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:14,708
But that's wrong.

379
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:16,416
That's not the way
friendship works!

380
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,000
[gasps]

381
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:20,875
I finally got it when I thought
you were gonna disappear.

382
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,458
Just think.

383
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,000
If you were gone,
I wouldn't be happy.

384
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:27,208
What if you had
sacrificed yourself?

385
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:29,750
Even if it did go
like you planned.

386
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:31,291
Maybe I could have
had a normal life,

387
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:32,958
been able to
talk to Yuzuki,

388
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:34,541
possibly even make
some other friends.

389
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:37,166
But still, don't you understand?

390
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,625
[HITOE sobs]

391
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,666
If you weren't there to
share those things with me,

392
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:45,000
well then, it wouldn't
be any fun at all.

393
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,750
Hitoe...

394
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,000
The thing is...

395
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:53,083
...we talked after your battle.

396
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,958
We talked about sacrificing
ourselves for others,

397
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,875
and agreed to stop
doing stuff like that

398
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:01,166
'cause it's not necessary.

399
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,083
We'll always be together.

400
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,708
So if we suffer,
at least we're not alone.

401
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:08,458
If we're sad, we'll
still have each other.

402
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:11,500
So this is what we'll do,
for as long as we know.

403
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,333
Hitoe...

404
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:14,791
Yuzuki...

405
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:20,291
I was... just trying
to get Tama back.

406
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:23,250
I had no idea how much
I upset you two.

407
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:25,083
So...

408
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,000
Sorry...

409
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,666
I mean that.

410
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,583
And... I won't
do it again, okay?

411
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:34,291
No more battles
on my own, I promise.

412
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,041
But still...

413
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,208
I can't!

414
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:38,333
We understand.

415
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:40,291
It's all for Tama, right?

416
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,833
And to prevent anyone else from
going through all the suffering

417
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:44,166
we've gone through.

418
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,750
So, if you have to battle,
to stand up for them...

419
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,041
...we won't stop you.

420
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:50,500
Just be sure you
tell us first, okay?

421
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:54,291
Thank you both, so much.

made us hungry, huh?

you're not one of them?

And, y'know, snack away,
because it's not like I can!

Can you smell stuff at least?

just for you, Ruko.

do LRIGs ever get hungry?
