Wha--

2
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:29,041
It's Tama?

3
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:08,250
What's happening?

4
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:09,666
It's really Tama.

5
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,416
[YUZUKI]
But why?

6
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,916
So that's how it is, huh?

7
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,583
She's here.

8
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:17,083
And she's safe.

9
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:18,875
I was afraid I'd lost her.

10
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:20,333
Hey, Tama!

11
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,708
But why... did she
change Selectors?

12
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:28,750
[YUZUKI]
That's only half of the problem.

13
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:31,875
I'm wondering why Urith
is even battling.

14
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:33,750
She's supposed to be
carrying out your wish

15
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:35,750
right now, isn't she?

16
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:38,291
Well, she's not
breaking any rules.

17
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:42,458
Besides, to a certain extent, my
wish has already been granted.

18
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:44,708
But what does she have
to gain from fighting?

19
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:45,875
[YUZUKI]
Spill it.

20
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,541
There's something
you're not telling us.

21
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:50,000
About Urith and about Tama.

22
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:51,083
You're wrong.

23
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:53,208
I wish I knew.

24
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:55,500
But I don't.

25
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:57,333
That's just like her.

26
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:59,166
Tasteless and cruel.

27
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:02,916
[MAYU]
Poor little Tama.

28
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,541
It's a frightening
world out there.

29

You're only going
to be hurt again.

30

humiliate us too badly.

Tama! Don't do it!

37
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,208
I'm going to have to ask you
to stop distracting my LRIG.

38
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:29,416
The only one she
needs to talk to is me.

You're gonna blow me up!

I mean, unless
I blow you up first!

[YUZUKI] I think Chiyori's
as good as done for.

57
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:08,583
This is wrong.

58

No, Tama! Stop it!

Huh. It's all right--
you don't have

61
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:16,708
to listen to her anymore.

62
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:19,083
She threw you away, remember?

[TAMA gasps]
She did not!

I fought for this, Ru.

I'd given up any hope
of coming back.

fight each other,

00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,125

[CHIYORI sighs]

169
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:56,750
Tama?

170
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:58,833
[TAMA whimpers]

171
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,291
Listen.

172
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,000
[YUZUKI]
Hey, hold on!

173
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,083
Urith!

174
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:05,541
Give her back!

175
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,708
[URITH (I)]
If you want her that bad,

176
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:10,666
why don't you battle me for her?

177
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,500
[RUKO gasps]

178
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:12,875
[TAMA]
No!

179
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:16,333
Ru, you don't have to battle!
She can't make you!

180
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,250
[URITH (I)]
Hmph. No rush though,

181
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,375
you come find me when
you're good and ready.

182
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:25,583
Work on her for me, Iona.

183
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:28,208
Till next time,
Miss Pain-in-the-Ass.

184
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:34,750
Tama!

185
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:40,750
[TAMA whimpers]
Ru...

186
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:50,583
[HITOE]
Don't worry. We can fix this.

187
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,291
[RUKO]
Yeah. Thanks.

188
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,208
At least I know Tama's okay.

189
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:57,166
Not only that, it seems like
she feels the same way I do.

190
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,791
Anyway, thanks for
sticking with me

191
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,458
through all this mess, you guys.

192
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,708
[CHIYORI]
Nice job on that plot twist!

193
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:10,458
A tragedy among friends
and a rival for me! Ooh!

194
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:12,708
You gotta admit,
that was pretty sweet!

195
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:13,916
Hello, Chiyori.

196
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,208
[YUZUKI]
You're still here?

197
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,333
You guys should be way
more pumped about this!

198
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:20,041
Seriously, Eldora,
what the hell?!

199
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:22,791
[HITOE] Why would you
do that after we told you

200
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:24,791
how dangerous Battles were?

201
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,041
Do you even care what
happens to Chiyori?

202
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,416
Gimme a break!

203
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,708
Both of us spent a long time
working all this out.

204
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,125
She can be pretty
stubborn, though.

205
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:34,958
[CHIYORI]
Let's see.

206
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,750
Here it is!

207
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,250
Wa-pa-pow!

208
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:40,833
[BOTH]
Huh?

209
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:42,208
What is that?

210
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:45,375
[CHIYORI]
Chorizo De Ibéricoña The Second!

211
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,625
Oh, I think I've
eaten chorizo before,

212
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:50,958
but what does sausage
have to do with this?

213
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:54,000
Nothing--it's the name I'm gonna
have when I turn into an LRIG!

214
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:54,750
[HITOE, RUKO]
Huh?

215
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:55,958
There you have it.

216
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:57,958
There is no talking
sense into this girl.

217
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,541
But wait...

218
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:03,666
You lost your first match to me,
and now your second to Urith?

219
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,500
You're already down
to your last one?

220
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:06,583
[YUZUKI]
You gotta stop!

221
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,833
No way!

222
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:09,750
Sure, I lost a couple,
but I won three already!

223
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:12,291
That means my wish could
come true at any time!

224
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,875
Yeah, but if you
lose one more time,

225
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:15,791
that wish is gonna be corrupted!

226
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,916
The main character in
the novel lost twice too,

227
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,041
but she didn't give up.

228
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,625
She beat her rival
and got her wish!

229
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:24,541
She passes out, then finds
herself in the White Garden

230
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,041
when she wakes up!

231
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:29,166
White Garden?

232
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,416
What is that?

233
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,916
Duh, it's the
hyper-dimensional white void?!

234
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,250
White void? Seriously?

235
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,875
That sounds suspiciously
like the white room I went to

236
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,875
when I became an LRIG.

237
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:42,041
No way!

238
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:43,708
You mean they talk
about that in the book?!

239
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,000
What?

240
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,916
I so gave you a copy
of it, you should know!

241
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You're telling me
you didn't read it?

242
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,875
I've... been
kind of busy lately.

243
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,750
This is really getting weird.

244
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,708
Hey, Chiyori?

245
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,083
Can we see that book?

246
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,833
The answers we need might be
right in front of us.

However, for that to happen,

the girls must first
battle other LRIGs,

her wish is not granted, but
instead,

[HITOE] It's just like
Yuzuki was saying.

268
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,666
That must be the white room
with the window, right?

269
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,333
[RUKO] They don't use the word
"Selector,"

270
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:06,250
but everything else here
matches up almost perfectly.

00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,375
[YUZUKI] Yeah, they barely
even spiced it up.

Ugh! And look, now the

She's the ruler

An almighty being that
holds dominion over

[YUZUKI] Is she like
the last boss or something?

[CHIYORI groans]

280
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,833
I can't believe it ends
on such a cliffhanger!

281
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:29,500
[groans] Dang it! The suspense!

282
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:30,833
It's killing me!

00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:32,375
Yeah, that's, uh...

That's her!

All right, then.

We've got ourselves a lead!

292
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,166
The next step is to find her.

293
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,250
[HITOE]
Fumio Futase.

294
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:54,875
She got her start by posting
stories on the internet.

295
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,000
I guess it was like
fan fiction at first,

296
00:13:57,083 --> 00:14:00,500
but some editor liked the story,
and it became official canon.

297
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:03,541
[YUZUKI] Any information on when
the third book is coming out?

298
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,291
They say it's on hold.

299
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,875
You think she's
a Selector like us?

300
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,375
Maybe.

301
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:14,041
But then it seems strange
that she would glamorize this.

302
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,541
[YUZUKI]
Mm-hmm.

303
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,875
Especially if she's heard about
Mayu and that White Room.

304
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,916
That means she also knows
how dangerous it is

305
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,958
to keep having Battles.

306
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,916
We need to find
some way to meet her.

307
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,125
Huh?

308
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,333
I want every bit of
information she's got.

309
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:28,583
[YUZUKI]
Okay, but like, what?

310
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:31,041
She might know more about Mayu.

311
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,083
Or more about Tama.

312
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:34,791
There was something
you said before,

313
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,166
about Tama maybe being one
of the "special" ones.

314
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:37,916
[IONA]
Mm?

315
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,333
[gasps]

316
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:40,708
[MAYU] That is to say,

317
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:44,083
some Eternal Girls are more
"special" than others.

318
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:47,791
[MAYU] You may lack the power
to create this fairy tale ending

319
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:51,166
you so desire, but there is
magic yet in this world.

320
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,416
[TAMA]
Somewhere deep down.

321
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:57,166
I feel like I might know how.
Like I can help all the LRIGs.

322
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,125
Maybe turn them back to normal.

323
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,208
There's something
we still don't know.

324
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,750
Something that might
help save her.

325
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:05,583
And everyone else, I hope.

326
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:08,083
Wait a second,
where did Chiyori go?

327
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:08,791
[CHIYORI]
Yargh!

328
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:09,916
[HITOE, RUKO gasp]

329
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
[HATSU]
Too bad.

330
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:13,291
That's six wins
in a row for Grandma.

331
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:14,583
[CHIYORI groans]

332
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,416
You are too good!

333
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,791
If you can't
even win one,

334
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,083
I'll have to eat this entire
box of snacks myself.

335
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,875
[CHIYORI gasps] Could you be
the Sorceress of Blood?!

336
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:25,041
The Queen of the Innocent
and Danger Zone

337
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,083
of all WIXOSS players
in the world?!

338
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,833
[HATSU chuckles]
My goodness, perhaps I am!

339
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:32,875
How 'bout a new bet:
if you beat me, I'll tell you.

340
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:34,083
Hi, girls!

341
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,833
Would you like to join
us for a few rounds?

342
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:37,875
Uh...

343
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:38,791
Maybe later.

344
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,583
[HITOE giggles]

345
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:42,208
[HITOE]
Ooh! Yes!

346
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,625
We found it!

347
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:47,041
It's the author's website!
And she updated recently.

348
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:52,291
[HITOE]
To: Fumio Futase.

349
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:54,916
Subject: Selectors.

350
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,708
Excuse us for the sudden
E-mail. We read your book.

351
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:02,666
We'll be very up front.
We're Selectors.

352
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,541
Are you aware of Selectors?

353
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:07,000
If so, then, uhm...

354
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:10,916
Please allow us... the
opportunity to speak with you.

355
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,666
Ruko Kominato.

356
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,000
Hitoe Uemura.

357
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,750
Does that all sound good to you?

358
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,208
[RUKO]
Mm-hmm.

359
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,708
[CHIYORI]
Catch you later!

360
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:25,083
We'll give you a call
when we hear back from her!

361
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,166
You gotta come with us, okay?

362
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,666
[CHIYORI]
You bet I will!

363
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,291
[BOTH laugh]

364
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:39,166
You think... she'll respond?

365
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:43,083
Well... I hope so, since
we've got so many questions.

366
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:45,625
We still don't know what
really happened with Akira.

367
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:47,500
Or with Urith.

368
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:49,625
[RUKO]
Mm...

369
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,541
Either way, I don't think
it's a coincidence

370
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,625
that she ended up
with Tama as her LRIG.

371
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,083
Huh?

372
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:57,958
Yeah, like me and Yuzuki.

373
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:00,083
It is kinda fishy.

374
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:01,458
So yeah.

375
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:03,000
Mayu's plotting something.

376
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:06,083
Then we have to stop her.

377
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:07,500
Well, obviously.

378
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,916
But I'm just trying to figure
out why she's doing it.

379
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,166
Yeah, no kidding!

380
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,833
Does she like watching us
suffer, or what?!

381
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:14,708
[IONA] You're looking
at this all wrong.

382
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,666
Stop trying to apply
rules or logic to it.

383
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,500
Those are just a veil to
entangle players even further.

384
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:28,083
Mayu's plan isn't very complex.

385
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:30,500
All the players are her toys.

386
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:33,041
And now she's having
her way with us.

387
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:35,958
So yes, she likes watching
you suffer tremendously.

388
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:38,666
It's that simple?

389
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,708
She's made it clear
how petty she can be.

390
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:45,666
She'll just keep pushing back.
Find new ways to torment you.

391
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,875
Then that settles it.

392
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:49,666
We're gonna make her pay!

393
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:53,750
[HITOE]
We'll see you later.

394
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,125
[RUKO
'Kay.

395
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,750
[YUZUKI]
Oh. One last thing.

396
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:57,791
[RUKO]
Ah?

397
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:00,916
I know today wasn't
exactly great,

398
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,333
but on the upside, you saw Tama.

399
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,208
You two are the perfect team.

400
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:09,416
I'm sure you'll be
together again someday.

401
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,416
[HITOE] Mm-hmm! I feel like
we're making progress already,

402
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,041
so it's only a matter of time.
Just hang in there.

403
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:18,375
Oh, Hitoe. Yuzuki.

404
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:19,666
Thank you for that.

405

See ya!

Better, I hope.

Oh, yes, all thanks to you.

You're welcome here any time.

I'm so glad she has
such a good friend.

It's nothing.

00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:05,208
Ugh, I'm sorry. Go on in.

to ask for another favor.

I can't stomach that girl.

And her stupid smile.

You really think
Fumio Futase lives here?

Yeah, unless she was
lying to us in the e-mail.

I-I can't take this!

I'm so nervous, my heart's
gonna shoot into orbit!

it's hard to believe,

but she can be pretty
shy sometimes!
