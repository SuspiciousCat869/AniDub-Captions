1
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:12,291
[YUZUKI]
That was the first time.

2
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:14,583
[HANAYO] What?

3
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:17,583
[YUZUKI] I've never
told anyone how I felt.

4
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:19,583
You were the first person

5
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:22,166
I've ever been
completely honest with.

6
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:25,083
[HANAYO] Yuzuki...

7
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:30,625
[YUZUKI]
Thank you for that, Hanayo.

8
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:11,875
Ru, dear,

9
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:13,708
that's sweet of you, but you're
going to be late for school.

10
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:16,500
Huh? What time is it?

11
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:18,333
You get going,
I'll take care of the rest.

12
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:20,458
Uhh, thanks!

13
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:22,458
[HATSU chuckles]

14
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:26,708
[RUKO gasps]

15
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:39,625
Huh...?

16
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:42,625
[TAMA yawns]

17
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:44,958
[TAMA] Oh, good morning, Ru.

18
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:47,125
Hey, Tama. School time!

19
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,458
Can't I sleep just
another five minutes?

20
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:52,166
I guess, but you're
coming with either way!

21
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:15,000
[KAZUKI gasps]

22
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,875
U-Um, Yuzuki... I'm sorry!

23
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,416
[KAZUKI] I'm takin' off!

24
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:26,041
[LANDLADY]
All alone today, huh?

25
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:28,583
Where's your sister?
Shouldn't you two be together?

26
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,708
Huh?! The heck's
that supposed to mean?

27
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:33,166
[LANDLADY] Ah, kids...

28
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:45,916
[GIRL 9A] Akira's still missing?

29
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,041
Wow.

30
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,041
[GIRL 9B] Yeah, they
interviewed a girl

31
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:49,666
from her school in that article.

32
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,416
It's like she just disappeared.

33
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,708
Nobody's seen her
for almost a week.

34
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:05,458
[TAMA]
You're gonna miss the train. Ru!

35
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:06,916
[ANNOUNCER]
Now departing.

36
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,000
Yuzuki...

37
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:29,500
[RUKO] We were getting
along so well, but now...

38
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:30,416
[YUZUKI] God, I hate this--

39
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,666
We can't be friends anymore.

40
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,166
[RUKO] No, we can't.

41
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,041
She's right. 'Cause...

42
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:39,291
...I refuse to have
any more battles.

43
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:42,916
But Yuzuki won't stop battling
until her wish comes true.

44
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,500
No matter how many people
she hurts in the process.

45
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:51,375
[RUKO] But I... I
can't live like that.

46
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:57,416
[students murmuring]

47
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,708
[BOY 9A] You serious?

48
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,458
[BOY 9B] Pretty freaky, huh?

49
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:01,791
[GIRL 9C] The twins?

50
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:04,000
[GIRL 9D] Yeah, can you
believe they're a couple?

51
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,875
[BOY 9C]
Like... incest for real?

52
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,333
[GIRL 9E] No way!

53
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:11,958
[BOY 9D]
Wow, so the rumors are true?

54
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:13,708
[BOY 9E] Oh, you think
they've already done it?

55
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:14,958
[BOY 9D] Duh, what do you think?

56
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:16,375
[BOY 9E] Aw, barf!

57
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,208
[GIRL 6B]
Don't blame yourself, Honoka.

58
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:19,833
[GIRL 6A] There's no way
you could have known

59
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,041
he was like that.

60
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:22,583
[GIRL 6B] And I used
to think he was cool.

61
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,500
[GIRL 6A] He's just gross!

62
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:26,125
[gasping]

63
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:31,666
I assume you're the one
responsible for all this?

64
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,416
[GIRL 6B]
It's not her fault, jackass!

65
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,833
Yeah, people wouldn't talk

66
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,500
if you and your
sister acted normal.

67
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,125
No, jerk,
I didn't do a thing.

68
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,625
I just told a few friends
what you said to me.

69
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,791
You know, how upset you got
when you heard the rumor.

70
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,125
[GIRL 6B] Honoka was worried
about you, you jerk!

71
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,416
I really wasn't trying
to start anything...

72
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,916
Although, your sister does
act kind of weird sometimes.

73
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,250
You know, forget you. I'm done.

74
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,166
Nobody talks bad
about my sister!

[HONOKA gasps]

76
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,958
Don't act like I'm some
kinda villain! So rude!

00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,458
[GIRL 6B] Geez, you're horrible!

00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,250

[BOY 9F] Yeah, with her brother!

00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:09,375
[BOY 9G] Aw, nasty!

85
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,708
[BOY 9H] Too bad.
I thought she was hot.

86
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,708
[HANAYO (Y)] There you are.

87
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:29,916
[KAZUKI] Yuzuki.

88
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,375
So I heard you've
been telling people

89
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,750
not to talk about me.
Is that for real?

90
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,208
[KAZUKI] Yeah...

91
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,166
[HANAYO (Y)]
That's sweet of you,

92
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,583
but it's not
really necessary.

93
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,166
It's not gossip if it's true.

94
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,791
[KAZUKI] Wait a minute,
what do you mean by that?

95
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,791
I mean...

96
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,500
I'm in love with you.

97
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:50,833
Wha--?

98
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:54,541
I've been in love with you
ever since we were kids.

99
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:57,250
But I never told you before.

100
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:00,708
I didn't want to scare you
off, but I've felt this way...

101
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,833
...my entire life.

102
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:04,416
Always.

103
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,875
[FRIEND A] You've got a crush on
that cute boy Goto, don't you?

104
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,666
[FRIEND B]
Heh! Uh-huh!

105
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,375
[FRIEND C]
And you, Yuzuki?

106
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:11,875
[YUZUKI giggles]

107
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,416
[HANAYO (Y)] While my friends
were always chatting about

108
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,083
what boy they had
a crush on that week...

109
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:18,125
[FRIEND 9C]
C'mon, spill it!

110
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:19,708
[YUZUKI]
Huh?

111
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,291
[FRIEND 9A] Everyone said who
they liked! Now it's your turn.

112
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:22,916
[FRIEND 9B]
Who's your secret crush?

113
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,333
Uh... Sorry, but I don't have
one. At least not right now.

114
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,458
[FRIEND 9C]
Liar-liar, pants on fire!

115
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,875
[YUZUKI] I'm just not really
into any of the guys

116
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:32,750
in our class.

117
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:33,916
[FRIEND 9B]
You're so lying!

118
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,083
[YUZUKI] No, I'm not!

119
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,291
[FRIEND 9A]
Tell the truth!

120
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,916
[YUZUKI] I am, doofus!

121
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,416
[HANAYO (Y)] I couldn't tell
anyone how I really felt.

122
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,458
[FRIEND 9D]
So, um... your brother.

123
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:44,666
Do you know...

124
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,708
...if there's a girl he likes?

125
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:49,375
[YUZUKI] Um, well,
to tell the truth,

126
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:52,625
he's always talking about
how girls are gross.

127
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:54,250
Even when he's watching TV.

128
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,458
If like, a kissing
scene comes on,

129
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,125
he always changes the channel.

130
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:01,958
[HANAYO (Y)]
I lied to all my friends, and...

131
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:03,375
...I lied to you.

132
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,500
The one I love.

133
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:06,875
For the longest time,

134
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:09,625
I thought maybe it was
best to keep it like that.

135
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,291
[HANAYO] Are you sure?

136
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,666
Can you really live like this?

137
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,083
[YUZUKI] Yeah.

138
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:21,791
But no matter what, I will
still love Kazuki forever.

139
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:24,125
And it doesn't matter
if he finds a girlfriend,

140
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:27,416
or gets married,
or even if he has kids.

141
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,166
I'll just keep living this
lie for the rest of my life,

142
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,000
'til I'm old and alone.

143
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:35,958
If this is the only way I can
love him, so be it, I guess.

144
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,625
But then...

145
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,416
One day...

146
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:45,375
[YUZUKI] A card game?

147
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,083
[KAZUKI] Yeah, it's pretty fun.

148
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:51,500
[YUZUKI screams]

149
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:54,166
Huh? Hey, what's the matter?

150
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,625
Huh?

151
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,833
[HANAYO]
You must be my Selector!

152
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,125
Huh?

153
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,375
[HANAYO] My name's
Hanayo. Nice to meet you!

154
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:08,291
Whoa, that card
just talked to me!

155
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,333
Wait, the card did what now?

156
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:13,458
It talked. You mean,
you didn't hear?

157
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:14,250
I'm not craz--!

158
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:15,666
He can't hear me.

159
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,625
As a matter of fact,
the only ones who can

160
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,416
are Selectors like you.

161
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,875
Okay, but what have
I been selected for?

162
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,666
[YUZUKI] My wish...
can come true?

163
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,250
[HANAYO] Mm-hmm.

164
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,041
Whether you believe that or not,
though, is entirely up to you.

165
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:34,291
[HANAYO]
You do have a wish, right?

166
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:41,541
I'm stuck inside a card.
Your secret is safe with me.

167
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:44,500
I... love...

168
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:45,916
[HANAYO] What?

169
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,291
...Kazuki, I... love him.

170
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,208
O-kay. So, who?

171
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,000
Oh, wait, you mean your brother?

172
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:04,166
[YUZUKI] Yes, I love
him. I love Kazuki.

173
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,625
I love Kazuki!

174
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,541
I love my brother, okay?!

175
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:11,833
[YUZUKI sobs]

176
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:13,666
[YUZUKI] I love him...

177
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:18,916
I know. I know it's not right.
And... I know it's not normal!

178
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,833
But I still want
to be with him!

179
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:24,500
I want to spend the
rest of my life with him!

180
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:25,958
I want more than that.

181
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:29,000
I want to be
Kazuki's girlfriend!

182
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:35,541
[HANAYO] All right.
Let's make it happen.

183
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,875
And we'll do it... together.

184
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:47,166
So, then...
Your wish was for...?

185
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:52,250
[HANAYO (Y)] You once called
my strategy straightforward.

186
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:54,625
That's how I have
to be in life, too.

187
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:56,791
I have to be
straightforward with you.

188
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:59,041
The same way I was with Hanayo.

189
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,916
[YUZUKI]
That was the first time.

190
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,166
[HANAYO] What?

191
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,291
[YUZUKI] I've never
told anyone how I felt.

192
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,333
You were the
very first person...

193
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,583
...I've ever been
completely honest with.

194
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,625
[HANAYO] Yuzuki...

195
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,333
Thank you for that, Hanayo...

196
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:25,250
I didn't care what it
would take to accomplish.

197
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,791
If there was any chance
of being with you,

198
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:30,500
even if it meant me
getting hurt or dying...

199
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,833
I'd take it because I love you.

200
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,750
Do you feel the same about me?

201
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:45,750
[KAZUKI grunts]

202
00:11:57,166 --> 00:12:01,083
[BOY 9I] Kazuki? No, he
hasn't come back from lunch yet.

203
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:02,500
Oh, thanks.

204
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,791
[GIRL 6A] O-M-G! Would
you look who's here!

205
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,208
Ew, it's the "brother-lover!"

206
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:07,625
[GIRL 9G] That
is so skeevy!

207
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,666
[GIRLS giggle maliciously]

208
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,333
[trains clattering]

209
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,250
[RUKO] A wish.

210
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,125
[trains clattering]

211
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:22,666
[RUKO] One that
you want so badly

212
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:27,791
that you're willing to hurt
yourself... or someone else.

213
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,833
[YUZUKI] Next time we meet,
I'll be a new me!

214
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,583
No more regrets!

215
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:35,416
I'll finally be Kazuki's
girlfriend for real!

216
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,083
[RUKO] I tried to
stop her, but I couldn't.

217
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:40,625
She didn't care what happened.

218
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:58,666
[RUKO] I guess, since I don't
have a wish, I can't understand.

219
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,875
[IONA] But it is
the nature of battle.

220
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:02,958
And our nature as well.

221
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:04,458
Both mine...

222
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:06,250
...and yours.

223
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:11,250
I'm not... like her.

224
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,125
[TAMA] Ru?

225
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,583
[RUKO gasps]

226
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,458
You're feeling sad, huh?

227
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:19,625
[RUKO] What?

228
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,916
You know. 'Cause you
and Yuzuki and Hitoe

229
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,291
were all friends,
but now you're not?

230
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,291
Tama will still be
your friend, though!

231
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,666
Let's battle!

232
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:33,000
Well, even if we don't get
to battle, we're friends.

233
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:35,250
Forever!

234
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:36,583
Tama.

235
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:40,458
I'm sorry I like to battle
so much, but... you did.

236
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:43,625
So, I'll just stop!

237
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,333
Thank you, Tama. You rock.

238
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,125
Yep!

239
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:50,208
[TAMA giggles]

240
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:51,666
[HITOE] Excuse me.

241
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,083
[RUKO] Hitoe?

242
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:01,041
What the--? Why are you here?

243
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:03,750
Wait a minute, does this
mean you're all better now

244
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:04,583
and you remember me?

245
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:05,958
[TAMA] Ru!

246
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,250
Look, Hitoe has an LRIG!

247
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:12,250
But how?

248
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,333
[HITOE] You...

249
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,958
You're a Selector, aren't you?

250
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,041
Please let me challenge
you to a battle.

251
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,500
Wha--?

252
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:25,291
No. How are you
a Selector again?!

253
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:28,000
Battle me. Please.

254
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,625
Just say yes.

255
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,500
I can't.

256
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:34,041
No, I won't.

257
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,625
Look, I'm real sorry.

258
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:40,500
But I've decided not
to battle people ever again.

259
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:41,708
[YUZUKI] Oh, yeah?

260
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:44,041
Then why are you still
keeping Tama around?

261
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:45,583
Yuzuki?

262
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:46,875
[YUZUKI]
Guess I can't blame you.

263
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:49,833
You two are
practically best friends.

264
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:50,958
[RUKO] Where are you?

265
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,208
[YUZUKI] Speaking of friends,

266
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,916
can't you do a favor for
two of your former ones?

267
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,416
Just for old times' sake?

268
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,958
Come on! Where are you? Yuzuki?

269
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,250
[RUKO gasps]

270
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:04,708
Hmph.

271
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:11,166
Yuzuki, no!

272
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,833
Hey, hey, long time no see!

273
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,250
No, not really.

274
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,583
You're an LRIG?
This can't be real.

275
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,166
It's nuts.

276
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,041
I mean...

277
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,375
That can't be you.

278
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:28,500
It's me all right.
Here, let me prove it.

279
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:31,375
[RUKO gasps]

280
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:32,791
That scrunchie, it's--!

281
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:36,375
Yeah, the one I bought
with you two that day.

282
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,666
Guess the three of us
can't stay apart, huh?

283
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,500
Yuzuki, what... happened?

284
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,166
[YUZUKI] S'pose I owe
you an explanation,

285
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,083
and I'll be happy
to give you one.

286
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:50,416
If you agree... to
a battle with Hitoe.

287
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,875
And risk hurting her?
There's no freaking way!

288
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:55,291
You'd be doing
it to help her.

289
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,375
So her wish
can be granted.

290
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,750
And so mine can, too.

291
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,000
[HITOE] I need to fight.

If it's for my friends, I--

294
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:25,833
Fine, I'll do it.

295

All right, Yuzuki! Now
you tell me what happened!

301
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:12,000
Well, for starters,
I won my final battle.

302
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:13,166
And then...

303
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:16,250
At long last
my wish came true.

Since you've made
your decision,

let us join together
for one final attack.

Now, the oath.

Yeah.

309
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:36,750
It's, uh...

"I accept..."

"...the laws of the Selector."

00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:18,125
Then does that mean
you're not the only Yuzuki?

319
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,458
[YUZUKI] Not anymore.

320
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:25,625
[RUKO gasps]

321
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:27,250
[RUKO] So Hanayo...

322
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:28,750
...became you?

323
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:31,250
Obviously that wasn't
what I was expecting.

324
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,291
But after we finished the oath,

325
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:36,875
I found out what it really means
to become an "Eternal Girl."

326
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:39,166
My wish?

327
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,250
Now it gets granted to her.

328
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:50,708
[door opens]

329
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,333
I made this
drawing in pre-school.

330
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:07,000
The princess is
supposed to be me.

331
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:10,208
And this black scribble,
you wanna guess?

332
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,458
Uh...

333
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:16,791
It's supposed to be
of you as my prince.

334
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:20,166
This drawing is of us
on our wedding day.

335
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,708
But the other kids told
me it was dirty and wrong.

336
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,375
So I did this.

337
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:28,958
Scribbled over it,
tried to cover it up.

338
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:32,041
Again and again.

339
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:33,583
But...

340
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,333
It was still there.

341
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,000
Yeah, I get it.

342
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:43,750
Try as I might, these
feelings won't go away, either.

343
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:49,833
Yuzuki.

344
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,583
I love you.

345
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,958
And in the same way you love me.

346
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:55,750
I mean it!

347
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:58,375
I've felt this
way a long time,

348
00:19:58,458 --> 00:19:59,791
but because we're family,

349
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,750
I kept those feelings
to myself just like you.

350
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:05,416
I did my best
to block them out.

351
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,416
But to hell with that,
I can't do it anymore!

352
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,291
I love you.

353
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,375
Listen:

354
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,041
I don't care what people think.

355
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,833
Or what they say.

356
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:17,083
If it means I have to give up
anything and everything

357
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:19,416
to be with you, so be it!

358
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,333
I love you, Yuzuki!

359
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:22,500
I love you!

360
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:23,958
I swear it.

361
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,291
[HANAYO (Y)]
I love you, too, Kazuki.

362
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:30,875
So very much.

363
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:36,083
[HANAYO (Y)] I'm so happy...

364
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:38,916
The wish has
finally come true.

365
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:44,291
[RUKO] So not just your life...

366
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:48,416
she took your wish
all for herself?

367
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:55,916
[VOICE]
And now...

368
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,708
You become an LRIG.

369
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:05,791
[HITOE screams]

370
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:09,916
[HITOE sobs softly]

371
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,666
[YUZUKI] Once the
Selector is replaced,

372
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,333
they become
another person's LRIG.

373
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,458
[HITOE gasps]

374
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:27,750
Nice to meet you...

375
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,958
...Selector.

376
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,541
[YUZUKI]
So whether we win or lose,

377
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:35,666
it's the Selectors who suffer,
and the LRIGs who benefit.

378
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,583
Maybe they were fighting
to become human again

379
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,041
all along.

380
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:44,583
And yet, she did
grant my wish.

381
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:47,833
Holding up her end of this
perverse contract, I suppose.

382
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:49,583
And I became an Eternal Girl...

383
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:52,208
To repeat the cycle.

384
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:54,083
Get it now?

385
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:56,333
That's the ugly truth
behind this game!

386
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:33,500
[YUZUKI] Hanayo.

387
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:34,541
[TAMA] Stop it!

388
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:35,833
[YUZUKI] Thank you, Hanayo.

389
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:38,000
[TAMA]
My memory is still too fuzzy.

390
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,375
[YUZUKI] How could you do this?

391
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:40,958
We were friends!

392
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:42,375
[TAMA] I don't know, okay?

393
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:43,750
[YUZUKI]
She still kept her word.

394
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:44,750
[RUKO] Next time:

395
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:46,916
"That Stranded Emotion."
