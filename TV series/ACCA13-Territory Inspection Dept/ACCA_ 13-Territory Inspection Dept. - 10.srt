1
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:13,625
[FALCO] Heads up,
branch chief's making room

2
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:16,083
at the table for you tonight.

3
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:18,416
These folks do love
their games of chance.

4
00:00:20,916 --> 00:00:22,416
[FALCO]
Get ready for a long night.

5
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:27,375
[JEAN]
Huh.

6
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:29,791
Poker, I assume?

7
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:32,875
Well, of course, but
before we cut the cards...

8
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:39,041
[BACCARAT]
Yakkara's finest.

9
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,750
A token of good faith.

10
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:46,333
This district is built on
the fortunes of crazy dreamers

11
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:48,041
after all.

12
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:50,000
We like to roll the dice.

13
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:53,875
Particularly when odds
favor the dark horse.

14
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:56,125
Seems like a pretty big risk.

15
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:59,416
Go big or go home,
right, "Majesty?"

16
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:35,666
[MAUVE]
You summoned me, sir?

17
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,125
What were your thoughts
as you stood here,

18
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:46,000
speaking as Director
General for the first time?

19
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:49,208
[MAUVE] Much the same
as yours, I'd imagine.

20
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:50,458
[GROSSULAR]
Really?

21
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:53,916
For me, as I looked out
on the neat little rows

22
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,250
of district staff,

23
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:58,541
The only thing in my
head was the siren song

24
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:01,166
of unification.

25
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,500
No two uniforms were alike--

26
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,708
every branch clung to its
own notion of selfhood.

27
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,041
[LILIUM]
So disjointed.

28
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:20,291
[LILIUM]
Autonomy is the ideal, granted,

29
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,083
but can we not
celebrate our differences

30
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,500
without overemphasizing them?

31
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,333
[LILIUM] What can be
unified ought to be,

32
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,083
don't you think?

33
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,541
I feel certain our values
align on that score,

34
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,041
Chief Officer Grossular?

35
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:35,458
ACCA stands as the
nation's clearest symbol

36
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,208
of law and order.

37
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:39,750
Unification strengthens it.

38
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,375
[LILIUM]
If only certain species of rumor

39
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,875
had the decency to die.

40
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,708
About the coup?

41
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:48,041
[LILIUM] His Highness Prince
Schwan is one heartbeat away

42
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,083
from the throne.

43
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:52,541
The primal instinct of
self-preservation stirs

44
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:54,125
in every district.

45
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:58,166
Revolution is imminent.

46
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,750
Rest assured,
I for one welcome it.

47
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:05,708
Not to preserve the
districts' sense of identity,

48
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:08,083
but rather to ensure
the health of this nation

49
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,416
as a whole.

50
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,708
Something only possible
if ACCA leads the charge.

51
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:16,166
Surely a difficult feat.

52
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:19,250
I note you offer no
argument to the contrary.

53
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,541
Very interesting.

54
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:24,708
Could it be that
we're of like mind?

55
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:27,083
What would you say we
venture a small ruse?

56
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:30,375
A ruse?

57
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:33,166
Well, if it bolsters ACCA's
role as protector,

58
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,916
I can only say yes.

59
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,458
[LILIUM]
Now this may seem simplistic,

60
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:44,000
but it should prove
quite effective.

61
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,750
Can't you see eye to eye?

62
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,375
Night and day, I swear.

63
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:48,791
Perpetually at odds.

64
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:51,250
Are we never to have
a unanimous decision?

65
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:55,000
[LILIUM]
Quashing seditious rhetoric

66
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,750
would be counterproductive.

67
00:04:56,833 --> 00:05:01,416
Right now, the best course is to
focus our efforts on Inspection.

68
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,041
If Jean Otus is
in fact of royal blood,

69
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:05,666
he'll galvanize the districts.

70
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,583
Our coup will have
a standard bearer.

71
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:12,166
[LILIUM] Director General Mauve
is listening at keyholes.

72
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,875
She must be stopped.

73
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,500
[LILIUM]
Chin up.

74
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,166
You can do this.

75
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,625
I know you can.

76
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:24,791
There is no cause
for concern, my friend.

77
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,666
All will turn out for the best.

78
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,791
[MAUVE]
Forgive my insolence.

79
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,958
Are we here to talk
about the coup?

80
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:38,541
Whatever your decision in
that regard, Chief Officer,

81
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,833
I have no objection.

82
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,666
You're a decent man.

83
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,541
I know you'll work to protect
ACCA and the nation.

84
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:49,833
[MAUVE]
However...

85
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:53,916
I don't know that Otus has
been persuaded to join us yet.

86
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,375
He's a hard read.

87
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,291
[LILIUM] Thank you for
coming all this way.

88
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:04,875
ACCA will take the vanguard
in the upcoming coup d'état.

89
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:06,416
Oh?

90
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,333
[LILIUM] This country has
begun to move in the direction

91
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:10,333
of our family desires.

92
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:12,791
Let insurrection
be the proving ground.

93
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:15,166
Furawau will
consolidate its power.

94
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,458
[MOZ] Assorted cookies
from Hachikuma!

95
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:22,750
[ATRI]
That's cute.

96
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,000
I brought butter cake!

97
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:25,666
[ALL gasp, laugh]

98
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,333
Has anyone seen the chief?

99
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,333
Rain's probably holding him up.

100
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:34,291
Agent Rail.
Don'cha have a sweet tooth?

101
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:35,166
Oh, uh...

102
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,500
Here's the deal.

103
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,708
You seem like a nice guy,
so real talk for a sec.

104
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:40,125
If you wanna keep
working for ACCA,

105
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:41,958
there's no time like the
present for turning over

106
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:42,833
a new leaf.

107
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,458
No offense.

108
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:46,333
Yep, Internal Affairs
has had an eye on you

109
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:48,500
for a while.
Best clean up your act.

110
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:49,541
Of course, you know,

111
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,333
you didn't hear any
of this from us.

112
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:54,875
Hey, Lotta.

113
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,750
What do you think
of Bon's uniforms?

114
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:57,666
Cool, huh?

115
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,958
Yeah!

116
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:01,125
Especially the ones
worn by policemen, right?

117
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,666
It's got a slick design.

118
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:06,000
[ATRI] So, apropos of nothing,
is there a special someone?

119
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,000
No, not at the
moment I guess.

120
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,208
[KELI]
Did there used to be?

121
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:10,375
Details!

122
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,416
[LOTTA] Just a guy
I looked up to, sorta.

123
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,833
We weren't a thing.
He's a friend of my brother's.

124
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:16,250
[ATRI]
Ooh! Tell us more!

125
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:20,208
[RAIL] Maybe she means
that blue-haired dude.

126
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:24,791
[OWL] Yes, and somehow
I'm inclined to believe

127
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,875
that won't be the end of it.

128
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:29,333
All the more reason
for vigilance.

129
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:32,083
The royal family's
interest is unfortunate,

130
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:34,541
but don't let that affect
how you proceed.

131
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,958
[OWL]
Pranetta's next, is it?

132
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:44,458
[JEAN] Yeah, sorry, my bus
just reached the border.

133
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:48,041
So, hey, I hear you're
quite the social butterfly.

134
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,416
Yeah.

135
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,958
We were gonna barbeque
but then it decided to rain.

136
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:54,583
I hosted a dessert party
at our place instead.

137
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:56,250
[JEAN]
Nice.

138
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:59,125
It's dry as a bone out here.

139
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,583
Just be careful.

140
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,000
Always.

141
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:08,375
[LOCUSTELLA]
Deputy Chief?

142
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:09,666
Thanks for coming out.

143
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,500
[LOCUSTELLA] My uniform's
been altered to better fit

144
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:14,750
the locale.

145
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:20,208
The Branch Chief sent
me here with a message.

146
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,000
He apologizes, but there won't
be any big splashy welcome

147
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:25,208
for you the way they
do in other districts.

148
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:28,333
[LOCUSTELLA]
The District Chief agrees.

149
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:32,791
No disrespect to one
of royal blood, of course.

150
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,875
This is just how
Pranetta operates.

151
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,416
[LOCUSTELLA]
Hop on in.

152
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,791
There's water, but I recommend
you drink sparingly.

153
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:42,250
It's a precious resource.

154
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,625
[JEAN]
That's more like it.

155
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:07,041
It's a lot cooler than up top.

156
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,541
Let's drop off your
luggage before we start.

157
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:10,708
Plenty of time.

158
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,291
[JEAN]
This is it?

159
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,875
Sorry we can't provide
actual lodgings.

160
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,500
The night shift room
will have to do.

161
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,041
Should have everything you need.

162

[JEAN] Big convention
in town or something?

163

[LOCUSTELLA]
They're filming a TV show.

164
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:30,458
Cast and crew booked out
all the nearby hotels.

165
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:31,625
[JEAN]
Mmm.

166
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,375
[JEAN]
I wonder...

167

be able to follow me

168

all the way out here.

169
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,791
But he's gotta
be watching, right?

170
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:41,333
[knock, door opens]

171
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:43,875
Welcome, sir.

172
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,541
Glad to have you.

173
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:46,791
Oh, hi.

174
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,458
Right, so the reports
from yesterday

175
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,083
have all been compiled.

176
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:51,916
I'll input them shortly.

177
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,291
That'd be great, thanks.

178
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:56,625
Whaddya say we start the rounds?

179
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,916
Any thoughts on how
you'd like to do this?

180
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,416
Honestly, I don't know.

181
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,541
Maybe just do 'em in order?

182
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:03,541
Sounds good.

183
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,541
We'll go clockwise
from the north.

184
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:06,583
[JEAN]
Great.

185
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,083
[LOCUSTELLA]
You're already done?

186
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,041
Yup.

187
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:15,083
Not a whole lot of issues.

188
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:18,000
Things seem fairly
problem-free around here.

189
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:19,166
Yeah.

190
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,500
'Course, we have a
comparatively easy job.

191
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:24,708
Shouldn't take long for the
reports to be properly logged.

192
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,208
I'll head up
and send them on.

193
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:29,083
[JEAN]
Okay if I come with?

194
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:32,083
[bell chiming]

195
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:34,833
[JEAN]
Four o'clock.

196
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:37,791
Sure is handy having
those bells, huh?

197
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:41,458
Everyone'd lose track of
time down here otherwise.

198
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:44,333
Your circadian rhythms
go off the rail.

199
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,500
Takes a toll after a while.

200
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:48,875
Pranetta's a hardscrabble life.

201
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:51,083
TV's our only real pastime.

202
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,125
[JEAN]
C'mon.

203
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:54,958
Everyone romanticizes
this place.

204
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,625
Especially when
the excavation teams

205
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:57,958
hawk their wares.

206
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:00,541
People love that stuff.

207
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:03,125
If you ask me, they're
chasing after a dream.

208
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:09,791
[JEAN] Kinda sucks you can't
send reports from down here.

209
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:13,458
Seriously, why not
set up an antenna?

210
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:17,125
We would if the signal didn't
interrupt TV broadcasts.

211
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,791
Don't wanna poison the well,
if you catch my drift.

212
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,750
Folks would riot if we messed
with their only source

213
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:24,041
of entertainment.

214
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:26,541
Besides, a little exercise
never killed anyone,

215
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,125
right, sir?

216
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:30,416
When I was assigned to JumMku,
I must've put on fifty pounds.

217
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,583
Look at me now!

218
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:35,291
Maybe Agent Koruri
can be stationed here

219
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,000
after JumMku too.

220
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:38,750
Is that something you
can make happen?

221
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:42,041
I'll run it by
the Department Chief.

222
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:47,416
[HARRIER] The signal's not
bein' very cooperative today.

223
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,583
Think we should
find another spot?

224
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,875
Let's try moving further east.

225
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,666
There's a storm coming in.

226
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:05,208
[JEAN]
How can you see anything?

227
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,375
[LOCUSTELLA]
We can't.

228
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,375
Might as well eat dinner
while we wait it out,

229
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:10,791
I suppose, huh?

230
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,958
All we've got are
emergency rations.

231
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,666
Haven't had hardtack in ages.

232
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,833
[LOCUSTELLA] Sorry you
have to choke this down.

233
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:23,208
Wish we had somethin' better.

234
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:24,916
Hey, lighten up will ya?

235
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,958
It's like you're worried
about offending me or something.

236
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,833
Take it easy.

237
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,958
I'm still a person,
just like you.

238
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,458
[JEAN]
Man, this is tasty!

239
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:38,375
Can I open the pistachio?

240
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:41,125
If you like that
kind of stuff, hold on.

241
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,041
We've got actual snacks.

242
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,791
Popcorn from JumMku!

243
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,375
Cheese and caramel!

244
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,875
[JEAN] They say the two
hardest districts to live in

245
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:52,041
are Suitsu and this place.

246
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,000
But other than that,
they don't really have

247
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,791
much in common.

248
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:59,291
In Pranetta, people and
goods can move freely.

249
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,458
[LOCUSTELLA] In Suitsu,
there's a huge gap between

250
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:03,416
the haves and the have-nots.

251
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,958
The district itself is rich,

252
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:07,791
but you'd never know it
to look at the commoners.

253
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:10,583
Pranetta, on the other hand,
is as poor as dirt.

254
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:14,000
Sure, we have tons of acreage,
but nothing'll grow here.

255
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:16,625
There's only so much
food to go around.

256
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:17,833
It's tough.

257
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:20,208
You have to be a little
crazy to live here,

258
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:21,708
willing to give up
comfort for a shot

259
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,916
at your dreams.

260
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:27,416
Yeah, it's all about
the mining industry.

261
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,916
[LOCUSTELLA]
More or less.

262
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,625
It's why so much of our annual
budget is allocated to it.

263
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,333
What else've we got?

264
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:35,458
Not that we've made
any big discoveries.

265
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:37,625
The people just keep
doing what they do.

266
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:42,041
Could be there's
nothing worth digging up.

267
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:45,458
Still, nobody has a harsh word
for the way things are run.

268
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:47,791
Good luck finding
that in Suitsu.

269
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,375
Here, the only thing
we complain about

270
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:50,916
is not getting to see the sun.

271
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,416
When we catch a glimpse,
we treasure it.

272
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,541
Glad the storm let up
sooner than I thought.

What's going on over there?

Is that the TV show?

00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:11,500
Nuh-uh.

This is the perfect time
to come up for air.

00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:29,875
It's a lovely evening.

285
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:33,333
I'd be delighted.

00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,250
I'm sorry.

00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:46,666
Eh.

293
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,416
It was impressive up close.

294
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,208
[JEAN]
Just like the people here.

295
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,250
Floors me how
cheerful they all are.

296
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:58,791
Did you happen to
bring your cigarettes?

297
00:14:58,875 --> 00:14:59,791
[JEAN]
Of course.

298
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,666
Don't guess I could have one.

299
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,666
[JEAN]
Sure, absolutely.

300
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,750
Please.

301
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:11,000
A coup d'etat
won't much change

302
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:13,458
the day-to-day life of us folk.

303
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:15,833
Even if it comes off
without a hitch.

304
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,083
Unlike the other districts,
we've got nothing to protect.

305
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:24,458
That's why we sat the
revolution out a century ago.

306
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:26,208
Where's the incentive?

307
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:28,416
We're dreamers
of a different stripe.

308
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,833
Heaven forbid we wake up.

309
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:33,666
Imagine us stumbling onto
some vital new resource

310
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:34,833
in the rock.

311
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:37,750
You know as well as
I do there'd be war.

312
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:41,125
Particularly if, despite
ACCA's best intentions,

313
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:44,041
the country slides into chaos.

314
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,041
People need their
dreams to breathe.

315
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,833
Yet few things are
more suffocating

316
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:50,166
than the prospect
of one coming true.

317

Heh, be careful what
you wish for, they say.

318
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,625
Prince Schwan
wants to abolish ACCA

Apparently so.

Nino actually works for
the DMwRoyal Family.

He's been watching over us.

It figures.

390
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:57,916
I guess deep down I always
knew there was more to him

00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,250
than meets the eye.

392

Remember that time?

393
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,791
We were kids and I was
dead-set on marrying him

00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:03,875
when I grew up.

Wow, how long ago was that?

396
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,708
Anyway, I proposed to him
and he got all,

Even way back then I could
tell something was off.

He took himself
way too seriously.

So I'm not surprised.

402

Doesn't seem like a big deal.

His Majesty King Falke
was forced to excuse himself

410
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,375
from an award ceremony
after what appeared

to be a brief collapse.

You've got a point.

verge of abdicating as we speak.

Ugh. That idiot prince
on the throne.

side where that's concerned.
