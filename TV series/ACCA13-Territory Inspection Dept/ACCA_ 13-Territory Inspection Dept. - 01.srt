1
00:00:14,958 --> 00:00:16,375
[TV REPORTER 1A]
Rise and shine!

2
00:00:16,458 --> 00:00:19,000
This is your morning report
with the Bon News Station.

3
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:21,125
Our top story:
His Majesty the King,

4
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:23,833
seen here addressing the
public from DMwCastle,

5
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:26,583
celebrates turning ninety-nine
years young today.

6
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:30,958
[LOTTA] Huh?
I had no idea he was that old.

7
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:33,958
[TV REPORTER 1A] ...including
several events in DMwitself.

8
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:37,125
Guess it goes to show ya
how peaceful this country is.

9
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:38,291
[LOTTA]
Better hurry, bro.

10
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:40,333
You'll be late if you
don't move it.

11
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:41,416
[JEAN]
Yeah, yeah.

12
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:44,500
That reminds me, Lotta.

13
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:45,958
I have a business trip today.

14
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:48,500
[LOTTA] Wha--? And you wait
till now to tell me this?

15
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:50,625
How am I supposed to
get your things ready?

16
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:53,541
[LOTTA]
Safe travels.

17
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:56,333
I expect you to bring
me a souvenir.

18
00:00:56,416 --> 00:00:57,416
[JEAN]
Mm-hmm.

19
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,166
[LOTTA]
Oh! Your cigarette case.

20
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:04,375
[LOTTA] Can't leave home
without your signature prop.

21
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:08,166
[LOTTA]
"Jean the Cigarette Peddler."

22
00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:11,750
Hey, Jean...

23
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:14,833
Can you bum me a smoke?

24
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,041
[MAN 1B]
Get a load of the smoker.

25
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:57,208
[MAN 1C] Wow, someone's
livin' the high life.

26
00:02:58,125 --> 00:02:59,791
[phone ringing]

27
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:08,166
[MOZ]
All right, people.

28
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,750
Fresh from Hachi-kuma
on third avenue,

29
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:13,125
today's ten o'clock
snack is roll cake!

30
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:14,625
[KELI]
Yeah!

31
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:16,791
[ATRI] It's not quite
ten yet, but so what?

32
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:19,708
[KNOT]
Ah, morning, Chairman.

33
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:21,833
Care for some
delicious roll cake?

34
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:23,875
[OWL] I'll indulge once
it's ten o'clock.

35
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:26,958
Sorry, Deputy Chief,

36
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,208
I heard you'd be out
so I didn't get you any.

37
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:30,916
You look like something's wrong.

38
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,375
[JEAN] Our department's
'bout to be shut down.

39
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:37,416
[GROUP]
Huh?

40
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,583
[POCHARD] Not that you
need reminding, I'm sure,

41
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,541
but as you're aware,
the DMwKingdom

42
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:46,333
is a federation comprised of
thirteen autonomous districts.

43
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,041
Along with various
other agencies

44
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,041
vital to the civic health
of this kingdom,

45
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:54,000
ACCA was designed to function
independently of the state.

46
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:56,208
It shares this in common
with law enforcement,

47
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:57,750
medical, fire...

48
00:03:57,833 --> 00:04:01,458
In fact a whole host of agencies
it is ACCA's job to oversee,

49
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,791
thus facilitating their
autonomy as constituents

50
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,333
of the federation.

51
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:07,666
I don't have to tell you that
we here at ACCA Headquarters

52
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,125
take our duty as administrative
watchdog quite seriously.

53
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:12,541
But might I ask you gentlemen

54
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:15,041
the ACCA Inspection
Department's mandate?

55
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,666
Well, sir, we monitor
and regulate the operations

56
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,333
of each branch, of course.

57
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:21,708
[POCHARD]
Precisely.

58
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,875
Your department was created
roughly a century ago

59
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:26,708
in a time of significant
political unrest.

60
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:29,041
Its primary function
was to keep a close eye

61
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:30,875
on the outlying districts.

62
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:33,000
Inspectors were stationed
at each ACCA branch

63
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,333
to supervise the flow
and distribution of data

64
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:37,000
at a granular level.

65
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:39,041
Senior officials
conducted random audits

66
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,500
to ensure the
process's integrity.

67
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:44,541
My point being... your
department's purpose arose

68
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:47,166
in response to
civic instability.

69
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,666
Therefore...

70
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,125
We're being canned.
Makes sense, I suppose.

71
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,583
Guess we all knew it'd
happen eventually, right?

72
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:56,208
What can you do?
We're obsolete.

73
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,791
It is unfortunate
we'll be split up, though.

74
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:01,375
[MOZ, ATRI crying]

75
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,166
[ATRI]
Say it isn't so!

76
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,708
Oh, and Jean.

77
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,291
You're still going out today.

78
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:08,791
[JEAN]
Huh?

79
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,500
Good luck. The next flight
leaves in 'bout half an hour.

80
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:12,583
[JEAN sighs]

81
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,125
[POCHARD] The Inspection
Department has been notified

82
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:17,625
of their termination.

83
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:18,708
[SPADE]
Thank you.

84
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:25,958
[door opens, closes]

85
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:29,333
ACCA will move forward
without Inspection.

86
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:31,708
And we're certain
this was a smart move?

87
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:33,916
[GROSSULAR] The budget
needs streamlining.

88
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,208
We're simply trimming
the excess fat.

89
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:37,291
That's all this is.

90
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:39,375
[LILIUM]
Interesting point of view.

91
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:41,375
The Inspection Department
has always ensured

92
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:42,750
things were above-board.

93
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:46,791
They kept us honest.
Is that your idea of excessive?

94
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:49,791
[GROSSULAR] They're only
necessary in uncertain times.

95
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:52,333
[PINE] A good inspector helps
smooth out regional operations

96
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:54,041
even when, for all
intents and purposes,

97
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:55,708
the country's doing well.

98
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:58,208
[GROSSULAR] And they've
done an admirable job.

99
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,083
But right now Headquarters
needs to demonstrate its trust

100
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,750
in the outlying districts.

101
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:03,833
[LILIUM]
Trust?

102
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,291
[PINE]
Well, what's done is done.

103
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:10,166
We can assess the backlash
later, if there is any.

104
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:12,708
[phone ringing]

105
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,083
[GROSSULAR]
Excuse me.

106
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,625
Anyone else find they
can breathe a lot easier

107
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,291
when that man leaves the room?

108
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:32,541
[JEAN] Land as far
as the eye can see.

109
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,125
This place is huge.

110
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,916
Bet you're thinking this
is the middle of nowhere.

111
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,458
Not many folks out n' about
now that the harvest is over.

112
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,208
Guess not.

113
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:57,750
[EIDER] We're mostly an
agricultural district, y'see.

114
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,416
Take a guess how much
of the nation's produce

115
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,500
comes out of Fasu...
Ninety percent!

116
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:02,875
Can you believe it?

117
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:03,916
[JEAN]
Impressive.

118
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,833
Pretty low crime
rate too, I'm told.

119
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,958
[EIDER]
Absolutely!

120
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:11,916
The residents are super nice.
Couldn't ask for an easier job.

121
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,208
D'you like it here?

122
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:14,541
You bet!

123
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,666
Good. Glad it's so cushy.

124
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,375
Too bad we're getting shut
down at the end of the month.

125
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:22,791
[EIDER]
What?!

126
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,291
[JEAN]
Watch the road, will ya?

127
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:28,750
[EIDER] What do you mean
we're getting shut down?

128
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,666
It was bound to
happen sooner or later.

129
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,333
Our department's a fossil.

130
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:34,375
Blame the peace and prosperity.

131
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,208
You had to know the other
shoe was gonna drop

132
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:37,541
at some point.

133
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,875
[EIDER]
Not so much, actually.

134
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:43,333
So what happens
to us afterwards?

135
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,125
Well, you're a supervisor.

136
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:46,833
I'm sure you'll
land on your feet.

137
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:47,958
[EIDER gasps]

138
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:50,250
The people I work with
are like family!

139
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,458
I can't just give 'em the axe!

140
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,041
Let's grab the check, huh?

141
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:57,416
And just so you know,

142
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,000
technically my job includes
evaluating subordinates.

143
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,958
[EIDER] Go over our stuff
with a fine-tooth comb.

144
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:11,750
You won't find anything
out of line.

145
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,166
[JEAN]
I'll give you this much.

146
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,666
You people are organized.

147
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,333
[EIDER]
On to the next stop.

148
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:19,041
Wait a sec...
There's a little bit of business

149
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:22,291
I need to take care of while
the branch director's on duty.

150
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,416
[BRANCH DIRECTOR 1A] Still
cartin' around those random

151
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,625
catalogs, Otus?

152
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,416
Well I'll be damned.

153
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,625
[JEAN] Feel free to hold
on to the ones you like.

154
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:34,958
Yeah. Donut vending
machines... you don't say?

155
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,291
That's a keeper.

156
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,750
[JEAN] Whatever helps pass
the time, am I right?

157
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:45,458
[EIDER]
So, uh... what was that about?

158
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:48,541
A company president
I know asked me to do it.

159
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,916
Well... station rounds
tomorrow, I suppose.

160
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,750
Ugh. It'll take forever.

161
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,625
This district is enormous.

162
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,125
What's the matter?

163
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:58,875
[keyboard clicking]

164
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:00,625
[JEAN]
HQ.

165
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:01,916
[MOZ]
Hey, Deputy Chief!

166
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,083
[ATRI] Don't forget
to bring us presents!

167
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:05,208
[JEAN]
Yeah, yeah.

168
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:06,375
Is Knot around?

169
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,083
[KNOT]
What can I do for ya?

170
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:11,000
[JEAN] I need to take a look
at the data logs for Fasu

171
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,208
and their inspector
shift records.

172
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:14,375
Yeah. Sure thing.

173
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:18,333
[JEAN]
Thank you.

174
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:23,750
Here, look at October third.

175
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,375
Um, 'kay.

176
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,916
[JEAN] The time stamp for your
west station's data transfer

177
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,791
is off by five minutes.

178
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,875
Weird it's only
the one day, yeah?

179
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,666
Yep, this data's
been tampered with.

180
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,208
You've got to be kidding me!

181
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:41,041
Uh, I mean, how so?

182
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:45,000
[JEAN] How far to the
west station from here?

183
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,583
By plane?
About an hour n' a half.

184
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:48,875
[JEAN]
Then we still have time.

185
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,625
[INSPECTOR 1A]
This is sort of unexpected.

186
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,250
Especially with His Majesty's
birthday festivities

187
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,250
in full swing.

188
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:08,916
This won't take long.

189
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,958
[JEAN] Are Constables
Maïs and Beets here?

190
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:13,791
I don't imagine so.

191
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,750
Municipal festivals
tend to be high tide

192
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,291
for black market deals.

193
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:23,083
[JEAN] On October third,
following an anonymous tip,

194
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,166
the constables conducted
a warehouse search

195
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,750
on the outskirts
of this district.

196
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:30,791
But there's no record
of the search; care to explain?

197
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,250
See, I'm inclined
to think they caught

198
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,625
some unlicensed tobacco
dealers in action,

199
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,291
and in exchange for
turning a blind eye,

200
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,916
agreed to take a cut
of all future trade.

201
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,708
The shift logs would have to be
changed to cover their tracks,

202
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,458
so naturally they'd
turn to the one person

203
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:46,708
with the clearance
to fudge the numbers.

204
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:48,958
What exactly are you suggesting?

205
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,041
Last I checked,
compiling all shift data

206
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,000
and forwarding the
records to HQ fall under

207
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,833
your job description.

208
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:58,125
Seems the moral dilemma
cost you about five minutes.

209
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:58,958
Whoa!

210
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,375
Wait a minute, Deputy Chief!

211
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,125
How can you be so damn sure?

212
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:03,833
A tiny discrepancy like that?

213
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:09,250
For the record, he might've
just been sick that day.

214
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,083
Is it confirmed in this case?

215
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:16,041
'Kay, you're, uh, not a man
who trusts subordinates.

216
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,208
The tip about the
warehouse was still in

217
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:21,250
the previous day's report.

218
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:22,958
Corroborating data.

219
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,833
[JEAN] In hindsight, it might've
been better to scrub that

220
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:29,708
from the shift logs, too.

221
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:31,583
No, wait! Please, sir!

222
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,208
I had no idea what
they were doing!

223
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:34,791
I'm innocent!

224
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,083
[JEAN]
Is that a fact?

225
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:41,208
Then tell me this, why do
you smell like cigarettes?

226
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:46,041
[EIDER]
You win.

227
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,708
Constables Beets and
Maïs confessed.

228
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,208
[JEAN]
Case closed, then. 

229
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:51,375
'Course at the end of the day,

230
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:53,708
all we've done is smear
our own name.

231
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:56,416
I'm sorry, sir.

232
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,250
You were just trying
to do your job.

233
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,791
[JEAN] I try not to treat
subordinates like criminals,

234
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:05,166
but it comes with
the territory sometimes.

235
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,458
My job is doubting people,
plain and simple.

236
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:11,416
To be honest, I'll be
glad to leave it behind.

237
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:16,083
Plus all the travel
really takes a toll.

238
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:24,500
[EIDER] I can't help but wonder
where ACCA goes from here.

239
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:25,916
Without Inspection oversight,

240
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,500
you think the branches will
become more independent?

241
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:33,000
Or maybe, they'll just fall
in line with whatever HQ wants.

242
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:35,458
Probably the former, I'd think.

243
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:38,083
The districts prize their
individuality too much.

244
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:40,125
I'm not complaining, mind you.

245
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:42,208
That independent
streak's a blessing.

246
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:45,875
Heh, keeps this country
peaceful if you ask me.

247
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:48,916
Besides, ACCA is a
unified front in name only.

248
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,208
I mean, all thirteen districts
have their own uniform.

249
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,875
Your place has a
particular look and feel.

250
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,041
Same with all the others.

251
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,291
Everybody goes with
what works for 'em.

252
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:02,208
Best part about how things
are organized, I think.

253
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:03,583
If you don't want
to get absorbed,

254
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:06,333
you can always request
a position transfer.

255
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:07,916
No need to leave here.

256
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,500
[EIDER]
Thanks, but no thanks.

257
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:13,791
I want to go back to HQ; there's
so much I can learn from you!

258
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:18,875
[JEAN]
Huh?

259
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,750
What do you mean
we're not laid off?

260
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:24,000
Exactly that. We just received
the news this morning.

261
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:27,708
[JEAN] But we uncovered
potentially systemic corruption.

262
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:29,958
I thought they'd shut
us down immediately.

263
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:32,916
Hey, all's well
that ends well, right?

264

[EIDER groans]

265
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:37,791
[SPADE] Granted,
the Inspection Department

266
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,541
did create a bit of a stink.

267
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:42,500
But the district branch in
question was in fact corrupt.

268
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:44,083
Proof of why we need them.

269
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,375
They can smoke out
corruption before it escalates

270
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:47,875
into outright scandal.

271
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:50,083
As such, their
disbandment is repealed.

272
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,291
There's no
reasonable alternative.

273
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:53,500
[PINE]
None at all.

274
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,541
I'm surprised Grossular
conceded so quickly.

275
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:59,625
He was the most vocal
proponent of their termination.

276
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:02,083
Why would he change his mind?

277
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:03,583
Who in the world
could possibly guess

278
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:05,416
at what goes on
in that man's head?

279
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,583
He's a cipher.

280
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:15,583
Deputy Chief Otus.
I want him monitored.

Aren't you off duty today?

[KNOT]
What'cha got there?

299
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:13,583
Just a draft of the third

Chairman, don't you think
this schedule's a little much?

311
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,541
As it is, I have
to audit each branch

312

at least once every two years.

313

You can't really expect me to
hit up all thirteen districts
