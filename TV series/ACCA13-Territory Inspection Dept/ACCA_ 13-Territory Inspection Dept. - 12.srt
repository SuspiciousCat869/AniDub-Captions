1
00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:14,958
[FALKE II]
Has Prince Schwan left yet?

2
00:00:15,041 --> 00:00:16,333
Yes.

3
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:19,375
[FALKE II] Alas, we have no
choice but to be unkind.

4
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:22,333
It's a cruel thing
to do to one so young.

5
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:24,416
But we must think
of the kingdom.

6
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:28,125
Well, it's our fault
for spoiling the lad.

7
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:30,458
We and his mother
coddled him so.

8
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:32,833
You, on the other hand,
have served us well

9
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:34,166
and are blameless.

10
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,583
Thank you, Qualm,

11
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:39,000
for allowing me to meet Schnee's
children before the end.

12
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:42,208
The apple doesn't fall
far from the tree, eh?

13
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:44,708
You will see them
again, Majesty.

14
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:47,750
Here in DMw in this very room.

15
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:51,916
[LILIUM] Though he is
spearheading the plan,

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,500
I'm afraid a sudden bout of ill
health prevents Grossular

17
00:00:54,583 --> 00:00:56,041
from attending our meeting.

18
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:59,291
I will be coordinating
things in his stead.

19
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:02,250
This is the last assembly
before we proceed.

20
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:04,916
Consider it final confirmation
we're all on the same page

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,333
for tomorrow.

22
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:10,416
Also, you'll note Prince Jean
is here with us.

23
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,875
Our fate and the fate
of our nation rests entirely

24
00:01:13,958 --> 00:01:16,000
on a successful coup d'état.

25
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:17,916
The plan cannot be changed.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,750
However, it can be cast aside.

27
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:24,291
Are there any colleagues
present who wish to do so?

28
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:27,000
[LILIUM]
Excellent.

29
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:28,541
Let us proceed.

30
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:32,708
[COP 12A] As patrol officers,
your primary function

31
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:36,125
will be crowd control in
the event of civil unrest.

32
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:37,791
Okay. This is happening.

33
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:39,833
[COP 12B]
C'mon, it's in the bag.

34
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:43,250
The prince only has fifteen
guards, 'least so I hear.

35
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:44,916
Plus, the Privy Council
knows everything,

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,083
and they can't
stand the kid either.

37
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:49,166
[COP 12C]
So who's gonna be king?

38
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,791
And how do we know he
won't try to abolish ACCA?

39
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:54,000
[COP 12B]
Guess you got a point there.

40
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:55,666
[RAIL] They gonna
announce the Otus family

41
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,250
has royal blood or aren't they?

42
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:00,750
I wonder how Lotta's doing.

43
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:03,416
When the press swoops in,
I'll protect her.

44
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:05,250
Excuse me.

45
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,166
I'd like to speak.

46
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,416
Once Prince Schwan
is in custody,

47
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,166
part of the plan is to
have him swear an oath

48
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,583
conceding his claim to
the throne, am I right?

49
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:17,500
Couldn't that wait until later?

50
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:20,250
It's just, maybe I
shouldn't shove my way

51
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:22,333
to center stage tomorrow.

52
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:24,666
I mean, wouldn't
that make the guy

53
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,875
more liable to dig in?

54
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:30,583
No need for this to be any
harder on him than it has to be.

55
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:33,458
I think His Highness
makes a valid point.

56
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:35,458
Prince Schwan is
the insolent sort.

57
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:37,041
[JEAN] So when you
confront him tomorrow,

58
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:38,291
leave me out of it.

59
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,541
He doesn't need to know
right then and there.

60
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:43,041
I'll let the Five Chief
officers do the talking.

61
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:46,125
Just, uh, don't mention
I'm of royal lineage, okay?

62
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,458
We can deal with
all that down the road.

63
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:50,291
Very well, if that's your wish.

64
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:51,916
Does everyone agree?

65
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:54,583
Thank you.

66
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,375
I think we're gonna
pull this off.

67
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:04,500
That's the schedule
for tomorrow, right?

68
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,750
You're okay with all of this?

69
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,958
Aw, c'mon.
Don't give me that look.

70
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:14,250
[JEAN] What would you
do in my shoes?

71
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:17,208
What do you think is
best for the country?

72
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:20,583
This may sound weird, but
I've been waiting for this talk.

73
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:23,041
About ACCA,
I mean, and the nation.

74
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:24,625
[GROSSULAR]
We could ramble on till sunrise

75
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:27,708
and barely cover a fraction
of what needs to be said.

76
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:31,666
[MAGIE]
Yes, Commander.

77
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,166
Quite well, thank you.

78
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,791
The Prince is sulking,
but that's no surprise.

79
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,333
It's his own fault.

80
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:40,166
[MOND] Harsh words to level
against your own master, Magie.

81
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,250
[MAGIE]
Apologies.

82
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,583
I do worry that
security is too sparse.

83
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:45,541
[MOND] It's as His
Highness requested.

84
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,291
He didn't feel ACCA
worthy of the usual

85
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:48,875
pomp and circumstance.

86
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,583
The Privy Council approved.

87
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:53,791
[SCHWAN]
Stupid Magie.

88
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:55,958
You said you were gonna
bring me sandwich bread.

89
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,541
[NINO]
Something's different.

90
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:05,458
I can feel it in the air,
even this early in the morning.

91
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:07,291
[OWL]
What do the doctors say?

92
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,416
[NINO chuckles]
That I'm good as new.

93
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,875
Well, good enough
to shield Lotta

94
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:13,208
from the paparazzi, anyway.

95
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:17,708
Jean should be in decent shape;
he's under ACCA's protection.

96
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,708
Thing is, I don't
feel half as worried

97
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:21,958
as I probably should.

98
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:23,875
Hell if I know why.

99
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:26,833
[JEAN]
Watch over me?

100
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:30,916
It's not your place to
protect the Royal Family, Nino.

101
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,875
[NINO] No one forced
this on me. I chose it.

102
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,208
[JEAN]
Yeah, well then...

103
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:36,750
Lighten up, at least.

104
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:37,875
Enjoy yourself.

105
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:42,083
Like I enjoy your company.

106
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,375
It's allowed.

107
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:48,125
Or's your "boss"
gonna scold you for that?

108
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:50,333
[NINO]
Jean always lands on his feet.

109
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,166
[LILIUM]
Well. It's time.

110
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:57,541
Yeah.

111
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:12,416
[LOTTA]
What the--?

112
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,458
Why is Jean all
the way up there?

113
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:17,666
[MAN 12A]
The prince!

114
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,333
How long will this take?

115
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:39,458
The ceremony begins
with the national anthem,

116
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:41,333
after which the
Five Chief Officers

117
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:42,791
and the Director General
will speak--

118
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,791
[SCHWAN]
That wasn't my question.

119
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,708
[JEAN]
Here we go.

120
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:51,791
The only ones not in on it are
the Prince and his guards.

[SCHWAN]
What is the meaning of this?

125
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,041
You would point a gun
at your future king?!

126
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,458
[LILIUM] We do so to protect
ACCA, Your Highness,

127
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:45,750
and the nation.

128
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:50,708
You mean to dissolve this
organization; we kindly object.

129
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,875
Nor do we stand alone.

130
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:57,166
Few of our fellow citizens
wish to see you on the throne.

00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,916
The royal family least of all.

What's going on?

00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:03,625
[CROWD 12B]
He wants to dissolve ACCA?

135
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:04,708
[CROWD 12C] Prince Schwan
doesn't give a damn

00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:05,958
about this nation!

[SCHWAN] This is the coup
I've heard so much about.

142
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,375
They aim to cast me out--

143
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:21,375
to ruin me and put a vile
pretender in my place!

All in the name
of preserving ACCA.

Step forward, usurper!

Go on!

Or aren't you man
enough to challenge me?

148
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,333
Oh, Jean.

00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,125
Silence, please!

You, Your Highness.

There exists no
challenger to the throne.

153
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:02,250
ACCA's duty is to protect.

154
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,291
It should go without
saying that this includes

155
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:06,625
protecting the DMwFamily.

156
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:08,958
After all, those
of the royal house

00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:12,375
are the preeminent symbol
of this nation's heart.

00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:17,291
so go the fortunes of every
man, woman and child.

160
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:20,958
I don't recall discussing
this part of our stratagem.

161
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:24,083
[MAUVE] Let no one question
the legitimacy of your claim.

162
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,666
As such, we ask that
you take greater care.

163
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:30,916
ACCA is honored by
Prince Schwan's presence.

164
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,333
However, we feel it
is beneath Your Highness

165
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:35,791
to travel with such
a small guard detail.

166
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,500
Your security is paramount.

167
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,250
We understand, of course,
your chosen guards

168
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:44,125
constitute an elite fighting
force in their own right.

169
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:47,375
But, a modest compliment of
even highly trained soldiers

170
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,458
is no match for
a well-aimed gun,

171
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,625
as we've just
witnessed firsthand.

172
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,916
This was a demonstration.

173
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,375
A somewhat theatrical
exercise, perhaps,

174
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:59,291
but an important means
of driving the point home.

175
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:01,875
We hope you'll forgive us.

176
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,000
Should you choose
to show us mercy,

177
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:07,750
I am certain the gesture will
not be lost on your subjects.

178
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:10,583
The DMwFamily is well known
for their understanding.

179
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,875
It's no wonder we're at peace.

180
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:15,208
Leaders who revel in
vicious displays of power

181
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:18,083
bring their
constituencies to ruin.

182
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:20,708
Our kings have always
been above such things.

183
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:22,208
With your guidance,
ACCA will see

184
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:25,250
that this continues
to be the case.

185
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:26,583
So, Your Highness.

186
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,458
We entrust the future to you.

187
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:42,166
[SCHWAN]
Very well.

188
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,625
And I entrust its
safety to ACCA.

189
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,375
Your hand, Your Highness.

190
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,791
[MAUVE]
We are honored by your faith.

191
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,208
[CROWD clapping]

192
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,083
Nino?

193
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,250
Oh, dear.

194
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,916
Seems only Furawau
was kept in the dark.

195
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,916
This is an absolute travesty!

196
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,125
Word to the wise, friend.

197
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,750
Cheating doesn't
guarantee you a win.

198
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:32,000
But hey, if Furawau's dumb
enough to play another hand,

199
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:34,375
don't let us stop you.

200
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:35,958
[LILIUM]
You were part of this?

201
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,125
[LILIUM]
Bastard.

202
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,000
[JEAN] After Director
General Mauve told me

203
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,333
I was of royal blood,

204
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,916
she and I had a brainstorming
session in Koro^

205
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,458
specifically so we'd
be prepared for today.

206
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:55,041
Sneaky, huh?

207
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:57,916
See, the idea was for your
game to become ACCA's

208
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,708
so we could beat it.

209
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,333
Because let's be real.

210
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:03,375
A win for Furawau
and a win for ACCA

211
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:05,416
are two totally
different things.

212
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,458
We wanted to
maintain the status quo

213
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,625
for the organization
to carry on as always.

214
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,041
But Furawau?

215
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:15,125
You and yours had something
quite different in mind.

216
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:18,375
ACCA's preservation was
just a convenient pretext.

217
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:20,125
For you, winning
meant taking control

218
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,958
away from the DMwFamily.

219
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:25,000
You played the
districts like a fiddle--

220
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:28,208
told them if ACCA vanished,
so would their autonomy.

221
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,333
Tap into that fear, and presto.

222
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:33,875
Suddenly the impossible
dream isn't that impossible.

223
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:37,125
Unless ACCA found
a way to beat you first,

224
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,916
turn the game on its end
and send Furawau packing.

225
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,791
So a lucky guess?

226
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:45,666
No, wait. You had help.

227
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,166
[JEAN] Director General
Mauve conducted

228
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:51,041
a thorough investigation of
Furawau's internal affairs.

229
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,458
She also has sworn testimony
from your representative

230
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,541
in the Central Council.

231
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,750
Clearly this is what
I get for trusting anyone

232
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:00,166
outside the Lilium Family.

233
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,583
So what're you gonna do?

234
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:02,833
Bet another hand?

235
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,916
Is the chance really
worth another go?

236
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:11,083
[LILIUM]
I believe we'll fold.

237
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:14,000
As it turns out, the ante's
a bit too rich for us.

238
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,125
Director General.

239
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,125
Very nice work.

240
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:26,666
The Five Chief Officers have
overstayed their welcome.

241
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,375
We're obsolete,
a thin echo of the leaders

242
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,666
who brought this
country into being.

243
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,791
How little of them survives
in us, their descendants.

244
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:38,208
Gentlemen, it's time
for us to step down.

245
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,708
Mauve is the leader now.

246
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:49,083
Otus briefed me on
the plan last night.

247
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:53,333
Today, I was reluctant to
stand here in my usual role.

248
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:57,333
But what I once took as a
sign of discord now seems...

249
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:58,875
...like solidarity.

250
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,333
Thank you.

251
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:25,250
So, she even kept it
secret from us, huh?

252
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,250
That's what I call
good leadership.

Sorry if I made
you worry about me.

Nino ran off to?

It probably saved
my life, so yeah.

Oh. No, the prince was
beside himself with worry

265
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:03,000
and demanded I alert
you to the danger.

Come to the castle sometime.

[LOCUSTELLA] In the end,
not even their royal heritage

269
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,666
was made public knowledge.

But for the next short while,

tensions may run high in
individual branch offices.

Never has the Inspection
Department's role been so vital.

Hey, Chief.
What's in the white envelope?

After all was said and done,

285
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,166
the centennial
marked the beginning

286
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,541
of a new era for ACCA.

00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,625
The Five Chief
Officers resigned,

[MAUVE chuckles]

Because that's what
Grossular wanted.

00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,916
And I couldn't agree more.

299
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,333
[NINO] Chief Officer
Grossular hoped to retire,

300
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:22,666
but Mauve persuaded
him to stay on.

301
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:27,000
He continues to serve his
country in an advisory capacity.

Sentimental though it may be,

303
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,458
my hope is that one day
Furawau sees fit to rejoin

304
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,166
the DMwKingdom.

Till then I say
leave the door open.

306
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:38,041
[NINO]
Furawau seceded from the union.

307
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:41,500
The influx of natural
resources slowed to a crawl.

308

But the discovery of new
resources underground

in Pranetta changed the
conversation drastically.

People flocked to the desert and
applied for residency in droves,

including many young dreamers
from neighboring Yakkara,

eager to trade dice
for a piece of the future.

[SPADE]
Gotta bet on the winning horse.

Life as an ordinary
citizen is fantastic.

00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:09,208
[NINO] With ACCA's
transition into a new phase,

318
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,375
the other Chief Officers
were free to pursue

319
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:14,208
their destinies
wherever they led.

320
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:17,041
[PINE] My goal is
fairly straightforward.

321
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:20,416
As JumMku's District Chief
I move specialty produce,

322
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,708
particularly to our
friends in Suitsu.

323
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:24,250
[NINO]
Speaking of Suitsu,

324
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,250
for the first time in
the district's history,

325
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,083
citizens, rich and poor alike,

326
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,791
will be allowed to elect
their next representative.

327
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,041
[PASTIS]
My reasons?

328
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,875
Why, just look at the scenery.

329
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,375
Breathtaking.

330
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:40,000
I couldn't deny the rest of
DMwsuch beauty any longer.

331
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,333
Simple as that.

332
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:43,875
[WARBLER]
Wow.

333
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:46,250
Who could've predicted you'd
be nominated for the council?

334
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:48,000
Things are changing, my friend.

335
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:49,833
The future is now.

336
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:52,541
[NINO] Suitsu's newly opened
borders were welcome news

337
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:55,833
for those shaken by
Furawau's secession.

338
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,250
Things were changing.

339
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,500
[OLDER BROTHER] I'm curious,
what was the point of origin

340
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:04,208
for the rumor regarding
Jean Otus's blood?

341
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,250
[LILIUM]
Hmph.

342
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:08,500
Even if we knew
it wouldn't matter.

343
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:10,166
Hardly worth pondering.

344
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:13,416
Furawau and the Lilium Family
have better things to do.

345
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,875
[MAGIE]
Your Highness.

346
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,125
Miss Lotta has
arrived from Bon.

347
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:30,041
Here. I brought you
some sandwich bread!

348
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:31,416
[SCHWAN]
I accept.

349
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,583
And Agent Rail wanted me
to bring something for you.

350
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,458
He'll love it, I'm sure!

351
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:40,375
[LOTTA]
And then there's this.

352
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,000
For the First Princess.

353
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:45,791
I wanted to thank her for
telling me all about my mom.

354
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:48,250
You know she tried to
have you assassinated?

355
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:54,125
[NINO] "Her Highness apologized,
and I forgave her," she said.

356
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,375
But really, it was
because they were family,

357
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:59,500
something Lotta was
thrilled to have more of.

358
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:01,208
[SCHWAN]
Grandfather is waiting.

359
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:11,291
[NINO]
Nicely done, sir.

360
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:14,250
[MAN] I was merely following
President Qualm's orders.

361
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,625
The Lilium plot to get their
hooks into the royal family

362
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:19,958
had to be thwarted before
Schwan's ascension.

363
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:23,000
Even if it meant
involving the Otus siblings.

364
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:25,958
Not a gambit I would've
conceived on my own.

365
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:27,750
[NINO] Maybe not,
but you were definitely

366
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,916
an essential cog in the wheel.

367
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,583
I mean, you're the
one who insisted Jean

368
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:33,791
would never seek
his birthright alone.

369
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:36,333
You've been guiding him
for the past six months.

370
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,791
That's some impressive
behind-the-scenes orchestration,

371
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,250
if you ask me.

372
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,333
[MAN]
It wasn't as grand as all that.

373
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:43,458
Come, now.

374
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,041
You know better than anyone.

375
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,500
[MAN]
As you also must know,

376
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:52,666
his Majesty no longer
requires the photos you take.

377
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,625
You are released
from your duties.

378
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,208
You're free.

379
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,583
Live as you choose.

380
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:01,333
Thank you.
You can be sure I will.

381
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:04,083
[MAN]
Well. If you'll excuse me.

382
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:06,166
Perhaps we'll meet again.

383
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:09,291
Freedom has a way of bringing
unlikely people together.

384
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,625
[DRIVER 12A]
Where to?

385
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:24,041
[MAN] Beak Beauty Salon
in the East Sector, please.

386
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:26,125
And I'd appreciate
a bit of haste.

387
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,750
Dyeing my hair blond
is always such a hassle.

388
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,958
[ATRI]
Hey, there. Welcome back.

389
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,791
You must be exhausted
from the trip.

390
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:56,041
Y'know, not so much actually.

391
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:57,958
Schedule's easy
this time of year.

392
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:00,583
Bet the rounds they had
you on before were murder.

393
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:01,916
Want some coffee?

394
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,958
[JEAN]
Sure.

395
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:06,500
[KELI] Guess who I saw in
the café downstairs again?

396
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:09,166
Director General Mauve and
Chief Officer Grossular!

397
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,500
Such a cute couple!

398
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:13,125
[MOZ] Right?
They're perfect for each other!

399
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,583
[JEAN] My parents died in the
Peshi-Rokkusu train accident

400
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,000
all those years ago.

401
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,250
I was still just a kid.

402
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:28,416
But it was how I first came to
meet Chief Officer Grossular.

403
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,291
He'd come to meet the
families of the victims.

404
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,625
He put a hand
on my shoulder--

405
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:36,333
looked at me
without saying a word.

406
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:39,833
If I really am of royal
blood like some people say,

407
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:42,166
I think Grossular knew,
way back then

408
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,916
just by looking at me.

409
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,291
And if he did,
he didn't tell a soul.

410
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,583
That's just the
kind of guy he is.

411
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,250
I saw it, even as a kid.

412
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:55,333
The man takes pride in his work.

413
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:58,958
He's the reason I got interested
in ACCA in the first place.

414
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:01,958
You really look up to Grossular,
don't you, Jean?

415
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,083
It wasn't long before
someone who shared

416
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:07,708
his perspective on
things came into her own

417
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:09,916
and got promoted
to Director General.

418
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:14,291
Let's just say,
Grossular isn't the only one

419
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:15,875
I look up to, ma'am.

420
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:20,875
We're quite a pair, you and I.

421
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:23,250
Birds of a feather
discussing our mentor.

422
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,125
--[knocking]
--[ATRI] Here you are.

423
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,958
[JEAN]
Wait, there's enough for me?

424
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:37,041
[MOZ] Well, that slice
was originally for Knot,

425
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:38,333
but he had to leave.

426
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:40,000
[KELI] His wife
called from the airport.

427
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,416
They're getting back together,
isn't that great?

428
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,541
[JEAN]
Hmm...

429
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:44,875
[KELI]
Oh, I meant to ask you.

430
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:47,291
Lotta's out of town for
the next few days, right?

431
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:48,166
[JEAN]
Hm?

432
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,666
Are you getting enough to eat?

433
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,208
Proper meals, not just junk.

434
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:53,791
[JEAN]
Yeah, I'm fine.

435
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:56,041
I drink alone sometimes, sure.

436
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:58,833
But eventually my ol'
partner in crime wanders in.

437
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:48,541
[NINO]
Having fun yet, Jean?

438
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:50,208
[JEAN]
Seriously?

439
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:52,000
[NINO]
Aw, don't be that way.

440
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:53,750
Things could be worse.

441
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:56,166
[JEAN] Says the prom king
who ditched his queen.

442
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:59,083
What's the matter, crown
too much responsibility?

443
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:00,416
It's not that.

444
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,250
I just think it looks
better on you.

445
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:19,791
[JEAN] You and I haven't
changed a bit, have we?
