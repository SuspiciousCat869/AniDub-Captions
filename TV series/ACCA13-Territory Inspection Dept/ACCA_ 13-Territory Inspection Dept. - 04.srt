We may be part of
the Kingdom in name,

but we've been cut
off from the rest of you!

what the Five Chief Officers
have been talking about.

[BISCUIT]
Exactly.

[JEAN] What'll your
demands be once you do?

212
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,541
There're two things we're after.

213
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:44,125
First, remove
travel restrictions.

214
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,708
That's vital. When we move
freely between districts,

215
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:48,541
Suitsu grows.

216
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:52,291
You're not the only folks
who feel that way, actually.

217
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,000
Why don't I make
you a little deal?

218
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,458
Once that demand's granted,

219
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:57,875
I'll introduce you to people
who can help with reform.

220
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:01,083
You're only saying that
so we'll let you go free!

221
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:02,333
No, really.

00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:05,250
Listen, my briefcase is
back in my hotel room.

225

Huh?

229
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:21,250
ACCA is far too
removed from politics

230
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:22,875
to understand.

231
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:24,500
Congress has the real power.

232
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:25,958
It was formed as
part of the treaty

233
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,416
that granted the
district's autonomy.

234
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,625
Representatives
are an institution.

235
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:32,041
They meet on behalf
of their districts

236
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,708
to discuss matters
of public policy.

237
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:37,333
leveraging the needs
of their constituents.

238
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:39,333
Over the past century,
each district

239
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,375
has maintained commerce
with its neighbors,

240
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:43,291
allowing the kingdom
to flourish as a whole.

241
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:46,208
Suitsu is the one exception.

242
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,250
The gentry in this
nation are obsessed

243
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,000
with our "integrity." 

244
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:52,333
Beurre rose to power
on populist rhetoric

245
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:55,166
and empty promises
of opening our borders.

246
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,000
He was a commoner:
a man of the people.

247
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:00,125
We elected him to the
position hoping to see

248
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:04,083
our district finally
embrace the outside world.

249
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:05,833
And yet, not once
has he returned

250
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:08,166
from his congressional
seat in Bon,

251
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,458
the bastard.

252
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,375
It makes perfect sense.

253
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:13,291
Who in their right mind
would come back here

254
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,000
knowing how things are?

255
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,458
Beurre wanted fame.

256
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,916
He couldn't care less
about the common folk.

257
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,041
Chief Officer Pastis
still visits home

258
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:23,166
every chance he gets,
or so I'm told.

259
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,833
He's not a politician.

260
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:28,041
He has no interest in
opening up Suitsu's borders.

261
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:29,375
At the end of the day,

262
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,708
his kind has done far too
well by the status quo

263
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:33,541
to care about reform.

264
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,375
Pastis is nobility.

265
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,916
Forget about him for now.

be taken down.

[MAN 4G]
Someone's here!

322
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,000
What's wrong?

323
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:05,458
[WARBLER] Sorry, I was
looking for somebody.

324
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,416
Hey, Warbler.

325
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,291
What the hell is going on?!

326
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,541
Look, he knows our plan.

327
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,125
We had no choice.

328
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:13,500
You stupid--

329
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,208
Bad news! An ACCA squad
discovered our meeting place

330
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:16,416
in the west sector!

331
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,666
A few men got out,

332
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,958
but they're sure it's
only a matter of time

333
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:21,250
before the cops
stage a full-scale raid!

334
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,416
Our comrades are
moving tonight!

335
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,958
Gah! They were supposed to wait!

336
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,416
Right! No one gets in or out!

337
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,625
Resistance is to be
met with gunfire!

[MOB yelling]

339
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:35,875
What do we do now?

340
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,250
Looks like our
hand's been forced.

341
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,250
[MAN 4D]
Damn right!

342
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:39,833
No point standing around!

343
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:41,250
So be it, then.

344
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:42,458
Take up arms!

345
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,500
We join our brothers!

346
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:50,625
It's safe to say things
are about to get interesting.

347
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,666
Yeah, and it's
not the first time.

348
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,333
Commoners have been
trying this for years.

349
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:57,208
So, I'm guessing
you're their source

350
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,416
of information on
Congressman Beurre.

351
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,333
Am I right? I am.

352
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,958
[WARBLER] I'm worried about
the Inspection Office.

353
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,583
Let's avoid the main roads.

354
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,625
[MOB yelling]

[yelling continues]

356
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:25,791
[WARBLER] The battle's
starting to spill over from

357
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,041
the main roads.

358
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:28,291
Watch yourself.

Where'd you go?

[JEAN gasps]

364
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,500
[MOB MEMBER 4A]
Well, lookie here.

365
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:37,875
Caught ourselves a bird.

366
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,750
D'ja think we
wouldn't notice ya?

367
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,666
Huh?

368
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,583
[MAN] Don't waste your time; we
got more important things to do.

00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,791
Get a move on!

[MOB MEMBER 4B]
Yeah, he's right.

00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,208
Are you okay?

374
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:56,541
Never better.

375
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:59,083
[WARBLER] Let's wait here
till things calm down.

376
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:00,250
[JEAN]
Mm.

377
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,041
[WARBLER]
Sorry to keep you waiting.

378
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:20,166
Inspection Department's fine.

379
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,375
We can't go back yet.

380
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,000
Whole area's still cordoned off.

381
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,041
Probably gonna be a while.

382
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:27,458
No thanks. I'm good.

383
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:30,250
You get a look at how
the commoners were doing?

384
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:31,500
They all right?

385
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,666
[WARBLER]
Few of 'em got away.

386
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,500
Mostly kids and women.

387
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,666
The leaders were
all captured, though.

388
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,916
Including Biscuit.

389
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,916
[JEAN]
Yeah, but he's with ACCA.

390
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,541
Right.

391
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:44,916
He'll be fine.

392
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,916
But you'll be charged
as an accomplice.

393
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,666
You don't spend four years here
without seeing some things.

394
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,083
It changes a man.

395
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:56,916
This kingdom has its share
of dirty little secrets.

396
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,583
The official line is
"peace and harmony."

397
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:01,916
Yeah, right.

398
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,625
You see a fair bit of this
country on your audits,

399
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:04,958
don't you?

400
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,500
You had to've known things
were coming to a head

401
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:08,583
in this district.

402
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,250
Is this your idea of peace?

403
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,375
I'd never really seen things

404
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:16,458
from the citizens'
point of view.

405
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,000
[WARBLER]
Naturally.

406
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,541
ACCA's presence
here is different

407
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,458
than in most other
parts of the kingdom.

408
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,708
The Suitsu brass are
all lesser nobles,

409
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:28,333
while the Branch staff
are mostly commoners.

410
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:31,500
But neither can provoke
change without catching hell.

411
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,666
The higher-ranking gentry
keep their subordinates

412
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,250
on a pretty tight leash.

413
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:40,416
Trust me, we tempted
revolution before tonight.

414
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,791
The problem is

415
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,958
word never seems to
make it to the outside world.

416
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,875
That's Suitsu for you, though.

417
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,291
When I caught wind of
Biscuit and the others,

418
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:53,250
I wanted to help them
do something positive.

419
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,208
They're a motley crew, sure,

420
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,791
but they love this place
with all their heart.

421
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:00,208
I feel for them.

422
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:02,916
[JEAN] So what I'm hearing is
that being stationed here

423
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,791
gave you a sense of purpose.

424
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,375
[WARBLER]
I'll be thrown to the wolves

425
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:13,125
Unless you're nice
enough to let me run.

426
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:14,791
Once I cross that border,

427
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:17,250
I'll never be able to come
back to Suitsu again.

428
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,416
You made it out!

429
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,875
The women and children,
are they...?

430
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,125
They're all right.

431
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:25,458
Thank heavens.

432
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,625
Issue a gag order!

433
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:30,250
But what about the inspector?

434
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,750
A coup during
an audit, damn it all!

435
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:33,958
Branch Director, sir.

436
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,166
What would you advise?

437
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,375
[BRANCH DIRECTOR 4A]
Tread lightly.

438
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:38,791
We don't want to be
on Jean Otus's bad side.

439
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,208
Go. Bring the man here.

440
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:44,958
I shall speak to him personally.

441
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,041
Sir!

442
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:49,250
[BRANCH DIRECTOR 4A] I'd like
to take this opportunity

443
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:50,833
to speak with you
about a coup d'état

444
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:55,166
rather different in scope
than the one attempted here.

445
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:59,166
On condition that you forget
what you witnessed last night.

446
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,750
[JEAN]
Is this a gag order?

447
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,041
Call it what you like,

448
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,625
but I can't let you leave
until we're assured

449
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,458
of your silence.

450
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,000
Will it bother
you if I smoke?

451
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,708
--Bastard!
--Not at all.

452
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:17,041
If word gets out,
it won't've been me.

453
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:20,083
I do have one tiny
condition, though.

454
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,875
And that would be?

455
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:24,583
Everyone involved in
the coup gets released.

456
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,083
Immediately.

457
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:27,625
[BRANCH CHIEF 4A gasps]

458
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:28,750
Very well.

459
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:31,291
We shall turn a blind eye.
This time.

460
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,500
But I'm afraid the
officer implicated

461
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:36,166
will be forced to resign.

462
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,666
Who gets fired is
your prerogative, sir.

463
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,375
[JEAN] No one ordered
to put down the rebellion

464
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:44,875
used weapons against
their fellow countrymen.

465
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:47,333
Strikes me as a decent
measure of solidarity.

466
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,375
You're all in it together.

467
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:51,791
Whatever side of
the fight you're on,

468
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,000
you'll never let it
collapse into bloodshed.

469
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:58,916
Kinda sucks no one
will ever know about it.

470
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,791
Meaning...
HQ won't get a report.

471
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,708
Your job is safe, Warbler.

472
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:08,083
[WARBLER]
Thank you.

473
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,208
Though when I'm up for
reassignment next term,

474
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:12,166
I intend to resign from my post.

475
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,875
Till things improve,
the people will rise up.

476
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:19,208
I want to be on the
right side of history.

477
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:20,958
There're worse places, I guess.

478
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:25,083
And no offense, but to be
honest, you tanked the audit.

479
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:26,250
You're a good man,

480
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,916
but you're just not
supervisor material.

481
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,541
I had to give you low marks.

482
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,541
You're too involved
in the community.

483
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,916
Makes you miss
important details.

484
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,375
Too busy staring
out the window.

485
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:41,875
Looks like it's back
to the drawing board

486
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:43,791
on finding my replacement.

487
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,541
Just my luck.

488
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:47,333
You probably wouldn't
want the job anyway.

489
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:50,375
It's a lot more hassle
than it used to be.

490
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:51,916
Better if you stay here.

491
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:03,250
Warbler, they'll let you stay?

492
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:04,416
That's great news!

493
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:07,458
We need you in the
trenches with us, buddy!

494
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:08,500
[WARBLER]
Yeah.

495
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:19,125
[GROSSULAR]
Yes, I know.

496
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:22,250
I have a report that says he
was given a cigarette in Suitsu.

497
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:24,958
I beg your pardon?

498
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:26,791
Can we not meet
and discuss this?

499
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:09,291
[NINO]
Good work, Jean.

500
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:10,916
I see what you did there.

501
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,041
Well played.

502
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:15,291
[NINO]
Next time on <i>ACCA:</i>

503
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:17,583
<i>Thirteen Territory</i>
<i>Inspection Department</i> :

504
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:19,791
"Overlapping Footprints
in the Distance."
