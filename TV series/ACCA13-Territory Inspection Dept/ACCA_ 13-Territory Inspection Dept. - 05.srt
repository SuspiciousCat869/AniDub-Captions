1
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:14,125
[SCHWAN]
What?!

2
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:16,083
Magie left DMwfor where?

3
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:18,166
[MOND] Bon, Your Highness.
Just a bit ago.

4
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,583
[SCHWAN]
That insolent fool!

5
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:23,041
How dare an aide leave without
my express permission?

6
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:25,166
He said something
about a crucial job.

7
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,583
Reconnaissance, I believe.

8
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:29,708
[MAGIE] Mochi ice cream?
Are you kidding?

9
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:31,666
That imbecile let
food distract her

10
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:32,875
from the mission at hand?

11
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:35,458
[MOND]
Run into trouble, Magie?

12
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:37,458
Hello, Commander.

13
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:40,166
It's nothing, just vexed
with a subordinate.

14
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,125
Hmm. Secret mission
gone belly up, has it?

15
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:46,375
My, must've been
an important one.

16
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:47,583
Indeed, sir.

17
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:49,125
I would say so.

18
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:50,833
Yes, well, what's
the old saying?

19
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:54,083
"If a man wants something done
right, he must do it himself."

20
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:55,416
[MOND]
Your Highness.

21
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,625
Whatever his reasons,
I'm sure they were sound.

22
00:01:00,958 --> 00:01:02,416
[SCHWAN]
Find out who she is.

23
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:06,750
[LOTTA]
Oh, my gosh!

24
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:10,416
Perfection!

25
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,208
Seriously, are there better
pancakes anywhere in the world?

26
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,583
[LOTTA]
Thanks, it was great!

27
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:19,583
[WAITRESS 5A]
Come back soon!

28
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:20,666
[LOTTA]
Definitely!

29
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:30,000
[RAIL]
Nice get-up.

30
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:33,458
I'm gonna go out
on a limb and say

31
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:36,208
you're with the girl
who's been stalking Lotta.

32
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:39,583
'Kay, so how 'bout you tell me
where all this is going?

33
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:42,333
Sorry, I'm a little
preoccupied at the moment.

34
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:43,333
[WAITRESS 5A]
Second helping.

35
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:44,958
Sorry it took so long.

36
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:47,375
[MAGIE] Right now,
this is going in my stomach.

37
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:49,041
Apparently it's called "toast."

38
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:52,291
Crisp on the outside, yet
fluffy and delicious inside.

39
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:56,750
Absolutely marvelous.

40
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:59,125
What sort of dough responds
to heat in this way?

41
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:01,041
[RAIL]
Sandwich bread.

42
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:02,125
Sorry, what?

43
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:04,125
[RAIL]
It's grilled sandwich bread.

44
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:06,416
I've not heard of it.

45
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,375
What an ingenious confection.

46
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:11,250
By comparison DMws
bread is made of stone.

47
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:13,333
I must take note.

48
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:15,000
Look, tell you what.

49
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:17,083
There's a west-sector joint
that does sandwich bread

50
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:19,000
if you're interested. I could...

51
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:21,166
You'd be willing to
take me to this place?

52
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,291
Yeah, sure.

53
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,333
Been meaning to
check it out myself.

54
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:06,500
[OWL]
How was Suitsu, Jean? Good?

55
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,750
[JEAN]
Same old, same old.

56
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:11,291
That reminds me.
Their supervisor, Warbler?

57
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:14,333
I probably spoke too soon
about him being my replacement.

58
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:15,916
I don't think he's ready.

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,625
[OWL]
Did something happen?

60
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,458
Nah, just a feeling y'know?

61
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,041
If you say so.

62
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:24,125
Well, even if it is possible
for you to step down,

63
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:25,791
it'll be a while, I'm sure.

64
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,416
Think the brass'll
approve my transfer

65
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,708
once the audits are done?

66
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,708
It has been out there
for a while now.

67
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:32,583
They gotta let me go
sooner or later.

68
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,875
Heh. Yeah, one would think.

69
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,416
Forgive me, Jean,

70
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,000
but I would imagine leaving
might put you in a tight spot.

71
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,125
Not really.

72
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,041
You know the districts.
They're your beat.

73
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:47,250
Jean, if you hear anything
more than talk,

74
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:50,000
I need to know about it.
Off the record.

75
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:54,041
[JEAN] Can't tell her
about the fiasco in Suitsu,

76
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,833
but I have to
tell her something.

77
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:04,208
[LILIUM]
You look paler than usual.

78
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:05,458
So what's up?

79
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:08,208
Did Crow's report give
you cause for concern?

80
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,166
No, nothing worth
sharing, gentlemen.

81
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,166
Rest assured.

82
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,333
Impressive.

83
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:16,375
Agent Crow managed
to infiltrate Suitsu?

84
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:17,583
Seems he did.

85
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:25,083
Think I'll take the subway
instead of the bus today.

86
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,291
Care for a ride?

87
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:37,458
[LILIUM]
How are things in Suitsu?

88
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:39,958
I hear you had to stay
a bit longer than planned.

89
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:42,833
So, anything out of
the ordinary there?

90
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:45,666
Nothing in particular.

91
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,541
Grossular isn't keen
on sharing the intel

92
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,250
his agent provides him.

93
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,416
Where you go, his man goes.

94
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,416
But it's easier to ask
you myself, right?

95
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,000
Someone's watching me?

96
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,333
Yes. An agent's been
assigned to observe you.

97
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:00,333
Grossular arranged
it a month ago.

98
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:04,041
Can't believe I
didn't notice. Weird.

99
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:10,583
So about the
whole coup d'état.

100
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:12,458
I take it you're still
convinced that Grossular's

101
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:14,500
behind it somehow?

102
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:18,666
I know he rubs you the wrong
way and all, it's just...

103
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,125
Please, go on.

104
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:23,250
Well, I just don't see
the connection, y'know?

105
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,208
What does he stand to gain?

106
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:26,375
Huh.

107
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:27,541
Tell me, Jean:

108
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,541
Am I listening to your
honest assessment,

109
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:31,958
or merely someone
else's opinion?

110
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:36,708
I ask because Grossular
is an impenetrable man.

111
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,750
It's impossible for
the other Chief Officers

112
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:41,916
to get a read, and we've tried.

113
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,958
But I'll give you the
benefit of the doubt.

114
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:45,833
Perhaps he deserves
a closer look.

115
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:51,250
So about this observer
he's got tailing me.

116
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,416
Is it an agent of ACCA?

117
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,541
Someone with Internal Affairs.

118
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:01,625
[LILIUM] Have you sensed
anyone watching you?

119
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:03,958
No, not in the past month.

120
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:06,250
I shouldn't find
that to be a shock.

121
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,291
It's someone to whose
scrutiny you've most likely

122
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:11,041
grown rather... accustomed.

123
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,708
[JEAN]
Watching me...

124
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:37,791
He's not coming.

125
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,333
Potatoes!

126
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:42,000
Let's make potato chips!

127
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,791
Yes! Microwavable!

128
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,041
So, Eider.

129
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,083
Came all the way from
Fasu District, huh?

130
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,166
Yeah.

131
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,333
Still had some
paperwork to fill out

132
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:51,875
about my staffer's
ethics violation, so...

133
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,875
I was hoping to say
hello to the Deputy Chief,

134
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:55,666
but I guess he's out?

135
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,000
Oh.

136
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:59,041
Yeah, Jean left for Birra
District this morning.

137
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,583
Dang it. Ugh.

138
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:02,958
Uh-oh.

139
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:04,666
What's the matter, Eider?
You're not sweet on the guy?

140
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,833
Um... no!

141
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:09,083
[LOTTA] Yeah, it's crazy
how busy they're keeping him.

142
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,791
He already left town
for his next audit.

143
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:12,833
Hey... you, uh...

144
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:14,791
...wanna grab some dinner?

145
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:17,083
[NINO] Sorry. Can't tonight.
I'm swamped.

146
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:20,375
Aw, how come everybody's
working so hard?

147
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,541
Where are you?

148
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,041
[NINO]
It's classified.

149
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:30,458
[NINO] They've put him up
in the district's best hotel.

150
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,166
He's here for five days.

151
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,583
Longer than the other districts
because of slower travel times.

152
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:42,625
[NINO] Huh.
What's he waiting for?

153
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:45,750
Heh. Don't tell me the idiot's
gonna have a cigarette.

154
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:52,041
[DUNLIN]
Um, Deputy Chief?

155
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,583
You'll catch cold if you
stand out here too long.

156
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,166
[JEAN]
Yeah. Sorry.

157
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,500
Okay...

158
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:05,833
Did he just...?

159
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:21,125
[MAN] If he's on to you,
we have no choice.

160
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,333
Tell him what he needs to know.

161
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,291
Get a sense of where he stands.

162
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:30,916
Alternatively, you can leave
without breathing a word.

163
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,083
Either way this does
not mean your duties

164
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,500
are at an end.

165
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:37,250
The nature of your role
will change, but that's all.

166
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:40,125
From now on,
you'll only be his friend.

167
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:46,541
[DUNLIN]
Good morning, sir!

168
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:47,666
The sun's out!

169
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:50,250
I feel bad the only
thing we could give you

170
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:51,500
to deal with the
weather yesterday

171
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,541
was a lousy pair of boots.

172
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,458
[JEAN]
Well, surprise visit.

173
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,458
So today I've borrowed
a full compliment of gear

174
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:58,958
from the branch office!

175
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,375
[JEAN]
It's warm.

176
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:04,958
Oh, tonight for dinner,
you'll be enjoying

177
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:07,666
traditional Birra cuisine
with the Branch Chief.

178
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,958
Well, let's get started.

179
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:12,791
[JEAN]
Sure.

180
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:16,041
[BAKER 5A] Nice of you to stop
by so often on your visit.

181
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,625
Someone has quite the
taste for sandwich bread, eh?

182
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,125
The azuki bean, too, please.

183
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:21,625
[LOTTA]
Hi again!

184
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,166
[BAKER 5A]
Hello, Lotta.

185
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,583
What'll it be today, love?

186
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,625
Three two-centimeter
slices, thank you.

187
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:29,083
Cheese, walnut, and chocolate!

188
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:33,958
Hello. Have we met?

189
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,708
Are you fond of sandwich bread?

190
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:36,875
You bet I am!

191
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:37,833
What about you?

192
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:39,125
Absolutely. Yes.

193
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,875
Well, theirs is
the best in town!

194
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,083
[DUNLIN]
Birra Branch is nice.

195
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:46,000
My fourth assignment,
as a matter of fact.

196
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,791
[DUNLIN] Compared to other
places I've been stationed,

197
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:50,583
operations here
run pretty smoothly.

198
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,250
There's a lot of trade
with other districts,

199
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:53,750
so the standard of
living's higher than in,

200
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,666
say, Suitsu.

201
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,333
Not that we're anywhere
near as prosperous

202
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:58,750
as Fasu.

203
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:01,708
But folks here take pride
in being self-sufficient.

204
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,250
On balance, it's a stable place.

205
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:07,166
Birra's admin runs like
a well-oiled machine.

206
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,958
Each district has
its own character, huh?

207
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,500
That's the truth.

208
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:14,708
But then again, everybody thinks
their district is the best.

209
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,541
Just human nature, I s'pose.

210
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:21,041
[GRUS]
Eider! You're in town?

211
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,041
Hey!

212
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,500
I was just about
to leave actually.

213
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:27,375
I heard about the
whole Fasu mess.

214
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:29,583
I imagine it's been
difficult for you.

215
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:30,666
[EIDER sighs]

216
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,875
A word of advice
from someone who's been

217
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,333
in the same boat?

218
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:34,666
Don't blame yourself.

219
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,541
It wasn't your fault.

220
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:39,208
Your superiors are the ones
who deserve the blame.

221
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:41,000
Thank you, but that's not...

222
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,208
[GRUS]
Huh?

223
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:43,875
I come all this way
and the Deputy Chief's

224
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,208
on a business trip?!

225
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:48,000
Why am I cursed
with such rotten luck?

226
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,666
Damn it to hell,
why isn't he here?!

227
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:54,916
[GRUS] Hey, uh, let's grab
some lunch, my treat?

228
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,583
[PERRY] I understand
you like wheat bread,

229
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,500
so by all means...

230
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:01,541
I made it a point to
have some on hand.

231
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,541
Wheat doesn't do
well in this climate.

232
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:06,208
All the beer we have
is imported, too.

233
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,125
'Course, we are known
to grow a little barley

234
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:11,250
in these parts,
but most of that's for export.

235
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:14,875
With food and drink,
we stick to what we make here.

236
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:18,041
We eat potatoes,
enjoy a nice rye bread,

237
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:20,208
stay warm by the wood fire.

238
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:22,541
A modest bounty,
but more than adequate

239
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,375
for supporting our citizens.

240
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:28,666
For us, the simple
pleasures of mountain life

241
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,833
are what gives Birra its charm.

242
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:34,291
That said, we're keenly aware
of the widening political gap

243
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:35,583
between districts.

244
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,458
If one grows to
dominate the rest,

245
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:40,375
it bodes ill for
our independence.

246
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:43,166
We'd be fools to ignore
the writing on the wall.

247
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,541
Why else make the most
of our yearly budget?

248
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:48,250
Not to mention
our allotment of oil.

249
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:51,000
Wouldn't want the other
districts to leave us behind.

250
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,500
Bah. Listen to me droning on.

251
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:57,750
You're welcome to indulge your
vice at the bar if you like.

252
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,083
[JEAN]
I think I will.

253
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:09,416
Sorry to intrude.

254
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,791
Another customer asked if
I'd mind giving you this.

255
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:25,000
Excuse me, but is
this a Birra cigarette?

256
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,083
Can't say it is.

257
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,083
We don't manufacture any.

258
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:31,000
Fact, you're the only smoker
I've met in forever.

259
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,125
Magie, darling, what is this?

260
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:46,958
[MAGIE]
Sandwich bread, Your Highness.

261
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,041
Try it.

And...?

263
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I recommend using butter.

264
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:01,125
You know good and well
I prefer my bread dense.

265
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,791
[MAGIE]
Then try the walnut bread,

266
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,416
a souvenir from my
sojourn in Bon.

267
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,875
[SCHWAN] Have you listened
to a word I've said?!

268
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:10,125
This display will not
earn my forgiveness!

[toaster dings]

271
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:15,750
That means it's ready.

"Toast," they call it.

273
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:20,125
[SCHWAN] What exactly are
you trying to accomplish?

274
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:22,750
This comes recommended by Lotta.

275
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:25,000
The young lady you've
taken a fancy to.

276
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,291
A-ha!

277
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:28,625
And what did you learn
of her on your travels?

278
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:31,333
She resides in a high-rise
in the heart of Bon

279
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:34,208
and has a passion
for sandwich bread.

280
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,041
And?

281
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,375
That is all.

282
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,916
To win her heart,
you must open a bakery

283
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,083
in DMwthat makes
sandwich bread.

284
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:46,041
Enough with her preferences
in baked goods!

285

One moment, she lives
in a high-rise?

What do her parents
do for a living?

287
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:52,583
I shall find out.

bread enthusiasts.

Don't you think that'd
make her happy?

Oh, dear.

puts a bow on it, I think.

you might already have plans.

been waiting on a call.

my ass back in Suitsu.

but I knew you sounded familiar.

important things to do.

320
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:46,125
I realize now I've
heard that voice before.

321
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:47,916
Lots of times.

322
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,291
You've been hidin' in the wings
just about anywhere I go.

323
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,333
And not just for
the past few weeks.

324
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:57,041
So, my best friend
works for ACCA, does he?

325
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:00,708
I do.

326
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:02,250
[JEAN]
Figures.

327
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:03,458
I'll level with you, Nino:

328
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:05,208
I'm not quite sure
what I'm caught up in

329
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,375
or how I got here.

330
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:09,375
Can you give me a clue?

331
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,041
Best I can tell, you're
just the sort of guy

332
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,916
who gets caught up
in these things.

333
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,541
[JEAN]
'Cause here's what I think.

334
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:19,333
I think you're the sort of guy
who'd try not to drag me

335
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,833
further in if he can help it,
orders be damned.

336
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,125
Do me a favor.

337
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,791
Promise me you'll fill in
the blanks someday

338
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,416
when you're able.

339
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,833
[NINO chuckles]

340
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:38,125
You're up to your eyeballs
and you couldn't care less.

341
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:41,125
That's my Jean. Heh.

342
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:42,416
Yeah, I work for ACCA,

343
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,500
but they're not who
I'm watching you for.

344
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:48,875
[NINO] That's all I'm at
liberty to say right now.

345
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:50,833
Okay. Fine.

346
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:52,125
I head back tomorrow.

347
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:53,958
Lotta hates when
I'm gone this long.

348
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:56,541
I owe her a nice meal
when I get home.

349
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,166
Be nice to have you there.

350
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:02,791
You believe this snow?

351
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:03,833
[NINO]
Here.

352
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,750
What is that, Birran liquor?

353
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,208
Sure, maybe just a nip.

354
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:09,708
You know me n' booze.

355
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,583
[JEAN]
It just occured to me.

356
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,875
We drink together
every chance we get.

357
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,208
Seems like you're
always egging me on

358
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:20,000
to go another round.

359
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:23,333
So do I, like, tell you
things when I'm drunk?

360
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:24,833
What sort of things?

361
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:28,916
[NINO] If you mean about
Director General Mauve...

362
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,583
You never shut up.

363
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,125
Apparently she
has a lot of respect

364
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:35,541
for Chief Officer Grosslar,
which isn't big a a shock.

365
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,500
Funny what folks
say over drinks.

366
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,833
You like Grossular, too,
'least when you're lit. Heh.

367
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,833
I really need
to watch my mouth.

368
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:52,041
[LOTTA]
Nino!

369
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:54,291
Where do you find these places?

370
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:56,291
Everything's so good!

371
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:59,166
'Course I guess it helps
that we're eating together.

372
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,833
That reminds me.

373
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:04,083
Are you planning on stopping by
the west-sector bakery later?

374
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,208
Our bread here must
be a li'l slice o' heaven

375
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,583
after the rocks you've
had to eat on your audits.

376
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:12,333
The food hasn't been
that bad, actually.

377
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:15,250
I have another audit on Friday.

378
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,083
[NINO] When everyone
else is on vacation?

379
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,208
That sucks.

380
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,000
Hey, do me a favor
while I'm gone, huh?

381
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:25,458
Treat Lotta to a nice
dinner every night.

382
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:26,583
You don't mind.

383
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,333
No, sure.

384
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:31,166
You'd do that?

385
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,583
Oh, Nino!

386
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:35,000
So, where are they
sending you this time?

387
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:38,750
[JEAN]
Rokkusu District.

388
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:42,458
No rest for the wicked,
am I right, Deputy Chief?

389
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:45,125
[JEAN] Mm. I'll ease up
on the smoke breaks

390
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:47,750
so we can try to wrap
this up early.

391
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:48,708
Yeah?

392
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:50,125
You really mean that?

393
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:51,625
Heh, the drive'll
go so much faster

394
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:53,416
without you stopping to smoke!

395
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,166
[chuckling]

396
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,583
[JEAN] Wasn't that you
who got top marks

397
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,708
on Inspection's entrance
exam, or am I thinkin'

398
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:00,291
--of someone else?
--Yeah, that was me,

399
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,166
but that's how
our department is.

400
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,125
Some of us just look
too pretty for bureaucracy!

401
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:06,458
You know what I'm sayin'!

402
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:07,875
[chuckling]

403
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,541
[JEAN]
Let's go.

404
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,875
[SANDPIPER]
Aye aye, cap'n!

405
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:18,041
[SANDPIPER whistling]

406
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:21,208
Sorta trippy at first, yeah?

407
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:23,916
S'like an alternate
universe full o' Groschlers.

408
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,708
It's customary in Rokkusu for
men to wear their hair long.

409
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:29,291
It's a decent look,
so I figured, what the heck?

410
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:33,666
[SANDPIPER] That was the
real Grossular, by the way.

411
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,541
He came back yesterday, I think.

412
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,916
Weird how he blends in
with the scenery, huh?

413
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,708
His commanding presence
gives him away, though.

414
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:43,916
[JEAN] Huh. First time I've
seen him out of uniform.

415
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,291
[PASTIS]
Chief Officer Lilium.

416
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,625
Chief Officer Pastis.

417
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:56,166
I was under the impression
you flew home yesterday.

418
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,041
Yes, that was the original plan.

419
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,791
But I thought it best
to wait one more day.

420
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:03,625
[sighs] When in the business
of protecting one's district,

421
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:06,291
one must take care
to be above suspicion.

422
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:07,833
Don't you agree?

423
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,250
"One's district," you say?

424
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:10,958
And not "your nation?" 

425
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:13,958
I'm merely respecting
your aversion to the word.

426
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:16,708
You've been speaking with
my brother, haven't you?

427
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:18,083
[PASTIS laughs]

428
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:19,958
You're not the only
one who takes pride

429
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:21,833
in being a Chief Officer.

430
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:24,208
Though your pride
does take the cake.

431
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:28,041
Oh, now surely it pales in
comparison to Grossular's.

432
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:31,208
His passion for ACCA
clearly knows no bounds.

433
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,166
He cares for it
more than anything.

434
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,500
His is hardly the minority
opinion in that regard.

435
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:39,250
Director General Mauve
springs to mind.

436
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:42,625
Hmph. Zeal for one's work
is by and large a good thing.

437
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:43,916
[LILIUM]
Yes.

438
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,375
Provided it's not excessive.

439
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:47,375
[LOTTA]
Hi, Jean.

440
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:48,750
Just thought I'd
call and say hey.

441
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:50,458
What're you up to?

442
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:52,875
Huh? Nothing in particular.

443
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,375
You're sure the train's
the only way there?

444
00:21:58,791 --> 00:21:59,875
'Kay.

445
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:01,291
Well, travel safe.

446
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:03,541
Oh, and don't forget to
bring me back something.

447
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:05,958
Right, let's eat!

448
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:09,458
[NINO]
He'll be fine, by the way.

449
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:12,125
After ACCA took
over the railways,

450
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:14,875
accidents dropped off
in record numbers.

451
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,291
[NINO]
Especially in Rokkusu.

Train Tracks Lead."

455
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:17,333
Heh. You really don't
give a damn, do you?

456
00:24:17,416 --> 00:24:19,666
Still, I'm glad it was you.
