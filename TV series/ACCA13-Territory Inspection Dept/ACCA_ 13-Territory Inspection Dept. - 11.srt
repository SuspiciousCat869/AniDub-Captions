1
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:16,333
[YOUNGER BROTHER] We're honored
to have someone of royal blood

2
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:17,541
in our district.

3
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:21,416
This is as glorious a
day for the Lilium family

4
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,833
as ever was, eh, dear brother?

5
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:25,916
Indeed.

6
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:32,125
Um...

7
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:34,208
You do realize I'm just
here in my capacity

8
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:36,333
as ACCA Inspector, right?

9
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:37,541
[OLDER BROTHER chuckles]

10
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:39,250
Then I suppose you'd
better get to work,

11
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:40,333
hadn't you?

12
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:42,125
[JEAN]
My colleagues are waiting.

13
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,250
At least have some
tea before you go.

14
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:46,708
An herbal blend made
from our local flora.

15
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:51,583
[JEAN]
Speaking of which,

16
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:54,041
I can't get over all the
flowers you have here.

17
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:56,000
[OLDER BROTHER] They're the
district's pride and joy.

18
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:58,333
Furawau is
incomparably beautiful,

19
00:00:58,416 --> 00:01:02,125
with delicate blooms as
far as the eye can see.

20
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,666
We find them essential--

21
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,500
a fair representation
of the people, in fact.

22
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:08,291
Elegant and cheerful.

23
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:09,708
[JEAN] Two words that
pretty much sum up

24
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:11,791
your District
Representative, huh?

25
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:14,208
Wouldn't surprise me
if you were related.

26
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:18,958
[OLDER BROTHER] He's only a
subordinate--but indispensable.

27
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:21,291
He seems more relaxed
here than in Bon.

28
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:24,000
Must be the easygoing
atmosphere I guess.

29
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:25,875
[OLDER BROTHER]
Almost certainly.

30
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:28,083
[JEAN] Is Chief Officer Lilium
a different sort of man

31
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:30,041
when he's home?

32
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:33,041
Hmm. Who could say
about that one, really?

33
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:35,666
He always takes
himself so seriously.

34
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,750
Rather makes him stand out.

35
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:39,458
Among the three of us, I mean.

36
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:40,916
So driven.

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,750
Embarked for the capital of
his own accord, you know.

38
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:46,458
He can be stiff, but
his love for this country

39
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:48,333
runs unquestionably deep.

40
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:52,000
[CANARII]
Welcome, sir.

41
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:53,625
[JEAN]
Sorry I kept you waiting.

42
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:55,000
Thank you, though.

43
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:56,666
Oh, my pleasure.

44
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:44,791
[JEAN] The residents look
upbeat, I'll give 'em that.

45
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:48,333
But I get the feeling
it's all for show.

46
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:50,333
The total opposite of Pranetta.

47
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:54,041
Something wrong?

48
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,958
[JEAN] Just struck me
how well you fit in here.

49
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:56,875
Huh?

50
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:59,083
[JEAN]
You're always smiling.

51
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:00,916
I suppose being
surrounded by flowers

52
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,416
has that effect on a guy.

53
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,541
Makes me feel,
I dunno, peaceful.

54
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,625
[JEAN] He's getting
reassigned to Yakkara soon.

55
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,166
I wonder if he'll adjust.

56
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:16,333
[ASSASSIN 11A]
This way!

57
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,791
[ASSASSIN 11B]
You know where the target is?

58
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,625
[ASSASSIN 11A]
The District Chief's estate.

59
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:26,000
He might stay the night;
he might go back to his hotel.

60
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,125
I don't know.

61
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:30,375
[ASSASSIN 11B] How the hell
are we supposed to lure him

62
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,125
to an isolated spot?

63
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:36,041
[ASSASSIN 11A] Eh.
We can't risk any witnesses.

64
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,333
There'll be an
opening at some point.

65
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:39,041
There has to be.

66
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,208
We'll wait.

67
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:41,833
No more mistakes.

68
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,791
Where was the audit
prior to this?

69
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,333
Pranetta District.

70
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:50,708
Ah, so right next door, then.

71
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:54,125
[JEAN] Drastic change of
scenery for being so close.

72
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,875
We have our share of desert.

73
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:59,000
Mostly on the outskirts,
where the borders meet.

74
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,333
Once you've gone that far,

75
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,708
there's no much of anything
worthwhile to mine.

76
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,041
Furuwau's native resources

77
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:08,833
tend to be concentrated beneath
the southwestern seabed,

78
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:09,916
you see.

79
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,500
But we feel for Pranetta.

80
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:14,333
Its citizens' lives
must be difficult.

81
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:16,250
Though, it's a shame more funds

82
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:19,083
weren't allocated to
improve their cities.

83
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,833
Might've made it a more
agreeable place to live.

84
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:24,000
[OLDER BROTHER] Can their
leaders be so arrogant?

85
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,166
No.

86
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,625
The citizens choose
to live how they do.

87
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,333
Fascinating.

88
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:31,666
Well it can't be said their
ambitions don't reflect

89
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,708
Furawau's own in
one important respect.

90
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:35,916
[JEAN]
Is that so?

91
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,833
[chuckles]

92
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:40,083
You see, over 90%
of the country's oil

93
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:41,500
is produced right here.

94
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:44,208
One might even say
we keep DMwrunning.

95
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,958
Our people take inestimable
pride in that fact.

96
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:51,083
What we produce,
the entire nation uses.

97
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,916
Furawau keeps all
of DMwin oil.

98
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,708
We are its backbone.

99
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,583
[ALTAIR] If we do happen to
find something one day,

100
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,208
we'd be glad to share it.

101
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,000
Of course we would.

102
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:05,708
But there's a difference between
sharing and having it taken

103
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:08,041
right out from under you.

104
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,291
Furawau's resources
flowed into DMw

105
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:13,666
before the current political
system was founded.

106
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,291
Now, they're compelled
to share what they have.

107
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:19,666
How could any self-respecting
district not resent that?

108
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,041
What do you think?

109
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,750
Shall we present it to him now?

110
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:28,708
Indeed.

111
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,125
Have you had enough to eat?

112
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,125
[JEAN]
Yeah.

113
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:32,291
Very well.

114
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:33,958
Let us change venues.

115
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,083
[JEAN]
So, about the coup d'état then.

116
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:46,208
Furawau's leading it?

117
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,666
Yes, we are.

118
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,708
I assume you'll take part?

119
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:51,666
Being the focal point,
as it were.

120
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,000
[ASSASSIN 11B]
Look. There's the car.

121
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,333
This is it.

122
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:01,708
Wait. Let him get out first.

123
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:05,666
Steady. We screw this up,
our lives are forfeit.

124
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,375
[ASSASSIN 11A]
We kill him and disappear.

125
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,208
No need for this
to be complicated.

126
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:14,541
[ASSASSIN 11A]
Son of a--!

127
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:15,958
[ASSASSIN 11B]
Take the shot!

128
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:18,333
To hell with the
collateral damage!

129
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:19,666
Kill the bastard.

130
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,958
[NINO]
Jean!

131
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,583
[gunshots]

132
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:43,833
[JEAN]
Nino!

133
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,000
[CANARII]
He's been shot!

134
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,541
Call an ambulance!

135
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:49,208
[STAFF] We can't do that without
the Branch Chief's approval!

136
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:50,416
[CANARII]
There isn't time!

137
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,833
The man's bleeding out!

138
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,125
[STAFF]
Uh... Right!

139
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:57,166
[CANARII crying]

140
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,416
I don't get it.

141
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,375
Why would someone want
you dead, Deputy Chief?

142
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,958
And why--why do we have
to keep this a secret?

143
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:06,250
It doesn't make sense!

144
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:07,791
No choice.

145
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,500
It isn't my call.

146
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,208
It's the District Chief's.

147
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,333
[CANARII crying]

148
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:16,250
He's awake if you would
like to go and see him.

149
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,375
[JEAN]
Devil's luck.

150
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:25,666
[JEAN] This and the thing with
Lotta weren't a coincidence.

151
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,375
They were working
for the royal family?

152
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:29,541
Yeah.

153
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:32,083
[JEAN] Apparently they
killed themselves.

154
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:34,000
Must be more than two.

155
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:36,666
I wonder if anyone got away.

156
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,250
[JEAN]
Could be.

157
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,583
This is my first time here.

158
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:44,375
For some reason the supervisor
never let me come to Furawau.

159
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,583
I don't know why.

160
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,583
Yeah, but see...

161
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,875
I still work for 
the Five Chiefs.

162
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:54,000
So I'm on the job
here as Agent Crow.

163
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:56,416
Even followed my directive
not to harm anyone

164
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,875
connected to the Royal Family.

165
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:01,583
I think maybe a
commendation is in order.

166
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,791
You're chatty today.

167
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:05,458
Heh, Jean.

168
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:08,416
I can't tell whether you're
being dragged into all this

169
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,416
or if you're throwing yourself
in out of some sense of duty.

170
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,000
And it's not for me to say.

171
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,041
You just do your thing.

172
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:22,166
I'll do mine and watch over
you like I always have.

173
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,000
[JEAN]
Watch over me?

174
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:27,250
I think it's time
for that to stop.

175
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:31,458
It's not your place to
protect the Royal Family, Nino.

176
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:34,458
Seriously, that's not what
Lotta and I want from you.

177
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:41,916
[OLDER BROTHER]
Thank goodness!

178
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,083
You're all right!

179
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,166
I was honestly hoping
to avoid getting roped

180
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,791
into power politics.

181
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:52,375
But the people don't
want ACCA disbanded.

182
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,500
So...

183
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,125
[JEAN]
What we spoke about earlier?

184
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:57,208
I accept.

185
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,791
[OLDER BROTHER]
Given His Majesty's health,

186
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,625
time is of the essence.

187
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,375
Once you've returned to Bon,

188
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:06,833
we ask that you meet with
our brother right away.

189
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,541
[SCHWAN]
Why would I want to go to Bon?

190
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:12,958
I refuse.

191
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,500
[MAGIE] His Majesty's not
able to leave the castle.

192
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,333
You are to attend in his stead.

193
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:20,250
As his successor you
must think of appearances.

194
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,500
[SCHWAN sighs]

195
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,708
What am I attending?

196
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:26,208
[MAGIE] ACCA's Centennial
Ceremony of course.

197
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,791
No scheduled
meetings whatsoever,

198
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:33,291
and I shall leave directly
following the ceremony.

199
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:35,500
[MAGIE] Not before sampling
their authentic sandwich bread,

200
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:36,583
I hope.

201
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:40,833
[SCHWAN]
Oh, get over it!

202
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:10,416
[LILIUM] I understand Crow
proved something of a hero.

203
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,208
How is he?

204
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:13,458
[JEAN]
Better, I think.

205
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:15,833
Not good enough
to leave Furawau yet,

206
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:18,875
but for all I know he'll stay
even after he's healed up.

207
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,250
I see.

208
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:23,375
And yet he has other
responsibilities, does he not?

209
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:26,791
Forgive me. I'm prying.

210
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:29,958
Let us look forward,
both to your health

211
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:32,458
and your newfound resolve.

212
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:35,666
How many cigarettes did
you collect, by the way?

213
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,166
I spread word
among the districts

214
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,291
that support for our efforts
would be indicated

215
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,791
by offering a cigarette
to the heir.

216
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:45,791
Huh... Thirteen. Even DMw

217
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:48,166
[JEAN] Probably the
Branch Chief's decision.

218
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,875
I doubt the
Privy Council President

219
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:51,958
had anything to do with it.

220
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:55,125
We won't know until the day
of the Centennial celebration,

221
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:59,083
when we see the number of
guards at His Highness's side.

222
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,125
You're a clever man.

223
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:01,541
What's your take?

224
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,541
Do the people of this country
long to see Jean Otus

225
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:05,291
ascend to the throne?

226
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,125
I don't think it has to be me,

227
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:09,458
so long as it
isn't Prince Schwan.

228
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,958
[LILIUM]
But it does have to be you.

229
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,958
Only you can protect
ACCA, and by extension,

230
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,791
the people's best interests.

231
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:20,000
If the coup d'état
is successful,

232
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:22,583
if the rightful heir
assumes his role,

233
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:24,750
the citizens will breathe
easy knowing that life

234
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:27,750
will go on as it has.

235
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,916
To preserving the status quo.

236
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:33,166
You needn't worry, my friend.

237
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:36,666
After all, you're hardly
in this alone.

238
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,958
In the end,
it's all for the best.

239
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:41,875
[JEAN]
Yeah, so...

240
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:43,875
Sorry to keep asking you.

241
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:46,875
Hey, it's fine. No big deal.

242
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:48,666
I'm just surprised you
wanted me to look after her

243
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,416
in the first place.

244
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,166
Hey, while I'm in Furawau.

245
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,458
Wouldja keep an eye
on Lotta for me?

246
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,333
[RAIL]
Hm?!

247
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,916
I mean nothing really
happened last time.

248
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,125
I appreciate it.

249
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,708
So what are you gonna do?

250
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:07,041
You got royal blood
in your veins, right?

251
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,958
You're older than
that idiot prince.

252
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,250
Maybe you should
sit on the throne.

253
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,791
What if I do just that?

254
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:19,333
You'd be a lot better
than that moron.

255
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:22,291
[JEAN] Hmm.
Guess you have a point.

256
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:23,333
[RAIL]
Ah?

257
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:27,541
[REPORTER 11A] Lot of
important folks dropping in

258
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,250
on Bon this weekend.

259
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,291
ACCA's Centennial
celebration will be held

260
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,666
at the central
district branch plaza.

261
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,541
And it's gonna be big.

262
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,708
Representatives from
all thirteen districts...

263
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:40,958
[LOTTA] His Majesty's not well
enough to be there, right?

264
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,250
Prince Schwan's
coming in his place.

265
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:46,708
[LOTTA] So, uh, are civilians
allowed to attend or...?

266
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:50,791
[LOTTA]
What's wrong, Jean?

267
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,458
You seem preoccupied.

268
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,458
Nothing sleep won't fix.

269
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:58,458
[knock on door]

270
00:13:58,541 --> 00:13:59,333
[GRUS]
Excuse me.

271
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:00,583
[door opens]

272
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:03,750
[chattering]

273
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,333
You're all here early.

274
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:06,750
[LOCUSTELLA]
Maybe your timing's a little off

275
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,375
because you're so close by.

276
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:10,125
No offense, of course.

277
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:12,416
[GRUS] I see we're still
waiting on a few colleagues--

278
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,083
Warbler, Parus, and, um, Eider.

279
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:16,708
[ATRI] Give 'em a break.
They have, like, a full day

280
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:18,208
of travel.

281
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,625
In Suitsu it takes
forever just to leave.

282
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,291
[GRUS]
Whoa. Your hair got long.

283
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:23,625
[PARUS]
Hello-hello!

284
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:25,333
[EIDER]
Hi, everybody!

285
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,250
[MOZ]
Parus! Eider!

286
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,500
[PASSER]
Eider, finally!

287
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:30,875
We've been waiting
for you to get here!

288
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:31,958
Excuse us.

289
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:34,416
What's going on?

290
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,583
[PASSER]
Fess up.

291
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,750
You've got a thing
for the Deputy Chief!

292
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,500
[EIDER] Uh...
Wait a sec, you think I--?

293
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,625
[KELI] Oh, c'mon, there's
no point trying to hide it!

294
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,708
[MOZ] You came all this way
to see him that one time.

295
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:45,291
[EIDER]
Well, yeah.

296
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:50,333
I mean, I did, but that was--
I didn't, that is to say--now...

297
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:52,166
Those ladies do
love their gossip.

298
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,250
I dunno, I think it's cute.

299
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:58,625
[GROUP]
What? You're dating Agent Grus?

300
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:01,583
[EIDER] He was a really
good listener, y'know?

301
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:05,458
One thing led to
another, then... yeah.

302
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,166
[PASSER] But Bon and
Fasu might as well

303
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,750
be different planets!

304
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:12,000
[chuckles] Hey, long distance
is the way to go, huh?

305
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:13,583
Uhh...

306
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:15,625
I'll have you know we're both
looking into getting reassigned

307
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,041
to be a bit closer.

308
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,666
[FALCO]
About that...

309
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,875
I hear the Deputy Chief's
post is up for grabs.

310
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:25,000
Warbler's a shoe-in
for the job if ya ask me.

311
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:28,166
Of course there might be a
little shake-up among the brass,

312
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,583
maybe some demotions.

313
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,500
Not to mention a coup d'état.

314
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,833
[FALCO]
Uhh...

315
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:37,916
[ATRI] We're not allowed
to talk about it.

316
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,625
[FALCO]
Hell, it's in the works.

317
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,666
[KELI] Doesn't mean we
should be running our mouths.

318
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,958
What did I just walk into?

319
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:46,000
What coup?

320
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,958
[FALCO]
Ah. Suitsu, right.

321
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:50,500
You'd be the last person
to know what's going on.

322
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,458
I take back what I said before.

323
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,500
Warbler's not a shoe-in.

324
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:56,125
[SANDPIPER]
Well this guy certainly is!

325
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:58,166
Sharpest tool in the shed!

326
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,416
Hey, Knot.

327
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,500
C'mon, what are
they talking about?

328
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:06,416
[WARBLER]
ACCA leading a coup?

329
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,125
[KNOT]
Yeah. Safest way to do it.

330
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:12,000
Don't worry, all the districts
are with us on this.

331
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:13,375
[WARBLER]
Hold on, back up.

332
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,083
What's the reason?

333
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,958
Well, to keep ACCA alive.

334
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:19,041
At least, so I hear.

335
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:22,000
Prince Schwan vowed to disband
us once he becomes king.

336
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,541
Can't have that.

337
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:26,583
Besides, nobody wants to
see the crown on his head.

338
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:31,916
We pull this off, ACCA survives
and the citizens are protected.

339
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,083
That's how it was
explained to me, anyway.

340
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:37,375
How did we jump from
ensuring ACCA's survival

341
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:39,083
to staging a coup?

342
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,666
That doesn't seem odd to you?

343
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,916
[door opens]

344

[OWL]
Warbler. If I may...

345
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:46,458
[WARBLER]
Certainly, Chief.

346
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:50,041
[OWL] It might strike you
as a touch extreme,

347
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,041
but the Five Chief Officers
and the Director General

348
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:54,416
have made their decision.

349
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,125
One way or another,
a coup will happen soon.

350
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:59,875
As such, the only way
to prevent the situation

351
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:02,000
from devolving into
utter chaos is for ACCA

352
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:04,416
to step up and take the helm.

353
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,958
[WARBLER]
One way or another?

354
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,958
That's ridiculous!

355
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:10,958
The districts have their
complaints, I'll grant you,

356
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,916
but there's no real
incentive for them to toss

357
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,500
the royal family out
on their ear like this.

358
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,458
So the Prince hates us.

359
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:21,166
He's the only one
talking disbandment.

360
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,208
He's a fool,
but he's not a dictator.

361
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:26,583
The Privy Council
will keep him in check.

362
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,458
Give the DMw
family some credit.

363
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:33,083
They wouldn't risk losing
the power they have.

364
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:35,750
Think about it, sir, there's
no benefit for them

365
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,583
in an autocratic system!

366
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:42,208
This coup isn't about
protecting ACCA and you know it.

367
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,625
Prince Schwan
intends to destroy us.

368
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:47,791
Can he?

369
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:50,000
Would the Privy Council
reign the boy in?

370
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:52,333
Is watching him tighten the
noose around his own neck

371
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:55,625
worth the risk to
this country's stability?

372
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:56,833
Surely not.

373
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,916
We can't afford to be so naïve.

374
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,750
If there's even a
chance we'll be disbanded.

375
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:04,375
With all due respect, sir,
you're biased.

376

I'm sorry, ma'am.

Evidently, the cigarettes
I kept getting

380
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:17,583
indicated each district's
willingness to participate

in the coup.

382

How many total?

00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,750
I was told thirteen.

Have you told anyone else?

385
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:28,208
I reported it to Chief
Officer Lilium, yes.

386

Before finally
bringing it to me.

What were you instructed to do?

the right word.

everything on you being king.

Forgive my saying so, Highness,
