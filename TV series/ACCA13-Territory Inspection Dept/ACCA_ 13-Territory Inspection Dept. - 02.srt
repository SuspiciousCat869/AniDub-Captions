Huh? Um, well...

Then let's begin

24
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,958
It was established
ninety-nine years ago.

25
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:01,333
But an entire
century before that,

26
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:02,833
the kingdom we
live in was divided

27
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,875
into thirteen
separate countries.

28
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:07,500
These were united by

Can anyone tell me who?

[ACCA MASCOT]

Yes!

32
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:14,416
Things went smoothly at first,

33
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,583
but before long we
entered the turbulent era

34
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,291
of His Majesty's father...

35
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:21,416
...when the twelve districts
rose up in revolt against DMw

36
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,875
and attempted to
overthrow the government.

[GUIDE 2A]
Pretty awful, huh?

38
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:29,708
Fortunately, His Majesty's
father was a peaceful man.

39
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,833
Instead of meeting the
rebellion with force,

40
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,416
he held talks
with representatives

41
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,583
from every territory

42
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:36,541
and fashioned the
system we have now,

43
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:39,000
where districts are autonomous!

44
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,708
First the capitol was moved.

45
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:43,583
After that, a central
congress was created,

46
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:46,291
and finally, a special
independent civilian

47
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:48,541
organization was founded.

48
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:52,416
And that organization
was none other than ACCA.

the name comes from?

out there, Deputy Chief.

How's Mushroomhead?

166
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,875

Y'found it.

to keep track of it.

Oh, yeah, I meant to tell ya.

171
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:23,583
[NINO]
Hm?

172
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:26,125
I get the feeling I'm
being watched lately.

173
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,833
You think someone's inspecting
the Inspection Department?

174
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,500
No problem. I'll look into it.

[RAIL'S PARTNER]
Nice work, rook.

176
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,458
He'd have probably
set the condo on fire

177
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,000
if we hadn't caught him.

178

Well, yeah.

00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,625
That is kinda how arson works.

This puts you in that

She's a knockout!

Next time you two

Yeah, course.

Heh. Aren't you

196
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,500
More like a widow of business.

Oh.

My future husband's
gonna need to be handy.

199
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:33,958
Even if Jean quits ACCA, he
can't run the building alone.

He won't quit anytime soon.

[WAITRESS 2A]
Here you go.

202

That doesn't make sense.

203
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,500
He hates working for
the Inspection Department.

204
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,916
Why wouldn't he walk
away given the chance?

205
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,666
Besides, being a landlord's
much more stable.

206
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,583
And don't even get me started
on what they're paying him.

207
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:55,041
He talks about this
stuff with you, right?

208
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:56,541
Not a lot, actually.

00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:58,291
[LOTTA]
Get him to open up.

210
00:10:58,375 --> 00:10:59,833

[NINO]
Keepin' me on my toes.

213
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,583
I'm following a hot lead, so
there's some legwork involved,

214
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:06,916
but those are the breaks.

215
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,666
That's the life of an

216
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,750
I suppose.

217
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,833
Is the money any good?

[NINO]
Now you're talkin'.

227
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,250
[LILIUM] More than likely,
the rumors of a coup d'état

228
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,041
will turn out to be just that.

229
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,000
[PASTIS] Perhaps, but
Director General Mauve

230
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,583
taking direct
action is worrisome.

231
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:42,833
[SPADE]
I concur.

232
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,708
It's not like her
to be fooled.

233
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:47,875
She's not a woman I'd advise
leading around by the nose.

234
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,750
[LILIUM]
You make a valid point.

235
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,708
Chief Officer Grossular,
were you unaware of these rumors

236
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,666
before the Director
General acted on them?

237
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,291
[LILIUM] I thought stirrings
of an imminent rebellion

238
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,958
were what changed
your mind with regards

239
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,750
to the Inspection Department.

240
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,708
[GROSSULAR]
They are.

241
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:09,458
You see, I have good reason
to believe the rumors are true.

242
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,208
Certain information
has come to light

243
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,541
that gives me cause for concern.

244
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:17,083
There is in fact a coup d'état
plot in the works, comrades.

245
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:20,458
And Deputy Chief Jean Otus
is directly involved.

246
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,916
[SPADE]
You're referring to the smoker?

247
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,416
[GROSSULAR]
Come, now.

248
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,000
Surely I can't be the only one
among us troubled by him.

249
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:29,791
Director General Mauve
has been ordered

250
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:33,166
to end her investigations.

251
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:37,416
This is a matter best handled
by the Five Chief Officers.

252
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,500
[LILIUM] You don't suspect
he's in contact with dissidents

253
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,083
in outlying districts.

254
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:44,666
His audit rounds would certainly
give him access to that element.

255
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,958
Then again, we have
to take into account

256
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,625
the fact that he's
requested a transfer

257
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:50,125
from Inspection
on multiple occasions.

258
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:51,500
[GROSSULAR]
Oh?

259
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,500
In point of fact there's no
actual record of the man

260
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,583
ever having submitted
such a request.

261
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,583
[JEAN] Don't feel like
I'm being watched anymore.

262
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,833
Thank you, Nino.

263
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,041
[GROSSULAR] We forestalled
Inspection's disbandment

264
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,583
and had him monitored.

265
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:10,666
But he's far more cunning
than anticipated.

266
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,791
The agents assigned to
his case must be exceptional.

267
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:17,458
There's a deep-cover
agent with Internal Affairs.

268
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:20,041
I believe he'd be an asset here.

269
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:23,291
Undercover operatives fall
under our jurisdiction.

270
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:26,125
Their true identities
are known only to us.

271
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:28,458
Neither Internal Affairs
nor any other department

272
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,708
has access to their records.

273
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:33,125
This includes
Deputy Chief Otus.

Huh?!

320
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,083
The average height's
gone up again.

321
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:44,791
It's at darn near seven feet!

322
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:45,875
Really?

323
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:51,416
Would you like to
try the cake? Enjoy!

324
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,541
I feel oddly compelled.

325
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,291
Wow. You lost weight.

326
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:04,958
Uh, hey.

327
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:06,250
You working a story?

328
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,750
Sorta. Stopped by on
a local's recommendation.

329
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,750
Never thought I'd run
into you here, though.

330
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,708
Thanks, by the way.

331
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,958
That feeling that someone
was tailing me?

332
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:18,625
It's gone.

333
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,875
Oh, good, glad to hear.

334
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,458
Not that you had a
lot to worry about.

335
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:24,958
Just one of Mushroomhead's pals.

336
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,000
Ah. Makes sense.

337
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:29,791
He's probably moved on by now.

338
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,625
Thanks for havin' my back.

339
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:33,833
Hey, nothin' new, right?

340
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:35,208
Guess not.

341
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:37,750
You wanna meet up
for dinner tonight?

342
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,041
Sure. I'll call you.

343
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:40,625
Cool. See ya later.

344
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:46,333
[KORURI] Afraid I've got
some bad news, sir.

345
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,250
Looks like they're not gonna
be able to get the system

346
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,708
back up today.

347
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,750
[JEAN]
Huh. Right.

348
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:54,166
Well then, we'll go just
go somewhere else.

349
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,541
I'm really sorry.

350
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:02,083
Hey, guys.

351
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:03,208
Any luck?

352
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,125
[KORURI]
They're, uh...

353
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,833
Still on the fritz, sir.

354
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:10,083
Uh-huh. Big shock.

355
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,791
Yeah, I know.

356
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,583
Any backup systems?

357
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,166
Yeah.

358
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,583
But... we don't run 'em every
day unless there's a problem.

359
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,791
So we'll have to manually
enter any missing data

360
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:21,250
if you wanna create a log.

361
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,875
[KORURI gasps]

362
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:25,000
Let me help.

363
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,041
[OWL] Sorry to drag
you here after school.

364
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:30,041
I'm sure you're busy.

365
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:32,833
My staff requested sweets
from this cafe specifically,

366
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:35,416
but I couldn't find it
to save my life.

367
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,666
Well, if you want
cake with nuts,

368
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,916
I've heard this is the place.

369
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,958
I've been wanting to try
'em out for a while now.

370
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:43,833
Gah! So good.

371
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:46,041
DMwis famous for
this sort of thing.

372
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:47,708
His Majesty's said
to have a fondness

373
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:50,208
for these rustic baked goods.

374
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:52,375
Not quite sure where
I heard that though.

375
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:54,541
Yeah? I should go sometime.

376
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:58,000
You know, I've never
actually been there myself.

377
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:02,125
I feel terrible working
Jean as hard as I've had to.

378
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,750
All thirteen districts
in just six months.

379
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,375
I'd be more than happy
to lighten his load

380
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,958
and do a few myself, but...

381
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:11,291
Honestly, I'm not
a man for travel.

382
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:14,041
Prone to motion sickness.
You understand.

383
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,500
Always have been.

384
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,166
Oh, hey, don't feel bad.

385
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,291
My brother loves making
the audit rounds.

386
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:20,916
No worries.

387
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,458
Ugh, the hell are they
even talking about?

388
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:26,416
Why couldn't she
come here by herself?

389
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,458
God, she's gorgeous.

390
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:29,625
[KORURI]
Here ya go.

391
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,500
[JEAN]
Thanks.

392
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,958
No, no, no,
Deputy Chief, thank you.

393
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:36,291
Really, it would've taken us
forever to knock this out

394
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:37,791
on our own, trust me.

395
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:40,041
[JEAN]
Home stretch.

396
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:41,541
Almost there.

397
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:42,708
[KORURI]
Awesome!

398
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:46,833
[JEAN panting]
Sorry.

399
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,541
[NINO]
Hit a snag?

400
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:49,583
Yeah.

401
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:51,875
[NINO]
Cheers.

402
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,791
What about you?

403
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:58,250
Just about done.

404
00:18:58,333 --> 00:18:59,625
That must be nice.

405
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:02,333
Hey, I could use a hand
if you wanna change jobs.

406
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:05,208
I'm kinda over travel right now.

407
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:08,583
Besides, we both know
you're a lone wolf.

408
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:09,875
Poor guy.

409
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:12,541
I bet I'm your only
friend in the whole world.

410
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:15,666
Not like work gives me a
whole lot of free time, y'know.

411
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:19,750
What little I have I spend
on my motorcycle and with you

412
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:22,041
gettin' three sheets
to the wind.

413
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:25,333
Yeah, well I guess some
things never change.

414
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,958
We've known each other what,
fifteen years now?

415
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,416
[NINO]
Yep.

416
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,458
It's odd.

417
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,500
You'd think I'd know
more about you.

418
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:33,750
Oh?

419
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,750
[JEAN] You've been that
way since high school--

420
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:38,208
always doin' your own thing.

421
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:40,958
Standin' out from the crowd.

422
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:42,291
[NINO]
What?

423
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:43,916
You tryin' to say I'm
standoffish or somethin'?

424
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,041
'Cause comin' from you,
that's hilarious.

425
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,458
[NINO] You an' I were
both a couple a' loners.

426
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,583
Probably why we
got along so well.

427
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:57,583
And you're damn right some
things never change, my friend.

428
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:58,791
Heh.

429
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,375
When you first joined ACCA,

430
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:03,333
I was positive you'd just become
another stuffed shirt, but nope.

431
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:04,875
Same ol' Jean.

432
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:07,625
Inspection's definitely got
its share of agents like that.

433
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,166
[NINO]
You hate it, don't you?

434
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,750
Be honest.

435
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:13,250
Meh. It's just not my thing.

436
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:15,458
Then why don't you
tell 'em to shove it?

437
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:18,125
There some special
reason you can't quit?

438
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:21,583
[JEAN]
Reason? Like what?

439
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:24,583
[NINO]
That's what I'm askin' you.

440
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,583
You complain about it
all the time, Jean.

441
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:29,333
But you're still
in that uniform. So?

442
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,000
[JEAN sighs]

443
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:32,291
Yeah, I know.

444
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:34,750
[NINO]
First time I've seen that brand.

445
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:38,041
What, these?

446
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,416
They're new to me, too.

447
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,041
Want some wine?

448
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:47,291
[NINO] You're not still buying
presents for someone, are you?

449
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,375
[JEAN]
We've had this talk.

450
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,416
[NINO]
Oh, yeah. Right.

451
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,041
[NINO] Subject Jean Otus
received cigarettes

452
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:56,791
at some point while
visiting the JumMku District.

453
00:20:56,875 --> 00:21:00,750
Also, for the record, putting
a tail on me is ridiculous.

454
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,875
I've said it before
and I'll say it again:

455
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:05,916
No one knows the game like I do.

456
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Is it that much to ask
that you have a little faith

457
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:09,541
in my skill set?

458
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,125
[NINO] Took you long enough
to make up your mind,

459
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:15,166
one way or the other.

460
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,166
Naturally.

461
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,166
You are a personal
friend of Jean Otus,

462
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,583
Agent Crow.

463
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,708
He saw your man
coming from a mile away.

464
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:26,916
Felt himself being watched
the moment he got out of bed.

465
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,958
I'd have never made a
rookie mistake like that.

466
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:32,541
Only a matter of time
before the other Chief Officers

467
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:36,291
realize the rumors
aren't just rumors.

468
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:37,708
[NINO]
I'll call back later.

469
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:43,750
He's completely oblivious to the
fact I'm keeping tabs on him.

470
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,916
Has been for the
past thirty years.

471
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:51,166
[ATRI squeals]

472
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,416
Oh my gosh,
you brought potato chips!

473
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,750
Where you headed off to next?

474
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:58,333
Suitsu.

475
00:21:58,416 --> 00:21:59,958
In a couple of weeks.

476
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:02,583
Least you get a break
before you have to go.

477
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:03,958
[NINO]
Ah.

478
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:06,666
So this is where the little
rendezvous happens.

Would you like some?

[MAUVE] Oh.
From JumMku District, no less.

484
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:20,750
Bought too much;
didn't wanna waste it.

485
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:22,833
I can take it off your hands.

493
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,208
[NINO sighs] Jean wouldn't know
the truth if it slapped him

494
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:17,750
in the face.

495
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:18,833
