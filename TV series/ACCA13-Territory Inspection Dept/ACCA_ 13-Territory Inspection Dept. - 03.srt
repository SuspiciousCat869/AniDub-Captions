1
00:00:12,458 --> 00:00:13,916
I can't believe you
actually brought us goodies

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,291
on your day off, Deputy Chief!

3
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:18,958
[JEAN] Hey, y'know if
there's a dress code for Vert?

4
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:20,916
Over on Seventh Avenue?

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,041
[KNOT]
Let's see.

6
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,125
Oh, that fancy
restaurant from Koror

7
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:28,208
that opened one here.

8
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:30,083
I'd wear a tie.

9
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:31,291
Figured.

10
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:37,708
[PASTIS]
Seems farfetched.

11
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:39,500
You don't buy it, do you?

12
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:40,833
[SPADE]
It's not impossible.

13
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:44,416
[PINE]
What do you think?

14
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,708
Well, it's not as though
any of us can accuse Groschler

15
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:48,166
of being a team player.

16
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,166
Giving him sole authority
over Agent Crow

17
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,166
is a disaster waiting to happen.

18
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,000
[LOTTA] I don't know,
some colleague.

19
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:26,833
They're having dinner tonight.

20
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:29,000
I was really looking forward
to some quality time

21
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:30,625
with the three of us.

22
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:33,125
So, uh... did you
talk to him at all?

23
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:35,750
Hmm? Oh, no, I forgot.

24
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:37,000
[LOTTA]
Ugh. I swear.

25
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:38,958
It's like you and him
are the same person.

26
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:40,916
[NINO]
Yeah. My bad.

27
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,750
Just don't forget
next time, huh?

28
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:44,791
I wanna know why he won't quit.

29
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,250
[NINO]
Yes ma'am.

30
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:49,750
Don't get your hopes up
it'll do any good, though.

31
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:51,125
He's in for life.

32
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:58,166
Sorry for dragging you
out to such a stuffy place.

33
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,541
I was craving a
taste of my homeland.

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,541
[JEAN] So glad I held off
filing that transfer.

35
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,666
[NINO] What's the verdict
on that DMw cake?

36
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,083
All hype, or what?

37
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:18,166
[LOTTA]
No! It's delicious!

38
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,791
And they don't skimp on
the nuts, lemme tell ya.

39
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:21,708
[NINO]
Who'da thought.

40
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,500
DMwDistrict, wow.

41
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:25,208
Wish I could go sometime.

42
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:27,916
[doorbell rings]

43
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:29,916
Package for ya.

44
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
[LOTTA]
Coming!

45
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,375
Thank you very much.

46
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:35,416
Nino!

47
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,416
What's that?

48
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,375
Gimme a hand?

49
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:41,291
This thing must weigh a ton.

50
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:45,583
As you wish, Your Highness.

51
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:48,875
[NINO]
All the way from Fasu.

52
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,208
It's addressed to Jean,

53
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:52,750
so it's bound to be a gift
from someone at work.

54
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,208
Aw, score!

55
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,875
[LOTTA] I can make
potatoes au gratin!

56
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:59,375
You ever soak the
cheese up with a nice,

57
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:01,250
thick slick of bread?
It's the best!

58
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:02,666
Jean'll be thrilled!

59
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:06,250
What?

60
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,791
[NINO] Nothing.
Some things never change.

61
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,666
Just sayin' you still
get carried away.

62
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,166
[MAUVE]
Not a tee-totaller, I hope.

63
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,708
No, I just don't really,
you know.

64
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:23,916
Have all you like.

65
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,541
It's a private room;
no one'll see but me.

66
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,958
[JEAN]
I should be so lucky.

67
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:30,125
Never mind.

68
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,833
Better you have command
of your faculties.

69
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:35,083
Tonight's one I want
you to remember.

70
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:39,208
This isn't a social call so
much as a business meeting.

71
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,458
I believe it's customary
for prospective recruits

72
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:43,708
to be wined and dined, yes?

73
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,875
Of course if word got out
I was putting the moves

74
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:50,041
on some high profile official,
there'd be hell to pay.

75
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:52,333
But I can count on
you not to bat an eye,

76
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,083
even though for all
intents and purposes,

77
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:56,458
you're quite the chess piece.

78
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:57,666
Something wrong?

79
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,041
[JEAN]
No.

80
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,541
[MAUVE]
You are a lightweight!

81
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,208
Oh, that won't do at all.

82
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:03,583
Here, have my water too.

83
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,791
[JEAN]
I'll be fine, I promise.

84
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,875
[JEAN]
Smooth one, Jean.

85
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:09,416
[MAUVE]
So, the coup rumors.

86
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:12,291
[JEAN]
Beg your pardon?

87
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:15,000
Someone hasn't had
his ear to the ground.

88
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,000
[JEAN]
Oh.

89
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,125
I mean, I've heard
stuff, I guess.

90
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:19,750
Just talk.

91
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,166
When there's talk of revolution,

92
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,750
I make a point of
paying attention.

93
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,791
In this particular instance
I've done some digging.

94
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:29,458
Afraid the rumor mill
has it right for once.

95
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:32,083
Chief Officer Groschler
doesn't agree.

96
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:35,625
My investigation was suspended.

97
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:37,833
Jean, I need your help.

98
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:40,291
You know the districts--
they're your beat.

99
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:43,791
If you hear anything more than
talk, I need to know about it.

100
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:46,250
Off the record.

101
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,958
A coup d'état? Really?

102
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,208
Sorry, but is something
like that even possible

103
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:52,833
in such a peaceful country?

104
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:54,000
Peaceful?

105
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,375
Ha! Now you're just
having fun with me.

106
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:01,125
[MAUVE]
You really don't know?

107
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:02,416
[SCHWAN]
Oh, please.

108
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,916
A coup d'etat?

109
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,041
That's ridiculous.

110
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,291
[MAGIE]
With respect, Highness,

111
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,250
if we ignore the rumors
until they become true,

112
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,333
the kingdom is finished.

113
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,041
So dramatic.

114
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:14,791
We'll be fine.

115
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,833
I promise you'll eat those
words once I'm crowned.

116
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:20,333
[PASTIS] We have to
attend Prince Schwan's

117
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,458
coming-of-age ceremony?

118
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:25,375
Evidently.
Seems a little last-minute.

119
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:28,000
"Attendance of the Five
Chief Officers is required,

120
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:31,333
plus the Director General,
the Deputy Director General,

121
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:35,041
and two officers
from Inspection."

122
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:37,166
[OWL] I hate to do
this to you, Jean.

123
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,291
Especially right before you
leave for Suitsu District.

124
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:41,333
Sorry.

125
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:45,333
I'd be happy to
join you, of course,

126
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:48,541
but me and planes...
motion sickness.

127
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:52,000
[OWL] Perhaps Knot would like
to fill in on my behalf?

128
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:53,083
[MOZ]
Huh?

129
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:54,041
[ATRI]
Aw...

130
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,333
If you're not busy.

131
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:58,250
[KNOT] Uh, well,
I do have the kids, sir.

132
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,541
[JEAN] Won't they be
on winter break, though?

133
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:03,250
Maybe you can get your
folks to look after them.

134
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,791
[KNOT]
I s'pose so, yeah.

135
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:06,708
It'll only be two days, right?

136
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:09,333
All right, fine.
I'm convinced.

137
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:10,750
DMwCastle.

138
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:13,166
Should give me a cool
story for the rugrats, huh?

139
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:17,916
His Majesty failed
to produce a son,

140
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,458
so there's no direct heir.

141
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,958
He sired only daughters,
as I'm sure you know,

142
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,666
the youngest of whom gave
birth to Prince Schwan.

143
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,291
According to the
laws of succession,

144
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:30,583
he is next in line
for the throne.

145
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:33,625
[JEAN] Prince Schwan is
coming of age soon, right?

146
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:36,166
[MAUVE] Yes, at which point
his status as heir-apparent

147
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,791
will be official.

148
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,916
The moment he assumes power,
this nation will be in trouble.

149
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,208
The kid's a complete idiot.

150
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,083
[JEAN]
You don't mince words.

151
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,750
I believe those
plotting the coup

152
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,083
include powerful figures
in outlying districts

153
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,000
who would rather die
before they'd see him

154
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,125
wear the crown.

155
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:57,041
Even ACCA branch
staff is suspect.

156
00:07:57,125 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm aware this goes beyond
the scope of your position.

157
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,750
I'd consider it
a personal favor.

158
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:05,250
[JEAN] You're not kidding
around, are you?

159
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:06,666
[MAUVE]
Not at all.

160
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,208
The thought ever cross
your mind that I might say no?

161
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:15,208
I'm not one for defying
the orders of my superiors.

162
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:19,416
The will of the Five Chief
Officers is sacrosanct.

163
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,791
But when push comes to shove,

164
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,750
ACCA was founded by
and for the people.

165
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,291
It's our job to
protect the interest

166
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,500
of this nation's citizens.

167
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:29,625
We can't stand by while
a brutal shift in power

168
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,666
rips them apart.

169
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:35,000
We are not the "symbol of
peace and harmony," Jean.

170
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:36,750
We're the "defenders
of law and order"

171
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:40,125
without whom peace
wouldn't be possible.

172
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:43,666
You're among the few who
understands that, I can tell.

173
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,541
We're cut from the same cloth.

174
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,541
We both believe in order.

175
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:52,750
Now, will you help me?

176
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:00,250
[JEAN]
You make some good points.

177
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:01,625
I'm happy to help.

178
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:09,041
[JEAN] How do you say
no to a smile like that?

179
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,791
[NINO]
Go home, Jean. You're drunk.

180
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:14,708
[JEAN] Yeah, 'cause you
keep pouring, jackass.

181
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:16,458
[NINO chuckles]

182
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:18,416
So is this turning
into somethin'?

183
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,125
You gonna see her again?

184
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:21,625
[JEAN]
Yep.

185
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,666
Good thing you didn't give
'em your walkin' papers, huh?

186
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:24,708
Nice one.

187
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:26,083
Yep!

188
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,916
[NINO] I'll be in DMwp  same time as you love birds.

189

Covering the festivities.

190
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,541
You know how folks
love their royals.

191
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,958
See you at the ball, Romeo.

192
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,708
Ah. There we go.

193
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:47,166
Come on. They're about to
call our boarding group.

194
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,208
[LOTTA]
'Kay!

195

[MAGIE]
Your Highness.

196
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,375
I have advised the guests
to wear formal attire

197
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,750
for tomorrow's ceremony.

198
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,125
Good.

199
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:15,833
ACCA uniforms are
such an eyesore.

200
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,875
Historic moments want
a touch of glamour,

201
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:19,208
don't you think?

202
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,041
Can't have grandfather
announcing his retirement

203
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:24,000
to a bunch of proles
dressed for a funeral.

204
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,375
Picture it, Magie!

205
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,083
Me, my succession
claim formalized,

206
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:32,000
my adoring public captivated,
hanging on every word!

207
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,208
When asked to make a speech,

208
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:35,875
the first thing
I'll say will be,

209
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:41,250
"On this, my hour of ascension,
I declare ACCA to be defunct!" 

210
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:44,166
Symbol of peace my left foot.

211
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:48,208
We're the people's inspiration,
not those glorified bureaucrats.

212
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,125
Don't you agree?

213
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:53,500
[MAGIE] You may be putting
the cart before the horse.

214
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:54,750
[SCHWAN]
Watch your tongue!

215
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:56,791
Why would Grandfather
invite so many people

216
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:59,125
if not to promote me?

217
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:01,208
Alas, the President
of the Privy Council

218
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:03,791
devised the guest list,
not His Majesty.

219
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:04,666
[SCHWAN]
Whatever!

220
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,125
It amounts to the same thing!

221
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,375
Now shut up, Magpie!

222
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:10,625
[SCHWAN]
When I am king,

223
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,458
and mark me, I shall be,

224
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:16,041
after dissolving ACCA I will
abolish the central congress!

225
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:19,583
The Privy Council then falls
to the crown's jurisdiction.

226
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,583
That's how it works, isn't it?

227
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,041
Eh? Well?

228
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,250
Speak, damn you!

229
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:25,583
Indeed.

230
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:27,750
You know you're only here
because you're pretty!

231
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,625
[MAGIE]
You flatter me, Your Highness.

232
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:34,208
If I may, you've neglected
an important point.

233
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,041
The Privy Council President.

234
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:39,875
You're an imbecile.

235
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:42,916
He will follow grandfather
into retirement.

236
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,625
The man dare not
tarnish his virtue.

237
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,750
He's paid it too
much lip service.

238
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:53,416
[POCHARD clears throat]

239
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,875
They've requested formal attire?

240
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,208
I assume that comes
from the Prince.

241
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,750
Who else would pull
a stunt like this?

242
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:04,125
He calls the tune, we dance.

243
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:07,708
Mind if I join you?

244
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:09,166
Please.

245
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,250
[MAUVE]
Thank you, sirs.

246
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,916
All the branch chiefs
have arrived.

247
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,791
I understand the
evening's program entails

248
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,541
our dining with them.

249
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:19,500
Should we include
Inspection staff?

250
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,041
I think not.

251
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:22,458
Yes, sir. Understood.

252
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,375
[PINE]
Strange.

253
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:27,166
Why is their department on
the guest list for tomorrow?

254
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,041
[MAUVE] They know the
districts intimately.

255
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,958
The royal family can't
afford to ignore them,

256
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:36,375
especially given the
stirrings as of late.

257
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:37,750
As of right now,

258
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,500
the crown has issued no
request for a formal meeting

259
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:40,875
with Inspection.

260
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:43,083
But that doesn't mean it
won't field an informal one

261
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,625
during tomorrow's celebration.

262
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:49,458
So the crown now stoops
to dignify hearsay. Huh.

263
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,916
Well, better safe than sorry.

264
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,333
If only we could all be
as impervious to gossip

265
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:57,375
as the Five Chiefs.

266
00:12:57,458 --> 00:13:00,000
Imagine, all thirteen district
chiefs breaking bread

267
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:02,166
with central congress,
ACCA branch chiefs,

268
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,333
and of course yourselves.

269
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,250
That's a lot of political
heft in one place

270
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:09,666
for His Highness's
coming-of-age ceremony.

271
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,500
Makes one wonder, doesn't it?

272
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,666
Maybe something
special's in store.

273
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,166
[QUALM] That's the overview
of the day's events,

00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,125

ceremony to celebration.

Tell me, Qualm, have you ever
known this dotty old man

279
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,833
to shrink from public speaking?

Never once, Your Majesty.

281
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:34,625
[KING] Will there be
sweets on the menu?

282
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:37,250
From the finest
confectioners in the kingdom.

283
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:38,541
[KING]
Any fruit?

284
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,208

Excuse me, Mr. President?

It's been given me to
understand Prince Schwan

I fail to see any harm.

As he desires.

exactly as planned.

00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:41,875
Please, by all means.

321
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,750
[SCHWAN]
My heart is glad this day.

322
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:50,500
Indeed I did not expect
to be honored so.

323
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,875
That is to say, thank you.

324
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,416
I am grateful to those of you

325
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,541
who represent
our loyal subjects.

326
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:59,666
Without you we would fall.

327
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,666
This kingdom knows prosperity.

328
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,166
May it continue
to thrive forever.

329
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:10,333
[SPADE]
That was terrible.

330
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,791
So no announcement
of abdication after all.

331
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:17,541
Then what earthly
reason is there

332
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,416
for having so many of us here?

333
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,583
I'm just gonna have
a quick smoke.

334
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,208
Mind if I step outside?

335
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:29,916
[GUARD 3B]
Are you serious?

336
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,500
[SCHWAN]
I'll allow it.

337
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:32,958
[GUARD 3B]
But Your Highness...

338
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:35,416
Am I or am I not
the guest of honor today?

339
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:40,875
[SCHWAN]
Stepping out for a cigarette.

340
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,291
What a sense of humor.

341
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,958
Tobacco is scarce enough
in our nation these days.

342
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:48,708
The Privy Council President
doesn't care for smoking.

343
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:51,666
He frets over the habit's
ill effects on my grandfather.

344
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,416
Such a Samaritan.

345
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,791
But this man...

346
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,625
[MAGIE] She fits the criteria
for your taste in women,

347
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:02,666
Highness.

348
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,500
[SCHWAN]
Find out who she is.

349
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,708
Hey, that girl kinda
looks like Lotta.

350
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:11,458
[JEAN]
Hm?

351
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:12,833
What the hell?

352
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,041
[LOTTA] Nino brought me
as his assistant!

353
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:19,125
Isn't it great?

354
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:20,958
She said she
wanted to see DMw

355
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,666
so I thought, why not?

356
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,958
And what are you
doing to "assist" him?

357
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,500
Ah, you know,
carryin' bags and stuff.

358
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:28,875
Your hands are empty.

359
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:31,458
Don't be silly.
I'm wearing a nice dress.

360
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,583
Shall I capture this
moment for posterity?

361
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:36,916
[LOTTA]
Yeah! Come on!

362
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,958
[laughs]

363
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:49,416
[KNOT] I think I've died
and gone to dessert heaven!

364
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,875
[JEAN] His Majesty is known
to have a sweet tooth.

365
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,541
[JEAN]
Check out the strawberries.

366
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,250
[PARTY GOER 3A] I was of the
impression this gala was meant

367
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:58,666
for the prince.

368
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,416
[PARTY GOER 3A] How telling
that everything is to

369
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,791
His Majesty's taste.

370
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:03,083
They look so good!

371
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,625
[NINO]
Go for that one.

372
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:07,791
The king has a particular
fondness for them.

373
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,041
Wow.

374
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,250
[ATTENDANT 3A]
Madam.

375
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,375
Does the lady
enjoy sweet things?

376
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:29,875
[LOTTA]
Yes!

377
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,875
Then please, eat your fill.

378
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:39,208
Please tell me you got
photographic evidence of that.

379
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:40,083
Naturally.

380
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:41,208
[LOTTA giggles]

381
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,916
So did Groschler's line
turn out to be true after all?

382
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:54,416
[NINO]
Director General Mauve.

383
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,291
Would you care to comment on
today's proceedings, ma'am?

384
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:01,125
You're Jean Otus's friend,
if I'm not mistaken.

385
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:02,041
Right.

386
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:05,208
[MAUVE]
Huh. How very curious.

387
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:06,458
Sorry?

388
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:08,333
I endeavor to know
everything I can

389
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,083
about ACCA personnel.

390
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,291
[NINO] I'm fairly
certain I've been made

391
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:15,500
by Director General Mauve.

392
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,750
[GROSSULAR]
And what's Otus been up to?

393
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,958
[NINO]
Nothing noteworthy on him,

394
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:23,625
but have you noticed the
Privy Council President?

395
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:24,958
[GROSSULAR]
Hm?

396
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:28,166
Been watching Jean
like a hawk all night.

397
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,208
There are enough people
of power and influence

398
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:31,791
gathered under
one roof right now

399
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:33,750
to upset the pecking order.

400
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,208
If there were a
coup in the works,

401
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:37,083
all eyes would be
on the man responsible

402
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:39,791
for keeping it together,
and whaddya know?

403
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:40,916
They are.

404
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,083
Jean's the star of the show.

405
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:45,083
My gut tells me our
friend will be accepting

406
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:48,166
his third and fourth
cigarettes this evening.

407
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:51,000
[phone rings]

408
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,166
[NINO]
'Scuse me.

409
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:55,625
[phone rings]

410
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,458
[NINO]
Hey. Yeah, I know.

411
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:02,500
[JEAN]
I'm gonna step outside.

412
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,583
Going smoothly so far.

413
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:09,083
I think you're going
to be more than satisfied.

414
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:17,750
[LILIUM] Bold move daring
to smoke a cigarette in DMw

415
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:21,958
Bit brisk out here
for my tastes.

416
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:25,125
The night air in this district
just doesn't agree with me.

417
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:27,458
So, then why're you even here?

418
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:30,625
Well... Officially to pay my
respects to Prince Schwan.

419
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:33,000
Unofficially, to see
my two brothers.

420
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:34,375
Your brothers?

421
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,916
Older one's Furawau
District Chief

422
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,666
and our little brother's
an ACCA Branch Chief.

423
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,875
[JEAN]
Oh, wow.

424
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,125
That's impressive.

425
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,958
You didn't know?

426
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,000
[JEAN]
Sorry.

427
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,583
[LILIUM] I know when
I'm being lied to, Jean.

428
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:51,041
So I'll be straight with you:
I like you.

429
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,666
You're an honest man.

430
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,541
Why are you really out here?

431
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:58,500
You need a break from all
the eyes on you inside?

432
00:20:58,583 --> 00:20:59,833
[JEAN]
Yeah.

433
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,458
[LILIUM] You seem bewildered
that so many people

434
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:03,166
are intrigued by you.

435
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,750
Why does anybody give a
damn about what I'm doing?

436
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:10,958
You're the intermediary for
rebels planning a coup d'état.

437
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:15,125
At least that seems
to be what they all think.

438
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:17,125
So, to the connected
and well-to-do,

439
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:19,666
you're a person
of great interest.

440
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,500
Rumor spreads like wildfire.

441
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:26,083
In select circles, you're
something of a celebrity.

442
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:27,625
[JEAN]
Well, that's annoying.

443
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:32,833
Clearly there's been a mistake.

444
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,083
Grossular ought to
vet his sources better,

445
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:36,375
though I wouldn't
put it past him

446
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:38,625
to have started
this intentionally.

447
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:40,625
In his version
of an ideal world,

448
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:43,333
ACCA holds absolute power.

449
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:45,208
The man is not to be trusted.

450
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:49,041
If there is a coup d'état,
he's the mastermind.

451
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:51,166
You're a puppet, my friend.

452
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,958
An effective one for being
none the wiser of your role.

453
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:00,791
[LILIUM]
Don't worry.

454
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:03,041
Grossular won't have
his way if I can help it.

455
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:05,208
ACCA may be rocked
to its foundations,

456
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:07,500
but law and order will prevail.

457
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:10,250
We're cut from the same cloth.

458
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,750
We both believe in order.

459
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:14,250
[LILIUM]
Help me, Jean.

460
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,500
Help me preserve the peace
and harmony of this nation.

461
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:21,791
Live up the emblem
on your uniform.

462
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:09,041
[NINO] Next time, on
<i>ACCA: Thirteen-Territory</i>

463
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:10,625
<i>Inspection Department</i> :

464
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:13,708
"Smoldering Embers
in an Isolated Nation."

465
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:15,583
Right, so the next audit is...

466
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:16,791
Oh, I see.

467
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:19,125
Totally different story
from the rest, huh?

468
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,708
How's he gonna handle that?
