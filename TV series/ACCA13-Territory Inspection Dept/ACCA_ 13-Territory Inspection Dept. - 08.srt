1
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:22,958
[SCHNEE] What good comes
of insulating ourselves?

2
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:26,083
We must venture
beyond the castle walls

3
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:28,458
to behold the world as it is.

4
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:30,416
Relying on nothing more
than the Privy Council's

5
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,291
district summary reports
is counterproductive.

6
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:36,000
Why base policy on
rumor and hearsay?

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,250
[QUALM]
Your Majesty,

8
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:41,375
since returning from her
study program in Koro^

9
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,750
Her Highness has taken
quite a passionate interest

10
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:46,041
in matters of state.

11
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:47,458
We're not surprised.

12
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:50,208
Such a nimble mind
is loath to be hemmed in.

13
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:53,250
She wishes to see Bon next.

14
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:55,250
I'm afraid Her Highness
has contacts among

15
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:58,416
the capital's radical
element, Your Majesty.

16
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,291
The princess daily
pores over works

17
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:02,833
of philosophy
and political science.

18
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:05,125
Unless this alarming
tendency is curbed,

19
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:07,541
these newfound
enthusiasms may cast a pall

20
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:11,041
over the DMwfamily--
perhaps the entire kingdom.

21
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:13,708
Ah, would you have us
clip her wings, Qualm?

22
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:16,041
A terrible fate
for one so sharp.

23
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:31,750
[QUALM]
There is another way.

24
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:07,916
[door closes]

25
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:11,541
[ABEND]
You summoned me, Mr. President?

26
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:17,083
[QUALM] Your service has
not gone unnoticed, Abend.

27
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:20,041
Princess Schnee
trusts you implicitly.

28
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,958
You may refuse this order.

29
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:27,708
Forgive my insolence--
that seems an odd thing to say.

30
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,458
Am I to understand
that if I refuse,

31
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:32,916
I'll be forced to abandon my
role as Her Highness' aide?

32
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,791
[QUALM] Once you've signed
this sworn statement...

33
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:39,583
Should you break your oath,
your life will be forfeit.

34
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:41,791
I understand, sir.

35
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:44,000
What is the order?

36
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:46,416
[QUALM] Princess Schnee,
the second princess,

37
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,333
is to be stricken from the
DMwfamily register,

38
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:52,291
thereafter to live
as a commoner.

39
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:53,666
Stricken?

40
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,333
I had no idea such a
thing was possible.

41
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,125
Well, where the
public is concerned,

42
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,416
legally, it's not.

43
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,583
But it can be made to happen.

44
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,541
Provided the princess,
you, the king,

45
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:07,083
and I exercise discretion.

46
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,166
Her Highness is scheduled
to embark on a tour

47
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,541
of Peshi District
after the seventh,

48
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:14,791
traversing its coastal
archipelago by boat.

49
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:19,208
Her preference in craft
will be... intimate.

50
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:22,666
Only you shall
accompany her onboard.

51
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:26,000
Tragically, the boat
will be lost at sea.

52
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:30,250
In reality, you'll have
escorted Her Highness to Bon.

53
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,833
And this will be for her good?

54
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,625
The good of the nation.

55
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:37,125
Her Highness' activities
are causing disarray.

56
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:40,458
What motivates your decision
is of no import to me.

57
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:42,458
You are Princess Schnee's aide.

58
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:43,750
That is enough.

59
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:46,208
I accept the order.

60
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:48,333
I am most grateful.

61
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:51,291
There is one more thing
I would ask of you, Abend.

62
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,458
[ABEND]
Understood, sir.

63
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:59,500
Am I permitted
my family servant?

64
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:02,750
The man is as devoted
to me as I am to the Crown.

65
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,208
[QUALM]
Mmm?

66
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:06,333
[ABEND] He would find himself
entirely without purpose

67
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:07,500
if abandoned.

68
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:10,583
His fealty to my
family runs deep.

69
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:12,625
[QUALM] Does he have
a family of his own?

70
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,833
[ABEND]
A young son, yes.

71
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:17,333
Can he abandon him?

72
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:18,833
If I compel him.

73
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:22,875
[ABEND]
For the good of His Majesty,

74
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:25,375
what you order shall
be done, Mr. President.

75
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,208
[NINO'S DAD]
I'm coming with you.

76
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,875
[ABEND]
Yes, I thought as much.

77
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:37,458
So I've already secured the
Privy Council's permission.

78
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:39,916
[ABEND] You realize we
can never come back here?

79
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,416
Our lives in DMw
are effectively over.

80
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:45,166
[NINO'S DAD]
Of course.

81
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,458
But the cost is
far greater to you.

82
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:51,625
I lose a son, you lose rank,
home, family, everything.

83
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,791
I serve in pale imitation
of your sacrifice--

84
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:57,083
that is my lot.

85
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,958
You should begin packing.

86
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,583
[NINO'S DAD] May I visit
Honig Avenue one last time

87
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:04,791
before we go?

88
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:08,666
I'd very much
like to treat my son

89
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,250
to his favorite dessert.

90
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,375
Apple cake.

91
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:13,916
The boy can't get enough.

92
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,541
[ABEND] You're certain
you'll be able to leave him?

93
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,666
He'll be given to
the care of relatives.

94
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,791
Distant ones, but still.

95
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,125
To be an orphan yet
want for no comfort?

96
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:26,541
Not a cruel fate.

97
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,916
[ABEND]
Go to him.

98
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,083
[NINO'S DAD sighs]
Thank you, master.

99
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,333
[NINO'S DAD]
What did you hear?

100
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:42,833
That you're leaving me
after we get apple cake.

101
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:47,875
[NINO'S DAD]
Hold it!

102
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,208
I'm going, too!

103
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,250
For His Majesty!

104
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,166
There isn't much time.

105
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,083
Go enjoy your cake.

106
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:00,500
We leave tomorrow.

107
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:07,958
[SCHNEE] I've made my
peace with never seeing

108
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:09,416
the family again.

109
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,625
Life can't be properly lived
from atop an ivory tower.

110
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,750
Father, I'm indebted.

111
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:19,125
Thank you for letting me
escape into the world.

112
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:21,375
It's not a very
forgiving place.

113
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:23,083
All the more reason.

114
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:29,000
I have no desire to see
this nation torn apart.

115
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,958
Living out among the
people will instruct me

116
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:32,916
as to the needs of your kingdom.

117
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,625
I want its future
to be peaceful!

118
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:36,708
Not for my own sake,

119
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:38,583
but for the sake
of those people.

120
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,458
What the world teaches
me will one day be

121
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:43,250
of use to you,
Father, I promise.

122
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,625
[SCHNEE] Rest easy
knowing Qualm would never

123
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:52,541
have approved this had
he believed it harmful.

124
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,000
This is for the best.

125
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,500
Know it in your heart.

126
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:00,500
I only wish the toll on
Abend wasn't so great.

127
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:05,291
[FALKE II] We can only act on
the choices available to us,

128
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,541
my dear.

129
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:07,958
What else is there?

130
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:15,458
[FALKE II] Uncertainty is
our constant companion.

131
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:17,500
Regret needn't be.

132
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:21,750
[CITIZENS chattering]

133
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:22,833
[CITIZEN 8A]
Is it true?

134
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,416
Did the princess's
boat really sink?

135
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,250
[CITIZEN 8B]
There's no sign of them yet.

136
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,583
[CITIZEN 8C]
Why wouldn't she take a ship?

137
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:30,041
It doesn't make sense!

138
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:32,708
[CITIZEN 8D] Her Highness
belongs to the sea now.

139
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,208
[ABEND]
Your H--

140
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:42,625
[SCHNEE]
It's just a wig.

141
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,041
You ought to wear a hat.

142
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:50,875
Those snowy locks stand
out even more than my own.

143
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:54,708
Come, Abend.

144
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:00,083
Bon. Next stop.

145
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,458
[SCHNEE] My luggage
if you would, please.

146
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,583
[SCHNEE]
I think it's safe now.

147
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:20,916
You can lose the hat.

148
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,208
[SCHNEE]
From this point forward,

149
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,500
you no longer answer to my whim.

150
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:31,291
You're free to live as you will.

151
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:32,916
Though I'll admit...

152
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,875
I shall miss
your beautiful hair.

153
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:37,791
You go this way, I'll go that.

154
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,583
No turning back to see
the other disappear

155
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,791
into the crowd, agreed?

156
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,708
Thank you, Abend.

157
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:46,666
I wish you well. Goodbye.

158
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:00,333
[ABEND]
For the princess.

159
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:11,500
My word, Her Highness is
obsessed with sandwich bread.

160
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,208
Not that I can't
appreciate that.

161
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,208
I'm simply partial
to Bon's talent

162
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,125
for chocolates and what-not.

163
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:20,000
Found an odd one today:
chocolate-coated rice crackers.

164
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,208
Can you believe it?

165
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:23,875
Those are for you,
by the way, Niño.

166
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,333
Let me know what you think.

167
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,291
Nino!

168
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,291
[NINO'S DAD]
Heh. Sorry, sorry.

169
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:30,250
It's hard to keep
our names straight.

170
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:33,541
I'm too used to the ones
we had back home.

171
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:36,291
Keeping an eye on Princess
Schnee for His Majesty.

172
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:37,833
What a fine honor, eh?

173
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:45,416
Seems the princess met
a nice man at the bakery.

174
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,875
They're in love,
but his financial situation

175
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:49,125
isn't the best.

176
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:54,708
The master will take action,
I'm positive.

177
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,541
[NINO'S DAD]
Our Romeo has a job!

178
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:58,333
The master's using
private funds to build

179
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:01,625
an enormous residential
complex downtown!

180
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:04,416
The princess's true love will
be the building manager!

181
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,416
That's what we call a
well-timed stroke of luck.

182
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,875
They're over the moon!

183
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,791
Does she know
they're being watched?

184
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:22,291
I wonder if it's
a boy or a girl?

185
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,291
Well, I'm off!

186
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:28,875
Oh! Thanks for the sandwich.

187
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,750
I'll be home late,
so don't wait up.

188
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,875
[NINO'S DAD]
Right away, master.

189
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,833
I'll develop the photos at once.

190
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:40,875
They'll be included with
my report, of course.

191
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,541
[NINO] A chocolate place
that sells by weight.

192
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,958
Supposed to be pretty good.

193
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:02,958
But way over in
the northern sector?

194
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,625
Seems awfully far to go.

195
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,416
[NINO] I just stopped by
on the way home.

196
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,541
No big deal.

197
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,458
[NINO] You send the master
everything he asked for?

198
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,375
On the afternoon flight.

199
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:17,291
Taking pictures
comes easily enough.

200
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,916
Writing reports, though...

201
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,083
[NINO] 'Cause you treat 'em
like you're entering

202
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,041
a short story contest.

203
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:25,750
I think His Majesty
appreciates that approach,

204
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:26,666
don't you?

205
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,500
It's captivating.

206
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:29,875
Know your audience, son.

207
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,041
When his Majesty's happy,

208
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,083
the Privy Council
President's happy.

209
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:36,083
Which of course,
makes the master happy.

210
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:39,166
Which, it goes without saying,
makes you and I happy.

211
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,000
Mm! This chocolate
is incredible!

212
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,166
Oh, yeah? Heh.

213
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:45,083
[NINO'S DAD]
I'm glad you're here.

214
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,666
Really. I'm grateful
the master allowed me

215
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,500
to bring you along with us.

216
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,041
You've been great.

217
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,583
I came this close
to leaving you behind.

218
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:58,500
Honestly, I'm in awe you've
never held that against me.

219
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:01,333
[NINO] Well, to be fair,
it's not like you wanted to.

220
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:03,208
Duty always comes first.

221
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:07,083
I'm loyal to the master
as well, you know.

222
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,625
[NINO'S DAD sniffs]
I can see that.

223
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:11,916
Oh, c'mon,
don't get all dramatic.

224
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,250
[NINO'S DAD]
Sorry.

225
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,791
I just shudder to think
where'd I be without you.

226
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:19,083
The master's all alone.

227
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,208
[NINO] You didn't choose
that path for him, Dad.

228
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,666
He took it upon himself.

229
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:36,333
[NINO'S DAD]
Hey, Nino.

230
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,166
What was His Little
Highness up to today?

231
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,458
Playing around in
the park, mostly.

232
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:44,416
So, the princess...
she have bread-making class?

233
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,958
[NINO'S DAD] For a month now,
as a matter of fact.

234
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,041
Brought virtually a
whole bakery's worth

235
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:52,250
home with her today,
proud as could be.

236
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:55,125
I'm sure the prince
will stuff his face silly.

237
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,916
I wonder what his favorite is.

238
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,083
[NINO]
Look, Dad, I've been thinking.

239
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,541
Maybe we ought'a stop
calling him "the prince."

240
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:06,791
That means we'd have to
stop calling her "the princess."

241
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,208
Wait!

242
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:10,125
"Princess" could just be a
term of endearment, right?

243
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:13,083
Same with "prince."
No one need be the wiser!

244
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:15,333
Well? What do you think?

245
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,041
Sure. Whatever.

246
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:19,166
[NINO'S DAD] There's another
princess in the mix!

247
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,583
[NINO] Why don't we call them
"Lady Schnee" and "Little Miss?"

248
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:27,625
Perfect!

249
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:31,166
The prince is still
the prince, right?

250
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,375
[NINO'S DAD] There's been a
shortage of those in the family

251
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:35,875
the past few decades.

252
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,958
He's one of only two.

253
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,750
Yeah, but the one
born more recently

254
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,458
to the youngest princess--

255
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:44,250
he's the rightful heir
to the throne.

256
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:48,458
I suppose, even though
our prince is ten years older.

257
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:51,458
Legally, he's not
family, so, uh...

Guess what? Ha!

261
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:00,625
Our prince is enrolling
in high school!

262
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:02,083
[NINO]
Mm-hmm.

263
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,791
[NINO'S DAD] You now have
an official mission, my boy.

264
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:08,458
You'll be attending
the same classes!

Huh?

00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,458
Stay close to him
and keep him safe.

00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,125
I have the perfect
cover for you.

The high school

269
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:17,916
His Majesty will be
absolutely tickled pink!

But--

The king's always been
thrilled with my pictures.

Why wouldn't he love yours?
You're my son!

273
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:26,083
Become the prince's
friend and confidant.

274
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:28,000
Ooh! He might even
invite you over

275
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:30,208
to sample Lady Schnee's baking!

276
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:32,708
I'll have you write up
a report on how it tastes!

I'm twenty-five years old.

So you'll wear glasses!

Easiest way to
disguise your age!

280
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,416
[NINO'S DAD] Now, then, the

Yep.

How do I describe the flavor?

Did Lady Schnee recommend
how best to enjoy it?

Lots of butter, she said.

[NINO]
Yeah.

318
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:00,375
I'm watching it right now.

319
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:04,250
[ABEND] Their train derailed,
and fell into the ravine.

320
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:07,708
Your father was more
than likely onboard.

321
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:09,458
He'd have taken every
precaution to prevent

322
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:11,583
his and your connection
with the royal family

323
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:14,666
from coming to light
in the event of his death.

324
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,458
I need you in
Rokkusu immediately.

325
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,583
Collect anything your
father might've left behind

326
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:20,958
and come back.

327
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:24,708
[NINO]
Level with me.

328
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:26,666
This is the real reason
you let me come along

329
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,083
all those years ago, isn't it?

330
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:32,833
You knew I was standing
outside that door.

331
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:34,500
You knew I'd hear everything.

332
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:37,416
Look, just to be clear,

333
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,833
I didn't ask to
be part of all this

334
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:42,166
because I gave a damn
about you or His Majesty.

335
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,000
[ABEND]
You did it for your father.

336
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:47,791
[NINO] Yeah. My reasons
were totally selfish.

337
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:52,416
It's the same for you, right?

338
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,333
You weren't in this
to save the kingdom

339
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:56,500
or to please the
Privy Council President.

340
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:58,541
You were in it for her.

341
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:02,166
You'd sacrifice everything to
make Princess Schnee happy.

342
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,250
There's one thing
you need to get

343
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:32,416
beyond a shadow of a doubt.

344
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,833
Lady Schnee was stricken
from the DMwfamily register.

345
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:39,416
You have zero, and I mean zero,
claim to the throne.

346
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,041
I don't care
one way or the other.

347
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:43,916
You're my friend.

348
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,458
Who else was there for me
when my folks died?

349
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,666
[NINO] You got a kid sister,
don't'cha?

350
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,500
If you guys need anything,
give me a call.

351
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:58,208
I am a helluva lot better
in the kitchen than you.

352
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:06,416
[NINO] We made the choice
to watch over you and Lotta,

353
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,875
my "supervisor" and I.

354
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:12,791
I know you're not a
fan of being spied on.

355
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,708
But as long as
His Majesty's alive,

356
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:17,166
you'll have to grin and bear it.

357
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,625
Sorry, I'll do my damnedest
not to get noticed anymore.

358
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:31,833
[door opens, closes]

359
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,375
[LOTTA]
Welcome home!

360
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,208
This all for me?

361
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:36,750
Wow, you're the best!

362
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:39,708
Cool if I share it?

363
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,291
[LOTTA]
With Nino.

364
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:44,333
Uhh...

365
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:49,000
We might not being seeing
him for a while, actually.

366
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:51,208
[LOTTA]
Is he busy with work?

367
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:52,250
Yeah.

368
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:56,416
I guess you could say that.

369
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,041
Poor guy.

370
00:21:58,125 --> 00:21:59,458
Oh! That reminds me!

371
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:01,416
When your boss and I went
back to that amazing café

372
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,416
to thank them for
the New Year's cake...

373
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,041
...they gave us another one!

374
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:11,416
You know, you're
starting to look like Mom.

375
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,708
Maybe you always have.
I dunno.

376
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:14,750
[LOTTA]
Really?

377
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:20,333
[LOTTA laughs]

378
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,125
Shame we don't have a picture
of her as a little girl

379
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,291
for comparison.

380
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:27,625
[LOTTA] So, I'm just gonna
assume you want a piece.

381
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:34,541
[LOTTA]
It's apple cake.

382
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:08,250
[NINO]
Next time on <i>ACCA:</i>

383
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:10,250
<i>Thirteen Territory</i>
<i>Inspection Department</i> ...

384
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:12,916
"A Graceful Black Adder
Bares Its Fangs."

385
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,791
[NINO] Trouble's afoot, but
I'm sure those two'll be fine.

386
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:18,166
You'd be proud, Dad.

387
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:20,750
Our little prince has grown
into a fine young man.
