the scope of this

is beginning to take shape.

What do you want?

15
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,333
You wouldn't be here
without a reason, I'm sure.

I suppose not.

I take it your audit is done?

I still have the south sector,
but I leave tomorrow.

Something's on your mind.

20
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:38,625
Come, you have the look of
a man who's lost in thought.

21
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:40,791
Rokkusu's citizens
have good eyes.

22
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:44,666
I was thinkin' back.

23
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:49,291
An article I read in Koro¦

24
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:50,791
It was an interview with Mauve

25
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:53,041
when she was KoroÕs
Branch Director--

26
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:56,708
just after she'd been announced
as the new Director General.

27
00:02:56,791 --> 00:03:01,125
The office had a wall dedicated
to her called "Mauve Avenue."

28
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:02,875
She was the first woman
from their district

29
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:05,291
to hold such a
prestigious title.

30
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:07,750
Anyway, the article
was hanging there.

31
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:10,583
She mentioned you
in it by name, actually.

32
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:13,000
I was just mulling that over.

33
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,666
Nothing major.

34
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,708
That's all?

35
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:18,416
I'm lying.

36
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,458
Look, I know you've got
someone watching me.

37
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:23,250
I wouldn't trust him
if I were you.

38
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:27,375
He's not exactly a
straightforward guy.

39
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,875
There might be a fib
or two in his reports.

40
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:33,916
If you're trying to tell me
something, I don't follow.

41
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,875
My folks are gone.

42
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:39,333

They died in the big train
wreck thirteen years ago.

The one on the border
between here and Peshi.

45
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,291
Both districts
responded to the tragedy

46
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:49,500
in their own way.

47
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,583
Peshi washed its
hands of any blame.

48
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:58,083
Rokkusu took full responsibility
and reached out to the victims.

49
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,500
A Branch Chief
counseled them to do so.

50
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:03,041
That's what allowed ACCA to
take over the National Rail--

51
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:05,166
enforce standards.

52

safer now because of you.

is to build a better nation."

cited them in the interview.

You and Lotta are
gonna be there, right?

162
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,041
Promise you won't
sleep through it.

163
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,041
[JEAN]
Well, Lotta will be there.

164
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,375
Oh, come on!
You're the building manager!

165
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,416
Yeah, but I don't do anything.

166
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,583
[MOZ] Ooh, Knot!
You should totally join us!

167
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,541
[KNOT]
Love to, but I have to pass.

168
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:52,458
Kids and all.

169
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:54,583
[MOZ]
Oh, I forgot. Sorry.

170
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:55,958
Eh, eventually
they'll be old enough

171
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,250
for me to have a life, right?

172
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:58,583
It's only a matter of time.

173
00:08:58,666 --> 00:08:59,875
Why don't we just
have an after-party

174
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,000
here at our place?

175
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,416
When the little ones
get tuckered out,

176
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,375
they can crash in the bedroom
while we do our thing.

177
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,958
For that matter, the adults
can crash when they get tired.

178
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,708
There's plenty of room.

179
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:10,125
Take that outside, please.

180
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,666
We're a go.

181
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,208
Yay!

182
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,250
[MOZ, KELI, ATRI]
Cheers!

183
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:28,125
What the--?
Why is Mushroom Head here?

184
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:29,625
[LOTTA]
He with your department?

185
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,791
[JEAN]
No. Branch Office.

186
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,875
He sorta borrowed my lighter.

187
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:36,708
Huh. That's weird,
you're telling me he smokes?

188
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,125
Ehh.

189
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:40,166
Hey, speaking of cigarettes.

190
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,458
Ah! Good, he's gone.

191
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:42,625
Now's my chance!

192
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:43,708
Hello!

193
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:46,125
Oh, uh, hello there.
Happy New Year.

194
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:46,958
Yeah.

195
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,500
Happy New Year.

196
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:51,333
I heard you like DMw cake,
so I thought I'd bring you one.

197
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,750
Aww! How nice of you!

198
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,666
[LOTTA] Must be a thank you
for the lighter.

199
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,750
Aw! Talk about going
out of your way.

200
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,291
Jean's gonna love this!

201
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,000
What a sweetheart!

202
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,375
Oh, it's the chief!
About time, sir!

203
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:04,833
Happy New Year.

204
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:06,875
Sorry I'm late; traffic was bad.

205
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:09,375
Look--even Knot got to come
with his little ones.

206
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:10,750
[MOZ]
A kid's corner!

207
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:13,166
Whoever organized this party
thought of everything!

208
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,083
Yeah, it's nice he's able
to get out and unwind, huh?

209
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:17,791
[laughing]

210
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,041
[OWL]
Lotta.

211
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,708
Hey, Department Chief!

212
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,333
Happiest of New Years to you!

213
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:24,125
[LOTTA]
Happy New Year to you!

214
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:27,041
[RAIL gasps] That's the guy who
was having tea with her!

215
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,958
Well, they bake a cake
the people of DMw

216
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:30,500
ring in the holiday with.

217
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:31,541
Thought you'd like one.

218
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,833
[LOTTA] Ah!
Oh, this is too much!

219
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,291
Thank you!

220
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:36,875
[RAIL] He might be a bigger
problem than the brother.

221
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,250
[MAN 1A]
Jean!

222
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:40,750
Happy New Year!

223
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,041
[JEAN]
Back at'cha.

224
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:44,041
[MAN 1A] Feel free to
join us for a smoke.

225
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:46,708
[JEAN]
Don't mind if I do.

226
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:49,166
Oh, much obliged, by the way.

227
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,375
Fasu purchased fifty of
our donut vending machines.

228
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,333
[RESIDENT 6B] Things are
going well for us, too.

229
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:57,000
My company's now doing
business in JumMku.

230
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,208
Huh. That's great.

231
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,375
Yes, it is.

232
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,375
Can we still count
on you for this year?

233
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:02,583
O'course.

234
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,208
[LOTTA]
Look at this!

235
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:05,833
It's so cute!

236
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:18,875
Look at these people.

237
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,291
So high class.

238
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:21,583
But if it's not your building,

239
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:24,083
how come you live on
the top floor like a boss?

240
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,583
I'm guessing your
family's been doing this

241
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:27,041
for generations?

242
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:28,708
Just started with my folks.

243
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,375
Wait, are you serious?

244
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:31,541
Uh-huh.

245
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,375
No idea how we wound
up with this place.

246
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:36,416
So introduce us to
the landlord already.

247
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,458
I don't think he's here.

248
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:40,208
Not that I know
what he looks like.

249
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:41,583
[GROUP]
Huh?

250
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:44,083
Not a detail-oriented
kinda guy, are you?

251
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,166
I always thought you were
just a really private person,

252
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,958
but I'm starting to think you
don't have much of a life

253
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,416
to be private about.

254
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,458
[JEAN]
Hm.

255
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:54,500
[bell ringing]

256
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,541
[MAUVE] It's been a hundred
years since ACCA was founded.

257
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,000
Still...

258
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:08,875
It looks as though I'll
have to make the first move.

259
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:16,750
[MAUVE] As our
organization steps proudly

260
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:19,250
into the dawn of
its next century,

261
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:21,416
I expect you all to
redouble your commitment

262
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,000
to what we do.

263
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,875
Never forget:
when push comes to shove,

264
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,541
you stand with ACCA.

265
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:30,375
We protect the livelihoods
of all citizens.

266
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,166
[ATRI] That feel like
the same First of the Year

267
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,916
All-Hands Meeting
we always have?

268
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,250
[MOZ] You'd think it'd
be different for the big

269
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:36,666
anniversary.

270
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,833
[KELI] Well, I've heard
turnout's supposed to be huge

271
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:41,083
for the official centennial.

272
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:43,333
Right, still got that comin' up.

273
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:45,000
Don't be surprised
if the ceremony ends

274
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,583
with new assignments
for all of us in Inspection.

275
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,458
I mean, everyone'll be there.

276
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:50,791
I wonder if the
Deputy Chief will get

277
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,291
his transfer request.

278
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:54,708
I have a feeling we can
look forward to things staying

279
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,125
exactly how they are.

280
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,166
Yup.

281
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,250
If I've learned one thing,
it's to count on my team

282
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,041
from the KoroÃdays.

283
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:04,625
You're still fast as ever.

284
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:06,166
Luckily, ma'am,
the Powers That Be

285
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,166
permit you to rely on us
from time-to-time

286
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,416
in your capacity
as Director General.

287
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,458
And of course, no one
is particularly troubled

288
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,333
at the thought of our
putting an ear to the ground

289
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,833
in preparation
for the centennial.

290
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:20,041
Who would suspect we're
investigating rumors of a coup?

291
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:23,125
Truth be told,
I did hesitate to involve you.

292
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,541
Blowback could be severe.

293
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:26,791
If you'd been forced to act,

294
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:29,208
those in the know
would be made aware.

295
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:32,250
I've been ordered to
cease my own inquiries.

296
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,833
But, thankfully,
based on this report,

297
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:37,708
the danger does not
appear to be imminent.

298
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,916
His Majesty's health
was a concern.

299
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,708
I suppose he's well enough,
from what we've seen.

300
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:46,625
A coup would hinge on the
state of the royal family.

301
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:48,541
Meanwhile, the districts
are humming along,

302
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,708
business as usual.

303
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:53,708
That said, I'm not
completely satisfied.

304
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,125
Oh? Why is that, ma'am?

305
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,500
Upon returning home,

306
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,375
I had a chance to meet
with KoroÃBranch

307
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:02,083
Chief Grise and
District Chief Crème.

308
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:05,333
I casually mentioned the
potential coup in conversation.

309
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:09,333
The way they reacted
seemed rather odd.

310
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,375
Something is going on.

311
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:12,958
We'll look into it.

312
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:14,083
[MAUVE]
Please do.

313
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,791
And what of the
uprising in Suitsu

314
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:19,500
and subsequent cover-up?

315
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:21,458
I'm aware there's been a
great deal of whitewashing

316
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,583
in the past,
but not of this magnitude,

317
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:26,291
and not during my
tenure in this post.

318
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:29,666
Otus was conducting an audit
at the time of the uprising.

319
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,500
What an embarrassment
to Inspection.

320
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,541
The man's incompetent at best.

321
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:36,500
He was likely protecting
a subordinate.

322
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:39,291
Jean is quite loyal
to the department.

323
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:42,541
To a fault, perhaps.

324
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:46,416
Evidently, I can't say the
same for his loyalty to me.

325
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,583
One more thing.

326
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:50,083
I have no solid proof
as of yet, but...

327
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:53,875
on the subject of Grossular's
suspected involvement...

328
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,041
Let's hear it.

329
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:58,791
Yes, of course.

330
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,375
I will do as you say.

331
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:06,750
Look, I know you've
got somebody watching me.

332
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:09,666
I wouldn't trust him
if I were you.

333
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,500
How the devil did the man
know he was being tailed?

334
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:13,541
[sighs]

335
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,833
Look at that, Grossular's
actually slumming it

336
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:22,416
in the common room
with the rest of us.

337
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,291
Whad'ya know?

338
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:24,916
We're a hundred years old now.

339
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,500
If there's a time to be
unconventional, this is it.

340
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,333
[LILIUM]
Can I help you?

341
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,375
Why did you tell Otus
that we assigned someone

342
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,666
to spy on him?

343
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,500
I hoped it would goad
him into taking action.

344
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,708
And that didn't
strike you as careless?

345
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,333
[LILIUM]
My apologies.

346
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:46,875
[GROSSULAR] You've been
getting rather careless,

347
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:48,500
Chief Officer Lilium.

348
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:50,041
I would watch myself.

349
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:52,875
Duly noted.

350
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,833
Now if you don't mind, I'd like
you to share everything you have

351
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:57,083
on Jean Otus
with the rest of us.

352
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,750
How we proceed
must be determined

353
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,791
by formal discussion.

354
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,916
ACCA's future may
be on the line.

355
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:06,916
Very well. I agree.

356
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:16,250
All things considered,
I'd say I won that round.

357
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,750
[RAINY]
All right! Bring on the grub!

358
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,375
[STAFF 6B]
Coming!

359
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:24,625
[RAINY]
Go on, Mr. Otus!

360
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:27,416
Dig in! Have your fill!

361
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,000
[JEAN]
"Mr. Otus?" Please.

362
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,583
Didn't I have you call me
Jean last time I was here?

363
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:33,708
Oh! Yeah, right!

364
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,666
Sure nice of ya
to travel all this way.

365
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,500
Hey, sweetheart! More beer!

366
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:42,541
You're, uh, really getting
the red-carpet treatment, sir.

367
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:43,625
I can see that.

368
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:46,083
Ah, there we go! [laughs]

369
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:47,833
The locals sure are cheerful.

370
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:51,083
True, but they're laying it
on extra thick for you today.

371
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,625
I like the energy.

372
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:55,125
Well, they have the
highest life expectancy,

373
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:56,916
and the food here's delicious.

374
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,666
[RAINY]
Ah! District Chief!

375
00:16:58,750 --> 00:16:59,666
Howdy!

376
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,583
Sorry I couldn't roll in sooner!

377
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,458
Okay, even he's here?

378
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:04,666
What is this?

379
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,708
Pleasure having
you here, Mr. Otus.

380
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:08,791
I'm Sereno, the District Chief.

381
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:09,875
Nice to meet'cha.

382
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:11,541
You know, son,
from far away you cut

383
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,291
a damn imposin' figure.

384
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:16,416
But to be honest, you're ten
times as impressive up close.

385
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,583
Like a classic action-hero!

386
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:21,083
What's impressive
is Hare District.

387
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,541
I mean, look at you guys!

388
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:23,750
Aw, go on.

389
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,875
We're just a pair of
crusty ol' wind bags.

390
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:27,208
Hey, he doesn't look it,

391
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:29,208
but the District Chief is
turning 91 years young

392
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,500
in a few months!

393
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,000
[JEAN]
That's incredible!

394
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:34,125
[RAINY] Next to this one,
I'm still wet behind the ears!

395
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,583
[laughs]

396
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:37,291
But there are people
here even older.

397
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:41,500
Heck, some were alive during the
big coup a hundred years ago!

398
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:44,041
[JEAN] And what about
the new possible coup?

399
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:48,666
[JEAN] If I don't dig up
something to give her,

400
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,000
I'm screwed.

401
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:52,708
[SERENO] I hate to make
you talk shop, but...

402
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,083
How's it comin' along?

403
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:55,000
[JEAN]
I'm sorry?

404
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,833
Oh, uh, well, y'know.

405
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,291
I was curious about the audits,

406
00:17:58,375 --> 00:17:59,875
what with you makin'
all the rounds.

407
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:02,375
[JEAN]
Ah. This is my seventh.

408
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,916
So! How are things goin'
in other districts?

409
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,791
[SERENO] Forget it.
It's none of our business.

410
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:09,125
Strong fences make
good neighbors, eh?

411
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,375
[RAINY]
True enough!

412
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,375
You're the intermediary for the
rebels planning a coup d'état.

413
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:16,833
[JEAN]
I get it.

414
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:20,083
That's the role they think
I'm supposed to be playing.

415
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:21,416
I'll be damned.

416
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,208
These old-timers are
pumping me for info

417
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:26,250
on how the other districts
feel about a coup.

418
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,125
I should draw 'em out more.

419
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:32,416
If I play the part, I might
walk away with something useful.

420
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,166
Okay, how do I do this?

421
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,333
Here. Have at it...
if it's not too much.

422
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:38,375
[PARUS gasps]

423
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:40,666
No. Thank you, sir.
That's perfect.

424
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,000
[JEAN] Maybe I should
just get them drunk.

425
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:46,958
Why not? Works when Nino
wants me to run my mouth.

426
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,166
Some more?

427
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,916
Absolutely, but you first!

428
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,750
No, no. You first. I insist.

429
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:55,458
[SERENO] I like a man
who respects his elders!

430
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,750
[JEAN]
That was worth it, I s'pose.

431
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:09,083
Just bits and pieces,
but better than nothing.

432
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,500
[SERENO snoring]

433
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,833
[RAINY]
We should do this more often.

434
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:14,833
[JEAN] I know it's for
the Director General.

435
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:18,250
But it sucks doin' to them
what I hate having done to me.

436
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,500
[NINO]
Nice work.

437
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:21,666
Wanna drink?

438
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,333
Yeah, no.

439
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,958
[JEAN] I can't tell
if the info as any good,

440
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,583
but it's gotta be better
than showing up empty-handed.

441
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,750
[JEAN]
I don't think she's coming.

442
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:42,875
Oh, well.

443
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,041
[STAFF 6A]
Privy Council President, sir.

444
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,333
His Highness, Prince Schwan,

445
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:50,583
wishes to see you
when it's convenient.

446
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:54,833
[SCHWAN] The painting I had
specially commissioned

447
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:57,333
for my coming-of-age
is now complete.

448
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:59,208
I'd like to hang it.

449
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:01,208
In the Royal Family
Portrait Hall.

450
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:03,666
Very good, Your Highness.

451
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,666
I shall see that it gets done.

452
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,208
I wish to pick a
place for it myself.

453
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:11,166
Please grant me permission
to enter the Hall.

454
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,750
Grandfather considers
it something of a

455
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,041
"private sanctuary."

456
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,791
I dare not waltz in
without asking your leave.

457
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,666
Thank you, Qualm.
I shall take your stone-faced

458
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,958
silence as a yes.

459
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:24,708
Oh, and no need for staff.
I'll manage alone.

460
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:26,541
You may enter, Highness.

461
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:29,833
But I'm afraid only on condition
that we of the Privy Council

462
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:32,125
carry the portrait
in question for you.

463
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:39,916
I haven't set foot in
this room for ten years.

464
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,083
Where would you
like the painting?

465
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:46,000
That seems an ideal spot.

466
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:49,791
This is where grandfather sits
to collect his thoughts, yes?

467
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:53,208
Let us hang it here to keep
him in mind of the future.

468
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:54,541
And of me.

469
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:00,666
Well, Highness? Did you?

470
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,666
[SCHWAN]
It's in the perfect place.

471
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,791
I'm very happy to hear that.

472
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:07,041
And what of our
plans for the bakery?

473
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:08,625
Still on?

474
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:12,583
I don't recall that topic being
a point of discussion, Magie.

475
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:14,375
[MAGIE] Might I humbly
recommend His Highness

476
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:18,208
journey to Bon before he
dismisses the idea out of hand?

477
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:20,625
It's important to
broaden one's horizons.

478
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,166
[SCHWAN]
I see the appeal.

479
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:27,083
And as future king, it behooves
me to learn of the world.

480
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:28,250
Notwithstanding...

481
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:31,250
Our family is a slave
to its traditions.

482
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:35,208
We dislike our women and
children to wander from home.

483
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:37,791
I've never ventured
past the borders of DMw

484
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:42,291
All due to a now-thirty-three
year old tragedy.

485
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,708
Thank you.
And in other news,

486
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:51,708
today marks two years since
the last recorded accident

487
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,333
in the transportation industry.

488
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:55,708
[LOTTA]
Wow! That's good to hear!

489
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:57,625
[JEAN] The Transportation
Department is constantly

490
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:59,041
making improvements.

491
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:00,750
So's the Medical Department.

492
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,416
People's lives are
measurably improving

493
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,083
'cause of how things
are being run.

494
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:06,708
ACCA's popularity must
be through the roof.

495
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:08,125
[LOTTA]
Ta-da.

496
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:09,208
You made more toast?

497
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:10,458
[LOTTA] Problem?
What else you want me

498
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:12,666
to do with all the bread
you buy from Mugimaki?

499
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,625
You can choke down
one more slice.

500
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:20,666
[JEAN]
Popularity, huh?

501
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,666
[ANNOUNCER 6A] This is the final
boarding call for Flight BD022

502
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,500
with non-stop service to DMw

503
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:27,208
Any passengers still
in the travel lounge

504
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:29,708
are asked to make their way
to Gate 9 immediately.

505
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:07,916
[NINO]
Next time on <i>ACCA:</i>

506
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,125
<i>Thirteen Territory</i>
<i>Inspection Department</i> ...

507
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:12,708
"The Truth Emerges
in the Night Mists."

508
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:14,791
[NINO] Seriously?
He's already on his eighth?

509
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:17,333
Come on, man. Sheesh.
[laughs]

510
00:24:17,416 --> 00:24:19,541
Stop and smell the
roses once in a while.
