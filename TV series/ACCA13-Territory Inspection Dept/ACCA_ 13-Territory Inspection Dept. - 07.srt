1
00:00:14,291 --> 00:00:16,041
[EGRET] I'm betting
you could use a break.

2
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:17,958
I'll go make us some tea.

3
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:19,541
Sounds good, thanks.

4
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:20,791
Can I smoke?

5
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:22,750
Keep it in here, please.

6
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:25,708
Don't let the residents
of DMwsee you indulge.

7
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:33,458
[JEAN] Going by the info
I picked up in Hare,

8
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:37,000
seems all the districts
know about the coup d'état.

9
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:39,291
They think I'm making the
rounds as a go-between--

10
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:42,291
running messages
for fellow dissidents.

11
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,541
So far, no one's
done anything--

12
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:47,500
they're just waiting
to see how this unfolds.

13
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:49,708
Makes me wonder
what's really going on.

14
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,625
Wherever I go,
it's the same story.

15
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:56,500
High-ranking officials
assume I'm part of it.

16
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:58,458
That's gotta be why
Grossular has eyes on me

17
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:00,333
around the clock, right?

18
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:03,250
Still, not everyone
agrees with him.

19
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:07,500
Grossular oughta
to vet his sources better,

20
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:08,833
though I wouldn't
put it past him

21
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:10,833
to have started
this intentionally.

22
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:14,083
If there is a coup d'état,
he's the mastermind.

23
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:16,708
[JEAN] Chief Officer Lilium,
for example--

24
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:19,416
He thinks I'm clean--
that I'm just being set up.

25
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,208
But he's stuck on the
idea this whole thing

26
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:23,875
is somehow
Grossular's brainchild.

27
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,791
He's got my back in
exchange for helping him

28
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:27,583
get to the bottom of this.

29
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:29,708
[LILIUM] ACCA may
be rocked to its core,

30
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:33,333
but law and order will prevail.

31
00:01:33,416 --> 00:01:35,166
[JEAN] And then there's
Director General Mauve,

32
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,083
asking me to dig up dirt
while I'm on my audits.

33
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:40,041
Jean, I need your help.

34
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:41,458
[JEAN] But apparently,
she hasn't heard

35
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:44,500
I'm the supposed intermediary
for coup sympathizers.

36
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:49,041
[JEAN] I can't tell what
the other Chief Officers

37
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:51,416
really think, but for
all intents and purposes,

38
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,708
it looks like they're
onboard with Lilium.

39
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:57,625
Afraid the rumor mill
has it right for once.

40
00:01:57,708 --> 00:01:58,958
[JEAN]
To top it all off,

41
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:01,208
Grossular went so far
as to hire my best friend

42
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:02,708
to keep tabs on me.

43
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,333
[JEAN]
If Nino has a stake in this,

44
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:08,958
damned if I know what it is.

45
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:13,958
Right now, everything
hinges on the Royal Family.

46
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:16,208
How much longer will
His Majesty King Falke

47
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:17,541
stay on the throne?

48
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:20,791
Wait...

49
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:22,916
What's the point of setting
me up as an intermediary

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,875
in the first place?

51
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:26,583
That's never made sense.

52
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:01,000
[QUALM] I trust security
will be airtight?

53
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:02,833
Oh, absolutely, sir.

54
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,000
[MOND]
You seem relaxed, Magie.

55
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:09,125
No doubt because tomorrow's
outing doesn't involve you.

56
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm counting on you
to take special care

57
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,666
of His Highness while
the rest of us are gone.

58
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,750
[MAGIE]
Of course.

59
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,166
[MOND]
Whatever befalls Prince Schwan,

60
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,916
you are to remain at his side.

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,666
Worried the past
will repeat itself, sir?

62
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:25,375
[MAGIE] The incident
thirty-three years ago?

63
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:29,083
[MOND] We exist solely
for the protection

64
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:31,416
of the DMwRoyal Family.

65
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,666
Difficult to perform
at the best of times,

66
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,708
every so often that
duty is impossible.

67
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,250
The ship sank, Magie.

68
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,291
The king lost his most
prized possession

69
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:44,750
and we our beloved
brother-in-arms.

70
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:47,916
[MAGIE] The prince wishes
to see the world.

71
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,583
[MOND]
Oh?

72
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,458
[MAGIE] A strange desire,
I'll grant you,

73
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,750
but one likely driven by
his impending assumption

74
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,875
of the throne.

75
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:57,791
[MOND]
I see.

76
00:04:57,875 --> 00:04:59,166
If that time comes,

77
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,125
still, you must remain
at his Highness's side

78
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:03,250
and protect him, Magie.

79
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:16,666
Wow, you're awfully bundled up.

80
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,291
[NINO] This DMwwind
cuts right through a man.

81
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,791
[JEAN]
Huh.

82
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:22,708
[NINO]
Buying Lotta a present?

83
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:25,000
[JEAN]
More like running an errand.

84
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,791
She wants these.

85
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:28,125
They're called snowballs.

86
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:30,666
Knot bought some
for his kids last time.

87
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,625
She's kind of obsessed.

88
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,791
Snowballs! Gimme!

89
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,208
[JEAN]
Only problem...

90
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:37,958
We got 'em at the morning
market while we were here.

91
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:40,750
I have no clue where
the actual store is.

92
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:42,375
[NINO]
Good news--it's up ahead.

93
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:43,916
Bad news--they're closed.

94
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,791
I can bring you
back tomorrow, though.

95
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:47,125
When's your audit done?

96
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:49,041
[JEAN]
His Majesty's having a day out,

97
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:51,208
so I have to put things on hold.

98
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,458
I'm free whenever.

99
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:55,541
Cool. Whaddya say
we make it three?

100
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,791
You'll wanna try
their signature cake.

101
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,500
Is it chocolate?

102
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:02,083
Apple, and outta this world.

103
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,750
Someone's expanding
his dessert palate.

104
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:07,250
You'll be a fan. Trust me.

105
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,916
 When did you get
to be such a connoisseur?

106
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,916
Don't wear your uniform.

107
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,375
Makes you stand out.

108
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:16,333
[JEAN] But this is the
only outfit I packed.

109
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:17,583
[NINO]
'Course it is.

110
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:22,083
[JEAN] Wonder if there's
snow in the forecast.

111
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,166
[LOTTA laughs]

112
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,958
I'm in paradise!

113
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:31,000
They're gigantic and
there's so many!

114
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,041
[alarm clock rings]

115
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,291
This is torture.

116
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:37,916
I need them now.

117
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:42,625
Don't forget.

118
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,125
You promised me, Jean.

119
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:48,750
It's snowing!

120
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:59,250
So, uh, what was that you
said about standing out?

121
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:00,875
[NINO]
What, is it too much?

122
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,708
[JEAN]
Little bit.

123
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:05,541
[NINO] The owner and I
don't exactly get along.

124
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:12,375
[JEAN]
Lotta's gonna be over the moon.

125
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:14,125
[NINO]
What'cha getting for yourself?

126
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,208
[JEAN]
One of these snowballs, please.

127
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:18,333
[NINO]
His Majesty's favorite, I hear.

128
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:21,458
The Royal Family
adores this place.

129
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,000
The king really does have
a thing for sweets, huh?

130
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,625
[NINO] A slice each of the
white chocolate and the apple.

131
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:28,458
For here, please.

132
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,375
[CLERK 7A]
Pay no mind to them.

133
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,250
We're enjoying a
royal visit today.

134
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:35,125
--[JEAN] Huh?
--Oh. You didn't know?

135
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,083
Whenever His Majesty's
out and about,

136
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:39,666
he pays a visit to
a favorite patisserie.

137
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,125
We should probably go.

138
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:43,416
[OWNER 7A]
That won't be necessary.

139
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,000
You're welcome to stay.

140
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:47,166
The king requests that
we do business as usual

141
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,958
while he's here.

142
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:53,041
He enjoys hobnobbing with fellow
confectionery enthusiasts.

143
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:55,250
Sit anywhere but
the farthest table.

144
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,166
That one's reserved
for His Majesty.

145
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,708
Well, the owner
seems nice enough.

146
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:03,666
[NINO] He's just in a good mood
'cause he's got bragging rights.

147
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,041
[OWNER 7A] Remove your hat
and sunglasses, please.

148
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,500
That fellow there.

149
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:14,125
If memory serves, he's with
ACCA's Inspection Department.

150
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:15,375
You don't suppose he came here

151
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,750
because of His Majesty's
visit, do you, sir?

152
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:20,291
We only learned of it
ourselves this morning.

153
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,041
Surely a coincidence.

154
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:24,625
The inconceivable gall of
him showing his face here,

155
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:27,416
though, and who's
that man with him?

156
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:33,500
[MOND] Hmm, if there's
any cause for concern,

157
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:36,125
I'm certain Qualm will
signal us right away.

158
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,458
[JEAN]
This is amazing.

159
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:43,958
Mind if try a bite of yours?

160
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:46,500
Let no one say you don't
have nerves of steel.

161
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:48,000
[JEAN]
Huh?

162
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:50,291
[NINO] Most folks in this
situation couldn't even breathe,

163
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,291
and here you are
making chitchat.

164
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,208
[JEAN] What?
They told us to act normal.

165
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:56,291
It's not like I'm being
loud or anything.

166
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:00,166
Do you like the snowball?

167
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,500
[JEAN]
Yes, Your Majesty.

168
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,291
You've excellent taste,
my friend.

169
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:04,708
[JEAN]
Thank you, Majesty.

170
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:07,333
[QUALM] If it pleases my liege,
he's with Inspection.

171
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:08,750
Isn't that right?

172
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:09,958
[JEAN]
Yes.

173
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:12,166
Yet you appear to be
draped in local finery.

174
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,250
[JEAN]
Oh, uh...

175
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,166
I only brought my
uniform, you see.

176
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,750
These clothes are on loan
from my friend here.

177
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:20,083
Ah, yes, the photographer.

178
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:22,333
From the coming-of-age ceremony.

179
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,333
[NINO] Thank you for allowing
me to take pictures,

180
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:25,625
Your Majesty.

181
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,875
Some of the shots
I got were incredible.

182
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,250
[FALKE II]
Oh, no.

183
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:32,166
'Tis we should be thanking you.

184
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,916
I'm honored, Majesty.

185
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,500
[FALKE II] Would you fine young
gentlemen care to join us?

186
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:41,916
We cannot possibly eat
all of this ourselves.

187
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,833
[NINO]
The answer's yes.

188
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,541
You don't refuse a king.

189
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,208
[QUALM]
Here, please.

190
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:49,833
Would Your Majesty
be all right with me

191
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:51,375
taking photographs?

192
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,791
I promise not to publish them.

193
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:54,875
[FALKE II]
Mmm.

194
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,916
[JEAN] That was a
hell of a day, wasn't it?

195
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,166
[NINO]
Yes. Yes, it was.

196
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:22,041
It's not often I get thanked,
let alone by royalty.

197
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,958
Lotta and I thank you
all the damn time.

198
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,875
[NINO]
I meant in my line of work.

199
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,208
[JEAN] Rare to see him
so plastered.

200
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:33,125
[NINO] Like getting praise
from your boss.

201
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,375
[JEAN] I didn't even know
you had one of those.

202
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,208
[NINO chuckles]
Yeah.

203
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,375
Not a lot of praise outta him.

204
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,833
When I see the guy,
he just lays into me.

205
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,166
Like last time.

206
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,083
I shouldn't even be
talking to you like this.

207
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:50,791
Bastard'll never let me
hear the end of it.

208
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,583
[JEAN]
Sounds like a handful.

209
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:55,625
You like what you do
that much, pal?

210
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:58,208
[NINO]
It not about whether I like it.

211
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:01,125
Honestly, I'm not
even s'posed to.

212
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,791
But, then again...

213
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:05,166
I guess I kind of do.

214
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,500
It's why I get told off
all the time.

215
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:10,833
[NINO snoring]

216
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,750
[JEAN]
Did he just pass out?

217
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,416
Good choice, Schwan.

218
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,666
It's lovely.

219
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,875
Come, grandfather.

220
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:29,125
Which painting do you
like the best?

221
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,541
[FALKE II]
Why, all of them, naturally.

222
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:41,625
[CLERK 7B]
Our new mugwort walnut bread.

223
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:43,500
Would you like to
try a free sample?

224
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,208
Thank you.

225
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:47,750
[CLERK 7B] I'm afraid it looks
like the Director General

226
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,833
is a no-show today.

227
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:51,083
[door closes]

228
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,583
[JEAN]
Is she avoiding me?

229
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,750
[LOTTA]
Mmm, delicious!

230
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:02,000
How much flour did they use?

231
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,208
I love how the powdered
sugar and the white chocolate

232
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,333
make it look like
a real snowball!

233
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:07,500
Oh, did I tell you?

234
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,375
It actually snowed
the other day!

235
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:10,958
[JEAN]
Same thing in DMw

236
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:12,166
[LOTTA]
Yeah?

237
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,125
I'd give anything to be
there when it snows!

238
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,375
Must look like a fairy tale!

239
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:18,458
You're really into
that place, aren'cha?

240
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:19,416
Big time.

241
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,125
Mm-hmm. It's great!

242
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,750
You agree, right?

243
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,708
I mean, you go
to all the districts.

244
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:27,625
Which one is your fave?

245
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:30,250
[JEAN]
DMws pretty good, I guess.

246
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,750
But if I had to go with
a favorite, it'd be Bon.

247
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,041
[LOTTA]
I'm with you there.

248
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,750
Home sweet home.

249
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:39,458
I bet everyone likes
their own district best.

250
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,041
[LOTTA]
Where you head to next?

251
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,625
It's soon, right?

252
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:43,708
[JEAN]
Yeah.

253
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,166
I'll get Nino to take you out.

254
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,375
I thought he was
crazy busy, too.

255
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:48,500
[chuckles]

256
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,750
The Department Chief
and I have plans.

257
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,333
We're going to hit up the
café where they make

258
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,833
that marvelous
New Year's cake, so...

259
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,500
You don't have
to worry about me.

260
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,750
[JEAN]
All right. If you say so.

261
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,125
Where you off to?

262
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:01,583
[JEAN]
Koro¦

263
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:02,583
Bring back chocolate!

264
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:03,750
[JEAN]
Yeah, yeah.

265
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,750
[LOTTA]
Seriously, they're known for it!

266
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,166
[JEAN]
Are they now?

267
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,458
I can count on Nino
being there, then.

268
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,875
[NINO]
Several persons of note in Hare

269
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,791
seem to have taken a proactive
stance toward the coup.

270
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:19,125
[NINO] KoroÃdoesn't follow
the lead of other districts,

271
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,166
so we might see some
developments there.

272
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,000
I'll be on the lookout.

273
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:26,708
[phone beeping]

274
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:31,916
[NINO]
Thank you for waiting.

275
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,625
I wrapped up my report
to Chief Officer Grossular.

276
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:38,416
I'm heading out
to KoroÃtomorrow.

277
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,041
DMw

278
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:42,791
Pretty smooth,
all things considered.

279
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:46,708
Yes, I made sure to send
photographs in with my report.

280
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,375
I know. I'm fast.

281
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,125
I haven't had more than
a few hours' sleep

282
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:52,416
since we've been back.

283
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,125
Fatigue's starting to
get to me, but oh, well.

284
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:58,583
It's nothing a little
chocolate can't take care of.

285
00:13:58,666 --> 00:13:59,750
Yeah.

286
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,583
KoroÃDistrict, that's right.

287
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,541
Understood. Talk soon.

288
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,875
It's been thirty years?

289
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,666
Man, I'm gettin' old.

290
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:17,500
[ÉBÈNE] Why would the
Director General entrust him

291
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,125
with such an important mission?

292
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,541
[CARMIN]
Excuse me!

293
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,458
[ÉBÈNE]
Keep your voice down.

294
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:26,291
[CARMIN]
I'm sorry. Take a look.

295
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,500
[ÉBÈNE] He's connected
to coup sympathizers!

296
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:31,625
I knew it!

297
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,833
[ÉBÈNE gasps]
Wait a sec.

298
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,833
[MAUVE]
I see. Jean Otus.

299
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:44,000
And he's presently
in Koro^ yes?

300
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:51,291
[JEAN]
Why were they staring at me?

301
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:54,291
Probably because they've heard
I'm mixed up in the coup,

302
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:57,625
specifically that
I'm a supporter.

303
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:59,833
I wonder if I'll have
a chance to explain myself

304
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:02,375
to the Director General
once they've talked to her.

305
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,166
[GRISE]
Welcome to KoroÃDistrict.

306
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:06,583
[JEAN]
Branch Chief Grise.

307
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,958
[GRISE]
You must be exhausted.

308
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:15,041
I recommend catching up on
your rest while you're here.

309
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:16,416
I, uh...

310
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,708
[GRISE] Other districts
wine and dine you, I'm sure.

311
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,875
Regrettably, that won't
be the case with us.

312
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:25,041
The District Chief and myself
are quite firm in that regard.

313
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,916
Men may prefer the
more roundabout approach.

314
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,125
We do not.

315
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,500
[JEAN] Didn't feel like
the right time to push

316
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,458
the coup d'état question.

317
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:37,208
[LARUS]
Deputy Chief.

318
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:38,875
I've made the travel
arrangements for your

319
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,291
sector audits tomorrow, sir.

320
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,000
[JEAN]
Great, thanks.

321
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:45,125
Efficient as always.

322
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:48,208
Enough to make a
guy feel kinda useless.

323
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,833
[LARUS] Can I help it if
women are slightly superior?

324
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:54,416
Not that we don't have our share
of competent men, of course.

325
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,083
I am curious about DMw

326
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:57,333
[JEAN]
Hm?

327
00:15:57,416 --> 00:16:00,666
Does His Majesty appear
to be in good health?

328
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,666
[JEAN]
Far as I can tell, yeah.

329
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,291
I only worry for ACCA's future.

330
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,583
We all do.

331
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,833
[LARUS] Our fate is anyone's
guess when the next ruler

332
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,125
assumes the throne.

333
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,250
[SCHWAN'S AUNT]
Schwan, my dear.

334
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:19,291
To what do I owe this most
unexpected pleasure?

335
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:22,208
[SCHWAN] I hope we find you
in merry mood, Auntie darling.

336
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,791
What can I do for you?

337
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:26,791
[SCHWAN]
I wish to be told a story.

338
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,416
What sort of story?

339
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,541
[SCHWAN] An incident which
occurred when my mother

340
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:33,041
was too young to remember.

341
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,833
I thought if anyone's in
a position to lift the veil,

342
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:38,666
it must be be her older sister.

343
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:42,666
Tell me of your middle sister
and how she met her end.

344
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,791
It has been thirty-three years.

345
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,500
Give me the details.

346
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:51,583
So many shops here.

347
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:53,750
How'm I supposed to know
which ones are any good?

348
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:01,000
[JEAN] I'd pick Nino's
brain, but he's MIA.

349
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,666
Fascinating report I
was given this morning.

350
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,750
About you.

351
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,583
[JEAN]
Director General, I can explain.

352
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:21,208
It's all hearsay.
This stuff takes on a life.

353
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,791
You're royalty, Jean Otus.

354
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,875
First in the line of succession.

355
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:31,958
And as I suspected,
completely unaware.

356
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:33,166
Walk with me.

357
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,333
[MAUVE]
According to one source,

358
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:41,625
well, you're "the intermediary
for coup sympathizers."

359
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:42,750
That's what--

360
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,708
Another source boldly
asserts you belong

361
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:47,208
to the royal family.

362
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,583
My gut tells me
you're being used.

363
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,583
It's the only way to square
what I'm being told

364
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,875
with what I know.

365
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:59,458
While I'm not a woman who
overvalues her gut instinct,

366
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,500
when it comes to you,

367
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:05,083
I'm fairly certain it can't
be too wide of the mark.

368
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:08,166
So, am I right to conclude
you're just a patsy?

369
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:11,333
Yes, ma'am.

370
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:17,166
Thought so. Jean Otus is
clearly a man of integrity.

371
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,666
I could tell from the start.

372
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:22,958
I'm sorry, it was unfair
of me to write you off

373
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:24,166
the other night.

374
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,458
You really didn't deserve it.

375
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,375
I ought to have
known better.

376
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,375
What I asked you
to do was foolish.

377
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,291
You're too steeped in this mess.

378
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:33,458
Just so we're clear,

379
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:35,750
I really didn't have
anything to report.

380
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:38,958
Except that's not
entirely true, is it?

381
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,750
The uprising in Suitsu?

382
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,875
[MAUVE] You expressly withheld
important information

383
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,166
concerning Chief
Officer Grossular.

384
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:52,208
I know you've seen the
so-called "Mauve Avenue."

385
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:54,041
Which means you know
I hold Grossular

386
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:55,375
in high esteem.

387
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:56,583
So out of respect,

388
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,458
you attempted to shield
me from allegations

389
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,583
of his involvement.

390
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:02,208
Is that right?

391
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:05,916
When you put it like that,
it sounds so much worse.

392
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,416
But yes.

393
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,208
You dropping that in
my lap would've taken

394
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:11,875
more nerve than is advisable.

395
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:14,416
We needn't put my
feelings above the facts.

396
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,458
But I understand why you chose
not to report what you knew.

397
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:20,666
[JEAN] I wasn't just
trying to spare you.

398
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,916
There's more to it than that.

399
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,541
I don't think
Grossular's behind this.

400
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:28,041
I didn't want to spread
that rumor any further.

401
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:33,541
At the end of the day,
it just wasn't worth reporting.

402
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:43,708
[MAUVE]
You don't ask many questions.

403
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:46,125
About yourself, I mean.

404
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,958
Did you suspect
your true lineage?

405
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:50,000
I dunno.

406
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,833
Maybe I should look
into it, huh?

407
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:53,291
[MAUVE]
You're taking it well.

408
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:56,166
I wouldn't necessarily say that.

409
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,708
There is someone I can talk to.

410
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:00,333
[SCHWAN]
Leave the district?

411
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:01,791
Whatever for?

412
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:04,791
I thought Your Highness
wanted to broaden his horizons.

413
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:07,750
My horizons are
quite broad enough!

414
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,291
I've no desire to see
Bon for its own sake.

415
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,291
I merely wish to learn
about the girl.

416
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,958
[MAGIE] I didn't know you felt
so strongly for Miss Lotta.

417
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:17,375
Oh, would you shut up!

418
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:21,833
We need to ascertain whether
she'll stand in my way.

419
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:24,041
My aunt's tale brought
certain things to light

420
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:25,666
I daren't ignore.

421
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:29,208
I've become convinced
our Lotta is of royal blood.

422
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:34,041
[SCHWAN] Take the portrait of
the second princess at sixteen.

423
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:36,750
The resemblance Lotta
bears to it is so uncanny

424
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:40,875
one wonders if the
princess ever really died.

425
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,166
It's a mystery.

426
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:45,125
Of course, family or not,
she's still female.

427
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:48,000
The line of succession
remains unbroken.

428
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:51,416
[MAGIE] Your Highness realizes
she has an older brother?

429
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,500
You'll recall him as the
brute who stepped outside

430
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:56,416
to smoke during your ceremony.

431
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,333
[SCHWAN] Why have I
not heard this before?!

432
00:20:58,416 --> 00:20:59,791
I couldn't say.

433
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:00,958
No fear, Your Highness,

434
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,375
if it pleases you,
I shall return to Bon.

435
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:05,416
Anything else about Lotta
we might have missed--

436
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,041
[SCHWAN] I don't give
a damn about the girl!

437
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,625
Look into her boorish lout
of an older brother!

438
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,625
[MAGIE]
Alas, I cannot.

439
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:13,875
What?!

440
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,333
[MAGIE] I am forbidden
from leaving your side,

441
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:17,333
Your Highness.

442
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:18,958
I've been ordered to stay.

443
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:20,791
Much like the princess's
guard who vanished

444
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:25,541
all those years ago, swallowed
by the unforgiving sea.

445
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,083
Yes, the guard.

446
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:28,791
And what was his name?

447
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:29,833
[MAGIE]
Abend.

448
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:34,625
One could scarcely find a
guard ignorant of that name.

449
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,666
He was said to have
beautiful white hair,

450
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,541
pure as the driven snow,

451
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,125
which caught the eye
of His Majesty's

452
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:42,416
equally beautiful
second daughter.

453
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,958
The man's loyalty
is spoken of still.

454
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:49,541
[NINO]
Jean knows the truth.

455
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:51,125
Mauve told him.

456
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:55,875
I didn't catch all the details
of their conversation, no.

457
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:57,791
But I know how he thinks.

458
00:21:57,875 --> 00:22:00,000
He's bound to ask me.

459
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,458
Speaking of which,
here he is now.

460
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:05,041
Why don't I tell him everything?

461
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:07,375
Well, you could do it yourself,

462
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:11,000
except there's no time
to run it past Qualm first.

463
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:12,791
I've gotta go.

464
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:14,375
Right. Understood.

465
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:17,916
[JEAN]
Sorry.

466
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,875
Don't mean to interrupt you.

467
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:21,041
It's fine.

468
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:23,041
You get Lotta her present yet?

469
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:24,250
[JEAN]
No.

470
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:27,083
I was hoping to
pick your brain first.

471
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:28,833
Sure.

472
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:32,041
This uh... might take
a little while.

473
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:35,041
I've got time.

474

"The Princess Who
Spread Her Wings

[NINO] I hope you appreciate
how special tonight is.
