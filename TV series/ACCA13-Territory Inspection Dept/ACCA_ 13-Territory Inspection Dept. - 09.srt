1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,208
[MOND]
Magie, A moment.

2
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:19,541
[MOND] It's come to my attention
that His Highness Prince Schwan

3
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:21,083
has been seeking out
and speaking

4
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:22,666
with the first princess.

5
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,416
[MAGIE]
Yes, but only twice.

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,458
This would be the first
time he's taken an interest

7
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:28,208
in his aunt since childhood.

8
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:29,333
Very strange.

9
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:34,000
[MOND] What is he putting
in that woman's head?

10
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:36,000
Her personal guard
seems on edge,

11
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:38,125
given to highly
suspicious behavior.

12
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:40,750
I can't help but think
the prince is involved.

13
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:43,666
[MAGIE] I'm hard-pressed
to disagree with you, sir.

14
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,625
In any event,
I must make a full report

15
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:47,375
to Privy Council
President Qualm.

16
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:48,708
[SCHWAN]
Wait.

17
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:51,583
I assure you this is a
terrible misunderstanding.

18
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:54,750
Allow me to smooth things
over with my darling aunt.

19
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:57,250
Magie will report
to you how it plays out.

20
00:00:57,333 --> 00:01:00,666
Better to give Qualm all
the relevant details, yes?

21
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:04,875
[SCHWAN'S AUNT] If there's any
truth in what the boy says,

22
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:06,875
the Otus siblings
are poised to become

23
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:09,750
a most unfortunate
obstacle to our goal.

24
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:11,833
My sweet, regal daughter.

25
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:14,583
Here I thought only
Schwan blocked our way.

26
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:17,833
This new threat must
be dealt with at once.

27
00:01:17,916 --> 00:01:20,666
Go, make haste for Bon.

28
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,000
[MAGIE] Perhaps it has not
occurred to you, Your Highness,

29
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,750
that she will send assassins?

30
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:27,458
[SCHWAN] I did speculate
rather freely with her.

31
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:31,208
Being the dreadful person she
is, I wouldn't dare discount it.

32
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,791
Oh, dear.

33
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:37,166
When the snow abates,
I'll visit her again.

34
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:40,083
Though by then I might
be entirely too late.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,958
My aunt does as she pleases.

36
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:45,791
If it happens, it happens.

37
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:08,958
Yes, it's me.

38
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:12,041
I have some very urgent
news concerning Miss Lotta.

39
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:48,708
[JEAN]
Hey, chief.

40
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:51,125
Thanks for taking Lotta
out while I was gone.

41
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,458
That was really nice.

42
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:54,500
[OWL] No, no, she was
the one who offered

43
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,583
to keep me company, actually.

44
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:59,666
I hate to bother you,
but mind if I ask a favor?

45
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,541
[OWL]
I suppose so.

46
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:05,000
[JEAN] It's just I have three
audits coming up, back to back.

47
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:06,958
I was thinking you could
drop in on her again

48
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,291
while I'm away?

49
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:09,833
Take her to tea maybe?

50
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,416
I'd be delighted to, Jean,

51
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,291
but are you sure
I'm the right person?

52
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,250
Trust me, sir, every
time she's gone out with you

53
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,541
she's had a ball, really.

54
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,000
If you want, you can ask
Knot and the others

55
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,458
to come along.

56
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,875
How can I say no?

57
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:26,625
Odds are they'll know the best
places to take her, anyway.

58
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:29,583
Appreciate it, sir.

59
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:33,041
This next round's
the longest one yet, huh?

60
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,375
[JEAN]
Yeah.

61
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:35,916
Heading all the way
out to Peshi District first

62
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,750
and then I fly into Yakkara.

63
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:41,166
And I finish up with Pranetta
on the way back home.

64
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,125
Well. Sounds a bit treacherous.

65
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:45,625
I'll be fine.

66
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:57,875
[ASSASSIN 9A] There's no denying
she stands out in a crowd.

67
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:00,666
Definitely royal blood
in those veins.

68
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,541
[ASSASSIN 9B] The brother's on
a business trip at the moment.

69
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,375
We'll have to take
care of him later.

70
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:12,125
[LOTTA gasps]

71
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,208
Look, whatever you want--

72
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:21,833
Shh.

73
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:23,791
Hey, wait,
you're that ACCA guy!

74
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,583
Your life's in danger, Miss.

75
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,958
Excuse me?

76
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:31,625
Just take my word for it, okay?

77
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:33,375
Don't panic, but
you're being followed.

78
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,125
There are some really
nasty people on your tail.

79
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,833
This friend of mine from
out-of-town warned me.

80
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:44,125
I owe him a ton of sandwich
bread for the heads-up.

81
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,333
Let's grab the
subway to ACCA HQ.

82
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:47,666
You'll be safe there.

83
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,041
Sorry, I don't really know
enough to fill in the details.

84
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:55,500
But whatever they're
cookin' up can't be done

85
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,791
out in the open.

86
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,458
It's gonna be fine.
I'm here to protect you.

87
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,291
How kind of you.

88
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,750
That's them.

89
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:12,250
We'll take the next stop
and blend in with the crowd.

90
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:22,208
[RAIL] This is Central
Marketplace Station.

91
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:24,250
I'd say we hop a bus
to the branch office,

92
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,375
but chances are they'll
have thought of that.

93
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,541
[LOTTA] Couldn't we
just head to my place

94
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:31,875
and get our bearings from there?

95
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,250
We could, sure.

96
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:36,125
Your building has a
top-of-the-line security system.

97
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:39,000
Trouble is, they already
know where you live.

98
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:40,291
[LOTTA gasps]

99
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:43,791
Oh, hey.

100
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:47,625
Shouldn't you be
in school right now?

101
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,375
[LOTTA gasps]

102
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:52,750
These are just like the
ones Jean brought home

103
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,583
from DMwfor me!

104
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,583
[CAFÉ OWNER 9A] Wouldn't be
much of a DMwstyle bakery

105
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:57,666
without 'em!

106
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,375
Have a seat. I'll make some tea.

107
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:03,708
[LOTTA] You said your friend
was from out-of-town?

108
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,375
Where's he live?

109
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:06,666
DMwDistrict.

110
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,250
How wild!

111
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,666
I've got a friend there who's
crazy about sandwich bread, too!

112
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,500
He said he was impressed with
how soft they make it here.

113
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,791
My mom was also like that.

114
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,000
Big connoisseur.

115
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:23,333
Apparently she was born
in another district.

116
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:26,833
Wow, wouldn't that be something
if she were from DMw too?

117
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:28,791
[CAFÉ OWNER 9A]
Yeah, well, you know,

118
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,416
they say lots of folks from
DMw Koro^ and Suitsu

119
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,208
have blue or blond hair.

120
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:36,833
Yeah my friend's hair
is blue, as a matter of fact.

121
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,041
I bet it looks real neat.

122
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,958
Hey, so this buddy
of yours out in DMw

123
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:47,333
I just realized my place is
around the corner from here.

124
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:48,875
Can we stop by real quick?

125
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,375
There's a back entrance.

126
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:54,083
I need to change clothes.
This uniform makes me stick out.

not to play hooky again.

Sure. No prob.

go into more detail.

But because of your
kindness in Bon,

that much at least.

between you two?

There isn't one to speak of.

enough to meet again,

Yep.

Supposed to be lots of fun.

Yeah, ain't she a beaut?

So, there's two ways
to the branch office.

326

life on it, friend.

334
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:49,458
What else can a man do?

335
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:52,083
That's what this country's all
about, when you get down to it.

336
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,750
Embracing diversity.

337
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,166
Today's the day, I take it?

338
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:03,375
You finally see fit to grace
your colleagues with the truth?

339
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:15,333
We're on the edge of our seats.

340
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:16,666
Indulge us, won't you?

341
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,708
Fine.

342
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:23,458
Allow me to enlighten you all
on the subject of Jean Otus.

343
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,875
To begin, as I'm sure you've
all been made aware

344
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:28,333
through various channels,
rumors abound

345
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:31,416
that he's the rightful
heir to the throne.

346
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,583
I myself first caught wind
of this shortly after

347
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:35,250
our initial decision
to terminate

348
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,916
the Inspection Department.

349
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,791
Investigating said rumor,
I discovered it to be true.

350
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,291
Now as you know, gentlemen,

351
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:46,041
each district has,
over the last several years,

352
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:48,916
been suspected of nursing
pro-coup sympathies.

353
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:53,708
In my humble opinion,
the times dictate

354
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:56,791
that ACCA give them
what they want.

355
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,500
Before a coup could
proceed, however,

356
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:01,458
it was necessary to clear
the way of any obstacles,

357
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:04,625
thus my call for Inspection
to be terminated.

358
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,625
You can imagine my
surprise upon learning

359
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:10,625
one of its deputy chiefs
was of royal blood.

360
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:12,916
Thinking he was better
used than discarded,

361
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,666
I agreed to let the Inspection
Department survive.

362
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,458
[PINE] Hold up, so your
assertion that Otus was acting

363
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:21,166
as an intermediary between
radical elements was--?

364
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,416
[GROSSULAR]
Yes.

365
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,500
A politically strategic
fabrication on my part,

366
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,958
one that fed on
speculation of his lineage.

367
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,500
People would believe
he was canvassing

368
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:31,083
for a path to the throne.

369
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:32,375
So...

370
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:34,791
Once Otus was
established as a radical,

371
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,958
I assigned Crow from Internal
Affairs to watch him,

372
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:40,208
and to gauge how
each district's leadership

373
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,500
would react to the rumor.

374
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,708
I urge you to think
carefully on this.

375
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,500
His Highness, Prince Schwan,

376
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,916
soon to inherit his
grandfather's crown,

377
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,791
will bring ruin.

378
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:53,375
He plans to abolish
ACCA entirely.

379
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:57,083
The only way to stop him
is to trigger a coup.

380
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,166
Otus is a good man.

381
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,541
He desires the preservation
of peace in our nation.

382
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,541
If allowed to become
the next king,

383
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:07,000
that peace will
likely be assured.

384
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:10,583
Of course, no longer being
on the DMwFamily register,

385
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:14,041
his ascension cannot be
accomplished by ordinary means.

386
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,875
Hence my linking him to
the pro-coup movement.

387
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:20,375
Both he and the coup
sympathizers needed a catalyst.

388
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:23,625
ACCA's future is at stake.

389
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,291
What say you all?

390
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,458
The people are not
in harm's way.

391
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,083
We will protect them
according to duty

392
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,125
by leading the charge ourselves.

393
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,083
[LILIUM]
Chief Officer Grossular.

394
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,541
Why choose subterfuge when
you might've laid this out

395
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:39,791
to us from the very beginning?

396
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:42,208
It seemed prudent to
assess how the districts felt

397
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:45,416
about it before vying
for all of your support.

398
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,500
To succeed, this first must
have the character of a mandate.

399
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:50,458
The citizens have to agree.

Thankfully, it appears
they are of one voice.

You wanted the truth;
there it is.

402

I assume you find my
argument wanting?

403
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:01,791
Not at all.

404
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:04,125
On the contrary,
I find myself in agreement

405
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,583
with your point of view.

My, will wonders never cease!

409
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:17,208
[LILIUM] Certain facets of
the plan need refinement.

410
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:19,375
But this country's
security depends on ACCA's

411
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:21,041
continued existence.

412
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,166
If a coup is the surest
path to safeguarding

413
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,583
the public interest, so be it.

414
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:27,583
Is there anyone
here who disagrees?

415
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:30,916
If I heard correctly that ACCA
will take the vanguard, no.

416
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,333
Long as we protect the citizens.

417
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:36,083
Besides, if you two
can agree on something,

and try to shake things up?

We have to preserve this

You cut the deck
nicely, Grossular.

I hope you know how
to call the game.

If there's an ace
up your sleeve,

now would be the
time to let us know.

A first-rate performance.

according to plan. Simple.

we are to be of the
same mind from now on.
