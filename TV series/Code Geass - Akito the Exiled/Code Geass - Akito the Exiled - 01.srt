In a blitzkrieg attack by

00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:03,208
the nation of
Japan was conquered

in the span of a single month.

And so,

these islands in the far

all enemy engagements that
go on longer than an hour

believe in ghosts!

161
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,458
[HILDA] Zero enemy
Knightmares detected!

162
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:54,875
Combat zone clear!

163
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:58,166
[CHLOE] 132nd Regiment
has begun evacuation.

164
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,208
What's Wyvern unit's
Remaining troop strength?

165
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:02,625
Already verifying.

166
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:03,791
One frame!

167
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:07,500
It's... receiving
pilot biometrics now.

168
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,375
[OLIVIA]
Second Lieutenant Hyuga.

169
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:12,666
It's Akito Hyuga!

170
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,666
All remaining forces
are to rendezvous with G1.

171
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,375
Withdraw! Activate main engine!

172
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:19,500
[MALE TECH 1A]
Number two, speed!

173
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:22,541
To think, the Holy
Order of Raphael

174
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:28,750
facing EU militia soldiers
still failed to hold our own.

175
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:31,000
Sir Farnese.

176
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:32,541
[FARNESE]
All that remains.

177
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:36,375
Is to give proper burials to
our brothers who fell in battle.

178
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,833
[MALE SOLDIER 1A] Looks
like we're finally going home!

179
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,583
[MALE SOLDIER 1B]
Sure took those reinforcements

180
00:13:58,666 --> 00:13:59,750
long enough to get here!

181
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,333
[MALE SOLDIER 1A]
I didn't mind, honestly.

182
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:03,125
It was almost like camping!

183
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:04,916
[MALE SOLDIER 1B] Ha!
That's one way to look at it.

184
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,750
[MALE SOLDIER 1A] This war
is turning into a vacation!

185
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,125
What are you doing way out here?

186
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:25,208
You all by yourself?

187
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:28,500
I am. Can you give us a lift?

188
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:30,458
Huh?

189
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:31,750
That a Knightmare?

190
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:34,166
Never seen that model.

191
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,625
Just to be safe,
show me your ID.

192
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:41,083
You're a long way from
home, that's for sure.

193
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:45,375
Tch! You're a damn Eleven?

194
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,625
[MALE SOLDIER 1A]
I'll give you a lift,

195
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:51,916
but only if you ride in the
back with the Knightmare.

196
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,833
[LEILA]
One survivor.

197
00:14:57,916 --> 00:14:59,375
My plan succeeded.

198
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,625
But only because so many
young Japanese men

199
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,333
sacrificed their lives.

200
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:09,583
[LEILA] My father told me
that it was the duty

201
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:13,041
of a citizen to
protect his homeland.

202
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:16,416
But... to these
disenfranchised few.

203
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:20,791
[LEILA] To these people
who have lost their homeland.

204
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:23,708
Do I come across as a
detached chess master

205
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:25,583
hiding safely in her castle?

206
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:33,291
[SMILAS] "Major Leila Malcal
is now a Lieutenant Colonel.

207
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,333
Officially installed
as the commander

208
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:38,291
of Assault Unit wZERO."

209
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:42,000
The 40 Chair Defense Committee
approved it yesterday.

210
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,583
All Thanks to your
Narva evacuation, I assume.

211
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,458
Congratulations, Leila.

212
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:51,291
[LEILA]
Thank you, General. I accept.

213
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:57,625
[SMILAS] I expect
great things from you.

214
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:01,875
The wZERO unit was
based on your proposal.

215
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:05,333
So it's only fitting that
you should be it's commander.

216
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:07,958
What is wrong?

217
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,083
You don't seem
too happy about it.

218
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,208
[gasps]

219
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:12,791
General Smilas,

220
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:16,541
my Attack Plan 145A is to launch
sneak attacks on enemy positions

221
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:19,500
utilizing multiple squads
of Knightmare forces.

222
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,958
So, it will require
the commitment

223
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,291
of a much larger
number of troops.

224
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:27,625
If it continues with small
forces like this time,

225
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:30,458
then our losses will
become unsustainable.

226
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:34,250
Please, let me expand the
unit with Europian Troops.

227
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:36,000
I understand your point,

228
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:40,166
but sending regular forces
isn't quite so simple, Leila.

229
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,000
Public opinion grows rancid

230
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:45,333
when Republic soldiers
die in this war,

231
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:47,333
and the Joint Chiefs
of Staff determined that

232
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:52,541
the survival rate of soldiers
in Attack Plan 145A will be low.

233
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,125
Are you telling me

234
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:56,791
you're fine with people dying
as long as they're Elevens, sir?

235
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:02,750
[SMILAS]
Leila.

236
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,416
You know that
it's a fool's errand

237
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,750
to try to find any kind of
logic in wartime politics.

238
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:08,958
[LEILA]
But, sir!

239
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,583
[SMILAS] It takes more
than sound arguments

240
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:12,166
to win people over.

241
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,750
In the Narva operation
the other day,

242
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:19,291
the number of Japanese soldiers
who managed to come home alive

243
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:22,250
was exactly one.

244
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,958
But you saved the lives of
nearly 15,000 Europian soldiers.

245
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:27,291
[LEILA]
I didn't--

246
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,333
[SMILAS] Meanwhile,
you haven't shown any regret

247
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:32,166
over the incident
with Lt. Col. Anou.

248
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:37,833
[LEILA] I regret not removing
him before the operation began.

249
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,791
I understand.

250
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:42,041
Anou was just
recently reassigned

251
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,125
to the Warsaw supply force.

252
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:48,250
Seems we're not the only ones
who are aware of his aptitudes.

253
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,541
The Committee will
meet again tomorrow.

254
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,208
There's another meeting?

255
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:54,500
Those cowardly politicians
and bureaucrats

256
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,750
find comfort in meetings.

257
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:59,666
It might do you some
good to sit in on one.

258
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,250
[LEILA]
Yes, sir.

259
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:03,416
[SMILAS]
Which reminds me,

260
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,541
you remember
tonight's engagement?

261
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:06,875
I'm attending the party

262
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:09,416
celebrating the
successful Narva retreat.

263
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:16,083
Sorry I kept you,
Lieutenant Hyuga.

264
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:17,833
[AKITO]
It's all right.

265
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:19,916
I'm on escort duty.

266
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,416
That's what I'm here for.

267
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,666
[LEILA]
Oh, fine. So it is.

268
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,666
Is this your first
time in Paris?

269
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,708
[AKITO] No, but
it's been a while.

270
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,958
[PARTY MAN 1A] That painting
fetched a rather tidy sum.

271
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:50,500
[PARTY MAN 1B] Art's a safer
bet than gold these days.

272
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:54,000
[PARTY MAN 1A] Nonsense. Nothing
beats national bonds in wartime.

273
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,416
[PARTY MAN 1B]
True.

274
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,708
But Britannia doesn't seem
to want to expand the war.

275
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:59,500
[PARTY MAN 1A] It's best
when both sides simply glare

276
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,333
at each other like they are now.

277
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:02,500
[PARTY MAN 1B]
A war without fighting

278
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:05,458
is more profitable
than peace, I suppose.

279
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:07,791
[PARTY MAN 1B] Perhaps
I should have invested more.

280
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,458
[PARTY MAN 1A]
You bankers are terrible.

281
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:10,166
[PARTY MAN 1B]
That's true!

282
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:14,166
[laughter]

283
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,583
[PARTY WOMAN 1A]
Look at her.

284
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:18,208
A military uniform? Here?

285
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:19,916
[PARTY WOMAN 1B]
Ah, that Malcal girl.

286
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,833
[PARTY MAN 1D] The young lady
we've heard so much about?

287
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:30,791
[AKITO]
You know,

288
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,083
there's something about a woman

289
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:35,291
at a party reading
Guibert's tactical writings,

290
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:38,083
that says, "keep your distance."

291
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:44,000
Why, Lieutenant Hyuga,
you do have a sense of humor.

292
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:47,958
This is my first time inside
the Palais des Tuileries.

293
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:49,083
Pretty much what I'd expect

294
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:52,375
from a Bien Nation
Conglomerate party.

295
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:57,208
So this is to celebrate
the success in Narva?

296
00:19:57,291 --> 00:20:00,250
I don't know what
they're celebrating.

297
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:05,583
[LEILA] Look around. We're
the only two soldiers here.

298
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,625
[DANIEL]
Leila!

299
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:15,000
[DANIEL] Is that the one
and only Miss Leila Malcal?

300
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,541
Ah, excuse me.

301
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,333
Begging your pardon, everyone.

302
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:22,875
Now why didn't you call ahead
to say that you would be coming.

303
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:26,333
Leila, It's been a whole
year since we last saw you.

304
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:27,666
[LEILA]
I know.

305
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,958
It's been too long, Daniel.
And you too, Stefan.

306
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:33,583
Leila, why on earth
did you decide

307
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:36,250
to wear that to a
perfectly good party?

308
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:39,333
I would have hoped you'd
put aside such boorish attire.

309
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:41,708
My uniform is
considered formal attire.

310
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:45,000
I see that your tone is the
same as it always was, Leila.

311
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,708
[IOAN]
As I live and breathe!

312
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,750
Well, if it
isn't our little sister.

313
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,166
Brother... Ioan, hello.

314
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:03,708
Ah. Now I get it. So this
is the lieutenant Eleven?

315
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:06,750
Lieutenant Hyuga--
my bodyguard.

316
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:07,750
Nice to meet you.

317
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,708
I'm one of
Leila's big brothers.

318
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:13,958
Ioan Malcal, third oldest
of the Malcal family.

319
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:17,208
The pleasure is
mine, Lieutenant.

320
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:21,708
Oh, right and before
it causes confusion,

321
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:25,625
my lovely sister just
happens to be my fiancée.

322
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:26,875
[gasps]

323
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:35,541
The Malcal family, get this, was
gracious enough to adopt her.

324
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:38,291
Leila is the apple of our
father's eye,

325
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:39,916
which I'm sure is the reason

326
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,750
he decided that we
should be married.

327
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,291
Ioan!

328
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,750
The thing is...

329
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:52,625
...I have no interest in
marrying the likes of you.

330
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:53,750
[DANIEL]
Please, you're drunk, Ioan.

331
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:54,958
[STEFAN]
Behave yourself!

332
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:56,166
[IOAN]
Wait!

333
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,750
What do you say I make
you my mistress, eh?

334
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:00,916
My girl on the side!

335
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,708
That would suit
you perfectly, Leila!

336
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,416
Oh. So sorry.

337
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,708
You little... son of a...

338
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:26,541
You know how Elevens are all
masters of bladed weapons?

339
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:27,916
If you'd like,

340
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,916
I'd be more than
happy to demonstrate

341
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,291
on that face of yours.

342
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:34,958
Let me go! Get off of me!

343
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:39,041
[AKITO]
Here.

344
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:41,750
Sorry about that little spill.

345
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:46,791
[AKITO]
Shall we go, Commander?

346
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:48,375
[LEILA]
Lieutenant Hyuga?

347
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:50,541
Hey! Wait a minute!

348
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,833
[LEILA] I didn't know you
were an expert swordsman.

349
00:22:56,916 --> 00:22:58,333
[AKITO]
What do you mean?

350
00:22:58,416 --> 00:23:00,916
[LEILA] You said you were
a master of bladed weapons.

351
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,333
[AKITO]
Ah, that.

352
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:06,916
[AKITO] You Europians are
all the same, aren't you?

353
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,208
You all think we're
masters of karate or swordplay.

354
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:13,958
You either fear our culture.
Or mock it.

355
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:15,333
I am not like that!

356
00:23:15,416 --> 00:23:17,000
Hmm?

357
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:18,541
Speaking of,

358
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:21,208
I heard somewhere that you're
ranked in aikido, Commander.

359
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:23,916
And where exactly
did you hear that?

360
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,125
Captain Clement
mentioned it to me.

361
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,666
[sighs]

362
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:30,166
That Anna can't keep her
mouth shut, can she?

363
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:33,833
So is it true that you and
the Captain met as classmates?

364
00:23:33,916 --> 00:23:37,541
When we were young,
after the Malcals adopted me.

365
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:41,666
[LEILA]
See, apparently,

366
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:45,000
my birth parents were
Britannian aristocrats.

367
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:48,541
[AKITO] Britannian?
They defected to Europia?

368
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:53,041
[LEILA] Yes.
In fact, I was born here.

369
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:55,458
But my parents
died 12 years ago,

370
00:23:55,541 --> 00:23:59,125
leaving me to fend for myself.

371
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:01,625
The Malcals,
a huge conglomerate,

372
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:03,041
took me in as an orphan

373
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:07,291
because they wanted
a claim to noble lineage.

374
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:09,291
Their intent was
to eventually marry me

375
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:11,958
off to their youngest son Iaon.

376
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:16,708
That's why he's your
brother and fiancé. Hmph!

377
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:18,958
Your world is funny.

378
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:22,541
Always Jockeying for the
best bloodline and fortune.

379
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:23,916
[LEILA]
Lieutenant Hyuga!

380
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,416
[AKITO] You know, if you
don't like it, Commander...

381
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:31,000
[AKITO] ...I'd be happy
to get rid of it for you.

382
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:36,750
This world, I mean. Heh.

383
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,125
[ORANGE JACKET MAN]
Eighty-five of my crew are dead.

384
00:25:03,208 --> 00:25:07,166
And there are another 37 who
are laid up in the hospital ICU.

385
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:10,458
[ORANGE JACKET MAN]
Not to mention,

386
00:25:10,541 --> 00:25:14,083
20 of your own friends have
entered the great beyond.

387
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:18,833
It was 18.
Get your facts straight.

388
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:21,666
[ORANGE JACKET MAN]
This is the first time

389
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:25,000
a war of this size and scale has
been fought in the Underground.

390
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:26,708
But you know that.

391
00:25:29,208 --> 00:25:31,208
So listen up kid,

392
00:25:31,291 --> 00:25:34,208
you and I have both paid
a steep price, right?

393
00:25:34,291 --> 00:25:37,625
Let's end this.
With that in mind,

394
00:25:37,708 --> 00:25:41,541
I've prepared a little gift
for you and your friends.

395
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:43,708
Ryo!

396
00:25:43,791 --> 00:25:46,333
The pilot ID's been rewritten.
You're all set.

397
00:25:46,416 --> 00:25:47,666
Thanks, Yukiya.

398
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,500
[ORANGE JACKET MAN]
Seems there was a deposit

399
00:25:49,583 --> 00:25:50,875
in my bank account?

400
00:25:50,958 --> 00:25:52,291
Oh yeah?

401
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:54,750
Well, I guess since
we've paid for it.

402
00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:58,416
We'll stop calling it a gift,
like you did us some big favor.

403
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,000
Oh, get over yourself Ryo!

404
00:26:00,083 --> 00:26:01,208
We both know you're paying

405
00:26:01,291 --> 00:26:03,291
with money you skimmed
from the net banks.

406
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:05,458
You're just a bunch
of two-bit thieves.

407
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:09,791
Yeah? Why don't
you do it too, then?

408
00:26:09,875 --> 00:26:12,333
Assuming you can, that is.

409
00:26:12,416 --> 00:26:14,625
Watch your mouth,
you filthy Eleven rat!

410
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:26,958
Boys, boys. Let's
just take it easy, all right?

411
00:26:27,041 --> 00:26:28,500
Come on, old friend.

412
00:26:28,583 --> 00:26:30,166
Thought you knew
better than that.

413
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,750
Show a little respect
for your elders alright?

414
00:26:32,833 --> 00:26:35,000
You and this crew
of yours need to chill.

415
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:37,833
Hmph! Bold words
coming from a thug.

416
00:26:37,916 --> 00:26:38,875
Right, Yukiya?

417
00:26:38,958 --> 00:26:40,375
Give him a break, Ryo.

418
00:26:40,458 --> 00:26:44,083
These old farts don't have too
many lectures left in 'em.

419
00:26:44,791 --> 00:26:47,791
Ryo, we need this deal
to pan out for the plan.

420
00:26:47,875 --> 00:26:50,125
Relax, Ayano.

421
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:53,458
Fifteen. Fourteen. Thirteen.

422
00:26:53,541 --> 00:26:55,125
How 'bout this, Ryo?

423
00:26:55,208 --> 00:26:57,500
Why don't you join
our organization?

424
00:26:57,583 --> 00:27:01,000
We could really use someone
with your particular talents.

425
00:27:01,083 --> 00:27:02,583
That'd make things easy.

426
00:27:02,666 --> 00:27:05,750
But there's one small problem,
you make me sick.

427
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:06,916
What was that?

428
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,250
Four. Three. Now, Ryo!

429
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:41,291
Wow. Body parts everywhere.

430
00:27:41,375 --> 00:27:42,875
Man, what a mess.

431
00:27:42,958 --> 00:27:44,583
Gonna be a bitch to clean up.

432
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:47,250
[RYO]
Good work.

433
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:49,041
But it won't
always be this easy.

434
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,458
[YUKIYA]
Yeah, I know.

435
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:59,166
People are so
fragile in the end.

436
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:02,083
[ORANGE JACKET MAN] Somebody,
please, I need a doctor.

437
00:28:02,166 --> 00:28:05,083
It's over. Just help me.

438
00:28:05,916 --> 00:28:09,125
[RYO] Well, I'll be.
You're still alive, huh?

439
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,250
You've gotta help me.

440
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:14,041
[RYO] Sure,
I'd be happy to help you...

441
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:16,041
...for a small fee.

442
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:17,750
[gasps]

443
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:19,625
I mean, your life
isn't worth much.

444
00:28:19,708 --> 00:28:22,291
Give me a ballpark estimate.

445
00:28:22,375 --> 00:28:28,000
Hahahaha!

446
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:30,625
[ORANGE JACKET MAN] Wait, are
you kids with those terrorists?

447
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:32,083
[RYO]
Huh?

448
00:28:32,166 --> 00:28:33,625
[ORANGE JACKET MAN] Those
Elevens I've heard about...

449
00:28:33,708 --> 00:28:34,541
The Black Knights?

450
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:36,166
[RYO]
Nope.

451
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:38,291
We're a little different.

452
00:28:39,958 --> 00:28:42,125
But you don't need
to worry about it.

453
00:28:44,875 --> 00:28:47,958
[RYO] Yukiya, Ayano.
Next time's for real.

454
00:28:48,041 --> 00:28:49,500
[YUKIYA]
About time.

455
00:28:50,208 --> 00:28:54,291
[YUKIYA chuckles]
Things are about to get fun!

456
00:29:02,125 --> 00:29:05,041
[SMILAS] Ever since the
revolution 300 years ago,

457
00:29:05,125 --> 00:29:08,583
Europia has maintained
its republic system...

458
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:10,666
[SMILAS]
...but,

459
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,000
what the revolution might
have actually given rise to

460
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:15,416
is this devastating
money-worship.

461
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:19,083
The end result of a
lifetime of self-interest.

462
00:29:19,166 --> 00:29:20,166
That's true
even for those

463
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:23,125
who claim to be
this country's leaders.

464
00:29:23,208 --> 00:29:24,541
If this keeps up,

465
00:29:24,625 --> 00:29:28,125
we'll be conquered by
Brittania before you know it.

466
00:29:31,791 --> 00:29:33,250
[SMILAS] They may
be distant descendants

467
00:29:33,333 --> 00:29:35,958
of the royals and nobles who
were driven from this continent

468
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:37,375
and into the new world,

469
00:29:37,458 --> 00:29:40,000
but they still feel
entitled to all of this.

470
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:42,166
And that's why
I can't help but think:

471
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,416
If only General
Napoleon Bonaparte,

472
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,750
hero of the revolution,
had become emperor of Europe,

473
00:29:47,833 --> 00:29:51,708
rather than dying at
the guillotine like he did.

474
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:53,958
He tried to make
himself a dictator.

475
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:57,458
The dictatorship of one talented
man is far more beneficial

476
00:29:57,541 --> 00:30:00,166
than the democracy of
the ignorant masses.

477
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:03,833
That is what your late
father wished for, as well.

478
00:30:03,916 --> 00:30:05,166
It's why he was murdered.

479
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,833
[gasps]

480
00:30:06,916 --> 00:30:09,750
I was really young when
my father was assassinated.

481
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:11,250
So I don't really--

482
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:15,250
Oh. No. Sorry, you don't have
to speak to his politics.

483
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:19,041
I admired your father, but I
admire your compassion as well.

484
00:30:32,125 --> 00:30:33,666

[SMILAS] Keeping the Elevens who
live in Europia locked away

486
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:43,708
in internment camps out of
fear of Britannia is cowardice.

487
00:30:43,791 --> 00:30:47,083
Yet another shame
of republicanism.

488
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,791
[SMILAS] But I can't pity the
ones who didn't resist.

489

[MALE GUARD 1A]
You like any of those

490
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,750
scroungy Eleven ladies
out there, eh?

491
00:31:00,833 --> 00:31:03,375
I wonder if the one
in the back knows them?

492
00:31:03,458 --> 00:31:09,250

Right on time.

00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:58,125
[YUKIYA] That's about the
level of security I expected.

00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:02,250
All right. Let's get
this game started!

[YUKIYA]
5 minutes.

498

[YUKIYA] Is the
drive beacon coming in?

499
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:32,791
[RYO]
No doubt about it.

500
00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:35,541
This is the route the

[LEILA]
A Knightmare!

I'm sure.
Let's stay put for now.

No, Lieutenant Colonel!

00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:04,333
It's too dangerous out there!
Come back!

515
00:35:18,041 --> 00:35:20,666
Shall we...
test how sharp this is?

516
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:22,333

secured the target.

Good. We're out of here!

Okay!

[RYO]

00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:30,583
Take the geezer and
go meet up with Yukiya!

521
00:35:39,291 --> 00:35:41,666
[RYO]
Another one? Just my luck.

522
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:53,833
Let's wrap this up!

[RYO]
Who is this guy?

524
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:11,125
He's taking on a Knightmare.

525
00:36:11,208 --> 00:36:13,958
He's even crazier than we are.

526
00:36:14,041 --> 00:36:15,875
If you're that eager to die...

To the Pilot of the Glasgow,
your friend is my prisoner!

Resistance is useless.
Come out of there at once!

[LEILA] You two don't seem to
be that different in age to me.

Commander Malcal,

546
00:37:42,541 --> 00:37:45,291
letting them live
would only put us at risk.

00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:47,833
Heh. You're smarter
than you look.

548
00:37:47,916 --> 00:37:50,125
[AYANO snickers]
He's right, y'know.

00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:52,500

Let them go!

550
00:37:52,583 --> 00:37:55,125
Now! Don't try
to stall for time!

551
00:37:55,208 --> 00:37:57,916
Or I'll blow us all sky-high.

552
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,041
What do you say?

553
00:38:01,375 --> 00:38:04,083
Either way,
your friends are dead.

554
00:38:04,166 --> 00:38:08,708
Do I look like I would back
down over a threat like that?

555
00:38:08,791 --> 00:38:10,583
Pretty much.

556
00:38:10,666 --> 00:38:11,916
Just do it, Yukiya!

557
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,791
We're all going to be
killed if they capture us,

558
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:15,625
so what's the difference?!

559
00:38:15,708 --> 00:38:18,083
Just tell me why you did it.

560
00:38:21,958 --> 00:38:24,333
All of this was to
kidnap General Smilas

561
00:38:24,416 --> 00:38:26,958
so I assume you wanted
to trade him for something?

562
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:28,416
At the very least I
figured he was worth

563
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,375
a few top-of-the-line
Knightmares.

564
00:38:30,458 --> 00:38:32,291
You want Knightmares?

565
00:38:32,375 --> 00:38:33,625
How long do you
think you can hide

566
00:38:33,708 --> 00:38:35,458
after taking
something like that?

567
00:38:35,541 --> 00:38:38,541
We'll keep running
for as long as it takes,

568
00:38:38,625 --> 00:38:41,500
blending in with
the other Elevens.

569
00:38:41,583 --> 00:38:45,291
Idiot, the army will stop
at nothing to kill you,

570
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:47,708
even if that
means an air strike.

571
00:38:51,208 --> 00:38:52,791
[LEILA] There
had to be more to it.

572
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:54,541
What did you and
your friends really want?

573
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:57,000
This wasn't just
about Knightmares.

574
00:38:58,208 --> 00:39:00,083
[RYO]
A place to belong.

575
00:39:00,166 --> 00:39:01,583
To belong?

576
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:07,458
Man, I wish I was as
dumb as you people are.

577
00:39:07,541 --> 00:39:09,125
You made a mess
of the whole world,

578
00:39:09,208 --> 00:39:12,375
and now you're all perfectly
content to just lie in it.

579
00:39:12,458 --> 00:39:15,416
But us, we don't belong here.

580
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:18,791
There's no place in this
world for Elevens anymore.

581
00:39:19,791 --> 00:39:22,750
If that's what you want,
then what's your plan?

582
00:39:22,833 --> 00:39:24,833
Found your own country?

583
00:39:24,916 --> 00:39:26,083
Look, I don't have any interest

584
00:39:26,166 --> 00:39:29,291
in becoming the
representative for all Elevens.

585
00:39:29,375 --> 00:39:31,333
All that we want...

586
00:39:31,416 --> 00:39:33,208
...is a place for ourselves.

587
00:39:35,958 --> 00:39:38,916
Somewhere to call home.

588
00:39:40,916 --> 00:39:43,500
If you want a place to belong,
I can give you one.

589
00:39:43,583 --> 00:39:44,916
Huh?

590
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,041
I'll allow you to join my team.

591
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:50,416
It's as close to
a home as you'll find.

592
00:39:51,541 --> 00:39:53,916
Yeah, I think I get it.

593
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,041
If we say no...

594
00:39:56,125 --> 00:39:59,208
Heh.

595
00:40:07,583 --> 00:40:09,416
...then we go boom.

596
00:40:10,416 --> 00:40:12,375
That's it, right?

597
00:40:12,458 --> 00:40:15,833
We don't have a choice, do we?

598
00:40:24,375 --> 00:40:25,833
[MICHELE] Duke Velaine
has issued an command

599
00:40:25,916 --> 00:40:29,875
that the Order of Michael is
to relocate to St. Petersburg.

600
00:40:31,125 --> 00:40:32,916
[SHIN] St. Petersburg, sir?

601
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
[MICHELE] The Order of
Raphael was destroyed

602
00:40:35,083 --> 00:40:39,041
in a battle at Narva not
far from west of there.

603
00:40:39,125 --> 00:40:40,583
Our reports say that the enemy

604
00:40:40,666 --> 00:40:43,666
was a Knightmare squad that
appeared behind our lines.

605
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:45,708
It just doesn't
make any sense to me.

606
00:40:45,791 --> 00:40:47,958
The EU forces that
occupied Narva were,

607
00:40:48,041 --> 00:40:51,000
by all rights,
completely surrounded.

608
00:40:51,375 --> 00:40:53,041
It's unlikely
that reinforcements

609
00:40:53,125 --> 00:40:54,833
could have gotten
to them undetected.

610
00:40:56,583 --> 00:40:57,583
[MICHELE]
The enemy appeared

611
00:40:57,666 --> 00:40:59,750
without warning
amidst the siege line.

612
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:01,333
[SHIN]
Without warning?

613
00:41:01,416 --> 00:41:03,208
[MICHELE] That's what
the survivors are saying.

614
00:41:05,708 --> 00:41:08,375
They supposedly just
appeared out of thin air.

615
00:41:08,958 --> 00:41:10,791
That brings General
Hannibal to mind,

616
00:41:10,875 --> 00:41:13,125
attacking the ancient
Roman empire.

617
00:41:13,208 --> 00:41:14,458
Hannibal?

618
00:41:14,875 --> 00:41:18,208
I see your point.
The "Ghost of Hannibal," indeed.

619
00:41:19,041 --> 00:41:21,000
If there are
any ghosts here,

620
00:41:21,083 --> 00:41:23,375
it's Europia United itself.

621
00:41:23,458 --> 00:41:26,500
The ghost of a revolution
three centuries past.

622
00:41:26,583 --> 00:41:27,750
They're a bunch of cowards

623
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:30,708
who are loyal to nothing
but their own interests.

624
00:41:30,791 --> 00:41:35,041
It's up to noble-minded Euro
Britannia to oust statesmen

625
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:38,250
such as these and lead
the region in their stead.

626
00:41:38,333 --> 00:41:40,541
Our cause is a just one!

627
00:41:41,625 --> 00:41:43,250
[MICHELE]
Shin,

628
00:41:43,333 --> 00:41:46,916
the blood of Oriental
warriors flows in your veins,

629
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,250
and you will soon be
a part of the aristocracy

630
00:41:49,333 --> 00:41:51,625
and its storied
thousand-year history.

631
00:41:51,708 --> 00:41:54,500
[SHIN] Your words
honor me, Sir Manfredi.

632
00:41:55,708 --> 00:41:57,375
[SHIN]
And now...

633
00:41:57,458 --> 00:42:00,500
...I will take over
the Order of Michael.

634
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:04,375
[laughs]

635
00:42:04,458 --> 00:42:06,166
You know,
you're always so serious

636
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:08,666
it's difficult to tell
when you're joking.

637
00:42:09,833 --> 00:42:11,375
In another five years.

638
00:42:11,458 --> 00:42:12,875
I will step down

639
00:42:12,958 --> 00:42:16,000
and you will lead the Order
of Michael as my successor.

640
00:42:16,791 --> 00:42:19,375
I'm actually looking
forward to that day, Shin.

641
00:42:19,458 --> 00:42:21,625
Y'know, after all this time,

642
00:42:21,708 --> 00:42:24,666
you've come to mean more
to me than my own brother.

643
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:25,625
Brother?

644
00:42:25,708 --> 00:42:26,666
[MICHELE]
That's right.

645
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:29,000
Let's enter the
new world together.

646
00:42:31,833 --> 00:42:33,416
You're horrible.

647
00:42:36,083 --> 00:42:37,500
[MICHELE]
Shin.

648
00:42:37,583 --> 00:42:40,083
[SHIN]
It's rather unfortunate.

649
00:42:40,166 --> 00:42:43,500
You don't have what it takes
to command the Order of Michael.

650
00:42:44,708 --> 00:42:46,958
What are you saying?

651
00:42:47,041 --> 00:42:52,708
You are unfit. Apologies.

652
00:43:04,166 --> 00:43:08,291
[SHIN] Sir Manfredi.
Please begin your journey.

653
00:43:08,375 --> 00:43:10,875
[MICHELE]
Of course. It is time.

654
00:43:17,458 --> 00:43:21,166
At your command,
Shin Hyuga Shaing, my lord.

655
00:43:33,875 --> 00:43:36,375
Safe travels, Manfredi.

656
00:44:30,458 --> 00:44:31,750
[LEILA]
Akito?

657
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,625
Why, good morning,
Commander Malcal.

658
00:44:41,708 --> 00:44:44,666
Good morning to you,
Lieutenant Hyuga.

659
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:46,958
[LEILA] What are
you doing out here?

660
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:50,166
[AKITO]
I'm keeping a promise.

661
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:52,166
[LEILA]
To who?

662
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:55,000
It's a grave for those
killed in the Narva operation.

663
00:44:55,083 --> 00:44:57,750
So it's a monument?

664
00:44:57,833 --> 00:44:59,625
That's nice of you.

665
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,333
[AKITO] We all made a pact
before the mission.

666
00:45:02,416 --> 00:45:03,916
Those who survived

667
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,666
would build something
here for the ones that didn't.

668
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,708
I was the only survivor.

669
00:45:11,791 --> 00:45:13,750
I could have done more.
Acted sooner.

670
00:45:13,833 --> 00:45:16,250
All of them should
have made it home alive.

671
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:20,291
[AKITO] They set out on the
mission excited to serve the EU.

672
00:45:20,375 --> 00:45:22,208
Yep. That's correct.

673
00:45:25,166 --> 00:45:26,833
Because we died in battle,

674
00:45:26,916 --> 00:45:29,875
our families are
now full EU citizens.

675
00:45:30,416 --> 00:45:32,166
That's enough.

676
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:35,291
[BROWN HAIR FIGHTER 1A]
And yet I wonder,

677
00:45:35,375 --> 00:45:37,750
why do you fight, Akito?

678
00:45:37,833 --> 00:45:42,083
You don't have a family
or a country to protect.

679
00:45:42,166 --> 00:45:43,916
You're alone.

680
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,833
What do you live for?

681
00:45:47,875 --> 00:45:49,916
So I can die.

682
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:53,916
[LEILA]
Lieutenant Hyuga?

683
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,916
[LEILA] Did I say something
I shouldn't have?

684
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
You got quiet all of a sudden.

685
00:46:00,833 --> 00:46:02,916
[AKITO]
No. It's not that.

686
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,833
I was just talking
with them, that's all.

687
00:46:05,916 --> 00:46:07,416
With who?

688
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:11,458
[AKITO] They're supposed to be
dead, but I can still hear them.

689
00:46:11,541 --> 00:46:13,750
I can hear their voices.

690
00:46:17,083 --> 00:46:21,541
[AKITO] Because...
I died myself once.
