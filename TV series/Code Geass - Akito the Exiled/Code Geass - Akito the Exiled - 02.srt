1
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:20,791
[NARRATOR] Revolutionary
Calendar, year 228.

2
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:23,333
It's been seven years
since Japan was invaded

3
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:27,416
by the Holy Empire of
Britannian and renamed Area 11.

4
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,583
To stem the spread of Britannian
power in western Eurasia,

5
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:34,208
the United Republic of Europia
carried out commando raids

6
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:36,958
with Alexanders
piloted by Elevens.

7
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:39,791
Leila Malcal and
General Smilas were attacked

8
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:42,458
while traveling
from HQ in Paris.

9
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:44,583
Their assailants were
a young gang of Elevens

10
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:47,000
who lived in the
Paris underground.

11
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:49,041
They nearly
kidnapped the general.

12
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:53,666
However, their plan was
foiled by Akito, singlehandedly.

13
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,416
Leila promised
to spare the lives

14
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,291
of Ryo and his two friends
under one condition--

15
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:01,541
that they join her
wZERO assault unit.

16
00:01:36,416 --> 00:01:38,208
[VELAINES] In the name
of the heavens, the Earth,

17
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:42,500
and the Holy Spirit. I, Duke
Velaines, decree the following:

18
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:45,500
Shin Hyuga Shaing
shall be named commander

19
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:47,875
of the Holy Order of Michael,

20
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:50,458
one of the Four Great
Orders that is bound

21
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:55,833
to serve and protect the Empire
we now know as Euro-Britannia.

22
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:59,208
Lord Shang, if you would
approach the throne.

23
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:07,583
[CROWD]
All hail Britannia!

24
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:13,375
[cheering]

25
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:14,625
[ASHLEY]
This'll be exciting.

26
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:16,041
Why's that, Master?

27
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:18,083
If I fight alongside
Lord Shaing,

28
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:20,375
I can take the world.

29
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm ready to see
some action, y'know?

30
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:28,333
The late Manfredi was
a dear friend of mine.

31
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:31,166
There's no way that he
would ever take his own life.

32
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,666
I can assure you, for I knew
him better than anyone else.

33
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,458
Rest assured, sir, I shall
deal with the Ghost of Hannibal,

34
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:41,333
and I will make certain
that my Order of Michael

35
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:45,583
works to restore the honor
of your Order of Raphael.

36
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,208
[YOUNG SHIN]
Die.

37
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:55,708
Akito. Die now.

38
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:57,166
Die.

39
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,000
[YOUNG AKITO]
No!

40
00:02:58,083 --> 00:02:59,375
[YOUNG SHIN]
Die.

41
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:01,125
[YOUNG AKITO]
No!

42
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:09,541
[YOUNG SHIN]
Die!

43
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:35,958
[whispering voices]

44
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,958
[LEILA]
This place has a silence to it

45
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:06,250
that makes the bustle of
the city seem like a dream.

46
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:12,333
Revolutionary Calendar,
year 228, Prairial the seventh.

47
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:15,708
It's been a month since our
operation center was relocated

48
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:18,833
from Paris to the
remote Weiswolf Castle.

49
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:22,791
I have yet to hear from General
HQ regarding mission plans.

50
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:25,000
While I enjoy
the peace and quiet,

51
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:27,500
I fear that it will
not last very long.

52
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,583
[LEILA]
This peace will soon be replaced

53
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,541
with the bloody cries of war.

54
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,541
Akito.

55
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:10,333
[SOPHIE] So tell me, how are
things progressing, Joe?

56
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:13,750
[JOE] Without a hitch the data
transfer from the neuro device

57
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:16,416
should finish right
on schedule, Dr. Randle.

58
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,166
[SOPHIE]
Anna will be glad to hear it.

59
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:19,875
[JOE]
You want a lolli?

60
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,541
Not right now, thanks.

61
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:22,583
[JOE]
You sure? They're delicious.

62
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:23,708
What about the other three?

63
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,250
How do their E.E.G.s look?

64
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,250
Pretty promising, if you ask me.

65
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:28,916
I realize that
they're kinda scary,

66
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,041
but they've all got AAA
compatibility ratings.

67
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:33,291
It's amazing.

68
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,791
They seem to be a
good match for Akito, too.

69
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:38,333
What's the BRS
success probability?

70
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:40,625
I would say it's around
eighty-seven-percent.

71
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:41,958
Oh really?

72
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,458
Yeah, and they're not
even parents or siblings.

73
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:45,750
Strange, huh?

74
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:48,500
Yeah it is. Very strange.

75
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,208
[AYANO]
Hey, Ryo.

76
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:55,208
How long do you plan
to stick around here?

77
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:57,708
[RYO] As long as we continue
to get free room and board.

78
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,333
And y'know, I dig how
it looks like an old castle

79
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:01,208
but it's all modern
and high-tech inside.

80
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,166
Plus there's not
a rat to be seen.

81
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,583
Right, Yukiya?

82
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:05,791
Yep, that's true.

83
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:08,000
What'd Ayano call them? "Icky"?

84
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,666
You realize they're gonna
slap uniforms on us

85
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,166
and send us to war, right?

86
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,833
[RYO]
Don't get so worked up.

87
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:15,083
We both know the real
reason Ayano's freaking out

88
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,791
is 'cause they
confiscated her dagger

89
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:17,583
Truth.

90
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:18,666
Yeah, so what?

91
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,916
It belongs to me!
They've no right!

92
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,958
How could a
Japanese citizen work for--

93
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:24,583
Hey, Yukiya, have
you finished setting up

94
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,375
our next game yet?

95
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,208
Yeah, just about.

96
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:31,333
What does that mean? Tell me!

97
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:33,750
Look, don't worry, you'll
find out soon enough.

98
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,000
C'mon, just tell me guys!

99
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:36,208
[YUKIYA]
Ayano.

100
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,666
All you need to know
is that we belong here.

101
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,291
Trust me.

102
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:42,958
[HAMMEL] Are you
sure it's a good idea

103
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:45,208
to keep those Eleven...
Er... Excuse me,

104
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:47,833
I mean those Japanese
kids running loose, sir?

105
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:50,458
[CLAUS] Why? Has there been
a problem, Major Hammel?

106
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,458
[HAMMEL] You do realize
that they're criminals?

107
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:55,083
They attempted to
abduct General Smilas.

108
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,583
[CLAUS]
I know, I know.

109
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,333
Under normal circumstances,
they would be executed.

110
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:00,833
That's right!

111
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:02,041
Don't you think they should
be brought to justice, sir?

112
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:03,666
Commander Malcal
brought them here,

113
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,875
and said she wanted
to use them somehow.

114
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,375
So why not?

115
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,791
I mean, General Smilas did
give his approval, after all.

116
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:12,333
If they were to take
any hostile action,

117
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,250
it'd be difficult to subdue
them with nothing more

118
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,208
than my special forces team.

119
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:18,416
You worry too much.

120
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,708
There's no way
they could outsmart

121
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,750
the elaborate
security system here.

122
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:25,666
Besides, Major, it's good for us
to have people like them around.

123
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,500
People who won't be
missed if they disappear

124
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:28,916
or perhaps even die.

125
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:35,375
[AYANO]
I'm so sick of those simulators.

126
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:36,833
[YUKIYA]
At least they're comfy.

127
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:39,208
They're better than the
machine that spins you around.

128
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:40,833
Yeah, didn't you
puke on that one?

129
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:43,375
It's not my fault I'm
that I get motion sickness.

130
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:53,041
A cat?

131
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,166
[YUKIYA]
That's why there's no rats.

132
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,208
[EARL ORLEANS]
May I offer my congratulations

133
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,958
on your son's success?

134
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:09,541
The Shaing family's
position is now secure.

135
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,166
Why, thank you, Earl Orleans.

136
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,583
That's nice of you to say.

137
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:15,666
To be honest, we owe it
all to the late Sir Manfredi.

138
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,500
Pardon me ma'am, but where
is the party's guest of honor?

139
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,041
I've been looking everywhere.

140
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,458
Well, I'm not sure.

141
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:23,958
Now that you mention it,
I haven't seen him for a while.

142

[SHIN]
Come in, Alice.

143
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,041
You don't want Mother
to worry, do you?

144
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,166
[ALICE]
I hate these silly parties.

145
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,541
I don't know a
single person in there.

146
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,000
Here's an idea.

147
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:36,041
Why don't you and I take a
drive to the coast tomorrow?

148
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,958
Wouldn't that be fun?

149
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:42,791
Please, promise me
we'll go, Brother.

150
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,166
I have to be at the Order of
Michael's review ceremony.

151
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,291
Awww... That's tomorrow?

152
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:51,250
[SHIN] Yes, and I won't
be back for some time.

153
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:52,500
I'm sorry.

154
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:54,833
But I promise as soon
as I have leave,

155
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:57,208
I'll spend some
time with you, Alice.

156
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,416
[ALICE]
You mean it?

00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:20,666
Hello?

159
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,083
[CLAUS] Sorry for calling
at this hour, Commander.

160
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:23,500
I didn't wake you up, did I?

161
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,208
Oh no, I'm working late.

162
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:26,583
[CLAUS]
Good on you.

163
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,041
Anyway, I thought you
should know operation orders

164
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:30,375
were just received from HQ.

165
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:32,208
[CLAUS] I'll bring them
over to you right away.

166
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:34,250
You can unseal them there.

167
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,791
[CLAUS]
Another suicide mission...

168
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,416
[coughs] I mean,

169
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,041
we've been tasked with another
difficult mission, Commander.

170
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,291
Well, according to this,

171
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,250
they're moving up the
Warsaw garrison force.

172
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,458
But aren't they
for internal matters?

173
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:49,500
I can only assume that
the latest public opinion poll

174
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:52,666
rattled the government bigwigs.

175
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,791
They know that if they can't
keep the populace distracted

176
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,083
by what's going on elsewhere,

177
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:59,083
it'll buy them time
to cover their own butts.

178
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:01,666
[LEILA]
And so they've decided to have

179
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,500
the Wyvern Squad drop
inside of enemy lines?!

180
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,125
[CLAUS]
Well, to put it bluntly,

181
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,000
they're going to
be used as decoys.

182
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,666
They're sacrificial pawns.

183
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,625
They don't stand a
chance against the enemy.

184
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:13,000
They don't have the
manpower needed

185
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,791
to carry out a
mission like this!

186
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:17,833
You can't just disobey
their orders, can you?

187
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:20,291
You're going to have to think
outside of the box, Commander.

188
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,333
Sound reasoning won't help you.

189
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,875
I suppose that
you have no choice.

190
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,750
Here's the thing,
if you want those Elevens

191
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,666
to come back in one piece,

192
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,041
you'll have to think of a
way to make that happen.

193
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,458
It's your duty as the Commander.

194
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:05,708
[LEILA] Lieutenant Hyuga,
it's good to see you again.

195
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,375
Thank you for meeting with me.

196
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,291
Well, you ordered me to be here.

197
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,458
No need for pleasantries.

198
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:13,125
You're right, I did.

199
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:15,500
Have a seat and
we'll get started.

200
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,625
May I offer you some tea?

201
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:20,666
It's a fantastic blend
with a lovely aroma.

202
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,625
Is this about those three kids?

203
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:28,875
Yes. I was hoping that
I might get your opinion

204
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:31,750
on the matter, Lieutenant Hyuga.

205
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,500
I'm sorry, here.

206
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:35,916
I'm a bit dubious.

207
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,416
Do you really think
they'll follow orders

208
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,541
and march into battle for you?

209
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:42,250
I think they've
accepted their fate.

210
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,875
That's simply what you
want to see, Commander.

211
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,833
That isn't the reality.

212
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:48,083
If they leave,

213
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,291
they'd be putting their
lives in grave danger.

214
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:51,416
[AKITO]
And why is that?

215
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,375
Because they're criminals?

216
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:54,583
Or because they are Elevens?

217
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:55,458
[LEILA]
I only meant that--

218
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:56,666
[AKITO]
No, it's all right.

219
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,125
I'd rather you speak
the unvarnished truth.

220
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,958
I don't want to waste any time.

221
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:05,916
I can only assume they
know what you have in mind.

222
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,500
In that case...

223
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:08,708
Be careful.

224
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:11,208
You can be sure
they're looking for an exit.

225
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,750
[ANNA]
You're planning on using drones.

226
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,250
I'll admit

227
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:12,250
I think using unmanned machines
in combat is a great idea.

228
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,208
But with our current AI system.

229
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:17,416
I doubt it'll live up
to your expectations.

230
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,500
They'd have to to react to
their targets instantly, right?

231
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:24,291
But that level of artificial
intelligence doesn't exist yet.

232
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,458
[CHLOE] Being in the
military's a lot harder

233
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,875
than I thought it'd be,
eh, Sergeant Hilda?

234
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:31,666
[HILDA] I thought I was getting
a cushy civil service job.

235
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,166
Guess not.

236
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,208
Yeah.

237
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,541
I thought that, too.

238
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:36,833
If we stick with it,

239
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,166
maybe we'll become
Technical Officers someday.

240
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:44,708
We cut the time down
by point-zero-five seconds!

241
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,208
It's a new record!

242
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:49,250
Seems that the 25D
unit worked like a charm.

243
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,875
[ANNA] Hello, ladies.
Is the upload complete yet?

244
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:52,958
[CHLOE]
All done, Boss.

245
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,583
We're running the final checks.

246
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,458
[HILDA] It's working
really well now, ma'am.

247
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,541
And it's all thanks
to Akito's data.

248
00:13:58,625 --> 00:13:59,958
Good to hear.

249
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:03,166
It looks like this will help us
roll out the Type 02.

250
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,583
[YUKIYA]
Hey, Ayano, what time is it?

251
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:10,041
[AYANO]
Hmm? It's 3:02.

252
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:15,750
Wow, it's already three?

253
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:18,583
I'm kinda hungry.
What about you, Ryo?

254
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:21,500
Yeah, I guess I could eat.

255
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:24,541
Do you wanna head down to
the cafeteria for a quick bite?

256
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,416
Nah, have you ever
tried their snacks?

257
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,916
So gross.

258
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
[RYO] Then why don't
you hold out until dinner?

259
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:33,041
[YUKIYA] Yeah, you're right,
I'm not that hungry.

260
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:35,000
I'm sure I can
tough it out till then.

261
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,666
It's probably for the best.

262
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,000
We've got more simulator
training later today.

263
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,125
Eat too much now
and you'll be puking.

264
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,750
And there we go.

265
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,416
Okay, we're in the clear now.

266
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,125
Attaboy, Yukiya!

267
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:50,250
All right, you guys.
Let's get started!

268
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:51,375
It's not like I know
anything about it.

269
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:52,208
[MALE TECH 2A]
Major Hammel.

270
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,583
Anything to report?

271
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:56,458
Be sure to keep an eye
on those new wZERO recruits.

272
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:57,708
[MALE TECH 2B]
We've been watching, sir.

273
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,875
But there's nothing new
to report at the moment.

274
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,708
[ANNA] You've always been
such a workaholic, Leila.

275
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:09,333
You need to relax
and unwind sometimes.

276
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:13,000
We can't let this beautiful
garden go to waste, now can we?

277
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:14,458
[ANNA sighs]

278
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,500
I think we've got a problem.

279
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:19,583
[LEILA]
What is it, Anna?

280
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,791
[ANNA]
Up there. Look, on the ledge.

281
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,625
Isn't that your kitty cat?

282
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,666
Eliza!

283
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:33,666
[YUKIYA] I managed to
hack into the main server.

284
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,958
I've got the security cameras
playing looped footage

285
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:38,125
of us hanging out in this room.

286
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:39,500
Even better...

287
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:42,125
I also tweaked these.

288
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,958
I loaded them with fake data

289
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:46,333
that'll allow us to pass
through their security.

290
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:52,791
[LEILA]
I don't understand

291
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,958
how she could've
gotten out of my room.

292
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:20,541
What?

293
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:27,625
A secret passage?

294
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,208
[YUKIYA]
Welcome back.

295
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,500
Akito Hyuga.

296
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:51,833
[AKITO] That a handmade
bomb you've got there?

297
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:53,791
[YUKIYA]
Don't come any closer.

298
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,500
Akito.

299
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,750
You'll never let
my friends leave.

300
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:02,625
That's why I've decided
to die and take you with me.

301
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,250
You've gotta be kidding me!

302
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:13,125
There aren't any
Knightmares in here?

303
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:19,125
These're cockpits.

304
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,416
They must be down there.

305
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:25,833
[YUKIYA]
You know, you and I.

306
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:28,666
We've got a lot more in
common than you might think.

307
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,166
Let's have a chat before we die.

308
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,333
[AKITO]
Get it over with,

309
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:34,041
before the special forces
squad shows up.

310
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,625
I'm not worried about that.

311
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:39,458
They're busy watching a virtual
reality show I constructed.

312
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:40,750
But enough about them.

313
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,791
Take a look at this.

314
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,916
What do you think?

315
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,250
Ugly, isn't it?

316
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:52,000
I've got plenty more scars
where that came from.

317
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:53,625
Know how I got them?

318
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:54,666
[AKITO]
I couldn't care less.

319
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,041
[YUKIYA]
Aw c'mon, don't be like that

320
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:57,750
why don't you try
having a little fun?

321
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:00,458
I mean, you are about to die.

322
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,333
[sighs]
You're a tough audience.

323
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:08,416
Look, I'll throw it
in free of charge.

324
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,416
My parting gift to you.

325
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,541
Three years ago.

326
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:16,500
I lived in Amsterdam's
Japanese ghetto.

327
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:18,208
The adults' sense of inferiority

328
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:21,583
and discontent trickled down
and infected the youth.

329
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:23,791
The kids took their
frustrations out on those

330
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,583
who were weaker than them.

331
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:28,916
The Japanese persecuting
the Japanese.

332
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:31,375
But I fought back.

333
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:34,666
They deserved to die so
I took them out with a bang.

334
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:41,000
I don't give a rat's ass about
the Japanese, the "Elevens."

335
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,041
The world's better
off without them.

336
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,083
I escaped the ghetto.

337
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:50,208
But in order to
avoid the police,

338
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:52,916
I had to stay
underground in the sewers.

339
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:57,708
[YUKIYA] That's where
I met Ryo and his gang.

340
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:01,916
For the first time in my life,
I had friends I could trust.

341
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,208
They're the closest
thing I have to family.

342
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:08,541
Which is why I won't let
any more of them die.

343
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:12,416
I'll do anything
to protect them.

344
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:16,041
What makes you think
that going into battle

345
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:17,833
means certain death?

346
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,250
I'm still alive, aren't I?

347
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:20,750
[YUKIYA]
That's true, rumor has it

348
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:25,125
you survived by using your
squad mates as human shields.

349
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,208
[AKITO]
Only one way to know for sure.

350
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,666
And that's to
come fight with me.

351
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,500
There's one of me
and three of you.

352
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,333
You have the advantage.

353
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,583
[YUKIYA]
I hadn't thought of that.

354
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:40,583
But you're right. Hahahaha!

355
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:46,583
Akito, you're
an interesting guy.

356
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,958
There aren't gonna be
any communications cables

357
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:56,958
out here in the forest.

358
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,875
Freaking Yukiya!

359
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:01,666
Are you heading
back to the castle?

360
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:02,750
I'll show you the
way if you tell me

361
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:05,250
what your friends are up to.

362
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:06,083
Talk to me!

363
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,416
I promise I'm on your side!

364
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,708
Like hell you are!

365
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,666
You're planning to use us
as disposable pawns!

366
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,083
[LEILA]
No, that's not true!

367
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:13,583
Just hear me out.

368
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:15,041
I want to ensure your safety
and I've found a way to do--

369
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:16,625
[AYANO]
Shut up!

370
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:19,708
You've never even been on the
battlefield before, have you?

371
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:21,500
[AYANO]
How many of us have to die?

372
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,000
Tell me,

373
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,333
how many Elevens have been
killed in your stupid campaign?

374
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:25,291
[LEILA]
No one else will die.

375
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:27,333
I'll see to that myself.

376
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:29,958
I'll be there.

377
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,125
I'll fight beside you.

378
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,208
Damn it!

379
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:50,541
[LEILA]
Go ahead.

380
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,083
[CLAUS]
It's Lieutenant Colonel Warwick.

381
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,125
Do you read me, Commander?

382
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:54,208
[LEILA]
Yes, something wrong?

383
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:55,666
[CLAUS]
Well, I couldn't help but notice

384
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:59,375
that you're on your way
to the launch site.

385
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,750
So... has something
happened with the Elevens?

386
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,333
[LEILA]
Why do you ask?

387
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:05,041
[CLAUS] Well, the video
surveillance feed

388
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,291
of their room cut out
suddenly and...

389
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:08,791
...we're not quite sure
what to make of it.

390
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,208
[LEILA]
I think I know what caused it.

391
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:12,041
[CLAUS]
Oh, you do? Care to fill us in?

392
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:14,291
I'm sorry but I'll have
to explain it to you later--

393
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:15,291
I can't talk right now.

394
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,208
[CLAUS]
Ma'am, wait!

395
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:38,625
What in the hell is that?

396
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:46,708
No way.

397
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:50,458
[LEILA] An ultra-long range,
extra-atmospheric transport.

398
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:51,833
Using this new
weapon we can drop

399
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:56,833
behind enemy lines for
surprise commando assaults.

400
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,625
I see now.

401
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:01,083
This thing's got
Knightmares inside it.

402
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:03,791
So you'll shoot us into space,
then watch us die.

403
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,458
[LEILA]
As always in times of war.

404
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:08,166
There's a chance some soldiers
won't make it back alive.

405
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,458
That said, I would like
for us all to return safely.

406
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:12,958
[RYO]
What was that?

407
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:14,916
You said "us" like you're
gonna come along.

408
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,625
[LEILA]
I am.

409
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:23,041
Hahaha!

410
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:27,000
Wait a minute, you don't
really mean that, do you?

411
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:29,916
'Cause if so you're either
naïve, or you're a fool.

412
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,083
[LEILA]
Well either way.

413
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:32,708
As the person who
planned this operation,

414
00:22:32,791 --> 00:22:36,500
I consider it my duty to ensure
that everyone returns safely.

415
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:39,291
If you think that makes me
foolish, then so be it.

416
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:43,583
[RYO]
It's your funeral lady.

417
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:08,750
Sir Kururugi,
we should be arriving

418
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:10,916
in St. Petersburg in
about twelve hours.

419
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,500
[SUZAKU]
I see.

420
00:23:12,583 --> 00:23:15,083
[MALE GUARD 2A] May I ask how
the Military Advisor is feeling?

421
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:17,500
[SUZAKU]
He's fine. You may go now.

422
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:18,958
[MALE GUARD 2A]
Yes, my lord!

423
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:31,708
[LELOUCH] Suzaku, please,
would you get me some water?

424
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:35,375
I'm begging you... I need water.

425
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:37,125
Help me.

426
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,625
Water.

427
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:41,416
[grunts]

428
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:50,625
[MALE COUNT VOICE 2A]
82. 81. 480.

429
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:52,333
[SARA] We're at
eight minutes to liftoff.

430
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:53,958
The launch countdown has begun.

431
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:55,416
Please stand by.

432
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,583
[ANNA]
All systems are normal.

433
00:23:57,666 --> 00:23:58,875
[CLAUS]
Here we go.

434
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:01,250
Let's see how far
this little lady takes this.

435
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:03,208
Well, as long as she makes
it back in one piece,

436
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:04,208
then she's good.

437
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:05,500
Joe Wise, do we have a timeline

438
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:07,833
on the BRS program
calibration just yet?

439
00:24:07,916 --> 00:24:09,125
Just a little longer.

440
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:11,125
I'll have it done
before the launch.

441
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:26,500
Hey, Hilda?

442
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:29,000
How much longer for the
Type 02 upload to be completed?

443
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:29,875
Forty-five seconds.

444
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:31,625
That's cutting it close!

445
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:36,875
[SARA] All systems now switched
from external to internal power.

446
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,041
[MALE GENERAL 2A] An order
has been issued instructing

447
00:25:19,125 --> 00:25:20,875
all forces to
prepare for battle.

448
00:25:20,958 --> 00:25:22,625
[MALE GENERAL 2B] We'll begin
our advance precisely one hour

449
00:25:22,708 --> 00:25:24,708
after Apollo's Chariot launches.

450
00:25:24,791 --> 00:25:26,208
That's good. Remember,

451
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:28,916
we're merely carrying out
the orders of Joint Staff HQ.

452
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,666
Be sure not to go above or
beyond what's asked of you.

453
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,750
[MALE GENERAL 2B] Here's hoping
this operation is successful.

454
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:37,291
And if it fails, we won't
have to take the fall for it.

455
00:26:03,833 --> 00:26:06,041
[CLAUS] All right everyone,
the purpose of this mission

456
00:26:06,125 --> 00:26:10,000
is to assist the main EU force
that's stationed in Warsaw.

457
00:26:10,083 --> 00:26:13,666
They will march on
Area 24A of the Eastern front.

458
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:16,500
Our Wyvern Squad will drop
in behind the Britannian forces

459
00:26:16,583 --> 00:26:18,250
that are already
deployed in the area.

460
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:19,250
Once they've landed
and regrouped,

461
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:21,208
they'll conduct a commando raid.

462
00:26:21,291 --> 00:26:23,708
This'll throw the enemy lines
into chaos, weakening them

463
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:26,708
just as the 103rd Corps
begins their frontal attack.

464
00:26:26,791 --> 00:26:29,166
So you're dropping us
right into the enemy's lap.

465
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:31,708
Sounds like you're trying
to burn off a few Elevens.

466
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:33,791
C'mon, guys,
don't be so pessimistic.

467
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:35,125
Look, all you have
to do is meet up

468
00:26:35,208 --> 00:26:37,083
with the advancing 103rd Corps.

469
00:26:37,166 --> 00:26:39,041
They'll make sure that
you get back here safely.

470
00:26:39,125 --> 00:26:41,416
Yeah, should be easy when
we're surrounded by enemies.

471
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,416
Assuming we live
through re-entry.

472
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,416
What's with you
former Japanese kids?

473
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,958
You're a bunch
of negative Nellies.

474
00:26:48,041 --> 00:26:49,666
Let's change the
subject, shall we?

475
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:52,916
I have an announcement that
should lighten the mood in here.

476
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,166
The commander herself

477
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:56,250
is going to be taking part
in this operation.

478
00:26:56,333 --> 00:26:57,916
[gasps]

479
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,625
[ANNA] Huh?!
Leila, are you serious?

480
00:27:00,708 --> 00:27:02,000
Yes, I don't have a choice.

481
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:03,625
A commando raid
will be ineffective

482
00:27:03,708 --> 00:27:06,250
without sufficient troops.
It is my duty.

483
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,833
I know that it's dangerous.

484
00:27:07,916 --> 00:27:09,750
However, we only have
a handful of personnel

485
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:13,375
who're capable of fighting.
To bolster those numbers,

486
00:27:13,458 --> 00:27:16,833
I've decided to employ the
use of unmanned drones.

487
00:27:16,916 --> 00:27:18,875
But in order for them
to be successful,

488
00:27:18,958 --> 00:27:22,333
someone must act as an
operator to control the drones.

489
00:27:22,416 --> 00:27:23,458
That's why.

490
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:26,083
I'm going along with
the Wyvern Squad.

491
00:27:34,333 --> 00:27:36,416
He smiled.

492
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,583
Ayano.

493
00:27:37,666 --> 00:27:39,375
You should try to
get some shut eye.

494
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:40,208
I mean, it's not like
we're gonna be

495
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:41,958
doing anything for a while.

496
00:27:42,041 --> 00:27:43,583
[YUKIYA]
He's got a good point.

497
00:27:43,666 --> 00:27:46,833
And if you doze off you'll get
to die peacefully in your sleep.

498
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,125
[OLIVIA]
T-minus one minute to liftoff.

00:27:54,208 --> 00:27:56,333
Activating drive batteries.

All systems ready for launch!

T-plus three minutes!

508
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:35,833
Primary engine burn normal.

00:29:35,916 --> 00:29:38,291
[SARA]
Altitude, 108 kilometers.

Velocity is stable.

511
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:42,791
Apollo's Chariot
is flying smoothly.

Primary engine

Velocity. 5.6 klicks per second.

Inertial guidance
is operational.

00:30:28,833 --> 00:30:31,916
That went smoothly
now onto the hard part.

521
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,666
If this is the last thing
we're gonna see,

522
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:43,791
we could do worse.

523
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:46,166
Everything looks so
tiny from up here.

524
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:48,291
Feel like I could smash it.

525
00:30:48,916 --> 00:30:50,750
It's beautiful.

526
00:30:57,458 --> 00:31:01,333
[ASHLEY]
God, I'm bored. Bored. Bored.

527
00:31:01,416 --> 00:31:03,291
I'm going to die of boredom.

528
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:05,250
How long are we gonna
have to stay cooped up

529
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:07,541
in this musty dump, huh?

530
00:31:07,625 --> 00:31:08,416
Joannes!

531
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,333
Yes, sir? What is it, Master?

532
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:20,250
We have some time on our hands.

533
00:31:20,333 --> 00:31:22,750
So how would you
like to play a game?

534
00:31:23,375 --> 00:31:24,583
Tell me something.

535
00:31:24,666 --> 00:31:25,875
What's the one
thing that you need

536
00:31:25,958 --> 00:31:28,750
in order to survive
on the battlefield?

537
00:31:28,833 --> 00:31:31,000
Um, the skill to... win?

538
00:31:31,083 --> 00:31:34,875
[sighs] C'mon, surely you
can do better than that?

539
00:31:34,958 --> 00:31:36,750
[gasps]

540
00:31:36,833 --> 00:31:38,083
[ASHLEY]
Listen closely.

541
00:31:38,166 --> 00:31:40,000
Wanna know the one thing
that's crucial to survival

542
00:31:40,083 --> 00:31:41,750
on the battlefield?

543
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:43,833
It's luck.

544
00:31:43,916 --> 00:31:45,458
It doesn't matter
how skilled you are

545
00:31:45,541 --> 00:31:48,458
or how hard you fight,
the fact is you lose you die.

546
00:31:48,541 --> 00:31:49,708
And why is that?

547
00:31:49,791 --> 00:31:51,958
It's because luck
wasn't on your side.

548
00:31:52,041 --> 00:31:54,208
But not me, I'm very lucky.

549
00:31:54,291 --> 00:31:57,500
Would you like a
demonstration? Allow me.

550
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:00,750
Don't do it, Master Ashley!

551
00:32:00,833 --> 00:32:02,625
Please! No!

552
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,083
See? Luck's definitely
on my side.

553
00:32:12,166 --> 00:32:14,458
[JEAN]
You're pathetic.

554
00:32:15,625 --> 00:32:17,958
You honestly believe that
luck will keep you alive?

555
00:32:18,041 --> 00:32:21,333
I never pegged you for
a romantic, Ashley Ashra.

Jean Rowe!

557
00:32:25,666 --> 00:32:26,916
[ASHLEY]
Of course I believe it.

558
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,416
My good fortune is
whats gotten me this far.

559
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,125
Let's see how lucky you are.

560
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:36,000
How about it?

561
00:32:36,083 --> 00:32:37,625
Are you feeling confident?

562
00:32:37,708 --> 00:32:39,958
This has to stop!
It's against regulation!

563
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,375
You can't do this,
Master Ashley!

564
00:32:41,458 --> 00:32:42,625
[ASHLEY]
Just watch me!

565
00:32:42,708 --> 00:32:45,333
Stay where you are
or you'll be next, got it?

566
00:32:45,416 --> 00:32:47,333
How lucky are you, Jean?

567
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,375
Well...

568
00:33:03,458 --> 00:33:04,125
It looks like you've got
a pretty healthy dose

569
00:33:04,208 --> 00:33:05,833
of luck yourself, Jean.

570
00:33:05,916 --> 00:33:08,500
Don't you have better things
to do than play stupid games?

571
00:33:08,583 --> 00:33:10,125
[ASHLEY]
I can't help it, I'm bored--

572
00:33:10,208 --> 00:33:11,958
I'm sick of being
stuck in this palace.

573
00:33:12,041 --> 00:33:13,125
[JEAN]
I see. Well, in that case,

574
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:14,500
you won't be bored for long.

575
00:33:14,583 --> 00:33:16,500
I'm here on behalf
of Lord Shaing.

576
00:33:16,583 --> 00:33:18,375
He'd like a word with you.

577
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:22,208
It took him long enough.

578
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:25,083
Time to test our luck,

I need to know your location.

In the fog of war,

you've gotta keep your
eye out for friendly fire!

Look, whatever you do.

Just make sure that they're
captured unharmed!

605
00:36:10,291 --> 00:36:12,541
I can't make any promises.

Hold on.

609
00:36:18,958 --> 00:36:21,208
Why would they be
exchanging fire already?

610
00:36:21,291 --> 00:36:22,791
Have they been spotted?

611
00:36:22,875 --> 00:36:25,083
[CHLOE] It sure looks like
friendly fire to me.

612
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:27,125
[HILDA] Yeah, seems that
way from this telemetry.

613
00:36:27,208 --> 00:36:28,541
[RYO]
Now, Yukiya!

614
00:36:28,625 --> 00:36:30,291
Target Hyuga from behind!

[YUKIYA]
You want me to kill him here?

616
00:36:34,041 --> 00:36:35,916
Feels like kind of a waste.

Okay. Fine.

Somebody please
tell me what's going on.

Possible enemy bombardment!

[CLAUS]
You've got to be kidding me.

626
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:10,708
Do we know where
the fire is coming from?

627
00:37:10,791 --> 00:37:13,625
[SARA] I'm not detecting
any large-caliber canons.

628
00:37:13,708 --> 00:37:16,625
Signal from the high-altitude
observation balloon is down.

629
00:37:16,708 --> 00:37:18,250
I've lost their coordinates!

630
00:37:18,333 --> 00:37:20,500
[CLAUS] Can't you do a
trajectory calculation?

631
00:37:20,583 --> 00:37:22,083
Calculation complete!

632
00:37:22,166 --> 00:37:24,083
500 klicks northeast.

633
00:37:24,166 --> 00:37:25,750
[CLAUS]
Did you say 500?

634
00:37:25,833 --> 00:37:26,958
Hey, Sara.

635
00:37:27,041 --> 00:37:28,583
Are you sure you ran
those numbers correctly?

636
00:37:28,666 --> 00:37:30,958
[SARA]
Yes, I'm positive, sir!

637
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:32,375
Jeez.

638
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:33,916
We didn't expect them to
use ultra-long range cannons.

639
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Seems our Britannian buddies
had a clever idea of their own.

640
00:38:04,625 --> 00:38:05,708
If we bear north-northwest,

641
00:38:05,791 --> 00:38:08,666
we may be able to
clear the impact zone.

642
00:38:19,541 --> 00:38:21,791
It's a Britannian
Knightmare squad.

643
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,125
[RYO]
We'll settle things later.

644
00:38:47,208 --> 00:38:49,208
After we've made it
out of this mess!

645
00:38:49,291 --> 00:38:50,333
[YUKIYA]
Seriously?

646
00:38:50,416 --> 00:38:52,458
I wish you'd make up your mind.

647
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,166
Ayano! Try to keep up.

648
00:39:07,041 --> 00:39:08,208
[JEAN]
We've pinpointed

649
00:39:08,291 --> 00:39:09,833
the Ghosts of Hannibals'
coordinates, Lord Hyuga.

650
00:39:09,916 --> 00:39:11,000
As you predicted,

651
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:13,000
they're currently heading
towards Slonim.

652
00:39:13,083 --> 00:39:14,750
[SHIN]
What about Ashley and his team?

653
00:39:14,833 --> 00:39:16,166
[JEAN] They're
standing by in position,

654
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:18,375
as per your orders, sir.

655
00:39:18,458 --> 00:39:21,708
Jean, prepare
Vercingetorix at once.

656
00:39:21,791 --> 00:39:25,041
Does this mean you're going into
battle yourself, Lord Hyuga?

657
00:39:25,125 --> 00:39:26,166
That's correct.

658
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:28,916
I want to see these
so called ghosts.

659
00:39:51,833 --> 00:39:53,708
No one's here.

660
00:40:07,416 --> 00:40:08,666
[RYO]
This feels off.

661
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:10,291
Am I the only one getting
the creeps right now?

662
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:12,541
[YUKIYA] I bet there's something
fun just around the corner.

663
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:14,000
No offense Yukiya,

664
00:40:14,083 --> 00:40:16,833
but your opinion of what's
"fun" is kind of messed up.

665
00:40:25,375 --> 00:40:27,166
Drone units in formation.

666
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,791
Let's go.

667
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:37,291
An ambush?

668
00:40:37,666 --> 00:40:38,416
[AKITO]
I've got this.

669
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,208
Stay behind me, Commander.

670
00:40:40,291 --> 00:40:41,583
Lieutenant Hyuga!

671
00:40:41,666 --> 00:40:43,208
I won't let you
get yourself killed.

672
00:40:43,291 --> 00:40:45,458
Those drones won't
work if you're dead.

673
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:47,750
Yes, understood.

674
00:40:47,833 --> 00:40:50,458
I'll do my best to make it
back with the rest of you.

675
00:40:58,708 --> 00:41:01,875
These weaklings are
the Ghosts of Hannibal?

676
00:41:02,833 --> 00:41:04,875
[RYO]
Whoa! It's go time.

677
00:41:13,166 --> 00:41:14,541
[KUZAN]
Wait, is that--?

678
00:41:14,625 --> 00:41:16,625
There are drones mixed in
with the Ghosts of Hannibal!

679
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:17,791
[AYANO]
I don't see any sign of them.

680
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:19,916
[YUKIYA]
They're close, I can feel it.

681
00:41:20,916 --> 00:41:22,750
Ayano! Head's up!

682
00:41:36,458 --> 00:41:37,541
[JAN]
Rene! Franz!

683
00:41:37,625 --> 00:41:39,666
Got my eyes on the Ghost of
Hannibal.

684
00:41:47,208 --> 00:41:48,958
[JOANNES]
Master Ashley!

685
00:41:49,041 --> 00:41:50,500
It appears that most of the
enemy Knightmares are drones!

686
00:41:50,583 --> 00:41:52,000
That's disappointing.

687
00:41:52,083 --> 00:41:53,791
This "Ghost of Hannibal" guy
doesn't live up to the hype.

688
00:41:53,875 --> 00:41:57,458
[JOANNES] Enemy units heading
your way, Master Ashley!

689
00:41:57,541 --> 00:41:59,708
Nice. I'm sick of waiting!

690
00:42:04,833 --> 00:42:05,833
[AKITO]
We need backup, Commander.

691
00:42:05,916 --> 00:42:07,208
Can you summon
the drones over here?

692
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:09,666
There are three...
No, make that two of them

693
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:11,583
engaging the enemy.

694
00:42:11,666 --> 00:42:14,791
Well then, we'll just
force our way through.

695
00:42:14,875 --> 00:42:16,208
Stick close to me
and you'll be fine.

696
00:42:16,291 --> 00:42:18,333
[LEILA]
Lieutenant Hyuga!

697
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:24,041
[AKITO]
Stay back!

698
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:26,583
Commander. Get to safety.

699
00:42:29,166 --> 00:42:31,125
It's a red Knightmare!

700
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:37,750
Ah! So there you are Hannibal!

701
00:42:50,916 --> 00:42:53,208
[ASHLEY]
You think you can outsmart me?

702
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,333
Lieutenant Hyuga.

703
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:06,041
[AKITO]
Die. Die. Die!

704
00:43:10,041 --> 00:43:11,458
[JOANNES]
Master Ashley!

705
00:43:12,833 --> 00:43:14,583
Die!

706
00:43:14,666 --> 00:43:16,166
What the--?

707
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:17,291
What was that?

708
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,791
Akito?

709
00:43:20,208 --> 00:43:22,125
What's causing
this sudden spike?

710
00:43:22,208 --> 00:43:25,375
Die! Die! Die!

711
00:43:25,458 --> 00:43:27,833
You won't defeat
the Ashra Force!

712
00:43:27,916 --> 00:43:29,250
[AKITO]
Die!

713
00:43:39,208 --> 00:43:41,041
Die!

714
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Die!

715
00:44:14,041 --> 00:44:15,875
Are these things really ghosts?

716
00:44:17,541 --> 00:44:20,166
Die!

717
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:21,666
[SOPHIE] Kate, check
the values of the pilots'

718
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:23,250
neuro devices immediately!

719
00:44:23,333 --> 00:44:25,041
[KATE] From what I can tell,
there's been a signal backflow

720
00:44:25,125 --> 00:44:28,250
in Sayama, Kosaka, and
Naruse's neuro devices, ma'am.

721
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:32,583
Their brainwaves are
almost completely in sync now.

722
00:44:32,666 --> 00:44:34,333
Somehow they've networked.

723
00:44:34,416 --> 00:44:35,875
Die!

724
00:44:42,166 --> 00:44:43,833
I see you!

725
00:44:46,708 --> 00:44:48,583
Die!

726
00:44:51,416 --> 00:44:53,000
What in the hell
are these things?

727
00:44:53,083 --> 00:44:54,666
Ferilli. Report!

728
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:55,958
Can you confirm on your end?

729
00:44:56,041 --> 00:44:57,500
[FERILLI]
Yes, ma'am! Confirmed!

730
00:44:57,583 --> 00:44:58,708
What about you, Kate?

731
00:44:58,791 --> 00:45:00,208
[KATE] I'm seeing the
same thing you are.

732
00:45:00,291 --> 00:45:01,666
It looks like the
other pilots' brains

733
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:03,000
are receiving
something from Akito's.

734
00:45:03,083 --> 00:45:04,083
Report, Joe!

735
00:45:04,166 --> 00:45:05,791
I'm gonna need a minute!

736
00:45:05,875 --> 00:45:07,750
This might not be
the best time to ask.

737
00:45:07,833 --> 00:45:08,666
But what's going on?

738
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:10,625
Can't you see that I'm busy?

739
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:12,791
[SOPHIE]
Hurry up, Joe Wise, I need data!

740
00:45:12,875 --> 00:45:14,333
[JOE]
Yes, ma'am!

741
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:22,833
I'll admit you're a lot stronger
than I thought you'd be!

742
00:45:28,625 --> 00:45:30,875
[JEAN] The Ashra Force
is breaking formation.

743
00:45:30,958 --> 00:45:33,791
They can't handle a few
Europian Knightmares?

744
00:45:33,875 --> 00:45:35,000
Embarrassing.

745
00:45:35,083 --> 00:45:37,916
[SHIN]
Jean, you talk too much.

746
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,166
My apologies, sir.

747
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:41,250
I'll keep quiet.

748
00:45:41,333 --> 00:45:44,458
[SHIN] Those Knightmares are
simply fascinating aren't they?

749
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:46,291
Do you see what I see?

750
00:45:46,375 --> 00:45:49,083
[JEAN] I'm not quite
sure what you mean, sir.

751
00:45:50,625 --> 00:45:52,375
I sense it.

752
00:45:55,375 --> 00:45:57,250
You're alive, after all.

753
00:45:59,666 --> 00:46:01,541
This isn't looking good!

754
00:46:05,583 --> 00:46:07,291
He keeps comin' at me!

755
00:46:19,958 --> 00:46:22,708
No escape!
This guy won't let me breathe!

756
00:46:22,791 --> 00:46:23,625
[LEILA]
Lieutenant Hyuga!

757
00:46:23,708 --> 00:46:26,416
Anyone! Please respond!

758
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:27,541
Wyvern Squad!

759
00:46:27,625 --> 00:46:30,375
Do you read me? Report at once!

760
00:46:30,458 --> 00:46:32,916
Somebody please answer me!

761
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:35,416
Mental cloud
intensifying, ma'am!

762
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:38,583
Their ego boundaries are
at their breaking point!

763
00:46:38,666 --> 00:46:40,625
Akito's nervous system
is somehow co-opting

764
00:46:40,708 --> 00:46:43,166
the others' via
their neuro devices.

765
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:44,541
It appears that the
other Warrant Officers

766
00:46:44,625 --> 00:46:47,583
are no longer in control.

767
00:46:47,666 --> 00:46:50,041
It's a... brain raid!

768
00:46:59,458 --> 00:47:01,291
I can't keep this up!

769
00:47:04,125 --> 00:47:05,500
[FRANZ]
Simon, eject! Hurry!

770
00:47:05,583 --> 00:47:06,833
Right, Franz!

771
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:11,291
We won't lose to
inferior soldiers damn it!

772
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,208
Die!

773
00:47:20,416 --> 00:47:21,958
[FRANZ]
You damn monster!

774
00:47:35,916 --> 00:47:37,666
This can't--

775
00:47:38,791 --> 00:47:40,958
I wasn't through with you!

776
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,083
They call you a ghost,

777
00:48:14,166 --> 00:48:15,541
but that's not right!

778
00:48:17,458 --> 00:48:20,375
[ASHLEY] You're some kind
of demon or angel of death!

779
00:48:22,708 --> 00:48:24,000
[AKITO]
Die!

780
00:48:24,875 --> 00:48:26,333
[AKITO]
Die!

781
00:48:27,625 --> 00:48:29,000
[AKITO]
Die!

782
00:48:32,083 --> 00:48:33,666
[JOANNES]
Ashley!

783
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,708
No... Joannes?

784
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:46,208
[JOANNES] Good luck
to you Master... Ashley...

785
00:48:57,583 --> 00:48:58,958
[YOUNG SHIN]
Akito!

786
00:48:59,041 --> 00:49:01,125
Die, now.

787
00:49:01,208 --> 00:49:02,500
Who's that?

788
00:49:02,583 --> 00:49:05,333
[YOUNG SHIN] You're not
supposed to still be alive.

789
00:49:05,416 --> 00:49:08,166
Big brother?

790
00:49:09,875 --> 00:49:12,041
[YOUNG SHIN]
Die!

791
00:49:12,125 --> 00:49:13,458
What in the hell's going on?

792
00:49:13,541 --> 00:49:15,500
That kid, it's...

793
00:49:16,583 --> 00:49:18,166
I feel sick!

794
00:49:19,125 --> 00:49:21,083
A Malamud flash!

795
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:22,750
Ego boundaries, restoring!

796
00:49:22,833 --> 00:49:25,250
Mental backlash. Incoming!

797
00:50:25,333 --> 00:50:26,958
[SHIN]
Ashley. Withdraw.

798
00:50:27,041 --> 00:50:28,250
Lord Shaing.

799
00:50:28,333 --> 00:50:29,583
Let me do this!

800
00:50:29,666 --> 00:50:31,458
[SHIN]
Silence!

801
00:50:31,541 --> 00:50:32,833
I ordered you to fall back.

802
00:50:32,916 --> 00:50:34,750
Do it, Ashley.

803
00:50:35,416 --> 00:50:37,000
Fine. As you wish, sir.

804
00:50:41,041 --> 00:50:42,750
Who's in that Knightmare?

805
00:50:42,833 --> 00:50:45,000
[SHIN]
Akito.

806
00:50:46,291 --> 00:50:48,416
[SHIN] I can't believe
you're still alive

807
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,958
and a Europian soldier, to boot.

808
00:50:51,041 --> 00:50:52,708
It can't be.

809
00:50:58,250 --> 00:50:59,333
[SHIN]
Exposed like this,

810
00:50:59,416 --> 00:51:01,833
even someone
like you could kill me.

811
00:51:01,916 --> 00:51:03,541
Akito.

812
00:51:12,833 --> 00:51:13,791
Brother.

813
00:51:13,875 --> 00:51:15,666
"Brother"?

814
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:17,458
[LEILA]
But how?

815
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:19,708
He's a Britannian knight.

816
00:51:20,208 --> 00:51:21,458
Hyuga?

817
00:51:24,916 --> 00:51:26,291
Akito?

818
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:28,625
[SHIN]
Now I get it.

819
00:51:28,708 --> 00:51:32,416
The gods must have allowed
you to live simply for my sake.

820
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:35,166
They must support my ambitions.

821
00:51:37,291 --> 00:51:39,375
Akito.

822
00:51:39,458 --> 00:51:41,625
I would be honored if
you took the blood oath

823
00:51:41,708 --> 00:51:43,166
with my Order of Michael

824
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:47,333
and then, offer up your life
for the creation of a new world.

825
00:51:47,416 --> 00:51:50,125
After all, Fate
brought you to me.

826
00:51:50,208 --> 00:51:53,291
Brother, you... want me?

827
00:51:53,375 --> 00:51:54,625
[SHIN]
That's correct.

828
00:51:54,708 --> 00:51:57,125
I want you... to die.

829
00:51:57,208 --> 00:51:59,416
Die for me, Akito.

830
00:52:04,791 --> 00:52:07,083
But he's... your brother!

831
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:09,541
I don't understand
why you're doing this!

832
00:52:14,041 --> 00:52:14,791
[RYO]
Hyuga!

833
00:52:14,875 --> 00:52:15,666
Fall back!

834
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:16,833
I got you covered!

835
00:52:21,208 --> 00:52:24,500
Interrupting the joyous
reunion of two brothers?

836
00:52:24,583 --> 00:52:28,250
Your squad mates should learn
some manners. Akito.

837
00:52:31,291 --> 00:52:33,583
Akito!

838
00:52:35,708 --> 00:52:37,708
[AKITO]
Watch out! Stay back!

839
00:52:38,291 --> 00:52:39,791
[JEAN]
Lord Hyuga.

840
00:52:39,875 --> 00:52:42,291
It appears the 2nd Field Army
has neglected to follow orders.

841
00:52:42,375 --> 00:52:43,708
They've redirected their forces.

842
00:52:43,791 --> 00:52:45,916
I can't believe those fools.

843
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,916
Well, Akito, you'll live today,
but I will come for you.

844
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,250
I promise, Brother.

845
00:52:56,791 --> 00:52:58,208
[JEAN]
I'll cover you, Lord Hyuga.

846
00:52:58,291 --> 00:53:01,208
[SHIN] Jean, that's
enough of your jokes.

847
00:53:24,083 --> 00:53:26,291
Akito! You alright?

848
00:53:26,375 --> 00:53:28,041
Yeah.

849
00:53:28,125 --> 00:53:28,916
That was wild.

850
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,541
You know that guy?

851
00:53:30,625 --> 00:53:34,125
I think he... he looked like...

852
00:53:34,208 --> 00:53:36,125
...my brother.

853
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:42,375
[SARA] The 242nd Regiment
has crossed the front lines.

854
00:53:42,458 --> 00:53:43,791
They're advancing!

855
00:53:43,875 --> 00:53:45,833
[CLAUS] And you're absolutely
sure about this, Sara?

856
00:53:45,916 --> 00:53:48,666
Yes, sir. The enemy
forces are retreating.

857
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:50,208
It's behind schedule,

858
00:53:50,291 --> 00:53:54,666
but Operation number 237-A17
will be completed as planned.

859
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:58,083
[CLAUS chuckles]
Well, I'll be damned.

860
00:53:58,166 --> 00:54:00,333
I can't believe we
actually pulled that off.

861
00:54:00,416 --> 00:54:02,083
[SARA] Successful
reclamation of Slonim

862
00:54:02,166 --> 00:54:04,375
into allied territory confirmed!

863
00:54:04,458 --> 00:54:05,958
[OLIVIA]
Message from Command!

864
00:54:06,041 --> 00:54:10,333
All Wyvern Squad members are
now present and accounted for!

865
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:15,833
Oh, thank goodness. Leila.

866
00:54:19,875 --> 00:54:23,166
[SOPHIE]
It was exactly as you said.

867
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:26,500
I was finally able to
confirm a BRS event.

868
00:54:26,583 --> 00:54:27,958
I wish you'd seen it.

869
00:54:28,041 --> 00:54:31,166
We're one step closer
to having proof.

870
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:35,375
We did it all thanks to you.

871
00:54:37,541 --> 00:54:40,833
Good night, my love.
Pleasant dreams.

872
00:54:46,833 --> 00:54:49,291
Hanging around with
directionless youngsters all day

873
00:54:49,375 --> 00:54:51,875
can sure drive a man to drink.

874
00:54:51,958 --> 00:54:54,333
If only I were a
few years younger.

875
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:56,458
I enjoy my job, but...

876
00:54:56,541 --> 00:54:59,125
it's gonna work me
into an early grave.

877
00:55:14,333 --> 00:55:16,541
You must be tired
from your long journey.

878
00:55:16,625 --> 00:55:19,375
I'll take you to the Guest
of State house momentarily.

879
00:55:19,458 --> 00:55:22,000
It's a pleasure to
meet you, Sir Kururugi.

880
00:55:22,083 --> 00:55:24,250
On behalf of His Highness,
Grand Duke Velaines.

881
00:55:24,333 --> 00:55:26,291
I welcome you to St. Petersburg.

882
00:55:26,375 --> 00:55:28,833
I... am Michael Augustus.

883
00:55:28,916 --> 00:55:30,458
Nice to meet you, sir.

884
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:33,291
A Knight of the Round
as his escort.

885
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:36,458
And traveling on the
Imperial Family's private train?

886
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:38,291
I must say,
that's quite a welcome.

887
00:55:38,375 --> 00:55:40,000
This man. He must be special.

888
00:55:40,083 --> 00:55:43,333
His Majesty wouldn't
do that for just anyone.

889
00:55:43,416 --> 00:55:44,625
[LELOUCH]
What is this?

890
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:49,416
[LELOUCH]
This all the welcome I get?

891
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:52,541
I'll forgive it.
This time at least.

892
00:55:52,625 --> 00:55:54,333
But next time
I come to your city,

893
00:55:54,416 --> 00:55:56,416
I want to see the
streets lined with people.

894
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:59,791
Everyone chanting my name
and cheering my victory!

895
00:56:00,916 --> 00:56:03,291
[LELOUCH] By order
of His Imperial Majesty.

896
00:56:03,375 --> 00:56:05,583
All Eastern front operational
planning will hereby

897
00:56:05,666 --> 00:56:08,291
be conducted... by me--

898
00:56:08,375 --> 00:56:11,291
Military Advisor,
Sir Julius Kingsley!

899
00:56:20,333 --> 00:56:21,958
[MALE SOLDIER 2A] I heard
that they didn't last even

900
00:56:22,041 --> 00:56:23,458
30 minutes!

901
00:56:23,541 --> 00:56:25,208
[MALE SOLDIER 2B] Really?
Man, the front lines are scary!

902
00:56:25,291 --> 00:56:26,916
[MALE SOLDIER 2C] If it were me,
I'd be cryin' like a baby!

903
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,541
[MALE SOLDIER 2C] Now the rear
lines, that's where it's at!

904
00:56:29,625 --> 00:56:31,666
[MALE SOLDIER 2B] Maybe I
should just ask for a desk job.

905
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:33,666
[MALE SOLDIER 2D]
I put in a request for leave.

906
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:35,000
[MALE SOLDIER 2E]
You're lucky, man!

907
00:56:35,083 --> 00:56:36,750
[MALE SOLDIER 2F]
I'm jealous.

908
00:56:36,833 --> 00:56:38,458
[AYANO] I swear,
these people are idiots!

909
00:56:38,541 --> 00:56:40,958
[YUKIYA] I'm not exactly sure
what you're so worked up over.

910
00:56:41,041 --> 00:56:42,458
I mean it all worked
out in the end.

911
00:56:42,541 --> 00:56:44,916
We pushed the enemy back and
the EU allies retook Slonim.

912
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,458
Is that supposed to
make me feel any better

913
00:56:46,541 --> 00:56:47,833
about risking my life?

914
00:56:47,916 --> 00:56:49,208
[YUKIYA chuckles]

915
00:56:49,291 --> 00:56:50,333
[AYANO]
What's so funny?

916
00:56:50,416 --> 00:56:51,541
Oh, nothing.

917
00:56:51,625 --> 00:56:54,000
It's just you remind me
of Akito sometimes.

918
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:01,291
His brother. Hmph.

919
00:57:05,125 --> 00:57:06,583
How'd it go, Commander?

920
00:57:06,666 --> 00:57:08,083
They're letting
us use a transport.

921
00:57:08,166 --> 00:57:10,333
We'll be heading back home
the day after tomorrow.

922
00:57:10,416 --> 00:57:11,833
[AKITO]
Really? That fast, huh?

923
00:57:11,916 --> 00:57:13,250
[LEILA]
Yeah.

924
00:57:13,333 --> 00:57:16,083
Apparently, General Smilas
had it authorized for us.

925
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:17,750
[AKITO]
Shall I escort you to your tent?

926
00:57:17,833 --> 00:57:19,083
[LEILA]
Thank you.

927
00:57:19,166 --> 00:57:21,916
Um, may I ask you something,
Lieutenant Akito?

928
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:26,333
So... that Britannian knight.

929
00:57:26,416 --> 00:57:28,875
He kept saying he's
your brother, is that true?

930
00:57:33,833 --> 00:57:36,708
[AKITO] That man's
practically a stranger to me.

931
00:57:36,791 --> 00:57:37,916
This is the first time
I've seen him

932
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,041
since we were separated
over ten years ago.

933
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:42,250
I see.

934
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:44,458
But you are brothers,
aren't you?

935
00:57:44,541 --> 00:57:46,625
Yeah, we're brothers I suppose.

936
00:57:46,708 --> 00:57:49,291
The same blood runs
through our veins.

937
00:57:49,375 --> 00:57:51,708
We share a past.

938
00:57:51,791 --> 00:57:54,000
That's why he wants to kill me,

939
00:57:54,083 --> 00:57:55,208
I guess.

940
00:57:55,291 --> 00:57:56,041
What?

941
00:57:56,125 --> 00:57:57,625
Kill you? He's your brother.

942
00:57:57,708 --> 00:57:59,541
I'm sure that you
can change his mind.

943
00:57:59,625 --> 00:58:00,791
Maybe you--

944
00:58:01,916 --> 00:58:04,375
I've already
died once, Commander.

945
00:58:04,458 --> 00:58:08,666
And that's why, this time
