2
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:23,083
[explosion]

3
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:35,958
[RYO]
Yukiya!

4
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:37,625
[RYO]
Yukiya!

5
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:38,875
[AYANO]
Ryo!

6
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:40,583
You can't help him now!

7
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:42,708
These Alexanders aren't
equipped for water.

8
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:45,291
I don't care! We can't just...

9
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:48,416
Akito.

10
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,541
And Leila.

11
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:52,583
[LEILA]
Ryo! Ayano! Come in!

12
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:55,250
What? Yukiya's inside?

13
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,500
[AKITO] I've picked up the
beacon from his machine.

14
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:02,000
Akito! Please save Yukiya!

15
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:05,166
I'm going to do
everything that I can.

16
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,833
[ANNA] Come in.
Leila. What's going on?

17
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:10,916
What just crashed into the lake?

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,541
Was it a float system's
reactor core?

19
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:15,875
[LEILA]
No time! Yukiya's in there!

20
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:18,041
[gasps] That's terrible!

21
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:19,208
[LEILA]
Help me think, Anna!

22
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:21,833
There has to be a
way to save him!

23
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:25,166
[ANNA]
Hmm. Leila. It's an Alexander.

24
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,666
Those models have
shock-absorbing balloons.

25
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,541
So if you can access Yukiya's
system and activate them,

26
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:32,458
the cockpit block will
fill with balloons,

27
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:34,750
making it buoyant
enough to float!

28
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:37,500
[LEILA] But how do we access
Yukiya's machine remotely?

29
00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:39,375
[ANNA]
If Akito uses his BRS,

30
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:42,875
it will connect his
Alexander to Yukiya's.

31
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:44,708
Akito. You heard that, right?

32
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:48,708
Activating now.
Requesting system control.

33
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:52,666
[AKITO gasping]

34
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:20,375
It came up!

35
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:22,291
It's Yukiya! We found him!

36
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,000
Bring us in closer!

37
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:25,250
You got it.

38
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:27,500
So that chick is
your CO, is she?

39
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:29,041
Yeah, she's a damn good one.

40
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:31,833
And her name's not "chick,"
it's Leila Malcal.

41
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:35,250
[ASHLEY]
Hmph. Leila it is then.

42
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,708
Oh, hey. Akito.

43
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:06,458
Don't talk. I'm gonna
get you out of here.

44
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:10,000
Heh. What's gotten into you?

45
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,208
You're not one to
talk like the hero.

46
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:14,666
No. I'm not.

47
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,583
[LEILA]
Anna, we just retrieved Yukiya,

48
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,500
but he's very seriously injured.

49
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:21,500
Please inform Dr. Randle
immediately!

50
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:22,583
Oh, no, Yukiya.

51
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,708
Captain. What's wrong?

52
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:27,083
Uh! I've got you!

53
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,500
[SARA] The wZERO Unit and
the commander's group

54
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:30,416
are coming back.

55
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,375
Tell the doctor!

56
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:32,291
I'm on it.

57
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:34,791
I'm sending her their location.

58
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:42,791
[BRONDELLO] Transport the
wounded to the garrison!

59
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:45,250
Do a head count of all
squads Knightmares!

60
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:48,333
Abandon any damaged units
where they're standing.

61
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:51,958
[DORE]
Sir Brondello!

62
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:54,833
My squad is down to
fewer than ten machines.

63
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:58,541
[SCHOLZ] Well, we're lucky
you made it out alive, Dore.

64
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,166
You fared well, Sir Scholz.

65
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,791
More than half your
squad is undamaged.

66
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,333
Yeah.

67
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:07,875
That's only because we were
at the back of the formation.

68
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:11,875
[JEAN]
What are you doing?

69
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:15,666
Grand Master Shaing never
gave the order for a retreat!

70
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,083
Two thirds of our
forces are destroyed.

71
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,666
We require time to regroup!

72
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,291
[JEAN] Did that attack turn
you all into cowards?

73
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:24,875
Of course not!

74
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:27,125
But Knights don't force their
troops into honorless battles!

75
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:28,833
Not that a rookie
upstart like you

76
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:30,333
would know anything about honor!

77
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:31,583
[JEAN growls]

78
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,208
[SHIN]
Jean.

79
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:34,458
Lord Hyuga?

80
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,083
[SHIN]
I heard everything.

81
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,833
I'd like the Three Swordmasters
to retreat for now.

82
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,625
Are you certain, sir?

83
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:42,625
[SHIN]
Yes. But don't worry,

84
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:46,291
I plan to test their mettle
as knights very soon.

85
00:04:55,541 --> 00:05:00,125
[SHIN] I'll crush them. Along
with the rest of this world.

86
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:09,250
Suzaku.

87
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:12,875
Would you...

88
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:16,708
...bring me some water, please?

89
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:18,708
[SUZAKU]
Huh?

90
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:36,833
[JULIUS groans]

91
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,375
[JULIUS]
S-Suzaku.

92
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:50,416
[gasps]

93
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:55,791
[JULIUS] I want you to
kill me... Suzaku.

94
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:57,083
[SUZAKU gasps]

95
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,750
[JULIUS coughing]

96
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:14,333
Suzaku. Please...

97
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,375
...kill me.

98
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,458
[SUZAKU]
I want to go get her.

99
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:21,208
You and me.

100
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:23,500
Let's go get Nunnally.

101
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:45,708
[MALE JUGEND 3A]
General Smilas.

102
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,416
We've received reports
that Lord Shaing

103
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,958
has taken control
of Euro Britannia.

104
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:53,333
Lord Shaing is an
Eleven, I believe.

105
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:55,541
That seems to be true, sir!

106
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:58,958
Then we'd better not
underestimate him.

107
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:12,250
[AYANO] I told you to
hurry up and jump ship.

108
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:16,208
You just had to take
your time. Freak'n Yukiya.

109
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:18,750
[DAVID] His pancreatic
artery's bleeding a lot,

110
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,458
but I think I can fix it.

111
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,833
I just hope this
connection holds out.

112
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:25,500
Would you believe this is my
first time doing telesurgery

113
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,625
on a patient in a
secret location.

114
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:30,208
You know, I wouldn't just
do this for anyone, Sophie.

115
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,583
[SOPHIE]
I appreciate your help, David.

116
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:35,041
[DAVID]
Then promise me something.

117
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,208
[SOPHIE]
What's that?

118
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:38,625
[DAVID]
When Takeru wakes up,

119
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,125
I want to be the
first person you call.

120
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:42,458
[SOPHIE gasps]

121
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:44,125
[DAVID] I don't know where
you are right now, but,

122
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:45,916
I assume he's with you.

123
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,375
Just let me know.

124
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,500
Thanks, David.
I'll do just that.

125
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,208
I promise.

126
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,958
I'll hold you to it.

127
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:57,208
As it stands,

128
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:58,958
Takeru's got way more
chess wins against me

129
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:00,875
than I've got on him.

130
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,750
I need to catch up.

131
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,916
Tell him to wake
his ass up, Sophie.

132
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,125
Even if it takes a miracle.

133
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:12,541
[LEILA]
Yukiya's surgery was successful.

134
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:13,750
[CLAUS]
Thanks to him,

135
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:16,666
we wiped out two thirds
of the enemy forces.

136
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,125
They've still got the advantage

137
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,666
when it comes to
numbers, though.

138
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,000
Then I'll have Major Hammel's
security team pilot

139
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:23,791
Alexanders as well.

140
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:27,375
[CLAUS] Well, Hammel's team is
just supposed to be support.

141
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,166
[beeping]

142
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,750
Anyway, looks like I just got

143
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:33,541
the most recent data
from Captain Clement.

144
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,250
How many drones will we have?

145
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,625
We're gonna have
ten at the most.

146
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:38,791
The bulk of our parts

147
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:41,375
went into the Alexanders
for Hammel's team.

148
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:44,125
[LEILA] And do we still have
the Alexander I used before?

149
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:46,916
[CLAUS]
Major Hammel got that one.

150
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,500
[LEILA]
Oh, I see.

151
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:51,208
You've got a Knightmare
for me though, right?

152
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:54,083
You're going to need my
help to win this thing.

153
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,291
We're up against the
Holy Order of Michael.

154
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:58,000
You used to be on their side.

155
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:01,750
Well, that was before
Shaing tried to do me in.

156
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:05,166
And besides. I owe Akito one.

157
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:10,833
[ASHLEY]
Heh.

158
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:14,416
[ASHLEY]
Hey, Pops! Give me some!

159
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:18,041
Well, help yourself...

160
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,208
All right.

161
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:22,708
I'll let you pilot one
of the Alexanders.

162
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:25,833
That's a great plan,
Commander. Smart move.

163
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:29,958
Yeah, you sure know what
you're doing, Leila.

164
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:32,333
[CHLOE] It's a good thing we
got that Knightmare data

165
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,500
from that boy with the red hair.

166
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,166
Right, Sergeant Hilda?

167
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,583
[HILDA]
Yeah. I think I caught his name.

168
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,541
It's Ashley.

169
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,583
That's why we're using
the Schrötter Steel.

170
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,333
This'll be much better.

171
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:47,625
Altering those designs has been
rough on the boss though.

172
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:48,875
[CHLOE]
Yeah, she had to completely

173
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,583
rework the new
Alexander model,

174
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:53,333
and the upgraded
model for Akito.

175
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:56,958
She's really talented, huh?

176
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:58,375
She sure is.

177
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:01,208
Military-use robotics
are just the beginning

178
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:03,250
of what she can do.

179
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:14,208
[MECHANIC 5A] Do we have
any spare elbow motors?

180
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:15,250
This one's fried!

00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:16,500
[MECHANIC 5B]
We're all out.

182
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,666
Grab one from the spare units.

183
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,750
[MECHANIC 5C]
Yeesh.

184
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,666
It's hard to work
without supplies.

185
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,916
[MECHANIC 5D]
No choice.

186
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,625
We'll just have to make
do with what we've got.

187
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,375
[sighs] Lord Hyuga.

Hey.

[JEAN]
A-Ashley?

193
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,250
And in their uniform no less.

194
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,750
[ASHLEY] Just hear me out
before you up and kill me.

195
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,000
[JEAN]
Why should I?

196
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,666
[ASHLEY] You and I are
a lot alike, you know.

197
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,083
We were orphans.

198
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:57,416
All alone in the world and
knocking on death's door.

199
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,791
Until Shaing took us in.

200
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,125
So we owe him our li--

201
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:03,375
He's different than
he used to be.

202
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:07,541
I don't know why.
All he wants is bloodshed.

203
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,125
It's like he's possessed.

204
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:11,416
[gasps]

205
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,916
[ASHLEY]
Despite all that,

206
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,916
I got a buddy who wants to save
the bastard from himself.

207
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,083
Since they're brothers...

208
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:24,000
Akito... Hyuga.

209
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,000
[ASHLEY]
Jean. Er...

210
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:29,916
Wait, you went by Jeanne
before he found you, right?

211
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,875
Well, Jeanne, I think we
oughtta help them out.

212
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:38,708
'Cause if anybody can
bring Shin Hyuga back,

213
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,708
it's Akito.

[wolves howling]

00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:31,583

Godspeed, friend.
We're behind you.

[KNIGHT 5A]
No good! We can't puncture it!

222
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,500
Then we need to push forward
with the Canterbury!

223
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:16,833
[KNIGHT 5A]
Yes, sir!

We still don't have a visual?

We're taking fire from the wall!

Don't back down!

Is this your idea of honor?

I must say I'm disappointed,

By the time we can
attack the castle,

00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,625
we might not have

[RYO] Ashley! C'mon,
you're way too close!

320
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:00,666
Brother!

321
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:04,375
I don't know why you
insist on fighting!

322
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:07,041
[SHIN]
Because ending this cruel world,

323
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:10,541
is all that I care
about! That's it!

324
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:14,333
[SHIN]
Time's up, Akito.

325
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:18,583
Forsake this mortal coil. Die!

326
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:22,708
They're still fighting
in sector A23!

327
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:25,208
Akito, Ryo, and Ashley
are running at full power.

328
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,416
I just hope they don't overload.

329
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,583
[AKITO]
Commander.

330
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:37,375
I need a favor.

331
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:40,125
Could you hold onto this?

332
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:41,625
[LEILA]
Akito.

333
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,833
[AKITO]
If I get killed,

334
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:49,916
and there's nothing left
of my body, bury it.

335
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,500
[LEILA]
You'd better...

336
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,000
...make sure you come back.

337
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:56,166
[AKITO gasps]

338
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,958
Because I...

339
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,541
I have some things I
want to say to you,

340
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:04,583
but now's not the time.

341
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:06,416
So...

342
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,541
I want you to promise me Akito.

343
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:11,916
Promise me that you'll come
back safe with the others.

344
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,250
[SARA]
Order of Michael Knightmare!

345
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,041
They are breaching the gate!

346
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:19,833
Defensive maneuvers. Hurry!

347
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:24,875
Akito! They're coming!

348
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:27,791
You little...

[AKITO]
Ashley.

350
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:29,333
[ASHLEY]
Uh.

351
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:31,208
Fall back to sector 18.

352
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,083
If you say so.

353
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:46,166
[KNIGHT 5C]
We've reached the middle gate!

354
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,208
[KNIGHT 5E]
The Platoon's goin' in.

355
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:50,916
They let us push
them back so easily.

356
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,833
[gasps] No, wait!

[YUKIYA]
A-Ayano. Hey.

362
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:09,791
[AYANO]
Yukiya!

363
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:11,208
Wait, what? Where am I--

364
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:13,541
[AYANO] Yukiya!
Oh my god, you're okay!

365
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:16,125
[YUKIYA groaning]

366
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:17,833
[AYANO]
Oh, sorry!

367
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:19,666
[YUKIYA]
It's fine. How long...

368
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,583
Have I been under for?

369
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:24,458
Six days. Seven, counting today.

370
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:28,208
That's crazy. It's
been a whole week?

371
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:30,041
What about...

372
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:32,250
[gasps] Oh, no.

373
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:33,250
[AYANO]
Yukiya, wait!

374
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:34,583
You're not supposed to get up!

375
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:37,583
I have to. I have to talk
to Leila right now!

376
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:38,666
[AYANO]
Uh?

377
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,916
Mariko and Shinji
told me something.

378
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,333
It's all up to us. Only
we can save the world!

379
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:46,125
[AYANO gasps]

380
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:48,458
[SARA]
Explosion in sector 23!

381
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:50,333
Enemy Knightmare
squad eliminated!

382
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:53,750
[OLIVIA] There's another squad
on the sector 4 castle wall!

383
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,125
[KNIGHT 5C] Changed ammo
to cluster warheads.

384
00:22:58,208 --> 00:22:59,125
Loading is complete!

385
00:22:59,208 --> 00:23:00,875
We've got the target in sight!

386
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:07,375
[gasps] Take cover! Hurry!

387
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:16,208
[OLIVIA] Sector 25's been hit!
They're firing at us!

388
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:18,333
[AYANO]
Leila, do you copy?

389
00:23:18,416 --> 00:23:19,583
[LEILA]
Ayano?

390
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:21,750
Yukiya and I need our
machines prepped now.

391
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,791
Wait did you say Yukiya's
with you? Is he--?

392
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:24,750
[YUKIYA]
I'm fine.

393
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:25,791
[gasps]

394
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:33,541
[YUKIYA]
Leila. After all this time,

395
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:35,333
I finally get it.

396
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:37,458
Me hating this world
is never gonna change

397
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,625
anything for the better.

398
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:45,500
[YUKIYA]
So if it'll help my friends,

399
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:49,791
I might as well...
love the world.

400
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,250
[HAMMEL]
They're here!

401
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:01,375
Stay calm! We're not letting
go of this position!

402
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:09,166
The enemy forces have
just entered sector 13!

403
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,791
They're coming over
the northwest wall!

404
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:18,875
All we want is their commander!

405
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:22,750
Fire MPA cannon!

406
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:30,458
Take out that artillary!

407
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:52,125
[gasps]

408
00:24:56,666 --> 00:24:58,250
[BRONDELLO groans]

409
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:12,250
[OLIVIA] They're gathering
at the control tower.

410
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:13,000
Olivia.

411
00:25:13,083 --> 00:25:14,500
I'm ready.

412
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:19,375
We're the only ones who know
how to use these things.

413
00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:21,166
[OLIVIA]
Hope we don't have to.

[JEAN]
Lord Hyuga,

415
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:26,750
I've just finished rewriting
the transport's flight program

416
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:28,875
at the launch site.

417
00:25:28,958 --> 00:25:31,833
[SHIN] Good. Launch it
as soon as it's ready.

418
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:37,958
[SHIN]
Jean.

419
00:25:38,041 --> 00:25:40,000
It won't be long now.

420
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:43,500
Everything... will be wiped out.

421
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,416
Yes, Lord Hyuga.

422
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:53,541
[AYANO] Freeze! One wrong move
and it'll be your last!

423
00:25:53,625 --> 00:25:55,125
There's nowhere to run.

424
00:25:55,208 --> 00:25:57,791
Nobody has to get hurt.
We can talk.

425
00:26:05,375 --> 00:26:06,958
No way.

426
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:18,541
I've heard of you.

427
00:26:18,625 --> 00:26:21,333
You're the lady knight
Ashley told us about.

428
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:26,291
[AYANO]
He told us the whole story.

429
00:26:26,375 --> 00:26:28,791
[JEAN] Stop talking and
get down on the ground.

430
00:26:28,875 --> 00:26:32,041
You're getting ready
to blow up Pendragon.

431
00:26:32,125 --> 00:26:34,541
The whole world's
gonna be torn apart.

432
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:36,625
Is that really okay with you?

433
00:26:36,708 --> 00:26:39,500
[grunts] I told you to
get on the ground!

434
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:41,458
[AYANO]
I know what it feels like.

435
00:26:41,541 --> 00:26:45,291
To want to do everything
the person you love says.

436
00:26:46,458 --> 00:26:50,291
But listen. That's not
what love's about.

437
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:52,208
Stay away!

438
00:26:55,083 --> 00:26:57,583
Being in love with someone means
doing what's best for them.

439
00:26:57,666 --> 00:26:59,875
[JEAN]
Silence!

440
00:26:59,958 --> 00:27:01,750
Not just doing what they wan--

[groans]

442
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:06,791
That's not how you show
someone that you care.

443
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,250
How I feel is irrelevant to me.

444
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:14,000
The only thing that matters now
is Lord Hyuga's objective!

445
00:27:14,083 --> 00:27:17,541
I'm going to make it come true!

446
00:27:17,625 --> 00:27:20,708
Even if you obey his every word,

447
00:27:20,791 --> 00:27:23,083
it won't be enough to
make him love you back.

[gasps]

449
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,041
If that's true...

450
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:42,875
...then what should I do now?

451
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:55,875
Got you.

452
00:28:00,666 --> 00:28:02,416
[ALL gasping]

Don't panic!

Stop this now!

I don't think so.

Lieutenant Naruse?

00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:50,750
The best way to handle a bully

Nope. I'm not seeing any

There's an anomaly
in the BRS values.

Oh, no! I can't track

It might be a Penrose effect.

529

What's the correlation
of the brainwaves

531

[JOE] You're asking for a
comparison of mental

533
00:32:16,458 --> 00:32:17,625
[SOPHIE]
Yes.

534
00:32:17,708 --> 00:32:19,500
The coordinates are
obviously scrambling

535
00:32:19,583 --> 00:32:22,083
because of this anomaly
with the brainwaves.

536
00:32:22,166 --> 00:32:24,708
If I understand correctly,
you're saying that

537
00:32:24,791 --> 00:32:27,583
a human mind is affecting
the physical world?

538
00:32:27,666 --> 00:32:29,791
[SOPHIE]
Perhaps. Easy to forget,

539
00:32:29,875 --> 00:32:31,875
but the world around
us is only concrete

540
00:32:31,958 --> 00:32:34,041
because we're here
to observe it.

541
00:32:34,125 --> 00:32:36,458
The intersecting brainwaves
of multiple people

542
00:32:36,541 --> 00:32:39,250
allows us to create an
observer much more powerful

543
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:41,708
than any one human being.

544
00:32:43,083 --> 00:32:45,416
After all, our universe
is constructed

545
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,583
from the billions of
brains observing it.

546
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:50,333
Which are products
of the universe.

547
00:32:50,416 --> 00:32:51,875
As Nietzsche once said,

Never-ending cycles

00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,791
A fragment?

639
00:38:26,875 --> 00:38:28,000
Of the Geass,

640
00:38:28,083 --> 00:38:30,875
which I've come to think
is beyond your kind.

641
00:38:30,958 --> 00:38:34,666
Perhaps we should remove
it from your world.

642
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:36,250
[LEILA]
Geass?

643
00:38:38,041 --> 00:38:40,000
You know, in the
beginning I thought

644
00:38:40,083 --> 00:38:43,958
humans weren't all that
special as a species.

645
00:38:44,041 --> 00:38:47,958
I thought you couldn't and
didn't deserve to use the Geass.

646
00:38:48,041 --> 00:38:50,125
That you ought to go extinct.

647
00:38:50,208 --> 00:38:51,750
[LEILA]
Please, wait!

648
00:38:53,583 --> 00:38:56,250
[CARETAKER] But given
the way things turned out,

649
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:59,291
perhaps you can prove me wrong.

650
00:39:02,916 --> 00:39:06,125
Assuming you can stop that
man and his corrupt Geass,

651
00:39:06,208 --> 00:39:07,583
of course.

653
00:39:14,125 --> 00:39:15,958

00:39:26,458 --> 00:39:29,791
Right. It's already recording!

we can't destroy the door!

[OLIVIA]
They're inside the corridor!

672

the gas to wipe them out?

673
00:39:57,458 --> 00:39:58,833
Not yet!

674
00:39:58,916 --> 00:40:00,916
Open up a channel
to the outside.

675

I'll talk to their leader.

Come on. Snap out of it!

[LEILA] We would like
to request a cease-fire.

679
00:40:47,166 --> 00:40:50,416
We have no desire to
fight you any longer.

680
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,666
A woman?

681
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:54,083
[LEILA]
This is Leila Breisgau.

682
00:40:54,166 --> 00:40:56,208
The Commander of this base.

[AKITO]
Commander.

684

[LEILA]
Uh?

685
00:40:59,208 --> 00:41:01,125
[AKITO]
I know this beautiful painting,

686
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:04,291
of a woman with an angel.

687
00:41:04,375 --> 00:41:09,208
The woman in the picture
looks a lot like you.

688
00:41:09,291 --> 00:41:11,416
This is the one.

689
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:16,958
It must have been hanging
in the house I grew up in.

690
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:20,833
Did you like this painting
when you were a child?

691
00:41:20,916 --> 00:41:23,250
I don't know.

692
00:41:23,333 --> 00:41:29,375
But I do like the expression
on the lady's face.

693
00:41:29,458 --> 00:41:32,000
She looks so kind.

down the command center.

Hey! You're pretty tough.
I was hoping for a challenge!

Oh, Mother.

I'm going to miss you.

Listen. I'm so sorry.

But at least now, you'll
never get hurt again.

Akito. You're not
supposed to be alive.

gonna solve anything!

Of course not.

That said,

I don't think that killing is
the answer to your fears.

we don't doubt that you did
this out of your love for us.

00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,291
But still. It seems your
methods are misguided.

This world is full
of possibilities.

There must be a better way.

She clearly believes it.

There is no other way.
Not in this world!

So he means that much
to you, does he?

If you loved me, you would
have killed him at birth!

00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:34,000
I don't want you...
to suffer any longer.

[SHIN] How could you
possibly understand, Jean?

803
00:50:39,458 --> 00:50:44,583
I-I love you, Lord Hyuga.

804

[SHIN]
Stupid woman.

806
00:51:02,333 --> 00:51:04,500

Just like my mother.

Look what you've done.

[AKITO]
No! I won't!

00:51:21,625 --> 00:51:22,625
I won't.

Big brother!

Go away!

Come back, Shin.
Let's go home.

819
00:51:43,791 --> 00:51:45,666
Get lost!

Stop crying.

[crying continues]

823
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:05,291
I said stop!

824
00:52:09,166 --> 00:52:11,625
[SHIN]
Come on. Climb on my back.

825
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:21,333
[AKITO]
Thank you.

826

No more crying Akito, okay?

827

I love you, Shin.

Are you...?

832
00:52:58,958 --> 00:53:01,625
[SHIN]
You can let go. You won't be...

833
00:53:01,708 --> 00:53:04,416
...alone when I'm gone.

834
00:53:06,083 --> 00:53:11,000
[SHIN] This world may be
cruel, but... [groaning]

00:53:11,083 --> 00:53:14,166
I want you to live.

[SHIN]
I'm here.

[JEAN]
Shin! I've missed you so!

841
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,791
[SHIN]
I'm so sorry, Jeanne.

842
00:53:33,875 --> 00:53:36,708
We're together now. For good.

843

I'm glad, Shin.

[LEILA]
Akito.

845

[FEMALE JUGEND 3A] Enemy units
have emerged from the pillbox.

00:54:43,583 --> 00:54:44,916
[MALE JUGEND 3A]
It seems they'd rather die

847
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,250
than surrender.

848
00:54:46,333 --> 00:54:48,458
Yes, so it seems.

Uh!

Uhh! That was quite a ride.

That sounds like... Could it be?

852
00:55:16,875 --> 00:55:18,916
I would know that red
Knightmare anywhere!

Master Ashley!

854

Is that you?

855
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:23,250
We've waited so long!

Take them down!

[CARETAKER] He's willing to face
anything for his comrades.

You should be more
like him, Gene Smilas.

[ALL screaming]

[ANCHOR 5A]
The death of General Smilas

868
00:56:09,166 --> 00:56:13,833
marks the end of Europia's
experiment in dictatorship.

869
00:56:13,916 --> 00:56:15,916
Now, once again,

870
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Europia will be a republic
of and by the people.

871
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:24,875
[FARNESE] The rebellion by
the Holy Order of Michael

872
00:56:24,958 --> 00:56:28,666
gave the homeland the excuse
they needed to intervene.

873
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:31,416
I'm very sorry, Your Highness.

874
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:34,666
[VELAINES] It is quite a shame.
Tell me, Lord Farnese.

[gasps]

00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:36,791
The Europian commander

877
00:56:36,875 --> 00:56:38,666
who sent in the
Ghost of Hannibal.

878
00:56:38,750 --> 00:56:41,708
Do you have any information
regarding this person?

879
00:56:41,791 --> 00:56:45,041
[FARNESE] I only know that her
name was Leila Breisgau, sir.

880
00:56:45,125 --> 00:56:46,541
[VELAINES]
Just as I thought.

881
00:56:46,625 --> 00:56:48,958
It's come to my attention that
the castle Shaing attacked

882
00:56:49,041 --> 00:56:51,166
happened to belong
to the Breisgau family

883
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:54,916
before the revolution 300
years ago. Quite interesting.

884
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,791
We'll be mindful of the
Briesgau name going forward.

885
00:56:57,875 --> 00:57:01,291
[VELAINES] Indeed. We can
only hope that someday

the Breisgau line
