00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:21,083
[LEILA]
Revolutionary year 228.

2
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:23,166
Seven years ago,
Japan was conquered

3
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,458
by the Holy Britannian Empire
and renamed Area 11.

4
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:30,000
In Europe, the United
Republic of Europia

5
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:33,041
remained resistant
against Britannia.

6
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:36,458
Leila entered battle
with Akito and the others.

7
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:40,625
During the fight, they
encountered a golden Knightmare

8
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:43,875
operated by Shin Hyuga Shaing.

9
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:45,958
Shaing is Akito's older brother,

10
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:48,708
whom he had not seen
since childhood.

11
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:58,875
[footsteps]

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,291
Why don't you kneel?!

13
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:21,958
Show some respect,
Lord Kingsley.

14
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:23,291
You should be kneeling!

15
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:26,208
I've been granted his
Majesty's full authority.

16
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:28,166
But don't take my word.

17
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:36,125
The imperial scepter!

18
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:38,416
You get it. From now on,

19
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,875
you will obey me as
you do the Emperor.

20
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:43,000
My word is law.

21
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:48,750
[CLAUS]
Sheesh, it's cold!

22
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:49,958
Lucky for me,

23
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:52,833
I've got a little booze
to warm up my bones.

24
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:00,625
[ANNA]
Eliza!

25
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:03,166
Here, kitty!

26
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,875
It's time for lunch;
I hope you're hungry!

27
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:14,791
Eliza! Come get
your yummies girl.

28
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:16,291
Kitty?

29
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:21,833
C'mon. You've just gotta
get used to me.

30
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:23,541
Don't be shy.

31
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,625
[ANNA sighs]

32
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:31,666
[ANNA] I'm trying, but
she won't warm up to me.

33
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:35,958
[ANNA]
Leila...

34
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,625
[AYANO] Ugh, we've been
stuck here for a month!

35
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:55,916
[LEILA] I've been contacting
HQ every day, but...

36
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:59,750
...they can't seem to
arrange for transport.

37
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:04,250
[AYANO] But this place is
a dump, I'm sick of it!

38
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:05,500
And the people are so--

39
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:06,791
[SOLDIER 3A]
Check it out.

40
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:08,875
You're Eleven soldiers, right?

41
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:10,083
Ha, ha, ha!

42
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:11,083
[SOLDIER 3B]
I'm so happy you guys are here.

43
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:12,833
To take the bullets for us!

44
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:14,125
[SOLDIER 3C]
Yeah, that's about all

45
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:16,041
Elevens are good for, anyway.

46
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:19,666
[SOLDIERS laugh]

47
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,708
[SOLDIER 3D]
Right, the supply trailer.

48
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:24,125
[SOLDIER 3E]
We've copied the supply sheet.

49
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,500
[SOLDIER 3AA] We still need
the C.O.'s signature.

50
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:29,208
[ANOU] This request form
isn't formatted right!

51
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:32,541
So I'm denying your
request! Moron!

52
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:34,833
That Lieutenant
Colonel. So mean.

53
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:35,916
Don't let him hear you!

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,208
[ANOU]
What are you, deaf? Fix it now!

55
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:41,333
And save your smart-aleck
remarks for your own time!

56
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:43,250
Hm? My name?

57
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,625
Ohh, you wanna know my name?

58
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:48,333
Is that supposed to scare me?

59
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:53,916
I am Lieutenant Colonel Pierre
Anou of the Supply Corps!

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,416
What a punk. Those supplies are
gonna get "lost in transit."

61
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,875
All right, look alive, boys!
I want everybody busy!

62
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:05,500
I'm surrounded by idiots...

63
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:07,583
[ANOU]
Huh?!

64
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,666
Wait a minute!

65
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,041
You don't have it in you.

66
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,500
[ANOU]
What?!

67
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,208
[ANOU]
Well, what do you know?

68
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:22,000
Looks like it's time
for a little payback,

69
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,208
Ms. Leila Malcal!

70
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,416
[SOLDIER 3G]
Aye, who knew bein' a soldier

71
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,833
would be such a pain in the ass!

72
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,458
[SOLDIER 3H]
Yeah, I'm sick of this crap.

73
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:32,000
[SOLDIER 3I]
Eh, quit whining.

74
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,166
[AYANO] What's the point
of coming to the bazaar

75
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,416
if we're broke?

76
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,666
[LEILA] My ID has a
credit function on it.

77
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,333
[RYO]
Oh, yeah, how much you got?

78
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:43,791
[LEILA]
About a million Euros?

79
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:46,666
[AYANO, RYO, YUKIYA]
What?! A million?

80
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,875
[AYANO]
Sweet! Let's eat a proper meal!

81
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:50,291
[RYO]
Hell, yeah!

82
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,916
[YUKIYA] Gee. Must be nice
to have that kinda moolah.

83
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,458
[AYANO]
Oh, wow! These are incredible!

84
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:59,500
They're all so gorgeous!
Ooh, I want one!

85
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,458
Please, Leila? Come on. Please?

86
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:05,166
[LEILA] U-Uh. Um, I suppose
we could buy a few.

87
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,541
The army still hasn't reissued
us uniforms, after all--

88
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,000
[AYANO]
Over here!

89
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:10,083
[LEILA]
Uh!

90
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,833
Ah! Now this one's quite lovely.

91
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:15,208
Hey, this would look
pretty on you, Yukiya.

92
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:16,875
Probably better than
it would on you.

93
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:17,666
[AYANO growls]

94
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,500
[RYO]
Hm...

95
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,958
I dunno. This one's
got a weird face.

96
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,500
Cut me a deal?

97
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:25,916
[GRANNY 3A]
You poor thing.

98
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,958
[gasps]

99
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,208
I pity you, young man.

100
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,833
[AYANO]
Are you serious?

101
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,541
No. Your machine must be broken!

102
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,083
I checked it twice, guys.

103
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:40,041
I can try one more
time if you want.

104
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,500
Sorry. But your
credit's no good.

105
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:44,416
How can that be?

106
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:47,666
[LEILA]
Uh!

107
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,291
You'll have to come
back with cash.

108
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:50,875
[AYANO]
Hey, don't be rude!

109
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:53,666
Something fishy's going on here.

110
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:00,666
[LEILA]
Uh!

111
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,041
[GUARD 3A]
Oops. Code error.

112
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,958
Looks like the registration
on that thing is blank.

113
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,000
No entry without proper ID.

114
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:08,000
But you checked it when
we left here earlier.

115
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,208
Don't you remember us?!

116
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:12,625
Jeez, how stupid can one guy be?

117
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:15,791
[GUARD 3A] Sorry, miss,
I don't make the rules.

118
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,333
Civilians have to get clearance

119
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:19,166
through the Public
Relations Department.

120
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,125
[RYO] You know damn
well we're not civilians!

121
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:30,541
[RYO] Asshole. That guy's
lucky he was behind glass.

122
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:33,416
[LEILA] Violence isn't the
answer, Officer Sayama.

123
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,541
[RYO] You sayin' that
guy didn't piss you off?

124
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:36,958
[LEILA]
It doesn't matter.

125
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:39,791
The military's regulations have
to be upheld regardless.

126
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:42,166
[AYANO] I think that guy
was just screwing with us.

127
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,250
That's possible.

128
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,041
[GRANNY 3A]
Poor thing.

129
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,083
[AKITO gasping]

130
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:51,833
[LEILA]
Oh, dear.

131
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:56,250
Poor cursed little child.

132
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,500
[AKITO]
Let go.

133
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,708
[GRANNY 3A] Oh, the curse
you have upon you

134
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:01,250
is terrible indeed.

135
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:09,166
But if you like,
I can lift it for you.

136
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,875
[GRANNY 3A laughs]

137
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:13,875
--[AKITO] No!
--[GRANNY 3A groans]

138
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,875
[RYO]
Whoa dude, calm down.

139
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:17,875
[GRANNY 3A] My knee!
He broke my knee!

140
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:20,625
[GRANNY 3C] Her leg is banged
up. She can't walk!

141
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,625
[LEILA]
Are you all right?!

142
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,416
[GRANNY 3B]
She's in such poor health!

143
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,875
Even a scratch could kill her!

144
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,208
We don't have enough money

145
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:29,500
to take our poor, sick
friend to a doctor.

146
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:33,083
If only we could afford medicine
for our dying friend here.

147
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,583
You tryin' to shake
us down? Huh?

148
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:36,625
[LEILA gasps]

149
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,916
[GRANNY 3B]
How dare you accuse us?

150
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,958
Kids these days
have no respect.

151
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:43,208
[GRANNY 3B] You're the
ones who assaulted us!

152
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,083
I see a light. Goodbye.

153
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:47,916
She's at death's door!
It's all over!

154
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,625
We're sorry for the
misunderstanding.

155
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:52,125
Misunderstanding is right.

156
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:54,958
Sorry ladies, but we can't even
afford a place to sleep.

157
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,541
We are just as broke as you are.

158
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:59,333
[GRANNY 3A]
You're what?!

159
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:01,041
What is the meaning of this?

160
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:02,333
Turns out they're broke.

161
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:03,875
All that for nothing?

162
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:07,416
Well, there is another way
you can pay us back.

163
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,166
[GRANNIES laughing]

164
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,958
[GRANNY 3B] Nothing like a glass
of wine after a hard day's work!

165
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:17,500
[GRANNY 3E] Sure is nice to
have these cute young servants!

166
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,416
[GRANNIES laughing]

167
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,083
[GRANNY 3C] But those outfits
of theirs are so indecent!

168
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:24,416
[GRANNY 3G]
My goodness!

169
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,041
[GRANNY 3C] I think I
might have a heart attack.

170
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,541
[GRANNY 3D]
You know you like it!

171
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,291
[GRANNIES laughing]

172
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,291
I thought old ladies were sweet.

173
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,291
In my experience, not so much.

174
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,416
So much for being at
death's door, huh?

175
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,458
I'm sorry to rush off,
but we really should be--

176
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:38,708
[GRANNY 3C]
Trying to run?

177
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:39,666
[LEILA]
Uh!

178
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,083
Uh, no, that's not what I--

179
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:44,208
Good. Then hurry up and get
your working clothes on.

180
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:45,833
[AYANO]
Hey, what are you doing?

181
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:48,375
[GRANNY 3E]
Hold still!

182
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:49,708
[GRANNIES laughing]

183
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:51,416
Stop looking!

184
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,041
[GRANNY 3G] You've have
beautiful skin, dear.

185
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:56,333
[LEILA]
Oh. Thank you very much.

186
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:59,416
[GRANNY 3G] Takes me back to
when we were young and sexy.

187
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,958
[GRANNIES chattering]

188
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:09,291
I'm not sure this fits right.

189
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,666
It looks gorgeous on you!

190
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,666
Almost as good as me
when I was your age.

191
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,916
[LEILA]
Oh...

192
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,250
[AYANO] Ugh! Hate this
stupid outfit! So musty.

193
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:20,500
[GRANNY 3G]
Well, that's 'cause I haven't

194
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,958
taken them out in 50 years!

195
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:27,166
[RYO]
Dammit. Crazy old bats.

196

[RYO yelling]

197
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,166
[GRANNY 3E]
You could bounce a coin off it.

198
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,875
[RYO]
Hands off, grandma!

199
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,208
[YUKIYA]
So, are you sure this isn't

200
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:36,916
one of the ladies' outfits?

201
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,083
You look so pretty.

202
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,666
[GRANNY 3D]
Oh, come on.

203
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,041
You better put some pep in your
step if you want to eat tonight.

204
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,458
Not fair! This is a
job for two people!

205
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:47,583
[GRANNY 3D]
Then get yourself a helper.

206
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:50,791
[AYANO]
Leila! Leila!

207
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,958
Where'd she run off to?

208
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:57,541
[GRANNY 3F]
Young man.

209
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,041
Akito, was it?

210
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,208
[AKITO]
Yes ma'am?

211
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:01,416
[GRANNY 3F]
Take those buckets

212
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,583
and fetch some water
from the river for me.

213
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:09,291
[LEILA] Wait, Lieutenant!
Let me do that instead.

214
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,708
I can handle it.

215
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:12,208
I just...

216
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:15,708
You should find a job you're
more suited for, Commander.

217
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,041
I think I did that right.

218
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,041
[AYANO]
You done, Leila? Uh!

219
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,291
[LEILA]
Oh? It's no good?

220
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:30,208
You sure know
what you're doing.

221
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:33,333
Well, when I was a kid, it was
learn to cook or go hungry.

222
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:37,166
[laughs] What a
good boy you are.

223
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,708
[AYANO]
Okay, pasta's ready.

Uh?!

00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:41,458
[AYANO]
Great.

227
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:46,083

Oh, no.

Ayano?

229
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:50,583
[AYANO] Uh! That's okay, I don't
need help with the food!

230
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:54,250
[GRANNY 3E] Akito, be a dear
and fetch the wine for me.

[AKITO]
Is it in the cart?

232

[GRANNY 3E] Yes, thank you.

Leave it to me!

drink this much?

Those are kinda heavy.

Stop.

It's fine, I can manage it.

Well, if you insist.

to disappear! What if...?

Stay positive, boss!
She'll be all right.

246
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,666
Yeah Anna, she sent a report
from the Warsaw garrison.

247
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,291
I'm sure there's nothing
to worry about.

[CLAUS]
I know that, Major Hammel.

249

But still. She's a grown
woman, you know.

250
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:35,916
[HAMMEL] There's been no word
from Commander Malcal

251

for three days,
Deputy Commander!

252
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:41,041
At this point, we have
cause for concern!

253
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,833
[CLAUS]
Yeah, maybe.

254
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:45,333
But we can't do anything
about it from here.

255
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:49,500
[HAMMEL] We can at least file
a search request. Please, sir.

bad I am at basic chores.

care of themselves as kids.

find that comforting?

Really? Those skills
seem pretty important.

Things that every adult
should know how to do.

We can have freedom,

317
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:22,833
but it won't be handed to us!

And of course, the answer
doesn't lie with policymakers.

Those who have obtained

00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:23,375
[AYANO]
Yup! Sure were.

470
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:28,833
At least that's what
I've been told.

471
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:31,458
So, were you born in Europe?

472
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:34,208
I was. How 'bout you?

473
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:36,625
Yeah, I was actually.

474
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:39,166
[AYANO]
Ryo and Yukiya too.

475
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:45,416
[AYANO] I'd love to
go to Japan one day.

476
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,291
All of us.

477
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:50,958
Commander Malcal gave me this.

478
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:52,166
[AYANO]
Uh?

479
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,833
She said that after
the mission was over,

480
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:55,166
to give this back to you.

481
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,916
That's weird. Why you?

482
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,791
She thinks I'm the
soldier in our squadron

483
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:01,375
with the best chance of
surviving this operation.

484
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:02,625
Oh...

485
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:04,708
It was a wise choice
on her part,

486
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:06,750
but it's not like I'd let my
commanding officer

487
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:08,791
get killed anyway.

488
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:12,125
You should hold onto it.

489
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:13,208
[AKITO]
Huh?

490
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:15,666
That things supposedly
kind of magical.

491
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,166
It's supposed to ward
off evil and stuff.

492
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,333
Then maybe you should--

493
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:21,375
No, I want you to keep it.

494
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:23,916
It's not like I'm gonna go
and get myself killed.

495
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,041
I'm more the type to run away
when things get rough.

496
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:29,750
[GRANNY 3C]
What a clever boy you are!

497
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:31,500
[GRANNY 3B]
That's our Yukiya!

498
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:33,125
[YUKIYA]
Our IDs got erased.

499
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:36,250
Looks to me like someone decided
to break into the army server.

500
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:37,333
[LEILA]
Like a hacker?

501
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,333
Nah, hackers have to be smart.

502
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:41,500
This joker's not even
covering their tracks.

503
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:43,041
The work of an idiot.

504
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:46,416
So... Did you get our ID data
back or is it lost for good?

505
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,958
[YUKIYA]
I got it.

506
00:23:48,041 --> 00:23:51,166
That kind of illegal tampering
isn't too difficult to undo.

507
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:54,541
[ANOU] Dammit. Who builds
a military base so far--

508
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:56,458
[YUKIYA] Someone oughta
teach him a lesson.

509
00:23:56,541 --> 00:23:58,958
So I decided to leave
him a little gift.

510
00:23:59,041 --> 00:24:00,416
[AYANO, LEILA, RYO]
Hm?

511
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:03,458
[GUARD 3A] Your registration
data's not on file.

512
00:24:03,541 --> 00:24:05,916
[ANOU growls]

513
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,291
But you waved to me
when I left earlier!

514
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:12,333
[GUARD 3A] Civilians need to
contact Public Relations.

515
00:24:12,416 --> 00:24:14,791
[ANOU]
Kiss my ass!

516
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:20,291
[GRANNY 3A] You're really
planning to leave us so soon?

517
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,916
[GRANNY 3B]
We'll miss you kids so much!

518
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,458
We'll miss you, too.

519
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:27,375
Thank you so much for
opening your home to us.

520
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:28,916
And putting us to work.

521
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Yeah, I'm sure they'll look
back on our free labor fondly.

522
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:32,208
Please, grannies!

523
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:34,416
Don't you dare go senile
and forget me, okay?

524
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,208
[GRANNY 3F]
Don't worry, dear.

525
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:37,791
[GRANNY 3D]
That body's unforgettable.

526
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:39,750
[GRANNY 3C] As if we could
forget that tight posterior!

527
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:42,458
[RYO]
Get one last handful, ladies!

528
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,958
[laughs] Your turn!

529
00:25:04,041 --> 00:25:04,875
[LEILA laughs]

530
00:25:04,958 --> 00:25:06,333
[YUKIYA]
Hey, don't stop dancing!

531
00:25:06,416 --> 00:25:07,541
The party is just starting!

532
00:25:07,625 --> 00:25:08,583
[RYO]
Yeah, let's go!

533
00:25:08,666 --> 00:25:10,416
[GRANNY 3E]
What do you say, Akito?

534
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,916
Wanna go for a spin with me?

535
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,500
[AKITO]
Count me out.

536
00:25:13,583 --> 00:25:15,041
This is stupid.

537
00:25:15,125 --> 00:25:16,125
[LEILA]
Akito?

538
00:25:16,208 --> 00:25:17,833
Akito!

539
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:19,375
[AYANO]
Leila!

540
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:21,500
Ryo!

541
00:25:21,583 --> 00:25:22,875
Let her handle it.

542
00:25:22,958 --> 00:25:26,458
What's your deal?
Ugh. Come on, move!

543
00:25:35,666 --> 00:25:39,041
[LEILA]
Akito. Can we talk?

544
00:25:45,708 --> 00:25:48,250
You all right?

545
00:25:48,333 --> 00:25:49,291
I'm afraid.

546
00:25:49,375 --> 00:25:50,375
Uh.

547
00:25:51,708 --> 00:25:53,625
[AKITO] Moments like this
always make me feel

548
00:25:53,708 --> 00:25:56,458
like something bad's
just around the corner.

549
00:25:56,541 --> 00:25:58,583
[LEILA gasps]

550
00:25:58,666 --> 00:26:01,166
[AKITO]
This reminds me of that night...

551
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:04,541
[AKITO]
The moon looked so pretty.

552
00:26:04,625 --> 00:26:06,708
My parents and the rest
of the clan were laughing

553
00:26:06,791 --> 00:26:09,875
and having a great time.

554
00:26:09,958 --> 00:26:12,125
Except for my brother.

555
00:26:12,208 --> 00:26:13,416
Your brother?

556
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,583
[gasps]

557
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:19,791
Just like that, they were dead.

558
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:24,875
[AKITO]
So was I, at first.

559
00:26:29,416 --> 00:26:32,458
But for some reason I came back.

560
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:38,916
And when my brother
saw me, he just said...

561
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,875
[SHIN]
Akito. Die now.

562
00:26:51,541 --> 00:26:55,416
[AKITO] I was supposed to die
with the others.

563
00:26:57,708 --> 00:27:00,041
But I...

564
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:02,625
I...

565
00:27:02,708 --> 00:27:04,375
I didn't.

566
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:09,666
[AKITO]
There's no hope for my brother.

567
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:19,291
[AKITO]
And I have no choice...

568
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:21,541
I must kill him.

569
00:27:21,625 --> 00:27:22,750
[LEILA gasps]

570
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,458
[LEILA]
Akito.

571
00:27:28,541 --> 00:27:30,958
I'm happy that he didn't
kill you that day.

572
00:27:31,041 --> 00:27:33,041
That you survived.

573
00:27:37,875 --> 00:27:41,500
[LEILA] If you had died,
I never would've met you.

574
00:28:42,375 --> 00:28:43,625
[SOPHIE]
Is wine all right?

575
00:28:43,708 --> 00:28:49,083
[CLAUS]
Sorry. I know it's really late.

576
00:28:49,166 --> 00:28:51,125
So, how's the husband?

577
00:28:51,208 --> 00:28:54,000
[SOPHIE]
Hm. Come see him.

578
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:05,458
Claus is here to
see you, my darling.

579
00:29:05,541 --> 00:29:08,541
Dr. Randle. Good to see you.

580
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:15,708
The experiment caused
this, did it not?

581
00:29:15,791 --> 00:29:18,708
That's right.

582
00:29:18,791 --> 00:29:20,416
Five years back.

583
00:29:35,625 --> 00:29:38,833
Our dream was always to put
BRS into practical use.

584
00:29:38,916 --> 00:29:41,500
It's our hypothesis that
feelings can be shared

585
00:29:41,583 --> 00:29:44,083
by manipulating resonating
brainwaves.

586
00:29:44,166 --> 00:29:47,125
[CLAUS]
That is amazing.

587
00:29:47,208 --> 00:29:51,916
I still believe... in miracles.

588
00:30:08,333 --> 00:30:09,500
[GRANNY 3D]
Take care, children!

589
00:30:09,583 --> 00:30:12,083
[GRANNY 3B]
Be sure to eat healthy!

590
00:30:21,416 --> 00:30:24,333
[RYO] Those crazy old
broads. Good riddance.

591
00:30:24,416 --> 00:30:26,916
Y'know, I'm going to
miss them, won't you?

592
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,583
[RYO]
...No! It's my allergies.

593
00:30:28,666 --> 00:30:31,791
[YUKIYA] Who knows, maybe
we'll see them again.

594
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:33,541
[AKITO]
Commander.

595
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:34,458
[gasps]

596
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:35,500
[AKITO]
Someday...

597
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,250
[gasps]

598
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:40,083
...I hope we can go to Japan.

599
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:46,750
[JULIUS] The conquest of
Europia will be child's play.

600
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:49,916
My plan is already in motion.

601
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,166
But... Recent battle reports
revealed some troubling news.

602
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:57,958
Namely, the presence of
a Europian battle squad.

603
00:30:58,041 --> 00:31:02,666
Some sort of
"Ghost of Hannibal"?

604
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,000
Sound familiar?

605
00:31:04,083 --> 00:31:07,000
I was told you might know
something about them.

606
00:31:07,083 --> 00:31:08,458
[SHIN]
Two months ago,

607
00:31:08,541 --> 00:31:11,375
I encountered that
squad in battle.

608
00:31:11,458 --> 00:31:14,500
Regrettably, I failed
to stop them.

609
00:31:14,583 --> 00:31:20,000
You failed to stop them. Ah...

610
00:31:20,083 --> 00:31:22,291
Even so, I'd like your help.

611
00:31:22,375 --> 00:31:25,416
Heh. Lord Shaing.

612
00:31:27,625 --> 00:31:29,625
[ANNA] It's nice to hear
you had some free time

613
00:31:29,708 --> 00:31:32,083
to bond with your team.

614
00:31:32,166 --> 00:31:36,041
But you know, I'd be lying
if I said I wasn't worried.

615
00:31:36,125 --> 00:31:38,791
I was beginning to wonder
if you'd ever come back.

616
00:31:38,875 --> 00:31:42,750
[LEILA] Oh, Anna. I might've
stayed there forever.

617
00:31:42,833 --> 00:31:44,208
It was lovely.

618
00:31:44,291 --> 00:31:48,041
[ANNA]
Mm. Still...

619
00:31:48,125 --> 00:31:50,583
I'm happy you came home.

620
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:56,708
[RYO]
Hey, never seen that one before.

621
00:31:56,791 --> 00:31:58,375
[AYANO]
The colors are different.

622
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,333
[HILDA]
The components are the same.

623
00:32:00,416 --> 00:32:01,875
We've just upgraded
the programming.

624
00:32:01,958 --> 00:32:05,083
We were able to increase
the speed by 30%.

625
00:32:05,166 --> 00:32:08,458
Oh, interesting, did you use

00:40:04,708 --> 00:40:06,583
Order all your
troops to advance.

783
00:40:06,666 --> 00:40:08,833
[VELAINES] But if we march
on Europia now...

784
00:40:08,916 --> 00:40:11,208
Surely you're aware that
countless innocent people

785
00:40:11,291 --> 00:40:13,166
will be caught in the crossfire!

786
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:15,958
And that bothers you?

787
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:18,541
Heh. If one hopes
to make an omelet,

788
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:21,916
one cannot be daunted by
the breaking of a few eggs.

789
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,500
[VELAINES]
Lord Kingsley!

790
00:40:23,583 --> 00:40:27,041
The Emperor's glory should
be our only concern.

791
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:28,250
[VELAINES grunts]

792
00:40:28,333 --> 00:40:30,458
Obviously, his
Majesty's ambitions

793
00:40:30,541 --> 00:40:33,125
are not of utmost
priority for you.

794
00:40:33,208 --> 00:40:36,125
No. You intend to rebel.

795
00:40:36,208 --> 00:40:37,458
[VELAINES]
Uh!

796
00:40:39,875 --> 00:40:42,333
Which is why I must
place you under arrest...

797
00:40:42,416 --> 00:40:43,625
for treason.

798
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:45,291
[gasps]

799
00:40:45,375 --> 00:40:46,833
He's been planning this!

800
00:40:46,916 --> 00:40:47,875
[GAUDEFROY]
Why you!

801
00:40:47,958 --> 00:40:49,083
[SUZAKU grunts]

802
00:40:49,166 --> 00:40:51,791
[GAUDEFROY]
You dare arrest Duke Velaines?

803
00:40:51,875 --> 00:40:53,666
I'll kill you!

804
00:40:55,125 --> 00:40:57,041
[GAUDEFROY groans]

805
00:40:57,125 --> 00:40:59,250
I feel it's only
fair to warn you,

806
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:02,625
defying Lord Kingsley is
second only to treason.

807
00:41:02,708 --> 00:41:03,875
[GAUDEFROY growls]

808
00:41:06,125 --> 00:41:09,833
[SHIN] I urge you to follow Lord
Kingsley's commands for now.

809
00:41:09,916 --> 00:41:13,000
I suspect that's in
your best interest.

810
00:41:13,083 --> 00:41:14,708
Please, give the order.

811
00:41:14,791 --> 00:41:18,750
[VELAINES] Uh... This...
cannot... be happening

812
00:41:19,541 --> 00:41:20,958
[AKITO]
Another riot.

813
00:41:21,041 --> 00:41:23,250
Clement Industries this time.

814
00:41:23,333 --> 00:41:25,541
The more fake stories
and rumors come out,

815
00:41:25,625 --> 00:41:27,875
the more anxious people get.

816
00:41:30,583 --> 00:41:31,958
[AKITO gasps]

817
00:41:32,041 --> 00:41:33,875
[IOAN]
Leila.

818
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:36,625
It's been too long.

819
00:41:36,708 --> 00:41:38,958
I hope you've had enough
of playing soldier.

820
00:41:39,041 --> 00:41:40,875
It's time to give it up.

821
00:41:40,958 --> 00:41:43,500
[gasps]

822
00:41:43,583 --> 00:41:45,458
[IOAN] Britannia's
spreading false stories

823
00:41:45,541 --> 00:41:46,708
to get people to riot.

824
00:41:46,791 --> 00:41:50,041
The North Sea power
plant is still standing!

825
00:41:50,125 --> 00:41:53,708
The explosion was a hoax!

826
00:41:53,791 --> 00:41:55,083
This is all just a cover-up

827
00:41:55,166 --> 00:41:57,666
so they can invade
during the chaos!

828
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:00,666
We need you to come home! Hurry!

829
00:42:03,333 --> 00:42:07,416
I appreciate you worrying
about me during all this.

830
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,916
But, I'm looking for the freedom
I can't find back home.

831
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,500
Leila!

832
00:42:19,666 --> 00:42:20,791
[IOAN sighs]

833
00:42:22,291 --> 00:42:24,375
[IOAN]
Stupid woman.

834
00:42:30,916 --> 00:42:34,083
[LEILA]
Thank you so much, Ioan.

835
00:42:38,291 --> 00:42:40,958
[JULIUS] It was time
for Duke Velaines to go.

836
00:42:41,041 --> 00:42:43,083
Clearly he'd lost his mind,

837
00:42:43,166 --> 00:42:45,625
defying the Emperor
the way he did.

838
00:42:45,708 --> 00:42:47,916
[JULIUS laughs]

839
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,791
[JULIUS] He'll be in custody
until the Emperor

840
00:42:49,875 --> 00:42:52,916
can witness his
beheading firsthand.

841
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,416
[SHIN]
And what about the Great Nobles?

842
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,458
[JULIUS chuckles] I highly
doubt any of them would have

843
00:42:58,541 --> 00:43:02,583
the backbone to attack
the Britannian homeland.

844
00:43:02,666 --> 00:43:07,041
I plan to oversee
Euro Britannia myself.

845
00:43:08,833 --> 00:43:11,083
I think that's checkmate.

846
00:43:13,708 --> 00:43:15,541
Right, well played.

847
00:43:15,625 --> 00:43:17,583
[JULIUS laughs]

848
00:43:19,875 --> 00:43:21,958
Your tactics were
revealing, in fact,

849
00:43:22,041 --> 00:43:25,541
the chessboard reflects
your moral compass.

850
00:43:27,541 --> 00:43:30,625
At one point, you
would've beat me

851
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:34,416
if only you'd thought to
sacrifice your queen.

852
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,958
[SHIN]
What are you saying?

853
00:43:37,041 --> 00:43:38,208
[JULIUS]
I'm saying,

854
00:43:38,291 --> 00:43:40,833
some things are just too
precious to surrender.

855
00:43:40,916 --> 00:43:42,125
Aren't they?

856
00:43:42,208 --> 00:43:45,541
Just think about it.

857
00:43:45,625 --> 00:43:49,208
Everyone possesses
this weakness.

858
00:43:49,291 --> 00:43:54,583
Be it for a family member, a
friend, or perhaps a lover.

859
00:43:54,666 --> 00:43:58,375
But not me. I'm different.

860
00:43:58,458 --> 00:43:59,875
Are you?

861
00:43:59,958 --> 00:44:01,750
The person I care for,

862
00:44:01,833 --> 00:44:04,333
and the only person
I would die for,

863
00:44:04,416 --> 00:44:06,166
is our exalted Emperor!

864
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:07,208
[JULIUS gasps]

865
00:44:07,291 --> 00:44:08,375
[SHIN grunts]

866
00:44:08,916 --> 00:44:13,125
[JULIUS groaning]
But His Majesty...

867
00:44:13,208 --> 00:44:16,208
I must protect His Majesty!

868
00:44:17,666 --> 00:44:19,875
[JULIUS yells]

869
00:44:23,708 --> 00:44:27,375
[JULIUS] Wh-Who's there?
Identify yourself!

870
00:44:27,458 --> 00:44:29,041
Well, now.

871
00:44:31,833 --> 00:44:35,208
[JULIUS groaning]
That isn't who I am!

872
00:44:35,291 --> 00:44:39,916
I don't understand. Where am I?

873
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,916
The Tokyo Settlement?
Is this Kamine Island?

874
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,500
Release your hold on
me now, Julius Kingsley!

875
00:44:49,583 --> 00:44:51,291
This is interesting.

876
00:44:51,375 --> 00:44:54,708
[SUZAKU] Lord Kingsley
isn't feeling well.

877
00:44:54,791 --> 00:44:56,666
I'm afraid you must leave.

878
00:44:56,750 --> 00:45:00,666
But please, come
back another time.

879
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:02,416
You know, the first
time I heard about

880
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:07,375
the Ark Fleet plan, the idea
reminded me of someone.

881
00:45:07,458 --> 00:45:11,291
A certain terrorist in Area 11.

882
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:14,000
The strategy put forth
by Lord Kingsley

883
00:45:14,083 --> 00:45:17,125
is strikingly similar
to his efforts.

884
00:45:17,208 --> 00:45:20,541
In fact... it's the same.

885
00:45:20,625 --> 00:45:22,541
Your point?

886
00:45:24,541 --> 00:45:26,625
He is actually the rebel Zero.

887
00:45:26,708 --> 00:45:28,083
No, Zero's dead!

888
00:45:28,166 --> 00:45:30,458
The Emperor put him to death!

889
00:45:30,541 --> 00:45:32,333
But it's obvious.

890
00:45:32,416 --> 00:45:34,375
Why else would Suzaku Kururugi,

891
00:45:34,458 --> 00:45:37,000
a Knight of the Round,
be guarding him?

892
00:45:37,083 --> 00:45:38,625
Enough of these false claims,

893
00:45:38,708 --> 00:45:41,375
or I'll have no choice
but to silence you!

894
00:45:41,458 --> 00:45:44,000
[SHIN] I must admit you've
impressed me, Kururugi.

895
00:45:44,083 --> 00:45:49,166
Look at you! The son of
Japan's last prime minister.

896
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:52,333
And now you've become a
knight of its conqueror.

897
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:55,000
[growls] What about it?!

898
00:45:55,083 --> 00:45:57,541
I just think it's brilliant.

899
00:46:03,541 --> 00:46:05,333
Knights of Michael?

00:46:06,291 --> 00:46:07,250
[SUZAKU grunts]

901
00:46:31,833 --> 00:46:33,291
[SUZAKU]
Honestly.

902
00:46:33,375 --> 00:46:34,916
Do you think this is proper?

903
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,041
Barging into His
Majesty's emissary

904
00:46:37,125 --> 00:46:39,083
with a squad of Knightmares?

905
00:46:39,166 --> 00:46:40,916
[JEAN] He may be a
Knight of the Round,

906
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,833
but do not be afraid!

907
00:46:42,916 --> 00:46:46,375
Let us slay Lancelot
for honor and glory!

Kururugi, look.

00:48:30,208 --> 00:48:32,250
Take a look around you.

922

[SHIN] This world is rife
with blood and death.

923
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:40,666
Exactly what you asked for.

924
00:48:41,291 --> 00:48:44,041
No! I don't want to fight!

925

[SHIN]
You've given up on this world.

926
00:48:46,875 --> 00:48:48,125
All of it. Trash.

No!

[SHIN]
Don't deny it.

930
00:48:54,625 --> 00:48:58,500
All you want is to
destroy the world.

931
00:48:58,583 --> 00:49:00,000
Shut up.

So you're the Emperor's.

as day, Suzaku.

944
00:50:07,291 --> 00:50:11,583
The darkness that dwells
deep inside your heart.

945

[SHIN chuckles]

946
00:50:19,625 --> 00:50:21,333
[SMILAS]
Under no circumstances

947
00:50:21,416 --> 00:50:24,416
shall the details of
our plan be revealed.

948
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:27,958
We'll work with them on a
need-to-know basis, Genera--

949
00:50:28,666 --> 00:50:30,000
[SMILAS]
Hm?

950
00:50:31,958 --> 00:50:33,041
[SMILAS grunts]

951
00:50:39,541 --> 00:50:41,583
[CARETAKER]
Since the dawn of time,

952
00:50:41,666 --> 00:50:44,000
the young have rushed
to their own deaths.

953
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:45,833
It can't be.

954
00:50:45,916 --> 00:50:47,583
[CARETAKER]
Every hero

955
00:50:47,666 --> 00:50:50,500
is just another
dead man walking.

956
00:50:50,583 --> 00:50:54,375
[SMILAS] It's not like I enjoy
sending soldiers to die.

957
00:50:54,458 --> 00:50:55,833
[CARETAKER]
Of course not.

958
00:50:55,916 --> 00:50:58,750
You'd never express
it in those words.

959
00:50:58,833 --> 00:51:00,208
But still...

960
00:51:00,291 --> 00:51:03,458
You are leading them
to the slaughter--

961
00:51:03,541 --> 00:51:06,583
for your own gain.

962
00:51:08,041 --> 00:51:09,625
[SMILAS]
What's your point?

963
00:51:09,708 --> 00:51:11,208
It's very simple.

964
00:51:11,291 --> 00:51:13,375
Your ambitions to become
king of this world

965
00:51:13,458 --> 00:51:16,541
are of no interest to us.

966
00:51:16,625 --> 00:51:18,500
But the fact remains...

967
00:51:18,583 --> 00:51:21,958
...there was a time when
you conspired against us.

968
00:51:22,041 --> 00:51:25,291
And the time has come to atone
for your transgressions.

969
00:51:25,375 --> 00:51:26,666
Atonement?

970
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:27,916
But how?

971
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,500
What are you asking me to do?

972
00:51:37,083 --> 00:51:39,583
This is an order in
the name of The Geass.

973
00:51:39,666 --> 00:51:41,083
[SMILAS gasping]

974
00:51:41,166 --> 00:51:45,083
You are to assassinate
Lord Shin Hyuuga Shaing.

975
00:51:45,166 --> 00:51:47,250
[SMILAS]
What? Lord Shaing?

976
00:51:47,333 --> 00:51:49,416
But how do you even
know about him?

977
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:53,250
[gasps] No, wait... Is he...?

978
00:51:53,333 --> 00:51:55,833
If you kill Shaing,
we will be satisfied.

979
00:51:55,916 --> 00:51:59,000
But if you don't,
we'll have to...

980
00:51:59,083 --> 00:52:01,083
[SMILAS]
Uh! I'll do it.

981
00:52:01,166 --> 00:52:03,875
I-I give you my word.

982
00:52:03,958 --> 00:52:09,583
You are now bound by a
contract. Remember that.

983
00:52:09,666 --> 00:52:13,333
As long as the balance of
spacetime remains undisturbed,

984
00:52:13,416 --> 00:52:15,500
we shall be content.

985
00:52:15,583 --> 00:52:19,041
We care not who becomes
king of this world.

986
00:52:24,375 --> 00:52:25,875
[SMILAS exhales]

987
00:52:26,583 --> 00:52:28,041
[LORDS chattering]

988
00:52:28,125 --> 00:52:30,291
[GREAT LORD 3C] Lord Shaing
was adopted by royalty.

989
00:52:30,375 --> 00:52:32,166
He's not even blood!

990
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:35,541
Indeed, how insolent of him
to summon all of us here!

991
00:52:35,625 --> 00:52:37,083
[GREAT LORD 3A]
There he is.

992
00:52:37,166 --> 00:52:39,166
[GREAT LORD 3B]
That bastard.

993
00:52:40,416 --> 00:52:42,000
[SHIN]
I have received some information

994
00:52:42,083 --> 00:52:45,041
that I must relay to
the House of Lords.

995
00:52:45,125 --> 00:52:47,958
The man who calls
himself Julius Kingsley,

996
00:52:48,041 --> 00:52:51,125
the military advisor of the
Holy Britannian Empire,

997
00:52:51,208 --> 00:52:54,250
is concealing his true identity
as the rebel called Zero.

998
00:52:54,333 --> 00:52:55,666
[GREAT LORD 3A]
Zero?!

999
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:58,750
The terrorist who wreaked
all that havoc in Area 11?

1000
00:52:58,833 --> 00:53:02,041
[GREAT LORD 3B] That can't
be true. He was executed!

1001
00:53:02,125 --> 00:53:05,583
That was merely a fabrication
created by Kingsley.

1002
00:53:05,666 --> 00:53:08,916
But don't worry, I've
already taken care of him.

1003
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
[LORDS chattering]

1004
00:53:10,083 --> 00:53:11,541
[GREAT LORD 3E]
You killed Kingsley?!

1005
00:53:11,625 --> 00:53:14,208
Without consulting the empire?!

1006
00:53:14,291 --> 00:53:16,708
Any of you would have
done the same.

1007
00:53:16,791 --> 00:53:20,708
You all harbor discontent
with His Majesty, do you not?

1008
00:53:20,791 --> 00:53:22,333
[GREAT LORD 3F]
If we defy the emperor

1009
00:53:22,416 --> 00:53:25,375
it will be an all-out war
against the homeland!

1010
00:53:25,458 --> 00:53:28,083
Then I suggest you
be prepared.

1011
00:53:28,166 --> 00:53:31,083
To the west is Europia!

1012
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:33,500
And Britannia lies to the east.

1013
00:53:33,583 --> 00:53:36,750
If Euro Brittania
hopes to survive,

1014
00:53:36,833 --> 00:53:39,625
fighting is our only option.

1015
00:53:39,708 --> 00:53:41,500
[GREAT LORD 3A]
But what about Duke Velaines?!

1016
00:53:41,583 --> 00:53:43,291
What does he say about this?!

1017
00:53:43,375 --> 00:53:46,625
It doesn't matter.
The battle's already underway.

1018
00:53:46,708 --> 00:53:48,083
If you wish to survive,

1019
00:53:48,166 --> 00:53:50,541
hand over the reins to
those willing to fight.

1020
00:53:50,625 --> 00:53:54,000
[GREAT LORD 3C] Have the Four
Great Orders agreed on this?

1021
00:53:54,083 --> 00:53:57,083
Unfortunately, the other
commanders were afraid to fight.

1022
00:53:57,166 --> 00:53:58,666
They threatened to flee.

1023
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:03,583
So I was forced to take
matters into my own hands.

1024
00:54:03,666 --> 00:54:05,791
[LORDS gasping]

1025
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:07,333
That's Lord Villon!

1026
00:54:07,416 --> 00:54:09,958
And Lord Saint-Gilles. Dear god!

1027
00:54:10,041 --> 00:54:12,583
The time has come for
decisive maneuvers.

1028
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:14,500
We can't stay idle!

1029
00:54:14,583 --> 00:54:17,750
I request a transfer of
the Grand Duke's control.

1030
00:54:17,833 --> 00:54:22,125
As well as absolute authority
over the House of Lords!

1031
00:54:26,083 --> 00:54:27,250
[KNIGHT 1A]
The rebels are likely

1032
00:54:27,333 --> 00:54:29,333
from the Order of Michael.

1033
00:54:29,416 --> 00:54:32,583
Lord Shaing, of course.

1034
00:54:32,666 --> 00:54:36,083
First he killed Manfredi,
and now he plans to kill me.

1035
00:54:36,166 --> 00:54:39,083
[OPERATOR 3C] We can't reach
the Orders of Gabriel, or Uriel,

1036
00:54:39,166 --> 00:54:40,458
not even HQ!

1037
00:54:40,541 --> 00:54:43,791
They must have been attacked
by the Order of Michael.

1038
00:54:43,875 --> 00:54:47,333
They're trying to
dismantle our leadership.

1039
00:54:47,416 --> 00:54:50,416
You'll pay for this, Hyuga!

1040
00:54:52,416 --> 00:54:54,541
[LEILA]
So regarding the Paris blackout,

1041
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:58,750
the incident wasn't caused
by a terrorist attack.

1042
00:54:58,833 --> 00:55:00,958
The North Sea power
plant is still there,

1043
00:55:01,041 --> 00:55:02,708
completely unharmed.

1044
00:55:02,791 --> 00:55:04,125
So...

1045
00:55:04,208 --> 00:55:07,291
What about that video that
was all over the internet?

1046
00:55:07,375 --> 00:55:09,541
[LEILA]
That file was carefully edited.

1047
00:55:09,625 --> 00:55:12,458
But... There've been
attacks all over Europia!

1048
00:55:12,541 --> 00:55:15,166
Those reports were
falsified as well.

1049
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:18,208
They're spreading fake news
hoping to cause mass hysteria

1050
00:55:18,291 --> 00:55:21,125
and start riots in Europia.
Weakening our resolve.

1051
00:55:21,208 --> 00:55:22,541
Okay...

1052
00:55:22,625 --> 00:55:24,875
Well if that's true, than
the Ark must be fake too.

1053
00:55:24,958 --> 00:55:27,541
Actually, the Ark is very real.

1054
00:55:27,625 --> 00:55:28,958
Uh...

1055
00:55:29,041 --> 00:55:31,208
[LEILA] A giant flying
weapon is the perfect way

1056
00:55:31,291 --> 00:55:33,541
to instill widespread panic.

1057
00:55:33,625 --> 00:55:37,083
That said, the Ark...

1058
00:55:37,166 --> 00:55:38,666
...is just a bluff.

1059
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:41,166
A bluff? So it's for show?

1060
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:42,291
Yes.

1061
00:55:42,375 --> 00:55:43,833
We do not believe
the Ark is equipped

1062
00:55:43,916 --> 00:55:45,916
with any kind of
high-yield bombs.

1063
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,083
So it poses no actual danger.

1064
00:55:48,166 --> 00:55:49,750
This is nothing more
than a strategy

1065
00:55:49,833 --> 00:55:51,708
to prey on the citizens' fear.

1066
00:55:51,791 --> 00:55:53,500
If we want to put a
stop to the riots,

1067
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:55,916
then the best course of
action is to expose the Ark

1068
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,541
for what it truly is.

1069
00:55:57,625 --> 00:56:00,291
And you want to use
the Wyvern Squad?

1070
00:56:00,375 --> 00:56:01,791
Correct.

1071
00:56:01,875 --> 00:56:04,416
But I'm sure that whoever
designed such a brilliant plan

1072
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:09,208
is expecting us to launch a
direct attack against the Ark.

1073
00:56:09,291 --> 00:56:10,291
Which is why--

1074
00:56:10,375 --> 00:56:11,166

Sounds like it

1078
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:16,833
I'm down.

1079
00:56:16,916 --> 00:56:18,166
I can handle this alone.

would never hurt Akito.

Should we stop them?

Ah, to be young again.

1098
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:01,833
How much steam do they
need to blow off?
