[LEILA] Revolutionary
Calendar, year 228.

2
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:21,875
After the battle of Slonim,

3
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:25,208
Leila, Akito and the others
were stranded in Warsaw,

4
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,458
where their bonds
of trust deepened.

5
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:29,916
Meanwhile, due to propaganda
from Britannia's

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,291
military advisor,
Julius Kingsley,

7
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:34,583
riots engulfed Europia
under the shadow

8
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:36,541
of a warship called the Ark.

9
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:39,083
Akito and the others set
their sights on the Ark

10
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:42,458
in hopes of preventing
a Britannian invasion.

11
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:49,291
[G1 OP 4A]
The course is clear.

12
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:52,833
You'll be able to reach
ten kilometers in one go.

13
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,833
Ah. A Float System?

14
00:00:56,916 --> 00:00:59,666
The homeland has
outdone themselves.

15
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,250
[G1 OP 4A]
Commencing countdown.

16
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:05,458
[JEAN] Confirming destination.
Entry complete.

Hilda, Chloe.

19
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:01,458
Status update on
Alexander Variants.

20
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:02,916
Everything looks okay.

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,791
[CHLOE]
No problems.

22
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,666
[SARA] T-minus eight
minutes to liftoff!

[LEILA grunts]

26
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:13,375
All right.

27
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:16,083
Just to be on the safe side,
let's confirm BRS, Joe.

28
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:19,291
So far it looks, uh,
fine, Doctor Randle.

29
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:21,916
Make sure that you
come home safely.

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,291
Fingers crossed, eh?
And now we wait.

31
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:29,083
[SARA]
All systems ready!

32
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:31,666
Start the main engine now!

33
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:54,250
So, that's Apollo's Chariot.

34
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,166
It's beautiful.

00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:34,291
I can't wait to see you again.

Separation successful!

00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,041
And confirmed!

[OLIVIA] Observation balloon
has a lock on Wyvern Squad!

55
00:04:57,291 --> 00:05:00,625
This is it. They've
arrived at the Ark!

56
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,000
This feels weird, right?

57
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:03,833
[OLIVIA gasping]

00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,958

[gasps] Captain Clement!

60
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,708
I've finished
analyzing the data.

61
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:16,041
But it's strange.

62
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,125
[LEILA]
How so?

63
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:18,791
In relation to volume,

64
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:22,625
its mass isn't big enough.
It's almost as if...

65
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:25,583
It's... nearly empty.

66
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,541
Wyvern Squad!
Requesting weapons!

00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:31,125
The Alexanders have
gone to combat output!

00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,625
Somebody's home!

69
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:42,250
There's more than I thought.

70
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:43,958
[SARA]
They're engaging the enemy!

71
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:45,083
[LEILA]
But who?

72
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:46,375
And how many?

73
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,125

Oh, Joannes.

You must be getting
lonely over there.

Please, Master!

We're begging you!

00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,333
Why won't you allow
us to come too?

82
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:10,000
Let us accompany you!

Master Ashley!

84
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:13,291
I will not repeat myself!

85
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:16,458
I'm going alone, you hear me?!

86
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:20,666
Just you wait. I promise
I'll avenge you.

00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,875
Even if it kills me!

00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:25,416
[gasps] This is...

00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,958
Emergency message from Joint HQ!

90
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:30,208
Joint HQ? And who is it from?

91
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:32,625
It's a direct line,
from General Smilas!

92
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,500
[gasps]

93
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,583

Thank goodness
you're safe, General.

[SMILAS]
I'm fine, yes.

96
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:43,833
But the government and the
military they are scattering.

97
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:46,500
Paris is in shambles.

98
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:49,500
It's bad. But, I won't be
going anywhere. Trust me.

99
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:52,500
Sir, the... The cause of
the riots you speak of.

100
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:54,000
The Ark Fleet is...

101
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,500
...a bluff by the
Euro-Britannian Army.

102
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,291
[SMILAS]
Do you have proof of this?

103
00:06:58,375 --> 00:06:59,833
[LEILA]
A mission is currently underway

104
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:03,375
to get the Wyvern Squad
onto the Ark, sir.

105
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:05,166
So far it seems the
only thing aboard

106
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,916
are a few Britannian
Knightmares.

107
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,458
We must relay this to the
people of Europia at once!

108
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:15,375
That may not be too
helpful at this point.

109
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:16,875
Leila.

110
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:20,000
This frustration with the
government has built over years.

111
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:22,125
We may have to let it
burn out on its own.

112
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,875
But, sir. There must be
something we can still do.

113
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:26,750
Anything at all!

114
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:31,000
Then our best bet is
if it comes from you.

115

[gasps]

116
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,500
Only you can reach them now.

117
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:38,458
Only you can find the words.

118
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,708
They'll listen to you.

119
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:43,541
For you're the daughter
of Bradow Von Breisgau.

120
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,166
These damn Knightmares
are a dead giveaway.

121
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,250
Britannia's behind this!

122

They're quick to run,
aren't they?

00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,833
This thing is...

125
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:26,875
These things are just drones.

who they're messing with!

Are you reading me, Ryo?

About time.

Heh. Ha!

Wait. Is that...?

140
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,583
It's that red Knightmare.

Ah, man.

142
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:23,125
And Schrötter Steel armor?

143
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,041
To the citizens of Europia.

144
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,833
Please listen to my words
with an open mind.

145
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:32,083
It is the height of
foolishness to riot

146
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:35,625
in response to Britannian
media manipulation.

147
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:39,416
I lead a unit that battles
Euro-Britannia covertly.

What's more,

these soldiers fighting
on the front lines

152
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,916
are those we call Elevens.

153
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,666
And keep in internment camps.
They are the Japanese.

154
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,958
Out of fear--

155
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,041
fear of the Britannian empire--

156
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,750
we are robbing them
of their freedom.

fighting if you want to.

492
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:09,583
It won't change anything.

493
00:35:09,666 --> 00:35:12,125
The world's not
that nice a place.

494
00:35:12,208 --> 00:35:13,291
I only want--

495
00:35:13,375 --> 00:35:15,000
Listen to me!

496
00:35:15,083 --> 00:35:18,041
You just need to worry
about saving your life,

497
00:35:18,125 --> 00:35:20,083
and the lives of everyone here!

498
00:35:20,166 --> 00:35:21,500
That's more than enough!

499
00:35:21,583 --> 00:35:23,833
Nobody could fault you
for that, could they?

500
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:25,708
[SMILAS] Don't hesitate
to lay down your lives

501
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:27,416
in the name of freedom!

502
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,583
Though you may die,

503
00:35:28,666 --> 00:35:31,291
the light of your resolve
shall shine on!

504
00:35:31,375 --> 00:35:33,708
Do not cling to a
life of slavery!

505
00:35:33,791 --> 00:35:35,625
I for one, plan to fight!

506
00:35:35,708 --> 00:35:37,000
Fight for freedom!

507
00:35:37,083 --> 00:35:39,750
Rabble-rousers like him
aren't the ones who suffer.

508
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:42,250
They just make a
mountain of corpses,

509
00:35:42,333 --> 00:35:44,458
and use them as stepping
stones to reach

510
00:35:44,541 --> 00:35:46,791
whatever the hell they're after.

511
00:35:46,875 --> 00:35:49,791
[SMILAS] Fellow citizens!
Stand with me!

512
00:35:49,875 --> 00:35:51,958
The tomorrow Breisgau
fought for,

513
00:35:52,041 --> 00:35:54,958
and tried to protect,
will be ours!

[CROWD cheering]

The General's trying to make
himself emperor of Europia.

516
00:36:05,458 --> 00:36:08,958
You were just a
means to that end.

517
00:36:15,125 --> 00:36:18,791
[CLAUS] I'll set up negotiations
with Euro-Britannia.

518
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:22,583
Please, draw up a
letter of surrender.

519
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:29,458
[BRONDELLO] We would like
to see Lord Shaing.

520
00:36:29,541 --> 00:36:32,125
[JEAN] If there is an issue,
I shall see to it.

521
00:36:32,208 --> 00:36:34,416
Our Grand Master is very busy

522
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,125
with Euro-Britannian
government affairs.

523
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:39,416
[DORE] You don't have to
tell us that, you know.

524
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,666
We're perfectly aware.

525
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,125
[SCHOLZ]
Right, and that's the problem!

526
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:44,750
We demand that he explains
why we must cross the border

527
00:36:44,833 --> 00:36:47,791
to take some crumbly castle
in the middle of nowhere!

528
00:36:47,875 --> 00:36:50,083
[JEAN]
If you don't know the reason,

529
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:52,291
then will you be
afraid to fight?

530
00:36:52,375 --> 00:36:55,916
You dare to insult the Three
Swordmasters of Michael?

531
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:00,583
[JEAN] It seems in quite
poor form for a knight

532
00:37:00,666 --> 00:37:02,833
to draw his sword so
lightly, is it not?

533
00:37:02,916 --> 00:37:05,875
Is this what Lord
Manfredi taught you?

534
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:07,000
What did you say?!

535
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:08,041
Scholz, that's enough!

536
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:09,541
[DORE]
We allow no one

537
00:37:09,625 --> 00:37:13,250
to mock our honorable
master, Lord Manfredi!

538
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:18,291
[JEAN] Your Lord Manfredi
is dead and gone.

[SWORDMASTERS gasp]

[JEAN]
What's more, as per his will,

541
00:37:21,875 --> 00:37:25,583
Lord Shaing is now Grand Master
of the Holy Order of Michael.

[BRONDELLO gasps]

543
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,750
[JEAN]
In which case...

544
00:37:28,833 --> 00:37:32,958
...your duty as knights
is to obey his orders.

545
00:37:33,041 --> 00:37:34,291
Prove on the battlefield

546
00:37:34,375 --> 00:37:37,500
the spotless reputation of
the Three Swordmasters

547
00:37:37,583 --> 00:37:39,125
is not a lie.

548

When is this battle
to occur, then?!

549
00:37:43,791 --> 00:37:45,875
I cannot tell you
that just yet,

550
00:37:45,958 --> 00:37:48,958
but I am certain that when
the battle finally arrives,

551
00:37:49,041 --> 00:37:51,625
the Three Swordmasters of
the Holy Order of Michael

552

will be ready.

Shin.

[SHIN'S MOTHER]
My darling.

558
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:48,375
[SHIN'S MOTHER] It was not
my desire for you to turn out

559
00:38:48,458 --> 00:38:51,875
the same way your father did.

560
00:38:51,958 --> 00:38:53,916
I beg your forgiveness!

561
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,125
Forgiveness?

562
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:56,875
You were no mother to me.

563
00:38:56,958 --> 00:38:58,833
You threw that away when
you debased yourself.

564
00:38:58,916 --> 00:39:02,166
[SHIN'S MOTHER]
Then at least forgive Akito!

565
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,208
The avatar of your betrayal?

566
00:39:04,291 --> 00:39:07,250
Your father was a great
man in many ways, Shin.

567
00:39:07,333 --> 00:39:08,666
He loved you.

568
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:11,416
But his cruelty knew no end.

569
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,791
He killed Akito's father.

570
00:39:13,875 --> 00:39:16,083
And then you killed me.

571
00:39:16,166 --> 00:39:17,833
Your own mother.

00:39:17,916 --> 00:39:21,958

Stop it, please!

597
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:48,208
It's like their ghosts
are haunting me.

598
00:40:48,291 --> 00:40:51,666
No. Surely there is no
such thing as ghosts.

599
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:54,458
There is nothing decent in this
world that would be worth

602

If it meant I could be with you,

603
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:09,541
I would follow you
to Hell itself.

604

[HAMMEL]
Please stand clear!

605
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:30,416
[ANNA]
Be careful, Leila.

606
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:33,833
Don't be worried, Anna.

607
00:41:33,916 --> 00:41:35,875
Go prep the Alexanders
so that they're ready

608
00:41:35,958 --> 00:41:37,500
to be disarmed immediately.

609
00:41:37,583 --> 00:41:41,458
You'll be notified when the
negotiations have concluded.

610
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,291
Huh?

611
00:41:47,375 --> 00:41:48,833
If you're thinking of joining
the Commander, sir,

612
00:41:48,916 --> 00:41:50,708
who will be in charge
of Weiswolf Castle

613
00:41:50,791 --> 00:41:52,666
if something goes wrong?

614
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:54,416
Well, I suppose,

615
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,250
you can do it, Major Hammel.

616
00:41:56,333 --> 00:41:58,291
[HAMMEL]
But I'm not qualified!

617
00:41:58,375 --> 00:42:01,750
[CLAUS] Then it's a good thing
it probably won't come to that.

618
00:42:01,833 --> 00:42:04,083
Just keep an eye on things.

619
00:42:49,625 --> 00:42:54,000
[CLAUS] It's gotten colder.
I hope it doesn't stick.

620
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:38,916
So you're the
Schwarzwald Mole?

621
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,125
That's right.

622
00:43:40,208 --> 00:43:44,333
This is the draft of
the surrender document.

623
00:43:44,416 --> 00:43:45,666
Our one condition

624
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:47,500
is that you allow
all base personnel

625
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,875
to leave here unharmed.

626
00:43:50,416 --> 00:43:52,625
[JEAN] Where's the base's
decryption cypher?

627
00:43:52,708 --> 00:43:56,333
[CLAUS laughs] Oh, it's in
there if you really want it.

628
00:43:56,416 --> 00:43:59,208
[JEAN] And the data
on Apollo's Chariot?

629
00:43:59,291 --> 00:44:00,375
[CLAUS]
Inside.

630
00:44:00,458 --> 00:44:02,666
[JEAN] In appreciation
of your hard work,

631
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:05,416
I could arrange for asylum
in Euro-Brittania.

632
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,958
[CLAUS]
Heh.

633
00:44:07,041 --> 00:44:09,291
That's kind of you.

634
00:44:09,375 --> 00:44:12,000
I might take you up on that.

[SHIN]
Ancient Roman ruins.

636
00:44:34,375 --> 00:44:37,791
You have excellent taste,
Lieutenant Colonel.

637
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:40,750
[LEILA] And do you find
my terms acceptable?

638
00:44:40,833 --> 00:44:45,041
[SHIN] Theres no need
to rush. We have time.

639
00:44:45,125 --> 00:44:46,916
To think that a girl like you

640
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,875
actually planned the Ghost
of Hannibal operations.

641
00:44:50,958 --> 00:44:53,041
They were quite the surprise.

642
00:44:53,125 --> 00:44:56,333
We Euro-Britannians suffered
heavy losses thanks to you.

643
00:44:56,416 --> 00:44:57,375
[LEILA grunts]

644
00:44:57,458 --> 00:45:00,250
[SHIN]
Now, don't misunderstand me.

645
00:45:00,333 --> 00:45:04,000
I have no desire for
revenge against you.

646
00:45:04,083 --> 00:45:06,833
No. I wish only to thank you.

647
00:45:06,916 --> 00:45:08,833
Wait, thank me?

648
00:45:08,916 --> 00:45:10,416
[SHIN]
The Euro-Britannian nobles

649
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:14,750
used to rely on chivalry

Anyway, they fell
right into my lap.

Even sooner than
I had anticipated.

You were the one
in that Knightmare.

[LEILA gasps]

A brother who would
disobey my command

666
00:45:56,791 --> 00:45:58,541
is of no use to me.

667

But Akito is still alive!

Hmm?

I just know what he promised me.

Heh.

672
00:46:08,666 --> 00:46:11,791
Akito told me about what
you did to your family.

673
00:46:11,875 --> 00:46:13,583
About what you did to him.

674
00:46:13,666 --> 00:46:14,666
What of it?

675
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:16,541
Akito said he'd stop you.

And I believe him!

You 'believe'?

You still don't get it, do you?

682
00:46:43,833 --> 00:46:45,500
That you've been betrayed?

[LEILA]
You mean General Smilas?

[SHIN]
Allow me to edify you.

685
00:46:53,291 --> 00:46:56,166
Faith and loyalty are
nothing more than illusions

devised by the clever

Do you really think that mankind
is worth believing in?

If I didn't, Lord Shaing,

how can I ask anyone
to follow me?

No, not just Britannia.

813
00:53:07,916 --> 00:53:09,666
[SHIN]
Well, Jean?

814
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:12,000
Isn't it just as I said?

815
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:18,625
Oh, crap! It's a
damn Knightmare!

816
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:24,083
Stay back!

817
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:34,375
It's the Vercingetorix! Akito!

818
00:53:36,208 --> 00:53:37,375
Wait.

819
00:53:40,166 --> 00:53:41,458
Akito.

820
00:53:48,416 --> 00:53:49,750
[ASHLEY]
Lord Shaing!

821
00:53:49,833 --> 00:53:51,250
Bastard.

822
00:53:51,333 --> 00:53:54,083
You've got some nerve blowing
up the Ark with me on it!

823
00:53:54,166 --> 00:53:57,750
[ASHLEY grunting] Hey, what
the hell are you doing?!

824
00:53:57,833 --> 00:54:01,208
Shut up, you traitor!
I'll kill you myself!

825
00:54:02,833 --> 00:54:03,791
[ASHLEY]
Get real!

826
00:54:03,875 --> 00:54:06,291
It's you who's the
traitor, dammit!

827
00:54:06,375 --> 00:54:07,666
Who the hell's that?

828
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:09,625
We have to get to the boat!

829
00:54:09,708 --> 00:54:12,666
Hey! Just hold on a minute!

830
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:14,750
Surprise! Akito sent me!

831
00:54:14,833 --> 00:54:17,333
Now let's get out of here!

832
00:54:17,416 --> 00:54:20,291
And who are you exactly?

833
00:54:20,375 --> 00:54:23,125
[SHIN] You haven't changed
one bit since then.

834
00:54:23,208 --> 00:54:26,166
You're still just a child.

835
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:29,083
You've no clue how
the world works.

836
00:54:29,166 --> 00:54:31,250
[AKITO]
That's not true Shin.

837
00:54:31,333 --> 00:54:33,833
Violence won't change anything.

838
00:54:33,916 --> 00:54:37,916
People insist on following the
same petty and feckless rulers.

839
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,791
I can't allow that to continue.

840
00:54:40,875 --> 00:54:42,291
Akito,

841
00:54:42,375 --> 00:54:44,291
if you are indeed
my little brother,

842
00:54:44,375 --> 00:54:45,458
you of all people

843
00:54:45,541 --> 00:54:47,666
should understand
what I'm trying to do.

844
00:54:49,833 --> 00:54:51,000
Brother.

845
00:54:57,166 --> 00:54:58,625
Stop it!

846
00:55:02,416 --> 00:55:03,666
Commander?

847
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:06,291
Don't do this!
You're not like him!

848
00:55:06,375 --> 00:55:09,416
[SHIN growls]
Akito! Kill that woman, now!

849
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:11,375
[AKITO whimpers]

850
00:55:11,458 --> 00:55:14,000
[SHIN] You take your
orders from me alone!

851
00:55:14,083 --> 00:55:14,916
[gasping]

852
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,708
[SHIN]
Kill her!

853
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:24,875
[SHIN]
Kill her.

854
00:55:44,041 --> 00:55:45,583
I can't.

855
00:55:45,666 --> 00:55:47,333
Akito!

856
00:55:48,166 --> 00:55:49,833
Let's go.

857
00:55:57,250 --> 00:55:59,500
You're gonna want to hang on.

858
00:56:04,291 --> 00:56:05,541
[SHIN]
Hmm?!

859
00:56:11,625 --> 00:56:12,583
[gasps]

860
00:56:16,708 --> 00:56:18,208
Lieutenant Colonel!

861
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:21,041
Akito! Jump on!

862
00:56:22,166 --> 00:56:24,291
Ready? Hold on tight now.

863
00:56:24,375 --> 00:56:25,875
I'm gonna jump.

864
00:56:53,708 --> 00:56:55,750
Come on! Let's punch it!

865
00:56:55,833 --> 00:57:00,333
[CLAUS] Huh? Sure, but it's
a little cold for a cruise.

866
00:57:05,833 --> 00:57:06,958
[HAMMEL]
Uh!

867
00:57:10,791 --> 00:57:13,333
[HAMMEL] The Commander
and Akito's Alexander?

868
00:57:13,416 --> 00:57:15,416
All right!

869
00:57:18,583 --> 00:57:21,333
Leila! Leila!

870
00:58:27,166 --> 00:58:28,916
[YUKIYA]
I hate to do this.

871
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,916
But... It's war, after all.

872
00:58:51,625 --> 00:58:53,125
[YUKIYA]
Sorry.

873
00:58:53,208 --> 00:58:56,916
But I'm afraid that my
friends' lives come first.

874
00:58:57,958 --> 00:59:01,541
[SOLDIERS chattering]

875
00:59:01,625 --> 00:59:03,875
Regroup! [gasps]

876
00:59:03,958 --> 00:59:05,791
Goddammit.

877
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:08,083
[SHIN]
The enemy's above the clouds.

878
00:59:08,166 --> 00:59:09,708
I'm sending coordinates.

879
00:59:09,791 --> 00:59:12,250
Shoot it down with a Canterbury.

880
00:59:26,958 --> 00:59:27,916
[gasps]

881
00:59:31,666 --> 00:59:33,041
God!

882
00:59:35,166 --> 00:59:36,625
Yukiya.

883
00:59:36,708 --> 00:59:39,333
Yukiya!

884
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:43,500
[SHIN]
Akito.

885
00:59:43,583 --> 00:59:46,833
The time has come for me to kill

886
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:50,083
everyone you have ever loved.

887
00:59:50,166 --> 00:59:51,750
And I'll do it...

888
00:59:51,833 --> 00:59:54,166
...right before your eyes.
