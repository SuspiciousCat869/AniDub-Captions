happened in there?

And why would both

[WANG LING]
Water leak. They fell.

[SUN RONG] Chen fell so hard, it
knocked the spirit out of him.

Hold on, where are you going?

After I escape, should I take
out Zhuo Yi? Or my sis?

Actually, I'm coming
for you, Sun Rong.

Alright.

Remember to watch out
for the ghoulish hand!

Master, what's that
demon up to?

She's not really
helping Sun, is she?

numerous members of the demon
race on his way to the west.

to the Moon shattered and
the fragments fell to earth.

This is the Mirror
of Moon Bridge.

It was forged using those
pieces, or so they say.
