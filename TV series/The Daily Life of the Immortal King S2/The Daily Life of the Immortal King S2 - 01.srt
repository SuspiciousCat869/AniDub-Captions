00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:06,130
Hey, guys. Do you feel
like we're being watched?

00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:07,430
[ALL]
Huh?

3
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,630
[WANG LING]
This is our secret. Promise?

4
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,430
[SUN RONG gasps]

5
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,300
[XU JIAN]
He's only a primary phase.

6
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:30,970
How can he have so much power?

7
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,380
Wait, what? Reversing the
timeline goes against nature!

8
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,010
I wouldn't do that!

9
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,090
[WANG LING] I'm not you
and it doesn't matter.

10
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,760
[SUN RONG] Besides, I believe
that my feelings for you

11
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,720
transcend time and space.

12
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,340
So no matter how the
timeline is altered,

13
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,630
it'll bring me back to you.

[FATHER WANG grunting]
Lingling...

16
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,590
Thank God I made it in time,

17
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,510
otherwise the world would
have been destroyed!

18
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,180
[FROGGY 2 sighs]
You finally got your amulet.

19
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,970
With it, the world is saved.

20
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:38,590
But you've broken
the laws of nature.

21
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,760
You were reckless and now
nothing will ever be the same.

22
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,050
By restarting the
world so many times,

23
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,930
you've triggered an
unmeasurable decline

24
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,630
in its total spiritual force.

25
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,760
[WANG LING sighs] Why's it so
hard to save the world?

26
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,430
Morning, Chief.

27
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:13,550
We caught Liuying and
she'll be in jail soon.

28
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,010
[CHIEF A]
Hm. Thank you, Master Zhuo.

29
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,470
Because of your
tireless efforts,

30
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,590
we eliminated the
Shadow Faction.

31
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,180
[ZHUO YI]
My pleasure.

32
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,090
Although, one mystery remains.
Who hired them to kill Sun Rong?

33
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,010
We're still looking.

34

[phone rings]

35
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:36,180
[CHIEF A]
Hello? Hm? The Competition?

36
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,260
Yes, I understand.

37
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,630
[CHIEF A] That's not good.
You catch any of that?

38
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,130
[ZHUO YI]
More assassins?

39
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,380
[CHIEF A] No. The space station
detected a spiritual force

00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:51,050
tsunami that spawned from
Faction Fifty-nine's arena.

41
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:54,300
Gross National Spiritual
Force Product has fallen.

42
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,970
Spirit energy vehicles
are losing power.

43
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,300
[ZHUO YI]
Do we know why?

44
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:01,050
[CHIEF A] We don't.
We're still investigating.

45
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,880
But my superiors aren't happy

46
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,970
and they're putting a lot of
pressure on us to figure it out.

47
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:09,130
You're kidding. That bad?

48
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,590
[FEMALE ANALYST A] The world's
force value has dropped

49
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,090
to four point eight.
That's way too low.

50
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,510
Is there a way we can fix it?

51
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,630
[FEMALE ANALYST B]
Liking and subscribing

52
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,930
should give it a signal boost.

53
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:22,380
[ZHUO YI] I'm on it. We're gonna
get to the bottom of this.

54
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,590
[CHIEF A]
Wait, before you go,

55
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,720
I need you to call off
the Sword Competition.

56
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,050
[ZHUO YI]
Huh?

57
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,340
[MALE STUDENT A sighs]
Man, this freakin' sucks.

58
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,090
We pulled ahead of Faction
Fifty-nine in the prelims.

59
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,760
If it wasn't canceled, we would
have actually made the finals.

60
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,970
[FEMALE STUDENT A]
True.

61
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,800
At least we made it
into the Top Ten, right?

62
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,760
[MALE STUDENT A]
Yeah, I guess and that was even

63
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,180
with a Value Five on the team.

64
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,630
He hasn't said much
since the competition.

65
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,590
Wonder what's wrong?

66
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,930
He usually doesn't
have that many lines.

67
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:04,590
[SUN RONG sighs]
I hope he's alright.

68
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,220
I wish I could help him.

69
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,550
He's been like this
ever since we won.

[NARRATOR] Wang Ling is simply
trying to enjoy the splendors

00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,300
of his quiet daily life.

72
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,130
But unbeknownst to him,

is already turning.

[PAN SHENGCONG]
Hm. Very good.

77
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:36,510
It seems everyone has turned in
their summer vacation homework.

78
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:39,130
That's what I'd expect
from Class Elite.

79
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:44,010
[sighs] Glad I was able to knock
it out last night, but I'm beat.

80
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,800
[PAN SHENGCONG] And, although
I believe that each of you

81
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,550
have worked exhaustively over
the summer, our curriculum

82
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,050
suggests that you
should have reached

83
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:52,840
the intermediate
foundation phase by now.

84
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:55,800
In the past, we lacked proper
academic disciplines.

85
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,430
After beating
Faction Fifty-nine,

86
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:00,930
the Department of Education has
focused their attention on us.

87
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,680
So today, we will hold
a Spiritual Force Test.

88
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,220
Anyone who fails to
qualify as intermediate

89
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,970
will be expelled
from Class Elite.

from Class Ordinary

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,590
who do well on the test will be
transferred to Class Elite.

93
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,590
It's out with the old and in
with the new, as they say.

94
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,510
Huh? I'm confused, have none
of you reached the next phase?

95
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:31,470
[CHEN CHAO chuckles] Unlike you,
not everyone has the talent,

96
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,970
or family background
to lean on.

97
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:37,970
I worked my butt off all summer
and only just broke through.

98
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,220
Sounds about right.

99
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,050
Clearly everyone else
was lazy on vacation.

some Mercy Palms this summer.

Maybe they can help you
with your breakthrough.

so we'll start with one.

[SUN RONG]
Hold it right there!

112

Forcing a breakthrough
could damage his meridians.

Heh! Well, that's how I did it
all summer and I'm just fine!

for status, not strength.

Ahem. So that test, huh?

to help you...

to make foundation pills.

We'll work together
like we did before!

130
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,260
Make a handful of
these pills, then boom!

131
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,760
We take a couple of
'em and our energy

132
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,680
will be supercharged
for an hour!

133

I mean, that's long
enough to pass!

because you didn't level up?

If I get expelled from Class

they're gonna break every bone
in my body! Help, please!

If we can just make those
foundation pills, we'll pass!

Ahem. Phase two students,

148
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,680
you may now enter the field.

149
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,800
The Spiritual Force
test will begin now.

150
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,470
Since I can't find the dog
we were planning to use,

151
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:11,300
we'll be utilizing the Doomsday
protocol for today's test.

152
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,880
The student whose
number is called

153
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:16,430
will need to stand in the center
of the formation on the stage.

154
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:19,680
And then, concentrate
their force.

155
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,930
The formation will automatically
adjust its power

156
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:25,090
based on the strength
of the student's energy.
