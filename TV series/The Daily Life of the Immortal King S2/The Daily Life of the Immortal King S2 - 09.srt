00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:18,410
Hello, welcome to
my livestream,

185
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:22,160
and thank you for being here.

186
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:28,030
As many of you may know, I grew
up in a very prominent family.

187
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,530
When I was little,

188
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:32,530
I thought it was normal to
be the center of attention.

189
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:35,490
It wasn't until I enrolled
at Faction Sixty

190
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:38,820
that I realized the world
didn't revolve around me

191
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:41,610
and that I wasn't the
perfect daughter.

192
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:47,070
So I worked hard to improve
myself until we went broke,

193
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,450
and I sunk into a
profound depression.

194
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:54,820
Suddenly, I realized the things
I had taken for granted

195
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:58,450
my whole life were the
most valuable of all.

196
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:00,700
And then it became
clear to me.

197
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:06,070
People were only drawn to me
because of my family's status.

198
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,860
I just wanted everyone's love.

199

To get that validation,

200
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,950
I entered the
Sword Arts Contest.

201
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:17,360
And for reasons
beyond my control,

202
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:20,990
I got the love of
the entire world.

But, now I understand.

need all of your love.
