1
00:00:17,125 --> 00:00:20,416
[EMILIA] Hm! Today is field day.
Let's do our best!

2
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,666
[ALL]
Yeah!

3
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:53,041
[ALL chattering]

4
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:54,958
[YUNYUN]
I finally found you!

5
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:55,916
[ALL]
Huh?

6
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,083
[KAZUMA]
Whoa, it's Yunyun!

7
00:01:57,166 --> 00:02:00,083
Megumin, our duel
goes down today!

8
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:02,500
Now who is this chick?
She a friend of yours?

9
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:05,666
I've never seen her before.
She's clearly delusional.

10
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,583
[YUNYUN] How could you
just forget who I am?

11
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:09,166
We've been rivals
our entire lives!

12
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,666
So. What do you want, huh?

13
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,583
Oh, yeah. Um... Ahem.

14
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:18,875
You think you're hot stuff,
well I've got news for you.

15
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:20,791
Class three will win
and you'll lose.

16
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:23,458
[KAZUMA]
So there's a class three? Huh!

17
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:24,375
Yunyun.

18
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,166
[YUNYUN]
Yeah?

19
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,625
You're gonna win? Tell me this.

20
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:31,083
What exactly happens at a
field day thing like this?

21
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:32,916
[YUNYUN gasps]
You and all of your friends

22
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,958
in the class work together to
compete in different kinds of--

23
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:37,166
So where are these
"friends in class" you speak of?

24
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,416
You don't seem to have any.

25
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,083
Oh yes, I do!
They're just, uh...

26
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:43,333
They decided to send me
out to pick up some, uh...

27
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:45,166
...yakisoba sandwiches
so we can eat together!

28
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,958
Oh, come on! Just admit
you're alone, would ya'?

29
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:50,750
Sorry, but I have
some questions.

30
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,250
[GROUP]
Huh?

31
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:55,166
It's just. Why'd they
send you? It seems weird.

32
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,583
Are they making you buy it?

33
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:58,500
[SUBARU]
Emilia-pro tip. Just stop.

34
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:00,125
[FELT]
What's going on, dude?

35
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,291
[ALL]
Huh?

36
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:05,333
[SUBARU] Hey, it's Felt!
And, ugh, Julius.

37
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:06,833
I hate to break it to ya,

38
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:09,666
but you're all gonna be eating
class one's dust today!

39
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,625
"Ugh?" That's how you greet me?

40
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:14,833
Come now. Let us try to conduct
ourselves like true knights.

41
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:17,000
I kinda already wanna
crotch punch this dude.

42
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:19,166
Kinda his superpower.

43
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,041
I humbly beg forgiveness,
Lord Ains.

44
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:26,291
When I initially agreed
to enter this contest,

45
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:29,416
I had no idea we'd be
facing as adversaries.

46
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,000
[AINS]
Pay it no mind.

47
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,708
Although your purpose
as the Pleiades,

48
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:36,375
my combat maids, is to shield
me from harm in our world.

49
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:40,583
We now find ourselves in another
world, and on opposite sides.

50
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,291
I won't ask you to hold back.

51
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:43,708
To be clear,

52
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,708
I will say this battle is
nothing more than a farce.

53
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,666
Regardless, we must
strive for excellence

54
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,583
no matter the situation.

55
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,958
[AUREOLE] I appreciate
your encouragement, My Lord.

56
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,375
[MOMONGA]
It's like the team fights we did

57
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,708
in the guild way back when.

58
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:58,250
[AUREOLE] You should
be aware of something.

59
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,750
[AINS]
Hm.

60
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,791
Our class... has a
particular member

61
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,916
that you definitely
need to watch out for.

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
[AINS]
That would be Reinhard, yes?

63
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:08,625
I've heard tell of his
incredible abilities.

64
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:11,666
[AUREOLE] Yes. I'm sure he's
no match for you, My Lord,

65
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,833
but I wanted you
to be forewarned.

66
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:17,041
[AINS] Thank you.
I'll be watching him.

67
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,625
[GRANTZ] Okay, now a word
from the students.

68
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:25,291
[KAZUMA] Wait, why is
she the one up there?

69
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:28,500
[EMILIA] Well, she kind
of insisted on it.

70
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:31,166
Attention, everyone!
Hear my words!

71
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,791
The dark cloud of oppression
has been lifted as if--

72
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,458
[DEMIURGE]
Is everybody okay?

73
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:37,541
[BEATRICE]
This is the easy part.

74
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:40,166
[AURA]
The awesome part!

75
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:40,958
[VISHA grunts]

76
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:42,208
[AUREOLE]
Excellent.

77
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:45,708
[REM]
Shalltear. what's the matter?

78
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:48,875
[GRANTZ]
Wait!

79
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:49,791
[ALBEDO]
I wait for no man.

80
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:50,833
[RAM]
Same!

81
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:52,833
[ALL gasp]

82
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,208
[COCYTUS]
Good game.

83
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,000
[REINHARD] That's my divine
"tug of war" protection.

84
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:58,458
[SUBARU] No way!
That can't be a real thing!

85
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:03,166
I'll use "steal" and boom,
all your balls are belong to us.

86
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,666
Why didn't it work on 'em?

87
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,958
[REINHARD] That's my divine,
"no stealing" protection.

88
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,000
[SUBARU]
Okay, that one might be real!

89
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,041
[AINS]
We're still trailing class one.

90
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,250
That guy! Could he
be more infuriating?

91
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:16,833
I warned you, didn't I?

92
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,750
Reinhard's on a
whole other level.

93
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:22,333
[ROSWAAL] Seems like you're
in a bit of jam here, class.

94
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:23,750
[SUBARU]
Oh, it's Mister Rozzie.

95
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,625
You can all unfurrow your brows,

96
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,625
the cavalry match is
your second chance.

97
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:30,541
Victory can still be yours.

98
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:33,458
[CZ] In the final game
of today's event...

99
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:37,750
...the winner will receive
one hundred million points.

100
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,000
See?

101
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,875
[ALL] Then why did we do
all that other stuff?

102
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:47,875
I have full faith that you will
claim victory once more,

103
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:48,791
My Lord.

104
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,750
[AINS]
Mm. We will not lose.

105
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:52,791
Good luck. You can do this!

106
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:56,041
Yes. I'll show them what an
imperial solider can do.

107
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,250
You've got this.
I believe in you.

108
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,958
Be careful. Don't push
yourself to hard.

109
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,083
Hey, don't worry, okay?

110
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:04,625
[MEGUMIN] You'll probably
just get in the way,

111
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:06,833
but please try not drag the
other guys down too much.

112
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,666
[DARKNESS] Kazuma, go out
there like a horse,

113
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,750
flailing in the mud.
Maybe you'll get stepped on,

114
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:12,291
like a piece of trash
on the ground.

115
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,333
Ooh, now I'm starting
to get jealous!

116
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:15,666
[AQUA]
Well, I'm tired.

117
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,250
So don't keep wasting our
time and wrap this up.

118
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,750
Would saying,
"good luck" kill ya?

119
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:24,041
Okay guys, let's go!

120
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,083
[JULIUS, REINHARD, CHRIS]
Right!

121
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:29,166
[KAZUMA]
Hang on. Where's class three?

122
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,083
Is it just Yunyun
all by herself?

123
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:34,416
Quite staring off
into space! Look alive!

124
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,416
Sorry!

125
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,875
Are you ready! On to victory!

126
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:39,000
[KAZUMA, AINS, SUBARU]
Yeah!

127
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,208
[KAZUMA, SUBARU pant]

128
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:47,125
You really surprised me, dude.

129
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:48,708
I appreciate that!

130
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:50,625
Now if you'd surprise
me by giving us a win,

131
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:52,208
I'd appreciate that even more.

132
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:53,458
Sorry, Subaru.

133
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,750
You have to realize that
is simply not an option.

134
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,833
You can't escape the
stink of failure.

135
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,541
You should know that.

136
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,666
[YUNYUN pants]

137
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,666
[MEGUMIN]
Yunyun?

138
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,208
[YUNYUN]
Yeah?

139
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:07,875
How come you're not with all
your "friends" in class three?

140
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:10,208
Earlier you swore that
you had a bunch of them.

141
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:11,750
Of course I do!

142
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:14,541
There's no one else in your
class even participating today.

143
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,541
I'm starting to believe
there is no class three,

144
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,375
and you just made up the
whole thing for some reason.

145
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:19,958
[COCYTUS]
Shut up.

146
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:22,500
Let's face it, there's no way
we'll win a straight-up fight,

147
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:26,041
but maybe we can split them up
and deal with them one-on-one.

148
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:26,875
Hey, Ains.

149
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,250
[AINS]
Hm.

150
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:29,791
[SUBARU]
Can you handle Reinhard?

151
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:33,875
[AINS] That's quite the
responsibility. I won't fail!

152
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,750
Right, sounds like a plan.

153
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:38,958
[CZ] Now, an announcement
that's sure to shock you.

154
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,416
Joining us for this last event,

155
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,500
will be a team made up by
our teachers. Don't forget,

156
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:47,625
this round is worth
one-hundred million points.

157
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,083
So whoever wins this,

158
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,333
will be the ultimate
victors of field day.

159
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:52,375
[SUBARU]
Mister Rozzie?!

160
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:53,166
Hi.

161
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,375
[KAZUMA]
Vanir?!

162
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,250
What's wrong?
Has this sudden change

163
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,750
filled your heart with
overwhelming dread?

164
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,041
[TANYA]
Mr. Rerugen?

165
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:01,833
Why me? This is hell.

166
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:04,416
[MOMONGA] Oh man, I was
afraid he'd show up here.

167
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,958
[AINS]
Pandora's Actor!

168
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:08,375
[PANDORA'S ACTOR]
Father!

169
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:09,125
[KAZUMA, TANYA, SUBARU]
Father?

170
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:10,375
[AINS]
No!

171
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,458
You understand now, kids?

172
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:15,875
There is only one road to
victory, and that is through us!

173
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:17,375
[AINS]
But you're our teacher.

174
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,791
You can't just work with us
to help us get back home?

175
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:23,541
[ROSWAAL] Think of this
as a lesson, a final exam!

176
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:27,750
Give us all you've got
and don't dare hold back!

177
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,000
Not a fan of this.

178
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:31,375
To have one's duel
interrupted in such a way.

179
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,000
This knight takes great umbrage.

180
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,333
Well. I think we're all
on the same page here.

181
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:37,291
Yeah. Hey, Reinhard!

182
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,791
I know where you're going.

183
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:42,208
Subaru. I suggest an alliance
between our classes.

184
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,583
Let's combine our strengths.

185
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,416
[ALL gasp]

186
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,166
[FELT]
Don't get the wrong idea.

187
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,000
First we'll team up
to beat the teachers,

188
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,458
then we'll be free to duke
it out between ourselves!

189
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:52,500
[SUBARU]
Whoa.

190
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:54,333
[CHRIS] Okay, Kazuma.
You with me?

191
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:55,625
I'm counting on you!

192
00:08:55,708 --> 00:09:00,666
Oh, well uh, yeah! I'm in!
Guys, let's do this!

193
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,625
[ALL]
Yeah!

194
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:02,375
[AQUA grunts]

195
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,916
What's the matter?

196
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,916
Just kinda starting to feel
like my position's in jeopardy.

197
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,625
[AURA, MARE chuckle]

198
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:12,916
[ROSWAAL] Hmm, we seem to be
in quite a pickle, boys.

199
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,125
These teams are both chock
full of big, brazen souls.

200
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,375
I suppose we'll just have
to kick it up a notch,

201
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,916
and show these children that
we're not just playing around.

202
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,333
Come forth,
my faithful servants!

203
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,541
[KAZUMA] Watch out, those things
will explode on you!

204
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:28,583
[AINS] I don't care! We'll go
straight for our target!

205
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,791
Greater teleportation!

206
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,875
\Got you now!

207
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,875
[PANDORA'S ACTOR gasps]
Lord Ains!

208
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:39,541
Must we, as father and son,
come to blows like this?

209
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,333
[ALBEDO]
You are not his son!

210
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,750
[PANDORA'S ACTOR]
Transform!

And now, we've got you!

00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,125
[gasps]

216
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:58,791
[SUBARU]

00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,791
Unleash Al Clauselia!

218
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:03,083
[ERICH grunts]
That light is so bright!

219
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:03,750

00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,416
I got one, you guys!

222
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,500
[KAZUMA]
Thanks, Chris!

223
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:14,083
[ROSWAAL]
Oh no!

224
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:15,416
[CHRIS gasps]

225
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,166
Well done class! A real
show of teamwork at work!

226
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,000
I had no doubt that our brave
students would charge headlong

227
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:25,125
at their enemy! So full of fire!
So sure of their victory!

228
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,166
[PANDORA'S ACTOR] But! If you
think this fight is over,

229
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,375
I admonish you rapscallions
to think again!

230
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:34,791
[TEACHERS]
Formation Quartet! Go!

231
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:38,208
[TANYA] Is that even allowed?
And FYI, that is a trio!

232
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:42,833
Alright. Today's ultimate
battle starts now!

233
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:45,083
[VANIR laughs]

234
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:48,708
[ERICH] Hey, will you please
stop that? Thank you! Quit it!

235
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,625
I'll admit guys,
that's too much.

236
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:53,791
Tell me something.

237
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,166
Yeah?

238
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,916
Do you feel kinda sorry for
Mister Rerugen, or no?

239
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,833
I wouldn't wanna be him.

240
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:02,333
[KURT]
Interesting.

241
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:05,833
Seems the teachers are
at a slight disadvantage.

242
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:09,583
It does. Shall we
send it in, then?

243
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:13,625
Send it in? Let's see how
the students handle this.

244
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,666
Won't be easy.

245
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,458
[HANS]
Pushing the button.

246

247
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,875
Careful, Lord Ains!

248
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:45,208
Hey! Wait!
What the hell is that?

249
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,000
No way!

250
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,625
[DARKNESS, MEGUMIN]
The mobile fortress.

251
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,291
Not the (bleep) Destroyer!

252
00:11:53,958 --> 00:12:00,000
[ROSWAAL] And now. Time for the
main event, boys and girls!
