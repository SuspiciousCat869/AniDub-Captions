00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:14,750
[ROSWAAL]
Field day is coming, everybody!

2
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:17,916
[SUBARU] Mr. Ros-chi, we
literally just had a field trip

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,416
for that test of courage,
and now it's time for field day?

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,208
Like, I don't understand
the schedule.

5
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:24,125
[ROSWAAL]
Huh? You don't get it, do you?

6
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:25,458
This entire world is bizarre,

7
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:27,333
and you pick the schedule
to be confused about?

8
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:28,791
Sure, it's weird, but still--

9
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:30,250
Now, now.

10
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,125
Let's not get bogged down
with all the minutiae--

11
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:34,375
just work together and win!

12
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:36,500
And what exactly
is the incentive here?

13
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:38,708
[ROSWAAL]
Let me see...

14
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:41,250
As I recall, the prize is
returning to your home world.

15
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:45,458
--[gasping]
--[ROSWAAL] But don't quote me!

16
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:47,958
How can we work together
if we're in competition?

17
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:50,416
I mean, we're the only
ones here, as far as I know.

18
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,458
It's not like
there's another cla--

19
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:53,250
--[ROSWAAL] But, there is...
--Huh?

20
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:54,375
There's another classroom

21
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:57,375
--right next door, you see!
--[gasps]

22

23
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:05,583
Huh?!

24
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:39,583
[SUBARU]
Wh-- Is that Reinhard?

25
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:43,208
[VANIR laughs] You there,
with the nasty stink face!

26
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:44,583
Huh?

27
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,250
While I do enjoy watching
your eyes bulge out

28
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,250
of your head in astonishment,

29
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:49,791
I would greatly appreciate it
if you wouldn't

30
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:51,333
disrupt my instruction.

31
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:53,125
Who the hell is that freak show?

32
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:54,958
Right, back to class.

33
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,208
We've got much more to learn
before the day is done!

34
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:59,791
[SUBARU] Call me crazy, but I
swear this wasn't here before.

35
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:01,125
[AINS]
Do you remember it?

36
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:03,666
No. I know it didn't
exist before today.

37
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,833
[ROSWAAL] There's no
choice but to accept it.

38
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:08,166
After all, that's
how this world works.

39
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,541
[school bell chimes]

40
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:10,666
[SUBARU]
So, yeah, we're calling them

41
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,333
"Class 1" now, apparently.

42
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:14,666
I recognized some of
them from my last world.

43
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,708
[AINS] Yes, my combat maids,
the Pleiades, were in there.

44
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:18,916
"Combat maids," eh?

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,500
Don't you think that's
a little much, dude?

46
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:21,791
[AINS] This from the
guy with demon maids

47
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,625
hanging off him most the time.

48
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:24,791
At least we know
something about

49
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:26,166
our field day enemy.

50
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,000
After all, the class appears
to consist of a handful

51
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,791
of familiar people from
our respective worlds.

52
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,583
Therefore, the situation here

53
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,666
is not totally fixed--
rather, it seems to be

54
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,125
--somewhat in a state of flux.
--[AINS] Yes.

55
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,500
All right. We must
win the field day.

56
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,208
The mystery of Class 1
is irrelevant.

57
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:42,750
Winning is all that matters.

58
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:46,000
[AINS] Correct. That is, if what
Mister Roswaal said is true,

59
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,708
and we do get to return
to our home worlds

60
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,333
if we win the field day.

61
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,041
[SUBARU]
So, this means...

62
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,625
...if we want to
get out of here...

63
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:54,208
...we have to beat Class 1.

64
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:55,291
Question, Ains.

65
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:57,000
How does their
strength match up?

66
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:58,333
[AINS]
I will say this.

67
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:00,916
The Pleiades will be
easy to defeat.

68
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,708
I am not sure about
the others, though.

69
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:04,000
Subaru, what do you know?

70
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,708
[SUBARU]
Well, um, I have some bad news

71
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:07,083
about that guy you just saw.

72
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:08,208
Reinhard is his name.

73
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,041
The goofy one with the red hair?

74
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:13,166
Sadly, he's probably the
strongest person in my world.

75
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,083
--[AINS] Hmm...
--[TANYA groans]

76
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,000
[SUBARU] Where I come from,
there's this kind of overpowered

77
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:19,541
ability called
"divine protection."

78
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,083
Maybe you've heard of it.

79
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:23,166
But that dude's got
the skill in spades.

80
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,500
[AINS]
Divine protection?

81
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,250
Seems different from
the skills and martial arts

82
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,958
that exist in my world.

83
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:30,250
What specific types of divine
protection does he have?

84
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,208
Oh, man, where do I start?

85
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:33,583
He automatically
dodges any attack

86
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,625
he's never seen before,
and he automatically dodges

87
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,000
pretty much all
other attacks, too.

88
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,250
There's also a rumor
that, if he dies,

89
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:39,666
he can just come back to life.

90
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,041
Auto-dodge for long-range
attacks, and 100% accuracy

91
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:42,500
for all ranged attacks.

92
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:43,916
Total immunity to shamanic
spells, buffs, and debuffs.

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,500
--And elemental attacks...
--[AINS] Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

94
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:47,833
If he auto-dodges first attacks,
and attacks he's never seen--

95
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,041
so, all attacks, really--

96
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,625
and he can come back to life,

97
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,875
how exactly are you
supposed to beat him?

98
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,291
Hell if I know.

99
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:58,041
And also, he's got
a "Riding" divine protection?

100
00:04:58,125 --> 00:04:59,708
Does that mean there's
no possible way for us

101
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:01,500
to win the final round?

102
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:02,916

105

supposed to know?

Whoa, Chris! What's going on?

I'm not sure!

110
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,166
I was minding my own business,
when all of a sudden--

111
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,041
Bam, I got summoned
to this world!

112
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:21,250
Is that what happened to you?

113
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,666
Well, uh, yeah, we just
kinda woke up here.

114
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,833
Oh, right, so...
I have some bad news.

115
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:28,000
[KAZUMA]
Huh?

116
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:29,250
In this world, if you die,

117
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:30,958
you can't be revived
for some reason.

118
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,291
So be careful.

119
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:33,416
Seriously?

120
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,833

Seriously.

121
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:37,083
That's the worst news
I've heard in a while, Chris!

122
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,250
Why isn't Eris doing something
about the situation, huh?

123
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,833
Uh, actually...

124
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:44,541
Eris can't really do anything
about it, unfortunately. So...

125
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:47,833
Huh...? Hold on, why are you so
eager to come to her defense?

128
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:52,500
--want to talk about her, 'kay?

Ah-choo!

Oh, are you feeling all right?

135
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,125
Ooh, Somebody out there
must be gossiping about the fact

136
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,750
that Shalltear's boobs are fake.

137
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,875
I don't speak dumb,
what'd you say?

[wails]

139
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:17,708
Uh, anyway, we may be rivals,
but thought you should know.

140
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:18,958
It's the truth.

141
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,666
When you die, you can't
be brought back to life.

142
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,666
So, like, all I'm saying is,
be careful, okay?

143
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,833
Something wrong?

144
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,458
[SUBARU]
Nothing.

145
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,333
[SUBARU] Does this mean that
my "Return by Death" spell

146
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:29,833
won't work?

147
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:33,625
In my old world, I just went
back to the last save point.

148
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:35,333
But if that's not
the case in this world,

149
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:36,625
bad news for me.

150
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,875
If I die, it's over.

151
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:41,500
Though, to be fair,
I hated dying in the old world.

152
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:42,958
[TANYA]
Hmm?

153
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:44,750
[SUBARU] Yikes, I said one
of the quiet parts out loud.

154
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:47,083
I should be more careful
what I say here.

155
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:48,708
Or, I could do a test.

156
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:50,541
[SUBARU] Humor me for
a second and cover your ears.

157
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:51,625
Huh?

158
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:54,333
When I die, I--

159
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:55,500
[gasps]

160
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:04,333
[SUBARU]
Bad idea.

161
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,916
At least I'm not dead!

162
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,708
[SUBARU] But I still had
to suffer the penalty.

163
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:11,375
Huh?

164
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:13,666
[AURA] I'm really sorry
about this, Lord Ains!

165
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,041
[AINS] What exactly are
those two doing here?

166
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,958
I sincerely apologize
for the intrusion, sir.

167
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,416
They got all excited
out of nowhere

168
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,791
and just started
running this way.

169
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,333
[AINS]
Yes, but, why?

170
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:27,000
I, uh, have a
feeling that might've

171
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,750
been my fault, actually.

172
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,000
[TANYA]
Uh?

173
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,583
I've got this ability
that has the side effect

174
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,250
of attracting mabeasts.

175
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,583
But I had no idea it could
work on the undead, too.

176
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:36,833
That's cool.

177
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:39,500
[AINS]
Is it some kind of curse?

178
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,500
[SUBARU]
Yeah, it is.

179
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:44,583
It appears we both have problems
with annoying curses, huh?

180
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,125
[SUBARU]
Both of us?

181
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,458
I'd love to hear more about
that, but first things first--

182
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,416
Can you please get this
Bad Hamster to stop

183
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,083
gnawing on my noggin?

184
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,166
[AINS]
So, as you can see,

185
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,875
if we all really want to go
back to our worlds, we must do

186
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:01,208
everything we possibly can
to win the field day.

187
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:03,666
[KAZUMA]
I vote no.

188
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,875
I'm actually happier
here than my home world.

189
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,791
So, I have no incentive to win.

190
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:10,208
That's so typical.
Of course you would say that.

191
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:11,375
We want to go home.

192
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:12,833
Yeah, jeez, Kazuma!

193
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:14,500
Have you forgotten that you
still need to go back home

194
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:16,000
and defeat the Demon King?

195
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,583
There's no way I can
defeat the Demon King,

196
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,166
so why can't I just stay
here where it's safe,

197
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,083
--doing what I want?!
--[COCYTUS] Impossible.

198
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,416
Uh?

199
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,416
[COCYTUS] You're in the
presence of Lord Ains.

200
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,541
Defeat will not be permitted.

201
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,083
[KAZUMA]
I mean, good point, I guess?

202
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,875
[TANYA]
Yeah, I agree.

203
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:31,541
No one ever charges
into battle with

204
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,458
the intention of losing the war.

205
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:35,416
If we're going to participate
in this field day,

206
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,375
we should give it
everything we've got.

207
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:38,541
Isn't that right?

208
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:41,833
Yeah, Subaru.
Let's try to win this thing!

209
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,291
Then I'll try
my hardest, too,

210
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:44,458
if only for my brother's sake.

211
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:45,541
[PUCK laughs]

212
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,375
Do your best so
I don't have to, Barusu.

213
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,791
One of us is a lazy,
good-for-nothing bum.

214
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,125
But the rest of us will fight!

215
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,166
[EMILIA gasps]

216
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,208
[KAZUMA]
Ugh, fine. If I have to.

217
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:57,416
I'll work my hardest to
make sure my classmates win

218
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,708
the field day--

219
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,875
Is something you'll
never hear from my mouth!

220
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,083
Please, not a chance in hell!

221
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,291
I'm lazy!

222
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,083
That's a core value
I will never compromise!

223
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,250
Kazuma! You're a bigger
scumbag than I thought!

224
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:09,041
Yeah, and I take
great pride in that.

225
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:10,041
[TANYA]
Shut your mouth.

226
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,333
[KAZUMA]
Huh?

227
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,708
Although, I respect
your consistent values.

228
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:16,208
If you're unwilling to put forth
any effort of your own accord,

229
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:17,500
then we'll help you.

230
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,500
A little hard work can fix that.

231
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:22,958
The 203rd Aerial Mage Battalion
will instruct you.

232
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,375
Our special training course
will surely transform you into

233

--the ultimate super soldier!
--Wait, what? What's that mean?

235
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,916
Yes, at your service!

236
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,833
Hold on, what are
the shovels for?

237

That's right, keep running!

241
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,750
You gonna cry?

242
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,458
I hope so, 'cause that
way we can all laugh

244
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:50,666
So, am I doing this right?

245
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,125
Yeah, great job. Thanks a lot.

246
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:55,500
We've got a ways to go, though.

247
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,500
Looks like you've still
got a lot of energy left!

248
00:09:57,583 --> 00:10:01,833
Excellent! I thought you
were lazy, what happened?

He might be
starting to slow down.

250
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,916
Maybe it's time to take
things to a new level?

'Kay, I'll hit him
with something special.

[KAZUMA screamin]

254
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,541
I can't contain myself.

255
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:16,750
I have to help!

Hey, sis, doesn't
that look like fun?

260
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,083
Heck yeah, for sure!

261
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:29,333
Well, then, it's official--
I'm terrified of her.

262
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:31,291
[AINS] That's a testament
to your intelligence.

263
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:32,541
I agree.

264
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,625
I mean, this is quite a ruckus.

265
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:37,250
Just so you know,
nobody says "ruckus" anymore.

266

[KAZUMA] Will you guys cut
the crap and make her stop?!
