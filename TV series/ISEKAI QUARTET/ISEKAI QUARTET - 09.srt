[KAZUMA]
Hi, friends. How is everyone?

2
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:17,875
Here I am, stuck in
a strange world,

3
00:00:17,958 --> 00:00:21,416
forced to go to school
with these freaks.

4
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,166
And it totally rules!

5
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:57,500
Hey, you guys?

6
00:01:57,583 --> 00:01:58,875
Yeah?

7
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:01,833
I'm starting to suspect that
we might be in Valhalla.

8
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:03,291
I agree.

9
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:05,291
Have you ever seen
such beautiful girls?

10
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,458
Surely not in the Empire.

11
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:10,416
No way. Never.

12
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,041
Perhaps we're finally being
rewarded for our efforts.

13
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:15,416
The years of suffering
on the battlefield.

14
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,625
Let's have fun! The time
for celebration is here!

15
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:19,333
[COCYTUS] Drop and give
me a thousand pushups.

[BOYS grunting]

17
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:22,458
[WEISS]
Why is this happening to us?

18
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:24,583
[NEUMANN]
What'd we do?

19
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:26,666
[COCYTUS] As members
of the gym committee,

20
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,416
you must be the example
of fitness for everyone.

[DARKNESS pants]

22
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:32,375
That all you boys got?

23
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:35,166
This doesn't even count
as exercise. Not in my book!

24
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,875
[COCYTUS]
Impressive, great example.

25
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:40,291
Agreed. Really great.

26
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:43,000
Yeah. She's not even
getting tired.

27
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:44,916
Well, sure, but that's
not quite what I meant.

28
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,708
[WEISS]
Huh?

29
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,250
I mean, just look at them.

30
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,833
[DARKNESS continues panting]

31
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:52,916
[WEISS] Yeah, keep going.
Work those things out.

32
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,291
[NEUMANN] Yeah. Or maybe
just bust them out instead.

33
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:57,916
[DARKNESS]
I can sense them ogling me.

34
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,166
It's like they're molesting
me with their eyes!

35
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,083
Those men, staring at my body,
imagining all the depraved

36
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:06,041
things they'd do to me.
They're like a pack of wolves!

37
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:08,166
What will happen to me if
they decide to try something?

38
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,000
My arms will be too
tired to defend myself,

39
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,708
and I'll be completely
at their mercy!

40
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:14,291
What will happen
to me then, huh?!

41
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,458
[COCYTUS]
I feel like I missed something.

42
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:20,333
What scumbags.

43
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:21,833
Got that right.

00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:25,833
[SUBARU] Hey, there, sis!
Working hard or hardly working?

45
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:27,750
[SUBARU gasps]
Who could look that miserable

46
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,291
while they're setting
up for a barbecue?

47
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,625
They're supposed to be fun.

48
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:33,083
You've got it wrong.
I like barbecues.

49
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,666
I'm the furthest thing
from miserable,

50
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,291
and this workload
is a piece of cake.

--Go be wrong somewhere else.
--[SUBARU] Don't lie!

Okay, are you
even working, Barusu?

54
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:44,041
Oh, sorry, do you see any
animals on this field trip

55
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,666
that need looking after?
Thought not. So, instead,

56
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,125
I'm checking in with the
humans to see who needs help.

57
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,000
You mean hassling people.

58
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:54,041
As usual, you've just proven
you're a useless waste of space.

59
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,208
I knew you were gonna say that.

60
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,291
--[VISHA] Pardon.
--[SUBARU] Huh?

61
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,791
Your name is Subaru, right?

62
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:03,041
No, no. Barusu.

63
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:05,708
Natsuki Subaru?

64
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:07,291
Correct. Barusu.

65

[SUBARU]
Will you stop?

66
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,833
Can't you see you're
confusing the poor girl?

[KAZUMA]
My eyes! My eyes!

69
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:19,208
That's what you get for staring
at girls in their swimsuits

70
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:21,583
like a perv. Your job is
to enforce the rules,

71
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:22,666
not break them yourself.

72
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,916
But, that was just mean!

73
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:30,041
[KAZUMA chuckles]
Stealth. A useful skill.

74
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:32,000
And now... I peep.

75
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,541
Summer is my favorite.

00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,333
[DEMIURGE] What exactly
do you think you're doing?

77
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:37,166
[KAZUMA]
Uh?

78
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,791
And, flash!

You didn't have to blind me
for peeping on the ladies!

Thank you for your cooperation.

82

[KAZUMA]
Will you listen to me?

83
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,750
My pleasure. I'm just glad
you were so swift to act.

00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,333
Saved the day.

85
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,458
Oh, don't be foolish. I couldn't
have done it without your help.

86
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,750
Ains is lucky to have a
subordinate like you.

87

like I'm intruding.

anyone is coming.

lollygagging, move it please!

Nicely done. You barely
seemed scared at all.

Of course we weren't scared.

117
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,458
The moment Ains and I got
assigned to different teams,

118
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,666
the exercise became
totally pointless.

That may be true for you, but
you can't speak for the others.

I mean. Not to be rude,

but our old world was a whole
lot scarier than this forest.

Well. It wasn't
our world, per se.

the scariest part of it.

Tanya, wait! Stop it! Please!

159
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,916
[TANYA] Don't try and
get in my way, Ains.

160
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,916
Tanya, you're really
starting to scare me!

161
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,708
Oh, frightening you, am I?

162
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,458
A god like Being X
getting scared?

163
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:58,958
Well, that's just pathetic.

164
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:00,500
[AQUA] You keep saying that
"Being X" thing, but I ha--

165
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:03,500
Shut your mouth! Do you realize
what a stupid fraud you are?

166
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,041
[SUBARU] Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, calm down!

167
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,166
I don't know what's going on,

168
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,666
but can you please
be reasonable?

169
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,208
What is your problem, sir?
You'd better stay out of my way!

170
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:11,708
Tanya, come on!

171
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,291
Look, I have no knowledge of
what happened in your world,

172
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,000
but I have a sneaking
feeling you're misplacing

173
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,583
your anger here.

174
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,208
[AINS]
I actually agree with him.

175
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,375
Take a step back
and think about it.

176
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:24,416
Do you really think Being X,
the god, or the self-proclaimed

177
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,791
god that sent you to your
world is the same entity

178
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,041
that's in front of you now?

179
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,041
[gasps]

180
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:33,333
[AQUA whimpers]

181
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:36,958
You do have a point.
They're nothing alike.

182
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,833
[SUBARU]
You see?

183
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:43,458
[TANYA sighs] Okay. I guess
there are people from all

184
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:45,958
kinds of different worlds
together in this one.

185
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,958
I'm sorry, please forgive me.

186
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,666
[AQUA]
Uh, sure.

187
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,625
[TANYA] I guess I get a little
hyper-sensitive when people

188
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:52,958
call themselves deities.

189
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:55,125
Why are you just getting
all worked up now?

190
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:57,375
I've been saying I was
a goddess since day one!

191
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:58,708
[TANYA]
Eh?

192
00:08:58,791 --> 00:08:59,833
[AQUA]
Huh?

193
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,375
Uh...

194
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,875
[AINS]
Yeah, haven't you heard her?

195
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:07,958
Huh? Uh... She never
seemed very goddess-like.

196
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:11,166
So, maybe it just took a while
for the information to sink in.

197
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,916
I see. Maybe.

198
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,500
That's really insulting!

199
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,666
[TANYA] If I lose my cool around
every self-proclaimed goddess

200
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,583
that comes along, I must
have a lot more work

201
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:19,583
to do than I thought.

202
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:21,166
That's mean, too!

203
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:24,875
[ALBEDO]
Lord Ains! My Lord Ains!

204
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:26,166
[AINS]
Oh, there you are.

205
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,125
We all witnessed a powerful
magical explosion

206
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,708
that felt exactly
like an earthquake.

207
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:33,583
Mind sharing to the
group what happened?

208
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:34,958
[AINS]
Well, you see, uh...

209
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,833
I'm embarrassed to admit
I lost my composure.

210
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:39,958
Thanks to Ains and
Subaru's wisdom,

211
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:42,333
I was able to regain
control of myself.

212
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,708
I'm sorry for causing trouble.
I'm working through some stuff.

213
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:49,500
Well, as long as everyone
is safe, it's all right.

214
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,541
But you should control
your magic force.

215
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:55,375
You knocked a couple
people out cold.

216
00:09:55,458 --> 00:10:00,708
[sighs] Amateurs! You all
lack mental discipline!

217
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:02,916
No, I think it has more to do
with the fact that those dudes

218
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,583
know exactly what you
can be like when you get all

219
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,791
bent out of shape.
They're traumatized.

220
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:10,833
Oh, you have a point there.
That's still a sign of weakness!

221
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:11,958
[SUBARU]
You're ruthless!

222
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,375
I really am a goddess!

223
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,541
But nobody ever
believes what I say!

224
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:18,208
Then, when someone did seem to
believe it, they got mad at me!

225
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:20,958
Yeah, okay. But you're actually
just an archpriestess who tells

226
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:22,916
people she's a goddess
when she's really not.

227
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,916
Come on!

228
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,791
[SUBARU]
He's pretty ruthless, too!

229
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:25,708
[KAZUMA]
Oh, I misspoke.

230
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,125
[AINS]
If we were on Yggdrasil,

231
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:29,708
her power would exceed
eighth tier magic.

232
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,583
Few can summon
that kind of might.

233
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,791
But that man took it in the
face and still remained

234
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:34,833
standing afterwards.

235
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,125
[AQUA]
You know I'm a real goddess!

236
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:38,375
Just stop lying and
admit it to yourself!

237
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:39,916
[AINS] What kind of
intense mental stress

238
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,166
must this man be accustomed to?
