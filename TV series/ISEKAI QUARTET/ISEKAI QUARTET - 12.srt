[KAZUMA, TANYA groan]

162
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,916
Good thing I can bench press...
One hundred seventy-six pounds!

163
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,208
[BOTH yell]

164
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:13,250
Subaru!

165
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:16,250
I'm okay! Just grab
that head band!

166
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,208
Oh, no!

167
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:19,375
Aw, don't worry. He'll be fine.

168
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:20,583
Huh?

169
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:24,791
I know it. But you gotta
believe in him, too.

170
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,916
Better cover your
ears, everybody!

171
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,208
Not like they can
hear me, anyway.

172
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,708
I die! And come back to...

173
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:37,583
Well, I'm back. So what now?

174
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:39,958
There's all of those undead!

175
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,958
[AINS]
What the hell?

176
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:47,833
Subaru...

177
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:55,000
[KAZUMA grunts]

178
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:00,833
[KAZUMA] And a snipe,
and a snipe, and a snipe...

179
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:02,625
[TANYA]
You're actually pretty amazing.

180
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:03,666
[KAZUMA]
And a snipe--

181
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,666
You think so?

182
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,750
And a snipe.

183
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:06,958
Then why doncha try...

184
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:07,958
And a snipe.

185
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:08,750
...being a little...

186
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:09,708
And a snipe.

187
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:10,708
...nicer to me?!

188
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:11,583
And a snipe.

189
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:12,625
Huh?!

190
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,916
[TANYA]
Hm! Yeah, I'll work on that.

191
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,041
Thank you! This is the last one!

192
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,916
And a snipe.

193
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:24,208
All right! That's about
all I can do for you now.

194
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:26,458
'Kay. Thanks for everything.

195
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:27,625
Oh, by the way.

196
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:28,791
What's up?

197
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,500
My good luck stat is
pretty amazing, too.

198
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,250
Yeah? That's the opposite
of my situation.

199
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:37,125
It's cool. I know
it'll all work out.

200
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,791
Well. I'm off.

201
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,125
'Kay. Best of lu--

202
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:45,166
[KAZUMA yells]

203
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:51,208
Aw, man! Why is this
happening to me?

204
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:55,583
I just wanna go home and take
a bath, but I'll... steal!

205
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,125
[TANYA grunts]

206
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:05,583
[KAZUMA laughs] What'd I say?
My luck is off the charts!

207
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:08,166
[KAZUMA gasps]

208
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:12,791
Yeah. That's no lie.
If we were in my world,

209
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:15,416
I'd force you to join
the Imperial army.

210
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,958
Since we're here,

211
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:20,750
I suppose I'll just have to put
an end to this farce myself.

212
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,208
[TANYA]
Lord. In you there is truth.

213
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,791
I pray that you
reveal a path to me.

214
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:28,541
I know you work in
mysterious ways...

215
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,458
...but do it now!

216
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:41,291
[TANYA yells]

217
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,250
[ALL chattering]

218
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:12,833
[SUBARU]
Hey!

219
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:16,000
They didn't let us go home,
it was all just a big lie!

220
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,541
I said that you could
"maybe" go home, remember?

221
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,666
And one's words
do matter, right?

222
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,875
Well. I'll be fine either way.

223
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:25,708
Say what? We still gotta beat
the demon king, ya know?

224
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:28,250
[MEGUMIN chuckles]
No matter what world we're in,

225
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,041
I'm gonna keep on
doing my thing!

226
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,708
It's humbling here.
I could get used to that.

227
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:33,750
Seriously?

228
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,625
Come on.

229
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,416
You're not really having too
bad of a time here, are ya?

230
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,625
Yeah, right.

231
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:41,625
I know that some people
are into peace,

232
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,500
but I really don't
want to lose my edge.

233
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,000
Major?

234
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,416
I'm sure that this is just
another one of that bastard's

235
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,166
tests for me. He's trying
to make me die of shock!

236
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,250
Say what?

237
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,750
This sucks, if you
ask me. So unfair.

238
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,375
It doesn't surprise
me at all.

239
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:55,833
Saw it coming, I suppose.

240
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:58,416
[EMILIA] You know, It's strange.

241
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,375
Regardless,
I'm still having fun!

242
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,708
[REM] Me too.
Everyday's a new adventure.

243
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:05,291
You're right. It's not so bad.

244
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:07,458
[MOMONGA]
I agree, it's not bad at all.

245
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,458
What's more, every day
we've been here,

246
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:12,750
the floor guardians have
become more independent.

247
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,125
[sighs]

248
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,291
[MOMONGA]
When you think of it that way...

249
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:19,750
[AINS] ...maybe this no-good
world isn't half bad.

250
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,000
[ROSWAAL]
Oh, one more thing.

251
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,458
[ALL]
Huh?

252
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:24,166
I nearly forgot to mention
something rather important,

253
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,250
that you'll all love!

254
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:30,416
We will soon be playing host to
some new transfer students!

255
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,625
[SUBARU]
Huh?

256
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:32,875
[TANYA]
Huh?

257
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:34,250
[KAZUMA]
Huh?

258
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,750
[AINS]
Eh?!

259
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,333
[ROSWAAL]
Come in, please!
