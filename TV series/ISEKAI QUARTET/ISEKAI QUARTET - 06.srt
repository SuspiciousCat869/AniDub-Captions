1
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:13,125
[ROSWAAL] Seeing how well you've
all adapted to your school life

2
00:00:13,208 --> 00:00:16,458
makes me very happy. So far,
we've touched on the rules,

3
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:18,083
and learned everyone's names.

4
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:20,083
So without further delay.

5
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:23,708
It's time for us to decide
who will be our class reppy!

6
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:57,916
Not only will we choose our
reppy, but the vice-reppy too.

7
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,958
[ALBEDO]
Sir!

8
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:01,791
Do you have a question,
Miss Albedo?

9
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:04,458
I just want to say Lord Ains
should clearly be hailed

10
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,541
as class alpha!

11
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:09,333
[AQUA]
Nope! No way! Not gonna happen!

12
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:11,916
I refuse to be represented
by some scary, evil,

13
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,458
undead monster!

14
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:16,916
Ooh, does that mean you'll
be volunteering, Miss Aqua?

15
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,458
[AQUA] Yes, it does!
I mean, it only makes sense!

16
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,750
This class needs a leader
who's truly divine, like me!

17
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,750
[ALBEDO] You're even uglier
when your mouth is moving.

18
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,041
[AQUA]
Huh?!

19
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:27,416
I mean, really. The thought
of an ugly, crazy,

20
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,541
screeching harpy like you
repping us. Utter nonsense.

21
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:33,041
I may be a lot of things,
but I'm not ugly!

22
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:34,708
Hey Kazuma!

23
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:36,333
Yeah, yeah, that's my name.

24
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:39,583
That succubus over there
is being a big ol' meanie!

25
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:40,750
[DARKNESS]
Please, Aqua.

26
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:42,958
What she said barely
counts as an insult.

27
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:44,541
You need a lesson in true shame.

28
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:46,333
[KAZUMA]
That'll be a hard nope from me!

29
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:50,416
So, we have two names up for
the position, Ains and Aqua.

30
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,750
Is there anybody else?

31
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,083
[TANYA exhales]

32
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:55,083
[TANYA] I think trying to
represent this freakshow

33
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:58,250
would be just about as insane as
going back to the front lines.

34
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:01,041
No way in hell I'm throwing
my name in the ring.

35
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:08,208
[EMILIA] Oh, Mister Roswaal.
Me. I volunteer, too.

36
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,166
Yes. I think this class
should be a place

37
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,541
where we can all be friends.

38
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:14,958
I'll vote for ya! And I know
everybody else will too!

39
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:18,000
Alright, teach! Let's do
this thing! Let's vote!

40
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,500
[ROSWAAL]
We'll be drawing names.

41
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:21,583
[SUBARU]
Oh, we will?

42
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:23,250
Well, I will.

43
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:29,666
Um, hello. My name's Emilia,
your new class rep.

44
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,166
It's a great honor.
I'll do my very best.

45
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,666
[SUBARU chuckles]

46
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,333
That's quite a smug
look you have there,

47
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,291
especially since
you've done nothing.

48
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:40,333
[ALBEDO growls]
I will not accept this!

49
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,000
We're led by a stammering child,
while the powerful and sexy

50
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,541
Lord Ains is
second in command?

51
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:45,875
I'm sorry you feel that way.

52
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:48,416
But the process was
open and fair, so...

53
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,125
It's wrong. And that
homely girl is vice rep?

54
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,583
Don't insult me!

55
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,958
For the record, I'm not even
interested in "old boney"!

56
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:57,541
And I have no desire to
be the vice-rep, either!

57
00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:00,166
Well. Seems we have an
open slot for vice-rep,

58
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,083
don't we now?

59
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,333
[BOTH gasp]

60
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:03,791
[SHALLTEAR] I'd be more
than happy to volunteer

61
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,250
for the role.

62
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:06,625
Hold on a minute!

63
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,916
I would be honored to serve
alongside our glorious

64
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,458
Lord Ains!

65
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,208
Uh. I would too.

66
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:12,500
[AINS]
Calm down, everyone!

67
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:13,625
It's insane.

68
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,000
[NEUMANN]
Hm?

69
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,416
The skeleton... has a harem.

70
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,833
Yeah.

71
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:21,291
But not us. Makes me sad.

72
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,416
[NEUMANN]
Yeah.

73
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,333
I'm actually pretty jealous.

74
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,375
[WEISS] An Imperial Soldier
should never broadcast

75
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:27,625
desires like that.

76
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:30,125
So are you saying
you're not jealous, then?

77
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,875
I guess you could say that.
But it would be a lie.

78
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:35,875
--[GRANTZ] You too, huh?
--[NEUMANN] Samesies.

79
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:38,875
Why do the men in our battalion
have to be so obvious

80
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:39,666
about everything?

81
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,083
Huh?

82
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:43,875
Well, in my opinion, having
strong desires like that

83
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:46,583
can be pretty helpful
on the battlefield.

84
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,000
You really think so?

85
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:49,166
[TANYA]
I really do.

86
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,750
[VISHA]
Hm!

87
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,458
[SUBARU] I guess in every world
there are little girls going on

88
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,083
about stuff they
don't understand.

89
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:56,541
Your inner thoughts are just
as idiotic as your words,

90
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:57,750
I suppose.

91
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,500
[ROSWAAL] Okay, that's quite
enough of that!

92
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,750
I know you could go
on like this forever.

93
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:04,166
So instead, I'm just going
to draw more names.

94
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:08,250
[AINS] Yes, I support this move!
Let's do it that way!

95
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:08,958
[ALL]
Lord!

96
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:11,583
Oh, wow, that was quick!

97
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:15,958
Hell yeah!

98
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:17,583
[ALL groan]

99
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:19,125
[ROSWAAL]
It's settled.

100
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,958
These will be your teams, for a
little while at least, okay?

101
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,458
Whoa? Really?

102
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:24,791
That's my team, huh?

103
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:27,458
I've never even talked
to those people, ya know.

104
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:30,000
[ROSWAAL] Well, talking is a
great way to turn a stranger

105
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,458
into a friend, so lucky you!

106
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:38,791
They're splitting us up.

107
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:41,666
But still, this could be
a great opportunity.

108
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,750
Opportunity?

109
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,583
[DEMIURGE]
Take a closer look at this list.

110
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,041
Seems the guardians have
been equally divided.

111
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:51,041
[SHALLTEAR] True, but what
point are you trying to make?

112
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:53,416
Lord Ains gave us clear orders.

113
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,541
We're to follow the rules of
this school life for the moment.

114
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,708
But we must consider
what the "for the moment"

115
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,291
part means, exactly.

116
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:01,875
[AINS]
Hm?

117
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,416
Our main goal. And this has been
stated repeatedly by Lord Ains,

118
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,000
is still world domination.

119
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:08,208
We wouldn't want to put
that aim in jeopardy.

120
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:10,500
As we're in an
uncertain environment.

121
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,958
Our wise lord wants us to
gather intelligence on the

122
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:15,916
assembled factions, and use
our findings against them.

123
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,208
[AINS]
Huh?

124
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:19,791
Why am I on the
animal care team?

125
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:22,250
[DEMIURGE] So you see, this is
a chance to show Lord Ains

126
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,166
the degree to which
we serve him.

127
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,000
Our obedience to him and our
absolute adherence to his

128
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,416
primary objective is
being put to the test.

129
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,333
[COCYTUS] So to serve our Lord,
we must faithfully execute

130
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:34,708
our duties on our
respective committees?

131
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:35,875
[DEMIURGE]
That's correct.

132
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,541
--[AINS] Huh?!
--[SHALLTEAR] Understood!

133
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,708
In order to please my
Lord and Master,

134
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:43,500
I will be the best damn nurse
this world has ever seen!

135
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,541
[ROSWAAL]
Hello, Beatrice!

136
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:48,083
Is something
troubling you, dear?

137
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:50,500
You and I need to have
a little chat, Roswaal.

138
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:53,416
That would be "Mister Roswaal."

139
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,333
You really believe that
you can get away with

140
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,541
that rigged drawing, I suppose.

141
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,375
[ROSWAAL] I don't know
what you mean by "rigged."

142
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:03,416
Whatever it is you're planning,
I want to know all the details.

143
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,875
Is that so? Planning anything
would be a waste of my time.

144
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:10,000
Stop being cryptic and
tell me what it is!

145
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,541
I'm being honest.

146
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:14,541
In the end, we all have to act
out the parts we were given.

147
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,375
That goes for you,
that goes for me...

148
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:19,666
Hey! Hold on, Roswaal!
You get back here!

149
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,375
[KAZUMA]
Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad.

150
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:25,375
It's Kazuma It's been a while,
but things have been nutty.

151
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,750
Dying was bad enough, but then
I was alive again and

152
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:30,250
partnered up with some useless
goddess in a weird world

153
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,916
full of crazy people.

154
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,166
But now, I find myself
in another world.

155
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,916
And in this one I'm a student.

156
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,333
I know, I know.

157
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,375
I used to play hooky and
wouldn't go to class, even when

158
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:42,375
you begged me to, so I'm just
as surprised as you guys are,

159
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:43,875
trust me.

160
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:47,250
But I gotta say, the weirdest
thing about this school...

161
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,833
How come nobody here
is an actual student?

162
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,625
Why is the place so crazy?!

163
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:54,833
What's wrong with you?
Speak up, Kazuma Satou.

164
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:57,500
[KAZUMA] I'm stuck here
with an evil little girl.

165
00:07:57,583 --> 00:08:00,583
And some guy who may
literally be the devil!

166
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:03,208
Yeah? And you think lying
on the floor will help?

167
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:05,583
I can't get up for some reason!

168
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:07,041
[DEMIURGE]
Hm. My command spell

169
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,166
doesn't seem to work
as intended here.

170
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,708
Kneel before us!

171
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,125
What the--?

172
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:13,666
[TANYA]
Hm?

173
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,208
Kick, kick, kick, kick...

174
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:16,416
[DEMIURGE] There is something
rather complicated about the

175
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,958
power balance in this world.

176
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,000
Now back on your feet!

177
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:24,416
[KAZUMA] Ugh. Whoa.
What just happened?

178
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,083
Are you sick, boy?
If you're feeling ill,

179
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:29,666
perhaps you should lie
back down for a little bit.

180
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,250
Yeah, I think I
just might, honestly.

181
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:32,791
[TANYA]
Unacceptable.

182
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:36,166
We'll never get anything
done at this rate. Stand up!

183
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,916
What'd you just say?

184
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,250
I clearly said, "stand up!"

185
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,500
[KAZUMA groans]

186
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:45,375
[DEMIURGE] This human girl has
the power to command others?

187
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:48,291
This isn't some kind of jokey,
slice of life world we're in.

188
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:49,833
At least, not if I can help it!

189
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,041
[DEMIURGE]
Ah!

190
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:53,583
Rules first! We need
to establish order!

191
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,333
Freedom will be secondary!

192
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:57,750
Yes, I agree whole-heartedly!

193
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,166
We'll need to come up with a
strict list of rules to follow.

194
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,916
Yeah. And the more of them
there are, the better.

195
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,291
You know...

196
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:06,791
...I think you and I are
going to get along famously.

197
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,833
Ains has excellent
taste in allies.

198
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:11,958
That's kind of you. And I must
say, I'm beginning to see why

199
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,416
he holds you in
such high regard.

200
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,541
Oh, and by the way...

201
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:17,583
[KAZUMA]
Mom, Dad, I'm sorry about this,

202
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:21,125
but I think I'm never coming
back to school again!

203
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:25,958
[COCYTUS] If there
are no objections,

204
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:28,583
I will assume the role of
gym committee leader.

205
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:31,916
Makes sense. You do strike me
as the strongest one here.

206
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,791
Oh yeah.

207
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,458
So, what are we doing?

208
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,666
Binding our bodies and
hanging from the rafters?

209
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,291
Or forcefully thrusting
ourselves deep

210
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:40,250
in the throat of a giant toad?

211
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,583
[COCYTUS]
Young lady.

212
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:44,583
You angry? You deadly
looking metal mantis man?

213
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,708
[COCYTUS]
What did you just call me?

214
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:49,166
You have four arms for
a reason, don't you?

215
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,958
So you can pin down my arms
and legs at the same time.

216
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,583
You'll hold me tight and say,

217
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,625
"You're totally helpless,
now aren't you?"

218
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,375
"Scream all you want,
no one cares."

219
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:59,166
But I'll try to resist!

220
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,791
Then your frosty breath will
give my entire body chills.

221
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,250
All of the sensitive
parts especially.

222
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:08,750
Oh my god! I can't handle it,
so soft and chilly!

223
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,208
[COCYTUS]
Such an odd young lady.

224
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:11,583
What's going on with her?

225
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:13,125
Daddy issues?

226
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:16,833
Easy, Darkness. You're scaring
our friend, Cocytus.

227
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,083
You! You dare call
yourself a man?

228
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,208
You'll side with the monster,
and while he holds me down,

229
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:23,875
you'll savage me with those
strong, unforgiving eyebrows!

230
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,333
What is wrong with you?

231
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,791
Don't know, but your brows
are freaking her out.

232
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,083
Seems so.

233
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:33,416
[gasps]
Take me!

234
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:59,041
The wheels of reincarnation
have begun to spin. Heh!
