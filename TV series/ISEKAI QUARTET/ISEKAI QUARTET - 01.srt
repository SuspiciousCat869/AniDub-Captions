00:00:14,291 --> 00:00:16,041
[KAZUMA grunts]

2
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:18,875
[AQUA sobs]

3
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:21,750
Hold it! We should check out the
stuff we got from that quest!

4
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:23,125
Ugh, we can do that later!

5
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:24,833
Do you want me walking
around like this?

6
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:26,916
I'm covered in stinky
giant-toad slime!

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,833
You practically
live in toad slime.

8
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:30,333
Probably shouldn't
say that out loud.

9
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:31,916
Damn right you shouldn't!

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,041
Don't forget I'm a goddess,
I should look immaculate

11
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:37,416
and smell divine. Not reek worse
than some shut-in NEET like you!

12
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,833
Hey! I am not some shut in NEET!

13
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:41,875
You don't wanna hear it,
but if you hadn't run ahead,

14
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:43,666
you wouldn't be gross,
so don't get mad at me

15
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,958
'cause you were out there acting
like the goddess of stupidity.

16
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:47,958
[AQUA gasps]
What did you call me?

17
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:49,458
Does nobody even care
that Kazuma's...

18
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:51,458
Uh. What's this?

19
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:56,875
[ALBEDO] So our plan for now
is to manipulate the Kingdom

20
00:00:56,958 --> 00:00:59,958
of Re-Estize from the shadows.
While simultaneously

21
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:03,333
forming an alliance with
the Baharuth empire.

22
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:05,833
Once we balance
these two operations,

23
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:07,250
we'll achieve our ultimate goal.

24
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,291
Making the Sorcerer Kingdom
of Ains Ooal Gown

25
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:10,750
a global superpower.

26
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:12,791
Seated in the Great
Tomb of Nazarick.

27
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:15,125
[AINS] I admire
your ambition, Albedo.

28
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:16,666
[DEMIURGE]
Lord Ains.

29
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,375
[AINS]
What is it, Demiurge?

30
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:21,208
Well, my lord. I have
a matter of interest.

31
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:24,291
[AINS] Then by all means,
enlighten us.

32
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:25,791
It seems...

33
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:27,541
...there've been rumors of a
strange phenomenon occurring

34
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:29,708
within the very
walls of Nazarick.

35
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:32,166
[AINS]
A "strange phenomenon" you say?

36
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,583
[DEMIURGE] Yes. I've yet to
witness this anomaly myself,

37
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:37,375
but as I've heard it told,

38
00:01:37,458 --> 00:01:40,416
a small box suddenly
appeared out of nowhere.

39
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,708
But as its sole adornment
is a simple button,

40
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:45,208
I have deduced that it's
some type of device.

41
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:46,291
[AINS]
Could it be a weapon

42
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:49,958
planted by one of
our adversaries?

43
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:52,125
[DEMIURGE] At the risk of
sounding overconfident.

44
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:53,916
I cannot envision
any of our rivals

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,250
entering Nazarick undetected.

46
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:57,666
[AINS]
Understood.

47
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,041
But there are many things
outside your imagination.

48
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:01,958
We must consider
any possibilities

49
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:04,250
for its origin and use.

50
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:07,000
[AINS]
Alert all of Nazarick.

51
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:09,583
If any of these "mystery"
buttons are found.

52
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:12,500
Use caution in handling them.
If someone finds one,

53
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:14,833
use the message spell
to share its location.

54
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:17,458
Then follow our
"trap-disarming" protocol.

55
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:19,125
[ALL]
Lord!

56
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:21,958
[AINS] Of course. I'd imagine
you would take those same steps

57
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,708
without me needing to tell you.

58
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:25,500
Your words honor us, my lord.

59
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:28,500
[MOMONGA] Is it really a trap?
I mean, it seems so obvious.

60
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:30,625
Like something a kid
would come up with.

61
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:33,375
You'd have to be pretty stupid
to just press a random button

62
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:37,500
if you didn't know what it did.
That's a total noob move.

63
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,208
C'mon, just let me
push the thing!

64
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:41,166
I'll be super delicate
and careful...!

65
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,375
[KAZUMA] We need to find out
what the hell it is, first!

66
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:46,791
Vanir definitely needs to
check this thing out, okay?

67
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,625
I must say,
Kazuma's correct on this.

68
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:50,041
[KAZUMA]
Thanks, Megumin!

69
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:51,916
I knew you crimson demons
were supposed to be smart.

70
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,500
Glad you've got--

71
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:55,208
Although, if you're wondering
if we should push the button,

72
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:57,041
which may change our destiny...

73
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:59,000
Yes! Absolutely!

74
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:01,125
[KAZUMA]
Are you crazy?!

75
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:03,125
[DARKNESS, MEGUMIN]
Huh?

76
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,416
Um... this... seems bad.

77
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,750
Aw damnit, you shoulda
listened to me!

78
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:10,500
[gasps] What kind of
humiliation awaits me?

79
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,708
Will I be tied up and sold away?

80
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:14,125
To a dank, dark dungeon

81
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:16,458
and used as some handsy
savage's plaything?

82
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:18,791
[KAZUMA]
Stop being so giddy, Darkness!

83
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,166
[MEGUMIN chuckles]

84
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,125
And you'd better not be
smirking right now, got me?

85
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:24,416
[AQUA shouts]
What's happening?

86
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,416
The world's getting
all weird and squiggly!

87
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,375
Everything's melting!

88
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:30,333
[KAZUMA]
Shut up, you idiot!

89
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:34,666
[AINS]
Hm.

90
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,291
Is something wrong, my lord?

91
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:39,333
[AINS] No, it's nothing
I'm sure. Carry on.

92
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:43,166
[ALBEDO] Hm. Now, we need
to devise the most effective

93
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,125
strategy for forging
this alliance...

94
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:46,708
[MOMONGA]
Something definitely feels off.

95
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:49,291
[ALBEDO] In the last war they
shared in our glorious victory,

96
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:51,916
but many of their knights have
begun to desert their ranks

97
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,416
because they fear Lord Ains.

98
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,500
That unease is threatening the
emperor's hold on power...

99
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,125
[AINS yells]

100
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:32,416
[schoolbell rings]

101
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,666
[AINS]
So. Where are we?

102
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,208
Not sure.

103
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:44,666
But I do have a feeling that
we're not in Nazarick anymore.

104
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,000
[MOMONGA]
Oh man.

105
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:48,291
Don't tell me I'm stuck
in some other other world!

106
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:49,208
[AQUA]
Excuse me!

107
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:50,666
[AINS]
Hm?

108
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,416
I really hate to
bother you folks,

109
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,000
but do you know where we are?

110
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:56,208
[AINS]
Hm?!

111
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:57,500
[AQUA]
Yikes.

112
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,041
Did I get sent back?

113
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,583
Seems like it...

114
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:03,125
[AQUA] Hey! Kazuma, get your
head outta the clouds!

115
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:05,833
Look over there!
That's definitely an undead!

116
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:06,833
A big one!

117
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,916
They're all so
terrible and ugly.

118
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,541
Ah! It's only a matter of
time before they get their

119
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,583
disgusting paws all over us.

120
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,250
[MEGUMIN chuckles]
Never fear,

121
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,125
for I possess the most powerful
attack ever known, my expl--

122
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:19,916
[KAZUMA]
Will you hang on a second?

123
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,083
I can't think straight with
all your jibber jabbering!

124
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:24,375
[MEGUMIN] Stop thinking
and start doing.

125
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:25,833
Or get out of my way!

126
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:28,000
[DARKNESS] No! Let me go,
I can offer my body--

127
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,541
[AQUA]
If they're undead,

128
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:31,750
surely the power of a goddess's
holy punch will smite them.

129
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:36,083
[KAZUMA yells] Would you just
shut the hell up already?!

130
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:39,458
Listen up students!
Class begins immediately!

131
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,125
[TANYA] What's going on?
Where the hell am I?

132
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:56,625
Think back.

133
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,833
I was born into a world of
science and reason, after all.

134
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:01,500
A society that understood
fortune favored the bold

135
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:04,416
and the ambitious. I was a
successful businessman.

136
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,458
I earned my place at the
top of the food chain.

137
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:08,708
But a vindictive entity
known as "Being X"

138
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:11,541
forced me to be reborn
as an absolute weakling.

139
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,625
A little girl thrust
into a world that didn't

140
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:14,875
trust in science.

141
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:16,833
Instead, life was
dictated by magic

142
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:19,208
and the constant
falling of bombs!

143
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:22,208
And then, I was forced
to test out a new

144
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:26,125
computation jewel made by
that crazy old scientist.

145
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:31,875
[TANYA screams]

146
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:35,625
[SCHUGEL] What are you doing?
Do something or it will explode!

147
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:38,083
Press the button for the
jewel expansion, you fool!

148
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,375
But this piece of junk
doesn't look at all

149
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:43,000
like it did in the
manual you gave me.

150
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:46,166
This is an upgraded version
of the Elenium Type-97!

151
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,916
That masterpiece you're
wearing is the future!

152
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,250
[TANYA]
Listen crackpot!

153
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,333
How am I supposed to know
which button is which

154
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:54,333
if they're almost right
next to each other?

155
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:55,625
You're design sucks!

156
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,833
What are you talking about,
you little brat?

157
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:59,791
There's only one
button on the unit!

158
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:01,458
[TANYA]
Huh?

159
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:06,000
Your brain is more damaged than
I thought! I'm holding two!

160
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:08,250
My god, have you
actually gone mad?

161
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,833
Oh, because you're one to talk!

162
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:12,958
Push the damn button!
That's an order!

163
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:16,875
An. O. R. D. E, R!

164
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:18,333
Geez.

165
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,041
There's nothing worse than
working for the government.

166
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,458
One word from the higher-ups

167
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:24,041
and you're completely
stripped of your human rights.

168
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,666
Fine, then. I know what to do.

169
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,125
If I don't know
which one's which,

170
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:28,958
I'll have to push both of them!

171
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,541
[bell rings]

172
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:34,833
[TANYA]
And just like that, here I am.

173
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:40,833
[TANYA] At first glance it
looks like my old world, but...

174
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:42,166
[VISHA yelps]

175
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,750
[AQUA] I don't understand
why you just followed...

176
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:46,750
[TANYA] These guys look like
they fell out of an RPG.

177
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:50,208
They've got really crappy
equipment for adventurers.

178
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:51,666
[GRANTZ, WILIBALD gasp]

179
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:55,750
[TANYA] These characters
aren't even human.

180
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,791
Should I assume this
another trick by that

181
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:00,291
self-proclaimed god, Being X?

182
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,916
Or is some other
power at work here?

183
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,791
[EMILIA] I don't believe we
should be running in the halls

184
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,333
--[TANYA] Huh?
--in such a manner.

185
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:07,666
[RAM]
Well, if you don't like it,

186
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,291
you should blame stupid Barusu!

187
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,708
[BEATRICE] You should, but I
don't suppose he'll apologize.

188
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:13,750
[SUBARU] It's not my
fault you lazy bums

189
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,291
couldn't wake up on time!

190
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:16,750
[REM]
Subaru, are you okay?

191
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,208
[SUBARU]
Yeah.

192
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,125
I mean, I had to literally
go through hell to get here.

193
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:22,375
And being in school was
awkward and weird for me,

194
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:25,458
but let's just try to ignore
everything else for now.

195
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,458
And maybe we can enjoy
being somewhere,

196
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:31,375
where everything's
not out to kill us.

197
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:36,125
[SUBARU chuckles]
And this is what we run into?

198
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,041
[MOMONGA]
Oh geez, there's more of 'em.

199
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:41,250
Lord Ains. I think we
should slaughter them

200
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:44,250
[AINS] Not yet. First, we need
to gather some intel.

201
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,916
Understood my lord.

202
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,333
I think... this is
gonna really suck.

203
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:49,708
[AQUA]
Don't worry!

204
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:52,250
Remember you have a goddess
on your side, after all.

205
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:53,750
I'll handle it.

206
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,333
[KAZUMA] Yeah, well that's
not gonna make it any better!

207
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:57,958
If this is some new trial
Being X came up with,

208
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,916
then I accept it.
Do you hear me?

209
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,958
Whatever you're planning, I'll
wreck it and have my revenge!

210
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:06,625
Um, Major? Are you okay?

211
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,000
Well, I'm worried.

212
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,625
I can't say I care for
the look of these people.

213
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:13,083
That's it. There's too
little information.

214
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,458
Go on and sacrifice yourself.

215
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:16,458
[SUBARU] How else do we
gauge their kill power?

216
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:17,833
There's no need.

217
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:20,833
It would be my pleasure
to protect the both of you.

218
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:21,791
Hey, Subaru.

219
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,000
[SUBARU]
Hm?

220
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,416
I think. This might
be a good opportunity

221
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,916
to make new friends.

222
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,125
You never fail to see the
bright side of any situation,

223
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,916
just like an angel!

224
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,958
[KURT exhales]

225
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,791
So now that they have
all been assembled,

226
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:42,083
their school life
can finally begin.
