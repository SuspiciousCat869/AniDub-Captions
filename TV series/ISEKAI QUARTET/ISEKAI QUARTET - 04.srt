1
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:18,291
[MOMONGA] Uh. Did she
bring me here to talk,

2
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:20,541
or just glare at me?

3
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:22,000
[grunts]

4
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:23,583
[MOMONGA]
I'm the lord of Death!

5
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:25,791
Master of the Great
Tomb of Nazarick!

6
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:28,500
I will not be intimidated!

7
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:32,666
[AINS] You wanted to
discuss something. What is it?

8
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:35,500
[TANYA]
Tell me...

9
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:37,833
[AINS gasps]

10
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:40,333
[TANYA] You're that bastard,
Being X, aren't you?

11
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:45,375
[AINS]
Huh?

12
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:13,958
[AINS]
Being X you say?

13
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:15,750
You're not some regular schmuck.

14
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:17,916
You've got that powerful
aura around you.

15
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,416
And that nightmarish face.

16
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,166
So, cut the crap and admit
you're the wannabe god, Being X!

17
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,250
[AINS] Wait. What are
you talking about?

18
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:26,208
You tossed me into a
hellish world of war,

19
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:28,083
but I guess that wasn't
enough for you, was it?

20
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:30,166
Couldn't get your jollies
until you sent this little girl

21
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,625
back to school, huh?
Is this some sick joke?

22
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:33,666
[AINS]
Wait one moment!

23
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,250
For what?

24
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:38,125
[AINS] Let me ask you something.
Are you originally from Earth?

25
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,916
Japan, to be more specific?

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,375
[gasps]

27
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:45,000
[ALBEDO growls]

28
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:46,208
[ERICH] Now, can anybody tell
me what the author may have

29
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,875
been thinking when he
wrote this second...

30
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:51,458
Uh. Albedo? Is that black
cloud you're wearing new?

31
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:53,583
Now don't work
yourself in a tizzy.

32
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:55,500
Lord Ains is not
exactly the type of man

33
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:58,291
who chases little girls
around, you know.

34
00:02:58,375 --> 00:02:59,791
You're totally
missing the point!

35
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:01,583
Lord Ains is
simply irresistible.

36
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:05,166
Those red eyes and studly horns.
I'm sure she fell madly in love

37
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,708
with him the instant
he walked in the room,

38
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:07,833
I mean how can you not?

39
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:10,208
[REM]
I know!

40
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:13,500
I get you. For real!

41
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:14,541
[ALBEDO sighs]

42
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,208
Wait. Are the two
of you friends,

43
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:17,708
or am I missing something?

44
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:21,083
[SHALLTEAR] I fail to see
how you're alike in any way.

45
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,458
[ALBEDO]
Someday, even you...

46
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,791
[ERICH] Are any of them even
paying attention to me?

47
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:29,625
Hold on. You're saying you're
in the same situation as I am?

48
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,708
[AINS] Yes. Though I
was transported,

49
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:34,166
and you've got some
reincarnation thing going on.

50
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,583
Sorry I was being rude,
but I'm sure you can imagine

51
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,916
why I'd have no idea
you were actually human.

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,125
Think nothing of it.
For the record,

53
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:44,041
you don't exactly look like
your typical salaryman, either.

54
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,250
[TANYA]
No, I don't.

55
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:48,250
Salaryman. That's a
title I haven't heard

56
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,333
in a very long time.

57
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:52,833
You really should've told me you
were from another world sooner.

58
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:55,291
I wouldn't have called you such
a horrible thing as Being X,

59
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:56,375
at least.

60
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,583
[AINS]
Well, to be perfectly honest.

61
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,500
I didn't think anyone
would believe me.

62
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:03,083
I know just how you feel.

63
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:05,333
[school bell rings]

64
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:08,625
[ALBEDO gasps]
Oh, Lord Ains!

65
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:11,458
[AURA, SHALLTEAR]
See you later!

66
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:12,708
[ERICH gasps]

67
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:15,041
[VISHA grunts]
Sorry! But I have to go, too!

68
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:17,250
[door clatters]

69
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,458
[sighs] Don't forget we're
having a talent show.

70
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:25,333
It'll be held tomorrow
morning after class.

71
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:27,416
[ERICH] The performers have not
yet been chosen, so you should

72
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,208
all come prepared to
showcase your "talents".

73
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:33,833
[COCYTUS] Sir. Can you
tell us why exactly

74
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:37,541
we're being ordered
to do such a thing?

75
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:41,458
Well, uh. To quote
Mister Roswaal,

76
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:45,875
"Wouldn't that be fun?"
His opinion, not mine.

77
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:48,333
[RAM]
That settles it.

78
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:49,875
[COCYTUS]
Does it, now?

79
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:53,416
Yes. Teachers make
the rules. It's settled.

80
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,333
[COCYTUS]
But. Is it settled?

81
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:57,083
It's settled, now!

82
00:04:58,666 --> 00:04:59,833
Interesting.

83
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:02,541
Did you actually learn
something from all that?

84
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,125
[AINS]
So, do you enjoy coffee?

85
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:06,291
Oh, I love it. Back
in Japan, I would--

86
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:09,375
[VISHA]
Major! Major!

87
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,166
Hi. Uh...

88
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,916
Yes? What is it?

89
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,416
Well, ma'am. School's over for
the day, so I came to fetch you.

90
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,708
And I thought we might head
over to the market and get some

91
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:23,625
of those croquettes you're
so fond of, they're on sale!

92
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:26,875
[TANYA sighs] It seems
the reason we're here

93
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:30,666
and who brought us to this world
will remain a mystery for now.

94
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,125
But, at least...

95
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:33,541
[AINS]
At least what?

96
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,875
The food's divine.
Best I've ever had.

97
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:39,708
Well, it was nice talking
to you, Ains Ooal Gown.

98
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,000
Let's do it again sometime.

99
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,250
[AINS]
Yes. I'd like that.

100
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:44,958
[VISHA] I'm a little
surprised the two of you

101
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:46,041
got along so well.

102
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,833
[TANYA]
What's that supposed to mean?

103
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:50,500
[VISHA] Maybe I should
have said, "impressed."

104
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:54,166
[AINS] This world is full
of culinary delights, eh?

105
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,250
[MOMONGA]
Damnit, I wish I could eat!

106
00:05:56,333 --> 00:06:01,833
[ALBEDO growls]

107
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,291
[TANYA]
Good morning to you, colonel.

108
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:09,916
Excuse me, teacher!

109
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,875
Top of the morning
to you, teacher!

110
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:14,583
[ERICH]
Uh... Yeah, good morning.

111
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:17,458
[ERICH] I didn't know Major
von Degurechaff could smile.

112
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,791
A monster like her,
grinning ear to ear.

113
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,541
It chills my blood.

114
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:22,958
I realize things
are different here,

115
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:25,083
but that is totally bizarre.

116
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,583
[AINS] I hope the day
finds you well, teacher.

117
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:31,333
[ERICH]
Uh, yes, and same to you, Ains.

118
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:36,333
Yeah. This world holds
creatures far more terrifying

119
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:37,791
than demonic girls.

120
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:41,208
[SUBARU pants]

121
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:44,250
Sorry for the hold up.
Didn't mean to make you wait.

122
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,791
It's fine. I didn't want
to leave without you.

123
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:50,291
Appreciate that. We gotta
haul ass, or we'll be tardy!

124
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:51,458
Let's kick it up a notch!

125
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:52,750
Right!

126
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,291
[SUBARU]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

127
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,958
Hold on, there's no freaking
way I could keep up with you!

128
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,375
[REM] Well, then I'll just
have to carry you there.

129
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,666
[REM grunts]

130
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:04,583
[SUBARU]
This is a lot faster.

131
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:08,125
But still, I'm feeling way less
like a man and more like a baby.

132
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,625
I think this suits
you perfectly,

133
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,666
and it really gives you
the look of a nobleman.

134
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,875
That's nice, but I don't see
any other guys being schlepped

135
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:16,958
around by their lady friends.

136
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:18,458
Oh, there's one!

137
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:21,041
Kazuma? I know we're running
late, but this seems silly.

138
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,666
I mean, do I have to carry you?

139
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,458
I would argue you do.
'Cause this is the fastest way

140
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:27,500
we can travel with
our current party.

141
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,708
I don't have the same ability
for high speed as you do,

142
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,041
so here we are.

143
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,416
Yeah, but don't you think
this is just a little

144
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,791
emasculating for you?

145
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,083
[KAZUMA] I think getting
carried around by some buff

146

me look more manly.

go ahead and put me down.

Ya know, go ahead
and put me down.

00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:01,958
[SUBARU] Faster! Faster! Faster!
Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster!

157
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:03,333
[KAZUMA pants]

158
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:09,083
[shouts]

159
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,625
Natsuki. You're late!

160
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,000
[SUBARU]
No!

161
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:17,333
[ERICH] And you, young man!
You're also late!

162
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:20,250
[KAZUMA yells]

163
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:24,750
Hey, your name's
Kazuma, isn't it?

164
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,291
Yep. That's me.

165
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,291
Last name Satou?

166
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:31,208
Yeah. That's what they call me.

167
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:32,375
[SUBARU]
So, were you...?

168
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:35,041
Wait. I've got the
same question for you.

169
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:42,041
[BOTH] So, were you... Randomly
summoned to some other world?

170
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:42,666
Say what?

171
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,541
What'd you say?

172
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,625
I knew it from the very first
time I heard your name

173
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:48,416
during that class intro.

174
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,166
It was the dope tracksuit
for me. I had one.

175
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,458
Wore it when I was reincarnated.

176
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,333
It's the quintessential
outfit for the man

177
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:57,041
who never leaves his room.

178
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:58,291
I left my room a lot actually.

179
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:01,041
[ERICH] Hey, less talkity
and more buckety.

180
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:05,708
[KAZUMA] So, you know that trope
when a character reincarnates,

181
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,541
and they get some
broken superpower?

182
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,000
Oh yeah, for sure.

183
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:12,000
Way too powered up.
Can't even stop winning!

184
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,875
That's how it goes, uh-huh.

185
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,708
Turns out in reality,
it's nothing like that at all.

186
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,916
Yeah, don't I know it.

187
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,958
So I gotta beat
this "Devil King."

188
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,375
Now they say I can have some
"awesome power or weapon"

189
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:24,875
ya know?

190
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:27,666
But that turns out to be some
useless lush of a goddess.

191
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,083
Get this, my party?

192
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,791
A chatterbox mage, who can
only use one spell a day!

193
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:34,500
And a crusader who
can't hit a damn thing!

194
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:38,458
We had no coin, and had to
sleep in a stinky ol' stable!

195
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:41,375
I'm telling ya man, it was
a freaking beating.

196
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,458
I met this half-elf chick
and had to help her

197
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,666
with a buncha stuff.
We live in a mansion, though.

198
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,208
We've got these twin
demon maids with us.

199
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:50,916
And this snarky-ass loli,

200
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,916
whose hair is like a couple
of power drills. Ha, ha...

201
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,583
[gasps]
Wait...

202
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,333
[SUBARU]
Huh?

203
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:58,458
What the hell, bruh?

204
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,583
Now don't get the wrong idea.

205
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:03,083
Rem does have a
major thing for me.

206
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:06,541
Oh. Rem's uh, the stacked twin,
the one with the blue hair.

207
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:07,875
Wait, say what?

208
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:10,916
Thing is, Me and Emilia,
that's the half-elf chick,

209
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,708
We're totally the OTP!

210
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,125
[KAZUMA]
This freaking guy!

211
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:17,416
Yeah. Guess we both have it
pretty rough don't we?

212
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,875
I got it rough and
you got it cushy!

213
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,625
You're surrounded by girls?
And you live in luxury?

214
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:25,666
It's rough 'cause your
crush doesn't like you?

215
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,333
That's it! You're my enemy!

216
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,333
You harem-having
whiny baby bitch!

217
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:30,541
I'm your enemy?

218
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,500
We both died and went
into another world,

219
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:38,000
but I happened to get the
crappy one? It's not fair!

220
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,833
[SUBARU] Hmph, I didn't
die before I got there.
