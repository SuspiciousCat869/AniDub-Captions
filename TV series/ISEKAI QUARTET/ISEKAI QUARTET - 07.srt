00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:14,416
[EMILIA sighs]

2
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,291
[EMILIA]
This is so hard.

3
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:18,208
[PUCK]
Good work today, Lia.

4
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:20,291
I bet it must be pretty
tough having to be the

5
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:23,458
representative of all of those
weirdos in your class, huh?

6
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:25,666
[EMILIA]
Yeah, it's not easy.

7
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,291
Although you do seem
happier than usual lately.

8
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:30,750
[EMILIA]
Well.

9
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:32,833
I feel lucky because everyone
in class is so unique.

10
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:35,083
I'm not sure that "unique,"
is the right word,

11
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:37,041
but I get what
you're saying.

12
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:38,791
It's kind of nice, actually.

13
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:41,375
I'm not known as "that
silver-haired half-elf" here.

14
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,041
Yeah.

15
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:44,625
There's a lot I
don't understand.

16
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:47,000
Like where we are,
or how this all happened.

17
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:50,000
Though I get the feeling Roswaal
knows what's going on.

18
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:53,250
But still. I want to do whatever
I can with this opportunity.

19
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:54,583
[PUCK]
Good!

20
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:56,583
It might be difficult.

21
00:00:56,666 --> 00:01:00,375
Mm. Honestly, I know it will be.
But you know what?

22
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:01,750
I'll give it my best try!

23
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:03,500
Well, no matter what
you decide to do,

24
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:05,666
you know I've got your
back all the way!

25
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,625
That's sweet. Thanks, Puck!

26
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:09,416
[PUCK chuckles]

27
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,416
By the way.

28
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,833
[PUCK]
Huh?

29
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:14,916
Oh, it's just. I think I really
like going to school.

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,416
I'm having fun!

31
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,416
[REM] I'm curious.
How's animal duty treating you?

32
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,958
Yeah, the truth is,
it's kinda nutty.

33
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:54,041
Oh really? How so?

34
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,625
Well...

35
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:59,041
[SUBARU]
This guy, is a tiny bit bigger

36
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,500
than the Djungarian
hamsters I'm used to.

37
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:04,625
I don't believe it. So familiar
with my species, you are?

38
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,708
Yeah, but the ones I've
encountered were a little,

39
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,375
and by that I mean,
a lot different.

40
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:11,791
[HAMSUKE] A very similar
sentiment my lord did express.

41
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,625
[SUBARU] I have a hard
time understanding you

42
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:15,750
when you're nomming
on my head, ya know?

43
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:17,333
[AURA]
Cut it out, Hamsuke!

44
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:20,416
My animal instincts just took
over and chew on him I did!

45
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,083
Sorry, Subaru!
Whoa, you're all bloody!

46
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:26,791
I'm fine. I guess him chewing
only on me makes me special.

47
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,291
You know better than that!

48
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,625
Yes but for some reason
whenever I see him,

49
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:32,791
the excitement takes
over me, it does.

50
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,625
High fives work, too! Or is
chewing on someone's head

51
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,166
the way your kind
likes to say hello?

52
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,125
[HAMSUKE] Extremely ashamed
of myself, I am.

53
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:43,958
[SUBARU] Then maybe you
should stop chewing on me!

54
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,041
So yeah, it's nutty.

55
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,458
[REM]
We must go slay that monster!

56
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,458
Whoa, slow your
roll there slugger!

57
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:51,500
Besides, Rozzy told us not
to start fights, remember?

58
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,416
Forget about it.

59
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,125
Anyway, how's your gig going?

60
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:57,625
Well, since I'm basically
the school nurse,

61
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,208
I don't really have
all that much to do

62
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,083
unless somebody gets
sick or injured.

63
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:03,000
[gasps]
Subaru!

64
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,500
[SUBARU]
Huh?

65
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,041
Why didn't you come to me
for help when that evil monster

66
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:07,125
attacked you?

67
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:09,166
Oh. I didn't want you to worry.

68
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,250
Next time that happens,
you come straight to me!

69
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,625
To be honest, I'm not really
planning on letting that

70
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,666
happen again, so...

71
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,208
Hey.

72
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:20,416
You got any crazy stories of
stuff going down in the library?

73
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,500
Not much happens there,
I suppose.

74
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,708
I just end up reading
books all day.

75
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:26,333
[SUBARU]
That sounds right up your alley.

76
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:28,041
It's just fine by me.

77
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,375
If I were forced to spend time
with those other lunatics

78
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,750
in class, I'd become
one myself, I suppose.

79
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:35,833
Oh. But I thought you had
somebody else working with you,

80
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:36,750
is that right?

81
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:38,916
Mare, if I recall correctly.

82
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,958
That's true, I suppose.
Yeah, she's fine.

83
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:43,125
Coming from you,

84
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,041
that's practically a
gushing compliment.

85
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:47,583
There's nothing really
remarkable about her.

86
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:50,916
But I will say, she makes
me feel so relaxed.

87
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,375
Uh! Um, hey. Uh...

88
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:54,916
Yes, what is it?

89
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,291
Well, this book I'm reading
is pretty good, is all.

90
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:00,625
[BEATRICE]
I'll read it later, I suppose.

91
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:03,166
[MARE gasps, giggles]

92
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,541
Are ya tryin' to tell us
you made a little friend?

93
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,000
That's precious.

94
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:09,708
I'm not saying that at all!
You had to make me upset!

95
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:11,041
So typical.

96
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,291
[MARE] Can you slow down
a little for me, please?

97
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:16,291
Come on. Why don't you
just hurry up instead?

98
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:21,541
Hey! What's up, guys?
How's it going?

99
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:24,000
Wow, I guess you're always
loud and annoying, huh?

100
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:27,083
Yeah, it's just one more
extraordinary thing about me!

101
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:30,208
The fact you're proud of that
is kinda impressive, actually!

102
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:32,166
By the way, how's your
Hamsuke bite?

103
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,041
Oh, that? Just peachy!

104
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,166
[AURA]
Good to hear!

105
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,125
Anyway, I gotta go feed the
big guy, so I'll see ya later!

106
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,458
Cool! Fill him up!

107
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,458
Give him so much he
won't wanna snack on me

108
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,458
when it's my turn
to check on him!

109
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:47,791
[AURA] Yeah, okay, I got it!
I'll make sure to leave

110
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:50,083
just enough space
in his belly for you!

111
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:51,125
Hey!

112
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:54,291
Oh. Lovely morning, isn't it?

113
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,833
Indeed it is, I suppose.

114
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:59,791
Well, okay, I guess I'll
be talking to you later.

115
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:02,875
Not so fast. If you're
going to open the library,

116
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,625
I suppose I'll go with you.

117
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:07,375
[MARE]
Okay!

118
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:08,708
What's up with you?

119
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:11,666
Nothing. I was just thinking
this is kind of fun.

120
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,000
It is, kinda.

121
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,000
Hey, Rem.

122
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:19,125
Emilia came to school pretty
early this morning didn't she?

123
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:20,541
Yes.

124
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,500
She said that she had something
rather important to do.

125
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,041
[SUBARU]
That's weird.

126
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,083
[REM]
Rather odd.

127
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:27,250
[MEGUMIN]
Good morning!

128
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,416
Alright, let's give
it our best today!

129
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,083
Now here's a song that's sure
to get your blood pumping!

130
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:34,500
It's called, "Piercing Howl!
Coal Black Storm!"

131
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,750
[GRANTZ]
No! That's horrible! Here!

132
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,333
[MEGUMIN]
What do you know about music?

133
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:40,666
Just because you don't have the
artistic sense to understand it,

134
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,708
doesn't mean that
it's not good!

135
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:45,291
[REM gasps] I just remembered
something I have to do

136
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:46,625
in the nurse's office.

137
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:48,791
You go on to class,
and I'll see you there.

138
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,083
Cool.

139
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:53,000
What's up, you guys?

140
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,750
Never fear,
Subaru Natsuki's here!

141
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:59,333
Hey, Emilia! You all
look deep in thought.

142
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:00,666
We are.

143
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,291
You know, I spent a lot of
time thinking yesterday.

144
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:04,875
School should be fun.

145
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,250
I want every one of us to have
a good time while we're here.

146
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:08,250
[SUBARU]
Makes sense.

147
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,041
And so... I thought...

148
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:13,000
...that we should all do some
kind of fun activity together.

149
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,916
What do you think.
Is it a good idea?

150
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,166
Well, I trust in
your judgment, so yeah.

151
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:22,083
Let's do something fun!
I'll be more than happy to help.

152
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,750
Thank you. That's sweet.

153
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:29,791
Sure! But, uh.
Are those guys... into "fun?"

154
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:32,958
[AINS]
Hello. I am Ains Ooal Gown.

155
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:35,083
Please, call me Ains.

156
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,500
Oh. Ains, huh?

157
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:37,833
Lord Ains to you!

158
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:38,625
[SUBARU gasps]

159
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,250
[AINS]
Relax, Albedo.

160
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,375
Please forgive me.

161
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:43,958
[AINS]
Sorry about that.

162
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:48,625
Now, regarding Emilia's plan.
I think it's an excellent idea.

163
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,083
[SUBARU]
Huh?

164
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:53,291
[AINS] We may not know why
we're here, but here we are.

165
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:54,875
I suppose you could
say the situation

166
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:57,083
makes us comrades, in a sense.

167
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,333
Comrades?

168
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:00,375
[AINS] There's a strong
argument to be made that

169
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:03,625
getting to know each other would
only help us reach our goal.

170
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:06,250
[MOMONGA] I used to do a lot
of fun stuff with my guild.

171
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,666
I mean, not IRL, of course.

172
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,958
[AINS] I agree that it
would be beneficial,

173
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:13,833
and bring the team together.
What say you, Albedo?

174
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:15,875
You're as wise as
you are handsome.

175
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:18,500
I'll gladly defer to
your wishes, my lord.

176
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:21,083
If you think we should go
along with her plan, so do I.

177
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,625
Alright then, Ains. Let's do it!

178
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:23,625
That's lord Ains!

179
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:24,625
Sorry.

180
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,500
[AINS]
Albedo!

181
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:28,791
[SUBARU]
It's weird,

182
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,916
but I feel like he's
from my world, somehow.

183
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,291
Anyway, it won't hurt
to get along with him.

184
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,875
[AINS] I'll call you Subaru,
so we're even.

185
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,666
Does that work for you, Subaru?

186
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,541
[SUBARU]
Yeah, totally.

187
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:43,375
This is great! You're getting
along wonderfully!

188
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,833
Well, I wouldn't go and pick
out a wedding gift for us yet,

189
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,958
but this is a pretty good start.

190
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:48,750
[AINS]
Hm?

191
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:49,916
[SUBARU]
Huh?

192
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:54,833
[AINS]
Excuse me.

193
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:56,250
[ALBEDO gasps]

194
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:59,833
If you need to fondle a chest,
I'm right here you know?

195
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:00,833
[AINS]
Hmm...

196
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:04,666
[SUBARU]
Uh, wait. I...

197
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,250
[AINS]
Forgive the intrusion.

198
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:09,083
I just noticed something
and had to investigate.

199
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,666
Guess I can cross "having a
skeleton touch my chest"

200
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,500
off my bucket list, now.
That was scary.

201
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:17,708
[AINS laughs] Well, that was
the first time I've done that

202
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,500
without crushing
the person's heart!

203
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,625
[AINS, SUBARU laugh]

204
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,000
That's not even funny!

205
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:26,875
Oh my. You're as thick
as thieves, eh?

206
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,250
Listen carefully,

207
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,958
because I have some news
that I know you will adore.

208
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:31,833
[ALL]
Huh?

209
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,416
We'll be having an excursion,

210
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,166
or I suppose in school, it's
what you'd call a field trip?

211
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,416
Are you serious?

212
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,625
Yes. And what better
place is there

213
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:43,458
to get to know each other
more intimately than a beach?

214
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,333
There'll be fun and sun!

215
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:47,958
Really? We've barely just
gotten past introductions

216
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,458
at this point. Don't you think
that's jumping the gun a bit?

217
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:54,208
Oh silly. Youth goes
by so quickly. Poof!

218
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:55,791
Yeah, that kinda makes sense.

219
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,250
Not how I would
phrase it, but...

220
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:58,791
[AINS]
Hm...

221
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:01,625
Emilia, why don't we organize
an activity while we're away

222
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:03,541
on this so-called "field trip?"

223
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,875
You want to organize
an activity?

224
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:08,416
[AINS]
Yes. That's what I said.

225
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,708
I think we should hold an
offsite event in which the

226
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:12,708
entire class can participate.

227
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,125
That's a wonderful idea!

228
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:17,041
Once again,
you're so right, my lord!

229
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,333
I wonder what exactly we'll do.

230
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,833
Hm. I'll try to
think of something.

231
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:23,708
Thanks Ains. Good work!

232
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,250
She may be smiling
at someone else,

233
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,625
but I still think
Emilia's a real angel.

234
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,875
For short: "E. R. A."

235
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:33,291
I'm sorry. Was that supposed
to make sense, or..?

236
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:34,708
[ALBEDO]
Sounded like gibberish to me.

237
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,500
[ROSWAAL] I suppose I
can leave it to the kids

238
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:40,416
for the time being.
Best... of... luck!
