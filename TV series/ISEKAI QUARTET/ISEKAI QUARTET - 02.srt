1
00:00:11,666 --> 00:00:13,541
[ROSWAAL] If we're to have a
harmonious school life together,

2
00:00:13,625 --> 00:00:16,416
we'll first need to
establish the rules, 'kay?

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,750
You'll all be sharing this
classroom as fellow students,

4
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:21,500
so it's important that
everybody plays nice.

5
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:23,083
So, Roz, hey.

6
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:24,708
I'm your teacher.

7
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:28,708
So, uh, Mister Roz.
Why the hell are we here?

8
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:30,250
To experience school life.

9
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,750
Oh, yeah. Good ol' school life!

10
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:34,208
Where boys become men!

11
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:37,458
And girls blossom
into full-grown women!

12
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:39,500
So then why is this classroom
packed with these freaks

13
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:42,625
that probably shouldn't even be
allowed anywhere near a school?

14
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:47,083
[KAZUMA]
Huh?

15
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:49,000
It would appear the first
lesson you need to learn

16
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:51,625
is that you should never
judge a book by its cover.

17
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:53,291
You better hope that
they don't judge you

18
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:54,375
by the way you look.

19
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:55,916
[SUBARU]
Don't start with me.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,583
--[AINS clears throat]
--You think we all belong here?

21
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:01,333
[AINS] So if I
understand the situation,

22
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:04,416
what you're trying to tell us
is we've been assembled here

23
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,666
to make it through
this trial together,

24
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,458
as part of some kind
of "school life"--

25
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:10,750
that's our objective?

26
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:13,916
You've just hit a
bull's-eye. Spot on!

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,333
[AINS]
What if I refuse?

28
00:01:15,416 --> 00:01:18,291
Refusal is simply not an option.

29
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:20,750
Because violating the rules...

30
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:23,625
...means you will be
punished accordingly.

31
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,791
[KAZUMA]
Hmm...

32
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:58,375
Is something the matter?

33
00:02:58,458 --> 00:02:59,500
Eh, that guy.

34
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:01,416
[DARKNESS]
Hm?

35
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,958
[MEGUMIN] Oh, he's wearing the
same stupid looking outfit

36
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:05,041
you used to wear.

37
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:07,291
I thought I looked pretty cool.

38
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,083
[REM]
Excuse me, Subaru.

39
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:10,500
Yeah. What's up?

40
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:11,875
That boy over there,

41
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,416
he seems to be extremely
interested in you.

42
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,708
[SUBARU]
Hm?

43
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:17,083
[KAZUMA]
Uh.

44
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,541
Tell me. What did
you do this time?

45
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:22,208
So, we're doing the ol'
"blame Subaru" bit, are we?

46
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:24,250
I know for a fact
I didn't do anything.

47
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:27,000
Now, listen up, everybody, okay?

48
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:30,291
It's time to tell your
classmates just who you are.

49
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:33,375
Subaru, let's begin
with you, eh?

50
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:35,666
[SUBARU]
No prob.

51
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,833
[SUBARU breathes deeply]

52
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,708
My name's Subaru Natsuki.

53
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:42,250
If I'm not the most clueless,
I'm the brokest one here!

54
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,291
Nice to meet you guys!

55
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:48,208
It's comforting to see
that no matter

56
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:50,958
what world we happen to be in,
nobody thinks you're funny.

57
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:53,208
Just couldn't resist
the dig, could ya?!

58
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,375
[ROSWAAL] Will the next
person speak up, please?

59
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:56,625
Yes!

60
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,916
Hi. My name is Emilia.

61
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,875
It's a pleasure to meet you.

62
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:03,583
And my name's Puck,
spirit extraordinaire.

63
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:06,666
Lia-- Um, that's just
what I call her.

64
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,416
Anyway, mess with Lia,
you're dealing with me!

65
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,041
Now don't be so over protective.

66
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,375
[AINS]
Hmm...

67
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,000
[MOMONGA]
A spirit and an elf--

68
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,166
No. More like a half-elf.

69
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:20,250
Assuming their races are similar
to what's in Yggdrasil.

70
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:21,333
I'm Ram.

71
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,458
And this is my
little sister Rem.

72
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:26,375
Hello. Nice to meet you all.

73
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,041
My name is Beatrice.

74
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,250
Can't say it's nice to meet
any of you, I suppose.

75
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,208
And I suppose, you'll
never make any friends

76
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:33,750
with that crappy attitude.

77
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:36,125
If you think I care, you're
a bigger idiot than I thought.

78
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:37,250
You really get under...

79
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,041
Is it possible to
be that unpleasant?

80
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,541
[VISHA chuckles nervously]

81
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,791
Very well then.
I believe it's my turn.

82
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:43,875
[VISHA]
Huh?

83
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:46,291

[MOMONGA] Uhh... are they
from some kinda war world?

00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:23,958
[SUBARU] Whoa, that girl
reminds me of you, Beako!

95
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,166
Gotta be nice to her.

96
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,708
Stop treating me like a toddler!

97
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:28,541
I'm older than
you are, remember?

98
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:31,375
And I don't have to be nice to
anybody if I don't feel like it!

99
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:32,458
[SUBARU]
Whatever.

100
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:35,250

Ooh! Me! It's my turn, right?

[clears throat]

102
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,333
I stand before you as the
omnipotent goddess of wa--

103
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:42,958
Just call her Aqua, okay?

104
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,041
[AQUA]
Huh?

105
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:47,750
I'm Kazuma. She's Meg.
Ignore that one.

106
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,333
What the hell's wrong with you?!

107
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,000
I was just starting
my awesome introduction

108
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,750
and you had to go
and step all over it!

109
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:53,875
How dare you!

110
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:55,500
As the greatest of
the crimson demons,

111
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,791
this is my time to shine!

112
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:59,208
He said to "ignore that one."

113
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,958
"That one..."
Like some useless object!

114
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:03,666
Oh, so you're ignoring
all of us, now?!

115
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,916
Oh, my.

116
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,833
[AQUA] I guess you're
just a huge jerk...

117
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:08,333
Well, the only
one left is you.

118
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:10,750
[AQUA] Do I really not get
to finish my introduction?!

119
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:13,291
Ahh! This sucks!

[AINS sighs]

121
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,791
[AINS] Hopefully, the
achievement is worth

122
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:20,625
the nuisance of this
"school life" level.

123
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,708
I'll go first.

124
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:28,166
[AINS] Behold. I am Lord of

[AINS]
Uh...

00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,625
[ROSWAAL]
Oh my, what's wrong, young lady?

129
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:41,291
Are we feeling a
little "fainty" today?

130
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:42,875
You've got the wrong idea!

131
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:44,833
Did you not see
Lord Ains just now?!

132
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,166
Did his greatness not awaken

133
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,250
something deep
within your loins?

134
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,125
Oh my goodness. Well...

135
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,625
T.M.I.

136
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:55,750
So, let's get back to your
introduction later, shall we?

137
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:56,750
--Okay, class.
--Not so fast!

138

[ROSWAAL]
Hmm?!

00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,875
My lord spoke and so shall I!

140
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:02,708
You will know every
one of our names.

141
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:06,000
Everyone. Identify
yourselves, now!

142
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:07,500
[GROUP]
Right!

143
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:10,458
I am the guardian of the first,
second, and third floors.

[COCYTUS] Guardian of

Guardian of the sixth floor.

Sixth floor. Mare Bello Fiore!

Seventh floor guardian.
Demiurge.

149
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,791
And I hold the
position of overseer

00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,958
of the Nazarick Floor Guardians.

I'm Albedo.

154
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,291
How delightful.

155
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:42,916
It seems we have
quite the variety

156
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
of colorful students here,
don't we, class?

157
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,458
[MOMONGA] Jeez, the undead
aren't supposed to get tired,

158
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:55,833
but damn.

159
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:58,208
[AINS]
I'm exhausted.

160
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:02,625
[MOMONGA]
So, here I am in another world.

161
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:05,416
I have the same body
I did in the last one.

162
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,500
Still, something
feels different.

163
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:09,833
[grunts]

164
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,500
[AINS]
What do you want?

165
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:15,708
Listen!

166
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:18,958
Undead and your creepy cronies,

167
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,625
I don't know what world this is
or what we're even doing here,

168
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,458
but no matter what
dump world this is,

169
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:25,000
it's my sacred duty as a god

170
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:28,500
to make sure your kind isn't
free to roam however you please!

171
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:31,166
[AINS]
A god, is that so?

172
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,500
Oh, yeah! You're welcome.

173
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:35,833
For I, goddess of
the order of Axis,

174
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,666
and the goddess
of water, Aqua...

175
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,833
...shall personally send all
of you on to your next lives!

176
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:42,750
[AQUA yelps]

177
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,250
[AINS gasps]

178
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:45,458
The Hell?

179
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:46,916
Starting a fight on
the first day of school

180
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,458
is not "being best"!

181
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:51,458
Come on! Can't you see
it's an undead?

182
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:53,458
And it's with
a demon, a vampire,

183
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,291
and whatever the
hell that thing is!

184
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:56,625
They're totes evil!

185
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,916
So what else is a goddess
supposed to do, huh?!

186
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,625
--Turn undead!
--No, Aqua, don't do it!

187
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:05,875
[AINS] I'm not worried.
That's a low-level spell.

188
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:08,666
[screaming]

189
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,333
[MOMONGA] How the hell
can it pack so much punch?

190
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,625
[groans]

191
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,958
Oh, no! That spell
didn't work on him?!

192
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,583
[AQUA yelps]

193
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:22,208
Kazuma! You didn't
have to hit me, ya know!

194
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:23,708
[KAZUMA]
Well, I think I did.

195
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:26,666
Kazuma, can't you tell that
I'm obviously not done here?

196
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,291
We can't just leave now!

197
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,208
What if this is another
quest and taking them out

198
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,791
--Hey. Sorry.
--is what we're supposed to do?

199
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,291
[AINS]
It's... fine.

200
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:35,541
[AQUA]
I'll get you, undead!

201
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,125
Mark my words,
I'll banish you from this world

202
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:38,583
if it's the last thing I do!

203
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:41,875
Ugh! This isn't over,
you hear me?!

204
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:43,083
[AINS]
A goddess who can make

205
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,916
even a hundredth-level
like me feel pain,

206
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,375
walking around with a human

207
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:50,041
who can just punch her
like it's nothing...

208
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,250
Whatever world this is,

209
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:55,625
it has some serious
power balance issues!

210
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:59,666
[bell rings]

211
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,125
[ROSWAAL]
Pay attention, everyone.

212
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,708
Miss Aqua was violent towards

213
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:04,250
one of her new
friends yesterday.

214
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,875
That means she's in big trouble.

215
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:10,416
Why am I being punished?
It was all their fault.

216
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,583
Yo. What's shakin',
water goddess?

217
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,708
You told on me, didn't you?

218
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,375
No wonder you were
a lonely dweeb

219
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:18,291
that didn't have any
friends in real life!

220
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:21,291
Nobody likes a tattle-tale.
Get away from me, you freak!

221
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,666
[SUBARU snores]

222
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,416
[AQUA]
Everybody, leave me alone!

223
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:46,541
[KURT]
So, tell us.

224
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:49,083
How are the new students doing?

225
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,416
They're fascinating,
I must say.

226
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,916
Ah. Unfortunately, they've
yet to really open up.

227
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I see. Then why don't
we try "that"?

228
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:00,000
Ah, yes. "That."
