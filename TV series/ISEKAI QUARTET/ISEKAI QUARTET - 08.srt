00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:12,333
[AINS]
As you know,

2
00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:14,541
our class is going on a
field trip to the beach.

3
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:15,958
While on that excursion,

4
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:18,333
I propose we hold
a group activity.

5
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:21,625
If there are any objections,
please raise your hand.

6
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:23,083
[KAZUMA]
Is he kidding?

7
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:25,666
Nobody's gonna go against
that scary skeleton's plans!

8
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:58,041
[AINS] It would appear there
are no objections, so--

9
00:01:58,125 --> 00:01:59,375
[AQUA]
I object!

10
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:02,625
[KAZUMA]
Whoa! Seriously?

11
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:05,375
Why the hell do you insist on
starting fights with this guy?

12
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,375
Because I won't go along with
any plans hatched by an undead!

13
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:10,125
I won't! I won't! I won't!

14
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:14,500
Uh. Actually... It was my idea.

15
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:18,250
I thought... You know...
Since we're all classmates now.

16
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:21,000
And it's the first thing
we're doing together.

17
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:24,291
I don't completely understand
what a "field trip" entails.

18
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:27,875
But it's a chance for all of us
to become better friends, right?

19
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:30,291
When you put it
that way, I guess--

20
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:32,291
[KAZUMA grunting]

21
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:34,041
Uh. I guess you're right.

22
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:36,833
We should do something as
a class. Sounds good to me!

23
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:39,208
So, everybody...
let's hear your ideas!

24
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:40,791
[RAM] How about you
sit down and shut up?

25
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:43,541
I'm hoping we can do something
that's a little sexy.

26
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,541
With just a touch of romance.

27
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:49,208
[ALBEDO] Oh yes!
Something sexy! And romantic!

28
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:50,416
[ALBEDO sighs]

29
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,083
Oh man, that was a
whole lotta blood!

30
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:54,625
She needs medical help,
right now!

31
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:57,750
I'm one of the
class nurses, but uh...

32
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:01,291
The other nurse seems to have
gotten a nosebleed, too.

33
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:05,250
I can just imagine all the sexy
and romantic things we could do.

34
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:08,250
[EMILIA]
Now "fishing" is on the list.

35
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,916
Any other suggestions for
a fun group activity?

36
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,416
We make stuff explode!

37
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,500
Test of strength!

38
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,166
[AINS]
Great. No suggestions.

39
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,833
[BOTH gasp]

40
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:20,291
Okay. There seems to be a
lot to do during the day.

41
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:23,375
[AINS] I see, we'll want
something after nightfall.

42
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:24,833
You think so?!

43
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:28,250
[AINS] I mean for everyone
to do once it gets dark out.

44
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,416
You mean a group thing?

45
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,083
[AINS] I think they're
getting the wrong idea.

46
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:35,958
[PUCK exhales]

47
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,666
Hey, Lia. It looks like we
should get ready to go home.

48
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,833
Yeah, you're right.
It's quittin' time.

49
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:43,666
"Quittin' time?" does she
think we work on a farm?

50
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,541
It is well past "shutting
up time" for you.

51
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:49,291
[AINS] Does anybody
have a good suggestion?

52
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:51,125
[AQUA] He said "good" ones,
so put your hand down.

53
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,833
Be quiet!

54
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,958
How about a test of courage?

55
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:56,625
Test of courage, huh?

56
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,958
[KAZUMA]
Yeah! It screams "night time."

57
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:01,500
You're joking, right?
Come on, bro!

58
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:02,833
[KAZUMA]
Huh?

59
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:05,250
I mean, just take a look
at some of our classmates.

60
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:08,625
It's a "test of courage"
to be sitting here.

61
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,750
[KAZUMA]
Yeah, I kinda see your point.

62
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,625
[SUBARU] Though, I do see the
appeals of a situation where

63
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:15,000
the girl's gonna be,
like "ooh, I'm so scared"

64
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:16,916
[SUBARU] The dude's like
"Don't worry, I'm here."

65
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,958
[SUBARU in girly voice]
"Oh, you're so manly, ooh!"

66
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,583
[SUBARU] And you can feel their
fun bags when they grab you!

67
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,166
Sorry, I mean boobies.

68
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,791
So, are you crazy?
Or just stupid?

69
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:28,375
I've already got Ram to
bust my chops, ya know?

70
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:31,166
He's actually an annoying
blend of stupid and crazy.

71
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,500
You never miss
an opportunity, do ya?

72
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:35,375
Great idea!

73
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:36,708
[SUBARU]
Huh?

74
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:39,375
So let's do it! I'll take
the test with Lord Ains!

75
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,375
It sounds perfect to me!

76
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:43,291
[AINS]
Hm?

77
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:46,291
Well, will that kind of
thing work for everybody?

78
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:51,791
Perfect. Looks like a test of
courage it is. Great idea.

79
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,750
I'll ask Mister Roswaal to make
the preparations for us.

80
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,750
--[AINS] Mmm.
--[School bell rings]

81
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,625
And that means class is over.

We should all go shopping now.

[MEGUMIN] I need to head
over to the intercom room.

84
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,208
[DARKNESS]
And I gotta get to the gym.

Oh, Kazuma!

--[KAZUMA] No way.
--[AQUA] You're no fun!

That was awesome. Great job!

Aw... Thanks so much.
Oh, and by the way...

89
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,666
Huh?

90
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:18,000
This 'test of courage" thing.
What is it?

91
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:25,416
[TANYA] I suppose we'll
need swim suits.

92
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,125
I guess. I've never worn
anything like that.

93
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:30,708
Just remember that it doesn't
have to be super-revealing

94
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:32,791
to be functional.

95
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,583
I'm a little nervous because
the men always love to tease me

96
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,208
and say I'm not very womanly.

97
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:40,125
That's what you get when you
offer pearls before swine?

98
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,916
Yeah, good point. Thank you.

99
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,833
[TANYA]
Honestly, I'm glad to hear it.

100
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:47,458
The battlefield is hell.
I don't need my guys

be trying to keep us alive.

so wonderfully provocative.

Oh! I just love this one.

104
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,958
Just imagine Lord Ains
wearing it.

105
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,916
It'd really show off
his manliness.

That one definitely
does have its charms.

But what about this
sexy little number?

108

There's not much to imagine.

109

You can look straight at his
exposed pelvic bone.

Oh no! Get a hold of yourself!

finding something
revealing is a priority.

chance to make an impression,

will those swim trunks

This is a chance for us all

to become better friends...

Hey, uh, sorry about
that, ladies.

I realize you've gotten
off to a rocky start,

but I think you can all
get past your differences.

Yes, maybe.

135
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:15,666
In fact, Lord Ains himself
said something very similar.

136
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,833
And it is our duty
to obey his commands.

We've got no
real choice, do we?

Yeah, see? You're the only
one who's being childish.

139
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:27,166
Whatever. Don't be smug. I don't
really want to be friends with

140
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,791
a succubus and a vampire,
but I'll stop messing with them.

141

That's better.

142
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:36,041
Just because they're a vampire
and a succubus, doesn't mean--

Succubus?!

Yes, go on and spit it out.

146
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,541
What she said's true?
You're really a succubus?

That a problem? Why do you ask?

148
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,625
So that means you, uh, go into--

Now that is funny. Whew!

totally gives his thoughts away.

155
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,458
[ALBEDO]
It's rather unattractive.

156
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,791
You're called Kazuma,
aren't you?

157
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:13,541
Let me tell you a little
secret about your classmate.

158
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,041
[SHALLTEAR] Whisper, whisper,
whisper, whisper, whisper...

159
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:17,750
[KAZUMA gasps]

160
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,416
[SHALLTEAR] I realize that
may be hard to believe,

161
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,208
but it's 100 percent true.

162
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:23,541
[KAZUMA] It's actually amazing,
in a weird way.

163
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,125
I bet you never would
have guessed that,

164
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:26,625
now would you?

165
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:29,958
So tell me. What is this
"amazing" piece of info?

166
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,458
Nothing much. Just the
fact that this succubus

167
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,958
is still as pure as
the driven snow.

168
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:39,000
--[SHALLTEAR laughs]
--[ALBEDO gasps, growls]

169
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,625
Shalltear!

170
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,125
[KAZUMA gasps]

171
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:46,333
Oh my goodness. You have
to admit, it's pretty hilarious!

172
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:48,333
Your main purpose is to seduce
men, but you're still a virgin!

173
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:52,000
It is not funny!
Only Lord Ains deserves me!

174
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,625
Who cares, anyway?

175
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:55,416
[KAZUMA, SHALLTEAR]
Hm?

176
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,958
There's no reason for anybody
to laugh at her for that.

177
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:00,958
She's just saving herself
for the one she loves.

178
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,250
Aqua?

179
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,916
[AQUA] And who gives a
crap what race she is?

180
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,833
There's no reason to be ashamed.
You should be proud of yourself.

181
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:13,000
You know. Once in a blue moon,
you kinda make sense.

182
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:16,666
I am a goddess, remember?
Anyway, my point is

183
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,541
that you can't judge people
over stuff like that.

184
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,333
If you live your
life authentically,

185
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:24,500
be proud of what you do.

186
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:27,291
Oh! Except one thing.

187
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,958
You should never take
pride in padding your bra.

188
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,416
[SHALLTEAR gasps]

189
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,208
So you're flat? That's fine.
There's no reason to lie

190
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,083
about it and stuff
that boulder holder.

191
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,958
There's a junior goddess
named Eris I know.

192
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:40,541
And she's, like,
totally guilty of that.

193
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:43,166
Her job is to listen to lies
and confessions and stuff,

194
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,916
so why won't she come clean
about her little bug bites?

195
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,041
[ALBEDO laughs]

196
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:52,166
You are so right.

197
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,791
It's definitely something
to ridicule!

198
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:56,333
Yeah, it's true.
Really dishonest and shameful.

199
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:58,250
[SHALLTEAR gasps]

200
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:01,125
Shalltear, you heard the lady.

201
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:04,125
[SHALLTEAR] If I'm not mistaken,
your name's Aqua, isn't it?

202
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,041
[AQUA]
Yep.

203
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:06,500
You're dead!

204
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,833
You need to calm down,
Shalltear.

205
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:12,500
Don't forget what
Lord Ains told us!

206
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:13,791
[AQUA]
Hm?

207
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,291
Not sure, but I
think you may have

208
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,458
accidentally upset
her just a bit.

209
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,833
[ALBEDO] Part of getting along
is not stuffing your bra!

210
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,333
You'll make her angry!

211
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:25,875
What in the hell is all that
caterwauling about in there?

212
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,500
Major! What do you
think about this one?

213
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:31,083
It is gonna look
super cute on me!

214
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:53,916
Boys and girls
at the beach, eh?

215
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,333
That's a recipe for some drama.

216
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,416
[GRANTZ]
Just ring me up, pal.

217
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,750
[TOUGH GUY]
Heh!
