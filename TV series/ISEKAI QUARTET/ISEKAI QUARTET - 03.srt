1
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:13,291
[TANYA] Greetings to my
beloved Fatherland.

2
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:16,541
And to all the backwards
territories surrounding it.

3
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:20,750
At the moment, I am currently
engaged in what could be called

4
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:22,708
"academic pursuits."

5
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:55,458
[sighs]

6
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:58,125
[TANYA] Yes, this is
exactly what I wanted!

7
00:01:58,208 --> 00:02:00,416
A stable, civilized,
non-threatening life

8
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,208
in the rear echelon.

9
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:05,125
I've found myself in a setting
centered on learning.

10
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,958
One that has nothing
to do with war.

11
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:11,458
However... Though my current
station may sound peaceful,

12
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:12,708
when I look around,

13
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:14,583
I have to wonder what
the hell is going on.

14
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:17,708
The battlefield is chaotic,
but at least it makes sense.

15
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:20,416
What's more, General Rudersdorf
is serving as the principal,

16
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,208
and General Zettour
is our vice-principal?

17
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:26,375
Then there's the clownish,
yodeling fool in front.

18
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:29,500
Come to think of it, this world
may be even more confusing

19
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:33,125
than that hellish nightmare
I was sent to before.

20
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:35,291
But still...

21
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:36,875
[ALBEDO growls]

22
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:38,958
[ROSWAAL]
Your name is Albedo, yes?

23
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:39,583
[ALBEDO]
Hm?

24
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:42,041
Don't even try it.

25
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:44,916
I don't believe you have the
authority to give me orders!

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,875
Please, try to remember
it's very important

27
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,583
that we all get along here.

28
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:52,041
We don't want any
problems now, do we?

29
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:54,166
Although it is a
rhetorical question,

30
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,708
the answer is still
an emphatic, "no, sir."

31
00:02:57,791 --> 00:03:00,083
I see now, that's how it is.

32
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:02,291
You see what's how what is?

33
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:04,625
Mister Roswaal seems to
be outlining the rules

34
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,958
we're to follow.
He's implying any behavior

35
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:11,000
that would jeopardize our quote,
unquote, "school life" is taboo.

36
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:13,875
I hear you talking,
but it's all noise to me.

37
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:15,958
Then perhaps this will help.

38
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:17,750
We're trapped in this world.

39
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:21,333
And some force is compelling
us to pretend we're students.

40
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:23,166
[SHALLTEAR]
Hm...

41
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,791
[MOMONGA]
Oh man, really?

42
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:26,625
Our liege understood
this situation

43
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,041
from the very beginning.

44
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,791
[MOMONGA] I didn't know
it from the beginning!

45
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:32,166
Hell, I still don't have a clue!

46
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:36,625
[AINS] An astute observation,
Demiurge. It's like that.

47
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,541
It is, indeed.

48
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:40,041
[AINS]
Yes. That thing.

49
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:42,125
Indeed, it is.

50
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,833
[MOMONGA]
What thing?

51
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:46,083
[AINS] We get it,
but everyone except you and I,

52
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:48,000
don't seem to grasp that thing.

53
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:50,166
So you must explain it to them.

54
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,541
As you wish.

55
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:56,500
Let us just assume that this
world is covered by some type of

56
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:59,875
barrier which has a compulsory
effect on those within.

57
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:02,291
There are no further
details at the moment.

58
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,958
But I'd wager that engaging in
any action deemed threatening

59
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:09,125
to the balance here could bar
us from returning home.

60
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,875
[MOMONGA]
Oh, so that's the thing.

61
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,208
[COCYTUS]
Which is why you demanded

62
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,333
we refrain from combat.

63
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:19,083
[AINS] Uh, ahem. Yes, correct.
Well done, Demiurge.

64
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:22,625
No. I should have realized
this much sooner. Forgive me.

65
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:25,083
[AINS] Even the wisest
in Nazarick needs time

66
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,875
to process such things.

67
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:29,458
[TANYA]
I have to admit,

68
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:32,833
what the lackey is saying seems
to make a little bit of sense.

69
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,250
I suppose for the time being,

70
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:36,625
I'll have to operate
under these parameters.

71
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,791
Major! Major Degurechaff!

72
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,000
[TANYA]
Huh?

73
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,666
I received this communique.

74
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,166
[TANYA]
Let's see.

75
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,916
"Our class will be holding a
talent show. This mandatory

76
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,125
activity will let us get to
know each other better."

77
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:52,416
What is this nonsense?

78
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,333
[EMILIA]
Hey, Subaru?

79
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:57,625
What kind of talents are
you supposed to showcase

80
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,166
at a talent show?

81
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:03,041
[SUBARU] Hm... Entertaining
little party tricks, I guess.

82
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:04,166
Crap like that.

83
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,041
What are party tricks?

84
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,625
[SUBARU]
Ya know, something you can do,

85
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:11,166
that maybe other people can't.
Talent is in the name.

86
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,666
Then perhaps you should show
off your uncanny ability

87
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,208
to fail at life?

88
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,750
Can you say anything without
taking a personal shot at me?

89
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,083
[RAM] If you could do something
else, we'd know by now.

90
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:22,125
Man, don't write me
off like that.

91
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:24,500
I may have a hidden talent
that is so freakin' awesome,

92
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:26,250
it'll blow you away.

93
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:26,708
[RAM]
Nope.

94
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:28,083
Hey now!

95
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:29,333
[PUCK]
But you know,

96
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:31,833
if Subaru does have some
amazing secret talent,

97
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,708
I'd honestly love to see it.

98
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,750
[SUBARU] Don't talk with your
mouth full, it's gross.

99
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:40,875
What I wouldn't give to learn
about all your biggest secrets.

100
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:44,250
I'm curious as well.
I wonder what you can do.

101
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,791
Ooh, you ladies are in for it!

102
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:49,083
Just when you think you might
know everything about me.

103
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,875
I'll whip something out
that'll knock your

104
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:54,666
frilly little socks off!
Stop nomming, will ya?

105
00:05:56,166 --> 00:06:00,208
My talents are quite obvious.
I have no need to present them.

106
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,750
[BOTH gasp]

107
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:08,708
You realize a photograph
would last longer?

108
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:11,791
Of course. I'm sorry,
little girl. Truly.

109
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,625
Not nearly as sorry as you'll be
if you continue addressing me

110
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,625
as "little girl". In fact,
don't address me at all.

111
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:20,875
My friend here is no good
with kids. Excuse him.

112
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:24,250
[BEATRICE grunts] Were you all
trained to be insufferable,

113
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:25,916
or is that just
a coincidence?

114
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,583
[BEATRICE growls]

115
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,916
[WEISS gasps]

116
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,166
What did you do to
that little girl?

117
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,875
It seems like you've upset her.

118
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:36,625
Nothing, sir. We've been
extremely polite.

119
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:39,583
Are you sure?
She looked rather irate.

120
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:42,583
You know, captain. It's always
something with those types.

121
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:43,791
Am I right?

122
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:47,083
Yeah, like a certain
battalion commander, eh?

123
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:48,166
Damn straight.

124
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,583
[KOENIG, NUEMANN chuckle]

125
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:52,166
I see. I'll be sure to include
that in my next report

126
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,333
to the commander.

127
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:54,541
[KOENIG]
Captain, if she heard that,

128
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,791
she'd use my balls
for target practice.

129
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:57,583
[NUEMANN]
Yup.

130
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,083
[KOENIG, WEISS laugh]

131
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:03,166
[grunts] Roswaal's definitely
got some explaining to do.

132
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,041
Surely he'll tell me what's
going on if I demand it!

133
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,708
Roswaal in here, I suppose?

134
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:12,250
[ERICH] Uh... Oh uh,
your name is Beatrice,

135
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,416
if I'm not mistaken?

136
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,583
Yes, that's correct. And who
in the hell might you be?

137
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,750
[ERICH] Well, first,
you shouldn't talk

138
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:21,250
to your teachers like that.

139
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,250
I haven't agreed to
be your student!

140
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:27,666
Besides, I've come here to have
a word with Roswaal. Not you.

141
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,333
So, where is he?

142
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,833
[ERICH grunts]

143
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:35,333
Now Beatrice, you must not
talk to any teacher like that.

144
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:38,500
Like it or not, you and all
the others are students.

145
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,958
Here for the express purpose of
experiencing school life.

146
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:46,583
Therefore, you need to start
behaving like students.

147
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,666
[BEATRICE grumbles]

148
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,791
[ERICH]
You understand?

149
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,416
I get it. I suppose.

150
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,166
Tell Mister Roswaal that
Betty came by to see him,

151
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,333
if you would please.

152
00:07:57,416 --> 00:08:00,541
Much better. I shall
pass that along.

153
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:05,208
Now, lunch break's almost over.
Please return to your classroom.

154
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:08,708
You don't need to tell
me what to do. Hmph!

155
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:17,000
[sighs] Was I coming across
too harshly? Perhaps.

156
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:20,250
But no matter how she may look,
I can't let my guard down.

157
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,333
After all. I know firsthand
there are monsters who

158
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,583
walk this world in the
form of little girls.

159
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,375
[TANYA sneezes]

160
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:28,625
Do you have a cold?

161
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:29,458
No.

162
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,041
[AQUA]
Goddess bless you!

163
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,500
[KAZUMA]
Huh?

164
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:33,791
So what's her deal?

165
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:34,958
[VISHA chuckles nervously]

166
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,708
Show a little gratitude,
would ya?

167
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:39,000
Wait. Do ya understand
why I said that?

168
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,000
Check it. When someone
sneezes, you say,

169
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:42,333
"God, bless you."
But I'm a goddess, see?

170
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:44,416
[TANYA]
God bless you?

171
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,916
God. God?

172
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,583
Did she have to say it?
That word makes my blood boil.

173
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:54,583
I can't not think about
that bastard, "Being X."

174
00:08:54,666 --> 00:09:01,458
[TANYA gasps]
Wait. That one. Is he?

175
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:06,458
[AINS]
Hm?

176
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,000
[TANYA]
We need to talk.

177
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,500
[MOMONGA]
What? Why me?

178
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:16,666
Got it? Come to the park
by the school after class.

179
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,625
[AINS] Why? I'm more than
willing to converse here.

180
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:22,375
It's private. There are
too many eyes and ears.

181
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:25,041
[ALBEDO growls]
Say what?

182
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,041
You want to talk
to my Lord Ains?

183
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:29,375
We all know what you
really want, bimbo!

184
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:30,833
[AINS]
Calm down, Albedo.

185
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:33,125
No. If this hussy
wants to mount you,

186
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,416
I swear that I will
slap her silly!

187
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,541
I'll pulverize her!
I'll rip out her hair!

188
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:39,958
"Slap her silly"

189
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:42,666
kinda sounds like the type
of thing Meelee would say.

190
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,375
[AINS]
Albedo, she's just a child!

191
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:47,291
I don't give a damn about
her gender, race, or age.

192
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:48,708
Have you seen yourself?

193
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:51,291
Your sex appeal penetrates
the whole spectrum.

194
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:52,750
[AINS]
Besides, we've just met.

195
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:55,666
[REM]
That doesn't matter at all!

196
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,166
Stay out of it, okay?

197
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,833
You can fall in love. Even with
someone you've just met.

198
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:02,666
[growls]

199
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,750
This little maid
knows what's up!

200
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:08,083
I mean, I've only known
Subaru for a short while.

201
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:10,333
[ALBEDO] I don't know what
a "Subaru" is, but okay.

202
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:13,833
It's this guy right here.
He's very important to me.

203
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,583
And you're saying that without
anyone forcing you to.

204
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,916
[ALBEDO] I think you and I
have some things in common.

205
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,083
[REM] Sorry for not
introducing myself...

206
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:22,625
[TANYA]
Why don't we go now instead?

207
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,916
[AINS]
Very well.

208
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,666
[REM]
Yes, nice to meet you.

209
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:31,416
[ALBEDO gasps]
No! Lord Ains is gone!

210
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,041
[ALBEDO gasps]
Move, you scum!

211
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:36,000
Class is starting now!

212
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:38,791
[ALBEDO grunts]

213
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,666
That floozy!
