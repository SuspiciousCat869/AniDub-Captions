00:00:10,958 --> 00:00:12,458
[ROSWAAL]
Okay, students.

2
00:00:12,541 --> 00:00:16,083
Let's get this talent show
underway now, shall we?

3
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:19,500
Inside this box are papers
with everyone's names.

4
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:22,250
I'll draw them one by one,
and when your name is called,

5
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:25,625
come up and show us
what makes you special!

6
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:28,250
Let's see...!

7
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:31,833
Mister Rerugen!

8
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:33,083
Huh?

9
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,333
But, Mister Roswaal.

10
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,750
I'm no student, why do
I have to participate?

11
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:08,333
[COCYTUS]
Remember.

12
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:12,625
You said yourself that Mister
Roswaal said "that it'd be fun?"

13
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:14,708
So that settles it, then!

14
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:16,833
[COCYTUS exhales]

15
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:20,041
We are all trying to be
friendly here, now aren't we?

16
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:21,833
So why don't you be
little Mister Icebreaker

17
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:24,166
and help kick off the show!

18
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,208
[groans]

19
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:29,291
[ERICH] I am Erich von Rerugen.
TA of class two A.

20
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:31,000
And for my talent today,

21
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:33,541
I shall sing for you
the song of my people!

22
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:35,458
[TANYA gasps]

23
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:40,541
[ERICH singing in
foreign language]

24
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:47,750
You see this Kazuma?

25
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:49,375
I'm Kazuma and I'm seeing this.

26
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:51,083
He's humiliating
himself up there.

27
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:52,333
[KAZUMA]
Sure is.

28
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:53,708
[DARKNESS] The humans
and non-humans alike.

29
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:55,375
Everyone is looking
at him with disgust.

30
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:56,333
[KAZUMA]
Poor guy.

31
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:57,625
[DARKNESS]
There's no question!

32
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:59,416
At this very moment,
he is the most disgraced,

33
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,333
most embarrassed
creature on the planet!

34
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:02,791
[KAZUMA]
Uh. This sounds familiar.

35
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:05,333
[ERICH] Can I stop?
I'm dying up here!

36
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:09,041
[sighs] If only everybody
would look at me that way.

37
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:10,416
With those eyes that say,

38
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,333
"How can you even stand
to live with yourself?"

39
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:14,625
[RAM grunts]

[singing continues]

41
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,833
[ERICH]
Kill me...

42
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:21,250
[ROSWAAL]
Next, who will it be?

43
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,708
Oh my. Subaru, you're up.

44
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:26,125
[SUBARU]
Oh yeah! Awesome!

45
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:27,666
This rules.

46
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,291
'Cause I don't know how I could
do any worse than that dude.

47
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,791
That was bad.

48
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:33,000
But I can't honestly imagine
you can do anything better.

49
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:36,208
Predictably taking yet
another dig at me. It's cool.

50
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,666
You'll change your tune after
you witness my amazing talent.

51
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,083
Oh, that was breathtaking!

52
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:43,083
I haven't even done it yet.

53
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:45,791
Okay! I'm holding in my hand...

54
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,583
...plain ol string.

55
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:51,041
Look closely and you'll see
there are no cuts and no knots.

56
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:55,375
Ah-ha, but watch this and...
a little more of this.

57
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:56,208
And...

58
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,583
Tokyo Tower!

59

Lame.

No! I knew it was
gonna be boring!

61
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:07,208
No way. I loved it, Subaru!

62
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:09,291
I have no idea what
you made, but still...

63
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,958
[ROSWAAL]
Who do we have up now?

64
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:14,500
Rem. I hope you're ready!

65
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,541

Sure!

66
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:17,916
Huh?

69
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,375
[COCYTUS]
Impressive.

70
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,958
She has a tremendous amount
of skill with that weapon.

71
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:33,583
And remarkable strength.

72
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,833
But of course. Rem's an expert.

73
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:38,500
[REM] Thank you, but I'm still
not as good as you, sister.

74
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,583
[COCYTUS] Interesting.
Could the pink-haired one

75
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:43,291
possess even stronger
abilities in combat?

76
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:44,500
So cold!

[TANYA growls]

78
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:46,958
Everybody's really amazing, huh?

79
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,250
[TANYA]
I get it.

80
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,833
Seems the point of this exercise

81
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:53,166
is to demonstrate our
strength to the other groups.

82
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,500
I've been able to communicate
with the leader of the most

83
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:58,583
intimidating one, but I
can't let my guard down.

84
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:02,000
From the look of things,
We're not the strongest by far.

85
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,458
So it would be foolish
to show them our limits.

86
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:07,416
It would only lead to
them challenging us.

87
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,000
Sir!

88
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:12,250
[TANYA] Good. At least he
won't do anything stupid.

00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,041
I have no particular talent
to perform, so I'll just...

92
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:22,333
...show you something
I'm very proud of!

93

you all had to see that.

[MOMONGA]
Glad we talked,

98
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,791
but I definitely don't want
to get on her bad side.

00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:41,875
Will Miss Darkness
take the stage, please?

100
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:46,083
Uh, well the thing is,
I can't really do it alone.

101
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,916
So, can somebody from
the class give me a hand?

102
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
[GRANTZ]
Me! I'd be happy to help!

103

eager to volunteer?

104

[VISHA]
No idea.

105
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,500
[DARKNESS] Uh... Actually,
my talent is my pain threshold.

106
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,666
Yeah. I can endure
most anything.

107
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,083
So, this man.

108
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:06,291
This strong man, will punish
me with the whip

109
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:08,166
and together we will
demonstrate my resilience

110
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,416
to pain and humiliation.

111

[GRANTZ gasps]

112
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,875
Now, come on, soldier,
show no mercy.

113
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,333
Strike me with that whip,
'cause I know you love to!

Wha-- I've never hit you!

115
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,333
A soldier or scumbag?

116
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,750
[COCYTUS] I find him to be a
disgrace to the warrior ethic.

Dunno what your deal is,

respecting women, okay?

Oh yeah! You should have
your friend join in

00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:53,750
and the two of you
can swap turns!

132
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,791
I can take it, I promise
I've handled much more,

133
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:58,125
and I deserve all the punishment
you can dish out on me!

Just do, "Nature's Beauty".
That's like, your go-to!

Kazuma, we've talked
about this.

147

I'm not some kind of dog that
does tricks on command.

Hm. Well, that's a problem!

Huh? Hey, would it be okay
if I did some magic?

150
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,750
[ROSWAAL] Yes. The point is
to show us something special

151
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:38,583
that you can do,
so it's your call!

152
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:41,333
Oh heck yeah!
This is really special!

153
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:43,541
A spell fit for a
goddess like me!

154
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,666
I call it "Sacred Turn Undead!"

[KAZUMA] Don't zap
our classmates, dummy!

[AQUA yelps]
It's not fair!

157
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,416
Why do I have to be stuck in
here with a demon and the rest

158
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,875
of these wretched creatures?
I am Goddess, ya know?

Ah, very well done, indeed.

160
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:00,541
Seems Aqua's talent is a
husband-and-wife comedy routine!

161
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:01,833
--[AQUA] Hang on!
--[KAZUMA] Wait a second!

162
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,500
[AQUA, KAZUMA]
IseQuar!

163
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:07,333
[ROSWAAL] Class, our time
is running short!

164
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:08,958
I wish we could
fit everybody in,

165
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:11,666
but we can only
squeeze two more!

166
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,291
So who wants to go,
hands up high!

167
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,708
[KAZUMA] Darkness completely
humiliated us.

168
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:20,791
[DARKNESS swoons]

169
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:21,708
[KAZUMA]
Aqua made us look like idiots.

170
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,041
[AQUA]
Huh?

171
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:24,416
[KAZUMA] So please don't
make this worse, Megumin.

172
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,833
[MEGUMIN]
Hmph. Oh, ye of little faith.

173
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:28,083
This is perfect.

174
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:30,458
The path to redemption
is laid out before us!

175
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:33,791
[KAZUMA] The problem is,
you don't have a hidden talent.

176
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:34,541
[MEGUMIN]
I do.

177
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:35,791
[KAZUMA]
Do not.

178
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,083
I do, too!

179
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:38,625
[KAZUMA]
Yeah? Well, what is it?

180
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:41,500
[MEGUMIN] Explosion magic.
The most powerful, most feared,

181
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:43,666
most deadly spell
in all the land!

182
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,000
[MEGUMIN, KAZUMA]
IseQuar!

183
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:49,875
[ROSWAAL] Now, since we don't
do boom-boom in the classroom,

184
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:53,291
I have a target here
for your fiery pleasure.

185
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,583
I'm not so sure about
blowing up a bronze statue,

186
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:59,291
but I guess it
will have to do.

187
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:02,791
Sir, is this a good idea?
Because she really is crazy.

188
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,041
And her explosion spell
is a real powerhouse!

189
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:06,083
[AINS]
Hmm.

190
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:07,416
[KAZUMA]
Uh?

191
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,791
[AINS] My curiosity is
all the more piqued.

192
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,666
[MEGUMIN] Well, I have no
doubt you undead guys

193
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,375
are gonna love this one!

194
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:17,625
Behold the raw power
of Megumin, the crimson demon!

195
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,875
O blackest darkness
shrouded in light.

196
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:22,291
O frenzied blade clad in night.

197
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,541
Reveal the source
of thine origin.

198
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:26,916
I summon the root of
thy fearsome power!

199
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,083
[ALL gasp]

200
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:31,500
[MEGUMIN] Strike my foe...
with Explosion!

201
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:43,541
[MEGUMIN sighs]
I really needed that. Yeah.

202
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,833
That spell was quite impressive.

203
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:48,541
It actually lived up to
all of the hyperbole.

204
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:51,625
A fitting grand finale
if I dare say.

205
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:52,833
[AINS]
Not just yet!

206
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:53,958
Is that so?

207
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:55,958
[AINS]
It was an incredible spell.

208
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:59,208
I'm fortunate to have borne
witness to its brilliance.

209
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,958
However, I would like to take
this opportunity to share my

210
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:04,625
own talent with all
of you gathered here.

211
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:07,125
Oh? What'll you do?

212
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:10,250
[AINS]
Let me think. Hm...

213
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:13,208
[MOMONGA]
Back in my salaryman life,

214
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,875
I had to watch a talent
show thing like this once.

215
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:19,208
It was at a New Year's Eve party
for a really horrible client.

216
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:22,166
A lot of people took turns,
but there was one thing

217
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,916
that people were talking about
for weeks and weeks afterwards.

218
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:33,833
Whoa! That's crazy!
All those magic circles!

219
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:39,041
I feel this will be the
most amazing by far!

220
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,291
[AINS shouts]

221
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,166
[ALL grunt]

222
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,791
[COCYTUS]
Can it be?

223
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,416
[MARE gasps]

224
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,166
[AURA]
It's awesome, Lord Ains!

225
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,791
[COCYTUS] To create a weather
phenomenon, is incredible.

226
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:11,125
[DEMIURGE]
Amazing! Well done, my Lord!

227
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,416
[SHALLTEAR] One of the many
reasons Ains Ooal Gown

228
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,708
reigns supreme!

229
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:18,000
[ALBEDO] Yes, naturally.
As he should.

230
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,250
[DARKNESS]
Oh my!

231
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,000
[MEGUMIN] Um, can somebody
please help me up?

232
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,208
I think my nose is
going to freeze off.

233
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:24,875
[AQUA]
Well, that wasn't bad.

234
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:26,333
I mean, I have
seen better, but...

235
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,583
[KAZUMA] Cocytus looks a
lot like the Winter Shogun.

236
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,666
[AQUA] No! I almost
forgot about that guy!

237
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,666
[TANYA]
Very nice work, Ains.

238
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,458
[NUEMANN]
Grantz! Lieutenant Grantz!

239
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:35,708
[WEISS]
What's with him?

240
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,083
[KOENIG] He's out and
foaming at the mouth.

241
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,208
[VISHA] Bet he's having
flashbacks to winter combat

242
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:40,333
on the training grounds.

243
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:41,541
[TANYA chuckles]

244
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:42,708
--[BEATRICE groans]
--[RAM] I'm freezing.

245
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:44,250
[SUBARU chuckles]

246
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,125
[REM] Subaru, how about a sip
of something to warm you up?

247
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,750
[SUBARU] I think we'd get
in too much trouble.

248
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:48,833
[EMILIA sighs]

249
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,291
[PUCK]
This feels pretty great, Lia!

250
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:51,375
[EMILIA]
Wonderful!

251
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:53,166
[SUBARU chuckles]

252
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,000
[AINS chuckles]
