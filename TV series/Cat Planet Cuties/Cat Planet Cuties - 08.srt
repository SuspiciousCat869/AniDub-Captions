1
00:00:07,833 --> 00:00:09,333
It's "Manami and Aoi!"

2
00:00:09,416 --> 00:00:11,041
Two tough detectives
kicking butt

3
00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:14,083
and taking names
in the urban jungle!

4
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:16,125
Thugs, pimps,
and pushers beware!

5
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:18,541
If you see their bad ass
Gran Torino pulling up,

6
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:21,291
these two hellcats are
coming to knock you down!

7
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:24,125
And with the aid of streetwise,
jive-talking informant,

8
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:26,208
Kio "Huggy Boy" Kakazu,

9
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:28,291
these foxy mamas are
cleaning up the ghetto,

10
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:30,833
one crook at a time!

11
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:33,708
Starring Brittney Karbowski
as Manami Kinjyou...

12
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:36,333
and Monica Rial,
as Aoi Futaba...

13
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:38,291
Featuring Aaron Dismuke
as as Huggy Boy...

14
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:41,125
and Tia Ballard
as Captain Eris.

15
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:14,125
The Saitama Super Arena...

16
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:16,166
A premier event center
that can accommodate

17
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,458
up to thirty- seven
thousand people......

18
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,083
a location currently
packed to the rafters

19
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:25,333
with members
of a top-secret society

20
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:27,958
who've gathered for
an important meeting.

21
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:51,000
So sorry about the typos.

22
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:53,791
It should read, "The Founder
was supposed to be here, too,

23
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:55,666
but some things came up,
and she couldn't make it."...

24
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,208
Well, not in person, anyway.

25
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:00,958
However, she is able to join
us via satellite uplink...

26
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,708
I proudly present to you...

27
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,625
Our Founder.

28
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:09,333
It's been too long,
my brothers and sisters!

29
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:10,750
As you all know...

30
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,791
The Underside of the Kitten's
Paw was blessed recently

31
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:14,208
by the appearance of Miss Eris,

32
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,291
who we worship as
the Divine Embodiment...

33
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:17,708
However...

34
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,791
Eris has just given us
two new commandments

35
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:20,833
that we are to follow...

36
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:24,416
And they will
both be difficult.

37
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,333
First, she has selflessly
asked that we not worship her...

38
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,291
Second, we've viewed
cat's ears and tails

39
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,666
as the pinnacle
of perfection...

40
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,291
But Miss Eris says we are all
perfect in our own way,

41
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:38,500
so we will do
this no more!

42
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:41,750
Brothers and sisters, she has
proclaimed that as of today,

43
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:44,875
we accept ourselves
for who and what we are!

44
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,750
Furthermore...
regarding our faith...

45
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:51,083
she says in order to
follow in her footsteps,

46
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,833
we have no need for
real ears and tails...

47
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:56,333
All we have to do
is act as she does...

48
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:59,083
And that's by being kind
to everybody we meet.

49
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:00,833
Now to tell you more
about the new path

50
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:02,791
we're going to follow...

51
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,500
Miss Eris?

52
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,500
Uh...
Hi, um...

53
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,125
I hope you're all well...

54
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:11,458
My name...
is Eris.

55
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,125
It's like Antonia said:...

56
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:16,083
Be nice to people and be
accepting of yourselves.

57
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,416
Okay, I hope that was
good enough for you.

58
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,958
It was more than good;
it was perfect!

59
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:28,916
By doing that, the Underside
of the Kitten's Paw

60
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,625
will become a secular order...

61
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,500
Instead of a religion
that worships you,

62
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,041
it'll be more
like a fan club.

63
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,833
Are you sure about that?

64
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:37,916
Yeah, 'cause those "meows"
they were chanting sounded

65
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,666
a lot more like
"amens" to me.

66
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,333
This is a quasi-antimatter
round that was supplied to us

67
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:57,208
by the Catians.

68
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:59,583
Unlike standard ammunition
made on Earth, this thing

69
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,250
is designed to eliminate
only non-living matter.

70
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:03,833
Like the hammers Eris

71
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:06,125
and the Assitroids used
to destroy those tanks?

72
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,958
Right. It allows you
to disarm an opponent

73
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,250
without hurting them...

74
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,583
You can shoot at
them without worry.

75
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:13,291
Speaking of shooting...

76
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:14,791
Are you ready?

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,125
Alright...

78
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:23,666
You wanna aim with both
of your eyes open...

79
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,500
If you close one, you
lose depth perception,

80
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:29,125
which affects accuracy.

81
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:30,458
Well that's a relief.

82
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:33,416
They're getting along.

83
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,625
Oh, you're talking about
spiritron force, right?

84
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,750
Yup. That's what
powers the cards

85
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,458
and what gave
Aoi the ability

86
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:43,125
to beat those Dogishuan
Assistroids at the beach.

87
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:45,916
So even one of these Accel
Form cards, as you call them,

88
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,375
can give you
incredible powers, huh?

89
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:51,416
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say these were "magic."

90
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,166
Well, any sufficiently
advanced technology

91
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,208
is indistinguishable
from magic...

92
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,583
Both concepts are
universal principles...

93
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,875
So at their root,
they're the same.

94
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,750
Tea and cookies?
Great.

95
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,916
I thought you were
off training today.

96
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,500
Well, I was...

97
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,625
But I'm letting Aoi
learn a few things.

98
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,291
Hang on...

99
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:22,333
I thought Aoi was supposed to
be the one doing the teaching.

100
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:25,916
Let's just say there's some ways
she could learn to fight, too.

101
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:43,416
I still don't
understand it.

102
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,458
Maybe I shouldn't
be so dogmatic

103
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,875
about the situation
here, Matrey...

104
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,666
The cats and the humans
might have made dog food

105
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,500
out of our soldiers...

106
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,458
But I have to remember
those dogs were thought

107
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:01,125
to be casualties from
the The Androala's sinking.

108
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,500
Instead, they marched forth,

109
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:06,791
determined to carry out
their mission on their own.

110
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:09,833
Plus, we did manage
to retrieve enemy data.

111
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:11,708
Back to the primary
matter at hand...

112
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:13,666
We have to keep the cats
from getting cozy on the laps

113
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,916
of this planet's leaders...

114
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,125
Forcing the Earth monkeys
to shoo the Catians off

115
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:21,208
would also work.

116
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:22,583
We need to show
both of them

117
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:24,250
that continuing their
little relationship

118
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:26,041
is not in their
best interest...

119
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:29,291
Nor does it make
a lick of sense...

120
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,291
Like this.

121
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:34,541
I still don't understand
the doggone thing.

122
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,583
Stop, I give!

123
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:51,166
I hope I didn't
hurt you too much.

124
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:54,041
No... But fighting's not
as easy to pick up as I thought.

125
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,708
Oh, you'll get
the hang of it.

126
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:58,416
The key, of course,
is to practice every day.

127
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,583
How 'bout we take
a quick break?

128
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:08,250
I'm exhausted.

129
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,375
Okay, so tell me,
what made you wanna learn

130
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:11,500
to fight all of a sudden?

131
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:13,000
You girls all know how...

132
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,416
But I'm a guy and
I'm totally worthless...

133
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,458
And with all the weird stuff
that's been happening...

134
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,000
I need to know that
I can help defend you

135
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,708
if thing's ever
get to that point.

136
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,000
So chivalry's not dead.

137
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:23,291
And besides...

138
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,416
All you girls have special
skills and abilities

139
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,708
that I really envy.

140
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:29,958
You envy...? Us?

141
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,875
Well, Eris has
traveled thru space.

142
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,375
Now she's an
ambassador to Earth...

143
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,791
Manami was training
to be a CIA agent,

144
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,666
and now she's a
security guard...

145
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,750
And as for you, Aoi...

146
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:45,833
You worked as a secret agent
for a long time, didn't you?

147
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:48,375
You've all had these
awesome jobs already...

148
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:51,041
You clearly knew what you
wanted to do with your lives...

149
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:52,916
But me?

150
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,958
I don't, and I've got
no special skills.

151
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,875
Well, as strange as
this might sound...

152
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:01,125
There are things
about you that I envy.

153
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,000
Huh?

154
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:05,125
I envy your normal life.

155
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:09,291
Being special is why
my family abandoned me.

156
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,958
Hey...

157
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:13,541
I just noticed,
Manami isn't here.

158
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,083
Guess she must've run off...

159
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:18,125
And she was the one who
suggested we train today...

160
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:27,541
Cool...

161
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,291
Crisp...

162
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:30,833
Refreshing...

163
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:32,833
And made with the
same pure spring water

164
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,208
it has been
for centuries...

165
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:35,541
Hey, Eris.

166
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,916
There's dessert in the
kitchen if you want some.

167
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:41,791
What are
you doing here...

168
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:42,875
Manami?

169
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,416
Oh, you know...
Taking a little break.

170
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,875
Taking a break from what,

171
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:49,291
because you didn't
train with us at all.

172
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:50,541
Yeah...

173
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,208
I left 'cause I didn't
wanna get in the way

174
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,833
of Kio's training, see...?

175
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,625
And you two
looked so focused...

176
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:56,916
Manami...

177
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,625
Besides, I've
trained enough...

178
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:00,416
I don't really need it.

179
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,750
What the hell?!

180
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,541
You left yourself wide open...

181
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,500
If I'd been shooting real
bullets from this gun,

182
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:10,750
you'd be dead right now.

183
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:11,916
No way.

184
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,333
I would have dodged it.

185
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:15,833
Oh, then why
didn't you try?

186
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,583
Duh, 'cause
I didn't need to...

187
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:20,041
I could tell you weren't
aiming directly at me.

188
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,000
Too bad you can't
shoot a revolver

189
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,958
if I grab the
cylinder like this.

190
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:42,208
Apport.

191
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,666
No fair!
I liked that bra!

192
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,416
Nothing's unfair when you're
in an actual gun fight.

193
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,625
My glasses.

194
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:00,833
Alright...

195
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:02,083
Let's finish this.

196
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:04,666
Agreed. But how
about we up the stakes?

197
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,833
I say whoever loses
has to do one thing

198
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,500
the winner
commands them to.

199
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,041
Sounds like a plan.

200
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:11,791
Just a good fair fight.

201
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:14,041
Leave all the personal
crap at the door.

202
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:17,541
Hey, what's
going on in here?

203
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:20,083
Stop looking at
my boob, you perv!

204
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:22,791
It's hard not to with
it hanging out like that!

205
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,958
We'll show 'em there's
more than one way

206
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:39,625
to skin a cat
and their friends.

207
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,500
Cat Planet Cuties.

208
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,583
War game?

209
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:08,541
Yes. It's an exercise that
replicates combat conditions.

210
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,875
It sounds to me like what
you're having is a duel.

211
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:16,166
No, no.
It's just practice.

212
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,583
'Sides, it'll be good to get
some training out in nature.

213
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:02,666
That's the area with
the best vantage point.

214
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,291
I'm sure Aoi's already
lying in wait on that hill

215
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:06,958
for me to pass by...

216
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,500
So I'm gonna have
to outmaneuver her

217
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:10,708
and go in from behind.

218
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:18,166
I'm sure Manami thinks I'm
on that hill, lying in wait.

219
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,625
So she'll try to sneak up
on me from behind...

220
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:24,833
The question is, which way
will she be coming from?

221
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:27,000
The river's to the south,

222
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:29,833
making an attack from
the north most likely.

223
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,958
So that's where I'll aim.

224
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,375
Well, this terrain
certainly takes me back.

225
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,875
It reminds me of all those
survival training sessions

226
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:46,958
I used to have with Dad.

227
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:50,000
I'd say that gives me the
upper hand in this fight.

228
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,083
I've gotta win this game.

229
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,875
I need to show Manami the
importance of training...

230
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:06,666
Because if she keeps blowing
it off like she has been...

231
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,125
It's gonna get her killed.

232
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,375
I can't believe Aoi...

233
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:19,500
She has no idea what
I'm trying to do here.

234
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:20,916
Manami means well,

235
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,666
but she doesn't
understand my situation.

236
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,750
Doesn't she realize
my whole point

237
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:31,458
has been getting her and
Kio alone together...?

238
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:33,583
Man, for an elite,
former assassin,

239
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:37,041
she can be
dense sometimes.

240
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,708
I've worked as a
professional killer...

241
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:43,041
I've carried out countless
black ops missions...

242
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:45,708
That's the reason why
someone as sweet as Kakazu

243
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,833
shouldn't get
involved with me,

244
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:50,541
somebody with
such a dark past.

245
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,708
And anyways...

246
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,166
It's too late for me.

247
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,291
I let my chance
with Kio slip away.

248
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,833
Rain?

249
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:15,500
Should I move now,
while I won't be detected?

250
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:18,666
Or, should I...

251
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,833
Well...

252
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:21,916
I guess I'm stuck then.

253
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,375
I waited too long...

254
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:28,916
Didn't I?

255
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,541
I wonder why I didn't
realize it sooner...?

256
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:42,333
The fact that...

257
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:44,250
I love Kio...

258
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,958
Whoa... It's really
coming down out there.

259
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:57,416
Poor girls'll be shivering
when they get home.

260
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,833
Not for long!

261
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,875
Sadakichi, will you give
me a hand in the kitchen?

262
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:29,083
An Okinawa rail...?!

263
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:32,666
It must be looking for
a new watering hole.

264
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,750
Aw, jeez...! Totally just
gave away my position...

265
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:38,541
But then again, so did Aoi!

266
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:41,375
She dodged it...!
You're fast, Manami!

267
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,791
Damn!

268
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,083
Crap! C'mon...!

269
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:00,250
I'll blast ya
'til your naked!

270
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,250
Guess it's a draw.

271
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,708
Hardly, since
you're out of ammo.

272
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,916
Nice bluff, though.

273
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,750
I'm impressed
you knew that...

274
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:33,541
How'd you
know I was empty?

275
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,875
You dropped your
last full clip.

276
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:38,500
Yeah, thanks to our
endangered friend.

277
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:39,750
Tough break...!

278
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,333
Now seeing
as you've lost this...

279
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:43,625
Time to pay up and
do something I say.

280
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,625
Those were the agreed terms.

281
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:46,958
So get it over with.

282
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,541
Let's see...

283
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:51,583
I know; when we get back, you
have to give Kio a big ol' kiss!

284
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,416
Did... you say "kiss?"

285
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,708
Oh, yeah...

286
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:56,708
A nice,
tender smacker.

287
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:58,125
I can't...!

288
00:17:58,208 --> 00:17:59,833
Please...!
Don't make me!

289
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:02,416
I don't know. Sounds like you're
trying to welch on our deal.

290
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,291
I know...
But that's just-...

291
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,708
Alright, wimp...

292
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:07,333
Something less
embarrassing...?

293
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:08,541
Fine.

294
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:10,250
How 'bout changing the
way you address him?

295
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:11,458
Wait, what?

296
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:13,083
"Kakazu."...

297
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:15,583
Stop calling the poor
guy by his last name.

298
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,916
From here on out...

299
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,916
Call him "Kio,"
like everyone else!

300
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,541
No way!
I couldn't!

301
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,083
Oh, yes, you can...!

302
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,875
And you will, or the
distance between you two

303
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:26,083
will never get smaller.

304
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:28,041
It's that or the kiss.

305
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:29,666
Manami...

306
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,083
Are you sure about this...?

307
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:33,291
What about you?

308
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:34,583
What do you mean?

309
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:35,958
Well, you know...

310
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:37,833
The way you really feel -...

311
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:41,333
Get down!

312
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,875
Shooter's got an
infrared lasersight...

313
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,250
Saw it aimed
at your forehead.

314
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:52,375
It's live ammo.

315
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:53,416
Where are they?

316
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,333
Five o'clock south.

317
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,541
Judging by the report
and its impact...

318
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,250
Three hundred meters away.

319
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,291
Hell of a shot from
that distance...

320
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,291
Especially with
these obstructions.

321
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:12,583
This wasn't some
hunting accident...

322
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:14,583
We're dealing with
a professional.

323
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:16,125
Then we better be careful.

324
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:17,750
You gotta plan?

325
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,375
It'll take both of us.

326
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,375
Let me guess: One's the bait
and the other's the shooter?

327
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:22,791
Not quite...

328
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,833
You're going to be both
the bait and the shooter.

329
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:26,000
Huh?

330
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:40,958
Now I gotcha.

331
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,791
We're home.

332
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:15,833
Welcome back...

333
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:17,875
I've got a surprise
for you two.

334
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:19,625
Yep, dinner is served...!

335
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,541
Hope you brought
your appetites.

336
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:24,083
This looks incredible!

337
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:25,541
You made this all
by yourself?

338
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:26,791
Not quite...

339
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:27,875
None of this
would've been possible

340
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:30,333
without the help
of these guys.

341
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:35,208
Right, but it was Kio's
idea to make you a hot meal.

342
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:36,916
He thought you could use one
after getting drenched

343
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,416
and cold from the rain.

344
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,750
Wow, Kio, that's really
considerate for you.

345
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,333
Yes, Kakazu...

346
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,875
Thank you.

347
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:48,000
Sorry, what was that?

348
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:49,125
I meant...

349
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:50,291
Uh...

350
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,791
Thanks a lot...

351
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:52,833
Kio.

352
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:54,000
Again.

353
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:56,750
Thank you so much
for the meal, Kakazu!

354
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,916
I mean, thanks, Kio!

355
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,666
Forget it, it was
no big deal...

356
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,291
Did you guys
get cold today?

357
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:03,541
What?!

358
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,208
Not really...
'cause...

359
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:07,958
the action got hotter than
expected out there, Kio.

360
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:10,875
Moron!

361
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:13,916
You didn't even notice that Aoi
called you by your first name!

362
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,333
Well... let's eat up
before this gets cold.

363
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,375
Thank you again, Kio.

364
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:22,000
It's delicious!

365
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,083
I can't believe
you, Kio...!

366
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:27,875
I'm gonna make you pay
for this, you ignoramus!

367
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:29,125
Huh...?!

368
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:31,291
Wait...! What are you
so angry about now?

369
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:32,833
Is the food bad?

370
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,583
Sorry. But it's still
no reason to get violent.

371
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:37,666
That's not it at all!

372
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,333
Manami...!
Stop, it's okay.

373
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:42,083
Not 'til genius
here wises up!

374
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:44,125
I'll wise up...!
I swear...!

375
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:46,541
Even though I don't
know what about!

376
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:51,916
I'm gonna strangle the
cluelessness outta ya!

377
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:37,208
Assistroids are all just
cutesy little robots, right?

378
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:38,583
Wrong!

379
00:23:38,666 --> 00:23:40,625
You won't believe what
the original one looks like,

380
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:43,083
but you're gonna find out
because it's coming to Earth!

381
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:45,666
Next time:
"The Grand First Assistroid?"

382
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:48,500
I'm coming
to drop in on you!
