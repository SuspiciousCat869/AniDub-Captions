1
00:00:07,916 --> 00:00:10,458
Space: the final frontier.

2
00:00:10,541 --> 00:00:13,291
These are the voyages
of the starship Catia.

3
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:17,250
Its continuing mission: to
explore strange, new worlds.

4
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:20,208
To seek out new life
and new civilizations.

5
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:23,291
To boldly go where no sexy
alien cat woman from a

6
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:26,666
planet full of sexy alien cat
women has gone before.

7
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:00,291
The Saitama Super Arena.

8
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:02,291
A premier event center
that can accommodate up

9
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:04,833
to thirty-seven
thousand people.

10
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:09,250
A location currently
packed to the rafters

11
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:11,791
with members
of a top-secret society.

12
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:14,291
Who've gathered for
an important meeting.

13
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,833
Mee-ow!

14
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:20,916
Meow!!

15
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,416
My brethren!

16
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,625
We've all gathered together
because we're fans of cats!

17
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:25,916
Amen!!

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,375
Amen!

19
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:29,583
Whether it's their pointy
ears, furry tails, whiskers,

20
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:31,208
button noses,
their sweet purrs,

21
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:32,916
or the way they
rub up against us,

22
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,416
we're huge fans
of all things kitty cat!

23
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,000
We treasure them!

24
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:39,333
No! It's
more than that!

25
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:44,250
Only one word can describe
how we feel for them: L.O.V.E!

26
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:47,166
We want to be just like them,
right, brothers and sisters?

27
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,500
Yeah!!

28
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:53,000
But...

29
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,208
Unfortunately,
we're all phonies!

30
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:58,208
We can only dress like
cats, but we're not them!

31
00:02:58,291 --> 00:02:59,500
Why is that?

32
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:01,083
I'll tell you why;

33
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:04,708
it's because we descended from
the lowly ape not the holy cat!

34
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:06,375
That's the curse of our race.

35
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:07,583
Awwww!!

36
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:08,625
Wait!

37
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:10,083
There is hope,
and the other day,

38
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:12,333
the Good News
was made manifest!

39
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:15,500
Behold!

40
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:18,333
Genuine kitty ears!

41
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:21,250
A real tail!

42
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:22,583
Hallelujah!

43
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,333
My friends, we
may not have been created

44
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:25,708
in a cat's own image.

45
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:28,208
But this beautiful,
and supreme being was!

46
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,666
The answer to our prayers
and what we've been seeking!

47
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,000
A real-live cat girl who
deserves our total devotion

48
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:36,750
and unceasing praise!

49
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:40,083
I proclaim to each and every one
of you. The kitty-eared members

50
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,541
of the Underside of
the Kitten's Paw

51
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:45,708
that this Divine Embodiment
is our one true cat god!

52
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,541
So then begin.

53
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:51,125
"Operation Cat's
Meow" immediately!

54
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,708
Mee-ow!

55
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:54,500
Meow!!

56
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,458
Mee-ow!

57
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:59,000
Meow!!

58
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,291
You can't let
your past prevent you

59
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:13,833
from going after
your future.

60
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:17,333
Just have a little more
faith in yourself, 'kay?

61
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:20,166
That's a lot easier
said than done, Manami.

62
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:22,916
Uh. Coming!

63
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:25,833
Huh?

64
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,291
Movers, huh?

65
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:34,250
Good morning, all.

66
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:36,166
Oh, yeah!

67
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,958
Fry-fry, fry-fry-fry!
Fry-fry, fry-fry-fry!

68
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:41,583
Whee!

69
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:45,625
Fry-fry, fry-fry-fry!
Fry-fry, fry-fry-ooo!

70
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:46,625
Fry-fry...

71
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:47,625
Eris?

72
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,458
Oh, hi there,
Kio, good morning!

73
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,958
Isn't today the most
wonderful day or what?

74
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,583
What are you
so jazzed about?

75
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:55,125
Oh, didn't
I tell you?

76
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,250
I'm about to fry up some
breakfast potstickers!

77
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:58,833
I'm so
incredibly happy!

78
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:00,083
I can't stop
singing and dancing

79
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,625
and I don't know
what's come over me!

80
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,333
Fry-fry, fry-fry-fry!
Fry-fry, fry-fry-fry!

81
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:05,416
This is my fault.

82
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,000
I was cleaning out the pantry
when I came across this stuff.

83
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:11,416
I was about to throw it
away since your cat ran off.

84
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,333
But then I thought Eris
might like to try it.

85
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:16,458
Cat nip?
You gave her some?

86
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:19,416
No, all I did was let her
take a little whiff of it!

87
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,875
When my cat used
to have this stuff,

88
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,708
she never acted like that.

89
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:23,666
Hey!!

90
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,750
Don't hog
all the happy magic

91
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:26,041
good time powder
for yourself!

92
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,375
Eris, stop! You've
had too much as it is!

93
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:29,500
No more!

94
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,333
I know when I've had
enough, so gimme!

95
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:32,916
Eris, get a
hold of yourself;

96
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,041
you're acting like someone on
one of those rehab shows on TV!

97
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:38,666
Hey, quit acting like a basket
case and knock it off, Eris!

98
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,625
Kio isn't gonna
give you any, 'kay?

99
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,250
Alright, well then why
don't you give me some,

100
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,416
and I'll give you
a cat bath instead?

101
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,125
What?

102
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:48,416
Yoink!

103
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,041
Now how 'bout that tongue
bath I promised you?

104
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,791
No, stop!

105
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:03,083
My, my, what a scene.

106
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:04,458
Doctor Durel!

107
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:06,166
So what was that you
injected her with?

108
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,583
It wasn't a shot.

109
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,250
It was a taser charge.

110
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,416
It sent an electric pulse
directly to her nerves,

111
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,041
and calmed her down.

112
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:17,125
Um. Sorry, I don't
know what came over me.

113
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:18,500
I do.

114
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:20,958
Your first mating season
is right around the corner.

115
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:22,500
Mating season?

116
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,333
It's a common occurrence
amongst our race.

117
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:26,250
Once one reaches
their sixteenth cycle.

118
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:27,916
They begin
to go into heat

119
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,250
and start to have regular
seasons of fertility.

120
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:31,583
And...

121
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:32,958
As their mating
season approaches,

122
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:35,000
even the most minute
traces of a stimulant

123
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:36,333
can affect their
brain chemistry,

124
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:37,833
and cause them
to go wild.

125
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:39,291
Does that
explain things?

126
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,916
Wow, so a little whiff of
catnip caused all that?

127
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,833
You're really quite
fortunate, Eris.

128
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:45,875
We rarely have partners
for our first mating seasons,

129
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,458
but you already do here.

130
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,958
Otherwise, you'd have to make
do with the virtual simulator

131
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:51,833
Doctor, you're
embarrassing me!

132
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:54,541
Wait, what partner?

133
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:55,208
You didn't know?

134
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,541
Why, Kio, of course.

135
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:57,791
Are you crazy?

136
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,708
On this planet,
it's illegal to have sex

137
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:03,166
with somebody
underage like him!

138
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,500
Ah, But you forget

139
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,750
This house is the
provisional Catian Embassy,

140
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:09,666
so Earth law
doesn't apply inside it.

141
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,708
So there's no problem.

142
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,458
There's a gigantic one!

143
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:13,958
But it's my understanding

144
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:16,458
that Kio isn't romantically
involved with anyone at all.

145
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:18,083
So what's the problem?

146
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:19,583
Um, well, it's, uh...

147
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:23,125
Help me out here and tell 'em
why this is so wrong, Kio.

148
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,041
Y'know, I'd love to,
but I almost forgot

149
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:27,333
that I've gotta go clean my
room, and like right now, too!

150
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:28,666
Hey!

151
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,791
Don't run away, you
spineless, little coward!

152
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:33,166
We're talking
about you here!

153
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,916
Are you positive you
want to be with him?

154
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,125
Yes!

155
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,625
Without a doubt, Kio
is the bravest person

156
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:42,333
that I've ever
known, doctor.

157
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:44,375
He wasn't all that
brave just then.

158
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,458
Did you come here just
to help my condition?

159
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:49,000
Or was there another
reason you came?

160
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,166
I have a request
from the captain.

161
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,166
She wants you
to go to Tokyo.

162
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,958
Tokyo, huh?

163
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:58,666
"First, begin by licking the
master key memory terminal,

164
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,166
and then press the
transmit button.".

165
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,875
'Kay.

166
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,791
"When you hear the chime,
you have now been recognized

167
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,791
as the default commander.

168
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:12,541
Next is the startup test.

169
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,166
Please give an order
that is possible

170
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,125
for the Assistroids
to perform."

171
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:18,041
Um... Stand up.

172
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:23,416
Alright then Your name
will be Nakamura

173
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,208
and yours Chiba.

174
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:26,833
Got it?

175
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:29,791
Now then, please do a small
jump and hop to the side.

176
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:32,583
Twirl three times
and do a beckoning cat.

177
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:44,666
"Now, please give them an order
that is impossible to follow."

178
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,791
Okay then,
let's see here.

179
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:50,875
Hmm. You guys do a
quick-draw, okay?

180
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:53,125
Just like Joe the
Ace in that movie.

181
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,166
Take this.

182
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,291
"If your units are
functioning properly.

183
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:25,041
When given an
impossible command,

184
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,125
they will quickly
terminate each other."

185
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,500
"Issue a command within
ten seconds to abort this."

186
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,166
What? Stop!

187
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,750
Abort!

188
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:39,500
Wow, your first day with me
was almost your last, huh?

189
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,916
I'll be more careful
from now on, okay?

190
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,916
The cats are
going to Tokyo?

191
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,333
Yes ma'am.

192
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:48,375
We aren't certain if it's
a diplomatic mission yet.

193
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,916
But their existence could
become even more widely known

194
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,291
because of this excursion.

195
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:56,958
This is pretty aggressive,
even for them.

196
00:09:57,041 --> 00:10:00,583
Oh, well, guess
I'm off to Tokyo, too.

197
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,708
Wow!

198
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:11,875
Hey, Kio!

199
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:13,458
Huh?

200
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:15,583
Did you know this is my first
time travelling in an aircraft

201
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,416
that flies by
aerodynamic lift?

202
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,291
I'm incredibly
excited about this!

203
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:20,333
I can't wait!

204
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:23,000
Uh-huh.
I can tell.

205
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,333
As if her outfit
wasn't bad enough

206
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:29,166
Now she's gotta make a lot of
noise to attract attention, too?

207
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:32,833
Just calm down Manami no
one's noticed her so far.

208
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,333
I just hope it
stays that way.

209
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:35,916
Um, excuse me?
Folks?

210
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,166
--Yeah?
--Yes?

211
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,083
I need to ask about your
travelling companion.

212
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:41,166
Your little pet robot
friend or whatever.

213
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,625
That thing

214
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,375
Oh! No, please
don't worry.

215
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:48,500
That unit is friendly
and won't harm anyone.

216
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,166
Nor interfere with
the plane's electronics.

217
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,583
Oh, no.

218
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,583
What I meant was the plane
is about to take off.

219
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:56,500
Before we can leave,
it needs to be stowed.

220
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:57,708
Oh, sure thing!

221
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,916
Hey, come over here!

222
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:08,083
Can you please put him in
the overhead bin, ma'am?

223
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,916
Oh, yes

224
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,541
I'm sure everyone's
noticed her now.

225
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,833
Wait, don't
put him in there.

226
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:19,583
We've got some empty
seats available.

227
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:22,000
Put that adorable little
guy in one instead.

228
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:22,708
Right.

229
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,875
Thank you so much!

230
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:27,166
Now what do you say
to these nice ladies?

231
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:32,166
How sweet!

232
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,166
Cat Planet Cuties.

233
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,708
Aoi checked them
with her luggage?

234
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,250
So, are we headed to
some place important?

235
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:12,416
Yes, very much so.

236
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:15,833
Wait a minute.

237
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,041
Here?

238
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:19,000
Wow, the epicenter
of geek commerce, huh?

239
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,666
You were ordered
to come here?

240
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,000
Yes. The arts
research team requested

241
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,958
that I observe this
renowned marketplace,

242
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:27,250
and acquire certain
items for study.

243
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:29,750
This will allow them to better
understand your world's culture.

244
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,541
What are your
specific orders?

245
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,750
To purchase toys and several
volumes of the literature

246
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,250
known as "manga."

247
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:36,958
--What?
--Huh?

248
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,041
Well, you see,

249
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,125
the position of Catian
cultural anthropology is this:

250
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,041
the level of a world's
culture is defined by

251
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,125
what its inhabitants
dismiss as "lowbrow,"

252
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:48,250
even moreso than what they
consider to be highbrow.

253
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,750
Say, Kio.

254
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,791
We Catians are the
first race of cat people

255
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,916
that Earth has ever
encountered, right?

256
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,333
Yep, you guys are
the only ones so far.

257
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:01,833
Well, then how do
you explain this?

258
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:03,666
Um, gee, where to start?

259
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,125
Hey, why don't we talk
about this later, 'kay?

260
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:08,666
We've got shopping
to do, remember?

261
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,458
Aoi?

262
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,291
Excuse me, sir, but do you
have the items on this list?

263
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:21,208
Let's see.

264
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:23,125
One moment,.

265
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:24,333
I can't believe

266
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:26,416
he wasn't weirded-out
by Eris' appearance

267
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,833
Oh. Excuse me, Miss?

268
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:30,791
Does this thing
belong to you?

269
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:31,958
Sure does.

270
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:33,916
Well, if you don't mind,
I need to move it.

271
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,791
Thanks.

272
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:38,875
He didn't find the Assistroid
to be strange, either.

273
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:41,625
As a species, you humans have
a much higher adaptability

274
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:45,416
to different cultures
than I thought.

275
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,416
I guess you're right.

276
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,625
Wait, where's Kio?

277
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:51,875
Hey!

278
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,791
What the heck are
you doing over here?

279
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,666
I thought you supposed to be
Eris' bodyguard on this trip!

280
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,750
Yeah, I am,
but here, look!

281
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:02,083
I've never seen a real
BC-FX game system before!

282
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:03,416
Yeah?

283
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,666
Well, it's gonna be
the last thing you ever see

284
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,208
if you don't get over
there and do your job!

285
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,416
Aoi?

286
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,541
Aoi?

287
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:17,583
Um, yes, Manami?

288
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:19,833
It's just that Kio--

289
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:21,625
I meant, uh...

290
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,916
Kio and I are gonna
keep watching over Eris;

291
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,083
catch up with us
when you're done.

292
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:26,166
Yeah, sure!

293
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,500
I'll be there
in two minutes!

294
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,208
Okay!

295
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,166
You two want that one?

296
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,750
Man, how can one person be
so crazy about something?

297
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:43,791
Holy crap, a Chiappa
Rhino 357 Magnum!

298
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:46,250
It says it's a
replica, but still!

299
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,750
That's a first-rate piece,

300
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:50,125
and probably the best-looking
one I've ever seen!

301
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:51,541
Oh, what I wouldn't
give to hold

302
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:54,083
that sexy piece in my
hot little hands!

303
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,500
Will it be cash
or credit then, miss?

304
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,166
Where is everyone?

305
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,375
No, it couldn't be!

306
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:09,625
A Nikkatsu Colt that was
actually used in a movie?

307
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:13,250
Want a closer look?

308
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,625
These props are
hard to come by.

309
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:16,833
Oh, are they now?

310
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,791
They sell out quick.

311
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:25,916
Thanks. We'll ship them
out promptly, ma'am.

312
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
What a great place!
And you know.

313
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:30,041
The items here were
very affordable!

314
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:33,041
Wouldn't you guys
agree with me?

315
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:35,041
I blew my
whole allowance

316
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:37,375
It sounds to me like you're
having buyer's remorse.

317
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,041
Stop sounding so
mopey, would ya?

318
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,333
You're one to talk.

319
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:43,875
So how much did you
spend back there, Manami?

320
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:46,833
I take it that translates
to "everything I had."

321
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:52,375
Uh-oh, guys Are you
having regrets, too, Aoi?

322
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:53,291
I think this is a trap.

323
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:54,541
Huh?

324
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,500
It's a Saturday afternoon

325
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:59,666
This train station should
be bustling, but it's empty.

326
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,625
If you're right, just who
or what are we dealing with?

327
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:07,416
They're using Taoist
wizardry or a western style.

328
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,708
I can't exactly say yet But
there's a magician at work,

329
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,041
and they've cast a
spell to keep everyone

330
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,625
but us away from here.

331
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:14,916
What do we do?

332
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,958
You get on the train
with Kakazu and Eris.

333
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:21,666
I'll catch up once I've taken
care of who's responsible.

334
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,250
Chiba, Nakamura.

335
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,291
Look after them.

336
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:35,958
Ohh, a barrier created
with spiritrons?

337
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:37,958
It's keeping folks
out of that station.

338
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,333
Setting that up in the middle
of Tokyo is impressive.

339
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,333
And the Japanese government
isn't responsible?

340
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:43,375
No, ma'am.

341
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:44,625
I've been scanning

342
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,666
all the government
comm channels for days

343
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,958
and there's
been no chatter

344
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:51,250
or activity regarding
the Catians at all.

345
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:52,875
If not them,

346
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,583
then who?

347
00:16:57,291 --> 00:17:00,208
Four-eyes has
taken the bait.

348
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:02,875
Short-hair, the three
runts, the tagalong,

349
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:06,375
and the target are currently
in transit aboard the train.

350
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,291
Phase two complete.

351
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,291
We're initiating
Phase three, everyone.

352
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,291
Team A, you'll carefully
obtain both the target

353
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:14,000
and the tagalong.

354
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,916
Team B and I will eliminate
Charmed Momiji

355
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,583
Permanently

356
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:19,625
Roger.

357
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:30,500
They were glamours!

358
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:31,958
Attention all passengers:

359
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:33,208
there will be a
thirty-minute delay

360
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,500
on the inbound central
line due to an accident.

361
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,000
We apologize for any...

362
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:39,958
Wait, that's the train Kakazu
and the others are on!

363
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,125
Hey, is something wrong?

364
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:45,083
There aren't any
ads on this train?

365
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,416
What?

366
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,125
Yeah, you're right.

367
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,500
What is this stuff, gas?

368
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:54,791
I'm feeling really
light-headed.

369
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,333
Eris!

370
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:06,791
Manami,
are you okay?

371
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:08,750
Hey, let go!

372
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,541
Kio! Eris!

373
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,458
Guys, go after them!

374
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:19,125
Oh, crap!

375
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:20,750
What is this junk?

376
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,500
It's like I'm in a roach
motel or something!

377
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,166
Oh, no!

378
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,375
Aw! Damn!

379
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:33,125
They're in the car
ahead, go get 'em!

380
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:34,416
On it!

381
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:40,583
Apport!

382
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,416
Uh-uh!

383
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,708
What have you done
with my friends?

384
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:01,208
We don't take
any fare jumpers!

385
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:12,500
Ow.

386
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,791
I'll find you, Kakazu

387
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:20,541
Oh, I love having
embassy duty!

388
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:23,541
I'd give anything
to trade places with Eris!

389
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:31,458
Catian Embassy,
Chayka speaking.

390
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:34,000
Wait, what do you mean
Eris has been kidnapped?

391
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,125
Unfortunately we can't
officially send

392
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,666
in Catian forces.

393
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,041
We still haven't formalized
our treaty with your planet yet.

394
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,125
Yeah, I thought that
might be the case.

395
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:45,625
Even though you guys
can't do anything now,

396
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,541
me and Manami can, right?

397
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:48,791
Yeah, you're Earthlings,

398
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:51,916
and I can unofficially
provide you with tech.

399
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,500
Can you send an
Assistroid programmed

400
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:54,500
for electronic warfare?

401
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,000
Gimme the phone!

402
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,750
Can you also send
my unit along, too?

403
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,375
Sure thing!

404
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:04,583
Manami, that's your
personal Assistroid?

405
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:07,041
Uh-huh.
I call him Yun-Fat.

406
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:16,750
What the heck is that?

407
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:20,125
It's one of the Immigration
Bureau's secret depots.

408
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:21,583
Things might get
a little rough,

409
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:24,625
so let's help ourselves
to the goodies inside.

410
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:46,416
Brethren!

411
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,166
Behold the sacred catnap
of the Divine Embodiment!

412
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:52,291
this is the holy vessel
sent from Heaven above!

413
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:55,083
The guiding light adorned
with real kitty ears and a tail!

414
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,416
She is the chosen one who
will lead the Underside

415
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,166
of the Kitten's Paw
into a new world!

416
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,166
A world that we will
build with our paws!

417
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,166
Mee-ow!

418
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:08,000
Mee-ow! Mee-ow!

419
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,458
The Underside of
the Kitten's Paw?

420
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:12,916
It's officially considered
a religious organization,

421
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,250
but it's more
of a cult, really.

422
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:16,666
It's grown rapidly and it
sounds like they're the ones

423
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,333
who nabbed your friends.

424
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:22,583
Its founder is Antonia
Lirimonie Norfederas

425
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:26,041
Papanorgas Arecroteles
Cnorses Morfenoss.

426
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,166
Turns out she's
the granddaughter

427
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,875
of a multimillionaire.

428
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,958
Michael J.C.D.A.E.
Morfenoss, a guy so rich

429
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,125
that he's called
"The Second Onassis".

430
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,083
Her cat cult's main base
is a luxury liner

431
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:38,000
called The Androala.

432
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,875
It has a displacement of two
hundred and fifty thousand tons.

433
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:43,750
That's even larger
than some oil tankers.

434
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,166
So that must be where Eris
and Kakazu are being held.

435
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,833
Are you kidding?

436
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,166
The time is at hand.

437
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:58,166
At last, the dawn of
our age has arrived!

438
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,416
Mee-ow!

439
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:36,541
There's sexy swimsuits
on a luxury liner

440
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:39,083
and helicopters and missiles
flying thru the sky!

441
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:41,208
Can the gawky love interest
compete with a girl

442
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:42,875
who out-beautifies
even flowers?

443
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:45,791
Next time:
"We've Come to Rescue You."

444
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:48,416
I'm coming to drop
in on you!
