1
00:00:07,833 --> 00:00:09,250
The time is the future.

2
00:00:09,333 --> 00:00:10,833
The place is outer space.

3
00:00:10,916 --> 00:00:14,041
In the endless cosmic depths,
where even light becomes warped,

4
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:17,041
a young woman pilots
her beloved ship, Luros.

5
00:00:17,125 --> 00:00:19,458
Straddling the stars
as a diplomat,

6
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:21,750
and a girl in love,
she is Eris of Catia.

7
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:23,458
However,
most know her as...

8
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:25,916
"Captain Eris."

9
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,875
She was a traveler
journeying through space,

10
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:19,000
from a land far away,
and a time long ago...

11
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:20,916
So, we should keep
Sirius to port

12
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,083
and dock from the direction
of Gemini, is that correct?

13
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:24,083
Correct.

14
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:26,708
Roger that...
See you soon.

15
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:27,791
Well, you heard her...!

16
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:29,666
Alter course mark
one, two, five...

17
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,791
We're gonna make a
little detour here...

18
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:33,666
All engines at full speed...!

19
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,458
Ready hyperdrives...
Warp nine!

20
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:37,833
Altering course
mark one, two, five.

21
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:39,291
Systems ready.
Warp nine.

22
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:40,750
Engage!

23
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:46,750
We've entered
hyperspace...

24
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,750
All hands, stand down
from entry alert...

25
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:50,833
Return to your
normal duties!

26
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,041
Um... Captain?

27
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:09,333
Oh, hi, Laurie...

28
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:10,458
What's going on?

29
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:12,375
Oh, nothing new...

30
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,708
What's the name of that
tune that was just playing?

31
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:15,750
Not sure.

32
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:16,875
It's a song from Earth.

33
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:18,500
Earth?

34
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,416
Apparently, the earth survey
team accidentally picked it up

35
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,458
during some recent
reconnaissance.

36
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,333
I'm interested...

37
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:26,416
If you wouldn't mind,
could you tell me more?

38
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,208
Yeah, why not...?

39
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,541
Come with me...
I'll play it for you.

40
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:33,875
Thank you.

41
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,791
Turning now
to the weather...

42
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,625
A large
tropical depression

43
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:40,083
forming over the Marshall
Islands is moving north

44
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,333
around a high pressure
system in the Pacific...

45
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:43,666
Great song, huh?

46
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,125
Sure is...

47
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,125
It was on one of the CDs
Ichika was kind enough

48
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:48,541
to let us borrow...

49
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:49,291
It's really great.

50
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:50,625
Hey.

51
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:51,708
Wanna listen to it again?

52
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,250
Okay!

53
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,250
I really love it.

54
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,375
Yeah.

55
00:03:58,458 --> 00:03:59,625
Almost forgot...

56
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:01,750
Didn't you wanna talk
to me about something?

57
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,083
Oh... Yeah,
that's right!

58
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,875
The first ever Assistroid
is coming here?

59
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:13,166
Yep... The first model
created by Catia

60
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,125
is going to pay
Earth a visit.

61
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:18,250
So when did Catians first
begin to use Assistroids?

62
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:21,208
Oh, it was nearly a
thousand cycles ago, now.

63
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,500
Is that like
a thousand years?

64
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,500
Hey, that's sorta like your
grandmother dropping by

65
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:26,916
for a visit, huh?

66
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:30,791
Why is it coming to Earth?

67
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:32,625
Well, it's a bit unusual...

68
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,791
This Assistroid was
designed and built to work

69
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,208
on the first Catian
survey ship...

70
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:39,875
But... Unfortunately,
our first survey ship

71
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:42,416
was also our
first ship wreck.

72
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,833
What happened to the crew?

73
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,500
They died...

74
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:47,541
More than eight hundred cycles
passed before the survey ship

75
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:48,833
was finally recovered.

76
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:50,333
Oh.

77
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,625
And now, the surviving
Assistroid wants to visit Earth,

78
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,375
so we feel
it's only right.

79
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,833
So the Assistroid wants to see
the outcome of the mission

80
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:58,416
it was unable
to carry out?

81
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,666
I see... With everything
it's been through,

82
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,541
should we give it
the royal treatment?

83
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,125
Actually, no...

84
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:06,291
I've been ordered not
to do anything at all.

85
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,791
Huh...? We don't have
to give tours of Earth

86
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,166
or hold some
kind of ceremony?

87
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,416
No...

88
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,083
In fact, I was told
all we need to do

89
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:15,416
is prepare a room
for it at the embassy.

90
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,208
So all we can really do is just
be there to talk to it, right?

91
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:20,625
I guess.

92
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:22,250
But having someone like you
there who knows a lot

93
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:23,833
about Earth will help...

94
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:25,958
You can provide
hospitality...

95
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,416
More than I can...

96
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,916
So...

97
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,875
Sure...
You got it...

98
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:40,291
I'm glad to help out.

99
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,041
Thank you, Kio!

100
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:49,708
Pardon?

101
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:51,958
A request to visit home?

102
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:54,625
I suppose that's fine.

103
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,541
My Lady.
You can't...!

104
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,500
Don't let the kitty
go away, please!

105
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,208
Stop being dramatic...

106
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:03,041
It's only for three
days, not forever...

107
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:04,291
Not for three hours,

108
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:05,958
not for three minutes,
not for three seconds.

109
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,541
I'll die without kitty!

110
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:08,750
Need I remind you,

111
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,833
this Assistroid was
a gift from Miss Eris.

112
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:13,333
It doesn't belong to you!

113
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:14,833
Hey, listen.

114
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,000
It's no problem for you
to ask for time off, y'know,

115
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:18,916
but is everything okay?

116
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:23,041
Grandmother?

117
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,208
Ancestor?

118
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,750
Hey, Eris,
what's wrong?

119
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:38,916
You look like you're upset.

120
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,750
Me...? Oh, no...

121
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,041
I was just sitting here
listening to some music.

122
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,625
You've really taken a
liking to that, huh?

123
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,375
What are you listening to?

124
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:49,458
It's a song from one of those
CDs Ichika let me borrow.

125
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:50,875
I know it.

126
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:53,083
It's a song from an old cartoon
called 'Captain Future.'

127
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:55,000
Jeez, Kio.
How old are you?

128
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,500
Aren't you ready for something
a bit more sophisticated?

129
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,041
I won't have you making
fun of 'Captain Future!'

130
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:01,416
Ichika?

131
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,333
'Captain Future' is a sci-fi,
space opera classic,

132
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,791
created by Edmund Hamilton,
celebrated the world over,

133
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:09,250
and I will not tolerate
you mocking it!

134
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:11,958
Listen up,
everyone...!

135
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,375
In the world
of 'Captain Future,'

136
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:16,166
there are Mercurians,
Venusians, Martians, Jovians,

137
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,791
Saturnians, Uranians
and much, much more...

138
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,791
Hello...! I'm being nice
enough to explain all this,

139
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:21,833
so pay attention!

140
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:23,250
No thanks.
I'm good.

141
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:27,208
Sounds like a whole lotta
sci-fi gibberish to me.

142
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:28,375
These kids today.

143
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,208
No concept of
greatness anymore.

144
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:31,333
I'm with you, Ichika.

145
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:33,041
Captain Future was awesome.

146
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,833
If it's that good, Kio,

147
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:37,083
I guess I'll have
to check it out.

148
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,250
What a nice song!

149
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,458
I told you.

150
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,000
Yes, I think so, too.

151
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,958
I like it so much,
I think I'll transfer it

152
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,833
to my private system.

153
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:56,000
It looks like you can purchase
it on Earth's network.

154
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,708
I do think it's strange...

155
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,208
The Earthlings haven't
really ventured out

156
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:00,916
into deep space
yet, have they?

157
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,958
No, but... their
ability to express

158
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:05,375
the feelings of space
travelers is remarkable...

159
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:06,791
Don't you think?

160
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,375
Even though we're
so different...

161
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:09,791
It would appear that,
at our core,

162
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:12,291
we're very similar.

163
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:13,916
We're picking up a ship
warping into the edge

164
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,958
of the star system...

165
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:17,000
It looks like one
of our ferries.

166
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,666
It would seem our
guest has arrived...

167
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,958
Open hailing frequencies...

168
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,208
Let's say hello, everyone.

169
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,958
I think we're more than prepared
for our reception, don't you?

170
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:33,500
Uh-huh. Now all we have
to do is wait for our guest.

171
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:34,750
By the way...

172
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,250
Are all Assistroids
built the same,

173
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,625
or are there different kinds?

174
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,416
Oh... The original model

175
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,291
was much bigger than
the newer ones...

176
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,708
And their appearance is
very different, too...

177
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:46,208
It was fairly recently
that the design changed...

178
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,875
The newer models are
a different breed.

179
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:03,708
Pleased to meet you...

180
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:05,208
Miss Eris,
Mr. io.

181
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:06,708
Hi...

182
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:08,625
My name is Laurie.

183
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:22,125
Well, of course a tin man
like you doesn't understand...

184
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,291
What in the world
are you watching now?

185
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,666
Oh please, you reject
of a rubber man...!

186
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,333
Listen! If you have
time to watch cartoons,

187
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:31,458
you have time to reexamine
our strategy, don't you?

188
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,625
So that's the
ancestor of Yun-Fat

189
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:38,916
and the other Assistroids?

190
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,291
I guess so, they're
calling her 'grandmother.'

191
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,958
More of an Android than an
Assistroid, don't you think?

192
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,375
Why thank you...

193
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:52,166
When we Assistroids were in
our early development phase...

194
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,000
there was a belief
held by many

195
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,916
that in order for us
to assist people,

196
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,375
we would need
to be people-sized.

197
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:58,708
Back then...

198
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:01,500
We did not yet have mass
adjustment systems...

199
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,708
So, in order to make us
the same size as people,

200
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:06,333
biological parts
were implemented.

201
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:07,625
'Kay.

202
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:08,708
But tech improved...

203
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,208
Centralized control systems

204
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,625
and language reasoning
systems got better.

205
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:16,416
Irradiative dissociation
control theory was perfected.

206
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,458
The Assistroids
were miniaturized...

207
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:21,166
That's why they're so little
and I'm so much bigger.

208
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,750
Right...

209
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,041
Actually, no, I'm lost.

210
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,958
Why did they change
to the current design?

211
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,750
If we look too
much like people,

212
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:30,208
others might become
convinced that we are.

213
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:32,833
As it turns out, that can
have disastrous consequences

214
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,458
for us...
and for people, too.

215
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,041
Huh?

216
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,750
Something that looks
like a person...

217
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,291
And can do the
exact same things...

218
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:42,500
can sometimes elicit
a lot of fear or hate...

219
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:45,541
Even if all we're doing
is having a conversation.

220
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,125
Take these.

221
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,291
If these snacks were able
to communicate with you...

222
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:54,875
Would you be
able to eat them?

223
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:56,791
The ability to
communicate so effortlessly

224
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,000
can create the illusion

225
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,000
that we are no
different from people...

226
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,875
But, in reality, we are
no different from tools.

227
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:04,500
No, that's not true...

228
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:07,166
I don't think of you or
them as tools at all.

229
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,416
Of course...

230
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,875
I recognize that not all
people think this way...

231
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,208
But... Sometimes,

232
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,750
when a person is forced
into a tough situation...

233
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,750
They try to maintain
their mental equilibrium

234
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:20,041
by convincing themselves
of things that aren't true.

235
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:24,375
The little ones
are so lucky.

236
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:27,541
They're treated like
friends, not enemies.

237
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:30,041
Like they're a genuine
part of the family.

238
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:34,500
Hey, I'm back!

239
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:35,750
Where've you been?

240
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:37,041
You were gone a while.

241
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,166
Sorry 'bout that...

242
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,000
I got carried away
at the snack store.

243
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:44,333
Pardon.

244
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:47,416
I would like to step out
and walk around for a bit...

245
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,583
If you don't mind, could I
ask you to show me around?

246
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:55,125
I'm curious to see
Earth's night sky.

247
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:57,291
Uh... I.

248
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:58,500
Yeah... Sure...

249
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,375
I'd be happy to, Laurie.

250
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,458
Why thank you very much, Kio.

251
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,833
The bones of the creatures
living on this asteroid

252
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:07,791
have a silicic acid compound
instead of calcium.

253
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:09,875
But wait, what does it mean?

254
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:12,000
Calcium is quite
rare on this--.

255
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:18,125
Sorry to spring
this on you...

256
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:20,875
Yeah...
We'll be waiting.

257
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,666
Good news, she
said she'd come...

258
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,458
Uh, Eris,
is everything okay?

259
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:27,458
Yeah, I'm fine.

260
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:29,750
Is it her...? You
don't like her?

261
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,125
No...

262
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,500
This is the first time
I've met her, actually.

263
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,083
So then what is it?

264
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:36,250
Well, I...

265
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:37,250
Ugh...

266
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,125
Hey, you can trust me.

267
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,000
Okay.

268
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,708
The Catians were divided...

269
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:47,875
regarding the issue of
them looking like us...

270
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:49,791
One group thought
it was okay...

271
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,666
That it didn't
really matter...

272
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,166
But the other faction
was horrified by it.

273
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,208
When they look like us,
as Laurie does,

274
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:00,375
there were those who felt
it took something away

275
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:03,125
from the Assistroid's ability
to function as a tool.

276
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:06,333
Having Catian form
caused moral dilemmas.

277
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:07,791
Although...

278
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,333
Who's to say we weren't
the root of those dilemmas

279
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:11,625
to begin with.

280
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,875
Wait, what do you mean?

281
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:17,125
Before Assistroids started
looking like they do now...

282
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:20,541
Our ancestors did many
horrific, terrible things

283
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:24,041
to the earlier,
humanoid models.

284
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:27,208
It got so bad it nearly
caused a civil war...

285
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:29,625
It wasn't until less than
two hundred cycles ago

286
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,375
that we finally started
to treat the old models

287
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,458
with the respect
they deserve.

288
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:35,083
Yeah but, Eris...

289
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:36,833
The past is the past,
there's nothing you can-

290
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,458
No, you're wrong.

291
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,791
I'm who I am because
of my ancestors...

292
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:47,458
We're all directly
linked to our past.

293
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,916
No matter what you do,
or how hard you try,

294
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,416
you can never
escape the mistakes

295
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,625
that were made before you.

296
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:57,041
But, my ancestors have already
made their apologies...

297
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:59,833
As a race and as
individual masters...

298
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:01,083
And, luckily
for all of us,

299
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,875
the Assistroids have
graciously accepted.

300
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,500
So you see...

301
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:08,291
that's why there's no point
in apologizing any further...

302
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,375
And so...

303
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:13,583
Go on.

304
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:14,875
And so...

305
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,791
It's just that...

306
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:20,291
I don't know what I could
possibly say to her.

307
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:22,375
I have no idea.

308
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,083
So, this sorta thing
happens to you too, huh?

309
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,333
It's okay...

310
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:33,291
I can handle doing the
talking with Laurie...

311
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,458
You just take it
easy, all right?

312
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,916
Thank you.

313
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I'm sorry...

314
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,958
But if you don't mind...

315
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,166
Listen...

316
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,208
I keep some elemental
calcium in the ship

317
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:48,250
to regulate its
cyclotron function.

318
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:50,416
I'm your teacher,
Kio, not your parent.

319
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,625
Why couldn't you ask your
sketchy uncle to do this?

320
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,458
Well...

321
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:56,625
I thought you might enjoy
meeting my new friend...

322
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,708
A robot from outer space.

323
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:01,666
Robo-legs...

324
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,250
okay...
Robo-arms...

325
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:04,333
that's great...

326
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:05,791
Robo...

327
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:07,416
kitty-ears?

328
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,791
So close...
Oh, so close.

329
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,958
I notice that Eris
did not come with us.

330
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,541
Oh... Eris was
busy 'cause...

331
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,291
uh, something
urgent came up...

332
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,166
She would've come
if she could've.

333
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,000
I understand.

334
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,375
Will you tell her
something for me...?

335
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:25,541
I want her to know that in no
way do I wish to trouble her...

336
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,750
and that everything
is in the past.

337
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,166
Yeah, but...

338
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,875
Eris says she still
bears responsibility.

339
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:34,250
All I wish for now, is that
you and the little ones

340
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,166
be happy and get along
with each other forever.

341
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,541
But... To be on terms
where one feels responsible,

342
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,375
or is made to feel so...

343
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,958
that's not what I would
call true happiness.

344
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,000
Beautiful.

345
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,958
You said you wanted
to see the night sky,

346
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,166
and this is one of
my favorite places

347
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,208
around town
to do that from.

348
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:07,666
Thank you...

349
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,458
A place as lovely as
this may be fitting

350
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,333
for granting
my master's wish.

351
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,166
I'm guessing he died
in that shipwreck?

352
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,416
Yes...

353
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,958
He was kind and
gentle, yet brave...

354
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:18,958
He was the best
master I ever had...

355
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,625
I miss him dearly.

356
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:22,875
You see...

357
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:25,583
That's why I wanted
to visit Earth.

358
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,458
Because...

359
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:30,958
of all the planets in the
Universe, he was headed here.

360
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,375
At the time...

361
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,500
The number of planets that
were both capable of life,

362
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,708
and within reach
of our spacecraft,

363
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:39,875
numbered close to three
thousand to the fourth power...

364
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,000
But against those
unfathomable odds...

365
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:44,458
He chose a course that,
if he'd made it,

366
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:46,208
would've led him
straight to Earth.

367
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:47,833
But, why here?

368
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:50,250
In my opinion,
it was his fate...

369
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,250
And if not for the accident...

370
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,708
I'm certain my master would
have been the first Catian

371
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:58,958
in history to set foot
on your planet.

372
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,041
So, you see...

373
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:01,875
I felt I had
to come here,

374
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:04,291
so I could fulfill
my master's destiny

375
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:06,541
His destiny?

376
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:09,666
After the warp
core breach,

377
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,416
we were trapped in an
alternate dimension...

378
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,916
Once we'd spent a very
long time there...

379
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,625
He started repeating
something to me.

380
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,458
That if we ever
landed on Earth,

381
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:22,083
and there were people there
that could be called human...

382
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,250
He would look up at the
night sky and sing a song.

383
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:27,666
And it wouldn't be a
Catian song, either...

384
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,125
It would be a song
by Earthlings.

385
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:32,041
So here I am.

386
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:36,416
Laurie?

387
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,416
Yes?

388
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,333
This song...

389
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,166
Would it be okay
if I heard it?

390
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,041
Yes...
Of course.

391

00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,458
And so, having fulfilled
her master's destiny,

432
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:04,875
Laurie, the Grand First
Assistroid, left Earth forever.

433
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:10,666
So, what...?

434
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,625
You decided to leave
everything up to Kio?

435
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:13,833
I did.

436
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:15,291
What a pity...

437
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,541
Laurie's a living witness
to history, you know?

438
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:20,458
I feel so ashamed.

439
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:22,583
This was pretty
special for you, Kio.

440
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,291
Probably won't
ever happen again.

441
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:25,833
But where will
Laurie go now...?

442
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:26,833
Back to Catia?

443
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,166
Sadly, no.

444
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,125
Her remaining
operational time--

445
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:31,541
her life that is -

446
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,250
won't last much longer.

447
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:37,916
After losing their masters,
as Laurie has,

448
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,791
Assistroids who go more
than two cycles

449
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:42,958
without being recalled are
given two basic options:

450
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,875
choose another master
or refuse measures

451
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:46,833
that will prolong
their life.

452
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:49,958
And Laurie...?
She's chosen the latter.

453
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:52,291
Hang on... How much
time does she have?

454
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:55,291
Could be as little as
less than half a cycle...

455
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:57,958
The lifetime of her biological
parts is indefinite...

456
00:21:58,041 --> 00:22:00,250
With the new models
we know exactly.

457
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:02,958
But with Laurie,
only time will tell.

458
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:06,291
Typhoon seventeen is now over
the Pacific, moving north,

459
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:10,833
roughly four hundred kilometers
south of Ishigaki Island.

460
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:18,208
The little ones
are so lucky.

461
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:25,125
Oh, no, I'm fine...

462
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:28,666
I was just thinking about
something, that's all...

463
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,416
I did wanna ask...

464
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,166
You think there's any
way to fix this guy?

465
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,833
Yeah, please.

466
00:22:38,916 --> 00:22:40,500
Thanks a lot.

467
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:42,291
Friend.

468
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,541
Captain, I...
thank you for this.

469
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:01,708
I'd like to watch
Earth as long as I can.

470
00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:03,250
I understand...

471
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:06,708
This planet is just as special
to us, as it is to you.

472
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:07,958
By the way...

473
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:09,458
There's a song
I'd like to listen

474
00:23:09,541 --> 00:23:11,041
to while
we admire the view.

475
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:12,250
That okay?

476
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:13,833
Yes...

477
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:16,791
Actually, I was just thinking
of asking you the same thing.

478
00:25:25,666 --> 00:25:27,875
It's Christmas time,
so what's up?

479
00:25:27,958 --> 00:25:30,125
Catians learning about
Santa Claus and stuff!

480
00:25:30,208 --> 00:25:31,875
Of course, nothing
says holiday spirit

481
00:25:31,958 --> 00:25:34,708
like a bunch of evil space
dogs attacking your home!

482
00:25:34,791 --> 00:25:36,875
Next time...!
"We Came After You!"

483
00:25:36,958 --> 00:25:39,500
I'm coming
to drop in on you!
