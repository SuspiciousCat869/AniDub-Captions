1
00:00:08,166 --> 00:00:10,041
One night,
I had a close encounter

2
00:00:10,125 --> 00:00:11,625
with a UFO
in the desert...

3
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:14,625
I was given a red supersuit
by aliens from another world,

4
00:00:14,708 --> 00:00:16,791
and told to save the Earth.

5
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:19,333
However, since I lost the
suit's instruction manual,

6
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:20,791
it's been a disaster!

7
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:23,458
When I try and fly,
I usually crash into things--

8
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:24,916
mostly the ground.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,541
But, with the help
of my partner,...

10
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:29,083
former CIA operative
Manami Kinjyo,...

11
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:30,916
I'm suddenly
walkin' on air!

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,333
I never thought
I could feel so free!

13
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:35,916
Who's that flying away
on a wing and a prayer...?

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,875
Believe it or not,
it's just me...

15
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:40,375
"The Greatest Catian Heroine!"

16
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:32,333
We have commenced
fueling of the vessel...

17
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:34,583
Should take approximately
thirty minutes.

18
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:37,083
Thank you, General.

19
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:39,916
The NATO forces
are closing in, guys!

20
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,333
They'll be in attack
range within minutes!

21
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:43,708
Oh, no...

22
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:45,208
We won't make
it in time.

23
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:46,750
Don't worry,
you will...!

24
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,291
We're gonna teach
them a lesson:

25
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:51,041
when you mess with the
cats, you get the claws!

26
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,000
What's that ahead?!

27
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:07,750
Is this part
of the exercise?

28
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:09,708
This is not an exercise...

29
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,458
It's a top-secret,
off-the-books mission

30
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,916
to eliminate
a terrorist cell!

31
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,666
Heads up...! Treat anyone
approaching as hostiles...!

32
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,666
Target those bikes!

33
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:24,041
Fire!

34
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:26,208
How was that one, kitty?

35
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:36,958
Huh?!

36
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:51,083
Say goodbye to your nice,
warm tanks, boys!

37
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:00,708
Fueling now at...

38
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,291
fifty percent complete.

39
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,500
Acknowledged.

40
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,666
How would that
make you feel...?

41
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,291
... I know that you're
in love with him, too.

42
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,583
I can't think
about that now.

43
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:16,208
You serve a country
you don't love...

44
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:19,041
You protect a planet
you know nothing about...

45
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,000
Makes you no more
than a mercenary...

46
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,416
A killer for hire.

47
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,916
Yes...

48
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,875
I am a killer...

49
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:28,750
And I don't deserve
to fall in love.

50
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,750
Something the matter, Kio?

51
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,666
Well--I'm just
a little nervous...

52
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,375
I'm not used to flying in
planes, much less in space.

53
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:37,750
Hey, it'll be all right...

54
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,375
I'm used to flying in space.

55
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,041
I'll be right here
if you need me.

56
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:42,291
Kio...

57
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:45,000
Keep it together,
would you...?

58
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:47,500
Aoi! You've gotta
tell him right now.

59
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:48,875
Tell who what?

60
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:51,500
Once we're in space,
it's all over.

61
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,333
I thought I told
you to butt out!

62
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:54,666
I know...

63
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,708
But I don't wanna see
you lose your chance!

64
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:59,875
Leave me alone...!
Manami-- we both stand to lose

65
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:02,541
just as much by
not telling him.

66
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,500
Don't try to make
this about me!

67
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:05,666
Don't try to deny it...

68
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:09,166
You love Kio, too.

69
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,666
You've always loved Kio...

70
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,583
You just can't admit it.

71
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:18,291
You just... bury
your feelings for him...

72
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:19,583
Trust me...

73
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,166
I know what it's like...

74
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,958
Just shut up!

75
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,875
Gunships...!
All units, fall back!

76
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:34,208
Why are you guys fighting
at a time like this?

77
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:35,500
Yeah, now is the time

78
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:37,625
when we all need
to be working together...

79
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:40,125
I don't know the reason
why you two are fighting...

80
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:41,250
But for the time being,

81
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,333
could you put aside
your problems...?

82
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:45,708
Please, for me?
No, I can't...!

83
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,375
Oh, and the reason
for our fight...?!

84
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:50,916
If you must know, it's
because of you, Eris!

85
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,083
You're not just
shooting at me...!

86
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:57,916
You're shooting
at kitty, too!

87
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,541
And I'm gonna make
you regret it!

88
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:07,291
This sucks...!
I've known Kio for years

89
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:10,291
and had feelings for him
I was too scared to admit...!

90
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,583
But part of me still
thought we'd be together...!

91
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,166
Then all of a sudden...

92
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,833
You showed up
out of the blue...

93
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:18,458
And you took
all that away.

94
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:19,875
I'm so sorry...

95
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:22,458
I can't say I blame the guy...!
I mean, look at you!.

96
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:24,666
A gorgeous cat girl
from outer space...!

97
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,791
With kitty ears and a tail
and perfect giant boobs...!

98
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:30,625
You're all sweet and innocent,
just like Kio is!.

99
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,666
How can I hope to compete?!

100
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,666
Manami...

101
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,750
I thought I'd finally
given up on him...

102
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:40,916
But if you knew
him like I do...

103
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,333
you'd understand
why I couldn't...

104
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:46,041
If so...

105
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:48,416
Why have you been
pushing me towards him?

106
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,041
I don't know...

107
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:51,708
Maybe I wanted
to give you a chance

108
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:53,208
before I tried for him...

109
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:54,416
You deserved it...

110
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,625
Or maybe some part of me
wanted you and Eris

111
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,250
at each other's throats...

112
00:06:58,333 --> 00:06:59,500
But...

113
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:03,041
Whatever I did, I just
pushed him further away.

114
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:05,250
I'm sorry...

115
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,125
Let's see here...

116
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:09,416
So I guess what you're
trying to say, Manami...

117
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,791
Is that Kio...

118
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:14,416
means everything in the
world to you, is that right?

119
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,083
Fantastic...!

120
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:18,875
And you feel the same,
don't you, Aoi?!

121
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,083
Then it's settled...

122
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:24,875
Since all three
of us feel that way,

123
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:27,000
let's be in love
with Kio together!

124
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,000
Huh?!

125
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:30,125
Wha-...?!
That's not possible!

126
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:31,833
Sure it is,
because on Catia,

127
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,583
it's okay to have
multiple mates.

128
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,041
And our embassy
at his house

129
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,500
is legally considered
to be Catian soil.

130
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,041
So you see...

131
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,875
We don't have to fight over
Kio since we can all share him!

132
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:47,041
Are you...

133
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,291
saying what
I think you are?

134
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:08,833
Kitty!

135
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,458
Maya!

136
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:23,375
There's still
a few left.

137
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:24,875
Can you two handle 'em?

138
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,375
Yeah!

139
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:29,458
General!.

140
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,041
Fueling is now complete!

141
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,083
Stand by...!

142
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:33,500
Are we go,
no-go for launch?!

143
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:35,541
Miss Eris, you are
'go' for launch!

144
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:36,916
Understood...!

145
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Kio?

146
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,750
Right...

147
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,166
CatiEarth-One...

148
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,708
Engage!

149
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:27,000
Cat Planet Cuties!

150
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,041
Look at that...

151
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,166
Oh, wow.

152
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,375
Amazing...

153
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:40,458
Beautiful...

154
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,125
Incredible...

155
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,125
All those different
countries down there...

156
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,083
All those millions
of people in them.

157
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:48,375
But you know what...?

158
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:49,708
It would be even
more incredible

159
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:51,125
if they could
all get along...

160
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:52,791
If everyone on Earth
could just be friends...

161
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:53,875
Or better...

162
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,625
Huh?

163
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,125
What'd be truly great...

164
00:09:57,208 --> 00:10:01,708
Is if everybody in the
universe could be friends.

165
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:04,541
I'm ready to do my
thing, Miss Eris!

166
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,375
Okay, head's up,
Assistroids...

167
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,416
I need you to follow
Luros and get to work

168
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,291
constructing
a warp engine.

169
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:13,750
We've got incoming!

170
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,458
Lots of 'em!

171
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,791
Take out that ship...

172
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:22,125
Turn it into kitty litter.

173
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,750
I'm guessing these guys
are not on our side.

174
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:31,250
No... We got
our work cut out.

175
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:32,250
Aoi...

176
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,625
I'm sorry.

177
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:38,083
Please don't be...

178
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:39,375
What is it?

179
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:40,791
For all I know...

180
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,375
This might be the end,
so I don't care anymore...

181
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:45,208
And I'm hoping you
feel the same way.

182
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,958
Yeah...
I sure do.

183
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:58,208
That'll have to do
for your Christmas gift.

184
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:07,000
I thought you said you
were too scared to do that!

185
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,208
'Kay, I'll admit that
was way better...

186
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:11,541
Than watching some movie!

187
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:12,916
Well, you guys did it...

188
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,916
So I'm gonna, too!

189
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,916
All right--
let's do this.

190
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,916
O-kay!

191
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,041
Roger!

192
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,250
Huh?!

193
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:33,916
Whuh-, what are you-...?

194
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,083
The three of us are gonna

195
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:38,000
keep that pack
of mangy mutts off you.

196
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:42,250
We have only
one priority...

197
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,583
That's to get both you
and Captain Qoone's bell

198
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:46,041
onto the mothership.

199
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,458
We'll keep you safe even
if it costs us our lives.

200
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,708
That's crazy!

201
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,375
There's way too many
of them out there!

202
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:53,833
Not too long ago, you
told me you didn't know

203
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:55,666
what you wanted
to do with your life...

204
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,458
what your purpose
was, remember?

205
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:58,750
Uh...

206
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,833
Do you still
feel that way?

207
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:08,291
All right... Just focus
on what you need to do

208
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:09,833
and leave these dogs to us.

209
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:11,625
We are counting on you, too.

210
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:14,166
Thanks...
I got this.

211
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,166
Eris... Moving out!

212
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:32,875
You bitches aren't getting
any closer than this!

213
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:35,125
For Kio!
Let's take 'em out!

214
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:43,958
Hurry, everybody, we
don't have much time!

215
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,666
Finished?!
Great!

216
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,000
Destroy that ship!

217
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:29,000
No, you don't!

218
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:37,250
Again!

219
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,333
Uh...

220
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,125
Where am I?

221
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,458
Impact,
starboard side!

222
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:25,958
Ready or not,
the dogs are here!

223
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:27,083
All right...

224
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,708
All hands,
battle stations!

225
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,375
Commence counterattack!

226
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,000
Aye-aye!

227
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,416
I'll put you down...!

228
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,000
All of you!

229
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,875
Damn...! We can't advance
any farther like this!

230
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:33,041
Wait, what is that thing?!

231
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:38,583
They turned one of our laser
rangefinders into a weapon?!

232
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,875
Fall back, fall back!

233
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,083
What the?!

234
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:52,250
Kio!

235
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,416
Whoa!

236
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,958
Melwin--hey!

237
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,375
This place...

238
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,958
is a computer room?

239
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,416
Yes, now tell it to "restart!"

240
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,875
Right...!
Computer, restart!

241
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,500
Request... denied.

242
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:20,500
What?!

243
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,125
But why?!

244
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:25,000
Only a Catian can issue
top-level command codes

245
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:27,125
such as the one
you requested...

246
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,291
According to my scans,...

247
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:31,083
your genetic
profile is roughly

248
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:34,708
one-one-hundred-thousandth
of a percent non-Catian.

249
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,291
Oh, no...

250
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,916
The bell...!

251
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,416
Use it to reorganize
your genetics, Kio!

252
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,708
Wait a minute,
it can do that?

253
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:49,291
Of course!

254
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,208
We don't call them multitasking
organizers for nothing!

255
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:53,708
Okay...

256
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:56,791
Hey, bell...!
Make me a Catian!

257
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,583
What kind of
weapon is that?!

258
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,083
The kind I can't
dodge forever!

259
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,875
Hold on, I'm coming!

260
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:10,250
Bad doggie!

261
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:14,500
What the?!

262
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,708
Well, girls...
Let's finish this...!

263
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:19,083
Engage Final Laser!

264
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:24,750
QX cannons...

265
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,583
Fire!

266
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,958
Doggone hyperspace
graviton blast?!

267
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:36,958
Direct hit!

268
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:39,041
Yeah, we did it!

269
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,666
It's no use...!
I can't control the ship...!

270
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:47,000
Matrey...!
Throw me a bone!

271
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:00,250
Their base was
knocked out of orbit!

272
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:03,750
That's not good!

273
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,208
What's the matter, Eris?

274
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:07,041
It's falling to
Earth too rapidly!

275
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,083
Look at the trajectory
it's following...!

276
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,583
It's going to crash across

277
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:14,250
a three hundred kilometer-
wide area of central Okinawa!

278
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:15,250
Aoi!

279
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,583
No! Wait!

280
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:21,416
Chiba!

281
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,875
Gauge it!

282
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:27,583
If we can increase
its angle of reentry,

283
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:30,541
it'll break apart and
burn up in the atmosphere!

284
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:31,875
Low on fuel...?!

285
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:33,000
Whatever.

286
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:34,875
I have to try!

287
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:53,875
Dammit...!

288
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,958
I just don't
have the power!

289
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,125
Manami?!

290
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,416
Can't let you play
hero all by yourself.

291
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,416
Idiot!.

292
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,500
This is suicide!

293
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,625
That didn't stop you.

294
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:10,916
With all the damage those
battlesuits have sustained,

295
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,708
they're not gonna make it
through atmospheric reentry!

296
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,458
Calculate a way
to save them, now!

297
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,375
You're wrong...!

298
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,958
I don't care how bad
the odds are against it,

299
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:22,625
I'll do whatever
is necessary!

300
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:26,375
Just find me some way
to save them, please!

301
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,375
Oh, no!

302
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,875
I'm not afraid
of dying today...

303
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:36,333
After all, I'm just a
cold-blooded killer, right...?

304
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:39,625
Someone who fights for a
country she doesn't even love.

305
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:40,958
Oh, yeah...?

306
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:44,333
What about fighting
for the people you love?

307
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,458
Oh, yeah...

308
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:48,000
Guess there is that.

309
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:49,416
Chiba?
Nakamura...?

310
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,708
Thank you...

311
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:52,833
And I'm sorry.

312
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:55,833
Same for you...
Yun-Fat.

313
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:02,000
And thank you...

314
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:05,500
You... are a true
friend, Manami.

315
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,833
Likewise...

316
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,041
So long...

317
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,041
Aoi.

318
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,416
Goodbye then...

319
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,166
Manami.

320
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:18,416
Aoi...!

321
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,000
Manami!

322
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:25,000
Guys, quick!

323
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:27,041
Take my hand!

324
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:43,916
Whoa!

325
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,208
Those are some fancy
shooting stars!

326
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,875
Pretty.

327
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:55,041
Oh! Aura!

328
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:57,125
Where ya been,
kiddy-widdy-widdy?!

329
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:58,416
We missed you so much!

330
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,291
We missed you!

331
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:02,458
Kio!

332
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:03,458
Kio!

333
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:04,666
Kio!

334
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,750
Welcome back, guys!

335
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:12,416
Oh...!
I'm so sorry, Kio!

336
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,208
Me too--
are you okay?!

337
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:16,833
Wait... are those-...?!

338
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:18,250
Yeah...

339
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,375
Wha-...?!

340
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:31,625
Captain, you should still
be recuperating in sick bay.

341
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,166
I'm fine, Doctor...

342
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,125
That nice, long cat nap
did me a world of good;

343
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:36,416
I'm feeling much better...

344
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,416
But never mind me;

345
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,583
what matters now

346
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:40,833
is how Operation
Santa Claus is proceeding.

347
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:42,833
It's right on
schedule, Captain!

348
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:46,166
Yeah...! Everyone'll
be so surprised!

349
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,000
I've heard of being
a monkey's uncle,

350
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:50,458
but being a kitty's uncle?

351
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:52,583
Well, if you ask me,
you're now the dreamiest-

352
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:53,916
looking guy on the planet!

353
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,708
Uh, thanks a lot, Antonia,

354
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:58,250
but I wouldn't get too used to
this look on me, if I were you.

355
00:21:58,333 --> 00:21:59,833
Oh, no...

356
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:02,375
You're not gonna change yourself
back to normal, are you?!

357
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:03,416
Please don't!

358
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,708
Kio...

359
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:07,000
Are you saying...
you don't like cat ears?

360
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:09,875
No... I do, a lot,
it's just that-...

361
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:12,041
Quick! You have
to see this!

362
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:22,750
Some kinda death ray?

363
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:23,833
Not at all;

364
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:25,791
it's a harmless
orbital elevator.

365
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:28,083
What's an orbital elevator?

366
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:29,875
It's a device which
allows you to reach space

367
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:32,625
without having
to use spacecraft.

368
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:35,416
It's our Christmas gift--
the first of many...

369
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,750
from Catia...

370
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:38,375
to the people of Earth.

371
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,625
Christmas gift?!

372
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:47,041
Hey... Snow...

373
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:48,333
It must be a by-product

374
00:22:48,416 --> 00:22:51,041
of the elevator's
emissive cooling vanes...

375
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:52,833
It looks like they're
causing the water vapor

376
00:22:52,916 --> 00:22:55,708
around them
to condense and freeze.

377
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,541
It's a Christmas miracle...!

378
00:22:57,625 --> 00:22:59,916
Snow in Okinawa!

379
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,875
Beautiful!

380
00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:06,958
Amazing...

381
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:08,916
A white Christmas!

382
00:23:47,916 --> 00:23:49,416
Sorry I've been a stranger.

383
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,916
How've you been?

384
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:57,541
Yeah, we're getting
along just fine...

385
00:23:57,625 --> 00:23:59,250
Oh, sweetie, you're
just saying that

386
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:01,958
because you brought
so many robots...

387
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:04,666
They're not
at all like dogs...

388
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,000
Yeah, you're right...

389
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:07,916
Won't be long before
Homo Sapiens

390
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,666
are more than just
"Earthlings."

391
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:13,416
They'll eventually be
space travelers, too.

392
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,791
Whaddya mean "Monstercats"
like me...?!

393
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:17,958
Don't call me a monster...!

394
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:20,958
I'm a cat immortal,
you doofus!

395
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:22,750
Yeah, I know...

396
00:24:22,833 --> 00:24:24,916
There are real
monsters out there...

397
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Vampires and
wolfmen and such...

398
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:28,583
And even worse...

399
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:30,083
Why do I have the
feeling this planet

400
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:32,500
is about to get crowded?

401
00:24:34,166 --> 00:24:37,250
There's game-playing afoot,
and the stakes are super high!

402
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:39,250
So high you could
lose your shirt -

403
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:41,250
and, um, the rest
of your clothes...

404
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:43,583
Special bonus
episode comin' up!

405
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:45,875
Next time:
"Come Drop By."

406
00:24:45,958 --> 00:24:48,125
I'm coming
to drop in on you!
