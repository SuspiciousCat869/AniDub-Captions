1
00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:10,875
Kio, a high school student
and would-be astronaut,...

2
00:00:10,958 --> 00:00:12,500
is inexplicably
marooned

3
00:00:12,583 --> 00:00:14,708
on a very un-school
like desert island,

4
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:17,583
where he finds a most
unusual magical bottle...

5
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:20,250
He gives it a rub, and in
a massive puff of smoke,...

6
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:23,083
emerges the sexy
cat-alien-genie-girl, Eris...

7
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:25,000
With a quick blink
of her cat eyes,

8
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:26,541
she transports
them off the island

9
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:28,458
and safely back
to Kio's place...

10
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:31,041
She declares him her
master and vows to help him

11
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:32,875
by granting
his every wish...

12
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:36,416
What tomfoolery will she
blink her way into this time?

13
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:17,666
"This is the
Cock-a-Doodle-Doo House...

14
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,000
A Restaurant in
the city of Okinawa.

15
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:21,583
In addition to its
unique arrangement

16
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:23,291
of South American recipes,

17
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,375
it's famous for having
the best roasted chicken

18
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:26,958
in all of Japan."

19
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:33,708
No way!

20
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:35,125
You stupid jerk!

21
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:36,875
You're trying to cheat
again, aren't you?!

22
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:39,125
I'm not cheating,
I'm just winning.

23
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:43,291
Whoever's got the six of
hearts, cough it up right now!

24
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:44,791
Wow, it's Kio...!

25
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:47,000
I see my friends,
I'll join them!

26
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:50,041
Add one more plate for me,
and give me two of everything!

27
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:53,250
Hey...! You guys sure seem
like you're having a good time!

28
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,125
Ho boy.

29
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:07,166
What's going on?

30
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,375
It's nothing.

31
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:10,083
A friendly game.

32
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,250
By the way you
guys are acting,

33
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:15,666
you'd think it's a
matter of life and death.

34
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:18,958
Yeah.

35
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:28,375
Huh? What the...

36
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,500
Oh! That's my cue.

37
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:31,583
"This is our story...

38
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:33,541
It all began this morning."

39
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:43,666
There are four each of thirty
four different kinds of tiles...

40
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,833
So, from one hundred
thirty-six total tiles,

41
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:48,041
each of the players
draws fourteen of them.

42
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:51,541
That's three hundred
billion tile combos.

43
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:54,500
And then from that number, you
create specific combinations...

44
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,708
Then we all compete with
each other by earning points

45
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:59,416
based on the
difficulty thereof.

46
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,916
Therefore, any points earned
in a half round with two innings

47
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,125
make for a
zero sum game.

48
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:05,208
And don't forget...

49
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,333
A sound strategy
which leads to victory

50
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:09,750
is more important than
going for a quick win.

51
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,083
It's also important

52
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,000
to try guessing your
opponents' tiles...

53
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:14,583
Do that based
on what they discard,

54
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:17,375
while keeping them guessing
about what you're discarding.

55
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,208
And you're allowed to talk
during game play...

56
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:24,000
So it's more than just a game,
it's a communication tool.

57
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:27,458
It's a surprisingly deep
pastime, huh...?

58
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:30,291
Riichi! Ron!

59
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:31,541
I win!

60
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,458
Wha-- Big
Three Dragons?!

61
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,291
Plus, I'm the dealer!

62
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,750
Whoa...!
A Yakuman bullseye...!

63
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:40,583
Even with uncapped scoring,
this is pretty dramatic.

64
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,833
And even worse,
the Captain's wall is broken...

65
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,125
So she gets double points!

66
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:47,708
Aww...!
Guess I'm sunk, huh?

67
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,791
All of it, right?

68
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:53,041
The rule about stripping when
you lose is the one thing

69
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,250
I'm having a hard
time understanding.

70
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,375
Now that you mention it,
it is kind of strange...

71
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,916
And these Mahjong outfits
look like school uniforms.

72
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,166
Well, according
to Eris's research...

73
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,500
this is the way humans like
to play games on Earth.

74
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,541
There's still so much more
for us to learn about them.

75
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:11,958
I bet if we just keep at it,
we'll figure them out.

76
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:14,916
That's all the
clothes I have...

77
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,916
What now?

78
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,041
There's nothing
left to take off.

79
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:19,833
Here!

80
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,541
According to the rulebook,
if you've got negative points,

81
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,750
you put on the box!

82
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,000
You know this reminds me,

83
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,041
I wonder how
Eris's survey is going.

84
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,500
Oh... She said she'll be
doing a field exam with Kio

85
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,708
and the gang today.

86
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:33,166
What kind of field exam?

87
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:46,291
Yum...! This golden-brown
chicken skin is so crunchy...!

88
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:48,750
And the garlic and spices
inside are so rich...

89
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,916
The flavor they give
to the meat is so...

90
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,333
ohhh, so good...!

91
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:54,333
The best!

92
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:55,708
Yeah, yeah, yeah...!

93
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:57,375
So, what's on for today?

94
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,750
You mentioned you wanted our
help with your survey, right?

95
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:02,250
Oh, yes,
thank you.

96
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,208
Wanna swallow and
try that again?

97
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:07,750
Yeah... What Eris
wanted to do is survey

98
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,583
how we Earthlings play games.

99
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:12,000
A survey of how we play?

100
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,666
Yes...! It's a part of our
customs and culture study...

101
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,875
We formulated a list of
Earth's pastimes for analysis...

102
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:23,625
But there're some things
we have to actually do

103
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,291
in order to
understand them.

104
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,416
So if you're okay with it,

105
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,125
I was hoping to
play with you guys.

106
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:29,458
That makes sense...

107
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:30,666
When it comes
to fun and games,

108
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,625
I say the more
the merrier!

109
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:35,750
But... Why did you
choose this place?

110
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,500
Well, since we're all
gonna play together,

111
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:39,166
we wanted to invite
Antonia to come...

112
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,083
After all, she really
hasn't had much chance

113
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:43,083
to play many
games with others.

114
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:45,791
Since the beautiful Miss
Eris invited me along...

115
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,875
I thought it'd be nice
if we ate together, too.

116
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:48,958
Yes, that's right...

117
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,916
One time, during
a camping trip,

118
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,916
My Lady dined
in this restaurant,

119
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,583
and was quite
taken with it...

120
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,333
It's been a mainstay
for us ever since.

121
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,375
Oh.

122
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,833
Here's the plan.

123
00:06:58,916 --> 00:06:59,958
I've gathered up
some fun games

124
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,166
we should all be able
to play together.

125
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,833
Mahjong,
cards, backgammon,

126
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:05,458
chess,
shogi, Pop-Up Pirate,

127
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,750
Crocodile Dentist...

128
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:10,333
Wow...!
Looks like fun.

129
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:12,125
I'm not so sure
about this, you guys.

130
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:13,458
Huh?

131
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:15,125
If we play them just
to explain how they work,

132
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,166
then it won't be fun.
You know?

133
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,458
It'll be about as entertaining
as reading a rule book...

134
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,041
Eris won't gain
an understanding

135
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:26,458
of the real reason
we play games.

136
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:31,333
So then,
what should we do?

137
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:33,875
Why, there's gotta be a prize
for the winners, of course.

138
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,541
Um... Okay...

139
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:36,875
That sounds great...!

140
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,041
Surely, if there's
a prize at stake,

141
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,666
then we'll all play
like we mean it,

142
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,708
and get more into
the game, won't we?

143
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:43,708
But... What
will the prize be?

144
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:46,000
Since you were nice
enough to invite me...

145
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:48,375
I can help
you out with that.

146
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:02,916
Not enough?

147
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:06,250
In that case, we'll
need some surety bonds

148
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:07,541
from my Swiss account.

149
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,208
No, please...
That's okay!

150
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:11,791
With those stakes, it
wouldn't be a game anymore.

151
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,750
Okay...

152
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,125
But then,
what should we do?

153
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:16,791
My Lady.

154
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,833
Maybe this could
serve as the prize?

155
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,458
A model of the
Divine Embodiment,

156
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:26,583
crafted by the Kitty-Ear
Order of the Underside

157
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,250
of the Kitten's Paw...

158
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,458
A fan collector's item we
recently had commissioned

159
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:33,041
by a world-famous artist.

160
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,208
Sorry, this just
isn't doing it for me.

161
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:40,125
I think it's great.

162
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:43,541
Well, if that's no good,
how about we try this?

163
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:46,791
Here, look...

164
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:49,083
It's a behind-the-scenes
making-of documentary

165
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:52,291
for a film Kio and
his video club made.

166
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,416
Don't you have anything
better than that?

167
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,125
Hey...! That's the movie
I helped you guys shoot, right?

168
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:59,166
I wanna copy!

169
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,000
It has great shots
of Kio taking a nap...

170
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,250
And some shots of
Kio having a snack...

171
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,208
And some shots
of Kio laughing...

172
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:07,666
Some shots of Kio making
a mistake and crying...

173
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,416
And other shots of Kio...

174
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,375
Like the ones where
he gets naked!

175
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:15,916
Yes...! I managed to film
you changing clothes a lot!

176
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:20,166
Hey...! You never
mentioned that before!

177
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,125
Now that's more like it...!
Think we found our prize.

178
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:24,333
What...?
Manami...

179
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:25,791
No way!

180
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,291
Now don't
be such a baby...

181
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:30,250
Come on, what does it
matter if we see it, huh?

182
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,583
Kio changing and
getting naked!

183
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:39,041
It's not fair for me
to just be a taker...

184
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:41,166
The right thing to do would be
to prepare some kind of prize

185
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,333
from the Catian
Embassy, but...

186
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,791
Um... What in
the hell are these?

187
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,916
It's a three-piece
set of Iriomote cats,

188
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,458
a very rare species that came in
the chocolate eggs Kio gave me!

189
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,000
That's just stupid.

190
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,250
They're not stupid,

191
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,583
they're said to be quite
elusive and precious.

192
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:01,916
Sorry to rain
on your parade,

193
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,625
but that's the worst
prize I've ever seen.

194
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,000
We have a package?

195
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,833
What is it?

196
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:19,583
Oh,...

197
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:22,583
it appears
to be a DVD.

198
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,208
It's Aoi and Manami!

199
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:29,500
"These chicks get down and dirty
in this action-packed epic...

200
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:32,125
A compilation of
girltastic action...

201
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,791
"Full Metal Feast of Debauchery
Series Number Seven...

202
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,791
Amazon Bunnies
from Hell vs.

203
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,541
Slavegirl Naughty
Maid Squad"...

204
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,291
Directed by Takao Kawasaki,

205
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:43,583
starring Manami Kinjyo
and Aoi Futaba."

206
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:44,916
You don't mean...

207
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,625
It's...
From when we--...?

208
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:48,625
It was the movie they
appeared in as a condition

209
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,208
for borrowing
the powerboat...

210
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,375
Taking a cue from
director Lars Von Triers'

211
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:53,791
'Dancer in the Dark,'

212
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:56,166
many hidden cameras had
been placed on the boat...

213
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,208
Of course, at the time,
neither of the girls

214
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,958
was fully aware of the mess
they had gotten themselves into.

215
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,666
That bald bastard!

216
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,333
"Thanks to all
your amazing work,

217
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,875
our little production
was successfully completed.

218
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:14,708
I'm sending you a copy
for your review...

219
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:15,666
I hope you enjoy it...

220
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,541
Takao Kawasaki."

221
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,958
Wow... That's amazing!

222
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:22,000
Well since you didn't like
my initial offering...

223
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,708
what do you say
to the Catian Embassy

224
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,458
submitting this as a prize?

225
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:28,375
Sounds good!

226
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:29,583
W-Whoa, no...!

227
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,583
Gimme...!
Y-you can't watch that!

228
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:35,375
Oh, come on...
What does it matter, huh?

229
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:38,250
Since you put up a DVD that's
embarrassing to me as a prize,

230
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,000
I'd say we're even.

231
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:43,833
Plus, I'm guessing
with this on the table,

232
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,375
you two are going to play
with everything you've got,

233
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,041
aren't you?

234
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:54,250
All right, we have all
the prizes accounted for!

235
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:56,833
And if you want 'em, you're
gonna have to win 'em.

236
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:07,583
So that's why--...

237
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,250
They're so serious.

238
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,041
Still, it's really exciting...

239
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:12,625
When you add probability
to gamesmanship,

240
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:15,250
it takes more than just making
the most favorable moves to win,

241
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,125
which makes it more fun.

242
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:20,375
All right, which one of you
has the six of hearts, huh...?

243
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:23,250
Man, without the stupid six of
hearts, I can't get anywhere.

244
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:24,916
Where is it?!

245
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,958
I'm not talking
about you, you moron!

246
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,291
Ca-- Cat Planet Cuties!

247
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:51,750
Royal flush, ladies!

248
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:57,208
Well, looks like Doctor
Durel wins again.

249
00:12:57,291 --> 00:13:00,166
People who don't show emotion
are too good at this.

250
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,541
On Earth there's
a name for it...

251
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:02,583
"Poker face."

252
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:04,291
Sure wish I had one!

253
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,666
This is an extremely
fascinating game...

254
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,041
Though I'm still not sure

255
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,750
why you have to take your
clothes off when you lose.

256
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,083
I'm hoping if
we keep playing,

257
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,958
we might eventually
figure that out.

258
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,875
Hey...! You may be
winning right now, Doctor,

259
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,458
but just you wait...

260
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:19,791
Yep! Before this day is done,
you're gonna strip down

261
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:22,875
'til you're naked as the day
you were born, I guarantee!

262
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:25,500
Hah... Do you wanna put
some money on that?

263
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:33,500
Eventually, they started
to get the hang of it...

264
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,000
more or less.

265
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,208
Meanwhile, back at the
'Cock-a-doodle-doo.'

266
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:43,333
Eris and her friends were
in a heated battle

267
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:45,500
over a game
of 'Rhyming Doubt.'

268
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,666
Tricks...
Here's a six.

269
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,208
Jive... A Five.

270
00:13:58,291 --> 00:13:59,458
More...

271
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:00,708
Here's a four.

272
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,791
Me...
I've got a three.

273
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,750
Blue...
Here's a two.

274
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,333
Maids...
Ace of Spades.

275
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:07,625
No way.

276
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:10,083
Say 'I doubt it'
if you don't believe me.

277
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,208
Whatever,
that's fine...

278
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:15,625
Uh,...

279
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:16,791
Ring...

280
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:18,000
'cause I've got a King.

281
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:20,750
Doubt it!

282
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:22,208
Gotcha!

283
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,000
So, I'm next, right?

284
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,791
Nine...
I'm still fine.

285
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,916
Eight...!
Sorry I'm late.

286
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,291
Yes... Seven
I'm in heaven.

287
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,750
Six... Time
to pick up sticks.

288
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,125
Let's see...

289
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,791
What now...?

290
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,750
Okay... Five,
and I'm still alive!

291
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,458
Doubt it!

292
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:50,125
Finally, the six
of hearts shows up.

293
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:53,041
All those cards and you
don't have a five, huh?

294
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,541
Just shut your mouth!

295
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:58,000
I tried my best
to keep a straight face.

296
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,666
You realize
every time you lie,

297
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,291
your eyes get all shifty...

298
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:06,125
Si--.

299
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:08,916
Six... All treats,
no tricks.

300
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,791
Five, Ichika's
hunger's ali--

301
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:14,041
Four... She
should eat more.

302
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,375
Three...
And I'm free.

303
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,208
Doubt it!

304
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:22,583
And, Kio wins!

305
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:25,333
All right!

306
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:27,583
Okay, then.

307
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,041
Now, the winner
will decide

308
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,916
which of the prizes
to claim as their own.

309
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,041
Huh...
Let's see here...

310
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:35,500
Which one do
I want the most?

311
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:39,958
Mm... truth be told, I sure
would like to watch this DVD.

312
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:41,208
But...

313
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:44,166
First I need to recover
this guy right here.

314
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:50,666
Hold on...! It's not
time to relax yet!

315
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,750
Man... I wanted to watch
that making-of movie.

316
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,583
What is wrong with you?!

317
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:58,291
All right, moving
onto the next game!

318
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:09,125
The next
competitive event is-

319
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:14,208
Next time, I'd like to
shoot something like this.

320
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,416
What is it...?
A sci-fi piece?

321
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,166
Sci-fi's just the backdrop...

322
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,125
It's actually more of a drama.

323
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:21,833
But there are still
aliens and explosions

324
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:23,708
and lots of ray gun battles.

325
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:26,500
This type of thing is
all the rage right now.

326
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:28,041
Well, it's an
independent film,

327
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:29,458
so feel free to think
outside of the box

328
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:31,333
and do what
you like, okay?

329
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,250
The alien life forms don't
necessarily have to look

330
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:34,541
like humans, either...

331
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,083
They could be sub-beings

332
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:39,250
who have inverse dextro-rotatory
isomeric amino acids...

333
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,708
Or creatures that
are silicon-based

334
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,125
rather than carbon-based...

335
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,625
Or life forms made of hot,

336
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:46,125
flaming matter that live
on the surface of the sun...

337
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:49,166
Just don't forget, there is
always room for imagination!

338
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:51,375
Yeah, but...

339
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:54,416
That doesn't sound
realistic to me.

340
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,750
Not realistic?!

341
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:58,208
Not scientific.

342
00:16:58,291 --> 00:16:59,916
Not scientific?!

343
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,250
Yeah no, not after you've
seen the real thing.

344
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:03,708
Yeah, right?

345
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:05,541
Honestly, when
I hear the word 'alien,'

346
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,416
all I can think of
is someone like Eris.

347
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,500
Totally!

348
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:13,541
I'm afraid this is doing
irreparable damage

349
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:15,958
to the sci-fi genre.

350
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,666
Hey, everybody!

351
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,291
Uncle Yuichi in the hiz-ouse!

352
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:20,750
Oh, Mr. iyagi...

353
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:22,166
It doesn't look like
Kio's gonna grace us

354
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,166
with his presence today.

355
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,458
Ah, that's okay...

356
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,833
As a matter of fact,
I'm not here to see Kio...

357
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:29,250
I'm here to see
these two, actually.

358
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:33,125
Wait's over, girls.

359
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:34,833
All right!

360
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:40,666
Obviously we need to
mortgage the railroads

361
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,125
and then have
the bank finance it.

362
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:43,500
Right!

363
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,333
I want that property, put
in the winning bid for it.

364
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:46,833
Right!

365
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:49,166
Put up some hotels, and get
the electric company, too.

366
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,458
Right!

367
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:51,541
File a formal complaint.

368
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:52,625
To the courts!

369
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:53,916
Right!

370
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,375
But I don't have
any more money left!

371
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,541
The rest of the players
are bankrupt...

372
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,208
So Antonia wins the day!

373
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:04,625
Of course.

374
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:08,333
This game is a microcosm
of capitalist society, right?

375
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:09,875
She's a pro at this...

376
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:12,375
I guess being a
millionaire has its perks.

377
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:15,291
My Lady, since
you're the winner,

378
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,500
now it's time to choose
your favorite prize.

379
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,625
Well, let's see here...

380
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:22,000
Honestly, I like them all.

381
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:26,291
I think I'll take back the
figure of the Divine Embodiment,

382
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:28,875
it's so cute.

383
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:30,708
Are you absolutely
certain about this...?

384
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:31,750
It's what you want?

385
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:32,833
Yes, of course.

386
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:35,916
I couldn't bear
to part with it.

387
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,291
We're saved again.

388
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,541
All that's left is the DVD
and the cat things...

389
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:42,916
If we lose this time, someone's
definitely gonna see that film!

390
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Now then.

391
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:46,250
Time to move onto
the next round...

392
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:52,416
The next competitive
event is-

393
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,875
It's... Oh my.

394
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:13,666
You're careless.

395
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,375
Check.

396
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,666
Wait... Hold on!

397
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,625
No, I take it back!

398
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:31,833
Very well then.

399
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:34,125
I bravely placed myself
in the way of battle...

400
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,333
I'll accept my
defeat gracefully.

401
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:37,750
But I can promise
you this much,

402
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:40,541
I won't surrender
so easily...

403
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,833
Now...
Play me again!

404
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,333
O-kay...

405
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:54,208
So... Manami,
you're up next...

406
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:55,958
Right foot red, please!

407
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,750
Ah...!
I can't!

408
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,708
Whatever you do,
don't move!

409
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:09,583
All right...!
Kio, you're up next...

410
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,291
Right hand blue.

411
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:13,208
Um... Let's see...

412
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:15,041
Blue, huh...?

413
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:17,083
Oh... There's one ri-

414
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:20,416
Hey!. She said "blue"
not "boobs," jerk!

415
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,458
Please, don't look!

416
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:27,041
Uh... Sorry.

417
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,958
Okay... Eris
gets a bonus move...

418
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:34,916
Do whatever you
like on yellow!

419
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,500
'Kay!

420
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,375
What is this...?

421
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,875
Come on, you can't do that,
that's cheating!

422
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:44,875
But... She said
whatever I like!

423
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:46,791
Your hand or foot,
okay...?!

424
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:49,208
Besides, the rest of us
don't even have tails!

425
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,416
Oh yeah...

426
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,166
Well then...

427
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,666
Here!

428
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,625
Hey! Cut that out...!

429
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:59,375
Eris, what in the hell do you
think you're doing?!

430
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,500
What?. But...
Manami, you said-

431
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:04,458
Get your boobs
out of his face!

432
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:06,333
Sorry, I can't help it!

433
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:09,000
You guys, what the heck's
going on back there?

434
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:11,916
Fine...! You can use your
tail, just call off the jugs,

435
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,833
okay?!

436
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:15,958
All right,
that sounds fair!

437
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:27,500
Yes...! And Eris
wins the game!

438
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:30,500
Let's see...

439
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:33,750
Which one to pick?

440
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,125
I think I'll go
with this one!

441
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:40,291
Eris, are you sure?

442
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:41,416
Yes!

443
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,583
I couldn't part with these.

444
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,916
They're a treasured
gift from you, Kio.

445
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:49,500
I'm worn out.

446
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,458
The DVD is the
only prize left.

447
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:52,458
Yeah, last chance...

448
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:55,166
One of us has to win this.

449
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,833
All right... Let's move
on to the next game.

450
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:05,541
The next competitive
event is-

451
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:09,458
Strip Janken.

452
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:11,333
Out...! Safe...!

453
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:13,000
Ready, set, go!

454
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:14,416
Gah...!

455
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,958
This sucks,
I lost again!

456
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:17,583
Well, well...

457
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:19,375
Janken not your
game, Doctor?

458
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:21,916
How can anyone possibly be
good at a game of chance

459
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,458
that doesn't
require thinking?

460
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:24,708
You're wrong...

461
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:26,458
It requires lots
of thinking...

462
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:29,333
Like what tactic to use when
there are ties, for example.

463
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:30,833
You know...?

464
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,916
It's strange; all the games
of Earth seem to center

465
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,791
around the players having
to wager their clothes...

466
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:36,250
I imagine it's
an old tradition

467
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:38,125
from before
they used money.

468
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:39,125
All right...!

469
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:41,208
It's finally time
for naked Doctor!

470
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:42,458
Yeah!

471
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:44,750
Out...! Safe!

472
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:46,750
Ready, set, go!

473
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:49,291
Well... Did I win,
guys...? Tell me.

474
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:51,500
Yeah, yeah...
You won, you lucky punk...

475
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:53,291
Stop bragging.

476
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:56,041
Come on, do I really have
to take this off, too?

477
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:58,708
You sure do...!
It's the rules, after all.

478
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:00,833
This is so humiliating.

479
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:03,791
Kio's really good at this,
even with a blindfold!

480
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:04,916
Could be...

481
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,916
Or maybe it's because
of his blindfold

482
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
that he's having
so much success.

483
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:10,000
All right then...

484
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:11,291
Last round, people...

485
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:12,333
Let's go!

486
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:13,500
Yeah!

487
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:14,625
Out...

488
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:15,791
Safe...

489
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:17,708
Ready, set, go!

490
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,666
Good job, Kio,
you won that round, too!

491
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:28,000
How in the hell did
he beat us again?

492
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:29,958
Can't believe
I got shut out.

493
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:31,583
Disgraceful.
Honestly!

494
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:33,250
I'm such a loser.

495
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:35,791
The thrill of victory,
the agony of defeat...

496
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:38,291
Oh well... Time to get
rid of the cat ears!

497
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,625
No fair...
You can't do that!

498
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:42,083
One article
is one article.

499
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:43,833
Come on,
that's cheating!

500
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:47,250
Hey! You gotta complaint,
take it up with the rule book!

501
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:49,541
Oh no...! You're
getting naked, too!

502
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:50,916
Ah! Let me go!

503
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,833
Let go of My Lady
right this instant!

504
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:55,875
What the-...?
Guys, what's going on?

505
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:59,083
Hey...! Back off...!
Let her go!

506
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:25,666
Okay, then.

507
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:26,791
Last prize left;

508
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:29,208
to the victor
goes the spoils.

509
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:33,208
Well, here it is, Kio!

510
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:34,333
You have done well...

511
00:24:34,416 --> 00:24:35,791
So claim what's yours...

512
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:38,083
I now present you
with this pervy DVD...

513
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:40,000
Ta-da!

514
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,875
All is lost.

515
00:24:46,958 --> 00:24:49,291
Man, if Kio sees that,
we're toast.

516
00:24:49,375 --> 00:24:50,916
Here.

517
00:24:52,666 --> 00:24:54,125
You guys want
this movie, right?

518
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:56,833
Uh... Yeah, we do.

519
00:24:56,916 --> 00:24:58,500
You're sure...?
Really?

520
00:24:58,583 --> 00:24:59,875
Well of course.

521
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:02,000
After all, you two are
the stars, aren't you...?

522
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:05,500
I kinda figure you'd wanna be
the first people to see it.

523
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:07,500
Kio.

524
00:25:07,583 --> 00:25:09,250
That's so nice.

525
00:25:09,333 --> 00:25:10,500
Just promise me...

526
00:25:10,583 --> 00:25:12,875
you'll eventually let
me watch it with you.

527
00:25:17,166 --> 00:25:20,208
These crazy earth games
sure are a good time.

528
00:25:20,291 --> 00:25:22,083
It's the possibility
of losing...

529
00:25:22,166 --> 00:25:24,750
That's what makes the
competition so thrilling to us.

530
00:25:24,833 --> 00:25:26,416
Oh, My Lady...

531
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,958
You're growing
up so quickly.

532
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,583
But...

533
00:25:31,666 --> 00:25:34,958
Aoi and Manami's sleazy film
crisis was far from over.

534
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:44,500
It's time to unleash
the big guns!

535
00:25:44,583 --> 00:25:45,625
Okay!

536
00:25:45,708 --> 00:25:48,458
Take this, you freak!

537
00:25:50,208 --> 00:25:51,750
Roar...!

538
00:25:51,833 --> 00:25:53,375
Roar.

539
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,250
Roar!

540
00:25:58,333 --> 00:26:00,041
R-r-roar!

541
00:26:07,416 --> 00:26:09,333
The rockets,
they don't work...!

542
00:26:09,416 --> 00:26:11,458
What is that thing?!

543
00:26:11,541 --> 00:26:14,541
No choice, we have
to use our last resort!

544
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:18,458
Roar...!

545
00:26:18,541 --> 00:26:20,333
You're goin' down!

546
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,458
Wow...

547
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:26,833
I'd say they turned
out pretty cute, huh?!

548
00:26:26,916 --> 00:26:29,291
You could compliment our
amazing vocal performances,

549
00:26:29,375 --> 00:26:30,708
you jerk!

550
00:26:30,791 --> 00:26:32,083
You girls were awesome...

551
00:26:32,166 --> 00:26:34,166
Hey... Y'know...

552
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:37,041
You two should really consider
getting into voice-over.

553
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:38,583
We rock!

554
00:26:38,666 --> 00:26:40,958
In that case, do you think you
could get us some more work

555
00:26:41,041 --> 00:26:42,458
with the sci-fi
visionary who made this?

556
00:26:42,541 --> 00:26:44,583
Yeah, do you think this might
have a chance of getting

557
00:26:44,666 --> 00:26:46,416
into some film festivals?!

558
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,000
Ooh...! I hope so!

559
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:53,541
What is the sci-fi
world coming to?!

560
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,416
I'm bouncing!

561
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,666
Yeah, me too...!

562
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:28,666
I'm bouncing everywhere!

563
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,333
Hey! I--
I'm bouncing, too...!

564
00:28:30,416 --> 00:28:32,583
Look! I am!
