1
00:00:07,958 --> 00:00:08,958
The space vessel
Red Cat,,

2
00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:10,875
having traveled
many light years,...

3
00:00:10,958 --> 00:00:13,291
is now all alone,...
more or less.

4
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:15,333
The ship's Captain lies
soon-to-be-shipwrecked

5
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:16,833
and comatose.

6
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:18,958
The Acting Captain is Melwin,
who happened to survive...

7
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:20,625
And her partner is Luros,

8
00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:22,541
who's been turned
into a hologram.

9
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:25,125
And the Catian crew
who evolved from cats?

10
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:27,583
They'd have fun, fun, fun,
in the sun, sun, sun,...

11
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:30,166
if they weren't
frozen, that is.

12
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:21,458
Sweet Christmas!

13
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,500
They sure made a
mess-a-things, didn't they?

14
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:25,458
Uncle Yuichi...

15
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:27,333
Miss Itokazu.

16
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:30,166
What in the world
is going on here, Kakazu?

17
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:40,416
How about we go buy
him a new movie...?

18
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,250
And this time we'll make
sure to get a romantic one.

19
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:45,250
Something that'll lead
to lots of kissing

20
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:46,583
while you watch
it together...?

21
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,208
That's fine...

22
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:50,416
Christmas gifts aren't
really my thing anyway.

23
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,083
It's not that big a deal.

24
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,916
Aoi...

25
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,958
Really, don't
worry about it.

26
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:02,000
But if the mothership
crashes,...

27
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:04,041
what's gonna
happen to Earth?

28
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:06,250
It depends on the
velocity at impact,

29
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,291
but... more than likely,
given its size,

30
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:11,291
it would wipe out
your planet completely.

31
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:13,541
But there's no real
reason to be concerned...

32
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,708
The mothership will never
even make it out of orbit

33
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:17,583
because it's been
programmed to self-destruct.

34
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:18,583
Whoa.

35
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,166
Are you sure?

36
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,375
Large-scale spacecraft
are built with certain

37
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:23,708
precautionary fail-safes...

38
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:26,250
If a ship approaches
a planet without slowing...

39
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,791
The crystalline structure of
the hull will fragment itself...

40
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,083
And then,...

41
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:32,750
turn to vapor,
preventing any damage.

42
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,708
But wait,
what about the crew?

43
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:36,083
Under normal circumstances,

44
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:38,333
they would eject
in escape pods...

45
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:40,458
But in this case,
they're frozen in time...

46
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:43,166
There's no chance of survival.

47
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,000
The bridge is isolated in a
completely separate dimension,

48
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:48,541
so there's no need to worry
about an attack on us.

49
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:51,666
Hold on. Why can't ya just
change the ship's trajectory?

50
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,166
To do that-...

51
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,166
To do that we'd have to bring
the main systems down

52
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,541
and restart them...

53
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,416
And the only way that
would be possible is with

54
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,958
Captain Qoone's top-level,
secret command codes.

55
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,708
And the Acting
Captain can't do that?

56
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,333
The codes are
a part of her being...

57
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:07,541
Down to the cellular level.

58
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,875
Before the command
can be fully executed,

59
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:13,500
the Captain's genetic identity
must be officially verified.

60
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:16,375
Even though I've taken command
as the Secondary Officer...

61
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,291
As long as the
Captain is still living,

62
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:20,750
there's no way I'll be
able to do this for her.

63
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,250
Guess that explains

64
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:23,791
why they went to the trouble
of rendering her unconscious

65
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,458
instead of just killing her.

66
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:26,666
But, you guys...

67
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,458
You do realize if we
don't figure out a way

68
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:32,125
to rescue the rest of the crew,
then no one will.

69
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,458
If we can just find a practical
way to get into space,

70
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,875
then at the very least,
we'd have a fighting chance.

71
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,958
But with my personal
ship now destroyed...

72
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:41,500
Getting there doesn't
seem possible at all.

73
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,458
It's not like there's a good
way to get the Captain there,

74
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:44,958
anyways.

75
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:47,000
And even if there was,
she's unconscious,

76
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:49,250
so she can't really
order a restart...

77
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,541
Sorry, looks like
it's game over.

78
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:56,250
Look, Captain Qoone's bell!

79
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,791
What...? But-

80
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,416
Wait--Now that
I think of it...

81
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,666
As the Captain
was collapsing,

82
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,083
you were holding onto
her bell, weren't you?

83
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,291
Uh...

84
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:17,500
Did she say anything
when she gave it to you?

85
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:20,625
But not much; all she said
was "please take this."

86
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,666
Then that means...
as of this moment,

87
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,416
both the mothership's
crew and I...

88
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,708
are now serving under
your command, sir...!

89
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:32,750
Captain Kio Kakazu!

90
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,833
Wait, I'm the Captain?

91
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Goodness...

92
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,083
Yes, that's quite
the predicament...

93
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:47,916
Of course, you know I'll
gladly do whatever I can.

94
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,041
If it's for you, Miss Eris,
no matter what it is,

95
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:51,833
there's no limit
to what I'll do...

96
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,958
We'll speak again very soon.

97
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:56,416
Maya...!
It's shopping time!

98
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,750
Yes, of course...
But for what?

99
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,416
I want a rocket...

100
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,166
I want it now.

101
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,458
As you wish, My Lady.

102
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:06,750
I just spoke with Antonia,

103
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,833
and she volunteered
to buy us a rocket.

104
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:10,125
Seriously?

105
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:12,458
Must be nice being
a multimillionaire.

106
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:14,541
And now all we need is for
our newly appointed Captain

107
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,125
to give the official
restart order

108
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,458
and we can get ourselves
out of this mess.

109
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:21,083
But Eris, our rockets don't
have the ability to make it

110
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:22,458
into deep space
like yours do.

111
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:25,458
That's all right...
I still have Luros.

112
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:28,083
Hold on, I thought you said
your ship was destroyed.

113
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:30,458
Mostly, but it was only
the engine and outer hull...

114
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:32,375
Luros is tough;
it'll take more than that

115
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,291
to destroy
the central core.

116
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,541
The central core?

117
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,416
What's that?

118
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,541
It's Professor Jameson!

119
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,666
Professor Jameson
was a mechanical man

120
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,458
from old science
fiction stories

121
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:50,500
who looked pretty
much just like this.

122
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,166
I'm home!

123
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,666
It's Luros!

124
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,666
This is the core
I just mentioned...

125
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,375
If we can help get her up to
a standard satellite orbit...

126
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,291
Then, with a little help
from the Assistroids,...

127
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:02,500
she'll be able to construct
a simple warp engine

128
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:04,625
centered around herself.

129
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:06,500
After that, we can jump
to where the Mothership is,

130
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,750
no problem at all!

131
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,458
Yeah, but the crew...

132
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:12,250
Ya still haven't told us how
we're supposed to unfreeze 'em

133
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,375
and manage
an actual rescue.

134
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:17,750
Don't worry; I'm formulating
a plan about that now.

135
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,833
Well, there are certain
low-life individuals

136
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,000
who've been selling
technology

137
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,000
to illegal
traffickers, lately.

138
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,958
I'd say it's very
likely they used cards

139
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:30,625
purchased on
the Black Market...

140
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:33,333
So, here you go.

141
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:35,125
I bet those'll do the trick...

142
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,791
You'll be able to unfreeze
that frozen time, no problem.

143
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,000
This is perfect...

144
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,250
Thanks, Ichika.

145
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,125
Tell ya the truth,
I'd love to be able to tag

146
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:43,708
along with you guys...

147
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:46,666
But unfortunately, I've got
a lot going on, so I can't.

148
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,333
What, do you have a deadline?

149
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:49,833
Oh, you know me...

150
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:52,291
There's always something
important to do.

151
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,416
I would like to pay you
back for the cards...

152
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,791
I'll give you the
copyright license

153
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,208
to a D-I-Y Assistroid kit...

154
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:01,000
I can promise you this:
you won't be disappointed.

155
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,500
Can't we do better
than that...?

156
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:05,125
I don't know what we'd do
without these Accel Card things.

157
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,000
According to the Galactic
Sentient Federation,

158
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:10,000
copyright law violations
are a serious offense, Kio...

159
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:11,791
If we were caught
doing this,

160
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:14,583
the Orzonians would punish
us with a Thought Freeze.

161
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:17,125
Oh... That is serious.

162
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:19,708
Looks like all the pieces
are coming together, huh?

163
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,083
With a little luck, we might
actually pull this thing off.

164
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,291
I hope so...

165
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,041
As long as Antonia can
get us that rocket,

166
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:27,791
we should be in good shape.

167
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,125
This is bad!

168
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,500
Quick, turn on the TV!

169
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,625
Roughly four hours ago,

170
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:37,125
the Catian mothership
left its orbit around Jupiter

171
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:38,958
and started
to rapidly accelerate

172
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,916
to an extremely
dangerous speed.

173
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,333
Based on the observed
explosions,

174
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:44,291
it is presumed
to have lost control

175
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,458
after an unknown
accident...

176
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:49,000
Due to the lack of response
to our attempts to make contact,

177
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,333
we believe there
are no survivors.

178
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:53,791
If the ship continues along
its current trajectory,

179
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:56,250
it will collide with
Earth in two weeks.

180
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,083
It's predicted the impact
will be equivalent

181
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:02,375
to a several kiloton
nuclear explosion.

182
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,833
Hello...
This is Kio.

183
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:06,291
Oh, Kio,
I've got bad news.

184
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:07,458
We're in trouble...

185
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,041
I've been looking
for rockets everywhere,

186
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:10,833
but all of them
are booked up.

187
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:13,208
We have no way
to get into space!

188
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:15,000
Antonia says she's done
everything she can,

189
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:18,541
but she still
can't find one.

190
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,500
We've exerted our political
influence to the fullest,...

191
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:24,625
pressuring nations to mothball
their space-worthy rockets...

192
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:28,416
None of them would dare try
to intercept the Catian Ship.

193
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,041
See that, little kitties...?

194
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:33,625
Seems when the cats are away,
the dogs get to play.

195
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,916
What can we do?

196
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,875
We don't necessarily
need a rocket;

197
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:42,833
if we find a workable engine,
we can build everything else.

198
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,541
Sounds kinda risky,
are you sure?

199
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,083
Yes...
Once we have that,

200
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,708
Kio can construct
the rest of the rocket

201
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,416
with his newfound power.

202
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,375
Wait... That's nuts, I don't
know how to build a rocket!

203
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,750
Sure you do; just use
the multitasking organizer!

204
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:58,208
You can rearrange matter
at the molecular level,...

205
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:01,416
which gives you the ability
to create anything you want to!

206
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,416
You mean this?

207
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,708
Problem is,...

208
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,541
it won't work unless
you can precisely envision

209
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,041
what you're trying to make.

210
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:08,750
And there's simply
no way you're gonna know

211
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,750
all the intricate details
of a rocket engine

212
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,291
on a part-by-part level...

213
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:13,541
But I bet you
have an idea

214
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,500
what the fuselage
looks like, right?

215
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:16,666
My lady...

216
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,166
If all we need is
the engine--...

217
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,416
What, do you know of one?

218
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,791
I do...

219
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:23,666
It's in a chilly location,
but it is for sale.

220
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,375
Huh?!

221
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,708
How chilly?

222
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,083
Russia.

223
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:30,583
Huh?!

224
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,000
Cat Planet Cuties!

225
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,958
It's not working.

226
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:03,541
The main system
defenses are impeccable.

227
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:06,208
It's going to take a lot
more than that to hack in.

228
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:09,041
Looks like our only
choice is to rush 'em.

229
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,625
Unfortunately, I don't think
that'll be an option...

230
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:12,708
We're not gonna be able

231
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:14,916
to access the computer
room regardless.

232
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,291
Without the Captain here
to execute command codes,

233
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,958
nothing we do can alter
the ship's course.

234
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,208
Yeah, you're right...

235
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:26,125
Eris and the others are
doing everything they can.

236
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,041
All we can do now is wait
for them to get here

237
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,416
and try to back them up.

238
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,875
Right.

239
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,833
Oh gosh...!
.. I'm so... cold, Kio.

240
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:41,041
Well, it is below zero.

241
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,791
Hello, there...
I am General Arushkowa.

242
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:47,916
Long time no see, Mina.

243
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,708
Guess our kind just
don't know when to die...

244
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:50,958
Maya.

245
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:53,000
Guess not...
But all the same...

246
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,708
Thanks for your
help on this thing.

247
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,416
Yes, we appreciate
your kindness.

248
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,041
What is this place?

249
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,791
It's an underground,
rail-mobile missile base.

250
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:05,500
What's a
'rail-mobile missile'?

251
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:09,541
They're train-mounted ICBMs
with mobile launch sites.

252
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:10,958
They were built
to hide launches

253
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:12,916
from surveillance
satellites...

254
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,125
Strategic complexes
to prevent preemptive strikes.

255
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:20,041
Now, it's nothing but
a relic of a time gone by.

256
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,583
The warheads
have been removed,

257
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,500
but the rockets
still function.

258
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,250
What say you,
Miss Eris...?

259
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:26,416
Think it'll work?

260
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,125
Sure will...!
Thank you again very much!

261
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,583
Your asking
price is fair,

262
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,125
sounds like we're
in business...

263
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:34,166
We'll also provide you with
safe passage out of the country

264
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,166
if you require it.

265
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,541
You've got a deal...

266
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,166
I've been thinking it's
about time I get out of here

267
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,750
and see the big
bad world again.

268
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:45,125
Wow, we're actually
going to space in these.

269
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:47,250
Enough talk, people,
we'd better get to work...

270
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,833
If the dogs find out

271
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:50,666
we're here, they're sure to try
and throw a wrench in our plans.

272
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,250
While that's true...

273
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:53,833
We did leave those
body doubles

274
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:55,250
behind to keep
'em off our scent,

275
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,958
so we should be
okay for a while.

276
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:59,875
This is so not right!

277
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:02,166
Why should I, of all people,
have to wear this?

278
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,916
Eh, no one's gonna
even know it's us.

279
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,625
Besides, they say
most foreigners think

280
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:10,833
all Japanese people
look alike anyway, right?

281
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,708
Let's see...

282
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:16,958
There's the fuselage...

283
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:20,375
And then there's
the cockpit...

284
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:23,375
Wait, does a spaceship
need to have wings...?

285
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:26,000
Ah, might as well
include 'em for now...

286
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:35,583
Imagining a whole spaceship sure
takes a lot of concentration.

287
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:37,000
Hey, Kio, ya got a sec?

288
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,291
Manami, hey...

289
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,791
Yeah... Actually,
I was about to take a break

290
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,458
right before you came in...

291
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:43,833
What's up?

292
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:45,958
Truth is, I'm in the middle
of a real mess here...

293
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,625
And I wanted to ask
you something now,

294
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:48,625
while I still can.

295
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,291
Uh, what's that?

296
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,583
It's just... What exactly
do you plan to do?

297
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:55,416
Oh... Well, after I master
this mind trick thing,

298
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,958
I figure I better
build that rocket

299
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:57,958
so we don't
all die, right?

300
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,416
That's not
what I'm asking!

301
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,250
I mean about
Aoi and Eris!

302
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:02,625
Huh?

303
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,875
Aw cripes...

304
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,041
Do you know how Aoi
feels about you;

305
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,625
do you have any clue?

306
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:11,666
What do you mean?

307
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,041
Girls, for future reference,

308
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,166
do not risk their lives
and throw away their careers

309
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,000
for a boy they're
only interested in being

310
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:18,625
'just friends' with!

311
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:21,541
Think you can guess who they
would do that type of thing for?

312
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,958
Oh, you've got
to be kidding me!

313
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:27,416
Come on. A child
could answer this...

314
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,500
Are you really
that dim-witted?

315
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:31,041
Let's see, uh...

316
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,541
best friend?

317
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:35,541
Geez...!
Just think about it...!

318
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:36,541
Use your head!

319
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:37,791
Ow, Manami, okay!

320
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,916
Knock it off;
that hurts!

321
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,708
You don't have
to figure it out now, but...

322
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:48,000
After this crisis, you
will have to make a choice.

323
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:50,083
Think about
how she must feel.

324
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,291
Man, that's big...

325
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,375
"Think about Aoi,"
she says...?

326
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,250
Oh, there you are...

327
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,666
Hey.

328
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,250
What were
you thinking?

329
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:24,166
Wh-what do you mean?

330
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,958
Why would you ask Kio
something like that?

331
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:29,000
Well?!

332
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,375
Oh, that...

333
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:32,958
I don't know, it's just
Kio can be so dense...

334
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:35,750
Way things are going,
Christmas is gonna be ruined.

335
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,041
I had to do something,

336
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,875
otherwise he'll never
come around to you.

337
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:40,583
No one asked you
for your help...!

338
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:43,000
Do you realize the severity
of the situation we're in?

339
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,666
Well of course,
but I thought-...

340
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,083
You didn't think...!
We're about to get launched

341
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:48,750
into space for
crying out loud...!

342
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,750
And there's no telling
what'll happen up there!

343
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,208
Yeah... I know.

344
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:54,375
But you bring that up now.

345
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:57,208
Kio needs to focus
on the task at hand...

346
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,833
I don't wanna cloud
his judgment...

347
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,291
What if he gets hurt, huh?

348
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,958
Then what?

349
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:05,083
You should think things
through a little more!

350
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,333
Maybe so...

351
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:09,250
But what about you, Aoi?

352
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:10,791
We're in a situation
where we don't know

353
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,208
what's gonna happen...

354
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:13,916
What if it's the worst
case scenario...?

355
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,166
Are you sure you can live

356
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,750
without getting
an answer from him?

357
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,708
And what if we succeed...?

358
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,916
Maybe Eris and Kio
will become closer

359
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
than they ever
have been...

360
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,166
I know you feel I'm meddling
in your business...

361
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,375
But...! How would
that make you feel?

362
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:33,250
Having everything end
without him knowing the truth?

363
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:36,500
How would that
make you feel?

364
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:38,125
Because, Manami...

365
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:41,916
I know that you're
in love with him, too.

366
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,625
Come on, you don't really
think I'm stupid...

367
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:47,625
You can't tell me
you're okay with him

368
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:49,458
not knowing how you feel...

369
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:52,000
Never getting
a final answer...

370
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:55,041
Won't you be sad if it ends
before it ever began?

371
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:01,208
You don't know how to tell him
the truth either, do you...?

372
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:03,708
Sometimes it's okay
to be selfish...

373
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:05,625
But pushing your fears
on someone else

374
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:07,125
instead of facing them...?

375
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:10,083
You're not helping,
you're being a hypocrite!

376
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:27,583
Intruders...!
All units, alert status!

377
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:28,666
They're spies!

378
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,125
That's impossible!

379
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:32,625
Take the left!
I'll go right!

380
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:34,000
Got it!

381
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,916
Let him go!

382
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,166
Aoi, careful!

383
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,375
Don't move.

384
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,541
I've littered this whole
complex with bombs!

385
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,166
Wait a minute...

386
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,500
You lived...
My mistake.

387
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:58,750
So it's you...

388
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,916
That assassin from before...

389
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,666
I wouldn't throw
stones if I were you.

390
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,958
Back off!

391
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,083
You an' I are nothing
alike, girly...

392
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,208
You don't fight
for a cause or a country;

393
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:10,791
you're just
a ruthless killer.

394
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:11,958
I have a cause.

395
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,250
Oh, please...

396
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:16,708
Is it worth dying for?

397
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:18,625
You serve a country
you don't love...

398
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,458
You protect a planet
you know nothing about...

399
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,583
Makes you no more
than a mercenary...

400
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:26,166
Killer for hire.

401
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,875
Don't listen to him!

402
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:29,625
Lose the weapon!

403
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:32,666
But do it slow, I know
all about your power...

404
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:36,458
Any funny business
and the kid gets it!

405
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:37,458
Do it!

406
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:39,041
Yeah, do it!

407
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:55,541
You can thank
Catia for that!

408
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,625
They think death is the
abandonment of potential...

409
00:18:57,708 --> 00:19:00,708
Their weapons don't kill.

410
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:02,375
There you are!

411
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:05,000
Restrain that man,
right now!

412
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,625
Thank goodness
we found you... You okay?

413
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:10,166
I'm fine.

414
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,208
Aoi...
Thank you...

415
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,000
You saved me.

416
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,041
Damn... I'm sorry.

417
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,833
I had no idea an enemy
had infiltrated my ranks.

418
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,541
The only enemy here is you,.

419
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:27,333
filthy traitor!

420
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,458
This base is property
of the motherland...

421
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,625
Selling it off on your
own is high treason!

422
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:33,083
Turncoat!

423
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:34,958
Miss Eris,
we've got a problem!

424
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:38,833
NATO forces are on their
way here right now!

425
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:41,333
Two NATO tank battalions
that were out on maneuvers

426
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:43,541
have steered in this direction
and are on the move...

427
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:45,208
They're closing fast.

428
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,791
According to the intelligence
reports I received,.

429
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:50,041
they've been ordered
to destroy a missile base

430
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:52,583
that's been taken over
by a terrorist cell.

431
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,083
Don't they realize...

432
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:55,916
that we're trying
to save the world here?

433
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,416
They should arrive roughly
three hours from now.

434
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,791
We're short on time,
we better move.

435
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,708
That's nowhere near enough...

436
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:05,458
Doesn't even give us
time to fuel it up.

437
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,541
Ready, Kio?

438
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,875
I did it!

439
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:12,291
Nice one, Kio!

440
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:13,291
Thanks...

441
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:15,708
Holy crap...
I can't believe it!

442
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:18,208
It's purr-fect!
You did great!

443
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:20,875
The design's totally retro,
don't you think?

444
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:23,750
Yeah, I bet Miss Itokazu
would totally love it!

445
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:30,875
They're coming...!
We're out of time!

446
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,583
Everyone get ready
for take-off...

447
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,125
Leave the rest to us.

448
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:35,541
That's right, Miss Eris...

449
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:37,750
They won't come between
our kitty-eared friendship...

450
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:40,166
My girls and I will handle
everything down here.

451
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,875
Right... I can't thank
you ladies enough!

452
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:44,416
Now go...
Quickly, everyone.

453
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,666
Right!

454
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,375
It's time
to release the hounds.

455
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,916
And so, overwhelmed
with emotions,

456
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,916
the youngsters
board the rocket...

457
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,458
Feelings shared,...

458
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:57,083
and feelings unrequited...

459
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:59,625
As each of them bears
their own confusion,

460
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:01,583
they head off to battle.

461
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:04,000
But what will
the outcome be?

462
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:42,125
Kio and the gang
rocket off to space

463
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:44,458
to stop the plummeting
Catian mothership!

464
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:47,000
Will the dogs have their day,
or will Kio and the girls

465
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:48,750
put them back
in the dog house?

466
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:51,375
Next time...!
"I Came to Find You!"

467
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:54,125
I'm coming
to drop in on you!
