1
00:00:07,791 --> 00:00:09,458
The year is 2010...

2
00:00:09,541 --> 00:00:12,125
Catia has established
an Earth Defense Squad...

3
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:15,291
whose secret headquarters is a
certain residence in Okinawa.

4
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:18,333
An elite team consisting of
the best minds in the universe

5
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:20,250
has assembled to
defend the planet,...

6
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:23,041
under level-headed
Supreme Commander Eris.

7
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:25,583
Their enemy: the hostile
Dogishuans and their rabid,

8
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:27,000
roving robots.

9
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:29,083
Through courage,
technology, and teamwork,

10
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:30,875
the Earth Defense
Squad stands ready

11
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:33,708
to send this enemy
to the pound.

12
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:12,958
A plan long in the works was
finally coming to fruition.

13
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,333
And fire!

14
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:38,583
Wow...!
It's all so pretty!

15
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,791
They always decorate
at Christmas time.

16
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,833
Christmastime!
I've read about that.

17
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:46,125
It's an annual religious holiday
celebrated here on Earth.

18
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,333
Well, sorta, but it's
kinda gone beyond that.

19
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:49,958
Oh, how do you mean?

20
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:51,708
Lots of different
people celebrate it...

21
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:53,625
Not just believers,
but also people

22
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,208
who see it as a tradition...

23
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:56,791
Like, here in Japan,
it's more of a festival

24
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:58,958
full of gifts
and surprises.

25
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:03,083
Speaking of Christmas
surprises,...

26
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:04,750
what've you got
in mind for him?

27
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:06,166
Wait, "him" who?

28
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,208
Kio...

29
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:08,833
You've got something
planned, right?

30
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:10,083
Wait, whaa--?

31
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:12,166
Earth to Aoi, it's Christmas!

32
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,291
This is the perfect chance
for you to earn some points

33
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:15,833
by getting him
something special,...

34
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:18,291
and asking him on a date.

35
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:19,416
I don't know.

36
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,000
He seems pretty
busy these days.

37
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,416
If you don't
make a move soon,

38
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,416
the only thing he's going
to be getting busy with...

39
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,625
is Eris.

40
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:29,250
Look, four months have passed
and those two are still only

41
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,458
in the friend zone.

42
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,041
But there's still a
chance for a turnover,

43
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:34,958
and the game's right
back in your favor.

44
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,958
But the clock is running out,
so you've gotta strike quick,

45
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,708
before it's too late.

46
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,875
I don't like to think
of it as "striking"...

47
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:42,208
And to be honest,
I'd rather wait

48
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,291
until I feel
the time is right.

49
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:46,666
Ugh...! Let me
spell it out for you:

50
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,833
It's Christmas, Aoi.

51
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:49,458
The time is never
gonna be more right...

52
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:51,791
But that's kind of a
double-edged sword...

53
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,625
She has just as
much opportunity

54
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:56,541
to get closer
to him as you do!

55
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:57,833
So get his attention...!

56
00:03:57,916 --> 00:03:59,708
You've gotta close
the deal with Kio now,

57
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:02,750
before Eris takes the
same chance and wins!

58
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:04,458
Uhh, do you think...

59
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,083
he'd choose Eris?

60
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:07,833
Not if you get to him first.

61
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:10,375
Eris's next mating season
is a little ways off,

62
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,958
but we humans don't have
those limitations...

63
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:14,708
So go on--get some!

64
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,208
Yet, but...

65
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,500
Um... You do
like him, don't you?

66
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:19,666
Uh...!
Well I mean--...!

67
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,916
Aoi!

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,333
Hey, come here...!

69
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:25,791
Listen!
Aoi, I want you--!

70
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,083
Moron! You couldn't have
a picked a better place

71
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:31,708
to tell her
than the mall...?!

72
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,541
Maybe when you two
were alone together...?

73
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,125
Like someplace
more romantic?!

74
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,458
Huh...?!

75
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:38,458
What the heck are you
talking about, Manami...?!

76
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,416
I just wanted her to come
check out this sale

77
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,750
on Ichikawa Raizen
DVDs over there...

78
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,291
'Cause like, I know
she's a really big fan.

79
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:45,958
Huh?

80
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,125
Oh, what a touching
Earth movie!

81
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:00,375
Well, personally,

82
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,291
I though it got a little
too maudlin at times...

83
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,416
But to be honest, I did
get a little teary-eyed

84
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,666
when the man found
the petals in his pocket.

85
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,083
This Christmas thing must be
a pretty big deal to Earthlings

86
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,250
since they've made so
many movies about it...

87
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,250
I've been doing some
research on the holiday,

88
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,500
and it was originally held
to commemorate the birth

89
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:18,000
of the founder of one of
Earth's three great religions...

90
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,041
Now however...

91
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:20,583
its meaning has expanded...

92
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,375
mainly centering on
tidings of goodwill

93
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:23,916
and exchanging of gifts.

94
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,375
Oh, on that subject...

95
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,708
I informed Catia of
this Earth tradition...

96
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:29,708
And the powers-that-be
passed a resolution

97
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:31,791
asking us to exchange
a gift with the Earthlings

98
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:35,166
as a token of friendship.

99
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,666
Seasonal gift-giving and
voluntary acts of goodwill

100
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,375
are symbolized on Earth
by "Santa Claus,"

101
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:43,375
a mythical figure steeped
in the local folklore...

102
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,833
As a result, I would like
to call our gift-giving program,

103
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:48,416
"Operation Santa Claus,"
in his honor.

104
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,041
I want to put it into
motion immediately.

105
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:55,333
Captain...! I'm picking
up multiple objects

106
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:57,125
approaching the
mothership at high speed!

107
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:59,125
All hands,
go to alert status...!

108
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,541
Scanner data onscreen!

109
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:04,125
They appear to be artificial
Earth satellites, Captain...

110
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:06,375
A buncha scrap past
its service life.

111
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:09,416
Those mangy mutts probably
sent them to harass us.

112
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,291
Prepare to fire
phasers, Melwin...

113
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:14,333
We'll scratch them
off like fleas!

114
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:15,916
Phasers ready.

115
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,500
Fire!

116
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,000
Direct hit, Captain...

117
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:34,291
Targets destroyed...

118
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:35,833
Looks like we got 'em...

119
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:38,625
According to scans, there're
no signs of movement or energy.

120
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:39,875
Those idiots...

121
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:42,541
I guess the dogs must be
all bark and no bite...

122
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:43,916
Our hull is made
out of tilsonite

123
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,583
and reinforced tektite...

124
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:47,416
Did they honestly think
a little space trash

125
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,791
would do anything?

126
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,833
Well, since they can't
officially launch an attack,

127
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:52,333
I guess that's all
they could do.

128
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:53,791
You're right, Doctor;

129
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:56,083
after all, the Dog-ishuans
aren't legally allowed

130
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,666
to be in this or
any other system...

131
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,375
That's why the attacks they
launch are dug under-the- fence.

132
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,041
Mongrels...

133
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:04,958
They need a newspaper taken to
them to teach them a lesson...

134
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,625
Stand down from
alert status...

135
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:08,458
But continue observation.

136
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,041
Acknowledged.

137
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:12,375
Oh, could you please
put a ribbon on it?

138
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:13,791
One of our Christmas
ribbons, miss?

139
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,583
Yes.

140
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:27,000
This is the perfect chance
for you to earn some points

141
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:29,625
by getting him
something special.

142
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:31,458
Can I do that?

143
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:32,750
Have any points?

144
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:35,333
No, I haven't earned
any points with him yet!

145
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:37,875
Uh... I meant points
with your shopper's card...

146
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,916
Should I check
if you have any?

147
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,458
Yes, please.
Thank you.

148
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,541
Transmission from
the home world.

149
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:50,458
This is the Santa
Claus time schedule.

150
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:51,666
That gives us
plenty of time

151
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,791
to complete the
gift by Christmas...

152
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:54,791
Melwin...

153
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,625
calculate our
entry trajectory

154
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,291
and synchronous
orbital velocity...

155
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:00,125
Aye, Captain.

156
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,166
I have to attend a social
function I've been invited to

157
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,625
at our Earth embassy...

158
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:04,958
Do you think you can
handle the conn

159
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:06,291
while I'm planetside?

160
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:09,250
Then you want... me to serve
as acting captain?

161
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:12,041
You're ready for that
responsibility, right?

162
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,375
Yes...!
I'm honored!

163
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:15,000
Doctor...
Yes...? .

164
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:16,750
The item?
It's all ready for you.

165
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,125
You can take
it to Earth.

166
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,791
Yeah um,
what item is that?

167
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,500
If you must know, Chayka,

168
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,750
it's an early Christmas
present for Kio...

169
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,708
He's treating me to
a special gift tonight,

170
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:28,041
so it's only fair
that I do the same.

171
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,166
This is the cat's pajamas!

172
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,125
The meat's
incredibly tender...!

173
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,166
And I love how the teriyaki
sauce and the grease

174
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,791
from the meat give the
rice such a tasty flavor...!

175
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,500
This is one
delectable dish

176
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:44,625
that makes me purr with
excitement every bite I take!

177
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:50,583
I could eat this the rest
of my life and be happy...!

178
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,958
I'm in love with
this "yaki-niku"!

179
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:55,833
You've outdone yourselves!

180
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:57,291
Glad you like it,

181
00:08:57,375 --> 00:09:01,166
but really all the credit
goes to these guys.

182
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,458
It's not the easiest
dish to prepare...

183
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,208
Marinating, cooking,
and stewing the meat

184
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:07,000
takes a lot of time
and trouble...

185
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:09,083
But they've mastered
the recipe, Captain.

186
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,625
Kudos to you all...!
Excellent cuisine...!

187
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,041
Thanks to your efforts,

188
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:15,625
the mothership can now enjoy
tasty Earth food...!

189
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,041
It sounds like
the Assistroids

190
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,541
have been a huge
help in that area!

191
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:19,916
They have!

192
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,750
Hey, yeah, speaking
of Assistroids,

193
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,916
it doesn't look like you brought
one with you on this trip.

194
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,291
Actually, I did bring one.

195
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,541
It's contained
inside of my bell.

196
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:29,875
Huh?

197
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:31,791
Bells like the ones that
Chayka and I wear

198
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:34,916
just indicate rank and serve
as communication devices...

199
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,625
But the ones worn
by senior officers

200
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:39,375
serve as multitasking
organizers.

201
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:42,208
Multitasking organizers?

202
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:43,541
Yes, it allows me

203
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,083
to transmogrify the atomic
composition of matter,

204
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:48,833
even the air, into shapes
and sizes of my choosing...

205
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:50,833
And of course,
it is also a weapon.

206
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,750
Wow, your tech is awesome.

207
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,041
Oh, right...

208
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,166
You just reminded me...

209
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,041
Let's see...

210
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:02,416
Ah, yes.

211
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,875
Here... I wanted
to give this to you.

212
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:11,541
What is it?

213
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,291
A little early
Christmas present...

214
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,958
You've mentioned you wanted
some emergency gear...

215
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:18,791
It's your own
Combat Power Suit.

216
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,583
Thank you, Captain Qoone!

217
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,208
There's a bit of
a trick to using it,

218
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,500
so get Eris to show you
the ins and outs later.

219
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,083
Cool!

220
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,000
You don't sound
happy about this.

221
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,375
No, actually
I'm a little sad.

222
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:33,666
Why?

223
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,166
Because you
shouldn't need it.

224
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,791
You should let me
protect you instead.

225
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:39,708
But that's why I need it...

226
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:42,750
I can't let you
keep doing that.

227
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:45,625
Every time something happens,
you, Manami, or Aoi

228
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:46,750
risk yourselves for me...

229
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,833
It makes me feel useless...

230
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:51,041
A man should protect
women... You know?

231
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,041
To be honest,
I don't fully understand

232
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,666
the emphasis
Earth males place

233
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,958
on this concept
they call chivalry...

234
00:10:57,041 --> 00:11:00,541
But it is very sweet of
you to feel that way, Kio.

235
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:03,125
My Christmas wish is that
you'll never have to use it...

236
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:05,375
that our worlds live
together in harmony.

237
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:06,875
Well to accomplish that,...

238
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,208
let's keep our
diplomatic efforts up...

239
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:11,541
Once we finalize formal
relations with Earth...

240
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,750
there'll be no reason for Kio
to have to use equipment

241
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,291
like this, right?

242
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,916
Right!

243
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:21,375
The time has come.

244
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:22,500
What do you think...

245
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:24,125
Matrey?

246
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:29,250
As of right now,
we move to stage two...

247
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,333
Send the command out
to your little pals...

248
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:34,000
Sic 'em on the cats.

249
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,041
Cat Planet Cuties!

250
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:06,375
Manami?

251
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,083
Aoi...

252
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:10,083
I'll be right down.

253
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:17,125
So... What did you
get Kio for Christmas?

254
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,958
Oh, I found all of the
"Bantohan to Dechidon" movies...

255
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,666
The DVD box set.

256
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,875
Huh...?
What is that?

257
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:26,000
They're films based
on an old TV show...

258
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,791
Kio mentioned he liked
the lead actor...

259
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,208
I had a hard time deciding,

260
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,333
but I think this is the
perfect gift for him.

261
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:33,625
Yeah, I don't understand
this weird interest

262
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:36,125
you have in old movies,
so I can let that slide...

263
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:37,708
But if you had to get a DVD,

264
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,916
you should've at least
gotten something romantic!

265
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,791
I don't think he likes those.

266
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,291
Well, maybe he'd learn to...!

267
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,708
And maybe it'd inspire
you to kiss the guy!

268
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:47,541
K-- Kiss him?!

269
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,208
I dunno, something
like that...

270
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:50,958
it shouldn't
really be rushed...

271
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:52,875
Are you sure now's
the right time...?

272
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:55,333
We've been through this;
now is the perfect time...!

273
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:56,875
Christmas, Aoi...!

274
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,250
It's a time
of miracles...!

275
00:12:58,333 --> 00:12:59,416
So get to it!

276
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,666
Well, yeah...

277
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,708
But I was thinking...

278
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,083
maybe Valentine's Day...?

279
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:04,666
Are you nuts...?!

280
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:08,666
If you wait that long, Eris'll
totally beat you to the punch!

281
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,750
Yes, but...

282
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,000
Right now...

283
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,750
I'm kinda happy with
things the way they are.

284
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,375
Getting to be with Kio...

285
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:18,000
Even if it's only
just as a friend...

286
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:19,666
Well, for the time being...

287
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,833
That's good enough for me.

288
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,833
Stop it.

289
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,583
It's real easy for
you to say that...

290
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:27,500
But you're full of crap.

291
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,375
Manami...

292
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:30,833
Please, Aoi...

293
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:33,250
If you wait,, you're gonna
lose your shot at Kio...

294
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:34,666
Trust me on this...

295
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:38,541
Don't wait,, You'll end up
regretting that decision.

296
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:41,125
Make sure that
doesn't happen...

297
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,958
If your feelings
for Kio are true...

298
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:48,083
You can't wait; you
have to act on them now.

299
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,041
Because if you don't...

300
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:52,875
He'll leave you
behind like he did-...

301
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,708
Like he did-...

302
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,125
Like he did-...

303
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,083
Apport!

304
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,250
What the heck
is going on?!

305
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:48,041
Guys!
Defensive positions!

306
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,208
Wait, what's wrong with you?

307
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,291
As I thought; they're
using nephelter gas...!

308
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,041
I bet it's blocking
their sensors!

309
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,250
All units!
Standby mode!

310
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,833
Crap!

311
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,291
Let's get out
through the back!

312
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:07,458
No, they're
covering that, too!

313
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,291
What about my power suit?!

314
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,875
It hasn't been initialized
yet, so you can't use it!

315
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,541
Let's get to higher ground!

316
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:14,708
Gotcha!

317
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,250
Hurry!

318
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:30,500
The external hull
has been breached!

319
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:33,041
We're under attack
by multiple hostiles!

320
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:35,166
I'm declaring a
Level-3 Emergency...!

321
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,041
Give me a status
report right now...!

322
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,708
I wanna know
who's attacking us!

323
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,041
We've been boarded!

324
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,750
I'm reading six hostiles...!
No, make that seven!

325
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:45,250
They're Dogishuan
Assistroids!

326
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:52,791
Send in security
forces...!

327
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,958
Armament Level 3,
no make it 4...!

328
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,500
Deploy our Assistroids
to back 'em up!

329
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:57,875
Aye-aye!

330
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,458
And lock down the bridge!

331
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,583
Roger that...!
Space-time secured.

332
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,958
System physical
separation: complete...

333
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:07,083
Short-term hyperspace
systems: all green!

334
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:11,041
All hands...!
Maintain your positions!

335
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:13,083
Stay alert and
keep focused...!

336
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:16,208
Let the security forces
handle the counterattack!

337
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:19,041
The dogs... How did
they sneak up on us?

338
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,541
Since we didn't pick up
energy signatures

339
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:21,541
from any spacecraft...

340
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,291
I don't know.

341
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:52,583
And fire!

342
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:53,833
Unless they were...

343
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:56,666
hiding in that
cosmic debris?

344
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,666
They sacrificed their
Assistroids...?

345
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:11,541
Used them as no more than
disposable weapons?

346
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:14,458
Have they no respect at all
for their mechanical lives?!

347
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,958
What the?!

348
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:34,583
Masks on...!
They're using gas!

349
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,791
Come on!

350
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:25,875
Captain Qoone!

351
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,958
No! What happened?!

352
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,041
Why you-...!

353
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:15,375
Are you okay?

354
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,500
Kio...

355
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:18,583
Please...

356
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:22,291
take this...

357
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:25,541
Eris! The Captain's
unconscious!

358
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:28,666
Captain...!
Say something, please!

359
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,250
Use your medical gizmo!

360
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,083
Right!

361
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:39,625
Thank goodness...!
She's alive!

362
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:40,875
Oh good...

363
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:42,958
So that means you
can treat her...?

364
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,208
What's the matter?

365
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:45,291
It's no use...

366
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:46,750
There's nanobots inside her.

367
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:48,000
What?

368
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:50,333
That's what was injected
into her brain...

369
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:52,958
They're not drugs, they're
microscopic machines,...

370
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:55,000
blocking her
neurotransmitters...

371
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,250
If I use this on them,

372
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,958
there's no telling
how they might react.

373
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,708
Captain, we have an
emergency...!

374
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:06,791
Where's Captain Qoone?!

375
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:07,833
Well...

376
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,000
Oh no...!
What happened to her?!

377
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:13,250
We were attacked
by Dogishuans.

378
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:14,541
You, too?

379
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,291
So they ambushed
us from all sides.

380
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:18,000
Yes, and as
a result of that,

381
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,833
the mothership is no
longer under our control.

382
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:20,875
What?!

383
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,250
If we don't do something,

384
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:24,958
it'll crash into the
Earth in two weeks.

385
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,333
Wait, what's
going on up there?

386
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,916
We don't exactly know how
the dogs managed to do it,

387
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,708
but... except
for the bridge--

388
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,625
which was able to flee
into hyperspace--

389
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:38,333
the rest of the crew is in a
state of suspended animation,

390
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:39,750
like they were
frozen in time.

391
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,750
They're frozen in time?

392
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:44,166
I didn't realize the dogs
had that kind of technology

393
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,458
at their disposal...

394
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:47,583
The mothership's orbit
is locked in, though...

395
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:49,583
And there's no one onboard
who's able to change it.

396
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:50,750
I'm coming to get you.

397
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,541
Is the teleporter online?

398
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:53,625
Negative...

399
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:55,208
All facilities
outside of the bridge

400
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:57,000
have fallen under
enemy control.

401
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,083
Well, in that case...

402
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:01,166
I'll just call Luros!

403
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,625
Emergency, Miss Eris.

404
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:03,958
I've got terrible news!

405
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,833
What is it, Luros?!

406
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:07,333
The ship is under attack!

407
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:11,500
It's all pow-pow and bang-bang
and boom-boom right now!

408
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:12,833
Damage report?

409
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,833
Twenty-five percent of
the ship's been affected,

410
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:16,750
and the camouflage
mode's offline!

411
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:18,375
Bet I can guess who...

412
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:20,833
Those flea-bitten mutts!

413
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:38,083
Oh, no, Miss Eris, the
shields are almost gone...

414
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:40,416
And the engine is losing
power at a rapid rate, too.

415
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,666
Luros...

416
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:44,208
Initiate Program
"He," number thirty-six!

417
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:45,416
Okey-dokey, Miss Eris!

418
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,666
Initiating Pro--

419
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,958
Luros...! Come in!

420
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:52,750
Luros...!
Are you there?!

421
00:21:56,916 --> 00:22:00,000
The Catian mothership
is frozen in time,...

422
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,458
with those aboard
unable to escape.

423
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:05,333
Captain Qoone is
lying unconscious...

424
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:07,875
And in just two weeks,
the ship will come crashing

425
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:09,416
into our planet.

426
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,833
What will you do, Earth?

427
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:02,416
Kio and his friends will go
to the ends of the Earth

428
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,916
to stop the mothership
from crashing,

429
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,500
so they're off to Russia!

430
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:07,500
Brr! You guys
better brings coats,

431
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:09,208
and watch out for
saboteurs, 'kay?

432
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:11,750
Next time:
"I Came Looking for You."

433
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:14,541
I'm coming to
drop in on you!
