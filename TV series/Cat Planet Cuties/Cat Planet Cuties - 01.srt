1
00:00:08,125 --> 00:00:09,458
She came to visit
from far away,

2
00:00:09,541 --> 00:00:12,166
in search of new friends
and experiences.

3
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:13,708
Yeah, but nothing
concrete yet.

4
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:15,375
...have been receiving
for the last six months.

5
00:00:15,458 --> 00:00:16,750
Sure, Jack.

6
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:18,916
If I find anything out,
you'll be the first to know.

7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,125
A message from the
depths of outer space

8
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:24,250
might sound like something
straight out of a B-movie.

9
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:26,166
But an investigation
by the SDF,

10
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,541
The Ministry of Internal Affairs
and Communications, and ITU-R,

11
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:32,000
the International
Telecommunication Union,

12
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:34,041
has verified
that space is exactly

13
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:35,791
where the message
originated from.

14
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:38,625
Relayed around the world in
several different languages,

15
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:40,083
this message
has been confirmed

16
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:42,041
to have the same
meaning in each one:

17
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,250
"I'm going to drop by."

18
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:46,666
All right!
Next up! Let 'er rip!

19
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,750
Good.
You're ready?

20
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:50,583
What are you doing?

21
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:52,291
That Browning Nine
millimeter you're holding

22
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:54,416
is a surprisingly
cumbersome pistol.

23
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,500
I hear that if you do this,

24
00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:58,458
it becomes temporarily
unable to fire.

25
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:10,625
They're shooting at us;
your orders, captain?

26
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:12,791
Fire a warning
shot across their bow

27
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:14,458
and then order them
to shut down their engines

28
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:16,000
and surrender immediately!

29
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:17,916
They're launching
rockets at us!

30
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:22,291
I'm moving out.

31
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:23,291
Not yet.

32
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,500
People will
die if I don't.

33
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:26,125
That won't
change if you go.

34
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:28,083
I know, but it will
change who dies.

35
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:29,291
Wait for orders!

36
00:01:29,375 --> 00:01:31,375
Activate System 7.

37
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:56,125
Momiji! Wait!

38
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:12,291
Equip S-1!

39
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:20,583
What the?

40
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:22,000
Stop!

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,250
Their cargo's weapons
and illegal drugs.

42
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:40,875
No one's aboard
but the crew.

43
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:42,041
It's a covert ops ship.

44
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:43,625
Take control of it.

45
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:44,958
Roger that.

46
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:47,208
Now aren't you glad I
insisted on coming aboard?

47
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:49,041
Equip K.

48
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:03,833
There's nowhere to run.

49
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:05,666
Surrender!

50
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,125
Trust me,
that won't work!

51
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:12,708
Apport!

52
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:17,958
I said it wouldn't work.

53
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:24,083
What was that?

54
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,708
A UFO!

55
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:27,583
What the hell's
going on?

56
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,416
No, don't!

57
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:09,625
Lots of military
jets today.

58
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,333
Hope you got the party
favors I asked for, Kio.

59
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,458
Uncle Yuichi.

60
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:15,458
Here.

61
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:16,958
Thanks!

62
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:20,458
Um, no offense but, should
you really be drinking today?

63
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,125
AHH!

64
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:24,333
We're celebrating
the anniversary

65
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,000
of our great-great
grandfather's death,

66
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:28,333
and if you just grieve,
they can't cross over.

67
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:31,375
C'mon, grab a brew and drink
to the departed old dude!

68
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,458
Uh, no thanks,
I'm underage.

69
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:34,541
Ah, who cares?

70
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:35,958
You're in high school
now, aren't you?

71
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,166
Yeah, but.

72
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,166
Got a girlfriend?

73
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,958
No, I don't,
at least not yet.

74
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:42,625
Get with it kid!

75
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:45,333
These are your golden years
and you're wasting them.

76
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:48,041
There's nothing like
your first girlfriend.

77
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:50,875
So come on, Kio, we're
gonna go get you one, 'kay!

78
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,125
Right here and now!

79
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,500
No, wait a minute!

80
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,166
Uh-uh, you've waited
long enough now,

81
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,000
so it's time to bag
you a babe.

82
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:58,000
What about that one?

83
00:04:58,083 --> 00:04:59,708
She's pretty nice.

84
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:00,708
Check her out.

85
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:03,125
Smoking hot figure,
cute face,

86
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,166
and look
at those ears.

87
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,166
What the?

88
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,375
No kidding.
So did I.

89
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,000
A tail?

90
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,166
Well, hey, little lady,

91
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,250
can I offer you a
refill on your drink?

92
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:17,291
Yes! Thank you for
the tasty beverage, sir!

93
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:20,666
Uncle Yuichi, stop,
what are you doing?

94
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,666
Are you nuts?

95
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,833
You can't give
alcohol to minors!

96
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:26,541
You look underage, so I can't
let you have this, 'kay?

97
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,833
That's fine. I'm very
happy with these dishes.

98
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:30,916
They're all so tasty.

99
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,500
Such as this one here.

100
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,958
By what term do you
call this again?

101
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:36,541
It's so delicious!

102
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,500
Oh, that's Taro Dengaku.

103
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,333
I've never dined
on it before today,

104
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:41,541
but I just love it!

105
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:42,666
Like those kelp wraps.

106
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,541
And that rafute!

107
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:45,625
So soft and tender!

108
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:47,708
Oh, they really
get me purring!

109
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:49,083
They're the cat's meow!

110
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,416
So then I guess.

111
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,541
You've never had
Okinawan cuisine before?

112
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,166
Nope! But I'm
glad I have now

113
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,000
because it's been so long
since I've eaten anything!

114
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,500
Why's that?

115
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,166
I forgot to load
food onto my ship,

116
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,500
so when I finally arrived,
I was starving.

117
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,666
Luckily, I met a cat
named Aura near the beach

118
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,166
and she told me
if I came here,

119
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,958
there'd be good food
and nice people.

120
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:09,500
Boy, was she right!

121
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,458
She was a real lifesaver.

122
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:13,666
That's funny, I actually
have a cat named Aura.

123
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,791
Well, at least I used to,

124
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,458
until she ran away
from home recently.

125
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:21,916
Pleased to meet you;
my name is Eris.

126
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:26,083
Oh. Likewise!

127
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:28,208
My name's Kio Kakazu. Uh...

128
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:37,375
Is something the matter?

129
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:38,375
Um.

130
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:39,500
No.

131
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,250
Everything's great!

132
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:46,708
This is beer.

133
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,000
What the...

134
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm home?

135
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:02,666
What happened to
the commemoration?

136
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,000
The last thing I seem
to remember is being there

137
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,000
and Uncle Yuichi
offered me a beer.

138
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:09,083
He did the same to
a girl in cat ears.

139
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:10,500
Then I managed to get
it away from her

140
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,333
before she could
take a swig of it.

141
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:13,708
But then I did!

142
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:17,250
Oh, man, that one swig
must have made me pass out!

143
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,250
What a lightweight.

144
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,541
Better sleep it off.

145
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:22,958
Huh?

146
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,583
Meow.

147
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,208
Did Aura come back?

148
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:51,958
You! You're that girl!

149
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:54,250
Oh, no, did you injure
your cranial mass?

150
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,708
Just hold on, okay?

151
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,291
You did.

152
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:05,333
But thankfully it's
nothing too severe.

153
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,250
Hey. It doesn't
hurt anymore.

154
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,333
That's because the device
I just used on your head

155
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:15,291
is a tool we employ to heal
injuries where I come from.

156
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,833
Oh. Well,
thanks a lot.

157
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,083
You're red;
are you still ill?

158
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,833
Uh, no, but do you think
you could button up.

159
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:26,000
And maybe explain to me
what you're doing in my bed?

160
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:28,000
Your uncle told me I could
sleep wherever I liked,

161
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:32,750
and curling up next to you
felt like the optimum spot.

162
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:34,250
Kio!

163
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:35,333
Manami?

164
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:37,416
Do you want me
to get that?

165
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,416
No!

166
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,416
Just wait here, 'kay?

167
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,916
Oh, crap!

168
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,416
If Manami sees her, I'm never
gonna hear the end of it!

169
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,750
Alright, just stay calm!

170
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:49,250
Think up an excuse and
get her out of here quick!

171
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:50,458
Hey, Manami.

172
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:53,125
What brings you here?

173
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:54,791
Oh, I just had
a quick question.

174
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:57,250
Who's that big-boobed babe
you drunkenly stumbled home

175
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,250
with last night?

176
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:00,833
Wait, how'd you
know about that?

177
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,291
Uh. I live
across the street,

178
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,416
so I see everything
that goes on around here.

179
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,041
I even know about
the secret stash

180
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:08,333
that you hide under
your mattress; namely.

181
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:09,875
Your porno.

182
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:10,875
So.

183
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,500
Do I get to meet
this girl?

184
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,208
Tell me what she's like.

185
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:17,125
Well, to be totally honest,
she's a little bit strange.

186
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:18,416
Ohhh!

187
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,166
I think I get it, Kio!

188
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,833
Some babe finds
you attractive,

189
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:23,666
and you call her "strange"?

190
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,166
C'mon, have you
looked in a mirror?

191
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,666
You're easy on the eyes.

192
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,416
Gee, thanks, Manami.
But she really is strange.

193
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,791
You two got hot and heavy
last night, didn't you?

194
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,875
Was it a night of
unbridled passion, Kio?

195
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,666
Did she proclaim
her love for you

196
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,416
as she smushed her
pneumatic knockers together

197
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,875
and did she ask you
if you wanted some fries

198
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:41,041
with her shake?

199
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,791
That's about how things
went down, right?

200
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:45,125
I bet your mystery girl's
still in bed right now,

201
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,250
and you're bringing her some
morning coffee, aren't you?

202
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:50,458
Aw, what a perfect little
studmuffin you've become.

203
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:51,625
Hey, what is it?

204
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:54,125
You've got a dirty mind,
you know that?

205
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:55,750
Wow, you're really
one to talk!

206
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,500
Might I remind you
that you're the one

207
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:58,750
who spent the night
with a strange girl?

208
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,500
You've got it all
wrong, Manami!

209
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,041
And who might this be?

210
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,500
They're like huge
cantaloupes!

211
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,333
Hey! What are you
doing down here?

212
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:10,833
Go put some clothes on!

213
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,208
Can I go get
my suit then?

214
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:14,125
It's hanging in the room
that you use for bathing

215
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:15,333
and waste disposal.

216
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:17,250
Uh. Yeah, sure.

217
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:21,291
Pervert.

218
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:22,708
I can explain!

219
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,458
No, there's no need to.

220
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:27,208
You've read so much manga
and played so many video games

221
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:28,958
that you've become
a deviant freak,

222
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,208
one that falls head
over heels and into bed

223
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:32,541
with a cosplaying cutie!

224
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:33,833
Well, am I right or not?

225
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,875
No, you're wrong and
you're totally delusional!

226
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:36,958
Oh, yeah?

227
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,791
Then why is a
practically naked girl

228
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:40,583
running around your house
wearing kitty ears?

229
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:41,583
What?

230
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,333
Is that true?

231
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,208
Miss Itokazu.

232
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:49,250
What are you doing here?

233
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,291
Don't you remember?

234
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:51,666
We were supposed
to meet this morning

235
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,583
to discuss the video
club summer camp.

236
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,500
But never mind that now.

237
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:56,708
And instead.

238
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,625
Please explain
what I just heard.

239
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,750
Uh. Look, Manami's
imagining stuff;

240
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,000
I can explain everything.

241
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,333
Um.

242
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:05,416
Is this suit okay?

243
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:10,375
They're hugepears!

244
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:11,916
Kio!

245
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,083
You're way too young for this;
you're still in high school!

246
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,333
If you've got a thing
for "furries,"

247
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:17,250
then wait until you're
an adult to indulge it!

248
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,625
No! Like I said,
I can explain everything!

249
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:22,250
Those ears and that tail aren't
parts of a cat girl costume;

250
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,750
they're both real!

251
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:26,083
Kio, I'm not an idiot, so
please don't treat me like one!

252
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:28,666
Look, I do know boys are
very curious at your age.

253
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,791
But still.

254
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,791
This fake cat girl
fetish is quite odd.

255
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:34,666
I'm not fake;
come stroke me.

256
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:38,333
If you have any
doubts, go ahead.

257
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,208
Feel!

258
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,041
See?

259
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:50,125
Like he said,
I'm real.

260
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:53,666
Enough,
that tickles!

261
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,875
Hey! Just who .

262
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:56,416
Or what are you?

263
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,000
I'm an alien researching the
planet that you people live on;

264
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:00,583
I sent a message saying,

265
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:03,375
"I'm going to drop by!"

266
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,875
A cat girl from space?

267
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,333
This is ridiculous!

268
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:10,333
I believe alien life
forms do exist out

269
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:11,625
in the cosmos somewhere.

270
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,708
But I doubt they'd have
the same shape as humans

271
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,333
and speak the same language!

272
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:18,375
Even the cheesiest sci-fi
movie would avoid such a cliché!

273
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:19,500
Get real!

274
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,125
To be honest, when
my people first saw

275
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,625
how similar your world's
inhabitants were to us,

276
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,000
we were equally shocked.

277
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:26,375
We thought it was a joke.

278
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:28,208
Stop!
I won't accept this!

279
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:29,833
And your costume
proves nothing!

280
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:33,583
If you're really an alien,
I need hard, irrefutable proof!

281
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,458
Irrefutable, huh?

282
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,375
Let me think here.

283
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:46,500
Hi, Luros;
what's the matter?

284
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,458
Emergency Miss Eris!

285
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:50,875
It appears the ship
has been discovered!

286
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:53,000
But I thought it
was camouflaged?

287
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:55,666
Affirmative, but it wasn't
in active camouflage mode,

288
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,791
Miss, just the passive one.

289
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:00,500
The ship; what's its
current status and location?

290
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,583
Well, it's been caught
in a fibrous net,

291
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:05,041
and it's been pulled up to
the water's surface, Miss.

292
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,541
Um, hey guys.

293
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:07,958
Check out the news.

294
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:10,000
Some have theorized that this
strange piece of metal

295
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,041
pulled from the water might
be an alien spacecraft.

296
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,333
When asked if it could be
related to the mysterious

297
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:17,500
"I'm going to drop by" message,
officials refused comment.

298
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:18,750
The cat's out of the bag.

299
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:19,916
It leaves me no choice.

300
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,458
Ready to carry out
your orders, Miss Eris!

301
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:24,041
Reactivate the ship.

302
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:27,000
Then initiate Program "A,"
number Twenty-Four, Luros.

303
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:29,541
And after that, start
"He," number Eleven.

304
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,958
Okey-dokey, Miss Eris!

305
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,875
What was that?

306
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:38,250
That was Luros,
my ship's navigation system.

307
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,750
We come in peace,
and we mean you no harm.

308
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:43,333
However, we cannot
allow you to detain us,

309
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:44,750
so we must be going now.

310
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,000
Pursuit would be futile.

311
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,500
Goodbye!

312
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,625
Um.

313
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:55,958
I'm not feeling
all that well,

314
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:58,291
so I really need
to be going.

315
00:13:58,375 --> 00:13:59,291
Yeah.

316
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:01,541
I've gotta
get going, too.

317
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:18,291
So, Eris?

318
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:20,166
Did you come to
Earth to conquer us?

319
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,208
Is that it?

320
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:22,375
No, of course not!

321
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,125
I came to foster goodwill.

322
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,500
If I came to conquer, then
both me and my entire race

323
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:29,291
would be destroyed by the
Galactic Sentient Federation.

324
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,708
What's that?

325
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:33,458
An organization that oversees
interstellar relations.

326
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:36,125
It's led by the Orzonians,
mind-based lifeforms

327
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,375
who are one of the more
advanced alien races.

328
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:39,375
Oh, really?

329
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,500
Hey, what race
do you belong to?

330
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:44,250
My people actually refer to
our home planet as "Earth"

331
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,000
and call ourselves
Earthlings.

332
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,166
We knew that would be
confusing once we made contact

333
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,333
with your world,

334
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:52,250
so we now refer
to our planet as "Catia."

335
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,375
Wow.

336
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:00,791
Oh! This miso pork
is incredible!

337
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:02,500
It's yummy!

338
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,500
How do you make it?
Can you give me the recipe?

339
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:07,958
Yeah, sure!

340
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,541
You take some pork.

341
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,708
Cut it up real thin, and then
add a little miso, some mirin,

342
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:13,875
and a dash of sake,
and then you fry it all up

343
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:15,791
in a wok with some oil.

344
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,708
Hey, Manami.

345
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:22,375
What's the good word?

346
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,583
I've got some
killer info at last.

347
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:25,583
Really?

348
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,541
Alright,
then let's hear it.

349
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:30,791
I'll tell you, but only
under one condition.

350
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:33,458
You have to let me come
along on a field op.

351
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:36,500
It's way too soon for
you to be in the field.

352
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,125
Please! Having
field experience

353
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:41,166
will be a huge plus on my
Company entrance evaluation.

354
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,041
What am I gonna
do with you?

355
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:45,250
Alright, I'll put
in a special request

356
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,250
and see if I can
swing something.

357
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:48,625
Aw, thanks a lot!

358
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,666
You're the best and you
won't regret this, I swear!

359
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,208
I better not.

360
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:54,375
What's this "killer info"
you claim to have?

361
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:56,041
I just sent an image to you.

362
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:58,500
This is what you've been
talking about, isn't it?

363
00:15:58,583 --> 00:15:59,583
Wow.

364
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,041
Nice work.

365
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,166
This is a major score.

366
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:11,000
Good morning
to you, Captain.

367
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:13,375
Good morning
to you, Hal.

368
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,750
Hello,
this is Ender.

369
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,083
Hello, Ender.

370
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:25,500
This is Kerberos.

371
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:27,375
Did you see the TV?

372
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:28,375
We did.

373
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:29,625
This is a shame.

374
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:30,833
It would have been
so much more exciting

375
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:32,583
if it hadn't
happened like this.

376
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:33,833
Agreed.

377
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:35,125
I encountered
the life form

378
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:37,333
who piloted the spacecraft
that was recovered.

379
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:39,666
Where?
Are you serious?

380
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,333
Near identical to us.

381
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,416
Sadly, it was
rather unremarkable.

382
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,041
Oh, no.

383
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:48,916
Such a being cannot be allowed
to be mankind's first contact

384
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,708
with an alien race.

385
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:54,166
This is a serious
situation, Ender.

386
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,916
I suggest that you take action
on this issue immediately.

387
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,291
But how?

388
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:01,250
I can't accomplish much
without additional support.

389
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:02,916
We will send
you someone.

390
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,833
We have people in the
Navy and the Air Force.

391
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:07,791
Thanks,
I appreciate it.

392
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,000
Good luck
to you, Ender.

393
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:11,333
Ender, don't forget
to keep your chin up.

394
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:12,333
I won't fail.

395
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:14,083
We'll achieve
Beautiful Contact!

396
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:26,250
[repeating] We will achieve
Beautiful Contact!

397
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,333
Sooooo happy!

398
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:37,208
This has been more
like a vacation

399
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:40,000
than an intergalactic
mission!

400
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,833
Aura was telling the
truth about your species.

401
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:45,666
You welcomed me and served
me that delectable food,

402
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,666
and not only that,
but you also let me join

403
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:51,291
in on all the singing
and dancing, too!

404
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:54,166
You and your fellow
humans are so very kind.

405
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,666
Why thank you.

406
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,625
Thank you; and I hope I'm not
keeping you from anything.

407
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:00,208
Oh, no.
Not really.

408
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:02,833
So Is there anything
you wanted to do today?

409
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,208
No, I don't really have
anything specific planned.

410
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:08,083
I have to go return a couple
of things to a friend of mine.

411
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,416
I won't be gone long.

412
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,125
would you mind watching
the house while I'm away?

413
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:12,708
You don't have to answer
the phone at all.

414
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,333
And if anyone knocks
on the door, ignore it.

415
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:15,750
Okay?

416
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,041
No, I don't mind, but the
least I could do would be

417
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:19,875
to greet any visitors
who might stop by.

418
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:21,416
They might get
freaked out, though.

419
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,416
'cause of your look.

420
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,583
Oh, right.

421
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,666
Your species isn't
used to aliens, is it?

422
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,500
Just stay here and
make yourself at home.

423
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:28,750
Oh, and if you
get hungry,

424
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:31,416
there's tons of food
in the fridge.

425
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,958
Thanks!

426
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:35,291
Have a good time!

427
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,125
Why did Miss Itokazu
get so upset

428
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:40,375
when Eris claimed
to be an alien?

429
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:44,000
She almost sounded like
she was disappointed.

430
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,541
Kakazu.

431
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:51,416
Aoi! I was
looking for you.

432
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,041
Here you go.

433
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:54,083
Thanks again.

434
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,208
I appreciate you
loaning these to me.

435
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:57,500
Well.

436
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:58,583
How were they?

437
00:18:58,666 --> 00:18:59,833
I thought that
"Koyaanisqatsi"

438
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:02,041
had some incredible
cinematography.

439
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:05,166
And as for "Gaia Symphony,"
it really made me think.

440
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:07,500
So you liked them, huh?

441
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:08,791
Yeah. And I'd love
to check out

442
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,625
anything else you feel
like recommending,

443
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:13,041
maybe something from the
director of "Rainbow Kids?"

444
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,333
Okay.

445
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:15,458
Then why don't I loan you
"Desperate Outpost"

446
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:17,041
the next time I see you?

447
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,708
Thanks!

448
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:22,208
Or if... you want to...!

449
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:23,958
Yes?
Go on.

450
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:25,875
Well!

451
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,833
If you want to you

452
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,000
and I could go
watch it today.

453
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:31,666
We could even stop off
at the DVD store

454
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,708
and buy some new releases
if you've got time.

455
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:39,208
Hey, Aoi,
what a coincidence.

456
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:40,208
Oh.

457
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:41,833
Hello, Mr. Endo.

458
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:44,375
You know, I was just on my
way to see your parents.

459
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,208
Would you like a lift?

460
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,583
Hey. Aoi, don't
you worry about me.

461
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:52,166
We'll just do the DVD
thing some other day.

462
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,500
'Kay. Thanks a lot.

463
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,250
How does the day
after tomorrow sound?

464
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:57,250
Sounds great.

465
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:58,375
I'll see you then.

466
00:19:58,458 --> 00:19:59,708
Count on it.

467
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:01,000
See you soon.

468
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:03,041
Yep, take care.

469
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,416
Did I interrupt anything?

470
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,875
Isn't coming here
a contract violation?

471
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,375
There's an emergency
job for you.

472
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:17,666
I didn't want to come,
either, but I have orders.

473
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,958
I admit I found that
amusing back there.

474
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:21,416
Your behavior around him.

475
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,916
That wasn't
an act, was it?

476
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,666
I wonder what Mr. High School
Crush would think if I told him

477
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,000
what you really are?

478
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,000
Shall we find out?

479
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:31,625
Fine, tell him then,
I don't care;

480
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,333
I'll just transfer
to another high school.

481
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:35,250
However.

482
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:41,666
I'll be sure
to kill you first.

483
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,166
And I won't do it because
you obstructed my mission

484
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,708
or caused undue
complications.

485
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:50,333
Instead, I'll do it simply
because I want to kill you.

486
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,500
No, don't shoot!

487
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,916
If you do,
the car will!

488
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,083
It doesn't matter.

489
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:56,375
I'm called "Charmed"
Momiji for a reason.

490
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,375
I won't get
a scratch on me.

491
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,500
You, on the other hand.

492
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,708
I think it's time to add
another chapter to my legend,

493
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:04,000
don't you?

494
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:06,291
Please.
Don't shoot.

495
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,875
I was just joking.

496
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:27,250
What are the details of
this job you have for me?

497
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:28,666
Um. Here.

498
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,625
Same thing as always.

499
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,833
Eliminate a dangerous,
illegal immigrant

500
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:36,916
and those who've been
aiding and abetting her.

501
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,500
The target's Upper A-Class,

502
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:41,916
and you're free to use
any means necessary.

503
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,916
Timeframe?

504
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,416
ASAP.

505
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,958
We'd like to avoid the target's
presence becoming public.

506
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:50,000
We've obtained intel
that other organizations

507
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:52,166
are moving in as well.

508
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,750
We want
to avoid any chaos.

509
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:55,916
You're going to need
my assistance

510
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,541
on this mission, Momiji.

511
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:58,791
So please.

512
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:00,541
Don't kill me.

513
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,458
Dammit.

514
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:12,083
Why did it have
to be you Kakazu?

515
00:23:33,541 --> 00:23:36,166
What happens when a classmate,
a childhood friend,

516
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,666
and a visitor from outer
space come together?

517
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,166
Chaos, a kidnapping,
a lot of people with guns,

518
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,166
and a bunch of explosions,
that's what!

519
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,708
Next time:
"I Dropped By."

520
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:48,750
I'm coming
to drop in on you!
