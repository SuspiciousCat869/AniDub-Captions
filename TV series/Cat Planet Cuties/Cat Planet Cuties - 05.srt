1
00:00:07,791 --> 00:00:08,916
Good morning, Eris.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,500
Your mission, should
you choose to accept it,

3
00:00:10,583 --> 00:00:12,583
is to investigate
planet Earth with the aid

4
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:14,166
of your Catia: Impossible force.

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,625
This tape will self-destruct
in five seconds.

6
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:17,833
Good luck, Eris.

7
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:10,750
Oh, Kio!

8
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:13,583
It's so wonderful to
wake up next to you!

9
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:16,291
Come on...!
This isn't right!

10
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:17,791
I'm sorry, Kio...

11
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:20,375
I'm deep into mating season
right now, I can't help it.

12
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:23,708
What am I gonna
do with you, huh...?

13
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:26,541
Hey, um, where do
you think we are?

14
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:29,250
I don't know, but it
looks pretty plush.

15
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:32,166
You like the
accommodations, then?

16
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,583
Excuse me, where
are we right now?

17
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:36,458
You are in the private room
of the Divine Embodiment,

18
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:38,208
aboard The Androala,

19
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:41,041
headquarters of the
Underside of the Kitten's Paw.

20
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:42,541
Is that so...?

21
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:45,041
And what exactly is this whole
'Divine Embodiment' thing?

22
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:46,583
Oh... But don't
you know...?

23
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,500
You're the
Divine Embodiment.

24
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:50,875
Huh? What?!

25
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,625
I'm sorry,
but you can't do this...

26
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:58,500
I apologize,
but unfortunately,

27
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:00,916
it is against regulations
for me to pose as a deity,

28
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,791
or be given any special
attention by a religious order.

29
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:06,583
Long have we prayed that a
being with genuine kitty-ears

30
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:09,416
and a tail would manifest
itself to us in our world...

31
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,291
Our leader predicted
you would come...

32
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:12,791
And now you're
here with us...

33
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:14,666
The prophecy is coming
true before our eyes

34
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,041
and for this
we are thankful.

35
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:20,708
There's no doubt:
You're the Divine Embodiment.

36
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:22,916
Well, in that case,
I have an order for you...

37
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,416
Release my friend and me
from this place at once!

38
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,750
Sorry, but I can't do that...

39
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:29,250
My orders come direct
from the Founder.

40
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,625
That doesn't make sense.

41
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:33,041
However, I do have
something to offer you.

42
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,916
So, do you like?

43
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,291
Uh... Yeah!

44
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:43,875
Hey, Kio, how 'bout
you and I stay here

45
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,625
just a little
bit longer, huh?

46
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,250
Oh... Sure!

47
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,000
The Divine Embodiment
has awakened.

48
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,041
Good...

49
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,166
Treat her with
the utmost respect.

50
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,500
Yes, as you wish.

51
00:03:57,583 --> 00:04:00,250
What do you think...?
It's such a perfect replica...

52
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,000
I can get as close
as I want to,

53
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:05,041
and the Divine Embodiment won't
suspect a thing, will she?

54
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:07,541
My lady.
It's wonderful.

55
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:08,875
The kitty cult?

56
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,708
The Underside of
the Kitten's Paw?

57
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:12,708
Obviously, I've heard
of religious sects

58
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,666
that worshipped cats
in Ancient Egypt...

59
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,875
But, for them to worship
the ears and tails...

60
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,333
Contact Yokota.

61
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:21,333
Tell them I said to ready
the 'Peanut Vendor.'

62
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:22,916
Right!

63
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,666
It's about time these kitties
and their little feline wannabes

64
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,750
took a permanent cat nap.

65
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:32,625
No, no, no...!
The PBR is one thing,

66
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:35,833
but a powerboat is completely
out of the question.

67
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:38,041
A boat with no speed
just won't cut it...

68
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,958
A powerboat...

69
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:41,375
And we're gonna need
the fastest one you have

70
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:43,291
to get this job done.

71
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:44,875
Look, I'm a weapons dealer...

72
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,875
And a powerboat isn't a
weapon, you understand me?

73
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:49,541
Well... Word on the street is,
you have a fully-tuned,

74
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,041
converted powerboat
that was used

75
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,250
by the Miami
Police Department.

76
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,125
People can't keep
secrets, can they...?

77
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,333
I'm sorry, but the
boat's already booked.

78
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:58,958
Booked...?
But by who?

79
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:00,291
If you wanna make
a bid on it,

80
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,416
then you'll have to deal
with the guy, directly...

81
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,583
Ah... speak
of the devil.

82
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:08,708
Well, well, well, look
what the cat dragged in.

83
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,333
Uncle Yuichi?!

84
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:12,916
Wait a second, you mean
you have the powerboat?

85
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,333
Well, I sorta do...

86
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:16,500
A movie director friend of
mine said he needed one...

87
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,291
Check it.
I brokered the deal.

88
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,583
It's got guns on it, too?

89
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:21,875
Bad ass, huh...?

90
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:24,083
Of course, those are
just props for the flick.

91
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,416
The boat... Where
isit now, is it nearby?

92
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,916
Chichijima.

93
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,583
But the film's
shooting in Ogasawara.

94
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:36,875
I'm so full...

95
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:39,125
Ah...
So delicious!

96
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,000
Wow...

97
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,208
I don't think I've ever eaten
this much food before, have you?

98
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:45,416
Hey, Kio.

99
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,375
Now that we've eaten
this amazing meal,...

100
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,625
I'd say it's about
time we left.

101
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:51,916
Um, just how are we
supposed to do that?

102
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,125
You see this outfit?

103
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:54,875
It's a scaled-down
power suit...

104
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:57,541
I can break through a
bulkhead like this easily.

105
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:58,958
Let's call
the Assistroids.

106
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:00,958
They'll help us escape.

107
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,166
Okay then...

108
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,041
Now!

109
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,625
Eee-yow!

110
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:11,708
It hurts! Oh, it
hurts so bad, Kio!

111
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,500
Yeah, it sure
looked like it did.

112
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,041
I don't know
what happened...

113
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,708
It didn't work.

114
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:18,916
Normally, I could do
it with one punch.

115
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,833
Oh, no!

116
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,625
What's the matter?

117
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,083
It says, 'strength enhancement
function restricted

118
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,875
due to mating season.'

119
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:27,250
This is bad...

120
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,541
My power suit won't work
'cause I'm in mating season.

121
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:30,958
What do you mean?

122
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,791
When I'm in heat, I can't
make rational decisions,

123
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,541
so my suit's functions
are restricted

124
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,625
to protect both
myself and others.

125
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,208
Wait, what?

126
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:39,791
Yes...!

127
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:42,916
Now I can't even call
Luros or my Assistroids!

128
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,041
There's no reason
for you to worry.

129
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:48,250
We have our own research
and development team...

130
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:49,958
So, we've built you
something that's identical

131
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:51,333
to the Assistroids...

132
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,625
See for yourself.

133
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,208
What the...?

134
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:03,333
His name is Unya.

135
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,708
Please allow him to
serve at your side.

136
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:11,583
Is this just a guy
in a suit?

137
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,708
Oh, no...
He's a robot.

138
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:16,750
There is nobody
inside of it.

139
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,583
Listen up,
here's the deal...

140
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,083
The Androala plans
to rendezvous

141
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,916
with an escort fleet standing
in a nearby sector...

142
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,958
We've got to rescue
them before then.

143
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:26,416
Got it.

144
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,375
Our first order of business
is secretly replacing

145
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,791
the prop guns on the
powerboat with real ones.

146
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,041
Look, I like the plan...

147
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:33,916
But, do you think he's
gonna accept our terms

148
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,916
for borrowing it?

149
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,125
Of course not...

150
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:38,583
Once we're out at sea,
he can't stop us.

151
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,833
I really hate doing
this to Uncle Yuichi...

152
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:43,000
But, unfortunately, I don't
think we have a choice here.

153
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,250
You're right, I guess we
gotta do what we gotta do.

154
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:48,083
Stand by, we're almost
at the drop point.

155
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:58,708
Good luck!

156
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:14,750
Whoa...
It's so amazing!

157
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:18,916
You would never guess we
were on a boat, would you?

158
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,875
Wait, whaddaya mean,
'everything?'...

159
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,125
Oh...

160
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,916
Hey, where are
you taking me?

161
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,125
Is that a
merry-go-round?

162
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,416
Wow...

163
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,541
I see, this must be a primitive
horse-riding simulator, right?

164
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:36,375
Such elaborate
decorations...

165
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:38,625
I wonder if it
belonged to royalty.

166
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:41,291
And look at all these lights,
so beautiful and bright...

167
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,541
It's just so wonderful!

168
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,416
She really is
having a good time.

169
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,541
Oh, cool...

170
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:58,083
We'll have to play
each other on this!

171
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:00,541
Hey, wait...

172
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,875
Are all of these
single players?

173
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,666
What about the
guy in the suit?

174
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:10,416
Doesn't he ever wanna
play with someone?

175
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,166
There's no one
inside the suit...?

176
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,625
It's a robot made to serve
the Divine Embodiment...

177
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:16,875
It's just gears and circuits
and nothing else, got it?

178
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,500
Uh... Right...

179
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,208
But, these games are
all single player,

180
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,750
doesn't your Founder ever get
bored just playing by herself?

181
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,750
In a game, there is a
winner and a loser...

182
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:27,083
And it would be extremely
disrespectful for us

183
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,666
to beat our own Founder...

184
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:33,083
Even more so to go easy on
her so she can always win.

185
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:35,458
Tell me: What kinda
person is your Founder?

186
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,166
She has obtained
everything.

187
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,041
Everything, huh?

188
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,375
After her grandfather
passed away,

189
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,000
she inherited
his wealth...

190
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:44,541
Expanding her ever-increasing
estate is her only job,

191
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,375
and one she takes
very seriously...

192
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:47,833
But, she's very young...

193
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,375
Her future is long...

194
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,083
The internal flames
of her passion

195
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:53,166
have only just started
burning brightly...

196
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,791
You see... ever since she
discovered kitty-ears,

197
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,958
she found her first love,
and with it, her purpose.

198
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,333
I'm just about
finished up.

199
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:15,666
Yeah, same here...

200
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,083
I didn't think
swapping dummies

201
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,458
for the real thing would
be this easy, did you?

202
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:20,958
We've gotta be ready.

203
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,416
The Androala should be
passing by here pretty soon...

204
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,791
And I think we should set
off before the guy

205
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,333
who rented this shows up.

206
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:27,750
Hey, Aoi?

207
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,000
What is it?

208
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:32,500
I'm dying to know, what
do you like about Kio?

209
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,541
Uh... Where'd
that come from?

210
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:37,166
Come on...
Spill the beans.

211
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,083
I guess I just like him...

212
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:41,583
He's kind and cheerful and
the most decent person I know...

213
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,875
He is the complete
opposite of me...

214
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,958
Hey... Can I
ask you something?

215
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,541
Yes?

216
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,041
I want you to tell
me the truth,

217
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:51,416
are you positive you don't
have any feelings for Kakazu?

218
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,083
Oh, that is
such a laugh...

219
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,333
Yeah, right...!

220
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:56,291
There's nothing
to like about him.

221
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:58,708
Uh... Oh,
it's nothing.

222
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:01,500
Right.

223
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,166
A visitor?

224
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,541
Hey, stop!
Quit it!

225
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:09,666
Let go of me, creep!

226
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,333
You sure do have your
character down pat...

227
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:15,291
I should've known Yuichi
would find the right girls.

228
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,708
Hey...
Wait a sec...

229
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:18,000
That means you're-

230
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,250
Oh, yes...

231
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,291
I'm Kawasaki,
the famous director...

232
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,791
And this is my
powerboat, girls!

233
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,291
Oh, no...!
We're too late!

234
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,375
Kawasaki,
the director...?

235
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:28,416
Oh, wow!

236
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,583
Hold on,
you know this guy?

237
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:32,833
Mr. awasaki is a
cult film director

238
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:35,333
known for making
B- grade action flicks

239
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:36,875
that feature skimpy plots,

240
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:39,666
and actresses in even
skimpier bikinis.

241
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,625
Now, let's hurry up
and get dressed, you two.

242
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:44,208
Get dressed,
but-No way!

243
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:46,125
Well, I hope you're
not having second thoughts

244
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,541
about doing my film...

245
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:50,500
Our morning location
shoot is coming up soon!

246
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,500
Cat Planet Cuties!

247
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,416
This shot will be from
directly below them...

248
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,208
We want to highlight
their assets!

249
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,375
What do we do, Aoi?

250
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,916
Well...
The show must go on.

251
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,416
Let's get a move
on, girls...!

252
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,458
The sun's up,
no time to waste!

253
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:22,958
Ah, geez!

254
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:24,958
Oh, my!

255
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:27,333
You look wonderful...!

256
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,500
Beautiful, ladies... This scene
is going to be piping hot,...

257
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:30,500
Manami.

258
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,500
Let's go.

259
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,041
Do it, boys!

260
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:34,375
Hey, you two!

261
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:36,666
We're not doing
that part yet!

262
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,583
Come back!

263
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:56,750
Roll those
cameras now...!

264
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:57,833
This is great...

265
00:12:57,916 --> 00:12:59,750
Just keep shooting, boys!

266
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,541
You're worn out from
playing, aren't you?

267
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,875
Looks like someone
had a lot of fun.

268
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,583
How nice... It's been
a really long time

269
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,416
since I've seen
her so peaceful...

270
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,416
As hard as she works,
she deserves it.

271
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,000
Wait, I thought
it was a robot.

272
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,250
Status report!

273
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,583
We've got a problem.

274
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,291
There is a small watercraft
approaching our ship

275
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,500
at a dangerously
high speed.

276
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,583
There it is.

277
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,708
Yeah, that's the stuff!

278
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:46,875
Nice shot!

279
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:49,583
This footage
is solid gold!

280
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,000
What's the situation?

281
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,875
The boat just entered
our visual field...

282
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,916
But, Miss Maya, don't you
think this is a bit much

283
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,208
for just one boat?

284
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:58,000
No, not with Charmed
Momiji on board.

285
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:00,375
No way... After her fall
off the train in Tokyo,

286
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:02,208
I thought she'd
be too injured.

287
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:03,791
If she were just
a human, maybe...

288
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,458
But I guess she
really is charmed.

289
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:06,958
Stop her!

290
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:09,083
Take fire
control, Manami!

291
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,458
You got it!

292
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,458
Fire!

293
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:21,833
Go! Now!

294
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:23,416
Okay!

295
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:38,041
It can't be...!
Our targeting is off!

296
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:39,375
They've cracked it...

297
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,166
Someone has hacked into our
fire control system

298
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,583
and shut everything down!

299
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:43,750
Well?

300
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:45,541
Bad news, looks like
it was a direct hit!

301
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,041
Radar...
Tell me what you see?!

302
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:48,875
I didn't pick up anything!

303
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,125
The hell happened
to the missiles?

304
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:57,875
They're our latest
secret weapon...

305
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,333
They're absolutely
classified;

306
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,333
so don't mention
them to anyone...

307
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,083
Move in and
finish them off.

308
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:06,166
Prepare for battle!

309
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,541
It's so sad...

310
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,291
Seems like having
everything in the world

311
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:12,416
is not too different
from having nothing at all.

312
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,291
The bullets inside
Yun-Fat's toy guns...

313
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,791
are quasi-antimatter...

314
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:23,291
They're dangerous weapons
capable of obliterating

315
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:27,000
any non-living matter by
means of quasi-annihilation.

316
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,916
Here we go!

317
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:39,666
I'll try and create
a diversion...

318
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,625
Go after Eris and Kakazu.

319
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:44,083
Don't worry, I'll rescue them
if it's the last thing I do!

320
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:45,375
Ma'am, there's a
breach in the hull...!

321
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:46,666
We're being flooded...!

322
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,166
Location 'C Seventy-Six'
and 'C Seventy-Seven!'

323
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,208
That doesn't make sense,

324
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:51,583
that's not where
the missiles hit.

325
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,541
There's a boarding
craft inside the ship!

326
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:56,458
Intruders...!
Take defensive positions!

327
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,541
I'm going down there.

328
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:01,916
This suit
is so awesome!

329
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,625
Good job, Kio.

330
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,291
You were right, it doesn't
detect that I'm in heat,

331
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,541
so when I put it on,

332
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,458
the functionality
restrictions are lifted.

333
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:11,625
Perfect... Do us both a favor
and contact the Assistroids.

334
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:12,541
Right.

335
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,083
Move.

336
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:24,500
This way!

337
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,375
Time for you to pay
your boarding fee!

338
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:40,416
Executive Officer Sara
is a sucker for cats

339
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,291
and all things cute...

340
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:46,125
As a result, she left a career
as an up and coming SAS elite,

341
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:49,625
and ended up a cult member
on a boat full of lunatics.

342
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,458
How cute!

343
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,958
That should shut down the
power and buy us some time.

344
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,666
She looks just...

345
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,708
... like me.

346
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:19,083
Japan's filled
with monkeys!

347
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:21,416
And, from the looks of things,
you do 'monkey see,

348
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,208
monkey do' pretty damn well!

349
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:25,625
Why, you...!

350
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,250
I can't move.

351
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:31,958
Aw, that's
really too bad.

352
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:33,208
Didn't you know?

353
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,291
Things built with canine
technology are designed

354
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:38,000
so they can't
attack dogs.

355
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,083
This is goodbye,
Charmed Momiji.

356
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:41,583
Apport.

357
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,208
You really thought
it would work

358
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:48,125
as long as you didn't
directly attack me?

359
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:49,125
Wishful thinking.

360
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:50,666
No, not exactly.

361
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,000
What the...?!

362
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,083
My suit has the same
drawbacks as yours...

363
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:56,583
The hard-soft powered
suit is flexible armor...

364
00:17:56,666 --> 00:18:00,416
But with the controls shut down,
it's a human shaped coffin.

365
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,250
You think
you can beat me?!

366
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,250
Doggie ears?

367
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,166
Time to die!

368
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,458
War Dog, it's Pack
Leader, come in...

369
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,375
Destroy my current
position in thirty seconds.

370
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,416
Deploy the rockets.

371
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,041
All hands,
abandon ship...

372
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:39,041
All hands,
abandon ship!

373
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:40,083
The ship is lost, my lady.

374
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:41,500
We must go.

375
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:42,750
So, we're sinking?

376
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,333
I'm so sorry.

377
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:45,958
Hey, Manami!

378
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,375
Kio...!
Thank goodness!

379
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:50,000
Hey, what's
with the outfit?

380
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,291
Um, what's
with your outfit?

381
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,208
I don't think you're
in a position to judge.

382
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:55,958
Manami...
I like it!

383
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:58,833
You look like a sexy
bunny-eared rabbit alien.

384
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,458
Look, I'll explain later...!

385
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:03,291
Hurry up, we gotta go!

386
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,333
There they are...
This is your fault!

387
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,375
Says you,
the kidnapper!

388
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:09,416
Hand over the
Divine Embodiment!

389
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,750
Lady, there's no way in
hell we're gonna do that!

390
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:14,250
There's no time...
Turn her over or I'll shoot!

391
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:15,333
That's not gonna happen!

392
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:16,833
Just stop it...!

393
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:19,083
The ship is sinking, there's
no time to be doing this!

394
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:20,541
Stay out of it...!

395
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:23,083
You may be her tagalong,
but you'll get no mercy!

396
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,583
It doesn't matter how badly you
want something you can't have,

397
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,291
it doesn't give you
the right to take it!

398
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,833
You're wrong; the lady can
have anything she wants to!

399
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:33,000
Yeah...? Then why doesn't
she have any friends?

400
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:35,416
She has loyal servants
waiting on her, hand and foot.

401
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,750
Who cares...?!

402
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:38,125
A friend is someone
you laugh and cry with,

403
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,791
someone you get mad
at and fight with,

404
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:41,958
but you always make up in
the end, no matter what...!

405
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:44,666
People who follow you and submit
to your orders aren't friends!

406
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,500
You know nothing of us!

407
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:48,666
After all...
what good is a video game

408
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,250
if there's nobody
to play it with you?

409
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:52,458
Bastard!

410
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:54,291
Please...
Stop... Maya.

411
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,125
Yes, but...
My lady...

412
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,250
The things we've done to
Lady Eris and Mister Kakazu

413
00:19:58,333 --> 00:19:59,541
are not right...

414
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,041
So, I ask for your
forgiveness...

415
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:02,083
Please.

416
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,750
But, my lady...

417
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,916
Maya and I are abandoning
ship in a lifeboat...

418
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,375
Please come with us.

419
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:10,166
Thank you very much, that's
such a nice offer, Unya.

420
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,625
Uh... I'm sorry,

421
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,416
but I think you've mistaken
me for somebody else.

422
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,500
Well, all the same, thanks.

423
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:17,625
Sure.

424
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:20,541
Hold on... I can't
get a signal on Aoi!

425
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,291
She's unconscious
in the engine room?!

426
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:23,583
How do you know that?

427
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,333
Because, the Assistroids
have the ability

428
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:27,625
to monitor the vital
signs of their masters!

429
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:29,250
Oh, no...!
What are we gonna do?!

430
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:30,875
The engine room's
too far...

431
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:34,125
There's no time
to rescue her.

432
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,375
The ship is going down!

433
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:38,208
Oh, this is
just wonderful!

434
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:42,291
Keep those cameras
rolling, people!

435
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,500
Next time.

436
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:45,916
I'll make you pay for this.

437
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,708
Aoi...!
Aoi!

438
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:54,500
Where are you?!

439
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,708
Aoi...!

440
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,750
Kakazu...

441
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,166
Kakazu...

442
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,791
He's saving me.

443
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:23,666
Oh, wow.

444
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:58,000
This is a dream...

445
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,875
It must be.

446
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,333
I love you...

447
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:10,375
Kakazu.

448
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:36,458
Cooking can be a drag...

449
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:38,541
But, virtual Kio's
are lots of fun...

450
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,750
Of course, nothing
ruins a video shoot

451
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:43,125
quite like a good
old-fashioned cat in heat!

452
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:45,500
Next time...
"I've Practiced!"

453
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:48,416
I'm coming
to drop in on you!
