1
00:00:07,916 --> 00:00:09,958
Space: the final frontier.

2
00:00:10,041 --> 00:00:12,583
These are the voyages
of the Starship Catia.

3
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:16,333
Its five-year mission:
To explore strange, new worlds.

4
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:19,333
To seek out new life
and new civilizations.

5
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:22,708
To boldly go where no sexy
alien cat woman from a planet

6
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:26,041
full of sexy alien cat
women has gone before.

7
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:05,291
After arriving on Earth,
the Catian leadership proceeded

8
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,833
to an exchange center
to formally establish

9
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:11,958
diplomatic relations with
the government of Japan.

10
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:14,125
But, the cultural barriers
between the two groups

11
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:15,458
were considerable.

12
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:18,375
The negotiations with Japan
proved to be tricky,

13
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:21,625
as their differing wills
became extremely apparent.

14
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,000
I understand.

15
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:24,791
Basically, your
nation is considering

16
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,916
whether or not they want
to enter into negotiations

17
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,666
with the government
of Catia.

18
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,708
And while your leaders

19
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:31,208
are making their
final determination,

20
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,250
we're more than welcome
to remain on your planet

21
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:34,875
as unofficial guests.

22
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:36,666
Is that about
right, gentlemen?

23
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,500
Well, uh, you see, yes...

24
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:41,000
Very well then.

25
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:43,458
By the way, in regards to our
accommodations while here.

26
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:46,000
We won't require assistance
as we're currently staying

27
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,875
at the residence of a
private citizen.

28
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:50,291
Oh, well, while
this is unofficial,

29
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:52,375
it is nonetheless
considered state-funded.

30
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:53,958
On behalf of the
people of Japan,

31
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,541
we would like to cover your
expenses while you're here.

32
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:58,666
No, that really
won't be necessary.

33
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,125
But, as an annual outlay
and a gesture of kindness,

34
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:02,708
we'd ask you pay
us this much.

35
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,625
What? Two you say?

36
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:05,916
Yes, two.

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,583
We are not willing
to negotiate.

38
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:08,666
But we can't just--

39
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,041
I would like
to remind you gentlemen

40
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:12,041
that our advance
surveyor came very close

41
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:15,166
to being killed while
in your country.

42
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,541
But, what's done is done,

43
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,791
there's no sense crying
over spilled milk.

44
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:22,000
Our people will not be
seeking a formal apology.

45
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:24,375
I do beg your
pardon but, um...

46
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:25,958
May we have some time?

47
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:28,458
Of course, we know
you must be very busy.

48
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,458
We'll return at a later time
to hear your final answer.

49
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,833
Till then, have
a wonderful day.

50
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:38,625
Oh! I've never felt so
embarrassed before in my life!

51
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:39,875
Eris!

52
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:41,708
Are you sure this was
proper for us to wear?

53
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:43,916
I would say they were
extremely effective.

54
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,750
You bowled right over them
and left them laying there

55
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:48,208
like cats in heat,
Captain Kune.

56
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:49,583
What's the harm?

57
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:52,083
I like this outfit actually,
it makes me feel frisky.

58
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,041
But Doctor Durel!

59
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,083
It looks "purrfectly"
fine on all of you.

60
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,666
But it rubs my
fur the wrong way.

61
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,250
Oh, Executive
Officer Melwin,

62
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,750
what you lack in size you
make up for in charm.

63
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,000
That's right!

64
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,833
There's more to
breasts than just size.

65
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:06,666
The small ones
can be fun, too.

66
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,750
Besides, who even
needs big breasts

67
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:09,208
when you've got
a really nice tail,

68
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,666
am I right, Melwin?

69
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,500
Regardless of the relative
merit of breasts,

70
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:14,250
our plan to establish
diplomatic relations

71
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:16,541
between Catia
and Earth has begun!

72
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:18,625
Now let's all keep
this momentum going!

73
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,666
Yeah!

74
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,208
Did they really say two?

75
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:24,291
Yes, I'm afraid so.

76
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,958
Catians can drive
a hard bargain.

77
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,791
I guess it's about time.

78
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:40,583
I'm ready to move
when you are.

79
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,541
Leave the escape
route to me.

80
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,250
Our cell phones
can be traced.

81
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:45,833
More details to come.

82
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:47,250
Bye now.

83
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:59,208
No choice but to
leave them behind.

84
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:00,458
Sorry for the burden.

85
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:01,541
But until we hear
back from them,

86
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,708
we'll need to stay
here for awhile.

87
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,166
Would that be alright?

88
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,416
Yeah, sure.

89
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,250
That's cool with me.

90
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,666
Kio, that's great!

91
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,041
Thank you so much
for your generosity!

92
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,250
It's fine.

93
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:15,541
But how come you're
all wearing swimsuits?

94
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:17,458
Eris said putting these on
would help us negotiate

95
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:18,875
with the male earthlings.

96
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,833
It's true.
And apparently, on Earth,

97
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:22,666
school swimsuits are
everybody's favorite thing

98
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,333
to wear to a
business meeting.

99
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:25,750
Is that right?

100
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,250
And where did you
read that, huh?

101
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:28,625
Oh, I read it in one
of those magazines

102
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:31,041
you hide under
your bed, Kio.

103
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,583
Hey, give that back!

104
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,041
Whoa, Kio you
naughty boy, you!

105
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:38,125
It looks like we picked
the right attire, ladies,

106
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:41,625
the human men in these
magazines look very satisfied!

107
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:42,833
It's not like that.

108
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:45,083
Listen to me: these
magazines are fiction!

109
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:48,041
Don't tell me you're
at this again?

110
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,583
Manami,
where'd you come from?

111
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:54,083
I take my eyes off
you for one minute,

112
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:56,916
and you convince these alien
chicks to dress up like this?

113
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,125
You pervert.

114
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:00,000
You've got it all wrong!
It's not like that!

115
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,416
Hello.

116
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,875
Pardon me,
but is Kakazu here?

117
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:12,291
They're like coconuts!

118
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,500
All right,
that's enough!

119
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:15,750
Everyone change!

120
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:16,750
Kio's right.

121
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,291
Since the negotiations
are done,

122
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,625
we should all change back
to our usual uniforms.

123
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,791
Don't look!

124
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:37,875
Must be nice.

125
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:41,041
You senior officers
have it easy.

126
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:44,000
Hey. So, what's up with
all the luggage, Manami?

127
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:45,166
What's going on?

128
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,291
Everything okay?

129
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:49,833
Oh, yeah.
Listen, about that.

130
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:50,833
The truth is

131
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:53,375
we've come to say
goodbye, Kakazu.

132
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,833
Manami Kinjyou.

133
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:00,875
Currently under consideration
to become a CIA field agent.

134
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,333
Aoi Futaba.

135
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:04,375
aka 'Charmed Momiji'.

136
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:08,250
Special Interrogator for the
Japanese Immigration Bureau.

137
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:09,583
Maki Itokazu.

138
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:10,833
Member of the Japan branch

139
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:13,291
of the Beautiful Contact
secret society,

140
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:14,666
a group that fantasizes

141
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,291
about the first contact
with alien life.

142
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:20,083
As a result of the havoc
created by these three women,

143
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,958
each of whom are
connected to Kio Kakazu,

144
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,458
a young boy the Catian
has had contact with,

145
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:27,833
the subject ended
up escaping.

146
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,833
Most of the organizations
those three represent

147
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,416
have been assisted
by us in the past.

148
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,541
Ingrates.

149
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:34,958
Indeed.

150
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:37,375
It appears the dog is biting
the hand that feeds it.

151
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:40,125
Was that some sort of joke
or attempt at sarcasm?

152
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:41,833
Because I don't
find it funny.

153
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:44,125
Oh, no, I...

154
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,833
Please continue.

155
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:49,125
The incident was written
off as being an accident.

156
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,708
And the subject still
remains holed up

157
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:53,166
in the exact same
place as before.

158
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,958
You do realize the
severity of the situation.

159
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:58,333
As a result of this fiasco,
the covert dealings

160
00:07:58,416 --> 00:07:59,666
between Dogishua
and your country

161
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,375
have been made known
to the cats.

162
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:02,708
Yes, ma'am.

163
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:04,625
The cats intend to use
Japan as a starting point

164
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:07,416
to begin formal diplomatic
relations with Earth.

165
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,083
And if they succeed.

166
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,583
The exclusive benefits your
country has come to enjoy

167
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,958
will no longer
be possible.

168
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,583
We won't let
it come to that.

169
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:18,333
Earth belongs to the dogs,
we marked our territory

170
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,083
by coming to you first.

171
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,083
If they think they can prance
in like they own the place,

172
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,625
they've got another
think coming!

173
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:26,916
If they try to test us,
we'll show those pesky furballs

174
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,125
there's more than one
way to skin a cat!

175
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,083
See, that was a joke.

176
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,833
Oh... Of course.

177
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,291
Wait, you're leaving?

178
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:40,666
But why?

179
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,541
Look, Kio, in
our line of work.

180
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,500
Once you've turned your
back on the organization,

181
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:45,833
you're as good as dead.

182
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:48,541
Plus. I bet they're
watching us right now.

183
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:49,833
So, that's it?

184
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,750
It's okay,
don't you worry.

185
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,791
I promise, we won't go
down without a fight.

186
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:55,458
Just trust us, Kio.

187
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,541
We've been trained to
maintain a low profile.

188
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,833
We know how to protect
ourselves and stay alive.

189
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,125
But you can't just--

190
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,833
Hey! We know
you'll miss us.

191
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:03,875
But you'll be fine.

192
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:06,166
Just keep on
being yourself.

193
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,250
Kakazu.

194
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:08,333
Be careful.

195
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,541
But, you guys, you
can't just leave!

196
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,583
Hey, can't you
do something?

197
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:13,875
Unfortunately,
we can't.

198
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:15,458
We still haven't formally
established a treaty

199
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,041
with this world.

200
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:19,000
Currently, there isn't anything
we can do to intervene,

201
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,041
right, Captain?

202
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,083
Nothing?

203
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:24,958
Actually, that's
not entirely true.

204
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,625
Technically speaking,
for the moment at least,

205
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,125
the Kakazu residence
is serving

206
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,458
as the provisional
Catian Embassy.

207
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:31,375
I get it.

208
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,291
You're right,
Captain Kune!

209
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:34,833
Wait, whaddaya mean?

210
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:36,666
You're onto something.

211
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,833
This place isn't
Earth or Japan.

212
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:41,625
It's under extraterritorial
jurisdiction.

213
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:44,500
And governed exclusively
by Catian law.

214
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:47,083
And if someone tried to harm
anyone inside these walls.

215
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,208
It would be the equivalent
of an unprovoked attack

216
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:50,750
on a foreign nation.

217
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:53,208
It would be a huge incident,
which might even lead to war.

218
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:54,791
Our laws can protect you.

219
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,208
Not even people from
your organizations

220
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:58,166
will be able to lay
a hand on you.

221
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,416
Hold on a sec.

222
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,916
So you mean--

223
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,250
You two girls
can move in with us

224
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,041
and be our brand
new roommates!

225
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,250
Huh?

226
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,500
We've got business to attend
to on the mothership.

227
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:09,833
You hold down
the fort here.

228
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:10,833
Sound good?

229
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:11,833
Yes!

230
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:13,583
No fooling around, got it?

231
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,541
Oh, except for a little
hanky-panky with Kio,

232
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:17,750
we're totally
okay with that--

233
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,750
If you discover any new
data about this world.

234
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,166
Send it on at once.

235
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,750
Roger that!

236
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,041
Wow, there they go.

237
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,458
So, let me make
sure I understand

238
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:28,500
what's happening here;

239
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:31,166
the four of us
are living together?

240
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,000
Don't worry,
it'll be fine!

241
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:36,500
Relax guys; the Assistroids will
do all the housework for you!

242
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:39,458
Housework is the
least of my concerns.

243
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:49,333
Oh!

244
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,500
Cat Planet Cuties!

245
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:59,333
Yeah. My pajamas
and some clothes.

246
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,291
Also my cell phone charger.

247
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:02,583
Yep. Bye, bye.

248
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,500
So What did your
Aunt say, Manami?

249
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,041
She told me to stay
out of trouble.

250
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,875
It's so close;
I could go get them myself!

251
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:11,083
Please, just let me
take care of this one.

252
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:12,750
We don't have a choice;
if you go outside

253
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,791
we can't claim
extraterritorial rights.

254
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,458
But my house,
it's just.

255
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,833
right across the street.

256
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:20,791
Until negotiations are
settled, the four of us

257
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,791
are gonna sit down
and have some fun.

258
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:25,500
There's no reason to stress,
we're in a safe zone.

259
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:27,708
I guess you're right.

260
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:29,416
Things could've
been much worse.

261
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,583
I could get
used to this.

262
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,416
Oh, come on.

263
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,833
Aren't you overdoing it?

264
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,750
We've been neighbors
forever, Kio.

265
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:38,916
This has always been
my second home,

266
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,916
and I see no reason
to change that now.

267
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,250
What about you?

268
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:45,541
Oh... Uh...

269
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,416
What were you
saying, Kakazu?

270
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,958
You might not be able to leave
here for a really long time;

271
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:51,500
you should call
your parents.

272
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:52,875
Well, the truth is,

273
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:55,250
I don't really have
any family, or relatives.

274
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:56,666
Oh. Uh...

275
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,208
Plus the identity I had here
was false to begin with

276
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,000
due to my job.

277
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:04,666
I didn't know. I'm sorry.

278
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,291
Oh... No, it's...

279
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:09,125
Don't apologize Kakazu,
it's not your fault.

280
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:11,875
I really do appreciate
your concern, though.

281
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:24,875
Let's see.

282
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,333
You and you have dinner
so you go to the kitchen.

283
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,250
Yours is clothing so
go to the bedroom.

284
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,875
You two I won't need for
awhile, so I'll store you...

285
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:33,916
Why bring over stuff you're
not even going to use?

286
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,458
Hey.

287
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:38,458
Don't you find it inconvenient
that they don't have names?

288
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,041
Well, we could assign
them numbers for now

289
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:42,958
if that would help?

290
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:46,416
There. From now
on you'll be Number Six!

291
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,625
Oh no, we've got
two seventeens.

292
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,791
Things have really gotten
out of hand here lately.

293
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:59,333
You'll do that?
Thank you!

294
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:02,500
Maybe this was
a bad idea.

295
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,166
The stuff with
Manami and Aoi.

296
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,500
I feel awful, it's not like they
can go back to their jobs now.

297
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,250
They had goals
they were pursuing

298
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:14,875
and careers they were developing
and now that's all gone away.

299
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:16,166
I owe them.

300
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,708
They really saved my skin
back there, you know?

301
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:22,041
If anything, I should be the
one sticking my neck out

302
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:22,958
for them this time.

303
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:25,000
But what can
I do for them?

304
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:27,833
No way.

305
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:29,833
I'm nothing special.

306
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:34,875
Thanks a lot.

307
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,000
Hey, Kio.

308
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,333
Could you use some
help with your back?

309
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:40,166
Huh? Eris?

310
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,208
No thanks!

311
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:42,958
Please, I insist.

312
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:45,750
A woman is supposed to wash a
man's every nook and cranny!

313
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,375
I read it
in your magazines!

314
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:48,625
No.

315
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,041
Please stop.

316
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:51,291
Haven't you ever
heard the phrase

317
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,041
"you can't believe
everything you read?"

318
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,875
What's all the
racket in here?

319
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:58,583
No! Let me explain!
please Manami!

320
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,041
Once again your
perverted nature

321
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,750
has gotten the better
of you, Kio!

322
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:04,375
I just can't leave
you alone, can I?

323
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,000
This is the last straw!

324
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,625
It's time I scrubbed
that filthy mind of yours!

325
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:08,625
Wait! Manami!

326
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:11,333
Help me!

327
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,708
What's with
all the yelling?

328
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:16,375
Please.
Don't be mad.

329
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:17,375
Hey there!

330
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:18,916
It's not my fault.

331
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,916
Wanna help me scrub Kio's
hard-to-reach spots?

332
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,416
Eris, please. Stop it!

333
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:29,125
Why you...

334
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,458
Sick peeerveeerrrt!

335
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,166
These girls will
be the death of me.

336
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,625
Geez!

337
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:41,000
The nerve of that
guy, I swear!

338
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,833
You know,
I just don't get it.

339
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,208
I don't understand
what you see in him.

340
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,541
You are into him,
aren't you, Aoi?

341
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:52,625
Umm. Well, I... I don't know.

342
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:53,625
I was sort of under
the impression

343
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:56,500
that you liked
Kakazu like that.

344
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,708
Please, you must be joking!

345
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:01,166
Yeah but, the two
of you are so close.

346
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,625
I've been stuck with
that moron forever.

347
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:06,041
I did come close to
liking him once, though.

348
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,666
Well, what came of it?

349
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,791
Did he turn you down?

350
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,583
No, of course not!

351
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:17,333
Truth is, Kio was
really shy back then.

352
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,375
He didn't exactly know
how to talk to girls.

353
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:22,041
Not even me, and we've known
each other our whole lives.

354
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,875
Eventually though,
things changed.

355
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:26,000
He got comfortable around
me and started to treat me

356
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,125
like I was one of the guys.

357
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,000
Once I realized he
thought of me that way,

358
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,250
I really didn't
care anymore.

359
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,541
We're just friends.

360
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:36,458
And I wouldn't want
it any other way.

361
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,041
Right.

362
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:41,166
You, on the other hand, might
actually have a shot with him.

363
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,125
Trust me, I've known
Kio my whole life,

364
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,458
and I know when he
likes somebody,

365
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,916
and he's totally
into you.

366
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,791
Twenty one hundred hours.

367
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:55,541
Looks like the cute objects
are changing the guard.

368
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:57,250
Number seventeen
is relieving number...

369
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,083
Wait, how can that be?

370
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,250
What's going on?

371
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:02,750
Yeah, but.

372
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:05,000
He can't like me;
I'm not an ordinary girl.

373
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,125
Huh?

374
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,666
Here, watch this.

375
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,500
Apport.

376
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,291
Whoa.
Hold on a second.

377
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:13,375
How did you--?

378
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,208
It's my special power.

379
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,083
I've always had it.

380
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:19,875
For as long as
I can remember,

381
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:21,541
I've had the ability
to teleport objects

382
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,666
within a
fifty-meter radius.

383
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,000
But because of my power,

384
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:27,083
no one wanted anything
to do with me.

385
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:29,125
Not even my family.

386
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:33,791
Eventually, I found my place
as an agent of the underworld.

387
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,750
I've stained my hands
with blood many times

388
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:38,166
for the mission's sake.

389
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,958
That's terrible.

390
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,541
The fact is...

391
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,958
I come from a world that
Kakazu will never understand.

392
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,875
What's with
the alarm, huh?

393
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:52,750
Guys! Intruders!

394
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:54,416
Apport!

395
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,416
Cover me!

396
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,125
Hey! Hold on!

397
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:01,750
Let's go!

398
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,083
Since they have two
of the same kind,

399
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:17,625
they won't miss this one!

400
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,666
Apport!

401
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:30,166
Oops.
Sorry about that.

402
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,500
You idiot!

403
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,291
What if something had
happened to the kitty?

404
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,958
Don't move!

405
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:39,541
State your
affiliation and rank!

406
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:40,791
Are you CIA?

407
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:43,833
Or did the Immigration
Bureau send you here?

408
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,458
I'm insulted you would lump
us in the same category

409
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:47,791
as those low-lifes.

410
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,916
But let's just say we're
servants of a nobler master

411
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,291
and a much higher cause.

412
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,125
They threw
a stun grenade!

413
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:58,083
Oh, no!

414
00:17:58,166 --> 00:17:59,500
They got away!

415
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:02,375
Don't worry,
we're coming!

416
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:03,791
We're almost there!

417
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,708
Hey, guys,
are you all right?

418
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:13,333
Ahhh! How dare you, pervert!

419
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:14,708
You're gonna hit me!

420
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:15,583
I'll kill you!

421
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,208
It's good
to have you back.

422
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:21,291
I knew you were a sicko!

423
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,250
Stop looking!

424
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,125
He's such an idiot!

425
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,333
I swear, he drives me nuts!

426
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:36,125
It's not his fault; we were the
ones who were naked, you know?

427
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:38,333
It's not a question of
whether he's at fault or not.

428
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:41,166
He shouldn't have come running
when we were undressed.

429
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,375
Well, we were in the
middle of a gun fight.

430
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:44,583
The only reason
he came running

431
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:47,208
is 'cause he was really
worried about us.

432
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:52,833
You really do like
him, don't you?

433
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:54,250
No, I... I don't.

434
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,416
Oh, please.

435
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,541
Here's a friendly
piece of advice.

436
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:58,791
Kio's kind of wishy-washy,

437
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:00,125
so if you don't stand
up for yourself,

438
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,916
that alien cat chick is
gonna steal him away.

439
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,500
Hey. Look.

440
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,625
I've got your back
no matter what, 'kay?

441
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:11,125
No way I'm gonna let that
alien get the best of you.

442
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,875
Yeah but... How do I...?

443
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:14,500
You can't let your past
prevent you from going

444
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,416
after your future.

445
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,000
Just have a little more
faith in yourself.

446
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,666
You're right.
Thanks, Manami.

447
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:22,958
Anytime.

448
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:26,041
Now let's get some sleep,
alright, roomie?

449
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:27,416
Okay.

450
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:36,750
And so, the new roommates
slept together under one roof.

451
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:40,208
For the moment at least,
they were peaceful and content.

452
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:42,708
There's something important
I'd like to discuss.

453
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,583
How would you three like
to become official employees

454
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,666
of the provisional
Catian Embassy?

455
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,166
We'd work here?

456
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,625
What would we do?

457
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,875
Well, for starters, we could
definitely use the help

458
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,625
of people who know their
way around this planet.

459
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,083
Plus, because of your
special abilities,

460
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:58,958
I was thinking you two
would make really good--

461
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,625
I don't know what to call it,
'safety-keepers' maybe?

462
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:02,750
Safety-keepers?

463
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,125
Security.

464
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:05,875
But we can't.

465
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,750
Hello Manami.

466
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:13,125
Jack! It's you!

467
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:14,833
Why are you calling me?

468
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:17,666
I have something you
might wanna hear.

469
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,750
Manami, there's
an organization

470
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,875
targeting your
alley cat friend.

471
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:23,083
Tell her to watch out.

472
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:25,083
You be careful too, okay?

473
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:26,541
Hold on, Jack!

474
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:29,291
Listen, I know
I interfered with your work.

475
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,125
My responsibility was
to apprehend the target

476
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:32,375
and that's it.

477
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,791
Anything that happened
after that wasn't on me.

478
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,583
Look girl, you just took
the wind out of the sails

479
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:40,958
of one of my least favorite
people in the entire world.

480
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:43,000
Don't worry, we're fine, okay?

481
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:46,125
If I hear anything else,
I'll be in touch.

482
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:47,375
Manami?

483
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,000
Yeah Aoi? Whats up?

484
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:51,333
I know this might seem
hard to believe but,

485
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,916
what if they weren't
coming after us?

486
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:56,708
Kio, who is this
Jack person?

487
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:59,250
Oh, that's the guy
Manami's going out with.

488
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:00,791
Jack is not a guy!

489
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,875
She is a woman, moron!

490
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:05,541
Oh! You like girls.

491
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:08,333
It's Janice Allectus
Carotinas Kalinart.

492
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:09,750
Or 'Jack' for short.

493
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:12,208
She's my boss at
the CIA, you idiot.

494
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:13,291
Or she was, I guess.

495
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:14,791
Oh, I see.

496
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,458
I was confused
'cause of her name.

497
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:17,916
Plus, every time you get
a phone call from her,

498
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,375
you're always whispering.

499
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,541
I thought you two were secret
boyfriend and girlfriend.

500
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:22,750
Idiot.

501
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,166
That's funny.

502
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,833
Here I was thinking you were
in a serious relationship

503
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:27,458
this whole time.

504
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:29,833
Well, I'm so sorry
to disappoint you.

505
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,666
Can I ask you something?

506
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,625
What's that?

507
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:37,833
Uh. Oh, it's nothing.

508
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:39,375
What's wrong?
Are you okay?

509
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,041
Just leave me alone.

510
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:49,250
I'm sorry, ma'am,
please forgive me.

511
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:51,875
I was unable to
bring you your gift.

512
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:56,666
I swear, I will
get it next time.

513
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,250
And the Divine
Embodiment, too.

514
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:36,291
Spending the day in Tokyo
is always a great time.

515
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:38,125
Well, unless you run

516
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,041
into a bunch of cat
worshipping nutjobs

517
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:42,625
that randomly attack you and
kidnap your friends, that is!

518
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:43,625
Next time...

519
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:45,458
"We've Come
to Kidnap You!"

520
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:48,083
I'm coming
to drop in on you!
