1
00:00:08,416 --> 00:00:10,708
Once upon a time, there
were two little girls...

2
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:12,833
One who worked
for the CIA,

3
00:00:12,916 --> 00:00:15,833
and the other for the
Japanese Immigration Bureau...

4
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:19,791
And they were assigned
very hazardous duties...

5
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:21,708
But she took them
away from all that,

6
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:23,416
and now they
work for her...

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,916
Her name is Eris.

8
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:03,916
Aboard the
Catian mothership,

9
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,625
the attack on The Androala
was being analyzed.

10
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:09,166
Aoi was wearing this,

11
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,166
a powered suit that can
shift from soft to hard.

12
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,083
It's made of demiflow metal,
which can change thickness

13
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:17,875
when a bio-electric current
is activated inside of it.

14
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:19,875
The end result
is an exoskeleton

15
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:23,000
that's flexible one
moment and rigid the next.

16
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:27,083
Whoa...! That thing's
so hard that even a cat

17
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:28,833
couldn't scratch it!

18
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:33,083
Now it's soft...

19
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:34,666
And limp...

20
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,541
These images
from the battle

21
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:40,375
were still in the
suit's memory files.

22
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:42,416
She's a Dogishuan!

23
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,875
Correct.

24
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:46,333
Plus that suit is
of Dogishuan design...

25
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,208
Those curs obviously already
have a pawhold on Earth.

26
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:51,958
Do you think that they're dug
in like ticks, Captain Qoone...?

27
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,750
Why would the Earthlings
deal with them?

28
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:54,791
Weaponry...

29
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,333
Based on that suit,
it's clear

30
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,875
the dogs are illegally
sharing it with them...

31
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:00,833
The Galactic Sentient
Federation banned them

32
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:03,541
from fostering any
interstellar relations...

33
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,666
So whatever hole they've dug
for themselves on Earth,

34
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,250
they've done
under the table...

35
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,125
And what's more...

36
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:11,041
The only scraps they can offer
to feed to the Earthlings

37
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:13,416
is their technology.

38
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,000
Illegal or not...

39
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,250
They'll use their position
to try and bury us.

40
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,208
Mark my words.

41
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:20,833
Chaika?
Huh?

42
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:23,291
Please relay this info to Eris
and tell her to be on guard.

43
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:26,041
Aye, aye, Captain!

44
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:27,916
What kind of
room is this...?

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,750
Is it some type of
Earth torture chamber?

46
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:33,791
It's a steam bath, more
commonly known as a sauna.

47
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:36,375
The Earthlings
actually enjoy this...?

48
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:38,375
They can tolerate heat
at this temperature?

49
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:39,750
I can't!

50
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,458
I've only been in here
for a few minutes,

51
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,666
but I'm starting
to feel catatonic!

52
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,541
Hey, how many paws
am I holding up?

53
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,791
Okay, fine, I'll change
it to something else...!

54
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:50,666
Virtual Reality Program,
switch to the next simulation!

55
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,916
What's the
next simulation?

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,666
After enjoying a traditional
Finnish sauna,

57
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,708
Earthlings usually cool
off in the snow outside.

58
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:09,083
Your Video Club
is making a movie?

59
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,541
Yep...

60
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,416
We're gonna make a sci-fi
short about aliens,

61
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,291
and I told 'em you'd
be the perfect lead...

62
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:17,916
I guess you could say it's the
role you were born to play!

63
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,583
Uh... Thank you
for considering me...

64
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:22,083
And I'd be honored to help
you and your club out.

65
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,583
Thanks a lot, Eris...

66
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,000
Now, gear...

67
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,708
What other pieces are
we gonna need...?

68
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,208
Oh! That's right...

69
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:29,708
Definitely the tripod...

70
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,583
Good thinking
there, Sadakichi.

71
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,291
So tell me, Kio...

72
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:35,708
How's having your own personal
Assistroid working out for you?

73
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:37,166
Oh, it's incredible...!

74
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,291
Sadakichi
here is the best!

75
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,583
Alright...
In terms of gear...

76
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:46,500
I've got the camera,
charged batteries,

77
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,291
and old tapes
we can record over...

78
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:51,750
Wait... I'd better open up
a virgin tape, too...

79
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:55,750
I know there's one
around here somewhere...

80
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,041
Ah!

81
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,041
Kio...

82
00:04:58,125 --> 00:04:59,708
Huh?

83
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:02,500
Do you think... That if
it's not too much trouble...

84
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:05,000
You could please open
up my virgin tape, too?!

85
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,541
Um...! Eris,
what's come over you?!

86
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,708
Meow, Kio!
Let's breed!

87
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:12,500
You can even film it
for your Video Club!

88
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:15,291
Wait, you mean
like "get busy?!"

89
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:16,666
Huh?!

90
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,666
That came from-......

91
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,416
-the backyard!

92
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,458
Now I'll show you
how to reload.

93
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:23,916
Cradle the gun
in your left hand,

94
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,875
and release the cylinder
with your right thumb,

95
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,375
and push it out
with your left, middle,

96
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:28,750
and ring fingers.

97
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,625
Then push the ejector rod
with your left thumb,

98
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:31,875
and as you're
emptying the shells,

99
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:35,166
ready the new rounds
with your right.

100
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,416
Load the rounds
with your right hand,

101
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,083
while using the left
to turn the cylinder...

102
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,500
Next, close the cylinder
using your left thumb...

103
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:42,916
Replace the grip
in your right hand...

104
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,791
And assume a proper stance.

105
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,583
You mean you don't
use a speed loader?

106
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:47,958
No, they bulge
in your pocket

107
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:50,083
and reveal how many
bullets you have left.

108
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:51,125
Wow, really?

109
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:52,916
Sure do.

110
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:04,541
Nice shots...!

111
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,333
Do you think I could
become that good?

112
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:08,416
Sure, you just have
to work at it...

113
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,416
Here, give it a try.

114
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,875
No, don't you dare!

115
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:12,208
Oh, Kakazu!

116
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:13,916
What the heck are
you doing back here?!

117
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Duh!

118
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,791
We're getting in
some target practice.

119
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:19,041
In the backyard?!
Are you nuts?!

120
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,083
I'm sorry, Kakazu.

121
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:21,333
No, don't be...!

122
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:24,541
This stuff is part
of our job, after all!

123
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:27,458
Look... We're the security
for the Catian Embassy...

124
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,875
That means Aoi and I've gotta
be able to practice our skills

125
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,291
if we're to protect
this joint...

126
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:34,166
And those skills do include
marksmanship, you dingus!

127
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,041
A skill that Aoi offered
to teach me back here!

128
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:38,416
Oh, really...?

129
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,958
You didn't pester her
until you wore her down...?

130
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:42,791
I'm sorry
she did that, Aoi.

131
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,500
No, it's okay...

132
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:45,916
I don't mind.

133
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,333
Hey, wait, when did
I become the bad guy?!

134
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:49,625
We're in a neighborhood.

135
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:52,041
You can't just go shooting
guns off back here.

136
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:53,541
That's where
you're wrong, pal...!

137
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:55,166
This is the Catian
provisional embassy,

138
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,208
a place with
extraterritorial jurisdiction,

139
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,708
so we can
shoot guns here!

140
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,166
Please,
you're a gun nut,

141
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,041
and you're just using that
as an excuse to shoot.

142
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,291
Stop shooting...

143
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:05,833
You guys are gonna freak
all the neighbors out...

144
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,250
Those poor people...

145
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:08,875
They've already had to put
up with you guys shooting

146
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,750
and running around naked.

147
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:15,000
I told you not to
mention that again!

148
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:19,666
It appears that the girls
are going to have

149
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,291
to find a new
place to practice.

150
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:25,791
That little
dust-up cost us...

151
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:28,000
Namely twelve
valuable Assistroids,

152
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:31,500
compared to the enemy's loss
of one worthless luxury liner...

153
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,208
That's one cat fight
we definitely lost.

154
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,583
Things are more
grave as a result...

155
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:40,000
The cats have now
made allies...

156
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,250
And with a group that has
tremendous resources, too...!

157
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,333
That kitten
cult is powerful!

158
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:46,333
Are you saying this
is all my fault?

159
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:47,333
No...

160
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:48,833
N-not at all...

161
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:50,833
Well, to be honest, it is...

162
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:52,958
I did fail to drown
those pussies...

163
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:56,041
But I will stop them
and all of their allies...

164
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,333
They'll regret slinking
into my territory.

165
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:01,750
I won't let any more of
my soldiers die like dogs!

166
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,041
Listen, the quickest
way to a guy's heart

167
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:11,333
is through his stomach,
and Kio's no exception, Aoi.

168
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:13,541
He is a bit of a manga freak,
so you might wanna whip up

169
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:14,916
something like
egg roll-ups

170
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,708
or even wieners cut
to resemble octopi.

171
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,416
Nothing too normal,
though, okay...?

172
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,291
To grab his attention...

173
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:26,750
You'll have to make dishes that
characters eat in shojo manga.

174
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:29,208
Wait...
What is shojo manga?

175
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,416
Y'know, the kind that's
primarily marketed to girls,

176
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,125
but some guys dig, too...

177
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:35,291
You can count Kio
as part of that group...

178
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,791
The dirty little pervert!

179
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,166
Um, well...

180
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,583
I'm not familiar
with it at all

181
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,166
because I've never
read any manga.

182
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,875
Wow, not even when
you were younger?

183
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,250
No, I was working back then.

184
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,708
Right...

185
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:49,416
You didn't have the most
normal upbringing, did you?

186
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,833
Eh, I guess
I didn't.

187
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:53,500
Don't worry.

188
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:56,291
Remember, you're teaching me
how to be a better shot, Aoi...

189
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:58,500
And in exchange for that,
I'm gonna teach you

190
00:08:58,583 --> 00:08:59,833
how to tag and bag Kio...

191
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,666
That is what we
agreed to, right?

192
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,041
We did, but still-...

193
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,458
Kio's too scared
to admit it,

194
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:05,958
but I know he's
crazy about you...

195
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:07,541
Huh?

196
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,791
Aoi, to be brutally honest,
this isn't gonna be easy...

197
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:12,333
It's gonna take a lot of hard
work from you and me both,

198
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:13,791
but come hell
or high water,

199
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,625
we're gonna make that
doofus finally admit

200
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,625
that he loves you...! 'Kay!

201
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:18,916
You really think so?

202
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,500
You're gonna have
to bring your A-game...!

203
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:23,791
Trust me on this, anything
less than that won't work...!

204
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,333
Look at it this way...

205
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:28,208
You're a soldier and love
is the war you're fighting!

206
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,000
You can't surrender!

207
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,083
Right...

208
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:39,625
Cat Planet Cuties.

209
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,333
Dammit...

210
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,333
Dammit...

211
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:58,583
Dammit!

212
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,333
I can't stand having
target practice

213
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:02,041
with a stinkin'
pellet pistol!

214
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:04,208
Manami...

215
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:05,416
Sorry...

216
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,541
I did like you told
me, but this happened.

217
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:09,666
Um...

218
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,458
What's that...
burnt thing?

219
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,875
It's an egg roll-up...

220
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:17,000
Well, at least that's
what it was supposed to be...

221
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,333
Guess I'm not the only one
who needs some practice.

222
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:23,166
I heard you guys need
a place to do that.

223
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,375
We do.

224
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,791
How'd you know that?

225
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,125
Eris told me about
your problem.

226
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:30,041
I know a place where
the both of you can practice

227
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,958
and no one'll get mad.

228
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:34,875
Uh...

229
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,541
These guys are gonna
shoot the close-ups,

230
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,916
and you and me are gonna get in
position to get the wide shots!

231
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,958
You ready?

232
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:40,958
Yes, sir!

233
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,041
This is Eris?

234
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,416
Yep.

235
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,375
Um... I know you said
she'd make the perfect alien

236
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,250
for today's shoot, but...

237
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,708
We were hoping she'd look
a little more "alien-y."

238
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,250
Uh... Yeah,
exactly...!

239
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:55,416
For the sake of realism,
an alien shouldn't look human!

240
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,875
Yeah, but humans don't have
kitty ears or a tail, do they?

241
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,750
But it's not just that.

242
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,291
She looks more like
a girl in a costume.

243
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:04,000
You're right.

244
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,416
But, anyway, Kio told us you
have something that might

245
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,458
pass for a UFO.

246
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,416
Yeah...!
Is that true?!

247
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,791
Well, to be precise, a UFO is
an unidentified flying object.

248
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,416
What I have is an identified
flying object, ladies...

249
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,458
And yes, you can use it.

250
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:19,791
Oh, cool!

251
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,125
Maybe it'll save us
from having to do

252
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,541
any post-production
special effects!

253
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:25,291
Let me show it to you...

254
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:28,083
Here... Look.

255
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:29,458
Good morning!

256
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:32,166
And how may I serve
you today, Miss Eris?

257
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,541
Would you please circle
the ship around a few times?

258
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:37,666
Okey-dokey,
Miss Eris! Right away!

259
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,083
Whoa!
A UFO!

260
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,875
That thing
looks incredible!

261
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,583
It sure does, and who
needs special effects

262
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,833
when we have that?!

263
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,375
Hey... Wait...

264
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:56,583
Uh-oh...

265
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,958
What's wrong?

266
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:01,541
Here, look.

267
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:04,291
It looks like it's
suspended on strings.

268
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:05,625
Yeah, it does.

269
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,708
Oh, wait...
Those things...?

270
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:09,750
They're not strings,
but charge-emitting probes...

271
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:13,291
They're for
low-speed navigation.

272
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,708
It just doesn't look
like the real thing.

273
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,000
Sorry.

274
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:18,250
Don't apologize.

275
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,333
I agree; you're
absolutely right, girls!

276
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:21,791
Aside from that...

277
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,666
Got anything that
might look more sci-fi?

278
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,083
You know,
a robot or something?

279
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:28,416
Yes, I sure do!

280
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,291
This isn't gonna work.

281
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,875
Uh-uh.

282
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,500
I know; it looks
like a toy...!

283
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,166
Not alien tech!

284
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,583
Sorry about this, Eris,
but it seems they want stuff

285
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,166
that looks more like
the real thing.

286
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,666
But they are the
real things, Kio.

287
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,083
Tell you what...

288
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:46,291
Why don't we drop
the sci-fi theme?

289
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:49,416
I say instead of making a
short about alien contact...

290
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,208
We make a romantic
one instead.

291
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,750
Great idea!

292
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,166
See, Kio?

293
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,666
I told you we should let
the video club shoot this!

294
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,375
Eris, wait, what
are you doing?!...

295
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,500
What the hell do you
think you're doing...?!

296
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:02,875
Kio, stop it!

297
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:05,500
I'm not doing anything,
Miss Itokazu, she is!

298
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:08,583
Whoa, those two seem to be
really into this, don't they?!

299
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,041
Yeah, especially Eris!

300
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:11,041
Meow!

301
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:14,125
Somebody help!

302
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:15,541
So this is--...

303
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:16,875
... The Virtual Room, huh?

304
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,458
Yeah!

305
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:20,833
It's also what we
call a simulator...

306
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,541
It can project any
setting you can think of,

307
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,208
and mimic just about
anything you want

308
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:26,125
through realistic holograms.

309
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:27,458
Really?

310
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,250
Wow, so that means I
could practice my cooking

311
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,625
without wasting any real
ingredients, huh?

312
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,958
You could practice
anything in here; we do...

313
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:36,541
And especially once we've
reached our sixteenth cycles...

314
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:37,791
Sorry?

315
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,750
Yeah, what are
you talking about?

316
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,125
You see, when we're going
through our mating seasons...

317
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:43,625
We don't always
have partners,

318
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:48,458
so we use the Virtual Room
to "rectify" the situation.

319
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,750
Wait, by "rectify," you
don't mean that-...?

320
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:53,291
Yeah, I'm pretty
sure she does.

321
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,083
Do you guys
wanna try it?

322
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,083
I know!

323
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,916
How 'bout
I input Kio's data?

324
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,541
That way you can both
have him as a partner

325
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:04,708
and do him at
the same time!

326
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:07,750
Just show us how to practice
the non-sex stuff, please!

327
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:10,291
C'mon, there's no
need to be shy!

328
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:13,458
You guys'll love it,
I promise.

329
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:16,833
No thanks,
we'll pass!

330
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:19,791
Okay, I would like a
typical Earth kitchen...

331
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,708
One stocked with a
wide variety of food...

332
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:25,041
Plus the requisite utensils
and seasonings, as well.

333
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:33,666
This looks so real!

334
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,708
The only thing I need
now is a taste-tester...

335
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,666
Let's see...

336
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,208
Yes...

337
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:42,125
I want someone who's
a lot like Kakazu!

338
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:48,333
Wait...
Hold on...

339
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:51,250
Not "a lot like,"
but the actual Kakazu.

340
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,000
Holy crap!

341
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:58,458
There's just so many;
where do I start?!

342
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,125
Wait!
I know!

343
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,750
Something I've never had
a chance to shoot...?!

344
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:05,375
An M134
minigun...!

345
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,875
Oh...!
Beautiful!

346
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,833
I guess I'm gonna
need some help...

347
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:18,583
In that case,
give me Kio...!

348
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:20,500
Do me a favor and
pick that up for me.

349
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:21,500
That thing?

350
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,041
You can't be serious...

351
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:25,500
It looks way too heavy for
me to pick up all by myself.

352
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,208
It acts just like him...!

353
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:31,208
I wonder how it would respond
to some other things...?

354
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:32,666
How have you been
doing, lately?

355
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,625
Doing? Well,
let's see here...

356
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:36,666
Um, pretty much
normal, I guess.

357
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,791
That's his usual,
boring answer, alright...

358
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,625
Hey, Kio, I've been
meaning to ask you.

359
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,750
What do you
think about Eris?

360
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:46,166
What do I think...?
She's alright, I guess ...

361
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,791
Why would you ask me
something like that?

362
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:51,833
Same wishy-washy answers...

363
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:55,125
Give me another Kio...!
One that'll answer honestly!

364
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:56,833
Oh, Eris...?

365
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:59,500
Her boobs are
really big and bouncy!

366
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,916
I think this Kio
might be too honest!

367
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,500
Fine, why don't you tell me
what you think about Aoi then!

368
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,208
She's real cute.

369
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:10,166
Well, I can't argue with
you about that; she is cute.

370
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,833
I also feel sorry for her.

371
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:12,833
Huh?

372
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:13,875
It's simple...

373
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:16,125
Aoi was shy and
kept to herself...

374
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:19,291
I didn't know why, but it
was because of her job...

375
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:21,750
That's the reason she didn't
really have any friends...

376
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:22,916
So...

377
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,458
I felt bad for her...

378
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:26,833
All she had was her
love of movies...

379
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,208
I thought she
could use a friend,

380
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:30,250
so I reached out to her.

381
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:33,500
Yeah... That does sound like
something that you would do...

382
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:34,958
Even though
I rag on you a lot,

383
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:37,458
you do have a really
good heart, Kio...

384
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:40,333
If that's how you
feel about Aoi...

385
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,583
Then I have to know what your
true feelings are toward me!

386
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:44,583
You?

387
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,208
Well...

388
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:49,166
You're a loud, crass tomboy
who bosses everyone around...

389
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,750
You're probably the biggest
gun nut in the world, too...

390
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:53,125
Thanks a lot!

391
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,000
But...

392
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:58,083
You're also the one person
who really touched my life.

393
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,375
Huh?

394
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,000
Sure, you're bossy,

395
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,625
but you were also friendly
enough to talk to me back

396
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,125
when I was really shy...

397
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:06,291
Did I ever tell you that's
the nicest thing anyone's

398
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,250
ever done for me?

399
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,583
Still, I was nervous
talking to you

400
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:12,041
because you
were so pretty.

401
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,208
Kio...

402
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:14,750
Then one day...

403
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,458
I heard you talking
on the phone...

404
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:18,416
You mentioned the
name Jack several times

405
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,833
and sounded really happy and
were laughing quite a bit, too.

406
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,208
At that point,
I was sure

407
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,583
that Jack was some
guy you were dating...

408
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,625
So I thought maybe
I should just give up

409
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:30,541
on becoming anything more
than just a friend to you.

410
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,041
And so I did...

411
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,666
That's when I stopped getting
so nervous around you.

412
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,416
What?

413
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,208
Since we were only
going to be friends...

414
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,458
What?

415
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:42,208
I didn't have to worry
about impressing you

416
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:43,291
as a potential girlfriend.

417
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:44,958
What?

418
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:46,208
Now look at me...

419
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:47,916
I'm totally at ease
speaking to you

420
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,416
due to the decision
you made me make.

421
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,958
I made you make?

422
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:53,375
You gave me no choice
but to give up.

423
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,125
You're telling me
all this now...?!

424
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,458
I don't believe this...!

425
00:17:56,541 --> 00:18:00,083
You're saying that
it's all my fault?!

426
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:01,833
Simply because I didn't
tell you that my boss

427
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:03,833
at the CIA
wasn't a guy...?!

428
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,583
Now I could kick myself
for not telling you

429
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,291
how I felt about you...!

430
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,625
Yeah, I know I should've,
but you never once bothered

431
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,458
to ask me about Jack...

432
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:14,833
So is that the only reason why
you and I are just friends...?

433
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:16,041
It is...

434
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:19,750
This is all my
fault, isn't it?!

435
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,291
This isn't your fault
at all, Manami...

436
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:22,833
Instead, it's all mine...

437
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:25,500
I'm the one who should've told
you how I felt a lot sooner.

438
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,666
No, stop...!
That isn't true...!

439
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,416
I know what you're
trying to do here...!

440
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,000
I won't let you take
the blame for my screw-up!

441
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:35,500
It's incredibly kind of you,
but knock it off!

442
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,750
Even so, I wish you
would've told me...!

443
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:41,125
Things could have been so much
different between us if you had!

444
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:42,333
Sorry...

445
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:44,375
I left you...
behind.

446
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:00,791
You've gotta get your
nose out of a book

447
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:02,583
and get some fresh air
every now and then!

448
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:03,916
Come on!

449
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,541
Manami, wait up...!
You're going too fast!

450
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:09,083
You can't beat a girl?

451
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,541
Pathetic!

452
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:13,333
Well, it's gonna feel weird
going against a girl,

453
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:16,166
but if it's a race you want,
it's a race you'll get.

454
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,458
How 'bout a wager then?

455
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:18,791
Huh?

456
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,166
Loser buys the
winner an ice cream.

457
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:25,250
Hey, wait, what
kind of ice cream?!

458
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,166
Don't worry, you'll find out
after I've won this race,

459
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,833
you slowpoke!

460
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:33,750
Wow...

461
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:36,458
He used to be such a
weakling and a cry-baby...

462
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:37,958
But before I knew it...

463
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:41,625
He grew up and got strong,
and eventually overtook me...

464
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:44,541
Kio, wait...!

465
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,875
No, don't
leave me behind!

466
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,958
Are you okay, Manami?

467
00:19:58,041 --> 00:19:59,875
Yeah.

468
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:02,541
I guess you scratched
your watch, huh?

469
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,125
Yeah.

470
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:05,708
It was a
brand-new one, right?

471
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,458
Yeah.

472
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:10,000
I'm sorry that
happened to you.

473
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,166
Kio?

474
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,583
Uh-huh?

475
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,250
Don't leave me behind.

476
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,125
Um, what are you
talking about?

477
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:19,291
Never mind...
It's nothing, 'kay?

478
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:21,000
You're weird,
Manami.

479
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:32,208
Wow! You mean
you made this, Aoi?

480
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:35,333
Yes...! Would you please taste
it and tell me what you think?

481
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,041
Sure!

482
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,791
I'd be happy to!

483
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,875
So...
do you like it?

484
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:45,750
Um... It's, uh,
little different.

485
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:50,041
What happened?!

486
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,333
Back in the Virtual Room,

487
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,125
Kakazu told me he thought
this dish was delicious!

488
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:56,666
Oh, he said that only
because it wasn't really him.

489
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,916
Huh?

490
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,333
Remember, that Kio
was only a hologram...

491
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,583
It responded the way you
wanted the idealized Kio

492
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,166
in your mind to react.

493
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,708
This one...

494
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:08,416
The real Kio, may or may not
feel the same way, though.

495
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,916
Oh, great...

496
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,541
So then...

497
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:15,875
What he said in there could have
just been in my imagination?

498
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:20,833
Huh...

499
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:22,833
I just noticed
Eris isn't here.

500
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:26,208
Nope... She got called up
to the mothership.

501
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:28,541
Aw....

502
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:31,916
Do I really have
to take these things?

503
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,625
Per Captain Qoone's orders,
Investigator Eris...

504
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:37,250
based on your worsening
condition and recent behavior

505
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:38,375
impeding your duties...

506
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:39,916
It has been decided...

507
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,291
Your mating season for this
cycle is suspended at once.

508
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:45,500
But Captain Qoone!

509
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:48,708
Dear... We don't have
any other choice.

510
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:52,000
Well... You heard
the Captain, down the hatch.

511
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:53,708
Goodbye, first
mating season;

512
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:56,125
it could have
been so much fun!

513
00:21:57,958 --> 00:21:59,875
Please wait
until my next one!

514
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:01,916
Okay, Kio?!

515
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:36,416
White sands
and coral reefs!

516
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,166
Solar prints and suntans!

517
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,125
Micro-bikinis and thongs!

518
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:43,083
Wanna guess where the next
episode takes place...?!

519
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:45,500
Next time:
"We've Come to Swim."

520
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:48,166
I'm coming to drop in on you!
