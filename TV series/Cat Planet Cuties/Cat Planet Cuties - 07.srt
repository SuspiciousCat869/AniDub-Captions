1
00:00:07,791 --> 00:00:09,166
Eris of Catia in...

2
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:10,666
"Be Scratched!"

3
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,750
Life for young
newlyweds can be tough,

4
00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:15,041
but try being
married to an alien!

5
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:17,000
With a nosy neighbor,
a pushy mother,

6
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:19,208
and a husband played
by two different actors,

7
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:21,208
Eris has her hands full.

8
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:23,916
But a twitch of her nose
can wish her problems away!

9
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,166
Shojo manga...

10
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,125
Huh.

11
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:12,875
Wait, what time...?

12
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:15,500
Oh, no...!
I'm gonna be late.

13
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:18,958
Summer vacation
is over...

14
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:20,291
And, as of today...

15
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:22,833
The second semester begins.

16
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:30,416
Another sunny day!

17
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,500
Now, then.
Before we get started...

18
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:35,375
I'd like to introduce
some new transfer students.

19
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:37,250
Come on in!

20
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:43,708
Wow!
She has a tail!

21
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,625
This is Eris,
an extra-terrestrial

22
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:49,458
who will study with us.

23
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:52,583
Please make her
feel welcome, class.

24
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:53,708
I still don't
know much about Earth,

25
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:55,458
but I can't wait to learn...

26
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:58,375
And I'm very pleased
to make your acquaintance.

27
00:02:58,458 --> 00:02:59,541
Eris, um...

28
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:01,750
Why are you...?

29
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:04,333
Ah. Gotta
love shore duty.

30
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:05,500
There's just
nothing better...

31
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:07,125
It's so relaxing...

32
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:08,958
Yep, this is the life.

33
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:10,333
So, anyway, Captain...

34
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,250
what's with this whole
Eris going to school thing?

35
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,041
Oh, yeah, that...

36
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:16,333
Well, the poor thing had her
mating season cut short,

37
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:17,375
so I approved it.

38
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:18,958
I figured as much...

39
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:21,000
She's acting unusually
serious about it, though...

40
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,916
She seemed to accept
it at face value

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,958
that she's "just there to survey
Earth education systems."

42
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:28,916
She is kind of bumble-headed
when it comes to that subject.

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,833
There's always so
much stuff going on...

44
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:32,541
It's impossible for her
and Kio to find some time

45
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:34,083
to be alone together.

46
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:36,291
Are you referring
to Aoi and Manami?

47
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:37,583
Oh, please.

48
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:40,416
If only it were just
the two of them.

49
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,250
Antonia...

50
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:43,541
Lirimonie...

51
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:46,125
Norfederas Papanorgas...

52
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:49,791
Arecroteles
Cnorses Morfenoss.

53
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:52,083
Since I am not yet accustomed
to this country...

54
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,500
I'll kindly ask you
all for your regards.

55
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,083
Antonia...
What the...?

56
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,041
Eris, did she
follow you here?

57
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,583
Oh, come on...

58
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,958
A world-class millionaire like
her coming to our school...?

59
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,041
This can't
be safe... No way.

60
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:05,750
Look.

61
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:08,000
From the American
Justice Department.

62
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:11,416
NIJ dash zero one zero
eight, point zero one...

63
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,708
This is level three
bulletproof glass.

64
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:15,625
She's pulled some strings.

65
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,166
Yeah, and that's not all...

66
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,708
Bodyguards, too.

67
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:22,333
Now say hello to Antonia's
special friends, Maya and Sara.

68
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:23,583
My Lady...

69
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,750
Can you explain why
we currently have bread

70
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,333
hanging out of our mouths?

71
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:30,750
This is a custom for transfer
students in this country.

72
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,375
Oh, I see...

73
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:34,000
You are indeed
most knowledgeable.

74
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,625
If I may inquire,
where did you hear

75
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,916
of this particular
tradition, My Lady?

76
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,541
I first learned of it
when I read a book labeled,

77
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:45,166
'Shojo Manga."

78
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,333
She's totally right.

79
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,083
Kio, is something
the matter?

80
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:02,125
Oh... Uh...

81
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:03,916
It's just everyone's
staring at me...

82
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,666
I'm not used to it.

83
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,083
It's bothering you...

84
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,416
We can't have that, can we?

85
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,541
What say you,
Miss Eris?

86
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:16,541
Better?

87
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:19,083
Uh... Sure!

88
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,541
Yo! Kio!

89
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:24,541
Hey, are you-

90
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:25,666
No, it's all right...!

91
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,000
Don't shoot;
they're in my video club!

92
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,833
It looks like the rumors
about you are true...

93
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:34,000
You do live a rough and
tumble life, don't you?

94
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,708
I'm real sorry about that.

95
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:36,833
So what's the story...?

96
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,333
Are you gonna
be able to come to camp?

97
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:40,625
What is this camp
you're talking about?

98
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,791
Oh, it's something the
club does every semester.

99
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,666
It's cool...!
And you're welcome to come.

100
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,583
Thank you...!
That sounds fun!

101
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:48,166
What? Great...!

102
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,958
All you have to do now
is fill out this form.

103
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,708
We'll take some
of those, please.

104
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:55,875
If Miss Eris joins the club,
then the Lady's joining it, too.

105
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:57,833
Hey...!
Four-Eyes!

106
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,708
We want some forms, too!

107
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:01,875
But... Manami!

108
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,208
We just hit the
jackpot here...!

109
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:09,125
Our girl to guy ratio
just shot through the roof!

110
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,333
Explain to me why we
just joined their club?

111
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,416
Oh, come on,
get with it, Aoi...!

112
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,041
You don't seriously
want to leave

113
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:18,625
that cat-in-heat alone
with Kio, do you?

114
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:21,916
Oh, no, what if she
shares a tent with Kakazu?

115
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:35,750
Whoa...! This bad boy
has some pick-me up...

116
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,541
Talk about
a need for speed!

117
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,166
I take it you like it?

118
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,375
That's not all
I like, honey...

119
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:42,958
Oh, yeah!

120
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:04,375
Good morning,
everybody!

121
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:07,375
Oh, yeah, good
morning, Kakazu.

122
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,166
Hey, what's wrong?

123
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:16,291
I thought we were
going by bus.

124
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,791
I'll give her this much:
the girl does live in style.

125
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:21,000
Attention all squadrons...

126
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:24,750
Maintain current
positions and stay alert.

127
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,208
We're now assigning cars!

128
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:28,583
All units, follow your
leader's instructions...

129
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:30,958
There are five
people per vehicle.

130
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:32,583
Are you sure we
should do this?

131
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:35,583
Administration said
suit ourselves.

132
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,791
Someone please tell me why
people like this only show up

133
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,375
when I'm in charge?

134
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,875
What's the big deal...?
Our food and travel is free,

135
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:45,708
plus we got hot maids
taking care of us.

136
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:47,458
Try and divide
yourselves up equally...

137
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:49,041
And I'm sorry.

138
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,875
One of you poor things...

139
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:53,833
is gonna have to
ride with her.

140
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:54,833
Hittin' the road!

141
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,375
With a little kitty!

142
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:57,791
Move out!

143
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,791
We're so glad
you joined...

144
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:06,541
Having a few more girls around
will be nice for a change.

145
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,958
Before you two, Arisa and
I were the only girls...

146
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:11,833
It'll be nice to see things
a little bit more evened out.

147
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:14,416
Well... For me and Aoi,
it's just our job.

148
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,333
But it must be
pretty difficult.

149
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:17,833
Oh, come on...

150
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:20,250
You're both
after him, right?

151
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,000
You can try to play dumb,
but we can tell...

152
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:26,750
You two are both in love
with Kio, aren't you?

153
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,833
That... That isn't even
close to the truth...

154
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,125
Kio and I are friends and that's
all we're ever gonna be...

155
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:34,083
And besides, Aoi's the one
who's in love with him, not me!

156
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:35,541
What...?!
Manami!

157
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:37,125
Yep, totally called it.

158
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:39,833
No...! That's so not true,
I swear...! You're wrong...!

159
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,750
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

160
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,958
Uh... Okay,
take it easy.

161
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,708
Come on... Are you sure you
don't like him, Aoi...?

162
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,083
People have been saying

163
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:49,625
they see you guys
hanging out alone a lot.

164
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,250
And he is quite the catch...

165
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:53,666
Seems like he's especially
popular with the girls, lately.

166
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,416
Huh?! But he's nerdy,
and wears glasses,

167
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,875
and he's so
wishy- washy...!

168
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,291
And all he ever
wants for dinner

169
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:00,708
are those stupid
cup noodles.

170
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,250
Well, he may be a nerd...

171
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,625
But he's an individual,
and that's rare.

172
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,708
He's sweet, and kind,
and decent...

173
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,958
Sure he's not perfect,
but he has got the potential

174
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:13,125
to grow up into
a really great man.

175
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,208
Having an alien around
must make you nervous...

176
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:17,041
I wouldn't want to have
to compete with her.

177
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:19,458
I know, right?
A sexy alien cat girl...?

178
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,916
That's basically like
winning the nerd lottery.

179
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,333
Kio really
does have it made!

180
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:29,250
Intelligent cheela living
in a neutron star...!

181
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:30,500
Oh, joy...!

182
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,541
Those are
what I call aliens!

183
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,416
She's fallen asleep.

184
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,583
She was so excited
about coming with you.

185
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:39,333
I don't think My Lady
slept a wink all night.

186
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:42,541
She is quite taken
with you, Miss Eris.

187
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:45,250
She's really been looking
forward to this, then?

188
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:46,833
Oh, yes...

189
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:49,333
It's been a long time since
I've seen her this happy...

190
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:52,458
For that matter,
Sara, too.

191
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:53,708
My precious kitty!

192
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:55,750
Are you too cold
out here?!

193
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:58,500
Oh, that's wonderful!

194
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:02,083
I love you so much!

195
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,500
So much, in fact,
that Sara didn't realize

196
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:07,208
she took the
wrong highway.

197
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,791
Attention all units,
attention all units,...

198
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,791
This is the tenth incident.

199
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:13,041
Computer, television,
cell phone,

200
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:15,000
and a DVD player.

201
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:16,875
Why, the nerve of
those criminals!

202
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:20,000
Everything they took
was brand spanking new!

203
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,166
Could it be a ring
of kid thieves?

204
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,791
You'd have
to be a kindergartner

205
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,708
or smaller
to get in there...

206
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,583
And it's weird they
didn't touch the money.

207
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:29,750
All they were after
was electronic stuff.

208
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:32,833
If you ask me, it was imps
or gremlins that did this!

209
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,458
I haven't heard that
one in a good while.

210
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:37,250
Should we nail voodoo dolls
to a tree to fend them off?

211
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,958
Bombshells From the Sky.

212
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:00,125
So pretty!

213
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,083
Well, I suppose we should
pitch the tents...?

214
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:04,208
We'll need a good place
to change into our swimsuits!

215
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:05,375
Swimsuits?!

216
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,541
Nobody said anything
about swimsuits!

217
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,375
Yeah, this is video club...

218
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:10,500
Not swim camp!

219
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,791
Oh, we still plan
to shoot some video...

220
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:15,708
But that doesn't mean
we can't fun while--

221
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:18,041
Why the hell'd you fail
to mention this until now!

222
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,166
Manami, please stop!
You're choking me...?!

223
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,208
I can't breathe!
Seriously, I'm sorry!

224
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:24,208
Okay!

225
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:25,750
How dumb are you...?

226
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:28,125
Don't you know girls have to
plan for these types of outings?

227
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:29,333
I said sorry.

228
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:31,833
Jeez, why are you always
so violent with me?

229
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,208
What am I gonna wear?

230
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,416
Don't ask me.
I didn't bring a suit, either.

231
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,625
No need to worry.

232
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:43,250
Arrangements have been
made for both of you.

233
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,583
If I could be in that
tent right now...

234
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,958
I swear... I could die
with no regrets.

235
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:53,291
You'd be dead long
before you got that far.

236
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:56,458
Those sexy maids would shoot
you without thinking twice.

237
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,208
I like that one!

238
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:02,583
That one's nice, too!

239
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,541
This is the one!

240
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,333
Um, I think, no.

241
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:10,416
Miss Eris...

242
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,416
See this one?
It's so cute...!

243
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,333
I like it much better
than the others!

244
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,291
Since we're here,
I might as well try it on.

245
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:17,625
Amazing...

246
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:19,625
These are designer
brands, aren't they?

247
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:20,875
Antonia...

248
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,875
Is it okay if we
try some on, too?

249
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,333
Uh... Well...

250
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:26,583
It's fine, as long as
Miss Eris doesn't need it...

251
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,166
She gets what
she wants first!

252
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,250
You mean it?!

253
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:32,791
Thank you so much,
you're the best!

254
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,583
This one is okay...

255
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:37,750
But it might be a
little too subdued.

256
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,625
It's cute, but not
really your style.

257
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,000
Jackpot!

258
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:44,208
This is just the kinda
thing you're looking for!

259
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,791
You want me to wear
this...? No way.

260
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,875
Oh, relax...
Sure, it's a bit risqué,

261
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:51,875
but I've seen you wear
much, much worse.

262
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:54,083
No, please!
Not again!

263
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,833
Sorry to keep
you waiting.

264
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,833
Hey, Kio!

265
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,791
What do you think
of my swimsuit?

266
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:09,208
Uh... Well, I...
It looks very nice.

267
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:11,708
What are you
blushing for, huh?

268
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,583
Listen, you've gotta
wear something sexier,

269
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:16,208
or you're gonna lose
him to the cat girl!

270
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:17,541
I'm sorry...

271
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,708
But this swimsuit is all
that I'm comfortable with.

272
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,875
Miss Eris,
you look great...!

273
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:24,291
Like flowers springing
up on the beach!

274
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:27,416
Ta-da!

275
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,041
Okay, be honest:
How do we look?

276
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:38,208
Whoa...
Wasn't expecting that.

277
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:39,916
Was I right, or
was I right...?

278
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,916
I told you these
suits were great!

279
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,291
Aiko...! You put your
suit on backwards!

280
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:49,875
Eris's tail hole, it's-

281
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:52,125
Wait, then that means ...

282
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,750
I don't wanna know
what that's for.

283
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:06,208
You're really
good at this.

284
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:09,166
Better than a pro.

285
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,500
Only 'cause you're
such a good teacher...

286
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,500
Thanks, Kakazu.

287
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,541
Well, well!

288
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,708
They're getting
on just fine.

289
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,458
I just hope...

290
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,333
It isn't too late.

291
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:30,125
Oh, this is so delicious!

292
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:31,833
The flavors of the
high-quality meats

293
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:34,875
brought out by simple
seasonings are amazing!

294
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:35,958
Here, Miss Eris...

295
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,416
Say... ah!

296
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,041
Ah!

297
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,250
This meat is
so incredible...!

298
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,625
It's the best thing
I've ever eaten!

299
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:46,291
Uh, ma'am...? I think
there's enough for everyone.

300
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,416
Don't care.
This is spectacular!

301
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,125
Here you go, Kakazu.

302
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:52,833
Thanks, Aoi,
that's nice of you.

303
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:55,208
Oh, please, I should
be thanking you...

304
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,250
You really did teach
me a lot today.

305
00:14:57,333 --> 00:15:00,000
Ah... no biggie...

306
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,666
Oh...!
Almost forgot.

307
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,791
What?

308
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,208
Nothing important,...

309
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:07,000
but I do have a favor
I wanna ask of you.

310
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:08,708
You mind?

311
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:11,041
Uh...
A favor, huh...?

312
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:13,208
Is it something you have
to ask me right here and now?

313
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,625
What...? Not really,
I guess it can wait.

314
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:16,875
In that case...

315
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,916
You mind if we take a walk?

316
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,750
The moon's pretty, huh?

317
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,875
Sure is.

318
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,333
I'm sorry, Aoi.

319
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:39,375
But this can't wait.

320
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:41,041
Look, here's the thing.

321
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,416
I've been thinking about
this for a good while...

322
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,333
But I don't think I can keep
it to myself any longer.

323
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:48,791
It's you...

324
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:50,583
You're the only one.

325
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,791
Kakazu, you-

326
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,041
Point is...

327
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:58,166
And this is kind of
embarrassing, but--

328
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,625
Go on.

329
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,416
I want you.

330
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,791
I want you to teach
me how to fight!

331
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,791
Huh?

332
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,250
The project is complete.

333
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:21,208
Finally...
A new model of Unya,

334
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,583
one closer to an
actual Assistroid.

335
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:24,833
Unatan!

336
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:26,791
The Lady is waiting
for this... Hurry!

337
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:29,291
Right...!
Prepare start-up tests!

338
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:35,875
Hey...
Where's Aoi?

339
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,208
Oh, uh...

340
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:38,958
She said she wanted to
be alone for a bit...

341
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,875
Wonder what's going on?

342
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,208
Oh, Kio... What did
you say to her.

343
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,750
I'm so dumb...

344
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:52,250
Why would he like me,
I'm a cold-blooded killer.

345
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,875
It's too late for me.

346
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:00,000
There's no way.

347
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:02,041
Better hurry and eat
or it'll all be gone...

348
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:05,000
Here, these are for you.

349
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:08,500
Hey...
Where'd Kio go?

350
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:09,666
Uh... Wait!

351
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,208
Don't you want some?

352
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,500
No thanks.

353
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,416
But they're delicious.

354
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,250
You wanna know something?

355
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:22,791
I hate you!

356
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,208
All of you...

357
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:26,416
With your curves in
all the right places.

358
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,083
Your stupid, alien cat
ears and furry tail.

359
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:30,833
And you always being so cute
and nice to everybody

360
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,458
all the time...!
And...

361
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,666
Kakazu just
freakin' eats it up.

362
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,916
Aoi, I'm sorry.

363
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,125
You're horrible...
You are...

364
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:43,333
Because I was in love with
him before you ever got here!

365
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:46,083
You ruined everything.

366
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,166
And you don't even
have a clue...

367
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,250
Since you showed up,
things have been terrible...!

368
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:54,291
Fine, so I don't know much
about TV or manga...

369
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:57,458
And I can't cook...!
I don't have friends...

370
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,458
I can't compete
with you at all!

371
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,416
I understand, Aoi...

372
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,333
Kio means more to you
than anything else.

373
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,750
Yes, he does!

374
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,041
I could get
through any mission

375
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:08,083
because I knew Kakazu
would be there...!

376
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,708
And I gave it up.

377
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,166
I threw away my
whole career...

378
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,625
I sacrificed
everything for him...!

379
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:16,000
Which is...
why I...

380
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:20,000
Aww...

381
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,833
We're the same,
you and I.

382
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:25,125
Kio always makes
me feel at ease.

383
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:28,291
I can... relax,
I guess would be the word.

384
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:29,541
When I'm with him,

385
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:33,000
it's like I'm in my
favorite ray of sunlight.

386
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:34,416
Dammit, you're right!

387
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,625
We are alike!

388
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,458
This is so good!

389
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:39,666
The meat's so tender,
it melts in your mouth!

390
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,375
Wow!

391
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:42,791
What is this,
Grade A...?!

392
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:44,083
It's delicious...!

393
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,375
This stuff has gotta
be real expensive, right?

394
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,583
Yeah, uh...

395
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:49,375
Who might you be, exactly?

396
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:52,250
Hello. It's a pleasure
to meet you, my name is Ichika!

397
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:55,291
Ichika?

398
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,500
Sure is nice being young...

399
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:58,791
This fella must
be quite special

400
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:01,666
to be this
infatuated over.

401
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,333
That's none
of your business.

402
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:04,833
Oh, so...?

403
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:07,208
Should I not tell
you he needs help?

404
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,000
Kio, no!

405
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,125
Hang back just a sec.

406
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,708
Enemy attack!
Mountainside, two o'clock!

407
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:23,333
All units,
defensive positions...!

408
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:24,666
Sara, move out!

409
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,875
Roger!

410
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,291
An old tire?!

411
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:41,916
That's my camera!

412
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,625
Yun-Fat...!
After them!

413
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,125
Hey, wait!

414
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,250
Guys!

415
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:57,708
Kio, look...!
Over there!

416
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:26,083
What do you think you're
doing to my little kitties?!

417
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:39,125
Is everyone all right?

418
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:40,666
Yeah, we're all just fine.

419
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,500
Thanks, you saved our butts.

420
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:44,125
How'd you do that?

421
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:46,958
It's all thanks to these
things I got from Ichika.

422
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:50,000
Who's Ichika?

423
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:53,208
Love those Accel
Form cards.

424
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,875
They work like a
charm every time.

425
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:01,916
What is this thing...?
A homemade catapult?

426
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,541
Pretty crafty design.

427
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,458
They made a winch using
suspension springs

428
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:07,750
and a starter from
a car or truck.

429
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,375
I swear we've seen these
Assistroids before...

430
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:13,041
They look like the ones that
got aboard Antonia's ship.

431
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,458
But the ship sunk; didn't
they go down with it?

432
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:18,208
They must have traveled
here along the sea floor...

433
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:19,833
Unlike our Assistroids,
they don't have the ability

434
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:21,583
to self- regenerate...

435
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,333
So it looks like they're
using Earth electronics

436
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:24,916
for repairs.

437
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,125
That explains why they were
trying to steal the cameras.

438
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:29,083
Crafty sons-of-bitches.

439
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:30,875
Wow... Looks like
there's someone out there

440
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:33,291
who doesn't leave
their friends behind.

441
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,166
Aoi,...
I wanted to...

442
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,583
What's up...?
Is something wrong?

443
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,166
I meant what I asked you...

444
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,083
Teach me to fight.

445
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,500
I need-- because of
things like last night--

446
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:45,000
I need to be able
to protect you guys.

447
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:50,541
"They were all brilliant,
admirable and beyond heroic...

448
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:53,083
Though inorganic, worthy
of praise they are...

449
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:55,708
See that thou know this
and rebuke them not"...

450
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:57,250
Ichika.

451
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:59,791
What the hell is this?

452
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:36,875
Aoi and Manami play cat
and mouse in the woods,

453
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:38,375
but things become
dog-eat-dog

454
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,250
when Janes sends a
sniper after them.

455
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:43,250
Will the girls defeat the
snipers or become dog meat...?

456
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:45,333
Next time...
"We Had a Duel!"

457
00:23:45,416 --> 00:23:48,125
I'm coming
to drop in on you!
