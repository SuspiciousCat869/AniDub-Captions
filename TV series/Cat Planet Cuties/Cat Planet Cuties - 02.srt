1
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:11,583
The visitor
who came from far away

2
00:00:11,666 --> 00:00:14,625
made a few new friends.

3
00:00:14,708 --> 00:00:17,208
However...

4
00:00:17,291 --> 00:00:20,000
Dammit, she looked
more like a cosplayer!

5
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:21,666
An alien shouldn't
look like that;

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,375
it should be some type
of mind-based creature!

7
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:26,208
A silicon-based lifeform with
a bio-acceleration device,

8
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:28,291
or a sentient
mechanical being,

9
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:30,875
maybe even something with a
radiosymmetrical exoskeleton,

10
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:32,750
but not like her!

11
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:34,083
Come on!

12
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:35,666
An alien's appearance
should be so awe-inspiring

13
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,500
that you know without
a doubt it's an emissary

14
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:39,125
sent from the cosmos!

15
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:41,291
Instead, I encounter one
that even Trekkies

16
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,958
would have a hard time
accepting as real!

17
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:50,625
We will achieve
Beautiful Contact!

18
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:53,166
We will achieve
Beautiful Contact!

19
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,625
And rest assured, ma'am, this
creature that you've described,

20
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:59,291
She will not be mankind's
first contact with alien life!

21
00:01:01,916 --> 00:01:03,208
I love this food!

22
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:04,458
It's so delicious!

23
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:06,625
By what term do you
call this dish again?

24
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:09,500
Well, here in Okinawa,
we call it yakiniku.

25
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:13,000
The meat's so tender, and
I love the grilled taste!

26
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:14,541
Plus, the so-called
teriyaki sauce

27
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:17,041
and the grease from the meat
give the rice a yummy flavor!

28
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:18,458
It's "purr-fect!"

29
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:21,250
This particular dish It's
the yummiest one yet!

30
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:25,041
Oh, I'm so happy
that I came to Earth!

31
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:33,833
So, Eris, what led your
people to explore space?

32
00:01:33,916 --> 00:01:35,916
We thought it was time
to extend relations

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,541
to the other planets
in the universe.

34
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:40,083
We inhabitants of Catia

35
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:42,208
felt like our world
had come to a standstill,

36
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:45,000
not just genetically,
but culturally as well.

37
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:46,791
Oh, so that's why?

38
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:50,541
Yep. For seventy thousand years,
our society stayed the same,

39
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:53,333
so it was time to wash
off the stagnation.

40
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:54,625
We journeyed into space,

41
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:56,833
to give other races
a peek at our culture,

42
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:58,375
and to get
an eyeful of theirs.

43
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:00,500
We're really hoping that
if we show you ours,

44
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:02,291
you'll show us yours!

45
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:04,833
This looks and sounds more
like a late-night cable movie

46
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,666
than a surveillance feed.

47
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,041
What's our
next step, Jack?

48
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:12,166
We launch an op to
nab the alley cat

49
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,875
who's moved in with
your little friend there.

50
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:15,083
Oh, and before I forget,

51
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:17,375
I did get permission
for you to tag along.

52
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:21,541
Space exploration, huh?

53
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:23,375
I'm really jealous.

54
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:25,708
But why, Kio?

55
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:28,125
You've got a cool job
you seem to really enjoy

56
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:29,916
I must be the only
person I know who

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,708
doesn't have a
profession picked out yet.

58
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:32,958
Really?

59
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:35,291
Yeah. Manami's even
trying to get a position

60
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:37,708
at the American Air
Force base in town.

61
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:40,083
I'm not yet familiar
with your world's economy,

62
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:42,375
but I'm sure you'll find
a job that you'll like

63
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:43,666
and that compensates
you well.

64
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,791
You really think so?

65
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:47,208
Yes. Just don't
give up, 'kay?

66
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:50,875
That reminds me.

67
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:54,416
Hey, Kio, speaking
of compensation...

68
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,875
Yeah, what?

69
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:59,291
Ahh... You've done so much
for me since I arrived here

70
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:01,708
and given the social
structure of your planet,

71
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:05,458
it's only fair that pay I you
some form of compensation.

72
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:06,916
That's not necessary.

73
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,458
It is, but until our worlds'
relations are formalized,

74
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:11,291
I can't offer you
any money.

75
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:12,541
I can only offer you

76
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,750
an alternate form
of payment instead...

77
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,916
And according to
the materials I read

78
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,625
and the scenarios they
depicted, the optimum way to do

79
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:22,541
that would be by sharing
my body with you!

80
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:23,916
Huh?

81
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,791
Our reproductive systems
are actually quite similar.

82
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,750
I don't mind performing
the various acts,

83
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:32,041
but do you have to wear
that leather mask?

84
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:33,083
What mask?

85
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,458
Where did you learn
this stuff from?

86
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:36,583
It was in the magazines
I found under your mattress,

87
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,375
and those are guides to
human behavior, right?

88
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:39,750
Uhhh, no!

89
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:42,000
Those things are more
like, well, fiction!

90
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:45,625
What? You mean that's
not how I should behave?

91
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,000
What a relief!

92
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,250
You see, I've only just
reached my sixteenth cycle.

93
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:50,625
And to be honest,

94
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:52,958
I don't have any reproductive
act experience yet.

95
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:55,000
Hey. You know
who also doesn't?

96
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:56,000
Me.

97
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,000
Really?

98
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:58,250
Nope!

99
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,208
Barf!

100
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,291
Here, I insist.

101
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,250
No, that's okay!

102
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:13,541
Why you?

103
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:16,041
Why'd you have to get
involved in this

104
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,708
and with her
of all people, Kakazu?

105
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Yo, Kio!

106
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,333
Are you planting
something?

107
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,625
Eris said she wanted
to introduce me to someone.

108
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:28,500
But back here?

109
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:42,625
Alright,
everybody, fall in!

110
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,208
Operations check.

111
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:47,875
Dance!

112
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,833
Stand proud!

113
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:54,958
Look sad!

114
00:04:58,458 --> 00:04:59,958
Now sing!

115
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:04,041
They all appear to be
functioning normally.

116
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:04,875
Great!

117
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,958
Yeah, but... what are they?

118
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,625
They're called
Assistroids.

119
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:09,916
Here, look
They're created

120
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,250
by scattering these
nanomachine capsules.

121
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,916
And they use the soil to
fabricate the Assistroids.

122
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm going to use them
to help me with my research.

123
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,833
Can those little
guys wash windows?

124
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,791
Why does it have
to be so hot?

125
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,333
I know the perfect
thing then.

126
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:32,541
Yeah.

127
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,458
And you'll love it!

128
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:42,416
Here. Trust me, a bite of
this'll definitely cool you off.

129
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,416
What is it?

130
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,583
Just try it
and find out.

131
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:51,083
It's cold and sweet
and so very delicious!

132
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,666
What is it?

133
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,708
This?
It's ice cream.

134
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,458
You've got a different
kind than me!

135
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:57,625
Wanna try it?

136
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:59,291
I'd love to, but only
if you don't mind!

137
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:02,416
Be my guest.

138
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,291
Can we move on this?

139
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:05,791
Too many civilians around.

140
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:08,791
We'll have to wait, which
is a big part of field work.

141
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:49,458
At this rate, I should be able
to gather all the important data

142
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:51,166
on your planet
within a week.

143
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,666
Wow That's amazing.

144
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,125
It's still
so hot and muggy.

145
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:59,500
Yeah, even with the sun
going down, it's still warm.

146
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,333
Wanna get some
more ice cream?

147
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:02,875
Yes!

148
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,208
They're out.

149
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,833
It's time, Momiji.

150
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,791
Activate System.

151
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,708
That's weird.

152
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,750
There's nobody around.

153
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,458
Hey. What gives?

154
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,041
Freeze!

155
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:26,375
What the?

156
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:27,541
We bring a message

157
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,333
from the Beautiful
Contact secret society!

158
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,333
You, Alien!

159
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,750
Um, yes?

160
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:34,208
To preserve the uniqueness
of mankind's first contact

161
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:37,541
with intergalactic life, we
refuse to recognize your race!

162
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:40,416
Remove yourself from
our planet or we will!

163
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,875
The situation's
changed; stand by.

164
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:43,916
What now?

165
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,583
Let's wait and
see what happens.

166
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:49,333
Um, sir... Excuse me, but who
did you say you represent?

167
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:51,916
We're representatives
of mankind.

168
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,375
Yes, but...

169
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,625
there are billions of people
who live on this planet,

170
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,875
so which particular ones
do you folks represent?

171
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,416
You don't need
to know that!

172
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,791
Actually, I do because
I'm performing an assessment

173
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:04,291
and need current data on
this world's organizations.

174
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:06,458
Therefore I need to know all
the details on your group,

175
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,791
its membership roster,
and your identities, too.

176
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,750
So if you don't
mind, please tell me.

177
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:11,750
What? No!

178
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,000
But why not?

179
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,500
Because we're a secret
society, you dingbat!

180
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,125
Oh!

181
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:22,208
So when you say "secret"
You really mean secret.

182
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:24,375
I can't let an alien
this obtuse live!

183
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:25,458
No, stop!

184
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:26,791
Move it!

185
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:27,916
Kio, no!

186
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,458
No!

187
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:37,541
Kio!

188
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,291
What?

189
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,750
Equip S-1!

190
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:57,791
The target's your priority!

191
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,833
Yeah. Copy that.

192
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,541
Wait! No! Stop!

193
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,083
You're nimble! But dead!

194
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,875
Stop!

195
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:13,333
You leave her alone!

196
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:14,958
Kakazu.!

197
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,958
Kio! Get out of there!

198
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,625
Eris hasn't done
anything wrong,

199
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:21,333
so why are you and those
other people doing this?

200
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,375
Uh... Thank you.

201
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:34,166
Oh, thank goodness;
are you okay?

202
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,041
I'm fine. Forget me;
what about you?

203
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,166
Back to base!
We gotta go!

204
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,833
Momiji!
What are you doing?

205
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:43,250
I'm suspending the mission
based on my assessment.

206
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,166
That's not your call to make!

207
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:52,625
Eris, no!

208
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:55,583
Kakazu!

209
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,041
Kio!

210
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,083
She didn't have
to shoot Kio.

211
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:12,291
What the?

212
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,000
You okay, Kio?

213
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,625
Uncle Yuichi?

214
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,208
Where's Eris?

215
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:20,250
She was taken away
before I could get to you.

216
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,750
What?
We've gotta find her!

217
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:25,166
It sounds to me like she's
more than a friend now.

218
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,750
No, it's not just that.

219
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:29,000
Eris is a visitor
from another planet.

220
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,583
She's been threatened
and kidnapped,

221
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:34,291
what kind of impression about
Earthlings has this made on her?

222
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:35,625
We have to help her.

223
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,333
We have to show her that
someone on this planet's

224
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:38,833
on her side.

225
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,750
Manami?

226
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,083
Kio.

227
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:53,500
Hey, what's up?

228
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,416
Tell me where
they've taken Eris.

229
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,666
Huh?

230
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,250
What are you
talking about?

231
00:10:58,333 --> 00:10:59,250
"Taken?"

232
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:00,791
Where is she, Manami?

233
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,333
Why are you
asking me this?

234
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:03,875
I saw your watch
back there.

235
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:05,250
Uh...

236
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:07,250
Whoever took her had the
same type of watch as you

237
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,750
and it had a crack in
the exact same place.

238
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:14,250
That was you,
wasn't it?

239
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:15,750
Yes.

240
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:18,000
Why'd you do it, Manami?

241
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:20,500
I wanted to get some
field experience.

242
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:24,583
I'm trying to get a job at
Kadena Air Base, remember?

243
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:27,416
Or to be more precise
I'm trying to get a job

244
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,916
as a CIA field operative
on the base, Kio.

245
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,875
But still...

246
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,041
Yeah. I'm sorry.

247
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,083
Look, what's done is done.

248
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,916
You can make things
right, though.

249
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,333
Just tell me where
Eris is being held.

250
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:45,083
She's locked up in Hangar F
at Kadena Air Base.

251
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:47,333
That's not exactly the
easiest place to get into.

252
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:50,375
I've got a plan, but things
are sure to get hairy.

253
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:53,041
Uh. What is this?

254
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,750
Smith and Wesson M686.

255
00:11:56,833 --> 00:12:00,541
It shoots tranquilizer rounds;
I use it for work.

256
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:05,083
Um... Uncle Yuichi what
do you do for a living?

257
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:06,333
You're done here.

258
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:10,041
This operation is now
under our jurisdiction.

259
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,416
Wow, you Defense Intelligence
Agency boys sure

260
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,875
have some nerve.

261
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:15,375
Come now.

262
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:18,250
Both your CIA and my DIA are
both servants of the people,

263
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,000
aren't they?

264
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,541
But I serve
a different breed.

265
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,375
Hello, are you
the lieutenant?

266
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:29,125
Yeah, Lieutenant Fujioka.

267
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,833
Hi, Aoi speaking.

268
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,041
Um, hey, Aoi, it's Kio.

269
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:34,916
Oh... Hi!

270
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,041
Listen, I know we made plans
to get together tomorrow.

271
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:40,375
But I won't be able
to make it now.

272
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:41,708
What?

273
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:43,208
I'm sorry, but I've got
to take care of something

274
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,500
and I don't know
when I'll be back.

275
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:46,416
What's going on?

276
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,041
It's a long story.

277
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,541
Look, I'll give you
a call once I get back

278
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,208
and explain it, okay?

279
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,166
Um. Sure.

280
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,500
Thanks, Aoi.

281
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:02,750
We blew it.

282
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,791
Even so, one of my
sources told me

283
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:06,458
there's no way the
government's going to enter

284
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:07,791
into diplomatic relations.

285
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:10,208
Now they know she's Earth's
first alien contact!

286
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:15,041
Sorry to interrupt, people,
but make like ice and freeze!

287
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,375
Wait a minute;
who the hell are you?

288
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:19,583
Miss Itokazu?

289
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,625
Say "cheese!"

290
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,500
What are you doing?

291
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,250
We're gonna post these
photos on the net,

292
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:28,250
so the membership of the
Beautiful Contact secret society

293
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:31,291
isn't gonna be
so "secret" anymore.

294
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,083
Unless.

295
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:42,500
I'm sure Kio must
hate me now.

296
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:47,791
You.

297
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,375
That was easier
than I thought.

298
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,333
It's due to his
special access plate.

299
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,875
It's also got something
to do with the hour, too.

300
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:01,458
Most of the guys
on base are Trekkies,

301
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:04,541
so when "Star Trek's" on, they
don't pay as much attention.

302
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:12,625
Where am I?

303
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:13,666
Excuse me?

304
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,333
Hello?

305
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:16,666
Why won't they answer?

306
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,000
You have questions, huh?

307
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:22,333
Very well.

308
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:23,666
I'll answer them.

309
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,000
First, why am I here?

310
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,750
So we can terminate you.

311
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,750
Your arrival is
problematic, you see,

312
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:31,333
and I've deemed you detrimental
to our national interests.

313
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:32,750
But why the secrecy?

314
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:35,458
Why don't you officially
refuse relations with my people?

315
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:39,750
Do you have a deal
with some other race?

316
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,291
I don't have
to answer that.

317
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:43,291
No, you don't.

318
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,083
The stench
on you already has.

319
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:47,000
You smell of dog.

320
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,291
Not good!

321
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:49,833
Dealing with the Dogishuans.

322
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:52,750
That's against galactic law.
Guess you didn't know that, huh?

323
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:55,375
The only thing that you're
going to know, and very soon,

324
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:56,875
is a quick death!

325
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:02,833
What's going on?

326
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:05,250
Ka-Boom!

327
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:07,500
And Kerblooey!

328
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,750
So what now?

329
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:14,208
What do you plan
to do next, Kio?

330
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:15,833
Bust Eris
out of Hangar F.

331
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,458
No, wait!
You could get killed!

332
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,291
I'm willing to take
that risk for her sake.

333
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:23,333
Sorry, but from here on, you
two are gonna have to walk!

334
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,791
Well, it looks like that
got their attention.

335
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:41,000
I guess I can kiss my chances
of ever joining the CIA goodbye.

336
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:44,416
Yeah, ditto for my career with
the Immigration Bureau of Japan.

337
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,291
Oh, that's for you.

338
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:50,041
It's just like the MGC.

339
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:03,958
Sweet!

340
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:05,875
Yeah, I think so, too.

341
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:29,291
This is it! Hangar F!

342
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:32,416
Would someone find out what
the hell is going on outside?

343
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,708
Um, instead of that

344
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,708
I'd worry more about
what's going on inside!

345
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:38,958
What?

346
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,291
But how?

347
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,291
My outfit.

348
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,708
It's a scaled-down
power suit.

349
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,500
I only used a tiny iota
of its strength

350
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:48,708
to break free just then.

351
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:51,250
Now allow me to show
you its maximum power.

352
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:03,125
What the?

353
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:04,583
Oh, my!
Hi there!

354
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,250
Eris!

355
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:08,291
Um, Kio?

356
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,708
What are you doing here?

357
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:12,958
I heard you were captured
so I came to rescue you.

358
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,500
Wait, you mean you risked
your life to save me?

359
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,625
Yeah, but seeing
what's happened in here,

360
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:20,333
I think you might have
been fine without me.

361
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,000
Oh, thank you so very much Kio!

362
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:26,708
Please,
I can't breathe! Stop!

363
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:28,750
I would just smother
you with appreciation!

364
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:30,208
Stop! Eris!

365
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:32,875
You're smothering
me with your boobs!

366
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:38,708
Ugh!

367
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:41,916
Ah, well.
Wasn't my van!

368
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,916
Get in here quick!

369
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:51,166
Where's Kio?

370
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,250
Where are you, kid?

371
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:53,708
Eris is safe and sound.

372
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:56,625
We're headed to the runway
with Miss Itokazu right now.

373
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,000
Huh?

374
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:03,708
You lost the van
but you got a ride.

375
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,041
Hey, wait, did you say
with Aoi and Manami?

376
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:09,833
Sure did. I think they've
got a thing for ya.

377
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,500
Please tell me you have a plan
on how to escape from here.

378
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:19,208
A helicopter's picking
us up any minute now.

379
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:21,541
As long as those little
guys can fly it, that is.

380
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:22,541
What little guys?

381
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:24,416
Of course
they can fly it.

382
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,083
See, look?

383
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,291
Just keep her steady,
guys, you're almost here!

384
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:39,458
Uh-oh!
Aw dammit!

385
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:40,916
Talk about lousy luck!

386
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,208
Got any more weapons
stashed away, Aoi?

387
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,416
I do, so just leave those
mechanized battle machines

388
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,041
to us!

389
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,708
Hey, the Assistroids
survived the crash!

390
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:56,125
Well, guys, prepare to
demilitarize those vehicles!

391
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:58,500
Those things
are our targets!

392
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,208
Move forward and charge!

393
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:01,708
But they'll be destroyed!

394
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:03,041
No, they won't be Kio.

395
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:05,083
And neither will I,
trust me.

396
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,166
Eris, no!

397
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:19,250
Activate quasi-antimatter
hammers now, everybody!

398
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:23,208
Let's knock their socks off,
among other things!

399
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:58,125
The authorities covered
the incident up

400
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:01,125
by calling it an explosion
at the base's fuel depot.

401
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:04,208
So the truth was kept from
the eyes of the world.

402
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:06,750
And so, almost as if
nothing had happened,

403
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,875
the rest of Kio's summer
vacation went back

404
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,041
to how it was before
the incident.

405
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:12,791
Now that all the data's
been accumulated,

406
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,000
your duties will change.

407
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:16,875
Oh, you're not going
to the library today?

408
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:18,250
No. We've copied all

409
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:19,791
the pertinent Earth
materials already

410
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:21,833
My report's finished
so I'm done here.

411
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:24,083
Does that mean
You're leaving?

412
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:25,166
Yes.

413
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,916
Thank you for all
that you've done.

414
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,000
You're welcome, Eris.

415
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:31,500
I was really happy to help.

416
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:32,958
I also want
to let you know

417
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:35,541
how appreciative I am
of you coming to save me.

418
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,125
It was incredibly
brave of you,

419
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:40,208
and I can't tell you how
touched I was by your gesture.

420
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:42,000
Oh, don't mention it.

421
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,750
I mean, we are friends
after all, right?

422
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,916
Yeah. About that.

423
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,916
Pretty soon, I'm going
to be reaching a milestone

424
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,208
of Catian womanhood,
my first mating season.

425
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:54,375
Uh, mating season?

426
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:55,750
And well, um.

427
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,791
I've been kinda
wondering, Kio.

428
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:00,875
If I get to return to Earth,
would you mind becoming my mate?

429
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:01,916
Your mate?

430
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,708
Wait, you mean like
do it with you?

431
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:04,625
Kio!

432
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,375
Turn it on!

433
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:07,291
The TV.

434
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,583
Now. Hurry.

435
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:13,125
Whoa.

436
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:16,250
The Catian mother
ship's on Earth.

437
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,791
Hey, Eris! Are you here?

438
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:21,875
Melwin?

439
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:23,333
Chief Chaika?

440
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:26,125
Why are you here? I thought
you were still observing!

441
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:28,583
Well, after we got
the taste analysis data

442
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:31,208
for all of the Earth food that
you described in your report.

443
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,875
Everybody on the mother
ship said they couldn't wait

444
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,500
to try it for themselves.

445
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:37,583
And in fact, it was the food
that led to the big decision.

446
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:40,416
Catia has decided to formally
establish relations with Earth,

447
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,916
and we're the advanced party.

448
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,333
We hope you can provide
us with accommodations here.

449
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:46,458
Here in my house?

450
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:47,833
You're not
prepared for guests?

451
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:50,208
Don't you know
the Catian motto?

452
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:52,375
I'm going to drop by!

453
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:27,166
Just as I expected,
they failed.

454
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:30,125
I swear. These humans
are as useless as a dog

455
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,250
that won't hunt.

456
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:35,958
When a gaggle
of girls move in,

457
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:38,041
life gets more
chaotic for Kio!

458
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:41,083
Who's prowling around
the house, and oh, my!

459
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:43,541
Why aren't Aoi and Manami
wearing any clothes?

460
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:45,708
Next time:
"We've Come to Stay."

461
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:48,708
I'm coming to
drop in on you!
