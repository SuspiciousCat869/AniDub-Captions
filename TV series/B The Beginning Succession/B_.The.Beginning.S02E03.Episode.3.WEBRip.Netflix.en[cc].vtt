26
00:01:23.255 --> 00:01:24.672 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:01:41.005 --> 00:01:45.797 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:03:05.838 --> 00:03:07.797 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

<i>Eh?</i>

217
00:14:47.005 --> 00:14:51.088 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The person who ordered
the raid on Jaula Blanca that day

218
00:14:51.172 --> 00:14:52.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
is sitting right here.

219
00:14:57.213 --> 00:14:59.547 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Aha. How apropos.

220
00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:01.838 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's something I've wanted to know.

221
00:15:04.213 --> 00:15:05.713 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Why us?
-Hmm?

222
00:15:06.547 --> 00:15:09.922 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Did Dr. Kazama
not tell you children anything at all?

223
00:15:13.755 --> 00:15:14.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

224
00:15:17.297 --> 00:15:20.463 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's no reason
to hide it at this point.

225
00:15:20.547 --> 00:15:23.672 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I heard this from the lips
of the good doctor himself.

226
00:15:23.755 --> 00:15:25.672 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You mean from Dr. Kazama?

227
00:15:27.588 --> 00:15:29.755 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Everything that's happened,

228
00:15:29.838 --> 00:15:32.297 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it all started
when you children were born.

229
00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:37.047 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All of the cells in your body
can reset and regenerate,

230
00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:38.672 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
instantly, at that.

231
00:15:38.755 --> 00:15:41.672 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They can also act as a panacea,

232
00:15:41.755 --> 00:15:45.422 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but you can only transplant them
to the other children.

233
00:15:45.505 --> 00:15:47.922 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you tried the procedure
with anyone else,

234
00:15:48.005 --> 00:15:49.672 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the cells would turn cancerous.

235
00:15:50.505 --> 00:15:55.297 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's supposedly a safety mechanism
used to protect the material.

236
00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:59.713 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
However, there does exist
a key to cancel this effect...

237
00:16:00.755 --> 00:16:04.172 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
a neutral-bodied Canon
who's met a special condition.

238
00:16:04.838 --> 00:16:09.422 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In being chosen, that Canon
will transform into a female,

239
00:16:09.505 --> 00:16:12.922 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
simultaneously becoming
a key to cancel you out.

240
00:16:13.005 --> 00:16:16.088 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
With this,
it'll be possible to transplant

241
00:16:16.172 --> 00:16:20.255 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the multiplied cells
of the next generation to us humans.

242
00:16:20.338 --> 00:16:23.922 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Moreover, the blood
will drive us forever.

243
00:16:24.005 --> 00:16:26.838 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Regenerative medicine within minutes,

244
00:16:26.922 --> 00:16:30.172 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
all without even
considering compatibility.

245
00:16:30.255 --> 00:16:32.338 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Everything will change.

246
00:16:32.422 --> 00:16:34.380 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's like a dream made real.

247
00:16:34.463 --> 00:16:37.922 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And nearly all diseases
will become treatable.

248
00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:43.963 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's an enormous interest
to see what will occur from this.

249
00:16:44.047 --> 00:16:48.505 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A generation where only the rich
can afford to live is coming soon.

250
00:16:49.088 --> 00:16:51.213 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It'd be fine if it was just lives...

251
00:16:52.422 --> 00:16:56.255 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but even time
will hold no dominion over your cells.

252
00:16:56.338 --> 00:17:00.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A semi-eternal life
wouldn't be out of the question.

253
00:17:00.505 --> 00:17:04.255 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The right of the gods
would be but a matter of currency.

254
00:17:05.297 --> 00:17:09.672 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
One can scarcely imagine a dispute
over an interest such as that.

255
00:17:09.755 --> 00:17:13.338 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This country hasn't long recovered
from being but a burnt field.

256
00:17:13.422 --> 00:17:15.505 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Under the Defeated Country Clause,

257
00:17:15.588 --> 00:17:20.463 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you couldn't develop a decent military
or weapons for this nation.

258
00:17:20.547 --> 00:17:24.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Therefore, you used
human weapons called Reggie.

259
00:17:25.088 --> 00:17:26.963 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They were a necessary evil.

260
00:17:27.047 --> 00:17:29.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Canons are overkill, right?

261
00:17:29.963 --> 00:17:32.255 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Isn't that the conclusion you came to?

262
00:17:35.088 --> 00:17:39.088 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you disposed of us early on,
there'd be no conflict.

263
00:17:39.172 --> 00:17:42.297 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's why, to uphold national ethics.

264
00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:44.297 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's what the raid was for?

265
00:17:45.297 --> 00:17:49.547 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I get it. You were trying to protect
your greater interests.

266
00:17:50.047 --> 00:17:51.047 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Although...

267
00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:58.547 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you couldn't see that,
just as your heart beats, so do ours.

268
00:18:02.505 --> 00:18:06.588 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Lily] There are some people who may
believe in that kind of one-sided justice.

269
00:18:07.172 --> 00:18:09.797 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Highness, what you did was murder.

270
00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:11.297 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's no getting around it.

271
00:18:15.505 --> 00:18:19.713 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
May sentience reincarnate
and be born from the six paths,

272
00:18:19.797 --> 00:18:23.672 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and may the wheel
remain ever-turning for all of time.

273
00:18:24.838 --> 00:18:28.380 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm well aware that this will
do little to atone for my sins,

274
00:18:28.463 --> 00:18:30.630 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but please allow me to help you.

275
00:18:30.713 --> 00:18:31.713 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Huh?

276
00:18:31.797 --> 00:18:33.338 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[gasps]

277
00:18:33.422 --> 00:18:38.422 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
After that, my life will once again
be in your capable hands.

278
00:18:42.922 --> 00:18:44.672 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where could Keith be?

279
00:18:44.755 --> 00:18:46.963 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe inside the Royal Palace?

280
00:18:47.047 --> 00:18:48.838 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He'd likely have a card up his sleeve,

281
00:18:48.922 --> 00:18:51.338 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
in case there was
a good opportunity for him to pull it.

282
00:18:51.422 --> 00:18:55.297 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was thinking the same thing,
but I didn't find any signs of that.

283

[Yuna gasps]

284
00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:00.838 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A place they wouldn't need
to keep an eye on all day,

285
00:19:00.922 --> 00:19:03.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but where they could be confident
he wouldn't be snatched from.

286
00:19:04.463 --> 00:19:06.380 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They must have their own domain.

287
00:19:06.463 --> 00:19:07.797 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Most likely.

288
00:19:09.047 --> 00:19:10.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How about the Amo District?

289
00:19:10.963 --> 00:19:12.172 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Eh?

290
00:19:13.213 --> 00:19:15.630 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[king] This area is military managed.

291
00:19:15.713 --> 00:19:18.672 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Since it's used
strictly for military exercises,

292
00:19:18.755 --> 00:19:21.797 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
general officials
aren't allowed to set foot there.

293
00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:24.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
With no one around,
it makes the place a natural prison.

294
00:19:24.963 --> 00:19:26.588 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We may have just found it.

295
00:19:26.672 --> 00:19:29.672 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You people
don't understand Kirisame one bit.

296
00:19:29.755 --> 00:19:30.922 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What do you mean?

297
00:19:31.547 --> 00:19:36.713 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The man treats logic like an epic love,
making this a double standard.

298
00:19:36.797 --> 00:19:39.713 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're thinking way too inside the box.

299
00:19:39.797 --> 00:19:42.505 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And just what exactly
are you trying to imply?

300
00:19:42.588 --> 00:19:44.672 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

301
00:19:44.755 --> 00:19:47.922 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why do I have to be surrounded
by all of these weirdos?

302
00:19:48.505 --> 00:19:51.255 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yuna, you're my only
ray of hope in this mad--

303
00:19:51.338 --> 00:19:52.672 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Lily.
-Eh?

304
00:19:52.755 --> 00:19:54.380 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's about Koku.

305
00:19:54.463 --> 00:19:56.422 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Kirisame wants him to be a hit man.

306
00:19:56.505 --> 00:19:58.088 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

307
00:19:59.588 --> 00:20:03.047 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's right.
He's not just confining them away.

308
00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:06.172 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're being used as fodder
to initiate Koku.

309
00:20:06.838 --> 00:20:08.963 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's because he's our one true king.

310
00:20:09.047 --> 00:20:13.172 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Kirisame believed in Jetblack
more deeply than anyone else.

311
00:20:17.755 --> 00:20:19.463 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Lily] Let's check ancient ruins.

312
00:20:19.547 --> 00:20:21.380 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There are so many.

313
00:20:21.463 --> 00:20:23.380 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We don't have time to go to each one.

314
00:20:23.463 --> 00:20:24.963 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We'll have to narrow them down.

315
00:20:25.547 --> 00:20:28.130 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Here's a thought.
Wouldn't it be a location

316
00:20:28.213 --> 00:20:30.713 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that had the deepest connection
to the Black Winged King?

317
00:20:30.797 --> 00:20:32.380 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Kazhan.
-Huh?

318
00:20:32.463 --> 00:20:36.088 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He said he was having him rest
in a special place,

319
00:20:36.172 --> 00:20:38.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
a great place. It was near the ocean,

320
00:20:38.963 --> 00:20:42.047 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and if he had wings,
it would be the ultimate paradise.

321
00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:43.213 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
