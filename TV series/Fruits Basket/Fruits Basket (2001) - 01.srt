1
00:00:14,958 --> 00:00:18,166
<i>I was so happy when you smiled,</i>

2
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,750
<i>Your smile breaks</i>
<i>through the clouds of grey,</i>

3
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:28,666
<i>Far from the sunny days</i>
<i>that lie in sleep.</i>

4
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,625
<i>Waiting with patience</i>
<i>for the Spring,</i>

5
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:35,625
<i>when the flowers will</i>
<i>bloom renewed again,</i>

6
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:42,666
<i>knowing there's more</i>
<i>beyond the pain of today.</i>

7
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:49,041
<i>Although the scars</i>
<i>of yesterday remain,</i>

8
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:56,500
<i>You can go on living as</i>
<i>much as your heart believes.</i>

9
00:00:56,583 --> 00:01:03,000
<i>You can't be born again</i>
<i>although you can change.</i>

10
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:09,708
<i>Let's stay together always.</i>

11
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:34,000
Look at that beautiful sky!

12
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:40,541
See you later, Mom! Take care of
the house while I'm gone, okay?

13
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:42,750
I'll be back!

14
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:47,708
<i>Hello! My name is Tohru Honda. I</i>
<i>haven't always lived in a tent.</i>

15
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:50,000
<i>Up until last May,</i>
<i>I lived with my Mom.</i>

16
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:53,958
<i>It was just the two of us.</i>
<i>But then the accident...</i>

17
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:57,583
<i>After I lost Mom, I began</i>
<i>secretly living here, on my own.</i>

18
00:01:57,666 --> 00:02:00,458
<i>It's not exactly</i>
<i>comfortable, but it's alright.</i>

19
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:02,083
<i>And it's what I have to do.</i>

20
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:05,041
<i>Like my motto says:</i>
<i>"Never give up!"</i>

21
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:12,583
<i>Look at this, Mom. Did you</i>
<i>know there was a house here?</i>

22
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:17,083
<i>It seems so peaceful.</i>
<i>Must be nice.</i>

23
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:22,125
<i>How cute! The twelve</i>
<i>animals of the Zodiac!</i>

24
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:23,500
My word...

25
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:25,708
Do my eyes deceive me,

26
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:30,375
or is there a strange young
girl standing on my porch?

27
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:33,250
Ah, I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!
I was just looking!

28
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:35,125
I didn't mean to barge
in without permission.

29
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:37,291
It's all right...

30
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:39,916
I'd just set them out
to dry... No harm done.

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,833
But, I find it hard
to believe that

32
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:44,000
these silly little things
could attract your interest...

33
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:47,583
No, I really like them. I don't
think they're silly at all!

34
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:50,041
Yes, well... I must admit,

35
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:52,750
I'm particularly
fond of them myself.

36
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:56,583
Oh. But I should have known...
You left out the cat.

37
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:59,416
The cat?  Ahhh...

38
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,250
I take it you're referring
to the old folktale

39
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,000
of the Chinese Zodiac?

40
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:07,791
Uh huh... My mom told it
to me when I was little.

41
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:10,041
<i>A long, long time ago,</i>

42
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:13,666
<i>God decided to invite all</i>
<i>of the animals to a banquet...</i>

43
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,750
<i>He sent out word</i>
<i>for all of them</i>

44
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:18,500
<i>to come to his house</i>
<i>the following evening...</i>

45
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,458
<i>"and don't be late!" he said.</i>

46
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:23,250
<i>When the mischievous</i>
<i>rat heard the news,</i>

47
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:26,708
<i>he decided to play a trick</i>
<i>on his neighbor, the cat.</i>

48
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:30,416
<i>He told the cat that the party</i>
<i>was the day after tomorrow.</i>

49
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,791
<i>The very next day,</i>

50
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:34,958
<i>all of the animals lined</i>
<i>up for the celebration.</i>

51
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:37,083
<i>And the rat led the way,</i>

52
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:39,750
<i>riding all the way there</i>
<i>on the back of the cow.</i>

53
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,666
<i>Everyone had a wonderful time.</i>

54
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:45,833
<i>Except for the foolish cat.</i>
<i>Who missed the whole thing.</i>

55
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,875
Hey, why are you crying?

56
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:53,375
Because... that poor cat...
he must be so lonely.

57
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:57,750
I know, I won't be a dog
anymore! I'll be a cat, too!

58
00:03:57,833 --> 00:04:02,041
Funny... I wonder what he'll
say when he hears he has a fan.

59
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:03,083
H-He?

60
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:04,583
You were born in
the Year of the Dog?

61
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,208
I knew there was
something I liked about you,

62
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:08,791
aside from your pretty fa--

63
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,833
Please forgive my
cousin, Miss Honda.

64
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:14,875
He's a bit of a flirt,
but he's harmless...

65
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:17,333
In general, it's usually
best to just ignore him.

66
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:20,583
Ah, Yuki Sohma!

67
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,583
<i>Oh, Mom, I don't believe it!</i>

68
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:24,125
<i>The prince of my high school,</i>

69
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:27,750
<i>Yuki Sohma is standing right</i>
<i>here, before my very eyes!</i>

70
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:30,666
<i>And I'm standing</i>
<i>in front of his house!</i>

71
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,750
A dictionary?

72
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,958
No. I have two of them.

73
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:42,750
So- you're one of
Yuki's classmates from school.

74
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:45,083
Let's start again.
I'm Shigure,

75
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:47,208
his older and much
less violent cousin.

76
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,083
Hi, it's very nice to meet you!

77
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:51,625
And what brings you to our
home this morning, Miss Honda?

78
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,875
Well, you know I live...
nearby...

79
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:56,416
You do? Where at?

80
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,125
Uhh, right!

81
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,916
Okay, I think I'll just be going
now. It was nice to meet you-

82
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,750
Wait, Miss Honda!

83
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:06,541
Since you're here, why
don't we walk together?

84
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:11,291
L - O - V - E!
We- love- Yu-ki!

85
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:12,875
Yuki! Yuki!

86
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,250
Yuki?!

87
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,083
Okay. Start Talking.

88
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:23,791
What was that all
about, Miss Tohru?

89
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,916
Why were you walking to
school with Prince Yuki?

90
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,583
Details!
And they better be good.

91
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,583
It... It was just
a coincidence...

92
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:31,583
Well for your sake,
I hope that's all it was!

93
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:34,250
Every girl at Kaiwaia
High, Class 1-D knows

94
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,916
Yuki Sohma's the best
looking boy in school!

95
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,125
And he's intelligent!

96
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:39,416
And great at sports!

97
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,958
And for your info we are
the Prince Yuki Fan Club!

98
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,250
We've got first dibs, sister,
so you better stay clear!

99
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:44,750
Hey!

100
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,041
What?!

101
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,666
She said it was a coincidence.

102
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:52,125
Now get lost... before those big
noses of yours get bruised...

103
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,750
Now, hold it, Yankee!

104
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,791
You're not gonna scare us
with that 'street thug' talk!

105
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,000
One more word,
and you'll all get...

106
00:05:59,083 --> 00:05:59,708
[Beep]

107
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:01,333
...with electric shocks.

108
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,291
Thanks, I didn't
think they'd ever leave!

109
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:08,750
Were those catty little
girls bothering you? Aww.

110
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:11,875
Hana, don't actually
shock anyone, okay?

111
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,333
You know the truth is,

112
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,458
I was so nervous walking
with Yuki this morning.

113
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:21,125
I couldn't talk to him-
no, I couldn't even look at him.

114
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:25,125
I sense strange electric
signals coming from that boy.

115
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:28,000
Here we go again,
Hana's Electric Report.

116
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,000
Strange how?

117
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,375
I don't know. He's different.

118
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:32,750
Well, I admit

119
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,708
he does seem to have an
air of mystery about him...

120
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:37,083
And there are some weird
stories floating around, too...

121
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:40,416
I hear one of those Fan Club
girls tried to ask him out once,

122
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,875
but he just pushed her away...

123
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:44,166
And I mean that literally.
Right in the hall.

124
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,500
Then he left her on
the floor and ran off.

125
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:50,958
Like I said, I sense
strange electric signals.

126
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,500
Let's talk about something else?

127
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:53,916
How's that job of yours going?

128
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,750
Oh, fine I guess. Why?

129
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,250
I don't know...

130
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,125
You've been putting
in a lot of hours lately.

131
00:06:59,208 --> 00:06:59,958
A lot more than usual.

132
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,000
Uhh... Yeah. Sure.

133
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:04,750
You're having trouble saving
up for your tuition, aren't you?

134
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,833
No it's just... well... yeah.

135
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:10,750
That's odd... I didn't think
tuition here was that expensive.

136
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:13,458
And I don't remember you
having to work this hard before.

137
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:15,708
Unless, something
else has changed?

138
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,333
No... everything's the sa--

139
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:19,625
So what is it? You in some kind
of trouble? You owe somebody?

140
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,333
Your grandfather's giving
you enough to eat, right?

141
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:22,791
He isn't taking your money?

142
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:23,708
Mm, mm!

143
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,625
I know, I worry too much...

144
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:28,291
But seriously, if you need me
to rough someone up for you,

145
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:29,875
you just say the word. Got it?

146
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:31,208
Okay.

147
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:33,708
<i>Uo's going to kill me</i>
<i>when she finds out...</i>

148
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:36,750
<i>But how can I tell my two best</i>
<i>friends that I live in a tent?</i>

149
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:40,083
<i>I can still remember how tough</i>
<i>it was on Mom after Dad died.</i>

150
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:43,166
<i>She had to work</i> so <i>hard</i>
<i>just to make ends meet.</i>

151
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,833
<i>But she never</i>
<i>seemed to mind.</i>

152
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:47,291
<i>She always had a smile!</i>

153
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:50,041
<i>It's hard to believe that</i>
<i>someone so smart and so strong</i>

154
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:52,083
<i>could be taken away</i>
<i>by an accident...</i>

155
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,666
<i>After it happened,</i>

156
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,333
<i>there were a lot of people I</i>
<i>could have stayed with, I guess.</i>

157
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:58,916
<i>I chose to live with</i>
<i>my paternal grandfather.</i>

158
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,416
<i>He was always so nice to me.</i>

159
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,208
<i>But he's retired now,</i>
<i>and living on his savings.</i>

160
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,875
<i>I didn't want to be a burden,</i>

161
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:09,458
<i>so I promised him I would work</i>
<i>to pay for my tuition myself!</i>

162
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,125
<i>After four months...</i>

163
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:13,583
<i>The house needed some</i>
<i>renovations, and Grandfather</i>

164
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:15,166
<i>went to stay with his</i>
<i>daughter and her family</i>

165
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,833
<i>until the work was done.</i>

166
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:19,458
<i>He asked me if I had a</i>
<i>friend here I could stay with.</i>

167
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:22,416
<i>I told him yes, but Uo lives</i>
<i>in a one-room apartment,</i>

168
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,833
<i>and Hana's got</i>
<i>such a large family...</i>

169
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,208
<i>I couldn't ask them.</i>

170
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:27,791
<i>They've got enough</i>
<i>to worry about.</i>

171
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,583
<i>I'd just be in the way...</i>

172
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,333
<i>That's when it hit me!</i>

173
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:34,583
<i>If I could somehow live</i>
<i>on my own for a while,</i>

174
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:37,166
<i>then everyone would be happy!</i>

175
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:45,208
Oh! Yuki! It's you!
I mean, it's... Hi.

176
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,416
It seems we're beginning
to make a habit

177
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,083
of bumping into each other.

178
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:53,500
It was nice meeting your cousin
this morning. He was funny.

179
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,041
And those little
Zodiac figurines

180
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:56,541
he made were really cute...

181
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:59,916
Ah, yes... but I thought I
overheard you saying something

182
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,458
about how you wished there
was a Year of the Cat?

183
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:05,416
It's an idea I had when
I was a kid... Silly.

184
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,125
Cats... useless,
foolish creatures.

185
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,916
Tell me, Miss Honda.

186
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,750
How familiar would
you say you are

187
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:22,291
with the history of
the Chinese Zodiac?

188
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,958
I know the stories
my mom used to tell me...

189
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,333
Did you know that
it was originally

190
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:28,541
nothing more than
a simple calendar?

191
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:31,541
A mathematical system
to mark the passage of time.

192
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:34,083
Only later did people begin
to use it for things like

193
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:35,916
astrology and fortune-telling...

194
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,416
Oh. I guess the story about
the animals isn't true then...

195
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,708
No... I'm not really sure how

196
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:44,416
or when the animals first
came to represent the years.

197
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,166
But I don't believe they
were there from the beginning.

198
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,083
What I do know is at no time
in the history of the Zodiac

199
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:54,083
has the cat ever been included.

200
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:56,958
So you see, the cat has
been shunned by society

201
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:59,083
for thousands of years.

202
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:02,708
But as the story is told, it
still yearns to be accepted...

203
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:05,583
Like I say,
a truly foolish animal.

204
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,958
Sounds like you
really don't like cats.

205
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,000
I noticed it this morning

206
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,166
that you're starting
to look a bit pale...

207
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:23,083
You should try to take
better care of yourself.

208
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:26,750
Perhaps we'll bump into
each other again tomorrow...

209
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:30,000
<i>Wow... He really is mysterious!</i>

210
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,583
<i>But I'll pretend I didn't</i>
<i>hear that "pale" remark!</i>

211
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,250
<i>I can't afford to let</i>
<i>anything bring me down!</i>

212
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,083
<i>I've got too much to do!</i>

213
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:38,583
<i>Besides, Mom probably</i>
<i>had it much, much worse.</i>

214
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:41,500
Wha--? Hey, you gonna let
this trash sit here all night?

215
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,166
Oh! Sorry!

216
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,708
<i>Like my motto says,</i>

217
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:47,375
<i>"Never give up, no matter</i>
<i>what life throws your way!"</i>

218
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,541
Whew. If we keep eating
out like this all the time,

219
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,583
I'm going to have
to buy a bigger robe.

220
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,458
Well, then why don't
you do the cooking.

221
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:58,583
Why? Every time I
make dinner you complain.

222
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:02,333
Pickled radish and curry is
not dinner. It's disgusting.

223
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,916
I think one complaint
is more or less justified.

224
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,541
You know Yuki, you've got a
good head on your shoulders,

225
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,750
but I just don't think you're
cut out for housework.

226
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,291
Let's get a housekeeper?

227
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,583
No.

228
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:14,958
Hold up...

229
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:16,958
Miss Honda?

230
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,500
Hi, Mom. I'm home.

231
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:25,083
I know... It's late.
But I can't sleep yet.

232
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,875
I still have a paper to write.

233
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,916
I'm just going to go
down to the stream

234
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,166
and wash up a little, okay?

235
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,875
Shigure, don't you think
you're overdoing it?

236
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,750
So... You've been living
in that tent by yourself?

237
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:54,541
Uh, huh.

238
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,083
For how long?

239
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,208
I don't know. Just over a week?

240
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:01,666
Well, that explains it. All of
this land is Sohma property.

241
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,750
It seemed odd that we'd
suddenly have a new neighbor...

242
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,875
I'm sorry... But please...

243
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,875
Can't I stay there
a little while longer?

244
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:11,500
It's only for a few
more weeks, then I'll go!

245
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,750
I don't have much money,
but I can pay you!

246
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:14,916
Please let me stay?

247
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,750
Those woods aren't too safe...

248
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,583
You've got wild
animals, landslides,

249
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,416
the occasional
weirdo prowling around.

250
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,458
It's not a good idea for a girl
to be living out there alone.

251
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:25,250
So you're done laughing?

252
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:28,416
Don't you worry about me! I'm
already used to all the bugs!

253
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,416
And if I can stand up to
them, I can stand up to...

254
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,458
Miss Tohru!

255
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:32,541
A fever.

256
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:36,291
Ice! I'll get ice! It's uh-
It's...

257
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,416
And you call the woods unsafe?

258
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,250
Well, relatively speaking.

259
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:50,333
There. You hear that?

260
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,416
There's just been another
landslide somewhere.

261
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,750
Really? But how
do you know that?

262
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:58,833
I guess you could
say it's instinct.

263
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,166
Was it close?

264
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:04,833
Close to the tent-er,
I mean-- Not at all!

265
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:10,916
Oh! This is terrible! Mom's
picture was still in there!

266
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,291
I've got to get her out! Mom!

267
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,000
Mom! I'm coming!

268
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:16,625
Please, calm down.
You already have a fever.

269
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:21,916
But, Mom...
Wh-What am I going to do?

270
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,833
If I don't get her out soon...
sh-she'll be hurt!

271
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:28,583
Don't strain yourself. We'll
come back when it's brighter...

272
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:31,541
I think your Mom's probably
glad it wasn't you in there.

273
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:35,125
And I think she'd be upset if
you got hurt now... Don't you?

274
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,708
There. Isn't that better?

275
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:45,083
And Yuki's still looking for
some ice, if you want it...

276
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,500
I'm sorry...

277
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:50,875
You must be tired. It's a
lot to happen in one day...

278
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:57,875
I... I lost my home again...

279
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:00,250
Are you okay?

280
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:07,458
Yes... It's sad... but,
not as sad as other things...

281
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,125
Like what?

282
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:15,833
Like... not telling Mom
"be safe" on the day she died...

283
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:18,375
I said that every morning...

284
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:24,125
Bye. Be safe. Except
that day. I didn't say it...

285
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:31,125
I had a test. So I stayed up
studying almost the whole night.

286
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:35,750
When it was time for Mom to
go to work, I didn't wake up.

287
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:42,625
I couldn't tell her "be safe".
And she never came home...

288
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,166
I used to think about
quitting school... working.

289
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,291
Mom told me she
didn't finish school.

290
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,916
But she always
wished that she did.

291
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,916
<i>That's why I need</i>
<i>you to stick with it.</i>

292
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,541
<i>So you can tell me</i>
<i>what it feels like</i>

293
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:07,291
<i>to hold that</i>
<i>diploma in your hand.</i>

294
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:11,791
And then, maybe, you can have
the life I never got to have...

295
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:20,375
When she said that,
that's when I knew...

296
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:23,625
Why she worked so hard...

297
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:28,708
It was all for me.
And with everything she did,

298
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:31,458
I couldn't even get up
long enough to say "goodbye"

299
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:34,250
when she was
walking out the door.

300
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,083
Not even that one little thing.

301
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,875
And then she was gone...

302
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:47,166
So now, I have
to finish high school

303
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:50,125
like Mom wanted me to,
no matter what...

304
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:55,916
I have to hold that
diploma in my hand...

305
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,750
I have to... for her...

306
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:06,333
I can't give up...
just because...

307
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:11,541
of a fever... like this...

308
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:21,500
It's amazing...

309
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:27,541
She always seems
so cheerful at school...

310
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:28,750
You'd never guess

311
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:31,125
she's been suffering
like this for so long...

312
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:35,833
When I was young,

313
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:39,416
there were many times I wanted
to run away from Sohma House...

314
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,750
But I never did.

315
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,583
I could always find some
rationalization to stay...

316
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,833
The fact of the matter is,
I just wasn't strong enough,

317
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:51,083
or I could've left...

318
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:55,250
I could've lived in the
woods by myself, in a tent...

319
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:58,958
I could've done what she did...

320
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:02,125
You can call it amazing...

321
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:06,416
But I don't think the
word does it justice...

322
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:10,333
No... No, it doesn't.

323
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:14,416
Do you mind
keeping an eye on her?

324
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,291
I'd like to go out for a while.

325
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:20,625
What? Where? You're not going
to try digging out that tent--?

326
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:22,750
You are. Aren't you?

327
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:23,916
Do you want me
to come with you?

328
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,791
It won't be an easy
job for you alone...

329
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:28,041
You're right...

330
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:31,666
but I don't think I said
that I was going alone...

331
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,125
Be safe, Yuki.

332
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:48,791
<i>Tohru... Tohru...?</i>

333
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,916
<i>You've got a fever again.</i>

334
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,958
<i>You don't have to push</i>
<i>yourself so hard...</i>

335
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:59,083
<i>You don't have to do</i>
<i>things the way I did.</i>

336
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:00,375
<i>You can just be yourself.</i>

337
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:03,583
<i>Do things your own way,</i>
<i>one step at a time.</i>

338
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:08,458
<i>You'll get there...</i>
<i>I promise...</i>

339
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,458
<i>Mom?</i>

340
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:14,708
<i>Just be yourself.</i>
<i>You'll be fine...</i>

341
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:28,916
Mom, you're here...

342
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,583
But how did you--?

343
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,500
Good morning!

344
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,083
How are you feeling today?

345
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,916
Um, I, guess I, uhh...

346
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,333
I've brought your
things for you.

347
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:43,166
I think this is all of them,
if you'd like to check.

348
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:46,416
Yuki, this must have
taken you all night!

349
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,416
Don't be silly.

350
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:52,416
So, then how did you-?
I mean, there was so much...

351
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,250
It's a secret.

352
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:56,083
Oh...

353
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,625
I know the place is dirty...

354
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,041
What?

355
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:02,208
And I realize the idea of
living with two strange boys

356
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,458
might seem a little awkward...

357
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,666
But there's an
extra room upstairs.

358
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,291
You're welcome to stay
there if you'd like.

359
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,458
No, no, no! Out of the question!

360
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:14,083
We're not that strange...

361
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:15,583
No! I didn't mean it like that!

362
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,875
Of course, it won't be free...

363
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:21,000
I do intend to pay
you for your services.

364
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,791
For my... services?

365
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:26,916
♪ As our brand new
housekeeper! ♪

366
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
We'll just take your
things to your room now.

367
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,583
I assume your references
will all check out?

368
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:32,333
Wait! I can't let you do this!

369
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:34,416
Not after all the trouble
you've gone through already!

370
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,708
Please, it's too much!

371
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:38,083
Miss Honda, we're doing
this because we want to.

372
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:41,708
You don't have to worry that
it's causing us any trouble...

373
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:44,583
And besides...
Where else can you go?

374
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,291
Oh...

375
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,125
Well, if I'm going
to stay here,

376
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,166
I'll work for room and
board, and that's it!

377
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,416
I don't want any money!

378
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,708
And I want to know all
the rules of the house!

379
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:56,916
Relax. It's all right.

380
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,041
You can do things
your own way here.

381
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:05,708
The only thing you have to do
is be yourself... Fair enough?

382
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:11,166
<i>Just be yourself...</i>
<i>You'll be fine...</i>

383
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,916
I don't know. Do you
really think it's a good idea

384
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,583
having a girl in the house?

385
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:21,791
Naturally. Now it occurs to
you to worry... But I wouldn't.

386
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:25,125
We'll be okay, as long as
she doesn't try to hug us...

387
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:29,125
<i>All's well that ends well,</i>
<i>I guess...</i>

388
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:32,875
<i>But I'm still not sure how</i>
<i>I ended up in Yuki's house.</i>

389
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:34,541
<i>or borrowing</i>
<i>some of his clothes...</i>

390
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,625
<i>It's like being in a dream...</i>

391
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,541
I apologize for the smell.

392
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:41,250
We've had this room
closed off for some time...

393
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:44,083
it's probably best to keep the
windows open for a while...

394
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,333
Yo.

395
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:55,541
Time to pay the piper,
rat-boy. I'm here to collect.

396
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:59,625
Funny. I would have thought
he'd send somebody bigger.

397
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:01,208
That's right.

398
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:02,958
You better get your tough talk
out of the way while you can,

399
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:04,208
'cause I'm about to wipe

400
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:06,750
that stupid little smirk
right off of your face!

401
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,458
Wait! Stop! Don't fight!

402
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:19,458
Yuki, what were all those
crashing sounds I just heard?

403
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:21,083
Kyo's not here, is he?

404
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:24,583
I'm so sorry!
Are you all right? I--

405
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:27,083
Ah! I turned him
into a cat! I'm so sorry!

406
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:28,416
--Hold on...
--I don't know how it happened!

407
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,750
But we're going
to help you, okay?

408
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:32,333
Hurry! We have to get him
to a doctor, right away!

409
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,791
--Miss Honda!
--Tohru!

410
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,541
<i>Oh Mom, I think this</i>
<i>must all be a dream!</i>

411
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:56,333
<i>Everybody's</i>
<i>turning into animals!</i>

412
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:06,666
<i>Now let's all gather,</i>

413
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:12,250
<i>Enjoying the company we share,</i>

414
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:17,583
<i>Our tears will dissolve</i>
<i>into thin air,</i>

415
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:23,541
<i>As we drink up</i>
<i>this wonderful life.</i>

416
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:28,458
<i>La, la, la...</i>

417
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:34,583
<i>Takin' in all the</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

418
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:39,666
<i>La, la, la...</i>

419
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:45,666
<i>Drinkin' up all this</i>
<i>good love and life.</i>

420
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:50,750
<i>La, la, la...</i>

421
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:56,500
<i>Take it in all this</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

422
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:28,416
<i>Tohru, I'm a dog. Yuki</i>
<i>here is a rat. That's Kyo.</i>

423
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,708
<i>Don't let his temper scare you.</i>

424
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:31,958
<i>He's got a bit of a</i>
<i>chip on his shoulder.</i>

425
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:35,416
<i>Your planing on erasing Miss</i>
<i>Honda's memories, aren't you?</i>

426
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,083
<i>Just like in the old days.</i>

427
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:40,458
<i>I believe I will</i>
<i>trust Miss Honda.</i>

428
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:45,833
<i>For Yuki, and for Kyo.</i>
<i>Even for myself.</i>

429
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:47,666
<i>This may be</i>
<i>a great opportunity.</i>

430
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:50,958
<i>What I was thinking. I don't</i>
<i>even know where to start.</i>

431
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:52,666
<i>But, Tohru Honda</i>
<i>never gives up!</i>
