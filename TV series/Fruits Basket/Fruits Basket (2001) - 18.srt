[Uo] Hey...
Tohru, check it out.

00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:24,875
What is it?

15
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:27,541
Hana's over there
talking to that Minami.

Oh, well that's
good, right?

17
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:31,666
Maybe they're starting to
be friends, or something.

Are you crazy?

Oh... Here

Hey...

Yes?

What's up? What did
those girls want?

26
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:54,250
They said they're doing
a special report

27
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,708
on Electric Waves for
the school newspaper,

28
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:58,416
and they want to
interview me...

29
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,125
They asked if they could come
to my house this afternoon.

30
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:04,375
And you actually
believe that?

31
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:07,375
Well... No... I could
sense that they all

32
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:10,125
have something much
more sneaky in mind...

33
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,291
So... Are you letting
them come over?

34
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:17,291
Of course, I am... I have
something sneaky in mind, too.

35
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:19,583
Yeah! I like
your style, kid!

36
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,333
Oh, this is gonna
get interesting...

37
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:24,125
You mind if I come
over after work?

38
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:28,791
No, not at all... Are
you coming as well, Tohru?

39
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:33,750
Uh... No, I have to
work until late tonight.

40
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,208
Oh.

41
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:02,291
Ahh... Look at him. Today he's
looking more radiant than ever!

42
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,208
He must be beaming with pride
now that he's been named

43
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,875
the next Student
Council President!

44
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:10,458
What am I saying? He's
more radiant every day!

45
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,083
This is just the natural light
of the Prince, shining through!

Girl's House" is a success!

00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,666
Excellent. Good
job, all of you...

Minami, Number
One, Number Two.

50
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,500
Thanks!

51
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:32,666
What happened? Did she suspect
you at all? What did she say?

52
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,916
Nothing! She just said "Yes"!
We had her completely fooled!

53
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,375
It was almost
too easy!

54
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,291
It's like she knew
we were coming!

55
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,375
No it
was not.

56
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:41,291
Yeah,
how--?

57
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:43,791
Oh...

58
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:47,875
Very good! Phase One of our
master plan is complete!

59
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:50,041
We must document this
momentous occasion!

65
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,375
That's me!

66
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,833
Member Number 2,
Mai Gotou!

67
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:10,458
Here!

68
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,791
I am the President of the
Prince Yuki Fan Club,

69
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:14,208
Motoko
Minagawa!

70
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,125
And together, we
shall prevail!

71
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,500
The four of us will carry
out our ultimate mission:

72
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,625
"Operation Destroy
Tohru Honda"!

73
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,875
The Prince Yuki
Fan Club...

74
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:38,541
An unofficial organization
within Kaiwaia High

75
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:42,458
dedicated exclusively
to Yuki Sohma...

76
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,000
The membership of
this club includes

77
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,666
over half the girls
in the school.

78
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,375
When the club was
initially founded,

79
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:53,583
it's main focus was simply to
have and protect the prince.

80
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:57,833
But over time, its members have
become more and more obsessed

81
00:05:57,916 --> 00:06:01,083
with having Yuki
for their very own.

82
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:11,875
In that regard, the club's
motto is: "We shall prevail".

83
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:14,791
Repeat: "Do not touch
the Prince's belongings."

84
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,791
Do not touch the
Prince's belongings!

85
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:20,708
Repeat: "Do not enter
the Prince's house."

86
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:23,458
Do not enter the
Princes' house!

87
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:26,083
Repeat: "Do not speak to the
Prince unless accompanied

88
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:28,041
by at least two
other members!"

89
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:30,041
Do not speak to the
Prince unless accompanied

90
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,375
by at least two
other members!

91
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,291
When speaking
to the Prince,

92
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:36,041
address him as follows.
Third Years: "Yuki".

93
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,375
"Yuki".

94
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:39,041
Second Years:
"Prince Yuki".

95
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,041
"Prince Yuki".

96
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,041
First Years:
"Prince Yuki Sohma".

97
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:43,750
"Prince Yuki
Sohma".

98
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:46,583
Any girl at Kaiwaia High
who violates these rules

99
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:48,208
runs the risk
of punishment--

100
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,583
whether she is a member
of the club or not.

101
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,208
Hail to
the Prince.

102
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:55,541
Hail to
the Prince!

103
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:58,291
What are you doing
in here? Go home.

104
00:06:58,375 --> 00:06:59,541
It's unforgivable.

105
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:02,041
I've dedicated my life,
all my time and energy,

106
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:05,208
to making the Prince
Yuki Fan Club a success!

107
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,833
And she's
ruining everything!

108
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:19,458
It's clear... Tohru
Honda is a witch!

109
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:24,041
She's cast her evil spell
over our beloved Prince Yuki!

110
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:28,750
She's using her black magic to
make him fall in love with her!

111
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,291
Don't even
say that!

112
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:33,041
We have to find a way to get
that witch away from Yuki!

113
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,041
Before it's
too late!

114
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:36,875
So, um...

115
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:39,875
Why exactly are we going
to 'Electric Girl's' house?

116
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:42,500
Why don't we just go to
Tohru's house instead?

117
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:45,375
That's a good...
question, Number Two...

118
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:46,833
Be- before we can
stop the witch...

119
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:50,000
we have to destroy the
source of her dark powers...

120
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:56,125
The she-devil:
'Electric Girl'!

121
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:58,250
And you'll know exactly
how powerful she is,

122
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,208
if she ever decides
to attack you...

123
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,541
Ahh!
I didn't mean it!

124
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,541
I couldn't sleep for
a week after that.

125
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,750
And I began hearing
strange voices in my head,

126
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:09,083
just babbling, on,
and on, and on...

127
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:10,875
That Uotani girl
may be a Yankee,

128
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:13,333
but she's still human,
so we can beat her up!

129
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:15,791
But Hanajima, she's some
kind of super-human!

130
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,458
I don't know how
we can stop her!

131
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:20,625
Ehh, yes, it will
be dangerous...

132
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,541
Which is why we cannot
attack the she-devil blindly!

133
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:26,458
We must proceed with caution
ever step of the way!

134
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:27,916
But we
will prevail.

135
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,458
Phase Two of

136
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:32,375
"Operation Infiltrate Electric
Girl's House" will succeed!

137
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:35,083
And then... Once we have
discovered her weakness...

138
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:38,458
We can protect ourselves
against her electric waves.

139
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:43,041
And we can protect our Prince
against the witch Tohru Honda!

140
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,041
Everyone!
Do your best!

141
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:45,750
Right!

142
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:57,041
Here...
It's this way.

143
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:58,333
Oh... right.

144
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:02,791
Uh... Hanajima...
It's not too far, is it?

145
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:11,000
Now, don't be nervous...
Everyone be strong!

146
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,958
We can't let her
catch us off guard!

147
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:13,625
Right...

148
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,541
Hey, uh...

149
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,166
Do you guys have
any idea...

150
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,416
w-what this place
is gonna be like?

151
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:28,583
Um... President Motoko,

152
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,541
what are we going to
do if she really does

153
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:31,750
have a house
like that?

154
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:34,416
Eh... Run away,
I suppose...

155
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,291
[Hana]
We're here.

156
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,916
We are?!

157
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,041
It's perfectly
normal...

158
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:49,416
Oh, and by the way...
For your own safety,

159
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:54,041
it's best you don't call each
other by name in the house.

160
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:55,875
W-Why?

161
00:09:55,958 --> 00:10:00,041
Hey! What's going on?!
Ow! Get me out of here!

162
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:06,250
President Motoko! Hold on!
One... Two... Three... Pull!!

163
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:19,875
Hello...?
Any body home?

164
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,708
Oh look!
What a cool piano!

165
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,041
Number 2...!

166
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:27,583
Oh, right.
Sorry.

167
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:29,666
The inside's pretty
normal too, huh?

168
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,958
Don't let your
guard down.

169
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:42,333
Hey! I have this
exact calendar!

170
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,000
Ahh, it's
so cute!

171
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:45,000
Yeah
it is!

172
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:46,333
Yeah, where'd
you get it?

173
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:47,916
Oh... you know...
that store...

174
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,666
the one by
the station?

175
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,041
Across
the street?

176
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:52,666
Yeah! That's
the one!

177
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,041
Why don't we go tomorrow?
I'll buy one, too...

178
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:56,541
Yeah,
me too!

179
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:58,208
I don't know what it is! I
feel so hyper all of a sudden!

180
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,041
Shhh!

181
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:03,666
(Giggling
and tripping)

182
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,666
Ow, that
hurt!

183
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,333
Klutz!

184
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:06,583
Shhh!

185
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,375
You know, it's
almost too normal...

186
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:14,708
Yeah,
really...

187
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:18,041
You guys did see her
go upstairs, right?

188
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,708
Hm? Did you
hear that?

189
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,041
No...
what?

190
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:28,375
I don't know. Some
kinda' weird sound.

191
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:29,791
What do you
mean, 'weird'?

192
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,208
Is this
her room?

193
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,250
Over
here.

194
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:38,541
(Nervous giggling...)

195
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,875
Thank goodness! Her
room is normal too!

196
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,333
Be quiet!

197
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,000
Oh, that's cute.

198
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:54,125
Hey, this is the weird
sound I heard before!

199
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,708
I wonder what makes
it move like that?

200
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,041
I guess it moves
when we talk.

201
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,041
It's
black...

202
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,041
I should get
one of these...

203
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,375
Her whole room's
pretty black...

204
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:01,708
I wonder where
they sell them...

205
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,916
It's kinda' creepy,
don't you think?

206
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:15,291
Instead of sitting
there running your mouth,

207
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,500
maybe you should get to
work on our plan, Number 2!

208
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:18,875
It wasn't
just me...

209
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:20,708
We have to act fast, before
the she-devil returns!

210
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:22,208
Right!

211
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:24,833
Look for anything useful!
Pictures... diaries... poems...

212
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:27,125
Poems?

213
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:28,541
Those'll
be scary...

214
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:31,083
Search everywhere you can!
I'll look in the closet!

215
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,125
Sorry to keep
you waiting.

216
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:42,875
Ha- Hanajima! There's someone
hiding in your closet!

217
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:44,416
Ah...
Megumi.

218
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,041
Meh- Meh-
who'd you say?

219
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,041
My younger
brother...

220
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:51,041
That's not a closet.
That's his room.

221
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:54,333
Megumi. Come out and
say hello to our guests.

222
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:55,833
That's really
scary...

223
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:02,083
Hello.

224
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:04,083
He's creepier
than she is!

225
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:07,166
You're not Tohru,
or Arisa...

226
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,416
Are these girls new
friends of yours?

227
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,041
Not really... They're just
some girls from my school...

228
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,583
We have some
classes together...

229
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,000
but I barely
know them.

230
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:18,791
Let's keep
it that way!

231
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:21,333
Oh! The two of you
look just alike...

232
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,208
No, I don't
think so...

233
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:25,625
Well, there is definitely
a resemblance...

234
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:30,750
So, uh... Does, uh... well...
Does Megumi have, you know...

235
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:35,375
the same sort of 'electric
wave' powers as you?

236
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,333
No...
I don't.

237
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:43,083
But I can do something else...
I can put curses on people.

238
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:48,083
I've worked hard for a long
time perfecting my technique...

239
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,083
And now... I'm
quite good at it.

240
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,708
[Hana] He's a
strange boy.

241
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:53,208
Yeah...
No kidding...

242
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:57,125
Uh... I'm not sure I wanna
know, but... how do you do it?

243
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,291
Names.

244
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:01,291
All I have to do is
learn a person's name,

245
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,208
and once I know
that I can easily

246
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:06,708
put a curse on them...
Which reminds me...

247
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:11,166
I haven't even asked
your names yet... Have I?

248
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,958
Well, we don't want to
overstay our welcome!

249
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:17,500
Why don't we get
our work done,

250
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,791
and then we'll just be on our
way! Isn't that right girls?

251
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:20,791
Names...

252
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:21,833
Right, we don't
want to take up

253
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:23,833
too much more of
Hanajima's time!

254
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:26,333
President... I want
to go home right now.

255
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:28,333
Don't be silly! We
can't leave yet.

256
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:29,625
We have a job to
do, remember?

257
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,916
Yes, we still have a
few 'questions' to ask...

258
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,916
Okay. Hanajima, do
you have a weakness?

259
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,041
Shut up! You're gonna
blow our cover!

260
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,166
I have one.

261
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,375
You do?!

262
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,708
So... now I
understand...

263
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:42,875
There never
was a story

264
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:45,000
for the school
newspaper, was there?

265
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,875
You're here because you don't
like it that your 'Prince' Yuki

266
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:51,458
has been spending so much
time with Tohru lately...

267
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,583
You're planning to do
something to Tohru...

268
00:14:56,458 --> 00:15:00,000
But you're afraid that
I will try to stop you...

269
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,250
As you
should be.

270
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,250
So you came up
with this silly plan

271
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:07,291
to discover whether or
not I had a weakness.

272
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:10,791
That's not fair! You used
your powers to read our minds!

273
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,666
No. I
didn't.

274
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,416
Okay...
You're right...

275
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,416
We're here because
we want that witch-

276
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,666
I mean we want that Tohru
Honda out of the way... So...

277
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,000
Will you
tell her?

278
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:25,208
Tell her she has to stop
being friends with Yuki...

279
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,083
Tell her she can't
have anything

280
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:28,708
to do with him
ever again!

281
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:31,250
That is up to Tohru
and Yuki to decide...

282
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:33,125
But I don't think they'll
want to stop being friends

283
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:35,208
just because
you're jealous.

284
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,208
We're not jealous!
We just don't like her!

285
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:39,375
Yeah, I mean who does
she think she is?!

286
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:42,041
What could a girl like that
possibly know about Yuki?

287
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,750
And what could
the four of you...

288
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:46,666
possibly know about
Tohru, or anything else?

289
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,500
It's almost a shame that
she is friends with Yuki...

290
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,625
considering the amount
of trouble it causes her.

291
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:54,500
Did you hear that? Did
you hear what she said?

292
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:56,750
She said it's the Prince
who's causing her trouble!

293
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,875
That's impossible!
He's the Prince!

294
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,833
No. It's you girls who
cause her the trouble.

295
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:04,083
We are only trying to do our
job- protecting the Prince!

296
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,708
And she... She's making
us look like fools!

297
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,875
I'd say you're
doing that yourself.

298
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,791
We... The
four of us...

299
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:13,791
We really like
Yuki. We love him!

300
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:15,875
Can't you understand
how much it hurts us,

301
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:18,875
when we see Tohru with him
all the time? It's like...

302
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:20,000
It's like she thinks
she can have him

303
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,666
all to herself!
But she can't!

304
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,625
Prince Yuki belongs
to all of us!

305
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,833
[Megumi] You
say that...

306
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:29,041
But if he truly
belonged to you,

307
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:31,833
would you be here fighting
to hold on to him?

308
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:34,250
You say that
you love him.

309
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:35,750
But if
you did,

310
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:39,083
would you really want to take
his friends away from him?

311
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,166
Would you try to force
your will upon him

312
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,000
to make
yourselves happy,

313
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:44,875
without any regard
for his feelings?

314
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,125
You don't understand
that there are times

315
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,625
when true love will
be a source of pain,

316
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,708
and one that you
must accept...

317
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,791
Because to truly
love someone,

318
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,666
is to always put
their feelings

319
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,458
before your own...
no matter what.

320
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:58,416
But, that's wha--

321
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,000
Keep putting
yourself first...

322
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:03,375
And you will only succeed
in pushing him away.

323
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,375
Minami.

324
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,458
Mio.

325
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:08,916
Number 2.

326
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,041
And, Motoko... right?

327
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:28,250
[Announcer] Attention.
Train B is now boarding.

328
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:29,666
Please enter
with caution.

329
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:37,375
Tohru?

330
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:38,541
Uo!

331
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,375
I thought you had
to work tonight.

332
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:43,375
Oh... I, uh,
decided not to go...

333
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:50,125
How did... How did he
find out our names?

334
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,750
It must have been when we
were searching her room!

335
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:59,750
President Motoko, do you think
she'll try to poison our tea?

336
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,416
Eww... I'm not
gonna drink it.

337
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,583
Minami. Mio. We have to
be brave. Drink the tea.

338
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:12,375
And if electric waves don't
wear off for a week...

339
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:13,625
A curse probably
lasts a month!

340
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:16,458
No... I don't wanna
hear the voices again!

341
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:19,375
Wait... He called me
"Number Two" didn't he?

342
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:20,708
You heard
him, right?

343
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:23,916
He called me "Number Two"?
That means I'm safe!

344
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:29,375
I'm sorry...
Did I overdo it?

345
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:32,416
No.

346
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:37,708
You know, I was also
beginning to feel jealous.

347
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:39,708
It almost
seems like...

348
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:43,125
Tohru spends every moment of
her time with the Sohmas now...

349
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:46,708
And I guess... I
was getting lonely.

350
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:48,333
But...

351
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,541
...because to
truly love someone,

352
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:54,875
is to always put their
feelings before your own...

353
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:57,916
That's
right...

354
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:05,375
I can't let myself be
selfish about Tohru...

355
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:09,208
I don't want to be like
those Fan Club girls...

356
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:11,833
I'm glad Tohru and
Yuki are friends...

357
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:15,458
It was wrong of me
to suggest otherwise.

358
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:17,791
So you've learned
something today.

359
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:22,083
Yes?

360
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:22,625
Hey.

361
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,125
Oh. Hana!

362
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,541
I found her at
the station...

363
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:32,875
So, um... where are
Minami, and the others?

364
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,708
Oh, Tohru...

365
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:38,541
It's been a long
time, Tohru, Arisa.

366
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:39,750
Hey, kid.

367
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:43,041
Yeah, hello! Nice to
see you again, Megumi!

368
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:48,708
Just so you know, I think Tohru
was pretty worried about you...

369
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:52,375
So they left, huh? Well
doesn't that just suck.

370
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:53,375
Did Hana
tell you...

371
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,375
[Hana] When you
love someone...

372
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:58,958
It can make you feel
sad sometimes...

373
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:03,000
Or sometimes it can
make you feel lonely...

374
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,041
But it can make you feel
happier than you've ever been.

375
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:13,000
Hey! Megumi!
Whadda' ya' say to

376
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:15,250
another dumpling
eating contest!

377
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,375
I'd say
you're on.

378
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:19,500
I'll go make
some tea...

379
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,750
Tohru, would you like
a cup... or snacks?

380
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,541
Sure!

381
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:29,500
[Hana] The
answer is yes...

382
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:34,333
I do have a
weakness...

383
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:38,541
And that weakness,
will always be Tohru...

384
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:45,208
Good
afternoon.

385
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:46,458
Good
afternoon!

386
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:49,791
Good afternoon-- Don't
you 'Good afternoon' me!

387
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,333
Just 'cause you
scared us yesterday,

388
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,041
doesn't mean
we're through!

389
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:54,666
No, I'm sure
it doesn't...

390
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:58,083
By the way... Curses don't
take effect for three days.

391
00:20:58,625 --> 00:20:59,958
Wh-wh-what
do you mean?

392
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:02,333
D-Did your brother?
D-Did he really--?

393
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:04,000
Who can say?

394
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:06,583
You'll have to wait
three days to find out.

395
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,708
Uh...
Well, bye!

396
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:11,291
You're a devil!
You know that?!

397
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:12,291
Everything about
you is, just, evil!

398
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:13,625
Calm down,
President. It's okay!

399
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:16,708
Three days...
We're doomed...

400
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:18,083
[Tohru] I'm still not
sure what happened

401
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:19,708
at Hana's
house yesterday.

402
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:22,583
But... it seems like
everything turned out okay.

403
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,833
I do know that if Hana ever
does run into trouble...

404
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,750
I know I want to be
there to help her.

405
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:29,000
And Mom... if that
time ever comes,

406
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:31,125
I hope I have the
strength to protect her,

407
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,791
and all
my friends.

408
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:38,708
I didn't mean
to scare you...

409
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:40,375
I'd like to tell
you something.

410
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:44,958
I'm sorry... I know you don't
cause her any trouble at all.

411
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:46,708
Huh?

412
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:50,500
[Tohru] Yes... I hope I can
protect all my friends...

413
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:53,583
the same way Hana is
always protecting me.

414
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:06,916
<i>Now let's all gather,</i>

415
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,500
<i>Enjoying the company we share,</i>

416
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:17,791
<i>Our tears will dissolve</i>
<i>into thin air,</i>

417
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:23,750
<i>As we drink up</i>
<i>this wonderful life.</i>

418
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:28,708
<i>La, la, la...</i>

419
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:34,791
<i>Takin' in all the</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

420
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:39,875
<i>La, la, la...</i>

421
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:45,916
<i>Drinkin' up all this</i>
<i>good love and life.</i>

422
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
<i>La, la, la...</i>

423
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:56,791
<i>Take it in all this</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

424
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,416
Listen up. For those of you
who received failing grades

425
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,750
on any of your
mid-terms...

426
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:30,208
there'll be
retests on Sunday.

427
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:32,041
[Classroom]
Aww...

428
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:33,791
[Uo] Quit complaining!
It's your own damn fault

429
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:36,125
if you gotta come
in for a retest!

430
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:39,291
But that's what they get
for not studying, right Tohru?

431
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:41,166
You got a
failing grade?

432
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,791
[Tohru] It really
is pathetic.

433
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:44,458
I'm so
stupid.

434
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:49,208
I'm starting to
get dizzy...

435
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:51,166
[Kyo] You really
do have a fever!

436
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,208
[Shigure] Yes, it
is a fever alright.

437
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:56,250
And in my professional
medical opinion...

438
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:57,458
you're sick!
