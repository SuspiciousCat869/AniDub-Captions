1
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:18,125
<i>I was so happy when you smiled,</i>

2
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:21,708
<i>Your smile breaks</i>
<i>through the clouds of grey,</i>

3
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:28,625
<i>Far from the sunny days</i>
<i>that lie in sleep.</i>

4
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:31,583
<i>Waiting with patience</i>
<i>for the Spring,</i>

5
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:35,583
<i>when the flowers will</i>
<i>bloom renewed again,</i>

6
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:42,625
<i>knowing there's more</i>
<i>beyond the pain of today.</i>

7
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:49,000
<i>Although the scars</i>
<i>of yesterday remain,</i>

8
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:56,458
<i>You can go on living as</i>
<i>much as your heart believes.</i>

9
00:00:56,541 --> 00:01:02,958
<i>You can't be born again</i>
<i>although you can change.</i>

10
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:09,666
<i>Let's stay together always.</i>

11
00:01:27,416 --> 00:01:29,041
Is he really Prince
Yuki's cousin?

12
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:30,791
I'll bet he knows
everything about him!

13
00:01:34,916 --> 00:01:39,708
Leave me alone!

14
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:41,291
Amazing!

15
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:44,958
Poor Kyo...

16
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:54,791
Hey.

17
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:57,875
What were you trying to prove,
pulling a stunt like that.

18
00:01:57,958 --> 00:01:59,208
Think. If you act
like an idiot

19
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:00,958
I'm the one who's going
to hear about it.

20
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:02,375
Serves you right...

21
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:04,625
Why do you wanna go to a school
with all these crazy,

22
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,250
giggling
girls, anyway?

23
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:08,375
I suppose you'd prefer
I lived my life

24
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:11,625
in fear of being transformed?
You sound like Akito.

25
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:14,916
He thought I should attend an
all-boys academy too...

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,500
Which is why I
came here.

27
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:20,708
To get away from him,
and out of that house.

28
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:24,583
What do you know...? You're
a spoiled little rat.

29
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:27,083
[Kyo] You want out?
Fine! But as for me...

30
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:30,208
I'm gonna prove it once and for
all that I'm better than you.

31
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:33,375
And then I'm gonna take my place
as a true member of this family!

32
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,833
I'm not gonna be
left out any more!

33
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:38,125
Do you hear me, rat boy?!

34
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,458
No!

35
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,291
I am so sorry...

36
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,500
But I saw what was going on,
and I guess I just panicked...

37
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,041
I'm sorry that
you're angry,

38
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:52,333
but fighting at school
isn't a good idea!

39
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:54,416
You'll get into huge
trouble if they catch you!

40
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:54,791
(And on your first day.. I
didn't think...)

41
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:55,541
Shut up.

42
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:58,791
Who do you think you are!
This is between me and him!

43
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:02,000
It's got nothing to do with
you, you stupid little girl!

44
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:04,750
From now on, just stay
the hell away from me!

45
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:10,708
Okay, that was
maximum rage...

46
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:16,583
He hates me. That's all there
it to it. He really hates me.

47
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:19,416
You truly are
an idiot.

48
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,958
So what? You're
gonna hit me now?

49
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:24,458
Wouldn't it hurt
more if I didn't?

50
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:32,750
[Tohru]
I remember,

51
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,625
when I first heard the story
of the Zodiac animals,

52
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:37,083
all I could think about
was the poor cat.

53
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:40,541
While all the other animals
were having a wonderful time

54
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:43,041
at the banquet, the cat was
still lying in its bed,

55
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:45,458
dreaming of a party that
would never come...

56
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:50,041
I know, I won't be a dog
anymore! I'll be a cat, too!

57
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,083
And I really
meant it...

58
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,333
I wanted to show the
cat that, no matter what,

59
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:56,916
he had a friend...

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,208
I liked cats
so much...

61
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:00,708
I know I would have
been the first to join

62
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:04,166
a Year of the Cat fan club
if there was such a thing...

63
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:07,583
But now he hates me..
I'm such a fool, Mom...

64
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:10,416
A real fool.

65
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,375
Incoming. Tohru's
electric signals.

66
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,333
There
she is...

67
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:16,625
Hey, what are you doing
kneeling in the hall?

68
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:17,625
Class is-uh?

69
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:20,041
I can't believe I
did it again...

70
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,541
I bumped
my head!

71
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:23,541
That almost hurts more
than the first time!

72
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,000
Look, I'm crying
it hurt so bad!

73
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,500
I would worry,

74
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:29,041
but I don't think her brain
damage can get any worse...

75
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:33,000
[Shigure] So, you're home. Had
enough school for one day, huh?

76
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,458
I don't wanna live in
this house anymore.

77
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:38,000
If you can train on
a mountain for four months,

78
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:40,375
I think you can endure more
than three days here...

79
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:44,125
I said such terrible
things to her... Terrible.

80
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:47,250
And by, her... I take
it you mean Tohru?

81
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:48,666
Let me guess...

82
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,916
You lost your temper and
yelled at her again, right...?

83
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,500
You know you
shouldn't do that

84
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,125
if you're just going
to regret it...

85
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,375
Not too bright,
now is it?

86
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:57,708
Save your breath..

87
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,708
I'm just not meant to get
along with other people.

88
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:01,458
Period. End
of story.

89
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,875
Oh sure, some people
just aren't...

90
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:05,250
but you're not
one of them.

91
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:08,666
You lack experience,
that's all.

92
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,541
For example..

93
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,208
I'm sure you could smash
this table to bits

94
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:13,791
with your
bare hands...

95
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:15,875
But I'm equally sure you
could punch the table

96
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:18,208
without breaking it...
And why is that?

97
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:19,750
Because I know your
training has taught you

98
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:20,583
to control
your fists.

99
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,708
At least I
should hope so,

100
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:24,166
after four months of fighting
bears and whatnot...

101
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,708
I didn't
fight bears!

102
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:28,041
My point - is it takes
just as much training

103
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:32,375
to get along
with people...

104
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,166
Only, training by
yourself in the mountains

105
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,708
won't do you
any good.

106
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:38,708
You need to surround
yourself with others.

107
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:39,625
As you get to
know them,

108
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:40,541
of course you
take a chance

109
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:41,583
that you'll end
up hurting them,

110
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,583
or that they'll end
up hurting you.

111
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,708
And one of those things
may very well happen.

112
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:48,416
But that's the
only way we learn.

113
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,083
About others,
and ourselves.

114
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,041
You're a black belt
in martial arts,

115
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:57,250
but I'd guess you've still got
a white belt in social skills..

116
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:58,708
Some day, you're
going to meet someone

117
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,666
who truly wants to be your
friend, and you theirs...

118
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,750
But if you don't
keep training,

119
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,375
you won't be ready
when that happens.

120
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:06,833
It'll never
happen, anyway.

121
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,625
Ahh, never
say never.

122
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:10,375
Okay, fine.
Maybe..

123
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:13,375
if I meet someone with brain
damage.. or something...

124
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:14,291
That's
the spirit.

125
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,625
I'm home!

126
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,375
Ah, so you are. Is
Tohru not with you?

127
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:19,791
She had to work
this evening,

128
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,416
but she'll be
done by eleven.

129
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,208
I'm thinking about
picking her up.

130
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:25,708
That's probably a
good idea..

131
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:30,208
There are some real
weirdoes around here...

132
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:34,208
Another day's work, over and
done... But it's late.

133
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:35,791
I wonder if anyone's
still awake...?

134
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,875
I hope Kyo at least
got some dinner

135
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:40,083
tonight, if he wasn't too
angry to eat again...

136
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,583
Maybe I could...

137
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:44,666
oh, but I'm probably the last
person he wants to see...

138
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,125
Just stay the hell
away from me!

139
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,458
Ahh, no one's
ever hated me before.

140
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:50,541
I don't know
what to do!

141
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:53,166
Just be yourself.
You'll be fine...

142
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,375
Yes, you're
right Mom!

143
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:58,583
I just have to
keep trying!

144
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:06,375
Wh- what was that? Is
there somebody else here?

145
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:07,500
Oh no!

146
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,250
What if it's one
of those weirdoes

147
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,791
Shigure warned
me about?!

148
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:16,083
No!!

149
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,791
Kyo! He's going to think
I thought he was a stalker!

150
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:30,416
Oh, but I guess I did! But I
can't tell him that! Ahh..

151
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,791
Uh, wait... I'm sorry,
it was an accident!

152
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,833
I was just stretching
my arm, and oops!..

153
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,083
Funny how things like
that that happen, huh?

154
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,541
But hey, it's
nice to see-

155
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:41,291
Quit babbling! If you've got
something to say, say it!

156
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:41,916
Kyo...

157
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,250
What?!

158
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,833
Uh... I don't know
what to say...

159
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:47,291
Then don't say
anything!!

160
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm sorry!

161
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:54,333
No, don't be.. Say or don't
say whatever you want...

162
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:58,791
And, you don't have to-
you know, stay away,

163
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:02,708
I- Ahh, just hit me
again if you're angry...

164
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:06,125
I think...
Is he...?

165
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:09,250
he's trying to apologize
for this morning, isn't he?

166
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,916
Maybe that's why he came
out here to meet me...

167
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,708
So... does that mean-the
other day after school...

168
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:18,750
I think he was trying to
apologize to me then, too...

169
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:19,750
I'm sorry.

170
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,875
I'm sorry if I gave
you the wrong idea.

171
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:25,625
I only hit you because I
thought you were a stalker!

172
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:26,875
Oh. Great.

173
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:29,041
So you see, it wasn't
because I'm mad at you!

174
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,375
That's not
it at all!

175
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:31,791
In fact, I
really like you!

176
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:36,666
I've always liked
the cat from the Zodiac!

177
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:41,416
What I mean is.. I hope..
maybe.. we can be friends?

178
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,208
[Shigure] Some day,
you're going to meet someone

179
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:45,333
who truly wants to
be your friend...

180
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:48,916
What are you
supposed to be?

181
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,958
Some Year of the
Cat Fan Club?

182
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:52,958
C'mon... Let's
go back.

183
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:00,166
I think I understand Kyo a
little bit better now.

184
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,250
He doesn't always
mean to get angry.

185
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,041
Sometimes, it's
just hard for him

186
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:06,041
to say how he
really feels...

187
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:09,041
But, deep down, I believe
he truly is a nice person,

188
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,916
even though he tries to
hide it most of the time.

189
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,000
[Shigure] Kyo, I hear you
gave Tohru a little scare

190
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,750
while you were out
prowling around last night...

191
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:22,791
Kyo's a stalker!
Kyo's a stalker!

192
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,708
You are so
full of it!

193
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:25,958
And you!

194
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,041
Next time you need
someone to walk you home..

195
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:28,208
don't look
at me!

196
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:29,625
That's okay.

197
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,333
Anyway, I'd much rather see
you here at the table

198
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:33,208
like this
more often...

199
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:35,375
I'm glad
you're eating.

200
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:36,291
How do you
like the food?

201
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,250
What do
you want?

202
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,000
Nothing.

203
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,250
You were
staring at me!

204
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,916
No. Just
looking.

205
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,166
Well, I guess there's a
first time for everything!

206
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,125
Do you
like it?

207
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:47,708
No, I
don't!-

208
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,166
Hey, why don't we play
Rich Man-Poor Man?

209
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:07,375
Ah, play it with that damn
Yuki.. I don't wanna.

210
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:10,916
Running away from a
challenge. What are you?

211
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,041
Some kinda' sissy?

212
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,083
Fine! I'll play
your stupid game!

213
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:16,291
Just don't cry when
you lose, Yankee...

214
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:17,666
How about
this...

215
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:21,791
The loser cleans the entire
classroom by himself.

216
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:24,875
Ahh, aren't those the
most wonderful signals?

217
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,333
Let's ask Yuki if he
wants to play too!

218
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,250
Yuki! Want to play
Rich Man-Poor Man?

219
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:32,125
You're not here!

220
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:33,541
I'm sorry...

221
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:36,375
I'm just not ready to be in a
relationship right now.

222
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:38,875
So... I think it
would be best if-

223
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:41,458
No, don't
say it! Yuki!

224
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:51,208
Uh.. I'm..
sorry?

225
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:57,625
It's just that... You
were always so nice, I...

226
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,541
You really don't want
to get close to anyone,

227
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,458
do you Yuki?

228
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:02,875
You shut everyone out,

229
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:04,958
like you think you're
better than they are...

230
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:05,833
So what,

231
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,041
I guess a normal
girl like me

232
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:13,375
just isn't good enough
for you, is that it?

233
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:14,000
Revolution!

234
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:15,375
You cheater!

235
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,166
What kinda cheap-ass tricks
are you trying to pull?!

236
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,833
Whatta' you mean tricks?!
Those're the rules!

237
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:20,166
Let's see..

238
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,916
'Revolution' makes all the
high cards low, right?

239
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,208
Wait... Reverse
Revolution.

240
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:29,208
You've had
it now, Kyo!

241
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:30,375
Go for
it Hana!

242
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:33,375
How embarrassing!
Getting beat by a girl!

243
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:38,416
Aw, stick it... C'mon!
Let's play again!

244
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:42,458
You really don't want to get
close to anyone, do you Yuki?

245
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:54,166
Rich Man-Poor Man...

246
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,625
I know
the rules,

247
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:57,375
but I can't say I've ever
actually played the game...

248
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:59,916
Uo just taught me how to
play not too long ago.

249
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,666
It really is
a lot of fun!

250
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,041
You should play
with us next time!

251
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:07,750
So, it looks like Kyo was
the loser today, was he?

252
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:10,958
Yes, but I'll still
help him clean up.

253
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:12,208
No. A loss
is a loss.

254
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,458
You sure?

255
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,458
Don't worry about it.
I'll win next time...

256
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:17,375
Just like I'll
win against you!

257
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:20,000
Wait, wait. I think I've
heard this one before...

258
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:21,291
No joke,
ass-hole!

259
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,333
I am going to beat
you! That's a promise!

260
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:24,541
I wish
you'd stop

261
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:27,000
making your inferiority
complex my problem.

262
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:29,916
I swear, every time you open
your mouth it pisses me off!

263
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,875
And every time you open yours
you sound like an idiot.

264
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,708
[Tohru] They're
fighting again...?

265
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:38,166
They can't even be in the
same room together, can they?

266
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,041
I guess cats and rats aren't
supposed to get along, really.

267
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,375
But the way
they fight?

268
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,375
There's got to be a
better explanation...

269
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,083
...And then I'm
gonna take my place

270
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,791
as a true
member of this family!

271
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:51,375
Do you think- maybe...

272
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:54,708
what he meant by that was,
he's trying to beat Yuki...

273
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:57,750
because he thinks then he'll
be accepted into the Zodiac?

274
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,958
If that's true,
then that means...

275
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:03,708
the cat will be included
with the other twelve animals!

276
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:05,083
That would
be wonderful!

277
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:07,916
I'm gonna break your
pretty-boy face!

278
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,416
But..

279
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,375
I don't think fighting is the
best way to go about it...

280
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,541
Umm, you guys?

281
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,416
Let's go!
Right now!

282
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:28,291
Ugh, I can't even
stand to look at you.

283
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,666
Yuki...

284
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:39,791
Damnit, Why can't I ever kick
him in the head for a change?

285
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:43,750
But he really tried to
lay me out today...

286
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:52,291
He must be in a bad
mood or somethin'.

287
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:56,416
I don't know. I guess it's
because Yuki's always so..

288
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,541
polite, you wouldn't think
he ever had a bad day.

289
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,375
But if what Kyo
said was true,

290
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,458
he might just be keeping
his real feelings

291
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:09,083
locked up
inside...

292
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,750
Hey, go
check it out.

293
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:13,208
There's a real looker
standing out front.

294
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:14,708
I don't remember
the last time

295
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:15,958
I saw such a pretty face
like that on a boy...

296
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,500
Oh-listen to you. You
just don't quit, do you?

297
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:23,791
I wonder
if that's...

298
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:26,250
Yuki!

299
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,208
Hi there. So are
you all finished?

300
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,750
Yes, but don't tell me you
came all the way down here

301
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:31,708
just to
pick me up.

302
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:33,166
Sure I did...

303
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:36,208
It's not too safe for you to
be walking alone at night.

304
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,208
An escort, two
nights in a row...

305
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:39,666
I have to say,

306
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:44,250
you and Kyo sure know how
to make a girl feel special!

307
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:48,625
Well, we
should go...

308
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:51,541
W- Wait.
Yuki.

309
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:54,583
Umm.. I hope I'm
not prying, but

310
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:55,916
if there's something
that's bothering you,

311
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,416
you know you can talk to
me about it if you want...

312
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:01,625
I'm sorry,

313
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,291
it's just that anytime I ever
had anything on my mind

314
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:05,458
that was bothering me, it
always made me feel better

315
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:06,208
to talk about
it with some-

316
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:08,833
Hey, lovebirds!
Go home!

317
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,708
It's too late for you
kids to be on the street!

318
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:12,416
Sounds like it's past
your bedtime, too.

319
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,916
What, are you kidding?
It's still early!

320
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,833
But then again,
you don't have to-

321
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,625
I wouldn't want to
talk to me either

322
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:22,625
if I kept turning
me into a rat.

323
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:28,500
No. It's not your fault.
I'm the one with the curse.

324
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:32,750
For years,

325
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,375
living at Sohma House
felt like living in a cage.

326
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:37,708
Akito always liked to keep
me as far away from...

327
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,875
well, everyone
as he could.

328
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:42,208
But what I wanted, was
to live a normal life,

329
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,666
with normal
people.

330
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,916
I wanted to move
in with Shigure,

331
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,416
enroll in
this school...

332
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:52,541
I wondered why he let me go,
at first... I soon found out.

333
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:55,708
I could leave the house, but
leaving the cage, heh...

334
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:59,083
that wasn't
so easy.

335
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,500
No. I'm
still a Sohma.

336
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,666
And no matter how
much I might want to,

337
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:07,083
that's something
I can never change...

338
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:10,416
I'll always be.. different. I
know that. What scares me is,

339
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,208
if I get too
close to someone,

340
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:16,541
they might realize that
too... Not like Kyo.

341
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,416
He's shy when he
first meets people,

342
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,208
but after he gets to
know them a little,

343
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:23,083
he can open up to
them, be himself..

344
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,625
Because of
what he is,

345
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,583
Kyo can never be accepted into
the Zodiac like he wants...

346
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:27,750
But, isn't
it better

347
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,666
that he can be accepted
by normal people,

348
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,916
for who
he is?

349
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,375
That... is exactly what
I've always wanted.

350
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,625
I guess that's why I
get so angry with him.

351
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:40,875
Because he can't
even see what he has.

352
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,000
He's blinded by
that foolish desire

353
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:44,416
to join the
very same family

354
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,541
I've spent my life
trying to run away from...

355
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:51,166
Yuki, people do accept you. A
lot more than you know.

356
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,583
I mean...

357
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,000
just think of all the
girls at school who like you.

358
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,833
They always talk
about how nice you are...

359
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:58,208
But that
isn't me.

360
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,375
You say they accept
me because I'm nice?

361
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:03,708
Well, I only act nice because
I want them to accept me.

362
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:05,750
Not because it's
how I really feel...

363
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:10,291
I'm not a good person.
I'm just... selfish.

364
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,541
The weather didn't say
a thing about rain...

365
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:21,291
But what's a day without
surprises, I guess...

366
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,625
This is
bad...

367
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,500
Yuki! What is it...?
Where are we going?

368
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:32,208
A field?

369
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:35,666
No, just a little vegetable
garden I take care of.

370
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,833
Then... did
you do all this?

371
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:40,250
Uh huh. This is
my secret base.

372
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,958
Wow, it's even
better than I pictured!

373
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,208
So, you
came here

374
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:45,833
to try and protect it
from the storm, right?

375
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:49,666
I'll help if I can.
Just show me what to do!

376
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,291
Miss Honda, you
are a good person.

377
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:54,958
Who? Me...? You
really think so?

378
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:58,208
No one's ever told me that
before... Thank you so much!

379
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:00,625
But maybe I'm only being
nice so you'll like me!

380
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:01,958
Maybe I'm just
being selfish!

381
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:04,541
I don't think you
could if you wanted to.

382
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,375
I don't know
about that.

383
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,875
Mom said everyone can
be selfish sometimes.

384
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,958
But then again, she also
said it's always better

385
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,750
to give them the
benefit of the doubt...

386
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:15,083
No one really
starts out kind.

387
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:17,083
All we know how to
do at first is want.

388
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:19,250
We want food, we want
attention...

389
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:22,208
It's just natural
survival instinct, I guess...

390
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,333
But kindness
is something

391
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:25,291
that we all have
to learn as we go.

392
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:28,125
It's something that grows and
develops slowly over time...

393
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:31,416
The same way our
bodies do... And so,

394
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:37,750
kindness can come in all
sorts of shapes and sizes...

395
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:39,500
[Kyoko] True kindness isn't
something we're born with.

396
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:42,708
It's something we have to work
at. We have to mold it,

397
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:45,708
and shape it within ourselves.
Not everyone has it.

398
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,083
But, I think everyone
has the potential.

399
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:51,041
Sometimes you just have
to look really close

400
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,708
before you can
tell it's there...

401
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:54,708
Ever since Mom
told me that,

402
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:57,208
I've always tried to look
for the good in everyone.

403
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:59,625
It's hard sometimes.
But it's worth it,

404
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:01,416
because I get to see all
the different shapes

405
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,041
that kindness
can take...

406
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:05,833
For example, I think yours
is sort of like a candle...

407
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:07,875
Whenever
you're around,

408
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:09,958
you always seem to bring
just a little bit more light

409
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:11,833
into the room.
Everything's brighter,

410
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,416
and it just makes
me want to smile...

411
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,083
Oh, but now you're looking
at me like I'm crazy...

412
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:19,166
Ah, uh.. I'm sorry,
it's just, uh...

413
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,208
I guess I'm not used
to talking like this...

414
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,041
But I'm glad
that we are..

415
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,791
When you're comfortable
enough with someone

416
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,166
that you can share
your feelings,

417
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,041
I'd say that's usually
a pretty good sign

418
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:33,833
that you're getting to
be closer friends!

419
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:36,083
Oops! It got
away from me!

420
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:38,208
I guess that's a good sign
that I should stop talking

421
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:39,958
and protect
the base!

422
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:43,958
[Kyoko] It's not always easy to
see the good in people, Tohru.

423
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,250
In some people,

424
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:46,541
you might even doubt
that it's there at all...

425
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:50,958
But if you can somehow,
find a way to believe...

426
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:54,125
Sometimes, that's all it
takes to help someone,

427
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,416
to give them
the strength

428
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:00,583
to find the good
in themselves...

429
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,416
Hooray! We
saved the base!

430
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,250
Yes. But we're a little
worse for wear, aren't we.

431
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:07,041
Maybe we should pick
something while we're here.

432
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,041
You think?

433
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,375
Umm... I guess the
leeks are ready.

434
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:13,083
Ahh-hh-h leeks..
uughch...

435
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:16,125
Miss Honda...
I've been thinking.

436
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,250
Next time you play that
game, could I play too?

437
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:21,208
Sure! Of
course you can!

438
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:23,125
You just didn't seem too
interested before...

439
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:26,250
Well, I.. When I saw
everyone together like that,

440
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,708
I guess I let my
shyness get the best of me...

441
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:31,416
But next time...
I'd like to join you.

442
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,166
I'll keep
trying.

443
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,958
Maybe I can still learn
to open up more...

444
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:38,750
That's wonderful! I'll
introduce you to Hana and Uo.

445
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:40,166
They're
really great...

446
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,416
And I know they'll both be
excited to to meet you...

447
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,708
uh, I mean,

448
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,333
I think Uo's always
looking for another victim

449
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,000
to beat at Rich
Man-Poor Man!

450
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:54,250
Thanks for
the warning!

451
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:58,958
I think that's
the first time

452
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:01,541
I've ever really
seen Yuki smile...

453
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:11,125
Eat up,
everyone!

454
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,833
Are you crazy,
I hate leeks!

455
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:15,791
Leeks, onions, miso, am
I leaving anything out?

456
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,875
Hey, miso's okay as
long as it's soup...

457
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,750
I'm sorry, I guess
I didn't know.

458
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:21,500
I can make something
else for you if you want.

459
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,833
Just tell me
what you'd like!

460
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:27,541
Just eat.

461
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:30,375
It really is a
shame that

462
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:32,166
these two can't
get along better...

463
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,708
I have to wonder
how it would be

464
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:36,166
if Kyo knew that Yuki
admired him a little bit...

465
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,125
Who knows?

466
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:38,208
I'll bet there's
even something

467
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:40,041
about Yuki that
Kyo admires...

468
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:43,375
[Shigure] Umm, Yuki?
Kyo's already passed out...

469
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:44,791
If they could just
understand that,

470
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:48,500
maybe there's a chance
they'd actually stop fighting!

471
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:50,291
You know..
all this time..

472
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,500
I simply misunderstood
you.. I'm sorry.

473
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:54,583
No, please..
I'm sorry..

474
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:58,208
From now on, let's be
the best of friends!

475
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:01,625
On second thought,
that's a little scary!

476
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:06,666
<i>Now let's all gather,</i>

477
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:12,208
<i>Enjoying the company we share,</i>

478
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:17,541
<i>Our tears will dissolve</i>
<i>into thin air,</i>

479
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:23,500
<i>As we drink up</i>
<i>this wonderful life.</i>

480
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:28,416
<i>La, la, la...</i>

481
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:34,541
<i>Takin' in all the</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

482
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:39,625
<i>La, la, la...</i>

483
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:45,666
<i>Drinkin' up all this</i>
<i>good love and life.</i>

484
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:50,708
<i>La, la, la...</i>

485
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:56,458
<i>Take it in all this</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

486
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:31,166
[Tohru] Ah, what
a cute little girl!

487
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:32,875
[Yuki] She's had her
heart set on marrying him

488
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:35,416
since we were little kids.
For whatever that's worth.

489
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,708
It's pretty silly, I know.

490
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:38,166
[Tohru]
And, I think every girl

491
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,166
dreams about getting
married one day.

492
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:43,250
Kagura just dreams a
little louder than most.

493
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:45,291
[Kyo] You see what
happens when she's around...

494
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:47,708
It's always like that.
She's crazy.

495
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:49,125
[Tohru] When you have
someone who love's you

496
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:52,250
as much as she does, you
should really feel pretty lucky.
