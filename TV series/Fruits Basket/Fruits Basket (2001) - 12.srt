1
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:18,125
<i>I was so happy when you smiled,</i>

2
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:21,708
<i>Your smile breaks</i>
<i>through the clouds of grey,</i>

3
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:28,625
<i>Far from the sunny days</i>
<i>that lie in sleep.</i>

4
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:31,583
<i>Waiting with patience</i>
<i>for the Spring,</i>

5
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:35,583
<i>when the flowers will</i>
<i>bloom renewed again,</i>

6
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:42,625
<i>knowing there's more</i>
<i>beyond the pain of today.</i>

7
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:49,000
<i>Although the scars</i>
<i>of yesterday remain,</i>

8
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:56,458
<i>You can go on living as</i>
<i>much as your heart believes.</i>

9
00:00:56,541 --> 00:01:02,958
<i>You can't be born again</i>
<i>although you can change.</i>

10
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:09,666
<i>Let's stay together always.</i>

11
00:01:29,416 --> 00:01:31,375
Hey, it's
me, Tohru!

12
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,708
If you remember, last
month for Valentine's Day,

13
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:36,333
I saved up to buy chocolates
for all of my friends.

14
00:01:36,416 --> 00:01:38,541
It wasn't much, but I wanted
to give them something

15
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:41,375
to say thank you for everything
they'd done for me...

16
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:44,666
So yesterday, I really
wasn't expecting Momiji

17
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,666
to give me a
White Day present--

18
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,541
especially not an all-
expenses-paid trip

19
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:50,041
to a
hot spring!

20
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:51,416
But that's
what he did!

21
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,666
And here we
are now--

22
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:56,333
on our Super Relaxing
Hot Spring Steam Trip!

23
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,041
[Momiji] Hey, Tohru!
Look! A mountain!

24
00:01:58,125 --> 00:01:59,375
[Tohru]
Ah, yes.

25
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:00,375
Ooh! And
a river!

26
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:01,208
Uh-huh...

27
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:02,166
And a
field!

28
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,541
Uh-huh...

29
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:05,625
And look! It turned out
to be a beautiful day, huh?

30
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,166
Yes, it did!

31
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,541
Right Yuki?
Right Kyo?

32
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:10,333
[Both]
I guess...

33
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:13,416
So why are you guys
being so quiet?

34
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,208
You're not sad you
came, are you?

35
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:17,625
Oh, I
hope not...

36
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:20,083
especially since you only
came to keep me company...

37
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:22,083
and... well, thank
you for that...

38
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,666
But I hope I'm not taking
away from anything important.

39
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,750
I mean, if there were other
things you had planned...

40
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,583
Ah... forget
about it...

41
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:30,875
I only came because
there wasn't anything

42
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:32,583
better to do
at home...

43
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:34,083
Oh...
okay...

44
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:36,875
And I haven't been to the
hot spring in a long time...

45
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:38,541
I was happy
to come along.

46
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:39,791
Oh, I
get it.

47
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:40,916
You were just thinking
how nice it's gonna be

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,208
once we get
there... Right?

49
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:43,333
Mm-hm.

50
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:45,041
Then it's settled!
Once we get there...

51
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:47,208
We're all gonna try to have
as much fun as we can!

52
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:48,541
Right Tohru?

53
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:51,041
Uh-huh! Right! I'm sure
that won't be hard to do.

54
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:53,291
I'm already having
such a wonderful time!

55
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:55,166
I never dreamed
giving out Valentines

56
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,333
would mean I'd be
whisked away to a place

57
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,125
as fancy as
a hot spring!

58
00:02:58,208 --> 00:02:59,291
And, not
only that...

59
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:00,666
That I'd get
to ride there

60
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,541
in the comfort of a private
charter bus like this...

61
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,208
It all seems too
good to be true.

62
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:07,208
Like I'm a princess
in a fairy tale!

63
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:11,291
Tohru can be the princess,
and I'll be her prince!

64
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:16,833
Ah, give me a break...
It's just a hot spring...

65
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:18,958
It's nothin' you gotta
get all worked up over.

66
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:21,291
I think it's
just ahead...

67
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:29,375
[Tohru] Wow... It's
absolutely beautiful!

68
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:32,208
[Momiji] Well, come on Princess
Tohru, your room awaits!

69
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:35,541
Ah... Thank you, Momiji.
It's all so wonderful...

70
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,416
You really have made me
feel like a princess...

71
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,083
That's right!
You're the princess!

72
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,375
Ooh! And I'll
be your knight!

73
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:41,625
[Kyo] Knock
it off.

74
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,708
Well then, I'll be back
to pick you up tomorrow.

75
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:47,083
Okay. Thank
you! Bye-bye!

76
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:58,208
Oh... thank goodness,
I'm so glad you're here...

77
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,708
Oh... don't worry. She's
the Hot Spring Lady...

78
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,041
The word is
'hostess'...

79
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:08,250
Uh-h, a-are you okay?
Is everything all right?

80
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:13,000
Pleeease! Let me
show you to your room!

81
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:18,625
Guess what! The Hot
Spring Lady is a Sohma, too!

82
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,375
But she gets sick a
lot, so she stays here,

83
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,375
for the health
benefits and all that.

84
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,125
The Sohmas own
this place, you know.

85
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:25,875
[Tohru]
Oh, really?

86
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:28,000
I apologize if
I startled you...

87
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:31,250
Oh, no... please, you don't
have to apologize to me...

88
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:32,375
just as long as
you're feeling okay,

89
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:33,875
that's what's
important...

90
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:37,916
You are too kind to an old
woman like me... but thank you.

91
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,041
I'm surprised
Young Master Shigure

92
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,708
didn't accompany
you today.

93
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:42,625
Perhaps he was too
busy with work?

94
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:45,375
'Young Master Shigure'?
How old are you?!

95
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:48,083
Yes, he had deadlines
on two books coming up.

96
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:49,541
Well,
that's a shame.

97
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,458
You see, you're the only
guests we have today...

98
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,708
It would have been a fine
chance to visit with him...

99
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:56,125
So, if she's a Sohma, and
if she already knows

100
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,333
Shigure and Yuki
and everyone...

101
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,708
I wonder if that means she
knows about the Zodiac curse?

102
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:03,375
Or maybe it means she's
one of the members

103
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:05,375
of the
Zodiac, herself!

104
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:08,291
Ah, here we are. This
will be your room.

105
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,791
Wow, it's
so big!

106
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:12,666
[Hostess] Yes. I made sure we
had our best room prepared

107
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,208
for your
arrival.

108
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:17,458
Tohru! Come over here! You've
got to look at this garden!

109
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:21,416
Wo-ow! I can't believe
how beautiful it all is!

110
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,666
How big is it? It looks
like it goes on forever!

111
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,625
Well... almost... See,
from that forest over there,

112
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:31,375
all the way to that mountain-
it's all Sohma property!

113
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,041
Really? It all belongs
to your family?

114
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,041
Uh-huh! Everything
you see!

115
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,041
Well... while
we're here...

116
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:39,375
maybe it would be fun
to go out for a walk.

117
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:41,541
You wouldn't be the
first to think so...

118
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,166
Actually, we've even had
a few guests go walking

119
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,041
who never
made it back...

120
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,583
Tohru... you were
supposed to laugh.

121
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:51,875
Oh, that was just a joke...
How silly, of course it was...

122
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:53,208
Yeah, so
don't worry.

123
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:55,208
Really, they never lose
the guests for too long...

124
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:57,625
There's a professional search
party on call at all times.

125
00:05:57,708 --> 00:06:01,250
What?! You mean they have
to send out search parties?!

126
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,916
Tohru, that was
a joke too...

127
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,166
Oh, I guess it
was, wasn't it...

128
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,208
Miss Tohru, I've
prepared a room for you

129
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,041
adjacent to the young
masters' here...

130
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,125
Oh, okay.

131
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:11,458
Hey!

132
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:13,833
I hope you don't think I'm
stayin' in the same room

133
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,583
as that
damn Yuki!

134
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:19,625
You two get along as
poorly as ever, I see...

135
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:20,958
But please,
don't be upset...

136
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:23,541
There are sliding doors
to divide the room...

137
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:26,291
That's not the point! The point
is, I didn't come here to--

138
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:27,791
The point is, you
just want to stay

139
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,583
in the same room as
Tohru, don't you?

140
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:31,833
How crude.

141
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:33,875
Hey! I didn't
say that!

142
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:36,041
So shut up, Momiji,
you and your damn mouth!

143
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,375
Master
Kyo...

144
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:41,458
Ahhhh! You should be
ashamed of yourself!

145
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:42,875
To think you would
even suggest the idea

146
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:44,916
of sharing a room
with a young woman!

147
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,458
And all this time,
even if you are a cat,

148
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,375
I thought you to be
a decent young man!

149
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:50,458
Since when have you gotten such
lecherous ideas in your head?!

150
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,041
[Kyo] Hey! Hold
on a minute!

151
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:54,833
I'm sorry, world!
I must apologize

152
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:56,208
on behalf of this
dirty-minded boy!

153
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:59,708
Okay, fine! I'll stay
in the room with Yuki!

154
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:02,416
Ha ha! Pervert!
Kyo's a pervert!

155
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,541
I think she's stronger
than she lets on...

156
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:07,083
All right then... I'll leave
you to enjoy yourselves.

157
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:10,708
Finally.
It's quiet.

158
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,000
There's still
time before dinner,

159
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:14,750
so let's take a
bath! Okay, Tohru?

160
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:15,541
Okay!

161
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,166
Let's take
it together!

162
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:17,916
Okay.

163
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,166
You little- Now
who's the pervert?

164
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,083
Aww-ww,
what'd I do?

165
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,083
Oh... but Momiji is
still so little and all,

166
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:26,333
I think it'll be
okay. I mean, uh--

167
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,875
Little!? What the hell
are you talking about!?

168
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:34,625
Miss Ho--

169
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:36,000
Kyo-o! I wanna go
in with Toh-ruu!!

170
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:38,000
I wanna! I
wanna! I wanna!!

171
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,041
Wahhh!

172
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,250
Momiji...

173
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:47,583
Why don't we give Miss
Honda some time to herself?

174
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,000
After all, the reason
we brought her here

175
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:52,000
was to give her a
chance to relax, right?

176
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,958
Right,
I get it.

177
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:05,708
But tonight we'll
sleep together, okay?

178
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:09,125
[Both] He
doesn't get it.

179
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:16,375
How nice, my first
open-air bath!

180
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:17,958
And the spring seems
almost big enough

181
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:19,958
for someone like
Momiji to swim in!

182
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:22,250
He is
swimming.

183
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:25,291
Okay... let's
see now...

184
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:26,541
Ta-da!!

185
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:32,458
What do you think,
Mom? How's the water?

186
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,166
It feels good,
doesn't it?

187
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,041
I'm doing
that again!

188
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,875
[Kyo] Momiji! Just
get in and be quiet!

189
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,250
Tohru! How
are you doing?

190
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:56,000
You little brat! Didn't I
tell you to be quiet?!

191
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,833
Aw-w, but Tohru's all by
herself! She's lonely!

192
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:01,541
Oh, hey! I know! Tohru,
let's sing a song, okay?

193
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,000
That way, it'll seem like
we're all in here together,

194
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:05,541
and it'll be a lot
of fun! Really!

195
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,791
Uh... A-
a song?

196
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,208
Yeah, yeah!
Sing something!

197
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,916
Well... I wouldn't
know what to sing.

198
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,125
I'm afraid I don't
really know many songs...

199
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:15,208

Oh, good. I'm glad to
see you've come around.

233
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:28,125
It's not very often someone
faints during their bath...

234
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:29,250
but our
hot spring...

235
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,041
well, it can make
some people dizzy...

my Mom?!

Here... Do you mean this
photograph? It's alright.

The plastic you
wrapped it in

239
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,166
kept it nice and dry.
No harm done...

240
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,875
Thank
goodness!

241
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:42,208
Um... but I guess
I really should be

242
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:43,916
thanking you
for helping me.

243
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,041
I'm sorry if I put
you to any trouble...

244
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,875
Outrageous! Never
in all my years

245
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,041
has a guest
apologized to me-e-e!

246
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:52,500
Ahh! I should have warned
you it was possible

247
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:55,458
to get dizzy in
the hot spri-i-ng!

248
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:59,166
Clearly, I have failed in
my duties as your hostess!

249
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,291
Dig my grave now, so
I may crawl in and die!

250
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,791
I'm so-rry!
I'm so-rr-yy!

251
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:08,041
Oh, uh...

252
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,291
I beg
your pardon.

253
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:10,333
N- Not
at all...

254
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:11,500
So that's a
special photo?

255
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,458
Oh... yes,
it is...

256
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,041
It's a picture
of my mother...

257
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:17,125
She, well, she passed
away last year...

258
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:18,500
Oh...

259
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,750
So since she can't
be here herself,

260
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:25,250
I still wanted her to enjoy
the hot springs... in spirit.

261
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:28,708
Oh my... What a
beautiful story...

262
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:30,458
Tohru! Are
you okay?

263
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,375
Oh! Yes I'm fine!
Nothing to worry about!

264
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:36,541
Really, thank you so much
for all of your help.

265
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:43,083
[Tohru] Ohh wow!
Incredible!

266
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:44,541
I've never seen so
many delicious foods

267
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:47,041
all on
one table!

268
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,916
[Kyo] You think we
can eat all this?

269
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,291
Well, I guess I better get
started serving the rice!

270
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:53,875
No you don't! You're the
princess today, Tohru.

271
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:54,916
Remember!
I'll do it!

272
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
O- okay.

273
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:00,916
Here,
Tohru!

274
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,416
Uh... Thank
you, Momiji...

275
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,750
Don't you think that's
a little bit much--

276
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:06,750
What the hell
was that?!

277
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,458
Princess Tohru
gets to go first!

278
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,541
Well, Miss Honda, what
are you going to try?

279
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,208
I don't know...
there's just so much!

280
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,958
Don't be
shy! Dig in!

281
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:16,958
Oh, I'm just not used
this much attention!

282
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,458
And with all of this
pressure to pick something,

283
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:19,708
I can't decide!

284
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:22,458
But they're all waiting
on me, so... uh...

285
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:23,500
Uh, how about
this one?

286
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,541
It's delicious!

287
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,041
Wonderful. I'm
glad you like it.

288
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,000
Well, go on!
Eat up! Eat up!

289
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:35,416
Pardon the
intrusion.

290
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,041
But the head chef would
very much like to

291
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,583
pay his respects to
the young masters.

292
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,416
As always, it is my
pleasure to serve you.

293
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,083
Does the cuisine
meet with your approval?

294
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:48,250
Oh, yeah.

295
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,250
It's even more delicious
than I remembered.

296
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:52,416
It is! A meal
fit for a king!

297
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,666
Please,
make way!

298
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,750
Ah! It's
too cold!

299
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:02,375
Nnnnoooo! This
is inexcusable!

300
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,208
I thought I had seen to it
that the young masters' cuisine

301
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:05,583
would be served with
the hot foods hot

302
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,125
and the cold
foods cold!

303
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:08,875
Only my complete lack of
competence as a chef

304
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:11,208
could allow such a lukewarm
dish to be served to you!

305
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,000
I beg your
forgiveness!

306
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:16,416
May I be cut into a thousand
pieces for this egregious act!

307
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,625
No! It was
my fault!

308
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:20,000
I clearly waited too
long to serve your meal!

309
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,083
No, it was
my fault!

310
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:22,166
It was
my fault!

311
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,333
--No, it
was mine!

312
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:24,833
By any chance,
are those two...?

313
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:27,333
...related? Yes.
They're cousins...

314
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:29,708
It's amazing the
family resemblance.

315
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,916
Ahh... The steam
looks so nice.

316
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,041
And it's such a
beautiful night...

317
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,708
I know! As long
as I'm here,

318
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,833
I'll try going out
for another bath!

319
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,000
Only this time, I'll be
a little bit more careful,

320
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,916
so I don't get
dizzy again...

321
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,791
Exclusively for guests
prone to dizziness

322
00:14:56,875 --> 00:15:00,041
That was nice of
them to set this up...

323
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,375
Here.

324
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:06,041
I hope that's not too
uncomfortable, Mom...

325
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,541
I just don't want to
take another chance

326
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:08,875
of getting
you wet.

327
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:11,500
You know, it's better to
be safe than sorry, right?

328
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:13,166
My, my...

329
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,583
Oh...
hello.

330
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:17,625
I see you discovered the
sign I posted... Very good...

331
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,625
You should find this bath
a bit more to your liking...

332
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:23,166
Ah. And once again, you're
here with your mother.

333
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,750
You are truly a special
young lady, Miss Tohru.

334
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,791
Oh... I don't
know about that.

335
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:30,541
Now that we have
a quiet moment,

336
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,041
I've been meaning
to speak to you...

337
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,666
Did you know that my own child
is a member of the zodiac,

338
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,208
like Master Yuki
and the others?

339
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:39,458
Yes, my child was born
under the sign of the monkey.

340
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,000
So when I first heard the
news that you had come

341
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,666
to live among
the Sohmas...

342
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:48,208
I must admit... It made
me somewhat uneasy...

343
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,458
I was afraid that allowing
an outsider to learn

344
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,583
the secret of the
zodiac curse...

345
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:55,083
would only lead to greater
suffering for my child,

346
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:59,708
and all of the other young
masters as well... you see?

347
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,583
However, I'd like to
apologize to you now

348
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:04,416
for having ever
thought that.

349
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,000
Having met you, Miss Tohru...
I'm no longer worried.

350
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,541
Because if your paths
should cross someday,

351
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:13,041
I am confident you will be
as much a friend to my child

352
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,250
as you have to
Masters Yuki and Kyo...

353
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:16,791
Uh-huh!

354
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:25,208
The monkey... Oh, I do hope
we get to meet someday soon...

355
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:28,250
Yeah, that's right. The Hot
Spring Lady is Ritsu's mom.

356
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,750
Sorry, I guess I thought
I told you that already.

357
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,416
Oh, so...
Ritsu?

358
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,375
Mm-hm! But enough
about that!

359
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,583
Come play ping-pong
with me, okay?

360
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:39,041
Kyo and Yuki never let
me play with them...

361
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:43,000
Out again.

362
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:45,833
I told you, you have to
let it bounce on the table.

363
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:49,041
Shut up! That's stupid! Why
would I wanna hit that slow?

364
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:50,916
Why? Because those
are the rules.

365
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,958
Out again...

366
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,583
Hang in there,
Kyo! You can do it!

367
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:02,958
I thought at
least at ping-pong

368
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:04,833
he might have a
chance to beat me...

369
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:06,750
but as usual,
he's hopeless.

370
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:13,041
How can I beat you with
all these stupid rules!

371
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:14,041
You damn rat!

372
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,500
How 'bout we
take this outside?!

373
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,000
You know, you're the
one who wanted to play

374
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:18,375
this game in the
first place...

375
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:21,083
Uh... well, in that case...
if you still want to,

376
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,708
I'll try playing
with you...

377
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,875
Ooh, that sounds like
fun! Play her, play her!

378
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:27,333
Advance
warning...

379
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:29,750
I'm not gonna go easy on you
just 'cause you're a girl.

380
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:30,750
Oh,
right.

381
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,041
Don't forget-
it has to bounce.

382
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:33,333
You shut up!

383
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:42,708
I missed it!

384
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:45,041
Yeah, I noticed.
You kinda' suck...

385
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:47,000
[Momiji] Kyo, don't
tell her that!

386
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:52,250
So you think you're
any better than she is,

387
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:53,125
you little
runt? Huh?

388
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:54,416
I'll play you
if you want!

389
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,583
All right,
let's go!

390
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:56,166
Ya-aye!

391
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,083
I serve
first!

392
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:57,750
Okay!

393
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,958
You asked
for it!

394
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,333
Yuki? Is there
something wrong?

395
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:11,333
You seem upset,
all of a sudden...

396
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:12,000
Funny...

397
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:17,541
That was funny... Miss
Honda that was hilarious...

398
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:19,208
The way you swung
and missed...

399
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:20,625
Oh, you're
awful...!

400
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:23,166
I'm sorry...

401
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,375
It's okay to laugh...
You don't have to hide it.

402
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,458
You could have laughed
in front of us.

403
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,708
Oh, no... I
just couldn't...

404
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:32,208
If Kyo saw me, I'd
never live it down...

405
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:33,458
I mean, I've never
even laughed like this

406
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:34,708
in front of
my parents,

407
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:36,208
if you can
believe that...

408
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:40,500
Ah, that was
a good laugh...

409
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:43,083
Oh, I
almost forgot.

410
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,791
Here...
for you.

411
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,291
It's a
gift.

412
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:50,375
I'd hoped I'd have a chance
to give it to you earlier,

413
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:53,375
but somehow the timing just
never seemed to be right...

414
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,833
It's my White Day
present, to you.

415
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:02,791
Thank you
very much.

416
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:06,708
I had a hard time deciding
what to get you at first...

417
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,500
...but when I
saw this, it...

418
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,416
well, it just
seemed to suit you...

419
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:17,875
I do hope you find it to
your liking... Princess.

420
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,750
Uh...
yes... Yes!

421
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:24,166
Of course I like it...
Really... Thank you so much...

422
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:28,083
Princess...

423
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:30,625
...I can think of
no higher honor.

424
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,416
I'm just
kidding...

425
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:44,541
Sometimes, he really
does seem like a prince...

426
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,333
Tohru!

427
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:50,416
Oh, Mom, there are
so many princes

428
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,708
in the Sohma family,
not just Yuki...

429
00:19:53,791 --> 00:20:01,416
Yes... Handsome,
lovely, kind princes...

430
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,625
I'm so grateful that I've
gotten to spend this time

431
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,958
together
with them...

432
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:07,541
Every
minute of it.

433
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,291
Tonight, I think
I really must be

434
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:14,291
the luckiest girl
in the world...

435
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:21,458
I'm so thankful...
For everything.

436
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:27,208
I'm afraid it's
time to say goodbye.

437
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:30,708
But please... all of you... I
do hope you'll come again soon.

438
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:32,916
Do you have to lean
on me like that?

439
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,333
Thank you. And take
care of yourself.

440
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,875
You as well... You
as well, Miss Tohru...

441
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:39,708
O-kay.
Heavy.

442
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:40,583
Okay.

443
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:43,375
I think our
driver got lost.

444
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:44,958
Hey,
Momiji...

445
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:48,000
I guess after this I won't get
to see you for a while, huh?

446
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:49,166
Huh?

447
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,541
But you know, I don't
think I even know

448
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:53,041
what year you'll be starting
in school this spring...

449
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:54,708
Is this your first
year of middle school?

450
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:56,666
Nope!

451
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,958
This spring will be my
first year in high school!

452
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,166
And as it
turns out,

453
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,958
I'll be going to the
same high school as you!

454
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:03,416
That's right!
Me and Haru, both!

455
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:06,291
Why you
sneaky little-

456
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:07,625
Why didn't you
tell us sooner

457
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:09,416
you and Haru were
coming to our school?!

458
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,041
We wanted it
to be a surprise!

459
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:13,333
Miss Honda... I'm
guessing you didn't know.

460
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:15,875
But Momiji actually is only
a year younger than us,

461
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,208
the same
age as Haru.

462
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:24,833
All this time I thought he
was in elementary school...

463
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,416
And now he's coming
to our high school?

464
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,625
Together with
Hatsuharu!!

465
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,083
Ah-h-h... I don't
even know which part

466
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:31,916
I should be most
surprised about!

467
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,833
Be surprised
about everything!

468
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:37,916
[Tohru] Well... I guess,
starting this spring,

469
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,541
high school is going to get
a lot more interesting...

470
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:51,125
Well, here it is. My White
Day present for Tohru.

471
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:52,166
Lovely...
isn't it?

472
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,208
The poor girl's
gone far too long...

473
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:57,125
without suitable clothing to
wear while cleaning the house.

474
00:21:57,208 --> 00:22:00,291
It's amazing no one's
locked you up yet.

475
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:06,916
<i>Now let's all gather,</i>

476
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,500
<i>Enjoying the company we share,</i>

477
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:17,791
<i>Our tears will dissolve</i>
<i>into thin air,</i>

478
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:23,750
<i>As we drink up</i>
<i>this wonderful life.</i>

479
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:28,708
<i>La, la, la...</i>

480
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:34,791
<i>Takin' in all the</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

481
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:39,875
<i>La, la, la...</i>

482
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:45,916
<i>Drinkin' up all this</i>
<i>good love and life.</i>

483
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
<i>La, la, la...</i>

484
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:56,791
<i>Take it in all this</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

485
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:26,500
[Tohru] Spring is
in full bloom,

486
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:28,666
and it's the first day
of a new school year!

487
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,750
[Uo] Hm... so there's more
Sohmas coming to school, huh?

488
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:32,666
Go get
them Kyo.

489
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,416
[Hana] Yes, go
get them.

490
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,458
[Kyo] Why me? Why don't you
get her to do it?!

491
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:38,833
[Momiji] Waaah! Kyo's
picking on me!

492
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:40,250
[Kyo] Idiot! What the
hell are you doing

493
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:41,625
wearing a
girl's uniform?!

494
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:43,958
[Haru] It's okay, isn't it?
It looks good on him.

495
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:45,375
[Momiji] I heard
he's gonna be here...

496
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:46,500
Akito...

497
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:47,625
[Tohru] Akito...?

498
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:49,791
[Akito] And you must
be, Tohru Honda...
