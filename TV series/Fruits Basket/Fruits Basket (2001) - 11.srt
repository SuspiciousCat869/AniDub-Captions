1
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:18,125
<i>I was so happy when you smiled,</i>

2
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:21,708
<i>Your smile breaks</i>
<i>through the clouds of grey,</i>

3
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:28,625
<i>Far from the sunny days</i>
<i>that lie in sleep.</i>

4
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:31,583
<i>Waiting with patience</i>
<i>for the Spring,</i>

5
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:35,583
<i>when the flowers will</i>
<i>bloom renewed again,</i>

6
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:42,625
<i>knowing there's more</i>
<i>beyond the pain of today.</i>

7
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:49,000
<i>Although the scars</i>
<i>of yesterday remain,</i>

8
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:56,458
<i>You can go on living as</i>
<i>much as your heart believes.</i>

9
00:00:56,541 --> 00:01:02,958
<i>You can't be born again</i>
<i>although you can change.</i>

10
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:09,666
<i>Let's stay together always.</i>

11
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:30,291
What in
the hell?

12
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:31,791
[Hana] There's
only one...

13
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:33,416
[Uo] Yeah.
Weird, huh?

14
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,458
I figured the
Prince's locker

15
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:36,291
would'a been the
best place to try...

16
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:38,541
Um, try for
what, exactly?

17
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:40,333
Y'know... It's
always in cartoons.

18
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:41,416
That thing where
you open the door

19
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,625
and all the stuff
comes pouring out?

20
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:47,791
So why does she think something
like that would happen here?

21
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:50,625
{Uo] I see now...
Cuckoo chicks...

22
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:51,916
The girls who
visited this locker

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,541
were all
cuckoo chicks...

24
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:54,625
Cuckoo?

25
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:56,708
You see, just like
the cuckoo chick

26
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:59,375
pushes another bird's
egg out of the nest...

27
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:01,083
These girls threw
out any chocolates

28
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:02,541
that were
already here,

29
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:05,625
so that their own chocolates
would get more attention.

30
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:08,375
The proof... is in
that garbage can.

31
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:10,375
[Tohru] Ah! It's
full of chocolates!

32
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:13,083
[Hana] Dammit. They messed
up my locker trick.

33
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,416
And I am the hawk,
who swoops down

34
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,708
to capture the chocolates
pushed from the nest.

35
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:18,083
All right.
You go girl.

36
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:21,041
Um, but wait... that
belongs to Yuki, right?

37
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:22,291
It's
okay...

38
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:25,375
Well, I can
already tell-

39
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:28,250
it's going to be an
interesting Valentine's Day!

40
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:42,166
Hey.

41
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,500
Hey.

42
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:55,500
K- Kyo...!

43
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:02,625
[Hana] That guy's
just been itchin'

44
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,458
for a fight
all morning...

45
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:13,041
Lovely Prince Yuki...

46
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:14,750
Lovely chocolates...

47
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:17,125
Chocolates for Prince Yuki...

48
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,125
Damn, those fan club
girls look scary today...

49
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:23,625
They're either about
to mug him or eat him,

50
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:24,958
I can't
tell which...

51
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:26,416
Valentine's must be
a stressful day

52
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,166
for the members
of the zodiac,

53
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,958
what with so many girls trying
to give them presents...

54
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:32,791
Oh! I almost forgot!
These are for you!

55
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,208
Hey... I still owe
you from last year!

56
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:37,791
Thank you very much...
What would you like in return?

57
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:40,833
Oh, no, you don't have to worry
about getting me anything.

58
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:41,833
I just wanted to
thank you both

59
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:43,625
for always being
there for me...

60
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:45,958
Kyo-Kyo...

61
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,791
Here, I got you
some chocolates...

62
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:50,625
Oh, looks like Kyo
has an admirer...

63
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:54,208
Well, who would'a thought?
Kyo-Kyo's a stud!

64
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:58,208
Wait a second... is
today... Valentine's?!

65
00:03:58,291 --> 00:03:59,250
I'm going home!

66
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:00,333
What?

67
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:02,541
No, wait... Home's
dangerous, too...

68
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:07,791
A journey!
Yeah... I'll just...

69
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:10,875
go some place far away,
where no one can find me!

70
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:23,416
K- Kyo?

71
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,541
Kyo!

72
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,625
Kyo!

73
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:38,666
Darling...
Kyo!! My love!!

74
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,708
Aw, hell!
She's here!

75
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:45,375
Why do I get the feeling
he's not happy to see Kagura?

76
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:46,291
He's not.

77
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,500
I'm here for
Valentine's, silly!

78
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:52,083
It's a very important day
for lovers to be together...

79
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,458
You're not gonna find
any lover in this house...

80
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,333
Kyo...
Behave, please.

81
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:58,333
I don't want the house
getting... you know, smashed.

82
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:02,000
Dammit! I should have left
on that journey sooner!

83
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,708
How was I supposed to know
today was Valentine's?

84
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:07,250
It's called
a 'calendar'.

85
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,250
So... did you give
him chocolates?

86
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:12,500
Well, yeah... I tried...
But for some reason...

87
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:15,041
he just won't take
them from me. Watch.

88
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,250
Happy Valentine's
Day, Kyo!

89
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:20,791
A chocolate heart, stuffed
full of my love! All for you!

90
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:22,958
Keep it! What man
in his right mind

91
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:26,375
would eat that
girly, sugary crap?!

92
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:29,541
I-I'm sorry,
but... do you...

93
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,375
do you really not
like chocolate, Kyo?

94
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:34,500
No! I
hate it!

95
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:35,791
Shut up
and eat it!

96
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:40,708
Did you hear me?
I said eat, damn you!

97
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,083
No means
no, woman!

98
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:42,500
--Eat it!

99
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:42,958
--No!

100
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:43,375
--Eat!

101
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:44,041
--Never!

102
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:45,041
--EAT IT!

103
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,250
---You'll have to
kill me first!

104
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,375
Tohru... I don't suppose
those are chocolates

105
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:49,666
you're hiding
behind your back?

106
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,916
Well, actually, I
did have some here

107
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,541
I wanted to
give everyone...

108
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:59,458
I forgot to ask... if
everyone likes chocolate...

109
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:02,333
You know,
silly me!

110
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:06,458
Miss Honda... I would
love some chocolate.

111
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:13,375
Okay! Let's see...
Here! Here's yours...

112
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:14,375
Thank you
very much.

113
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,708
And... this one's
for Shigure...

114
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:18,625
Ah! Really?
For me?

115
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:20,875
She did say,
everyone, didn't she?

116
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,208
It's not
much,

117
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:23,458
but thanks for everything
you've done for me...

118
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:26,583
Oh, no, no... I should
be the one thanking you.

119
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,375
Still...
I'm touched!

120
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,125
Tohru's Valentine's
chocolates--

121
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:33,625
how they warm the heart
and lift the soul!

122
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:37,041
Oh, and Kagura... there's
one for you, too.

123
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,750
One for me?

124
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,083
Thank you!

125
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:45,625
And I have some for Hatori,
and Hatsuharu, and Momiji...

126
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,125
I didn't know if I'd
see them today,

127
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,375
but I hope there's some way
I can give these to them...

128
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:51,875
You really did mean
'everyone', didn't you?

129
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,000
Well, they
were so cute,

130
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,166
and I had so much
fun wrapping them...

131
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,208
I guess I got a
little carried away...

132
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:00,541
Oh... but, uh... I suppose
first I should've asked

133
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,583
to see if they even
like chocolate...

134
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:05,458
Oh, don't let what
Kyo said bother you...

135
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:09,125
You see... he thinks he's
being manly... but really...

136
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:12,041
he doesn't have a clue
what true manliness is...

137
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,041
A real man would
have eaten the chocolates

138
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,291
without all
of this fuss...

139
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:17,375
To refuse
a gift...

140
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:20,208
To trample on another
person's heart like that...

141
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:23,375
It falls short of being a human
being, let alone a man...

142
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:26,583
Oh... uh-h...
No, really...

143
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:29,125
I should've known to get
something besides chocolate...

144
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:32,625
Like maybe Fist Crackers...
or Thunder Rice Cakes... or,

145
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,500
I don't know, something
more masculine sounding

146
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:36,041
that he would
have liked...

147
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,333
Those sound
delicious too...

148
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:41,916
Fine... I just
gotta eat it?

149
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,083
So... I'll
eat it!

150
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:50,541
Goodie! Look! Kyo's
eating my chocolate!

151
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,666
Um... are
you all right?

152
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:07,791
Here.

153
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:14,041
Don't worry...
I'll see you soon.

154
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,916
Who's
worried?

155
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,375
You know... I heard
something from Haru...

156
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:23,958
He said that you and Yuki are
sort of getting along now...

157
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,666
He said, if you two keep
getting to know each other...

158
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,916
You might actually become
friends one day...

159
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:35,666
I'd be very happy...
if that came true.

160
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,333
Bye-bye.

161
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:52,333
Here! Ha'ri! I got you
some Valentine's chocolates!

162
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,041
Don't hate me...
I was kidding!

163
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:58,958
They're from Tohru...
Can I come in?

164
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,125
Idiot.

165
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:03,541
We brought chocolates
for everybody!

166
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,208
[Tohru] So, just
like that,

167
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:08,250
Valentine's Day came and went
in the blink of an eye...

168
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:16,375
[Teacher] Okay, time's up.
Pencils down, everyone.

169
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,291
[Tohru] Actually, so did
the whole next month!

170
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,916
And before I knew it, we'd
finished our final exams!

171
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:24,875
Studying for the
tests is always tough,

172
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:25,958
but I love the
feeling I get

173
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,625
when all of that
hard work pays off...

174
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:28,625
Miss
Honda?

175
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,333
So how
did it go?

176
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:35,208
Oh, well... um-- Actually...
it went really well!

177
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:36,541
I knew a lot more
of the answers

178
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:37,625
than I thought
I would...

179
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:39,041
What!?

180
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:42,291
So you did good, huh?!
I'm so proud of you...

181
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:43,625
Thanks!

182
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,875
See, Tohru... I knew you
could do it if you tried.

183
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:48,583
Well, fortunately, I had
Yuki there to help me study.

184
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,625
He always took his time and
explained things clearly,

185
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,875
even though he had
his own work to do...

186
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:54,083
Really, thank
you so much!

187
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:56,375
I couldn't have done
it without you!

188
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:59,625
Oh, I... I don't
know about that...

189
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:03,250
Oh, Prince Yuki... The Prince
never smiles like that...

190
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:06,875
What is it? What's he talking
about? I have to know...

191
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,958
Ah, but with Electric
Girl over there,

192
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,500
I'm too scared to
get any closer!

193
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:17,333
Say, Saki... I'll bet you
did good on the test, huh?

194
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:18,875
You think so?

195
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:21,958
Yeah, sure... You're pretty
smart... and you're psychic...

196
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,291
Seems like
it'd be easy...

197
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:25,333
I mean, you pretty much
aced the midterms, right?

198
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:30,333
I suppose... Since then... I've
had to take remedial lessons...

199
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:31,791
They even called
my parents...

200
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:34,916
Yes... My mother
cried for days...

201
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:37,416
But, I
thought...

202
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,125
you know, with your
psychic powers and all--

203
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:42,541
I'd be able to guess
all of the answers?

204
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:45,000
It seems I'm dumber than
my powers can make up for.

205
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:46,833
Don't get too down
on yourself...

206
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:49,541
I'm sure there's an even bigger
dummy around here somewhere...

207
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:54,125
Hey... you sure as hell
better not be talkin' about me.

208
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,375
What? Who else would
I be talking about?

209
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:57,541
Oh yeah?!

210
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:58,458
Well no one's ever had
to call my parents

211
00:10:58,541 --> 00:10:59,958
to tell em' my
grades sucked!

212
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,708
[Boy 1] Aww, does Kyo-Kyo
study like a good little boy?

213
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:04,333
Don't call
me Kyo-Kyo!

214
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,541
[Hana] Please. You couldn't
study to save your life.

215
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:07,875
[Kyo] You are
so full of it!

216
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:11,041
Uh-huh...
Let me guess...

217
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:13,416
You're the kinda guy who
crams at the last minute...

218
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,833
Then you get to
school and freak out

219
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:16,208
'cause you studied for
the wrong test...

220
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:18,125
Okay, that
does it...

221
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:19,625
You
know...

222
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:21,625
Lately, when he's been shutting
himself up in his room...

223
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:24,125
it seems like he really
has been studying hard.

224
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:25,666
So it
would seem.

225
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,375
It's nice when I think about
it, how he looked so peaceful,

226
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,458
working quietly
at his desk...

227
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:32,166
But I guess when it
comes down to it,

228
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,083
Kyo's the kind of person
who needs a little bit more

229
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,000
excitement
in his day...

230
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,791
Ah... Miss Honda...
A word please?

231
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:39,791
Y-Yes sir...

232
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,583
Is something
wrong?

233
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:51,458
Uh? Oh... well,
uh... not at all...

234
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:53,375
I just... have
to work hard!

235
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:56,083
Part time job,
here I come!!

236
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,875
Well... it's good
to have you back...

237
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,375
So you've finished
with your final exams?

238
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:16,166
Uh-huh! So,
starting today,

239
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,666
I'd like to work as
much as I can...

240
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,416
Just tell me
what to do!

241
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,666
Let me get
that for you!

242
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,125
Such a nice girl.

243
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:37,708
Tohru!
You're home!

244
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,541
Oh! Momiji!

245
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,708
I just got here too!
Come on, come on!

246
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:43,833
Let's go in!
This way! This way!

247
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:46,708
Where does that boy
get all of his energy?

248
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:48,333
This is my first time
to Shigure's house.

249
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,041
Isn't it
exciting?!

250
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,541
Hello there!

251
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,541
Hi, I'm home
from my job!

252
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:54,833
Welcome back.

253
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:57,333
Great... The annoying
little brat's here.

254
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,958
Ah! Someone just
got out of the bath!

255
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,375
Kyo-oh!!

256
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,750
I swear! It bugs me every
time you open your mouth!

257
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:07,750
Waah! Kyo's
picking on me-e-e!

258
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,916
Momiji... I made a
snack, if you're hungry.

259
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,375
Oh, I am!

260
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,958
You see! Like I
said! Every time!

261
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,708
Waa-aa-aah...

262
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:19,375
Kyo...

263
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,541
[Shigure] Momiji? Have you told
us to what we owe the pleasure

264
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:23,041
of your company
this evening?

265
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:25,041
Mm-mm,
not yet.

266
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,500
I have a
question for Tohru!

267
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,708
Uh...
yes?

268
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:31,208
I'll bet you don't know
what day it is tomorrow!

269
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:34,791
Let's see, tomorrow...
um, It's March 14th, right?

270
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,708
Bin-go!

271
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:39,041
And March 14th
is White Day!

272
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,208
So tomorrow, I'm
giving you a present--

273
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:43,583
It's a trip to
a Hot Spring!

274
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,291
I call it,

275
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:49,000
"Me and Tohru's Super-Relaxing
Hot Spring Steam Trip!"

276
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,666
I don't think you
have to name it.

277
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,625
A hot spring?
Which one?

278
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:55,791
You know, there's that one
place the Sohma's run, right?

279
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:57,250
Ahh, I
see...

280
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:00,041
I don't
know...

281
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,833
An invitation to an
expensive sounding place

282
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:03,125
like a hot
spring?

283
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:05,208
It's too much! I
couldn't accept!

284
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:06,625
I'd just be
asking for it!

285
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:09,166
Uh, you know, Tohru,
it's just a hot spring.

286
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,416
It's not like he's
flying you off to Paris,

287
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,041
or anything
like that.

288
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,875
It would be a real
shame to turn it down.

289
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,375
You should go.

290
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:17,375
It'll be a good chance to
get away from it all, relax...

291
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,958
I'm sorry, I thought
you'd be happy to go...

292
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,458
No, I am happy...
Thank you so much.

293
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,333
Yuki and Kyo
are coming too!

294
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:25,583
Why don't you
try asking

295
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,625
before you start making
plans for everyone!

296
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:31,708
Aa-www, go with
us, go with us!

297
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:33,625
Forget it! And
whining like that

298
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,416
isn't gonna
change my mind!

299
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,166
Yuki... will
you come?

300
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,958
Of course...
I wouldn't miss it.

301
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:41,750
Ya-aye!
Yaye!

302
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,500
Okay, now I really
don't want to go.

303
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:49,250
Why not? You don't have
to worry about money...

304
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:51,375
I've been saving
up my allowance.

305
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:54,333
That's not
the problem.

306
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:57,541
Oh, speaking of
money, Tohru...

307
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,041
I hear you still haven't 
paid last month's dues

308
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,541
toward your class
field trip fund.

309
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:03,583
I got a call from
your grandfather.

310
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,583
Apparently, someone
from the school called him.

311
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,250
He said he'd pay
for you if you needed.

312
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,583
No, no, no! I can't
ask him to do that!

313
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,750
It would be too much
trouble! He can't! No!

314
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:14,708
Last month there was
just... a lot going on...

315
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,541
but I'll be able to catch up
with the money I earn at my job

316
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,375
this month, so
it's alright.

317
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:21,250
I already explained everything
to the teacher in charge...

318
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:25,041
So... I'm sorry... I'm sorry
you had to hear about it.

319
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,250
But,
Tohru...

320
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,958
You worked a pretty fair
amount last month...

321
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:29,625
So how
is it--

322
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:33,333
She bought all of that
Valentine's chocolate...

323
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:36,208
So, hey! You're gonna
go on a class trip, huh?

324
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:37,875
Oh... I
don't know...

325
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:38,875
Wha---?!

326
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:39,583
Y-yes?

327
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:47,500
Water... hot
bath... you go...

328
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:50,458
Uh...
O--kay?

329
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:56,333
Impressive... You're
learning self-control.

330
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,083
But at any
rate...

331
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:01,041
Chocolate doesn't exactly
fall from the sky...

332
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:04,041
Tohru had to have paid for
it out of her own pocket.

333
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:07,375
How is it we didn't
realize that at the time?

334
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:09,875
It's 'cause she was so
damn happy about it!

335
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,708
How could we know
she was broke?!

336
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,875
She didn't have to
get that stuff for us!

337
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:16,041
But hey- she thought it'd
be fun to spend all her money!

338
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,041
She could've bought
herself new clothes...

339
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,416
or paid for her class
trip, or somethin'!

340
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,708
Talk about stupid! I mean,
what was she thinking?!

341
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:26,416
All she's doin' is making
things hard on herself!

342
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,083
Oh, hey...
you know what?

343
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,750
There's this kid in my
class who reads a lot.

344
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,000
Huh?

345
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,625
Yeah, so... he just
got this new book,

346
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:34,791
and he brought it
with him yesterday...

347
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:37,250
It was called, A Guide to
the World's Greatest Fools.

348
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,666
He's always bringing funny
books like that. This one time,

349
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,625
he brought one called,
The Universe of Stew...

350
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:43,625
Did you have a point
in there somewhere?

351
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,541
Oh, right...
So anyway...

352
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:48,041
A bunch of us sat down and
read this book together...

353
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,875
There was this
one story in it...

354
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,041
I remember,
it was called,

355
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,958
The Most Foolish
Traveler in the World.

356
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:56,458
You see...
Once upon a time,

357
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:59,000
there was a foolish traveler
who had gone on a journey.

358
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,541
Why was he foolish?
Well, because

359
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,375
he was fooled by
everyone he met!

360
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:05,625
Please, some money
for medicine...?

361
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:07,000
Everywhere
he went,

362
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:09,083
people made up all kinds
of sad stories to tell him,

363
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:11,416
and the traveler fell
for every one of them.

364
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,083
I have a sick
younger sister...

365
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:17,583
I don't have money to buy
seeds to plant in my fields.

366
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:20,625
Pretty soon, his
money, his clothes,

367
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:23,500
even his shoes had been
cheated away from him.

368
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:26,541
But the foolish traveler
was always glad to help.

369
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:29,041
And he always told the
people the same thing.

370
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:31,625
He said: I wish
you happiness.

371
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:35,375
But by this point, though, the
traveler was completely naked,

372
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,833
and with nothing
left to cover himself,

373
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,208
he decided to
leave the main road

374
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,291
and travel through
the dense forest,

375
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,875
where no one
could see him...

376
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:45,791
But soon, he was
discovered by the goblins

377
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,625
that lived in
the woods.

378
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:50,291
The goblins wanted to
eat the traveler's body,

379
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:51,916
so they begged
and pleaded,

380
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,666
and used kind words to
try and trick him...

381
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:58,666
Of course, the
traveler was fooled.

382
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,250
First, he let the goblins
eat one of his legs.

383
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:04,375
Then an arm. Then
more and more...

384
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,625
Before it
was over,

385
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:07,708
all that the traveler
had left was his head.

386
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:12,041
He'd even given his eyes away
to the last of the goblins...

387
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:15,041
And as that last goblin was
eating the traveler's eyes,

388
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,708
he turned and said
"Thank you, traveler.

389
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:20,583
In return, I leave
you this present."

390
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,708
What the goblin left
was a slip of paper,

391
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:24,708
with the word "fool"
written on it.

392
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:28,375
The traveler couldn't see it.
He didn't know what it was.

393
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:31,791
Even so, tears began
to flow down his face.

394
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:33,083
"Thank you,"
he said.

395
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:35,708
"This is the first present
anyone ever gave me.

396
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:39,708
I'm so happy. I'm so
happy. Thank you."

397
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:45,458
Even without his eyes, he cried
and cried, great tears of joy.

398
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:53,583
Then, the traveler died,
the smile still on his face.

399
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:59,958
And that's... the
end of the story.

400
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:02,208
Right after we heard
that yesterday,

401
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:03,250
all of the other
kids in the class

402
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:06,041
started making fun
of the traveler.

403
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,041
But, while they
did that...

404
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:09,833
I closed my eyes and
thought about him

405
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,583
a little
bit longer...

406
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:15,166
I thought about how he
had given everything away,

407
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,750
until all he had
left was his head...

408
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:20,416
and how at the end, he
still cried for joy

409
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:24,416
as he said
thank you...

410
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,750
And then I
realized...

411
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:32,958
Ah, I feel so sorry
for him... See?

412
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:36,958
Loss, hardship,
things like that?

413
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:41,166
You can't only focus on
them... The traveler didn't...

414
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:44,291
He never thought about
his own troubles at all...

415
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:46,541
I imagine that it probably
does sound foolish

416
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:47,875
to some people.

417
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:51,458
But not to me. I don't
think he's foolish at all.

418
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,125
Even though other
people probably think

419
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:54,916
he was
being tricked?

420
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,541
I don't
think he was.

421
00:19:56,625 --> 00:20:01,083
I think he did exactly
what he wanted to do...

422
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:04,416
I think...
More than anything,

423
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,666
he just wanted to make
other people happy.

424
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,875
What about you,
Yuki? Kyo?

425
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:16,166
What do you think?
Really, is that foolish?

426
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,708
When you close your eyes
and think about it,

427
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,708
is that
what it is?

428
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:33,250
[Kyo] I'm
going for you.

429
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,875
Oh... Good morning...
Did you have a good nigh--

430
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:37,750
The hot
spring...

431
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,208
I'm going.
For you.

432
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:43,916
I didn't make anything, or get
you anything for White Day...

433
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
So instead, I'll put up
with that damn Yuki,

434
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:49,916
and I'll go to the
hot spring for you...

435
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,375
Maybe you don't
care either way...

436
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:55,291
you know, whether I
go or not... but...

437
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:07,208
No, no!
That's great!

438
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:09,333
It'll be much more fun
if you're there too!

439
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:10,750
That's
wonderful!

440
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:15,750
Thank you so much! I'm so
happy! Thank you so much!

441
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:20,666
You know...

442
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,291
You really
are somethin'...

443
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,458
You know that?

444
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,916
Kyo's got the hots
this morning!

445
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,500
I do not!

446
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:34,833
He's got
the hots!

447
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:36,625
Shut up!

448
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:39,125
Waah-haah!

449
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:40,375
What's going on?

450
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:42,708
Ah! You're up
just in time!

451
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:44,416
Kyo just told me that
he's decided to come

452
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,458
to the hot
spring with us!

453
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:53,958
Well... I suppose
we'll survive.

454
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:55,541
This will be fun...

455
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:59,041
All of us together, on a Super
Relaxing Hot Spring Steam Trip!

456
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:01,500
I just know we'll
have a wonderful time!

457
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:06,916
<i>Now let's all gather,</i>

458
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,500
<i>Enjoying the company we share,</i>

459
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:17,791
<i>Our tears will dissolve</i>
<i>into thin air,</i>

460
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:23,750
<i>As we drink up</i>
<i>this wonderful life.</i>

461
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:28,708
<i>La, la, la...</i>

462
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:34,791
<i>Takin' in all the</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

463
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:39,875
<i>La, la, la...</i>

464
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:45,916
<i>Drinkin' up all this</i>
<i>good love and life.</i>

465
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
<i>La, la, la...</i>

466
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:56,791
<i>Take it in all this</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

467
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,250
[Tohru] I never dreamed
giving out Valentine's

468
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:27,333
would mean I would
be whisked away

469
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:29,208
to a place as fancy
as a hot spring.

470
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:30,875
It all seems to
good to be true.

471
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:32,833
Like I'm a princess
in a fariy tale.

472
00:23:32,916 --> 00:23:34,500
[Momiji] There's still
time before dinner.

473
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:36,750
So let's take a
bath OK, Tohru?

474
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:38,791
[Tohru] My first
open-air bath.

475
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,666
And the spring seems
almost big enough

476
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,583
for someone like
Momiji to swim in.

477
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:46,083
[Yuki] I do hope you find it
to your liking, princess.

478
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:49,500
Yes! Yes! Of course
I like it. Really!

479
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:50,708
Thank you so much!

480
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:52,208
[Yuki] I had a
hard time deciding

481
00:23:52,291 --> 00:23:54,000
what to get
you at first,

482
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:57,500
but when I saw this, well,
it just seemed to suit you.

483
00:23:57,583 --> 00:24:00,875
[Tohru] Sometimes he really
does seem like a prince.
