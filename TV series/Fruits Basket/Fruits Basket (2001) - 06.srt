1
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:18,125
<i>I was so happy when you smiled,</i>

2
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:21,708
<i>Your smile breaks</i>
<i>through the clouds of grey,</i>

3
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:28,625
<i>Far from the sunny days</i>
<i>that lie in sleep.</i>

4
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:31,583
<i>Waiting with patience</i>
<i>for the Spring,</i>

5
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:35,583
<i>when the flowers will</i>
<i>bloom renewed again,</i>

6
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:42,625
<i>knowing there's more</i>
<i>beyond the pain of today.</i>

7
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:49,000
<i>Although the scars</i>
<i>of yesterday remain,</i>

8
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:56,458
<i>You can go on living as</i>
<i>much as your heart believes.</i>

9
00:00:56,541 --> 00:01:02,958
<i>You can't be born again</i>
<i>although you can change.</i>

10
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:09,666
<i>Let's stay together always.</i>

11
00:01:33,416 --> 00:01:36,041
[Tohru] Um, As long as I'm
going to be living here,

12
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:37,208
do you think it
would be all right

13
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:39,041
if I told two of my
friends where I am?

14
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:42,666
I'm sure they'll really want
to know... if that's okay.

15
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:46,625
So long as you don't mention
anything about, you know,

16
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:49,250
the zodiac and whatnot, I
don't particularly mind...

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,041
Thanks
so much!

18
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:55,291
You see... The Sohma
family has been living

19
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:57,583
under a secret curse
for generations.

20
00:01:57,666 --> 00:01:59,875
If they're ever hugged by
someone from the opposite sex,

21
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:03,166
they transform into animals
from the Chinese Zodiac!

22
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:07,541
It's hard to believe,
but it's true!

23
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:08,750
And naturally,
this is a secret

24
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:12,250
they can't allow anyone
to find out about...

25
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,083
What!?

26
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:15,750
So not only were you
living in a tent,

27
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:18,250
but now you've moved into
Prince Yuki's house?!

28
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:19,750
Seriously?!

29
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:22,708
Yes. I'm sorry for not saying
anything about it sooner.

30
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:26,166
There was a lot that happened,
but everything's fine now...

31
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,708
And they're all
really nice people.

32
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:31,083
So there's nothing
to worry about!

33
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:34,750
This is definitely a bolt out
of the blue... I wonder...

34
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:36,708
How will the Prince
Yuki Fan Club girls

35
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:38,750
react when they
hear the news?

36
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:42,541
I thought it was
strange how you've been

37
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:45,041
spending so much time talking
to the prince and orange-top

38
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:48,291
lately... Now I
understand...

39
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:51,000
Perhaps we should have
them invite us over.

40
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:53,166
I'd like to
see for myself

41
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,958
whether or not this is
a suitable environment

42
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,208
for you to
be living...

43
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:57,875
Hey, great idea. Let's
check it out right now.

44
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:00,125
Wait. If we show
up unexpectedly,

45
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,416
they may not
serve snacks.

46
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,833
Oooh, another good point.
You're two for two.

47
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:05,791
Okay then... we'll stay
over tomorrow night.

48
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:12,041
Uh...
wait...

49
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,875
Okay!

50
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:16,708
High-school girls...
High-school girls...

51
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:19,666
1 -2 -3...
High-school girls...

52
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,000
Ahh... I can't help but
wonder what kind of girls

53
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:23,208
these friends of
Tohru's are...

54
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:26,916
A Yankee
and a psychic.

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Ah...
They're here!

56
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,541
[Tohru] Hi, come in! I guess
you found the house okay.

57
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:33,875
[Hana] No.
We got lost...

58
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,833
I'm thinking this
was a bad idea.

59
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,250
Just don't do
anything stupid.

60
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:40,000
That goes double for
you, you damn rat.

61
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:42,375
Yes... all of us would
do well to be careful

62
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:43,875
while they're here.
Because I wonder,

63
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,416
if either of these
girls were to find out

64
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:50,750
about the family curse, what
would happen... do you think?

65
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,041
[Shigure] At
the very least,

66
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,833
I suppose that Tohru would
no longer be allowed

67
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:57,541
to stay in
this house.

68
00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:00,166
Well, either way...
something's bound to turn out!

69
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,916
Que sera sera.

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,083
You just like hearing
yourself talk, don't you?

71
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:05,750
[Hana]
There's a dog.

72
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,625
Over there.

73
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,625
Oh! Yes,
that's a dog!

74
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:13,791
[Tohru] So, these
are my friends.

75
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:16,708
Arisa Uotani and
Saki Hanajima.

76
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:17,208
Hey.

77
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:18,791
A pleasure.

78
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:23,000
Yes, welcome, welcome! Please,
make yourselves right at home.

79
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,458
Say, it's 'Shigure',
right? This is your place?

80
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,583
So what do you do to pay
the rent around here?

81
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:31,833
Oh-ho, me? I'm a writer...
A novelist, actually.

82
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:34,416
Did you say
you're a novelist?

83
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,583
Why the heck are
you so surprised?

84
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,708
This is the first
she's heard of it.

85
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:41,416
Right... I really
I had no idea...

86
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,166
What was it, again? Fine
literature, or something?

87
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,250
Uh-huh... that's right.
This sort of story.

88
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,333
Oh sorry, my mistake...
This is my real work...

89
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:56,333
This one here was just
something I did for fun.

90
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:58,375
So that makes it okay for you
to write that dime-store smut?!

91
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,208
You're a sicko,
you know that?!

92
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:01,500
What were
you thinking...?

93
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:04,125
Shigure, that's amazing!
I mean, to think

94
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:07,833
I actually know someone as
important as a novelist!

95
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,083
Careful,
Miss Honda.

96
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:10,541
You don't want to
inflate his ego too much.

97
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,291
Like his head could
get any bigger

98
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:13,375
than it
already is...

99
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:22,166
How wonderful! I just
made another new discovery!

100
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,583
[Shigure] Well,
enough about me.

101
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:26,500
Why don't you tell us
something about yourselves?

102
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:28,750
You could start by telling
us how you met Tohru.

103
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,208
What,
serious?

104
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:33,250
I'm sure we'd all like to
hear! Right Yuki? Right Kyo?

105
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,208
[Tohru]
Uo saved me

106
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,500
Hey, pinhead! You better
not step on those... you!

107
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:46,125
Wait let me back up... This
one time in middle school,

108
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:50,041
I dropped all my
notes in the hall...

109
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,666
What have I
done...?

110
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,500
Heh heh... Yeah,
I remember that.

111
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:57,208
I guess I could get a
little... 'rough' back then.

112
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,750
[Both]
Back then?

113
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:01,416
Well, you were still a
Yankee then... Weren't you?

114
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,000
Right... I started runnin'
with them in the 5th grade?

115
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:06,000
You always used to wear
those masks all the time...

116
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:07,583
And I had my
eyebrows thinned out,

117
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:08,541
and wore those
long skirts.

118
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:09,666
[Hana]
You're forgetting,

119
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,333
You do all of those
things now, Arisa.

120
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:15,125
I guess
you're right.

121
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,666
That's lovely... She's
so... How shall I say it-

122
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,250
by putting it
into words,

123
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,291
I'm afraid the nobility of it
all would only be obscured...

124
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:22,291
Of what?

125
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:24,041
You know,
she's so spunky!

126
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,166
You sick
bastard.

127
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,583
How sad... Love,
doomed from the start.

128
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:30,291
You're
reading that?

129
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,250
That silly little thing?
Oh I'm flattered!

130
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,166
So what do
you think?

131
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,416
You don't want to
know what I think.

132
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,958
Oh... no??

133
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,916
But when is
Volume 2 coming out?

134
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,250
Look, can we just knock it
off with the books? Okay?

135
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,250
Everyone's getting
along so well.

136
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,625
It's so nice

137
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:49,166
that we can all have a good
time together like this!

138
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,041
I know! I just thought of
something fun we could do!

139
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:56,750
Wait here,
I'll be right back!

140
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,750
So then... Saki,
you never did tell us

141
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,541
how you and Tohru
got to be friends...

142
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:03,916
Are you sure you're
ready to hear?

143
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,541
Oh ah... that's okay, as
long as you're friends now!

144
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,541
That's what's
important!

145
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:10,875
We were in
middle school,

146
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:13,125
and I was transferred
into Tohru's class...

147
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,291
Ah-h...
is that so?

148
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:17,875
Yes... You see, at
my previous school,

149
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:23,166
I had caused something
of a disturbance...

150
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,375
Well, that is a wonderful
story, isn't it.

151
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,083
But I just remembered I
have some work to do,

152
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:29,166
so if you kids
will excuse me...

153
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:29,875
He ran off.

154
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:31,500
Ran the
hell away...

155
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,916
I gotta say, I didn't know
what to make of all this

156
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,250
when she
told us,

157
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,916
but it looks like Tohru's
fitting right in here...

158
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm happy
for her...

159
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:41,250
...and I guess I
can understand

160
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:45,041
why she didn't want to
say anything at first...

161
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:49,166
But still...

162
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,708
[Uo] We made
a promise.

163
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:52,458
The three of us swore
over Kyoko's grave,

164
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:53,916
that when the
time came,

165
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,833
we would be there to help
each other, no matter what.

166
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,916
[Uo] That probably sounds a
little bit overdramatic.

167
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,875
But it wasn't
really, for us...

168
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:08,125
After all, Tohru was our first
real friend and everything...

169
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:17,000
Tohru... Tohru and
Kyoko, both... you see,

170
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:20,541
they were there for me when
I needed someone most...

171
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,125
Thanks
to them,

172
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:24,166
I found the strength to climb
my way up out of all the crap

173
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,541
I had fallen into...

174
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:27,375
They helped me to
believe in myself..

175
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:30,375
that I could
change if I wanted...

176
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:36,375
And when I met
the two of them...

177
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:38,000
for the first time,

178
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:40,750
I discovered that I
did want to change...

179
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,750
I wanted to be someone
Tohru could be proud

180
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:45,833
to call
her friend,

181
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:48,833
the way I was proud
to call her mine...

182
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:57,958
[Uo] So, this time around, with
everything that's happened...

183
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:00,541
the fact that I wasn't
there to help Tohru...

184
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:08,666
...that bothers me.

185
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,458
I mean, that she
would even think

186
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:14,208
she had to go through all
this trouble by herself...

187
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,833
Maybe she doesn't think
she can count on us...

188
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:21,083
Or maybe we're just not
that good... as friends...

189
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,958
Nah, I just don't think
she's the kinda' girl

190
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,208
who worries about
stuff like that.

191
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:26,708
Miss Honda is...

192
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,208
she's the kind of
person who puts others'

193
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:33,375
well-being
before her own...

194
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:36,958
Sorry it
took so long...

195
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:40,333
I hope you're all ready to
play... Rich Man, Poor Man!

196
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,541
[Hana] Ah, that's
a fine idea, Tohru.

197
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:45,000
[Uo] Okay, how 'bout we pick
it up where we left off?

198
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,083
I don't think I
got to finish

199
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,500
makin' a fool
outta' orange-top here.

200
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,541
[Kyo] Yeah, talk it up!
But this time, when I win,

201
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,000
you have to dye
your hair black!

202
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,541
[Uo] Oh? Well,
when you lose,

203
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,166
you have to bleach all
the dye outta' your hair,

204
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,166
and leave
it white!

205
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,666
[Kyo] It's naturally
this color!

206
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,666
[Hana] Is
that right?

207
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,916
[Kyo]
That's right!

208
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,375
Yuki... Would you like
to shuffle the cards?

209
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:05,833
Uh..
I...

210
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,750
Sure.

211
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:10,500
[Uo] Why, you rotten little-
You and your cheap-ass tricks!

212
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:11,708
[Kyo] Cheap nothin'!
That's fair game!

213
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:13,750
You're the one
playin' tricks, Yankee!

214
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,583
Next time you pull that crap,
I'm gonna light you up!

215
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:16,750
Go ahead
and try!

216
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:17,833
It'll be the dumbest
thing you ever did!

217
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,333
I will take
you out!

218
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,541
Oh yeah, some tough guy!
You're runnin' away!

219
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:24,000
Who's running?!
I'm going to the bathroom!

220
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,083
Aww...
Gotta take a leak?

221
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,416
What's it
to you?!

222
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,583
Better hurry! We don't
want you to piss yourself!

223
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:31,208
Dammit, you
got a foul mouth!

224
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:40,416
[Yuki] Something
wrong, Miss Uotani?

225
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,375
Uh... no...

226
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,666
Ahh. Well,
that's good.

227
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,416
It's just that things
sounded like they were

228
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,750
getting pretty heated
there for a minute...

229
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,166
I know! Until Kyo gets
back from the bathroom,

230
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,291
why don't we all play a
quick game of Sevens!

231
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:59,125
Yeah...
sure let's play...

232
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,416
Uo!

233
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:07,666
[Yuki] Miss
Honda, look out!

234
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:12,708
Tohru...

235
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:14,250
Are you okay?

236
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,541
Are you
hurt at all?

237
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,000
No... I-
I'm all right.

238
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:35,000
Ah! You see? I didn't
fall! Just cleaning up!

239
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:40,291
Scrub, scrub, scrub,
scrub... hehe... see...?

240
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:41,833
Stupid cat!

241
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:42,500
Damn rat.

242
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:52,166
[Uo] Ol' orange top
sure is takin' his time.

243
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,541
[Tohru]
Sure is...

244
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,416
And the prince just up
and disappeared, I guess...

245
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:00,666
You're right. I wonder where
our kind hosts have run off to.

246
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,000
[Uo] For
the love of...

247
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,166
we can't even start this
game of Sevens, you know?

248
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,500
A cat...

249
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,583
Oh! You're playing
Sevens, right...?

250
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:12,875
That sounds like fun! Think
you have room for one more?

251
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:15,000
Well if it isn't the
master novelist...

252
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:17,000
You any good
at this game?

253
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,375
Well, you
should know,

254
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:22,208
in the old days they used to
call me The Sevens Bandit.

255
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:24,708
Oh? Really?!
That's incredible!!

256
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,625
I'll say.
It's a lie.

257
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,083
But enough
about me!

258
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:31,041
Let's get to playing, shall
we? So what are the rules?

259
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:38,500
You guys hear that? Sounded
like some kinda' 'boom'.

260
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,875
[Hana] There was a
definite, 'boom'.

261
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:45,166
This is not good! I think Kyo
just changed back to normal!

262
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,708
Unless we do something, those
two are going to see him.

263
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,666
And what's worse,
he'll be naked!

264
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,291
I know! For now, I'll
throw him Yuki's clothes!

265
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:54,166
Maybe no one
will notice...

266
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:57,166
It doesn't matter.
Anything to cover him up!

267
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:57,875
Kyo!

268
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,125
Catch this, Kyo!

269
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:06,958
Huh...? Why
is this so heavy?

270
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:17,041
Ahh! I thought
you'd run away!

271
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:20,375
I'm so glad you're
back! Uh, um, Spot.

272
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:23,541
Spot?!

273
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:32,166
That's odd... It appears
we've run out of snacks...

274
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,750
I'll go find
the kitchen.

275
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,708
Oh, no! Kyo
just changed back,

276
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:44,416
and the idiot's already
transformed again! Okay!

277
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,916
I've got to
cause a diversion.

278
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,916
Now Yuki, too?!

279
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:04,458
That's weird...

280
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,250
I swear I thought I saw
orange-top in here...

281
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,875
Miss Honda... I
think Spot is trying

282
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,458
to tell us he's
hungry, don't you?

283
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:14,500
Yeah... That must be
it! Here! C'mon boy!

284
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:15,833
Let's go into
the kitchen, Spot!

285
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:19,541
Tohru, wait.

286
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:23,083
Uh... yes?

287
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:26,125
Some more snacks?
If you don't mind.

288
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:27,750
Oh! Sure!

289
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,500
I'm really
sorry...

290
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,916
I promise, the last thing
I wanted was for this

291
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,166
to cause everybody
so much trouble...

292
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,041
Hey, nuffin' to
abologishe for.

293
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,750
I'm not
so sure...

294
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:46,375
Tohru, if these people
are important to you,

295
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:49,208
then they're important to us
too... Do you understand?

296
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:59,041
Yes. I understand.
Thank you.

297
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:03,083
Oh, but I'm sure Yuki's
wondering where we are...

298
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:04,625
Come on...

299
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:08,875
This game isn't going
very well... now is it?

300
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:17,833
Uh... Why don't I-?
I'll go check on her...

301
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:21,208
Sorry to keep
you waitin-

302
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:22,708
Miss
Honda!!

303
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:25,041
Oh no, Yuki!

304
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,625
H- help!

305
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:30,833
Eh? But you're mixed in
with all of the jelly buns.

306
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,416
I can't tell
where you are!

307
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,791
Here,
Miss Honda!

308
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,875
Where... ?
Where are you?

309
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,375
Here!

310
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:41,375
Let's see... jelly bun...
jelly bun... jelly bun, uh...

311
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:45,375
Ah!! Yuki,
it's you!

312
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,875
Wait! Miss Honda,
that's a...

313
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:50,000
...a jelly bun!!

314
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,958
Hey-y! Tohru,
nice catch!

315
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:55,500
Although, most of
them still fell.

316
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,375
Maybe I was lucky
she didn't catch me.

317
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:00,208
She squeezed that bun so hard,
all the filling came out!!

318
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:06,833
I thought we might at least
find something to wear in here.

319
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,250
So it's
empty, then?

320
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:11,375
Yeah. Tohru is rather thorough
about doing the wash.

321
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,291
Aww, hell with it!
Just let 'em see us!

322
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:14,875
All we gotta do is erase
those girls' memories

323
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,875
and we'll be
fine, right?

324
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,208
I suppose that's true, as
long as you're okay with that.

325
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:20,875
Okay with what?

326
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:23,166
It would mean Tohru's memory
would have to be erased as well.

327
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,750
Stay here! I'm gonna
get us some clothes!

328
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,750
Arisa...

329
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:51,916
You're about
to step on...

330
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:01,166
[Uo] Yeah?
Step on what?

331
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:04,250
[Hana] An orange cat, with
clothes tied around its neck...

332
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:10,125
...being carried in the mouth
of a dog... who went that way.

333
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:15,041
A-one-two, one-two,
one-two, one-two...

334
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:16,375
You know, nothing gets
the blood flowing

335
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:19,708
like a rubdown
with a dry towel!

336
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:22,875
A-one-two, one-two,
one, two, one-two...

337
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:23,750
Idiot.

338
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:29,000
This is
a fine bed.

339
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,250
Isn't it? Shigure
bought it for me.

340
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:32,708
Well... from
the looks of it,

341
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:34,541
he must really
think big of you, huh?

342
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,708
That's exactly
how it appears.

343
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:37,875
As long as
he's at it,

344
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:39,208
this room could
probably use some more,

345
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,833
you know,
girl stuff.

346
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,041
Like right here.

347
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,333
You should have him put
in a dressing table,

348
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:44,500
or something
like that.

349
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,083
Oh, no, I
couldn't!

350
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,583
I couldn't think
about wanting more!

351
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:52,750
I'd be asking
for it! Really...

352
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:55,125
I mean, I've only
just started to realize

353
00:17:55,208 --> 00:18:01,166
how lucky a person I am to have
so much already, you know?

354
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,500
[Shigure] Tohru, if these
people are important to you,

355
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:09,875
then they're important to
us too... Do you understand?

356
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:12,708
I have a new home, living
here with the Sohmas...

357
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,916
And I have the two
most wonderful friends

358
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,875
in the whole world, who
care about me so, so much...

359
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,416
Just knowing that I can
always count on you

360
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,625
to be there for me, and how
much strength that gives me...

361
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:26,625
I'm already so lucky.

362
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,666
If I'm not thankful
for what I have,

363
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:33,541
I'd just be
asking for it!

364
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:36,375
I love
you both.

365
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,083
Nah, I just don't think
she's the kinda' girl

366
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:39,250
who worries about
stuff like that.

367
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,541
Miss Honda is... she's
the kind of person

368
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:45,166
who puts others' well-being
before her own...

369
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:49,541
I guess they do understand
her. Pretty well, I'd say...

370
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:53,333
That they do... Tohru
is that kind of girl.

371
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:58,500
Invincible love.

372
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,333
That's right.

373
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:06,958
Right...

374
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,833
Uh... Hey,
Yuki... Are you-??

375
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:32,250
So, Yuki. You're having a
hard time waking up as usual...

376
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:36,833
Yeah, yeah, just
keep movin' will ya'...

377
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:39,583
[Tohru] Wow, Kyo. With as much
as you want to beat Yuki,

378
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:41,875
you still don't try to sneak
up on him when he's like this.

379
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:43,000
It's very
admirable.

380
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:45,166
No, that's not it.
It's not like that.

381
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,833
He's stronger when
he's half-asleep.

382
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:50,833
Ah, so you have tried
to attack him, then?

383
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:52,708
Yeah, I tried! And
I got beat even worse

384
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:53,958
than when
he's awake Okay?!

385
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:55,333
Do you know
what that means?!!

386
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:57,125
It means that stupid,
dirty little sissy rat-boy

387
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:59,666
is always
holding back on me!

388
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,958
What gives?! I thought
you were still out of it!

389
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:03,833
Your stupid
voice woke me up.

390
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:05,375
Fine! I don't care
anymore... dammit!

391
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,625
Asleep or not, it's
you and me! Right now!

392
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:10,000
I'm gonna mop up this
kitchen with your face!

393
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,875
How can you even talk
about this nonsense

394
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,541
so early
in the morning?

395
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:14,458
A cat
and mouse...

396
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:18,750
That's what
they're like.

397
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:19,833
You think?

398
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,208
The way they're...
fighting,

399
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:22,541
it's like a
cat and mouse...

400
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:25,333
Just like the ones
in the old cartoon.

401
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:28,416
Yeah... Something
or other and Jerry.

402
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,041
That's right!
These guys are still here!

403
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:34,916
So, the two of you don't
get along too well, do ya'?

404
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,291
I suppose not...

405
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:39,375
Even so, this seems like
a pleasant enough house...

406
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,666
Which is good, because if it
had been a poor environment

407
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,416
for Tohru to
be living in...

408
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,916
There are many things I would
have to do to correct it.

409
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,083
Yes...
Many things.

410
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,291
What... kind of
'many things'?

411
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:58,041
But I can see that
the two of you...

412
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:01,041
You both have fine
electric signals...

413
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,125
[Hana] Oh, you didn't know?
That's even better, I think.

414
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,708
Well, I'm sure you'll
do your best to be nice...

415
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:11,666
To Tohru,
we mean.

416
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:16,875
Oh, Uo...
Hana...

417
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:19,416
[Uo] We'll come by for
another visit soon.

418
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,458
Yes, let's...

419
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:21,750
I'm curious to
learn more about

420
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:24,208
the Soma Family's
unique signals.

421
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:26,166
Okay! Now how
'bout some breakfast?

422
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,250
Yes, breakfast.

423
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:29,166
Hey, hey hey! You
gotta be kidding!

424
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,666
Damn girls
are takin' over!

425
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,833
I- I know it must seem that
way! But, they mean well...

426
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,166
You'll see!

427
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,791
Uo and Hana are both really,
really good people!

428
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:38,166
So, please...

429
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,500
Fine.
Whatever.

430
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:48,291
Afterall, they are
your friends, right?

431
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:53,083
Right!

432
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:06,916
<i>Now let's all gather,</i>

433
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,458
<i>Enjoying the company we share,</i>

434
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:17,791
<i>Our tears will dissolve</i>
<i>into thin air,</i>

435
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:23,750
<i>As we drink up</i>
<i>this wonderful life.</i>

436
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:28,708
<i>La, la, la...</i>

437
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:34,791
<i>Takin' in all the</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

438
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:39,875
<i>La, la, la...</i>

439
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:45,916
<i>Drinkin' up all this</i>
<i>good love and life.</i>

440
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,958
<i>La, la, la...</i>

441
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:56,750
<i>Take it in all this</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

442
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:28,416
[Kyo] I say we make it
a rice ball battle!

443
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,041
[Yuki] Hmm... what if we did
something like a hit n' miss?

444
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:34,125
[Tohru] The Cultural
Festival is about to begin.

445
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:37,375
You're both looking well...
Yuki... Kyo

446
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:38,875
[Hana] Strange boy...

447
00:23:38,958 --> 00:23:40,875
[Uo] Yeah... Like
you're one to talk.

448
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:42,500
You're pretty strange
yourself, y'know.

449
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:44,333
[Tohru] When someone is
jealous of someone else,

450
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:45,958
it's probably
because they can see

451
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:48,000
the pickled plum in the
middle of their back.

452
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:51,875
[Kyo] There's one stuck to your
back too... a plum I mean.
