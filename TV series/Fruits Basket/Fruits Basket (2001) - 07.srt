1
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:18,125
<i>I was so happy when you smiled,</i>

2
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:21,708
<i>Your smile breaks</i>
<i>through the clouds of grey,</i>

3
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:28,625
<i>Far from the sunny days</i>
<i>that lie in sleep.</i>

4
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:31,583
<i>Waiting with patience</i>
<i>for the Spring,</i>

5
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:35,583
<i>when the flowers will</i>
<i>bloom renewed again,</i>

6
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:42,625
<i>knowing there's more</i>
<i>beyond the pain of today.</i>

7
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:49,000
<i>Although the scars</i>
<i>of yesterday remain,</i>

8
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:56,458
<i>You can go on living as</i>
<i>much as your heart believes.</i>

9
00:00:56,541 --> 00:01:02,958
<i>You can't be born again</i>
<i>although you can change.</i>

10
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:09,666
<i>Let's stay together always.</i>

11
00:01:29,416 --> 00:01:32,541
[Tohru] The Cultural Festival
is only seven days away.

12
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:33,958
You can imagine,

13
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:36,041
things have been pretty
hectic here at school lately.

14
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:37,541
There's not
much time left!

15
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:40,000
But everyone's doing
their part to get ready.

16
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:43,583
That goes for my class,
too- 1st Year, D-Block.

17
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:46,041
We're helping out
with the refreshments.

18
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:47,291
I'm pleased
to announce

19
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:49,125
the health inspections
have been completed...

20
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:52,166
and we've been given permission
to open our rice ball stand.

21
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,375
All that's
left to decide

22
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:55,708
is what flavor rice
balls we'd like to sell.

23
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:57,541
Any suggestions you
may have on the matter

24
00:01:57,625 --> 00:01:58,916
would be more
than welcome.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,666
Rice balls... Funny how
some things keep turning up.

26
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:07,375
Well, what if we tried making
Three-Flavor Rice Balls?

27
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:08,833
We can use three
different ingredients,

28
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:11,291
and it'll be like getting
three Rice Balls in one!

29
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:12,875
It could be fun!

30
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:14,416
How nice.
A fine idea.

31
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:19,208
Ewww... I think you mean, how
disgusting.... No way!

32
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:20,833
Like if you had
salmon, and miso,

33
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:22,541
and pickled plums
all mixed together?

34
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:26,000
That'd be the sickest
thing in the world.

35
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,375
It couldn't be any
more sickening

36
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:32,208
than your crappy
attitudes... Could it?

37
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:35,708
Don't they have rules against
bringing lead pipes to school??

38
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:37,875
I say we make it a
Rice Ball Battle.

39
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:38,958
A battle?

40
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:41,666
One-on-one. One round.
No holds barred.

41
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,375
And even if they
get bloody noses,

42
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:44,875
or pull each
other's arms off,

43
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:47,041
they have to fight for
the prize - Rice Balls!

44
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,041
No way.

45
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:52,166
Hmm. What about...
a 'Hit-or-Miss'?

46
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,541
Interesting...

47
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:55,041
We'll have a
special offer.

48
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:56,708
Anyone who buys
three rice balls

49
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:58,291
can choose a
fourth for free.

50
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:00,375
Only, we'll have
some misses mixed in,

51
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:02,333
that we can make with
some strange ingredient,

52
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:03,250
or something.

53
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:04,500
[Walla] That's a
great idea! Yes!

54
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:06,041
Oh, sure!

55
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:07,541
So you're all just gonna follow
whatever dumb idea he says?!

56
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,291
[Boy 1] You can't
call us 'followers'

57
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:11,250
for knowing a good
idea when we hear it.

58
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:12,791
[Boy 2] Yeah, your
idea was too weird!

59
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:14,291
[Kyo]
How so?!

60
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:15,916
Who wants to get all bloody
over a couple of rice balls?

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,833
[Boy 1] Aww, don't
get mad Kyo-Kyo.

62
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:19,208
Hey, don't
call me Kyo-Kyo!

63
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:20,916
[Boy 2] What's wrong
with that?

64
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:27,708
I have a student
council meeting to attend,

65
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:28,958
so if you wouldn't
mind handling

66
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:30,583
the arrangements for
building the stand?

67
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:31,916
Sure, just
leave it to me!

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,208
Ah, hold on!

69
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:34,916
There was something I
still needed to ask you.

70
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,500
[Boy 2] Yeah, right, me too!
Yuki- about the stand...

71
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,916
[Girl 1] Yuki, I
have a question...

72
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,416
[Girl 2]
Aww, look!

73
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,166
[Boy 1] Whoa, how did
they get in here?

74
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,166
[Girl 1]
And so many!

75
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:48,875
[Girl 3]
How cute!

76
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,333
Kyo...
Oh no...

77
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:51,750
Damn it all!

78
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:58,666
Strange boy...

79
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:01,541
Yeah, like
you're one to talk.

80
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,333
You're pretty strange
yourself, you know...

81
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:05,541
But he does have one
hell of a violent temper.

82
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:06,708
I'll give
you that.

83
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:09,041
Yes, he's
quite rowdy.

84
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:10,833
[Uo] The complete
opposite of the prince.

85
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:12,250
Hard to believe
they're related.

86
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:18,541
I was right!

87
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:22,041
[Tohru] I had a feeling
you'd be up here.

88
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:23,375
I guess whenever I
need to find you,

89
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,541
I just have look in
the highest place!

90
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:26,750
What is it
with you?

91
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,166
You always gotta sneak
up on me like that?

92
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:32,333
Ah... Hello, Mister
Cat! Oh, you're so cute!

93
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:34,375
These cats sure do
like you, don't they?

94
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:36,625
Yeah, yeah.
Don't ask me why...

95
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:37,958
They just show up
on their own...

96
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:40,583
Same with dogs for
Shigure and rats for Yuki.

97
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,125
Oh...
that must be fun!

98
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:43,666
How the hell
is it fun?!

99
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,708
This one time I was walking
in the mountains with Kagura,

100
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:47,916
and we got surrounded by
a whole pack of boars!

101
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,125
I thought they
were gonna eat us!

102
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:51,000
It is
not funny!

103
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,708
I'm sorry!

104
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,541
Well? What
did you want?

105
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:58,083
Um, nothing really. I was
just worried... That's all.

106
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:01,000
You seemed so upset
when you left...

107
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,541
Don't you want to help with
all the festival preparations?

108
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,916
[Kyo] Eh... What do
they need me for?

109
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,541
They've got
Yuki, don't they?

110
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,625
I doubt anyone's
gonna miss me.

111
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:17,875
They're all too
busy looking to him.

112
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,833
That's the way it always is.
Ever since we were kids.

113
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,166
He's always been
the smart one,

114
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,625
and he knows how
to get stuff done,

115
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:25,541
and he's good with
people. All that.

116
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,208
And everybody around him's
always telling him

117
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:30,166
how talented he is and stuff.
He doesn't even have to try,

118
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,166
and they all look up
to him, anyway...

119
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,333
It's just like
with martial arts.

120
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,416
I've been training way
longer than he has.

121
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,000
But he's still
better than me.

122
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:39,625
[Adult woman 1]
It's true, huh?

123
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:42,166
The children of the Rat really
are special, aren't they?

124
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,833
[Adult woman 2]
Yes, they certainly are!

125
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:45,583
[Adult 1]
And compared to them...

126
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,166
the children of
the Cat are...

127
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,541
[Kyo] It
makes me sick!

128
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:51,916
I mean, what
do I gotta do

129
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,500
to be someone like
that, you know?

130
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:56,666
Why can't I be
more like... like him...

131
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,750
Kyo...

132
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:03,041
[Yuki] Kyo. He's shy when he
first meets people,

133
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:04,750
but after he gets to
know them a little,

134
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:07,208
he can open up to
them, be himself...

135
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:08,458
Because of
what he is,

136
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,750
Kyo can never be accepted
into the Zodiac...

137
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:12,250
But, isn't it better

138
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:14,875
that he can be accepted by
normal people, for who he is?

139
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:20,041
That- is exactly what
I've always wanted.

140
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:22,166
[Tohru] So, Yuki wants
to be like Kyo...

141
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,333
...and Kyo wishes he
could be more like Yuki...

142
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:26,791
So why is it,

143
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,916
that even though they both
secretly admire each other,

144
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,833
it just pushes
them farther apart?

145
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,416
Thanks!
See you next time!

146
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,041
Why is it that people
feel they have to

147
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:52,375
be like somebody else? Why do
they have to feel jealous?

148
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:55,541
If they can see the admirable
qualities in someone else,

149
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,500
why can't they see the
admirable qualities

150
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,625
in themselves?

151
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,583
[Kyo] What the
hell is this!?

152
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,875
You tryin' to turn this
place into a rice ball shop?

153
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:12,375
Oh, well good morning!
You're up early, aren't you?

154
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:14,083
No... This is when
I always get up.

155
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:16,666
Ah! Kyo! That's a-
a leek rice ball.

156
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,375
Why would you even
make this crap?!

157
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:23,208
Mm, well, we're going to try a
Hit or Miss stand, remember?

158
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:24,958
So that one's
a miss...

159
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:27,958
I can make something else,
if you have any ideas?

160
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:31,000
I dunno... Salmon
or cod's okay, I guess...

161
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:34,250
Ah, forget it! I'll just
make some myself. Geez!

162
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,500
Wow, Kyo!
That's amazing!

163
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,750
The way you make rice balls!
You're really talented!

164
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,208
Incredible!
I had no idea!

165
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:45,500
Well, when I was
out training,

166
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,875
I had to to make all my
own meals and stuff...

167
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:50,416
I just make the plain
kind, nothin' fancy.

168
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,458
Even so, I'll bet
if we found someone

169
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:54,333
who had devoted their
whole life to the art

170
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:55,916
of rice ball making
and asked them,

171
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,291
they'd still say they
admired how well you do it.

172
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:01,625
Where the hell you gonna
find someone like that?

173
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:02,958
I mean, c'mon!

174
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:04,375
That's gotta be the dumbest
thing I ever heard!

175
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,333
Art of rice ball
making... sheesh...

176
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:11,250
That still doesn't change the
fact that it's admirable...

177
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,625
Why can't he see
that, himself?

178
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,208
Maybe the reason
you don't see it,

179
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:18,916
is that it's stuck
to your back...

180
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,500
What I mean is... a person's
admirable qualities...

181
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:26,625
They're just like, say, a
pickled plum on a rice ball...

182
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,791
In other words, the
person's the rice ball,

183
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,291
and the plum's
stuck to their back!

184
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:32,708
So, all over
the world,

185
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:34,083
you could have
rice balls made with

186
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:35,583
all sorts of
wonderful ingredients,

187
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:38,708
all different flavors, and
shapes, and colors...

188
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:41,666
But since they'd be stuck in
the middle of everyone's back,

189
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:45,083
someone could have a plum
and not even know it!

190
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:48,166
They'd look at themselves
and think, I'm so plain.

191
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,708
Nothing but white rice,
even though it isn't true.

192
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:54,333
Because turn them around and
sure enough - there it is!

193
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:56,041
There's the
plum!

194
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:02,083
So if someone is jealous of
somebody else, well then....

195
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,166
it's probably because it's
easier to see the plum

196
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,791
on someone else's back
than it is on your own!

197
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:13,541
[Tohru] Yep, I can see it. I
can see it very clearly, Kyo.

198
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:17,041
You don't know it, but you have
a great, big plum on your back.

199
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:20,250
Yuki's admirable in his way...
And you're admirable in yours!

200
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:23,875
Okay, now that's definitely the
dumbest thing I ever heard!

201
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:26,500
And what's so great about
a stinkin' plum, anyway?!

202
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:29,583
Oh, I'm sorry... We can change
it to salmon if you want...

203
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,666
Oh... Excuse me, I guess I
left the kettle on the stove.

204
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,458
Hey.

205
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:43,208
You've got one too... I
mean, stuck to your back...

206
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,583
...there's a plum.

207
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:52,875
I- I can
see it.

208
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:54,375
You can
see it?

209
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:57,000
Yeah, but it's really
small, like a baby plum.

210
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:03,625
[Tohru] Baby plums
are delicious!

211
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,875
[Kyo] No, it's
way, way, tiny!

212
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:08,666
[Tohru] You know, I suppose
right now there could be people

213
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,875
who are
feeling jealous,

214
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,666
but who don't
realize the qualities

215
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,416
they envy in other people
are the very same ones

216
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,416
they already have...

217
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,750
When you think
about it that way,

218
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:20,208
it sort of makes you
want to try harder-

219
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:24,625
just a little bit harder-
at being yourself.

220
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:29,375
And so, here we are! The
day of the Cultural Festival.

221
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:32,041
Hey, what are you doing?
It's still crooked.

222
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,541
No one's gonna notice
something so small, cat-lover.

223
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:35,958
Yeah, you're just
being finicky.

224
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:38,125
That's right, cat-lover. It's
only gotta last one day.

225
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,708
What's the deal with all
this cat-lover crap?!

226
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,583
You trying to make
fun of me or something?

227
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,416
Ah, we got you figured
out. You talk tough,

228
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,541
but deep down you're just a
gentle guy who loves animals.

229
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:48,750
Awww...

230
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,333
Hey! Knock it
off, will ya!

231
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:51,250
For the last time, those
weren't even my cats!

232
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:52,666
Hm. I guess it's
a good thing

233
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,250
they don't really have
him figured out...

234
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:56,250
Why is it every time
Orange-top's around

235
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:57,500
I get a
headache?

236
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,708
Well, at least this time
he's trying to help,

237
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,833
which for him...
is pretty rare.

238
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,750
I don't know, you
have your way, Yuki...

239
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:06,166
and Kyo has his,
that's all.

240
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:09,833
[Senior girls]
Oh, Yu-ki!

241
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,708
Hello.

242
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:17,875
Guess what? We have a surprise
for you, Yuki. It's a present.

243
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,833
All the senior girls
chipped in and bought it.

244
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:21,208
We thought it would
be the greatest thing

245
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:22,625
if you could
wear it today!

246
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,625
Uh... Wear...?

247
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:27,458
[Both] Ta-da! A one-of-a-kind
festival day costume,

248
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:28,916
just for
you, Yuki!

249
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,333
[Senior girls] Hi!

250
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:44,875
Rice balls!
Rice balls!

251
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,125
Buy three,
get one free!

252
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,375
We have salmon,
and kelp, and plum...

253
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:48,208
Yeah,
I'll take one!

254
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,958
Thank you!
...heh, heh

255
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:51,958
Wow! They're
selling like crazy!

256
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:54,208
We're on track for first
in the food category!

257
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:55,875
I think we have all
the delicious stuff

258
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,291
Tohru made to
thank for that!

259
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:59,333
Oh, no,
don't be silly!

260
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,458
And I just love these
cat shaped ones...

261
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:03,125
Thanks, but I don't think
they're really what's

262
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,416
attracting everyone to
our booth, you know?

263
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:11,583
That's it! Stop!
No more pictures!

264
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:13,583
Yuki doesn't like it! Yeah,
that goes for you too, sister!

265
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,708
Good point. He is
definitely an attraction.

266
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:19,000
I suppose we couldn't ask
for better advertising, huh?

267
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,333
Oh... I hope I
haven't done anything

268
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:26,708
to make Yuki mad at
me. He looks upset.

269
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:27,458
Ah, don't
worry about it.

270
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:30,500
My guess is, it's
more embarrassment

271
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,666
than he
can stand,

272
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,000
having to dress up
like that... I mean...

273
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:35,166
...he's already got
a big enough complex

274
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,708
over that girly
face of his.

275
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:38,875
Yuki!

276
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:42,291
Yuki, you look
like a girl!

277
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:46,791
What the hell? What is
that little brat doin' here?

278
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:49,500
Oh... That's someone
you know, then?

279
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:52,958
Momiji. You're not to go
running off by yourself.

280
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:56,208
Yuki. Kyo. I see
you're both looking well.

281
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:57,458
Hatori!

282
00:12:57,541 --> 00:13:01,958
Aaiyee!! You're
a friend of Yuki's?

283
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:04,166
Hi there, I'm
Momiji Sohma...

284
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,166
This guy here with me
is Hatori Sohma...

285
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:10,083
And yeah, we're two of
Yuki and Kyo's relatives!

286
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,208
Oh, is
that right?

287
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,041
That's right.
But nevermind Momiji.

288
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,708
What's that bastard
Hatori doing here?

289
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:17,000
So, if
they're related,

290
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:20,625
I wonder if they're
part of the zodiac too?

291
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,708
All right... now
take a deep breath.

292
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:24,458
Hatori's a
doctor.

293
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:25,875
So why
is he here?

294
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:28,625
Couldn't we have found
a better time for this?

295
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,375
[Hatori] We did. We
had an appointment.

296
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,666
You should know you can't
skip your monthly check-up.

297
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,375
Check-up? Yuki, why
would you need a check-up?

298
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:36,583
Is there
something wrong?

299
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,083
Uh, Sort of...

300
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:40,416
Yuki's bronchial tubes
are fairly sensitive...

301
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,208
He used to suffer from
frequent asthma attacks

302
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:43,583
when he was
a child...

303
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:47,041
It's a condition he's
gradually growing out of...

304
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:50,333
But we like to be sure... I'm
assuming you're Tohru Honda?

305
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:52,125
Uh... yes!
Nice to meet you.

306
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:55,500
Indeed... I didn't expect
you'd be such an ordinary girl.

307
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,375
What?

308
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:57,583
Hatori!

309
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:00,250
[Girl] Don't! You can't
climb on the stand!

310
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:01,958
What do you think you're
doing you little runt?!

311
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:06,583
Uh... Excuse me, I
think they need my help.

312
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:08,125
Why did you
have to come here?

313
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:11,500
You can save your complaints
for Akito... It was his idea.

314
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,583
Of course, he originally
planned to come himself.

315
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,666
He was running another
one of his fevers, so...

316
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,541
I made him stay home,
doctor's orders...

317
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,333
As a result, he sent
me here in his place...

318
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:25,375
And since I was already looking
after Momiji for the day,

319
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:27,666
he naturally had
to come with me.

320
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,208
[Yuki] Is this what you
call looking after him?

321
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:31,750
Just be grateful
we came late,

322
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,666
when there are
fewer people here.

323
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,541
I know why you're
tense... Don't be.

324
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,208
I didn't come for this
Tohru Honda today...

325
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,041
Whether or not I
do in the future

326
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,583
is still for
Akito to decide.

327
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,916
Now you stay here!
And sit still!

328
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,541
Waaa! Somebody!
Kyo hit me!

329
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:49,625
Is everything okay?

330
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,541
Ah-h!
You're Tohru!

331
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:54,083
Right? Tohru Honda!
Did I get it right?

332
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,208
Uh-huh.
That's me.

333
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:56,458
Now me!
Guess who I am!

334
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:57,708
You're
Momiji.

335
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,541
Ah! You already remember
my name! I'm so happy!

336
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,083
Tohru, let's be
friends, okay?

337
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:02,833
Sure!

338
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:04,875
Hey, Tohru...

339
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,166
so you already know about
the whole zodiac thing right?

340
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,416
Uh... right.

341
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,041
That's great... I
can hug you! Haha!

342
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:12,458
Hold it,
lover boy!

343
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:14,208
But Tohru doesn't
mind if I transform

344
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:15,791
in front of her!
Do you, Tohru?

345
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,708
Do you even know
where you are??

346
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,875
So, I guess he is a member
of the zodiac after all.

347
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:23,250
Kyo! You're just trying to
keep Tohru all to yourself

348
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,250
because she's so cute! You
probably hug her everyday!

349
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,375
What? Hell no!
Who would wanna do that?

350
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:27,833
Me!

351
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,750
[Student] Was that
an explosion?

352
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,750
What's
the matter?

353
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,958
[Student] Hey, what's
with the rabbit?

354
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,333
[Student 2]
Where'd Momiji go?

355
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,791
Hold on, aren't these
Momiji's clothes? They are!

356
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:39,500
No way!

357
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,625
That's weird! He's not running
around here naked, is he?

358
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,875
And what's with the rabbit?!
Where did it come from?

359
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,916
[Student] No kidding,
this is weird!

360
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,708
Could it be any
weirder than me?

361
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:51,166
It's freakish,
a boy in a dress...

362
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,583
Don't even say that!
You're the greatest!

363
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:55,125
[Male student] Aw man,
if you were a real girl,

364
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:58,333
I'd be all over you! I
mean... you know...

365
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,625
Thank you so
much, Yuki.

366
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,125
Embarrassing
yourself like that

367
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:06,291
just to divert
everyone's attention...

368
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:09,041
[Kyo] You little brat! Do you
know what you almost did?!

369
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,708
[Hatori] You are going to
be grounded for one week.

370
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:14,125
[Momiji] What'd I do??
Tohru, they're scaring me!

371
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,125
Leave her alone!
It's your own damn fault!

372
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,791
I'm very
disappointed in you.

373
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:20,375
We're only lucky Yuki was
able to distract everyone.

374
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:22,291
Yeah. He just had to bat
those pretty eyelashes

375
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,625
a couple times-

376
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,875
Next time, I'll send
you flying off the roof!

377
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,166
Damn rat...

378
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,333
Momiji, you really do
have to be more careful.

379
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,916
Indeed. You'd do well
to heed that advice...

380
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,666
Now, I think it's
time we went home.

381
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,791
Aw, come on! I wanted to
talk to Tohru some more.

382
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:41,750
Yes, it would be a shame if
you couldn't stay a bit longer.

383
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,166
Take a moment, then...

384
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,958
I'll give you that long
to say your goodbyes.

385
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,375
Ha'ri,
you're so dull.

386
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,125
You heard him!
Go home!

387
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,791
Oh yes. I almost forgot
something very important...

388
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:54,291
Yuki, Kyo. Stand
over there, please.

389
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:55,833
What?

390
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,500
I want you both to give me a
simple answer to this question.

391
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:01,708
[Hatori] What is the last
letter of the alphabet?

392
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:04,458
Z?

393
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:06,625
Akito wanted me to
take a picture of you

394
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,750
while I was here.

395
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:11,250
That should be a very
nice shot... So long, then.

396
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:12,708
[Momiji]
Bye-bye!

397
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:15,666
Ha-tori!!! Grr!
Come back here!

398
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:20,125
I guess I didn't
get to find out

399
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:23,375
whether or not Hatori was
a member of the zodiac...

400
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:24,708
[Yuki] This
is terrible...

401
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,875
I can only imagine
what Akito will do

402
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,583
if he sees a picture
of me like this...

403
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:35,000
No, Yuki! Don't! It's cold
out here! And your asthma!

404
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:37,125
Anything would be better than
wearing this stupid outfit...

405
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:39,750
But... just think of all the
compliments you were getting.

406
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:42,333
It is not a compliment for
a man to be called cute.

407
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:46,791
I'm sorry... I guess
I was going to say

408
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:49,125
I thought you
were cute, too...

409
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:53,583
Miss Honda... I'm sorry you
had to see me like this...

410
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:59,458
I must seem pretty foolish to
you... And I was, I guess...

411
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:03,791
I suppose I should have just
told those senior girls 'no'.

412
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,333
Um, you know I don't think
it's as bad as you think.

413
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:08,958
I know I always liked it when
my mom told me I was cute.

414
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:12,375
It one of the ways she
told me she loved me.

415
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,625
[Tohru's mom]
Tohru, you are so cu~te!

416
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:21,041
[Tohru] It always
made me so happy...

417
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:24,583
It was just another way my mom
showed her affection and...

418
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:26,291
and you know,
thinking about it,

419
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:29,458
I really miss hearing
her say it, too...

420
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:34,333
And so, it just means that
everybody likes you, and,

421
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:38,500
um... I guess I'm not
being very helpful, am I.

422
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:40,208
Well...
I don't know...

423
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,208
Hearing you, when you
put it like that,

424
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:44,166
it does make me
feel a bit better...

425
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,833
I suppose I can wear this
thing a while longer,

426
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:53,041
as a favor to the
seniors... But... uh...

427
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:54,166
...before I
put it on,

428
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,916
do you think you
can give me a hand?

429
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,541
One of the buttons is
snagged in my hair.

430
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:58,875
Oh, sure.

431
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:01,291
I can see how a dress like
this might be a pain,

432
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:04,041
putting it on or
taking it off...

433
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:05,166
[Yuki] But if
you tried it on,

434
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,833
I'll bet it would
look good on you...

435
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:10,500
Well thanks... but I
don't know about that.

436
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:14,000
I guess I've never been one
to wear this sort of thing.

437
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:14,791
You'd be cute.

438
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:22,416
In fact, I'm sure of it...
You'd be very cute, Miss Honda.

439
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,333
[Yuki] Did you get
the camera back?

440
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:38,791
[Kyo]Don't
even start!

441
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,916
It wasn't
any use.

442
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,208
Listen.
Miss Honda?

443
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:43,541
Oh! Yes?

444
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:46,250
It's about Hatori...
If you ever see him again,

445
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,458
I think
it's best

446
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,166
that you avoid being
anywhere alone with him.

447
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,291
Oh?
Why is that?

448
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:52,833
It's just...

449
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:56,416
It's not that Hatori himself
is a bad person or anything...

450
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,791
But still... I told you,
how when I was young

451
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,583
I transformed in front of
all those other children...

452
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:03,500
All of their memories
had to be erased,

453
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,750
and the person
responsible for that-

454
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:08,083
that person
was Hatori.

455
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,666
That's the reason
why I'm concerned...

456
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,958
I thought I should warn
you about it now...

457
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:23,458
Tohru Honda of Class 1-D...
Tohru Honda of Class 1-D,

458
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,333
please come to the first floor
conference lounge. Repeating...

459
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:27,041
Is that... me?

460
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,833
What for,
I wonder.

461
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:32,041
Anyway, I guess
I'll be right back.

462
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:33,291
Excuse me...

463
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,833
I apologize for having
to page you like that.

464
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,375
But what with...
Kyo... and Yuki around,

465
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:40,750
it didn't
seem you and I

466
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,750
would have a chance
to speak properly.

467
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:45,416
He just finished warning
me, and here we are, alone!

468
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,666
Right to the
point, then.

469
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,500
This is the address for
the main Sohma estate.

470
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,625
I want you to come by
on your next day off.

471
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,708
I believe you and I have
several very important matters

472
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:57,958
to discuss... And it
goes without saying...

473
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,375
You are not allowed to
speak of our meeting

474
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,750
to Yuki and
the others.

475
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:03,041
Nor are you allowed to
refuse my request...

476
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:06,041
Am I being clear?

477
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:08,500
What should I do?
If I say no,

478
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:11,458
does that mean my memory gets
erased? But what if I do go?

479
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:14,333
It could be he really
only needs to talk to me.

480
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:16,375
And I guess Mom did
always say I should try

481
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,500
to give people the
benefit of the doubt.

482
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:20,166
I understand.

483
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,166
Don't worry! I'll be right
there to keep an eye on you!

484
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,791
And I'll keep the
other one on Ha'ri...

485
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,041
So you
should come over!

486
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:28,166
I didn't know
you were here...

487
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,416
Momiji...

488
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,875
Hey, if I was her,

489
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:33,250
I'd be scared to be alone
with a creepy guy like you.

490
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:36,291
So, you're gonna
come, right Tohru?

491
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:39,208
Well... I guess if
Momiji is there with me,

492
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:43,625
I won't be
quite so nervous...

493
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:45,416
Still, it seems so odd
that he would want me

494
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,375
to come to the Sohma estate
by myself like this...

495
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:50,750
And even more odd that I'm
not allowed to say anything

496
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:53,083
to Yuki or Kyo,
or Shigure...

497
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:59,708
I wonder, exactly what's
going to be waiting for me

498
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:01,666
when I
get there?

499
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:06,916
<i>Now let's all gather,</i>

500
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,500
<i>Enjoying the company we share,</i>

501
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:17,791
<i>Our tears will dissolve</i>
<i>into thin air,</i>

502
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:23,750
<i>As we drink up</i>
<i>this wonderful life.</i>

503
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:28,708
<i>La, la, la...</i>

504
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:34,791
<i>Takin' in all the</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

505
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:39,875
<i>La, la, la...</i>

506
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:45,916
<i>Drinkin' up all this</i>
<i>good love and life.</i>

507
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
<i>La, la, la...</i>

508
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:56,791
<i>Take it in all this</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

509
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:27,375
[Kana] When the snow
melts, what does it become?

510
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:29,541
[Hatori] The answer
is water, of course.

511
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:33,333
[Kana] Bzz-bzz! Nope!
It becomes Spring!

512
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:35,875
[Hatori] ...She was that
fresh, vibrant Spring,

513
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:38,041
full of life
and light.

514
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,916
[Kana] I'm so sorry...

515
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,708
I wasn't able to protect
you... Forgive me...

516
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:46,166
[Hatori] I was the one who
should have apologized.

517
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:49,208
I was the one who
couldn't protect her...

518
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:50,958
[Tohru] No matter how
much snow there is,

519
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:54,208
it's all going to melt.
It always does...
