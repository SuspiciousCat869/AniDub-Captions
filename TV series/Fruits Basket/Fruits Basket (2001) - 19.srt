1
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:18,125
<i>I was so happy when you smiled,</i>

2
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:21,708
<i>Your smile breaks</i>
<i>through the clouds of grey,</i>

3
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:28,625
<i>Far from the sunny days</i>
<i>that lie in sleep.</i>

4
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:31,583
<i>Waiting with patience</i>
<i>for the Spring,</i>

5
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:35,583
<i>when the flowers will</i>
<i>bloom renewed again,</i>

6
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:42,625
<i>knowing there's more</i>
<i>beyond the pain of today.</i>

7
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:49,000
<i>Although the scars</i>
<i>of yesterday remain,</i>

8
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:56,458
<i>You can go on living as</i>
<i>much as your heart believes.</i>

9
00:00:56,541 --> 00:01:02,958
<i>You can't be born again</i>
<i>although you can change.</i>

10
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:09,666
<i>Let's stay together always.</i>

11
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,500
Hi! I'm
Tohru Honda...

12
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:38,541
Last May, I lost my mom
in a traffic accident.

13
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:40,375
I didn't want to be
a burden on anyone,

14
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:44,666
so I began secretly
living... in a tent.

15
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:48,208
But the way it worked out, one
of my classmates, Yuki Sohma,

16
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:49,500
discovered where
I was living,

17
00:01:49,583 --> 00:01:53,333
and invited me to
stay at his house!

18
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:58,875
That's when I first learned
that Yuki, Kyo, Shigure,

19
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:01,958
and the rest of the Sohmas
had a secret of their own.

20
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:04,458
Whenever they hug a
member of the opposite sex,

21
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:07,000
or if their bodies are
under a great deal of stress,

22
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:09,375
they transform into the
animals of the Chinese Zodiac!

23
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:13,041
Naturally, they don't want
anyone to know about this,

24
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:14,250
so I made
a promise

25
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:17,541
that I would always
keep their secret safe.

26
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:22,375
I used to wonder
what it was

27
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:23,750
that gave me the
strength to make it

28
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:26,708
through some of
the tough times.

29
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:29,125
But, I think I know
the answer now.

30
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:34,833
I found out right after
I finished my midterms,

31
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:37,666
and um, things
didn't go so well.

32
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,875
Listen up!

33
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,541
For those of you who
received failing grades

34
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:41,791
on any of
your midterms,

35
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:43,583
there will be
retests on Sunday!

36
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:48,375
Don't
"bleah" me!

37
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:50,541
You should be grateful
your teachers

38
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:51,916
are taking time out
of their weekends

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,333
to give you a
second chance.

40
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:57,166
Yeah, really.
Quit complainin'.

41
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,291
It's your own damn fault if
you gotta come in for a retest.

42
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:03,250
But that's what they get for
not studyin', right Tohru?

43
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:09,708
You got a
failing grade?

44
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,875
How
many?

45
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:15,083
Aww, only one? Don't let
it get'cha down too much.

46
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:16,916
It's not
so bad.

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,708
Yes, she's
right, Tohru.

48
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,875
In fact, compared to
me, it's very good.

49
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:23,375
I failed all
of my tests.

50
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:25,041
You say that like
you're proud of it.

51
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:26,666
You should be the
one who's upset.

52
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,291
Anyway, what
happened?

53
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,375
You passed all your
tests last time.

54
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:31,875
Did the Prince not
help you study?

55
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:36,208
No, he... He
tried to help me.

56
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,875
Miss
Honda?

57
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:43,625
What's the matter?
Is it retests?

58
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:50,250
I am
so sorry.

59
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,666
Uh no, really, you
don't have to--

60
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,458
You went to so much
trouble to help me

61
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,916
and I still failed
one of my tests!

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,416
I feel so bad for making
you waste your time.

63
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,416
I can't believe
I'm so stupid.

64
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,333
Hey,
c'mon.

65
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:08,625
You're not stupid. You
just made a mistake.

66
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,041
We all
make them.

67
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,750
No one expects
you to be perfect.

68
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,708
Besides, you have a
second chance, right?

69
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:16,833
And the questions
on retests

70
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:19,208
are usually easier
than the real thing.

71
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:21,958
That's true. They'll
be much easier.

72
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:25,041
I'm not sure you should be
the one giving out advice.

73
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:28,041
Hey Yuki. So are
you coming, or what?

74
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,458
I'll be
right there.

75
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,333
There's a Student
Council meeting today,

76
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:35,666
but if you need me
to walk you home.

77
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,875
No, I'll be
all right.

78
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:39,625
I'm such
an idiot.

79
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,166
So, you gotta take
a retest, huh?

80
00:04:57,625 --> 00:05:01,583
I was just askin'.
It's not that big a deal.

81
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:05,541
Oh, I can't believe
I let this happen.

82
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:06,833
I'm so upset
right now.

83
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:09,041
I can't even tell where
my feet are going.

84
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:13,375
It really is pathetic.
I'm so stupid.

85
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:17,541
And my promise to Mom- I
really let her down this time.

86
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:18,791
I'll never graduate
from high school

87
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,750
if I fail my
tests like this.

88
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:25,333
Ahh-hh. Oh, I'm
starting to get dizzy.

89
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:28,291
Why? Why did I let
things get this bad?

90
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:35,583
Ahhh, why can't I be... why
can't I be more responsible?

91
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,083
Uh, hey. What do you
think you're doing?

92
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:42,708
C'mon! It's
just a retest!

93
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,333
You don't have to
be so depressed!

94
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:48,375
Try not to stress
out so much.

95
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:51,916
You're just gonna end up
giving yourself a fever again.

96
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,541
Uh, hey!

97
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,833
Aw, hell! You really
do have a fever!

98
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,083
No, I'm
okay.

99
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:05,416
You are not okay!
What are we gonna do?!

100
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,250
We gotta get you
back to the house!

101
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:10,791
All right, don't panic!
Don't panic! Aaahh!

102
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:15,375
Hmmm. Yes, it's a
fever all right.

103
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,541
And in my professional
medical opinion,

104
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,375
you're sick!

105
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:24,583
No, kiddin'. I coulda'
told you that.

106
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,875
Now go upstairs
and go to bed.

107
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:28,916
No, it's not
that bad.

108
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,125
Really,
it's not.

109
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:32,875
If I just take some
medicine, I'll be fine.

110
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:35,500
Now if you'll excuse me, I
have to go make some dinner.

111
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,375
You need to get
some sleep!

112
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:40,000
You're always so worried when
someone else has a cold,

113
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:42,125
why don't you try worryin'
about yourself for once?

114
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:43,750
But, there's
so much to do.

115
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:46,166
After dinner, I still
have to go to work.

116
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,375
You're taking
the night off!

117
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:50,125
No, I couldn't do
that, I mean--

118
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,083
Tohru,
Tohru, Tohru.

119
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:55,500
Kyo's right. You shouldn't
go into work this evening.

120
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,125
It's important that
you get your rest.

121
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,875
Uh, but I--

122
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:02,416
♪ You're not
listening. ♪

123
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,083
Please, for us, will
you go get some sleep?

124
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:08,541
Okay.

125
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:11,875
That's what I
like to hear.

126
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,500
Oh, what next?

127
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:21,083
Of all the times
for me to get sick,

128
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:23,625
it just had
to be now,

129
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:28,208
as if I didn't feel
pathetic enough already.

130
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:31,708
What?! Tohru's sick?! That's
terrible! Is she all right?

131
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:34,375
Did she take some medicine? Is
she resting? Is she all right?

132
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,875
You know, Momiji,
you're very loud.

133
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:37,958
But in answer to
your question,

134
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,208
yes, she's resting
safe and sound.

135
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:41,458
Of course,
that means

136
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:43,416
she won't be able to go
into work this evening.

137
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,500
Oh! Right! Don't worry
about a thing! I'm on it!

138
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:52,541
Hey, Tohru's
sick today,

139
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:56,125
so she had to stay
home and get her rest!

140
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:59,375
But everything's okay, 'cause
I'm here to take her place!

141
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:01,000
I can clean
really good, too!

142
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,958
So for today, just
pretend I'm Tohru!

143
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:05,041
Well, I don't know where
this boy came from,

144
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:07,666
but he really is
adorable, isn't he?

145
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,291
Yes, he might be the cutest
little boy I've ever seen.

146
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,041
Hmm,
let's see.

147
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:17,500
"What should you do
when you have a cold?"

148
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,458
"If you have a
cold, or a fever,

149
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:23,083
the best thing to do is
eat plenty of leeks."

150
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:24,208
"A good serving
of leeks

151
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:27,083
will help you feel
better in no time."

152
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:30,458
"To cure a cold,
eat some leeks."

153
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:33,333
"Stewed leeks, or leek
soup are the best."

154
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:35,000
This says leek!
That says leek!

155
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:36,958
Everywhere I look
it says leek!!

156
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:39,208
I mean, what?! Can't they
think of somethin' better

157
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:42,041
to do for a cold than eat
a damn, stinkin' leek?!

158
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:43,750
How's that supposed
to cure anything?!

159
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:46,291
It's the nastiest
food in the world!!

160
00:08:57,333 --> 00:09:00,041
Look, Kyo. Isn't
it a beautiful day?

161
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,250
Oh, Mii, I've come down
with a terrible cold.

162
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:59,375
And since I'm not
feeling well,

163
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,875
I was wondering if we could
move our deadline to next week.

164
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:05,916
Eh? Next week? No, I'm sorry,
but we can't wait that long.

165
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,083
Oh, what? Could you repeat
that? I'm getting dizzy.

166
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,916
Everything's going black.
I think I'm dying!

167
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,250
What? Are you all right
Shigure? Shigure? Speak to me!

168
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:18,791
I'm dead.

169
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,333
Shigure!

170
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,375
Hm?

171
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:31,541
Hold on. What's
this? Kyo?

172
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,375
What in the world
are you doing?

173
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:36,250
What does it look like?
I'm making leek soup.

174
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:39,708
Leek soup? Um, is
that for Tohru?

175
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:42,250
You really think I'd cook
this crap for myself?

176
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,416
Yeah, it's
for Torhu!

177
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,416
What's that look for?! You
got somethin' you wanna say?!

178
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,416
Um, no
not really,

179
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,916
just wondering what you're
making us for dinner!

180
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,208
Nothing!
We'll order out!

181
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,583
Hey, I need you
to do somethin'.

182
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,416
And what might
that be?

183
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,250
Take this stuff upstairs
to Tohru for me.

184
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,000
Uh-uh.

185
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:15,500
Fine!! I'll do
it myself then!

186
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:21,000
Kyo, try not to smash all
the doors on your way!

187
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:24,250
You're going to
have to fix that!

188
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:30,333
Now, that really
is cute, isn't it?

189
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:42,166
(knocking)

190
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,583
Yes?

191
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,083
Kyo!

192
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:55,833
Kyo, did you really
make all of this for me?

193
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:58,208
It's wonderful.
Thank you so much!

194
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:01,083
Yeah, yeah. Just
eat it already.

195
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,083
Okay, if
you insist.

196
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,166
It's delicious!

197
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,500
Hmph.

198
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:16,166
Just leave the tray in
the hall when you're done.

199
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,833
Kyo, wait!
I'm, uh--

200
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:24,041
Well, I'm really sorry
to be so much trouble.

201
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:27,041
If that's the way you feel,
you shouldn't get sick, huh?

202
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,625
I guess not.

203
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,208
Why are
you crying?

204
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,708
I'm so
sorry.

205
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:48,708
What is it? Go ahead. You
can tell me. I'll listen.

206
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:56,166
Well, I made a promise to
Mom and I let her down.

207
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,375
I mean, I failed a
test, and now I'm sick.

208
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:02,708
I let everyone
down. Yuki,

209
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:05,708
I wasted all that time
he spent helping me.

210
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:08,916
I feel like... I feel
like such an idiot.

211
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,375
I have to be more
responsible than this.

212
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,791
So are you
finished?

213
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,375
Yes, I'm
finished.

214
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,375
First of all, if you
do good on the retest,

215
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:23,791
who cares if you
failed the first one?

216
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:27,000
And second, don't worry
about that damn rat Yuki.

217
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:28,458
If you
asked me,

218
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,875
I'd tell you to waste all of
his time, until he's dead!

219
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:37,375
And uh, if you're sorry,
then just get better quick.

220
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:38,708
Go back
to smiling

221
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:40,708
with that... goofy lookin'
grin you always have.

222
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:43,416
You think my
smile is goofy?

223
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,791
I--That's not
what I mean.

224
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:02,250
Just get better or
I won't be happy.

225
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:09,291
And, hey... even if it
takes you a little while...

226
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:13,041
I can... cook
and stuff...

227
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:16,958
For a while... So don't
worry about it, okay?

228
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,791
Is Kyo?

229
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,958
But you're never gonna get
better if you don't eat!

230
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,750
So hurry up before
it gets cold!

231
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,250
Uh...
right.

232
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:29,875
It really is
delicious...

233
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:33,333
No it's not...
It's pretty awful...

234
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:36,583
My cooking really sucks
compared to yours...

235
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:41,916
I think he is. Kyo's actually
trying to cheer me up...

236
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,916
I'm so
happy.

237
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,625
So maybe you're
more responsible

238
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:56,083
than you
think, huh?

239
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:01,708
I feel better
already!

240
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:14,458
Welcome home! It's a
bit late, isn't it?

241
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,708
Is something wrong?

242
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:20,291
It's horrible!
They're all gone!

243
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:24,875
The leeks that Miss Honda
and I planted together!

244
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,500
Someone pulled them
all from the garden!

245
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:30,666
What kind of low-life goes
around stealing leeks?!

246
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:39,125
Don't worry, I know better
than to think you did it...

247
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:46,791
You're
laughing.

248
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,708
I'm sorry... But
if you really want

249
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:52,083
to find your "leek
thief," talk to Tohru.

250
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:55,541
Of course. Tohru's been
in bed with a fever

251
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:57,500
ever since she came home
from school this afternoon...

252
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,375
So here's a
quiz for you...

253
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,000
How is it possible
for Tohru to know

254
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:03,541
what happened to
all your leeks?

255
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,000
Do you
think?

256
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,500
She's sick?

257
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:13,083
She's okay. She fell asleep
again after she ate.

258
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:15,083
Don't wake
her up.

259
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,791
So, what did
you give her?

260
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,375
Nothing.
Leek soup.

261
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:28,166
What?! You want
some of this?!

262
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:35,291
Keep it down if
you're going to fight.

263
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:38,500
We don't want to disturb
Tohru's sleep, now do we?

264
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,291
I apologize for
coming so late...

265
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,208
Ah, you're
here. Finally...

266
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:57,708
I, um, I heard that Sissy
got sick. Is she okay?

267
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,041
She's been
so worried,

268
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:01,916
I didn't have much choice
but to bring her along.

269
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,916
Hello, Kisa... Tohru will
be happy to see you.

270
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,208
How's
Tohru?!

271
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:16,000
Is she feeling any
better? Is she?!

272
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:17,541
Well, I don't
really know.

273
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:20,208
But since we're all here,
let's pay her a visit.

274
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:27,500
What? You gonna stand there
all night, you damn rat?!

275
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:30,083
Just put your arms
down, you stupid cat!

276
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:35,958
Hello, Tohru... How
are you feeling?

277
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:38,708
Oh, much better
now. Thank you.

278
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,000
Tohru!

279
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:41,291
Sissy...?

280
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:46,333
Don't even think
about getting up.

281
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:49,625
Hatori...
uh...

282
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:57,375
You know, Har'i, you could
try being a little nicer.

283
00:17:57,458 --> 00:18:01,125
That's right! After all,
Tohru is a young lady!

284
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,125
She should be
handled with care,

285
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,333
like the beautiful
flower she is!

286
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,375
And not in the
roughshod manner

287
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:08,041
you treated me
last time...

288
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,875
What? Did Har'i hurt
you or something?

289
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:12,875
Hurt me? Well,
I can tell you,

290
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,875
he used the longest
needle I had ever seen!

291
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:19,708
And, he lied to me. He told
me I wouldn't feel a thing...

292
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:23,000
But I did, painful shot
after painful shot.

293
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:25,041
That's quite
enough, Shigure...

294
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:27,000
There's no need to
scare them like that.

295
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,083
You'll be careful
with that thing, right?

296
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:32,625
You have to stop if
Tohru says it hurts.

297
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:37,750
Don't worry, I'm okay...
I can hardly even feel it.

298
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:41,000
Are you sure? Shigure
said it hurt really bad.

299
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:44,500
Yes, well, I did
that on purpose.

300
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:47,958
Oh Har'i, you're killing me!
Why would you be so cruel?

301
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:52,583
It seemed to be the only way
to shut you up at the time...

302
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,541
Oh, uh, Hatori? How
much do I owe you?

303
00:18:57,625 --> 00:19:00,166
Nothing. Just try
to get better soon...

304
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,375
I won't mention
any names,

305
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:02,833
but there a few
people in this house

306
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:06,083
who get very worried
when you're sick.

307
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:11,625
Call me if you
need anything else.

308
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:15,625
I think grandpa Hatori was
worried about you too...

309
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:18,625
Well...
maybe.

310
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:21,750
Wait, did... you
say grand-pa?!

311
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:24,791
But, Kisa is twelve
years old...

312
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,583
And Hatori is about
twenty-seven...

313
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,125
I don't understand--
how can he be "grandpa"

314
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:31,708
when they're only
fifteen years apart?

315
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:35,083
So... then... what do you
call Shigure and Ayame--

316
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:38,416
Grandpa Shigure,
and... Grandpa Ayame.

317
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:43,083
Yes, come in!

318
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:45,000
Are you feeling
any better?

319
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:48,875
Oh... yes.
Much!

320
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:51,833
Hatori said he thinks you'll
recover in no time at all.

321
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:54,625
Uh-huh... I'm sorry if
I worried you earlier...

322
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,875
Don't be.

323
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:58,708
Anyway, this
is for you.

324
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:01,625
I made you a
study guide

325
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:03,875
from the questions
on the first test.

326
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,166
This should be everything
you need to know

327
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,166
for the retest
on Sunday...

328
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,916
Look it over... And as
soon as you're better,

329
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,291
I'll go over it with
you again, if you want.

330
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:25,833
Yuki... Really, thank
you very, very much...

331
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,041
[Tohru] I know what
gives me strength...

332
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,833
Dammit! Why do they
all gotta say leeks?!

333
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:42,833
Kyo-o! You studying to
be a doctor or something?

334
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:44,583
No, I'm not!
Go away!

335
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,333
So then what
are you doing?

336
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:49,958
Oh! You're trying
to help Toh-ru!

337
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,875
Shut up! Now go
away, I mean it!

338
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:56,291
Wahh! Somebody!
Kyo's hurting me!

339
00:20:56,375 --> 00:21:01,083
I swear, every single time
you open your mouth...

340
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,208
[Tohru] And I want to
try to get better,

341
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:04,750
not just
for myself,

342
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:08,375
but for all of the people
who care about me...

343
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:09,958
So, Har'i,
if I were you,

344
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:11,583
I'd start thinking about
what I'd like to eat

345
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:14,083
once Tohru
gets better.

346
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:15,958
I'm sure she'll want to
cook you a special dinner,

347
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,666
to say
thank you.

348
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:25,208
[Tohru] It makes
me so happy...

349
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:27,250
...just knowing I have so
many wonderful friends

350
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:29,708
to support me.

351
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:32,666
That's what gives
me strength.

352
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:39,708
And Mom! Everything turned
out just fine at school!

353
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,416
I studied the
questions Yuki gave me,

354
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,208
and I passed the retest
with flying colors!

355
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:46,583
Oh! And Hana passed
her tests too!

356
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:48,833
Just as I
predicted,

357
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:51,541
the questions on the
retests were much easier...

358
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:56,541
Uh? Then you- you didn't fail
the first tests on purpose?

359
00:21:56,625 --> 00:22:01,333
Ah-ah... It's a secret...
I'll never tell.

360
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:06,916
<i>Now let's all gather,</i>

361
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,500
<i>Enjoying the company we share,</i>

362
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:17,791
<i>Our tears will dissolve</i>
<i>into thin air,</i>

363
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:23,750
<i>As we drink up</i>
<i>this wonderful life.</i>

364
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:28,708
<i>La, la, la...</i>

365
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:34,791
<i>Takin' in all the</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

366
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:39,875
<i>La, la, la...</i>

367
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:45,916
<i>Drinkin' up all this</i>
<i>good love and life.</i>

368
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
<i>La, la, la...</i>

369
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:56,791
<i>Take it in all this</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

370
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:27,208
[Yuki] I think I'd like to take
a look at this shop of yours.

371
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:29,666
To see if it's really
as great as you say.

372
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,333
[Ayame] Listen
to this Shigure,

373
00:23:31,416 --> 00:23:33,833
Just now Yuki came to me and
do you know what he said?

374
00:23:33,916 --> 00:23:35,250
He wants to
see my shop!

375
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:37,416
He practically begged
me to let him come.

376
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,583
[Shigure] Huh?

377
00:23:38,666 --> 00:23:41,416
[Yuki] I've decided...
I'm going to try.

378
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,458
Even if it's... even if
it's only a little bit...

379
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:46,541
I want to
understand him more.

380
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:50,875
And Miss Honda... I'd like
it if you came with me.

381
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:52,250
[Tohru] Sure, I'd
love to come.

382
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:54,208
If you don't think
I'd be in the way.

383
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:56,083
[Yuki] No, not at all.
