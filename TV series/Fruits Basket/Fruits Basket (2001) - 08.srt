1
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:18,125
<i>I was so happy when you smiled,</i>

2
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:21,708
<i>Your smile breaks</i>
<i>through the clouds of grey,</i>

3
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:28,625
<i>Far from the sunny days</i>
<i>that lie in sleep.</i>

4
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:31,583
<i>Waiting with patience</i>
<i>for the Spring,</i>

5
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:35,583
<i>when the flowers will</i>
<i>bloom renewed again,</i>

6
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:42,625
<i>knowing there's more</i>
<i>beyond the pain of today.</i>

7
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:49,000
<i>Although the scars</i>
<i>of yesterday remain,</i>

8
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:56,458
<i>You can go on living as</i>
<i>much as your heart believes.</i>

9
00:00:56,541 --> 00:01:02,958
<i>You can't be born again</i>
<i>although you can change.</i>

10
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:09,666
<i>Let's stay together always.</i>

11
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:29,875
[Hatori]
Since long ago,

12
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:32,166
whether by Akito or my
father before him,

13
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,500
I have been called upon
numerous occasions

14
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:36,708
to suppress the
memories of others.

15
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:38,833
I knew the suffering
it would cause Yuki

16
00:01:38,916 --> 00:01:40,958
if I erased his young
friends' memories.

17
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:44,416
But still... I did
as was required.

18
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,041
[Akito] Hatori -
you're as cold as snow.

19
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:52,375
[Hatori] And so it seems...
The words Akito spoke that day-

20
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:55,291
are more true than
even he realized.

21
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:02,583
Hey! You guys,
she's gone!

22
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:05,041
I can't find
her anywhere!

23
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,958
If you mean Tohru, she told
us last night at dinner

24
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:08,875
that she was going over
to a friend's house

25
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:10,708
for a visit
today...

26
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:13,041
Wha...? She
did? Really?

27
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:15,833
That's what he said, or
weren't you listening.

28
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:19,625
Shut up! I mean, she hardly
ever goes out and stuff!

29
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:21,166
Well... it
goes to show

30
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,625
how accustomed you've gotten to
having her around the house.

31
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:24,958
Her absence
is felt...

32
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:29,000
Alas, where has our
beautiful flower now gone?

33
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:30,041
You're babbling
again.

34
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:36,250
I- it's
so big...

35
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:38,583
I guess the Sohmas really
must be a large family...

36
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,583
I wish I could have told
Yuki and the others

37
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:41,875
that I was
coming here,

38
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:44,291
especially after what
he said about Hatori.

39
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:46,083
And then there's
this Akito person-

40
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,416
to think that I might have
to meet the head of the family

41
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,875
all by myself...

42
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:50,958
Hi!

43
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:53,875
M-M-Momiji! I
didn't see you there!

44
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:57,291
You're right on time! You can
go ahead and let yourself in.

45
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:01,666
I hope I'm
not intruding...

46
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,875
Come in!
Come in!

47
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:04,750
Welcome to the
House of Sohma!

48
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:10,083
Whoa...

49
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:12,500
It seems even bigger on the
inside, if that's possible...

50
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:14,583
It's like they've got
a whole town in here,

51
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:19,041
like it's its
own little world...

52
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:22,458
But it's so quiet. There's not
a single other person around.

53
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,291
It almost seems
like a ghost town.

54
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:27,083
And I think I'm only
making myself more nervous...

55
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,708
C'mon...
this way!

56
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,500
I'll show you the rest of
the way to Ha'ri's house.

57
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,208
What, you're not
scared are you?

58
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:37,500
Uh... no, of
course not...

59
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:38,833
I like Ha'ri
a lot!

60
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:40,958
I think you will too,
once you get to know him.

61
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:50,000
[Hatori] Please, relax.
Make yourself comfortable.

62
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:51,666
Oh...
okay...

63
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,541
So he tells me. But I
think that's going to be

64
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:57,458
a little bit easier
said than done...

65
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,750
A photograph?

66
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:02,166
I wonder why he
has that there?

67
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,916
It doesn't look like
he keeps any other

68
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,833
personal things in here.

69
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:07,333
And he seems
the type of person

70
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:11,875
who likes to keep a very
professional appearance...

71
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:14,375
When he said he had something
important to discuss with me,

72
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:16,416
maybe he meant that I'd
done something wrong!

73
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,375
I mean, if he's
concerned with appearances,

74
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,750
someone from a big, important
family like the Sohmas

75
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,583
probably doesn't want to
be associated with a girl

76
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:24,166
who used to
live in a tent...

77
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,250
Maybe I've offended him somehow
without even realizing it!

78
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,625
Tohru? You don't look like
you're feeling too good...

79
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:33,416
You want Ha'ri to look at you?
He is a doctor, you know.

80
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,541
No, I'm all right!
Everything's fine!

81
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:36,666
I am a
doctor, yes.

82
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,458
But my practice is
devoted exclusively

83
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,166
to the Sohma family,
and I should say,

84
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,041
Akito in
particular.

85
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:46,250
He suffers frequent illness
and requires much of my time...

86
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,250
Oh... I had
no idea...

87
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:51,875
So my time is valuable...
Right to the point, then.

88
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,041
Uh...
sure...

89
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,166
Even within the
Sohma family itself...

90
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,875
there are few who
know our secret

91
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,416
in regard to
the zodiac...

92
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,208
It is exceedingly rare
that a complete outsider,

93
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,916
such as yourself,
should come to learn of it.

94
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,500
Ordinarily, this would have
been corrected at once.

95
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:09,791
But thus far,

96
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:12,708
it seems Akito has made
an exception in your case.

97
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:15,916
Tell me, do you enjoy living
there, in Shigure's house?

98
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,958
Y- yes,
very much.

99
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:20,958
All the more reason
that you should leave.

100
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,291
It would be
best for you

101
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:23,875
if you had nothing further
to do with the Sohmas.

102
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:27,041
Leave Shigure's house, and
return to your own family.

103
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,083
That's only
reasonable, is it not?

104
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,750
Knowing Shigure, I doubt he
would ever say anything to you.

105
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,916
But there are many dark secrets
within the House of Sohma.

106
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,541
Life among us is
not as pleasant

107
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,708
as you seem
to believe...

108
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:41,583
An evil shadow looms
over this family...

109
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:44,708
That is the nature
of our curse.

110
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:45,833
Evil...?

111
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:52,000
Before you come to
regret having been involved

112
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:56,541
with the Sohmas-
leave them.

113
00:05:56,625 --> 00:06:00,041
Say, Ha'ri, I want to
take Tohru outside

114
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:02,583
and show her the gardens...
That's okay, right?

115
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:03,750
C'mon, Tohru,
let's go!

116
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:05,083
Uh...
But, uh...

117
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:06,500
C'mon! It'll be fun!

118
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:10,041
I'll even show you my favorite
spot! Come on, this way!

119
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,916
Life among us

120
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,250
is not as pleasant as
you seem to believe...

121
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,416
An evil shadow looms
over this family...

122
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,083
That is the
nature of our curse.

123
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:28,166
[Momiji] It's
quiet, isn't it?

124
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,208
Y- yes, it is.

125
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,875
That's 'cause everyone's
at the main house

126
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:36,041
getting ready for New Year's.
It's a really big deal for us.

127
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:38,416
It's the one time of year
where we all get together.

128
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,916
So there's
a lot to do!

129
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:43,583
Know what? From that tree-lined
road outside the gate...

130
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,000
to the main house
over there...

131
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:46,333
everyone who lives
around here,

132
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:49,583
they're all related
to the Sohma family.

133
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:52,875
All of them?
That's incredible!

134
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,208
Shigure
and Yuki?

135
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,208
They used to live here
too, a long time ago.

136
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,416
The only ones who can
live inside the gates

137
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,125
are members of
the zodiac like me,

138
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:03,791
or people who know
about the secret.

139
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,375
Did you know Ha'ri can barely
see out of his left eye?

140
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,958
Ha'ri had a
girlfriend, once. Kana.

141
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:22,375
She worked as his
assistant for a while.

142
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,708
And I remember,
she was really nice.

143
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:27,250
When she found out about Ha'ri
and the zodiac y'know,

144
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:30,875
it didn't even bother her.
She just laughed about it.

145
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:33,125
They got engaged. And they
were going to get married,

146
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:35,583
but when they told Akito...
Well, he got really,

147
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:38,875
really angry and he said that
he wasn't going to allow it.

148
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,208
I guess his temper
got out of control,

149
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,416
'cause that's when he
hurt Ha'ri's eye.

150
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:47,291
[Momiji] But Ha'ri didn't
blame him, though.

151
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,708
And Kana- she
blamed herself.

152
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:52,000
She was convinced that
Ha'ri getting hurt like that

153
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,958
was all her fault. She
couldn't forgive herself.

154
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:59,000
And it gradually started
to eat her away inside.

155
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:02,083
So... Ha'ri did the
only thing he could do.

156
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:04,708
He erased
Kana's memories.

157
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:07,583
He couldn't stand to watch her
tearing herself apart over him,

158
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,041
so he made
her forget

159
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:13,416
that the two of them had
ever been in love...

160
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:20,375
Kana left...
Ha'ri cried...

161
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:24,041
And in spite of all that... he
still never once blamed Akito.

162
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,375
[Tohru]
Why?

163
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:34,708
Well... because
that's the curse.

164
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,125
That's why I can
understand a little bit

165
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:37,791
of what Ha'ri feels...

166
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:40,666
He doesn't want anyone else
to end up like Kana did...

167
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,583
He doesn't want
you to be hurt,

168
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:43,916
the same
way she was.

169
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,125
Huh?
Tohru?

170
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,750
Are you crying?

171
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:54,416
Was it me...?
Did I make you cry?

172
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,541
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, okay?

173
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:59,000
No, that's not it...
It's just that...

174
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:03,291
I was so worried about coming
here... And the whole time...

175
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:07,750
he just wanted to help me...
he was just being kind...

176
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,916
But after what
he's been through,

177
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,750
he's the one who deserves
to be shown kindness. Not me.

178
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,041
I'll go get something
to warm us up, okay?

179
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:23,416
I'll be right back... You
can go inside if you want.

180
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:34,416
[Tohru] Huh?
It's snowing...

181
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,583
[Kana] I knew it
would snow today!

182
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,791
[Tohru] I'm
sorry, I...

183
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,375
I guess, I don't
really know anything

184
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:56,375
at all about
the Sohmas I-

185
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,375
[Hatori] And there's no
reason why you should.

186
00:09:58,458 --> 00:09:59,708
In fact, it would be
best if you forgot

187
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,833
whatever it is
Momiji told you...

188
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,750
[Tohru]
Does that mean...

189
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:06,541
you've forgotten
about her, Hatori?

190
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,833
[Hatori] It's
all in the past.

191
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,708
I'm sorry...

192
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:13,666
There's nothing
to apologize for...

193
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,916
I do still speak with
Kana from time to time...

194
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,625
But that's all.

195
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:21,458
Now I wonder if you would be
so kind as to excuse me...

196
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:24,041
I believe I've said
enough for one day.

197
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:28,541
Uh? Oh, no, please...
I'd like it if you stayed...

198
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,625
Maybe you could give me
a tour of the house-

199
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:57,416
Hatori!?

200
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,250
Ahh! Water!
No- Seawater!

201
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:03,458
Which one is it!?
What do I do?! Hatori!

202
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:14,375
Hello, in there?
I'm Kana Sohma...

203
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:15,500
It's nice
to meet you.

204
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,000
I'll be your new
assistant, as of today.

205
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,708
So whatever you need me
to do, just say the word.

206
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:22,541
Aha! This is a
little strange, huh?

207
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:24,000
I guess we're part
of the same family,

208
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,166
and I've never even
seen you before...

209
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,000
But, when I told my friends
I'd be working with you,

210
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,541
they all warned me
you'd be handsome...

211
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,875
[Hatori] This will
be your desk...

212
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,750
And these are
today's charts...

213
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,000
You'll want to start
looking them over-

214
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:40,791
Ah! It's snowing! I knew
it would snow today...

215
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:44,208
Say... here's a
question for you.

216
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:47,708
When the snow melts,
what does it become?

217
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,625
The answer is
water, of course.

218
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:54,083
Bzz-bzz! Nope!
It becomes Spring!

219
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:58,500
I think Spring is my
favorite time of year.

220
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,833
[Hatori] Oftentimes, in
memory, there is a tendency

221
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:04,416
to overly romanticize
the people we care about...

222
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,708
I know this... And
in spite of this fact,

223
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:12,541
the truth remains-
she was my Spring.

224
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,875
Yes. If,
as Akito said,

225
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:17,166
I had become the frozen
snow in the dark,

226
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,791
secretive world
of the Sohmas...

227
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:22,041
then she was the
fresh, vibrant Spring...

228
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:25,166
full of life,
and light...

229
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:30,250
[Hatori] It seems
almost inevitable now,

230
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,833
the way we were
drawn to each other...

231
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:37,500
It was the beginning
of a beautiful dream.

232
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:42,500
And then...

233
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:43,916
...she
found out.

234
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,375
W-water! No!
Seawater! I don't know!

235
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:49,000
Which one is it!?
What do I do?! Hatori!

236
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,583
I will say this,
at least-

237
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:56,416
if you threw a real sea horse
into the tub like that...

238
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,083
it would
probably die.

239
00:12:58,166 --> 00:12:59,916
I was afraid
of that.

240
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,791
I was so shaken up,
I couldn't think!

241
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:06,291
But, I guess I finally
know the reason...

242
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:10,541
I'd been wondering why it was
you never wanted to hold me...

243
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,958
It's because you were
afraid, is that it?

244
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:16,208
You were afraid of what
would happen if I found out...

245
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:18,500
That's why you keep your
distance from people...

246
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:21,000
especially the
ones you love.

247
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:24,916
But you don't have to
be afraid. Not of me.

248
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,666
Hatori.. I'm so glad
to have met you...

249
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:34,208
And I'm even happier to have
fallen in love with you...

250
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:37,000
I want to
stay with you.

251
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,916
[Hatori]
I wept.

252
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
For the first
time in my life,

253
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,750
I felt as though I had
been allowed something-

254
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:47,583
as though I had been
saved from something...

255
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,416
I could not
stop the tears-

256
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,916
they were the
frozen snow,

257
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,416
melted by the first
warm breath of Spring.

258
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,583
I lost myself
in the dream...

259
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,541
And I laughed,
as never before.

260
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,916
As though years of happiness
had been compressed

261
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,166
into each and every
new moment we shared...

262
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:10,458
[Hatori] Kana and I
wish to be married.

263
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:13,208
But all dreams
must end...

264
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:14,833
[Akito] No! I won't allow
it! I refuse to allow it!

265
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,083
[Akito] Hatori,
what's wrong?

266
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:22,583
[Akito]
Hatori...

267
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:25,916
You did this!
This is your fault!

268
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,916
If Hatori loses his
sight, it's your fault!

269
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,166
It's your fault!

270
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,583
Akito!
...Hatori!

271
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:33,833
Do you think you can lift
the Sohma curse? Do you?!

272
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,541
[Shigure] Kana! Hurry!
Take Hatori out of here!

273
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,708
Let me go! Let me go!
You can't lift the curse!

274
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:41,833
We don't need you!
You're worthless to us!

275
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:44,750
It's your fault!
It's your fault!

276
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:48,791
It's all your
faaaaaa-ult!

277
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:55,708
[Hatori] No matter what I
said, no matter what I did,

278
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:59,333
each time I tried to console
her she collapsed into tears,

279
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:03,541
until eventually, her grief
began to consume her...

280
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,166
[Akito] It's especially
at times like this

281
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,750
that your techniques become
useful. Don't you agree?

282
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:11,291
We both know her memory
should be erased.

283
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:15,375
Before now, I doubt you
would have even hesitated.

284
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:18,166
At this very moment,
it's her memories of you,

285
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,500
her feelings for you...
that cause her to suffer.

286
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,458
You're the only one
who can save her.

287
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,833
You can put an end
to her suffering...

288
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:32,833
It will be your final
act of love... Hatori.

289
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,500
[Kana] It would
have been better...

290
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:37,166
The truth is, she wants
you to release her...

291
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,541
[Kana] ...better if you
and I had never met...

292
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,833
The truth is, she
wants to forget...

293
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:46,208
...would have been better...
if you and I had never met...

294
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:47,541
[Hatori]
In the past,

295
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,875
even if I knew the pain
or sadness it might cause,

296
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:51,916
it was a burden I
was forced to bear.

297
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,375
I had no choice but to
erase a person's memory

298
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:56,208
once the order
was given...

299
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:58,458
How could I have
known that by hand,

300
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:02,166
the person dearest to me would
also have her memories erased,

301
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,833
the very memories
we shared together...

302
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:08,875
This was
my reward.

303
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:12,291
Thank you, Kana. Everything
will be all right now.

304
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,875
You won't have to be
troubled over me any longer.

305
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,333
I hope that
one day,

306
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:20,875
you will meet someone who
can truly make you happy...

307
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:25,208
It is my dearest
wish that you do...

308
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:26,375
[Kana]
Hatori...

309
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,916
I'm so sorry... I wasn't able
to protect you... Forgive me...

310
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:53,500
[Hatori] I was the one who
should have apologized...

311
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:56,541
I was the one who
couldn't protect her...

312
00:16:56,625 --> 00:17:00,416
[Kana] Hatori... I'm so
glad to have met you...

313
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,500
And I'm even happier to have
fallen in love with you...

314
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,750
[Hatori] I knew that day that I
would live the rest of my life

315
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,541
as the
frozen snow,

316
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,666
so that the dream
we had together

317
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:13,375
would never
melt away...

318
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:15,875
Sorry things
didn't work out.

319
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:17,541
But what I was able
to learn from you

320
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,916
will be my pride
as a doctor!

321
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,541
I mean as soon as
I finish school.

322
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:34,083
[Tohru]
Hatori...

323
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:37,708
Please, if there's anything
you can do to help him...

324
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:43,541
I know I'm glad to have met
the Sohmas. I don't regret it.

325
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:46,041
I can't imagine anymore
what my life would be like

326
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:47,750
without them...

327
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,791
You must have felt
that way once too, Kana.

328
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:53,208
So, if there's
anything you can do

329
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:58,375
to help Hatori
now, please...

330
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:01,708
Oh! I'm sorry! I
didn't look! No, I uh...

331
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:03,291
I didn't know
what else to do,

332
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:04,916
so I moved you up into the room
here where you could lay down.

333
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,166
And I know it's
not the best thing,

334
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,125
but all I had to cover
you up with was my coat.

335
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,166
I know it's dirty
and all, I'm...

336
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,166
I'm sorry, but like I
said it's all I had...

337
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,375
Did you
see it?

338
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:14,958
No! You see,
I uh...

339
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:17,416
I mean my
zodiac form...

340
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,083
Yes... I did, and I
thought it was really cute...

341
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,541
it was pretty amazing to
see what animal you were...

342
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:23,708
But, more
than that,

343
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:27,041
I'm really just glad
you're okay... huh?

344
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,750
Oh, here. I hope
you don't mind.

345
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:30,416
I sort of took
it without asking.

346
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,458
It's been quite some time
since I've dreamed of her...

347
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:39,166
Perhaps it's the
snow that reminds me...

348
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,666
[Kana] Say... here's
a question for you.

349
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:46,666
Tell me... when the snow
melts, what does it become?

350
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:51,125
Huh? Mmm,
Let's see...

351
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:53,791
It becomes
Spring, right?

352
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,291
So, even when
it's cold like this,

353
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:58,166
I always remember that
Spring is on its way!

354
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,708
It's sort of neat
to think about.

355
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:02,541
No matter how much snow there
is, it's all going to melt.

356
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,166
It always
does...

357
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,791
I think Spring is my
favorite time of year.

358
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:10,083
Oh! You must
be freezing...

359
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,375
Here,
take this.

360
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:12,625
Of course
Autumn's nice too.

361
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:14,750
And you couldn't have
Spring without it!

362
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,125
Say, if you'd
like I could go in

363
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:18,916
and try to find something
hot to warm us up!

364
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,666
Hm?! Something to warm us
up? Feels like, deja vu...

365
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,125
[Shigure] Ah! Lo and
behold, there they are!

366
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:26,250
[Tohru]
Uh? Shigure!

367
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,166
Well... I've been
looking for you.

368
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,708
Imagine my surprise, I found
a little lost bunny instead...

369
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:36,541
Momiji! Oh, I guess it wasn't
deja vu. You have drinks!

370
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:39,125
Sorry it
took so long.

371
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,041
Ha'ri.

372
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:43,041
So what
brings you here?

373
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:44,291
Here, Tohru!

374
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:45,625
Thank you
very much!

375
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,375
I suddenly had this
feeling that Tohru was here

376
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:48,791
in need of
a rescue...

377
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,791
Call it a writer's
intuition, if you will...

378
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,166
That's a lie.
You only came to see

379
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,583
the New Year's
preparations, didn't you?

380
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:55,958
Don't let
them fool you.

381
00:19:56,041 --> 00:20:00,666
These two have been
friends since they were kids.

382
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,666
Oh, Tohru, have you asked Ha'ri
what zodiac animal he is?

383
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,708
One more
word, Shigure,

384
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,250
and the entire
publishing industry

385
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:07,708
will know every embarrassing
thing you've done

386
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:08,750
since you
were four...

387
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,041
Understood...
My lips are sealed.

388
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:12,541
It's not like it's
that hard to figure out.

389
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:12,958
[Hatori]
Momiji!

390
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:15,750
I really don't see
how it's anything

391
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:18,375
you should be
embarrassed about...

392
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,416
It's so warm!

393
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,125
I can see how today might
have been stressful for you..

394
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,375
But now that
it's over,

395
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,666
Hatori's not that
bad of a guy, is he?

396
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:43,583
No! In fact, he was
really quite the gentleman!

397
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:59,458
[Tohru] I wonder...
could that have been...?

398
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:01,333
Let's go, Tohru...
You'd better stay with me.

399
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:04,208
It's easy to
get lost in here.

400
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:08,375
Shigure, tell me...
What is the curse, exactly?

401
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:11,083
I mean, am I doing anything
that I shouldn't be?

402
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:14,000
I wouldn't worry...
Just keep being yourself.

403
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:17,791
That's really all
you need to know.

404
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,208
[Tohru] It's been
a strange day.

405
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,791
It seems like I learned a
lot, but at the same time,

406
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:24,750
it still feels like I don't
know anything at all...

407
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,333
[Shigure]
I'm home!

408
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:28,916
[Tohru] Me too!
We're here!

409
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,625
Sorry we're
so late...

410
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:38,958
Ah I guess sitting around
the heater like that

411
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:41,291
got to be a little
bit too comfortable...

412
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:42,708
I guess so.

413
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:43,916
It might be dangerous to
try and wake them up.

414
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,791
Why don't we let them
sleep for a while...

415
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:49,416
[Tohru] At any rate...
I do know one thing...

416
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,958
I know I'm going to
try to always remember

417
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:52,583
the way I feel
right now...

418
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,958
About everyone,
about living here--

419
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:57,208
I never want those
feelings to change.

420
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:59,583
Every day that I live in
this house is dear to me.

421
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:02,083
Every single day...

422
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:06,916
<i>Now let's all gather,</i>

423
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,500
<i>Enjoying the company we share,</i>

424
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:17,791
<i>Our tears will dissolve</i>
<i>into thin air,</i>

425
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:23,750
<i>As we drink up</i>
<i>this wonderful life.</i>

426
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:28,708
<i>La, la, la...</i>

427
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:34,791
<i>Takin' in all the</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

428
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:39,875
<i>La, la, la...</i>

429
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:45,916
<i>Drinkin' up all this</i>
<i>good love and life.</i>

430
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
<i>La, la, la...</i>

431
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:56,791
<i>Take it in all this</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

432
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:26,750
[Yuki] So, Miss Honda,
what are you going to make?

433
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:27,708
[Tohru] New
Year's cakes!

434
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:29,250
[Yuki] Uh? New
Year's cakes?

435
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:30,666
[Tohru]
Uh-huh!

436
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,791
I just hope I picked out
ingredients everyone likes...

437
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:34,416
[Yuki] Shigure, Kyo, and
I will be going back

438
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,125
to the main house
tonight... I'm sorry...

439
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:38,291
[Tohru]
That's all right...

440
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,583
[Shigure] Okay, it's
almost time to go..

441
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:42,375
Don't you think you two
ought to get ready?

442
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:43,666
[Yuki &amp; Kyo]
I'm not going.

443
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,208
[Tohru] Promise,
I'll be fine...

444
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:47,083
And I'll take great care of
the house while you're gone...

445
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:49,166
You are talking to
the girl who-Aah!

446
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:51,833
The bathwater! I left
it running again!

447
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:53,458
[Shigure] If that doesn't
inspire confidence,

448
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:54,625
nothing will.
