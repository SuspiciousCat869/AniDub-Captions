1
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:18,125
<i>I was so happy when you smiled,</i>

2
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:21,708
<i>Your smile breaks</i>
<i>through the clouds of grey,</i>

3
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:28,625
<i>Far from the sunny days</i>
<i>that lie in sleep.</i>

4
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:31,583
<i>Waiting with patience</i>
<i>for the Spring,</i>

5
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:35,583
<i>when the flowers will</i>
<i>bloom renewed again,</i>

6
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:42,625
<i>knowing there's more</i>
<i>beyond the pain of today.</i>

7
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:49,000
<i>Although the scars</i>
<i>of yesterday remain,</i>

8
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:56,458
<i>You can go on living as</i>
<i>much as your heart believes.</i>

9
00:00:56,541 --> 00:01:02,958
<i>You can't be born again</i>
<i>although you can change.</i>

10
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:09,666
<i>Let's stay together always.</i>

11
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:34,041
It's really coming
down, isn't it?

12
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:37,125
And I was going to try
to do the laundry today.

13
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:39,208
It's not going
to rain all day.

14
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:40,333
The weather
report said

15
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:41,541
it should clear up
some this afternoon.

16
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:44,375
Oh, good. I have to
go to the store, too.

17
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:45,583
But I don't really
mind the rain.

18
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:47,541
It just means fall's
right around the corner!

19
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:49,750
I see. So you
like the fall?

20
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:52,958
Uh-huh! There's nothing like
a clear fall day, you know,

21
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:55,541
when the air is
so crisp and nice.

22
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:58,166
Oh, but then again, I guess
I say that about spring, too.

23
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,041
That's just
like her...

24
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:02,041
Yuki? You like the
fall too, don't you?

25
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:04,750
Sure. It's not too
hot, not too cold.

26
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,208
Nope! It's just
right! And Kyo?

27
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:09,583
What the hell
does it matter?

28
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:14,958
Oh. Uh,
well I--

29
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:17,375
It's nothing you've
done, Miss Honda.

30
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:20,458
Kyo just gets worn out
easily on days like this.

31
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:21,375
He's a little
out of it.

32
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:24,458
Eh? Ahh.
Maybe that explains

33
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:27,125
why he's seemed to be in
such a bad mood lately.

34
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:29,208
[Tohru] So did you have
a good day today, Kyo?

35
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:30,750
[Kyo] Nnnn...

36
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:34,791
It's hard to say, seeing as
how he's always in a bad mood.

37
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:37,208
Yeah, like you're
one to talk--!

38
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:40,208
You damn...
you damn rat.

39
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:41,791
Yuki wasn't
kidding.

40
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:43,500
He really does get worn
out easily, doesn't he?

41
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:45,375
Jeez, this
is annoying.

42
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,041
Are you
okay, Kyo?

43
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,125
You know, you
really shouldn't

44
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,875
push your body too
hard. Oh, I know.

45
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,958
Why don't you take a rest
from carrying your umbrella

46
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:54,375
and share
mine with me!

47
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,125
Seriously?

48
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:56,708
Uh-huh!

49
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:58,208
Are you crazy?!

50
00:02:58,291 --> 00:02:59,666
You think I'm so tired
I wanna walk around

51
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,500
lookin' like a sissy under
that girly pink umbrella?

52
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:03,666
That's a
stupid idea.

53
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,333
Uh... I'm sorry.
Well, maybe... umm...

54
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:09,000
Maybe if you
transform into a cat,

55
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:10,708
I can carry you the
rest of the way home!

56
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,208
I mean, you'll still
be sharing my umbrella,

57
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:13,166
but at least no
one will be able--!

58
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,166
That's even
worse!!

59
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,583
Miss Honda, we
should get going.

60
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:16,916
Yes, but
what about--

61
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,291
Do you always gotta be
worried about everything?

62
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:21,041
I mean, c'mon!
Give it a rest already.

63
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:23,541
Oh, right.
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:26,541
You don't gotta
apologize. Let's just go.

65
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:29,000
Okay. Well, how about
tonight I cook you something

66
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,208
to make you
feel better!

67
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:32,333
Like...
um... Leeks!

68
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:33,750
Are you trying
to kill me?!

69
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,625
Oh! I'm sorry!
I wasn't thinking!

70
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,000
Look, just
forget it.

71
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,208
I'll be fine once the
weather clears up.

72
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:41,416
O-Oh, okay.

73
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,000
[Kyo] Oh sure, now it stops,
after we're already here.

74
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,125
Well, at least the
walk home was quiet.

75
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,208
Huh? You say somethin',
you damn rat?!

76
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,208
Kyoooooo!

77
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:03,625
Hooray! You're here!
Welcome back, Kyo my love--!!

78
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:07,166
Uh K-Kyo, I don't think
that's a good idea.

79
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,208
It's not going to hold her
for long, that's for sure.

80
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:12,708
Kyo? What happened? I...
I can't open the door!

81
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:16,416
Damn! I can't either! It
must be stuck or somethin'!

82
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:19,250
Open it.

83
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,166
Allright, so why the hell
are you here, anyway?

84
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,375
Oh, no reason
at all really.

85
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,250
So why bother
comin'?!

86
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:33,125
What? Is it bad that I did?
I just wanted to see you.

87
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:34,791
Well, I didn't
wanna see you!

88
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:39,750
Kyo, why? Why
are you so mean?

89
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,333
You know how
much I love you!?

90
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:44,958
Yeah! But I got a bad feeling
you're about to show me again!

91
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,416
Shi-gu-re!

92
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,666
Kagura, I wonder
if you'd take Kyo

93
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,875
and run a little errand
for me. Make it a date.

94
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,166
Tohru, you wouldn't
happen to have

95
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,541
this evening's
grocery list?

96
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,500
Huh? Oh, sure!
Right here.

97
00:04:58,583 --> 00:04:59,750
That is, if you
don't mind.

98
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:00,833
Forget it! We are
not going on a--

99
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:03,166
All right! It's a
date! It's a date!

100
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:05,750
I guess my little
plan has succeeded.

101
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:07,958
[Yuki]
I knew it.

102
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,750
If Kagura gets to spend
some time alone with Kyo,

103
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,500
it ought to calm
her down a bit.

104
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,458
And then she won't
have to smash my house!

105
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:16,666
Oh, and by the way, try to
be extra careful from now on.

106
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,708
The main house isn't
going to foot the bill

107
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,208
for any
more repairs.

108
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:21,083
Oh, were they
helping out before?

109
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:24,458
Right. They were. But I guess
we broke one too many doors.

110
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:25,458
They've been
sort of reluctant

111
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:26,791
to give us any
assistance lately.

112
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:28,875
I had
no idea.

113
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,625
I can't believe I
never knew that before.

114
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,500
I've been living here
for a whole year now,

115
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,291
and this is the first
I've heard of it.

116
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,791
Then again, there are
probably still a lot of things

117
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,541
I don't know
about the Sohmas.

118
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:46,125
Oh! Well, I guess I can
go ahead and do the laundry.

119
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:48,000
I think there's some
more rain on the way.

120
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:49,250
Here's
an idea.

121
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:50,875
Since Kyo and
Kagura are out,

122
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:53,000
why don't you and Yuki
go on a date of your own?

123
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:56,291
A date?! Oh no, really!
I couldn't! I mean, uh--

124
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:59,208
Yes, let's. We'll
go on a date.

125
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,666
We can take a walk
to the secret base.

126
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,541
Uh... Okay.

127
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:10,166
There is still a lot I
don't know about the Sohmas.

128
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,208
But I can't give up.
I'm going to keep trying.

129
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:16,000
I want to know
everything about them.

130
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:18,041
I want to
understand them.

131
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:21,375
Even if it takes me another
year, or even longer,

132
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,125
I just have to take
it one step at a time,

133
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,875
and learn
things gradually.

134
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:27,416
And the
more I learn,

135
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,541
the more I'll be able to see
them for who they really are.

136
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:34,416
I'd like that.
That's what I want.

137
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:42,208
Akito, I
have returned.

138
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:45,583
It seems things have
gone well in my absence.

139
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:49,041
I must admit,
I was worried.

140
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,208
But he
surprised me,

141
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:55,458
the expression I saw
on his face today.

142
00:06:55,541 --> 00:07:01,541
Tell me, I've been wondering.
Don't you think it's time?

143
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:07,000
Time we revealed that
freak cat's true form?

144
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:09,750
Yes.

145
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:16,666
I agree. It may
be at that.

146
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:20,375
I wonder what she'll
do when she sees it?

147
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:23,541
I can just imagine
the look on her face.

148
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:26,958
Heh... She won't be
able to stand it.

149
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:28,500
She'll probably never
be able to set foot

150
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:31,000
in that
place again.

151
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:37,166
And when that happens, Yuki
will be very sad, won't he?

152
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,416
Poor thing.

153
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,541
Okay, let's see.

154
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:50,041
Ah! She's even got codfish
on here, Kyo's favorite.

155
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:53,708
That's so
like Tohru.

156
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:56,166
Um, Kyo.

157
00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:00,875
Tohru, she doesn't
know yet. Does she?

158
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:06,250
You know, you won't be able
to hide it from her forever.

159
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:10,250
Dammit! Shut up!! That's
got nothing to do with you!

160
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,166
I'm sorry.

161
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:17,958
But I love you more than
anything in the world!

162
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:20,041
How do you expect me to
pretend like I'm not worried!

163
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,666
Uh-oh! C'mon! We
better get moving

164
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,833
before you cause a scene.
Uh, let's go this way.

165
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:29,166
Why?

166
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,958
Why do you care so
much about me, anyway?

167
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:39,041
It's crazy!
Most people...

168
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:42,958
Most people don't wanna
have anything to do with me.

169
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:45,583
I mean, so what
is it with you?

170
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:46,916
I--

171
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:59,958
Kyo, you don't
remember, do you?

172
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,166
Remember what?

173
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:07,333
It's a secret. Besides, you
wouldn't believe me anyway.

174
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,458
♪ Well, we'd better
go get in line! ♪

175
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:10,833
Hey! What
is it?!

176
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,375
♪ Come on, Kyo! ♪

177
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:13,833
Hey!

178
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:15,541
[Kagura] Aww. It looks like
it's about to rain again.

179
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:16,875
[Kyo] You're not gonna
tell me, are you?

180
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,083
Let's walk home
holding hands!

181
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,541
There is no
way in hell.

182
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,333
Why not?! You
never minded before!

183
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:22,791
We used to
always hold hands!

184
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,708
'Cause you made me! And it
was only like 3 or 4 times!

185
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:25,708
Oh,
Kyo...

186
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,416
...you're
so mean.

187
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:33,208
All right, I'll do it!
I'll hold your damn hand!

188
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:35,666
But just for a
little while, okay?

189
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:38,916
Kagura!

190
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:43,083
'Kay!

191
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,541
Most people don't wanna
have anything to do with me.

192
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:51,833
I mean, so what
is it with you?

193
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:56,125
You really don't
remember, do you?

194
00:09:56,208 --> 00:10:03,666
Kyo... The truth is.
It's because of you.

195
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,000
That very
first time...

196
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:12,916
You held out your hand and
you asked me for mine.

197
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,500
Come on,
Kagura!

198
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:18,041
It was your
hands, Kyo.

199
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:22,625
I believed in
them. I believed.

200
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:44,625
Come on,
Kagura!

201
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:04,000
Oh... look. It's
starting to rain again.

202
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,625
I wonder where Kyo
and Kagura are.

203
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,375
I hope they make
it back okay.

204
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:11,708
Even if Kyo collapses,
Kagura can carry him home.

205
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,125
Right.

206
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:17,125
Oops,
sorry.

207
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,875
So you've
finally come back.

208
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:24,666
Um, is this
someone you know--?

209
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,666
[Kyo] Cut it
out, dammit!

210
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,916
[Kagura]
Wah-hah-hah.

211
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,875
[Kyo] I said a little
while, and I meant it!

212
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,541
You're lucky I even
went as long as I did!

213
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,208
Now enough is enough,
woman! That's it!

214
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,000
[Kagura] Aw, Kyo!
You're no fun at all!

215
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:34,708
Kyo.

216
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,500
Master?

217
00:11:56,125 --> 00:12:00,250
You're looking
well, Kyo.

218
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:17,416
Kazuma. I'm glad to see
you've made it back safely.

219
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,125
Yes, thank you. And you,
Shigure, I've heard that

220
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:22,083
your writing career is
coming along quite nicely.

221
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,750
Haha- Well, it's
been all right.

222
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:28,875
So this man is Kyo's
martial arts teacher.

223
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:32,041
It's good to see you again,
Master! It's been so long!

224
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,875
It has been a
long time, Master.

225
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:37,375
Yes it has, indeed.
Hello, Kagura.

226
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,125
And Yuki. It
seems you've grown

227
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:40,166
quite a bit since
I last saw you.

228
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,333
[Tohru] Um,
excuse me.

229
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:43,791
I'm sorry. Tohru,
this is Kazuma Sohma.

230
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,958
Kyo's told you about
him before, I believe.

231
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,416
He's his teacher. And
he's also the man

232
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,208
who taught martial arts to
Yuki, Kagura, and Hatsuharu.

233
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:52,208
I see.
That's amazing!

234
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:55,208
So, then. You must be the girl
I've heard so much about.

235
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:58,541
Oh uh, it's nice to
meet you. I'm Tohru Honda.

236
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:02,708
So you are...
so you are.

237
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,333
I understand that
you've come to learn

238
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,208
of the Zodiac
Curse. Is that right?

239
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:07,583
[Tohru] Uh...
uh-huh.

240
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,208
[Shigure] Kyo.

241
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:10,916
You're being awfully
quiet over there.

242
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,083
Don't you at least
want to say hello.

243
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:14,083
I mean, you haven't seen
him since your training

244
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:15,541
in the
mountains, right?

245
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:16,625
How long has that
been? A year?

246
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,083
Ah-

247
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:24,250
Uh Kyo,
wait!

248
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,666
Perhaps you could tell me
where I might find Kyo's room.

249
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,291
Oh, uh-huh.
It's upstairs.

250
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:37,458
Kyo, I'm
coming in.

251
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:43,958
Ah, I'm glad to see you've been
keeping up with your reading.

252
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:47,958
Master, I'm sorry
if I was rude.

253
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:51,500
You're still reluctant as ever
to speak out in front of Yuki.

254
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,458
That's all right.
I understand.

255
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:03,291
Master, it's
good to see you.

256
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,833
You too.

257
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:08,666
[Tohru] Sooo
your master,

258
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,125
he's not a member of
the Zodiac, is he?

259
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,041
No, but still,
he's always had

260
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,375
really close ties
to the main house.

261
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:19,125
You see, before Kyo,
Master's grandfather

262
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:22,000
was the one who carried
the curse of the cat.

263
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,916
I guess that's why he
always seems to understand

264
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,416
what Kyo's going through
better than anyone.

265
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:32,166
But, more than that,
Master's always been

266
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,500
a very important
person in Kyo's life.

267
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,666
They're very close.
Master looks after him,

268
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:43,375
and protects him, just
like a real father.

269
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:47,166
Just like a
real father.

270
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,166
[Kyo] So does this mean
you're back for good?

271
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,250
Are you done with
your training?

272
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:51,958
That's right.
I don't think

273
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,958
I can get away with keeping
the dojo closed much longer.

274
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:57,000
Well, then, I'm comin' back
to the dojo with you, right?

275
00:14:57,083 --> 00:15:00,000
Just like we talked
about before!

276
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:04,041
When I return, we will
live together again.

277
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:10,250
But until that day
comes, farewell.

278
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:13,916
No, Kyo. You will
continue living here.

279
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,875
What do you mean?
You promised!

280
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,708
This is the best place for
you right now, I think.

281
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:19,958
The environment here
has done you good,

282
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:21,375
and will continue
to do so.

283
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:25,250
I think you know it too.
Whether by coincidence or fate,

284
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,291
I believe that
you have come

285
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:27,666
to live in this
house for a reason.

286
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,375
But I hate it here! Even
the damn air in this place!

287
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:33,041
It's smothering
me! I hate it.

288
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:35,500
I just wanna
get outta here.

289
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:44,083
No, I don't think it's that
at all, Kyo. It's not hate.

290
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:52,666
[Kagura] Say,
do you know if

291
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,125
Master's planning
to spend the night?

292
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:57,833
[Tohru] Uhh,
I don't know.

293
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,208
I guess I'll have to get a
place ready for him if he is.

294
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,125
[Kagura] Okay.
I'll go ask him!

295
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:08,583
Tonight, I plan
to do it tonight.

296
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:12,916
And whatever happens, I thought
I should warn you in advance.

297
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:19,375
I see. So what led you to
this decision all of a sudden?

298
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:23,166
Today, looking
at his face,

299
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,791
I saw something there
I didn't expect to see.

300
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:31,375
I think this girl could open
his heart, and accept him.

301
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,250
The time to
act is now.

302
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:39,166
While the opportunity exists,
or so I have determined.

303
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:42,875
So many of our hopes have
been placed in her already.

304
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:46,208
Now she carries
yours as well.

305
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:50,791
Kazuma, are you truly prepared
to trust her with everything?

306
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,500
You do know,
there's a possibility

307
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:00,416
that this will fail,
despite your intentions.

308
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:04,416
And if that happens, this
time, it could break him.

309
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,916
To the point where he
will hate even you,

310
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,083
and never
smile again.

311
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:13,000
And knowing this... you'd
still risk everything

312
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:16,416
for this
one chance?

313
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,416
Uaaa! What the
heck happened?

314
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,250
How'd you manage to
burn it so bad, Master?

315
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:22,875
You're not very good at this
sort of thing, are you?

316
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:26,375
Hmm. Well, when it comes
to the culinary arts

317
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,750
perhaps I could
use more training.

318
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:41,333
I know the risks. Even so, I
want to take a chance on her.

319
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:47,708
And Tohru, what
will this do to her?

320
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:52,083
This is bound to cause
her a great deal of pain.

321
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,416
But still...

322
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:02,708
Yes?

323
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:05,041
I wonder if you might be so
good as to loan me a moment

324
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,208
of your time
this evening.

325
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:08,958
Sure.

326
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,708
Master...

327
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:29,416
If there's somethin'
you gotta tell me,

328
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,916
maybe you better
do it inside.

329
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,833
You know what it does to me
when the weather's like this.

330
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:39,750
Yes, I do. It was the
same with my grandfather.

331
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:43,375
This sort of weather sapped
him of his strength as well.

332
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:46,791
I suspect the Zodiac
Cat in its original form

333
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,750
must have also
hated the rain.

334
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,375
If you don't soon learn
to accept the fact that

335
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:00,375
"original form"
is a part of you,

336
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,041
you will never
move forward.

337
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,166
I have
accepted it!

338
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:20,500
But what does
it matter...

339
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:22,875
My life was over
before it even started,

340
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:25,416
the moment I was born
with this curse...

341
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,500
And you
know why?

342
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,458
It's because of
that damn rat!

343
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:36,083
It's that damn rat's
fault! For everything!

344
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:43,375
You haven't
changed.

345
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:45,500
Is this the way you
intend to go on living,

346
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,250
for the rest
of your days?

347
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,916
...ears
plugged...

348
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,416
...eyes
closed...

349
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:57,583
Hiding... behind your
hatred for Yuki...

350
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,375
Is that the only
way you can justify

351
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:05,750
shutting yourself off
from the world... Is it?

352
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:11,208
What, then... Will you
simply wait for death?

353
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:15,291
Completely alone?

354
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,375
Just like my
grandfather...

355
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:29,125
You said before that
you hate it here.

356
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,833
Well, I don't
believe that's true.

357
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:33,416
You don't
hate it...

358
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,833
But you're afraid to face
what you know you must...

359
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,958
So instead,
you run away...

360
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:47,416
The air that you said
was smothering you...

361
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,416
You know that it could
also heal you...

362
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,541
But you refuse
to let it...

363
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:56,041
You refuse to let anyone see
you for your true self...

364
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:59,541
You're too afraid of
what you might lose...

365
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,291
You're running away
because you're afraid

366
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:03,416
to admit your feelings,
even to yourself.

367
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,875
You're
wron--

368
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:08,666
And so... I will grasp your
hand as you turn to run...

369
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,041
And though this path
may lead to ruin..

370
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:14,416
I will lead you to
it's end... Kyo...

371
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,791
We will
discover now,

372
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:20,041
whether your life was truly
over before it began...

373
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:30,583
It's all
right...

374
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:35,541
It's all right, because
I love you... So...

375
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:39,666
That's why I don't want
anyone to see you...

376
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,583
No one...

377
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:44,708
My child...

378
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:47,375
Don't look
at him!

379
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:49,375
It's disgusting.

380
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:02,166
Don't look
at me!

381
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:06,625
<i>Now let's all gather,</i>

382
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:12,208
<i>Enjoying the company we share,</i>

383
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:17,500
<i>Our tears will dissolve</i>
<i>into thin air,</i>

384
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:23,458
<i>As we drink up</i>
<i>this wonderful life.</i>

385
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:28,375
<i>La, la, la...</i>

386
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:34,500
<i>Takin' in all the</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

387
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:39,583
<i>La, la, la...</i>

388
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:45,625
<i>Drinkin' up all this</i>
<i>good love and life.</i>

389
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:50,708
<i>La, la, la...</i>

390
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:56,458
<i>Take it in all this</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

391
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:27,625
And so... you've seen
Kyo's other form,

392
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:29,916
the one he has kept
hidden from you.

393
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:35,250
It is part of the burden
he bears as the Cat,

394
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:38,250
that he is also cursed to
take this grotesque shape.

395
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:42,125
Do you find
it revolting?

396
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:48,958
Is it
frightening to you?
