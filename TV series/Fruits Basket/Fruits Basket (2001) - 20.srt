1
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:18,125
<i>I was so happy when you smiled,</i>

2
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:21,708
<i>Your smile breaks</i>
<i>through the clouds of grey,</i>

3
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:28,625
<i>Far from the sunny days</i>
<i>that lie in sleep.</i>

4
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:31,583
<i>Waiting with patience</i>
<i>for the Spring,</i>

5
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:35,583
<i>when the flowers will</i>
<i>bloom renewed again,</i>

6
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:42,625
<i>knowing there's more</i>
<i>beyond the pain of today.</i>

7
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:49,000
<i>Although the scars</i>
<i>of yesterday remain,</i>

8
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:56,458
<i>You can go on living as</i>
<i>much as your heart believes.</i>

9
00:00:56,541 --> 00:01:02,958
<i>You can't be born again</i>
<i>although you can change.</i>

10
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:09,666
<i>Let's stay together always.</i>

11
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:34,333
[Tohru] Ayame came by
for another visit...

12
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:38,458
Cheese!

13
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:43,416
Excuse me...
I'm sorry...

14
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,250
You may not remember me from
my one previous appearance...

15
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:47,625
If you've
forgotten,

16
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:50,625
I am the hostess who manages
the Sohma hot spring.

17
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:52,750
I don't often
leave the resort...

18
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:54,333
But today, the producers
asked me if I might come

19
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:56,375
and introduce
Master Ayame...

20
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:59,500
So in spite of my shy
nature, here I am...

21
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:03,208
I'm sorry... I hope my being
here isn't an intrusion...

22
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:06,541
What do we have
here? Oh, I see-

23
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:08,125
The show's
already started.

24
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:14,125
What?! We've started?! Oh no!
What do I do?! Lines... Lines!

25
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:18,291
Ah! Oh no! My script!
Uh, Master Ayame is...

26
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,625
Ahhh! I'm taking
too long!

27
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:23,250
I was supposed to tell
you about his store!

28
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,541
I'm sorry! I've messed
up the introduction!

29
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:27,041
I'm sorry
Mr. Director!

30
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:29,083
And all you people watching
me at home, I am so sorry--

31
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,958
Ahh... These
are so nice...

32
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:35,416
Yes, I know!

33
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,625
Don't worry, Yuki...

34
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:39,250
I have plenty to go
around. You get one too.

35
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:44,375
Business has really perked up
with these new advertisements.

36
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,041
It seems more and more
people are coming to realize

37
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,833
what I've known
all along:

38
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:49,208
in all
the world,

39
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:49,875
there isn't a lovelier
shop to be found than mine!

40
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,250
I want
to see it.

41
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:55,208
What did
you say?

42
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:57,583
I think I'd like to take a
look at this shop of yours...

43
00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:00,416
To see if it's really
as great as you say...

44
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,916
Listen to
this Shigure!

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,333
Just now, Yuki came to me,
and do you know what he said?

46
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:07,541
He wants to
see my shop!

47
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:10,250
He practically begged
me to let him come!

48
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:11,750
I never thought I'd
live to see the day!

49
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:14,333
I can't
contain myself!

50
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:16,958
Hatori, I have wonderful
news! It's Yuki--!

51
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:18,125
Stop it!

52
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:19,625
I'm sorry, it's just
that I'm so excited!

53
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:21,000
Of course you
can come!

54
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,500
Let's make it
this Sunday.

55
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:26,166
And Tohru! You'll come
along too, I hope?

56
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,708
After all, the princess should
always accompany the prince!

57
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:32,125
And as for you, Kyo, you
really don't have to come.

58
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:33,125
You won't
be needed.

59
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:34,708
Huh? What are you
talkin' about?

60
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:36,583
Aww, don't look
so disappointed.

61
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,166
Here. Have
one of my ads.

62
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,916
Get outta here,
you sicko!

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,291
This is a
nice surprise!

64
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:43,541
It seems like Yuki
is finally trying

65
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,541
to reach out to
his brother...

66
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:49,375
Although, he doesn't
look too happy about it.

67
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:50,166
Listen...

68
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,333
Uh... yes?

69
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:53,541
About my...
my brother.

70
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:56,875
Uh-huh...

71
00:03:56,958 --> 00:04:00,500
I've decided...
I'm going to try...

72
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:03,000
Even if it's-- even if
it's just a little bit,

73
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,458
I want to
understand him more...

74
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:07,083
And Miss Honda...

75
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:12,375
I'd like it if
you came with me.

76
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:15,083
It sounds like this is
pretty difficult for him...

77
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:16,416
But he's made
up his mind!

78
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,541
So I'll try to help
in any way I can!

79
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,708
Sure, I'd love to come, if you
don't think I'd be in the way.

80
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:24,416
No...
Not at all.

81
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:27,791
Good! Because
actually,

82
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:30,041
I really have been wanting to
see what Ayame's shop is like!

83
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:31,708
Hatsuharu told me a
little bit about it.

84
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:32,916
He said he sold
outfits for nurses,

85
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,208
and stewardesses,
and maids...

86
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:38,375
Nurses?
Stewardesses?

87
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:39,458
What... the--?

88
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,833
I hope Yuki knows
what he's in for...

89
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:47,708
[Tohru] And so,
that next Sunday,

90
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:50,250
Yuki and I went to pay a
visit to Ayame's shop.

91
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:53,125
I really had no idea what
to expect when we got there.

92
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,916
And, I think,
neither did Yuki...

93
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:02,208
That's the same design as
the one used in his ad.

94
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:03,833
So it
seems...

95
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:06,166
And the sign above the door
looks really nice, too.

96
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,708
I don't know. I'm starting to
feel very uneasy about this...

97
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,708
A fabric store?

98
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:18,041
I'm sorry, but we're
closed today...

99
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:28,791
Mine, we still need
to lift this hem...

100
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:33,416
What is that-- that
hideous thing?!

101
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,875
I don't know, but it's
coming right for me!

102
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:40,875
Oh well... Sorry
about that...

103
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:42,666
That wedding dress
was a special order.

104
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,041
Mine and I were just making
the final alterations.

105
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,833
You're using your
own measurements?

106
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:49,541
Well, yes. The man who ordered
it was about my size...

107
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:52,500
You mean...
it's for a man?

108
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:54,083
It's very
interesting,

109
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:56,000
the things people do
in their private lives.

110
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,708
Everyone has a secret or two
that they keep tucked away...

111
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:02,208
So exactly... what
kind of store is this?

112
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:04,083
It's really not
so mysterious...

113
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:06,625
Many of my customers simply
come here to buy fabrics,

114
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:08,125
or other
handicraft supplies.

115
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,833
But often, a customer will
come to me with a request

116
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,375
for a specially
made garment.

117
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:12,625
As the owner,
of course,

118
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:14,875
I design and make all
of these outfits myself.

119
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,375
Whatever my
customers desire!

120
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,875
If it can be imagined,
I can make it a reality!

121
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:21,708
These are but a few samples
of my finished creations!

122
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:25,000
So this is what Hatsuharu
was talking about!

123
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:27,375
That's really incredible,
Ayame! Absolutely amazing!

124
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,375
Well, of course! I'm
an amazing person.

125
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,250
Now... what do
you think, Yuki?

126
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,583
There's no need
to hold back.

127
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:34,458
You're perfectly free to
shower me with praise!

128
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:37,000
So you get a lot of
orders for these dresses?

129
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:39,416
They're very popular!
Especially the maid's uniform!

130
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,750
They're
popular?

131
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,916
That's right! You may not
understand it yet, Yuki,

132
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,375
but my services here
are very much in demand!

133
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:47,541
I bring men's
fantasies to life!

134
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:50,041
Be it a maid... a waitress
or stewardess... nurse...

135
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:51,125
doctor...
secretary,

136
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:52,958
teacher and/or
student, a female cop,

137
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:54,875
a lawyer, cat
ears, bunny ears!

138
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:57,666
Believe me, the list of
fantasies goes on and on...

139
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,916
These are but a few I have
helped my clients to live out!

140
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,041
I tell them it is no crime
to explore any fantasy,

141
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,833
if you are grounded
in reality!

142
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:07,541
Unexpectedly walking in
on a woman in the bath...

143
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:08,875
this is another
popular fantasy.

144
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:10,625
That is
a crime!

145
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:12,708
Oh my! This is
so much fun!

146
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:15,041
I wondered if we might have
a special visitor today,

147
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,541
when you asked me
to close the shop.

148
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:19,791
But you didn't tell me your
younger brother was coming!

149
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:26,041
Mm-hm! I could tell right away!
You look just like Ayame!

150
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,875
It's very nice to
meet you, finally...

151
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:30,708
I'm Mine Kuramae.
I work here!

152
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:33,083
I'm Ayame's assistant!
I also make clothes!

153
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:36,583
Nice to meet you... Oh,
so then your outfit...

154
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:37,791
that's your uniform
when you work.

155
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,875
Oh, no! I'm wearing
this because I like it!

156
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,208
Isn't it the
cutest thing?

157
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,083
Yes! It's
really adorable!

158
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,708
So today, it's
the maid dress.

159
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:47,208
Tomorrow, who knows? It all
depends what mood I'm in.

160
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:48,583
But I have tons
of outfits!

161
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:50,541
And Mine's glasses
help to give her a look

162
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:53,375
that is actually very popular
among our male customers...

163
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:54,666
What do you
think, Yuki?

164
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,833
How do you feel about
girls who wear glasses?

165
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:58,333
Well... uh...

166
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:00,208
[Mine] The whole look's not
as popular as it used to be.

167
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:01,750
But it hasn't gone out
of style by any means!

168
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:04,583
Aaahh... That's the face of a
man who likes what he sees!

169
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,166
That's right,
brother!

170
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,791
And the appeal of a
girl in glasses is one

171
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:10,416
that's been recognized by
men throughout the ages!

172
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,041
If history has taught
us anything at all,

173
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,041
it's that the
"intelligent look"

174
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,666
never truly goes
out of fashion!

175
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,291
What other dresses
do you wear?

176
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:17,750
Eh? Other
dresses?

177
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:20,083
Well, since you asked, I
pretty much wear anything,

178
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,583
as long as the
mood is right!

179
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,625
There's really no style
of outfit I don't like!

180
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:24,750
Oh! But I
should say,

181
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,208
for a tennis outfit
or school uniform,

182
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,583
I do prefer a plaid skirt
and dark knee-high socks.

183
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:29,625
And for a nurse's uniform,

184
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,375
instead of the
usual white or pink,

185
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,000
I prefer to go with more
interesting colors,

186
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,041
like pastels or
sometimes even red!

187
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,416
And without the nurse's cap!

188
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,500
I guess I like my [beep]
uniforms and [beep] uniforms

189
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:39,875
to have a splash of color, too.

190
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:42,500
Oh! But for [beep] outfits
I usually stick to pink!

191
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,041
I guess I agree with the masses!

192
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:46,333
Especially when you add a cute
little apron to go with it.

193
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:49,250
Well, it's no wonder it's
one of our hottest sellers!

194
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:51,000
You know, now that
I think about it,

195
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,375
maybe I won't just
wear "anything"

196
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:53,625
like I said
at first.

197
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:55,458
I guess I'm really a lot
pickier than I thought!

198
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,208
Which is nothing
to be ashamed of!

199
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:58,708
It's this same sort
of attention to detail

200
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,708
that makes us the
artists that we are!

201
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:03,958
Ha ha! Yay! I got
a compliment! Yay!

202
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:06,458
Yes, well I give praise
where praise is due.

203
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:09,916
But I also have to disagree
with you on one thing...

204
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,625
I still think the best [beep]
for a [beep] uniform is [beep].

205
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,208
Although, recently, I
have been experimenting

206
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,541
with a few designs using [beep].

207
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,708
But why would you choose
a [beep] scheme like that?

208
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,750
The [beep] itself
is the whole point!

209
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,791
I'm striving for something
a bit more "stoic."

210
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:25,541
Well, that is a good quality
for a nurse to have,

211
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,333
but aren't you worried
that gray might be more

212
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:28,541
"somber" than
it is "stoic"?

213
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:30,375
Ah, but you've probably
imagined this nurse

214
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:31,750
wearing dark stockings,

215
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:32,916
since you know that
black and navy

216
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,458
are typically
worn with grays.

217
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:35,541
But what if she were

218
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:36,875
instead wearing gleaming
white knee-highs

219
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:38,541
and a white nurse's
cap on her head!

220
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,416
That might be
interesting...

221
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,875
Of course it is!

222
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:44,250
Remember, it's important to
be mindful of tradition...

223
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,041
But we cannot let our ties
to the past prevent us

224
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,708
from soaring into the future,
in search of new things!

225
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:50,375
Aye-aye...
captain!

226
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,583
Uh... Yuki?

227
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:57,250
By the way... There's something
I've been wondering about...

228
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:58,791
You, Miss!
Over there!

229
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:01,375
Oh! Uh, hi! I'm Tohru Honda!
It's really nice to meet you.

230
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:04,583
Tohru! So tell me! What do
think about all of our dresses?

231
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:07,625
You want to try one of them
on, don't you? I think you do!

232
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,875
Ah... she's found a
new victim, I see...

233
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:12,750
Let's go get something
picked out for you...

234
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:13,791
I should have
warned you,

235
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,083
Mine has this
uncontrollable urge

236
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:16,916
to dress up every
cute girl she sees!

237
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,708
She's quite
ruthless...

238
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,916
Wait! Miss Kuramae!
Hold on a second!

239
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,083
Oh! Did you
have a request

240
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:23,708
for something you'd
like Tohru to wear?

241
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:24,625
I thought we'd try
something innocent...

242
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,416
Uh... Well,
I think a--

243
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,916
No! That's not what
I meant! Please!

244
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,166
Mine... I think I
know just "the thing"

245
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,250
you should have
her try on...

246
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:32,458
You mean
"the thing"?!

247
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:33,583
What's "the
thing"?!

248
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:34,916
Yes, "the thing" is
a perfect choice!

249
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,250
What's "the
thing"?!

250
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,541
Right this way,
Tohru! Don't worry!

251
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:39,958
You're just going
to love "the thing"

252
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:42,000
we have picked
out for you!

253
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,041
Like I said,
Mine's ruthless.

254
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,833
Once she has them,
there's no escape.

255
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:47,250
At any rate, relax.

256
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,708
It's not like she's going
to cook Tohru and eat her.

257
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,250
What's "the
thing"?!

258
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,291
Hello again...

259
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,791
I'm very sorry for ruining
the opening, earlier.

260
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,666
I hope you can forgive
my poor performance.

261
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,833
In all honesty, I was
almost too embarrassed

262
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,791
to come out a
second time.

263
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,958
Anyway... The
reason I'm here is,

264
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,166
we see very little of
Kyo in this episode...

265
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,041
So the producers thought you
might enjoy this little segment

266
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:15,875
we've named
"Kyo's Corner".

267
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,208
As you see
behind me,

268
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:20,208
I've edited together brief
'Kyo Highlight Reel".

269
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:21,958
I sifted through
hours of footage

270
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,500
from previous
episodes...

271
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:26,583
And from that I selected many
of Kyo's greatest moments...

272
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,458
I hope that you will enjoy
this segment as much as I do.

273
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:30,041
Hey! How the hell are
these supposed to be

274
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:31,583
my "greatest
moments"?!

275
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:34,208
Don't "ha,
ha, ha" me!

276
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,500
And what's with this part?
It only has you in it!

277
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,750
I'm sorry! I'll
do it again!

278
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:44,000
I never should have put
myself into the reel!

279
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,333
What was I thinking?!
I am so sorry!

280
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:48,333
I told them we shouldn't
have asked her to come...

281
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:52,375
♪ Sailor suit!
Sailor suit! ♪

282
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:56,958
♪ A rice-ball alien
in a sailor suit! ♪

283
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,250
There, this
should do it.

284
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,041
We'll stay back
here for a while

285
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,291
and give the
brothers a chance

286
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:08,416
to spend some time
by themselves.

287
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:11,208
This may be
meddling on my part,

288
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,250
but it's not often they
get to see each other...

289
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,000
You don't
mind, do you?

290
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,166
So that's why she
took me back here...

291
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,416
No!

292
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,916
Good.

293
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,875
But I hope they can talk to
each other without fighting.

294
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,375
Well, even fighting is
better than nothing.

295
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,833
It's at least proof that they
still acknowledge each other.

296
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,541
That's what Ayame fears
the most, you know...

297
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,958
To... to
have nothing.

298
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:41,541
But if they do fight, I hope
they don't get too rough.

299
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:42,750
It would be
a bad thing

300
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:44,250
if they got blood on
any of the dresses...

301
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:51,833
Yes, as long as they
acknowledge each other,

302
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,250
there's still hope!

303
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:56,875
And even if they can't
now, maybe in time,

304
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:00,208
they'll learn
to get along...

305
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:01,958
Okay, enough
about all that...

306
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:04,416
Now let's hurry up and get
you into your new outfit.

307
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,708
You mean I really
have to change?

308
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:07,750
Oh, yes
you do!

309
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:18,625
Forgive me! Please!
I'm so sorry!

310
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:21,375
I did it again!
I'm interrupting!

311
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:25,125
I didn't even have anything
to say! I'm so sorry!

312
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:26,625
So Shigure
tells me

313
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:28,333
you're the new Student
Council President.

314
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:29,458
Congratulations.

315
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:30,916
But I must say, I
can't help but think

316
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,916
it has something to
do with my influence...

317
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,208
No, that's
not true.

318
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,708
It's only natural
you'd want to follow

319
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,000
in your big
brother's footsteps.

320
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,666
[Yuki] I told you,
that's not true!

321
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,916
It's because I don't
want to do it...

322
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,500
That's why
I'm doing it.

323
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:49,125
I'm sorry,
I guess I--

324
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:52,666
I'm not sure I understand
what it is you're saying.

325
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:56,666
Well... to tell you the truth,
I'd be surprised if you did.

326
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,833
I don't expect you
to understand...

327
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:01,833
Just like I have trouble
understanding this place...

328
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:03,416
We're just too
different, you and I,

329
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:07,875
in the way we act and
the way we think...

330
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:10,416
In the end... maybe
there's no way

331
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,666
we can understand
each other...

332
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,625
Yes! You may
be right!

333
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,000
You don't have to
agree so easily!

334
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,875
But we can't give up! A
journey of a thousand miles

335
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,250
begins with a
single step!

336
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,125
Try hard enough, and
nothing is impossible!

337
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:22,958
You don't sound like
you're trying at all!

338
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:25,916
Fear not, Yuki! I may smile
in the face of adversity,

339
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,875
but I am no stranger to the
hard work and dedication

340
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,291
required to
overcome it!

341
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,250
After all, without
years of diligent effort,

342
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:32,791
I would hardly be the
extraordinary person

343
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:36,250
you see before
you today!

344
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:41,333
I just don't know
what else I can do...

345
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:46,791
You're
hopeless...

346
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,500
I'm sorry.

347
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:51,916
You're right...
I guess I...

348
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I got a little carried
away there, perhaps.

349
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:56,500
It's just, that...

350
00:14:56,583 --> 00:15:01,666
I was so happy that you
wanted to come here today...

351
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:05,583
But I was wrong to think
you could ever forget...

352
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,416
How cruel I
was to you...

353
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,416
How ignorant I was
of your pain...

354
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:15,125
That day, when you reached out
to me for the first time...

355
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:17,208
and the
last...

356
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:20,208
You reached out to me,
pleading for help...

357
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:23,125
with that tiny,
quivering hand...

358
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:24,875
And I turned
you away.

359
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:28,291
I brushed you aside as
though you were nothing...

360
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:33,375
How could you ever
forget that? Or forgive...?

361
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:49,750
Oh... Then... I had no
feelings toward Yuki,

362
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,666
neither love
nor hate...

363
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:55,708
In my mind, it was as
though he didn't even exist.

364
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:59,750
And now... I am
reaching out to him...

365
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,833
and the thought that he might
act the same way I did...

366
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,708
It frightens me.

367
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:08,375
For the first time in my
life, I am truly afraid.

368
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,708
Because... to be
shunned like that...

369
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:13,375
to be so
completely ignored...

370
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:17,916
I understand now, how painfully
alone he must have felt...

371
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,541
I do understand...

372
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:26,583
...only now, that
it's too late...

373
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:29,333
The damage has
forever been done...

374
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:37,666
And yet...

375
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:41,666
Yuki has faced
me directly...

376
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,208
He's listened to
my every word,

377
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:47,833
even though I've done nothing
but to make him angry...

378
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:51,375
And he's still listening...
He hasn't turned away...

379
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:57,500
He's sitting right here,
trying to understand me...

380
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:02,125
It's true, Yuki... you and I
are very different people...

381
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:05,208
but, isn't
that okay?

382
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:11,333
Isn't it possible
to realize

383
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:13,416
the good qualities
in someone else,

384
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,375
even if you don't
share them in yourself?

385
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:22,708
As for me... I think
you're kindness is--

386
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:28,583
it's truly something to
be admired... And I do.

387
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,875
Just as...
I'm sure...

388
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:35,083
You really have no
choice but to admire me

389
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:37,291
for my incredible
charisma and charm!

390
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,375
Not to mention my
impeccable sense of style!

391
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,000
It's okay to admit
it! I know you do!

392
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,208
This really
is hopeless...

393
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:55,583
...or is it?

394
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:58,250
Hel-lo! I hope I'm
not interrupting.

395
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:00,875
Oh! Is Tohru finished
getting dressed already?

396
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:01,708
Well, what are
you waiting for?

397
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:04,125
Let's have a
look at her!

398
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:08,250
As you wish! Tohru... It's
okay. Come on out. Come on!

399
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:38,875
Get on with
it, already!

400
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:45,333
Um... so, how
does it look?

401
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,666
Uh... I--

402
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,125
Excellent!

403
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,375
Tohru, you are the picture
of loveliness and innocence!

404
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:52,250
If only we had a white
puppy and a white parasol

405
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:53,750
to complete
the look!

406
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,000
Mm-hm! And maybe a little
tea set, and a book of poems,

407
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,000
oh it would just
be so perfect!

408
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:59,416
What are you
doing, Yuki?

409
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,583
You should be giving
this lovely girl

410
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:01,916
the compliments
she deserves!

411
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,708
Oh... uh...

412
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:03,875
What's wrong
with you?

413
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:05,708
Here she's dressed up
so nicely for you,

414
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,458
and you're completely
tongue-tied!

415
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:08,708
Well if you
won't do it...

416
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,541
then I will honor
her with a kiss.

417
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:11,750
[Yuki] No
you won't!

418
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:14,166
Oh no, I've gone and
made him angry again.

419
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:17,958
Yes, you certainly
did, didn't you?

420
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:20,666
But as cute as Tohru
looks, it had to be done!

421
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,625
I really must say
something to you:

422
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:23,666
Wonderful job!

423
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,583
Ha! Thank you!
Another compliment!

424
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,750
So... how did it go
while we were in the back?

425
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,708
Were you and your brother
able to do a little bonding?

426
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:37,500
Hmmm...I'm not so sure...
It's hard to say, really.

427
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:42,625
In the end... I'm not
sure what he got from it...

428
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:46,541
But I know that
I, at least,

429
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:50,875
will always cherish the memory
of the time we had today.

430
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:05,625
Miss Honda...

431
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:10,208
I think... I think I've figured
something out about my brother.

432
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,666
I don't necessarily
like what he does...

433
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,083
and half of everything
he says is nonsense...

434
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:19,250
But if I'm ever going
to understand him,

435
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:21,333
I have to accept that
that's just the way he is,

436
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:23,166
and then try to look
beyond his faults.

437
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,791
Otherwise, I think
the more I see him,

438
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,833
the more it's only
going to wear me out.

439
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:29,083
Oh...
h-hah...

440
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,916
Somehow, it makes me
very sad to say that.

441
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,958
But still...

442
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:39,250
Miss Tohru... I'm glad
we came here today.

443
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:53,541
Because... I also got to
see you looking so adorable.

444
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:57,875
Oh! No! Really! I
mean-- I'm not-- uh...

445
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:09,208
You don't have
to hide it.

446
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:15,583
Romance... That's the
emotion you're feeling

447
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:17,083
in your heart
right now.

448
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:19,250
Believe me, I know all too
well how easily a man's heart

449
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:21,000
can be swayed by
a dress alone!

450
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,416
And, really, I
must say I am truly

451
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,666
honored that my work has
affected you so deeply!

452
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,250
Today will forever
live on in my memory as

453
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:27,458
"Yuki's Day
of Romance!"

454
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:28,541
Cut it out!

455
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:29,875
Well, I guess
they're fighting again.

456
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:32,000
I hope they're careful
with the dresses.

457
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:39,666
But, I suppose that's
better than nothing, right?

458
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,916
Mm-hm!

459
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:50,041
...and that's when, Tohru came
out in this adorable dress

460
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:51,583
(my own design
I might add)

461
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:53,875
which is what inspired today
to be "Yuki's Day of Romance"!

462
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:55,291
Ahh, Ha'ri,
shame on you!

463
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:58,041
You were just imagining
Tohru in a dress, weren't you!

464
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:00,208
Not that I blame you.
You should have seen her!

465
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:01,458
The picture
of innocence!

466
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:06,916
<i>Now let's all gather,</i>

467
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,500
<i>Enjoying the company we share,</i>

468
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:17,791
<i>Our tears will dissolve</i>
<i>into thin air,</i>

469
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:23,750
<i>As we drink up</i>
<i>this wonderful life.</i>

470
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:28,708
<i>La, la, la...</i>

471
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:34,791
<i>Takin' in all the</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

472
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:39,875
<i>La, la, la...</i>

473
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:45,916
<i>Drinkin' up all this</i>
<i>good love and life.</i>

474
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
<i>La, la, la...</i>

475
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:56,791
<i>Take it in all this</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

476
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:25,083
[Hiro] I came all
this way to meet you!

477
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:27,291
You could at least say,
"thank you" or something.

478
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:28,583
[Tohru]
Oh, but I--

479
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:30,333
[Hiro] Come on! Do complete
strangers tell you

480
00:23:30,416 --> 00:23:32,041
they came to meet
you everyday?

481
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:33,583
Put it
together!

482
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:35,875
I think by now it should be
pretty easy to guess who I am.

483
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:37,500
[Tohru] He's a memeber
of the Zodiac!

484
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,041
[Hiro] You're not too
quick, are you?

485
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:40,708
[Kyo] Hiro, what are
you doing out here?

486
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:42,500
[Hiro] Why? Do I need a
permit or something?

487
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:44,208
Do I have to have a
reason to be here?

488
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:46,375
Maybe I'm just sitting
here 'cause I want to.

489
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:47,750
Or is that some
kind of crime?

490
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:48,791
[Kyo] I didn't
say any of that!

491
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:50,750
I just asked you
a simple question!

492
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:52,375
[Hiro] And what, just
because you asked

493
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:53,958
does that mean
I have to answer?

494
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:55,583
Maybe I don't want to
tell you why I'm here.

495
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:57,875
[Kyo] Dammit! You know for
a snot-nosed little kid

496
00:23:57,958 --> 00:23:59,708
you sure got
a big mouth.
