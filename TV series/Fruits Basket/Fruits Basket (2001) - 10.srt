1
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:18,125
<i>I was so happy when you smiled,</i>

2
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:21,708
<i>Your smile breaks</i>
<i>through the clouds of grey,</i>

3
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:28,625
<i>Far from the sunny days</i>
<i>that lie in sleep.</i>

4
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:31,583
<i>Waiting with patience</i>
<i>for the Spring,</i>

5
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:35,583
<i>when the flowers will</i>
<i>bloom renewed again,</i>

6
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:42,625
<i>knowing there's more</i>
<i>beyond the pain of today.</i>

7
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:49,000
<i>Although the scars</i>
<i>of yesterday remain,</i>

8
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:56,458
<i>You can go on living as</i>
<i>much as your heart believes.</i>

9
00:00:56,541 --> 00:01:02,958
<i>You can't be born again</i>
<i>although you can change.</i>

10
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:09,666
<i>Let's stay together always.</i>

11
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:30,041
[Girl 1] Hey,
check it out!

12
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:32,208
That guy over there is,
like, unbelievably hot!

13
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:34,041
[Girl 2] Yeah! I wonder
what he's got going on?

14
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:36,041
He looks like he's on his
way to a rave or something...

15
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:38,708
You're right. He looks
like a total club kid.

16
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:40,916
Let's go talk to him!
A cool guy like that?

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,166
I'll bet we can
have some fun!

18
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:52,708
[Tohru] Winter
break is over,

19
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:55,541
and the third term has
started at school...

20
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:57,291
Wipe that smug little
smirk off your face

21
00:01:57,375 --> 00:01:59,333
before I come over
there and do it for you!

22
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:00,750
Yeah, you'll be sorry
then, won't you?

23
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:01,875
And I'll make
you say it!

24
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:03,208
I'm sorry.

25
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:05,833
Shut up! You're a real
wise ass! You know that?!

26
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:07,250
At least I'm not
the noisy idiot

27
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:08,833
who's causing a scene
in front of the store...

28
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:10,375
Oh, you've done
it now, girly-boy!

29
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:11,875
We're takin'
this outside!

30
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:14,708
We're already outside,
you stupid cat.

31
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:16,291
Sorry I
took so long.

32
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:18,375
Ah... find everything
you needed?

33
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:20,708
Uh...
uh-huh...

34
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:22,625
[Tohru] It seems like Yuki
and Kyo are getting along

35
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:24,708
even worse
than usual...

36
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:26,041
It's too bad.

37
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:28,000
Especially since the wish
I made this New Year's

38
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:30,500
was that the two of them would
start getting along better...

39
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,041
But I guess...

40
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:34,875
I guess it didn't really have
much of an effect, did it...

41
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:36,958
You know, you are starting
to get on my nerves.

42
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:39,291
Oh yeah? So why don't
you try to do something

43
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:42,125
about it,
girly boy--

44
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:42,791
Leeks...

45
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,250
Kyo!

46
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,416
There. That should keep him
quiet for a little while.

47
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:53,208
Hey! I'm out of the tub...
Who's in next? Yuki?

48
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:55,291
I think I'll
skip it today.

49
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:58,458
Eww... How can you
stand to be so dirty?

50
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:01,041
Just once, I'd like to
knock him through the roof...

51
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:03,375
What's wrong? Are
you feeling okay?

52
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:07,000
Well... No... I think I'm
coming down with a cold.

53
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:08,416
A cold?!

54
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,708
You do have a
bit of a fever.

55
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,625
[Shigure] Well, it's best
to treat these things early.

56
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:15,791
Take some medicine, get
some rest, all that...

57
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,375
I think I have just
the thing here...

58
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,666
Maybe you should stay
home from school tomorrow...

59
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,375
No, I'm all right... It
won't have to come to that.

60
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:25,375
Are you sure? We are supposed
to do our endurance run...

61
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:27,083
Oh, so they
still have those?

62
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,291
It almost
seems cruel,

63
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,375
making you kids run
around in the cold...

64
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:33,791
An endurance
run, huh?!

65
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:36,083
[Tohru] Yes... You
mean you didn't know?

66
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:38,375
The endurance run...
a set distance...

67
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,291
a certain time
to beat...

68
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:41,125
In other words...

69
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:42,875
It's a race!

70
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,250
All right,
rat boy!

71
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,291
Tomorrow we're going to
find out who's the fastest!

72
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:49,041
Um, Kyo. Yuki's starting
to come down with a cold...

73
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:50,500
So you better give
him something to eat

74
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:51,708
and put
him to bed!

75
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,291
He's not gettin'
out of this one!

76
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:56,708
Here take one of these... And
all joking aside, remember,

77
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:58,791
if you strain your body
too much, you'll transform.

78
00:03:58,875 --> 00:03:59,958
Don't
overdo it.

79
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,458
I know...

80
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,708
I'm not so sure
this is a good idea.

81
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,000
I'd feel
much better

82
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:07,416
if he stayed home tomorrow
and got some rest...

83
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:13,458
Hey
Yuki...

84
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,000
...how are you
feeling today?

85
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:19,458
Don't worry... I think I'll
be able to manage... Besides...

86
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:20,916
If I don't
do this,

87
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,875
that stupid cat will never
let me hear the end of it...

88
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:26,541
You know, I don't believe I've
seen Miss Uotani here today...

89
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:29,875
Right. She thought this
might be a good day to skip.

90
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,041
Hana's here,
though!

91
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:32,708
[Coach] All right,
girls! You're up first!

92
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:34,625
Everybody make your way to
the starting line at the gate.

93
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,958
Well,
gotta run!

94
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:38,166
Good luck.

95
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,458
Hey Hana, let's do
our best today for Uo

96
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:41,791
since she's
not here...

97
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,000
All right... I've never
been very good at running,

98
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,041
but since
you asked,

99
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,125
I will try
my hardest.

100
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:49,250
Okay, on your
marks... Get set!

101
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:55,708
Oh! Hana, what's the
matter? Are you okay?

102
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:59,625
Tohru, I'm sorry. I
can't run any further...

103
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:01,583
I've done
my best,

104
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,666
but now I've reached
the edge of my limits...

105
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,250
And don't worry, I'll
be right behind you

106
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:10,708
the whole time...
only walking.

107
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:12,416
Hana...

108
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,750
Walk, crawl, I don't care.
Just start, Miss Hanajima!

109
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,208
I wonder if Hana's doing
all right back there...

110
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,708
I guess it's about time the
boys were starting, too...

111
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:30,375
I hope Yuki really is
okay, like he says...

112
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,958
Huh? What's that?

113
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,958
That white hair!
An old man?!

114
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:38,291
Sir!
What's wrong?

115
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,625
Wait... he looks
like he's my age!

116
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:43,541
I'm sorry! I just thought,
well, your hair is so white,

117
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:44,541
I thought you
were an old man

118
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:46,083
that had fallen
down or something!

119
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:47,875
I mean, not that you
look like an old man--

120
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:50,666
Have you ever heard of a
place called Sohma House?

121
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,500
Oh yeah! Eat my
dust, rat boy!

122
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:57,500
Shut up.

123
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:02,958
What do they think this
is, the 100-meter dash?

124
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:05,500
That's just
stupid...

125
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:09,041
Eh, Sohma House?
So then...

126
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:12,708
...by any chance, are
you a Sohma? Maybe?

127
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,833
That's right. So
you know it, then?

128
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,041
Oh, y- yes! I'm, um, I'm
pleased to meet you!

129
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,666
I'm Tohru--
uh?

130
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:20,458
What
is it?

131
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:24,041
He's
coming.

132
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,333
Wow, so if he's part
of the Sohma family,

133
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:28,375
then maybe he's part
of the zodiac, too!

134
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:31,791
Um... What
are you doing?

135
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,250
Got him.

136
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,583
Kyo! Are
you hurt?!

137
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:43,416
Kyo!

138
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,875
Miss Honda?

139
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:46,750
What the hell are you
doing?! Dammit!

140
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,458
I was winning
and everything!

141
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:49,625
If I hadn't
tripped you,

142
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:51,625
you wouldn't have
stopped, now would you.

143
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:52,958
Haru?

144
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:55,333
By the way, what I just
did was very dangerous...

145
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,041
And if that had been
anyone other than Kyo,

146
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,708
they'd probably had
been hurt pretty badly.

147
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,041
So, don't try
this at home.

148
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:02,291
Don't try it here! Who
are you even talking to?!

149
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:04,041
So, now
it's Haru...

150
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:07,375
They just keep showing
up, don't they.

151
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:08,791
Shouldn't you
be at school?

152
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:11,041
Yeah... well, I
actually left on Sunday

153
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:12,500
with the intention
of coming here,

154
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:13,416
but I was swept
away into the heart

155
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,833
of a dark,
urban wilderness.

156
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:17,541
It took me three days
to find my way out.

157
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,708
Why don't you just
say you got lost?

158
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:22,208
His sense of direction's
as crappy as ever...

159
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:23,250
But if you're
gonna get lost,

160
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:24,500
that's an impressive
way to do it!

161
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,291
Oh yeah? Well it means
he hasn't had a bath

162
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:27,958
in three
days... Gross!

163
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,041
Um...
Hey...

164
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,625
do you think we should move
somewhere off the road?

165
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,208
[Yuki] Mmm. That
might be wise...

166
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,708
Oh... this
is Hatsuharu...

167
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:38,583
He's still in his third
year of middle school,

168
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,291
one year
behind us.

169
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:42,833
Haru, this is
Miss Tohru Honda.

170
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:45,833
Well then, Miss Tohru Honda...
it is a pleasure to meet you.

171
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:48,958
Oh, no! The pleasure's
all mine! Really!

172
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,958
He's so polite.

173
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:52,333
He seems like he's a
lot more grown-up

174
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:55,291
than you'd expect from
someone in middle school...

175
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,458
[Kyo] So, what did you
come here for, anyway?

176
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:58,500
[Haru]
To fight.

177
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,708
I was planning to challenge
you at the New Year's banquet,

178
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:05,375
but you decided to skip...
So I've come to you.

179
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:06,166
Now let's
do it.

180
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,583
H-Hold on
a minute!

181
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:08,583
I'm right in the middle
of something here,

182
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,416
in case you
hadn't noticed!

183
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,416
I've already wasted three
days looking for you...

184
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,708
That's your own damn fault!
You're the one who got lost!

185
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,708
Um, I think this
conversation

186
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:19,625
just took a turn
for the worse...

187
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,375
This could
get ugly.

188
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,458
Hey, Kyo... maybe you
should just go ahead

189
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:24,750
and do what he
says before--

190
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:27,083
No! I said no,
and I mean no!

191
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:28,250
Now get outta
here! I'm busy--

192
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,833
You make me sick... You and
your pathetic, girly whining.

193
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:37,458
Too late.

194
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:39,583
You're not
a man.

195
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:42,125
You're a little kitty-cat,
too scared to fight!

196
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:46,791
Know what? You
can go to hell!

197
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,125
You little punk!!

198
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,750
[Kyo] What's your problem?
What did I ever do to you?!

199
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:54,666
That idiot. He just had to
go and bring out Black Haru.

200
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,041
B- B-
Black...?

201
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,833
Haru's pretty easy
to get along with,

202
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:01,041
but once he snaps,
he's uncontrollable...

203
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,083
That's our
nickname for him

204
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,041
when he's like
this: "Black Haru".

205
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:06,625
Ah... So-- what
you're saying is,

206
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:09,000
he's got the same sort
of temper as Kagura?

207
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,041
Not at
all...

208
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:14,375
...I'm saying he's a
thousand times worse.

209
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:17,333
Yuki. Are you comfortable?
Enjoying the show?

210
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:19,083
Hope so, 'cause I'm
coming for you next.

211
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:20,541
Oh, is
that a fact.

212
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:22,708
Get up, Kyo!

213
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:25,041
I've been up! Where
the hell were you?

214
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,250
I'm right here.
C'mon! Fight!

215
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,000
You know... this could
go on for hours.

216
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:30,583
You really don't
have to stay.

217
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:31,666
Uh...
but...

218
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,333
"Go away!"
"Leave me alone!"

219
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:35,666
When did you become
such a little pansy, huh?

220
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,291
You know, when you go Black,
you are a real bastard!

221
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:41,208
Oh yeah? Just for that,
when I'm done with you...

222
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:42,875
I'm gonna take your
little girlfriend.

223
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,625
What the--
You're gonna what?

224
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:47,500
Oh, you know. I'm gonna do
this, and a little of that,

225
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,291
and I'm definitely
gonna do that!

226
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,041
Huh? What is he--

227
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:52,291
This is the same
little brat

228
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:53,791
that used to get lost on
the way to the bathroom

229
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:55,333
if I didn't
take him.

230
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:58,083
And now he thinks he's some
kind of... I don't know what.

231
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:00,250
He really is a bastard
when he goes Black.

232
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,833
Who got him all
worked up, anyway?

233
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,541
Okay, I guess
that was me.

234
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,291
So why's he gotta
bring Tohru into this?

235
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:06,708
What's she got to
do with anything?

236
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:07,916
And what's he
talking about,

237
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,083
all this "I'll do this,
I'll do that" crap?

238
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,416
Whatever it is...

239
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,000
You're sick!

240
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:16,583
And if it's a fight you want,
you got it! Just bring it on!

241
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:17,791
That's more like
it, coward.

242
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,125
It's about time
you came around!

243
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:21,666
Miss Honda... This
really will take a while.

244
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,625
You should head
back if you want.

245
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:26,416
But shouldn't we... at
least try to stop them?

246
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:29,833
Hey, Saki!

247
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:31,958
Maybe you should
try runnin', huh?

248
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:32,750
No.

249
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:41,125
Come on, what's the
matter!? Hit me!

250
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,500
What fight are
you watching?

251
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,583
You haven't landed a single
punch yet! You hit me!

252
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:45,875
You got it!

253
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:48,541
Somehow, this has turned
into a fighting anime.

254
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:49,791
Um...
Excuse me...

255
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,875
Let's leave them
alone, Miss Honda...

256
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:53,750
It's best to let
them fight it out.

257
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:56,250
It's what they
want... Besides...

258
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:57,750
I don't know
about you,

259
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,916
but I'd rather not be the
one who stands between them...

260
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,666
It's a
little risky...

261
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,541
I still can't believe
this is the same Hatsuharu

262
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,541
I met a few
minutes ago...

263
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:09,291
He seemed like such a nice
person... and now this...

264
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,875
You pansy! What kind of
girly punch is that?!

265
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:13,625
I didn't even
feel it!

266
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,208
It almost doesn't
seem possible,

267
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,666
that a person can just
snap and change this much...

268
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,625
Then again, I'm getting the
impression that the Sohmas

269
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:22,125
have a lot of people like
this in their family...

270
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:27,000
Don't get cocky,
you brat!

271
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,833
Compared to Yuki,
you move like a turtle!

272
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:30,958
Heh! So what does
that make you?

273
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:34,416
You still can't beat Yuki
yourself, now can you, Loser!

274
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,958
And you did all that
extra training, too...

275
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:38,833
You're even worse
than a turtle!

276
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:40,750
You're a snail!
An amoeba!!

277
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,791
I am seriously
gonna murder you!

278
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,458
He's not
serious.

279
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:48,750
Oh... But...
look at him...

280
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,875
I've never seen Kyo
fight like this...

281
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:56,125
Yes... well... against Haru...
Kyo does seem a lot stronger...

282
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:59,291
If you ask me, they're both
a couple of fighting fools...

283
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,708
They've been studying martial
arts since they were...

284
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:05,958
since they
were...

285
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:06,916
Oh...
Yuki?

286
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:09,291
Yuki!

287
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:11,375
Yuki!

288
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:12,916
Is it an
asthma attack?

289
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,791
His bronchial tubes...

290
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:17,458
And you have a
fever too, don't you?

291
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:21,000
You know you're not supposed to
overdo it when you're sick...

292
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:23,083
Just lie here
for now.

293
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:24,958
Go call the main house,
and hurry! --huh?

294
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,291
Yuki...

295
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:34,083
This is bad... This is really
bad. He can hardly breathe.

296
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:36,125
I knew I should have tried
to make him stay home today...

297
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:38,833
You don't want the
main house, huh?

298
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:40,708
Kyo, you don't mind if we
finish our fight later...

299
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:41,875
do you?

300
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:43,125
Uh-uh...

301
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:45,000
We need to get him back
to Shigure's somehow.

302
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:48,458
Damn... I guess this means the
endurance run is over, too...

303
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:51,291
That really bites.
I was winning.

304
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:54,166
I'd say we could take a
taxi, but I don't know.

305
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:57,500
It'll be a real pain if he
transforms in the back seat.

306
00:12:57,583 --> 00:13:01,041
But we have to do something!
I'll do anything!

307
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,750
Okay... Maybe there is
something we can do...

308
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,000
It's lucky for me
you're so cute...

309
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,166
I mean, if I'm
gonna do it,

310
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,708
it should be with
someone cute, right?

311
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:20,875
Hold on to the back of my
neck, so I don't change back.

312
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:24,625
It'll be easier on Yuki
if we carry him like this.

313
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,291
That's it...

314
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:32,041
It was a good run, but at
last it has come to an end...

315
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,625
You dealt me the ace.
I have a royal flush.

316
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:36,375
What,
again?!

317
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:38,958
How do you always get
all the good cards?

318
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,333
You guys, if you're not
going to run, go home.

319
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:45,000
So, you came all the way here
looking like that, did you?

320
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,333
It's not funny.

321
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,583
[Shigure] There. We'll let
him sleep for a while.

322
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,291
Looks like it was
just a mild attack.

323
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,541
He still has a slight fever,
but he'll be all right.

324
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:54,916
Thank
goodness!

325
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,208
Sorry for the scare, Tohru.
But it's really okay.

326
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:58,875
You can go back to
school now, if you want.

327
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:01,250
Oh, no-- I mean,
school is important,

328
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:02,625
but I just wouldn't
feel right going back

329
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,708
when I know that he's
lying here sick...

330
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:07,750
I'm sure Mom will
understand if I miss a day.

331
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:11,791
And besides-- I feel a
little bit responsible...

332
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,875
I should have asked
him to stay home today.

333
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,541
His cold might not
have gotten this bad...

334
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:16,916
I'll tell
you what.

335
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,833
How about I go
to the school

336
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,625
and pick up your
things for you.

337
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:22,125
You really don't have to
go to all that trouble...

338
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,416
No, no. No
trouble at all...

339
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,208
In the meantime, Kyo,
why don't you call Hatori?

340
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:29,375
Huh? Why do I
gotta do it?

341
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:30,458
Watch yourself, though.

342
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:32,083
Hatori's a bit
overworked these days,

343
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,791
so he's probably not
in the best of moods...

344
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,375
From what
I hear,

345
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,708
practically the entire family
has come down with the flu...

346
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:39,833
I'll call
him.

347
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,125
Where's the
phone, again?

348
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,708
Dammit! Put some
clothes on first!

349
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:47,583
Well, I'm off. Take good
care of Yuki while I'm gone.

350
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:50,791
Okay, and thank
you so much!

351
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:52,125
It's so nice of
him to do this.

352
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,333
Shigure can be so
selfless sometimes.

353
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:56,291
He's always thinking
about others...

354
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:59,208
High school girls,
high school girls!

355
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:03,916
All for me,
high school girls!

356
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,791
Mm-hm. I understand...
R-Right.

357
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,541
So what's Hatori
got to say?

358
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:12,541
He sounded mad at me, for
some reason... Strange, huh?

359
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:15,083
That's what happens when you
disappear for three days.

360
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:19,083
So, what now? I guess we got
that damn rat taken care of...

361
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:20,583
You ready to
finish our fight?

362
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,416
Nah, forget it...

363
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,583
You really have
gotten stronger, Kyo.

364
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,375
I think I need
more training.

365
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:28,208
Hold it
right there!

366
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,041
You think you can pick a
fight and then just walk away

367
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,583
whenever you feel
like it! Huh?!

368
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:34,916
Just 'cause you changed
back to "White Haru"

369
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
doesn't mean
you get--

370
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:38,708
So... you're not
"Black Haru" any more?

371
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,541
Uh...
no.

372
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,000
I'm sorry...
It's just,

373
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:44,041
you seem like a completely
different person...

374
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:45,333
How's Yuki.

375
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:46,583
He's still
sleeping.

376
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,833
Don't attack him while
he's passed out, Kyo.

377
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:49,958
Shut up!!

378
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:51,333
What good does it
do me if I beat him

379
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:52,666
with a cheap
trick like that?!

380
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,083
The day I knock that
damn rat on his tail

381
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:55,833
it's gonna be
fair and square!

382
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:58,291
Hell with it. I'm
going back to school.

383
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:07,208
Yuki and Kyo, do they still
get in fist fights every day?

384
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,250
No, but they
argue just about

385
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,208
every time they
see each other...

386
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:13,041
Huh. Well that means
they're getting along

387
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,916
a little better,
at least...

388
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,250
It wasn't
long ago,

389
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,458
that the idea would've
seemed pretty hopeless.

390
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,083
No...
Hopeless?

391
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,625
That's how
it seemed...

392
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:24,208
But I can tell they've
both changed since then...

393
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:26,416
There used to be so much
tension between them,

394
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,958
if they were in the same room
you could feel it in the air...

395
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:32,500
Things seem much
more relaxed now...

396
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,500
It could be because
you're here...

397
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,208
No, I doubt I've made that
much of a difference...

398
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,750
Well, I can't
prove that yet.

399
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,250
But I haven't been around
enough to see what's going on.

400
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,708
But I guess the reason
isn't really important.

401
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:49,291
I'm just glad to see
they're doing better...

402
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,500
Especially Yuki... He was
my first love, after all.

403
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:57,791
Nothing against Kyo. Yuki
is just very special to me...

404
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:00,458
Although, when we were
kids, I couldn't stand him.

405
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,208
I hated
his guts.

406
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:05,375
Oh...
Really? Why?

407
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:06,958
Because
he's the Rat.

408
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,083
[Haru] It's in the
old story, right?

409
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:15,041
How the Rat rode on the Cow's
back to the zodiac banquet...

410
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:16,333
I used to hate
that story

411
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:20,625
when I was a little
kid... The Cow...

412
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:22,458
...the Cow was
a stupid fool...

413
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,875
letting the Rat use
him like that...

414
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:27,375
That's what all the adults
used to tell me, anyway...

415
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:32,958
I know they were probably half
joking when they said it...

416
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:34,500
...still, I couldn't
help but feel

417
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:37,625
I was the one they were
laughing at, calling stupid...

418
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,375
And after hearing
it over and over,

419
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,666
I had so much anger towards
that Rat bottled up inside

420
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,375
I couldn't
contain it.

421
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:48,041
I started losing my temper
over the tiniest things...

422
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:49,541
I guess that's when
my "Black" personality

423
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,916
first began
to appear...

424
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,583
It got to be too much
for my parents to handle,

425
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:57,000
so they had me take
martial arts lessons,

426
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:59,416
hoping that would give
me a way to vent...

427
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,083
Hiya!

428
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,000
Your form
sucks!

429
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:05,541
It didn't really help,
like they thought it would...

430
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:08,208
I enjoyed the training
itself, but even there,

431
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:12,541
it still felt like I was
getting laughed at a lot...

432
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,625
And then
one day...

433
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,541
I happened to
bump into Yuki.

434
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:17,875
The truth is,
up until then,

435
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,875
I'd never even
said a word to him.

436
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:22,708
The only time we ever saw
each other was at New Year's...

437
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:25,541
But that day, seeing
him sitting there,

438
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:30,416
all of my anger began to
swell up at once. I exploded.

439
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,375
I hate your guts!
It's the Rat's fault

440
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:34,250
everybody
laughs at the cow!

441
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:37,583
It's the Rat's fault they call
the cow a fool, and an idiot!

442
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:40,625
It's your fault! The
dirty, mean, stinking Rat!

443
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,916
Well, is
it true?

444
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:53,541
About you, I mean. Is it?
Is that what you are?

445
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,250
Are you a fool?

446
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:10,083
No... No, I'm
not... I...

447
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:17,166
I'm not a fool...
I'm not a fool!

448
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,458
Mm-hmm...

449
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,458
I didn't
think so.

450
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:34,208
After that, I began to lose
my temper less and less.

451
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,041
Yuki had finally allowed
me to vent the anger

452
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:38,500
that had filled
me up for so long.

453
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:41,958
It felt as though my heart
had suddenly been set free.

454
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:45,541
I was completely surprised.
In every possible way,

455
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:46,541
Yuki was different
from the person

456
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:48,541
I'd imagined
him to be...

457
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:52,375
It's true.
Until that point,

458
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,750
it had never occurred
to me he could be anything

459
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:57,166
other than
the "mean rat".

460
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:01,625
And to think... If I
hadn't met him that day...

461
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:05,541
The "mean rat" is probably
all I'd see, even now.

462
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,750
Then I would really
would be a fool.

463
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:13,000
That's a
wonderful story.

464
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:15,041
I was surprised
today, too--

465
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:18,125
seeing Yuki next to you, with
that little smile on his face.

466
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,791
That was a
first for me...

467
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:24,458
He never smiled like that when
he lived at the main house...

468
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,041
That's why I
was thinking,

469
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,208
maybe it's
your influence

470
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,875
that's helped him
to soften up a bit...

471
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:32,166
Oh, no that can't be! I'm
sure it's something else!

472
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,000
I mean, I don't know
what I could have done

473
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:33,958
that would
be so great--

474
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,375
I'll prove
it to you.

475
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,208
When he
wakes up...

476
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:43,958
Uh...
Miss Honda?

477
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,666
Hi.
Welcome back.

478
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,541
That's right!
I was...

479
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:49,916
I hope I wasn't
any trouble...

480
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,208
No, it's
all right...

481
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,541
But how... how
did I get here?

482
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:56,291
Hatsuharu transformed and
carried you on his back...

483
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,500
Well, thank you... It
must have been a sight.

484
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,708
No... I didn't
mind at all.

485
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:05,375
You were asleep by
the time we got home.

486
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:07,125
And since then, I've been
telling Tohru the story

487
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,416
about why I
like you...

488
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,708
What, is that
the only thing

489
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,291
you could think
of to talk about?

490
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:14,291
I at least hope you didn't bore
her with too many details...

491
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,000
She seemed
interested...

492
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:21,083
It's okay. It was a very
nice story... 'Prince' Yuki...

493
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:23,208
Well, don't pay any
attention to Haru, he--

494
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:32,458
When he
wakes up...

495
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,333
Try calling him by
his nickname once...

496
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:36,166
I'll bet it
cheers him up.

497
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:42,291
There, you see... It doesn't
work at all when I say it...

498
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:47,500
[Tohru] And so, despite a
few bumps along the way,

499
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:49,291
everyone managed to
survive the endurance run...

500
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:51,666
Unfortunately, by the
end of the evening,

501
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,083
a few more of them had
come down with colds...

502
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:55,416
That's what happens
when you sit out

503
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,250
in the freezing air for
hours, playing Old Maid...

504
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:06,916
<i>Now let's all gather,</i>

505
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,500
<i>Enjoying the company we share,</i>

506
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:17,791
<i>Our tears will dissolve</i>
<i>into thin air,</i>

507
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:23,750
<i>As we drink up</i>
<i>this wonderful life.</i>

508
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:28,708
<i>La, la, la...</i>

509
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:34,791
<i>Takin' in all the</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

510
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:39,875
<i>La, la, la...</i>

511
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:45,916
<i>Drinkin' up all this</i>
<i>good love and life.</i>

512
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
<i>La, la, la...</i>

513
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:56,791
<i>Take it in all this</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

514
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:27,541
[Tohru] It's gonna be an
interesting Valentines day.

515
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:29,250
[Shigure]
Here! Ha'ri,

516
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:31,750
I got you some
Vaentine's chocolates!

517
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:34,083
[Kagura] A chocolate heart
stuffed full of my love,

518
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:35,916
all for you!

519
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,916
[Kyo] Keep it! What man
in his right mind

520
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,625
would eat that
girly, sugary crap!

521
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:45,125
[Tohru] I'm sorry, but, do you
really not like chocolate, Kyo?

522
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:49,583
[Kyo] Fine! I just gotta
eat it? So, I'll eat it!

523
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:52,666
[Yuki]
Idiot.
