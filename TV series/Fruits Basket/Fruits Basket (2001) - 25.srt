1
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:18,125
<i>I was so happy when you smiled,</i>

2
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:21,708
<i>Your smile breaks</i>
<i>through the clouds of grey,</i>

3
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:28,625
<i>Far from the sunny days</i>
<i>that lie in sleep.</i>

4
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:31,583
<i>Waiting with patience</i>
<i>for the Spring,</i>

5
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:35,583
<i>when the flowers will</i>
<i>bloom renewed again,</i>

6
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:42,625
<i>knowing there's more</i>
<i>beyond the pain of today.</i>

7
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:49,000
<i>Although the scars</i>
<i>of yesterday remain,</i>

8
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:56,458
<i>You can go on living as</i>
<i>much as your heart believes.</i>

9
00:00:56,541 --> 00:01:02,958
<i>You can't be born again</i>
<i>although you can change.</i>

10
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:09,666
<i>Let's stay together always.</i>

11
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:35,583
Don't look at me!

12
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:44,250
[Akito] I've never seen
anything so ugly...

13
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:55,458
And that
smell... awful...

14
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:04,416
It smells like something
dead and rotting...

15
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,416
It's the cat's
evil spirit...

16
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:30,333
This is its
true form...

17
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:39,375
It's disgusting.

18
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,208
K- Kyo...?

19
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:56,500
She saw me... She
saw me... She saw me!

20
00:02:56,583 --> 00:03:01,083
It's over now... It's all
over! There's no hope!

21
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,583
[Kazuma] And so, you have
seen Kyo's other form...

22
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:10,208
The one he has kept
hidden from you.

23
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:13,083
It is part of the burden
he bears as the Cat,

24
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:17,208
that he is also cursed to
take this grotesque shape...

25
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:19,541
Do you find
it revolting?

26
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:23,416
Is it...
frightening... to you?

27
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:49,250
Please...

28
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,375
Kyo...

29
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:58,875
Kyo...?

30
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:01,125
Kyo... Kyo!

31
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:09,583
[Akito] What's this...?
Tohru Honda...?

32
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:19,375
But what are you doing out
here? Is something wrong?

33
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:37,291
Aw... How
awful...

34
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,708
It serves you
right, you know...

35
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:04,958
What do you really
know about the Sohmas?

36
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:06,333
Do you think
you understand

37
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:10,208
what it means to
be cursed? Do you?

38
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:14,375
I only have a short
time left to live...

39
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,166
Nothing can
change that...

40
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:20,000
I alone carry the full
weight of the Zodiac Curse.

41
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:23,875
So you see... I
do understand.

42
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:27,458
I wonder what it was that
everyone expected of you?

43
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:28,875
Did they really think
you would be able to

44
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:31,583
miraculously
save us, somehow?

45
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:36,250
You deserve
this pain...

46
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,875
But don't think this
will be the end of it...

47
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:50,916
I'm going to
make you regret

48
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,333
you were ever
involved with us...

49
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:57,666
I will make you suffer,
the way we suffer.

50
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,875
[Shigure]
Akito!

51
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:13,041
Awww...

52
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:16,625
Now thanks to you, I'm
completely soaked...

53
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:07,458
Tohru...

54
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,541
I--

55
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,500
I'm sorry...

56
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:27,708
I... I
thought--

57
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,541
No, I knew...

58
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,250
I knew...

59
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:50,083
Tohru...

60
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,916
Let's end
this! End it!

61
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,791
I know... I know
it's painful...

62
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,166
But you
can...

63
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:32,875
[Kagura] Yuki... why
didn't you go after him?

64
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:36,958
Do you... Do you still
hate Kyo that much?

65
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:40,666
I've always hated
him. My entire life.

66
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,541
He's the cat
and I'm the rat.

67
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,750
We were born hating
each other...

68
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,375
That's the way
it's always been,

69
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,541
and that's the way
it'll always be.

70
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:52,291
I wonder... Who decided
it had to be that way?

71
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:02,666
It's sad,
isn't it.

72
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:06,500
And what about you, Kagura?
Aren't you going after him?

73
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:10,833
No, I'm not... I've
made up my mind.

74
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:14,333
Kyo already knows I accept
him, no matter what...

75
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:16,541
and no matter what
form he's in...

76
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,583
I mean, there isn't another
girl in the whole world

77
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:21,583
who loves him as
much as I do...

78
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:26,541
Which is why... I know
that I can't help him...

79
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,875
Right now, the only
one who can help...

80
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:32,541
the person he needs
the most, is Tohru...

81
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:35,916
Kagura...

82
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,416
I'm a member of the
zodiac, the same as him...

83
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,583
so for me to go
to him now...

84
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:45,375
it wouldn't give
him any comfort.

85
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,958
He needs to be accepted
by someone else...

86
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:51,250
Someone who doesn't
share our curse...

87
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:56,958
And so... all I can do is
leave things up to Tohru.

88
00:10:57,041 --> 00:11:02,625
Huh... That's
strange... Huh?--

89
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:09,166
Ah! No, that's not
it... Hmm... Let's see...

90
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,708
Ah... Here it is...

91
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,333
Kyo's
color...

92
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:09,541
The boy didn't
even cry.

93
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:12,208
His mother's
funeral, not a tear...

94
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,708
If only she hadn't given birth
to a child cursed by the Cat...

95
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:17,416
Maybe she'd still be with us...
Maybe she wouldn't have--

96
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:23,333
Shut up! It's not my
fault! It's not my fault!

97
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:28,666
That's right...

98
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,333
I know...

99
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:35,208
It's nice to meet you...
My name is Kazuma Sohma.

100
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:38,500
It's not my fault!
It's not my fault!

101
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,708
It's all
right...

102
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:43,208
It's all
right...

103
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:44,250
I know...

104
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:58,041
Kyo...

105
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,958
If you'd like, why don't
you come live with me?

106
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:07,750
I know I may
not look it,

107
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:10,458
but I am the instructor
of a karate dojo.

108
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:14,375
I'd be happy to teach you,
if you have any interest.

109
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,541
Look,
it's Kyo!

110
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:20,541
So, Kazuma is really
taking him in, huh?

111
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:24,125
That's how it looks... You
know, I'm sure he means well,

112
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:26,041
but still, I feel
sorry for him.

113
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:28,750
And he's still
so young, too!

114
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:32,708
What was he thinking, adopting
a boy cursed by the Cat!

115
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,791
It's all right,
Kyo... From now on,

116
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:54,708
we'll be breathing the air
from a higher place...

117
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:04,250
Say... So, you're
a "master" right?

118
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:06,916
On TV, they said
a karate teacher

119
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,458
was called a
"master"...

120
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:10,291
So that means you're
a master, right?

121
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:15,875
Haha! Well, I suppose that
may be true... But...

122
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:18,750
I've never asked any of my
students to call me that.

123
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:22,583
[Student 1] Ha, ha, ha!
Watch out, Teacher!

124
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:25,416
I'm gonna be as good as
you one of these days!

125
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,708
[Kazuma]
Well, there is no doubt.

126
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:28,583
Both of you have
improved quite a bit.

127
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:29,750
[Student 1]
You really think so?

128
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,708
Thanks, Teacher, you
just made my day!

129
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:33,250
[Student 2]
By the way, Teacher.

130
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:34,958
When do you think we'll have
our next rank advancement test?

131
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,125
Master?

132
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:41,250
Welcome
home... Kyo...

133
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,291
Did you even try to
settle the issue

134
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:47,500
before resorting
to violence?

135
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,666
All he did was make a
comment about your hair.

136
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,250
Your father
is on his way.

137
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:53,875
Although, I'm
forced to wonder

138
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:56,000
how his father
is raising him...

139
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:58,291
Still, I feel
sorry for him.

140
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:01,333
What was he thinking, adopting
a boy cursed by the Cat!

141
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:02,916
...he's not
my dad...

142
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,250
Master, you're not
my dad! You're not!

143
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:06,250
It's all
right...

144
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,166
...a higher
place...

145
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,291
Welcome
home... Kyo...

146
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:33,666
All I wanted, was
to make amends...

147
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:37,583
Like Kyo, my grandfather
was also cursed by the cat...

148
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:40,708
For this, he was
treated as an outcast,

149
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:43,416
alienated by his
entire family.

150
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,125
The pariah of
the Sohma clan.

151
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,291
And
so...

152
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:54,166
I only met my grandfather
one time... By chance.

153
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:01,333
Come over here, Kazuma...
Let me give you some candy.

154
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:06,000
Uh! No way! I don't
wanna be cursed!

155
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:10,208
I said such cruel
words to him...

156
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:12,541
I see...

157
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:15,416
But his kindness was
greater than my own.

158
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,666
He only smiled at me, as
if to say, "I forgive you."

159
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:25,208
Soon after that, my
grandfather passed away.

160
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:26,833
And as I
grew older,

161
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:30,041
I was able to see many of the
things I couldn't as a child.

162
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,250
I began to
understand

163
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:34,041
the torment he had
been forced to endure...

164
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:38,041
The foolishness...
The cruelty...

165
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:41,333
And I could see that, since
my grandfather's time,

166
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:43,125
none of this
had changed.

167
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:47,541
Kyo, If you'd like, why
don't you come live with me?

168
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:51,375
That Kyo was now forced to lead
the same life of suffering...

169
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:53,625
And so, I took him
in, to make amends

170
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:57,625
for my family's cruelty...
Or so I told myself.

171
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:59,166
Though, perhaps what
I really wanted

172
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:02,166
was to ease my own
feelings of guilt.

173
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:06,041
However, over time... as we
passed our days together...

174
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,333
as I watched him beginning
to grow and change...

175
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,416
...Before I even
realized it...

176
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,416
A genuine bond had
formed between us...

177
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,083
And every time I
saw him smile,

178
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:19,083
I could feel that bond
growing stronger...

179
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:22,708
He became dear to me.
I cared for him. I worried.

180
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,333
I wanted him to have all
the happiness in the world...

181
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:28,500
In many ways, I felt as though
I had become his father.

182
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,041
And now... I have
perhaps shown him

183
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:32,041
the greatest
cruelty of all.

184
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,875
I have ignored his feelings
and taken his beads...

185
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:37,916
I've forced him to
endure this torment...

186
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:53,625
You're not my dad!

187
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,125
Kyo...

188
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,000
[Uo] So what's
the deal?

189
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,958
I don't get why this was so
urgent, all of a sudden...

190
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:09,166
I mean, could've just
come here tomorrow.

191
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,250
With Tohru, even...

192
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,083
[Hana] I just...
sense something...

193
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,291
[Uo] You and your
electric waves...

194
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,125
Oh, well,
we're here...

195
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:21,541
Kyoko's gonna be pretty
surprised to see us, huh?

196
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:24,083
I mean, comin' here in the
middle of the night like--

197
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:30,416
Tohru?

198
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:39,666
What are you doing out here?
You're soaked to the bone!

199
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:49,375
Uo... H-
Hana...

200
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,500
Are you okay?
What happened?!

201
00:18:51,583 --> 00:19:00,250
I... I can't go back... I don't
belong there... I never did...

202
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,458
I don't belong
there, with them...

203
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:05,541
in that house...
I don't--

204
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,041
Tohru...? It's
okay. Just tell me--

205
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:10,958
Don't!

206
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:15,875
What the hell
was that for?!

207
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:18,500
You can't comfort
Tohru right now!

208
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:21,916
That's what the electric
signals are telling me!

209
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,125
What are you
talking about?

210
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:36,666
Go... Tohru... there's
somewhere you need to be...

211
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,916
You have to go!

212
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:49,000
I can't...
I just can't!

213
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:56,083
Get up...!
Tohru... GET UP!

214
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:57,375
I can't go...

215
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,458
Stop it, Hana!

216
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:02,125
Tohru...
I'm here...

217
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,791
Damn you...!

218
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:08,375
STAND UP!

219
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,958
Hana!

220
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,500
Let me go!

221
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:14,333
Tohru!

222
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:16,583
Go now! Hurry!

223
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:21,208
There's something
you have to do...

224
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:24,166
You're the only one who
can! You know I'm right...

225
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,375
What the hell does
that mean?! Hana!

226
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:31,083
This isn't something we can
help you with... We can't...!

227
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,875
All we can do, is
tell you to go...!

228
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:39,041
So hurry up!
Go! Go!

229
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:11,041
Tohru...?

230
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,625
Tohru...

231
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:45,500
[Uo] But why...?

232
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:51,000
[Uo] WHY...?!

233
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:32,416
I was so happy
when you smiled,

234
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:36,333
Your smile breaks through
the clouds of grey,

235
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:43,208
Far from the sunny
days that lie in sleep.

236
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:46,333
Waiting with patience
for the Spring,

237
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:50,208
when the flowers will
bloom renewed again

238
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:57,125
<i>knowing there's more</i>
<i>beyond the pain of today.</i>

239
00:23:57,208 --> 00:24:01,375
<i>Although the scars</i>
<i>of yesterday remain...</i>
