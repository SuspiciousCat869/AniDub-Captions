1
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:18,125
<i>I was so happy when you smiled,</i>

2
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:21,708
<i>Your smile breaks</i>
<i>through the clouds of grey,</i>

3
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:28,625
<i>Far from the sunny days</i>
<i>that lie in sleep.</i>

4
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:31,583
<i>Waiting with patience</i>
<i>for the Spring,</i>

5
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:35,583
<i>when the flowers will</i>
<i>bloom renewed again,</i>

6
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:42,625
<i>knowing there's more</i>
<i>beyond the pain of today.</i>

7
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:49,000
<i>Although the scars</i>
<i>of yesterday remain,</i>

8
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:56,458
<i>You can go on living as</i>
<i>much as your heart believes.</i>

9
00:00:56,541 --> 00:01:02,958
<i>You can't be born again</i>
<i>although you can change.</i>

10
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:09,666
<i>Let's stay together always.</i>

11
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:31,125
[Tohru]
So, it's almost May.

12
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:33,208
Some of these should be
ready to pick soon, right?

13
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:35,541
[Yuki] Uh-huh...
I'd say, the carrots,

14
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:37,583
the turnips...
the leeks.

15
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:44,291
Oh, and the
strawberries.

16
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:48,125
Oh! The strawberries are
almost ready? I can't wait!

17
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:50,166
Yes... they should
be delicious.

18
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:52,625
Are you okay?

19
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:54,375
I'm fine... I guess it's
just a little chillier

20
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:56,333
out here than
I expected.

21
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,708
In that case...
We're almost done here...

22
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:00,208
Why don't you go on
back to the house?

23
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:02,416
Oh... are
you sure...?

24
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:05,291
Well, I'm
hungry, too...

25
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:08,750
Okay, when you
put it like that--!

26
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:12,125
I'll go back and make
us something to eat.

27
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:14,583
[Tohru] It's only
been a few days

28
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:18,875
since our unexpected meeting
with Akito at school...

29
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:23,041
But, already, Yuki seems to be
in a much more cheerful mood...

30
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:26,208
I'm so glad...

31
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:30,541
Now then... What
should I make for...

32
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,583
lunch?

33
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:42,208
Could this be someone...
from the Zodiac?!

34
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:52,333
Miss Honda!

35
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:53,833
Th-there's...

36
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:55,208
What?!

37
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:57,083
There's something
under my clothes!

38
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,750
Ah, dammit,
I'm hungry!

39
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:09,541
Tohru should be back soon...
Try being patient for once.

40
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,875
Forget it! I'll just
make something myself.

41
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,916
Hold on, Kyo... I
have a better idea.

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,416
You can snack on
these to tie you over

43
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,666
until Tohru
gets home...

44
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:21,291
Are you crazy?! You know
damn well I hate miso!

45
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:22,583
You know...
You really shouldn't

46
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:25,083
waste food like
that... Terrible...

47
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:30,416
There, you see?
Here they are... now...

48
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:35,833
You want lunch? Here.
Skin this and eat it.

49
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:38,000
Uh... is that Aya?

50
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:41,125
It is! But... what
is he doing here?

51
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:43,250
Never mind! Just skin
this thing and eat it!

52
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:48,125
Hold on... I think you
need to calm down, Yuki...

53
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:49,500
[Shigure] That
was Ayame Sohma.

54
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:51,791
And as I'm sure you
noticed, he's the snake.

55
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:54,791
[Tohru]
Ayame... oh!

56
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,791
We'll let him
sleep for a while.

57
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,916
Snakes naturally
hibernate in the winter...

58
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,375
I imagine that's part
of the reason Aya

59
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,500
has always been
sensitive to the cold.

60
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:03,708
If he's
not careful,

61
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,250
it can cause him to
transform like this...

62
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,541
Aya, Hatori, and I
grew up together.

63
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,250
We were in the same class
through grade school,

64
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,208
middle school,
and high school!

65
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:13,083
We were inseparable.
So much so,

66
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,208
people called us the
"Three Musketeers".

67
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:17,375
Oh! Wow! Did
they really?!

68
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,250
More like the "Three
Idiots" if you ask me.

69
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,458
How did Hatori put up
with you for so long?

70
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:25,041
So... What did Aya do to
upset you so much, Yuki?

71
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:27,375
I won't even say it,
it's so disgusting...

72
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,708
[Aya] Come now,
it wasn't so bad!

73
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:30,833
You could show a
little more forgiveness

74
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:32,458
to your own
brother...

75
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:34,750
Eh?

76
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,833
Did...
he say 'brother'?

77
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:43,625
Allow me to explain
what happened.

78
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,083
I was on my way here,

79
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:48,458
when a sudden chill in the
air caused me to transform.

80
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:51,708
In my search for heat, I sensed
a warm body drawing near,

81
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,125
and I naturally
clung to it!

82
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:57,583
I suppose you could
say it was- instinct.

83
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:01,500
Greetings,
everyone!

84
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:04,125
And how have you
been... little brother?

85
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,791
He's like a
grown-up Yuki!

86
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,291
If we all followed
our instincts...

87
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,541
I would have snapped you in
two when I had the chance!

88
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:12,333
What's the big deal? What
exactly did he do to you?

89
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:14,208
Oh! Well, you
see, he uh...

90
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,916
Oh... Lucky Kyo. I'd heard
you were staying here.

91
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,083
I told you before!
Stop calling me that!

92
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,750
Lucky Kyo. You
haven't changed.

93
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:21,833
I said stop!

94
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:24,166
It been too
long, Shigure...

95
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,875
Yes, since
New Years'.

96
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,291
What a shame.

97
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:29,375
You haven't
forgotten about me

98
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:31,875
while we were been
apart... have you?

99
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:36,291
Not a day has gone by that you
haven't been on my mind... Aya.

100
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:37,000
Yes!

101
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:39,208
No, no, no!

102
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:40,666
[Tohru] Um... I'm starting
to get the feeling

103
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:44,125
Ayame's personality is very
different from Yuki's...

104
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:47,333
By the way, this is the
one and only Tohru Honda!

105
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:48,583
You came to see
her today, right?

106
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:52,250
Oh, yes
that's right!

107
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:54,375
I'm sorry
about earlier...

108
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:57,208
I am Yuki's older
brother... Ayame...

109
00:05:57,291 --> 00:06:00,458
Oh, right! Pleased
to meet you!

110
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:02,125
So, you really
do exist...

111
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:04,958
The princess I've...
heard so much about.

112
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,041
A single
blooming flower

113
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,333
trapped in a house
of stinking men!

114
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:12,208
Are they treating
you well, princess?

115
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:14,208
You make it sound like
she's been kidnapped...

116
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:17,333
Brother... You're being
rude. Stop making fun of her.

117
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:18,750
Making fun?

118
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:21,416
Honestly. I mean Tohru nothing
but the highest respect!

119
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,541
So, princess, why don't
you bring us some tea?

120
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:25,083
And lunch
would be nice.

121
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:26,791
That's not
respect!

122
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,416
Of course,
you're right...

123
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,375
What was I thinking?
Let me try again.

124
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:32,458
Come Tohru...

125
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,000
...We're going
out to eat!

126
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:35,458
Uh... but... I
don't know...!

127
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,291
Don't worry!
It's my treat!

128
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:44,500
Now, there's no use
getting angry at me...

129
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:47,666
Very good. Feel free to
order anything you like.

130
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,375
Although, I'd highly recommend
the potsticker plate.

131
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:54,875
Don't worry about Yuki and the
others... They're big boys.

132
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,875
I do think they can manage
something on their own...

133
00:06:56,958 --> 00:07:00,250
But, still I--I'm not
sure I should've come...

134
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,541
Well, I hope you
won't deny me

135
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:03,791
the pleasure of treating
you to lunch...

136
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:06,541
Oh, no! I'm sorry! I didn't
mean to sound ungrateful!

137
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:10,041
Good. Then it's settled...
Waiter! Two potsticker plates!

138
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:10,916
Coming right up!

139
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,416
I'm just being
swept away!

140
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,958
I have to
tell you...

141
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:17,666
It's been one surprise after
another, meeting you today...

142
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,208
Yuki's never
mentioned you before,

143
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:21,166
let alone that you're
part of the zodiac...

144
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,541
I suppose that shouldn't
come as news to me...

145
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:27,083
As you know, Yuki and I don't
get along very well. Or rather,

146
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:29,083
I should say we've never
really been very close...

147
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:30,666
You see, we're
ten years apart...

148
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,583
And when Yuki was born...
he got sick fairly easily,

149
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:37,125
so he was kept separated,
much of the time...

150
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,875
Separated?

151
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:42,041
I, on the other hand, grew
up doing whatever I liked.

152
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:43,416
Because of our
separation,

153
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,208
I was only vaguely aware
that I even had a brother...

154
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:49,500
By the time I realized it, a
deep gap had formed between us,

155
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,875
that we have never
been able to bridge.

156
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:54,958
That is our story.

157
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:59,000
I was told... Yuki saw Akito
at school the other day...

158
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,458
You met him
too, I think?

159
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:01,833
How do I
put this...?

160
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:04,416
I've never had much
interaction with him myself...

161
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,375
but for Yuki, Akito is
a source of great fear...

162
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:11,333
Even now, at his age, I'm not
sure that fear has subsided...

163
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:13,750
And so... while I did
want to meet you today,

164
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,000
more than
that...

165
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:17,541
I wanted to make sure
Yuki was all right...

166
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,875
I'm glad to see he's
doing well, but...

167
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:23,166
I was hoping I'd have a chance
to play the big brother.

168
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,541
Do you still
hope that?

169
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,666
Maybe he's trying
to close the gap...

170
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,375
It's odd in a way...
The more the years go by,

171
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:32,708
the more I come to
understand things

172
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:35,458
I didn't understand
when I was a child...

173
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,875
I think, "When that happened,
I should have done this,"

174
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:40,208
or "When that happened,
I should have said this..."

175
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:41,625
That sort
of thing...

176
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,500
Only now have I begun
to realize all the ways

177
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,500
I could have been a
better brother then...

178
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,791
And I confess, I feel a
certain amount of regret

179
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,625
that things are the
way they are...

180
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:50,791
I wish I could
go back,

181
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:53,833
and correct the mistakes
I made as a child.

182
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:57,458
But I suppose every adult
wishes that to some degree.

183
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,708
You know, my Mom...

184
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:03,416
My Mom told me one time...
When she first became a parent,

185
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:07,125
she finally understood
how it felt to be an adult.

186
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,708
But still...

187
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:11,875
As important as that was,

188
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:14,083
she said she never
wanted to forget...

189
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:15,958
She always wanted
to remember...

190
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:18,291
how it felt
to be a child.

191
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,500
Like, the first time you turned
a flip on the monkey bars,

192
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,875
or the first time
something upset you...

193
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,875
She said, if you can
remember those feelings,

194
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:28,541
then when you become an adult
and have children of your own,

195
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:31,500
you'll be able to understand
each other much better.

196
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:35,458
And even when you don't agree,
you can still meet half-way...

197
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:40,541
Besides... It's just more fun
to think that way, you know?

198
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,791
I'm sorry! I'm supposed to
be talking about you and Yuki!

199
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,416
I guess I got a little
sidetracked there.

200
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,041
Oh, I know I
had a point--

201
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:57,416
Maybe you and Yuki can try
to meet each other half-way!

202
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,458
Okay, here
you go!

203
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,375
[Tohru] I guess that
doesn't make any sense...

204
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:05,708
[Aya]
No, it does...

205
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:08,125
Some people say the
greatest things, don't they?

206
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,791
Uh-huh! Mom was the
best in the universe!

207
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:15,833
Um... Actually, I was talking
about you... but either way...

208
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,791
I think... I
understand now...

209
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:21,541
Why it is my brother's
doing so well lately...

210
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:25,291
Listen... As far
as Yuki goes...

211
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:29,625
I promise I'll keep
trying... And you...

212
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:32,333
I hope you'll continue to be
there for him when I can't...

213
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:38,375
What's this? The look
on Ayame's face...

214
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:41,375
Oh, Miss Honda!
You okay?

215
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:44,000
Uh-huh... Did everyone
get something to eat?

216
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:47,125
Never mind about that. Did my
brother give you any trouble?

217
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:50,875
Oh, no! Not at all! He
bought me a potsticker plate!

218
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:51,916
Um...
Yuki?

219
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:58,166
I was wondering... Well, do you
really not like your brother?

220
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,041
I mean, I know it's not
really any of my business...

221
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:02,458
I was just
curious...

222
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:05,125
I wouldn't say
I... dislike him...

223
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:07,916
He's just a little too
much for me sometimes...

224
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,041
Well, if that's all,
we can overcome it!

225
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:14,500
I will do all in my power
to meet you half-way...!

226
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,166
...my brother!

227
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:20,541
Uh... you see... it got
really cold on the way

228
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:21,833
home from
the restaurant,

229
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:23,291
and he
transformed!

230
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,791
And he said that if snakes
get too cold, they can die!

231
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,500
Well I am
a snake.

232
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:30,125
You may be a snake, but
you're no brother of mine!

233
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:33,750
You can't change
the truth, Yuki!

234
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:37,625
[Shigure] Ah, welcome
back, you two.

235
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,916
[Tohru] But Yuki, if
you could have seen

236
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,958
the look on his face
at the restaurant...

237
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:47,000
you'd know that Ayame
truly cares about you.

238
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,375
Shigure... Have you
picked out a place

239
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,041
for me to
sleep tonight?

240
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,750
Oh? You're
staying over?

241
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:18,250
Hush. I'm
still sleeping.

242
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:19,583
Get off
of me!

243
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,958
I'm sorry, but I
had no other choice.

244
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:27,416
Yuki locked the
door to his room,

245
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,208
so I couldn't
sleep in there.

246
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,125
Why the hell didn't you
go to Shigure's room?

247
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,708
Like yesterday?!

248
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:36,000
Because... if I had... Shigure
would've kept me up all night.

249
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,458
Aya... not in front of
the children, please.

250
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:39,791
Oh, cut
it out!

251
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,875
Just ignore them...
ignore them...

252
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:43,875
Don't worry... If it
bothers you that much,

253
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,958
tonight I'll sleep
in Tohru's room.

254
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:48,458
You will not!

255
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:49,708
[Tohru] It's the morning
of the third day

256
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,500
since Ayame
came to visit...

257
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,541
But, unfortunately,
it seems like the gap

258
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:58,041
between him and Yuki
has only grown wider...

259
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:02,833
Really! Aya's there? I haven't
seen him since New Year's!

260
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,166
[Tohru] For three
days now...

261
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,791
[Momiji] Maybe
I'll go visit him!

262
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,208
Oh... Then again,

263
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:09,500
he probably just wants to
spend some time with Yuki.

264
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:11,333
Which reminds
me... How is Yuki?

265
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,041
Uh...
well...

266
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,916
Yuki...

267
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,375
What...
Is he sick?

268
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:23,541
Well...
not exactly.

269
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,333
Don't worry.
I get it...

270
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,541
Yeah... Uh-huh...
Figures...

271
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:30,500
Hey, Haru... Is it weird
for Aya to leave his shop?

272
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:31,750
I mean, he is
the owner...

273
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:35,041
Oh? So you mean Ayame
runs his own business?

274
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,208
That's right...

275
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,000
He sells outfits
for nurses, stewardesses,

276
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,750
maids, things
like that...

277
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:45,208
So then, he
makes... uniforms?

278
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,958
Well, uh...
not exactly.

279
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:51,041
Aya says he makes
fantasies come true!

280
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,250
My, my! This
is unexpected!

281
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,125
Dammit...

282
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,375
He's here...

283
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:57,166
Welcome back!

284
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,708
But how nice! You boys
wanted to see me so badly

285
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,791
you came straight
home from school...

286
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:02,500
And here
I thought

287
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:03,708
Tohru and I

288
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:05,125
would have the whole
afternoon to ourselves!

289
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,875
That's what we
were afraid of!

290
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,208
What is that you
were looking at?

291
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:13,916
Oh, just some old albums of us
in our high-school days... See?

292
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,250
There's
Hatori, too...

293
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:20,875
I don't believe it! Shigure
and Hatori both look so young!

294
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:24,458
And Ayame-- he looked
exactly like Yuki does now!

295
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:25,916
Pretty cute,
weren't we?

296
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,916
[Tohru] Uh-huh! So Ayame,
you wore your hair long,

297
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,750
even when you were
in high-school?

298
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:33,500
That's right... Of course,
I had to bend a few rules...

299
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,875
Here, Yuki... You
come look, too...

300
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:37,791
Now's your chance
to learn something

301
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,375
new about
your brother!

302
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:40,708
I'll pass,
thank you.

303
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:43,708
Then, you leave
me no choice...

304
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:45,500
I'll simply have to tell
you the whole story

305
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,750
of how I got to keep my
long hair at school...

306
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,333
What for?!

307
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:52,583
See... it was the very start of
my first year in high school,

308
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,791
You like hearin'
yourself talk, dontcha?

309
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,041
I allowed
the color,

310
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:58,041
but I didn't allow you
to wear your hair long.

311
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,416
Have it cut
by tomorrow.

312
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:04,500
I'm sorry, sir... but...
I come from a royal family.

313
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:05,875
I've kept it
secret until now,

314
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:08,500
but soon I must return
to my own country.

315
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:10,666
And it is our age-old
custom that members

316
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,125
of the royal family should
always wear their hair long,

317
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:14,916
in honor of the
high king Rurubara,

318
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,791
who, it is said, during the
fourth year of his reign,

319
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:19,625
was visited by a divine
image -It was Kandra,

320
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,875
shimmering with heavenly
light of red and gold!

321
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:24,541
Kandra began to chant,
"Ma Rudu Muni!"

322
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,833
And a blue light burst
forth from his forehead.

323
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,583
At this moment, Rurubara's
true spirit was set free!

324
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,958
And just as the vast springs
of strength and wisdom

325
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:33,458
were swelling
within him,

326
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:36,666
so too did his hair begin to
sprout forth from his head!

327
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:40,166
At this same moment,
the prince Kasipaloo,

328
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,791
who had been sleeping
securely in his bed,

329
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,750
let out a
mighty cry.

330
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:44,916
"Kanpanil!"
he shouted,

331
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,291
Uh, excuse me,
I just remembered,

332
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,083
I'm very late for
an important meeting.

333
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:49,583
I have
to go.

334
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,416
But I still have more
to tell you about Kandra.

335
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,333
No! It's fine!
Your hair is fine!

336
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:57,958
And that's how I convinced him
to let me wear my hair long.

337
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,041
Y- you're a member
of a royal family!?

338
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,125
Duh, he was
lying! Come on!

339
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:04,041
Those were
the days...

340
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:05,375
Idiots...

341
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:07,333
And here's something else
I bet you didn't know:

342
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:09,250
Aya... was Student
Council President!

343
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,041
Was he
really?!

344
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,583
Stop fooling
around. Let's go.

345
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,666
He was a natural
choice, I suppose.

346
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,416
What with the way he looked
and the way he acted,

347
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,208
he was really very popular
with the other boys.

348
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:25,458
And under
his term,

349
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:27,666
many of the old school
rules were... relaxed.

350
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,541
You certainly had
a way about you...

351
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:30,666
I don't know...

352
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,291
I always thought
Ha'ri would have made

353
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,708
a much better
president than me.

354
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:35,958
Do you
remember?

355
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:38,041
The time we all went on
that class field trip?

356
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:40,083
Of course! How
could I forget?

357
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,833
So... what
happened?

358
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,750
I don't
believe it!

359
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:48,541
It sounds like Yuki's actually
taking an interest! Ayame!

360
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,000
This is your chance!

361
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,333
This is your chance to
finally bridge the gap!

362
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:54,000
Yes... well,
you see...

363
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:56,458
there was a group of
students during this trip...

364
00:16:56,541 --> 00:17:00,583
who, we'll say... wandered
into the 'red-light district.

365
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:05,541
Please, reserve your judgment
until I've explained.

366
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:06,875
Although it would
have been difficult

367
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:09,916
for any healthy young man
to resist this place,

368
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,750
we weren't actually
the ones who went.

369
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:14,250
Of course, it's not like
we hadn't seen it before.

370
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,458
Idiot...

371
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,000
I can't believe he just
said that out loud.

372
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:18,416
As it
happened...

373
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,625
One of
the teachers

374
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,875
found out where they'd
gone... And then...!

375
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,166
It was decided that
all of the boys

376
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,041
were to be expelled
from school.

377
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:28,041
Naturally, as Student Council
President, I objected!

378
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:30,625
A meeting was called between
the students, their parents,

379
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:34,916
the principal, and the
teachers involved...

380
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,208
For a group of minors to set
foot in a red-light district--

381
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,583
this is by no means
an act to be praised.

382
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,416
Laws are put in
place to be obeyed...

383
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,625
Otherwise...
we lose order.

384
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,041
And with that
being said...

385
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:48,375
I must also express my
concern over what I see

386
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:51,166
as a condemnation of our
natural human instincts!

387
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,000
I submit that the desires
which led these boys astray

388
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:56,583
were fueled by perhaps the
most noble of human instincts-

389
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:58,916
the instinct to
procreate the species!

390
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,166
Should we damn them for
feeling these natural urges?

391
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,375
President...

392
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,458
Ayame. You're being
unusually serious today.

393
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,083
Yes. Quite a departure
from your normal antics.

394
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,666
At this time, I would like
to offer you a proposal!

395
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,666
Let us offer a hand of rescue
to these wayward youths.

396
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,916
Let us help them
to understand

397
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,375
their sometimes confusing
natural desires...

398
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:17,541
From now on...!

399
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:20,208
They may direct their
desire toward me!

400
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:22,708
As a chosen representative
of this student body,

401
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:23,958
it is only fitting
that this heavy burden

402
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,500
should fall on
my shoulders.

403
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:28,000
And furthermore... Since
we will all be boys,

404
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:30,125
parents and teachers will
have nothing to fear!

405
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,041
So send me
your desire!

406
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,208
In the service of
my fellow students,

407
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:35,166
I am prepared
to receive!

408
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,166
He's gone mad!

409
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:36,875
Insane!

410
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:39,166
Get him
out of here!

411
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,125
Don't worry. Despite how it
looks, I know what I'm doing.

412
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:44,000
Thus concludes my
wonderful story!

413
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,041
You mean
stupid!

414
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,583
Excuse me! But
because of that,

415
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,708
everyone avoided
being expelled.

416
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:49,791
How so?

417
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,291
Well, after that,
Hatori stepped in

418
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:52,833
and said a
few words...

419
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:55,166
But Aya was our president
until the very end!

420
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,041
You're
kidding!

421
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:57,416
What do you
think Yuki?

422
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,500
Has this helped you understand
your older brother?

423
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:00,666
I think you
should leave.

424
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:01,833
Oh no! The gap!

425
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:03,958
Well, I'll have
to do better...

426
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:06,208
Let me tell you about the time
I kidnapped the school mascot!

427
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:07,875
No, I really think
you should leave.

428
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:09,291
It all started one
spring morning...

429
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:10,791
Shigure! Get
rid of him!

430
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,041
But why?
This is fun!

431
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:12,916
Yes,
it's fun!

432
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,291
You're killin'
me here!

433
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:18,083
Even so, I really don't
think he'll listen to me...

434
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:19,583
The only person he
does listen to is--

435
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:20,916
Hey.

436
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,166
The door was unlocked,
so I let myself in.

437
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,583
Oh! Hi
Hatori!

438
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:25,708
Speak of
the devil!

439
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,750
Ha'ri! To what do
we owe the pleasure?

440
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:31,208
Hatsuharu... He said I
should come take you home.

441
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:38,250
So, what do you say you wrap
things up here... And we'll go.

442
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,291
Well then,
bye-bye.

443
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:41,458
I guess with all
the commotion,

444
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:43,458
you and I didn't
get to talk much.

445
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:45,708
Weren't you the one
causing the commotion?

446
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,125
You'll see me again,
little brother.

447
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:49,083
All right, Ha'ri.
Ready when you are...

448
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:50,458
Until next
time, Shigure!

449
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:53,833
Mmm! Now it's my
turn to visit you!

450
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:56,500
Farewell,
everyone!

451
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:57,666
So, are
we walking?

452
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:58,833
[Hari] I brought
the car.

453
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,166
[Aya] Good!
Can I drive?

454
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,958
[Hari] No.

455
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:05,833
What... was
that all about?

456
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:07,333
[Shigure] As long
as I remember,

457
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:09,666
Ha'ri's been the only one who
can tell Aya what to do...

458
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,333
Aya really
admires him...

459
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,375
He sees a lot of good
qualities in Hatori

460
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,875
that he's always
wished he had himself.

461
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:17,500
But since he
doesn't...

462
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,208
He figures staying close to
Ha'ri is the next best thing.

463
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:21,250
He actually told
me that once.

464
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,958
And with a straight
face, no less.

465
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:25,583
Anyway, letting Ha'ri
boss him around

466
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:28,458
is just one way Aya
shows his admiration.

467
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:34,000
I'm sorry about this-- putting
you to all this trouble.

468
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:35,208
If that's the
way you feel,

469
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:37,083
maybe you should
think before you act.

470
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:38,750
I did think.

471
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:39,958
I thought I'd be
able to get Yuki

472
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,541
to open up to me
a little bit...

473
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,416
I wouldn't let it
bother you just yet.

474
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,541
Yuki is still
very young...

475
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:48,166
Give him some time to figure
things out on his own.

476
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,583
There's no
need to rush.

477
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,750
You know, in a way...
Tohru reminded me of you.

478
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,541
She's very good
about considering

479
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:57,250
other people's
feelings.

480
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:02,166
At least, she's much
better at it than I am.

481
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,708
And like you...

482
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:07,500
...she has a way of telling me
exactly what I need to hear.

483
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:12,250
I really liked listening
to Ayame's stories...

484
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,166
That man needs
some serious help.

485
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,458
The gap!

486
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,458
Um, I don't know, I
mean, I thought he was--

487
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:18,458
Although...

488
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:22,541
The way he's not afraid
to show his admiration...

489
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,250
You know, when he sees
qualities he'd like to have

490
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:27,833
in other people...
That's... That's good.

491
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:29,541
[Mrs. Honda] You might
not always agree,

492
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:32,291
but you can always
meet half-way.

493
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:38,291
[Yuki] Haru...

494
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:42,458
Listen... I... I
just want to say

495
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:46,250
thank you for
worrying about me.

496
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,041
[Mrs. Honda] Besides...
It's just more fun

497
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:51,083
to think that
way, you know?

498
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:53,041
Oh, you
know what?

499
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:54,750
I never did find out
what kind of shop it is

500
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:57,375
that sells outfits
for nurses and maids!

501
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:58,375
What're you
talkin' about?

502
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,583
She means a
lingerie store.

503
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:06,916
<i>Now let's all gather,</i>

504
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,500
<i>Enjoying the company we share,</i>

505
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:17,791
<i>Our tears will dissolve</i>
<i>into thin air,</i>

506
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:23,750
<i>As we drink up</i>
<i>this wonderful life.</i>

507
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:28,708
<i>La, la, la...</i>

508
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:34,791
<i>Takin' in all the</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

509
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:39,875
<i>La, la, la...</i>

510
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:45,916
<i>Drinkin' up all this</i>
<i>good love and life.</i>

511
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
<i>La, la, la...</i>

512
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:56,791
<i>Take it in all this</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

513
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:26,708
What is it? Spending some
time with your friends?

514
00:23:26,791 --> 00:23:29,166
Yeah, it's the first
anniversary of Mom's death,

515
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,666
so we're going
to her grave.

516
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,416
Would it be alright
if I came along?

517
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,375
Hey, if your going to the
grave then I'm going to!

518
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:37,000
Why are you
telling me?

519
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:38,416
What are
you drawing!?

520
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,083
I really have found a
wonderful home here.

521
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:43,916
Living in this house
together with all of them.

522
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,041
And I'm so greatful for
every day I've had here.

523
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:50,208
So Mom, I just
want you to know...

524
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:52,791
that while your up
there watching over me

525
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:54,916
you don't have
to worry anymore...

526
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,291
I'm home.
