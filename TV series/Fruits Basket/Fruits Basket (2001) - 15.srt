1
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:18,125
<i>I was so happy when you smiled,</i>

2
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:21,708
<i>Your smile breaks</i>
<i>through the clouds of grey,</i>

3
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:28,625
<i>Far from the sunny days</i>
<i>that lie in sleep.</i>

4
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:31,583
<i>Waiting with patience</i>
<i>for the Spring,</i>

5
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:35,583
<i>when the flowers will</i>
<i>bloom renewed again,</i>

6
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:42,625
<i>knowing there's more</i>
<i>beyond the pain of today.</i>

7
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:49,000
<i>Although the scars</i>
<i>of yesterday remain,</i>

8
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:56,458
<i>You can go on living as</i>
<i>much as your heart believes.</i>

9
00:00:56,541 --> 00:01:02,958
<i>You can't be born again</i>
<i>although you can change.</i>

10
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:09,666
<i>Let's stay together always.</i>

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,375
[Tohru]
Um, Shigure?

12
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:35,541
I was wondering. Well, May
1st is coming up, and...

13
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:37,750
would you mind if I
went out that afternoon?

14
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:39,041
Of course
not. In fact,

15
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:41,458
I think I'm going out
that afternoon, too...

16
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:43,541
What is it? Spending some
time with your friends?

17
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:46,041
Yeah... it's the first
anniversary of Mom's death,

18
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:47,375
so we're going
to her grave.

19
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:55,625
Ahh... the first anniversary
of your mother's death.

20
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:57,583
Uh huh... So, we thought
it might be nice

21
00:01:57,666 --> 00:01:59,666
to pay her a
little visit.

22
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,416
I'm sorry I
can't join you...

23
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,416
Uh? Oh, no, really
that's okay...

24
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,166
[Yuki]
Miss Honda?

25
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,000
Would it be all right
if I came along?

26
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:10,750
Uh... Oh-- you
don't have to...

27
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:14,583
Really, I want to... I'd like
to say hello to your mother.

28
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:19,583
Ah, thanks, it means a lot...
I know it will to Mom, too.

29
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:22,166
Say, Kyo... If you're not
doing anything that day,

30
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,833
you should think about
going with them...

31
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:29,333
Ahh... so the Prince is
coming with us... And Kyo?

32
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:31,375
Well, I don't know...
But I don't think so.

33
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:33,000
He didn't
say he was.

34
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:35,750
You know... it's too bad your
mom never got to meet that boy.

35
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:37,875
She woulda' had so much
fun giving him a hard time.

36
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,666
Hey, it's
an orange!

37
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,166
Dammit,
cut it out!

38
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,500
And I can
see it now.

39
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:45,125
After Kyo was so angry
he couldn't even speak,

40
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,166
she would grab him, and
give him a hug so tight

41
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,416
that his spine would
snap in two...

42
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,708
That would be terrible!
Well-- for lots of reasons!

43
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:56,750
Strange... it's been
an entire year...

44
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:59,416
and still, it's hard
to believe she's gone.

45
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,708
Yeah, I mean I still
keep expecting her

46
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:03,291
to just show
up one day.

47
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:04,625
You know, just all
of a sudden, going

48
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:09,250
"Hi! Sorry, sorry!" With
that big smile of hers...

49
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,458
Ahh, what am
I saying?

50
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,375
That's sure not helping
anything, is it?

51
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,833
Anyway... it only goes
to show just how great

52
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:19,375
I thought
she was...

53
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:22,333
The legendary Red Butterfly,
terror of the highway!

54
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:24,666
I will always treasure
that image of her,

55
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,875
on her lightning-fast
bike, 'popping wheelies'...

56
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,208
A 'popping wheelie'
is an 18-wheeler

57
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:30,833
with an
oversized belly!

58
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:33,125
No it's not!

59
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:36,541
Well, I hope everyone decides
to come... That'd be good.

60
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:40,250
Yes, it
would.

61
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:58,250
Hey, if you're goin' to the
grave, then I'm goin' too!

62
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:01,916
Why are you
telling me?

63
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,666
Shut up! I'm going,
and that's final!

64
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:13,416
What are you
drawing?!

65
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,166
[Kyo] Sorta' small,
for a temple.

66
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,833
It's nice, isn't it? Just
a quiet little place.

67
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,041
It's kind of
like home...

68
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:22,833
That's a weird thing
to say, but all right...

69
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,666
Oh! Did that sound weird?
What I meant was--

70
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,041
Forget I
said anything.

71
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:27,750
[Yuki]
You know...

72
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,875
I'm glad to see we have
such a nice day today.

73
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,625
I'd say we're
pretty fortunate,

74
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,416
as bad as the
weather's been lately.

75
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,041
[Tohru] Yeah... it's like
Mom's smiling down on us...

76
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:39,375
After all... She has
a lot to smile about.

77
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:42,041
The two of you are
coming to visit.

78
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,791
[Uo] Tohru!

79
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,958
Hey! Great day for
visiting a grave, huh?!

80
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,583
Yes!

81
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,416
[Kyo] What the hell
are you wearing?

82
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,583
What do
you mean?

83
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:06,208
We're wearing black.
What did you expect?

84
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:07,416
Not that!

85
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,708
Miss Uotani... that
outfit you're wearing...

86
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:12,208
well, is that
a... trenchcoat?

87
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:14,375
Hm? Yeah, pretty
sharp huh?

88
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:17,000
I inherited this from
Kyoko, back in the day.

89
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,291
You are
looking at

90
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,291
the legendary "Red
Butterfly's" riding jacket!

91
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,583
Uh... "Red
Butterfly"?

92
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:25,500
That's what they used to call
Mom when she was in her gang!

93
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:28,208
In her gang? And
that's a good thing?

94
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:33,583
All right! Everybody's here!
Let's get this party started!

95
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,708
[Both] They're... they're
actually having fun...

96
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,291
That's
weird.

97
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:40,791
It's already
been cleaned up.

98
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:42,875
Guess somebody got
here before us.

99
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:44,916
It must've
been Grandfather!

100
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,666
He's the only other
person I can think of

101
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,416
who knows Mom's
favorite food!

102
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,416
[Kyo] Your
grandfather?

103
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,750
Yoo-hoooo!

104
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:51,916
Oh yeah, him.

105
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,166
[Tohru]
Uh-huh!

106
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,416
Which side of the family
did you say he was from?

107
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,375
Oh uh, he's my grandfather
on my father's side.

108
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:00,666
Yeah, Kyoko
and her parents

109
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:04,041
weren't exactly on
speaking terms...

110
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:07,500
Your father...
how did he...

111
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:10,041
He got sick, and just
couldn't get better...

112
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:11,875
That's what
Mom told me...

113
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:14,208
I was so
small then...

114
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:17,208
I don't really remember
too much about him...

115
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,833
Hello, Mom... I
came to see you.

116
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,541
We all came.

117
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:26,291
I guess your grandfather
already did all the cleaning,

118
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,583
but we can still put
these flowers up, huh?

119
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:30,375
Uh-huh.

120
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,458
Her father died... And
then she lost her mother...

121
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,958
So, how
is it she--

122
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:43,125
...how is it, after all
the tragedies in her life,

123
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:46,791
she's still able to
smile like she does?

124
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:49,083
I remember the day
of the accident...

125
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:52,916
One of the teachers came and
called her out of class...

126
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,083
They talked in the
door for a minute...

127
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:57,708
and then they
ran out...

128
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,500
Her two friends went
running after her.

129
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:05,416
For a little while, everyone
in class was silent.

130
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,958
I remember thinking
at the time...

131
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,458
"Maybe someone in her
family's been hurt"...

132
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:13,833
...but it was just
a passing thought.

133
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:18,541
Back then, I barely
even realized she existed.

134
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:21,583
She was just one of
the girls in class.

135
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:25,083
The one called
"Tohru Honda".

136
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:27,000
How could I have
known that one day,

137
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:29,708
we would be living
in the same house...

138
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,166
that we'd get to know one
another like we have...

139
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,333
[Tohru] Yuki!
Did you see?

140
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:36,708
Aren't these
pretty flowers?

141
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,375
Or that, whenever
she smiled, somehow,

142
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,875
I'd find myself
smiling with her...

143
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,166
[Tohru] Okay,
it's all ready!

144
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,750
Tohru! This
is wonderful!

145
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,708
You can't have a
picnic on a grave!

146
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,750
Huh? What's
the big deal?

147
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:09,958
C'mon, Kyoko
will like it

148
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,583
if we make a little
noise before we leave!

149
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,541
So what if the temple
people see you?

150
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,583
So what if
they do?

151
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,833
This isn't
exactly... normal.

152
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:19,958
[Uo] Look, just quit
complaining and sit down.

153
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,916
You don't expect to eat
standing up, do you?

154
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,166
That's not good
for you, you know.

155
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,166
[Tohru] Kyo, do you want
me to make you a plate?

156
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,166
[Kyo] Whatever...

157
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,250
[Tohru] Okay!

158
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,625
So, Miss Uotani, I
get the impression

159
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,875
you were close with
Miss Honda's mother?

160
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:32,875
Oh yeah, she was
a great friend...

161
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,041
But you know,
she was my idol

162
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,875
way before we ever
met. She was a legend.

163
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,416
What do you
mean, a legend?

164
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,000
[Uo] Like I said! The
legendary "Red Butterfly"!

165
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:43,000
[Kyo] Like I said! What're
you talkin' about?!

166
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,958
This is
delicious...

167
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,375
See, they say whenever
Kyoko rode her bike,

168
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:48,416
all you'd see were
her taillights

169
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,333
just flash
right by you,

170
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:52,458
like a red butterfly
tearing ass into the night!

171
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:54,291
[Kyo] How do taillights
look like a butterfly?

172
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:56,208
[Uo] What?! You
gotta' be kidding!

173
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:57,375
Don't you have
any imagination

174
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:58,750
in that big orange
head of yours?

175
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,750
[Kyo] Shut up! I don't have
to take that from you!

176
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,416
[Uo] Oh, is that a
fact, Orange Top?!

177
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,041
[Kyo] Rrrrrrrrgh!

178
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,333
I can see it... How
hard she's been trying.

179
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,333
The fact that Tohru can smile
like this after only a year...

180
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,708
I can only imagine the
effort it must have taken

181
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:26,208
for her to lift
herself up

182
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,208
under the weight
of her grief...

183
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:32,458
I... I don't think... If
someone close to me died,

184
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:35,083
as close as Tohru
was to her mother...

185
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:37,333
I don't think I would be
able to find the strength

186
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:40,625
to smile again
so soon...

187
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:44,750
For example, if something were
to happen to Tohru tomorrow,

188
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:47,166
the pain would be so
unbearable that I wonder if

189
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,583
I might begin to wish that
I had never even met her,

190
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,250
if it might be
easier to forget...

191
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,916
Sweet Tohru...

192
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:03,750
...you have
tried so hard.

193
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:08,041
But even so... I'm gonna
guess that smile of hers

194
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:11,625
has at least something
to do with those two...

195
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,250
I mean just
look at 'em...

196
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:15,916
I dunno, the three of
them just really seem

197
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,708
to belong together
in some weird way...

198
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:22,083
Yes, that's
true...

199
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:25,375
You do know... it's bound
to happen one day...

200
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,208
one of em's gonna'
tell her he likes her...

201
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:30,166
Oh, no, no... I'm afraid
I simply could not allow

202
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,708
my Tohru to date either
one of those boys...

203
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,041
So, what? Are you
her mother now?

204
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,541
Well, I really only
meant that half-joking...

205
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:40,208
So you were
half-serious...

206
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:41,541
It's their
signals...

207
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:44,291
I can still sense something
that troubles me...

208
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,000
There are many
conflicting emotions,

209
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:49,125
hanging like dark clouds
around their hearts...

210
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:52,791
I suppose that's true of every
person, to some extent...

211
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:56,166
But with those two, it seems
to be rather extreme...

212
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,708
And as long as those
dark clouds remain...

213
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,250
I'm not sure they
can ever truly share

214
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:03,375
their hearts
with another...

215
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:06,125
Then again, perhaps
I'm worrying too much...

216
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:09,583
They both seem pretty clueless
when it comes to dating...

217
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,708
Well, I'd say that goes
double for Tohru...

218
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,458
But, you
never know...

219
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:15,375
Sometimes, I bet
even clueless people

220
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,500
manage to fall
in love...

221
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:21,750
Oh, no... Picture our little
Tohru as a new bride...

222
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:26,083
Just thinking about it,
it makes me want to cry...

223
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:27,916
Okay. You're gettin' a
little bit ahead of yourself,

224
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,291
don't you
think?

225
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,250
Ahh... There's nothing
better than relaxing

226
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:34,583
with a cup of hot tea at
the end of a long day...

227
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:38,125
And especially after we
had such a nice visit!

228
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:39,791
I'm really glad I finally
got to introduce you

229
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:42,791
to Yuki and Kyo
today, Mom...

230
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:45,208
I can't even begin
to tell you...

231
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:49,291
Those two... they both
take such good care of me.

232
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,791
Maybe someday soon,

233
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:54,708
I'll get a chance to introduce
you to Shigure, too...

234
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,333
I really have found a
wonderful home here,

235
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:01,583
living in this house,
together with all of them.

236
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:05,416
And I'm so grateful for
every day I've had here...

237
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,250
So, Mom... I just
want you to know,

238
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,625
that while you're up
there watching over me,

239
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:13,500
you don't have to
worry any more...

240
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:14,750
I'm home.

241
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:21,041
Thanks so much for coming to
visit with me yesterday...

242
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:23,625
Hey... C'mon, we should
be thanking you...

243
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,666
Especially for all
the food you made...

244
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,166
Yes,
Tohru...

245
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,250
Your cooking keeps getting
better and better...

246
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:33,375
You're going to make
a fine bride one day...

247
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:35,250
I'm going
to cry...

248
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,875
Tohru!

249
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,458
Hide me!
Hide me!

250
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:41,833
Momiji!

251
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:44,541
We're playing cops and
robbers! And I'm the robber!

252
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:47,583
Momiji! Give it
up! You're busted!

253
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:50,541
They found me!
Gotta run!

254
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,750
Be careful! Watch
where you're going!

255
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:56,208
Hey! He's gettin' away!
Come on you guys! Let's go!

256
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:57,125
We've got you
now, Momiji!

257
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:58,041
You're goin'
downtown!

258
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,500
We've got you
surrounded!

259
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,000
How 'bout
that.

260
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,416
It looks
like fun.

261
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,125
Be... Be
careful...

262
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:06,833
But I don't know why they're
calling it 'Cops and Robbers'.

263
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:09,541
It just looked like a bunch of
boys chasing a girl to me...

264
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,833
He must look like
his mother...

265
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,000
[Uo] Oh... yeah... that's
what they say, isn't it?

266
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:16,666
Guys look like their moms and
girls look like their dads?

267
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,625
Yes, just like Tohru
resembles her father

268
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,000
more than
her mother...

269
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,416
Well, more like her
grandfather maybe...

270
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:26,291
Now that I'm thinking
about it, Momiji's parents

271
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:29,041
didn't come to the entrance
ceremony, did they?

272
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:31,708
The white-haired boy's
parents didn't come either...

273
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:35,083
Oh... I guess
they didn't...

274
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:39,041
Actually, I've never even heard
Momiji mention his parents.

275
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,666
None of the Sohmas talk
about their parents much...

276
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,916
This looks heavy! Can
I help you with it?

277
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,208
Momiji! What are
you doing here?

278
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,750
Oh, well... this
is Papa's building.

279
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:59,708
Ah! I see, so I
guess that means

280
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,875
your father works here
somewhere, is that right?

281
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,875
Sort of... but
not really.

282
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,666
Okay, I'll
tell you...

283
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,166
Ah, good...
There you are...

284
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,083
We didn't know if
you were still here...

285
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:15,125
The president's been looking
everywhere for you...

286
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,833
'kay... Tell him I'm going
home in just a minute,

287
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:18,750
so there's nothing
to worry about.

288
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,166
Right...

289
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,125
President? Looking
for Momiji?

290
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,958
See, this is just one of the
buildings that Papa owns!

291
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:31,750
That's what you
meant?! I had no idea!

292
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,750
Here...
Look!

293
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:34,916
Ta-da!

294
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,291
This is your father?
He's very handsome!

295
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,416
Oh, yeah, that
one's Mama.

296
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,708
Wow. She's
very beautiful...

297
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,750
Yep!

298
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:49,250
And she has such a
kind-looking face...

299
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:53,416
Her and Papa... well, Papa's
a Sohma so he's from here,

300
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,333
and he met her while
he was off at college.

301
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:56,708
Then they
got married.

302
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,041
That's
the story!

303
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,083
I still don't
know how Papa

304
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:02,541
managed to find
such a hot... Mama!

305
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:07,291
Know what? I have a
little sister, too!

306
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:11,458
Her name's Momo. And she
looks just like Mama!

307
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:15,208
I can't believe it! Momiji,
you have a younger sister?!

308
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:16,291
Yeah! She
just started

309
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,500
her second year of
elementary school.

310
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,041
Oh, and she's not a
member of the zodiac...

311
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:23,791
But still... she's really cute!
And she's still just a baby!

312
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,125
She follows Mama
around everywhere

313
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:26,750
she goes like
a baby chick.

314
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:29,875
And it's still hard for
her to say some words,

315
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:31,583
so when
she talks,

316
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,125
it's usually this
cute little mumble...

317
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:35,750
It's adorable!
Really!

318
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,250
I've never seen
him look so happy!

319
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:40,791
Her and Mama... on most days
they come to pick up Papa!

320
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:42,750
Mm! And it's
almost time!

321
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,916
Oh, so then all of you will
be going home together?

322
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,166
Well, no... but it'd
be great if we could!

323
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:50,166
You see, Mama doesn't
exactly know who I am...

324
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:54,791
Oh, Momiji...

325
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:58,041
What are you doing here?
And especially at this hour?

326
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,708
[Tohru] Ohh... we were
just talking about her...

327
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,375
And now,
here she is!

328
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:08,500
So then... This little
girl... must be Momo!

329
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,583
It really is
like Hana said.

330
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:13,291
Momiji does look
like his mother...

331
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,875
Ehh... My friend has
a part-time job here...

332
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:19,500
So I thought I'd stop 
and play for a while.

333
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:23,833
Mama doesn't exactly
know who I am...

334
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,583
Is that so? Well,
I hardly think

335
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,541
this is a place
to play...

336
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:28,916
You're right!
I'm sorry.

337
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,083
Well... You really
shouldn't be out this late.

338
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:34,333
Your mother must be
worried sick about you!

339
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:38,458
[Momiji] Yes, I know. I
was just about to go back.

340
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:41,500
All right, be sure
you go straight home.

341
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,625
Keep up the
good work.

342
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:44,125
Oh! Uh,
thank you...

343
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:48,250
Momo... Let's go now...
We can't keep Papa waiting!

344
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:07,750
Awww... I really didn't
want her to see me...

345
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:11,041
Now I'm gonna have to
apologize to Papa...

346
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,708
Um, Momiji...?

347
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,875
Yeah...

348
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:25,541
Like I said, Mama doesn't know
about me... She forgot...

349
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,500
Her memory
was erased...

350
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,791
She knows I'm a member
of the Sohma family,

351
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:32,250
but she thinks I'm
someone else's son...

352
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:36,083
Did you know, children
cursed by the zodiac,

353
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:37,291
when they're born,

354
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:40,083
they're always born
two months premature...

355
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:41,666
Imagine what that
was like for her...

356
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,333
She'd been married to
the man she truly loved...

357
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:46,791
they were having their
first child together...

358
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:50,416
She must have been so worried
when the baby came early...

359
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,250
And then,
after all that,

360
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:55,291
the first time she tried
to hold that baby...

361
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,125
to see it change into
a strange animal...

362
00:17:57,208 --> 00:18:02,416
How horrifying would that be
to a new mother? Any mother...

363
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,666
I know now that when
a mother has a child

364
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,708
who is cursed by
the zodiac...

365
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:08,291
often, she will feel
either the need

366
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,250
to be overly
protective of it,

367
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,416
or she will reject
it completely...

368
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,875
Mama is one of the ones
who rejected her child...

369
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:20,041
She rejected me with
her entire body...

370
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:21,333
It got to the point
that she couldn't even

371
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:23,500
stand to
look at me...

372
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,291
Sometimes she
would just snap--

373
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:28,666
yelling, screaming...
at everything...

374
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,666
Thinking about
it now...

375
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:34,791
I guess it was just like...
what happened to Kana.

376
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,458
Momiji...

377
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:38,583
Mama is very,
very sick...

378
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,958
But if she were to
forget about you...

379
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:43,583
they say she might
get better...

380
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:47,208
I know this is painful
for you too, Momiji...

381
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:48,541
But Papa will love
you twice as much

382
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,750
to make up
for her love...

383
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:54,083
If you love Mama,
like I do... Momiji,

384
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,583
help us
save her...

385
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,041
Is this
what you want?

386
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:01,416
Do you really want to
forget about your only child?

387
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,833
Are you sure... you
won't regret it?

388
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:09,500
Right now, my
greatest regret...

389
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:14,500
Is that that thing ever
came out of my body...

390
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:24,750
And so, I was erased
from Mama's memory...

391
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:28,958
and like they said, she
steadily began to get better...

392
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,583
After the first
couple months,

393
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:33,583
she even started
smiling again...

394
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:40,583
I guess what I did...
I guess it saved her...

395
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,000
[Tohru] So...
all this time...

396
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,500
he's been watching her
from a distance...

397
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:54,458
trying not to let her see
him... just like today...

398
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:56,791
But you know? There's
something I believe...

399
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:58,416
I want to try and
live my life,

400
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,125
carrying all of my
memories with me...

401
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:04,583
And even if those
memories are painful...

402
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,750
Even if they do
nothing but hurt me...

403
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,958
I want to
keep them...

404
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:14,125
Even those memories I sometimes
wish I could forget...

405
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,916
As long as I carry
them with me...

406
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,541
as long as I can keep
holding on, then someday...

407
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:21,750
Someday, I'll be
strong enough

408
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:24,500
that those memories
don't hurt me anymore...

409
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,875
and I'll be glad
I have them...

410
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:30,500
That's what I believe...
with all of my heart.

411
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:35,666
That's why all of my
memories are precious to me.

412
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:39,416
I don't think it would be
okay to forget a single one...

413
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,291
And that's why...
the truth is...

414
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:46,625
I didn't really want Mama to
forget about me... I didn't.

415
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:50,500
What I wanted... was
for her to hold on...

416
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,500
But I guess that was
selfish of me...

417
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:56,583
It'll be
our secret?

418
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:12,208
Me too...

419
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,791
I believe
that, too!

420
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:22,708
[Tohru] All of
my memories...

421
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:26,083
I want to keep them
close to my heart...

422
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:29,458
And I want to go
on believing...

423
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:30,750
I'm going to
hold on...

424
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:33,583
no matter how hard it
might be sometimes...

425
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:36,291
I never want
to forget.

426
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:40,041
Because, someday... I
will be strong enough...

427
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:42,541
All of the memories
that are painful now...

428
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:45,583
they won't
hurt anymore...

429
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:46,750
...and when that
day comes,

430
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:50,833
I'll be glad that
I have them...

431
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:58,875
Yes, all of my memories
are precious to me...

432
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:01,916
Every single one...

433
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:06,916
<i>Now let's all gather,</i>

434
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,500
<i>Enjoying the company we share,</i>

435
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:17,833
<i>Our tears will dissolve</i>
<i>into thin air,</i>

436
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:23,750
<i>As we drink up</i>
<i>this wonderful life.</i>

437
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:28,708
<i>La, la, la...</i>

438
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:34,791
<i>Takin' in all the</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

439
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:39,875
<i>La, la, la...</i>

440
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:45,916
<i>Drinkin' up all this</i>
<i>good love and life.</i>

441
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
<i>La, la, la...</i>

442
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:56,791
<i>Take it in all this</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

443
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:28,750
[Shigure] Alright,
here's an idea.

444
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:30,625
What do you say we
go on a trip tomorow?

445
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:33,166
After all this
is Golden Week.

446
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,583
It would be a shame if we
didn't do something special.

447
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:38,250
Chances like this
don't come very often.

448
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:41,708
At any rate, I thought we might
go to one of the Sohma's spas

449
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:42,958
or perhaps
the lake house.

450
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:44,541
How does that
sound Tohru?

451
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:46,791
[Tohru] But I've already been
on a trip to the Hot Springs...

452
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:49,041
I couldn't go on another
one. It would be too much.

453
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:51,708
[Shigure] And what a lovely
trip that must have been...

454
00:23:51,791 --> 00:23:53,916
It's too bad I wasn't
able to be there.

455
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,916
I did so want to go...

456
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,083
but now I guess I'll never
get to take a trip with you.
