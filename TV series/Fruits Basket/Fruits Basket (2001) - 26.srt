1
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:18,125
<i>I was so happy when you smiled,</i>

2
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:21,708
<i>Your smile breaks</i>
<i>through the clouds of grey,</i>

3
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:28,625
<i>Far from the sunny days</i>
<i>that lie in sleep.</i>

4
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:31,583
<i>Waiting with patience</i>
<i>for the Spring,</i>

5
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:35,583
<i>when the flowers will</i>
<i>bloom renewed again,</i>

6
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:42,625
<i>knowing there's more</i>
<i>beyond the pain of today.</i>

7
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:49,000
<i>Although the scars</i>
<i>of yesterday remain,</i>

8
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:56,458
<i>You can go on living as</i>
<i>much as your heart believes.</i>

9
00:00:56,541 --> 00:01:02,958
<i>You can't be born again</i>
<i>although you can change.</i>

10
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:09,666
<i>Let's stay together always.</i>

11
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:54,291
[Child] Tohru, you get
to be the rice ball!

12
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:13,416
[Kyo's Mother] Kyo...

13
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,750
Has something happened?
What's the matter?

14
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:24,083
Did Akito say something to
you again? It's all right...

15
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:26,250
It's all right...
Because... I...

16
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:30,750
I still love
you, at least...

17
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:33,625
I still love you
more than anything...

18
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:43,416
You're still human...
just like everybody else.

19
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:57,875
It's okay. I'm not the
slightest bit afraid of you.

20
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:02,583
No... You really were
afraid of me, weren't you...

21
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:05,416
That's why you checked me
dozens of times a day,

22
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,583
to make sure my beads hadn't
come off or anything...

23
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:10,583
You're my son. I'm
so proud of you.

24
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:13,916
In that case, why didn't
you ever let me go out?

25
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,416
You're so adorable, I wanted
to keep you all to myself!

26
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,083
You were
ashamed of me...

27
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,916
No, I
love you!

28
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,916
I would die for you,
I love you so much!

29
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Why is that all
you ever said?

30
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:30,208
You never really accepted
me-- not the real me...

31
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:31,583
You were just saying
all the things

32
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:33,875
you thought a mom
was supposed to say.

33
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,916
Your mother loved
you more than anyone.

34
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,833
Stop!

35
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:07,416
You too...
You too...

36
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:41,250
Is that all we
do... is run away?

37
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,166
Is that
all we do?!

38
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:48,083
Well I for one am
tired of running!

39
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:53,750
I don't want to
do it any more!

40
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:58,041
Miss Honda... Tell him...
Tell him the truth...

41
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:01,958
Tell him what you
think, right now!

42
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:04,250
Just tell
him the truth!

43
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:15,083
Hm! Thanks for
the warning!

44
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:16,416
You suck.

45
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,958
[Kyo] Let people know
what's on your mind.

46
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:24,208
[Mrs. Honda] Just
be yourself.

47
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,250
[Kyo]
It's okay...

48
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,875
Complain a
little...

49
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:38,333
...get upset or
something... It's okay...

50
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:41,250
You can tell people
what you want, you know.

51
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:50,291
Let's go home...
Back to our house...

52
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:07,583
I'm sorry... I'm... I'm such a
fool. I don't know what to do.

53
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:13,916
I'm afraid... Right now,
Kyo... I'm afraid of you.

54
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,916
But...

55
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,916
still...

56
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,750
I want us to stay
together... Together!

57
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:26,416
I do...
Always...

58
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:32,458
I want to eat our meals
together and study together

59
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:35,041
and worry
together...

60
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:37,541
I want to tell you all the
things that are on my mind.

61
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:42,541
And Kyo, I want to
listen to you...

62
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:46,166
And so... I want us
to stay together!

63
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:19,708
It's okay... You
don't have to...

64
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:22,083
You don't have to
love everything.

65
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,666
If you're
afraid...

66
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:28,083
If you're
afraid...

67
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:32,708
it just proves that you've
truly seen the real me.

68
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,875
Not like
my mom...

69
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:38,208
She went through all the
motions of loving me...

70
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,375
but she never even
tried to see me.

71
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:45,875
I wanted us to talk together
and worry together, too...

72
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:48,791
I was fine with
her being afraid.

73
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:52,375
Even if she didn't love
me in that ugly form...

74
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:56,750
I wanted... I wanted
us to stay together...

75
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,750
I've been
a fool...

76
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:11,958
I didn't think
that... anyone...

77
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:16,250
anyone... would
ever say that to me.

78
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:17,958
Not to
me...

79
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:30,625
Tohru...

80
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:34,750
Tohru...

81
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,625
How is it
that you...

82
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:52,083
could
give me...

83
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:56,916
...the words that I needed
to hear the most right now?

84
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,916
How is it that...
somebody like you...

85
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,750
could be here by my
side... crying for me?

86
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,208
How...?

87
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,458
Yuki...?

88
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:07,208
Thank you.

89
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:14,916
No, Kagura...
Thank you.

90
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,500
Oh, Mom...

91
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,958
You're not even
saying goodbye...?

92
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:59,291
I know... I'm still
not good enough...

93
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:02,791
But someday... I swear,
someday I'm gonna be!

94
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,458
I'm gonna be the
kind of person

95
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:07,208
my master can be proud
to tell the world...

96
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,208
"I'm his Dad!"

97
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,583
You haven't
changed...

98
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:35,958
You are still quite the
troublesome son... Kyo...

99
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:45,208
Mom...

100
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:50,041
Is there
anything I can do?

101
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:53,208
Just be yourself.
You'll be fine.

102
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,208
[Akito] It serves you
right, you know...

103
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:13,875
♪ Breakfast time, breakfast
time, all for me, breakfast-- ♪

104
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:15,416
Kyo, it's time to eat.

105
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,083
You're sure are
lively this morning.

106
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:25,291
Let's
see now...

107
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:26,958
Ah! Where
to start...

108
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,208
Shigure...

109
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,625
Well,
um...

110
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:39,083
Tomorrow... I'd like to go
see Akito, if that's okay.

111
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,916
Can I talk to you
outside for a moment?

112
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,541
About Akito...

113
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:52,833
The reason he only has a
short time left to live...

114
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,208
is because he bears
what you might call

115
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:57,375
the "core" of
the Zodiac Curse.

116
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,833
This was decided at
the time he was born.

117
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:02,000
And despite what
you may hope,

118
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:04,250
there's nothing he or any
of us can do to change it.

119
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:07,208
All we can do...
The Sohmas, I mean...

120
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:09,833
is live the way
he tells us.

121
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:14,291
But that's us...
As for you...

122
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:18,166
I think it might be best if you
stayed away from him... okay?

123
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:22,875
Okay...

124
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:32,541
[Shigure] Ah, hello. Ha'ri!
Uh, we're on our way over now,

125
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:33,875
if that's
okay...

126
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:36,541
Oh, no, uh... It's not
so much for me, as uh...

127
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:38,083
as it is
for Tohru...

128
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:15,875
I admire
your nerve...

129
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:18,083
What have you
come here for?

130
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,750
Go on... tell me...
I won't be angry...

131
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,000
What have you
come here for?

132
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,416
I don't
know...

133
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:22,833
It's not that you
don't know, is it?!

134
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:24,916
You just can't
say it, can you?!

135
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,791
Well, let me
say it for you!

136
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,500
You're going to tell me that
you want to go on living

137
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:30,166
with everyone
in that house!

138
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,375
But I won't
allow it.

139
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,125
I will make
you regret...

140
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:34,875
you ever had anything
to do with the Sohmas!

141
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:38,208
You will suffer! You will
suffer as we suffer!

142
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:40,791
Did you think, by coming
here and kneeling before me

143
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:41,875
you could
change anything?!

144
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,750
Well let me tell
you, you can't!

145
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,875
None of you can! You can
never leave the Sohmas!

146
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:50,666
Just like you can
never go against me!

147
00:15:56,291 --> 00:16:00,208
Now... I want to hear you
beg me for forgiveness...

148
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:03,875
Say you'll never interfere
with the Sohmas again.

149
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:06,791
It must have been very
painful... Akito...

150
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:09,625
being told that the
day you were born...

151
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:12,541
you were going
to die...

152
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,083
It must have been
so painful...

153
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:21,416
What was?! What do
you know about it?!

154
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,041
You're right... I
can't even imagine...

155
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:27,250
how awful it would be to
know something like that...

156
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:30,166
or how
terrifying...

157
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:33,416
Shigure... and
Yuki... and Kyo...

158
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,583
I'm sure they feel
the same way...

159
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:38,041
And Hatori,
too...

160
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:45,750
And when you pass
away, we'll be sad...

161
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:48,875
we'll be very sad
to lose you...

162
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:54,083
And so...

163
00:16:54,166 --> 00:17:00,708
Who's going to be sad? Everyone
is able to live, thanks to me.

164
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:04,291
They all hope that I
will be gone quickly.

165
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:10,208
I was born in order to die...
That's what was decided.

166
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:14,666
But, why... Who decided
it had to be like that?

167
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,583
Akito, right now, you're
alive, aren't you?

168
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:20,291
Alive? You call this
being alive? Do you?

169
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,750
It's been decided...
It's been decided!

170
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,958
And they never
even asked me...

171
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:31,916
I... I didn't know my
Mom was going to die...

172
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,208
Silence! Stop
talking! Hatori!

173
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:39,791
I want you to erase this
girl's memory! Do it! Now!

174
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:42,541
Hatori!

175
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:46,041
I wanted her to
live a long time...

176
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:49,666
I wanted her... to be
here, to watch me...

177
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:53,375
Stop crying... Stop
it! Stop crying!

178
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:57,416
And I don't know what your
family's curse is... but...

179
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:04,333
I'm happy... I'm happy
that I know you... Akito...

180
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,708
And I don't regret
meeting you...

181
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:10,833
or anyone...
not at all...

182
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:18,916
I want to know you... Please
tell me how you feel...

183
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,583
Even if you're
angry, or bitter,

184
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,875
or frustrated...
that's okay!

185
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:26,208
Because the important
thing is...

186
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:28,750
right now, Akito...

187
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:38,208
...you're alive.

188
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:22,500
I don't
know...

189
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,500
[Kyo]
Hey!

190
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:07,291
Well, c'mon you damn rat! Tell
me what happened in there!

191
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:10,250
Oh, uh...
Nothing really...

192
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,833
I guess it was
presumptuous of me to think

193
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:14,208
anything would change
if I came here today.

194
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:16,583
Oh, no... That's
not true at all...

195
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:17,875
Indeed,
it's not...

196
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:19,583
What're you
talkin' about?

197
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:22,208
[Shigure] Oh, uh... nothing.
Just thinking out loud.

198
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:24,041
[Kyo] No you
weren't!

199
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,208
[Tohru] Um... I promise
to tell you everything

200
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,458
once we get
home, okay?

201
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:28,208
And Kyo...

202
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:29,458
What do
you want?!

203
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:31,875
We should have a fight
once we get there, too.

204
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,500
Heh! So you're finally
ready to face the music, huh?

205
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:35,875
Well it's
about time...

206
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:38,666
Hey! Hold on! I'm not
lettin' you out of my sight!

207
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,750
I see he's feeling
lively again today...

208
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:43,833
Yes, well, you seemed pretty
lively yourself, back there.

209
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:45,208
I suppose...

210
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:47,416
Not that it really made that
much of a difference...

211
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,166
It's still not too
late, you know...

212
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,000
We may be able to find
something, even now.

213
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:56,583
Yes. So long as we can decide
what it is we're looking for...

214
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:59,541
And even if we can't, there's
always the next time around.

215
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,833
Yes, there is... Shall
we take it slowly, then?

216
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:03,958
[Kyo] Hey!

217
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,791
Can we hurry
up already?!

218
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,125
I don't care if it's
leftovers or what,

219
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:09,583
I gotta eat! I'm
starvin' over here!

220
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:12,208
Oh...
coming!

221
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:36,583
Mom...

222
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,708
...are you
watching?

223
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:41,333
You know, sometimes
things are hard,

224
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:44,875
and I feel sad, or
I want to cry...

225
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:47,041
...but I'm
still trying...

226
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:51,541
we're all trying to
keep moving forward...

227
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:53,833
and we will...

228
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:57,083
I know we've still got
a long way to go...

229
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:58,666
together.

230
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:07,208
<i>Now let's all gather,</i>

231
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:12,458
<i>Enjoying the company we share,</i>

232
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:18,041
<i>Our tears will dissolve</i>
<i>into thin air,</i>

233
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:23,958
<i>As we drink up</i>
<i>this wonderful life.</i>

234
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:28,875
<i>La, la, la...</i>

235
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:35,000
<i>Takin' in all the</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

236
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:39,875
<i>La, la, la...</i>

237
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:46,125
<i>Drinkin' up all this</i>
<i>good love and life.</i>

238
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:51,208
<i>La, la, la...</i>

239
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:56,958
<i>Take it in all this</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>
