1
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:18,125
<i>I was so happy when you smiled,</i>

2
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:21,708
<i>Your smile breaks</i>
<i>through the clouds of grey,</i>

3
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:28,625
<i>Far from the sunny days</i>
<i>that lie in sleep.</i>

4
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:31,583
<i>Waiting with patience</i>
<i>for the Spring,</i>

5
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:35,583
<i>when the flowers will</i>
<i>bloom renewed again,</i>

6
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:42,625
<i>knowing there's more</i>
<i>beyond the pain of today.</i>

7
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:49,000
<i>Although the scars</i>
<i>of yesterday remain,</i>

8
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:56,458
<i>You can go on living as</i>
<i>much as your heart believes.</i>

9
00:00:56,541 --> 00:01:02,958
<i>You can't be born again</i>
<i>although you can change.</i>

10
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:09,666
<i>Let's stay together always.</i>

11
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:30,750
Hey...
Where's Kisa?

12
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:33,333
Oh, I'm sorry...
She's not here.

13
00:01:33,416 --> 00:01:35,791
She's gone over to Shigure's
house for the evening...

14
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:38,208
She wanted to watch an
anime video with Tohru.

15
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:40,583
Kisa absolutely
adores that girl.

16
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:42,791
I've never seen
her so happy...

17
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:48,000
Oh, man! What a
powerful opponent!

18
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:51,666
You are right to fear
my incredible power, Ari.

19
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,333
Moge!

20
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:54,000
I must beat you...

21
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:56,875
Or I will be paddled by Lord
Kakah when I return home!

22
00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:59,041
Ahhh! What a
terrible enemy!

23
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:00,291
He's so
childish,

24
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:01,666
taking out his stress
at home on other people!

25
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:05,166
I guess even bad guys
can have problems...

26
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,708
I never thought
of it like that...

27
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:08,333
I'd say the people
with real problems

28
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:10,125
are the ones who
produced this anime...

29
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:12,000
Ahh...
Good morning.

30
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:13,750
"Good evening"
is more like it.

31
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,208
I think your sleep
schedule is a bit off.

32
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:17,708
No, it's
perfectly normal.

33
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:21,333
Such is the life of
the creative mind.

34
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:24,208
And who is this? Such
a cute little girl.

35
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,333
Would you like Grandpa Shigure
to give you some candy?

36
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:27,791
Oh, stop it. The
way you say that,

37
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:29,791
it makes you sound
like a dirty old man.

38
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:32,625
I see Yuki's being
cold, as usual...

39
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:35,041
And as usual, you're
being an idiot.

40
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:37,250
So... what are
we watching?

41
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:40,208
An anime. I'd
never seen it,

42
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:43,875
but all the kids at school
seem to like it, so...

43
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:45,875
I borrowed it.

44
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:48,333
Ah, and how are things
going at school?

45
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:53,125
Oh...
It's okay.

46
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:56,083
I love you
so much!

47
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:57,500
And it
shows.

48
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:02,458
Well, there's the
bell... Gotta run!

49
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:04,416
Ahh... off to
work, huh?

50
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,541
See you
tomorrow... Tohru.

51
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:07,250
'kay!

52
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:12,375
Oh, I'm early. I guess I didn't
need to be in such a rush...

53
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:16,416
Oh well, I can just take my
time in the locker room--

54
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,625
Where did that
come from?

55
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:19,500
Hey!

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,041
You there...
pick that up.

57
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:27,625
What a cute
little boy.

58
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:28,875
Come on,
pick it up.

59
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,625
Oh... right.

60
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:33,583
Here you go!

61
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:37,083
What are you, stupid or
somethin'? Why'd you do that?

62
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:38,583
Don't you have a
mind of your own?

63
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,416
Or do you always do
what people tell you?

64
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,083
What if I told you to roll on
the ground? Would you do that?

65
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:44,375
How 'bout if I told you
to jump off a bridge?

66
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:45,375
No, uh...

67
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:46,583
You know you'll
never get anywhere

68
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:48,583
unless you learn how
to think for yourself.

69
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:51,541
Well as long as
you picked it up,

70
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,375
hurry up and
give it back...

71
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:54,833
What are you tryin'
to do, steal it?

72
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:58,916
Uh... Oh, no!
Of course not!

73
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,458
Hey!

74
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,333
I came all this
way to meet you.

75
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:05,500
You could at least say
'thank you' or somethin'.

76
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,375
Eh? Oh,
but I...

77
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,125
C'mon, do complete
strangers tell you

78
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,125
they came to meet
you everyday?

79
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:12,291
Put it
together.

80
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:13,541
I think by now it
should be pretty easy

81
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,916
to guess
who I am...

82
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,458
He's a member
of the zodiac!

83
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,083
You're not too
quick, are you?

84
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:21,958
Uhh...
ohhh...

85
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:23,500
Really...

86
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:26,041
Everyone talks about you like
you're somethin' special...

87
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:27,458
I don't see what's
the big deal.

88
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:30,375
You don't seem that great
to me. You're pretty dull.

89
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:33,208
Ahh, this was dumb.
A total waste of time.

90
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:35,625
Now you at least gotta
treat me to a meal...

91
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:37,916
What's the
problem?

92
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,375
You want me to get somethin'
good outta this, don't ya'?

93
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:41,541
Take me
out to eat.

94
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,916
Oh, well I was just
on my way to work...

95
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,041
And I don't really have
that much money with me...

96
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,083
Yeah? Let's see
your wallet.

97
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:50,250
Ah! Wait, I--

98
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:51,583
Man, what a
cheap lookin' bag.

99
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,041
Wait,
please...

100
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,750
Ahh, but here's somethin'.
This notebook's pretty nice.

101
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:58,208
I like the color...
I'll just take this.

102
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,625
No, you
can't! That's--

103
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:03,666
Oh, by the way... I doubt
I'll ever see you again,

104
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,875
so I might as well tell
you: I'm Hiro Sohma.

105
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:10,583
Bye! Oh, and thanks for such a
boring time... It was a blast.

106
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:16,750
Ah! Wait! Please! That notebook
has my Mom's picture in it!

107
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,500
Oh no! Mom's been kidnapped!
What am I going to do?

108
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:27,875
I can't even think about
going into work now... Mom!

109
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,125
Hiro Sohma...

110
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:30,500
He's the first new
member of the zodiac

111
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:32,041
I've met in
a long time,

112
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:34,500
but-- did I do something
to make him mad at me?

113
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,541
I don't know, it all
happened so fast...

114
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:37,875
Tohru!

115
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,916
Why are you sitting in
the middle of the street?

116
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,041
You're okay, right?

117
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:44,375
You look a little
bit lost...

118
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:45,750
Momiji...

119
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:53,000
This must be her mom...
Hm. She's pretty hot.

120
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:57,083
Well isn't she just the little
mama's girl? How boring...

121
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,375
Hiro. What are you
doin' out here?

122
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,750
Why, do I need a
permit or somethin'?

123
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,416
Do I have to have a
reason to be here?

124
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,458
Maybe I'm just sittin'
here 'cause I want to.

125
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:07,625
Or is that some
kinda' crime?

126
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:08,708
I didn't say
any of that.

127
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:10,916
I just asked you a
simple question...

128
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,375
And what? Just
because you asked,

129
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:14,250
does that mean I
have to answer?

130
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,875
Maybe I don't want to
tell you why I'm here.

131
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,041
Dammit! You know, for
a snot-nosed little kid,

132
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:19,916
you sure got
a big mouth.

133
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,333
Really? Well, you're
the one who's yelling...

134
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:23,958
No, now
I'm yelling!

135
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:29,083
Hiro! Hiro! The notebook...
Do you have it?

136
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:31,416
Oh...
Hi, Kyo...

137
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,375
It's you... What, did
you follow me here?

138
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:36,208
How the heck did
you find me?

139
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,375
Okay. Spill it.
What did you do?

140
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:40,666
Heh! Oh sure... so
you just accuse me

141
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,625
before you even know
what's goin' on.

142
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,708
Maybe I'm innocent,
ever think of that?

143
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,708
All I did was
take her notebook.

144
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:49,708
So you did do somethin'!
Give it back, right now!

145
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:51,000
Why should I?

146
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:52,041
It's not like
I stole it.

147
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:53,541
That stupid girl
asked me to take it.

148
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:55,291
Who are you
callin' stupid?

149
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,208
You little brat. You
better watch yourself

150
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,666
before I decide to knock
that punk-ass mouth of yours

151
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,791
right off
your face.

152
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:02,000
K-Kyo...

153
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,750
Go ahead. I'll just turn
you into the police

154
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,541
for child abuse.

155
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,000
Hiro...

156
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:12,708
Hiro... Did you really
take it? Sissy's notebook?

157
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:17,875
Ah, it's Kisa! Hello! But
what are you doing here?

158
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:20,416
Isn't it obvious? That dumb
rabbit went and got her.

159
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:24,916
That's right! Kisa knows all
your hiding spots, doesn't she?

160
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,416
Hiro... please, you
have to give it back.

161
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,500
Don't cause any more problems
for Sissy... It's not nice.

162
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:35,666
Give it back.
Please.

163
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,208
This is
stupid.

164
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,875
Here! I don't want
this dumb thing anyway!

165
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:40,458
Hiro!

166
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:41,750
That's
mean.

167
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,375
Oh no... Really,
it's okay now...

168
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:44,208
No it's not!

169
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:47,666
H- Hiro...?

170
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:51,375
Are you trying to be
mean to Sissy on purpose?

171
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:53,416
I don't understand why
you're acting this way,

172
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,583
but it
makes me sad.

173
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:02,375
"Sissy, sissy, sissy"...
That's all I hear... I hate it!

174
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:05,208
All you ever talk about
is that stupid girl!

175
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:07,041
And the video! You
couldn't wait to run off

176
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:08,750
and watch it
with her.

177
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:15,208
I let you borrow it because I
wanted to watch it with you.

178
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:20,583
But, you-- that's not what you
said when you gave it to me...

179
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,833
It's a pretty lame show, but
you wanted to see it, right?

180
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:26,708
Take it... I don't need
to watch it again.

181
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:29,208
You should've
just... told me.

182
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,708
What, do I gotta spell it
out for you every time?!

183
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:32,583
Take a hint!

184
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:33,833
Hiro, you're
not being fair.

185
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:35,958
Who asked
you, rabbit?!

186
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:39,041
I mean, I know I wasn't
much of a help...

187
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,458
I couldn't do
anything for you

188
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:43,375
when you were having a
hard time at school...

189
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:47,916
But still, "Sissy, Sissy"...
She's all you talk about...

190
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,708
What about me?
I was there...

191
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:54,958
I wanted to help...
I did... I was...

192
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:58,458
I was really worried
about you, too...

193
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:05,375
What the hell
is goin' on?

194
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:06,791
Kyo-o, pay
attention.

195
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:10,625
Come on, Hiro's
jealous of Tohru...

196
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:11,958
And for a
sixth-grader,

197
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:14,625
that sort of thing can be
pretty hard to handle...

198
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:17,291
He needed
to vent.

199
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:23,875
I'm sorry, Hiro.
But next time,

200
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:27,708
we'll watch the video
together. Okay?

201
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:34,708
Kisa loves you so much. I
guess he just felt left out.

202
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:37,500
I don't know if that should
make me feel happy or sad.

203
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,458
Oh well, what
can you do?

204
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,916
But, you
know...

205
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,875
I do think you should
apologize to Sissy...

206
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,375
She's right,
Hiro...

207
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:49,750
Tohru's late to work
now because of you.

208
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,208
No matter what,

209
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,208
I'm glad to have met a
new member of the zodiac.

210
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,208
And Hiro seems like
such a smart boy.

211
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:04,333
But he's still so
young and all...

212
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:07,500
No! I won't forgive him,
even if he apologizes!

213
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,583
He's going to have to be
punished, and that's that!

214
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:13,291
Punished? What do
you think you can do?

215
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,625
I can
hug you!

216
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,625
Stupid... How is
that a punishment?

217
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:26,375
Hiro's not gonna forget
this for a long, long time.

218
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:31,083
Let's start over, okay? It's
wonderful to meet you... Hiro.

219
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:34,541
He's still so young, he
didn't know what else to do.

220
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:35,750
But it's sweet,
really...

221
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,208
He's a little boy in
love for the first time.

222
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,375
Or I will be paddled by Lord
Kakah when I return home!

223
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,125
So, why does he live
with this Lord Kakah guy

224
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,791
if he's so
afraid of him?

225
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:47,041
He could just move out
and stop being a bad guy

226
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,625
if he really
wanted to...

227
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:51,166
And what's with that last line?
It doesn't make any sense...

228
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,250
Just try to enjoy the
anime as it is, Hiro. Okay?

229
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:01,333
This is
too sweet.

230
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:02,416
You think just
'cause we're young

231
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,541
we only wanna eat
this sugary stuff?

232
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:05,875
What about
cavities?

233
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:08,041
You want all our teeth to
fall out or somethin'?

234
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:11,000
Oh, I guess I didn't
think about that.

235
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,958
Figures. Some people just have
no consideration for others...

236
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:14,958
Hiro...

237
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,291
Don't worry,
Kisa... It's okay.

238
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,458
It's not okay! Be more
careful next time!

239
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,291
Oh, right! I
definitely will!

240
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,458
Hey, Hiro!

241
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:25,458
Get it through your skull,
she's not your maid!

242
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:26,791
Quit bossin'
her around!

243
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:27,833
Why do you even
come over here

244
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:29,875
if all you're gonna
do is complain?

245
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:31,875
If you don't like it, go
hang out somewhere else!

246
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,708
Oh, what's this?

247
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:36,750
Since when did the cat get to
be the boss of this house?

248
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,583
I mean, what right do you
have to come in here

249
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,083
yellin' like you
own the place?

250
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,250
Do you pay the
bills or somethin'?

251
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,416
'Cause I don't
think you do.

252
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,625
You can't just go
around shoutin' orders

253
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:45,916
if you're not gonna take
any responsibility.

254
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,708
If you don't have
somethin' to back it up,

255
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,000
all you're doin' is acting
like a whiny little kid.

256
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:52,583
You mean like
you?! You punk!

257
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:54,791
Leave him
alone, Kyo.

258
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,708
He's just going through
a rebellious phase.

259
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:59,375
Yeah? So what! I don't care
what he's goin' through!

260
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,625
I don't want him here. Tell
him to go somewhere else!

261
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:04,875
Sorry, Kyo. But I'm afraid it's
not as simple as all that.

262
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,708
When a zodiac member wants
to get close to someone...

263
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:09,000
Well, let's just
say Sohma House

264
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,875
isn't always the most
conducive environment

265
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,166
for relationships...

266
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,791
Just try not to let
him bother you...

267
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,791
Although, I realize that
might be difficult,

268
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:19,208
seeing as how you're still in
a rebellious phase yourself...

269
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:20,041
Am not!

270
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,291
Yes, my point
exactly...

271
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,500
You need to try
a little harder

272
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,541
to behave like a
responsible adult, like me.

273
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,875
Like you? You call
missing your deadlines

274
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:28,875
being a
'responsible adult'?

275
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,000
Oh, uh...

276
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,208
I found
her outside,

277
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,041
looking like she was
about to hang herself...

278
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:36,000
Why, why, why?! Why didn't
you finish your pages?!

279
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,208
Who can say? It's the
oddest thing, isn't it?

280
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,541
Shigure!

281
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:42,833
Yes, yes, I know...
I'll get right on it...

282
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:47,416
But, in the meantime, why don't
you go home and take it easy?

283
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,750
I thought they'd never leave.
I mean, talk about annoying...

284
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,500
Hey, go get me
some more tea.

285
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:53,541
What did I
just tell you?!

286
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,208
Okay... Be
right back.

287
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,666
And you! Stop doin'
everything he says!

288
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,666
And here I thought this house
couldn't get any noisier.

289
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:04,291
Aww, jeez! I'm sick'a
arguing with a kid!

290
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,083
Hiro, what's
wrong?

291
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:08,041
It almost seems like
you don't like Sissy...

292
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,625
'Cause I
don't.

293
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:16,041
Well, I don't understand. Then
why did you want to come here?

294
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:19,916
Because... I know you that
you like her so much...

295
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,250
And because...

296
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:27,291
I want to take you to the
places that you like.

297
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:31,875
Yes, that's true.
Whenever I'm around Sissy,

298
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:34,458
she makes me feel
all warm inside.

299
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:38,875
The tea's ready! Sorry
to keep you waiting.

300
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,375
Toilet.

301
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,375
I'm sorry...
You know, he...

302
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,208
he's really very nice once
you get to know him...

303
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:57,625
I believe it,

304
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:00,541
what with the way the two
of you get along so well.

305
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:01,875
For a while...

306
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:04,791
I was afraid that Hiro
didn't like me at all.

307
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,291
When I was still in
elementary school,

308
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:09,958
we used to play
together all the time.

309
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:12,291
But then when I
started middle school...

310
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:15,458
things got really
awkward between us.

311
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:18,458
All of a sudden, he didn't
want to talk to me any more...

312
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:21,250
And I couldn't
figure out why...

313
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:25,833
That's why... that's
why I was so surprised...

314
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:28,250
I wanted to
help, I did.

315
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:32,958
I was... I was worried
about you, too.

316
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,916
It made me
so happy.

317
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,708
Oh, now I
understand...

318
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,333
I guess when they
like someone,

319
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:42,541
young boys do have some pretty
strange ways of showing it...

320
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,416
But still, I can't
help but wonder

321
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,625
if there's more to
it than that...

322
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:47,875
Along with all the
confusion that comes

323
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,291
with being a
little boy,

324
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:50,708
Hiro also has to
carry the weight

325
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:52,875
of living
with a curse...

326
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,166
It must be so
hard on him...

327
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,208
Because if he's
anything like

328
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:58,166
the other Zodiac
members I've met...

329
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,208
inside that
little body,

330
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:01,041
there could be a
storm raging...

331
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:04,208
a whirlwind of
mixed-up emotions...

332
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:07,750
dark clouds of
painful memories...

333
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:10,833
I suppose Hiro
didn't know...

334
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:13,250
He had no idea the
possible consequences

335
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,458
of telling Akito
how he felt...

336
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,208
I really
love Kisa!

337
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,708
And as a
result...

338
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:24,875
Unfortunate, but I can't
say it's surprising.

339
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,041
After all, Akito doesn't
generally approve of anything

340
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:30,041
that happens outside of his
knowledge, now does he?

341
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,333
After that, Hiro tried
to have as little to do

342
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:35,041
with Kisa
as possible.

343
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:36,333
And during
that time,

344
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:40,583
the other kids at school
started picking on her.

345
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:45,166
Well, I guess that explains
why he didn't do anything.

346
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,291
He couldn't very
well help her

347
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,750
if he was afraid to
get close to her.

348
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:51,250
And after he'd already
caused her to be hurt once,

349
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:54,250
I suppose I can understand
how he might feel that way.

350
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:58,541
Yes... He blames himself
for what happened.

351
00:15:58,625 --> 00:15:59,708
But I think he's
still too young

352
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,791
to know how to deal
with those feelings.

353
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:05,041
And so, he vents
his anger on Tohru,

354
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,708
which, I have to say,
is quite a shame.

355
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:13,875
Hiro? Kisa?

356
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:16,000
You don't have to
work today, right?

357
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,791
So... take us
somewhere fun.

358
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,291
Wow, so the two
of you came here

359
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:20,875
on your way home
just to see me?

360
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:23,458
That's right! We came! And
we're tired of standing around!

361
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:24,750
So hurry up and
take us somewhere

362
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,416
before we get
even more bored!

363
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,000
Uh... Okay... Where
would you like to go?

364
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:32,000
What? Can't you even decide
one simple thing by yourself?

365
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:33,250
Don't you know if
something's fun or not?

366
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:34,458
Don't you
have opinions?

367
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:35,916
Do you think you
can just sit back

368
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,166
and let other people do all
of your thinking for you?

369
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,541
Oh... Yeah, what a wonderful
way to live your life.

370
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,750
I'm sorry!

371
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,375
Huh? A
playground?

372
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:46,875
Uh-huh!
It'll be fun!

373
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,916
Now listen... Why
would you even think

374
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,666
to take us some
place so boring?!

375
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,041
Haven't you ever heard
of an amusement park,

376
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,750
or a movie, or
things like that?

377
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:57,375
Oh... It's just that I don't
have much money right now.

378
00:16:57,458 --> 00:17:00,083
Um... but I
really like it here.

379
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:01,333
You're
forgiven.

380
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:05,000
Ahh... Thank goodness!
Oh, it's a crepe vendor!

381
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,625
Would you two
like to have one?

382
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,875
Kisa?
Want one?

383
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,250
I'll take
chocolate.

384
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,750
'Kay! And Kisa, what
would you like?

385
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:16,166
Um... Strawberry...
Oh, no wait...

386
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,666
Is there something
else you'd like?

387
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,666
Uh-huh...
Banana-chocolate.

388
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,500
Well, that sounds
delicious, too.

389
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,750
I'll get both
and we'll share!

390
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:30,083
Excuse me. I'd
like a chocolate,

391
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,208
a strawberry, and
a banana-chocolate.

392
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:32,250
Sure!

393
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:34,916
Hiro! You
scared me!

394
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'm gonna pay for Kisa's...
And as long as I'm at it,

395
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,500
I'll go ahead and
pay for myself.

396
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,000
But I'm not
payin' for you.

397
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:41,875
You buy
your own.

398
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:43,375
O-Okay...

399
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,541
Now stand up straight. You
look like an idiot down there.

400
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:46,375
Right!

401
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:53,750
I don't get it... There's
nothin' special about you.

402
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,125
You don't have
magic powers.

403
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,625
So how could a dumb girl
like you do what I couldn't?

404
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,416
Why does everyone say
you're so 'great', huh?

405
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:03,333
Is it because you
can really solve

406
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,958
anyone's problems
for them?

407
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:08,625
Can you really make
anyone's troubles disappear?

408
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,375
Can you really
save anyone?

409
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:12,958
Well, no, I mean...
Not at all...

410
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:15,375
And if you think I'm gonna go
for that pretend modesty stuff,

411
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:16,750
you can
forget it.

412
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:20,250
Right...

413
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,625
If it was her...

414
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:26,666
If she had been in the
same situation as me,

415
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:30,208
could she have done anything
more for Kisa than I did?

416
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:33,833
I only did what I did
because I loved her so much...

417
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:36,333
I wanted her to know
how much I loved her...

418
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:41,791
I wanted everyone to
know-- even Akito... But...

419
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:58,375
But I'm a coward... After
that, I couldn't face Kisa...

420
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:00,500
And I couldn't
stand up to Akito...

421
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:03,500
So I ran away...
I ignored her...

422
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:06,875
Even when I found out the
other kids were picking on her,

423
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,125
I couldn't do
anything...

424
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:10,041
And the
whole time...

425
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:13,666
I was still telling
myself that I loved her...

426
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:17,333
I am a
coward...

427
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:19,916
Why is it?

428
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,333
Why do I have to act
like... such a child?

429
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:28,375
I couldn't do anything!
Like a stupid little kid...

430
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:33,166
And then she showed up,
and I got so jealous...

431
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,875
I feel like such a fool
for acting like this...

432
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:39,625
...just like a spoiled
little child! I hate it!

433
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:43,875
Why do I have to be this way?
This isn't what I want to be...

434
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:47,416
Why can't I be
more... grown up?

435
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,791
Hiro,
you're amazing.

436
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,583
You know, I wasn't really
askin' for your opinion.

437
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,375
And if you think flattery's
gonna work on me...

438
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,083
Don't even
bother... It won't.

439
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,916
I mean it... Really!

440
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,291
It's scary when you realize
you're still a child,

441
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:05,375
and when you think
about all the things

442
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:06,916
you still
can't do...

443
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,333
My mom said it's
the kind of thing

444
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,833
a lot of people are
too afraid to admit...

445
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:14,041
She said, it takes a lot
of courage for someone

446
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:17,666
to admit something like
that to themselves...

447
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,541
But you know, there are still
a lot of things you can do.

448
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:23,375
One day, you're going to grow
up to be a valiant prince

449
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,625
who can always
protect Kisa.

450
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:28,333
I know you will, because you
have a lot of courage in you.

451
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:29,958
And with
enough courage,

452
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,250
all the limitations
you think you have,

453
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:34,500
they won't be
limitations for long!

454
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:37,375
So... let's see if
I got this straight.

455
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:41,750
What you're saying is, right
now I'm nothing like a prince?

456
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:45,625
Well, I suppose
that's true...

457
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:47,208
Here
you go!

458
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:49,541
Oh, thanks!

459
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,625
Hold it! I guess
that little speech

460
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,541
was enough to earn
you somethin',

461
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:56,041
so this one's on me. Just
don't get used to it.

462
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:01,666
How stupid
can you get?

463
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,625
I mean, tellin' me I'm
gonna be a prince?

464
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:08,041
It's just dumb talk. It's
not like she can back it up.

465
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:09,708
Is she gonna take
responsibility

466
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,541
if I don't
become one?

467
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:14,875
Or if I can't...

468
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:19,541
Hiro... What is it?

469
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:23,791
You're smiling. Did
something happen?

470
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:28,250
You just watch. I am
gonna be one, for sure!

471
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:31,208
Still, I'd rather die
than tell her "Thanks".

472
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,916
[Tohru] Hiro, you
forgot your change!

473
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:37,333
I know Hiro's been the
one to ask lately...

474
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:40,416
but I can't expect him to
lead me by the hand forever.

475
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,375
I'll never get anywhere
if I don't learn how

476
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:45,208
to speak up for
myself more often...

477
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:49,583
So I was wondering... I
thought maybe this Sunday...

478
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:52,375
Um... if you
don't mind...

479
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:56,708
Can you and me and Hiro all
do something together? Please?

480
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:58,375
Sure! It
sounds fun!

481
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:01,791
I guess I'm stuck with this
girl whether I like it or not!

482
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:06,916
<i>Now let's all gather,</i>

483
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,500
<i>Enjoying the company we share,</i>

484
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:17,791
<i>Our tears will dissolve</i>
<i>into thin air,</i>

485
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:23,750
<i>As we drink up</i>
<i>this wonderful life.</i>

486
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:28,708
<i>La, la, la...</i>

487
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:34,791
<i>Takin' in all the</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

488
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:39,875
<i>La, la, la...</i>

489
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:45,916
<i>Drinkin' up all this</i>
<i>good love and life.</i>

490
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
<i>La, la, la...</i>

491
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:56,791
<i>Take it in all this</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

492
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:25,166
[Motoko]
I love Yuki.

493
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,916
I love his
beautiful silver hair

494
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,916
and the way it
sparkles in the sunlight,

495
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,416
the way his luscious
lashes caress his cheeks

496
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,916
when his eyes
are closed,

497
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,083
his sweet,
sweet voice.

498
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:38,833
I love everything.
Yuki is my everything.

499
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:40,333
Aaaah, Yuki!

500
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:42,541
It is my fate to be
forever cursed and blessed

501
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:44,458
by visions of
your angelic face.

502
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:47,083
Like a prick upon the
thorn of a rose, your love--

503
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:49,833
For the love of--
Keep it down Motoko!

504
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:51,291
You're waking
the neighbors!

505
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:53,541
Mother! Haven't you
ever heard of knocking?

506
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:54,875
Sure! "Knock,
knock, knock!

507
00:23:54,958 --> 00:23:56,750
Can I come in
Princess Loudmouth?"

508
00:23:56,833 --> 00:23:57,916
It wouldn't
be like this

509
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,541
if I hadn't been born
a year too early!

510
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:01,750
What in the world are
you babbling about now?
