1
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:18,125
<i>I was so happy when you smiled,</i>

2
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:21,708
<i>Your smile breaks</i>
<i>through the clouds of grey,</i>

3
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:28,625
<i>Far from the sunny days</i>
<i>that lie in sleep.</i>

4
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:31,583
<i>Waiting with patience</i>
<i>for the Spring,</i>

5
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:35,583
<i>when the flowers will</i>
<i>bloom renewed again,</i>

6
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:42,625
<i>knowing there's more</i>
<i>beyond the pain of today.</i>

7
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:49,000
<i>Although the scars</i>
<i>of yesterday remain,</i>

8
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:56,458
<i>You can go on living as</i>
<i>much as your heart believes.</i>

9
00:00:56,541 --> 00:01:02,958
<i>You can't be born again</i>
<i>although you can change.</i>

10
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:09,666
<i>Let's stay together always.</i>

11
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:30,875
Hi, I'm
Tohru Honda.

12
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:34,208
Eighteen months ago, I lost
my mom in a car accident.

13
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:37,041
I should feel depressed.
But I'm not, really.

14
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:38,833
I can still enjoy watching
the clouds float by

15
00:01:38,916 --> 00:01:41,541
on a beautiful
day like today.

16
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:43,875
And the reason I'm
able to smile, I think,

17
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:45,708
is because I've gotten
to share so much time

18
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:48,083
with the wonderful
Sohma family.

19
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:51,250
No!

20
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:55,125
Oh no! My bag...
my bag has torn.

21
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:58,041
Here! Let me help
you with that!

22
00:01:58,125 --> 00:01:59,958
No, please. You
don't have to.

23
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:01,750
I don't want to put
you to any trouble.

24
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:04,541
It's okay! I don't mind
at all! I'm happy to help!

25
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:07,166
I am so,
so sorry.

26
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,083
I can't seem to go anywhere
without causing problems

27
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:10,583
for everyone
around me.

28
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:12,916
I'm just a born
troublemaker, I suppose.

29
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:18,500
It's true. I'm so worthless I
can't even carry a paper bag.

30
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:20,000
I don't deserve to
share the same air

31
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:21,708
with the rest of
the human race.

32
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:24,833
I'm a blemish on the face of
the world. What was I thinking?

33
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:27,791
A low-life like me should never
have come to visit Shigure.

34
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:31,083
Aaaaah! I'm sorry! I
apologize to the world!

35
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:32,541
To the whole
universe!

36
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:34,458
I'm sorry I
came here today!

37
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:38,125
Um... Are you...
are you Ritsu?

38
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,041
Aaaaah! My
reputation precedes me!

39
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:44,833
I'm so infamous that
even a complete stranger

40
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:45,958
knows my name!

41
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:49,375
I'm such a terrible
person! I'm sorry!

42
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:50,791
I'm sorry world!

43
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:52,625
I apologize to all the
people who are forced

44
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:54,625
to share the
same name as me!

45
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm begging of you!
Please! Forgive me!

46
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:02,041
[Tohru] So this
is Ritsu...

47
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:04,625
My, this is unexpected.
The ever-timid Ritsu

48
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:07,250
has decided to venture
out and pay me a visit.

49
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,791
Oh...
yes... I...

50
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,625
I'm... s-sorry for all
the trouble I caused Tohru

51
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:12,125
in front of
the house...

52
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:14,291
Oh no, please...
It was no trouble!

53
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:15,583
I'm just happy
to have finally

54
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,291
gotten a chance
to meet you!

55
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:18,500
You are?

56
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,000
Yes, and you seem like
a really sweet girl.

57
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:25,541
I first heard about Ritsu
on my trip to the hot spring.

58
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:27,833
She's the daughter of that nice
hostess who runs the resort.

59
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:31,166
Aaaah! I'm
sorry! I'm sorry!

60
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,750
You remind me so
much of your mother,

61
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:34,875
from the first
instant I saw you,

62
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:38,000
I knew right away
who you were!

63
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,500
Oh, and another thing--

64
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:42,750
Ritsu is also a member of
the zodiac! She's the monkey!

65
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:43,625
Did you know
that my own child

66
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:44,958
is a member
of the zodiac,

67
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,791
just like Master
Yuki and the others?

68
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:50,125
Yes, my child was born
under the sign of the monkey.

69
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:53,583
By the way, Ritsu, why is
it you're here, exactly?

70
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,500
I'm sorry! I'm not keeping
you from anything, am I?

71
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:57,416
Mm-hm!

72
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,708
I'm sorry!

73
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,166
There, there, settle
down. I was just kidding.

74
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,250
You really are just
like your mother.

75
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:03,750
You know, you'll be
all grown up soon.

76
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,375
You're going to have to learn
to hold yourself together

77
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,208
if you want to make
it on your own.

78
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:08,875
Y-yes.
I'm sorry.

79
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,208
Oh, but where
are my manners?

80
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,500
I never properly
introduced myself.

81
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:14,166
I'm Ritsu Sohma and I'm
sorry about earlier.

82
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,166
Oh, no it's okay!
I'm Tohru Honda.

83
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,750
It's very nice
to meet you!

84
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:21,083
I almost forgot. I have
something I wanted to give you.

85
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,416
[Shigure] Oh, what's
this? Presents?

86
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,000
Yes. I was going to
bring a fruits basket,

87
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:27,000
but then I didn't really know
what kind everyone liked,

88
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,333
so I brought some
fruit books instead!

89
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:32,541
I'm sorry. Do you
not like them?

90
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,541
No, they're
just fine.

91
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:37,791
Aaah! I'm so sorry!
I'm such a terrible guest!

92
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:38,625
I'll go by some
fruit right away!

93
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,041
Kidding.
Kidding!

94
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,375
It's all right. You
don't have to pretend.

95
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,458
You can tell
me the truth.

96
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:50,250
I know. I'm not worthy
of visiting your house.

97
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:51,375
No, that's not
true at all.

98
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,041
No, it's not!
Like I said,

99
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,708
I've been wanting to meet
you for a long time now.

100
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,291
I'm glad
you're here!

101
00:04:57,375 --> 00:05:00,166
Really, I am! It's made me very
happy to finally talk to you.

102
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:04,750
Thank you. You're
very kind to say that.

103
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:07,791
Actually, I've been looking
forward to meeting you, too.

104
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,166
Ever since I heard about
you from my mother.

105
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:12,083
Well, then, I guess we
both have something

106
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:13,666
to be happy
about!

107
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:18,583
She's such a pretty
girl when she smiles.

108
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,500
Do we have
a visitor?

109
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:23,000
It's been a long
time, Yuki.

110
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,958
Sorry for dropping
by unexpectedly.

111
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:27,916
You haven't changed,
especially the way you dress.

112
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:32,791
I'm sorry! Forgive me! I'll put
on something else right away!

113
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,375
No. Hasn't
changed a bit.

114
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:39,416
[Tohru] Ritsu!
Are you okay?

115
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,166
Uh-huh.

116
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,708
Well, in that case, why
don't I make you some tea?

117
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:45,375
Thank you
very much.

118
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:46,666
Try to be
nice, Yuki.

119
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,583
It took Ri a lot of
courage to visit us today.

120
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,500
And for a very noble
cause, I might add.

121
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:52,625
You came all
the way here

122
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:54,333
just to meet Tohru,
isn't that right?

123
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:58,791
I guess it has
been a while.

124
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:01,000
I saw your mother a few months
ago, at the hot spring.

125
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,833
Anyway, how
have you been?

126
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:05,416
Oh, I've been all right.
How long has it been?

127
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,416
I don't even remember! But
you seem to be doing well.

128
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,125
It's amazing. Since
I saw you last,

129
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:12,333
you've gotten to look even
more like your brother!

130
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,166
Well, goodbye then.

131
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,166
Oh! What? What did I do?
Did I say something wrong?!

132
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,500
Oh, I've offended him. I
shouldn't be allowed to speak.

133
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:21,666
Every time I
open my mouth,

134
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,500
I make everyone around
me uncomfortable!

135
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,083
Well, that
is true.

136
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:28,083
Oh, you're right! I'm the most
annoying person in the world!

137
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:30,375
I'm sorry I bothered you!
I'll leave right now!

138
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,500
Forgive me! I should
have never stayed so long!

139
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,375
Wait, don't leave yet. I
mean, you just got here,

140
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:36,375
and you came all this
way and everything.

141
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:38,541
Besides, I still have
to serve you your tea.

142
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,250
No, please. Don't bother
yourself over me.

143
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,500
I'm not
worth it.

144
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,083
Sure you are! And it's
no bother at all.

145
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:45,083
Actually, it's my
pleasure! Stay a while!

146
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,125
You've already given me
enough with your kind words.

147
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,583
I couldn't possibly let you
do anything else for me!

148
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,208
No, really!
I want to!

149
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,875
No, really! You
don't have to--

150
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:54,750
Oh-h no!

151
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,000
Miss Honda?
Are you okay?

152
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:59,083
Yes, I'm fine, but...
but what about Ritsu?

153
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:03,291
Ahhh! What
have I done?

154
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,541
What sort of low-life am I,
to destroy my host's property!

155
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,166
Um, I think it
was my fault...

156
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,875
I'm sorry!!!!!!!

157
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:11,708
I apologize for being
such a terrible guest!

158
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:13,666
I'll apologize to
the entire universe!

159
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,708
Ritsu!
Watch out!

160
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:22,875
Huh? Um, why did, uh...
Why did she transform?

161
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:26,291
I mean, when she's
a girl then...

162
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:31,083
B-blood!
Blood!

163
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,083
[Yuki]
Miss Honda!

164
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:33,916
[Tohru] Um, what
just happened?

165
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:35,875
So, anyway, I
was wondering

166
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:37,833
if you could come take
a look at Tohru's cut.

167
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,458
That is, when you think
you can spare the time.

168
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:41,750
Fine. I'll stop by the
house this evening.

169
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:44,666
Uh? Ah-haa...
What's this, Hatori?

170
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,791
I don't think I've
ever heard you

171
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:47,958
sound so eager
to come over...

172
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:49,916
Could it be you have a
secret crush on Tohru?

173
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,541
Ah! I guessed right, didn't I!
You naughty, naughty man, you!

174
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:57,958
No. I was simply too amazed by
your stupidity to say anything.

175
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:01,458
So, actually,
Ritsu's a boy.

176
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:04,291
But for whatever reason, he's
always dressed like a girl

177
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:05,708
ever since he
was a child.

178
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:08,750
Oh, so that's what happened.
I really had no idea!

179
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,541
It didn't even occur to
me that he wasn't a girl.

180
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,625
There you go. Not
too tight, is it?

181
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,875
Thanks, it much
better now.

182
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:18,875
So, why is it that Ritsu
dresses like a girl?

183
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:21,250
Because he feels more
comfortable that way.

184
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,875
Ri is naturally a
very timid person.

185
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:25,208
And when he's
dressed like a girl,

186
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:27,041
he doesn't feel as much
pressure to be assertive.

187
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,791
I suppose that
makes sense.

188
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,625
By the way, did anyone
happen to see where he went?

189
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:35,208
Oh, dear God,
please punish me.

190
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,958
Send a bolt of lightning
to strike me down!

191
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:39,291
Oh no, Ritsu!
What are you doing?

192
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:42,208
Oh my. How did
he get up there?

193
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:45,791
Oh, Tohru. I know nothing I can
say will change what I've done,

194
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:48,208
but I am sorry for
injuring you so badly.

195
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:50,916
No, I'm okay, really!
It was only a scratch!

196
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,041
I also apologize
for not telling you

197
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:56,208
I was a boy when we
met. I was too ashamed!

198
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:57,000
No, it's okay!

199
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,208
So he does
know that

200
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:00,416
dressing like a girl
is strange, after all.

201
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,458
It didn't bother me that you
were wearing girls' clothes!

202
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,500
In fact, I thought you looked
really cute in that dress!

203
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:07,333
Tohru, I'm not sure that's
really going to help right now.

204
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:11,625
Ahh... Why? Why am I so stupid?
Why can't I do anything right?

205
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:12,958
No matter how
hard I try,

206
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:15,791
I do nothing but cause
trouble wherever I go!

207
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:18,500
Well, that's certainly
been the case today.

208
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,125
I'm a complete
failure.

209
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:23,125
At everything I do, I'm
absolutely worthless.

210
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:24,500
I know this, and
yet I continue

211
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,625
to burden the human
race with my presence.

212
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:29,583
Every day, I rob the world
of valuable air by breathing.

213
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:33,083
I'm a thief! And I
hate myself for it!

214
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:35,083
I don't deserve
to exist!

215
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:37,375
But even though I know
it's the right thing to do,

216
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:40,125
I'm such a
useless coward.

217
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:41,875
I don't even have
the courage to jump!

218
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:44,291
No! Don't!
Don't jump!

219
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:48,208
It's okay if you don't
have that kind of courage!

220
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:51,041
The important thing
is, you're alive.

221
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:53,708
And life hurts sometimes, and
sometimes it can be hard,

222
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:57,583
but it won't
always be that way.

223
00:09:57,666 --> 00:10:00,041
There's got to be a
reason for you to live.

224
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,083
[Tohru] Ritsu!

225
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,875
My ankle, I've
twisted it.

226
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,250
So ends that
little adventure.

227
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,583
I'm going
inside.

228
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:26,958
Um... but... uh...

229
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,208
Shigure told me that
Tohru had been injured,

230
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:32,708
but he didn't say anything
about you being hurt as well.

231
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,583
I know. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

232
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:39,250
Well, Ha'ri, it's been
a long, strange day.

233
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:40,875
Now, where
were you hurt?

234
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,083
Oh...
here... See?

235
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:45,166
I cut my hand, but
it's fine now.

236
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,958
Yuki gave me a bandage, and
really took good care of me.

237
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:49,208
Did he?

238
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,375
Uh-huh! I didn't realize
Shigure had called you.

239
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,916
I'm sorry to make you come
all the way here for nothing.

240
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,958
But thanks for
thinking about me!

241
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,083
Um... excuse
me, Shigure?

242
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,083
I was just
wondering...

243
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:03,250
Would you
mind terribly

244
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,000
if I stayed at your
house for the night?

245
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,541
Well, this is
a surprise.

246
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,541
Trying to be more
assertive, are we?

247
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,750
Yes, I'm
trying.

248
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,875
What the hell are Ritsu
and Hatori doing here?

249
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:15,333
I'm sorry!
I'm so sorry!

250
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,708
It's been three days
since Ritsu came to visit.

251
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:25,833
I think there's
definitely something

252
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,375
on his mind that's
troubling him,

253
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:28,416
and a couple times,
it seemed like

254
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,416
he was about to
say something.

255
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,083
But whatever it is, so far
he's kept it to himself.

256
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:35,541
I hope I put in
enough seasoning.

257
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,000
It's not too
bland is it?

258
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,375
Not at all. It's
quite tasty.

259
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,958
Good, I'm glad
you like it.

260
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:43,291
She's great,
isn't she?

261
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:44,666
Yes, I'll bet right
now you're wishing

262
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,583
you had a cute little
housewife of your very own!

263
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:49,500
You know, you really shouldn't
make such stupid comments.

264
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,208
'Cause I'm gonna knock
you through the roof!

265
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:53,291
Oh-h, Kyo. I didn't
see you there.

266
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,958
No one's the little housewife
of anyone, got it?!

267
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:57,916
And if I hear you say it again,
I'm gonna snap you in two!

268
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,208
Help! Kyo is
scaring me!

269
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:01,208
Bastard.

270
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:03,000
Well, anyway. Good
morning, Kyo!

271
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:05,166
And you! You could at least
be a little bit angry!

272
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,416
Oh... Uh...

273
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,041
[Kyo] You shouldn't let
that stupid dog get away

274
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,958
with saying that
stuff all the time!

275
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:13,208
Settle down, Kyo. Jealousy
is very unbecoming.

276
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:15,125
It's not like that! So
don't start with me!

277
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:16,583
Hell, what are you
even doin' here?

278
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:19,333
Oh, well Hatori's been
looking after Ritsu, you know,

279
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:21,250
to make sure his ankle's
getting better and everything.

280
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:23,750
Forget I
asked! Jeez!

281
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,541
Yeah, that's just perfect.
We're out of milk.

282
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,916
Uh... I'm sorry! I
completely forgot!

283
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,375
I'll run out to the store
right now and get some more!

284
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:33,041
No, I-- you don't
have to do that.

285
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:35,458
Yes, I do. It's my
responsibility to make sure

286
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:36,708
we have all the
things we need.

287
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:37,958
So I should go--

288
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:39,541
Aaah! I'm sorry! It's
not her fault! It's me!

289
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:40,958
I'm the one
to blame!

290
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:42,541
I'm the one who wanted to
have cereal for breakfast!

291
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,041
And I'm the one who
selfishly allowed Tohru

292
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:47,166
to pour the last of the milk
into my bowl! I'm so sorry!

293
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,375
I'm the
guilty one!

294
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:49,875
I'm the evil person
who should be punished!

295
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:55,375
Please! Don't blame
her! Punish me! Aaah!

296
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,541
Oh yeah. he's
still here, too.

297
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:00,583
I'm sorry! Not only did I come
to Shigure's house uninvited,

298
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:01,916
but then I was
so bold as to ask

299
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,416
if I could stay
for one night!

300
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,666
Only now I've imposed on
you for three whole days!

301
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,041
And to make
things worse,

302
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:08,416
Um...
Ritsu?

303
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,541
If you're going to flail
about the kitchen like this,

304
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,041
at least put down
your bowl first.

305
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,833
Here, Kyo. You can take
the rest of the milk

306
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,541
from my cereal.
Please, I insist.

307
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,041
Over my
dead body.

308
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:19,041
But, what else can I do
to make this up to you?

309
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,541
What do
you think?

310
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,041
You can march down to the
store and buy some more milk!

311
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,375
Wait.
Don't yell.

312
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:24,541
What's all
the noise?

313
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:25,833
Oh! Good
morning!

314
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:27,583
It looks like
someone overslept.

315
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:30,666
Ah! I'm sorry, I should
have woken you up!

316
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,541
Now you're going to
be late for school,

317
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:32,750
and it's all
my fault!

318
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:33,750
Oh, that's
the noise.

319
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,458
You'll be punished
for being tardy!

320
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:37,000
Possibly expelled
from school!

321
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,541
I'm so sorry! I've
ruined your life!

322
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,416
I thought I taught you
guys this already.

323
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,625
Here. Watch closely.

324
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,416
It's the
magic touch!

325
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,916
I don't even
wanna know.

326
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,875
I think I'm going
back to bed.

327
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:55,083
You know Ri, you really could
stand to relax a little.

328
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,875
Yes, I'm sorry.

329
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:59,625
And you don't always have
to apologize for everything.

330
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,875
In fact, that probably causes
more problems than it solves,

331
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,541
especially the
way you do it.

332
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:06,833
Shigure still hasn't grasped
the concept of 'tact', I see.

333
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,375
To be a more
confident person,

334
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:10,291
you have to start
acting like one.

335
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:11,500
That is what you
want, isn't it?

336
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:14,375
Yes it is, more than
anything in the world!

337
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:17,166
Someday, I hope to be just
as confident as Ayame!

338
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,666
[Shigure] No.
That's impossible.

339
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,458
You're right. It's
hopeless, isn't it?

340
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:23,125
Well, I'd say it's
unrealistic at the very least.

341
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:25,833
When it comes to confidence,
Aya's is off the scale.

342
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:27,083
I think what
Shigure means is,

343
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,916
it's good to have
a long-term goal,

344
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
but it might be
better to start

345
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,666
with more reasonable,
immediate goals.

346
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,708
Just try not to be
too hard on yourself.

347
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,208
Oh, okay.

348
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,958
[Shigure] Well, right! Yes!
That's exactly what I said!

349
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,000
[Hatori] No
it wasn't.

350
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:46,750
I'm so sorry! So
very, very sorry!

351
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:47,875
Please! I
beg of you!

352
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:55,000
I'm sorry. Mommy,
Daddy, I'm so sorry!

353
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,458
Poor
Ritsu.

354
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,875
He has such a
sweet smile.

355
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,125
And I'm so glad
I got to see it,

356
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:11,375
because I don't think
it happens too often.

357
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:14,750
Just like Yuki, and Kyo,
and all of the other Sohmas,

358
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,083
he blames himself
for everything

359
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,250
that's happened
in his life.

360
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:24,166
Why was I ever even
born into this world?

361
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:28,166
I'm so happy
you're here.

362
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,083
I really am. And
you know, Tohru,

363
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:31,583
everyday that you're
here with me,

364
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,875
since the first
day you were born,

365
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:36,250
I have a reason
to smile.

366
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:38,916
But I'm always here,
silly! You're my mommy!

367
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,250
I was born to
be with you!

368
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,791
Well, I guess that's
why I'm always happy!

369
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:51,916
No! No! I'm sorry!
Please, forgive me!

370
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,583
I'm sorry I can't give
these to you right now!

371
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:54,833
I'll come back,

372
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,250
and I'll buy some more
jelly buns just for you!

373
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,375
But these aren't mine! I
have to give them to Shigure!

374
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,291
I'm so sorry! I
apologize to you!

375
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,750
Uh, Ritsu?

376
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,333
So those are
for Shigure?

377
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:07,083
Uh-huh. He asked me
to pick them up.

378
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,666
He said he just couldn't write
without some fresh jelly buns!

379
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:12,083
Yeah, that sounds like
something he'd say.

380
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:17,375
Um!

381
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:18,916
Yes? Were you going
to say something?

382
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,333
No, no, Tohru, you were
going to say something first.

383
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:23,583
No, really, I don't mind.
Please, go right ahead.

384
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,833
No, really, that's all
right. After you, please.

385
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:27,000
Oh, no, I
just couldn't!

386
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,625
Me either!

387
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:30,291
Um, you know,
for some reason

388
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:32,916
I don't think this is
really getting us anywhere.

389
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,125
Why don't you go first,
Ritsu? Please, I insist!

390
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,791
O-okay.

391
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:40,416
I wanted to ask
you something.

392
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,250
Oh?

393
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:45,750
Um, I was wondering when
you talked to my mother...

394
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:53,041
Did she say anything to you?
Well, anything bad about me?

395
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,166
I'm sorry. Now I've
made you uncomfortable.

396
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,000
It was wrong of me to ask
a question like that.

397
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,916
Forgive me, please.

398
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,375
It's just I know my
parents are disappointed

399
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:03,708
to have ever had
a child like me.

400
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:05,166
Of course, I
understand perfectly

401
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,833
why it is they
feel that way.

402
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:09,125
I'm the most useless
person I know.

403
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:11,208
It's bad enough being
born with the Sohma curse,

404
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:13,083
but I don't have a single
talent to make up for it

405
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,333
like the other
Zodiac members.

406
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:17,375
I'm not particularly
smart, or athletic.

407
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:20,750
In everything I do,
I'm average at best.

408
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:23,375
It's a well-known fact
among the Sohma family,

409
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,666
how useless I am.

410
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,333
It seems my parents
have been apologizing

411
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:30,416
for me my
whole life.

412
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,875
When I was young I found
that dressing like a girl

413
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:37,458
made me feel more
comfortable somehow, safe.

414
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,875
But any time I do it, it
only makes my parents

415
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,666
have to apologize
for me even more.

416
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,166
I want to be a more
confident person.

417
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,125
I've tried to stop
dressing like a girl.

418
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:54,625
But I'm not confident.
I couldn't do it.

419
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:58,416
I'm a complete failure,
just a worthless coward.

420
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,416
It tears me
apart inside.

421
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,708
I don't want my
mother and father

422
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:09,000
to have to apologize
for me anymore.

423
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:12,708
I want them to have a child
that they can be proud of.

424
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:18,125
A much better
child than me.

425
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:22,666
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

426
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:27,750
It might even be better for
them if I wasn't here at all.

427
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:30,958
And really, there's no good
reason for me to stay.

428
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:35,125
There's no reason for
my ever being born.

429
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:37,458
I may have believed that
there was, at one time.

430
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:40,625
But even if I did,
it's gone now.

431
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:46,083
Knowing this, how can
I still be so bold

432
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:50,916
as to burden the world with
my pathetic, useless life?

433
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,708
[Tohru] We're all searching
for a meaning to our lives.

434
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,375
Everyone...

435
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,250
We have to.

436
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:05,291
Because, no matter
who you are,

437
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:06,708
I don't think
anyone is born

438
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:09,041
knowing the reason
why they're here.

439
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:11,541
It's just something you have
to find as you go along.

440
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,750
And it... it's
different for everyone.

441
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,083
There are as many
reasons to live

442
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:24,416
as there are people in the
world, maybe even more.

443
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,791
So, the reason
for being born,

444
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,625
the reason you've been
put here in the world,

445
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:33,125
I think it's something we all
have to find for ourselves.

446
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:36,541
So we search within
our hopes and dreams,

447
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:44,125
our work, the people in our
lives, in everything we do.

448
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:47,208
And even if the reason we
find seems hazy or unclear,

449
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:50,416
even if it's so tiny that
you can hardly see it,

450
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,541
the important thing is
that you always have one.

451
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,625
As long as I'm alive,
that's what I want,

452
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:59,958
to have a
reason to go on.

453
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:04,250
And you know, you
can always find one

454
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,500
if you know
where to look.

455
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:10,250
The people in my life give
me a reason for living.

456
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:13,375
I want to live my life for
the people that I care about.

457
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,208
And someday, I hope
I'll find someone

458
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:18,458
who wants to live
their life for me.

459
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:21,333
So even when things are
tough, and it's hard to go on,

460
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:25,375
it makes me want
to try harder.

461
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:32,250
Because I'm not just living for
me, I'm living for them, too.

462
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:35,166
And so, I think it's
good that you're bold,

463
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,583
that you're
still here.

464
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:37,750
'Cause you know,
the world really is

465
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:40,250
a much better place
with you in it!

466
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,750
Thank you.

467
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:51,375
I've wanted someone to
tell me those words again.

468
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,708
I needed to hear
them again.

469
00:20:57,291 --> 00:21:01,791
Maybe I will find it, my
reason for living, someday.

470
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:09,250
And maybe... maybe I can find
it in someone I care about.

471
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,958
I'd like that, to find
someone to live for,

472
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:15,666
to share my life with.
That would be good.

473
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,625
And when I do find
that special someone,

474
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:20,291
the first thing we'll
do is eat jelly buns.

475
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:27,000
I'd like that too, to
find that special person

476
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:31,333
I can share my life with,
and eat jelly buns.

477
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,208
I want to be able
to say to someone,

478
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:36,125
"I was born to
be with you."

479
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:39,625
And maybe, they'll want to
say those words to me, too.

480
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,833
Oh, Shigure must
be wondering

481
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:49,416
what's taking me
so long, by now.

482
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,666
Uh-huh.

483
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,916
But once we get there,
he's going to be able

484
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,875
to write his whole
novel in a day!

485
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:54,875
Oh?

486
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:56,083
Sure! With three
dozen jelly buns,

487
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:58,583
he'll have plenty
of inspiration!

488
00:21:58,666 --> 00:21:59,666
Oh...

489
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:06,916
<i>Now let's all gather,</i>

490
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,500
<i>Enjoying the company we share,</i>

491
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:17,791
<i>Our tears will dissolve</i>
<i>into thin air,</i>

492
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:23,750
<i>As we drink up</i>
<i>this wonderful life.</i>

493
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:28,708
<i>La, la, la...</i>

494
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:34,791
<i>Takin' in all the</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

495
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:39,875
<i>La, la, la...</i>

496
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:45,916
<i>Drinkin' up all this</i>
<i>good love and life.</i>

497
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
<i>La, la, la...</i>

498
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:56,791
<i>Take it in all this</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

499
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:27,375
[Kazuma] Tonight.
I plan to do it tonight.

500
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:29,083
And, whatever happens,

501
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:32,333
I thought I should
warn you in advance.

502
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:34,541
[Shigure] I see.
So, what led you

503
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:36,750
to this decision
all of the sudden?

504
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:40,750
[Kazuma] I think this girl could
open his heart and accept him.

505
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:44,250
[Shigure] What will
this do to her?

506
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:48,541
Kazuma? Are you truly prepared
to trust her with everything?

507
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:50,041
[Kazuma] I wonder if
you might be so good

508
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:53,375
as to loan me a moment of
your time this evening?

509
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:54,333
[Tohru] Sure.
