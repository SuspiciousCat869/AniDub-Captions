1
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:18,125
<i>I was so happy when you smiled,</i>

2
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:21,708
<i>Your smile breaks</i>
<i>through the clouds of grey,</i>

3
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:28,625
<i>Far from the sunny days</i>
<i>that lie in sleep.</i>

4
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:31,583
<i>Waiting with patience</i>
<i>for the Spring,</i>

5
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:35,583
<i>when the flowers will</i>
<i>bloom renewed again,</i>

6
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:42,625
<i>knowing there's more</i>
<i>beyond the pain of today.</i>

7
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:49,000
<i>Although the scars</i>
<i>of yesterday remain,</i>

8
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:56,458
<i>You can go on living as</i>
<i>much as your heart believes.</i>

9
00:00:56,541 --> 00:01:02,958
<i>You can't be born again</i>
<i>although you can change.</i>

10
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:09,666
<i>Let's stay together always.</i>

11
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:38,291
What is that?

12
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:40,416
Sounds like
she's here early.

13
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,208
Oh, I didn't know you
were expecting anyone...

14
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:45,583
Ah-ah, not so fast, Kyo...

15
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:56,041
Hello?

16
00:01:56,125 --> 00:02:00,083
Strange...
There's no one here...

17
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:02,416
But I distinctly remember
closing that door...

18
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,041
So somebody must have-

19
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,458
Are you Tohru Honda?

20
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:09,458
Uhhh... yes?

21
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:13,333
Oh, um... Well
that's-I mean, umm...

22
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:14,333
Yes?

23
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:20,083
I'm... Kagura...
That's my name. Kagura Sohma.

24
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:23,125
Kagura Sohma... Hi.

25
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,500
Ah, what a cute
little girl...

26
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:28,916
Please, I... I heard
that Kyo was here, and-

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,333
Please tell me
it's true? Is he?

28
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:34,750
Oh.. Yes, of
course. Kyo's here.

29
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:36,583
Would you like to
come in and see him?

30
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:37,750
Kyo...?

31
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,583
Kagura!

32
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:46,250
I don't believe it... It...
It's really you! Kyo! KYO!

33
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,708
I wonder...

34
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:49,500
Sohma's a pretty
common name, I guess.

35
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,375
So it could just be
a coincidence...

36
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:53,458
But maybe...
Maybe it means

37
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,708
she's one of the
Zodiac animals, too!

38
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:57,333
Kyo!

39
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:59,208
Why did you run
away for so long?

40
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:03,333
You didn't call me...
Or send a card...

41
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:06,541
Where were you?
Oh darling...

42
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:09,416
I missed you SO MUCH!

43
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:15,791
Love! You had me
worried sick!

44
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,041
Well, it appears
we'll be needing

45
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,458
another door,
doesn't it.

46
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,166
Sometimes it feels like
the whole world

47
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,541
is conspiring to
destroy my house...

48
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:28,416
I'm.. sorry...

49
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,375
Oh, I was just kidding...
This is normal.

50
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:33,166
It's Kagura's way of
showing affection.

51
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,208
I would have
never guessed...

52
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:36,708
So then... from
the looks of it,

53
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:39,416
she must really
like Kyo a lot...

54
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,250
Kagura does tend to get
a little carried away

55
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,166
with her emotions...

56
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,791
That's especially true
when she's around Kyo...

57
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:48,666
You might not believe it, but
she's two years older than us.

58
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,375
Than you... She's also
part of the zodiac.

59
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:54,666
Oh, I knew it! That's
great! Which animal is she?

60
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,541
I figured that would have
been obvious at this point.

61
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,375
[Kagura] Do you even think
about my feelings? No!

62
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:03,458
I'm sorry, I uh, I guess I've
been a little distracted.

63
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:11,375
Kyo? Darling? What happened?
You're hurt! Oh, no, no!

64
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:14,125
Speak to me! Who
did this to you?!

65
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,666
Um... you, I think.

66
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,041
It's cold in here...

67
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:22,916
Yes, I noticed that too.

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,541
I'm sorry... But, when I
saw Kyo I got so happy...

69
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:32,708
all my love just came out
at once... I couldn't help it.

70
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:35,875
It's like she's become a
totally different person...

71
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:38,500
But it is really your
fault too, Kyo...

72
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,000
If you'd just
remembered to call me,

73
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,125
you wouldn'tve made
me miss you so hard!

74
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:44,875
Who says I forgot? Maybe I
didn't want to call you!

75
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:48,375
Oh, silly, yes you did... We
are getting married, after all.

76
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:49,625
Since when?!

77
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:51,125
You mean you
don't remember?

78
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,958
When we were kids! You
asked me to marry you!

79
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:56,125
Only 'cause you were
gonna kill me if I didn't!

80
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:59,000
Oh, so the two of you are
engaged! That's wonderful!

81
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,541
At least now, he'll
have someone else

82
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,250
to fight
instead of me...

83
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:03,125
Congratulations.

84
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:04,375
You guys!

85
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:05,875
We really do make
the best couple,

86
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:08,541
since we're both members
of the Zodiac...

87
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,208
Well, Kyo's not
officially a member,

88
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:12,666
but he's still cursed,
so it's almost the same...

89
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,666
We can still
understand each other

90
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,416
in a way that no
one else can...

91
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,916
And that's good...

92
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,250
But the best thing is we can
hug each other all we want,

93
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,250
and we don't
transform!

94
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:25,458
I don't believe it!
Kyo didn't turn into a cat!

95
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:28,166
See! It's okay for
Zodiac members to hug!

96
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,291
Why is that?

97
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,166
It's a mystery
to us, too.

98
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,625
Though we've seen
it enough to know

99
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,166
it isn't just a
fluke with Kagura...

100
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,416
She's one of a
kind, granted,

101
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,375
but she's not the only
girl in the Zodiac...

102
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:39,958
Really? There are
more girls?

103
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,541
Do you think I'll get
to meet them some day?

104
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:45,208
Kyo! You have to tell me! And
be honest! Do you love me?

105
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,208
Do you hate me? Because
I love you! I do!

106
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:48,750
More than anything else
in the whole wide world!

107
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:49,958
Uhhh...

108
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,041
I'll prove it!
I'll cook for you! Everyday!

109
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:53,708
I'll do anything!
Even if you cheat on me,

110
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,333
I can forgive a
one-time fling!

111
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:58,583
No one else loves you this
much, do they? No! Just me!

112
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,375
We should always be
together, don't you think?

113
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:04,125
I just told you what you think!
Now say something, dammit!

114
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:07,416
Ahh, it pains
my heart...

115
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,875
But moving on- Tohru,
correct me if I'm wrong,

116
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:12,458
but aren't you something
of a cat lover yourself?

117
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:14,458
That's me! The Year
of the Cat Fan Club!

118
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,833
Rival.

119
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,458
But I'm not
going to lose!

120
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:20,458
Tohru, what do you like
best about Kyo?

121
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:23,166
Because I like
everything! Everything!

122
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,916
The good things,
the bad things-

123
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,958
I like them all!

124
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,041
I love Kyo no
matter what,

125
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,583
even if he changes
into his other fo-

126
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:35,750
Shut your mouth,
right now.

127
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:38,541
One more word,
and... and I'll...

128
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,458
And you'll WHAT, love?!

129
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:44,625
You should call
"mercy", Kyo...

130
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,541
Ah, I almost forgot
about the laundry!

131
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:49,791
Laundry?

132
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,541
It's too bad I didn't
get a chance to hear

133
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,625
which Zodiac
animal Kagura is...

134
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,958
Oh well, who knows... I can
ask her myself someday...

135
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:03,166
I do hope the two of
us get to be friends.

136
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,875
That's not Kyo's
shirt, is it?

137
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,500
I didn't see
you there!

138
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,583
So, is that
Kyo's shirt?

139
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:11,500
No, not yet. These
are Yuki's clothes.

140
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:12,500
I haven't even
started on Kyo's...

141
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:14,458
but they're
next on the list.

142
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:15,625
Don't worry,
I'll do it!

143
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:17,958
If that's okay with
you. It is, right?

144
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:19,208
I don't know...

145
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:21,416
I said I'll do it!
I really want to!

146
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,458
So please,
please can I?

147
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:27,583
Oh, ah... well...
Okay! If you insist.

148
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:30,791
Yaye! Thank
you so much!

149
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,208
Don't mention it...

150
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:34,708
Kyo! Okay, take
everything off!

151
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:36,708
Stop it!
What are you doing?!

152
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:38,750
Your laundry, silly!
Now take off your clothes!

153
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:42,250
Or do I have to wash
you along with them?!

154
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:45,500
Where are you going?

155
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:46,791
Away from you!!

156
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,458
Ah! Kyo!

157
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,333
Don't worry. I'm sure
he'll wander back

158
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:51,750
when he gets hungry.

159
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,708
Oh. What's the matter?

160
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:02,833
Why is Kyo so mad at me?
I don't understand.

161
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:05,291
You know... he might
not really be angry.

162
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,041
Sometimes he
just doesn't-

163
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:11,333
That stink! How could
you let him wear this?

164
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:12,833
My poor,
sweet darling!

165
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:14,208
You'll have clean
clothes from now on,

166
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,625
or I'm not the future
Mrs. Kyo Sohma!

167
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,041
I guess if you don't
need anything,

168
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:19,875
I'll just go hang up
Yuki's shirts now...

169
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:23,541
Let's see...
how much detergent? hmm...

170
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,750
Maybe a little bit more...

171
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:30,000
One more scoop, for love. Ooh!
Better yet, the whole thing!

172
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:31,208
Ah, there
you are...

173
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:33,666
Are you still going
out to shop for dinner?

174
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,958
Oh. Uh-huh.

175
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,208
I'll come
with you.

176
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:37,375
Sure.

177
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:42,583
Oh, yeah...

178
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,041
Perfect.

179
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:49,291
Now when Kyo comes home,

180
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:53,875
he can have a nice,
fresh cup of tea!

181
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:55,708
I'm guessing you've
noticed by now.

182
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,875
It would be sort
of hard not to...

183
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,458
But Kagura has a bit
of a one-track mind

184
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:01,166
when it
comes to Kyo.

185
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,625
She's had her heart
set on marrying him

186
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,625
since we were
little kids,

187
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:06,833
for whatever that's worth.
It's pretty silly, I know...

188
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:09,208
Oh no, not at all!
I think it's amazing.

189
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,125
Uh... you... do?

190
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:14,458
I mean, that kind of devotion
is pretty rare, you know?

191
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,000
To like someone so
much for that long...

192
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:19,541
It's really
wonderful, isn't it?

193
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,250
I hadn't thought
of it like that.

194
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,208
In fact... I think
she'd be a great person

195
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:26,041
to have as a friend.

196
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:29,458
You should try. I think you'd
be a good influence on her.

197
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:32,916
I don't know about that...
But it's nice of you to say...

198
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,041
"Kyo! Q! I love you!"-
Waah-ha!! No more smell!

199
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,416
I'm a perfect wife!

200
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,458
Finally... Now I just
gotta get my shirt back,

201
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,416
then I get the
hell outta here...

202
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,666
Maybe I should wring it out a
little to make it dry faster!

203
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,375
Dry! Damn... you!!

204
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,333
Uh...

205
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:56,333
Tell me you didn't do
what I just think you did!

206
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:58,083
My love...

207
00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,083
My shirt!

208
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:02,041
And I really liked
this one, too...

209
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,291
I'm sorry, darling...

210
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,791
I promise, I'll
fix it right away...

211
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,666
Here, you can wear
this one 'til then.

212
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,333
It's soaking wet!

213
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,583
But, that's because
I washed it for you.

214
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:13,750
Is there anything of
mine you didn't wash!

215
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,166
Your pants...

216
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,625
What am I supposed to do now?!
Go around half-naked?!

217
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:18,916
You want me to get
pneumonia, is that it?!

218
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:25,541
Kagura... how much
detergent did you use?

219
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,791
All of it!

220
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:29,541
Is something burning?

221
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,250
Oh no, the tea!

222
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:37,791
Coming through.

223
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:42,625
Don't we look lovely.

224
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,625
I can't believe
you're laughing.

225
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:47,208
Oh, right...
'Now I'm mad'.

226
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:51,083
I... I'm sorry...
I didn't do it on purpose...

227
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,500
I know that, Kagura.

228
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:55,166
You still did it!

229
00:10:55,250 --> 00:11:02,500
I'm sorry... I really am...
Please, Kyo... I'm sorry..

230
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:06,083
Yeah, so what "sorry" isn't
going to get us a new kitchen.

231
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:12,041
What do you want
me to do?!

232
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,250
Oooh! That hurts!

233
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:23,791
Well, you see...
It- It's a long story...

234
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:26,375
That's all right. I think
I can guess what happened.

235
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:28,791
Uhh... I'll help
you clean up.

236
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,208
I can do it.

237
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,541
But it's too much work
for you all by yourself.

238
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:35,291
No, please! Let me
do it! I want to...

239
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,833
It's my fault the
kitchen's like this...

240
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:39,125
At least she's
being consistent.

241
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:41,458
She wouldn't let
me help, either.

242
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:45,125
Please, it's okay...
I'll do it all.

243
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:48,000
Well... if you insist...

244
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,375
Do you really think it's
okay to leave her in there?

245
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:54,291
Don't worry. Kagura's
always been the resilient type.

246
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,250
I'm sure she just needs
some time to herself.

247
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,708
Of course, the real
crisis here,

248
00:11:58,791 --> 00:11:59,791
is that we won't be
able to cook any dinner

249
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,750
while the
kitchen's wrecked...

250
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,041
I guess we're just going
to have grit our teeth

251
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:04,875
and call
for take-out.

252
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,208
and I was so looking
forward to another

253
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:09,458
of Tohru's delicious
home-cooked meals.

254
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,833
So... where'd the
other home-wrecker go?

255
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:16,583
He's still busy
sulking, I think.

256
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,166
We'd probably do well to keep
our distance for a while...

257
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,666
I'm gonna burst...
Ahhh, full, full, full...

258
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,875
You, Miss Honda?

259
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,125
I couldn't eat
another bite.

260
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,958
Oh... but what about
Kagura and Kyo?

261
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,875
We shouldn't let their
dinners get cold.

262
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,250
Ah... so let's see...

263
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:36,500
Am I brave enough to go
look for Kyo just yet?

264
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:40,708
Mmm. No. But I think I
can chance the kitchen...

265
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:48,708
Kagura, you know we
ordered you some dinner...

266
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,791
I'm pretty sure it'll
taste better while it's hot.

267
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:53,791
Thanks, but...
I'll eat later...

268
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:56,750
You can just leave it
out there for now.

269
00:12:56,833 --> 00:13:00,500
How's Kyo?
Is he still angry?

270
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,083
Your guess is as
good as mine.

271
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:04,750
He still hasn't come
down from hiding.

272
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:07,708
You're angry at me
too, aren't you.

273
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:10,541
No, I wouldn't say
that. I'm not angry.

274
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:13,375
Of course... I can't
say I'd want to...

275
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:16,958
repeat this
little incident.

276
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:19,875
Shigure, please let
me stay here, too...

277
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:21,458
I don't think I can
leave knowing Kyo's

278
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,791
living in this house
with another woman.

279
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:27,458
Woman-? We're talking
about Tohru now, right?

280
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:28,833
No, I can't wait
that long!

281
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:31,000
I have to force Kyo to make
up his mind, tonight!

282
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:32,666
That's not a
good idea.

283
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,166
You don't know!

284
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,916
You don't understand how a
woman feels when she's in love!

285
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,583
Yes I do.

286
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:43,583
At least, I've felt enough
women to venture a guess.

287
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:46,500
Sorry. That's your cue to
say, "Shigure, you perv!"

288
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:48,875
And roll your eyes,
slap me, whatever.

289
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:54,041
Shigure! You... big... perv!

290
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:57,916
Ha ha ha ha! Pervert!
Pervert! Ha ha ha ha!

291
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,458
Everything's so clean...

292
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:11,375
Kagura and Kyo still
haven't eaten their dinners.

293
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,583
They must be starving.

294
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,666
Kagura...?

295
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:26,291
This'll take all
night. I know it.

296
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:30,375
Has she been working
this whole time?

297
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:35,083
I'm so hungry...

298
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,250
Hi there.

299
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:44,166
Um... I made you a snack.

300
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,958
I noticed you hadn't
eaten your dinner yet,

301
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,541
and I thought you
might be hungry...

302
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:51,375
So I made some rice
balls with the leftovers...

303
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,416
I hope it's okay that
I served them cold...

304
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,958
I can heat them
up if you want!

305
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:59,375
Eh... no... I like
them this way.

306
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:09,833
Okay then... Now
why don't we see

307
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:11,625
if we can't finish
fixing this door?

308
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:18,250
I thought it might make the job
more fun if we worked together.

309
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:21,125
Yes... That
would be nice...

310
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:22,125
Good!

311
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,541
Before we start...?

312
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:24,625
Yes?

313
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,500
Can I please have
one more riceball?

314
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,166
Sure!

315
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:39,375
Hey, lookie, lookie!

316
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:41,791
It's a cat, right?

317
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,916
It's so cute!

318
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,750
Uh-huh...

319
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,541
Look... I made one, too.

320
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,041
A little rat!

321
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:54,375
You can tell?

322
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:57,208
Sure I can!
It's adorable!

323
00:15:57,291 --> 00:16:01,333
Why thank you very much! I'll
put it up... right... here.

324
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:03,041
I'm gonna do
another one!

325
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,041
All right.
I will too!

326
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:05,875
Tohru, what are
you gonna make?

327
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:08,625
Let's see...
How about a dog?

328
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:11,250
Okay! Then I'll
make... another cat!

329
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,125
Ooh! And this time
I'll make the tail...

330
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:14,458
--Tohru?
--Yes?

331
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:18,625
Thank you... I hope we can
be friends from now on?

332
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:21,166
Yes... I'd like that.

333
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,666
Kyo...

334
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,708
You're not really planning
on staying up here

335
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,416
the whole
night, are you?

336
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,375
Better believe it.
Kagura's still down there!

337
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:40,875
You don't want
her to be here?

338
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,375
What do you think? You see
what happens when she's around.

339
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,916
It's always like
that. She's crazy!

340
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,083
And she won't
ever shut up

341
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:49,958
about all that stupid
"marriage" crap...

342
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:50,625
I can't stand it.

343
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,375
I think it's sweet.

344
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:53,666
When you have someone
who loves you

345
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,291
as much as
she does...

346
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:59,333
You should really feel
pretty lucky... You know?

347
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:02,791
And, I think every girl dreams
about getting married one day...

348
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:05,750
Kagura just dreams a
little... louder than most.

349
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:10,916
Here you go!

350
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:18,000
Kyo, you have a dream too,
don't you? To beat Yuki?

351
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:18,791
Isn't that why you were
up in the mountains

352
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,125
for so long?
Training?

353
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,833
Hm? Yeah- Oh.

354
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,875
Guess Shigure told you...

355
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:26,166
That must have
been really hard...

356
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,875
Being out there
all by yourself...

357
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:32,041
No. I wasn't alone.
I was with my master.

358
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:35,541
Oh. A master! He must
be really strong then.

359
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:36,916
Are you kidding?

360
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,875
He could flatten that sissy
rat-boy with one punch!

361
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,583
My master's as strong as
they come! He's a Sohma.

362
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:44,500
But he never treated
me like the others do.

363
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:45,416
He's been teaching
me how to fight

364
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,291
ever since I was
a little kid!

365
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,583
Sure, he put me through hell
up there in the mountains,

366
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:52,041
but those were some of
the best days of my life!

367
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:54,541
It's like every day was
an adventure, you know?

368
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,250
I'd wake up every
morning and ask myself,

369
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:57,458
"What's he
gonna teach me?"

370
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,833
"How much stronger am
I gonna get today?"

371
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,791
It was great!
Ahh... listen to me!

372
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:03,958
Just talking about
it gets me pumped up!

373
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:07,375
But this must seem
pretty stupid

374
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:08,583
to someone
like you, huh.

375
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,875
Oh! No! It's
fascinating!

376
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:12,083
I guess I just
don't really know

377
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,125
anything about
fighting, is all...

378
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:16,000
Not to say that I'm not
interested to learn!

379
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:17,250
And I mean, I do
know a little bit!

380
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:18,750
I have a couple moves
I can show you!

381
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:21,041
Um, let's see...
Right Straight!

382
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:27,416
You suck.

383
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:37,083
I think I've discovered
something else new about Kyo...

384
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:39,416
Underneath that angry
face he usually makes,

385
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,958
he's been hiding this
little awkward smile...

386
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:51,041
Kyo! Darling!

387
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:55,666
Goodbye my love! Take care
of yourself 'til I come back!

388
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,791
Glad to see everything's
back to normal.

389
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,375
Incidentally, did
you ever figure out

390
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:00,958
which animal
Kagura is?

391
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,291
No, not yet.

392
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:05,208
Kyo, be nice, or I'm not
gonna kiss you goodbye!

393
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:06,541
Who needs it?!

394
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:10,458
That's it! Kyo, you jerk!
I'm leaving you, Love!

395
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,000
Hello! It is I!

396
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,666
Your ever-reliable
local paperboy,

397
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,166
come to deliver the
news of the day!

398
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,125
This is bad.

399
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,666
Ah, thanks for
your hard work.

400
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,750
Oh sure... It's my job.

401
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:30,625
Sorry I was a little
late this morning. Bye!

402
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:37,000
Hey, I figured out Kagura's
zodiac animal! She's a boar!

403
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,291
Um... That's
cheating, I think.

404
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:43,208
Kagura... You know, I think I'm
beginning to understand better

405
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,458
why it is you like
Kyo so much...

406
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,875
He really does have a
lot of good qualities...

407
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,208
And the more I
learn about them,

408
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:52,458
the more I want see
him the way you do.

409
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,041
Kyo! You two-timer!

410
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,916
I thought she was going to
forgive his little flings...

411
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,750
I will forgive him!
Right after I kill him!

412
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,500
What the hell
did I do?!

413
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:07,416
'Scuse me... Maybe I
should start over...

414
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,458
What I'm
trying to say is,

415
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:09,791
I hope I can
be like you

416
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,250
when it comes to finding
all of the good qualities

417
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,208
in the people that
I care about...

418
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:15,500
They're not always
easy to see...

419
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:19,375
You want to...
be like me?

420
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:21,833
Uh, huh. It's
wonderful the way you find

421
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:24,666
so many things to
like about one person...

422
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:28,500
I don't know
what to say...

423
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,708
Put on some
clothes!

424
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:32,750
Okay, bye, bye!

425
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:33,791
Oh, and I'll bring
you a new shirt

426
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:36,583
next time I come
over, Kyo! Love you!

427
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:37,916
Hmph.

428
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,625
Goodbye! See you
again soon!

429
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:54,166
Hey! What's that
look for?

430
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:57,208
Nothing... You're
just so... lucky.

431
00:20:57,291 --> 00:21:03,750
Don't you even start!
C'mon! We're gonna be late!

432
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:06,708
Oh, well... there was
such a commotinon,

433
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:08,708
that I couldn't even
do any gardening.

434
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:11,541
Ah, the base! Those leeks
we picked were delicious.

435
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,041
Are you planting
something new?

436
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,208
Yes, strawberries.

437
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:18,250
Really? I can't wait!
I love strawberries!

438
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:23,875
I thought you might...
That's why I'm planting them.

439
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:26,625
Oh... Thanks...

440
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,291
Kyo! Stop right there!

441
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:33,208
I almost forgot to give you
your goodbye kiss!

442
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,625
C'mon, pucker up!

443
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:37,166
Kiss me! Kiss, kiss...

444
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,625
All of a sudden,

445
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:42,083
I'm feeling like there are a
few things I need to do...

446
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:44,708
I'd like to learn more about
Kyo and Yuki if I can...

447
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:46,250
About the things
they like...

448
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:48,333
and the things
they don't like...

449
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,000
I think that might
help me to understand

450
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:52,375
them both a
little bit better.

451
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:53,541
And who knows?

452
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,083
Maybe it will
help me to find

453
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:58,083
all the good qualities in them
that I haven't seen before!

454
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:06,916
<i>Now let's all gather,</i>

455
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,458
<i>Enjoying the company we share,</i>

456
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:17,791
<i>Our tears will dissolve</i>
<i>into thin air,</i>

457
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:23,750
<i>As we drink up</i>
<i>this wonderful life.</i>

458
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:28,708
<i>La, la, la...</i>

459
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:34,791
<i>Takin' in all the</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

460
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:39,875
<i>La, la, la...</i>

461
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:45,916
<i>Drinkin' up all this</i>
<i>good love and life.</i>

462
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,958
<i>La, la, la...</i>

463
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:56,750
<i>Take it in all this</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

464
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:24,666
[Shigure] Ah, I see...
And if memory serves,

465
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,166
you were planning to
move back into the house

466
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:27,500
once the
work was done.

467
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:28,666
Is that right?

468
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,416
[Tohru] I really had
it wrong this time.

469
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,791
I don't know why I thought
I'd be able to go on

470
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:33,875
living here
with everyone,

471
00:23:33,958 --> 00:23:35,083
like a family.

472
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:37,208
[Kagura] Tohru you get
to be the riceball!

473
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:40,166
[Tohru] A riceball doesn't
belong in a Fruits Basket.

474
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:43,208
Well as far as goodbyes go,
that felt pretty good, I guess.

475
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:45,875
Except, I didn't think
leaving Yuki and the others

476
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:49,416
would make me
feel so lonely.

477
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,541
The truth of it is, I didn't
want to leave them at all.
