1
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:18,125
<i>I was so happy when you smiled,</i>

2
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:21,708
<i>Your smile breaks</i>
<i>through the clouds of grey,</i>

3
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:28,625
<i>Far from the sunny days</i>
<i>that lie in sleep.</i>

4
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:31,583
<i>Waiting with patience</i>
<i>for the Spring,</i>

5
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:35,583
<i>when the flowers will</i>
<i>bloom renewed again,</i>

6
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:42,625
<i>knowing there's more</i>
<i>beyond the pain of today.</i>

7
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:49,000
<i>Although the scars</i>
<i>of yesterday remain,</i>

8
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:56,458
<i>You can go on living as</i>
<i>much as your heart believes.</i>

9
00:00:56,541 --> 00:01:02,958
<i>You can't be born again</i>
<i>although you can change.</i>

10
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:09,666
<i>Let's stay together always.</i>

11
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:31,208
[Tohru] This year
has gone by so fast.

12
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,000
It seems like December
just came and went

13
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:34,708
in the blink
of an eye...

14
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:38,416
It's already the
last day of the year,

15
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,666
the day we do our
New Year's cleaning.

16
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:46,625
Dammit, can't you
do anything right?

17
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:48,875
You're the last person I
need to hear from right now.

18
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:50,708
What's that supposed to mean?!
You tryin' to start something?!

19
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:52,416
Quit horsing
around, you two.

20
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,958
Who asked you,
you dirty bitch!

21
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:58,041
You gonna talk to me like
that after I came here

22
00:01:58,125 --> 00:01:59,833
to help you out of the
goodness of my heart?

23
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:04,875
I... uh... I'm
sorry about that.

24
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:08,541
Oh, it's okay... It was just a
little tear. It's easy to fix.

25
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:11,000
I think I'm going
to wet my pants.

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,291
Didn't you see what the sign
said? "Closed for cleaning".

27
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:20,708
Uhh...
Right, well...

28
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:22,208
It's closed
for cleaning.

29
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:23,458
I just need
a minute...

30
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:24,708
Did you know?
In many ways,

31
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:26,916
the flow of electrical
waves through our bodies

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,291
can be compared to
the flow of water...

33
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:32,541
Over 60% of the human
body is made up of water.

34
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:35,541
In other words, if you were
to round up, people are water.

35
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:37,166
Many people fail
to realize this,

36
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,208
considering the body's
solid appearance.

37
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:42,625
But nonetheless, on the inside,
we are essentially a liquid.

38
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:44,583
Water is continually
flowing through us.

39
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:45,958
It streams
through our veins.

40
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,875
It sustains all
parts of our bodies:

41
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:49,375
the head, the
heart, the stomach,

42
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:50,958
the kidneys,
the bladder...

43
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:55,708
Shigure!

44
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:58,083
I need the last 500
pages of your book!

45
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:00,333
I already had to make
excuses to the print shop

46
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:02,000
to get them to
wait until today.

47
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:03,500
I mean, we can't
release the book

48
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,583
with the last half of the
pages blank! It would be the--

49
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,125
Ah,
Shigure!

50
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,291
Just in time!
Give us a hand!

51
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:12,375
Put your
backs into it!

52
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,208
Hey!
Shigure!

53
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:16,500
Mii, come grab
that end!

54
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,041
You should be working
on your manuscript!

55
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:19,333
Come on,
hurry!

56
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:20,375
Right!

57
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:22,333
What do you think
we should have

58
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:23,791
with the New Year's
soba noodles?

59
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:25,041
Any ideas?

60
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:28,000
Let's see... maybe
some onions, some fish...

61
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,208
...and bean
sprouts...

62
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:30,750
...ah, and
some tempura...

63
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:36,583
Heave! Ho! Heave! Ho! Heave!
Huh?! He's gone! Where is he?!

64
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:39,041
Hold on!

65
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:40,541
You're gonna
drop it!

66
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,458
Tim-ber!

67
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:48,833
Ah... Lovely. They
smashed the house again.

68
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,875
It's your fault! Your end
fell first, you damn rat!

69
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:56,250
Really? Your eyes must be as
weak as your arms, stupid cat.

70
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,750
Um, excuse me, but
is everyone okay?

71
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:01,541
[Kyo] That's it!
Let's go!

72
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,041
Why does it
always gotta be me?

73
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:05,166
Now get off your ass
and start cleaning it up!

74
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:08,916
Shigure!

75
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,458
There!
Good as new!

76
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,875
Shigure!

77
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:16,000
Shigure!
Shigure!...

78
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:22,125
You clumsy idiot!

79
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,875
It's not
my fault!!

80
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:29,208
What do you think
you're doing?!

81
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:31,583
Oh, I was just feeling
a bit hungry...

82
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:35,208
Five hundred pages! Not five!
Five hundred! I need them now!

83
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,000
You don't have
time to be hungry!

84
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:39,708
Of course, of course!
I'll get right on that.

85
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,541
But one thing
before I start...

86
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,375
I just need one
little favor-

87
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:44,875
could you hold your
hands out for me?

88
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:48,500
Once I see that, I'll be
able to write, no problem.

89
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,125
Is that
a fact?

90
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,875
Now, just put your
head down a bit.

91
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,083
Donations for the
poor beggar girl?

92
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:04,500
If you're
not helping...

93
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,250
you could at least
get out of the way.

94
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,458
You're the last person
I need to hear from.

95
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:11,125
Tohru, maybe you'd better
go on and do your shopping.

96
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:12,291
Oh, good idea.

97
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:13,708
Shopping? Great! But
you'll need someone

98
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:14,916
to help carry
your things.

99
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,125
I'll go too!

100
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,625
Oh, Tohru. I'm sorry.
Something's come up.

101
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:20,416
You'll have to find someone
else to go with you...

102
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:31,166
Your hands! Your fingers!
Start moving them! Write!

103
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,666
It's strange.
For some reason,

104
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,250
with you standing over my
shoulder like this... well...

105
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,958
It's stifling my
creative spirit.

106
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,000
The ideas
aren't flowing

107
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:39,250
through the pen
like they should...

108
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,333
I don't want
ideas! I want ink!

109
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:42,583
It's way to late
for you to be

110
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,083
worrying about your
creative spirit!

111
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,375
Perhaps I should go in
search of quiet inspiration.

112
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:47,708
All right!
I'm leaving!

113
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:49,583
But you'd better be
writing when I come back.

114
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,375
At last.
It's perfect.

115
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:03,166
No, wait... I'm sensing a
second bathroom... Upstairs...

116
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:13,750
HEY!!

117
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:20,916
There... That
looks much better.

118
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,458
[Grocery Clerk] Come inside!
Don't miss your last chance

119
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:26,750
to take advantage of
our New Year's specials!

120
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,875
So, Miss Honda, what
are you going to make?

121
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,041
New Year's
cakes!

122
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,041
Uh? New
Year's cakes?

123
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,208
Uh-huh! I just
hope I picked

124
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:36,916
out ingredients
everyone likes...

125
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:40,041
Shigure, Kyo, and I
will be going back

126
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,708
to the main
house tonight...

127
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:42,541
I'm sorry...

128
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,416
I really should have
explained earlier,

129
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,125
it's sort of a Sohma
family tradition...

130
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:51,375
I, uh... I guess it was
just such an obvious thing

131
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,000
to us that
we'd be going,

132
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:56,208
that we completely
forgot to mention it...

133
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,041
That's all
right...

134
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:00,708
But in that case, I guess I'm
getting a little too much, huh?

135
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,541
Oh! Yuki!
Behind you! Look out!

136
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,166
I'm sorry
about this...

137
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,583
I was supposed to carry
your things for you.

138
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:23,041
Oh, no, I don't mind. Really,
it's no trouble at all...

139
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,041
[Mii] Shigure!?

140
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Shigure!?

141
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,416
[Mii] Shigure!?

142
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,625
Shigure!

143
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:37,375
Ah, Mii. Be a dear and hand
me that newspaper, would you?

144
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:39,916
Ah! Research
materials, right?

145
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,416
You're working
so hard!

146
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,333
Of course
I am.

147
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:50,041
I have to get ready for
New Year's too, you know.

148
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,458
Mii! Give me
back my kite!

149
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:26,666
I'm not giving this to you
until you're done! I mean it!

150
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,041
Not until you are
100% finished!!

151
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,166
If you want it
before then,

152
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,125
you'll have to kill
me to get it back!

153
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,125
[All] Thank you
for this food!

154
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,958
S- Shi- gu- re...

155
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:47,083
Well, hello Mii... You look
tired... Come in, have a seat.

156
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,583
Ah... I'm so full!

157
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:54,833
Now I can spend
the rest of the year

158
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:56,208
without a care
in the world...

159
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:57,375
You can't say
that until after

160
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:59,041
you've finished
your manuscript!

161
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:01,041
Still, you can't deny
the soba was delicious.

162
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:04,541
Now you listen to me! The
situation is critical here!

163
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:07,291
Don't you understand? We
have a deadline to meet!

164
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,125
You can't afford to waste
time on silly things

165
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:10,208
like soba noodles
or New Year's...

166
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:11,833
In fact, I think
I'd eat it everyday

167
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:13,875
if it weren't for what
it did to my nails...

168
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:14,791
Nails?

169
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,125
Well, if you eat
too much soba,

170
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,375
your fingernails start to
smell funny, don't they.

171
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:22,583
Ahh, Mii... you're
such a good sport.

172
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:29,041
It's hell... I'm in
hell... I just know it...

173
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,916
eternally damned...
fire and brimstone...

174
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,583
burning flesh...
"abandon all hope"...

175
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:34,875
Hey...

176
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:37,250
That writer guy asked
me to give this to you.

177
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:38,083
Hm?

178
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:49,916
You mean it was finished? Why
didn't he just tell me? Why-y?

179
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:00,708
Oh, New Year's cakes...
They look delicious.

180
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:02,083
You think so?

181
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,958
I do. But, I have to wonder
if that will be enough

182
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:06,125
for the four
of you...

183
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:09,125
Oh... No, I just made
enough for myself.

184
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,916
Yuki and the others are going
to be spending New Year's

185
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,541
at their
family's estate...

186
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,041
Okay, it's almost
time to go...

187
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,791
Don't you think you
two ought to get ready?

188
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:45,208
Hm?... Yuki, Kyo...
We're going to be late.

189
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:48,041
[Both] Shut up...
I'm not going.

190
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:59,166
Oh, Tohru,
it's terrible...

191
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,208
Neither one of these
two wants to go with me

192
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:02,583
back to
Sohma House...

193
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,708
Dammit, quit whining! You're
supposed to be an adult!

194
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,833
Um... You're
not going back?

195
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,875
I haven't been to that
place in four months.

196
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,083
I'm not
gonna go now

197
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,750
just 'cause of some
stupid New Year's thing.

198
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,291
I had my reasons
for leaving home.

199
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:16,375
They'd seem almost meaningless
if I went back tonight...

200
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:18,541
Why do you have
to be like this?

201
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,625
You've both gone every year
before now, haven't you?

202
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:23,375
You see... New Year's is a
big night for the Sohmas...

203
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,666
It's the one holiday that
the entire extended family

204
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,125
gets together
to celebrate.

205
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:28,583
That does
sound big.

206
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,000
Just getting through
all the introductions

207
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,375
can be an event
in and of itself...

208
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,125
But I'd have to say
the real highlight

209
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:36,416
of the evening is
the Zodiac Banquet.

210
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,666
A banquet?

211
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,416
Yes, and it's probably
the most important part

212
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,416
of the Sohma New
Year's celebration.

213
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,083
As the name
might imply,

214
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:44,541
it's a banquet that only
members of the zodiac

215
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:47,083
are allowed
to attend...

216
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:50,208
The zodiac member of the new
year performs a dance...

217
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,250
This year it's
Momiji's turn.

218
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:56,500
Ahh... but
nothing can compare

219
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,583
to the beautiful dance
Yuki did three years ago...

220
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,750
I wish I could
have seen it!

221
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,166
I told you never
to talk about that.

222
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,083
Right.

223
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:06,958
It all sounds
so wonderful...

224
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,458
A Zodiac Banquet, just
like in the old folktale!

225
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,458
[Kyo] It doesn't
matter to me.

226
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:13,083
I mean, it's not
like I can even go

227
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,875
to that stupid
banquet anyway...

228
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:16,875
What? But,
why not?

229
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,375
It's been a
long-standing rule

230
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,833
that the Cat isn't
allowed to attend...

231
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,250
And, I suppose
that's in keeping

232
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,166
with the old folktale
as well, isn't it.

233
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,166
I'm sorry...

234
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,208
Ah, it's nothing you gotta be
getting all upset about...

235
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,375
I don't care.

236
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:32,416
It's not the reason
I'm not going back,

237
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,458
if that's what
you think.

238
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:35,041
I think he's afraid
he'll get hurt,

239
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:37,041
what with Kagura being
so excited to see him...

240
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,500
Shut up!

241
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:41,375
In any event... If we go
back to Sohma House tonight,

242
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,375
we'll have to stay until
the third, won't we?

243
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:44,583
So for
three days

244
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,750
we'd be leaving Miss
Honda here all alone...

245
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:50,750
Stupid cat. Did you
just realize that?

246
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:51,958
Don't call
me stupid!

247
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:53,833
Then don't act
stupid, Stupid.

248
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:57,833
Um, please wait, you two...
Thank you for worrying...

249
00:12:57,916 --> 00:12:59,750
But you don't have to.
I'll be all right.

250
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:00,916
It's funny, but
just knowing

251
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,250
that you're both
thinking about me, well...

252
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:06,541
I'm so happy! And I want
you to be happy too,

253
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,625
so you should go,
enjoy yourselves.

254
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:10,750
I mean, this is your
family's special night.

255
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:11,875
And you'll get to
see your parents

256
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,791
for the first time
in a while, right?

257
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm sure they're all looking
forward to seeing you...

258
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:17,541
Promise, I'll
be fine...

259
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,541
And I'll take great care of
the house while you're gone...

260
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:20,750
You are talking
to the girl who--

261
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,625
Aah! The bathwater!
I left it running again!

262
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:26,708
If that doesn't inspire
confidence, nothing will.

263
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,708
Okay...
I'll go back.

264
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,708
Guess I've
got no choice.

265
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:32,708
If it's what
she wants...

266
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:35,708
...and when she says
it like that, and all...

267
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:40,083
[Tohru] Try to be careful.
Watch out for all the crowds.

268
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:43,083
We'll be fine... There won't
be many people out right now...

269
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:45,458
You be careful, too. Make
sure you lock all the doors.

270
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:47,625
Okay...
Be safe!

271
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,375
You know, she always
used to leave that window

272
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:08,166
in her room
wide open...

273
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,791
What were you
doing in her room?

274
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:12,041
I wasn't! I saw
it from outside!

275
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,333
She can be rather
careless at times...

276
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:16,916
This morning, she tripped
on the stairs again...

277
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,458
And she's always bumping
into the walls and stuff...

278
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:20,833
Clumsy as
she is,

279
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:23,583
if there was a way to choke
on rice, she'd find it.

280
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:24,833
Don't even joke
about that.

281
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:26,333
You two...

282
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:29,125
You sound like a couple of
old ladies, the way you worry.

283
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:30,666
Don't get
me wrong,

284
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,416
I understand your
concern for Tohru...

285
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,375
but you've already
made the decision

286
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:34,583
to go back to
Sohma House...

287
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,875
Now hold on! Who
said I was concerned?

288
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:38,583
Stop talking
nonsense! Let's go!

289
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,833
Oh! Now that I
think about it...

290
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,291
there was an article
in the evening paper

291
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:47,958
about a rash of burglaries
in the neighborhood...

292
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,458
The culprit is still at
large, or so they say.

293
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,375
Oh, great. If a
burglar came to the house,

294
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:55,375
she'd probably open up the
front door and invite him in...

295
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,375
She'd give him a seat at
the table and serve tea!

296
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:58,375
Then, knowing her,
she'd want to hear

297
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,041
the burglar's
whole life story.

298
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:05,041
Well. Let's be on
our way, shall we?

299
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:06,208
If you two just
stand there

300
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:07,041
in the middle of the
street like that...

301
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,750
...you'll
get run over.

302
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:14,000
O- oh, Saki. What a
pleasant surprise.

303
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:16,291
[Kyo] Why can't she just say
"hello" like a normal person?

304
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,333
[Yuki] Where in the world
did she get that cloak?

305
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,458
Can we help you
with... something?

306
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,583
Yes...
Perhaps.

307
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,291
Are you looking
for Tohru, maybe?

308
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:25,583
...She's still
at the house.

309
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,708
We were just on our
way to visit our family.

310
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,875
I see... Then
for her,

311
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,500
this will truly be a
lonely New Year's...

312
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:34,208
Until now, Tohru
and her mother

313
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,875
have always spent New
Year's Eve together...

314
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:41,833
But this is the first year
since her mother's death...

315
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,833
This is the first new
year she will ever see

316
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:46,541
without her loving
mother at her side...

317
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:49,666
Instead, she will have
to spend this night alone.

318
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:55,333
I offered to stay with her,
but she wouldn't hear of it...

319
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:58,541
She just smiled, and told me I
should be with my own family...

320
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,875
But what about her? What
family does she have tonight?

321
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:04,458
And how will she feel,
sitting there by herself,

322
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:05,541
remembering all
of the New Year's

323
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,416
she shared
with her mother,

324
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,458
and will never
share again?

325
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:12,500
How will she feel when the New
Year's bells begin to chime,

326
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:14,333
the same bells she
used to stay up late

327
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:17,458
to hear with
her mother...

328
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:21,958
How did she feel? Standing
there as we were leaving...

329
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,458
...when she was smiling
and waving goodbye...

330
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:27,666
Do you really think she'll
be unaffected by that?

331
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,750
Do you really think
she'll be all right?

332
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,750
How does she
feel, right now...

333
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,041
...all alone in
that house...?

334
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,125
Do I even want to
know what happened?

335
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:38,666
I can
explain.

336
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,208
What are you doing? You know
Akito's just gonna get pissed!

337
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:44,041
Kyo bumped his head
as he was standing up...

338
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,708
And what about you? I wouldn't
keep Kagura waiting...

339
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:49,458
The thing he bumped into
was Yuki's right cheek.

340
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,291
This happened due to the
fact that both of them

341
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,166
started moving at
the same time.

342
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,708
End of
commentary.

343
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,250
[Kyo] Shut up! Why
don't you go see her

344
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:57,708
if you're so
worried about it.

345
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,000
[Yuki]
I'm busy.

346
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:02,583
Um, wait a minute. Where
are you going, exactly?

347
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:04,708
I'm going home!

348
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,041
So, Saki. I'm suddenly under
the distinct impression

349
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:17,083
that you had all of
this planned out.

350
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,833
I didn't really know what
would happen if I came...

351
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:23,541
I only knew that I wanted
to do something for Tohru.

352
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:27,125
And that
is all.

353
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:30,750
I wish you pleasant electric
waves, this coming year.

354
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,000
I'm not sure what to
make of that one...

355
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,541
Why?

356
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:44,375
Why didn't I
realize sooner?

357
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:45,708
I just didn't
see it...

358
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:49,041
But how could I? She looks
so happy all the time...

359
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,916
Whenever I see her,
she always has a smile.

360
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,833
Sometimes, it seems like
even the simplest thing

361
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:55,833
can make her
smile for hours...

362
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,416
But still...

363
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,500
Saying she doesn't mind being
alone-- that she's all right...

364
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:02,916
[Both] There isn't
a person alive

365
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,750
who'd really
feel that way!

366
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:24,291
Oh, it's you. You startled
me... But why are you--?

367
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:34,583
Oh, no, no! I wasn't crying,
really! It's just, well...

368
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,750
You know, it's the
holiday season and all,

369
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,000
and you know how they
say people can get

370
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,416
a little emotional
this time of year...

371
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,916
Thank goodness.

372
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,416
If we'd kept
on going...

373
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,333
If we hadn't stopped
and turned around...

374
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:49,875
We would have left her
here, crying by herself.

375
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,875
What's wrong?
Are you all right?

376
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,458
We have to watch
the first sunrise...

377
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:59,166
Yeah, and I wanna
have some more

378
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,791
of those New Year's
soba noodles...

379
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:18,583
[Yuki]
I'm home.

380
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:21,666
[Kyo]
I'm home.

381
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:22,541
Welcome home!

382
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:25,541
Ah, Shigure!
Good to see you!

383
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,041
Shigure!

384
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,541
Momiji.
Hello.

385
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,708
Uh... Where's
Yuki and Kyo?

386
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:34,541
They both decided... they'd
rather stay home tonight...

387
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:39,291
But, I for one am looking
forward to watching your dance.

388
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:40,500
Wouldn't miss
it for the world.

389
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,125
Akito...

390
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,833
Yuki and Kyo...
They aren't coming.

391
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,750
What do
you mean?

392
00:19:56,833 --> 00:20:00,583
Well, how should I
say this... I guess...

393
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,583
there's no point in
making excuses...

394
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,125
They skipped out.

395
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:21,500
So... you
talked to Hana?

396
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,875
We... sort of ran
into her on the way.

397
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:26,333
Is that right?

398
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:27,958
Oh, Hana...
I promise,

399
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:30,208
you'll be the first
person I call this year!

400
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:31,541
I'll be
waiting...

401
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,375
But, uh... Are you
sure this is okay?

402
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,250
I mean, what's the rest of
your family gonna think?

403
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,458
They won't mind that you
stayed here, will they?

404
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:40,750
I don't want you to get
in any trouble over me...

405
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:41,916
It's no
trouble...

406
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,125
We'll just go
back sometime

407
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,250
before the third and
visit with everyone...

408
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:46,000
Probably...

409
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:47,875
Oh...
okay.

410
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:53,666
I imagine the banquet is in
full swing, right about now...

411
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,875
Even so...

412
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:59,375
I'm actually kind
of glad I missed it...

413
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,666
I don't feel guilty
for not going...

414
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,250
It's kind
of funny...

415
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,166
I thought I had so
many important reasons

416
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,708
for not wanting
to go back...

417
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:09,375
...but,
truth is...

418
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:12,541
Hey, look you two!
The sun is coming up!

419
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:15,708
Have you decided
what to wish for, yet?

420
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,583
I've got mine
all ready to go!

421
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:30,750
The truth
of it is...

422
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:33,541
...maybe, all I
really wanted...

423
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:37,833
...was to spend New Year's
together, with her...

424
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:40,416
This year I'm gonna
beat that damn rat!

425
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,416
Ah, you are wishing,
aren't you?

426
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:49,291
And so, here we are, at the
start of a whole new year...

427
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:51,041
It's such a
beautiful sunrise.

428
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:55,458
And seeing it with Yuki and
Kyo-- it means so much to me...

429
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:58,458
I just know it's going
to be a wonderful year!

430
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:06,916
<i>Now let's all gather,</i>

431
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,500
<i>Enjoying the company we share,</i>

432
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:17,791
<i>Our tears will dissolve</i>
<i>into thin air,</i>

433
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:23,750
<i>As we drink up</i>
<i>this wonderful life.</i>

434
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:28,708
<i>La, la, la...</i>

435
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:34,791
<i>Takin' in all the</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

436
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:39,875
<i>La, la, la...</i>

437
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:45,916
<i>Drinkin' up all this</i>
<i>good love and life.</i>

438
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
<i>La, la, la...</i>

439
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:56,791
<i>Take it in all this</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

440
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:27,250
[Haru] Have you ever heard of
a place called Sohma house?

441
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:28,583
Sohma house?

442
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:31,583
[Torhu] So then, by any
chance are you a Sohma?

443
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:33,750
Wow, so if he's part
of the Sohma family

444
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:36,125
then maybe he's a part
of the zodiac too!

445
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:37,708
[Yuki] So now
it's Haru?

446
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,750
They just keep
showing up don't they?

447
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:41,250
[Tohru] He's
so polite.

448
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:42,833
He seems like he's
a lot more grown up

449
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:45,208
than you'd expect
someone in middle school.

450
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:46,750
[Haru]
Heh! You're not a man!

451
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:49,041
You're a little kitty cat
who's too scared to fight!

452
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:51,708
[Kyo] You little punk!
