1
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:18,125
<i>I was so happy when you smiled,</i>

2
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:21,708
<i>Your smile breaks</i>
<i>through the clouds of grey,</i>

3
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:28,625
<i>Far from the sunny days</i>
<i>that lie in sleep.</i>

4
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:31,583
<i>Waiting with patience</i>
<i>for the Spring,</i>

5
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:35,583
<i>when the flowers will</i>
<i>bloom renewed again,</i>

6
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:42,625
<i>knowing there's more</i>
<i>beyond the pain of today.</i>

7
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:49,000
<i>Although the scars</i>
<i>of yesterday remain,</i>

8
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:56,458
<i>You can go on living as</i>
<i>much as your heart believes.</i>

9
00:00:56,541 --> 00:01:02,958
<i>You can't be born again</i>
<i>although you can change.</i>

10
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:09,666
<i>Let's stay together always.</i>

11
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:38,583
I think it's
stopping, finally.

12
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:42,041
Oh, that's good. I was starting
to think we were stuck here.

13
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:44,916
Don't worry. We shouldn't
have that much longer to wait.

14
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,625
Okay.

15
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:50,583
I guess Golden Week is
almost over, isn't it.

16
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:51,875
I guess so.

17
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:53,250
And once we're back
from vacation,

18
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:54,833
it's right
into midterms.

19
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:56,333
Ah! But don't
forget,

20
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:59,375
before that we're having the
Student Council Elections!

21
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:01,708
Yes,
we are.

22
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:04,166
I heard that President
Takei's been telling everyone

23
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,250
that he'd like you to be
the one who replaces him.

24
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:10,541
But you haven't decided
to run yet, have you?

25
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:15,125
Well, I don't know. President
Takei and the others,

26
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:17,000
I think they're expecting
something more from me

27
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,416
than I can
give them.

28
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,250
I mean, if they knew the real
me, then they'd know--

29
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:26,000
Know what?

30
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:30,291
Oh, it's not important.
Forget I said it.

31
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:31,583
Okay...

32
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:38,208
Yuki?

33
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,500
Hatsuharu!

34
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:40,875
Haru?

35
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:42,833
What are you doing out
here in the rain like this?

36
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:45,083
I could ask you
the same thing.

37
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,291
I mean, look at you.
You're soaking wet!

38
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:49,708
What is it? Did
you get lost again?

39
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:51,833
No, I had to
find something.

40
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:52,958
Find
what?

41
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:56,958
Well, I... I was
looking for her.

42
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:00,541
What a cute
little cat!

43
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:01,708
I knew she
would say that.

44
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,375
Actually, Miss
Honda, she's a tiger.

45
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:06,958
Huh? A tiger?

46
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:08,916
Yes, this is
Kisa Sohma.

47
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:14,666
A Sohma?! So she's a member of
the zodiac! I don't believe it!

48
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,916
This is so
exciting!

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,375
Um, hello there. It's
really nice to meet you.

50
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:20,083
My name is
Tohru Honda--

51
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:22,583
Miss Honda!

52
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,458
[Shigure] Oh my,
you've been bitten.

53
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:31,958
Uh, uh-huh.

54
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:35,083
Kisa, you
apologize to her.

55
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,250
Kisa!

56
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:40,666
Um, It's all right. I'm okay,
I was just startled, really.

57
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,708
Besides Yuki, Kisa
isn't able to answer.

58
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,541
She doesn't speak.

59
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,250
She hasn't said a word
since right after

60
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,208
she started
middle school.

61
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:51,208
Not a word.

62
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:56,791
And from what Hatori says, the
problem is all in her mind.

63
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:04,458
He said, for some reason, she's
locked away all of her words.

64
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:10,000
After she stopped talking,
she stopped going to school.

65
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:14,958
And then today, she
ran away from home.

66
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:17,041
That's why I went
out looking for her.

67
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:22,250
By the time I found her, she
had transformed into a tiger.

68
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,500
Maybe she
ran into a boy.

69
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:29,625
No, I think she was just
under too much stress.

70
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:34,000
But, I don't understand.
What happened?

71
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,333
Why would she act this
way, all of a sudden?

72
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:37,750
She was
picked on.

73
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,958
That hurts. What is
it? Are you angry now?

74
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:49,708
You think I should just mind
my own business, is that it?

75
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,958
You made this
my business.

76
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:55,791
Do you have any idea how
worried I was about you?

77
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:58,250
Or your mother? You know,
she's still out there,

78
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,333
looking for
you, right now!

79
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:07,083
Oh, no! She's-- Ahh!
Hatsuharu, you're bleeding!

80
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,083
And Kisa's missing!
And we need bandages!

81
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:10,958
Calm down, Tohru,
it'll be okay.

82
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:12,333
But I have to stop
Kisa's bleeding!

83
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:13,208
I mean no- I have
to find Hatsuharu!

84
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:14,958
Uh, just
don't panic!

85
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:17,208
You know, you could be
worried a little bit.

86
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:21,000
Haru, you didn't go black while
I wasn't looking, did you?

87
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:24,416
Mm-mm. It just hurts is
all, and I'm annoyed.

88
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,416
There's just no getting
through to that Kisa.

89
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,750
Kisa! Kisa!

90
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:51,083
Kisa! There you are!
Thank goodness!

91
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,708
You really had
us worried--

92
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,375
That's okay.
It doesn't hurt.

93
00:05:57,458 --> 00:06:00,083
Not at all! No really,
I can hardly feel it!

94
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:03,083
Okay, that's
not true.

95
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:04,000
Maybe I can feel
it a little bit,

96
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:05,416
but only a little
bit, okay?

97
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,083
So, uh- why don't you come
with me back to the house?

98
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:10,250
Kisa.

99
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:15,625
Kisa, mother's
here now.

100
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20,375
Shigure was good
enough to call me,

101
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:23,875
to tell me where
I might find you.

102
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:28,958
Tell me- Kisa, why
are you doing this?

103
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:30,875
Why do you want to cause
nothing but trouble

104
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:33,375
for everyone
around you?

105
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,458
What were you
thinking?

106
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,458
Do you enjoy hurting
me like this?

107
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,833
I know now that when
a mother has a child

108
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:42,833
who is cursed
by the zodiac,

109
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,375
often she will
either feel the need

110
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:46,291
to be overly
protective of it,

111
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:48,458
or she will reject
it completely.

112
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:53,208
Why? Why didn't
you tell me

113
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:56,291
the other kids were
picking on you?

114
00:06:56,375 --> 00:07:01,541
Why did you run away from home?
Why won't you say anything?!

115
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:03,750
I'm tired, Kisa.

116
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,208
I've...
I've had it.

117
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:12,666
You know,

118
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:16,333
it could be, she just
didn't know how to tell you.

119
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:19,500
Or, maybe she was worried
about what you would think,

120
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:24,416
or she was worried that...
she'd disappoint you.

121
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,916
Maybe she
was afraid.

122
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,291
And maybe...

123
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:34,416
...maybe she didn't
want anyone to know.

124
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,458
She tried
to hide it.

125
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:38,916
She put on her
bravest face,

126
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,291
and she did her best to look
strong in front of everyone.

127
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:49,958
But still,
she knew.

128
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:52,791
She knew she
wasn't strong,

129
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:59,958
and the more she tried to hide
it, the more ashamed she felt,

130
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:04,166
the more she began
to hate herself,

131
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,375
and the more she
began to be afraid

132
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:06,916
that you would
hate her too,

133
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,833
if you knew
the truth,

134
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:13,541
if you knew how scared she
was to face the other kids.

135
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,833
And maybe,
that's the reason

136
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:18,875
she couldn't say
anything to you.

137
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:24,041
Maybe that's why
she ran away.

138
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:27,791
Because the thing she
was most afraid of,

139
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:32,291
the thought that
scared her the most

140
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:35,708
was that her mother
would reject her,

141
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:40,125
That she would be hated
by someone she loved.

142
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,625
So what's the
deal? Kisa's here?

143
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:28,875
Some things
came up.

144
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,958
She'll be staying with
us for a little while.

145
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:32,250
What sorta'
things?

146
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:33,583
If you
must know,

147
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:34,791
it looked like
Kisa's mother was

148
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,750
just about to reach
her breaking point,

149
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:37,833
so we all agreed it
would be a good idea

150
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:40,041
to give them
some time apart.

151
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:44,541
Yeah, right, forget I asked.
Anyway, so where's she hiding?

152
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,250
She's clinging
to Tohru.

153
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,708
[Tohru] It's already
been three days

154
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:19,000
since Kisa started
staying with us.

155
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,041
Sorry to keep
you waiting.

156
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,250
I'm not sure why I feel
like I have to apologize

157
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,375
for leaving you while
I use the bathroom.

158
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:36,208
Awww, you are
so adorable!

159
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:38,833
And for whatever reason,
during these three days,

160
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:41,041
Kisa hasn't once
left my side.

161
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,541
She's been following
me everywhere I go!

162
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:47,541
But, I'm not
complaining.

163
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:50,375
I guess it just means
that she really likes me!

164
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:54,333
Just like a little
duckling, isn't she? Cute.

165
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:57,875
I dunno. Seems pretty
annoying, if you ask me.

166
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:03,583
Aahhh! That's
it! I love you!

167
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:05,083
I don't think
Tohru minds.

168
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,416
Yeah, why am I
not surprised?

169
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:18,041
Uh- Hey,
dinner?

170
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,000
Oh, right!
Dinner!

171
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:23,208
So, Kisa, what do you think
we should have to eat tonight?

172
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:29,666
Oh, come on. It's
not that hard.

173
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,791
Can't you even say
what you want to eat?

174
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,916
Oh! Don't listen
to dumb old Kyo.

175
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,416
It's all right if you'd
rather not decide! After all-

176
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,583
"Que sera, sera",
as they say!

177
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:41,666
Get off me!

178
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm sorry. Am I
bothering you?

179
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:43,958
What do
you think?

180
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,458
Oh, thinking
now are we?

181
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,375
[Tohru] But Kyo's
right, in a way.

182
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:50,375
It shouldn't
be that hard.

183
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:53,708
I guess, Kisa is still keeping
her words locked up tight.

184
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:55,291
Ah, I know!

185
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,583
Ta-da! We'll let
fate decide!

186
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:02,375
Ahh, I know this game.
The old "fortune ladders".

187
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,125
Uh-huh! Now, Kisa,
you just point

188
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,333
to whichever one
you like best.

189
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:13,041
Okay, that's where we start.
Now we climb the ladder!

190
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:16,250
La, la, la,
la, la...

191
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,000
Do you have to sing
while you do it?

192
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:20,416
Here we are! And
the winner is...

193
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,250
For dinner tonight...
Stewed Leeks!

194
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,416
What is this? You tryin'
to kill me or somethin'?

195
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,458
Huh?! Oh, no! Not
at all! I'm sorry.

196
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:29,833
I didn't mean for
this to happen!

197
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:33,041
It's just the way it worked
out! I don't know what--

198
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:35,208
Forget it. Just go make
it the best you can!

199
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,291
Oh, okay.
I'll try.

200
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,625
[Shigure] Having a lover's spat
over such a silly little thing?

201
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,000
[Kyo] What?!
We are not!

202
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:43,708
[Shigure] Ha, ha. I'm sorry.
Did I say that out loud?

203
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:47,041
[Tohru] You know, but even
if she can't speak now,

204
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,000
I just know we'll
get to hear her

205
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:51,291
sweet little
voice in no time.

206
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:52,708
[Momiji] But, it's not
like Kisa can stay

207
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:56,416
at Shigure's house
forever, can she?

208
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,000
I wonder what she's going
to do, I mean, after this?

209
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:03,125
I betcha' she's wondering the
same thing herself right now.

210
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:04,541
And I'm gonna guess
she's even more worried

211
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,208
about it
than we are.

212
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:08,541
Not that she'd ever
let you know about it.

213
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:10,875
But, that's kinda' what
got her into this mess.

214
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:14,166
So, what about
her mother?

215
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:20,333
Well, Kisa's mom is doing
a little better, I think.

216
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:22,000
I got a phone call
from her yesterday.

217
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,708
How is Kisa? Is she
doing all right?

218
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:29,458
Is she getting
enough to eat?

219
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,541
She can be picky
with her food.

220
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:34,041
I know she won't eat
much, left on her own.

221
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:36,708
She does like
stewed leeks.

222
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:39,041
Oh well, that's
good, right?

223
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,250
'Cause it means
Kisa's mom is still

224
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,458
thinking about
her, at least.

225
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,416
Otherwise, she wouldn't
have bothered to call you!

226
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,250
Uh-huh!

227
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,875
Yeah, that's
right!

228
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:50,000
That still leaves
one question:

229
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:52,291
Why do you think her classmates
were picking on her?

230
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,708
Who can
say?

231
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,666
I think I
know why.

232
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,250
I heard some of the adults
talking about it at the house.

233
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:02,708
I'm not sure how
they found out,

234
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:05,208
because Kisa wouldn't
tell them either,

235
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:08,375
but they said,
when it started,

236
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:10,750
it was 'cause of
how she looked.

237
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,750
You know, like her
hair and her eyes.

238
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,125
She looked different
from everyone,

239
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:18,791
so they made
fun of her.

240
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:21,625
I guess that's just another
part of the zodiac curse,

241
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:24,291
for those of us with
different colored hair.

242
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,083
I used to get made
fun of a lot.

243
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,916
Yes, but whenever the other
kids tried to pick on you,

244
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,333
you would go black and chase
them around the schoolyard.

245
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:32,916
It's better
than Kyo.

246
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,125
He would actually beat
them half to death.

247
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:41,000
Well, supposedly Kisa tried
to stand up for herself, too.

248
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:44,625
She said, she couldn't help
what color her hair was.

249
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:47,500
But when the other kids saw
they couldn't get to her,

250
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:50,958
they all started
to ignore her.

251
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:54,375
After that, anytime
Kisa would say anything,

252
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:55,541
they would stop
ignoring her

253
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:58,208
just long enough
to laugh at her.

254
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:01,208
They started making fun
of everything she said.

255
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,625
I guess I... I never
had anything like that

256
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:09,083
happen to me
in my class,

257
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:12,916
so I can only imagine what it
must have been like for her.

258
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,416
I imagine how I would
feel if I got laughed at

259
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,583
every time I tried
to say something,

260
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:23,375
how it would feel if no
one ever listened to me.

261
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:26,708
And well,
when I do,

262
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:28,750
it makes me
very sad.

263
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:36,291
If all anyone ever
did was laugh at her,

264
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:39,208
over time, it must have
gotten harder and harder

265
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:41,250
for her to say
anything at all.

266
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,083
Even though she knew
not saying anything

267
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:46,666
wasn't really
the answer,

268
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,666
she didn't know
what else to do.

269
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:53,791
And when nothing else
worked, she gave up,

270
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,458
and she locked
her words away.

271
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,458
There now. It's time for
us to go back to class.

272
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:06,791
Yuki.

273
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:11,208
I'm gonna go back to Shigure's
house with you after school.

274
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:12,750
I have to
deliver something.

275
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:14,625
What
is it?

276
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:19,375
A letter from Kisa's homeroom
teacher. It just came.

277
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,875
We'll probably wanna
gag when we read it.

278
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:26,500
You know,
growing up,

279
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:30,333
we're told we have to be
strong, no matter what.

280
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:32,250
We're told that,
in this world,

281
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,833
it's the survival
of the fittest.

282
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:37,875
But, I don't think that's
right. We're people.

283
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,083
We're not
animals.

284
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,916
Shouldn't it be okay to
feel weak sometimes?

285
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:48,583
Even for a member of the
zodiac, aren't we people?

286
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,250
You are.

287
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:14,333
What does
it say?

288
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:17,083
"Dear Kisa, I hope
this finds you well,

289
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:20,333
and I hope you are thinking
about coming back to school.

290
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:22,416
We all miss
you very much,

291
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,458
and I know
your classmates

292
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:28,291
are anxiously
waiting your return.

293
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:30,625
[Kisa's Teacher] The rest of
your teachers, and myself,

294
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:33,375
are here to help you
in any way that we can,

295
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,958
and to welcome you back into
the group with open arms.

296
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:39,250
But more than anything,
Kisa, it is my hope

297
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:42,375
that you will soon learn
to feel good about yourself.

298
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:43,416
I believe you
will come to find

299
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,375
that you do have
many good qualities.

300
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,208
That's my
wish for you.

301
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:51,208
There's no way for a person
who dislikes themselves

302
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:54,125
to be liked by
others, is there?

303
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,333
Heh. It really does
make you wanna gag.

304
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,083
"I hope you will learn to
feel good about yourself."

305
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,083
What is that
supposed to mean?

306
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,125
How are you supposed
to find these

307
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:13,666
"good qualities",
I wonder.

308
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,791
If the reason you don't
feel good about yourself

309
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:21,541
is that all you can find are
qualities you don't like,

310
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,708
I don't think
you can.

311
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:27,666
Not like that, that's
not how it works.

312
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:31,416
I think what it takes is
for someone else to say,

313
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,916
"I like you."
That's the only way

314
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,625
you can truly begin
to like yourself.

315
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:42,083
When someone else
accepts you,

316
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:47,041
that's when you begin to see
yourself through their eyes.

317
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,208
And, you begin to realize
that there may actually

318
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:52,208
be many qualities to
like about yourself.

319
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,583
That's it!
I love you!

320
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:06,875
Kisa.

321
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:14,125
We love you. We
love you very much.

322
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:17,250
That's really
all we can do.

323
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,416
But maybe, if you
know that we see

324
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,125
all of the good
qualities in you,

325
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:25,875
maybe that will help you
to see them in yourself.

326
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,708
Mm-hmm.

327
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:44,500
It's beautiful. It's been so
long since we heard your voice.

328
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,791
Sissy.

329
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,958
Sissy!

330
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,208
Kisa?

331
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:05,291
Kisa!!

332
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:19,375
[Tohru]
And so,

333
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:21,625
Now that she had
found her voice again,

334
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:23,666
Kisa decided she
would go back to school.

335
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:31,208
In all honesty, I'd gotten so
used to having Kisa by my side

336
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:34,250
that seeing her leave made
me feel a little lonely.

337
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:42,291
I can't quit now or else I'll
really mess everything up,

338
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:46,791
even if I can't make friends,
even if they still ignore me.

339
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,541
I know she
can do it.

340
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:58,375
Even though she's afraid,
she's still trying.

341
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:01,750
And this time, I know
she won't give up.

342
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:04,208
It's too bad Yuki
couldn't be here, too.

343
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:06,125
Mm-hmm. But he said
there was something

344
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,000
he needed to
take care of.

345
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:11,458
What did you
just say?!

346
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:14,708
I'm sorry for the way I've
been avoiding you lately,

347
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:16,666
but I'm
here now.

348
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,083
And I'm ready to
accept your nomination

349
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:20,791
for Student
Council President.

350
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:23,000
Really Yuki?

351
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,875
I hope that I will be
able to look to you

352
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:27,208
for guidance
when I need it.

353
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:28,416
You'd do
this for me?

354
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,666
No, not
for you.

355
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:38,041
[Yuki] I'm not sure why
I've decided to do this.

356
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:40,625
I'm not any stronger
than I was.

357
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:43,625
And nothing else
has changed.

358
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:49,000
But all the same, this time
I'm not going to run away.

359
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:51,708
It's okay to feel
weak sometimes.

360
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:54,375
It's okay to
be afraid.

361
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:57,541
The important thing is
that we face our fears.

362
00:21:57,625 --> 00:22:01,791
That's... that's
what makes us strong.

363
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:06,916
<i>Now let's all gather,</i>

364
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,500
<i>Enjoying the company we share,</i>

365
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:17,791
<i>Our tears will dissolve</i>
<i>into thin air,</i>

366
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:23,750
<i>As we drink up</i>
<i>this wonderful life.</i>

367
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:28,708
<i>La, la, la...</i>

368
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:34,791
<i>Takin' in all the</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

369
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:39,875
<i>La, la, la...</i>

370
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:45,916
<i>Drinkin' up all this</i>
<i>good love and life.</i>

371
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
<i>La, la, la...</i>

372
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:56,791
<i>Take it in all this</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

373
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:27,458
Hello?
Anybody home?

374
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:30,125
Oh, look! What
a cool piano!

375
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:31,416
Number Two!

376
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,416
Oh, right.
Sorry.

377
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,125
The inside's pretty
normal too, huh?

378
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:38,916
Don't let your
guard down.

379
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,708
Hey, I have this
exact calendar!

380
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:43,041
Ah, it's
so cute!

381
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:44,375
Yeah
it is.

382
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:45,791
Yeah, where did
you get it?

383
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:48,791
Oh, you know. That store.
The one by the station...

384
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:49,666
Across
the street?

385
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,500
Yeah that's
the one!

386
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:53,791
I don't know what it is, I
feel so hyper all of a sudden!

387
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:55,583
Shh!

388
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:00,375
Ow! That hurt!

389
00:24:00,458 --> 00:24:01,583
Klutz!
