1
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:18,125
<i>I was so happy when you smiled,</i>

2
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:21,708
<i>Your smile breaks</i>
<i>through the clouds of grey,</i>

3
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:28,625
<i>Far from the sunny days</i>
<i>that lie in sleep.</i>

4
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:31,583
<i>Waiting with patience</i>
<i>for the Spring,</i>

5
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:35,583
<i>when the flowers will</i>
<i>bloom renewed again,</i>

6
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:42,625
<i>knowing there's more</i>
<i>beyond the pain of today.</i>

7
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:49,000
<i>Although the scars</i>
<i>of yesterday remain,</i>

8
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:56,458
<i>You can go on living as</i>
<i>much as your heart believes.</i>

9
00:00:56,541 --> 00:01:02,958
<i>You can't be born again</i>
<i>although you can change.</i>

10
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:09,666
<i>Let's stay together always.</i>

11
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:32,333
[Tohru]
Here you go.

12
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:37,666
All right!
Here's an idea-

13
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,708
what do you say we go
on a trip tomorrow?

14
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:40,875
Huh?

15
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:43,041
After all, this
is Golden Week.

16
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:45,541
It would be a shame if we
didn't do something special...

17
00:01:45,625 --> 00:01:47,875
Chances like this
don't come very often.

18
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:50,500
What kinda' crazy talk are
you spewing over there?

19
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:52,250
You drunk
or somethin'?

20
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:54,791
No, but even if I
had been drinking,

21
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:56,125
it wouldn't
affect me...

22
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:58,375
Only because you always
seem like you're drunk...

23
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:00,125
At any rate... I
thought we might go

24
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:01,625
to one of the
Sohma spas,

25
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:03,666
or perhaps the lake house...
How does that sound, Tohru?

26
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,500
But I've already been given
a trip to the hot springs!

27
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:09,416
I couldn't go on another
one! It would be too much!

28
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,750
And what a lovely trip
that must have been.

29
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:14,083
It's too bad I wasn't
able to be there...

30
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:17,041
I did so, want to
go... but now...

31
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:19,750
I guess I'll never get
to take a trip with you...

32
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:22,375
Okay, I'll go!

33
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:24,416
Have you
no shame?!

34
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,958
Not really...

35
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:28,583
Anyway, I assume the two
of you will want to come?

36
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,208
You wouldn't make
me and Tohru

37
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:32,708
spend all of that time
by ourselves, would you?

38
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:36,416
Of course, if we have to go
alone... that's fine with me...

39
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,541
Good, so now that
that's settled,

40
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:41,708
I thought it might be
fun to travel by car...

41
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:43,458
Don't worry, leave
all the driving to me.

42
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,250
Shigure... do you
even have a license?

43
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:51,000
Of course I have
a license...

44
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,750
Why'd you have to
think about it?!

45
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:56,750
[Tohru] And so, we
all decided to go!

46
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:58,375
The next morning, we
piled into the car

47
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:01,041
and headed out to
the Sohma's lake house!

48
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:02,166
Hatori did
the driving!

49
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:07,541
Wow... Just look
at that lake!

50
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:10,041
It's beautiful!
And big, too!

51
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:12,541
I don't know that it's
really that impressive...

52
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,083
Oh well... this
is the first time

53
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:15,875
I've ever really
been to a lake.

54
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,416
Just be careful 'Jason' doesn't
get you while you're here...

55
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,416
Don't even start
with your nonsense...

56
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,916
I'm sorry... Did
you say "Jason"?

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,916
Jason... Jason... Why does
that name sound familiar?

58
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,875
Jason is a giant bear they
say lives by the lake...

59
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:33,166
You don't know
much, do you...

60
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,041
Shut up! I
knew that!

61
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:36,166
No you
didn't.

62
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,375
Oh, so what kind
of a bear is he?

63
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,583
Why are we even
talkin' about this?

64
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:44,583
You didn't bring us
all the way here

65
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,500
to tell us about a
bear, did you?

66
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:48,708
Yes, why did you
bring us here?

67
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,583
I suddenly get the feeling
you're up to something...

68
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:54,041
Ah, you two... always
so suspicious...

69
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,250
All I wanted was for
everyone to come have a nice,

70
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:57,875
relaxing time
at the lake...

71
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:00,125
And you think I'm
up to something...

72
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:02,875
Instead of standing around
sniffing out conspiracies,

73
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:03,958
why don't you
try to find

74
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:05,500
a more productive
use for your time.

75
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,708
Oh, say... like taking
Tohru for a walk.

76
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,625
Oh-h... Why the
long faces, you two?

77
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,041
Is a walk so
terrible?

78
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,458
Oh, it's okay. I really
don't mind going by myself...

79
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:21,208
You know... it's just
too tense in here...

80
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,208
We could use someone to
come lighten the mood...

81
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:26,083
I know, I'll
call Aya!

82
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,250
If you do
that...

83
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,958
...I'll make you
eat that phone.

84
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:36,166
Take your time...

85
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,208
Well, suddenly it's much less
stuffy in here, don't ya think?

86
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:40,000
Shigure...

87
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,041
Tell me. What's
the real reason

88
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:43,875
you wanted to
come on this trip?

89
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:47,791
I don't suppose you're trying
to avoid your editor again?

90
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,208
Dear Mii... I
am on vacation.

91
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:55,541
Please, don't
try to find me.

92
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:58,958
AHHHHH SHIGURE!!!!!

93
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:03,583
Trying to avoid her? Don't
be silly. I left her a note.

94
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,958
I don't understand why
she puts up with you.

95
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:19,541
Yuki and Kyo really
do seem tense...

96
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:22,791
but they haven't even
been fighting today...

97
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:27,708
Oh no. I hope it's not because
of something I've done!

98
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:31,041
But... but what
could it have been?

99
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,791
Maybe it was when we
visited Mom's grave...

100
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,125
Maybe I did
something,

101
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:39,041
or said something to make
them uncomfortable...

102
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:40,291
And they're just not
saying anything,

103
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:43,208
because they don't want
to hurt my feelings...

104
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,208
Oh, uh...

105
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,875
I- I'm
very sorry!

106
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:49,750
I don't really know
what happened, but...

107
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,250
but if there's
something I said,

108
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,666
or something I did
to make you upset...

109
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,625
please, just tell
me what it is!

110
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,458
Really, it's
okay if you do!

111
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:58,958
Miss Honda... What brought
this on all of a sudden?

112
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:02,000
Yeah, really... What the
heck are you talking about--

113
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,791
Ah-hh, Kyo! Kyo,
are you okay?

114
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:09,625
Dammit! I'm fine, I
just stepped in a hole.

115
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:13,625
That looks like...
a pawprint...

116
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:14,583
It's Jason!

117
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:15,875
Jason?!
Where?!

118
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,291
It's not
Jason.

119
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,708
This is terrible! It's
dangerous! We have to go back!

120
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,750
We have to go back now! It's
not safe here! Come on--

121
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:25,416
Eh?

122
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,208
Miss Honda!

123
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,000
Hey,
watch out!

124
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,875
Everything's
going to be okay...

125
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:32,166
I've already completed
the manuscript...

126
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,375
I was just
teasing you.

127
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:37,500
Shigure!...
wahdayaba...

128
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:41,208
Yes, yes. I
understand... Take care.

129
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:45,166
There, I called her... I called
my editor. I hope you're happy.

130
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,166
Yes, I am...
Stop crying.

131
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,875
How can I? You
spoiled all my fun!

132
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:52,041
You call yourself
an adult.

133
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:56,291
I'm sorry... I'm
sorry! I am so sorry!

134
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:57,708
[Yuki] Miss Honda,
are you hurt at all?

135
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,083
No... but
I'm sorry...

136
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,708
[Kyo] Yeah... well just watch
where you step next time.

137
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:05,708
I know, I know... uh,
I'll go get your clothes.

138
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:08,083
I'll be
right back...

139
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,208
Miss Honda!

140
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:11,125
Hey, watch out!

141
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:18,625
"Watch where you step". Oh,
that's very good advice,

142
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:21,541
coming from the one
who tripped first Moron.

143
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:23,458
Hey! Like you're
one to talk!

144
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:25,916
We wouldn't be in this mess if
you hadn't gotten in my way!

145
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,125
The only reason
I transformed

146
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:29,208
is 'cause I tripped
over your clumsy ass!

147
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:30,666
Clumsy? You're the
one who trained

148
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,875
all that time in
the mountains,

149
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:33,541
and you can't even
walk down a path...

150
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:36,625
I can too! I survived
out here for four months!

151
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:39,291
You wouldn't last two days!
You're on my turf now!

152
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:42,375
So shut up and pay attention,
you might learn somethin'!

153
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,666
[Yuki] What can I learn
from a stupid cat like you?

154
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,791
You didn't even know that
Jason isn't really a bear!

155
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:49,000
He's a character
in a horror film!

156
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:50,583
Yeah? So what
if I didn't!

157
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:53,708
Like I'd waste my time watchin'
some dumb movie about a bear!

158
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:55,416
You truly are
an idiot.

159
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,791
Okay,
that's it!

160
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:01,875
Today's the day, rat boy! Once
I get up there, you are dead!

161
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:04,833
[Yuki] Oh, good. I haven't
heard that line in a while.

162
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:06,250
If you're
so tough,

163
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,958
why don't you come down
here and fight! You coward!

164
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:10,208
[Yuki] What's your hurry?
Afraid you won't be able

165
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:11,916
to beat me once
we change back?

166
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,250
Look at you!

167
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:14,708
Callin' all your little
rat friends to help, huh?!

168
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,166
You know I didn't
call them...

169
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,416
They just decided to
come out on their own...

170
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,625
But I don't see any
cats coming to help you.

171
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,416
I guess you have no
friends here, either...

172
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,125
[Kyo] Who cares?! I'll take
you all on by myself! Come on!

173
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:33,875
I'm sorry... it's just...
the way you're fighting.

174
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:42,875
Miss Honda...

175
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,125
Wh- what's
goin' on?

176
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:47,041
I'm sorry for
laughing...

177
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:49,583
I mean, there's really
nothing funny about fighting,

178
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,708
but for
some reason...

179
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:55,041
I was watching you two, and
I just couldn't help myself...

180
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:56,375
It just
hit me.

181
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,583
"Aww, they're back to
their old selves again."

182
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:03,375
And as soon as I thought
that, I felt so relieved...

183
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,541
Pretty silly,
huh...?

184
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,541
Miss Honda,
listen...

185
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:15,875
About what you were saying
earlier, before we all fell...

186
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:19,458
I'm not angry with you. I'm
sorry if I seemed upset...

187
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,458
I just had a lot
on my mind is all.

188
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:23,625
But really, it had
nothing to do with you.

189
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,458
I don't usually like
to let people see me

190
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:28,333
that way, but
around you,

191
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,083
I've gotten to feel
so comfortable,

192
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:31,666
I guess I let
my guard down...

193
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,916
I didn't even realize
I'd done it...

194
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,083
If anything, it's a sign of how
much I've come to like you.

195
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:41,750
Oh, you don't
have to--

196
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:44,458
But, I hope everything's
all right now, Miss Honda...

197
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:47,833
I'm sorry... I'm sorry
I made you worry.

198
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,333
Yeah, same
here...

199
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,041
I wasn't mad at you
either... I guess...

200
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:02,375
I guess I just had a lot of
other stuff on my mind too...

201
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,208
...small mind
that it is...

202
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:06,583
You damn
rat!

203
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:17,708
Um, you know... I
should apologize...

204
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,041
I guess I
sort of...

205
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:23,041
made a really big deal
out of nothing, didn't I?

206
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,458
But in a
strange way,

207
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,750
I'm glad that all of this
happened the way it did...

208
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,208
Um- not to
say I'm glad

209
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:30,791
if you were feeling upset
or anything... it's just

210
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,166
I'm just
glad to know

211
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,375
that you're comfortable
enough around me,

212
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:35,875
you don't feel you
have to hide it

213
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,458
it there's something on your
mind that's bothering you...

214
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:39,916
It's okay for you to let your
guard down when we're together,

215
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,208
if you want...
And I promise,

216
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:42,708
the next time it looks
like you're upset,

217
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,291
I won't say a
word about it!

218
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,375
Oh wait, no--
that sounded weird.

219
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:47,583
I don't mean I
won't try to help

220
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,375
you feel better
if I can...

221
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,041
I just mean I won't
make a big deal because

222
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,166
I'm worried something's
changed between us...

223
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,083
Nothing's
changed.

224
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:56,916
Yeah, nothin's
changed.

225
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,291
Except that now I hate
him more than ever...

226
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:02,833
Oh, you
think so?!

227
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,625
So do you,
apparently.

228
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,000
Well, for your
information,

229
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,041
I already hated you more
than anything in the world!

230
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,625
That's funny... I
feel the same way.

231
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,208
[Tohru] Well
that's good...

232
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:22,000
Everything's back
to normal again...

233
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,791
Although, I guess
it really is weird

234
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:26,583
to be glad that
they're fighting...

235
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,666
[Yuki] Well, it looks
like it's getting late.

236
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,375
We should
head back.

237
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:36,250
[Kyo] Yeah. We'll go
to the lake tomorrow.

238
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,541
[Tohru]
Okay!

239
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,375
[Yuki] Miss Honda,
are you ready to go?

240
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,625
Uh-huh!
All set!

241
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,208
So you're going
down to the lake?

242
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:54,458
Better be careful,
Kyo... Don't fall in.

243
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:55,958
Like I would!

244
00:11:56,041 --> 00:12:00,791
Oh, goodbye Hatori... We'll
see you in a little while...

245
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,875
[Shigure] What is it? Is
he asleep over there?

246
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:11,416
Uh-huh...

247
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,208
I didn't think
Hatori slept...

248
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:16,458
Really, Kyo. He's only human.
He has to sleep sometime.

249
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:19,500
I know that. That's not what
I meant... I'm just saying,

250
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,625
he doesn't seem
like the kinda guy

251
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,541
who'd fall asleep in
front of people...

252
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:28,041
Ahh... Well... it is
unusual... I'll give you that.

253
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:30,375
Poor Hari'. He
must be worn out,

254
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,458
what with all
the pressure

255
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:32,750
he's been under at
the main house...

256
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:35,041
Oh, here! I
brought a blanket...

257
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,875
I'd really hate for him to
catch a cold or anything...

258
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:39,041
Tohru, you truly
are amazing...

259
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,833
I envy the man who
marries you someday...

260
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:43,041
Oh-h! No,
really...!

261
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,375
[Both]
Damn Shigure.

262
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,041
Yes, you deserve
our compliments!

263
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,750
We could all learn something
from this beautiful soul!

264
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:54,708
What's the matter? You
all look so surprised!

265
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,708
It's because you
appeared out of nowhere!

266
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:58,666
And you're the last
person we wanna see!

267
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,916
How the hell did
you get in here?!

268
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,875
Come now, Kyo, is it so
difficult to figure out?

269
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,208
If your brain
were working,

270
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:05,750
you'd know I came in through
the door, naturally!

271
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,916
Dammit! Don't you
even start with me!

272
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,541
Oh, Ayame,
what a--

273
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:12,083
No, you'll only encourage
him! And he's not staying!

274
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,541
Children... I understand
that my sudden arrival

275
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,541
has you all delirious
with excitement,

276
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:17,625
but I should
tell you...

277
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:19,375
I wouldn't be standing
before you now,

278
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:22,000
if a certain someone hadn't
told me you were here...

279
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,708
"Someone"?

280
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:26,708
Oh, no... it wasn't me...
Really, it wasn't...

281
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:29,333
Don't worry, Shigure!
Let them stare!

282
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:31,250
I'm here now and even if
the rest of the world

283
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,541
should turn
against you,

284
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,000
I will always
stand by your side!

285
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:37,375
Aya! You are my
strength in adversity!

286
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:40,083
Je t'aime! Mon
amour! Bon voyage!

287
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,958
Avion!
Ou est la bain?!

288
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:44,250
Will you quit goofin' around
and tell us why you're here?!

289
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:46,708
Ah-h, patience,
patience my dear boy...

290
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,125
After all,

291
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:50,250
as my high school drama
teacher always used to say...

292
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:51,416
"A man's
true strength

293
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,125
is found in the friends
who support him."

294
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:53,916
Wise words...

295
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:01,041
And what's your
point... exactly?

296
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,916
Hmm... I'm
not sure...

297
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,750
Then why'd
you say it?!

298
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:07,208
Oh, man... I can't
take much more of this,

299
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:08,541
you're
killin' me...

300
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:11,583
Do us all a favor,
will ya? Go away.

301
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,333
That's just rude...
And besides,

302
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,583
there's something
I have to do...

303
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:17,750
Yuki... while I'm here,
it's the perfect chance

304
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,541
for us to deepen our
bond as brothers!

305
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,375
I have a better idea. Why
don't I drown you in the lake.

306
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:23,750
Anything
you want...

307
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:26,250
as long as it gives us
some quality time together!

308
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,416
On second thought,
go drown yourself.

309
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,250
Ehhh...

310
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:32,666
After everything
I've told you,

311
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,125
you're still causing
trouble... Aren't you...

312
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,416
Oh, Hatori! I thought
you were sleeping!

313
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,791
I was, but how can anyone
sleep with all of this noise?

314
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,791
Hey! Good morning, Hari'!
So nice to see you!

315
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,791
Sorry about
waking you up.

316
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:48,333
I guess I didn't realize
we were being so loud!

317
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:50,333
Oh, shut
up...

318
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:52,875
Ayame, what are
you doing here?

319
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,083
Eh?

320
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,083
Well, I was paying a
visit to the main house,

321
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,583
and one of
the servants

322
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:59,041
(I don't remember his name,
he was an older gentleman),

323
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,750
he told me that you
had gone to the lake...

324
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,166
Naturally, I didn't want
to miss out on the fun,

325
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,416
so...
here I am!

326
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,625
Bastard.

327
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:09,166
Oh sure. Hatori asks
and he spills his guts!

328
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,750
In any
event...

329
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:12,916
Yuki, weren't you and Kyo
planning to take Tohru

330
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,916
for a walk around
the lake today?

331
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:19,916
Oh? A walk
around the lake?

332
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,375
That does sound
like a nice idea...

333
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:23,625
But I think I
should go along

334
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:25,583
to help you escort
Miss Tohru...

335
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,791
You know, you can never
be too careful these days,

336
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:30,375
what with all the weirdoes
out there in the world...

337
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:32,666
[Both] Yeah...
weirdoes like you!

338
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,958
Oh, uh... thank you, but...
I think we'll be all right!

339
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:39,041
And we should
really be going!

340
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:42,083
I've been left
behind, again...

341
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:43,958
You know, you could
still go with them

342
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,625
if you really
wanted to.

343
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:47,916
Oh, no, it's quite
alright... In fact,

344
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,583
I'd much rather
stay here...

345
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,083
It's been
far to long

346
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,750
since the three of
us were together...

347
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,083
The night
is long...

348
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,708
and I'm in no mood for
sleep... Shigure...

349
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,208
Aya... you
read my mind...

350
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:01,458
It seems
tonight,

351
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:03,583
you and I will be
sharing the same dream...

352
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:04,500
Yes!

353
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:07,375
Don't the two of
you ever stop?

354
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,750
A gorgeous view like this, you
almost can't help but smile...

355
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,833
Uh...
or not...

356
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:21,458
That bastard's going
to be here all night...

357
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:25,000
He's your brother, isn't he?
So do something about it.

358
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:27,208
Believe me, if I
could I would...

359
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,750
I hate the way he always
hides behind Shigure...

360
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,875
Yeah, that's
a good one...

361
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:34,125
You use Shigure to
hide from Akito...

362
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:35,583
That's not the
same at all!

363
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:36,791
You should
shut up

364
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,416
until you know what
you're talking about!

365
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,083
I didn't even wanna
know that much!

366
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,333
But I can't get
away from you!

367
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:43,208
You're every
damn place I go!

368
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:45,375
So why don't you disappear
for another four months?!

369
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:48,375
Now you're talkin'! I
would love to disappear!

370
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:49,750
I'd rather be anywhere
else in the world

371
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,416
right now than
this stupid lake!

372
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,041
You think I
want to be here?

373
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:56,041
Coming to the lake was the
worst mistake of my life!

374
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:59,208
We're doing it
again, aren't we?

375
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:01,375
Miss Honda, it's
not how it sounds!

376
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:02,875
Don't get the
wrong idea!

377
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:05,875
I didn't mean that coming to
the lake with you was bad!

378
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,000
I just don't want to
be here with this guy!

379
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:11,708
Oh, I uh,
I see... eh?

380
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:15,458
So... you're
okay, right?

381
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,833
Yeah. You're not getting
the wrong idea, are you?

382
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:27,250
Isn't the
lake beautiful?

383
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:29,958
Let's try walking
along the shore

384
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:32,041
for a little
while. Can we?

385
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:33,375
Sure.

386
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:36,041
Sure.

387
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:38,166
These are
for you.

388
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,416
What's this?

389
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,625
Photographs... They're
Kana's wedding pictures.

390
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:45,708
It's up to you, whether or
not you want to look at them.

391
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:51,416
So then... Kana's
gotten married...

392
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,875
I wondered why you
suddenly wanted

393
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:55,208
to come to the
lake house...

394
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:57,750
Now I
understand...

395
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:01,083
I apologize if I was
overly suspicious...

396
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:02,416
If I'd had
my way,

397
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,416
we would have told you
about this much sooner...

398
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,000
I wanted you to go
to that wedding,

399
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:10,000
and steal her away from
that idiot of a fiancé!

400
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:13,583
But Shigure kept me
from saying anything...

401
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:16,166
There's nothing I
could have done...

402
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,541
No, Kana and I-- it's
over between us...

403
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:25,875
So...
here.

404
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,916
Well, I for one
can't tolerate this.

405
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:31,750
You're my friend, so I
realize my opinion is biased.

406
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:35,416
But even so, what she's done
to you... It's unacceptable.

407
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:37,916
I can't
stand it...

408
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,750
Kana is able to
find happiness now

409
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:41,875
because she
chose to forget.

410
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,083
Meanwhile,
she's left you

411
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:45,416
to carry the burden
of the past, alone...

412
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:50,375
She left you behind to suffer
with your memories of her.

413
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:52,125
That's how
it appears...

414
00:18:56,791 --> 00:19:03,208
Tell me... when the snow
melts, what does it become?

415
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:09,500
Huh? Mmm, Let's see...
It becomes Spring, right?

416
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:17,083
But... you're
wrong...

417
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:21,083
You're much more
forgiving than I am...

418
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:22,250
That's always been
one of the qualities

419
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,250
I admired
about you...

420
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,458
But it's also the
reason you suffer

421
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:27,458
so much more than
you have to!

422
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,333
I don't think I want
you to get Kana back...

423
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:32,041
I want you to meet someone
who will make you happy

424
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:34,041
for the rest
of your life!

425
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:35,333
I want you to
be, a thousand--

426
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,375
no ten thousand
times happier than

427
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:40,875
Kana ever will be.
That is what you deserve!

428
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:42,708
You know... perhaps
you should try

429
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,875
being this determined
with Yuki...

430
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:48,083
Oh? You think
so? Hm...

431
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:51,083
You'll find
someone... Someday...

432
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:53,416
A woman whose love fills your
heart and lifts your spirit,

433
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,000
even when
you're apart...

434
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,833
But whose greatest
gift to you,

435
00:19:57,916 --> 00:19:59,416
will be staying
together...

436
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,875
Spoken like...
a true poet!

437
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:03,750
Novelist!
Novelist!

438
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:06,291
A new love...? That
may be more than

439
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,916
I can realistically
hope for...

440
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,208
It may be more
than anyone cursed

441
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:13,375
by the zodiac
can hope for...

442
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:14,541
[Shigure] Ah...
they're back.

443
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,708
[Kyo] Shut up!
I wasn't lost!

444
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:18,625
And when I
think about it...

445
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:23,041
Isn't it enough to have had a
love like Kana's in my life,

446
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:25,541
if only for a
short while...?

447
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:29,916
Is that not already
more than I deserved?

448
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,041
Yes... for now, the
best thing I can do

449
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:36,208
is keep watch
over the others.

450
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:37,583
And I will hope that
they never have to know

451
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:39,750
the same suffering
that I have.

452
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,125
Ah, so they
have returned!

453
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,583
Welcome back, Yuki
and young friends!

454
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:44,750
Who you callin'
"friend"?

455
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,333
We're back,
safe and sound!

456
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:48,833
By the way, Yuki... I
was talking with Hari',

457
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,708
and he gave me some
wonderful advice.

458
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,541
And from now on, I'm
going to impress you

459
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,416
with my steadfast
determination...

460
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:57,083
What "determination"?

461
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:59,916
Simple... My determination
to forge a bond

462
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,583
with my younger
brother!

463
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:04,375
This time, I will not
give up until I succeed!

464
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:08,416
Yuki! As your older brother,
I order you to respect me!

465
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,916
I don't think he
understood what I meant...

466
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,791
No, I don't
think he did...

467
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:26,708
Ayame!

468
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:34,791
I turned Ayame into a
snake! What should we do?!

469
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:37,250
I think we're gonna
lose him for a while.

470
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,083
Well, I can't say
I was too happy

471
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:45,875
about turning Ayame into
a snake... But overall,

472
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:47,208
I'd still have to
say it was a very good

473
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:48,708
first trip
to the lake.

474
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:51,416
I was so glad to be
able to spend the time

475
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,000
with Yuki
and Kyo.

476
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:55,875
I almost wish the day
never had to end...

477
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:06,916
<i>Now let's all gather,</i>

478
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,500
<i>Enjoying the company we share,</i>

479
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:17,791
<i>Our tears will dissolve</i>
<i>into thin air,</i>

480
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:23,750
<i>As we drink up</i>
<i>this wonderful life.</i>

481
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:28,708
<i>La, la, la...</i>

482
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:34,791
<i>Takin' in all the</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

483
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:39,875
<i>La, la, la...</i>

484
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:45,916
<i>Drinkin' up all this</i>
<i>good love and life.</i>

485
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
<i>La, la, la...</i>

486
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:56,791
<i>Take it in all this</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

487
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:26,958
Actually Ms. Honda,
she's a tiger.

488
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:28,958
Huh? A tiger!

489
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:31,041
Yes, this is
Kisa Sohma.

490
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:32,750
Kisa isn't
able to answer.

491
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:34,583
She doesn't speak.

492
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:37,750
Hatori says the problems
all in her mind.

493
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:41,916
He said for some reason she's
locked away all of her words.

494
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,750
La, la, la...

495
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:47,041
Do you have to sing
while you do it?

496
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:49,000
But even if she
can't speak now,

497
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:50,208
I just know we'll
get to hear her

498
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:52,375
sweet little
voice in no time.
