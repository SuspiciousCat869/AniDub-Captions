1
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:18,125
<i>I was so happy when you smiled,</i>

2
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:21,708
<i>Your smile breaks</i>
<i>through the clouds of grey,</i>

3
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:28,625
<i>Far from the sunny days</i>
<i>that lie in sleep.</i>

4
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:31,583
<i>Waiting with patience</i>
<i>for the Spring,</i>

5
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:35,583
<i>when the flowers will</i>
<i>bloom renewed again,</i>

6
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:42,625
<i>knowing there's more</i>
<i>beyond the pain of today.</i>

7
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:49,000
<i>Although the scars</i>
<i>of yesterday remain,</i>

8
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:56,458
<i>You can go on living as</i>
<i>much as your heart believes.</i>

9
00:00:56,541 --> 00:01:02,958
<i>You can't be born again</i>
<i>although you can change.</i>

10
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:09,666
<i>Let's stay together always.</i>

11
00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:30,583
Hi, it's
me, Tohru.

12
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:32,208
I guess even before
I got to know him,

13
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:34,708
I always thought of
Yuki as a prince.

14
00:01:34,791 --> 00:01:37,375
He always seemed so
perfect at school.

15
00:01:37,458 --> 00:01:39,625
But now I know that there's
another side to him--

16
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:42,791
a shy, awkward side that he
doesn't like people to see.

17
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:45,791
Of course, he's still pretty
mysterious in a lot of ways,

18
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:47,375
but the fact that he's
allowed me to see him more

19
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:49,833
for who he
really is, well-

20
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:53,916
now I can say, more than
ever, he truly is a prince.

21
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:01,083
[Motoko] I love Yuki.

22
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:02,708
I love his
beautiful silver hair,

23
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:05,125
and the way it sparkles
in the sunlight,

24
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,250
his creamy
white skin,

25
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:09,500
the way his luscious
lashes caress his cheeks

26
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:11,500
when his eyes
are closed,

27
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:14,333
his sweet,
sweet voice.

28
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:18,291
I love everything.
Yuki is my everything!

29
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,583
L-O-V-E! We love Yuki! Yuki!
La, la, la, la, la, la, la!

30
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:27,875
[Motoko] Prince Yuki Fan
Club Vice-President,

31
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:28,791
Minami
Kinoshita!

32
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:30,375
Right!

33
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:33,000
Member Number 1,
Mio Yamagishi!

34
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:34,250
That's me!

35
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,708
Member Number 2,
Mai Gotou!

36
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:38,875
Here!

37
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:42,208
And I am the President of
the Prince Yuki Fan Club,

38
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:44,708
Motoko
Minagawa!

39
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:47,375
Together - we
shall prevail!

40
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,416
[All] We shall
prevail!

41
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,416
And with
hands united...

42
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,666
[All] With
hands united!

43
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,750
We will do everything
in our power to protect

44
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:56,791
our beloved prince
and keep him safe!

45
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:58,375
We will keep
him safe!

46
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:01,208
Repeat: "Do not touch
the Prince's belongings."

47
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:04,375
[All] Do not touch the
Prince's belongings!

48
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:07,250
Repeat: "Do not enter
the Prince's house."

49
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:10,250
[All] Do not enter
the Princes' house!

50
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:11,916
Repeat: "Do not
speak to the Prince

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,458
unless accompanied by at
least two other members!"

52
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:15,708
[All] Do not speak
to the Prince

53
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:18,250
unless accompanied by at
least two other members!

54
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:21,041
When speaking to the Prince,
address him as follows.

55
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,750
Third Years: "Yuki".

56
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:23,750
"Yuki".

57
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:25,583
Second Years:
"Prince Yuki".

58
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:26,583
"Prince Yuki".

59
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,708
First Years:
"Prince Yuki Sohma".

60
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,125
"Prince
Yuki Sohma".

61
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,041
Hail to
the Prince.

62
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:35,083
[All] Hail to
the Prince!

63
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:38,291
You guys again?
Go home, already.

64
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:41,166
Today I'm
not leaving

65
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,500
until those tight lips of yours
come unsealed. Got it Makoto?

66
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,500
I want you to give me the
names of the students

67
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:52,625
who will be assisting Yuki on
the student council next year.

68
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,208
Ah, yes, "Prince Yuki". You're
a very determined girl, Motoko,

69
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:03,083
but you can't always get
what you want, now can you?

70
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:04,875
And I will not give out
privileged information

71
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,041
simply because
you want it

72
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:08,291
to fulfill your own
personal agenda.

73
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:09,958
Oh, taking the
high road are we?

74
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,750
Or could it be that our current
student council president

75
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,875
is so incompetent he
still hasn't finalized

76
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:16,041
next year's
roster?

77
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:19,166
Those weird "Prince Yuki Fan
Club" girls are back again.

78
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,083
Why are they so worried
about next year's members?

79
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:25,583
They're the Prince Yuki
Fan Club. It's what they do.

80
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,708
I don't even need
the entire list!

81
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:30,166
All I need to know is whether
or not there will be any girls

82
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,583
on the new
student council!

83
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,125
Just give us
those names,

84
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:35,708
and you can keep the rest of
your "privileged information"!

85
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:36,375
Hmmm!

86
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,250
Oh, now I
get it.

87
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:42,208
I can't tell you how important
this is. We just have to know!

88
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:45,541
Oh, come
on, Yuki.

89
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,375
We don't want some
evil temptress

90
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:52,208
trying to steal our
beloved Yuki's heart!

91
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:53,541
I tell
you now,

92
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,041
if you try to put a girl
like that on the council,

93
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:57,583
we will not let you
get away with it!

94
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:58,500
Mm-hm!

95
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,125
My task is to
select a council

96
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:01,875
that will support
Yuki as president.

97
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:03,541
I will choose the best
students for the job,

98
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:06,875
regardless of gender.
To that end...

99
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,583
Even if it means
repeating a year,

100
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,833
should the need arise,
I, Takei Makoto,

101
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:12,125
will make
that sacrifice

102
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,291
and offer
my own hand

103
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,458
in support of our
glorious president Yuki!

104
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:17,250
And I would also hold
myself back a year

105
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,958
so that I could graduate
with my sweet Yuki,

106
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:21,250
and we could share
the next four years

107
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:22,875
of university
together!

108
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:25,083
That's ridiculous! Why would
you do a thing like that?!

109
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,875
Well,
excuse me!

110
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:27,458
You're the one
who brought it up!

111
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:28,750
Look at
'em go.

112
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,416
Two-to-one they both
miss graduation

113
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,583
'cause they're still having
this stupid argument.

114
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,958
This stinks. How many
times do we gotta ask

115
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,166
before President Takei
gives us the stupid list?

116
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,708
He probably wants to
keep it under wraps

117
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:43,250
until he can make the
formal announcement.

118
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:45,500
So why don't we try sneaking
into the Student Council Office

119
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:47,375
when he's
not there?

120
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,875
I'm afraid it may
just come to that.

121
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,541
Still, this
worries me.

122
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,375
The fact that Takei
won't give us the names-

123
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:54,875
doesn't that prove already
that there is a girl

124
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:56,541
on the new
student council?

125
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:59,333
Oh, um, by the way,
President Motoko?

126
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:01,208
And I just know she's
going to be some catty,

127
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,750
calculating,
little witch!

128
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,416
Oh! My Yuki
is in danger!

129
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,208
President
Motoko!

130
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,083
Shouldn't we start thinking
about who we're gonna pick

131
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,750
to be the next Prince Yuki
Fan Club' President soon?

132
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:15,208
I mean, seeing as how you're
graduating this year and all.

133
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:20,083
That's right! Only
half a year left to go!

134
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:22,083
Yeah,
congratulations!

135
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:26,833
Of course, I think it
goes without saying

136
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:29,041
that the best choice for
our next President is me,

137
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,083
Minami
Kinosh- aagh!

138
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,958
Uh-uh! It's me!
Mio Yamagish- aagh!

139
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:33,791
No! Minami
Kinoshita!

140
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:37,041
She's a girl that knows
how to get things done!

141
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:38,375
How's that for
getting things done?!

142
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:41,541
I think I want to be
the new vice-president!

143
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:44,250
What do you mean? Why don't
you wanna be the President?

144
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:47,416
Oh, well the Vice-President
doesn't have to do any work!

145
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,666
Then that
settles it!

146
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,208
I'm the next President,
and you're my new V.P.!

147
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:52,375
Shut up! You don't just
get to decide on your own!

148
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:53,375
Well I just
did, so there!

149
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:54,375
I outrank you,
you know!

150
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:55,875
Y-Yes,
you're right.

151
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:58,250
We'll start thinking
about this very soon.

152
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:01,000
Uh, hey
wait up.

153
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,416
It's
Yuki!

154
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,041
But he's with
Tohru Honda again!

155
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:35,958
I'm so mad! What's so great
about that stupid Tohru Honda?!

156
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:38,583
Nothing! There's not a
single good thing about her!

157
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:41,708
Seriously, I know the student
council thing is a problem,

158
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:45,916
but I think this one's gotta
be a million times worse!

159
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,666
President Motoko! We
have to do something!

160
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,708
We've gotta teach
that girl a lesson!

161
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:50,791
Yeah, we've gotta
do something!

162
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,708
And fast, too!
Before it's too late!

163
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,375
I don't know.

164
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:55,916
Yes, you're right.

165
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,375
I think it's time we put an
end to this, once and for all.

166
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:02,583
Personally, I've never
been zapped before,

167
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,833
and I'd really like
to keep it that way.

168
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:06,583
So there is no way I'm
messing with Tohru

169
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:09,125
as long as that
Electric Girl's around!

170
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:19,208
Hey! Wait
for me!

171
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,375
What's on your
mind, Hana?

172
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,833
Just waving hello
to someone.

173
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,875
"Graduation"... Never has
there been so much sadness

174
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,583
in a single word.

175
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,583
Sweet Yuki...

176
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:52,083
It's true. Because when the
Spring comes, I will graduate.

177
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,708
Then there will be no
more stealing glances

178
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:58,041
at your perfect face,
like the one I had today.

179
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:02,916
No more
talking with you.

180
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,041
I still haven't
forgotten, Yuki.

181
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:07,541
That beautiful day--

182
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:12,750
the day I talked to you for
the first time, that moment.

183
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,625
Yuki? Hi.

184
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:24,208
Yes, that single,
perfect moment

185
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:25,541
was more
precious to me

186
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:28,416
than all the greatest
treasures of the world,

187
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,750
priceless and
irreplaceable.

188
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:36,375
I just wanted to tell you, I
think you're really beautiful.

189
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:44,125
Thank you. That's very
kind of you to say.

190
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:54,041
Ever since that day, I
have been a slave to love.

191
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:57,666
And my small,
pitiful heart,

192
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,208
it has been filled
to the breaking point

193
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,583
with my
love of you.

194
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,708
Yuki...

195
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:08,541
Ahh, Yuki! It is my fate to
be forever cursed and blessed

196
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,750
by visions of
your angelic face!

197
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,750
Like a prick upon the thorn
of a rose, your love--

198
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,833
For the love of--!
Keep it down, Motoko!

199
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,041
You're waking
the neighbors!

200
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,708
Mother! Haven't you
ever heard of knocking!

201
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:19,791
Sure! "Knock!
Knock! Knock!

202
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,500
Can I come in,
Princess Loudmouth?!"

203
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,208
Now enough with this silly
crush of yours. Go to bed!

204
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:24,583
It wouldn't
be like this

205
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,375
if I hadn't been born
a year too early!

206
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:29,291
What?! What in the world
are you babbling about now?

207
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:33,708
It's your fault. It's your
fault! It's all your fault!

208
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:36,708
Oh, what is wrong with you?
Cut it out, will you?

209
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:39,208
And what's this?
Another love poem?!

210
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:42,416
Why are you wasting all your
time on these useless things?

211
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,875
Go sell a radish
or something!

212
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:44,791
Earn your keep!

213
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,250
I'm not selling
any radishes!

214
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,458
I know! That's the problem!
We own a vegetable store!

215
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:49,916
Yes, and
being born here

216
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,541
was the worst thing that
ever happened to me!

217
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:54,375
Bite your tongue!
That store downstairs

218
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,125
pays for this roof
over your head,

219
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,375
not to mention all this paper
you waste on your love poems!

220
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,375
[Neighbor] The Minagawas
are at it again.

221
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:01,958
Yeah, like
they ever stop.

222
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:04,416
just so we can put food in
your ungrateful little...

223
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:12,791
For the last time, I'm
not going to tell you!

224
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,541
Gah. He really
is a tight-ass.

225
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:18,875
So, it has
come to this.

226
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,375
We have no choice but
to use our last resort.

227
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:24,250
We must infiltrate the
Student Council Office!

228
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:27,291
Ahh, I get it. So that's
why you called me.

229
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:28,583
Will you
help me,

230
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:33,625
Prince Yuki Fan Club
Senior Member, Rika Aida?

231
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:36,541
You know I will. There's not
much I wouldn't do for Yuki.

232
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:39,291
I'll get you
in that room.

233
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,208
Don't worry. They haven't
made the lock yet

234
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,458
that Rika Aida
can't open.

235
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:47,125
Yes, your talent is an
inspiration to us all.

236
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,750
Isn't that
right, everyone?

237
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,708
I didn't even know Rika
could do this sort of thing.

238
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:52,916
It's pretty shady.

239
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,416
I hope she's not
turning out to be

240
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,208
some kinda' crook
or something.

241
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:59,208
What is she thinking, letting
a skill like that go to waste?!

242
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,208
We could totally sneak
into Yuki's house!

243
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:02,791
We should try to get
our hands on a map

244
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,375
of the Student
Council Office.

245
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,333
You know, like a
blueprint or something.

246
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:08,541
It'll help to know how
it's laid out on the inside.

247
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:11,333
Yes, good thinking! After
all, it pays to be prepared!

248
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,125
Let's look around and
see what we can dig up.

249
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,708
...Or maybe, even
having a dream,

250
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:15,875
where he turns a
little bit in bed...

251
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:18,750
Maybe this is taking
it a little too far.

252
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:21,291
I was worried
before, but this.

253
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,958
Isn't this like a
crime, or something?

254
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:30,958
No... This is...
This is love!

255
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,208
But I'm pretty sure
it's still a crime.

256
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:35,791
My sweet Yuki,
can't you see?

257
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:37,750
There's nothing I
won't do for you.

258
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,708
I'll go to any lengths
to protect you,

259
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:41,041
even if I have
to stoop so low

260
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:43,666
as to resort to sneaking
around like this.

261
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,541
No. There's nothing
"low" about it.

262
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,208
There's no shame in
what I'm doing.

263
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:50,041
It's what has to be
done. Because for me...

264
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,125
"Records Room"

265
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:52,416
Somehow, I don't
think we're gonna find

266
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,916
any blueprints
in here.

267
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,250
Maybe not. But maybe we'll
find something else we can use.

268
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:58,458
At any rate, as
long as we're here

269
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,000
we should at
least take a look.

270
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:02,166
...because
for me,

271
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:06,500
Yuki is more important
than anything-- everything!

272
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:09,416
And compared to him,
nothing else matters.

273
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,416
Nothing... Not
even my own life.

274
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:31,916
Y- Yuki...

275
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:34,875
Yuki!

276
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:37,416
Hey! What a coincidence!
What are you doing here?

277
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,583
Uh, well, I've been asked
to plan the schedule

278
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:41,083
for the
class trip.

279
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,083
It's Yuki!
It's really Yuki!

280
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:45,125
Right here! Right
before my eyes!

281
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:47,166
...schedules from
previous trips.

282
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,708
Anyway, it's been a long
time, hasn't it, Miss Aida?

283
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,458
You too,
Miss Minagawa.

284
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,541
And it has
been so long,

285
00:13:57,625 --> 00:14:00,708
since I've talked to
him, face to face.

286
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:03,458
Oh! So then would you like to
hear what we did on our trip?

287
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:04,666
I mean, if you
think it would help,

288
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,750
we'd be glad to tell
you. Won't we Motoko?

289
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:10,416
Oh... uh...
uh-huh...

290
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,250
I have to make the most of
this chance fate has given me.

291
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:17,875
I have to try to talk to him,
for as long as possible!

292
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,875
Yes, that would be helpful.
Thank you very much.

293
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:28,708
This is it! Right now,
I have to say something.

294
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:31,083
I have to find a way
to tell him how I feel.

295
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:33,125
But I can't say anything
to scare him away.

296
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:35,166
I have to say something
to grab his attention,

297
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,541
something interesting,
and intelligent.

298
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,541
The countdown to
graduation has begun,

299
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,958
and now I've been
given this one chance.

300
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,625
I can't
mess this up!

301
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:46,041
Yu- Yu-
Y-Y- Yuki?

302
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,416
You're so--
I mean I--

303
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,333
I mean what did you
have for breakfast?

304
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:57,458
What did I have
for... breakfast?

305
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:01,375
I messed
it up.

306
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:04,083
Ah, well, when
you're on a trip,

307
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,833
it's really important
to start the day

308
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:07,916
with a nice,
healthy breakfast.

309
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,750
You know, so you have plenty
of energy and everything.

310
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,750
Breakfast.
Well, let's see.

311
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:18,000
Today I had rice, and
miso soup, some fish stew.

312
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,083
Oh, and leek
porridge.

313
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:23,750
The Prince
eats...

314
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,750
...leek
porridge?

315
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,958
That doesn't sound like
a very good breakfast.

316
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:30,000
W-well, I think
it's very sensible!

317
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,208
Say what you will, but leeks
are really very nutritious.

318
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:33,666
They're loaded with
health benefits,

319
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,375
not to mention the wonders
they do for the complexion!

320
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,791
And actually, steamed
leeks can be quite tasty!

321
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:40,750
Ah, yes, I like
those too.

322
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:45,083
I don't believe it!
Yuki just smiled at me!

323
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:47,416
Miss Minagawa?

324
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,333
Ah, the sight
of that smile

325
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,750
is like a million
volts down my spine!

326
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:55,208
And what's more-- we
both like steamed leeks!

327
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:56,750
It's as though we were
destined to be together!

328
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,875
Miss Minagawa...

329
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,708
I'm wondering, is this
something you do often?

330
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,083
Huh?

331
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,000
That is, do you always talk
to yourself like this?

332
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,208
Oh well, yes, I--
I guess I do,

333
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,916
I mean it depends.
Why do you ask?

334
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,541
Oh, no
reason.

335
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:13,166
Ah! I'm sorry! It's
annoying, isn't it?!

336
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,416
You think I'm
annoying!

337
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,375
Oh, no, I didn't
mean it like that.

338
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:21,583
I just, I think
it's cute, is all.

339
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:28,250
Uh! C'mon Motoko, what are you
doing? He said it was cute!

340
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:33,125
No, he wasn't
talking about me.

341
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:38,000
And it's not me that he's
smiling at. I know that much.

342
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:40,708
I'm not the one who's given him
reason to smile so tenderly,

343
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:44,375
in a way he was
never able to before.

344
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:47,458
But what, then?
What is the reason?

345
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,000
In the year and a half
that I've loved him,

346
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:52,666
I've followed his every
move, his every breath.

347
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,375
But what I couldn't see,
somewhere deep inside,

348
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:58,541
in some place my
eyes couldn't reach--

349
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,541
...he's
changed.

350
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:04,708
Without my even
realizing it, he's changed.

351
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:08,208
Is this the way it's
going to be from now on?

352
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:12,000
Is he going to continue to
change in ways I can't see?

353
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:13,166
In ways that
I won't know,

354
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:16,333
because he's together
with someone else.

355
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:19,291
Is it that someone
who's changing him?

356
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:21,208
Stop.

357
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,750
Stop, get
away from him!

358
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:26,916
You can't have him!
Don't get any closer!

359
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Get your hands
off of him!

360
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:42,166
I'm, uh-- I don't know
what I-- I mean-- I just--

361
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,750
Excuse me, I think I need
to go freshen up a bit.

362
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:48,041
Hold on! Motoko,
wait a second!

363
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:49,916
This is
the worst.

364
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,625
This is the worst thing
that could've happened!

365
00:17:54,666 --> 00:18:02,250
That's it. It's over.
Everything, it's finished now.

366
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:05,083
To do something like
that, in front of Yuki,

367
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:08,041
how can I ever
look at him again?

368
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:12,916
How, after I've shown
him such an ugly face?

369
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,833
But I know what he
saw was the real me.

370
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:19,708
I can't stand any other
girl getting close to him.

371
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:21,375
Whether it's
Tohru Honda,

372
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:24,375
or the girl who might
join the student council,

373
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:27,916
or the new fan
club president.

374
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,666
How can I ever choose another
girl to take my place?

375
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,875
I hate them all!
All of them!

376
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:37,833
They're enemies,
every single one!

377
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:42,416
But really, the one
I hate the most...

378
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:46,041
It's myself, the
hideous, ugly "me"

379
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,000
that thinks these
horrible thoughts.

380
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:50,208
All of those
other stupid,

381
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:53,375
calculating,
self-centered girls,

382
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:54,666
if I hate them, it's
because in them

383
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,541
I only see the things
I hate about myself.

384
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:58,916
Miss Minagawa?

385
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:06,875
Oh, Yuki! It's you! W-what
are you doing here?

386
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:10,708
I wanted to apologize. I mean,
if I said something back there

387
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:11,958
that hurt your
feelings.

388
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:15,083
Oh! No, no not at
all! Absolutely not!

389
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:19,458
You don't have to
apologize for anything.

390
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:23,000
B-but still, I'm honored
that someone as cool as you

391
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:25,208
would worry
about me.

392
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,750
Well, I... I don't know
if I'd say I'm cool.

393
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:33,541
I say and do some pretty
awkward things sometimes, too.

394
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:35,541
Yuki...

395
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:39,000
He has to know that I
adore him so completely.

396
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:41,333
He has to know that I
have so much love for him

397
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:43,500
that my heart
could burst.

398
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:48,166
Yes, I think he
must know. And now,

399
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:52,041
even though I let him see
such an ugly side of myself,

400
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:55,291
even though I'm the one
who acted like a fool,

401
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:59,625
he's here, trying
to comfort me.

402
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:02,041
So do--
So do I.

403
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:08,125
Sometimes I say
awkward things too.

404
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:23,708
The truth is I didn't
want to see it.

405
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:26,500
I didn't want to see
him changed like this.

406
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,666
I didn't want to know that
there was a place in his heart

407
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,333
I could
never reach.

408
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:36,291
Not when knowing hurts
so much. And yet.

409
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:37,833
And yet, I--

410
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:44,125
Seeing Yuki here, smiling like
this, it makes me so happy.

411
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:47,208
And I never want
him to stop smiling.

412
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:51,416
Even though I know that he's
not smiling because of me,

413
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,041
as much as that
hurts to admit.

414
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:58,250
What a sweet, sorrowful
thing love can be.

415
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:02,916
This mad, crazy,
out-of-control love.

416
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,750
And the things
it's made me do,

417
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:08,041
some of the awful,
shameful, things.

418
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:13,541
I don't deserve to love
someone like him. But still--

419
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:14,958
Motoko!

420
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:22,375
Time hasn't run
out completely.

421
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:24,250
And maybe, I'll do
some changing, too.

422
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:28,250
Maybe grow up a
little. And then...

423
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:32,208
And then something
amazing might happen.

424
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,250
So it's
settled!

425
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:37,083
As long as there's hope,
I am not going to give up!

426
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:48,083
My love is for
one, and one alone.

427
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:52,083
Sweet, sweet, Yuki, you
will always be my prince.

428
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:54,958
I know this now, more
than ever before.

429
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:58,500
And I will never give up!
I shall prevail!

430
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:06,916
<i>Now let's all gather,</i>

431
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,500
<i>Enjoying the company we share,</i>

432
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:17,791
<i>Our tears will dissolve</i>
<i>into thin air,</i>

433
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:23,750
<i>As we drink up</i>
<i>this wonderful life.</i>

434
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:28,708
<i>La, la, la...</i>

435
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:34,791
<i>Takin' in all the</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

436
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:39,875
<i>La, la, la...</i>

437
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:45,916
<i>Drinkin' up all this</i>
<i>good love and life.</i>

438
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
<i>La, la, la...</i>

439
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:56,791
<i>Take it in all this</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

440
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,583
[Ritsu] Oh no! My
bag! My bag is torn!

441
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:30,666
I am so,
so sorry.

442
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,958
I can't seem to go anywhere
without causing problems

443
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:34,250
for everyone
around me.

444
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:37,125
I'm just a born
troublemaker, I suppose.

445
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:39,083
I don't deserve to
share the same air

446
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:40,166
with the rest of
the human race.

447
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:45,375
Aaah! I'm sorry! I
apologize to the world,

448
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:46,250
to the whole
universe!

449
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:49,208
I'm sorry I came
here today!

450
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:53,333
[Tohru] Um, are
you... Are you Ritsu?

451
00:23:53,416 --> 00:23:55,916
I'm sorry! I'm not keeping
you from anything, am I?
