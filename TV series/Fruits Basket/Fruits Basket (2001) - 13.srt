1
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:18,125
<i>I was so happy when you smiled,</i>

2
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:21,708
<i>Your smile breaks</i>
<i>through the clouds of grey,</i>

3
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:28,625
<i>Far from the sunny days</i>
<i>that lie in sleep.</i>

4
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:31,583
<i>Waiting with patience</i>
<i>for the Spring,</i>

5
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:35,583
<i>when the flowers will</i>
<i>bloom renewed again,</i>

6
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:42,625
<i>knowing there's more</i>
<i>beyond the pain of today.</i>

7
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:49,000
<i>Although the scars</i>
<i>of yesterday remain,</i>

8
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:56,458
<i>You can go on living as</i>
<i>much as your heart believes.</i>

9
00:00:56,541 --> 00:01:02,958
<i>You can't be born again</i>
<i>although you can change.</i>

10
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:09,666
<i>Let's stay together always.</i>

11
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:32,291
Hi there!
It's me, Tohru!

12
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:34,666
In return for the Valentine's
chocolates I gave him,

13
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,625
Momiji took all of us to a
hot spring for White Day!

14
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:40,125
It made me so happy that all
of us were able to spend

15
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:42,250
such a lovely
time together.

16
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:44,000
And everyone
was so nice to me,

17
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:48,041
I really felt like I had
become a princess for a day!

18
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:50,083
But now, Spring
is in full bloom,

19
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:52,541
and it's the first day
of a new school year!

20
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:53,916
It's almost
hard to believe,

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,750
but we're already in our
second year of high school!

22
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:00,291
Isn't this
exciting?

23
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:03,208
And all of the first-years
are just so cute...

24
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:05,541
I wish you could have seen
them at the entrance ceremony.

25
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,875
You two really
should have come!

26
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:08,083
[Kyo &amp; Hana]
Whatever.

27
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:10,083
I shouldn't be
here at all.

28
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:11,541
I don't know what
I'm allergic to more,

29
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:14,500
all the damn pollen in
the air, or this place...

30
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:16,041
So where's the
prince today?

31
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:17,750
Oh, he's been
busy helping out

32
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:19,333
with the
Orientation Committee...

33
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:21,708
Ah, must
be rough.

34
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:23,083
Seeing as how he
has to deal with

35
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:25,458
all of the first-year girls'
lovey-dovey attacks...

36
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:26,833
Um, excuse me...

37
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:29,541
I think I dropped my
student handbook somewhere.

38
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:32,625
So why are you
telling me about it?

39
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:34,166
Is that
bad?

40
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,791
Can you remember
where you saw it last?

41
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:40,208
Start by looking there... We'll
keep an eye out for it, too.

42
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:42,916
What's your
name and class?

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,708
I'm Arimori Satomi!
Fifteen years old!

44
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,333
I'm a Scorpio,
blood-type B!

45
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,541
I like arts and crafts,
and everyone says

46
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:48,791
I have really
cute ankles!

47
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,125
Oh! I'm
Sonomiya Rina,

48
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,750
and I was the most popular
girl in my old school!

49
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,166
No she wasn't!

50
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:56,666
You know Yuki,

51
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,208
one of these days you have
got to tell me your secret.

52
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:01,333
As popular
as he is,

53
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:03,458
he's a shoo-in for Student
Council President this year.

54
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:06,500
Although, I don't think Yuki
would want all that attention.

55
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,250
That reminds me,
at the ceremony,

56
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,375
I thought I sensed
Shigure's electric signals

57
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,208
coming from the
parents' section.

58
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:14,750
Oh, uh-huh!
He came today...

59
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,000
Actually, there
are two more Sohmas

60
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:18,208
enrolling with all of
the other first-years.

61
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:18,916
He wanted
to see them.

62
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:22,333
Yes, well,
Hatsuharu and Momiji...

63
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:24,625
they're like younger
brothers to me.

64
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:27,208
So naturally, I will have to
attend the entrance ceremony.

65
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:28,875
It's only right that
I should be there

66
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:32,375
to support them on
such an important day.

67
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:37,125
Okay, why are you all
staring at me like that?

68
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,083
I hope you're not thinking
I only want to go

69
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:41,375
to look at all of the
pretty high-school girls?

70
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,708
Tsk, tsk, tsk...
Oh, my word.

71
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:46,625
You youngsters
of little faith...

72
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:48,375
What a fool.

73
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:52,083
Hmm... So there are more Sohmas
starting here this year, huh?

74
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,333
Uh-huh!

75
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,416
Well tell us about 'em.
Are they boys? Girls?

76
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,666
Oh, they're
two more boys...

77
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,083
You don't say... We've
gotta' meet 'em.

78
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:02,625
I agree. After all,
as upperclassmen,

79
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:05,125
I'm sure there are many
things we can teach them...

80
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:06,916
Yeah, I can show them
all the best places

81
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,416
to go skip
outta' class.

82
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,333
Yo, Orange Top.
Go get 'em.

83
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:12,958
Yes, that's good.
Go get them.

84
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:16,916
Why do I gotta' do it?!
Make her go and find them!

85
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,041
And what kind of friends
would we be if we did that?

86
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,208
It would be a
terrible crime

87
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:21,958
to make Tohru go to
all of that trouble.

88
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:23,375
Well what
about me?!

89
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,208
Oh, you?
That's fine.

90
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:27,333
Um, you know... I
was already thinking

91
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:28,833
I'd like to say
hello to everyone,

92
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:30,375
so I don't
mind going.

93
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:34,041
Not at all... Really... But
Kyo, if you're going too,

94
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,916
maybe we can look
for them together!

95
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,333
Oh, please...

96
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:40,083
I already see way too much
of those guys as it is...

97
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:43,416
But meeting them at school
will be a whole new experience!

98
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,125
It could be
a lot of fun!

99
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:48,708
Be back soon!

100
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:51,666
He has a hard time saying
"no" to Tohru, doesn't he?

101
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,958
Very
interesting...

102
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:59,875
So what class are Momiji
and Hatsuharu in, anyway?

103
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:04,291
You don't
even know?!

104
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:05,541
I guess I
wasn't thinking!

105
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:08,708
Okay... Just wait
here. I'll go ask.

106
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,916
Oh, your kidding!
Really? That's so cool!

107
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,625
Hey... You know a couple
of guys named Sohma?

108
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:15,833
One of em's got white hair,
the other one's blond?

109
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,250
Ah, yes! They're
in our class!

110
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,208
Go get 'em,
will ya'?

111
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:20,958
Okay!

112
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,750
Hell, why didn't she ask
where they were before

113
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:25,083
we started wandering around
the whole damn school?

114
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,416
Hey, man.
Check it out!

115
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,375
That girl's
pretty cute, huh?

116
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:32,750
Yeah, I guess so. But she
kinda' looks like an airhead.

117
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,500
Yeah! Just
my type.

118
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,833
I'll bet I can talk her
into going out with me.

119
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,375
I don't do so hot
with smart girls.

120
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:41,583
Well, you have a point there.
So what are you waiting for?

121
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,208
Go over there and
work your magic.

122
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,000
Watch and
learn, man--

123
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,916
On second,
thought, nevermind...

124
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:01,541
See what happens when you
stand there like a space cadet?

125
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:03,083
Oh-h...
uh-h, was I?

126
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:06,250
At least stay alert
when you're by yourself.

127
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,833
Or else, it's gonna
be your own damn fault

128
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,333
when someone
kidnaps you.

129
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:10,416
You're
right!

130
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,958
I said when
you're alone...?

131
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:13,333
Right.

132
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,166
You don't have to worry
about it if you're with me.

133
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,041
You can space out
as much as you want.

134
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,375
Right...

135
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:21,125
And I didn't mean anything
funny by that, either!

136
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:23,958
I was just sayin'! So
don't get the wrong idea!

137
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:27,458
Eh? I-- What
do you mean?

138
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:30,708
Eh... mmm... What
the hell am I saying?

139
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,208
I sound like
an idiot...

140
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,041
Ah, Momiji!

141
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,000
Tohru!

142
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,500
Hi there!

143
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,041
What are
you, stupid?!

144
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:45,916
Waaaah! Kyo's
hitting me!

145
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,750
Idiot! What the
hell are you doing

146
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:49,041
wearing a
girl's uniform?!

147
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,250
Um, Kyo,
don't be mad...

148
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:51,208
Good
morning...

149
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:52,708
Oh,
Hatsuharu!

150
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:55,375
Well, at least you're not
wearing a girl's uniform, too.

151
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,875
It's okay, isn't
it? It suits him.

152
00:06:57,958 --> 00:06:58,875
Yeah!
That's right!

153
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,375
Uh huh! It
looks good on you!

154
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,208
What difference
does that make?!

155
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:06,000
What the... Momiji, what in
the world are you wearing?

156
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,250
Yuki...

157
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,875
Hello
Haru...

158
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:16,541
So Yuki, are you finished
with all of your work yet?

159
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:19,166
No, not quite... I was
just making the rounds

160
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,375
and I heard
the commotion.

161
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,375
Hey, listen!
Listen!

162
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,250
I'm really not supposed
to goof around too much

163
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:25,458
when I'm here...

164
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:27,250
'Cause if I do, it'll
be too easy for me

165
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,041
to crash
into girls!

166
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:31,541
So, I'm gonna try to
play it "cool at school"!

167
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:34,041
How the hell can you call
wearin' a dress "cool"?!

168
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:37,375
A valid point, Kyo
Sohma, Class 2-D!

169
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:40,250
And while I find that orange
head of yours disagreeable,

170
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:41,708
I will ignore it
for the moment...

171
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:43,125
What I
cannot ignore,

172
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,500
is a boy who would wear a
girl's uniform to school!

173
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,375
This goes
beyond outrageous!

174
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:49,708
And even if your teachers
allow it, I will not!

175
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:51,666
For I am this school's
Student Council President-

176
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,166
Makoto Takei!

177
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:57,333
Also known as... Captain of
the Campus Defense Force!

178
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:00,916
What a
complete idiot.

179
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I can see already that you're
going to be a problem student!

180
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,833
And the same goes for
you, Hatsuharu Sohma!

181
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:11,166
I will not tolerate that white
hair! Or those gaudy necklaces!

182
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,208
President Takei...
it's his natural color.

183
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,541
Oh, Yuki, so
nice to see you...

184
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:18,875
But natural color?! I can see
that his hairline is black!

185
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,208
Yes, that's
natural, too...

186
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,500
That's ridiculous!
I don't believe it!

187
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:25,000
This is a problem... I guess
we can't really tell him,

188
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,416
"it's because
he's a cow"...

189
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,250
And I suppose wearing
this dress is "natural"

190
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,208
for you,
Momiji Sohma?!

191
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:32,583
Have you no
pride as a man?!

192
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:35,291
You had best change your
ways, and your clothes!

193
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,708
Before this incident becomes
the ruin of your life!

194
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:41,916
But, uh... this uniform...
it looks better on me...

195
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,583
Please, uh... don't
yell at him anymore?

196
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,250
If I am yelling,
Tohru Honda,

197
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:48,250
it is to be sure he
hears this advice,

198
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,750
which should have been obvious
to anyone with common sense!

199
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,041
[Haru]
Shut up.

200
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,333
Quit shoutin' like you're
king of the freakin' world...

201
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:57,750
You're makin' my ears
bleed, you bastard!

202
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:01,083
Now, I've got some
"common sense" for you...

203
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,916
If I wore a tie, it
wouldn't change who I am...

204
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,833
If I had no piercings, it
wouldn't mean I'm "nice"...

205
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,041
And if my hair
was black,

206
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:10,500
it wouldn't stop me
from kickin' your ass!

207
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,208
Who do you think
you are, anyway?

208
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:15,083
Do you think
you're God? Huh?

209
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,750
Black
Haru...

210
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,875
What's the matter? Run out of
things to say? No more advice?!

211
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:21,916
You're not so high and
mighty now, are you?!

212
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,833
Hey, cut it out,
he's just an idiot!

213
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:26,541
Shut up! No one asked
you, you stupid cat!

214
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:29,041
Don't call me stupid,
you little brat!

215
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:31,208
You run away from
our last fight,

216
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:33,250
and you still think you
can tell me what to do?!

217
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:35,791
What?! You were the one
who called it off, remember?

218
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,541
Well now I'm
callin' it back on!

219
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,041
That's just
fine with me!

220
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,791
Tohru, do you
want some candy?

221
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,041
Uh... No
thank you...

222
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,666
Hey,
sweetheart...

223
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,541
Leave
them alone!

224
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,958
Tell me
somethin'...

225
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:49,416
you ladies think Momiji's
outfit is okay, don't you?

226
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,833
In time, after he
grows up some more,

227
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:54,208
then he'll be able to start
wearing men's clothing.

228
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:56,750
And if you think he looks
good in that girl's uniform,

229
00:09:56,833 --> 00:10:00,166
just imagine what he'll
look like as an adult.

230
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:00,875
Lovely...

231
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,416
Don't be
brainwashed!

232
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,083
For now, he should wear the
clothes that look best on him.

233
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:08,375
No! There's a dress code! It's
not fair to the other students!

234
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,333
You stubborn idiot...

235
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:11,541
What would you do
if it was Yuki

236
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,125
wearing the girl's
uniform, huh?

237
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,416
Haru, cut it out or
I will cut you off...

238
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,000
Oh, have my words...
made you angry?

239
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,000
It's
beautiful!

240
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,208
Stop imagining me!

241
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,875
Oh, my... I guess I
got carried away...

242
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:30,500
You are a worthy opponent,
Hatsuharu Sohma... But still...

243
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:32,125
Your hair is
unacceptable!

244
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:35,291
And you'll never convince
me that's your natural color!

245
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,208
Impressive
evidence...

246
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,958
there are still many strange
things in this world,

247
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,541
unknown
to me...

248
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:02,541
He didn't!

249
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:03,958
I think
he did!

250
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,625
You may have
won today, Sohma!

251
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,708
But you won't be so
lucky next time!

252
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:11,333
I'll get you!
I'll get you all!

253
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,375
So, who were those
people, anyway?

254
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,041
Beats the
hell outta me.

255
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:19,000
Umm, Hatsuharu?
I don't understand.

256
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,250
How did you manage
to convince him

257
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:23,500
that's your natural
hair color?

258
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,958
All right... why don't
you come with me

259
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:29,625
and see
for yourself?

260
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:32,250
That Black Haru
is too much...

261
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,583
Um, so how
did he--

262
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:38,291
Never mind... Don't worry
about it, Miss Honda...

263
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,916
Why do I feel
so exhausted?

264
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,041
Oh, brother... You
think you're exhausted?

265
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,541
Oh! Hey, There's
the bell!

266
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,791
Guess we better get
to our classrooms, huh?

267
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,250
Oh yeah...
If you'd like,

268
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:53,916
maybe after school I could
introduce you to my friends!

269
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,708
You'd do that?
Really? Great!

270
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:59,041
I'd love to meet your
friends! I'd love it!

271
00:11:59,125 --> 00:11:59,916
Mm-hm...

272
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,750
Good! They'll
be so happy!

273
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,875
We'll come find you
again later, okay?

274
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:06,708
Um, actually...
Yuki, Kyo!

275
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:07,875
I have something I
need to tell you.

276
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:09,208
Could you stay
for a minute?

277
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,333
Oh... well, that's
all right you guys.

278
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:14,625
I can go ahead and walk
back to class by myself.

279
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,458
Sorry,
Tohru...

280
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:20,625
No, don't be silly.
It's all right... Bye!

281
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,416
So... What do you
want to tell us?

282
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,458
This sure as hell
better be important.

283
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,125
Ah... that was quite
a scene back there...

284
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:39,083
If this is what it's going
to be like every day,

285
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:42,375
I think it might drive
Yuki and Kyo crazy!

286
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,500
You seem to be in
a good mood...

287
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,833
[Momiji] I heard
he was here...

288
00:12:56,125 --> 00:13:00,500
[Momiji] He's here at
the school... Akito!

289
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:08,916
Yes, we just found out
about it ourselves...

290
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,375
[Haru] Shigure told
us the news...

291
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:28,958
right after the
entrance ceremony.

292
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,791
He said Akito decided
at the last minute

293
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:32,375
he wanted
to come...

294
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:33,916
He must have come later
than everyone else,

295
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,541
but we think
he's here now...

296
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,708
When we heard, we figured it
was something the two of you

297
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:40,083
would want to
know right away...

298
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:43,625
Especially if... you
don't want to see him...

299
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:09,958
Excuse me,
are you... Akito?

300
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:17,541
Yes I am...
Miss Tohru Honda.

301
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:18,958
Pleased to meet you!

302
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:22,583
I don't believe it! Why would
Akito be here at school?

303
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:25,333
Oh, I never thought I'd have to
meet him by myself like this...

304
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:29,541
But, I'm surprised- he looks so
young! And he's handsome, too!

305
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,875
Almost as
handsome as Yuki!

306
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,125
Still, this is the same person
who hurt Hatori's eye...

307
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:43,083
You're very polite. I'm glad,
you seem to be a good person.

308
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:46,208
And not only that,
you're extremely cute.

309
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:50,208
Oh, no!
Not really!

310
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:56,458
So you're... modest too...
I mean it, you really are cute.

311
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,000
I'm sorry I
didn't say hello

312
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:00,125
when I saw you at
the main house...

313
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,791
I tend to be rather shy
around strangers...

314
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,000
I hope you're
not angry.

315
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,916
No, no!
Not at all!

316
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,208
Well,
that's good.

317
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:09,833
I should introduce
myself properly...

318
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:12,291
I am Akito, head of
the Sohma family...

319
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:13,541
I'm pleased
to meet you.

320
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:17,583
Oh no! The pleasure's
all mine, really!

321
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,208
It's strange...
His personality

322
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:23,875
seems much more gentle
that I imagined...

323
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:27,291
I do hope you and I can
be friends from now on...

324
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:35,625
Just as you are with...
Yuki, and Kyo...

325
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:40,625
Akito!

326
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
There you are... I've
missed you, Yuki...

327
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,500
It feels like
such a long time

328
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,500
since we last saw
each other, doesn't it?

329
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:55,750
What did
you do...?

330
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,458
You look so
grown up now.

331
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:58,833
I think you've
even gotten taller...

332
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,500
What did
you do?

333
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,666
Tell me, what did you
do to Miss Honda?!

334
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:11,208
Nothing at all... We were
simply introducing ourselves...

335
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:13,041
Right,
Miss Honda?

336
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,833
We were just saying
hello, weren't we?

337
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:17,416
Oh, uh...
uh-huh...

338
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,666
But now that I have
you here, Yuki,

339
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,583
there is something I've
been dying to ask you...

340
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,500
Why did you skip the
New Year's banquet?

341
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,875
Why would you think
to do such a thing?

342
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:32,541
I've been quite tolerant
lately, have I not?

343
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:35,416
And the fact that you would
do something like that...

344
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,500
You should know,
it hurts me deeply.

345
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:44,958
Perhaps... I need to take
some time to re-educate you...

346
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:48,625
In that little room. The one
I keep especially for you...

347
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:06,041
[Young Akito] Why don't
you listen to what I say?

348
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:10,000
I am the head
of this family.

349
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,041
Do you think you
could go against me

350
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:15,583
and not pay
the price?

351
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:18,916
[Young Yuki] Ah,
Stop it! Stop it!

352
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:34,166
Oh, I uh... I'm sorry...
It's just that...

353
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,625
I think we need to be
getting back to class now...

354
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:38,541
We're
really late...

355
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:42,791
I understand...
Sorry to keep you.

356
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:44,958
I suppose I should be
getting back to Shigure

357
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:46,833
and the others
as well...

358
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:49,250
they must be
worried by now...

359
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:53,708
Yuki... I do hope you
enjoy this new school year.

360
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:54,791
And I would be
very happy

361
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:58,041
if you paid me a
visit sometime soon...

362
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:21,083
I can't believe I
just pushed him...

363
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,333
But, Yuki seemed
so frightened...

364
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:25,916
I felt like I had
to do something.

365
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,166
Miss
Honda...

366
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,708
Yes?

367
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:30,666
Tell me.
Akito...

368
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:34,250
He really didn't do... or say
anything strange to you...?

369
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:40,125
No, nothing... He really
did just introduce himself...

370
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:41,750
Good...

371
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:44,958
We should do
something fun!

372
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,333
School gets out early today,
so Uo and Hana thought

373
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:49,708
it might be nice if we played
a game this afternoon!

374
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:52,375
Especially since it's
been such a long time...

375
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:56,250
I think everyone's going to be
there. So you should come too!

376
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:02,708
[Tohru] I don't know why seeing
Akito scared him so much.

377
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:05,375
But right now, I just want
to do something nice for him,

378
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:06,916
to cheer
him up...

379
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,750
I want to take him somewhere
where he can be with friends...

380
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,625
[All] Rock...
Paper... Scissors...

381
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:19,125
What am I doing here?
I hate badminton!

382
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:20,625
Oh,
stop it.

383
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,458
I don't even want to hear you
complaining over there...

384
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,958
You're not the one who has to
play with this mask on, wuss!

385
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:26,458
No one's forcin'
you to play!

386
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:29,166
So, then... We've picked
teams, but what now?

387
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,375
What are
the rules?

388
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:33,250
Huh? What are
you talkin' about?

389
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:36,833
Rules are useless
in badminton.

390
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:39,208
You hit the birdie
as hard as you can.

391
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:41,541
Your opponent will
try to do the same.

392
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,041
If you must call
it a rule...

393
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:44,250
then the first
person to collapse

394
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,375
from
exhaustion loses...

395
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:48,208
That's good!
It sounds easy!

396
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:49,541
It sounds
stupid!

397
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:52,375
Oh, shut up, will ya'?
Just get in position!

398
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:53,708
Position?

399
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,083
[Tohru]
Okay, all set!

400
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:57,750
Okay, Prince. Time to
let Orange Top have it!

401
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,208
Keep dreamin'
Yankee!

402
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:00,916
Are you
ready, Yuki?

403
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:05,416
[Hana] Here
it comes!

404
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,250
[Shigure] Do you know what
he had to say about Tohru?

405
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,708
He said
she was ugly.

406
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:14,708
Yes, while we were riding
home in the car today...

407
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:18,208
She is probably the ugliest
girl I've ever seen...

408
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,833
...and she's not too
bright, either...

409
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:21,833
I doubt I have anything
to worry about

410
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:23,541
from a girl
like that.

411
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:26,375
Yuki won't be interested
in her for long...

412
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,125
And he won't be able to go
against me for much longer,

413
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:29,958
not if he wants
to be happy...

414
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,458
After all... It's
obvious that Yuki

415
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:35,291
is still terrified
when he sees me...

416
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:39,333
I think he remembers where
his true loyalties lie...

417
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:41,458
It's understandable,
I guess...

418
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:45,208
With as long as Yuki suffered
Akito's mental abuse...

419
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:48,250
It's only natural
he'd carry some scars.

420
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:54,291
But there's something
Akito doesn't understand...

421
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:59,166
If it's possible for one
person to be hurt by another,

422
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,375
then it's possible for
that person to be healed

423
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:02,625
by another
as well...

424
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:05,416
[Shigure] Yes, that is a
comforting thought...

425
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,708
And since we're back
on the subject...

426
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:12,375
Despite what he said, Tohru is
very cute... In a sweet way...

427
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:13,666
For some reason...
when you say that,

428
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,416
it reeks of
something illegal.

429
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:23,625
[Yuki] There are things I have
dreamed about all of my life.

430
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:27,750
Things I never thought I
would have... Mere fantasies...

431
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:30,250
Parents that
would embrace me...

432
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,916
A home where I could
truly feel welcome...

433
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,375
A place where everyone could
smile, and laugh together...

434
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:39,083
A place where I
could be myself,

435
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:42,083
and I could be close
to the people around me...

436
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:46,458
A warm place...
surrounded by friends...

437
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:50,958
But I
know now...

438
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:55,500
It wasn't
all a fantasy...

439
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:59,125
That place...
exists.

440
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:06,916
<i>Now let's all gather,</i>

441
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,500
<i>Enjoying the company we share,</i>

442
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:17,791
<i>Our tears will dissolve</i>
<i>into thin air,</i>

443
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:23,750
<i>As we drink up</i>
<i>this wonderful life.</i>

444
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:28,708
<i>La, la, la...</i>

445
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:34,791
<i>Takin' in all the</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

446
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:39,875
<i>La, la, la...</i>

447
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:45,916
<i>Drinkin' up all this</i>
<i>good love and life.</i>

448
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
<i>La, la, la...</i>

449
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:56,791
<i>Take it in all this</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

450
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:27,125
It is an age-old
custom that members

451
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:29,375
of the royal family should
always wear their hair long,

452
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:31,250
in honor of the
high king Rurubara,

453
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:33,250
who, it is said, during the
fourth year of his reign,

454
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:35,875
was visited by a divine
image -It was Kandra,

455
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:38,208
shimmering with heavenly
light of red and gold!

456
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:41,000
Kandra began to chant,
"Ma Rudu Muni!"

457
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:43,041
And a blue light burst
forth from his forehead.

458
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:45,833
At this moment, Rurubara's
true spirit was set free!

459
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:48,041
And just as the vast
springs of strength

460
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:49,666
and wisdom were
swelling within him,

461
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:52,958
so too did his hair begin to
sprout forth from his head!

462
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:57,458
Is that Aya? It is, but
what is he doing here?!
