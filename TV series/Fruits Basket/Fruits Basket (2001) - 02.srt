1
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:18,125
<i>I was so happy when you smiled,</i>

2
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:21,708
<i>Your smile breaks</i>
<i>through the clouds of grey,</i>

3
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:28,625
<i>Far from the sunny days</i>
<i>that lie in sleep.</i>

4
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:31,583
<i>Waiting with patience</i>
<i>for the Spring,</i>

5
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:35,583
<i>when the flowers will</i>
<i>bloom renewed again,</i>

6
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:42,625
<i>knowing there's more</i>
<i>beyond the pain of today.</i>

7
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:49,000
<i>Although the scars</i>
<i>of yesterday remain,</i>

8
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:56,458
<i>You can go on living as</i>
<i>much as your heart believes.</i>

9
00:00:56,541 --> 00:01:02,958
<i>You can't be born again</i>
<i>although you can change.</i>

10
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:09,666
<i>Let's stay together always.</i>

11
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,875
Call a doctor! Or a vet!
Or anybody!

12
00:01:33,958 --> 00:01:37,875
Mr. Postman! It's terrible!
You see?! They're animals!

13
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:41,708
Well, uh... Yes, they certainly
are... Here's your mail!

14
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:43,875
No, no! We've got
to do something!!

15
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:50,375
I wish my dog was
this smart. Good day!

16
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:54,041
Dammit! How am I supposed
to come up with an excuse

17
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:55,625
if both of you transform too?!

18
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:58,708
Don't you dare try to blame
this on us, you stupid cat!

19
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:00,833
Go ahead... Say that again!

20
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:02,291
Stupid Cat.

21
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:03,541
Why you little--

22
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:05,541
Cut it out! Both of you!

23
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,916
You mean... they talk too?!

24
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:10,875
Anyway, it's too
late for excuses...

25
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:13,291
We might as well
tell her the truth...

26
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:17,916
Tohru? I'm a dog.
Yuki here, he's a rat.

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,166
That's Kyo.
Don't let his temper scare you.

28
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,958
He's got a bit of
a chip on his shoulder.

29
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:26,250
So this is... normal?

30
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,875
Strange choice
of words, but yes.

31
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:31,375
Our family has lived with
this curse for generations.

32
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:35,166
We transform into the twelve
animals of the Chinese Zodiac.

33
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,708
Sorry. The twelve
animals, plus the cat.

34
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,125
Anyway...

35
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:42,125
whenever our bodies come
under a great deal of stress,

36
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:43,416
or when we're hugged

37
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,750
by a member of the
opposite sex, we transform.

38
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:49,875
After a little while, we change
back. The only thing is, uh...

39
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:52,250
...we're naked.

40
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:55,250
Well... we must seem

41
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:56,791
pretty strange to
you at this point, huh?

42
00:02:56,875 --> 00:03:02,208
Yeah... but... it's not your
fault if your family's cursed...

43
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:07,291
<i>A family curse... I guess that</i>
<i>would explain a few things...</i>

44
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:11,166
<i>If Yuki turns into an animal</i>
<i>whenever a girl hugs him,</i>

45
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,250
<i>that must be why he pushed that</i>
<i>fan club girl in the hall...</i>

46
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:16,958
<i>He didn't want her</i>
<i>to find out his secret!</i>

47
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:20,208
Tohru, didn't you say you used
to wish you could be a cat?

48
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:22,083
Yeah. Uh-huh.

49
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:25,291
What's it like
seeing the real thing?

50
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:28,125
<i>Right! It's the cat from</i>
<i>the Chinese Zodiac!</i>

51
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,250
<i>Like in the story!</i>

52
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,916
Yes, it's hard to believe...
I know!

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,708
And I agree, the phrase
"cat-like reflexes"

54
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,041
doesn't really apply to him,

55
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:37,208
the way he let you
fall on him like that...

56
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:39,875
But he is a cat,
albeit clumsier than most.

57
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:41,375
Surprising really,

58
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,416
considering the amount of
martial arts training he's had.

59
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,708
I'm sure he'd tell you the same
thing himself, if he wasn't so

60
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,041
busy brooding like a child...

61
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:51,375
Will you shut up!
I told you it's not my fault!

62
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:54,000
If you wanna blame
somebody, blame her!

63
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,208
She shouldn't even be here!

64
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:56,916
Leave her out of this...

65
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,625
Who we choose
to allow into this house

66
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:01,041
is really none of your concern.

67
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:02,875
You're the one who
doesn't belong here.

68
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,083
Punk!!

69
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:13,208
Oh, Tohru, you're bleeding.

70
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:19,375
I knew Kyo was reckless with his
temper, but to act like this...?

71
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:21,250
You're still as stupid as ever.

72
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:22,333
And I'm going
to prove it to you

73
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,583
by giving you
exactly what you want.

74
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:27,041
Only this time...
I won't hold back.

75
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:28,833
Okay... sissy boy!

76
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:30,416
No, Yuki!

77
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,541
Don't worry... This goes back
a lot farther than just today...

78
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:37,375
Those two do nothing but fight
whenever they see each other.

79
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,833
But... uhh...
shouldn't we stop them?

80
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:43,708
No. It's okay...
It'll all be over in a second.

81
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,958
I told you
I wouldn't hold back...

82
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:56,375
You should've listened...

83
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,666
He... sent him flying...

84
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,125
Yuki, try not to destroy
the house, okay?

85
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:03,708
I really didn't mean
to put him in the yard...

86
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:06,541
He should learn
to keep his guard up.

87
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,333
Miss Honda... your hurt?

88
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:11,208
Oh! It's fine! Really! I'm okay!

89
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:14,875
But I, uh... I'm not
so sure about him...

90
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:17,875
No. The only thing
he's bruised is his ego.

91
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,750
I'm guessing your
dreams of being a cat

92
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:22,458
are pretty much
shattered at this point.

93
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,958
Well, I don't know. I wouldn't--

94
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:28,083
...say that.

95
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,791
<i>It's hard to believe, Mom.</i>

96
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,416
<i>All the girls call</i>
<i>Yuki a "prince",</i>

97
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,500
<i>but I didn't think he could</i>
<i>really be so... so noble.</i>

98
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,291
<i>I just thought it was</i>
<i>because he was cute</i>

99
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,375
<i>and good at sports. But this...</i>

100
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:46,041
<i>I've never seen him</i>
<i>act like this at school...</i>

101
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,458
...School!

102
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:49,958
Oh no! I'm late! I'm late!
I'm late! I'm late! Sorry!

103
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:53,500
I'm not so sure you want
to go in that uniform...

104
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:56,500
Ah! Suddenly she remembers
her adventures in the woods...

105
00:05:56,583 --> 00:06:00,083
I don't know... It's not that
bad. Maybe no one will notice!

106
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:01,791
Uh, I think they will.

107
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:05,166
You're right... But I promised
Mom. I have to go to school!

108
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,166
Fine. Don't let me stop you.
A promise is a promise.

109
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,541
Which reminds me,

110
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:11,791
I will have to tell Akito

111
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,833
about everything that's
happened this morning.

112
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,333
You have to tell who?

113
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:18,416
Oh, sorry.
He's the head of the family.

114
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,041
So, then I guess...
this... Akito...

115
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:24,791
He must be someone
really important, huh?

116
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:27,250
Well, he is to us at least...

117
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,125
And after all, we did
just give away the big

118
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,666
"Sohma Family Secret."

119
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,708
Oh, right... That does make
sense... but I really am late.

120
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:36,833
Goodbye!

121
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,375
Be safe!

122
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:40,458
Since when have
you been so talkative

123
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,666
about our family matters?

124
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:47,041
You're planning on erasing Miss
Honda's memories, aren't you...

125
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:51,208
Just like in the old days.

126
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:54,708
That's not my intention...
This isn't like before.

127
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:56,833
Too many people knew
about us back then.

128
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,625
It couldn't be helped.

129
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:01,541
Fine... I'm going to school...

130
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:09,916
Thanks again for letting
me use the washing machine!

131
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,041
Believe me,
I did us all a favor...

132
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:15,125
Now, how did you
say you got so dirty?

133
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,750
L-O-V-E! We love... Yuki!

134
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,291
Yuki! Yuki!

135
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:26,666
So Miss Tohru,
how come the dirty clothes?

136
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,666
Did Prince Yuki
give you the ditch?

137
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:38,583
Good grief, those
girls give me a headache...

138
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:41,541
Their "prince" doesn't show so
they have to bother someone...

139
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,833
But why you, I wonder?

140
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,416
<i>I can't imagine what they'd do</i>

141
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,958
<i>if they knew I was</i>
<i>staying at Yuki's house.</i>

142
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:50,666
<i>I think even Uo and Hana would</i>
<i>be upset if they knew...</i>

143
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:54,250
<i>Oh well. Silly, silly!</i>
<i>I better go change now.</i>

144
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:58,875
Hello, Miss Honda.

145
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:01,458
Oh, Yuki. Hi.

146
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:06,750
So, did you tell them? Your
friends... About this morning?

147
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:09,250
Umm... I told them I tripped...

148
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:12,375
Oh! Your secret!
No! No, I didn't!

149
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,375
I promise I won't tell a soul!

150
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,416
Mom always said
it's not right to gossip!

151
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,125
Oh, but you don't
know me that well yet!

152
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,750
--No, really-
--I swear!

153
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:20,791
I'll write it in
blood if you want!

154
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,375
Cross my heart
and hope to die!

155
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:23,625
Whatever it takes
for you to believe me!

156
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,416
I'll swallow a thousand--

157
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,875
That's not what I meant!

158
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:31,208
I'm sorry.

159
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:35,250
I do believe you when you
say you'll keep our secret...

160
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,708
But it doesn't matter.

161
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:40,375
We still might have
to erase your memory.

162
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:45,458
It won't harm you.
It's something like hypnotism.

163
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:48,916
You'll simply forget everything
you saw this morning...

164
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,583
I know this, because this
isn't the first time

165
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:54,083
someone has learned about us...

166
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:58,041
<i>It happened when</i>
<i>I was seven years old.</i>

167
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,708
<i>I was playing with</i>
<i>some other children</i>

168
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:02,125
<i>in the garden</i>
<i>behind our house...</i>

169
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,958
<i>After that, we had to erase</i>

170
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:13,583
<i>every one of those</i>
<i>children's memories...</i>

171
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:23,166
<i>Akito, am I really that strange?</i>

172
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:27,708
<i>Am I so strange that we</i>
<i>have to hide it from everyone?</i>

173
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:31,875
<i>Hmph... Yes.</i>
<i>You are that strange.</i>

174
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:34,875
<i>A human who turns into a rat?</i>

175
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:38,875
<i>What do you think they would</i>
<i>do you if they knew? Really?</i>

176
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,583
<i>You're a freak. They</i>
<i>wouldn't come near you...</i>

177
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,833
<i>They'd hate you.</i>

178
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:51,416
Yuki?

179
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,916
Are you all right?

180
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:00,708
But I... I can't go
against Akito's decision,

181
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:02,666
whatever it is...

182
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:07,125
I can't stop him, no matter
how much I might want to...

183
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:09,291
That's why... I'm sorry!

184
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,458
Wait!!

185
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:20,000
I am so sorry! Really,
I didn't do it on purpose!

186
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:23,208
Ohh, I'm such an idiot!
I wasn't even thinking!

187
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:27,041
It's all right. Just as
long as no one else saw...

188
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:30,666
Oh... okay.

189
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,416
What I wanted to say was,

190
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,666
thank you for being
concerned about me.

191
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:40,125
But, really... It's okay.
I'm fine. I'm not scared.

192
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:41,541
So don't worry.

193
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:44,375
I mean, I completely understand
if you and your family

194
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:47,291
don't want anyone to
know about your secret.

195
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,291
That's why it's
called a secret, right?

196
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,750
So whatever you
decide is fine with me.

197
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:55,208
I want you to do what makes
you feel the most comfortable...

198
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:58,166
<i>I don't really like the</i>
<i>idea of losing my memory.</i>

199
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,166
<i>And I don't want</i>
<i>to forget meeting Yuki...</i>

200
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,708
<i>But he's done so much for me</i>

201
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:05,375
<i>without asking</i>
<i>anything in return...</i>

202
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:08,041
<i>So, I guess, if</i>
<i>that's what I have to do...</i>

203
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,750
You can erase my memory.

204
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:12,916
But afterwards, promise
you'll still be my friend?

205
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:21,458
Sorry, the amount of time before
we change back varies a bit...

206
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,875
It's... okay...

207
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:29,375
Yuki... where did
you learn to tie a tie?

208
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:32,916
I guess I've never been very
good at this sort of thing...

209
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,333
Don't feel bad.
Nobody's perfect!

210
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:40,625
Good thing you have me here.

211
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:45,291
<i>You're a freak.</i>
<i>They wouldn't come near you...</i>

212
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,583
<i>They'd hate you.</i>

213
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:53,541
Miss Honda... I-It really
didn't bother you to see?

214
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:56,625
Oh! Don't worry,
I closed my eyes in time!

215
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,750
No, I didn't mean that...

216
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:06,291
So... can I...
walk you to class?

217
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:07,416
Uh, huh!

218
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:14,375
But afterwards, promise
you'll still be my friend?

219
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:22,291
Thank you.

220
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:25,625
No problem.
Fixing ties is my specialty!

221
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:30,541
Uh, heh, heh, heh...

222
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:49,000
I believe...
I will trust Miss Honda...

223
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:55,541
For Yuki... and for Kyo...
even for myself...

224
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:58,541
this may be a
great opportunity...

225
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:03,458
I'm back!

226
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:08,041
Hello! We're home from school!

227
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:12,458
Shigure?
He must have gone out.

228
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,416
I'm going to go
put away my bag.

229
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,833
Okay.

230
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:26,541
Uh... what...

231
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:29,500
Don't freak out.
It's only temporary.

232
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:32,083
You can call someone
to fix it better later.

233
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,916
This'll at least keep
the rain out 'til then.

234
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,208
Yes, thank you...

235
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:40,541
<i>I did hope I'd get to talk</i>
<i>to him again after he ran off...</i>

236
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,083
<i>but I don't think he</i>
<i>likes me very much...</i>

237
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:42,708
Hey!

238
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,708
Ah! I'm here!

239
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:48,875
I'm not very good at
controlling my temper.

240
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:51,833
When I get angry,
I... I don't know.

241
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:53,708
Maybe I don't have
enough training...

242
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:58,791
I just... I can't stand
losing to that damn Yuki!

243
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:03,875
So, about this morning...
It wasn't... What I mean is...

244
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,125
I'm so--

245
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:08,708
I'm home! Yuki! Tohru!
Are you here? And Kyo!

246
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:10,125
I hope you're not
doing something stupid

247
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:11,333
and tearing up my house again!

248
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:12,375
Oh, forget it!

249
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:18,166
Ahh... wait! Please, don't go.

250
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,916
He'll be back... It's not
like he has anywhere else to go.

251
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,083
But never mind him. Can you
come in here for a second?

252
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,791
Okay...

253
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:31,750
I had a little talk
with Akito today...

254
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,958
He's decided that as long
as you can keep our secret,

255
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,333
you can stay here.

256
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:43,375
Good! So then there's...
no punishment?

257
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:48,166
Punishment? Why would we--
You can keep the secret?

258
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,041
Yes!

259
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:54,250
<i>That's great news!</i>
<i>I won't have to lose my memory!</i>

260
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:03,458
Shigure...

261
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:08,291
It all seems too easy,
doesn't it?

262
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:11,041
I can't help but think

263
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:12,875
Akito has something
else in store for us...

264
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:16,458
I don't know...
But don't worry so much!

265
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,875
Everything's going
well, enjoy it!

266
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:21,875
For now, let's just trust
Akito to do what's best...

267
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:23,000
Excuse me...

268
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:28,208
Uh... I'm sorry
to interrupt. It's just...

269
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:32,375
You've been so nice to me...
I hope it's no trouble.

270
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:35,875
Uh... No...
No, of course it isn't...

271
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:38,083
Make yourself at home, okay?

272
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:39,708
Okay!

273
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:46,416
<i>It looks like it's going</i>
<i>to be okay, Mom.</i>

274
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,583
<i>Even after everything</i>
<i>that happened this morning,</i>

275
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:51,500
<i>the Sohmas have still invited</i>
<i>me to stay in their house!</i>

276
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:54,750
<i>I guess this will be</i>
<i>our home for a while!</i>

277
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,708
Well, it not going
to clean itself!

278
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:18,208
I'll help you...
Just tell me what to do.

279
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:19,708
You'd better not...

280
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,666
The closest thing Yuki's
ever seen to a mop

281
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,291
is that haircut of his...

282
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:24,833
I think he'd just
get in the way.

283
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:26,875
That's all right.
I'll take care of it!

284
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:29,458
We all made a deal that
I'd do the housework

285
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:31,416
in exchange for my room...

286
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,833
I wouldn't be earning my
keep if I let you two help me!

287
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:36,000
Well I can see
we're in good hands...

288
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,333
I'm going to go find Kyo,

289
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:39,541
and I'll be out with
him for a while...

290
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,041
We should be back by lunchtime.

291
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,416
Sure, just leave it to me!

292
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,041
In that case,
I guess I'll go out too...

293
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:49,208
Fine! I'll be done
when you get back!

294
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:53,375
What was I thinking? I don't
even know where to start...

295
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,125
But Tohru Honda never gives up!

296
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,916
And that's that!

297
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,666
Amazing! If I
didn't know better,

298
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,916
I'd think I walked into
the wrong house...

299
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,291
Since when did we
have a rice cooker?

300
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:17,625
I found it in the trash!

301
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,208
Oh... by the way...

302
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:23,333
I hope you've got your appetite,
'cause lunch is almost ready!

303
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:28,000
Mmm, it's delicious.

304
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:31,000
You think so?
You don't think it's to bland?

305
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:34,500
It's perfect!
The best lunch I've ever had!

306
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,083
Don't be silly...

307
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:37,500
That reminds me,

308
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:40,000
I wonder where Shigure
and that stupid cat ran off to?

309
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,708
I don't know. He said
they'd be back by lunchtime...

310
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:44,125
Well shame on them...

311
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:46,833
It's rude to let a meal
this good get cold.

312
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:52,416
<i>It's so strange.</i>
<i>I guess I still haven't</i>

313
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,958
<i>gotten used to the</i>
<i>idea of living here.</i>

314
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,375
<i>But here I am,</i>
<i>having lunch with Yuki!</i>

315
00:17:57,458 --> 00:18:00,875
Oh yeah... You went out
for a while too, didn't you?

316
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:02,708
Where'd you go? Shopping?

317
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:05,875
Oh, no... I just went out
back to my secret base.

318
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:08,458
What?
You have a secret base?!

319
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,000
You mean like a fort?
Or an underground hideout?!

320
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,875
That sounds so exciting!

321
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:14,250
I don't think it's
quite as elaborate

322
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:15,875
as what you're thinking...

323
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:17,875
But I'll tell you what. Next
time, I'll take you with me.

324
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:21,416
What? Do you really mean it?!
I'm going to a secret base.

325
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,125
I've always wanted
to see one in person.

326
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:25,250
The neighborhood boys
had one when I was a kid,

327
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:26,541
but they told me
girls weren't allowed.

328
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:27,416
I can't wait to see it!-

329
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,333
Stop! Kyo, just listen to me!

330
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:30,625
I don't wanna hear it!

331
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,083
You think it's fun jerking
me around like that?

332
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:35,000
Now hold on. It wasn't-
okay, it was a little bit fun.

333
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:37,583
But that's not why I did it!
It was for your own good!

334
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:39,416
And don't forget,
it was Akito's decision!

335
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,541
Shut up!
I don't give a damn about Akito!

336
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:44,375
Oh, um... Are you hungry?
I made you some lunch.

337
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:45,916
Shut up!

338
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,916
Kyo! Don't take
this out on Tohru!

339
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,041
And use the front
door next time!

340
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,208
And take off your shoes!

341
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:52,458
You're setting
a fine example...

342
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,791
This is the first time
I've seen you in a suit.

343
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:55,708
It looks good on you!

344
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:56,875
You don't say?

345
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:57,916
You look like a butler.

346
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,583
Ah! Lunch is ready!

347
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:02,708
Yes, but shouldn't
we see about Kyo?

348
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:05,708
Oh, him? He just needs
to let off some steam.

349
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:08,458
He's angry that I made
him take an entrance exam.

350
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,750
An entrance exam? For what?

351
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,791
Funny you should ask.

352
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,291
As of today, Kyo is officially

353
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,125
the newest student
at your school...

354
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:19,250
Oh, and he's going to be
living with us from now on, too.

355
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,375
Don't you take
a single bite. Get out!

356
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:25,916
Oh well, I had a
feeling you'd be upset...

357
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:31,500
You see, Kyo pulled a
bit of a vanishing act on us.

358
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:34,125
He just up and
disappeared for four months...

359
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,208
And do you where
he disappeared to?

360
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:38,625
He was up on a
mountaintop, training.

361
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,708
What kind of training?

362
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,458
Let me guess.
He's been meditating

363
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:45,166
under waterfalls
and fighting bears.

364
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:48,541
Well, I'm not so
sure about that part.

365
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:52,500
The point is, Kyo
really wants to beat Yuki.

366
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:55,791
Stupid cat.

367
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,916
<i>So Kyo spent all that</i>
<i>time trying to beat Yuki.</i>

368
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,125
<i>And Yuki really doesn't seem</i>
<i>to like Kyo at all, either.</i>

369
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,250
<i>This is just like the old story.</i>

370
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:08,916
<i>After the rat tricked the cat,</i>

371
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,416
<i>the cat must have been</i>
<i>angry for a long, long time.</i>

372
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,208
<i>Maybe that's why Yuki</i>
<i>and Kyo don't get along...</i>

373
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:16,916
<i>I don't know.</i>

374
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,833
<i>And somehow, I get the feeling</i>

375
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:21,625
<i>he wouldn't want to talk</i>
<i>about it with me...</i>

376
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,708
I wonder if he can
tell us about Yuki!

377
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:30,375
--He's so cute!
--Not as cute as Yuki!

378
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,250
--Where is he?
--I think he's amazing!

379
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:35,416
--Oh wow! Oh, my goodness!
--What do you think?

380
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,250
Is he really
Prince Yuki's cousin?

381
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,583
I'll bet he knows
everything about him!

382
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,500
<i>Poor Kyo. He looks so scared.</i>

383
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:46,416
They're the same.

384
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,541
His electric signals are
exactly the same as Yuki's...

385
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,916
I don't know. But there's
something about them

386
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,208
that's almost inhuman...

387
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:58,125
Hana, that's just rude.

388
00:20:58,208 --> 00:20:59,875
Oh, hey! Question!

389
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,708
So this new guy is he
really your cousin or what?

390
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:05,541
Yes, that is the
rumor going around...

391
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:08,166
I prefer to leave it at that.

392
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,958
Hey, I thought we were talking!

393
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,333
Wait, come back!

394
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,083
What are you doing?!

395
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:18,583
Oh, Kyo! I don't think
that's a good idea!

396
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:21,875
Get off me! Let me up!

397
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:24,291
Leave me alone!!

398
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,541
Amazing! That proves it!

399
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,500
He's definitely
related to Prince Yuki!

400
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,000
I can't believe he jumped.

401
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,083
Hey, aren't you
forgetting about me?

402
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:36,875
I did just get my
arm ripped off...

403
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:40,208
That was hysterical!

404
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:43,416
He looked like a cat trying
to get out of a bath!

405
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,208
<i>Poor Kyo...</i>

406
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:52,500
<i>He really is like the cat</i>
<i>from the old story, Mom.</i>

407
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:55,041
<i>He must feel so</i>
<i>alone right now...</i>

408
00:21:55,125 --> 00:22:00,541
<i>But who knows? Maybe... Maybe</i>
<i>one day, we can be friends.</i>

409
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:06,666
<i>Now let's all gather,</i>

410
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:12,208
<i>Enjoying the company we share,</i>

411
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:17,541
<i>Our tears will dissolve</i>
<i>into thin air,</i>

412
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:23,500
<i>As we drink up</i>
<i>this wonderful life.</i>

413
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:28,416
<i>La, la, la...</i>

414
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:34,541
<i>Takin' in all the</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

415
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:39,625
<i>La, la, la...</i>

416
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:45,666
<i>Drinkin' up all this</i>
<i>good love and life.</i>

417
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:50,708
<i>La, la, la...</i>

418
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:56,458
<i>Take it in all this</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

419
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:24,291
<i>But as for me...</i>

420
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:26,541
<i>I'm going to prove it once and</i>
<i>for all that I'm better than you</i>

421
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:28,416
<i>and then I'm going</i>
<i>to take my place</i>

422
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,916
<i>as a true member</i>
<i>of this family.</i>

423
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,083
<i>But if you don't keep training</i>

424
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:33,666
<i>you won't be ready</i>
<i>when that happens.</i>

425
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,750
<i>It will never happen anyway!</i>

426
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:38,500
<i>I guess that's why</i>
<i>I get so angry with him</i>

427
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,708
<i>because he can't</i>
<i>even see what he has.</i>

428
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:42,541
<i>He's blinded by</i>
<i>that foolish desire</i>

429
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:44,000
<i>to join the very same family</i>

430
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:47,375
<i>I've spent my whole life</i>
<i>trying to run away from.</i>

431
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:48,708
<i>I hope I'm not prying,</i>

432
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:50,166
<i>but if there's something</i>
<i>that's bothering you,</i>

433
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:52,666
<i>you know you can talk to</i>
<i>me about it, if you want.</i>
