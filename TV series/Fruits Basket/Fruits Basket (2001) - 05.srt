1
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:18,125
<i>I was so happy when you smiled,</i>

2
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:21,708
<i>Your smile breaks</i>
<i>through the clouds of grey,</i>

3
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:28,625
<i>Far from the sunny days</i>
<i>that lie in sleep.</i>

4
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:31,583
<i>Waiting with patience</i>
<i>for the Spring,</i>

5
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:35,583
<i>when the flowers will</i>
<i>bloom renewed again,</i>

6
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:42,625
<i>knowing there's more</i>
<i>beyond the pain of today.</i>

7
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:49,000
<i>Although the scars</i>
<i>of yesterday remain,</i>

8
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:56,458
<i>You can go on living as</i>
<i>much as your heart believes.</i>

9
00:00:56,541 --> 00:01:02,958
<i>You can't be born again</i>
<i>although you can change.</i>

10
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:09,666
<i>Let's stay together always.</i>

11
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:35,833
Let's see, I'm pretty sure this
is the right section... Ah!

12
00:01:35,916 --> 00:01:37,750
Here it is!

13
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:41,541
"Fiery Spirit:
The Inner Life

14
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:45,041
of the Martial Artist"...
Sounds exciting.

15
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:46,750
My master put
me through hell

16
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:48,583
up there in the
mountains... but...

17
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:51,083
those were some of the
best days of my life!

18
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:53,750
It's like every day was
an adventure, right?

19
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:56,000
I'd wake up every
morning and ask myself...

20
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:58,375
"How much stronger
am I gonna get today?"

21
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:01,416
Just talking about
it gets me pumped up!

22
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:07,958
Okay, next stop...
Gardening! Hmm...

23
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:09,708
Oh, hey. This looks
like a good one.

24
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:12,041
"Twelve Steps To A
Happy Home Garden"

25
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:14,708
Ah, the base! Those leeks
we picked were delicious.

26
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:16,458
Are you planting
something new?

27
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:18,541
Yes, strawberries.

28
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:21,291
Really? I can't wait!
I love strawberries!

29
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:26,333
I thought you might....
That's why I'm planting them.

30
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:31,166
I'm glad I've gotten to know
Yuki and Kyo as well as I have.

31
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,791
But I'd still like to get
to know them even better.

32
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:36,000
I think I can,
little by little.

33
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:37,041
And learning more about
the things they like

34
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:39,166
seems like a good
way to start.

35
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,708
"One Hundred
Family Recipes".

36
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:43,875
I'll bet there are some
great dinner ideas in here.

37
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:46,541
I'd like to check
these out, please.

38
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,833
Ah, Miss Honda.
I've been looking for you.

39
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:50,208
Oh?

40
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:51,000
You have a phone call
waiting in the staff office.

41
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,416
Come with
me, please?

42
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,833
Yes sir...

43
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:57,875
This is Tohru...

44
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:00,000
Grandpa! Hi!

45
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:11,541
I just found out the
renovations are done.

46
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:17,500
I uh, I got
a phone call

47
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:20,125
from my grandfather
up at the school...

48
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:21,541
He told me.

49
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:24,041
Ah, I see... And
if memory serves,

50
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,833
you were panning to
move back into the house

51
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:27,416
once the work was
done, is that right?

52
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,083
What renovations?

53
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:30,708
Oh, I guess we never
told you, Kyo...

54
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,625
So what?
Tell me now.

55
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:34,375
Well, you see...

56
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:36,000
After mom died, I went to
stay with my grandfather,

57
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,708
on my father's side.

58
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:39,083
But then I found out
my aunt and her husband

59
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,791
were going to move
into the house with us,

60
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:41,958
and grandpa decided
it would be a good idea

61
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:43,708
to have some
remodeling done,

62
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,958
you know, to make more
room for everyone.

63
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,125
So he went away
to stay with my aunt

64
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:48,708
while the work
was going on,

65
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,875
and I stayed here so
I wouldn't miss school.

66
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:52,416
Well, I didn't
stay here here.

67
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,833
Not at first, I mean. I was
living in a tent for a while...

68
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:55,958
But anyway, now
that they've finished

69
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,416
with all the
construction,

70
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,500
it looks like I
can go back-

71
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:02,958
Okay! Enough
already! I get it...

72
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:05,791
I'm sorry, I just
thought... eh...

73
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:06,958
Don't mind him.

74
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:07,916
I think we caught
him a little off-guard

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,875
with the
news is all...

76
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,083
We've just witnessed
a classic example

77
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,916
of what I like to call
"misdirected rage".

78
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,041
I believe the technical
term is "being an ass"?

79
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,500
You are so
full of it!

80
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:20,000
I guess I can understand.
This does seem sudden.

81
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:22,458
I suppose I should go ahead
and get my things packed

82
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,541
while I still have the
rest of the afternoon.

83
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,375
I'll try to be out of
your way by this evening.

84
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,250
Please, don't hurry
on our account.

85
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:29,875
Feel free to take as
much time as you need.

86
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,208
Thanks, but I'm sure
they could use my

87
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:33,125
help straightening
up and everything.

88
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:34,500
And like the
saying goes:

89
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:36,041
"never put off 'til tomorrow
what you can do today!"

90
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:41,500
So then, I'll be right
upstairs if you need me.

91
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,166
Oh, Yuki... Thank you
so much for everything

92
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,791
you've done
for me...

93
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,791
Uh... any time...

94
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:02,750
A thousand perfectly lovely
things you could have said,

95
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,416
but what poetry spews
from your mouth?

96
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,458
"Any time."
Really, Yuki.

97
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:08,208
I think that must be the
most unsentimental thing

98
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:09,666
I've ever heard,

99
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,833
or at the very
least insensitive.

100
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:13,208
How do you expect to
sustain any sort of,

101
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:15,375
I don't know, meaningful
relationship...

102
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:30,250
Aren't you going to try?
To stop her I mean.

103
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:31,750
Why would I?

104
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:32,916
We've known from the start
that she was only staying here

105
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
until the remodeling
was finished...

106
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:40,333
Hmm. Well, even so... It does
seem stuffy in here doesn't it?

107
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:41,708
Let her go...

108
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,125
We should have never
allowed an outsider

109
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,833
in this house
to begin with...

110
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,583
I really had it
wrong this time.

111
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:54,875
I don't know
why I thought

112
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:56,916
I'd be able to go on
living here with everyone,

113
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,333
like a family.

114
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:02,541
Oh, Mom... I can be such a
fool sometimes. Can't I?

115
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,375
You know, this reminds
me of something

116
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:06,541
that happened when
I was little.

117
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,208
There was that game all
the kids used to play.

118
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:10,541
"Fruits Basket."

119
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,208
You're an apple.

120
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:14,208
You're a banana.

121
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,541
You're an orange.

122
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,208
You're a watermelon.

123
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:17,875
Cherry.

124
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:18,875
Pear.

125
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:21,041
Peach.

126
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:24,208
Tohru, you get to
be the rice ball!

127
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:27,083
The rice ball! Ooh,
that's sounds yummy!

128
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:29,833
I guess they were only trying
to tease me a little bit,

129
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:31,666
the way kids
do sometimes...

130
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,333
But I didn't know that then.

131
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:35,583
The game went on,

132
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:38,291
and all the other kids
were called, one by one.

133
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,541
Everyone was running,
and laughing...

134
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:43,208
And the whole time
I sat there, smiling,

135
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:44,833
hoping one of them would
shout out "Rice Ball"

136
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,875
so I could play too...

137
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,708
Yeah... Even
since back then,

138
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:55,250
I've never been very good about
thinking things through...

139
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,416
I should have known.

140
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,208
There was no way I could
have joined the others.

141
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:08,416
A "rice ball" doesn't
belong in a "fruits basket".

142
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:11,708
There's some fish left
in the refrigerator.

143
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:13,625
Eat it soon, so it
doesn't go bad, okay?

144
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,291
And you're almost
out of soy sauce,

145
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:17,166
so you'll need to pick
some up at the store...

146
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,458
Oh! And don't forget,

147
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:19,666
they changed the day they
pick up the garbage,

148
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,375
so be sure you put
it out in time...

149
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:22,833
What else?

150
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,250
Oh... Here!

151
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:26,750
I wrote down my grandfather's
address and everything.

152
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,041
So if there's anything
you can't figure out,

153
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:29,791
you know where
to find me!

154
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:32,041
Thank you, Tohru.
You really are too good to us.

155
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,666
Not at all! I'm the one
who should say that to you!

156
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:35,875
Uh... And
don't worry.

157
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:37,791
I won't tell anyone
about your family curse!

158
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,125
Cross my heart
and hope to die!

159
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,208
Speaking of which...
Where's that cat?

160
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:43,833
I'd think you
know by now.

161
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,083
After all,
sulking on the roof

162
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,291
does seem to be one of
the strange little ways

163
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,083
Kyo shows he cares...

164
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:52,166
Anyway, good luck
settling into your new home.

165
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,791
Thanks.

166
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:15,708
Well, as far
as goodbyes go,

167
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:18,125
that felt pretty
good, I guess...

168
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,041
Although I'd be
lying if I didn't say

169
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:28,375
it left me feeling a
little bit sad, too...

170
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,416
It's nice to
see you again.

171
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,958
I didn't expect to
see you so soon...

172
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:37,416
You certainly don't
waste any time.

173
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,833
Ah, Tohru!
Welcome home!

174
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,958
Hi, Grandpa. It's
good to be back.

175
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,666
I hope they
found everything.

176
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,916
I probably should
have stayed

177
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,583
to make sure they had
their dinner, at least.

178
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,416
Hey! Are you done putting
your junk away or what?

179
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,375
I'm sorry! I'm, uh,
I'm almost finished!

180
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:06,250
I swear. What's the point
of moving into a bigger house

181
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,458
if I'm gonna get stuck
sharing a room with someone?

182
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:11,416
Just put that stuff
somewhere I can't see it.

183
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:22,750
Tohru... I'm starving!
What's for breakfast?

184
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:29,083
I forgot... Our dear, sweet
Tohru has gone, gone away...

185
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,583
That sounded like you
'forgot' on purpose.

186
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:32,916
No, of course not!

187
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,875
That would be pretty
despicable, don't you think?

188
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,416
But you know,
without Tohru here,

189
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,958
it does feel like all
the fire's gone out

190
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:39,500
of this kitchen,
doesn't it?

191
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,375
Suddenly it seems
so cold and dreary.

192
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:44,458
Dammit! You are saying that
on purpose, aren't you?!

193
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:47,000
In any event, consumed
by grief though we are,

194
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:49,500
I suppose we can't help but
get hungry at some point...

195
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:50,750
Which reminds me,

196
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:51,791
Tohru left us a pot of
her delicious beef stew

197
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,750
in the refrigerator. Yes?

198
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,791
Perfect. Now why don't you
heat that up for us, Yuki?

199
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:58,875
Your joking, right?

200
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:00,125
Ah, of course.

201
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,000
You're not too handy in
the kitchen, are you...

202
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,333
Well, Kyo, I guess
that leaves you!

203
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:04,791
Why do I
gotta do it?!

204
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,208
No, no,
it's all right.

205
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:07,041
If you don't mind
letting the last

206
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:08,583
of the wonderful
beef stew

207
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,958
that Tohru put her heart and
soul into preparing for us

208
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:12,750
get burned to a crisp,
then neither do I.

209
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,958
After all, I suppose
burnt beef stew

210
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:17,416
will be just as satisfying
as burnt miso soup,

211
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,708
or burnt rice,
or burnt eggs,

212
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,375
or any of the fine burnt
dishes Yuki used to make

213
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,666
for us before Tohru
fell into our lives...

214
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,500
Ah, yes, we all
seemed to do quite well

215
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,416
on our
charcoal-rich diet.

216
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,416
I'm sure there's no
reason we won't grow

217
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,583
accustomed to
it again-huh?

218
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,291
I'd have to rate your
presentation a zero.

219
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,666
Fine! So do it
yourself next time!

220
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,625
We thank you for this stew,
Tohru, wherever you are.

221
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,875
I'm in heaven.

222
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:54,083
And to think, two bright,
handsome young men like you

223
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,625
couldn't even
find a way

224
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:58,541
to keep the girl who cooked this
delicious stew from leaving.

225
00:10:58,625 --> 00:10:59,791
Oh, the tragedy...

226
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,208
If she can go back to
her grandfather's house,

227
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:03,416
there's no reason for her
to stay here, is there?

228
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,750
I'm afraid only our
sorrow will tell us,

229
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:10,041
as the long lonely hours
without her pass us by.

230
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:12,916
And our only solace

231
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,750
will be the few scattered
traces of Tohru's presence

232
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,750
left about the house.

233
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:20,916
Like this cute little
strawberry towel, for instance.

234
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,166
I found it still
hanging in the shower.

235
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,083
I have but to press
it against my face...

236
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:29,041
and the sweet scent of Tohru
reminds me of happier days!

237
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,125
[Kyo]
You sick bastard!

238
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:40,541
Say, I found these socks in
my drawer. You put them there?

239
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,833
Oh... is that not right?

240
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,916
Do these really look
like something I'd wear?

241
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,958
I-I'm sorry. I must have
thought they were yours...

242
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,041
Oh, I swear,
what's the use?

243
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:53,166
Make a note: these are
grandpa socks. Remember that.

244
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,875
Tohru, could you
spare a moment?

245
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:56,250
Coming!

246
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,916
Could you bring me one of the
big serving plates, please?

247
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,708
Uh... Sure. Okay.

248
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:15,500
For future reference, we keep
the serving plates over here.

249
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:46,375
I didn't know it was a full
moon tonight. It's beautiful.

250
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:49,958
I wonder if Yuki and
Kyo can see this right now.

251
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:52,416
Maybe we're all looking
at the moon together.

252
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,208
Well, hi there!
Good morning!

253
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,583
Uh... Yeah, hi.

254
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,250
Miss Honda.
Good morning.

255
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,500
And a good
morning to you.

256
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,500
So. How is life at
grandfather's house?

257
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:54,666
Oh, fine I guess. Everyone's
been really nice to me so far.

258
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,250
They're making me
feel right at home!

259
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,666
That's good. Sounds like
you're fitting right in.

260
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,583
Uh, huh.

261
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:07,708
[Teacher] In 1687, the Animal
Protection Act was introduced.

262
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:09,000
This is, of
course, noteworthy,

263
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,041
as it marks
the first time

264
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:12,291
anything of this
sort was attempted.

265
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:13,583
Now, the APA,
as I'll call it,

266
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:14,375
came up once
again in 1770...

267
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,833
So. That's it...

268
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:18,041
From now on, I guess
I shouldn't expect

269
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,041
things to
be the same

270
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,208
between me and
Yuki and Kyo.

271
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,208
Ah, welcome home!

272
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:33,041
"Hi Shigure. It's good to be
home." Is that too much to ask?

273
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:45,500
I've always liked the
cat from the Zodiac!

274
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:46,750
Right straight!

275
00:14:57,458 --> 00:15:01,333
Really? I can't wait!
I love strawberries!

276
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,083
You can erase
my memory.

277
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:05,875
But afterwards, promise
you'll still be my friend?

278
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,166
Oh, hello. I'm
back for the day.

279
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,750
Tohru, could
you spare a moment?

280
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,000
Sure...

281
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,541
It's my understanding
that you've been living

282
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,208
in a house with
three men,

283
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,291
is that right?

284
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:28,708
No way! You were
shacked up!? Nice going!

285
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:31,458
I had a detective agency
do some checking up on you.

286
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:32,708
Yeah? No kidding!

287
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:35,208
So those kinds of things
still exist nowadays?

288
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,791
I don't understand. Why would
you go to all that trouble?

289
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,208
On account of
our oldest son.

290
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:41,541
It's his dream to
become a policeman.

291
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,375
So you can see how it
might cause a problem

292
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:44,625
for him, were anyone
in his family

293
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,625
to have a
criminal record...

294
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,833
At first, I did
think hiring

295
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:51,875
a detective agency
seemed a bit extreme.

296
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:54,916
Until I remembered how
wild Kyoko was in her youth...

297
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,916
"Like mother, like daughter,"
as they say. Or so I feared.

298
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:01,541
Now... as long as you
are living in this house,

299
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,000
I have to ask you
not to do anything

300
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,750
so reckless
in the future...

301
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,541
Tell us Tohru...

302
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,291
Living in a house
with three guys?

303
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:12,083
I'll bet you had all
sorts of fun, didn't you?

304
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:21,791
Grandpa,
what did you...?

305
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:24,333
Don't you know how
to do anything

306
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:27,625
besides
ridicule others?

307
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:30,541
Tohru, I apologize...

308
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:33,333
Please don't think
poorly of them...

309
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:36,166
They're just disagreeable
folks by nature.

310
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,875
Grandpa! What's
gotten into you?

311
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,500
You can't say that!

312
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:47,666
Tohru?

313
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:53,000
Please understand, this
family is dear to me.

314
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,958
And this is
where I live.

315
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:57,416
Even if they do say a
few thoughtless things,

316
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,541
I can
tolerate it.

317
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,833
However, there's no
reason for you

318
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:04,291
to put up with it to
keep living here.

319
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:05,791
Y- you want me to-

320
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:06,958
Ah, it's not
like that.

321
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:10,166
I'm not trying to
chase you out of here.

322
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,708
It's just that it
wasn't like Kyoko

323
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:15,541
to put up with anything,
and you are her daughter.

324
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:16,875
Do you understand?

325
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:19,916
Kyoko would be more
vivacious living in a place

326
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,833
where she could
spread her arms wide.

327
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,750
Your father would
have said so as well.

328
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,583
My father? Really?

329
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:31,375
So, if there's somewhere
you'd rather be,

330
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,500
Darling you can go.

331
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,916
But, that
wouldn't be right!

332
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,125
How could I be anything less
than grateful for what I have?

333
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:40,875
I've been blessed with
a mother who loved me,

334
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:43,000
two wonderful
friends, Hana and Uo.

335
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,541
What more could
I possibly want

336
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:45,583
when I have
people in my life

337
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:48,166
who care about me as
much as they do?

338
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,916
There are so many people
who've been kind to me.

339
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,083
Yuki and the
others... and you!

340
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:58,166
You've given me a place at your
table, a roof over my head...

341
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,416
I should feel like the
luckiest girl in the world...

342
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,041
I have so much to be
thankful for, right here.

343
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:07,208
So... where else
would I rather be...?

344
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:10,541
Except... I didn't think that
leaving Yuki and the others

345
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:14,375
would make me feel
so... so lonely.

346
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:17,041
There was still so much I hoped
to learn about all of them...

347
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,083
I wanted us
to go on eating

348
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:20,375
our meals together,
like a family...

349
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:21,458
where I could
to talk to them

350
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,375
about so many
things... everything.

351
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:27,708
The truth of it is, I didn't
want to leave them at all.

352
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:29,791
I felt like I
belonged there...

353
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:30,833
I wanted to stay
in that house

354
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:34,125
with Yuki, and
Kyo, and Shigure...

355
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,291
I wanted to stay.

356
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:39,541
[Yuki] In that case...

357
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:42,333
...why not come home?

358
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:44,875
Yuki--

359
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:45,916
Who is this?

360
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,208
C'mon. Let's go.

361
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:54,833
Kyo? You're here
too? But then...

362
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:58,083
Uh... No wait,
Kyo... I...

363
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,916
I hope you
don't mind.

364
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,500
The door was unlocked so
we let ourselves in...

365
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,500
Can I find Miss Honda's
things upstairs?

366
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:08,791
Now, just a moment. Who are
you? What is going on here?

367
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:11,166
Don't worry. We'll be out of
your way before you know it.

368
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,500
Ahh... I get it now.

369
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:14,750
These must be two of the
guys the little tramp

370
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:17,166
was shackin' up with.

371
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:23,875
Don't you ever talk about
Miss Honda that way again.

372
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,666
You low-life.

373
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,791
Uh... um... wait...
Kyo, how did you get here?

374
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:34,416
What do you mean, 'how'?
You left the directions!

375
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,833
And what kind of a
stupid map was that anyway?

376
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:39,375
I got stuck having to
walk around half this city

377
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:42,083
looking for you
with that damn Yuki!

378
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:46,000
I told you we're going the
wrong way! Now gimme that map!

379
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:47,583
Uh- uh.

380
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:49,875
They must have been
fighting the whole way,

381
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:52,500
and they still
came to find me...

382
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,333
What the hell are
you smiling about?!

383
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:56,625
Oh, I uh-I'm sorry.

384
00:19:56,708 --> 00:20:00,458
Uh... That's not what
I meant to say. I uh...

385
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,375
What I mean is...
I just...

386
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:06,208
you know I- I don't even
know why I'm doing this!

387
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,250
It's just, for some reason,
ever since you left,

388
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,541
I've been getting pissed
off about everything!

389
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:11,625
And I couldn't
figure out why,

390
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,041
so it just pissed
me off even more.

391
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,666
And, really!

392
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,833
If you didn't
want to leave,

393
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,541
you could of said so
from the beginning!

394
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:20,000
You ever think
about that?!

395
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,000
Wha- but how do you-

396
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:24,083
We heard you.
Every word.

397
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:30,375
Ya' know... You can
tell people what you want.

398
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,666
I mean, it's annoying if
you do it all the time...

399
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,625
but I'd say in
your case...

400
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,916
You could stand to speak up
for yourself a little more.

401
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,625
Complain a little, get
upset or something.

402
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:42,083
Let people know
what's on your mind.

403
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,625
It's what you
gotta do sometimes.

404
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:56,375
Oh, come on! What did I say?
Why are you crying?!

405
00:20:56,458 --> 00:21:00,375
Can we go? Please,
I... I want to...

406
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:04,750
I want to go home... Take me
back to the house now, okay?

407
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:16,208
So walk, already. I'm not gonna
drag you the whole way there.

408
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:25,375
Rice Ball!

409
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,750
It's true, Mom...

410
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:37,666
I really must be the
luckiest girl in the world.

411
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:52,833
I think... I'm
where I belong...

412
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:57,833
Here. In this house.
With my new family.

413
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:01,166
It's so good
to be home!

414
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:06,916
<i>Now let's all gather,</i>

415
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,458
<i>Enjoying the company we share,</i>

416
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:17,791
<i>Our tears will dissolve</i>
<i>into thin air,</i>

417
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:23,750
<i>As we drink up</i>
<i>this wonderful life.</i>

418
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:28,708
<i>La, la, la...</i>

419
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:34,791
<i>Takin' in all the</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

420
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:39,875
<i>La, la, la...</i>

421
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:45,916
<i>Drinkin' up all this</i>
<i>good love and life.</i>

422
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,958
<i>La, la, la...</i>

423
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:56,750
<i>Take it in all this</i>
<i>sweet love and life.</i>

424
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:32,250
[Hana] Perhaps we should
have them invite us over.

425
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:33,500
I'd like to
see for myself

426
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:35,375
whether or not, this is
a suitable environment

427
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:36,791
for you to be living.

428
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:39,083
[Uo] Hey, great idea.
Let's check it out right now.

429
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:41,000
[Hana] Wait. If we
show up unexpectedly

430
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:42,541
they may not
serve snacks.

431
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:44,583
Ooh! Another good point.
Your two-for-two.

432
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:45,916
[Tohru] Wait...

433
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,291
[Uo] Okay then, we'll
stay over tomorrow night.

434
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:49,041
Uh, okay.
