00:00:14.264 --> 00:00:16.725
[roars]

00:00:16.767 --> 00:00:18.268
[cries]

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.063
[CHIHO] Please, Hii.
Try your best to be quiet.

00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:22.439
[MAOU]
Just look at that thing.

00:00:22.481 --> 00:00:24.191
We need a plan.

00:00:24.233 --> 00:00:25.442
Get out of here.

00:00:25.484 --> 00:00:28.654
Take the others
and go find Kazuma.

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:30.656
Emi and I will handle the bear.

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:32.783
Sir.

00:00:32.824 --> 00:00:35.285
Please, follow me.

00:00:35.327 --> 00:00:36.912
Here goes nothing

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.961
All we have to do
is scare it away.

00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:00.352
What, are you gonna
sumo the damn thing?

00:01:00.394 --> 00:01:01.895
Shooting from the hip here!

00:01:01.937 --> 00:01:03.981
You could help, ya know!

00:01:04.022 --> 00:01:06.733
[KAZUMA]
Hinako! Hitoshi!

00:01:06.775 --> 00:01:08.735
Huh? What's she doing?

00:01:08.777 --> 00:01:11.488
Huh? Awesome, now they
totally think I'm a freak.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:12.614
Cool!

00:01:32.676 --> 00:01:36.888
Mama is so cool!
She made Mister Bear go "Bleh!"

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:13.985
[URUSHIHARA] Check it!
Somebody made the news.

00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:16.530
"Woman working at
local farm wrestles bear

00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:19.866
and miraculously
sends it flying."

00:03:19.908 --> 00:03:22.619
Weird, I wonder
who gave them the story.

00:03:22.661 --> 00:03:24.287
[EMI whines]

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:28.875
[distant chatter]

00:03:28.917 --> 00:03:30.585
[HINAKO]
We don't know anything about it.

00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:32.212
You all should go.

00:03:34.464 --> 00:03:35.257
Come on.

00:03:35.298 --> 00:03:37.926
You're lucky nobody
snapped a picture of you.

00:03:37.968 --> 00:03:41.847
You'd have to flee the country
to avoid those hacks.

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:43.432
This sucks!

00:03:43.473 --> 00:03:45.559
I never would've had to wrestle
the damn bear in the first place

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.396
if it weren't for that stupid
horny toad of a driver!

00:03:49.438 --> 00:03:51.231
Please, friends,
keep yourselves calm.

00:03:51.273 --> 00:03:53.150
We'd hate to concern our hosts.

00:03:53.191 --> 00:03:54.401
[URUSHIHARA, EMI]
Hmm?

00:03:54.443 --> 00:03:55.819
Hello, sir.

00:03:57.028 --> 00:03:58.155
Yusa.

00:03:58.196 --> 00:03:59.614
Let's talk.

00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:11.460
[KAZUMA]
You protected the people I love.

00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:13.295
I am forever in your debt.

00:04:13.336 --> 00:04:16.965
Huh? Uh. No prob.

00:04:17.007 --> 00:04:17.841
Rest up.

00:04:17.883 --> 00:04:20.177
You've more than
deserved it, after all.

00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:23.430
[sighs]

00:04:23.472 --> 00:04:26.600
If he had chosen to pry
about your uncanny strength,

00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:30.479
I was prepared to tamper
with his memories.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.981
On his behalf,
neither he nor the good Hinako

00:04:33.023 --> 00:04:35.609
has disclosed the details
of the brawl to me,

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.070
therefore I'm confident they
wouldn't do so to the press.

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:41.281
Perhaps that's
all thanks to Chiho.

00:04:41.323 --> 00:04:44.785
Their worries might be deterred
by the fact that you're friends.

00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:46.203
Makes sense.

00:04:46.244 --> 00:04:48.872
On the whole, you'll make it
out of this unscathed,

00:04:48.914 --> 00:04:51.166
though you now have the
nickname "Bear-Buster."

00:04:51.208 --> 00:04:53.877
[EMI] Huh? Excuse-me-I'm-sorry-
I-beg-your-pardon,

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:55.754
who is calling me what?

00:04:55.796 --> 00:04:57.547
[laughs] "Bear-Buster"!

00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:58.465
[growls]

00:04:58.507 --> 00:04:59.549
Um. No fear.

00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:01.968
Merely the Devil
and Alciel are using it.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.178
[EMI growls]

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.263
I'll kill them
with my Bear hands!

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:07.974
Please postpone your fury!
They're out with Manji,

00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:10.769
and your bloodlust might
scare the country folk!

00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:12.437
Come on, Bel, let go!

00:05:12.521 --> 00:05:14.064
And have you seen Alas Ramus?

00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:15.941
Crap, what if she's with them?

00:05:15.982 --> 00:05:17.192
She's downstairs!

00:05:17.234 --> 00:05:18.985
The children are napping!

00:05:19.027 --> 00:05:19.861
Worry not!

00:05:19.903 --> 00:05:21.238
[EMI]
Oh, I'm worrying!

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:22.364
Can you imagine it?

00:05:22.405 --> 00:05:23.907
That sweet baby voice saying.

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:27.118
"I love you, Bear-Buster.
Sweet dreams, Bear-Buster!"

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.330
You've been bustin' demons all
over the place for years now.

00:05:30.372 --> 00:05:31.998
I don't get the big deal.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.377
Shut up or I'll
"bust" your fat head! Hya!

00:05:40.006 --> 00:05:41.883
Think this is the last one.

00:05:41.925 --> 00:05:43.426
Great, thank you for your help.

00:05:43.468 --> 00:05:44.970
[ASHIYA]
Mister Manji!

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:47.138
I've completed
the bulk of the weeding.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.098
[MANJI]
Roger that.

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:50.308
Great work today, boys.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.269
[MAOU] Hope things
go smoothly from here.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.063
[MANJI] They should, I'm just
gettin' too old for this.

00:05:55.105 --> 00:05:57.858
I wish I could retire and
leave it in Kazuma's hands,

00:05:57.899 --> 00:05:59.109
but there's no way.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.362
I can't let up when he and
Yumiko are working so hard.

00:06:02.404 --> 00:06:03.822
Wait, Yumiko, too?

00:06:03.864 --> 00:06:04.656
That's right.

00:06:04.698 --> 00:06:05.782
My wife's the one responsible

00:06:05.824 --> 00:06:09.244
for expanding the family
enterprise in the first place.

00:06:09.286 --> 00:06:10.662
She inspired our son to study

00:06:10.704 --> 00:06:13.206
business and
agriculture in Tokyo.

00:06:13.248 --> 00:06:14.165
[MAOU]
Wow.

00:06:14.207 --> 00:06:16.251
With them on board, we're doing
three times the business

00:06:16.293 --> 00:06:18.420
we did back in my dad's day.

00:06:18.461 --> 00:06:19.629
[MAOU]
Three times?

00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:20.964
Impressive!

00:06:21.006 --> 00:06:23.717
[MANJI] Kazuma borrowed some
solar panels from his university

00:06:23.758 --> 00:06:26.803
and put 'em on the land
that we can't farm.

00:06:26.845 --> 00:06:27.846
He headed an initiative

00:06:27.888 --> 00:06:31.725
to sell organic veggies
straight to Tokyo restaurants.

00:06:31.766 --> 00:06:33.977
We used to throw away
misshapen produce,

00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:37.355
but he packages it up
and sells it at a discount.

00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:39.524
[ASHIYA] Ahh...
Are those panels over there

00:06:39.566 --> 00:06:41.151
the ones you mentioned?

00:06:41.192 --> 00:06:42.652
[MANJI]
Yes, those are them!

00:06:42.694 --> 00:06:43.987
The electricity they generate

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:46.489
runs the fans inside
our greenhouses.

00:06:46.531 --> 00:06:47.657
They're hugely important

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:51.202
when it comes to maintaining
temperature and humidity.

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:53.914
Those panels give us
the power to grow so much.

00:06:53.955 --> 00:06:55.874
Science is great, isn't it?

00:06:59.794 --> 00:07:01.796
[MAOU]
It all makes sense.

00:07:01.838 --> 00:07:04.966
I think I understand why the
demon realm warred nonstop

00:07:05.008 --> 00:07:08.178
before I united it.

00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:09.971
Why's that, Sire?

00:07:10.013 --> 00:07:12.223
[MAOU] With enough magic
in the atmosphere,

00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:14.601
demons don't need to eat.

00:07:14.643 --> 00:07:17.187
That's why there was no society.

00:07:17.228 --> 00:07:19.606
We didn't need to produce food.

00:07:20.482 --> 00:07:21.608
[MANJI]
Hey!

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:23.068
We should head on back!

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:27.572
You don't want your dinner
to get cold, now do ya?

00:07:27.614 --> 00:07:29.032
I'd rather it be warm.

00:07:37.248 --> 00:07:38.375
Something's up.

00:07:38.416 --> 00:07:41.002
No one's safe, I hear there
are victims in Miyada, too.

00:07:41.044 --> 00:07:41.920
[MANJI]
Hey, neighbor!

00:07:41.962 --> 00:07:43.421
What's going on?

00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:45.840
[ONDA]
Hello, Manji. Perfect timing.

00:07:45.882 --> 00:07:47.258
Huh?

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.261
I don't think I've had the honor
of meeting these fellows.

00:07:50.303 --> 00:07:52.097
Well, then, allow
me to introduce you

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:53.765
to Maou and Ashiya.

00:07:53.807 --> 00:07:56.393
They're part-timers
Senichi recommended.

00:07:56.434 --> 00:07:59.688
Meet Mister Onda, neighborhood
association president.

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:02.899
[ONDA] I guess you
guys aren't suspects, then.

00:08:02.941 --> 00:08:05.568
Someone's been robbing
fields in the area.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:08.488
And it looks like
they're going after fruit.

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:09.823
[gasping]

00:08:10.949 --> 00:08:12.492
[MAOU] He said they've
stolen high-value fruits,

00:08:12.534 --> 00:08:13.493
like watermelons,

00:08:13.535 --> 00:08:16.287
and region-specific
or specialty vegetables.

00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:18.206
And they take a ton.

00:08:18.248 --> 00:08:21.626
The Sasakis raise watermelons
and specialty tomatoes.

00:08:21.668 --> 00:08:23.712
[URUSHIHARA]
Yep, it's made the news.

00:08:23.753 --> 00:08:25.130
No front pages, though.

00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:28.383
Let's patrol the farm tonight
and catch 'em ninja style?

00:08:28.425 --> 00:08:31.177
With all these fields, it's way
too much ground to cover.

00:08:31.219 --> 00:08:33.138
Plus, it's impossible to
know exactly whether or not

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:35.140
the culprit
will be here tonight.

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:36.224
That's true.

00:08:36.266 --> 00:08:38.935
On top of that, we do have
an early morning tomorrow.

00:08:38.977 --> 00:08:40.228
We wouldn't want
to wear ourselves out

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.439
patrolling the
grounds for nothing.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.273
Hey, Chi.

00:08:43.314 --> 00:08:46.776
Have Kazuma and the others
mentioned anything about a plan?

00:08:46.818 --> 00:08:49.404
They said that they'll think
about countermeasures.

00:08:49.446 --> 00:08:52.198
But no, nothing
concrete like that.

00:08:53.658 --> 00:08:54.617
That face.

00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:56.453
What are you thinking?

00:08:56.494 --> 00:08:58.913
[MAOU]
Okay, hear me out.

00:08:58.955 --> 00:09:01.166
The crimes have
all happened in a week.

00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:02.459
They must have some safe place

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.669
where they can sell
the goods quickly.

00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:07.255
To steal from fields,
they'd need a vehicle.

00:09:07.297 --> 00:09:10.633
A pickup would blend
in but expose the cargo.

00:09:10.675 --> 00:09:12.677
An 18-wheeler might work.

00:09:12.719 --> 00:09:15.513
But it would be super easy
to track down.

00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:17.849
Let's cut to the chase,
Sherlock.

00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:20.435
[MAOU] Do I have
to spell it out for you?

00:09:20.477 --> 00:09:22.103
The car we saw today.

00:09:22.145 --> 00:09:25.065
It'd be the perfect for lowlifes
on the prowl for produce.

00:09:25.106 --> 00:09:27.067
Don't you think?

00:09:27.108 --> 00:09:28.985
You wouldn't be able
to see it at night.

00:09:29.027 --> 00:09:30.820
It's big, so it can carry a lot.

00:09:30.862 --> 00:09:34.407
And it didn't seem to have
trouble driving on dirt roads.

00:09:34.449 --> 00:09:36.576
You might actually be correct.

00:09:36.618 --> 00:09:38.453
It's just a hypothesis.

00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:40.830
But if it turns out I'm right,

00:09:40.872 --> 00:09:43.416
tonight's the night
they'll show up.

00:09:43.458 --> 00:09:45.960
They wouldn't expect us to be
in the out pitch-black fields

00:09:46.002 --> 00:09:48.963
after there was
a bear attack today.

00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:50.799
Come sundown, the Sasaki farm

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.926
will be their ideal
hunting ground.

00:09:52.967 --> 00:09:53.802
What'll they want?

00:09:53.843 --> 00:09:54.886
Watermelons?

00:09:54.928 --> 00:09:57.388
Maybe, But I'm sure
they grow plenty of crops

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:59.599
that we haven't seen yet.

00:09:59.641 --> 00:10:02.060
I heard about some
organic vegetables.

00:10:02.102 --> 00:10:05.105
You think they might
be after those?

00:10:05.146 --> 00:10:07.899
Emi, Suz, could you
fly up above the farm?

00:10:07.941 --> 00:10:10.360
Might help to get
a birds-eye view.

00:10:10.401 --> 00:10:11.778
Yeah, nah.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.739
Sure, we can fly, but it's not
like we have night vision.

00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:18.201
And people seeing us up in
the sky would be real bad news.

00:10:18.243 --> 00:10:19.452
Yeah, you're right.

00:10:19.494 --> 00:10:20.829
Ay, yo, Geek Squad!

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:24.207
Doesn't that one search engine
have super-detailed maps?

00:10:24.249 --> 00:10:25.917
Gimme a break, grandpa.

00:10:25.959 --> 00:10:30.505
Those maps aren't, like,
updated in real time.

00:10:30.547 --> 00:10:32.423
Should we stake it out?

00:10:32.465 --> 00:10:34.884
Maybe we should ask someone
who actually knows the land.

00:10:34.926 --> 00:10:37.846
Whoever these thieves may be,

00:10:37.887 --> 00:10:40.682
they tried to goad a bear
into mauling me and Emi.

00:10:40.723 --> 00:10:42.308
They don't have any problem
with hurting people

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:44.769
to get their hands
on what they want.

00:10:44.811 --> 00:10:48.314
We can't let the Sasakis get
any more involved in this.

00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:50.233
But we might be able
to turn the tables

00:10:50.275 --> 00:10:51.943
if Emi or Suz
scares 'em straight

00:10:51.985 --> 00:10:53.736
with some celestial force.

00:10:53.778 --> 00:10:56.072
How do you propose
that we keep watch?

00:10:56.114 --> 00:10:58.032
The land's too vast for us five.

00:10:58.074 --> 00:11:01.327
That's without counting
good Chiho, of course.

00:11:01.369 --> 00:11:03.913
Oh, awesome, that means
you're counting me.

00:11:03.955 --> 00:11:07.125
We'll patrol the areas
we are familiar with. Yes?

00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:08.918
[MAOU]
That might be our best option.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.129
But first, let's think
about which routes

00:11:11.171 --> 00:11:12.213
that car could take.

00:11:12.255 --> 00:11:14.549
Did someone just say routes?

00:11:14.591 --> 00:11:16.217
How long have you been there?

00:11:16.259 --> 00:11:17.135
When did you--?

00:11:17.177 --> 00:11:19.637
I didn't sense
her presence at all.

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:22.640
Did you hear anything?
Any weird stuff?

00:11:22.682 --> 00:11:25.727
[EI] Well, hun,
I don't need hearing aids yet.

00:11:25.768 --> 00:11:27.729
But don't you worry
your little heads,

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:29.230
your secret is safe with me.

00:11:29.272 --> 00:11:32.108
I won't tell anyone the plan.

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:33.693
Wait, really?

00:11:33.735 --> 00:11:35.987
[EI] The details went right over
my head, and I don't have

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:39.616
the energy to go blabbin'
people's secrets anymore.

00:11:39.657 --> 00:11:44.287
Maybe you aren't quite
typical folks like Chiho or me.

00:11:44.329 --> 00:11:46.497
But it's clear that
you have good hearts,

00:11:46.539 --> 00:11:48.625
and that you want
to protect my family.

00:11:48.666 --> 00:11:50.877
How could anything else matter?

00:11:50.919 --> 00:11:55.215
Thank you for all you've
done for us already.

00:11:55.256 --> 00:11:57.258
You. Show me what
you're looking at there.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.469
Uh, yes, ma'am.

00:12:02.513 --> 00:12:03.681
[EI]
You got a pen?

00:12:03.723 --> 00:12:05.308
Yes.

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:08.436
[EI] This path intersects with
the biggest road on the farm.

00:12:08.478 --> 00:12:10.897
Right over here is where
you had that grisly run-in

00:12:10.939 --> 00:12:12.148
with the bear.

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:13.942
The only places a big car
could get through

00:12:13.983 --> 00:12:16.986
are here, here,
and all the way over here.

00:12:17.028 --> 00:12:19.614
Geography Grandma!

00:12:19.656 --> 00:12:21.241
[EI]
That would put them closest

00:12:21.282 --> 00:12:23.785
to the watermelons and
the tomato greenhouse.

00:12:23.826 --> 00:12:25.245
That's excellent.

00:12:25.286 --> 00:12:28.623
It's much simpler with
just two locations, right?

00:12:28.665 --> 00:12:30.124
We shall split up into groups.

00:12:30.166 --> 00:12:32.001
One with Suzuno,
and one with Yusa.

00:12:32.043 --> 00:12:34.212
Slow down a sec.

00:12:34.254 --> 00:12:35.546
What about this spot?

00:12:35.588 --> 00:12:36.506
My bet?

00:12:36.547 --> 00:12:37.548
It'll get hit.

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.717
Dude, that's not even a field.

00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:41.219
[URUSHIHARA] Exactly,
it's a way better target

00:12:41.261 --> 00:12:44.555
than a bunch of
nasty vegetables.

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:46.516
You could store them
until it's safe to sell,

00:12:46.557 --> 00:12:48.226
and they won't go bad.

00:12:48.268 --> 00:12:49.310
What do you mean?

00:12:49.352 --> 00:12:50.228
We're lost.

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:51.104
Just think.

00:12:51.145 --> 00:12:53.898
Even at dirt-cheap prices,
they'd bring in some dough.

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:57.860
Way more dough than a few dozen
vegetables ever could.

00:12:57.902 --> 00:13:00.363
You guys got to see
them up close, yeah?

00:13:00.405 --> 00:13:02.198
We saw them earlier today.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:05.285
With the right tools, even
an amateur could remove them.

00:13:05.326 --> 00:13:07.078
They would fit in that car.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.414
I'd say they're
about tatami mat size.

00:13:09.455 --> 00:13:11.291
So, not too big.

00:13:11.332 --> 00:13:12.959
And you could stack them up.

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:15.336
Wait a second.
Do you mean--?

00:13:15.378 --> 00:13:17.964
Uh-huh.
And if they get away with them,

00:13:18.006 --> 00:13:19.757
everything growing
in those greenhouses

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:22.093
is virtually garbage.

00:13:22.135 --> 00:13:24.512
They want the
most valuable thing here.

00:13:24.554 --> 00:13:26.306

Since Urushihara's
our resident tech wiz,

00:13:33.062 --> 00:13:35.606
we needed to station

But I should text

Why's that car driving so slow?

They're searching for something.

00:17:51.153 --> 00:17:52.446
What's going on?

00:17:52.488 --> 00:17:54.574
[police sirens]

00:17:54.615 --> 00:17:56.450
Crap!

00:17:58.619 --> 00:17:59.579
[MAOU]
I hope you're not dumb enough

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:02.331
to think this is "bad luck."

00:18:02.373 --> 00:18:05.042
You brought this on yourself.

00:18:05.084 --> 00:18:08.462
We only stole to survive.

00:18:08.879 --> 00:18:12.091
But you and your little friends
stole out of greed.

00:18:12.133 --> 00:18:15.428
Without a care in the world
about the people you're hurting.

00:18:15.469 --> 00:18:17.597
If I had let you
make a clean getaway,

00:18:17.638 --> 00:18:21.392
you never would've given them
another thought, would you?

00:18:21.434 --> 00:18:22.602
What a shame.

00:18:22.643 --> 00:18:23.686
That greed.

00:18:23.728 --> 00:18:26.564
It's rotting your heart
from the inside out.

00:18:27.773 --> 00:18:29.692
Demon! Augh!

00:18:29.734 --> 00:18:32.153
Whatever remains
of your measly life,

00:18:32.194 --> 00:18:37.658
will be spent atoning for
carelessly harming others.

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:40.077
Same way I'll spend mine.

00:18:43.372 --> 00:18:45.750
[KAZUMA] Maou and
the others caught the thieves?

00:18:45.791 --> 00:18:47.710
You're certain they got them,
and they're all right?

00:18:47.752 --> 00:18:51.047
Well, I can feel a cold energy
from down in the valley.

00:18:51.088 --> 00:18:53.549
At the very least, it's over.

00:18:53.591 --> 00:18:55.635
Ah! There they are!

00:18:56.636 --> 00:18:58.304
How did they manage it?

00:18:58.346 --> 00:19:01.641
[EI] I saw folks like them
all the time in my day.

00:19:01.682 --> 00:19:04.852
But now that our lives are
so much safer and easier,

00:19:04.894 --> 00:19:07.271
I reckon there's no need
for people to be born

00:19:07.313 --> 00:19:09.940
with special powers
like there used to be.

00:19:09.982 --> 00:19:10.775
[COP]
Goodnight.

00:19:10.816 --> 00:19:12.443
[CHIHO] You had me worried
for a second there!

00:19:12.485 --> 00:19:15.071
Good grief.
I'm so glad you're all okay!

00:19:15.112 --> 00:19:18.115
Thanks for all your help!

00:19:18.157 --> 00:19:19.742
Chin up.

00:19:19.784 --> 00:19:22.161
Whoever they are,
they protected your wife and son

00:19:22.203 --> 00:19:23.412
and saved the farm.

00:19:23.454 --> 00:19:27.625
But more than that, it's clear
our Chiho trusts them.

00:19:27.667 --> 00:19:30.628
Let's leave it at that.

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:34.423
Well, if Chiho trusts them,

00:19:34.465 --> 00:19:36.634
then the best thing we can
do is put 'em to work

00:19:36.676 --> 00:19:39.679
like usual tomorrow morning.

00:19:42.431 --> 00:19:43.391
[DELIVERY GUY]
You have a delivery!

00:19:43.432 --> 00:19:45.893
Signature, please.

00:19:45.935 --> 00:19:47.311
[ASHIYA]
How extraordinary!

00:19:47.353 --> 00:19:48.729
With this hefty bounty
in addition

00:19:48.771 --> 00:19:50.439
to our ever-so
generous paychecks,

00:19:50.481 --> 00:19:52.733
our wallets will be
smiling for months!

00:19:52.775 --> 00:19:55.945
I worry your joy is
clouding our predicament.

00:19:55.986 --> 00:19:57.822
These won't fit
in the refrigerators.

00:19:57.863 --> 00:19:59.240
How goes it, Chi?

00:19:59.281 --> 00:20:02.159
We got a sweet delivery
from Komagane.

00:20:02.201 --> 00:20:03.703
I wanted to give you
a quick call

00:20:03.744 --> 00:20:06.747
just to say thanks to you
and your parents.

00:20:06.789 --> 00:20:08.874
Yeah, could you put them on?

00:20:08.916 --> 00:20:10.543
Hey, this is Maou!

00:20:10.584 --> 00:20:12.920
First of all, thank you so much.

00:20:12.962 --> 00:20:13.921
Uh-uh!

00:20:13.963 --> 00:20:16.674
[URUSHIHARA] Just got a news
flash about our veggie villains.

00:20:16.716 --> 00:20:18.092
"The suspects were
found responsible

00:20:18.134 --> 00:20:21.095
for a series of produce thefts,
upon which they were charged

00:20:21.137 --> 00:20:24.140
and turned over to the
public prosecutor's office."

00:20:24.181 --> 00:20:26.851
"The young men who committed the
crimes were university students,

00:20:26.892 --> 00:20:30.020
using their meager spoils
as fun money."

00:20:30.062 --> 00:20:32.648
The sheer belligerence
of those cretins!

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:34.316
[URUSHIHARA] Apparently,
they were all messed up

00:20:34.358 --> 00:20:35.192
after they were caught,

00:20:35.234 --> 00:20:39.321
and started telling the officers
that they "saw a demon."

00:22:14.917 --> 00:22:16.710
[ALAS RAMUS]
"She's gonna get me!"

00:22:16.752 --> 00:22:18.295
[EMI]
Where is this supposed to go?

00:22:18.337 --> 00:22:19.922
[ALAS RAMUS]
No, she won't!

00:22:19.964 --> 00:22:22.800
You're not gonna bust
my bear, are you, Mama?

00:22:22.842 --> 00:22:24.468
No busting?

00:22:25.553 --> 00:22:28.889
Of course not.
Don't worry, bear.

00:22:28.931 --> 00:22:30.599
Screw you, Maou!

00:22:30.641 --> 00:22:33.811
I'll wring your scrawny neck
till your head pops off!

00:22:33.853 --> 00:22:37.064
[ALAS RAMUS] Bear-Buster,
Bear-Buster, Bear-Buster,

00:22:37.106 --> 00:22:38.440
Bear-Buster...

00:22:38.482 --> 00:22:41.610
[EMI]
Hmm? Something's bugging me.

00:22:41.652 --> 00:22:44.446
There isn't a crazy amount
of negative emotion here.

00:22:44.488 --> 00:22:47.491
So how was Maou
able to transform?

00:22:47.533 --> 00:22:49.702
Could it be the <i>kappa</i>?

00:22:49.743 --> 00:22:50.536
What?

00:22:50.578 --> 00:22:52.705
They say the exhibits in
that museum are genuine

00:22:52.746 --> 00:22:55.291
and curated by ethnographers.

00:22:55.332 --> 00:22:57.668
Perhaps he took
humanity's terror of <i>kappa</i>

00:22:57.710 --> 00:23:01.630
accumulated over millennia
and converted it to magic.

00:23:01.672 --> 00:23:04.550
Seems within reason.

00:23:05.426 --> 00:23:06.886
[ALAS RAMUS]
Mama?

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:14.018
[EMI] I've been letting my guard
down around them a lot lately.

00:23:15.644 --> 00:23:19.189
But there are several ways they
could regain their true power.

00:23:19.231 --> 00:23:20.399
Even here in Japan.

00:23:20.441 --> 00:23:22.651
[NEWSCASTER] Due to that,
the investigation is ongoing.

00:23:22.693 --> 00:23:24.653
[phone ringing]

00:23:24.695 --> 00:23:26.113
Howdy, stranger.

00:23:26.155 --> 00:23:27.156
It's been a while!

00:23:27.197 --> 00:23:29.325
[EMERADA]
I know! I'm so busy recently!

00:23:29.366 --> 00:23:32.077
It's tricky
to find time to call.

00:23:32.119 --> 00:23:35.581
Ah. Guess what,
I just got back from Nagano.

00:23:35.623 --> 00:23:36.916
I did all kinds of farm work!

00:23:36.957 --> 00:23:38.584
We harvested eggplants
and cucumber--

00:23:38.626 --> 00:23:39.835
That's all great.

00:23:39.877 --> 00:23:42.421
But there's something
I need to ask you.

00:23:42.463 --> 00:23:45.007
Has Lailah dropped by recently?

00:23:45.049 --> 00:23:47.551
Huh? Who's whom now?

00:23:47.593 --> 00:23:49.303
Well, that's an odd reply.

00:23:49.345 --> 00:23:51.096
Isn't Lailah your mother?

00:23:51.138 --> 00:23:52.514
Huh?
