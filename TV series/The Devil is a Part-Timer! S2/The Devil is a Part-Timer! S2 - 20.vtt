00:11:54.762 --> 00:11:57.433
-You doo-doo for brains!
-[screams] You're killing me!

00:11:57.517 --> 00:11:59.270
Uh, you okay, Mister Maou?

00:11:59.354 --> 00:12:00.815
We heard you scream.

00:12:00.899 --> 00:12:02.653
-Everything good?
-[ACIETH] See, that?

00:12:02.736 --> 00:12:04.447
Chiho brought us
some frozen treats!

00:12:04.531 --> 00:12:07.663
-I scream for ice cream!
-[BOTH gasps]

00:12:07.746 --> 00:12:09.332
Whoa! You startled me!

00:12:09.415 --> 00:12:12.004
[MAOU] Bad freak!
Don't scare our guests!

00:12:12.589 --> 00:12:14.467
I'm trying to heal in here?

00:12:14.551 --> 00:12:16.012
Dial it back a notch.

00:12:17.599 --> 00:12:19.018
[CHIHO]
Hmm.

00:12:19.102 --> 00:12:21.022
[gobbling]

00:12:21.106 --> 00:12:22.526
So yum!

00:12:22.609 --> 00:12:25.072
I'm gonna pop back inside
for a post-snack cuddle.

00:12:25.155 --> 00:12:26.408
-Okay?
-Heck, no!

00:12:26.491 --> 00:12:28.036
Keep your baby hands
to yourself!

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.957
Ever heard of personal space?

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.126
Get off of me!

00:12:31.209 --> 00:12:33.548
How cute.
Maou-Maou's so shy-shy.

00:12:33.631 --> 00:12:35.092
Here's the deal, pal.

00:12:35.175 --> 00:12:36.679
You're clearly
making him uncomfy,

00:12:36.762 --> 00:12:39.935
so either you can cut it out,
or no more ice cream for you!

00:12:40.018 --> 00:12:41.522
[ACIETH]
Loud and clear, ma'am!

00:12:41.856 --> 00:12:43.609
-[gasps]
-What are you doing?

00:12:43.693 --> 00:12:44.987
When Alas Ramus gets back

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:46.699
and sees you've been
spoiling Acieth,

00:12:46.782 --> 00:12:47.617
she'll get jealous

00:12:47.701 --> 00:12:49.621
and develop some
serious dada issues!

00:12:49.705 --> 00:12:51.291
I'm dying. Shut up.

00:12:51.876 --> 00:12:53.045
[clears throat]

00:12:53.128 --> 00:12:55.174
Can we please get down
to business, people?

00:12:55.257 --> 00:12:56.301
Yeah, of course.

00:12:58.013 --> 00:12:59.892
I had Chiho fill me in
on everything

00:12:59.975 --> 00:13:01.227
going on with you guys.

00:13:01.311 --> 00:13:02.354
Emi's the Hero.

00:13:02.438 --> 00:13:03.608
Ashiya's a demon.

00:13:03.691 --> 00:13:05.820
And they're in Ente Isla,
now, right?

00:13:05.904 --> 00:13:06.781
Whatever.

00:13:06.864 --> 00:13:08.701
The Devil thing threw me
for a loop, though.

00:13:08.785 --> 00:13:11.331
You're brave to come back here
after learning all of that.

00:13:11.414 --> 00:13:14.546
I hid in bed for two days
working up the courage.

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:17.009
After some thought,
I know where I stand.

00:13:17.093 --> 00:13:19.848
Before anything else,
Emi and Ashiya are my friends.

00:13:19.932 --> 00:13:21.769
I want to help them,
any way I can.

00:13:22.102 --> 00:13:23.940
I don't want my memories erased.

00:13:24.023 --> 00:13:24.942
[gasps]

00:13:25.025 --> 00:13:26.152
I see.

00:13:26.236 --> 00:13:28.574
They're real lucky
to have you in their corner.

00:13:28.658 --> 00:13:29.785
[door knocks]

00:13:30.537 --> 00:13:33.041
Satan, a moment, please.

00:13:33.709 --> 00:13:34.545
[MAOU gasps]

00:13:34.628 --> 00:13:37.049
Anybody care to explain?

00:13:37.133 --> 00:13:39.470
How did these bad boys
wind up here?

00:13:39.555 --> 00:13:41.057
It's no sorcery, my dude,

00:13:41.141 --> 00:13:43.270
Suzuno drove one,
and I drove the other.

00:13:43.353 --> 00:13:45.567
She can't drive!
No license!

00:13:46.484 --> 00:13:47.612
Au Contraire.

00:13:47.696 --> 00:13:48.573
Freshly won.

00:13:48.656 --> 00:13:51.077
[MAOU]
You seriously beat me?

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.789
I don't know
what kinda twisted game

00:13:52.873 --> 00:13:53.958
you're trying to play,

00:13:54.041 --> 00:13:55.043
but you're on!

00:13:55.127 --> 00:13:56.170
[SUZUNO]
What was the alternative?

00:13:56.254 --> 00:13:59.385
Did you intend to embark
upon this journey to Ente Isla

00:13:59.468 --> 00:14:01.807
without a reliable mode
of transportation?

00:14:01.891 --> 00:14:04.186
We need a simple way
to carry provisions.

00:14:04.563 --> 00:14:06.357
If we tried to travel
through the air,

00:14:06.441 --> 00:14:08.613
we would be detected
immediately.

00:14:08.696 --> 00:14:10.992
Our power levels
would give us away.

00:14:11.075 --> 00:14:13.706
[MAOU] You're forgetting
I don't have a license yet.

00:14:13.789 --> 00:14:17.714
You don't need a moped license
to drive a scooter in Ente Isla.

00:14:17.797 --> 00:14:18.966
I--

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:20.093
So!

00:14:20.177 --> 00:14:21.889
How much did
these scooters cost?

00:14:21.972 --> 00:14:24.770
[SUZUNO] They're used,
so about 500,000 yen in total.

00:14:24.853 --> 00:14:28.234
[gasps] That hurts! [groans]

00:14:28.778 --> 00:14:30.740
So much dough.

00:14:32.159 --> 00:14:34.748
So, what?
Do we think Emi's okay?

00:14:35.625 --> 00:14:37.629
I can tell you
that Emi isn't hurt.

00:14:37.712 --> 00:14:38.839
If you're worried
about her being

00:14:38.923 --> 00:14:39.758
in physical danger,

00:14:39.841 --> 00:14:42.262
stop it and save your energy.

00:14:42.346 --> 00:14:43.181
Huh?

00:14:43.264 --> 00:14:45.645
Whenever Emilia is in Ente Isla,

00:14:45.728 --> 00:14:48.024
a tank could fire at her
using its full force,

00:14:48.108 --> 00:14:49.443
and she would be able
to walk away

00:14:49.528 --> 00:14:50.863
from the skirmish
without so much

00:14:50.947 --> 00:14:52.659
as a frayed hair or broken nail.

00:14:52.742 --> 00:14:53.786
This ain't manga!

00:14:53.869 --> 00:14:56.959
My worry is if someone so strong
is having it tough,

00:14:57.042 --> 00:14:58.796
the rest of the world is
in shambles.

00:14:58.879 --> 00:14:59.798
[gasps]

00:14:59.881 --> 00:15:00.800

00:15:01.969 --> 00:15:03.639
-Wassup?
-Oh, wow.

00:15:04.056 --> 00:15:06.185
You're so compassionate!

00:15:06.269 --> 00:15:08.314
You're much sweeter
than most people think.

00:15:09.025 --> 00:15:10.820
Huh? I'm not sweet.

00:15:10.903 --> 00:15:13.199
Maybe not, but you are dense.

00:15:13.283 --> 00:15:14.828
Oh, to be young and dumb.

00:15:14.911 --> 00:15:16.414
He's trying, though!

00:15:16.497 --> 00:15:17.959
Well, as I was saying.

00:15:18.043 --> 00:15:19.963
In order for Emi
to get stuck like that,

00:15:20.047 --> 00:15:21.592
I'm sure her hands are tied.

00:15:21.675 --> 00:15:23.804
They could be holding
the whole country hostage!

00:15:24.263 --> 00:15:28.188
And, Olba's the only jerk
I know that scared of a fight.

00:15:28.271 --> 00:15:29.775
If she's with him,

00:15:29.858 --> 00:15:31.360
I bet they're in Efzahan,

00:15:31.444 --> 00:15:33.616
home to the Malebranche
he stirred up.

00:15:33.699 --> 00:15:35.703
There doesn't seem to be
a wealth of evidence

00:15:35.787 --> 00:15:36.872
for your conclusion.

00:15:36.955 --> 00:15:38.584
Wealth of evi-deez nuts.

00:15:38.667 --> 00:15:39.628
Whiny!

00:15:40.963 --> 00:15:42.299
Here, jerk.

00:15:42.382 --> 00:15:44.345
Why rest, when I can root around
like a hog?

00:15:44.846 --> 00:15:47.852
There wouldn't be any rooting
if you weren't such a slob.

00:15:48.353 --> 00:15:50.357
The castle gave Gabriel a call.

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:52.361
You're telling me
angels have cellphones?

00:15:52.946 --> 00:15:53.906
[MAOU]
Guess so.

00:15:54.198 --> 00:15:57.412
And thanks to that goon leaving
his number with Urushihara,

00:15:57.496 --> 00:16:01.087
we could confirm that Ashiya,
Emi, Alas Ramus, and old Nord-y

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:03.341
are kicking it in Efzahan.

00:16:03.424 --> 00:16:05.972
I don't know why we would trust
Heaven's Himbo.

00:16:06.055 --> 00:16:06.890
[MAOU]
I'm with you.

00:16:06.974 --> 00:16:08.434
That's why I'm leaving you
in Japan

00:16:08.519 --> 00:16:09.855
to keep an eye
on things at home.

00:16:09.938 --> 00:16:10.773
[groans]

00:16:10.857 --> 00:16:12.276
If any real shit goes down,

00:16:12.359 --> 00:16:14.113
it'll have to wait
till I'm healed.

00:16:14.196 --> 00:16:16.242
Couldn't you use
the extra muscle?

00:16:16.325 --> 00:16:17.620
I'm sure that we could.

00:16:17.704 --> 00:16:19.498
Alas, it's impossible.

00:16:19.583 --> 00:16:21.712
The more bodies we have
entering through the gate,

00:16:21.795 --> 00:16:24.593
the more
celestial force expenditure.

00:16:24.676 --> 00:16:25.720
But I worry.

00:16:25.803 --> 00:16:27.807
We'll barely have power for two.

00:16:27.891 --> 00:16:28.934
No biggie.

00:16:29.018 --> 00:16:30.771
Worst case, Amane pops over.

00:16:30.855 --> 00:16:32.775
I totally saw that one coming.

00:16:33.401 --> 00:16:35.615
Are you going to tell us
why you're here?

00:16:35.698 --> 00:16:37.284
We're on the edge of our seats.

Please, you don't wanna ruin
the mystery.

Anyway, to thank you
for the food and shelter,

I'll protect Chiho and Rika
if things go south on our end.

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:49.809
You know,
Efzahan is an immense region.

00:16:49.893 --> 00:16:50.937
Where first?

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:53.149
-Use your head, that's a given.
-Huh?

00:16:53.609 --> 00:16:55.195
They'll be right
where the Demon King

00:16:55.278 --> 00:16:56.615
stuck it to Emilia.

Heavensky Keep.

00:17:08.096 --> 00:17:10.726
I told everybody to wait
at the apartment.

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:13.524
Don't be mad, they wanted
to see you off.

[KISAKI]
Jeez, Ma.

00:17:14.734 --> 00:17:17.072
You must be up
to something important.

00:17:17.155 --> 00:17:19.619
You rarely ask for time off
on short notice,

00:17:19.703 --> 00:17:21.915
let alone give up shifts.

00:17:21.999 --> 00:17:24.003
And on top of that,

Uh, yeah.

Sorry about that.

[KISAKI]
No need to be sorry.

00:17:29.723 --> 00:17:32.645
Just don't hurt yourself
or get sick while you're away.

00:17:35.191 --> 00:17:37.321
I can't afford to lose
such a strong member

00:17:37.404 --> 00:17:38.991
of my front line.

00:17:40.703 --> 00:17:42.039
[MAOU]
I'll keep that in mind.

Hey, Chiho, come here!

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:46.798
What's with your manager?

00:17:46.882 --> 00:17:48.677
Is she super strong
or something?

00:17:48.761 --> 00:17:50.180
I mean,
she has the literal devil

00:17:50.263 --> 00:17:51.975
-doing her bidding, after all.
-[chuckles]

00:17:52.059 --> 00:17:53.394
She's just like you and I.

A regular Japanese gal.

00:17:55.816 --> 00:17:58.572
But she's a great boss
that's easy to respect.

00:17:59.323 --> 00:18:00.951
She pays close attention,

00:18:01.035 --> 00:18:03.832
and learns all her employee's
strengths and weaknesses.

00:18:03.916 --> 00:18:05.377
She acknowledges us
for our work,

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:07.632
and praises us
for a job well done.

00:18:07.715 --> 00:18:09.719
Mister Maou went
from being a demon king

00:18:09.803 --> 00:18:10.679
with a bunch of power

00:18:10.763 --> 00:18:13.059
to a normal guy that
the world had power over.

00:18:13.602 --> 00:18:16.775
That made him really respect
Miss Kisaki's strength.

00:18:16.858 --> 00:18:18.821
You don't need armies
to have power.

00:18:19.906 --> 00:18:21.409
[SARUE] My bounty is
as boundless as the sea,

and divine to boot,

00:18:25.166 --> 00:18:27.087
it is no wonder
my love did take root!

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:29.258
Where poetry flourishes
manners lack,

00:18:29.341 --> 00:18:31.095
but come fine miss for Sarue's--

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:32.849
-[shouts]
-[screams]

00:18:32.932 --> 00:18:34.602
[gasps] Hey, watch it!

00:18:34.686 --> 00:18:36.565
[groaning]

00:18:40.155 --> 00:18:41.658
[KISAKI]
Is something wrong, Ma?

00:18:41.742 --> 00:18:42.743
Oh, nothing.

00:18:42.827 --> 00:18:44.121
Just makin' that java.

00:18:44.413 --> 00:18:46.500
[KISAKI]
What did I say about rhyming?

00:18:47.419 --> 00:18:48.755
Forgive me, Miss.

00:18:48.839 --> 00:18:50.509
And more than that,
I'm afraid I must ask you

00:18:50.593 --> 00:18:52.555
to make my order
to go this evening.

00:18:59.778 --> 00:19:01.531
You have any clue
what got into her?

00:19:01.615 --> 00:19:02.658
Is she going crazy?

00:19:03.242 --> 00:19:04.537
[ACIETH]
Mean! Lemme out!

00:19:04.621 --> 00:19:05.664
Enough outta you!

00:19:06.207 --> 00:19:07.710
I don't know for sure,

00:19:07.794 --> 00:19:10.883
but Acieth and Alas Ramus have
some anti-angel thing going on.

00:19:10.966 --> 00:19:12.678
[ACIETH]
Lemme out, poopy head!

00:19:15.559 --> 00:19:19.233
Was that little wretch the child
condemned to fuse with Emilia?

00:19:19.316 --> 00:19:22.197
They're the same being, I think,
but different forms.

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:23.909
And what form is that?

00:19:23.992 --> 00:19:25.411
She seemed like a shard.

00:19:25.495 --> 00:19:26.330
[URUSHIHARA]
Beats me.

00:19:26.413 --> 00:19:28.710
The sephiroth stuff is
after my time.

00:19:29.253 --> 00:19:31.550
I ditched Heaven
way before all that crap.

00:19:31.633 --> 00:19:33.177
Sounds boring, so I'm glad.

00:19:33.971 --> 00:19:35.558
So, who's this joker?

00:19:35.641 --> 00:19:37.937
Not a regular
Sentucky Fried guy?

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:38.855
Right.

00:19:38.939 --> 00:19:42.195
That's the archangel Sariel,
and he too comes from our realm.

00:19:42.279 --> 00:19:44.701
You telling me that he works
with that jerk, Gabriel?

00:19:44.784 --> 00:19:45.619
Hmm?

00:19:45.703 --> 00:19:48.374
Lovely, what has Gabriel done
this time?

00:19:48.457 --> 00:19:50.211
[SUZUNO]
I assumed you already knew.

00:19:50.754 --> 00:19:52.090
[SARUE]
He did bring out an army

00:19:52.173 --> 00:19:55.013
to try and drag me back
to Ente Isla with him.

00:19:55.096 --> 00:19:57.058
But when I threatened him
with Gaze of the Fall,

00:19:57.142 --> 00:19:58.102
he gave up.

00:19:58.185 --> 00:19:59.021
That fool.

00:19:59.104 --> 00:20:00.733
How dare he obstruct business?

00:20:00.816 --> 00:20:02.068
[URUSHIHARA]
You poor guy.

00:20:02.152 --> 00:20:04.532
You're turning into Maou
as we speak.

00:20:04.616 --> 00:20:07.245
Perhaps this place
has changed me, too.

00:20:07.329 --> 00:20:10.043
The moment I gazed
upon my goddess Kisaki,

00:20:10.126 --> 00:20:11.630
I felt the desire
to use my power

00:20:11.713 --> 00:20:13.466
for someone other than myself.

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:14.510
It was a new feeling for me,

00:20:14.594 --> 00:20:17.600
but one I most
certainly found joy in.

00:20:17.683 --> 00:20:19.812
In this world, I'm allowed
to care for other people,

00:20:19.896 --> 00:20:22.484
not solely the security
of Heaven's walls!

00:20:22.568 --> 00:20:25.239
The only walls I care about now
are the ones I'll build

00:20:25.323 --> 00:20:26.910
for my goddess
and our beautiful family

00:20:26.993 --> 00:20:28.037
to live in someday!

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:29.999
Well, at least
you're a classy creeper.

00:20:30.333 --> 00:20:33.422
Thus, whatever you and your
little rag-tag gang decide,

00:20:33.507 --> 00:20:36.261
I'm not in the business
of helping or hindering.

00:20:36.345 --> 00:20:38.349
Starting now,
the only thing I care about

00:20:38.432 --> 00:20:40.771
is pursuing a future
with that beautiful babe!

00:20:41.564 --> 00:20:43.902
It would suck if one
of our Yesod homies killed you

00:20:43.986 --> 00:20:45.698
before you could
live the dream.

00:20:46.574 --> 00:20:47.785
Spill the beans.

00:20:47.868 --> 00:20:49.789
The hell did you guys do
to the sephiroth?

00:20:49.872 --> 00:20:52.377
Oh, give me a break,
I was never in a position

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:55.007
to do anything
to the Tree of Life directly.

00:20:55.551 --> 00:20:57.470
What I can tell you
is Heaven's motive

00:20:57.555 --> 00:21:00.476
for making the Tree
a priority in the first place.

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:04.359
Everything they've done

00:21:04.443 --> 00:21:07.867
has been to prevent a true God
from being born in Ente Isla.

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:08.785
[ALL]
Huh?

00:21:09.161 --> 00:21:12.292
Not a lot of braincells
between those guys, huh?

00:21:16.258 --> 00:21:17.469
Hey. Are we hidden?

00:21:17.553 --> 00:21:18.805
Is someone gonna tell on us?

00:21:18.889 --> 00:21:20.934
[RIKA] Aren't you supposed to be
the freakin' Devil?

00:21:21.018 --> 00:21:21.853
Grow a pair!

00:21:21.936 --> 00:21:24.316
We're trespassing,
that's, like, a felony!

00:21:30.746 --> 00:21:32.833
[gulping]

00:21:35.839 --> 00:21:39.262
[SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

00:21:48.114 --> 00:21:49.282
[RIKA CHIHO gasp]

00:21:49.366 --> 00:21:51.245
[grunting]

00:21:57.298 --> 00:21:58.425
The Gate.

00:22:05.022 --> 00:22:06.233
Move! Now!

00:22:06.316 --> 00:22:07.443
Right. Let's go.

00:22:08.154 --> 00:22:09.447
Be careful.
