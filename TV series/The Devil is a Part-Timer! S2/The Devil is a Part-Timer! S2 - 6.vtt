[AMANE] The Kimigahama
area is famous for its fog.

Some of the
old timers around here

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:18.143
still call this
the "Foggy Beach."

00:00:18.185 --> 00:00:19.978
It'll reach up the hill today.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.397
Hey, Maou.
Can I leave this to you?

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.609
I'm gonna show the ladies
to their inn, then I'll be back

00:00:25.651 --> 00:00:26.568

Sounds good.

There, there, it'll be okay.

It typically doesn't take
her this long to calm down.

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:33.951
Right?

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:39.456
Huh?!

Forget soupy, this is chowder.

If we were to
venture outside now,

00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:23.935
we'd struggle to find our
footing in this new terrain.

Someone's popular.

Nice, it's a text from Chi.

00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:34.196
Says they made it
to the inn safely.

00:02:34.237 --> 00:02:35.739
For real?

00:02:35.781 --> 00:02:37.199
[ASHIYA]
Something the matter, Sire?

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.533
Yeah, it's Amane.

00:02:38.575 --> 00:02:41.328
Apparently she ran off
somewhere, all of a sudden.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.955
Prolly went home
to escape your crazy.

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:45.957
Rude, and that's
not what Chi said.

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:47.292
If Amane was just going home,

00:02:47.334 --> 00:02:50.170
I think Chi wouldn't've
have used the phrase "ran off."

00:02:50.212 --> 00:02:53.173
Do you suppose she'll be
able to navigate this fog?

The thing sounds like a dragon!

I apologize. But look. There.

Do you see something
peculiar, as well?

[MAOU]
Uh...

Never seen fog before?

00:03:27.165 --> 00:03:30.377
Perhaps this is the
ghoul Amane spoke of?

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:34.464
Here in Choshi, we have a
legend about the Mouren Yassa.

00:03:34.506 --> 00:03:37.634
I doubt it, she said
those show up in boats.

Uh. Guys?

Is that--?

00:03:46.393 --> 00:03:48.854
We should investigate.

Just what could demons
be doing in Kimigahama?

I hear there's a super sexy
demon lord hanging out

in Sasazuka, so maybe
it's not that strange.

This is no time for levity!

I wish we could say it
was a coincidence.

Uh-oh. We can't keep this up.

00:10:33.758 --> 00:10:35.677
[CHIHO]
Two beers and a cola!

00:10:35.718 --> 00:10:37.804
Thanks for your patience!

00:10:37.846 --> 00:10:40.181
[SUZUNO]
Leave the salt yakisoba to me.

00:10:40.223 --> 00:10:43.476
Direct your attention to all
the orders that require sauce.

00:10:43.518 --> 00:10:46.938
Yes, do you have any shaved ice
machines available for lease?

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:49.274
ASAP. Sounds great.

00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:53.903
[MAOU]
Chi. Suzuno. Emi?

00:10:53.945 --> 00:10:57.157
Sorry, but we're in dire
need of your help!

00:10:57.198 --> 00:10:58.032
No prob!

00:10:58.074 --> 00:10:59.033
Understood.

00:10:59.075 --> 00:11:01.870
Just so you know,
you owe me now.

00:11:02.537 --> 00:11:04.873
This should be all the drinks
you ordered, guys!

00:11:04.914 --> 00:11:06.541
Thanks, sugar britches!

00:11:13.631 --> 00:11:15.592
Your drinks are free
since you got the lunch deal!

00:11:15.633 --> 00:11:17.635
Hell yeah!

00:11:17.677 --> 00:11:19.179
--[MAOU] Hey.
--[EMI] Hmm?

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:20.263
What's up?

00:11:20.305 --> 00:11:21.222
[MAOU]
Where's the kid?

00:11:21.264 --> 00:11:22.724
Use your brain, she's napping

00:11:22.765 --> 00:11:25.476
'cause we wore her out
on the beach this morning.

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:27.896
[MAOU] I guess that means
she's in the sword.

00:11:27.937 --> 00:11:29.230
On a much more urgent note,

00:11:29.272 --> 00:11:30.690
the shaved ice
machines I ordered

00:11:30.732 --> 00:11:33.151
should be getting
here any minute now.

00:11:33.193 --> 00:11:35.612
Why don't you grab 'em
while we hold down the fort?

00:11:35.653 --> 00:11:36.863
[MAOU]
Yeah, okay.

00:11:38.907 --> 00:11:40.033
Oof.

00:11:40.074 --> 00:11:42.869
Your Majesty.
I've developed a theory.

00:11:42.911 --> 00:11:43.703
[MAOU]
What?

00:11:43.745 --> 00:11:44.954
Yesterday.

00:11:44.996 --> 00:11:47.415
That could well have
been an angel's doing.

00:11:47.457 --> 00:11:49.292
A new angel in the game?

00:11:49.334 --> 00:11:51.044
Yeah, I'm not so sure.

00:11:51.085 --> 00:11:52.295
The cyclops was clear

00:11:52.337 --> 00:11:55.006
when he said a human
was the one who injured him.

00:11:55.048 --> 00:11:59.260
If so, there's one potential
suspect in this world.

00:11:59.302 --> 00:12:01.346
Olba, huh?

00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:09.020
[MAOU]
I'm beat!

00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:12.440
Here, have this!
It's from Miss Amane.

00:12:12.482 --> 00:12:14.692
Cool. Thanks Chi.

00:12:15.985 --> 00:12:18.321
And thanks for your help.
I mean it.

00:12:18.363 --> 00:12:19.530
If you all hadn't showed up,

00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:22.325
we seriously might've
been done for.

00:12:22.367 --> 00:12:24.535
I feel so bad that
I always make you worry

00:12:24.577 --> 00:12:25.995
and work extra.

00:12:26.037 --> 00:12:28.373
Hush up, I'm happy to be useful!

00:12:28.414 --> 00:12:30.083
Your swimsuit looks good.

00:12:30.124 --> 00:12:33.211
We might get a Chi fan club
coming back daily!

00:12:33.253 --> 00:12:36.047
Oh! That's really flattering
of you to say.

00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:38.174
Thanks so much, Mister Maou.

00:12:38.216 --> 00:12:41.552
So, you think, uh, I look good?

00:12:41.594 --> 00:12:43.721
Duh. Isn't that what I said?

00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:45.932
[AMANE]
Hey, what's going on over here?

00:12:45.974 --> 00:12:49.227
Cut it out. You really shouldn't
play favorites, Maou.

00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:51.688
Chiho's not the only one
who saved us.

00:12:51.729 --> 00:12:54.565
What about these goddesses?

00:12:55.566 --> 00:12:59.612
Um. Yeah, well,
I mean they, uh...

00:12:59.654 --> 00:13:02.115
Thank you. I'm grateful.

00:13:02.156 --> 00:13:04.075
There's no need to be grateful.

00:13:04.117 --> 00:13:06.035
I told you, you owe me.

00:13:06.077 --> 00:13:08.162
I'm sure I'll cash in
at some point.

00:13:08.204 --> 00:13:10.206
I don't want your gratitude.

00:13:10.248 --> 00:13:12.500
I'm only here to prevent
the undeniable fallout

00:13:12.542 --> 00:13:15.420
that would occur if you
were to lose these jobs.

00:13:15.461 --> 00:13:16.963
You get it.

00:13:17.005 --> 00:13:18.715
Come on, is that all?

00:13:18.756 --> 00:13:20.633
You can do way better than that!

00:13:20.675 --> 00:13:22.677
Give 'em some more sugar, dude.

00:13:22.719 --> 00:13:24.012
What do you mean?

00:13:24.053 --> 00:13:26.472
Be sweet to them like
you were with Chiho!

00:13:26.514 --> 00:13:29.600
We don't pick favorites
in this shack!

00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:33.646
I mean, thank you, but
there's nothing to compliment.

00:13:33.688 --> 00:13:35.565
Empty compliments
don't mean anything,

00:13:35.606 --> 00:13:37.108
so what's the point?

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:37.942
My liege!

00:13:37.984 --> 00:13:39.319
You're far too honest!

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.445
Are you serious?

00:13:40.486 --> 00:13:43.656
You should compliment them
even if it entails a white lie!

00:13:43.698 --> 00:13:46.242
What good would come
from me complimenting Emi?

00:13:46.284 --> 00:13:47.243
[EMI grunts]

00:13:47.285 --> 00:13:49.704
It's not about who
the compliment's from!

00:13:49.746 --> 00:13:51.914
Hell, there are days when
I would accept a kind word

00:13:51.956 --> 00:13:54.042
from a <i>Blattella germanica</i>!

00:13:54.083 --> 00:13:55.501
You can say something nice!

00:13:55.543 --> 00:13:58.171
It's cruel to
insinuate you can't!

00:13:58.212 --> 00:13:59.922
When cajoling Yusa,

00:13:59.964 --> 00:14:02.008
don't expect the sheer joy
that you would witness

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:03.551
from Miss Sasaki.

00:14:03.593 --> 00:14:06.554
But at the least it should
beguile her emotions.

00:14:06.596 --> 00:14:07.764
Lay off me.

00:14:07.805 --> 00:14:10.183
And those impressions
were offensive.

00:14:10.224 --> 00:14:11.809
Whether we like it or not,

00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:14.520
Suzuno provides
for us nearly everyday!

00:14:14.562 --> 00:14:16.356
Thus, we should extol her.

00:14:16.397 --> 00:14:18.441
Her combat skills are nifty!

00:14:22.487 --> 00:14:23.279
[URUSHIHARA]
Hey.

00:14:23.321 --> 00:14:26.783
So, do you want me to
start complimenting you?

00:14:26.824 --> 00:14:28.868
Do you want me to kill you?

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:30.661
Kidding. Calm down.

00:14:30.703 --> 00:14:33.414
How dare you just sit
there and watch me work.

00:14:33.456 --> 00:14:36.125
Why'd I agree to do
this in the first place?

00:14:36.167 --> 00:14:38.127
I should kill you.

00:14:38.169 --> 00:14:41.130
While I have you,
I need to talk about something.

00:14:41.172 --> 00:14:43.549
[EMI] If it's a compliment,
death wish confirmed.

00:14:43.591 --> 00:14:48.221
Well, it's not.
So any thoughts on Olba?

00:14:48.262 --> 00:14:51.057
Random. What's up?

00:14:51.099 --> 00:14:53.059
[URUSHIHARA] Okay,
so we know Olba betrayed you

00:14:53.101 --> 00:14:54.602
and tried to get rid of you.

00:14:54.644 --> 00:14:57.647
After I KO'd him, he was
arrested for property damage

00:14:57.688 --> 00:14:59.524
and illegal possession
of a weapon.

00:14:59.565 --> 00:15:02.652
Guess the old
fart's in jail now.

00:15:02.693 --> 00:15:05.029
You asked me for
my thoughts, right?

00:15:05.071 --> 00:15:06.406
So, what do you want to know?

00:15:06.447 --> 00:15:08.366
[URUSHIHARA] There's not
some burning question.

00:15:08.408 --> 00:15:10.284
I just have a feeling
you're like me,

00:15:10.326 --> 00:15:11.452
and not optimistic
enough to believe

00:15:11.494 --> 00:15:13.663
he'll stay put for the police.

00:15:15.248 --> 00:15:17.959
Your guys beat me in Ente Isla.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.462
After that, I had two main
reasons to team up with him.

00:15:21.504 --> 00:15:25.341
The first is simple,
he told me he'd spare my life.

00:15:25.383 --> 00:15:28.719
No way your knights were
gonna let me go after I lost.

00:15:28.761 --> 00:15:31.389
No offense, but I deeply
regret not finishing you off

00:15:31.431 --> 00:15:33.015
when I had the chance.

00:15:33.057 --> 00:15:34.642
Reason number two
is that he told me

00:15:34.684 --> 00:15:37.103
he could put in a good word
for me with heaven.

00:15:37.145 --> 00:15:37.979
Huh?

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:39.897
The Devil's army was toast.

00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:42.900
I couldn't camp out there
with all those humans.

00:15:42.942 --> 00:15:44.902
In the moment, I believed
going back to Heaven

00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:46.737
was my only option.

00:15:48.197 --> 00:15:51.492
He told me he had resources
to negotiate with them.

00:15:51.534 --> 00:15:53.286
Bargaining chips.

00:15:53.953 --> 00:15:55.121
Like what?

00:15:55.163 --> 00:15:58.082
[URUSHIHARA] Well, if his plan
would've worked out, me.

00:15:58.124 --> 00:16:01.335
Convincing a fallen angel to
see the light scores big points.

00:16:01.377 --> 00:16:03.254
They might've skipped
the whole sainthood thing

00:16:03.296 --> 00:16:05.756
and promoted him
straight to being an angel.

00:16:05.798 --> 00:16:07.758
[EMI]
And his other chips?

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.760
[URUSHIHARA]
Well, you, for one.

00:16:09.802 --> 00:16:10.845
How's that?

00:16:10.887 --> 00:16:13.973
He wanted to keep you in
his deck as a trump card.

00:16:14.015 --> 00:16:16.767
With that, there's
something I wanna know.

00:16:16.809 --> 00:16:19.645
Who was in charge of developing
the evolving heavenly silver

00:16:19.687 --> 00:16:22.064
your sword and armor
are made out of?

00:16:22.106 --> 00:16:23.649
The Missionary Division.

00:16:23.691 --> 00:16:26.027
The same place
where Olba worked.

00:16:26.068 --> 00:16:27.445
Figured as much.

00:16:27.487 --> 00:16:30.156
I have a feeling
he knows what it is, then.

00:16:30.198 --> 00:16:33.618
He knows the heavenly silver
is a fragment of Yesod.

00:16:33.659 --> 00:16:34.452
What?

00:16:34.494 --> 00:16:36.621
That must've been
his bargaining chip.

00:16:36.662 --> 00:16:39.081
It's the only thing
the geezer had on 'em.

00:16:39.123 --> 00:16:41.292
What I don't get is why
Olba wanted to negotiate

00:16:41.334 --> 00:16:43.044
with Heaven so badly.

00:16:43.085 --> 00:16:44.962
Yeah, I don't get it either.

00:16:45.004 --> 00:16:46.631
But regardless,
it's safe to assume

00:16:46.672 --> 00:16:48.966
he has some
seriously powerful info.

00:16:49.008 --> 00:16:50.676
He's not going to
let that go to waste

00:16:50.718 --> 00:16:53.679
while he sits on his hands
and rots in prison.

00:16:55.223 --> 00:16:58.851
The worst part is,
if he goes on a rampage.

00:16:58.893 --> 00:17:03.147
I won't get to buy the GameStage
Portable MonCap edition.

00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:04.899
That's unforgiveable.

00:17:05.066 --> 00:17:07.026
[EMI]
There he is.

00:17:07.068 --> 00:17:08.236
Totally hopeless.

00:17:08.277 --> 00:17:10.279
You said that out loud, y'know.

00:17:10.321 --> 00:17:11.322
[EMI]
Oops!

00:17:11.364 --> 00:17:13.533
Well, that wraps up this chat.

00:17:13.574 --> 00:17:15.409
Sorry to bug you,
but even I take an interest

00:17:15.451 --> 00:17:18.204
when stuff like
last night goes down.

00:17:18.246 --> 00:17:20.039
[EMI]
What happened last night?

00:17:20.081 --> 00:17:22.083
Dude. You missed that?

00:17:30.424 --> 00:17:31.884
Good morning, li'l chickadee.

00:17:31.926 --> 00:17:33.636
Is your diaper still dry?

00:17:33.678 --> 00:17:37.139
[ALAS RAMUS]
Good morning! Yeah, it's dry.

00:17:37.181 --> 00:17:40.518
Surprise! Dada has
someone he'd like you to meet.

00:17:43.604 --> 00:17:44.939
[CHIHO]
Aww! How cute!

00:17:44.981 --> 00:17:47.567
Wow! Birdie says tweet, tweet!

00:17:47.608 --> 00:17:51.362
Don't grab him.
Mister Birdie looks fragile.

00:17:51.404 --> 00:17:54.574
Tweet. That smell. It's humans.

00:17:54.615 --> 00:17:55.741
Birdie says what?

00:17:55.783 --> 00:17:57.827
This guy's a demon
from my realm.

00:17:57.868 --> 00:17:59.996
What?

00:18:00.037 --> 00:18:02.290
[MAOU]
Meet Chancellor Camio.

00:18:02.331 --> 00:18:05.126
If you think of Alciel and
Lucifer as my manpower,

00:18:05.167 --> 00:18:08.754
Camio is more in charge of
the strategy side of things.

00:18:08.796 --> 00:18:09.839
He's real smart.

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:13.217
He knows all the languages and
customs of the demon tribes.

00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:14.051
On top of that,

00:18:14.093 --> 00:18:17.179
he's one of few demons
that's any good at negotiation.

00:18:17.221 --> 00:18:18.139
This little thing?

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:19.265
Birdie, hug!

00:18:19.307 --> 00:18:22.310
Hey, let's use gentle
touches only, cutie.

00:18:22.351 --> 00:18:25.229
[MAOU] In a realm where might
and brutality are everything,

00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:28.316
Camio managed to survive
through intelligence alone.

00:18:28.357 --> 00:18:30.610
He helped get tons
of allies on my side

00:18:30.651 --> 00:18:32.528
and grew our organization.

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:34.280
This little thing?

00:18:34.322 --> 00:18:36.782
[MAOU] Without Camio,
I don't think I could've formed

00:18:36.824 --> 00:18:38.409
the Devil's army.

00:18:39.243 --> 00:18:40.202
He blew up!

00:18:40.244 --> 00:18:41.746
Tweet!

00:18:45.625 --> 00:18:46.542
Birdie?

00:18:46.584 --> 00:18:49.045
I'm victorious, tweet!

00:18:49.086 --> 00:18:50.838
You listen to me, birdbrain.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.006
If you get the kid hurt,

00:18:52.048 --> 00:18:54.884
I will turducken you with
your own beak and giblets!

00:18:54.925 --> 00:18:55.885
[CAMIO]
Tweet!

00:18:55.926 --> 00:18:57.261
Be nice to our new friend,

00:18:57.303 --> 00:19:00.931
I don't think her tumble was
entirely Mister Camio's fault.

00:19:00.973 --> 00:19:01.766
[EMI]
Yeet!

00:19:01.807 --> 00:19:03.225
[ALAS RAMUS]
Hi, Birdie!

00:19:03.267 --> 00:19:05.019
How sweet. Okay, Alas Ramus.

00:19:05.061 --> 00:19:07.438
Tell him you're sorry
for chasing him.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:08.814
But why?

00:19:08.856 --> 00:19:11.859
I think you gave him
a pretty bad scare.

00:19:13.027 --> 00:19:14.570
I'm so sorry.

00:19:14.612 --> 00:19:17.573
Hah hah. Lucky for you,
I'm not the type to grow upset

00:19:17.615 --> 00:19:20.159
over the whims of a mere
baby, tweet, tweet.

00:19:20.201 --> 00:19:22.703
Heh. That's good, tweet, tweet!

00:19:22.745 --> 00:19:24.330
[EMI]
So, what'd we miss?

00:19:24.372 --> 00:19:26.165
If we include Camio,
does that mean there

00:19:26.207 --> 00:19:29.168
were three demons in
Kimigahama last night?

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:30.127
Yeah.

00:19:30.169 --> 00:19:32.672
But our inn is minutes
away from the beach!

00:19:32.713 --> 00:19:33.881
If there were demons nearby,

00:19:33.923 --> 00:19:36.342
I should've been
able to sense them.

00:19:36.384 --> 00:19:38.719
You said that they looked
beaten up, didn't you?

00:19:38.761 --> 00:19:40.971
Who do you think
could've done that?

00:19:41.013 --> 00:19:42.515
[MAOU]
Not sure, but there seemed to be

00:19:42.556 --> 00:19:44.558
a connection to that foghorn.

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.268
I wanna check out
the lighthouse.

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:48.521
[CHIHO]
The Inubosaki Lighthouse?

00:19:48.562 --> 00:19:51.524
You should've come with us
when we visited this morning.

00:19:51.565 --> 00:19:52.400
[MAOU]
You went?

00:19:52.441 --> 00:19:54.527
Satan? Pardon me, tweet.

00:19:54.568 --> 00:19:57.947
Right. I guess I haven't
introduced you guys yet.

00:19:57.988 --> 00:19:59.865
This is Chiho Sasaki.

00:19:59.907 --> 00:20:02.535
She knows about all
of our true identities.

00:20:02.576 --> 00:20:05.037
I'd trust this girl
with my life.

00:20:05.079 --> 00:20:07.957
[CAMIO] Any friend of
yours is a friend of mine.

00:20:07.998 --> 00:20:10.000
Human lass, I am filled
with great gratitude

00:20:10.042 --> 00:20:12.044
on behalf of my liege.

00:20:12.086 --> 00:20:16.382
Well, you know,
Mister Maou is--wait, no.

00:20:16.424 --> 00:20:19.343
King Satan is always
helping me out, too!

00:20:19.385 --> 00:20:21.178
Weird, but the baby and the lady

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:23.264
are the sacred sword
and the Hero!

00:20:23.305 --> 00:20:25.683
Shut up, that's
sensitive information!

00:20:25.725 --> 00:20:27.685
You're not as I imagined, tweet.

00:20:27.727 --> 00:20:29.353
Tur... ducken

00:20:29.395 --> 00:20:32.690
[MAOU]
Come on, Emi, he just got here.

00:20:32.732 --> 00:20:33.941
[CAMIO]
Tweet Satan?

00:20:33.983 --> 00:20:35.526
Not a great nickname.

00:20:35.568 --> 00:20:37.903
Are you positive it's
the best idea to consort

00:20:37.945 --> 00:20:40.322
with the Hero
and her sword, tweet?

00:20:40.364 --> 00:20:42.616
Of all people,
I thought you'd get it.

00:20:42.658 --> 00:20:45.494
Alciel started off as
our enemy, remember?

00:20:45.536 --> 00:20:46.704
Huh?

00:20:46.746 --> 00:20:48.664
Think way back to
when we first took control

00:20:48.706 --> 00:20:50.332
of the demon realm.

00:20:50.374 --> 00:20:52.918
When we ended up here,
it was my gut instinct

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:56.756
to try and replicate that
same process on this world.

00:20:56.797 --> 00:20:59.049
So, trust me, it wasn't
my plan working with her,

00:20:59.091 --> 00:21:01.260
but we manage okay.

00:21:03.262 --> 00:21:04.847
For all the time
I have known you,

00:21:04.889 --> 00:21:08.684
I have always appreciated
your frank nature, Sire, tweet.

00:21:08.726 --> 00:21:11.520
Enemies struggle to find an
emotional common ground,

00:21:11.562 --> 00:21:14.482
but through logic, any
partnership is possible.

00:21:14.523 --> 00:21:17.234
You're not biased against
humans or heroes.

00:21:17.276 --> 00:21:21.864
I'm glad we've got such a
thoughtful demon on our team.

00:21:21.906 --> 00:21:24.283
Now, fill me in. What's up?

00:21:24.325 --> 00:21:27.787
What brought you and those
other demons to Japan?

00:21:27.828 --> 00:21:30.706
And why were you all so
beat up when you got here?

00:21:30.748 --> 00:21:34.835
You mentioned chaos in our
realm, as well as in Ente Isla.

00:21:34.877 --> 00:21:37.880
Also,what the
heck is this thing?

00:21:37.922 --> 00:21:39.048
That is--

00:21:39.089 --> 00:21:40.883
[knocking on door]

00:21:40.925 --> 00:21:42.676
[AMANE]
Yo, Maou! Can I come in?

00:21:42.718 --> 00:21:44.178
Shhh!

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.599
Yeah, of course!

00:21:48.641 --> 00:21:50.476
Hey, everyone.
The rush is over,

00:21:50.518 --> 00:21:52.937
but we've got a crap ton
of cleaning up to do.

00:21:52.978 --> 00:21:54.855
[MAOU]
Sorry. We'll be right there.

00:21:54.897 --> 00:21:56.315
Sweet.

00:21:57.358 --> 00:22:00.653
Whew. You'll have to
tell me the story later.

00:22:00.694 --> 00:22:04.156
King Satan! That was her, tweet.

00:22:04.198 --> 00:22:06.951
I couldn't make the slightest
advance against her.

00:22:06.992 --> 00:22:09.662
She had the power of
a demon lord, tweet.

00:22:09.703 --> 00:22:10.996
What are you saying?

00:22:11.038 --> 00:22:13.040
[CAMIO] The one who
swallowed up my soldiers

00:22:13.082 --> 00:22:15.835
in that mighty dragon's roar...

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:21.590
[CAMIO]
...was her.
