[ALAS RAMUS cries loudly]

00:00:11.803 --> 00:00:13.430
Sometimes life is hard, kiddo!

00:00:13.472 --> 00:00:15.057
And sometimes people
you think are your parents

00:00:15.098 --> 00:00:16.600
aren't in the slightest!

00:00:16.642 --> 00:00:18.060
No! Not true!

00:00:18.101 --> 00:00:19.102
Dada is Satan!

00:00:19.144 --> 00:00:20.604
Come on, Emi,
you're her fake mom!

00:00:20.646 --> 00:00:21.772
What should we do?

00:00:21.813 --> 00:00:24.233
What? How the heck would I know?

00:00:24.274 --> 00:00:26.151
Mama!

00:00:26.193 --> 00:00:27.819
Uh...

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.785
So I'm not Fake Mom of the Year!

00:00:34.826 --> 00:00:36.912
She caught the sacred
sword barehanded.

00:00:36.954 --> 00:00:39.831
She looks like a normal baby,
but there's no way she is!

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:40.666
Understood.

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:43.794
But your theory isn't going to
do us any good at the moment.

00:00:43.835 --> 00:00:45.212
She expects you
to be her mother,

00:00:45.254 --> 00:00:47.130
so you should act as such.

00:00:47.172 --> 00:00:49.550
Gee, thanks, Bel, that must
be easy for you to say!

00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:51.343
I don't see the problem,
Miss Yusa!

00:00:51.385 --> 00:00:53.887
I'd trade places with you
in a heartbeat if I could!

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:55.055
I'm sure you would.

00:00:55.097 --> 00:00:57.808
No Maou-driven
ulterior motives, right?

00:01:00.602 --> 00:01:02.563
Okay, kid, this is
a lot right now.

00:01:02.604 --> 00:01:05.566
Say it with me,
"Emi's not Mama"!

00:01:08.193 --> 00:01:11.113
Waah... Mama!

00:01:11.154 --> 00:01:12.614
Oh, all right.

00:01:12.656 --> 00:01:14.992
I guess a hug wouldn't hurt.

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:50.962
If it weren't for
the apple thing,

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:53.924
I'd think she was
a totally normal baby.

00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:55.050
Pokey, pokey.

00:02:55.092 --> 00:02:56.343
Don't be a doofus!

00:02:56.385 --> 00:02:58.261
The kid is finally asleep.

00:02:58.303 --> 00:02:59.721
So, uh, one thing,

00:02:59.763 --> 00:03:02.140
why does she think
her Dada is Satan?

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:04.017
Maybe she's like a baby duck?

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:06.228
She could've imprinted on
the first two people she saw

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.438
after hatching out of the apple.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.773
Not what I meant.

00:03:09.815 --> 00:03:12.275
I think you could be right
about her imprinting on Maou,

00:03:12.317 --> 00:03:14.653
but how could she have
known that he was Satan?

00:03:14.695 --> 00:03:16.113
Well, that's pretty simple.

00:03:16.154 --> 00:03:19.282
I bet somebody must've called me
that within earshot of her.

00:03:19.324 --> 00:03:20.659
You realize in that scenario,

00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:23.370
that same somebody is who
disguised her as an apple, then

00:03:23.412 --> 00:03:25.831
found your address
and sent her there?

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:26.790
Yeah.

00:03:26.832 --> 00:03:30.252
Who is this "somebody"? Is she
this mysterious baby-mama?

00:03:30.293 --> 00:03:34.172
Okay, okay. Just focus on your
breathing, not my sex life.

00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:35.799
We don't know whether
the person who sent her

00:03:35.841 --> 00:03:37.217
is a friend or a foe.

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:39.761
Regardless, I'm sure
that they'll be back soon.

00:03:39.803 --> 00:03:42.681
Oh! Could this
be Sariel's doing?

00:03:42.723 --> 00:03:45.809
No. I highly doubt that
the archangel is involved.

00:03:45.851 --> 00:03:49.521
"Alas Ramus" would be rather
unheard of for a name in heaven.

00:03:49.563 --> 00:03:52.232
Those words are from a human
language in Ente Isla.

00:03:52.274 --> 00:03:55.235
"Alas" means "wing,"
and "Ramus" means "branch."

00:03:55.277 --> 00:03:57.612
We know one thing about
the parent who named her.

00:03:57.654 --> 00:04:00.198
I am certain they hail
from Ente Isla.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.118
That narrows it down, but we
still have no clue who they are.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.162
We need to stay with
the kid until they show up,

00:04:05.203 --> 00:04:07.164
then we can see
if they're on our side.

00:04:07.205 --> 00:04:08.749
Oh, goody, I can't wait.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.625
But that brings us to
the bigger problem

00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:13.003
of who's gonna take
care of the apple-baby?

00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:15.505
I'd like to help, but I live
alone and work days,

00:04:15.547 --> 00:04:17.549
so I couldn't be with her
as much as needed.

00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:19.092
It would be
exceptionally difficult

00:04:19.134 --> 00:04:21.219
to support a child
on our budget.

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:23.138
But I have greater
concerns than that.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.558
Demon kings and generals aren't
known for their parental skill.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.726
I'm sorry.

00:04:27.768 --> 00:04:29.436
I really want to help you guys.

00:04:29.478 --> 00:04:32.898
But I don't know how I'd get my
mom and dad to be cool with it.

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:34.983
[SUZUNO] I have no
qualms about taking her in.

00:04:35.025 --> 00:04:36.985
I cared for countless
children during my years

00:04:37.027 --> 00:04:39.279
working for the Church.

00:04:43.408 --> 00:04:45.786
Mister Maou?
You look disappointed.

00:04:45.827 --> 00:04:47.120
Oh, I'm not.

00:04:47.162 --> 00:04:50.999
It's just that something
doesn't feel right to me.

00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:52.542
I've decided.

00:04:52.584 --> 00:04:55.670
The Devil's Castle
will take in Alas Ramus!

00:04:57.547 --> 00:04:58.548
[KAORI]
You never said.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.217
How'd it go with
the boy from work?

00:05:00.258 --> 00:05:01.343
"Maou," right?

00:05:01.384 --> 00:05:02.886
Did you tell him you like him?

00:05:02.928 --> 00:05:03.887
Yeah.

00:05:03.929 --> 00:05:06.473
I'm still waiting on him
to give me an answer.

00:05:06.515 --> 00:05:09.768
Awww... Maybe you just
weren't aggressive enough.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.728
I don't think that's it.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.314
[MAOU] Chi is a valued
employee of MgRonalds.

00:05:14.356 --> 00:05:15.774
As her shift manager,

00:05:15.816 --> 00:05:19.194
and as devil, I protect
those under my charge!

00:05:19.236 --> 00:05:21.863
I'm kinda worried that he sees
me more as something to protect

00:05:21.905 --> 00:05:23.532
than as my own person.

00:05:23.573 --> 00:05:25.700
I can't quite figure out
how to change that.

00:05:25.742 --> 00:05:26.952
You're a smart girl!

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:29.120
But maybe you could
use a little help.

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:29.955
Okay!

00:05:29.996 --> 00:05:33.083
When practice is over, we should
hit MgR's and brainstorm!

00:05:33.124 --> 00:05:35.836
Uh! That's sweet,
but I'm busy today.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.559
Uh... Hello.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.310
Nice to see you.

00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:54.604
I'm sorry; is now a bad time?

00:05:54.646 --> 00:05:58.608
No. The gremlin has
finally worn herself out.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.569
[CHIHO]
Well, that's good, at least.

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.028
[ASHIYA] His Majesty
and I spent the night

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.697
trying to soothe her crying,

00:06:03.738 --> 00:06:06.199
however, all our efforts
were to no avail.

00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:08.201
There was only one
thing she wanted.

00:06:08.243 --> 00:06:10.745
"Where's Mama? Where's Mama?"

00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:12.622
What did you end up feeding her?

00:06:12.664 --> 00:06:15.458
She ate a bit of our udon
without complaining at all.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.753
It seems we can feed her human
food without any concern.

00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:20.338
That's great news.

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.798
I bought some stuff.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.008
There should be at least
one of everything

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:24.593
you could possibly need.

00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:26.261
These are all diapers.

00:06:26.303 --> 00:06:29.097
Try a few brands and
let me know which is best!

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:32.934
Oh, and these are antibacterial
wipes for when she makes a mess.

00:06:32.976 --> 00:06:34.853
I got some little toothbrushes,

00:06:34.895 --> 00:06:37.105
this tea for kids,
and a sippy cup.

00:06:37.147 --> 00:06:40.025
You go so far above and
beyond for us, Miss Sasaki.

00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:41.026
I can't find the words

00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:43.945
to express the great wealth
of gratitude I feel inside.

00:06:43.987 --> 00:06:44.821
Thank you.

00:06:44.863 --> 00:06:46.197
But it's no big deal.

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:48.867
[ASHIYA] Nonsense. Once King
Satan gains power in Japan

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:51.369
and forms his new Devil's Army,
if you're willing,

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:54.539
I'd like to place you
among its highest ranks!

00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:55.999
I'll pass on that one.

00:06:56.041 --> 00:06:57.792
Besides, Mister Maou
gave me enough money

00:06:57.834 --> 00:06:59.753
to buy all this stuff anyway.

00:06:59.794 --> 00:07:00.837
It's fine.

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:03.006
I actually had fun at the store.

00:07:03.048 --> 00:07:08.511
And someday, uh, I wanna shop
like this for my own baby.

00:07:08.553 --> 00:07:11.723
And I hope Mister Maou
will be there.

00:07:11.765 --> 00:07:12.766
What does that mean?

00:07:12.807 --> 00:07:13.767
You heard nothing!

00:07:13.808 --> 00:07:16.436
That should've stayed
locked away in my brain!

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:21.566
[SUZUNO] Here's the bento and
energy drink you requested.

00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:22.776
I won't thank you.

00:07:22.817 --> 00:07:24.319
Tell me.

00:07:24.361 --> 00:07:25.862
How much?

00:07:25.904 --> 00:07:27.989
I can't believe Mister Ashiya's
going to splurge

00:07:28.031 --> 00:07:30.367
on an Orion Bento meal!

00:07:30.408 --> 00:07:31.910
Wha--? We got food?

00:07:31.952 --> 00:07:35.246
Quiet! Be gone, you freeloader!

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:37.165
Grumpy pants.

00:07:37.207 --> 00:07:39.876
The crying last night
was quite otherworldly.

00:07:39.918 --> 00:07:41.670
Despite there being
a wall between us,

00:07:41.711 --> 00:07:44.130
it woke me from slumber
numerous times.

00:07:44.172 --> 00:07:45.256
[ALAS RAMUS]
Dada.

00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:46.758
--Huh?!
--Huh?!

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.094
Da... da?

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:51.262
I beg you, not again!

00:07:52.222 --> 00:07:53.181
[RIKA]
Hey, Emi.

00:07:53.223 --> 00:07:56.226
Something bad happen, or what?

00:07:56.267 --> 00:07:57.811
If you keep scowling
like that all day,

00:07:57.852 --> 00:07:59.646
you're gonna
get gnarly wrinkles.

00:07:59.688 --> 00:08:02.565
Let me guess, you got in a big
fight with Maou, didn't you?

00:08:02.607 --> 00:08:05.318
You seem weirdly
excited by that idea.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.278
It's different this time,

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.447
because I can't tell him
it's not my problem.

00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:11.616
There's this little
toddler involved.

00:08:11.658 --> 00:08:13.576
Hold up, do you have
a kid with that man?

00:08:13.618 --> 00:08:17.372
No, but the kid
sure seems to think so. Ah!

00:08:17.414 --> 00:08:19.207
Whoa. Well, that sounds juicy!

00:08:19.249 --> 00:08:21.209
She's not mine!
She would tell you she is,

00:08:21.251 --> 00:08:24.921
so, like, functionally
she is, but she's not!

00:08:24.963 --> 00:08:27.757
Huh? Thank you
very much for calling.

00:08:27.799 --> 00:08:31.052
This is Yusa from
Docodemo Customer Service.

00:08:31.094 --> 00:08:32.971
[CHIHO]
That should do it.

00:08:33.013 --> 00:08:34.389
You have impressive skill.

00:08:34.431 --> 00:08:35.306
[ASHIYA]
Truly.

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:37.767
It's clear I'm no match
for you, Miss Sasaki.

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:41.646
And to think, as a general
I prided myself on efficiency!

00:08:41.688 --> 00:08:45.150
I just have some experience
babysitting my cousin's kid.

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:47.902
Hey! Dirty diapers
are no fun, huh?

00:08:47.944 --> 00:08:51.698
Uh, your Dada and the lady you
call Mama will be back soon!

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:52.824
Can you wait?

00:08:52.866 --> 00:08:53.992
Uh-huh!

00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:56.870
Oh, by the way! I'm Chiho.

00:08:56.911 --> 00:08:58.204
Chi-oh?

00:08:58.246 --> 00:09:00.457
Chi-ho! Wait a sec!

00:09:00.498 --> 00:09:03.001
You can call me Chi
like your dad does!

00:09:03.043 --> 00:09:04.461
Hi, Chi!

00:09:04.502 --> 00:09:06.087
That won't do, Alas Ramus.

00:09:06.129 --> 00:09:09.090
Chiho is your elder, so you
should address her with respect.

00:09:09.132 --> 00:09:11.176
Do you understand respect?

00:09:11.217 --> 00:09:13.094
Uh. No.

00:09:13.136 --> 00:09:14.304
Let me see.

00:09:14.345 --> 00:09:16.848
Could you call her Miss Chiho?

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:22.353
Choo. Mi. Mi Chi. Hi, Chi-mi!

00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:23.980
I'm gonna explode!

00:09:24.022 --> 00:09:26.066
Hi, Chi-mi! Hi, Chi-mi!

00:09:26.107 --> 00:09:28.109
[CHIHO]
Aww!

00:09:28.151 --> 00:09:29.360
You see that lady?

00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:31.196
She's Miss Suzuno.

00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:33.323
Uh, Suzu-mi!

00:09:33.364 --> 00:09:36.242
All right. Well, that's fine.

00:09:36.284 --> 00:09:39.496
Suzu-mi isn't so bad. Perhaps.

00:09:39.537 --> 00:09:42.123
Call you Chi-mi! Her Suzu-mi!

00:09:42.165 --> 00:09:44.375
Aw! Who's a little genius?

00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:46.503
Stop. Stop saying
my name, child.

00:09:48.046 --> 00:09:49.214
[SUZUNO]
Don't look at me like that!

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:52.467
No fair. You're just too cute!

00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:54.677
You girls are so easy.

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:59.224
[RIKA]
So, she's a relative of Maou's?

00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:01.559
That certainly seems
to be the case.

00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:04.979
The real issue is, this kid
started calling me "Mama."

00:10:05.021 --> 00:10:06.940
That'd throw anybody for a loop.

00:10:06.981 --> 00:10:08.733
Latching onto you is one thing.

00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:11.361
But mistaking you
for her mom is another.

00:10:11.402 --> 00:10:14.531
I wouldn't interfere with her
emotions without a good reason.

00:10:14.572 --> 00:10:16.074
If you're not committed
for the long haul,

00:10:16.116 --> 00:10:18.535
I think you should
probably stay out of it.

00:10:18.576 --> 00:10:19.410
That's great.

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:21.704
But I kinda promised
to swing by after work.

00:10:21.746 --> 00:10:22.580
Okay, Mom!

00:10:22.622 --> 00:10:25.416
You're, like, mega-committed
to this rugrat, huh?

00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:28.837
Her real folks will come back,
so I don't feel sorry for her.

00:10:28.878 --> 00:10:30.130
But, she's super attached to me,

00:10:30.171 --> 00:10:33.800
and I want to make the time she
has with us as fun as it can be.

00:10:33.842 --> 00:10:36.553
In typical Emi fashion,
you're a total softie.

00:10:36.594 --> 00:10:38.471
This could get
really tricky, quick.

00:10:38.513 --> 00:10:40.140
Just don't fall in love
with the kid so much

00:10:40.181 --> 00:10:43.309
that you get all depressed
when she has to go back home.

00:10:43.351 --> 00:10:45.979
Mm. Yeah, I'll be careful.

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.689
[RIKA] Lightbulb!
I just thought of the best way

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:49.357
you two could make
some memories!

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:52.277
Tada! Amusement park tickets!

00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:54.154
Docodemo is one
of their investors.

00:10:54.195 --> 00:10:56.698
So, any employee can use these.

00:11:00.869 --> 00:11:03.788
Dada! We missed you!

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:07.041
Wha--? I don't know
what you were thinking

00:11:07.083 --> 00:11:09.669
when you brought her here,
but this is a bad prank!

00:11:09.711 --> 00:11:11.087
I'm so sorry.

00:11:11.129 --> 00:11:12.630
I thought if we
took her for a walk,

00:11:12.672 --> 00:11:15.216
a change of pace might
help her remember something.

00:11:15.258 --> 00:11:17.385
Plus, she was really
antsy to see you.

00:11:17.427 --> 00:11:18.928
Dada! Dada!

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:21.055
You need to reign
in that baby mouth!

00:11:21.097 --> 00:11:23.057
Whoa, is that Maa and Chi's kid?

00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:25.685
No way! If I find out
Maou did that to Chi,

00:11:25.727 --> 00:11:27.520
I'll make him wish
he was never born.

00:11:27.562 --> 00:11:29.063
Afraid you won't need to, bud.

00:11:29.105 --> 00:11:31.357
Miss Kisaki's got that covered.

00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:32.942
Hello, Maa.

00:11:32.984 --> 00:11:34.027
Oh, balls!

00:11:34.068 --> 00:11:35.612
Is the fry grease
making me hallucinate.

00:11:35.653 --> 00:11:38.573
or did the girl Chi's
holding call you Dada?

00:11:38.615 --> 00:11:41.075
Feel free to correct me
if I misheard her.

00:11:41.117 --> 00:11:42.785
Well, Maa?

00:11:42.827 --> 00:11:44.537
No, you heard right.

00:11:44.579 --> 00:11:47.665
I remember you, you're a
friend of Maou and Sasaki's.

00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:49.667
It's Miss Kamazuki, correct?

00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:51.002
I'd hate to burden you,

00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:53.713
but might I borrow
your friend for a moment?

00:11:53.755 --> 00:11:54.923
Yes, ma'am.

00:11:54.964 --> 00:11:56.799
Take all the time you need.

00:11:56.841 --> 00:11:58.176
[KISAKI]
Thank you so much.

00:11:58.218 --> 00:12:01.804
Hey, Maa. Escort
Miss Kamazuki to a seat.

00:12:01.846 --> 00:12:02.847
And you, Chi.

00:12:02.889 --> 00:12:04.933
Let me hold the baby for a sec.

00:12:06.684 --> 00:12:07.727
I'm sorry.

00:12:07.769 --> 00:12:10.188
It seems we should've put
more thought into this endeavor.

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:11.064
Nah.

00:12:11.105 --> 00:12:14.150
I appreciate you two trying
to help Alas Ramus out a little.

00:12:14.192 --> 00:12:16.236
Noble cause, if you ask me.

[SARUE moans]

00:12:18.529 --> 00:12:21.491
Please, no.
Has heaven forsaken its angel?

00:12:21.532 --> 00:12:22.659
Have you gone and repealed

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.453
for me your body's lust,
O fair Desdemona?

00:12:25.495 --> 00:12:27.789
Is this babe the fruit
of your adultery?

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:30.375
Sorry, Suz.
I gotta go... over there.

00:12:30.416 --> 00:12:31.167
Come back!

Crestia Bel. Is this a dream?

00:12:33.378 --> 00:12:34.963
Tell me it's a dream!

00:12:35.004 --> 00:12:37.465
Sadly, it's not. But I
understand you know nothing

00:12:37.507 --> 00:12:39.300
of the child's origins, then?

00:12:39.342 --> 00:12:40.218
No crap!

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.554
I wish that baby
was mine so bad!

00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:44.639
Think it through.

A high school girl
coming and going

from a man's house
with a child in her arms.

00:12:48.643 --> 00:12:50.603
I know every
situation is complex,

00:12:50.645 --> 00:12:52.689
but that's not a good look.

00:12:53.648 --> 00:12:57.151
But... Um... Mister Maou
and I didn't do anything.

00:12:57.193 --> 00:12:59.529
He just needs
extra help right now.

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:02.031
You still have a lot to learn
about how people work.

00:13:02.073 --> 00:13:02.949
That's okay.

00:13:02.991 --> 00:13:05.034
But our society is prone
to leap to conclusions

00:13:05.076 --> 00:13:07.537
and spread nasty rumors.

00:13:07.578 --> 00:13:10.248
The worst part of it all is
there's no way to stop it.

00:13:12.166 --> 00:13:14.627
You smell like my Dada!

00:13:14.669 --> 00:13:16.838
Is that so?
Well, I believe it.

00:13:16.879 --> 00:13:19.299
It must be all the burgers.

00:13:21.259 --> 00:13:22.468
I've said all that before.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:24.846
And each time a young
person snaps back with,

00:13:24.887 --> 00:13:27.932
"What does society know
about me or my situation?"

00:13:27.974 --> 00:13:30.560
Neither of you did that, which
puts you above the crowd.

00:13:30.601 --> 00:13:32.270
I don't know much
about that stuff.

00:13:32.312 --> 00:13:35.606
Certainly not enough to dismiss
all of the wisdom you gave us.

00:13:35.648 --> 00:13:39.861
Heh. Admitting that means you're
one step closer to adulthood.

00:13:39.902 --> 00:13:40.778
Well, Maa?

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.363
You should head
home for the day.

Huh? But why?

00:13:45.283 --> 00:13:47.744
You've got a kid here
calling you "Dada."

I think you should
prioritize this time

with your family over your
next MgRonald's paycheck.

Listen, Chi.

Okay, so I know everything
Miss Kisaki said was true.

00:14:01.215 --> 00:14:02.675
But I need you.

00:14:02.717 --> 00:14:05.136
Can I ask you to stick
with me for a little longer?

00:14:05.178 --> 00:14:07.764
Huh?

00:14:07.805 --> 00:14:09.974
Even though nobody's
fighting right now,

00:14:10.016 --> 00:14:13.061
Emi and Suzuno are technically
still my sworn enemies.

00:14:13.102 --> 00:14:14.354
That leaves you.

00:14:14.395 --> 00:14:16.314
If you asked me who's
the human in Japan

00:14:16.356 --> 00:14:18.441
that I feel the
safest relying on.

00:14:18.483 --> 00:14:21.152
Well, you're about it, Chi.

00:14:21.194 --> 00:14:23.571
Also, I realize it's
totally unfair of me

00:14:23.613 --> 00:14:24.447
to say all this stuff

00:14:24.489 --> 00:14:27.867
when I still haven't given you
the proper answer you deserve.

00:14:27.909 --> 00:14:29.660
And I'm sorry.

00:14:29.702 --> 00:14:31.496
But I need you to
keep helping me.

00:14:31.537 --> 00:14:33.039
For a while.

00:14:36.417 --> 00:14:38.211
Hey! Why are you crying?

00:14:38.252 --> 00:14:40.296
Oh, jeez, did I offend
you or something?

00:14:40.338 --> 00:14:42.298
Um. Oops, I'm sorry.

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:45.259
It's just, what you said
made me so happy.

00:14:45.301 --> 00:14:48.846
I'm really glad
I'm someone you can rely on.

00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:50.723
Uh. You're happy?

00:14:50.765 --> 00:14:53.267
So, what's with
the waterworks, then?

00:14:53.309 --> 00:14:54.811
Oh, well, uh,

00:14:54.852 --> 00:14:57.522
Sometimes people cry
when they're happy.

00:14:57.563 --> 00:14:59.315
It's a human thing.

00:14:59.357 --> 00:15:01.234
Yeah. It must be.

00:15:01.275 --> 00:15:03.319
I don't really get it.

00:15:03.361 --> 00:15:05.530
I understand you
can't answer me now.

00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:06.739
That's fine.

00:15:06.781 --> 00:15:10.118
No matter what you decide,
I'll be here waiting.

00:15:10.159 --> 00:15:11.869
So, uh...

What Chi-mi?

00:15:18.126 --> 00:15:19.210
Don't worry.

00:15:19.252 --> 00:15:21.045
I'll help you the best I can!

00:15:21.087 --> 00:15:22.422
Wow, thank you.

00:15:22.463 --> 00:15:23.673
I don't deserve it.

00:15:23.714 --> 00:15:25.174
But, still...

00:15:25.216 --> 00:15:26.634
Sure.

00:15:27.593 --> 00:15:28.928
Glad you're still here.

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:30.555
I just remembered something.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.894
Here. Some salesman
handed me these.

00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:41.607
I figured I'd give them to you
since I won't use them, but, uh,

00:15:41.649 --> 00:15:45.695
you two understood the
point of my speech, right?

00:15:45.736 --> 00:15:48.281
It seems we have
an abundance of tickets.

00:15:48.322 --> 00:15:51.367
I've heard Tokyo Big-Egg Town
is supposed to be super fun.

00:15:51.409 --> 00:15:53.369
It's the perfect way
to entertain a kid.

00:15:53.411 --> 00:15:55.830
Plus, I'd hate to
waste these, so let's go.

tickets here, same as me.

00:16:01.878 --> 00:16:03.796
Please, you had to
have seen this coming.

00:16:03.838 --> 00:16:05.298
Whaddya mean by "this"?

00:16:05.339 --> 00:16:06.632
Hey, Alas Ramus!

00:16:06.674 --> 00:16:09.594
We can go to the park, but is
it cool if Mama stays home?

00:16:09.635 --> 00:16:11.512
No! Mama comes!

00:16:11.554 --> 00:16:14.682
Then maybe it would be best if
you and Mama have a girls' day.

00:16:14.724 --> 00:16:16.309
I'll skip out on this one.

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:17.643
No!

00:16:17.685 --> 00:16:18.811
You heard the kid.

00:16:18.853 --> 00:16:21.272
If anybody else has
a better plan, I'm in.

00:16:21.314 --> 00:16:23.107
You just have to
convince Alas Ramus.

00:16:23.149 --> 00:16:25.568
I for one would love
to find a workaround.

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:26.903
Well, my liege.

00:16:26.944 --> 00:16:29.947
the obvious choice here seems
like an unnecessary risk.

00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:31.741
You and the hero.

00:16:31.782 --> 00:16:32.742
Miss Yusa?

00:16:32.783 --> 00:16:35.411
If you ask me,
you three should go together.

00:16:35.453 --> 00:16:37.580
[EMI]
Hmm? Wait, really?

00:16:37.622 --> 00:16:40.166
Of course! Try thinking
about it differently.

00:16:40.208 --> 00:16:42.460
You can keep an
eye on Mister Maou!

00:16:42.502 --> 00:16:44.295
Okay, but what about you?

00:16:44.337 --> 00:16:46.589
Please, this isn't
about me at all!

00:16:46.631 --> 00:16:47.465
The most important thing is,

00:16:47.507 --> 00:16:51.219
we make sure Alas Ramus
has the best time ever!

00:16:56.015 --> 00:16:59.393
[EMI groans]
I hate this.

00:16:59.435 --> 00:17:00.853
Pull yourself together Emilia,

00:17:00.895 --> 00:17:02.480
you're supposed
to be the freakin' hero,

00:17:02.522 --> 00:17:05.066
and besides, you're going
as the baby's substitute mom!

00:17:05.107 --> 00:17:09.028
Yeah, you're just the mom,
not the devils w-w-wi--

00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:10.696
I'm being ridiculous!

00:17:10.738 --> 00:17:13.574
Maybe I should swing
by the salon first.

00:17:15.493 --> 00:17:16.661
[phone rings]

00:17:16.702 --> 00:17:18.538
What?! What do you want?!

00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:19.789
[EMERADA]
Calm down!

00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:21.624
It's your pal, Emerada.

00:17:21.666 --> 00:17:23.501
Don't judge me! It's not a date,

00:17:23.543 --> 00:17:25.920
and I'm not looking forward
to it, do you hear?

00:17:25.962 --> 00:17:28.464
[EMERADA] I hear you,
but what are you talking about?

00:17:28.506 --> 00:17:30.132
Oh, nothing, never mind then.

00:17:30.174 --> 00:17:32.009
Everything's going great here!

00:17:32.051 --> 00:17:34.095
I'm most definitely
doing my job.

00:17:34.136 --> 00:17:36.597
My hero-ly duties are
never far from my mind!

00:17:36.639 --> 00:17:38.224
[EMERADA] Good.
Oh, and that angel who was

00:17:38.266 --> 00:17:40.768
after the sacred sword
is still there, right?

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:43.437
[EMI] Yeah, but Sariel's
not exactly the threat

00:17:43.479 --> 00:17:44.814
he used to be.

00:17:44.855 --> 00:17:47.316
I'm still not sure why he came
after the sword, though.

00:17:47.358 --> 00:17:48.526
While I've gotcha,

00:17:48.568 --> 00:17:51.028
It might be nothing,
but we have a new visitor.

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:53.656
A little girl who hatched
out of an apple?

00:17:53.698 --> 00:17:56.701
I've never heard of
anything quite like that.

00:17:56.742 --> 00:17:58.494
I can't think of a being,
human or demon,

00:17:58.536 --> 00:18:01.289
capable of such a
unique transformation.

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:03.874
I figured. Yeah, same.

00:18:03.916 --> 00:18:04.875
Well, I'll dig around a bit

00:18:04.917 --> 00:18:09.422
and see what I can find
on the little apple-baby.

00:18:09.463 --> 00:18:11.966
Jeez. I'm going.
I'll hit the salon,

00:18:12.008 --> 00:18:15.052
and that clown won't
see me looking tired!

00:18:15.094 --> 00:18:16.971
[ASHIYA]
It's too dangerous, Sire!

00:18:17.013 --> 00:18:18.889
I beg you reconsider!

00:18:18.931 --> 00:18:20.766
Chill out, will ya?
If you ask me,

00:18:20.808 --> 00:18:23.853
Emi's way out of her
trying-to-kill-me-in-public era.

00:18:23.894 --> 00:18:25.605
Even if Emilia is no danger,

00:18:25.646 --> 00:18:28.816
what if some third-party butts
in and targets Alas Ramus?

00:18:28.858 --> 00:18:30.484
She's not safer
holed up in here,

00:18:30.526 --> 00:18:32.194
and besides,
she needs fresh air.

00:18:32.236 --> 00:18:35.323
Or would you rather the poor
kid end up like Urushihara?

00:18:35.364 --> 00:18:36.866
She's far surpassed him!

00:18:36.907 --> 00:18:39.076
She makes a conscious effort
to always bring me her dishes

00:18:39.118 --> 00:18:40.661
when she's through eating.

00:18:40.703 --> 00:18:43.122
She's quite polite and
showers me with thank yous!

00:18:43.164 --> 00:18:44.540
Urushihara's that worthless?

00:18:44.582 --> 00:18:45.916
Precisely, Sire!

00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:46.917
Lay off!

00:18:46.959 --> 00:18:48.669
If you're concerned
about their well-being,

00:18:48.711 --> 00:18:51.297
why don't you tail them
from a discrete distance?

00:18:51.339 --> 00:18:53.591
We have plenty of
extra tickets to spare.

00:18:53.633 --> 00:18:55.009
What about the castle?

00:18:55.051 --> 00:18:56.594
Knock yourself out playing spy,

00:18:56.636 --> 00:18:58.596
I'll do the dirty work of
defending our home.

00:18:58.638 --> 00:18:59.972
Dirty work, you say?

00:19:00.014 --> 00:19:02.600
Don't pretend you haven't been
waiting for a moment alone!

00:19:02.642 --> 00:19:05.519
Now you can use Jungle Prime's
same-day delivery feature!

00:19:05.561 --> 00:19:07.813
You should go
if you're able, Alciel.

00:19:07.855 --> 00:19:10.316
I'll watch over Lucifer
and his purchases.

00:19:10.358 --> 00:19:12.151
Well, that's fine
with me if you insist,

00:19:12.193 --> 00:19:15.154
but I don't think worrying about
what might happen will help.

00:19:15.196 --> 00:19:18.240
For me, I'm only gonna worry
about what's going on right now,

00:19:18.282 --> 00:19:20.660
and the situation we've
gotten ourselves into.

00:19:20.701 --> 00:19:23.079
[SUZUNO]
Hmm? What do you mean by that?

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.664
Isn't it obvious?

00:19:24.705 --> 00:19:25.915
If the tot sticks around,

00:19:25.956 --> 00:19:28.501
I'm gonna have trouble
feeding the household.

00:19:28.542 --> 00:19:29.919
I'll just have to work harder.

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:31.295
I can handle that.

00:19:32.713 --> 00:19:36.050
[ASHIYA] Sire, might I inquire
about one small thing?

00:19:36.092 --> 00:19:39.679
Why did you decide to take in
Alas Ramus in the first place?

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.764
[MAOU] I made the decision,
but you, Chi, and Suzuno

00:19:41.806 --> 00:19:43.724
are the ones caring for her.

00:19:43.766 --> 00:19:45.810
Sorry about that.

00:19:45.851 --> 00:19:48.312
I just figured if something bad
does end up happening,

00:19:48.354 --> 00:19:52.233
it's probably best if I can take
all the responsibility for it.

00:19:52.274 --> 00:19:54.694
I don't have proof that
something bad will happen,

00:19:54.735 --> 00:19:56.529
and it's not like she's my kid,

00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:59.490
but I can't help
being concerned.

00:20:10.126 --> 00:20:12.670
Nothing looks suspicious.

00:20:12.712 --> 00:20:13.879
The most suspicious thing here

00:20:13.921 --> 00:20:15.923
is you wearing
sunglasses inside.

00:20:15.965 --> 00:20:16.924
Miss Sasaki!

00:20:16.966 --> 00:20:18.426
How did you find me?

00:20:18.467 --> 00:20:20.761
That's easy,
Miss Suzuno tipped me off!

00:20:20.803 --> 00:20:23.389
Also, more importantly,
if something happens,

00:20:23.431 --> 00:20:26.225
you'll be in a way bigger pile
of trouble than Mister Maou.

00:20:26.267 --> 00:20:28.102
What? And why might that be?

00:20:28.144 --> 00:20:30.604
You don't have a
cell phone, Mister Ashiya.

00:20:30.646 --> 00:20:32.648
How were you gonna
call for reinforcements?

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:35.401
I was hoping I would be
able to locate a pay phone.

00:20:35.443 --> 00:20:37.486
Not the greatest strategy
if you ask me.

00:20:37.528 --> 00:20:40.281
You can borrow mine in case
there's an emergency.

00:20:40.322 --> 00:20:44.034
Also, ditch the glasses,
they make you look extra creepy.

00:20:44.076 --> 00:20:46.662
Come on, the lady
said I look cool.

00:20:46.704 --> 00:20:48.622
I'm happy they get to
have this time together,

00:20:48.664 --> 00:20:51.542
but it makes me feel weird.

00:20:53.878 --> 00:20:55.880
What? You see something dubious?

00:20:55.921 --> 00:20:59.133
Oh, my goodness.
Miss Yusa went big, huh?

00:20:59.175 --> 00:21:02.052
What now?! You're telling
me that's Emilia?!

00:21:02.094 --> 00:21:04.346
How would one even begin
to fight in that getup?

00:21:04.388 --> 00:21:06.682
Has she that forgotten
she's the hero?

00:21:06.724 --> 00:21:09.268
[chuckles]
So, what do you two think?

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:11.604
Are you fans of
Emi's fancy outfit?

00:21:11.645 --> 00:21:13.898
Huh? You're Miss Yusa's
friend from work!

00:21:13.939 --> 00:21:15.107
Oh, Miss Suzuki!

00:21:15.149 --> 00:21:16.525
What are you doing here?

00:21:16.567 --> 00:21:18.027
I just followed her from work.

00:21:18.068 --> 00:21:20.070
Should you be at
your job right now?

00:21:20.112 --> 00:21:22.698
Thankfully, Emi and I
both had morning shifts.

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:25.367
I'm glad I came.
This is a sight to see!

00:21:25.409 --> 00:21:28.788
She's never come to work
all dolled up like this before!

00:21:28.829 --> 00:21:31.165
I knew today must be the day.

00:21:31.207 --> 00:21:32.208
Ahhh...!

00:21:32.249 --> 00:21:35.169
Unfortunately, the try-hard
route can backfire.

00:21:35.211 --> 00:21:36.754
Your boy Maou came as he was,

00:21:36.796 --> 00:21:39.173
making him the clear
victor of this round.

00:21:39.215 --> 00:21:40.382
That's juicy stuff.

00:21:40.424 --> 00:21:41.550
So, what comes next?

00:21:41.592 --> 00:21:43.135
Whatcha gonna do?

00:21:44.345 --> 00:21:45.805
[GABRIEL]
Thank goodness.

00:21:45.846 --> 00:21:48.140
Our search didn't
take long at all.

00:21:57.525 --> 00:21:58.943
Let us hurry.

00:21:58.984 --> 00:22:00.611
It's up to us to restore
the Tree of Life

00:22:00.653 --> 00:22:02.530
back to its proper form.

00:22:07.993 --> 00:22:09.495
[URUSHIHARA]
A little teriyaki chicken,

00:22:09.537 --> 00:22:12.206
melty mozzarella
half and half magic.

00:22:12.248 --> 00:22:14.291
Plus, some fried chicken
to wash it down.

00:22:14.333 --> 00:22:15.084
Place order.

00:22:15.125 --> 00:22:17.670
--[whirring sound]
--Hmm?

00:22:18.963 --> 00:22:19.839
Weird.

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:22.132
That felt like a massive
Gate opening up.
