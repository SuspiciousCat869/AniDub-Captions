[blow]

00:00:08.893 --> 00:00:11.272
[EMI] Sorry to bug ya.
Can I come in?

00:00:12.483 --> 00:00:13.903
Hi, Miss Suzumi!

00:00:13.986 --> 00:00:15.657
What a pleasant surprise.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.702
Were you over
at the Devil's Castle?

00:00:17.786 --> 00:00:21.042
[EMI] Yeah. Hey, can I leave her
with you for a sec?

00:00:21.544 --> 00:00:23.171
[SUZUNO]
Is something the matter?

00:00:24.006 --> 00:00:25.593
Oh, no, it's nothing.

[EMI]
Denied!

00:00:31.522 --> 00:00:33.024
It's just one measly night,

00:00:33.108 --> 00:00:34.318
why won't
you let her sleep over?

00:00:34.402 --> 00:00:36.699
'Cause I have a working brain
between my ears!

00:00:36.782 --> 00:00:38.786
To think you
call yourself her mother!

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:40.289
Ignoring the child's wish

00:00:40.372 --> 00:00:42.418
to be with her father
is cruel and barbaric.

00:00:42.502 --> 00:00:43.420
Hero you say?

00:00:43.504 --> 00:00:46.009
Nay! You are the villain
of your "daughter's" tale!

00:00:46.092 --> 00:00:48.388
Where do you get off
calling anybody barbaric?

00:00:48.723 --> 00:00:50.309
You don't even have futons!

00:00:50.392 --> 00:00:51.770
You gonna kiss the baby
night-night

00:00:51.854 --> 00:00:53.148
and tuck her
into the floorboards?

00:00:53.231 --> 00:00:55.110
[annoyed]

00:00:55.193 --> 00:00:57.824
If you want me to consider
letting her sleep over here,

00:00:57.907 --> 00:00:58.826
buy her a futon.

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:00.037
[collapse]

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.834
You nimrods miraculously
have plenty of space.

00:01:02.917 --> 00:01:03.836
To my chagrin,

00:01:03.919 --> 00:01:07.092
that closet's been sacrificed
as Urushihara storage.

00:01:07.176 --> 00:01:09.347
[URUSHIHARA]
Way to objectify the hot one.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:10.850
Keep him on the top shelf.

00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:12.687
If you organize
the bottom a little,

00:01:12.771 --> 00:01:14.398
you can fit a futon down there.

00:01:14.482 --> 00:01:15.985
Why is everybody treating me

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:17.572
like I'm some lame gift
you hate,

00:01:17.656 --> 00:01:19.367
but feel too guilty
to get rid of?

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.037
[sigh]

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.501
We buy for life around here.

00:01:23.584 --> 00:01:26.130
Every purchase we've made
has been super practical.

00:01:26.548 --> 00:01:29.178
When we leave for Ente Isla,
we'll take our stuff with us.

00:01:29.261 --> 00:01:30.681
Even the appliances.

00:01:30.765 --> 00:01:34.271
I figure we can make the fridge
and microwave magic-powered.

00:01:34.355 --> 00:01:36.317
I get it, that's my plan, too.

00:01:36.401 --> 00:01:38.739
But wouldn't futons be
a good addition?

00:01:38.823 --> 00:01:41.787
Nah. They wouldn't do us
much good back home.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:42.789
Think about it.

00:01:42.872 --> 00:01:44.417
Demons are huge.

00:01:44.501 --> 00:01:47.089
What would we do
with a human-sized futon?

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:48.801
[pensive]

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:53.184
-[laugh]
-[ASHIYA] Silence!

00:01:53.268 --> 00:01:54.938
It's just not worth it for us,

00:01:55.021 --> 00:01:58.319
and to keep things real,
we don't have the money anyway.

00:01:58.403 --> 00:02:01.200
[EMI] You guys have been living
in Japan for a year now.

00:02:01.284 --> 00:02:02.829
What'd you do in the winter?

00:02:04.123 --> 00:02:06.670
[MAOU] Put on all our clothes
and slept under the kotatsu.

00:02:06.753 --> 00:02:07.797
[question]

00:02:07.881 --> 00:02:09.843
I might not need
to take you down.

00:02:09.926 --> 00:02:11.262
Sounds like
there's a decent chance

00:02:11.345 --> 00:02:12.724
-that you'll do it yourself.
-[uneasy]

00:02:13.391 --> 00:02:17.024
Before I say this, just know
your backs don't matter to me.

00:02:17.107 --> 00:02:19.821
But the kiddo needs
a comfortable place to sleep.

00:02:19.905 --> 00:02:20.990
So, here's my offer.

00:02:21.073 --> 00:02:24.956
I'll pay for half the futon,
but I get to help pick it out.

00:02:26.502 --> 00:02:27.419
Really?

00:04:02.568 --> 00:04:04.279
[EMI]
Ugh. Why'd I make a big deal

00:04:04.363 --> 00:04:05.991
about helping pick it out?

00:04:06.075 --> 00:04:07.244
[RIKA]
Is something wrong?

00:04:07.327 --> 00:04:09.874
Eh, not anything too terrible.

00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.379
But do you happen to know
where they sell kid's futons?

00:04:12.462 --> 00:04:14.843
[question]
Why are you in the market?

00:04:14.926 --> 00:04:18.266
[EMI] Oh. Well, uh,
remember that relative of Maou's

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:19.602
I was telling you about?

00:04:19.686 --> 00:04:20.730
That poor baby girl

00:04:20.813 --> 00:04:22.650
who was convinced
that you were her mama?

00:04:22.984 --> 00:04:23.902
Yeah, her.

00:04:23.986 --> 00:04:26.407
She's been coming over
to visit me a lot lately.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.286
And sometimes
she spends the night.

00:04:28.369 --> 00:04:29.496
[RIKA]
Hold the phone.

00:04:29.581 --> 00:04:31.543
Is Maou guilt-tripping you
into babysitting a kid

00:04:31.626 --> 00:04:33.714
that's supposed to be
his responsibility?

00:04:33.797 --> 00:04:35.676
[EMI]
No. That's not really it.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.887
Then what is it?

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.642
Because if he's pulling anything
funny over on my girl,

00:04:39.726 --> 00:04:40.895
I'll tear him a new one.

00:04:40.978 --> 00:04:43.817
Let me hook you up with a lawyer
through my parents' business.

00:04:43.901 --> 00:04:45.613
Take a breath, Rika.

00:04:45.696 --> 00:04:48.326
I swear that Maou's not
an evil child neglector.

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:50.956
She, well, she misses her mom.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.461
And regardless
of how I feel about Maou,

00:04:53.545 --> 00:04:54.798
I'm having a really great time

00:04:54.881 --> 00:04:56.676
hanging out
with this sweet girl.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.179
I'm only letting her stay
with me

00:04:58.262 --> 00:04:59.808
when she needs
some feminine energy,

00:04:59.891 --> 00:05:01.060
you know what I mean?

00:05:01.143 --> 00:05:02.563
Yeah, sure.

00:05:02.647 --> 00:05:04.274
Still sounds
pretty weird to me, though.

00:05:04.358 --> 00:05:05.318
Yeah, well,

00:05:05.401 --> 00:05:07.657
I spent a couple of minutes
looking for futons online.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.034
But since it's for a little one,

00:05:09.117 --> 00:05:11.581
I wanted to feel
how soft they are for myself.

00:05:11.998 --> 00:05:15.213
Oh! Yeah,
I think I know just the place.

00:05:16.215 --> 00:05:18.595
[MAOU] I appreciate her
paying for half.

00:05:18.679 --> 00:05:21.308
But where do you
even find a futon that small?

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.605
[CHIHO]
You look so deep in thought.

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:25.358
-Something wrong?
-Nah.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.697
[MAOU]
I don't wanna ask Chi,

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.368
but nobody at home
will have a damn clue.

00:05:30.451 --> 00:05:33.499
[KAWA-CCHI]
Yo! Hey, Maa! Hey, Chi!

00:05:33.584 --> 00:05:35.086
I brought you back
some souvenirs

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:36.172
from my big vacay!

00:05:36.255 --> 00:05:38.426
How nice. You shouldn't have.

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:41.098
-And here's yours.
-Aw, thank you very much!

00:05:42.935 --> 00:05:44.229
[MAOU]
Croco-do-what?

00:05:44.313 --> 00:05:46.526
It's all the rage
where we were staying!

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:48.487
Were you guys in the Amazon?

00:05:48.572 --> 00:05:50.450
Do they even have
crocs down there?

00:05:50.534 --> 00:05:52.955
[chuckle]
I don't know, do they?

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:54.124
[notice]

00:05:57.047 --> 00:05:59.092
[ASHIYA]
Seiseki Sakuragaoka, is it?

00:05:59.176 --> 00:06:01.932
Yeah.
She says that it's massive.

00:06:02.015 --> 00:06:04.102
Lots of stores
means lots of futons.

00:06:04.604 --> 00:06:05.898
Should be easy.

00:06:05.981 --> 00:06:08.486
We're gonna go knock it out
the day after tomorrow.

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.743
Good idea. Looks like tons
of big shopping centers

00:06:11.826 --> 00:06:13.371
are connected
to the train station.

00:06:13.454 --> 00:06:15.041
That comes as a relief.

00:06:15.124 --> 00:06:17.462
Last night's disasters
have been resolved.

00:06:17.546 --> 00:06:19.968
I'm sorry
you got dragged into it.

00:06:20.051 --> 00:06:21.721
[notice] What's that?

00:06:22.305 --> 00:06:25.186
[MAOU] This?
It's a present from my coworker.

00:06:25.896 --> 00:06:27.692
Apparently
there's crocodile meat in it?

00:06:27.775 --> 00:06:30.781
-Crocodile? Curious.
-[surprised]

00:06:30.864 --> 00:06:32.868
I wonder how it will taste.

00:06:32.952 --> 00:06:35.916
Hey, if you really wanna
know so badly, it's yours.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.962
-You're certain?
-Yeah.

00:06:38.547 --> 00:06:40.049
It's only one serving,

00:06:40.133 --> 00:06:42.304
so it's not enough
to split three ways.

00:06:43.014 --> 00:06:45.268
Just give us your review
once you've tried it.

00:06:45.351 --> 00:06:48.399
My lord! But our food reserves
are precious!

00:06:48.482 --> 00:06:49.736
[MAOU]
It's no biggie.

00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:52.616
Besides, we're gonna owe her
after we get this futon.

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:53.660
[question]

00:06:53.744 --> 00:06:56.040
You remember how this works.

00:06:56.123 --> 00:06:58.628
Now that Alas Ramus
is fused with the sword,

00:06:58.712 --> 00:07:01.551
she has to stay within
a pretty tight radius of Emi.

00:07:01.634 --> 00:07:02.928
Oh, that's right.

00:07:03.012 --> 00:07:05.934
It's approximately the distance
between two train stations,

00:07:06.018 --> 00:07:07.312
-correct?
-[MAOU] Yep.

00:07:07.772 --> 00:07:10.401
Which means if little buddy
stays here with us,

00:07:10.485 --> 00:07:13.533
Emi can't go back
to her place in Eifukucho.

00:07:13.617 --> 00:07:16.205
Will Alciel and Lucifer
sleep in my room?

00:07:16.288 --> 00:07:18.125
Like they did
when Emilia stayed here

00:07:18.209 --> 00:07:20.004
during our little tiff
with Gabriel?

00:07:20.088 --> 00:07:21.173
Huh?

00:07:21.256 --> 00:07:23.678
Am I not allowed
to stay in my closet?

00:07:23.762 --> 00:07:26.100
You just volunteered
to store yourself.

00:07:27.645 --> 00:07:28.772
I don't know how,

00:07:28.855 --> 00:07:30.399
but we're bound
to inconvenience you

00:07:30.483 --> 00:07:31.569
at some point.

00:07:31.653 --> 00:07:33.740
So, yeah, take the curry.

00:07:33.824 --> 00:07:36.663
I'm sure it'll be a nice break
from the usual udon.

00:07:37.372 --> 00:07:39.209
[observe]

00:07:42.508 --> 00:07:44.846
Truth is, it'll pair well.

00:07:49.564 --> 00:07:50.398
[gulp]

00:07:51.526 --> 00:07:54.406
At long last.
Let the feast commence.

00:07:57.663 --> 00:07:59.834
[amazed]

00:07:59.917 --> 00:08:03.090
It's a big day.
You gonna be a good girl?

00:08:03.174 --> 00:08:04.301
Yeah!

00:08:04.384 --> 00:08:05.846
-[giggle]
-Taking notes, bucko?

00:08:05.929 --> 00:08:07.725
I'm supposed
to grab stuff for Ashiya

00:08:07.808 --> 00:08:08.935
if I find it cheap.

00:08:09.687 --> 00:08:12.943
So, one bag
of onions, shirodashi, natto,

00:08:13.027 --> 00:08:15.323
and a refill
for the hand soap dispensers.

00:08:15.782 --> 00:08:17.118
Is a minor discount really worth

00:08:17.202 --> 00:08:19.331
carting all this stuff back
on the train?

00:08:19.414 --> 00:08:20.374
Probably not.

00:08:22.796 --> 00:08:24.550
Dada! MgRonald's!

00:08:24.634 --> 00:08:26.596
Yeah, thar she blows.

00:08:26.679 --> 00:08:28.892
She won't stop begging me
to eat there lately.

00:08:28.975 --> 00:08:30.478
I told her
we should probably wait

00:08:30.562 --> 00:08:31.648
until she's a bit older.

Let's get you cleaned up.

00:16:20.751 --> 00:16:22.379
-Fry?
-[happy]

00:16:23.716 --> 00:16:25.720
[bite &amp; happy chew]

00:16:26.387 --> 00:16:28.099
-[MAOU] Here. For you.
-[notice]

00:16:32.441 --> 00:16:35.197
[drink &amp; realize]

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:36.240
It's good.

00:16:36.324 --> 00:16:39.748
I know! They sell it
at the ol' hundred-yen shop.

00:16:39.831 --> 00:16:41.250
[chewing]

00:16:41.334 --> 00:16:43.254
[relief] Have some tea.

00:16:43.338 --> 00:16:45.050
Fries can make me thirsty.

00:16:45.133 --> 00:16:46.469
-How about you?
-[turn]

00:16:46.553 --> 00:16:48.641
[gulp &amp; refreshed "ahhh"]

00:16:48.724 --> 00:16:49.684
Yeah!

00:16:51.437 --> 00:16:54.109
You two really look like
father and daughter right now.

00:16:54.653 --> 00:16:56.949
Hope I start
to get used to it soon.

00:16:58.284 --> 00:16:59.621
Yeah, like you.

00:16:59.704 --> 00:17:02.292
You've seemed pretty at home
in mom mode lately.

00:17:02.376 --> 00:17:05.131
[question]
Uh, well, I suppose I am.

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:08.137
[MAOU] I wonder
how long we're gonna be able

00:17:08.221 --> 00:17:09.724
to be with her like this.

00:17:10.183 --> 00:17:11.435
Hopefully a while.

00:17:12.187 --> 00:17:13.481
Hopefully.

00:17:13.565 --> 00:17:15.193
Mama! You got da rice?

00:17:15.277 --> 00:17:17.364
[question] Right, I do.

00:17:17.447 --> 00:17:18.491
Here.

00:17:20.245 --> 00:17:21.414
-[bite &amp; happy chewing]
-Wow.

00:17:21.497 --> 00:17:23.001
Going straight
for the pickled radish

00:17:23.084 --> 00:17:24.504
is a real grown-up move.

00:17:25.005 --> 00:17:26.800
[drink]

00:17:26.883 --> 00:17:29.054
[relief] You know,

00:17:29.138 --> 00:17:31.893
there's no point in thinking
about any of that right now.

00:17:33.062 --> 00:17:34.858
Since you're not gonna use
the sacred sword

00:17:34.941 --> 00:17:38.532
to kill me anytime soon,
we can focus on the present.

00:17:39.199 --> 00:17:40.703
Hey, speak for yourself!

00:17:40.786 --> 00:17:41.705
I don't know why you think

00:17:41.788 --> 00:17:44.043
I've given up on my goal
of smiting you.

00:17:44.126 --> 00:17:45.713
No need to get defensive.

00:17:45.796 --> 00:17:47.508
I'm not gonna pull
something evil

00:17:47.592 --> 00:17:49.345
while your guard is down, 'kay?

00:17:49.428 --> 00:17:51.892
-Whoa! You lost some bonito!
-[question]

00:17:51.975 --> 00:17:54.146
Hey, help me out.
Got chopsticks?

00:17:54.856 --> 00:17:57.277
-I'll get a new wet wipe.
-[pensive] I'll clean the spill.

00:17:57.361 --> 00:17:59.156
You were hungry, weren't you?

00:18:00.116 --> 00:18:02.705
[sigh]
Well. This is humbling, huh?

00:18:02.789 --> 00:18:05.460
"Devil" and "Hero"
don't matter on mess duty.

00:18:20.031 --> 00:18:21.576
What a pretty day.

00:18:26.419 --> 00:18:28.464
[ASHIYA] We're running
out of precious time.

00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:30.135
Should we stay
at the internet cafe

00:18:30.218 --> 00:18:31.847
by the station? No.

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:33.851
The overnight packages
for the two of us

00:18:33.934 --> 00:18:35.980
would be one-thousand
nine-hundred and eighty yen,

00:18:36.063 --> 00:18:37.357
doubled!

00:18:37.441 --> 00:18:40.196
That would put an immense strain
on this month's finances.

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:42.075
Should we sleep
outside in the park?

00:18:42.159 --> 00:18:43.746
As if that would ever work!

00:18:43.829 --> 00:18:46.292
Though I could get away with it,
one look at you,

00:18:46.375 --> 00:18:47.795
and we would be reported
to the police

00:18:47.879 --> 00:18:49.214
as suspicious persons!

00:18:49.674 --> 00:18:52.763
But, wait! There's one
from whom I can seek counsel.

00:18:56.187 --> 00:18:57.857
[snoring]

00:19:02.115 --> 00:19:03.619
-[bump &amp; sleeping]
-[annoyed]

00:19:05.455 --> 00:19:08.629
[yawn]

00:19:08.712 --> 00:19:10.966
How dare you, Maou?
Have you no shame?

00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:12.010
-[angry]
-[question] Oh, boy.

00:19:12.093 --> 00:19:13.262
What'd I do?

00:19:13.346 --> 00:19:15.266
You took a nap
on my nonconsenting shoulder

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:16.770
-for the entire ride home!
-[startled]

00:19:16.853 --> 00:19:18.524
[yikes] I really did that?

00:19:18.607 --> 00:19:20.401
[EMI]
Don't play dumb with me!

00:19:20.485 --> 00:19:22.322
An old lady got on
and cooed at us.

00:19:22.405 --> 00:19:24.994
"Aw, what a sweet couple,
have fun lovebirds!"

00:19:25.078 --> 00:19:26.915
You owe me big time
for that humiliation,

00:19:26.998 --> 00:19:28.042
you jerkface!

00:19:28.125 --> 00:19:30.589
Is this real, or a mirage?

00:19:30.673 --> 00:19:32.384
Oh, uh. Hey, Chi.

00:19:32.467 --> 00:19:35.390
What a coinky-dink,
are you guys shopping, too?

00:19:35.473 --> 00:19:38.981
Yeah. Just pickin' up
a couple boring things is all.

00:19:39.064 --> 00:19:41.193
-[concerned]
-[wake]

00:19:41.277 --> 00:19:44.617
It's Chi-mi!
Hi, Chi-mi, good morning!

00:19:44.701 --> 00:19:46.705
[CHIHO]
Good morning, cutie pie.

00:19:46.788 --> 00:19:48.917
Did you go
on a big adventure today?

00:19:49.711 --> 00:19:52.633
Went on a nice picnic
with Mama and Dada.

00:19:52.717 --> 00:19:55.514
A real picnic, wow. Huh?
[shock]

00:19:56.348 --> 00:19:59.396
And Mama-Dada sleepover tonight!

00:19:59.479 --> 00:20:02.778
Cool. So, you're gonna get
to snuggling later?

00:20:02.862 --> 00:20:05.618
Whatever you're thinking, Chiho,
I promise it's not like that!

00:20:05.701 --> 00:20:06.870
Be rational about this!

00:20:06.953 --> 00:20:09.291
I wouldn't be caught
dead sleeping with that weirdo!

00:20:09.374 --> 00:20:11.880
Gonna buy a futon.

00:20:11.963 --> 00:20:15.345
A fu- [distraught]

00:20:15.428 --> 00:20:18.644
I guess this means you three are
gonna be an official family now.

00:20:18.727 --> 00:20:21.650
You'll be moving in soon,
Miss Yusa! That's so awesome.

00:20:21.733 --> 00:20:23.235
[pursed lip crazy exhales]

00:20:23.319 --> 00:20:24.404
-[pursed lip crazy faint]
-[MAOU] Chi, no!

00:20:24.488 --> 00:20:26.826
Get a grip! Everything is fine!

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:28.997
[MAOU] Do you seriously think
I would sleep with her?

00:20:29.081 --> 00:20:31.043
Well, I wouldn't sleep
with you, either!

00:20:31.126 --> 00:20:32.630
Y'know, what matters most

00:20:32.713 --> 00:20:35.051
is that you decided
to follow your hearts.

00:20:35.134 --> 00:20:36.178
Congrats.

00:20:37.013 --> 00:20:40.061
Mama and Dada,
no more fighting!

00:20:40.144 --> 00:20:41.731
[loud crying]

00:20:41.815 --> 00:20:43.944
You gotta calm down for us,
sweetie!

00:20:44.027 --> 00:20:45.948
Nobody is fighting, okay?

00:20:46.031 --> 00:20:48.578
King Satan? And female company?

00:20:48.662 --> 00:20:50.708
What's all this commotion,
your Majesty?

00:20:54.047 --> 00:20:55.425
[CHIHO]
Oh, I see.

00:20:55.509 --> 00:20:58.724
The futon is so that
Alas Ramus can sleep over!

00:20:58.807 --> 00:21:00.393
I tried to tell you that.

00:21:00.476 --> 00:21:02.397
I was a wee bit
caught off guard.

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.569
You three looked
just like a cute little family.

00:21:04.652 --> 00:21:05.988
-I rebuke you.
-Please no.

00:21:06.071 --> 00:21:07.867
You're on the same wavelength!

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:10.664
What about the futon?
I don't see one.

00:21:10.748 --> 00:21:13.837
-Was the big mission a failure?
-I guess?

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:15.966
That's why I invited Emi over.

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:17.595
We need to get your opinion.

00:21:17.678 --> 00:21:18.972
If you care for my input,

00:21:19.055 --> 00:21:20.851
then it must've been
a lofty sum.

00:21:20.934 --> 00:21:23.732
I suppose we'll all survive
without one for the day.

00:21:23.815 --> 00:21:25.193
Oh, by the way,

00:21:25.276 --> 00:21:27.531
who were you on the phone
with earlier?

00:21:27.615 --> 00:21:28.784
[ASHIYA]
About that.

00:21:28.867 --> 00:21:31.664
I reached out to Miss Suzuki
for word of advice.

00:21:31.748 --> 00:21:34.504
For some unknown reason,
we've lost contact with Bel.

00:21:35.004 --> 00:21:36.048
[EMI]
For real?

00:21:38.052 --> 00:21:40.014
Bel? Open up!

00:21:41.601 --> 00:21:44.314
Perhaps she really did leave
for Udon World.

00:21:45.024 --> 00:21:47.947
-[Suzuno soft cry]
-[gasp] Shh!

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:50.076
Hello? It's me, Chiho.

00:21:51.871 --> 00:21:53.415
I'm gonna come say hi!

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:56.506
[Suzuno crying]

00:21:57.758 --> 00:21:58.844
[worried gasp]

00:21:58.927 --> 00:22:00.806
Don't cry. Hey.

00:22:00.889 --> 00:22:02.852
What on earth happened to you?

00:22:09.991 --> 00:22:10.826
[look]

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:19.969
The croc curry I gave you.

00:22:20.052 --> 00:22:22.683
Did you use that stuff
to make some curry udon?

00:22:22.766 --> 00:22:25.939
Indeed.
And when I went in for a bite.

00:22:26.023 --> 00:22:29.530
I splashed it
all over my favorite kimono!

00:22:30.991 --> 00:22:32.285
I see.

00:22:32.368 --> 00:22:35.333
The shock led you to turn
your back on udon for a while.

00:22:35.876 --> 00:22:36.961
Call me next time,

00:22:37.045 --> 00:22:38.798
and I'll help you
clean up the stain.

00:22:38.882 --> 00:22:41.596
[SUZUNO] How could I ever admit
to something so pathetic?

00:22:41.679 --> 00:22:43.432
[EMI] Hey, now.
It's not a big deal.

00:22:43.516 --> 00:22:45.061
Well, it was to me!

00:22:45.144 --> 00:22:48.275
The ordeal gave me
quite a fright!

00:22:48.359 --> 00:22:50.948
The road to sleepovers
is a long one.

00:22:51.031 --> 00:22:52.367
Seems so.

00:22:54.914 --> 00:22:56.208
Long story short,

00:22:56.291 --> 00:22:57.878
I'm pretty sure
that we're gonna go back

00:22:57.962 --> 00:22:59.548
and buy the futon next week.

00:23:02.011 --> 00:23:04.140
-What's wrong?
-[sigh] Everything.

00:23:04.892 --> 00:23:07.438
I don't feel like
I know myself anymore.

00:23:07.523 --> 00:23:08.440
[Emi confused question]

00:23:09.109 --> 00:23:12.073
I wonder if people have
always felt this impatient.

00:23:12.156 --> 00:23:13.868
Or if cellphones
are really the nail

00:23:13.952 --> 00:23:15.956
in the coffin for humanity.

00:23:16.039 --> 00:23:17.083
[awe]

00:23:19.462 --> 00:23:21.843
I honestly don't know
what to do anymore.

00:23:22.427 --> 00:23:24.431
Should I defeat the Devil,
or not?

00:23:25.099 --> 00:23:26.936
[EMERADA] Well, you know
what most wives say

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:29.232
when they have trouble
with their husbands.

00:23:29.315 --> 00:23:31.278
"I just need to go
and stay with my parents

00:23:31.361 --> 00:23:32.990
"for a little while. Bye!"

00:23:33.073 --> 00:23:34.702
I'm nobody's wife!

00:23:36.288 --> 00:23:37.875
But you may be right.

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.841
Spending some time
in Ente Isla

00:23:41.924 --> 00:23:42.801
and sorting out my feelings

00:23:42.885 --> 00:23:44.805
doesn't sound like
such a bad idea.
