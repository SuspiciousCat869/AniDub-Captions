WEBVTT

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:09.760
[EMERADA]
That's all great.

00:00:09.801 --> 00:00:12.471
But there's something
I need to ask you.

00:00:12.513 --> 00:00:15.265
Has Lailah dropped by recently?

00:00:15.307 --> 00:00:17.267
[EMI]
Huh? Who's whom now?

00:00:17.309 --> 00:00:18.894
[EMERADA]
Well, that's an odd reply.

00:00:18.936 --> 00:00:22.105
Isn't Lailah your mother?

00:00:22.147 --> 00:00:24.566
Oh, dear. Did I get it wrong?

00:00:24.608 --> 00:00:27.653
Well, I don't have any idea
who my mother is.

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:30.072
Let alone if she's even alive.

00:00:30.113 --> 00:00:32.533
This might seem like
it's from out of nowhere,

00:00:32.574 --> 00:00:36.453
but an interesting character
stepped into and out of my life.

00:00:36.495 --> 00:00:37.538
What?

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:39.414
[EMERADA]
And the weirdest part is?

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:41.833
I'm almost entirely
convinced that this character

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:43.877
is actually your mother.

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:48.757
Everything all right?

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:51.677
You've been lost
in thought for a while now.

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:52.886
Have I?

00:00:52.928 --> 00:00:54.680
[MAOU yells]

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:56.557
What's wrong?
Where's the enemy?

00:00:56.598 --> 00:00:59.726
Keep it down, you tools!
You're gonna wake up the baby!

00:01:00.602 --> 00:01:04.022
It's time to buy... a TV!

00:02:37.324 --> 00:02:40.952
[GABRIEL yawns]

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:43.246
What a beautiful morning
of living the dream

00:02:43.288 --> 00:02:45.332
and trying out new things!

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:48.669
[SATO]
G'morning, Greece.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.797
Hey. Wassup, Sato?
Bad news, friend.

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:53.548
They're all out of oolong tea.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.968
Great, well.
Guess I'll suffer with water.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.054
What a crap start
to the work day.

00:02:59.096 --> 00:03:01.181
Didn't know you
were working today.

00:03:01.223 --> 00:03:04.184
By the way, I got the word
Sato's not your real name.

00:03:04.226 --> 00:03:06.144
Oh! It's not.

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:10.232
If my real name somehow got out,
the world would go up in flames.

00:03:10.273 --> 00:03:11.358
That sounds bad.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.401
Curious?

00:03:12.442 --> 00:03:16.321
My life story features a fall
from CEO to homeless man.

00:03:16.363 --> 00:03:19.491
But never fear, because I've got
a new business in the works.

00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:21.410
You'd share that,
but not your name?

00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:23.120
Also, shouldn't you
get to work, man?

00:03:23.161 --> 00:03:26.748
Ha! You're right.
We'll talk more later!

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.793
Heckuva guy.
I've been to heaven and back,

00:03:29.835 --> 00:03:32.754
and I've never met
anybody so full of life.

00:03:35.257 --> 00:03:36.466
Huh?

00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:40.595
And on the flip side,
you've got me.

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:44.474
Dead fish have more
life in their eyes.

00:03:44.516 --> 00:03:48.103
Huh? A friend?

00:03:48.145 --> 00:03:52.899
Yello. That's right.
You're quick.

00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:55.152
No sweat. I'll come get you.

00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:57.988
[GABRIEL]
Cheese and crackers.

00:03:58.029 --> 00:04:00.532
What's the purpose of all this?

00:04:00.574 --> 00:04:02.033
You're an angel, Gabriel!

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:05.495
Obviously,
the purpose is justice!

00:04:05.537 --> 00:04:07.205
[ASHIYA]
But for what purpose?

00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:10.208
You've said it yourself!
A television is by no means

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.128
intrinsic to our
understanding of this world!

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.630
Remember, we have
worlds of useless info!

00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:17.632
You must be pointing
at the computer, not me,

00:04:17.674 --> 00:04:19.509
because my info is priceless.

00:04:19.551 --> 00:04:20.469
On Jungle, maybe.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.262
[URUSHIHARA]
Screw you!

00:04:22.304 --> 00:04:24.681
The fridge and the washing
machine took priority.

00:04:24.723 --> 00:04:27.267
That's why we didn't buy a TV.

00:04:27.309 --> 00:04:30.645
So... now that we have some
cash, it's time to saddle up

00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:33.315
and ride this pony
to television town!

00:04:33.356 --> 00:04:35.567
Why must this be an issue now?

00:04:35.609 --> 00:04:39.070
Lemme break it down.
Emi has a TV at her place.

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:40.447
Huh? So what?

00:04:40.489 --> 00:04:41.907
It's not fair.

00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:43.200
[GROUP]
Hmm?

00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:47.370
I should be able to watch
cartoons with Alas Ramus, too!

00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:49.080
Radical honesty!

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:50.373
I barely watch the thing.

00:04:50.415 --> 00:04:52.918
I'd give it away
if someone wanted it.

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:54.669
--Me!
--Not you.

00:04:54.711 --> 00:04:56.922
My liege,
I completely understand.

00:04:56.963 --> 00:04:57.798
Really?

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:58.799
However!

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.301
There're still cable fees
to think about.

00:05:01.343 --> 00:05:02.302
Huh?

00:05:02.344 --> 00:05:04.262
I believe I can figure this out.

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:07.307
We're up against a fierce
enemy known as "the budget."

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:10.435
And the only way to quell
this beast is with research!

00:05:10.477 --> 00:05:12.062
Research on...?

00:05:12.103 --> 00:05:13.980
Well, cable contracts, to start.

00:05:14.022 --> 00:05:16.399
It would also behoove us
to contact the landlady

00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:17.651
as soon as possible.

00:05:17.692 --> 00:05:21.446
If she says our endeavor
will require additional fees,

00:05:21.488 --> 00:05:23.365
this conversation can die.

00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:26.493
I seriously doubt it will;
my rent includes all that stuff.

00:05:26.535 --> 00:05:28.245
I beg your silence, please!

00:05:28.286 --> 00:05:30.622
I secretly don't
want a television!

00:05:30.664 --> 00:05:32.916
It's not a secret, now.

00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.417
[MAOU]
Answer me this, Ashiya.

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:37.671
If the cable thing doesn't end
up being a big issue,

00:05:37.712 --> 00:05:39.714
just how much can we spend?

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:42.384
[ASHIYA]
Hmm...

00:05:42.425 --> 00:05:43.718
Math done!

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.553
[MAOU]
Well?

00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:48.473
I conclude, if we consider the
income from our temp jobs.

00:05:48.515 --> 00:05:50.767
We can pay 5,000 per person!

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:53.061
That's a total of 15,000 yen!

00:05:53.103 --> 00:05:54.896
Hell, I'll allow 20K!

00:05:54.938 --> 00:05:57.274
Dude! You're making me pay, too?

00:05:57.315 --> 00:06:00.193
But of course! You should
be grateful, young man.

00:06:00.235 --> 00:06:02.362
I should seize all of your
earnings to compensate

00:06:02.404 --> 00:06:05.282
for your love affair
with Jungle dot co!

00:06:05.323 --> 00:06:08.910
[chuckles]
Twenty thousand yen, you say?

00:06:08.952 --> 00:06:09.953
[gasps]

00:06:09.995 --> 00:06:12.539
[MAOU] Silly Ashiya.
You're forgetting something.

00:06:12.581 --> 00:06:14.291
What might that be?

00:06:14.332 --> 00:06:18.086
Where'd I buy the washing
machine? And the fridge, too?

00:06:18.128 --> 00:06:19.170
Well, as I recall,

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:22.173
the Yodogawabashi
Camera in Shinjuku.

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:23.008
[gasps]

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:26.219
[MAOU] Finally.
You figured out my plan!

00:06:26.261 --> 00:06:27.596
[ASHIYA]
You... You have--?!

00:06:27.637 --> 00:06:29.180
[MAOU] Points on points!
I bought all that crap

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:32.809
in the middle of a ten percent
points back promotion!

00:06:32.851 --> 00:06:36.187
I am the king of points!

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:37.147
[ASHIYA]
I can't believe it!

00:06:37.188 --> 00:06:41.568
Twenty K? Ha! That's easy!
If I factor in all my points,

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.822
that's a whopping 26,239 yen
total I'm rockin' with!

00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:48.033
That can't be!

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:49.284
Who's thrifty now?
Thanks for the free rope,

00:06:49.326 --> 00:06:52.537
I had just enough
to hang you with!

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:54.831
[URUSHIHARA]
Sorry you had to see this.

00:06:54.873 --> 00:06:57.959
It's cool!
I like watching his passion.

00:06:58.543 --> 00:07:00.253
[EMI] You wanna come
all the way to my place?

00:07:00.295 --> 00:07:01.087
[SUZUNO]
Yes.

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:03.798
I believe I left something
there I'd like to pick up.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:04.841
and while I'm over,

00:07:04.883 --> 00:07:07.802
I might as well briefly
inspect your television.

00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:09.346
So are you gonna get one, too?

00:07:09.387 --> 00:07:11.389
It sounds to me like the Devil

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:13.767
is going to make his
purchase sometime tomorrow.

00:07:13.808 --> 00:07:15.060
For the sake of efficiency,

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:17.604
I'm planning on buying mine
at the same time.

00:07:17.646 --> 00:07:19.606
Aren't all of them
jobless right now?

00:07:19.648 --> 00:07:22.150
Why is he so gung-ho
to spend money?

00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:24.235
Eh! Guess it's not my problem

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:27.364
if those dinguses get themselves
into financial trouble.

00:07:27.405 --> 00:07:28.657
But wouldn't it be best

00:07:28.698 --> 00:07:31.242
if things stay exactly
how they are?

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:33.286
Yeah. Good point.

00:07:33.912 --> 00:07:36.247
I think about
that kinda stuff a lot.

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:38.249
If things can stay
the way they are,

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:42.087
and if all the people I love can
find happiness with each other.

00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:43.463
Seems doubtful.

00:07:43.505 --> 00:07:46.341
Funny. You're more like
Mister Maou than you think.

00:07:46.383 --> 00:07:48.677
What now?
That's a cruel joke.

00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:50.512
[CHIHO giggles]

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:55.600
Finding happiness, huh?

00:07:55.642 --> 00:07:59.354
I wonder how much longer
things will stay this quiet.

00:07:59.396 --> 00:08:00.897
I've been thinking.

00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:02.607
We all should prepare ourselves.

00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:05.235
I fear that soon we will
need to act in opposition

00:08:05.276 --> 00:08:06.361
to our ultimate goal.

00:08:06.403 --> 00:08:07.821
Huh?

00:08:07.862 --> 00:08:09.614
I won't be shocked
if there comes a day

00:08:09.656 --> 00:08:11.116
when we'll need
to protect the devil.

00:08:11.157 --> 00:08:13.702
Huh? Why would we?

00:08:14.536 --> 00:08:16.037
After what happened in Choshi,

00:08:16.079 --> 00:08:18.623
the demon realm knows
he's alive and well.

00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:19.582
Worst case scenario,

00:08:19.624 --> 00:08:22.127
he's kidnapped and
taken back to Ente Isla.

00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:24.421
Huh? The demons would take him?

00:08:24.462 --> 00:08:27.382
If they prevail, I'm positive
it will be with the intention

00:08:27.424 --> 00:08:30.093
of persuading him into
reestablishing his army.

00:08:30.135 --> 00:08:31.761
Do you recall the zealots?

00:08:31.803 --> 00:08:34.848
If they're as Camio said,
they're still loyal to Satan.

00:08:34.889 --> 00:08:37.434
Yeah. But there's no chance
he could raise an army

00:08:37.475 --> 00:08:39.436
the way he is now.

00:08:39.477 --> 00:08:40.854
[SUZUNO]
He's still a king.

00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:43.314
He made that evident in Choshi.

00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:44.482
What do you mean?

00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:46.776
If he's forced to choose
between his two lives,

00:08:46.818 --> 00:08:49.487
he won't abandon the
citizens asking for help.

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:52.323
If that happens,
he'll never return here.

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:54.117
You said you're shopping
with them, right?

00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:55.827
Is that to keep an eye out?

00:08:55.869 --> 00:09:00.248
Yes, but I sincerely
want a television set.

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:02.834
I'm content with the
bubble in which we live.

00:09:02.876 --> 00:09:04.753
Uh, wait, what bubble?

00:09:04.794 --> 00:09:07.672
Our lives of comfort
feel rather ephemeral.

00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:11.009
If we can keep the Devil
in Japan, he's no longer threat.

00:09:11.051 --> 00:09:14.012
What's more, the two of us get
to live ever so comfortably.

00:09:14.054 --> 00:09:16.514
In this world,
we're blessed by a rich culture,

00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:19.225
good friends,
and several luxuries.

00:09:19.267 --> 00:09:20.435
But what's next?

00:09:20.477 --> 00:09:21.853
Though I quite enjoy this life,

00:09:21.895 --> 00:09:25.023
I have to wonder
when the bubble will pop.

00:09:25.607 --> 00:09:28.401
All that said, I'll
work against the worst case

00:09:28.443 --> 00:09:29.903
and watch over them.

00:09:29.944 --> 00:09:31.029
Sure. Heads up,

00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:34.032
few things are more boring
than surveilling those goons.

00:09:34.074 --> 00:09:38.369
[phone buzzes]

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:41.956
Hey! D'you call?

00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:43.750
Please don't laugh.

00:09:43.792 --> 00:09:46.461
You know that I won't.
So, tell me!

00:09:46.503 --> 00:09:49.506
Well, I, uh, I'm fully
aware of how weird it is

00:09:49.547 --> 00:09:50.799
for me to ask you about this,

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.594
but you're the only
person that I can.

00:09:54.636 --> 00:09:55.678
Sure.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:59.474
So, uh, what kind of clothes
do you think Ashiya is into?

00:09:59.516 --> 00:10:00.558
[EMI]
Hmm?!

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:05.313
You there?

00:10:05.355 --> 00:10:07.148
[EMI]
Cheap stuff, obviously.

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:10.652
What does that mean?
No snobby, designer brands?

00:10:10.693 --> 00:10:14.572
The dude exclusively wears
the same cheap junk from Unislo.

00:10:14.614 --> 00:10:17.242
He must've picked the crappiest
shoes they had on purpose.

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:19.869
[RIKA] Wait, that's
not what I need to know.

00:10:19.911 --> 00:10:21.454
[EMI]
What do you need to know?

00:10:21.496 --> 00:10:24.415
Please! Don't play dumb!
I need your help!

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:26.334
C'mon, Emi, just tell me
what style of clothes

00:10:26.376 --> 00:10:28.545
he might find attractive
on a woman!

00:10:30.046 --> 00:10:32.382
[EMI]
May I ask you a question first?

00:10:32.423 --> 00:10:33.800
Yeah. What's up?

00:10:33.842 --> 00:10:36.386
[EMI] Is there something
going on between you two?

00:10:36.427 --> 00:10:39.556
No, nothing's going
on in the slightest, duh!

00:10:39.597 --> 00:10:45.019
There is one thing. It's small.

00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:46.479
He asked me out!

00:10:46.521 --> 00:10:49.440
He wants us to go shopping
together tomorrow!

00:10:51.401 --> 00:10:52.902
[EMI]
What?

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.574
[ASHIYA] This outing is
purely for research, Sire.

00:10:57.615 --> 00:10:59.450
[MAOU]
Research deez nuts.

00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:02.245
And dude?
What made you invite Rika?

00:11:02.287 --> 00:11:04.372
She can provide us
with objective advice.

00:11:04.414 --> 00:11:06.875
I'm sure she's experienced
this sort of thing.

00:11:06.916 --> 00:11:09.627
She must be so smart.
You think I'm not?

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:13.006
I've put a lot of thought
into this for your information.

00:11:13.047 --> 00:11:15.508
And yeah, there have been,
like, buttloads of times

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:17.343
when I wished that we had a TV.

00:11:17.385 --> 00:11:19.095
Huh? You never told me.

00:11:19.137 --> 00:11:22.182
It first happened back in
my early MgRonald's days.

00:11:22.223 --> 00:11:25.018
You know how we serve that
Happiness Meal for kids?

00:11:25.059 --> 00:11:26.352
It comes with a toy?

00:11:26.394 --> 00:11:27.228
Go on.

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:30.273
One fateful day, a young boy
ordered a Happiness Meal.

00:11:30.315 --> 00:11:32.775
"Cool!" I said,
"which toy would you like?"

00:11:32.817 --> 00:11:35.195
and he said.

00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:36.905
[KENTARO]
The one who says "geroro"!

00:11:41.826 --> 00:11:44.412
See? The face you all just
made was the same as mine

00:11:44.454 --> 00:11:45.622
after he stumped me.

00:11:45.663 --> 00:11:49.417
Ah! Agh! Poor boy!
What's "geroro"?

00:11:49.459 --> 00:11:50.210
Way back then,

00:11:50.251 --> 00:11:54.255
I was too naïve to know that
sound was made by a Pokéture.

00:11:54.297 --> 00:11:55.632
I did a quick search.

00:11:55.673 --> 00:11:58.801
It seems like that one was
introduced in this movie.

00:11:58.843 --> 00:12:00.595
Digero, the frog Pokéture.

00:12:00.637 --> 00:12:02.847
Turns into a dragon
when it transforms.

00:12:02.889 --> 00:12:05.266
I would've thought "geroro"
was enough of a clue

00:12:05.308 --> 00:12:07.518
to guess it's the one
that looks like a frog.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.020
In Japanese, sure.

00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:12.315
But animal noises vary from
place to place in this world.

00:12:12.357 --> 00:12:13.149
In some countries,

00:12:13.191 --> 00:12:15.360
toads say weird crap
like "ribbit, ribbit."

00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:18.196
And? What is the
moral of this fable?

00:12:18.238 --> 00:12:21.574
The point is,
if I had seen the toys on TV,

00:12:21.616 --> 00:12:23.993
then I would've had
knowledge on the brand.

00:12:24.035 --> 00:12:27.705
Therefore, I could've better
served the young customer!

00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:28.706
Kiss-ass.

00:12:28.748 --> 00:12:30.583
And of course,
you could always ask,

00:12:30.625 --> 00:12:32.919
"Why would we be
watching Poketure?"

00:12:32.961 --> 00:12:35.380
And I answer you,
we wouldn't even have to!

00:12:35.421 --> 00:12:37.090
We'd know a ton just from ads!

00:12:37.131 --> 00:12:39.425
We should depart soon.

00:12:39.467 --> 00:12:40.718
Sire. Let's go.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:44.222
Uh. Right.
We should be back soon, bye.

00:12:44.264 --> 00:12:45.556
[URUSHIHARA]
Have fun, dweebs.

00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:47.517
I have more reasons!
The other day,

00:12:47.558 --> 00:12:49.852
some people were talking about a
variety show in the break room--

00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:51.771
[SUZUNO]
Stop this madness.

00:12:57.318 --> 00:12:58.444
[EMI]
That's right.

00:12:58.486 --> 00:13:00.655
Feel free to call
whenever you need.

00:13:00.697 --> 00:13:01.906
Thank you for your patience.

00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:05.410
It's been such a pleasure
to serve you today.

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:08.204
Uh... Yusa? So, uh...

00:13:08.246 --> 00:13:09.122
What now?

00:13:09.163 --> 00:13:11.666
Oh, crap, my bad!
It's nothing at all!

00:13:11.708 --> 00:13:15.586
Huh? Sorry. What's up?

00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:17.171
Well, it's just.

00:13:17.213 --> 00:13:19.465
I wanted to know if you and
Rika are fighting right now.

00:13:19.507 --> 00:13:21.342
Huh? Why would you say that?

00:13:21.384 --> 00:13:25.054
Just 'cause she was acting all
weird and nervous yesterday.

00:13:25.096 --> 00:13:27.473
And she mentioned
something about calling you?

00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:28.850
Now she opts
to take the day off,

00:13:28.891 --> 00:13:31.853
and you look like
you're out for blood.

00:13:31.894 --> 00:13:34.397
I can see why you thought
we were fighting.

00:13:34.439 --> 00:13:37.066
Oh, so you aren't?
Well, that's good to hear.

00:13:37.108 --> 00:13:38.443
But what's with her?

00:13:38.484 --> 00:13:40.403
Did she get a boyfriend
or something?

00:13:40.445 --> 00:13:41.571
Huuuh?!

00:13:41.612 --> 00:13:42.697
You good?

00:13:42.739 --> 00:13:44.907
Yeah, of course!
The goodest!

00:13:47.577 --> 00:13:50.955
[EMI growls] Screw this crap!
They can't do this to me!

00:13:50.997 --> 00:13:52.081
Yusa?

00:13:52.123 --> 00:13:54.000
Haha. Oops.

00:13:54.625 --> 00:13:56.753
[EMI] Does Rika have
any idea that Maou and Bel

00:13:56.794 --> 00:13:58.421
will be there, too?

00:13:58.463 --> 00:14:01.090
She never used
the word "date," but still,

00:14:01.132 --> 00:14:03.092
I imagine she'll be
a little disappointed

00:14:03.134 --> 00:14:05.094
that they won't be alone.

00:14:05.136 --> 00:14:07.221
Why would I care about that?!

00:14:09.766 --> 00:14:11.100
[EMI]
I've got to get it together.

00:14:11.142 --> 00:14:12.769
That man is a demon!

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:14.979
I'm not going to play
interspecies matchmaker

00:14:15.021 --> 00:14:17.357
for some dandy demon
and my workwife!

00:14:17.398 --> 00:14:18.399
Good thing Bel's there.

00:14:18.441 --> 00:14:20.360
Not only will
she make sure Rika's safe,

00:14:20.401 --> 00:14:22.653
but the dumb
and dumber are, too.

00:14:22.695 --> 00:14:25.156
Stop, brain! We hate them!

00:14:27.408 --> 00:14:29.869
So, Yusa,

00:14:29.911 --> 00:14:31.204
Why don't you take the day off?

00:14:31.245 --> 00:14:32.705
Huh?

00:14:34.749 --> 00:14:37.085
[ALAS RAMUS]
Mama? Something wrong?

00:14:37.126 --> 00:14:39.754
Everything's fine.
I'm going to be fine.

00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:47.929
If I'm gonna get
a little time off,

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:50.223
I better not let it go to waste!

00:14:51.516 --> 00:14:55.353
Grub supply is low.
Rad! Tea!

00:14:55.395 --> 00:14:57.647
[URUSHIHARA]
You're still in Japan, huh?

00:14:57.688 --> 00:15:00.566
Well, you missed Maou.
He's out shopping today.

00:15:00.608 --> 00:15:01.776
[GABRIEL]
I am well aware.

00:15:01.818 --> 00:15:04.695
I'm here to shoot the
breeze with you, compadre.

00:15:07.031 --> 00:15:08.491
I also know his right-hand man

00:15:08.533 --> 00:15:10.701
and that flying neighbor chick
are out with him.

00:15:10.743 --> 00:15:12.412
It's our perfect chance to chat.

00:15:12.453 --> 00:15:13.413
Oh, great.

00:15:13.454 --> 00:15:15.289
Just keep it short
and sweet, please.

00:15:15.331 --> 00:15:16.416
If you can't manage that,

00:15:16.457 --> 00:15:19.127
I'll tell Ashiya you're
raiding his precious fridge.

00:15:19.168 --> 00:15:21.212
You fuddy duddy.

00:15:21.254 --> 00:15:22.255
You had a guest come over,

00:15:22.296 --> 00:15:25.383
obviously you were going to
provide some refreshments.

00:15:25.425 --> 00:15:26.884
First, you aren't a guest.

00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:28.970
Second, it doesn't matter
what the hell I do,

00:15:29.011 --> 00:15:30.388
I'll get yelled at.

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:31.764
Yelled at, you say?

00:15:31.806 --> 00:15:34.684
That's funny.
What happened to you, man?

00:15:34.725 --> 00:15:37.562
You were the son of the dawn,
the one closest to God.

00:15:37.603 --> 00:15:40.314
Now you get dunked
on by greasy demons?

Wash your hair.
You invented greasy.

Tell me why you serve
a punk like him.

00:15:47.113 --> 00:15:48.531
Everybody up in heaven says

00:15:48.573 --> 00:15:49.866
it's all because
your power levels

00:15:49.907 --> 00:15:51.993
went the way of
the dodo, y'know?

00:15:52.034 --> 00:15:53.411
But I wanted to hear firsthand

00:15:53.453 --> 00:15:56.164
what made you fall down
to the demon realm.

00:15:57.957 --> 00:16:00.168
There was nothing to do.

'Scuse me?

My life is fun now.

Surfing the web and
suffocating in this hole is fun?

00:16:07.216 --> 00:16:09.802
Absolutely.

00:16:09.844 --> 00:16:11.804
It's infinitely better
than going crazy

00:16:11.846 --> 00:16:14.849
from sitting up in heaven all
day with nothing to do.

00:16:15.725 --> 00:16:17.560
I couldn't take
the boredom any longer.

00:16:17.602 --> 00:16:20.563
So I swooped down and
joined up with Satan's crew.

Now we're talking, buddy!

I carted my toned little booty
all the way to Sasazuka

00:16:28.362 --> 00:16:30.740
to try to get some
real info on Satan.

00:16:30.781 --> 00:16:32.241
Talk to him yourself.

00:16:32.283 --> 00:16:35.453
Nah, man, I'm not talking
about the Lord of the Fries.

00:16:35.495 --> 00:16:38.039
I wanna know about the OG.

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:41.375
The one you
used to pal around with.

00:16:41.417 --> 00:16:45.129
I want all the deets on the
legendary Demon King Satan.

00:16:47.215 --> 00:16:48.966
Is that all you wanted to know?

00:16:49.008 --> 00:16:50.676
I wasted my serious face.

00:16:50.718 --> 00:16:53.012
Tone down the
dismissiveness, man!

00:16:53.054 --> 00:16:54.722
Couldn't you tell that I've
been trying to establish a

00:16:54.764 --> 00:16:56.849
"this is very important" mood?

00:16:56.891 --> 00:16:58.976
[URUSHIHARA] NEETs
who read the mood are B-tier.

00:16:59.018 --> 00:17:01.521
Is a top tier NEET
a good thing to be?

00:17:01.562 --> 00:17:04.315
NEETs who care about
other's opinions are C-tier.

00:17:04.357 --> 00:17:06.275
[GABRIEL] Wouldn't someone
like that get kicked out?

00:17:06.317 --> 00:17:08.694
Only D-tier and
below get booted.

00:17:08.736 --> 00:17:09.529
Whoa.

00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:12.031
However, those of us
who make it into the S-tier

00:17:12.073 --> 00:17:13.783
know exactly how
parasitic we can be

00:17:13.824 --> 00:17:15.535
before our hosts
go in for the extraction.

00:17:15.576 --> 00:17:18.246
Sorry, but I can't wrap
my head around NEET pride.

00:17:18.287 --> 00:17:19.121
This is your life.

00:17:19.163 --> 00:17:21.791
Don't you want to do more
than leech off your friends?

00:17:21.832 --> 00:17:26.003
Look who's the fuddy
duddy now, Gabey-Baby.

00:17:26.045 --> 00:17:28.089
If that crap hadn't gone
down way back when,

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:31.425
all y'all would be living that
NEET life, just like me.

00:17:31.467 --> 00:17:32.885
Huh?

00:17:34.303 --> 00:17:37.515
You just read the mood!
That's so B-tier.

00:17:37.557 --> 00:17:39.475
My bad. C'mon.

00:17:39.517 --> 00:17:41.769
Try to stick to
the topic, please.

00:17:41.811 --> 00:17:45.648
I want any info you have on
Demon King Satan's treasures.

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:48.234
Mind spilling the beans
to your old pal?

00:17:48.276 --> 00:17:49.110
Treasures?

00:17:49.151 --> 00:17:51.654
Aren't you busy tracking down
the shards of who-cares?

00:17:51.696 --> 00:17:55.241
Emi got another one recently,
she's wrecking you, dude-brah.

00:17:55.283 --> 00:17:58.244
Good for her.
I gave that hunt a break.

00:17:58.286 --> 00:18:02.039
Truth is, they took me off
the case after I blew it.

00:18:09.797 --> 00:18:11.674
[EMI]
I've got the sacred sword,

00:18:11.716 --> 00:18:15.511
Alas Ramus, and the crystal
that led Ciriatto our way.

00:18:15.553 --> 00:18:19.473
I'm pretty sure the shards of
Yesod attract each other.

00:18:19.515 --> 00:18:22.018
Not only did that woman know
Alas Ramus's name,

00:18:22.059 --> 00:18:24.812
but she knew
about the shards, too.

00:18:24.854 --> 00:18:26.272
Could she be--?

00:18:26.314 --> 00:18:29.400
Shut up! You seriously
think you met my mother?

00:18:29.442 --> 00:18:30.526
[EMERADA]
Uh-huh.

00:18:30.568 --> 00:18:32.737
Sorry I didn't call you sooner.

00:18:32.778 --> 00:18:35.656
We're having a teensy bit
of trouble over here.

00:18:35.698 --> 00:18:37.408
Trouble like what?

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:39.994
It's the Efzahan empire
to the east.

00:18:40.036 --> 00:18:41.871
They want to conquer
the central continent,

00:18:41.912 --> 00:18:46.167
so they declared war
against every other country.

00:18:46.208 --> 00:18:48.753
Wait. So while I was here,
a war broke out?

00:18:48.794 --> 00:18:52.006
That's right.
Apparently, their army is tough.

00:18:52.048 --> 00:18:55.009
There have even been demons
spotted amongst them.

00:18:55.051 --> 00:18:57.470
Real talk, do you need me
to come back home?

00:18:57.511 --> 00:18:59.805
Not at all.

00:18:59.847 --> 00:19:03.476
You see, if you came flying
down, sacred sword in hand,

00:19:03.517 --> 00:19:05.770
to take part in a war
between humans--

00:19:05.853 --> 00:19:07.563
"The Hero" would lose power.

00:19:07.605 --> 00:19:08.939
And choosing sides like that

00:19:08.981 --> 00:19:11.275
could quickly undermine
my credibility.

00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:12.610
[EMERADA]
That's it exactly.

00:19:12.652 --> 00:19:17.323
So, work hard and stick it out
in Japan for a while longer.

00:19:17.365 --> 00:19:19.075
I know you have Satan
to worry about,

00:19:19.116 --> 00:19:21.077
but Lailah might be there, too.

00:19:21.118 --> 00:19:23.329
Oh, yeah.
Can we address that?

00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:26.457
How'd you ever get the idea
that she's my mom?

00:19:26.499 --> 00:19:28.626
[EMERADA]
Let me explain what happened.

00:19:28.668 --> 00:19:31.087
One day, I dropped
into my local bar.

00:19:31.128 --> 00:19:34.215
And that's when I found
a kindred spirit of sorts!

00:19:34.256 --> 00:19:35.257
Uh...

00:19:35.299 --> 00:19:37.134
I invited her to stay
the night with me,

00:19:37.176 --> 00:19:39.637
but she decided
to move in for a bit.

00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:41.305
The two of us got along well!

00:19:41.347 --> 00:19:43.974
She has long silver hair,
and pretty eyes,

00:19:44.016 --> 00:19:46.185
and a face that looks
a lot like yours!

00:19:46.227 --> 00:19:49.188
Good grief. This sounds
like a "your mom" joke.

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:52.358
For whatever reason,
she vanished into thin air!

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:56.028
But not without leaving a
thank-you note, of course.

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:59.615
She wrote, "I'm glad I got to
meet my daughter's friend."

00:19:59.657 --> 00:20:02.034
And that got me thinking.

00:20:02.076 --> 00:20:03.869
Maybe she disappeared to Japan

00:20:03.911 --> 00:20:07.164
so that she could check out
what you were up to.

00:20:09.792 --> 00:20:12.336
My mom? Nah.

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.296
[GABRIEL]
Your handwriting blows.

00:20:14.338 --> 00:20:17.925
I can't tell where the words
start and end, get some help.

00:20:17.967 --> 00:20:20.928
Man. Is this really
all there is?

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:22.096
[URUSHIHARA]
In my experience,

00:20:22.138 --> 00:20:25.307
people called Satan are
always poor for some reason.

00:20:25.349 --> 00:20:28.394
I can't remember anything that'd
be worth calling a "treasure."

00:20:28.436 --> 00:20:30.020
That's all I can do for you.

00:20:30.062 --> 00:20:32.064
[GABRIEL]
Okay.

00:20:32.106 --> 00:20:34.400
I guess I'll call it
a day, then.

00:20:34.442 --> 00:20:37.403
Just keep in mind that I'm the
only reason he's standing down.

00:20:37.445 --> 00:20:39.405
What now? Who's "he"?

00:20:39.447 --> 00:20:41.198
The watcher. And he's here.

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:42.700
Huh?

00:20:42.742 --> 00:20:45.911
With his partner Sariel gone,
you should've predicted

00:20:45.953 --> 00:20:48.956
he'd show up in
Japan sooner or later.

00:20:48.998 --> 00:20:51.792
How could I? You all went
ghost-mode for years!

00:20:51.834 --> 00:20:54.462
Why are you showing
signs of life now?

00:20:55.504 --> 00:20:58.048
[GABRIEL] Call me if you
remember anything else.

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.635
[URUSHIHARA]
In your dreams.

00:21:01.677 --> 00:21:03.637
Hope you have a nice day, bud.

00:21:08.476 --> 00:21:10.227
[EMI]
And done.

00:21:10.269 --> 00:21:12.813
Now to add celestial force.

00:21:15.107 --> 00:21:19.779
Ah! It worked!

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:23.866
[EMI] If I did this right, it
should lead me to more shards.

00:21:23.908 --> 00:21:26.285
[CHIHO] I really wish that
I could've gone TV shopping

00:21:26.327 --> 00:21:27.203
with them.

00:21:27.244 --> 00:21:28.954
Huh? TV shopping?

00:21:28.996 --> 00:21:30.080
Yeah, that's right.

00:21:30.122 --> 00:21:33.209
Mister Maou and Mister Ashiya
are out looking for one today.

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:34.043
Cute!

00:21:34.084 --> 00:21:35.169
Wait, why "cute?"

00:21:35.211 --> 00:21:36.670
Just think about it!

00:21:36.712 --> 00:21:39.799
Those are your two male friends
who live together, aren't they?

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:40.674
Uh-huh.

00:21:40.716 --> 00:21:43.302
Two roommates.
Shopping as a pair.

00:21:43.344 --> 00:21:46.305
Well, not quite. I think
Miss Suzuno was going, too.

00:21:46.347 --> 00:21:48.390
Hot! Do you think
they'll hold hands,

00:21:48.432 --> 00:21:49.600
or will they allow their fingers

00:21:49.642 --> 00:21:52.228
to gently graze across
the other's thigh?

00:21:52.269 --> 00:21:53.604
Or will they be too nervous?

00:21:53.646 --> 00:21:56.774
Earth to Kao.
Are you feeling okay?

00:22:03.072 --> 00:22:04.490
[RIKA]
Ready.

00:22:05.241 --> 00:22:06.700
[CHIHO]
I'm home!

00:22:06.742 --> 00:22:10.204
I wonder if the boys have
already gotten their TV.
