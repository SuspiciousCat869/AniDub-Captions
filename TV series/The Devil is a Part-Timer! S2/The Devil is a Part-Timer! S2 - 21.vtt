Mm...

00:00:05.637 --> 00:00:06.639
Huh!

00:00:06.722 --> 00:00:08.058
[Emi gasps]

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:10.479
I'm late!

00:00:10.772 --> 00:00:13.193
[RIKA] Are you even
listening to me? Emi!

00:00:13.276 --> 00:00:15.489
Uh... Huh?
What's up?

00:00:15.573 --> 00:00:17.953
I found a ramen place
that looks pretty bomb.

00:00:18.036 --> 00:00:19.247
You wanna do lunch?

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.794
Heck, yeah, I do!
It's been too long.

00:00:21.961 --> 00:00:23.088
-[cell phone vibrates]
-Uh...

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.052
One second.
Hey. How are you?

00:00:26.595 --> 00:00:28.849
[CHIHO]
Super great, Miss Yusa!

00:00:29.475 --> 00:00:32.273
I'm getting really excited
for dinner tomorrow night!

00:00:32.983 --> 00:00:34.653
I look forward to it, too.

00:00:35.195 --> 00:00:38.285
If you wouldn't mind, could you
get me a few ingredients?

00:00:40.247 --> 00:00:42.877
What could you possibly be
doing with that many eggs?

00:00:44.046 --> 00:00:46.175
I thought
I'd try making a "quiche."

00:00:46.301 --> 00:00:48.764
Miss Sasaki tells me
it's a thrifty delicacy.

00:00:49.015 --> 00:00:51.394
Next time,
pinch pennies on your own, man.

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:52.731
That sounds great!

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:55.193
The kiddo and I both love eggs,
don't we?

00:00:55.945 --> 00:00:58.868
Mama?
Can we go see Dada now?

00:01:00.538 --> 00:01:01.707
[doorknob rattles]

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.460
-How weird.
-[knocking on door]

00:01:03.544 --> 00:01:06.382
Hey, Maou! Have you gone all
shut-in freak on us, or what?

00:01:06.508 --> 00:01:08.679
Uh, hello?
You alive in there?

00:01:08.763 --> 00:01:10.057
Should we be worried?

00:01:15.568 --> 00:01:16.737
Ah!

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.031
[Emi grunts]

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:25.379
There you are.
You really freaked me out.

00:01:25.546 --> 00:01:27.801
You're supposed to answer
when people knock, y'know?

00:01:28.051 --> 00:01:30.222
Or get ritzy,
and invest in a doorbell.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.519
In other news,
our friends disappeared.

00:01:32.644 --> 00:01:34.856
So, I'm pretty glad
to see your ugly mug.

00:01:35.858 --> 00:01:36.944
Once they're back,

00:01:37.027 --> 00:01:39.490
we should all
get together for a dinner.

00:01:42.496 --> 00:01:43.582
[gasps]

00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:45.335
[gasps]

00:01:45.795 --> 00:01:48.341
[panting]

00:01:50.638 --> 00:01:51.807
Just a dream.

00:01:52.725 --> 00:01:55.940
Why do I always want
whatever I can't have?

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.081
Guess we should go.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.210
Wait, but, what comes next?

00:02:06.335 --> 00:02:07.714
All that's left
for us to do now

00:02:07.797 --> 00:02:09.634
is try our best to be patient.

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:11.597
I have faith in our friends.

00:02:11.847 --> 00:02:14.519
Mister Maou and Miss Suzuno
are going to keep everyone safe

00:02:14.603 --> 00:02:17.357
and bring them home soon.
They said they would.

00:02:21.115 --> 00:02:22.159
[Maou groans]

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:24.539
As soon as I get here,
I'm building crap.

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:26.375
-[SUZUNO] Complaining
won't help. -Huh?

00:02:27.377 --> 00:02:28.964
Having fun in there?

00:02:29.215 --> 00:02:30.383
[SUZUNO] Come now?

00:02:30.467 --> 00:02:33.139
[MAOU] It's a little early
for beddy-bye, don't you think?

00:02:33.223 --> 00:02:35.268
I won't be judged
by the likes of you.

00:02:35.561 --> 00:02:36.939
In order to stay combat ready

00:02:37.022 --> 00:02:38.651
I must get used
to movement in this.

00:02:38.776 --> 00:02:41.657
I introduce you
to the Tucked-in Twinsies!

00:02:42.032 --> 00:02:43.326
[MAOU]
Wow, real mature.

00:02:43.828 --> 00:02:46.290
Just couldn't wait to try out
your sleeping bags, could you?

00:02:46.542 --> 00:02:47.752
-Mm-hm.
-No!

00:02:47.836 --> 00:02:50.382
That's not true!
I'm simply training!

00:02:51.342 --> 00:02:53.556
-[SUZUNO] Ahh!
-[TSUBASA] Maou. It fell down.

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:56.185
[SUZUNO] Incredible,
now you've derailed everything!

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.816
[MAOU] Yeah, yeah.
Give me a minute to fix it.

00:02:58.899 --> 00:03:00.443
Change behind a tree
or something.

00:03:00.611 --> 00:03:02.406
Hm. Huh!

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.036
Before you go,
put on some bug spray!

00:03:05.412 --> 00:03:07.082
I don't need your guidance!

00:03:07.416 --> 00:03:09.504
Hey, Twinsie. Help me out.

00:03:09.838 --> 00:03:11.048
'Kay!

00:03:12.134 --> 00:03:13.596
[MAOU]
Here's a question.

00:03:13.762 --> 00:03:15.390
When did you and Nord
get to Japan

00:03:15.473 --> 00:03:16.935
in the first place?

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.356
Ah.
According to my calculations

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.653
I've only been alive
for about a year, so...

00:03:21.737 --> 00:03:23.741
[MAOU]
For real? Just one?

00:03:23.908 --> 00:03:25.870
Yup!
I've been living with my dad

00:03:25.953 --> 00:03:27.790
ever since
I was a whole zero years old

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:30.128
and I've got no idea
what went on before that!

00:03:30.462 --> 00:03:31.590
[MAOU]
A year, though.

00:03:33.176 --> 00:03:34.554
It's weird
you got a human form

00:03:34.638 --> 00:03:36.892
before Alas Ramus
if you're the younger sister.

00:03:37.017 --> 00:03:38.520
-Huh?
-From where I'm sitting

00:03:38.604 --> 00:03:41.067
it seems like Nord's
been in Japan for a while.

00:03:42.152 --> 00:03:43.279
My brain hurts.

00:03:43.781 --> 00:03:44.908
[SUZUNO]
Why's that?

00:03:45.283 --> 00:03:46.745
Things are so confusing.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.208
We'll need a big family meeting
to make sense of it all.

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.590
Huh! Hey, be careful!
You scared me!

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.803
[SUZUNO] You're at fault
for not watching your back.

00:03:56.013 --> 00:03:57.057
What's wrong now?

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.478
Readying new complaints
about my wardrobe?

00:03:59.896 --> 00:04:02.527
Nah. It is a pretty
intense look, though.

00:04:03.027 --> 00:04:05.240
Those are church vestments,
right?

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.327
I want to blend
in the masses.

00:04:07.662 --> 00:04:10.417
These will prevent suspicion
when we pass through towns.

00:04:11.252 --> 00:04:13.089
Why are you looking at me
like that?

00:04:13.464 --> 00:04:15.051
[MAOU] I've only ever
seen you wear a kimono

00:04:15.135 --> 00:04:16.930
so this is a lot to take in.

00:04:19.143 --> 00:04:20.311
Kimono are cool and all,

00:04:20.395 --> 00:04:22.692
but you should give
Western clothes a shot.

00:04:22.984 --> 00:04:24.028
[SUZUNO]
Huh?

00:04:24.445 --> 00:04:26.449
You pull off
those vestments well.

00:04:27.242 --> 00:04:28.912
You don't say.

00:04:29.079 --> 00:04:31.417
Hm? Why'd ya get all weird?

00:04:31.501 --> 00:04:33.296
[SUZUNO]
I did not get "weird."

00:04:33.421 --> 00:04:35.300
But since my choice
of earthly apparel

00:04:35.383 --> 00:04:38.264
has been called into question,
I prefer kimono

00:04:38.347 --> 00:04:40.101
because they resemble
these church robes,

00:04:40.185 --> 00:04:41.228
in weight and length.

00:04:41.312 --> 00:04:42.355
[MAOU] Huh?

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:46.740
Hm... So, you believe
this garb suits me?

00:04:47.324 --> 00:04:48.952
Yeah, it does for sure!

00:04:49.244 --> 00:04:51.415
Also, I know
I don't rock a kimono.

00:04:52.167 --> 00:04:54.506
But Western clothes
are way more cost-effective.

00:04:54.631 --> 00:04:57.093
Think about it!
You chuck 'em in the wash!

00:04:57.845 --> 00:04:59.599
-[sighs] There we go!
-[Suzuno grunts]

00:04:59.724 --> 00:05:01.520
Uh, what's the problem now?

00:05:01.728 --> 00:05:02.980
They're easy to clean,
and I think

00:05:03.064 --> 00:05:04.066
they would look good on you!

00:05:04.149 --> 00:05:06.947
I shall not be swayed again!

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.990
[grunts]

00:05:09.201 --> 00:05:11.247

a long-ass field trip.

00:05:28.782 --> 00:05:29.784
Uh...

00:05:29.868 --> 00:05:31.328
Wassup? Uh...

00:05:34.711 --> 00:05:36.548
Guess we'll take
the scenic route.

00:05:36.798 --> 00:05:37.800
Right.

00:05:37.884 --> 00:05:39.929
[people cheering]

00:05:41.265 --> 00:05:43.645
Any specific reason
I have to wear this dumb armor?

00:05:44.354 --> 00:05:45.524
Do you hear that sound?

00:05:45.858 --> 00:05:47.987
The cries of hopeful masses.

00:05:49.908 --> 00:05:52.162
This nation
is in desperate need of a hero.

00:05:52.495 --> 00:05:54.626
Someone they can put
their faith behind

00:05:54.709 --> 00:05:56.086
to liberate Heavensky

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:58.216
and the imprisoned
Emperor Unifier.

00:05:58.299 --> 00:05:59.636
Uh...

00:06:00.804 --> 00:06:02.182
[OLBA]
Exciting, yes?

00:06:02.432 --> 00:06:04.979
The brave Hero Emilia's
second operation

00:06:05.063 --> 00:06:07.484
to retake Heavensky
is about to commence.

00:06:07.693 --> 00:06:08.779
Hm...

00:06:12.494 --> 00:06:14.248
-[crowd cheering]
-[CITIZEN 1]It's her! The Hero!

00:06:14.331 --> 00:06:15.584
[CITIZEN 1]
When I heard she was alive,

00:06:15.668 --> 00:06:16.920
I could hardly believe it!

00:06:17.003 --> 00:06:18.256
[CITIZEN 3]
She's going to save Efzahan,

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:19.676
and its people with it!

00:06:19.801 --> 00:06:22.222
[CITIZEN 4] Please,
free the emperor Unifier!

00:06:23.391 --> 00:06:25.186
Do you hear how they adore you?

00:06:25.562 --> 00:06:27.482
You've become a symbol
for their cause.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.570
Clinging to hope
is the only thing

00:06:29.654 --> 00:06:32.618
of which these moronic
Phaigan citizens are capable.

00:06:32.702 --> 00:06:34.121
In fact, that's
something they share

00:06:34.204 --> 00:06:35.874
with fools of the Malebranche.

00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.755
Who so firmly believed
they could avenge Satan.

00:06:39.047 --> 00:06:42.137
-Hold on. Have you..
-[Olba chuckles]

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.849
Speaking of our friends
the demons,

00:06:43.932 --> 00:06:46.312
you and I are about to hunt
down the fearsome few

00:06:46.395 --> 00:06:48.567
who have been
eating away at Efzahan.

00:06:49.443 --> 00:06:51.740
[MAOU]
Huh! But I don't wanna!

00:06:51.823 --> 00:06:53.034
[SUZUNO]
We have no choice.

00:06:53.117 --> 00:06:54.704
The closer
we get to the capital

00:06:54.787 --> 00:06:57.042
the more likely
we are to be found out.

00:06:57.459 --> 00:06:59.547
Their journey must end here.

00:07:00.048 --> 00:07:01.926
I was just starting
to master the art

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:04.347
of driving Turbo-Powered
Dullahan the Third!

00:07:04.599 --> 00:07:06.519
I'm glad
you're enjoying your scooter,

00:07:06.603 --> 00:07:08.189
but taking it any farther
could mean

00:07:08.272 --> 00:07:10.193
death for Emilia
and the others.

00:07:10.276 --> 00:07:11.780
[groans]

00:07:12.197 --> 00:07:14.869
Now seems like
an appropriate time to ask.

00:07:15.119 --> 00:07:18.292
Why do you name your modes
of transportation "Dullahan?"

00:07:18.375 --> 00:07:19.294
Huh?

00:07:19.377 --> 00:07:21.508
If I'm not mistaken,
Dullahans are demons

00:07:21.591 --> 00:07:23.553
from Earth's mythology,
correct?

00:07:23.929 --> 00:07:25.516
[MAOU]
Yeah, you know your trivia!

00:07:26.225 --> 00:07:27.978
Too bad we don't have
any Dullahans

00:07:28.062 --> 00:07:29.397
in the real demon realm.

00:07:29.899 --> 00:07:32.780
[SUZUNO] Precisely,
so why use the name?

00:07:32.863 --> 00:07:35.493
Eh, it's not crazy deep
or anything.

00:07:37.038 --> 00:07:38.667
But before I made it to MgR's

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.255
Ashiya and I got axed
from loads of jobs.

00:07:41.548 --> 00:07:42.382
[SUZUNO]
Go on.

00:07:42.758 --> 00:07:44.261
[MAOU] When everything
started to look up,

00:07:44.679 --> 00:07:47.225
I bought a bike
to commute to the new gig.

00:07:47.308 --> 00:07:48.603
It was a huge purchase.

00:07:48.687 --> 00:07:51.400
And it'd suck to get
axed again without any savings.

00:07:51.651 --> 00:07:52.820
'Twould indeed.

00:07:53.989 --> 00:07:54.991
Wait a moment.

00:07:55.366 --> 00:07:56.786
Sounds like you're onto it,

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:58.540
but it's always been
a good luck thing.

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:01.671
'Cause Dullahans
are headless demons, yeah?

00:08:01.754 --> 00:08:03.717
Well, if there's no head
to chop off,

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.178
it can't get the axe.

00:08:05.679 --> 00:08:07.098
That is ridiculous.

00:08:07.265 --> 00:08:09.520
Hey, watch it!
You brought it up, not me!

00:08:09.604 --> 00:08:10.689
[Suzuno giggles]

00:08:10.898 --> 00:08:13.485
I'd almost prefer you named it
after a supernatural beast

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:16.366
in a sad attempt to transplant
your Demon King life.

00:08:16.491 --> 00:08:18.747
[MAOU] Please, I'm way
less pathetic than that!

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:19.832
[Suzuno giggles]

00:08:19.916 --> 00:08:22.045
Your reasoning
is hilariously human!

00:08:22.462 --> 00:08:25.009
I'm so done with you!
I don't play with bullies.

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:26.512
[scoffs]

00:08:27.681 --> 00:08:29.267
So, Maou. Tell me.

00:08:29.936 --> 00:08:32.023
Why did your kind
come to Ente Isla?

00:08:32.148 --> 00:08:33.275
Huh?

00:08:33.985 --> 00:08:35.530
I was always
under the impression

00:08:35.614 --> 00:08:37.576
your goal was to rule
the five continents.

00:08:38.244 --> 00:08:40.958
Ruling and destroying
are not the same.

00:08:41.542 --> 00:08:42.753
Think of Efzahan.

00:08:43.045 --> 00:08:44.840
Alciel ruled it brilliantly.

00:08:47.387 --> 00:08:49.976
Good Chiho
is scarily perceptive at times.

00:08:50.351 --> 00:08:52.565
Well, that,
and she didn't come into this

00:08:52.648 --> 00:08:54.819
with any harsh preconceptions
about you.

00:08:55.361 --> 00:08:57.490
She quickly picked up
that you were a leader

00:08:57.574 --> 00:08:59.662
who wanted the best
for their people.

00:08:59.745 --> 00:09:02.585
Sure. But it's no secret
that I'm a king.

00:09:02.876 --> 00:09:04.129
What's your point here?

00:09:06.383 --> 00:09:08.470
-Hm.
-What the hell are you doing?

00:09:08.972 --> 00:09:11.393
You can confess.
As a clergy member,

00:09:11.476 --> 00:09:13.022
I can't disclose your secrets.

00:09:14.149 --> 00:09:17.155
And sitting like this,
you can't gauge my reactions.

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:19.242
No matter
what you confide in me

00:09:19.326 --> 00:09:21.121
I will not hold it against you.

00:09:21.204 --> 00:09:23.000
So, what was your goal?

00:09:23.083 --> 00:09:25.630
Why did you invade Ente Isla?

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:31.350
[MAOU]
When I was a little kid,

00:09:31.893 --> 00:09:34.147
the demon realm
was a shitty-ass place

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:36.527
governed by violence
and violence alone.

00:09:36.736 --> 00:09:38.280
I put together an army

00:09:38.364 --> 00:09:39.867
because I wanted
to change that.

00:09:40.994 --> 00:09:43.374
Thanks to demons
like Camio and Alciel

00:09:43.457 --> 00:09:45.211
we were able to craft
a new nation

00:09:45.294 --> 00:09:47.549
that was more advanced
than any before it.

00:09:47.633 --> 00:09:50.847
Demons didn't have to die
just because they were weak.

00:09:51.516 --> 00:09:54.354
But for all that good,
I made one big mistake.

00:09:54.437 --> 00:09:57.026
- Which was?
- I failed to take into account

00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:58.237
that demons get magic,

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.324
the energy
that they need to survive,

00:10:00.408 --> 00:10:02.453
from emotions
like fear and despair.

00:10:02.538 --> 00:10:05.836
My unification
brought order and peace.

00:10:05.919 --> 00:10:07.798
So, fear and despair lessened.

00:10:07.881 --> 00:10:09.510
And slowly disappeared.

00:10:09.885 --> 00:10:12.975
As a result, our magical
reserves began to decline.

00:10:13.475 --> 00:10:15.438
In hindsight,
it was inevitable.

00:10:15.522 --> 00:10:17.568
I had cut off their source.

00:10:19.446 --> 00:10:21.074
If I didn't do something fast,

00:10:21.158 --> 00:10:23.412
they would've all starved
because of me.

00:10:23.872 --> 00:10:26.586
So, attacking Ente Isla
was your last option.

00:10:26.836 --> 00:10:28.590
We plundered and colonized,

00:10:28.673 --> 00:10:32.013
all to restore a resource that
I had senselessly depleted.

00:10:33.056 --> 00:10:35.186
Pretty standard motivation
for a war, huh?

00:10:36.313 --> 00:10:37.356
[SUZUNO] Indeed.

00:10:37.524 --> 00:10:40.488
[MAOU] Wiping you guys out
wouldn't solve our problem.

00:10:40.906 --> 00:10:43.536
I figured the best solution
would be to rule mankind

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:45.247
with a decent amount of fear.

00:10:45.832 --> 00:10:47.043
I gave strict orders.

00:10:47.251 --> 00:10:50.174
Show no mercy,
but always accept a surrender.

00:10:50.466 --> 00:10:52.178
You know the story from there.

00:10:54.015 --> 00:10:56.729
Emi freed one continent
after the next.

00:10:56.979 --> 00:10:59.400
And I ran away
and ended up in Japan.

00:11:00.529 --> 00:11:03.993
Once we invaded Ente Isla,
I researched constantly.

00:11:04.327 --> 00:11:06.289
How could humans
create civilizations

00:11:06.414 --> 00:11:07.834
without killing each other?

00:11:08.085 --> 00:11:10.339
While I was here, I never
understood the difference

00:11:10.422 --> 00:11:12.093
between you guys and us.

00:11:13.428 --> 00:11:16.894
But three days in Japan,
and I knew exactly what it was.

00:11:17.395 --> 00:11:18.565
[SUZUNO] Well?

00:11:19.148 --> 00:11:22.071
[MAOU] You eat food,
and we don't. That's it.

00:11:22.739 --> 00:11:25.077
Demons can survive
on magic alone.

00:11:25.537 --> 00:11:26.914
But humans can't.

00:11:27.373 --> 00:11:29.002
No food, and they're toast.

00:11:29.294 --> 00:11:31.632
It drives the entire economy.

00:11:32.926 --> 00:11:34.304
It's no wonder the structures

00:11:34.387 --> 00:11:36.767
of their societies
are so different.

00:11:37.686 --> 00:11:40.692
I had to find a whole new world
to realize that simple fact.

00:11:41.026 --> 00:11:42.571
They believed in me.

00:11:42.738 --> 00:11:44.198
And because of my ignorance

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:46.161
I led them to their deaths.

00:11:46.621 --> 00:11:48.040
So, you were in a corner.

00:11:48.248 --> 00:11:50.377
It was the human world
versus the lives

00:11:50.503 --> 00:11:53.342
of the subjects that you vowed
to protect at any cost.

00:11:53.635 --> 00:11:55.805
[SUZUNO] That was your duty
as their king.

00:11:57.684 --> 00:12:01.024
What torments you now?
What sin keeps you awake?

00:12:02.151 --> 00:12:03.529
I betrayed them.

00:12:03.988 --> 00:12:07.036
My subjects trusted me,
and I killed them.

00:12:08.121 --> 00:12:11.044
All that to say,
I took the wrong path.

00:12:11.294 --> 00:12:12.798
How will you go forth?

00:12:13.256 --> 00:12:15.386
How will you repent
for your misgivings?

00:12:16.137 --> 00:12:18.935
Be king. And do
everything I can for them,

00:12:19.102 --> 00:12:20.772
until the day my time is up.

00:12:21.774 --> 00:12:22.901
A good answer.

00:12:23.026 --> 00:12:24.780
You wish to become a king
who rules demons

00:12:24.863 --> 00:12:26.742
and humans alike,
don't you?

00:12:28.161 --> 00:12:30.834
[MAOU] No reason holding back
in a confession, I suppose.

00:12:31.711 --> 00:12:34.382
Speaking of which, would
your God be willing to forgive

00:12:34.465 --> 00:12:35.719
the sins of a demon?

00:12:36.261 --> 00:12:37.471
The demon king's sins

00:12:37.556 --> 00:12:39.225
are considered
most unforgivable.

00:12:39.475 --> 00:12:40.979
By conventional wisdom.

00:12:41.229 --> 00:12:42.314
Well, that's lame!

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.570
Are we just killing time
with my trauma then?

00:12:45.279 --> 00:12:47.576
No. Now I can forgive you.

00:12:48.536 --> 00:12:49.580
You mean that?

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:52.168
[SUZUNO]
Satan, king of demons.

00:12:52.293 --> 00:12:54.338
I have heard
your humble confession.

00:12:54.882 --> 00:12:56.134
I have listened to your woes,

00:12:56.217 --> 00:12:58.430
and know that your words
of remorse come from the heart

00:12:58.514 --> 00:13:00.434
therefore,
I absolve you of your sins

00:13:00.518 --> 00:13:01.729
in the name of Crestia Bel.

00:13:02.021 --> 00:13:04.943
Regardless of whether God
or anyone else in this world

00:13:05.027 --> 00:13:06.488
would refuse to do so.

00:13:07.323 --> 00:13:10.496
Mm, I think that this Ente Isla
air is getting to you.

00:13:11.206 --> 00:13:12.500
Hm.

00:13:13.503 --> 00:13:15.380
Yes, perhaps it is.

00:13:17.301 --> 00:13:18.638
[clamoring]

00:13:18.805 --> 00:13:20.558

00:13:26.402 --> 00:13:27.614
-[MALE SOLDIER] Report!
-Hm?

00:13:27.697 --> 00:13:29.701
A battle is in progress
on the front lines

00:13:29.785 --> 00:13:31.329
between the
Inlaid Crimson Scarves

00:13:31.412 --> 00:13:32.958
and an unknown enemy leader!

00:13:33.751 --> 00:13:35.505
Understood. I'll join them.

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:37.676
-[OLBA] That's unnecessary.
-Huh?

00:13:39.555 --> 00:13:41.432
But I can end this,
here and now!

00:13:41.559 --> 00:13:42.853
Need I remind you,
you're the

00:13:42.936 --> 00:13:44.606
commander-in-chief
of this army?

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:46.234
You can no longer
have the privilege

00:13:46.317 --> 00:13:47.863
of acting so rashly.

00:13:48.029 --> 00:13:49.156
Hm.

00:13:50.158 --> 00:13:52.664
Then I'll use my new position
to declare this.

00:13:52.789 --> 00:13:54.877
We're going to invite
the Malebranche to surrender

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:55.837
before there's any more

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.799
needless loss of life
out there!

00:13:57.924 --> 00:14:00.262
Our objective is supposed
to be freeing cities,

00:14:00.387 --> 00:14:02.349
not senselessly
massacring the enemy.

00:14:02.474 --> 00:14:03.978
Are you suggesting for
a moment

00:14:04.061 --> 00:14:06.441
that we should allow
that demon scum to live?

00:14:06.817 --> 00:14:07.944
Well, I just..

-Hm?
-Huh?

00:14:11.367 --> 00:14:12.787
After a battle
with their leader,

00:14:12.954 --> 00:14:13.998
they've been routed!

00:14:14.081 --> 00:14:16.503
Finally,
Gwenvan City is free!

00:14:16.587 --> 00:14:18.173
-[all exclaiming]
-[MALE OFFICER] Incredible!

00:14:18.423 --> 00:14:19.467
[gasp]

00:14:20.762 --> 00:14:22.515
[GABRIEL] Well, Ashiya!

00:14:22.599 --> 00:14:25.521
Oops. I mean, well,
Demon General Alciel.

00:14:25.772 --> 00:14:27.859
What's it like to be back
in Heavensky?

00:14:28.026 --> 00:14:29.195
It's sickening.

00:14:30.197 --> 00:14:31.324
Now, explain.

00:14:31.742 --> 00:14:34.038
What role are you trying
to foist upon me?

00:14:34.246 --> 00:14:35.248
Don't worry!

00:14:35.332 --> 00:14:38.004
Your new job's gonna be
a walk in the park, friendo.

00:14:38.673 --> 00:14:41.679
Just sit back, relax,
and kick it on that throne.

00:14:42.096 --> 00:14:43.891
The rest of it
will take care of itself.

00:14:44.225 --> 00:14:45.227
I see now.

00:14:45.477 --> 00:14:48.191
You brought me here so you
can say, "Alciel has returned."

00:14:48.274 --> 00:14:49.318
[GABRIEL]
What...?

00:14:49.861 --> 00:14:51.657
Of course,
I'd be your first choice.

00:14:51.782 --> 00:14:54.245
I'm the only general
that remains undefeated.

00:14:54.705 --> 00:14:56.542
Our old players
have all returned.

00:14:56.875 --> 00:14:59.296
And the angels want Emilia
to defeat the demon army

on some grand stage.

00:15:01.009 --> 00:15:02.386
Correctomundo!

00:15:02.512 --> 00:15:04.181
And here I thought
you were just a cheapskate

00:15:04.265 --> 00:15:06.477
that digs around for the big
eggs at the grocery store.

00:15:06.645 --> 00:15:08.148
Ah! You pest!

00:15:08.231 --> 00:15:10.737
How dare you spy on me
at my most vulnerable hour!

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:12.489
Ah, you're no fun.

00:15:13.074 --> 00:15:14.578
Heaven's surely driving this.

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:17.625
No doubt your people cajoled
Olba and the demons.

00:15:18.376 --> 00:15:19.546
What is it you're after?

00:15:20.005 --> 00:15:21.049
[sighs]

00:15:23.261 --> 00:15:25.808
Saving Heaven is the name
of the game these days.

00:15:26.184 --> 00:15:27.478
-Excuse me?
-Hey.

00:15:27.562 --> 00:15:30.067
I'm only gonna ask you
for one tiny, little thing.

00:15:30.317 --> 00:15:31.653
When Emilia shows up,

00:15:31.737 --> 00:15:34.241
keep fighting for as long
as you can hold out.

00:15:35.077 --> 00:15:36.454
[EMI]
One less demon.

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:39.544
One less enemy of mankind
in the world, right?

00:15:40.546 --> 00:15:42.257
He was the enemy.

00:15:43.218 --> 00:15:44.220
Always has been.

00:15:44.638 --> 00:15:47.017
It's us, or them.

00:15:47.476 --> 00:15:49.313
So why is this so hard?

00:15:49.731 --> 00:15:50.775
Mama?

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:52.486
[sobbing]

00:15:53.864 --> 00:15:55.492
[birds chirping]

00:15:56.912 --> 00:15:58.414
Huh... [gasps]

00:15:59.375 --> 00:16:00.545
Wha...?

00:16:01.839 --> 00:16:02.924
[whispering] Stay quiet.

00:16:06.472 --> 00:16:07.767
Somebody found our camp.

00:16:08.184 --> 00:16:09.186
Mm...

00:16:11.023 --> 00:16:12.109
A foe?

00:16:12.192 --> 00:16:14.071
As much as a friend
would be my preference,

00:16:14.155 --> 00:16:15.490
I'm thinking you're right.

00:16:16.577 --> 00:16:17.912
[ALBERT]
I know this one.

00:16:17.996 --> 00:16:19.833
I believe
it's called a scooter.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.210
[both gasp]

00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:23.256
You aren't as quiet
as you think.

00:16:23.549 --> 00:16:25.468
Is it the Devil? Alciel?

00:16:25.803 --> 00:16:27.724
Lucifer, or the Sasaki girl?

00:16:28.517 --> 00:16:30.980
Or could it be Crestia Bel?
[gasps]

00:16:31.063 --> 00:16:33.611
Well, would ya listen to that.
It's no enemy.

00:16:34.946 --> 00:16:37.159
I assume this meeting
isn't a coincidence.

00:16:37.492 --> 00:16:39.831
Is it now, Albert Ende?

00:16:40.708 --> 00:16:44.381
No. What is that?
New species of demon?

00:16:44.507 --> 00:16:46.302
Take that back at once, wretch!

00:16:48.974 --> 00:16:49.976
[Barbariccia grunts]

00:16:50.143 --> 00:16:53.651
Where'd that coward Olba go?
He must be to blame!

00:16:54.068 --> 00:16:57.324
See? I knew we should have
followed His Majesty's orders.

00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:59.453
That hardly helps now!
Hm?

00:17:00.163 --> 00:17:01.374
[BARBARICCIA] General Alciel!

00:17:02.292 --> 00:17:04.714
I need someone
to catch me up to speed.

00:17:05.549 --> 00:17:07.302
There have been rumors
going around about

00:17:07.386 --> 00:17:09.265
people in church robes
roaming the forest

00:17:09.348 --> 00:17:11.060
on rather curious wagons.

00:17:11.853 --> 00:17:13.064
A lucky break.

00:17:13.816 --> 00:17:16.028
Guess that means we weren't
as sneaky as we thought.

00:17:16.445 --> 00:17:17.364
[ALBERT]
You were fine.

00:17:17.447 --> 00:17:18.449
There are millions of rumors

00:17:18.534 --> 00:17:20.287
floating around
Efzahan right now.

00:17:20.579 --> 00:17:22.834
Yours isn't very popular,
I just had a hunch.

00:17:23.084 --> 00:17:25.463
Let me guess.
Here to rescue Emilia?

00:17:25.798 --> 00:17:27.050
[SUZUNO]
Indeed, we are.

00:17:27.467 --> 00:17:30.015
Are you privy to good
Emerada's whereabouts?

00:17:30.432 --> 00:17:32.895
I tried sending an idea link,
but heard nothing.

00:17:33.187 --> 00:17:34.231
I'm quite concerned.

00:17:34.733 --> 00:17:35.735
Should be.

00:17:36.485 --> 00:17:38.991
She was supposed to meet
with Emilia a while back.

00:17:39.283 --> 00:17:42.540
But then, she got a summons
from Saint Aire's capital.

00:17:42.832 --> 00:17:43.834
[SUZUNO] Huh?

00:17:44.251 --> 00:17:45.963
[ALBERT] Must've been a move
by the church.

00:17:46.255 --> 00:17:49.554
They branded Emerada an
apostate who defied their will.

00:17:50.347 --> 00:17:53.144
All in attempt to cover up
Olba's crimes.

00:17:54.396 --> 00:17:57.069
Word is, she has to appear
before the Inquisition.

00:17:57.444 --> 00:17:59.448
So, they've gone over my head.

00:17:59.574 --> 00:18:01.202
[ALBERT]
Her position is quite valuable.

00:18:01.662 --> 00:18:04.458
It secures Emilia's safety
as well as my own.

00:18:04.959 --> 00:18:07.130
I took a trip
to Emilia's village.

00:18:07.214 --> 00:18:08.550
No one was there.

00:18:08.884 --> 00:18:12.307
I tried to check on Emerada,
but they wouldn't let me in.

00:18:12.683 --> 00:18:14.771
They said it's to prevent her
from any wrongdoing

00:18:14.854 --> 00:18:16.023
during the trial.

00:18:16.107 --> 00:18:18.904
That must be why she didn't
respond to my idea links.

00:18:19.238 --> 00:18:21.409
If she had been caught
trying to contact you,

00:18:21.993 --> 00:18:23.706
you would be
in a world of trouble.

00:18:24.164 --> 00:18:27.588
Hm. C'mon, Albert.
Join forces with us.

00:18:28.047 --> 00:18:30.719
Rescuing Emi won't be enough
to settle this.

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:33.642
[ASHIYA]
Understood.

00:18:33.934 --> 00:18:35.521
So, in less flattering words,

00:18:35.604 --> 00:18:38.735
you let Olba and some Heavenly
vermin pull one over on you.

00:18:39.027 --> 00:18:41.157
And you failed to take
the Devil's Castle.

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:43.202
It seems all you have done
is sacrifice

00:18:43.286 --> 00:18:44.622
demon lives in vain.

00:18:44.706 --> 00:18:46.167
Does that sound correct?

00:18:47.043 --> 00:18:49.089
Yes, sir,
and I make no excuse.

00:18:49.339 --> 00:18:51.928
-What you must understand is...
-Silence, you imbecile!

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:53.431
-And accept your mistake!
-[both gasp]

00:18:53.599 --> 00:18:56.103
I, for one, will not
fault you for raising an army.

00:18:56.353 --> 00:18:58.692
But why, when you were
given specific orders

00:18:58.775 --> 00:19:01.990
from His Majesty, did you
buffoons choose to ignore them?

00:19:03.284 --> 00:19:05.413
King Satan gave you
clear instruction

00:19:05.497 --> 00:19:07.292
to return to the demon realm.

00:19:07.417 --> 00:19:10.048
I'm ashamed of myself, sir.
Truly.

00:19:10.256 --> 00:19:12.595
But if we would've gotten our
hands on the sacred sword,

00:19:12.678 --> 00:19:14.264
none of this
would have happened!

00:19:14.516 --> 00:19:15.851
The sacred sword?

00:19:16.268 --> 00:19:18.397
If you mean
Emilia's Better Half,

00:19:18.481 --> 00:19:21.780
it is a holy being born
of the sephirah called Yesod.

00:19:22.197 --> 00:19:24.619
As demons,
we have no celestial force.

00:19:24.953 --> 00:19:26.706
-Therefore, it would
be powerless in our.. -No.

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:28.919
Now, excuse me, General,
but you're wrong.

00:19:29.169 --> 00:19:30.421
That's not the case.

00:19:30.756 --> 00:19:31.925
[ASHIYA]
Pardon?

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:33.302
When he was on Earth, you saw

00:19:33.386 --> 00:19:36.225
Farfa utilize
that boy Erone, didn't you?

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:37.770
That proves my point.

00:19:37.854 --> 00:19:39.732
A sephirah's power
is not restricted

00:19:39.816 --> 00:19:41.402
to only humans and angels.

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:45.159
Is that a...
Huh!

00:19:45.285 --> 00:19:48.917
As you see, it responds
strongly to our magic as well.

00:19:49.919 --> 00:19:53.259
But that means,
the sephiroth. The sword.

00:19:53.384 --> 00:19:55.931
Not one of them is holy!
[gasps]

00:19:56.223 --> 00:19:57.643
I came here with someone.

00:19:57.768 --> 00:20:00.106
Where is the man
known as Nord Justina?

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:02.110
We were given orders
to lock him away

00:20:02.235 --> 00:20:03.864
in a room in Heavensky.

00:20:04.448 --> 00:20:06.953
You saw him? Was he armed
with a sacred sword?

00:20:07.037 --> 00:20:09.542
-Mm...
-No, he was not, sir.

00:20:09.667 --> 00:20:12.757
Hm. While I still don't see
his objective,

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:15.428
I'm starting to piece
together Gabriel's puzzle.

00:20:15.763 --> 00:20:17.808
-[BARBARICCIA] Sir?
-How pathetic.

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:19.646
A great demon general,

00:20:19.729 --> 00:20:22.317
being forced to dance
to that lunatic's tune.

00:20:26.743 --> 00:20:28.538
I've waited two thousand years.

00:20:28.664 --> 00:20:29.958
You better bust a move,

00:20:30.166 --> 00:20:32.170
if we want the new
Great Devil born.

00:20:32.838 --> 00:20:35.636
This may well be the last
chance we've got.

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:37.765
What do you say?

00:20:37.848 --> 00:20:39.560
Let's mess with their plans
like those jerks

00:20:39.644 --> 00:20:42.273
messed with our friends!
Give 'em a good spankin'!

00:20:42.399 --> 00:20:44.570
All that sounds like
a pretty good time.

00:20:44.654 --> 00:20:46.533
But first, is that
the little girl

00:20:46.616 --> 00:20:48.411
who fused with Emilia's sword?

00:20:49.121 --> 00:20:52.002
[MAOU] Actually, no.
Alas Ramus is still with Emi.

00:20:52.962 --> 00:20:54.674
They're pretty similar, though.

00:20:54.757 --> 00:20:57.137
She's got her own sacred
sword thing going on.

00:20:57.763 --> 00:20:59.057
You can see for yourself.

00:20:59.809 --> 00:21:01.688
Acieth, go back to sword form.

00:21:01.771 --> 00:21:03.900
Uh... Okie-dokie.

00:21:04.026 --> 00:21:06.321
But it might not
go the best-est, 'cause I kinda

00:21:06.405 --> 00:21:07.616
don't feel super great.

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:08.785
I'm sorry.

00:21:08.869 --> 00:21:11.415
It's whatever,
I'll give it a shot anyway!

00:21:11.498 --> 00:21:13.795
[chiming]

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:17.218
[grunts]

00:21:17.678 --> 00:21:18.889
Huh?

00:21:21.185 --> 00:21:23.899
Can't say this is what
I expected from a sacred sword.

00:21:24.107 --> 00:21:26.320
Is something the matter
in there, Acieth?

00:21:26.403 --> 00:21:27.531
[TSUBASA]
Yeah, kinda.

00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:30.954
It feels like he's refusing
to let me use my power.

00:21:31.288 --> 00:21:32.750
Hold on, who's he?

00:21:33.334 --> 00:21:35.046
[TSUBASA]
You, stupid goose.

00:21:35.129 --> 00:21:36.758
What the hell do you mean me?

00:21:37.258 --> 00:21:40.014
I'm the one who told you to go
sword mode, so why...

00:21:40.348 --> 00:21:42.352
[grunts]
Crap.

00:21:42.728 --> 00:21:44.356
-Hm?
-Hm?

00:21:44.774 --> 00:21:47.111
[Maou retching]

00:21:47.487 --> 00:21:48.698
I don't know what's going on,

00:21:48.782 --> 00:21:51.161
but this means using the sword
is off the table, right?

00:21:51.579 --> 00:21:53.207
Unfortunately, I think so.

00:21:53.542 --> 00:21:55.587
Something isn't
sitting right with me.

00:21:56.296 --> 00:21:57.382
Huh?

00:21:58.467 --> 00:22:00.388
Agh, I don't understand
why everything

00:22:00.471 --> 00:22:01.975
is going haywire now!

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:04.814
It's been smooth sailing
up until this B.S.!

00:22:05.189 --> 00:22:07.695
Maou.
Don't you find this odd?

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:08.989
Find what odd?

00:22:10.701 --> 00:22:12.538
That we're back in Ente Isla.

00:22:13.623 --> 00:22:16.336
And you've yet to return
to your demon form.
