00:00:16.308 --> 00:00:20.395
On the register alone,
we racked up 350 thousand yen!

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:21.980
That's not counting everything.

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:25.692
We've still got snowcones, to-go
orders, and shower rentals.

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:28.403
We might just
break 500 thousand!

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:29.821
New record!

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:31.448
If the ladies
hadn't swooped in,

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.700
you'd be telling
a different story.

00:00:33.742 --> 00:00:35.827
We should reevaluate
our game plan.

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:37.287
Quit being such a buzzkill,

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:39.831
and get excited about the
bonus I'm gonna give ya!

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:41.333
Uh, hey, wait!

--Huh?
--Huh?

The one who swallowed up

00:00:48.257 --> 00:00:51.760
my soldiers in a
mighty dragon's roar...

00:00:51.802 --> 00:00:53.554
...was her.

Don't tell Amane."

We're going out tonight,

[URUSHIHARA]
Fun fact. This place has

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.831
one of the five active
first-order lenses in Japan.

00:02:44.873 --> 00:02:45.999
[ASHIYA]
A fun fact indeed,

00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:49.878
but I haven't the faintest idea
if that's impressive or not.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.754
[URUSHIHARA]
Huh?

00:02:50.796 --> 00:02:53.757
You came alone?
Where are the others?

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:55.550
I explained
the situation to Bel

00:02:55.592 --> 00:02:57.886
and asked her to
hang back with Chiho.

00:02:57.928 --> 00:02:59.388
[MAOU]
And Alas Ramus?

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:00.764
Here, duh.

00:03:00.806 --> 00:03:03.392
Hold up. Are you, like,
trying to duel me?

00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:05.852
While that sounds like
a blast, that's not it.

00:03:05.894 --> 00:03:08.438
Tell them what
you told me, bird.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.734
Tweet. Not long ago,
something odd occurred, tweet.

00:03:12.776 --> 00:03:15.570
I was in Satanas Arc
when a visitor arrived.

00:03:15.612 --> 00:03:18.740
A peculiar human who dropped in
and requested my presence.

00:03:18.782 --> 00:03:20.075
[URUSHIHARA]
A human in the realm?

00:03:20.117 --> 00:03:20.992
[CAMIO]
Hmm?

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:23.537
He told me and the others
of a "sacred sword."

00:03:23.578 --> 00:03:26.873
Whoever possessed it would
reign supreme over our realm,

00:03:26.915 --> 00:03:29.000
Heaven, and Ente Isla, tweet.

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:30.877
The surviving zealots
you left behind

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:33.338
were easily deceived
by his honeyed words.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.425
They sought the power of the
sword to avenge you, tweet.

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:38.009
A lot changed when you left.

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:41.179
The realm was split into
pacifists and zealots.

00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:44.307
Camio told me his wings were
full just keeping the peace.

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:45.434
Tweet.

00:03:45.475 --> 00:03:48.103
The human came and
destroyed the balance.

00:03:48.145 --> 00:03:51.773
It gets worse.
He said there were two swords.

00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:54.985
One of which is, who could've
guessed it, "Better Half."

00:03:55.026 --> 00:03:57.362
There aren't many humans out
there who know my sword,

00:03:57.404 --> 00:03:59.614
and even fewer
who know it's in Japan.

00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:00.490
Right.

00:04:00.532 --> 00:04:02.117
That man took
the zealots with him

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:04.327
and vanished from
the realm, tweet.

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:07.497
He went by the name
Olba Meyer, tweet.

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:10.000
I called it;
that geezer can't sit still.

00:04:10.041 --> 00:04:13.044
We made a grave mistake
by showing him mercy.

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:16.715
Now, Chancellor, who has taken
leadership of the zealots?

00:04:16.757 --> 00:04:19.342
It's Barbariccia,
marked aide to Malacoda.

00:04:19.384 --> 00:04:21.470
Demon General of
the South, tweet, tweet.

00:04:21.511 --> 00:04:22.679
Dude!

00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:24.431
Cut it out.
The tweets are killing me.

00:04:24.473 --> 00:04:27.851
You sound like a PokÃ©ture!
And why are we out here?

00:04:27.893 --> 00:04:30.896
We could've skipped the hike
and talked back at Ohguro's.

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:34.649
Did you forget? If Amane could
thrash Camio and his crew,

00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:37.277
no chance she's
a normal human.

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:40.530
I'd be hesitant to tip her off
on what's about to go down.

00:04:40.572 --> 00:04:41.907
And what might that be?

00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:44.075
My original goal in
coming to this place

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:46.077
was to get my talons
on the sacred sword

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:48.872
before Barbariccia
and his men were able, tweet.

00:04:48.914 --> 00:04:51.708
Olba told us the sword
was in a far off world,

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.003
a land of treachery
known as "Tokyo," tweet.

00:04:55.045 --> 00:04:57.672
So, it's a coincidence
you're in Choshi?

00:04:57.714 --> 00:05:00.342
[CAMIO] On the contrary,
it's far from it, tweet.

00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:02.427
Before he disappeared,
Olba left us

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:05.639
with what he said was a clue
to lead us to the sword.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.642
When we used it,
it led us straight here.

00:05:08.683 --> 00:05:11.770
Seems this "clue"
reacted to Yesod, huh?

00:05:11.812 --> 00:05:14.356
[EMI] Mm. Apparently,
there's a large unit of zealots

00:05:14.397 --> 00:05:16.191
on their way to Japan right now.

00:05:16.233 --> 00:05:18.443
Well, maybe you
should've led with that!

00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:21.238
Tweet! If my
intelligence is correct,

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:24.074
they will arrive
tonight at midnight!

00:05:24.115 --> 00:05:25.909
I'd usually be more concerned,

00:05:25.951 --> 00:05:27.828
but the strength of the
woman you call "Amane"

00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:29.913
is extraordinary, tweet.

00:05:29.955 --> 00:05:31.706
The zealots are a force
to be reckoned with,

00:05:31.748 --> 00:05:32.916
but up against her,

00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.377
they'll be squashed
the same as my men.

00:05:35.418 --> 00:05:36.670
I couldn't care
less what happens

00:05:36.711 --> 00:05:38.964
to that bunch of demon trash.

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:42.509
That said, if Olba's involved,
then I am, too.

00:05:42.551 --> 00:05:44.302
We brought our war
into this world.

00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:46.638
It's our responsibility.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.682
I don't care how
powerful Amane is.

00:05:48.723 --> 00:05:51.268
She can't fix this for us.

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:53.436
It seems like
they're on our side.

00:05:53.478 --> 00:05:55.605
Both Amane and her aunt.

00:05:55.647 --> 00:05:59.025
I'm sorta amazed you're
going along with this, Emi.

00:05:59.067 --> 00:06:01.278
Please, it isn't
like I trust you.

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:04.197
But I'm fairly sure all
the Camio stuff is true.

00:06:04.239 --> 00:06:06.783
You said it in front of
Chiho and Alas Ramus.

00:06:06.825 --> 00:06:08.034
So what?

00:06:08.076 --> 00:06:09.536
I don't think you're honest,

00:06:09.578 --> 00:06:10.537
but I hope you wouldn't lie

00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:12.122
to the two people
willing to be there

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:14.583
for your broke ass
unconditionally.

00:06:14.624 --> 00:06:16.376
I'll do this thing with you.

00:06:16.418 --> 00:06:18.253
Let's take responsibility!

00:06:18.295 --> 00:06:23.216
Uh. Hush, I'm as honest as
Ashiya is anal-retentive.

00:06:23.258 --> 00:06:24.759
But whatever.

00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:26.177
Glad you're in.

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:29.264
Uh! This doesn't mean
that I won't kill you!

00:06:29.306 --> 00:06:30.724
[ALAS RAMUS]
Dada, I'm in, too!

00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:32.267
I'll beat 'em!

00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:33.935
[MAOU]
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

00:06:33.977 --> 00:06:36.187
Don't make my girl
work too hard.

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:38.732
So, I'm glad that teamwork
is making the dream work.

00:06:38.773 --> 00:06:41.568
But I'm not sure that we'll be
able to take these guys.

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.361
But wait, Your Majestweet.

00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:46.573
I have something that
might be of assistance, tweet.

00:06:46.615 --> 00:06:48.033
The sword I brought with me.

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:49.117
It's actually--

00:06:52.662 --> 00:06:54.664
That must be them.

00:06:54.706 --> 00:06:56.917
I'll use Second Sight!

00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.877
Camio was on the money.

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:02.130
I don't see Barbariccia
up there with them,

00:07:02.172 --> 00:07:04.132
but no doubt that's
the Malebranche,

00:07:04.174 --> 00:07:05.759
Malacoda's soldiers.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.177
'Bout a thousand of 'em.

00:07:07.218 --> 00:07:08.845
Let's see it up close!

00:07:10.472 --> 00:07:12.057
Wanna help mamma
take out the trash?

00:07:12.098 --> 00:07:13.141

00:07:15.143 --> 00:07:16.811
Hey. Camio.

00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:18.313
Where's that sword, now?

00:07:18.355 --> 00:07:19.147
[CAMIO]
Tweet?

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:21.191
Oh, but of course, the sword!

00:07:21.232 --> 00:07:23.318
Thankfully I had the
foresight t-to bring it with me,

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.946
so it's right here

00:07:25.987 --> 00:07:27.155
Huh?

00:07:27.197 --> 00:07:29.866
And I just told everyone
how smart you are.

--[CAMIO] Tweet...
--[MAOU] It's okay.

O-Of course, Sire!

00:07:34.621 --> 00:07:36.164
Ahh!

00:07:36.206 --> 00:07:39.167
Buyer's remorse, hoisted by
my own impulsive purchase!

00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:42.420
Huh? Amane?

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:45.548
Here's this.
Thought I'd save you the run.

00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:49.177
[AMANE]
Don't ask me why I'm here.

00:07:49.219 --> 00:07:51.805
I'm not in the mood
to get interrogated.

00:07:51.846 --> 00:07:53.807
We need to focus
on what's important,

00:07:53.848 --> 00:07:57.978
so just tell me what you're
planning to do with the sword.

00:07:58.019 --> 00:08:00.689
That was an awesome
opportunity for a speech!

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:04.067
Way to blow it, Maou.

00:08:04.109 --> 00:08:06.194
I've only spent
two days with you,

00:08:06.236 --> 00:08:09.155
but I think I have a handle on
what kind of people you are.

00:08:09.197 --> 00:08:10.657
Do not let me down!

00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:13.243
Show me how you're
gonna clean up this mess!

00:08:19.082 --> 00:08:21.376
[AMANE]
Take some ownership, devil.

00:08:28.842 --> 00:08:32.012
Do you really think what
Miss Yusa told us was true?

00:08:32.053 --> 00:08:33.430
I'm unsure.

00:08:33.471 --> 00:08:36.975
As of this moment,
I don't sense much magic.

00:08:37.017 --> 00:08:40.478
[AMANE] Hate to burst
your bubble, but it's true.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.814
You can let your guard down.

00:08:42.856 --> 00:08:46.568
I assure you,
I'm not your enemy.

00:08:46.609 --> 00:08:50.405
They say they're gonna take
care of this, so I'll let them.

00:08:50.447 --> 00:08:54.159
Don't worry, if something
goes wrong, I'll step in.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.037
Don't underestimate me, human.

00:08:57.078 --> 00:09:01.082
In case you didn't know,
Ohguro means great darkness.

00:09:01.124 --> 00:09:04.878
I could wipe out everyone who
doesn't belong in this world.

00:09:04.919 --> 00:09:08.673
I'd have no issue blasting them
beyond the veil of light!

00:09:11.051 --> 00:09:12.260
[AMANE]
So just stay here

00:09:12.302 --> 00:09:14.596
and wait for your
friends to get back.

00:09:14.637 --> 00:09:16.222
What about you?

00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:18.266
Well, I think I should
probably head over

00:09:18.308 --> 00:09:21.227
and see what Maou and
the bird are up to.

00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:23.146
See you gals later!

00:09:26.816 --> 00:09:28.902
[yells]

00:09:28.943 --> 00:09:31.404
Attack the enemy!

00:09:31.446 --> 00:09:33.531
[ALAS RAMUS]
Looks like chopsticks!

00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:35.575
We're the rice!

00:09:41.915 --> 00:09:44.167
Shockwave of Light!

00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:47.420
[ALAS RAMUS]
Mama! You okay?

00:09:47.462 --> 00:09:49.964
[EMI]
Yup. Aerial Flash!

00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:54.886
Aerial Volley!

00:09:57.097 --> 00:09:59.933
It'd be easier to just kill
these uggos.

00:09:59.974 --> 00:10:01.434
[CIRIATTO]
Make way.

00:10:03.353 --> 00:10:06.981
[CIRIATTO]
Impressive skills, human girl.

00:10:07.023 --> 00:10:09.400
How odd. Are you--?

00:10:11.528 --> 00:10:12.362
Her sword!

00:10:12.403 --> 00:10:14.197
[ALAS RAMUS]
Mama! More Yesod!

00:10:14.239 --> 00:10:16.199
Yesod is in the shiny!

00:10:16.241 --> 00:10:20.745
[laughs] You made this too
easy for us, Hero!

00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:21.871
It's you!

00:10:21.913 --> 00:10:25.041
Hello, Emilia Justina,
holder of the sacred sword,

00:10:25.083 --> 00:10:26.626
my name is Ciriatto.

00:10:26.668 --> 00:10:29.254
I am one of the leaders
of the Malebranche.

00:10:29.295 --> 00:10:32.215
If your power truly exceeds
the Demon King Satan

00:10:32.257 --> 00:10:33.800
and his four generals,

00:10:33.842 --> 00:10:37.262
then I've no choice but hit you
with everything I've got!

00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:38.888
And once I defeat you,

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:42.350
the sacred sword
will finally be mine!

00:10:42.392 --> 00:10:44.227
If you withdraw
your forces now,

00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:46.896
there will be no
need to hurt you.

00:10:46.938 --> 00:10:49.065
The sword's blade is
evolving for the first time

00:10:49.107 --> 00:10:50.692
since I arrived here.

00:10:50.733 --> 00:10:53.945
You can bet this
baby's gonna hurt!

00:10:53.987 --> 00:10:55.697
That sword terrorized our men.

00:10:55.738 --> 00:10:56.531
I'll make it mine

00:10:56.573 --> 00:10:59.868
and use it for the good of
the New Demon King's Army!

00:10:59.909 --> 00:11:02.954
She's mine, leave her to me!

00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:05.290
I won't be able to hold back.

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:07.250
That's fine by me.

00:11:07.292 --> 00:11:08.459
Die!

00:11:12.922 --> 00:11:14.924
Still want to fight?

00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:19.554
Ah... It'll take more
than that to scare me!

00:11:19.596 --> 00:11:21.014
I'd rather skin
you to the bone

00:11:21.055 --> 00:11:23.725
than take the easy route
of killing you.

00:11:23.766 --> 00:11:25.643
[ALAS RAMUS]
Huh? No big sword time?

00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:28.521
Sorry, kid, but we need
to even the playing field.

00:11:28.563 --> 00:11:30.523
This way I won't destroy him.

00:11:30.565 --> 00:11:33.359
Ahh... Don't be gentle!

00:11:33.401 --> 00:11:35.904
[EMI] Even if I can
avoid killing Ciriatto,

00:11:35.945 --> 00:11:38.781
I don't know if his troops
will stop fighting.

00:11:38.823 --> 00:11:41.784
If they don't,
I'll have to kill all of them.

00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:47.040
Just listen to yourself,
Emi, you've gone soft.

00:11:50.418 --> 00:11:54.380
[MAOU] Ciriatto, I need you
to explain something to me.

00:11:54.422 --> 00:11:57.175
What is this
"New Demon King's Army?"

00:11:57.217 --> 00:11:59.010
Huh? The hell are you?

00:11:59.052 --> 00:12:02.430
[ASHIYA] How dare a lowly chief
address us in such a manner?

00:12:02.472 --> 00:12:04.098
Did you seriously think
we were gonna let you

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:07.310
screw up our whole vacation
without saying anything?

00:12:07.352 --> 00:12:09.479
Nice of you to finally show up!

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.231
Yeah, sorry.

00:12:11.272 --> 00:12:14.442
It's been a hot minute
since I last transformed.

00:12:14.484 --> 00:12:15.401
[CIRIATTO]
Who are you?

00:12:15.443 --> 00:12:16.653
Tell me!

00:12:16.694 --> 00:12:18.446
[ASHIYA]
Behave yourselves, Malebranche!

00:12:18.488 --> 00:12:21.950
Look before you and realize
whose presence you're in!

00:12:22.617 --> 00:12:23.660
Stop now.

00:12:23.701 --> 00:12:25.620
Would you let a
human's words deceive you

00:12:25.662 --> 00:12:27.664
into attacking your own master?

00:12:27.705 --> 00:12:30.375
Master? Seriously?

00:12:30.416 --> 00:12:32.293
Warriors of the Malebranche!

00:12:32.335 --> 00:12:34.504
You're in the presence
of King Satan!

00:12:34.545 --> 00:12:36.172
Bow down!

00:12:36.214 --> 00:12:37.423
Hear ye, hear ye!

00:12:37.465 --> 00:12:39.676
Did he just say King Satan?

00:12:39.717 --> 00:12:42.345
Like, the real King Satan?

00:12:42.387 --> 00:12:44.555
And there's Alciel,
General of the East.

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:46.933
And there's Chancellor Camio!

00:12:46.975 --> 00:12:48.351
And Lucifer!

00:12:48.393 --> 00:12:50.353
No cool title for me?

00:12:50.395 --> 00:12:52.355
Fallen General Lucifer!

00:12:52.397 --> 00:12:55.608
You guys need to come up with
something better, and quick!

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:57.694
Or you'll be "fallen"
on these hands!

00:12:57.735 --> 00:12:59.696
[CIRIATTO]
I apologize for my rudeness!

00:12:59.737 --> 00:13:00.989
Funny.

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:03.950
I don't recall putting
anyone but Camio in charge

00:13:03.992 --> 00:13:06.661
of the realm during my absence.

00:13:06.703 --> 00:13:08.955
If you have an excuse,
let's hear it.

00:13:08.997 --> 00:13:10.331
[CIRIATTO]
Though we acted out, Sire,

00:13:10.373 --> 00:13:11.874
everything the
Malebranche has done

00:13:11.916 --> 00:13:14.294
has been to keep the realm safe.

00:13:14.335 --> 00:13:16.045
We needed to get
the sacred sword

00:13:16.087 --> 00:13:19.340
before it fell into
the hands of an enemy!

00:13:19.382 --> 00:13:21.217
You've "kept the realm safe"?

00:13:21.259 --> 00:13:22.051
[CIRIATTO]
Yes.

00:13:22.093 --> 00:13:24.512
Barbariccia pretended
to be deceived by the human

00:13:24.554 --> 00:13:27.598
so that we could gain access
to the sword's location.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:28.975
What utter foolishness.

00:13:29.017 --> 00:13:32.186
If that were true, you could've
sought approval from Camio.

00:13:32.228 --> 00:13:34.647
--[CIRIATTO] Oh...
--[MAOU] Good point, Alciel.

00:13:34.689 --> 00:13:37.066
[CIRIATTO]
I apologize, Your Majesty.

00:13:37.108 --> 00:13:41.279
Ciriatto, may I take
a look at that pendant?

00:13:44.032 --> 00:13:46.075
It's a Link Crystal.

00:13:46.117 --> 00:13:48.494
All that light was coming
from this little thing?

00:13:48.536 --> 00:13:49.954
For what purpose?

00:13:49.996 --> 00:13:52.081
All we were told is
that if we follow the light,

00:13:52.123 --> 00:13:54.083
we should come upon the sword.

00:13:54.125 --> 00:13:57.920
But if it's linked to a specific
location, I have no clue.

00:13:57.962 --> 00:13:59.505
Are you able to use
the Gate from which

00:13:59.547 --> 00:14:02.008
you came to take you
back to the realm?

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:04.218
The Gate?

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.971
You see, I would
like to send you back.

00:14:07.013 --> 00:14:08.222
But I'm worried.

00:14:08.264 --> 00:14:09.515
If you return empty-handed,

00:14:09.557 --> 00:14:11.809
you'll be punished
for your failure.

00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:12.769
Huh?

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:14.479
You mean that you'll--?

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:15.772
[URUSHIHARA]
Chill out.

00:14:15.813 --> 00:14:17.315
King Satan is about to hit you

00:14:17.357 --> 00:14:19.400
with a "get out
of jail free" card.

00:14:19.442 --> 00:14:20.526
Precisely.

00:14:20.568 --> 00:14:23.946
But I am going to send you
all back where you belong.

00:14:23.988 --> 00:14:25.156
It's a long trip.

00:14:25.198 --> 00:14:26.282
No complaining.

00:14:26.324 --> 00:14:27.658
Course not!

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:30.578
And here's something
so you aren't empty-handed.

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:33.498
Tell them that
Demon King Satan lives.

00:14:33.539 --> 00:14:35.958
And that they shouldn't fear,

00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:39.003
for he possesses
one of the swords!

00:14:39.045 --> 00:14:40.630
I'm in a new world.

00:14:40.671 --> 00:14:42.882
And here,
I will further my powers.

00:14:42.924 --> 00:14:45.343
I'll return and
bring peace to the realm.

00:14:45.385 --> 00:14:49.180
But until then, use these
words to keep them calm.

00:14:49.222 --> 00:14:52.600
Ciriatto, I order you
to serve as Camio's aide.

00:14:52.642 --> 00:14:55.311
Unite the demons,
and lead as an example for them.

00:14:56.521 --> 00:14:57.355
Now.

00:14:57.397 --> 00:14:59.315
Don't let the
door hit you, gents.

00:15:04.404 --> 00:15:06.406
Right! Everyone line up!

00:15:06.447 --> 00:15:09.784
Don't cry,
I hear it doesn't hurt too bad.

00:15:10.993 --> 00:15:12.120
[MAOU]
Camio.

00:15:12.161 --> 00:15:14.163
Don't punish Ciriatto.

00:15:14.205 --> 00:15:16.124
I leave our home in your care.

00:15:16.165 --> 00:15:18.209
Sire.

00:15:22.088 --> 00:15:24.549
[ASHIYA] Our final challenge
is closing the Gate.

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:25.925
[MAOU]
Indeed.

00:15:25.967 --> 00:15:29.095
You can get your hands off
of me or lose 'em!

00:15:32.849 --> 00:15:33.724
So, uh...

00:15:33.766 --> 00:15:35.435
Help us seal the gate?

00:15:35.476 --> 00:15:36.644
Pretty please?

00:15:36.686 --> 00:15:39.147
This was supposed
to be a girls' trip!

00:15:39.188 --> 00:15:40.773
You owe me!

00:15:41.441 --> 00:15:44.068
I haven't felt
like this in a while.

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:47.029
I'm even stronger
than I remembered.

00:15:47.071 --> 00:15:48.906
[EMI] I'll sever the Gate
from this realm.

00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:51.951
After that, it's all you,
O muscle-y one.

00:15:51.993 --> 00:15:54.245
You make it sound so easy.

00:15:54.287 --> 00:15:56.747
No sweat off my back.

00:15:56.789 --> 00:15:57.623
[MAOU]
For real?

00:15:57.665 --> 00:15:58.916
That's disturbing.

00:16:05.465 --> 00:16:06.507
It's ready!

00:16:06.549 --> 00:16:08.384
Gang, you know what to do!

00:16:17.268 --> 00:16:19.312
Look! It's clearing up!

00:16:19.353 --> 00:16:20.855
Is it done?

00:16:20.897 --> 00:16:22.356
[AMANE]
I'd say so!

00:16:22.398 --> 00:16:24.484
Your friends must be exhausted.

00:16:24.525 --> 00:16:26.652
Fingers crossed
they're decent swimmers.

00:16:26.694 --> 00:16:29.780
Looks like they divebombed a
pretty good ways off the coast.

00:16:29.822 --> 00:16:31.365
Wha...?

00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:37.705

All of us are fine.

00:16:48.591 --> 00:16:49.967
It's done.

00:16:50.009 --> 00:16:51.928
For the time being, anyway.

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:54.597
That's such a relief.

Hey there, cutie!

00:16:59.769 --> 00:17:01.103
It was so cool!

00:17:01.145 --> 00:17:06.150
Mama and Dada and tweet and Luci

--Yeah?
--There were some bad guys,

Then they did a hug,

That sounds awesome, I think.

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:26.546
I just realized I need to
stop killing out of hatred.

00:17:26.587 --> 00:17:28.047
If blood needs to be spilled,

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:30.424
let's save it for when
we're out of this realm.

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.178
Though our time was short,

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:36.639
thanks a million
for making it so sweet.

00:17:36.681 --> 00:17:39.350
Not to kick you out,
but I'm kicking you out.

00:17:39.392 --> 00:17:40.601
--Huh?
--Huh?

00:17:40.643 --> 00:17:43.062
Don't be sad,
there's good news, too!

00:17:43.104 --> 00:17:45.064
Your apartments are all fixed.

00:17:45.106 --> 00:17:45.898
Cool.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:48.734
I mean,
since Aunt Mikitty sent you,

00:17:48.776 --> 00:17:50.861
I was confident there
would be more to you people

00:17:50.903 --> 00:17:52.363
than what meets the eye.

00:17:52.405 --> 00:17:55.866
But you're still a little bit
too intense for my customers.

00:17:55.908 --> 00:17:56.701
[CHIHO]
Uh.

00:17:56.742 --> 00:18:00.871
Sorry to interrupt,
but do you all see that, too?

00:18:00.913 --> 00:18:03.165
That child-shaped shadow thingy?

00:18:03.207 --> 00:18:04.959
Or am I losing it?

00:18:05.001 --> 00:18:06.335
Huh? The hell?

00:18:06.377 --> 00:18:08.629
Oh, boy.

00:18:08.671 --> 00:18:10.381
[gasps]

00:18:10.423 --> 00:18:11.549
[CHIHO]
Holy crap!

00:18:11.591 --> 00:18:14.885
Chill out, this is like
50 percent you guys' fault.

00:18:14.927 --> 00:18:17.471
Uh, what the heck
do you mean by that?

00:18:17.513 --> 00:18:19.807
[AMANE] Remember what I told
you about the Mouren Yassa,

00:18:19.849 --> 00:18:21.392
those drowned spirits?

00:18:21.434 --> 00:18:22.435
That was bull.

00:18:22.476 --> 00:18:24.729
In reality, this is
one of the few places

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:27.690
where the dead can clean
their souls during Obon.

00:18:27.732 --> 00:18:29.567
My dad and I watch this place.

00:18:29.609 --> 00:18:32.111
And we fight to protect
the souls of the dead.

00:18:32.153 --> 00:18:34.905
I guess you could
say we're their guardians.

00:18:34.947 --> 00:18:37.950
Last night, whatever magic
you were flinging around

00:18:37.992 --> 00:18:39.952
all willy-nilly distorted
the environment

00:18:39.994 --> 00:18:42.538
of this sacred place.

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:46.167
These souls are on the verge
of losing their human shape.

00:18:46.208 --> 00:18:47.501
You have to leave.

00:18:47.543 --> 00:18:50.296
They can't handle
any more of your chaos.

00:18:50.338 --> 00:18:52.423
So, these are real-life ghosts?

00:18:52.465 --> 00:18:55.176
Sure, if that
term's helpful to you.

00:18:55.217 --> 00:18:57.470
Anyway, thank you
so much for your hard work,

00:18:57.511 --> 00:18:59.680
and enjoy that bonus for me!

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:03.851
As the daughter of Binah,

00:19:03.893 --> 00:19:07.355
listen when I say you need to
find the Daath of your world,

00:19:07.396 --> 00:19:09.565
and restore it to its true form.

00:19:09.607 --> 00:19:12.151
That's gotta be what
Aunt Mikitty is waiting for!

00:19:14.612 --> 00:19:15.780
[MAOU]
Wait.

00:19:15.821 --> 00:19:18.074
Did I miss something?!

00:19:24.205 --> 00:19:25.539
Mister Maou. Check it.

00:19:25.581 --> 00:19:27.708
It's bonus time, baby!

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:29.126
Fifty-thousand yen!

00:19:29.168 --> 00:19:32.838
I certainly hope this won't
disappear like Amane did.

00:19:34.674 --> 00:19:38.135
I'm trying to call her, but it
just says she's unavailable.

00:19:38.177 --> 00:19:39.261
Your Majesty.

00:19:39.303 --> 00:19:41.847
I found this atop our luggage.

00:19:43.099 --> 00:19:45.601
[MAOU]
Huh. Well, that's nifty.

00:19:48.437 --> 00:19:50.356
It goes on forever.

00:19:50.398 --> 00:19:52.066
My liege, this
is mere child's play

00:19:52.108 --> 00:19:54.360
compared to the
size of our dimension.

00:19:54.402 --> 00:19:56.445
Whether it's big or small,

00:19:56.487 --> 00:19:59.198
Choshi would be dirt if it
had just been me here.

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:02.201
No chance I could've protected
this place on my own.

00:20:02.243 --> 00:20:04.286
You can't be so certain, Sire.

00:20:04.328 --> 00:20:05.579
It doesn't really matter,

00:20:05.621 --> 00:20:07.081
I doubt I could've taken
the demon realm

00:20:07.123 --> 00:20:09.583
without you guys by my side.

00:20:09.625 --> 00:20:11.001
It's funny, looking back.

00:20:11.043 --> 00:20:13.129
We were enemies.

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:15.005
But look at how far we've come.

00:20:15.047 --> 00:20:16.966
You're always on my side.

00:20:17.007 --> 00:20:20.970
Couldn't that same thing
happen with humankind?

00:20:21.011 --> 00:20:23.931
How curious. It seems possible.

00:20:23.973 --> 00:20:26.434
I thought you'd be more
surprised at the suggestion!

00:20:26.475 --> 00:20:27.727
Well, what can I say?

00:20:27.768 --> 00:20:30.438
I've grown used to
your machinations.

00:20:30.479 --> 00:20:33.149
[MAOU] I just think it'd
be a waste to lose them!

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:35.151
The way they make
electricity is awesome.

00:20:35.192 --> 00:20:37.153
I mean, these people
built a Sky Tree taller

00:20:37.194 --> 00:20:39.572
than my castle without magic!

00:20:39.613 --> 00:20:41.240
Apparently, that's Choshi Tower,

00:20:41.282 --> 00:20:43.576
and it's not taller
than your castle.

00:20:43.617 --> 00:20:45.453
Look at that big ol' boy!

00:20:45.494 --> 00:20:47.455
It's amazing they
have things like this

00:20:47.496 --> 00:20:48.873
and still use
the Electric Railway

00:20:48.914 --> 00:20:51.667
to maintain some
kinda tradition.

00:20:51.709 --> 00:20:54.253
We can't destroy these people.

00:20:54.295 --> 00:20:56.756
Think about it, wouldn't
ruling over subjects like these

00:20:56.797 --> 00:20:59.133
be super cool?

00:20:59.175 --> 00:21:00.885
That's quite a lofty goal, Sire.

00:21:00.926 --> 00:21:01.719
In the meantime,

00:21:01.761 --> 00:21:05.306
let's work on your ability
to use magic consistently.

00:21:05.347 --> 00:21:06.974
Wait, hold up a minute.

00:21:07.016 --> 00:21:08.058
How'd you get enough magic

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.853
to transform back
into your old self?

00:21:10.895 --> 00:21:11.687
The sword.

00:21:11.729 --> 00:21:12.980
The one Camio brought?

00:21:13.022 --> 00:21:15.983
It's weird, but it was
my horn you broke.

00:21:16.025 --> 00:21:18.861
It still had some magic left.

00:21:18.903 --> 00:21:21.030
He told me that Olba
brought it with him.

00:21:21.071 --> 00:21:23.741
I'm more concerned
about this thing.

00:21:25.409 --> 00:21:29.663
Somehow, he must've adhered it
inside the sword's sheath.

00:21:29.705 --> 00:21:31.165
Camio mentioned
that Olba left them

00:21:31.207 --> 00:21:33.584
some kind of clue to
lead them to the sword.

00:21:33.626 --> 00:21:35.628
This must be it.

00:21:35.669 --> 00:21:37.963
So that's a fragment of Yesod?

00:21:38.005 --> 00:21:39.381
[MAOU]
Must be.

00:21:39.423 --> 00:21:40.925
You should hold onto it.

00:21:40.966 --> 00:21:42.092
Thank you.

00:21:42.134 --> 00:21:43.219
Wait a second.

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:44.929
So, you're not even
a little bit worried

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:47.515
this will make me more powerful?

00:21:47.556 --> 00:21:48.599
I'm not scared.

00:21:48.641 --> 00:21:50.476
Just who do you think I am?

00:21:50.518 --> 00:21:52.520
You should sleep
with one eye open.

00:21:52.561 --> 00:21:54.104
Because when
I get my power back,

00:21:54.146 --> 00:21:56.941
I'll dominate you the
same as everyone else!

00:21:56.982 --> 00:21:58.275
[gasps]

00:21:58.317 --> 00:22:00.903
When you say dominate, you mean
in the conquer the world way,

00:22:00.945 --> 00:22:02.655
not the bedroom way, right?

00:22:02.696 --> 00:22:06.075
I don't-- Now you went
and made it creepy!

00:22:06.116 --> 00:22:07.660
It's not too late, you know.

00:22:07.701 --> 00:22:08.911
Let's find dear Amane

00:22:08.953 --> 00:22:11.580
and have her banish him
back to the demon realm.

00:22:11.622 --> 00:22:14.250
We should refrain from
drawing attention to ourselves.

00:22:14.291 --> 00:22:16.877
[URUSHIHARA] The second hand
embarrassment is killing me.

00:22:16.919 --> 00:22:19.672
So is this freakin' sun.
Give me AC.
