And be sure to keep a close eye
on your sacred sword friend.

Before we get going,

00:08:05.303 --> 00:08:07.516
what exactly did you mean
back there, good Albert?

00:08:08.267 --> 00:08:09.269
Mean by what?

00:08:09.352 --> 00:08:11.273
When you said,
"Give thanks to Adramelech."

00:08:11.858 --> 00:08:13.528
I was being a little facetious,

00:08:13.612 --> 00:08:15.031
but...the truth is,

00:08:15.406 --> 00:08:17.035
I've known for a while
that the Devil's army

00:08:17.118 --> 00:08:19.707
hasn't been on some grand quest
to wipe out mankind.

00:08:20.208 --> 00:08:22.922
I've also known demons
can be pretty reasonable folks.

00:08:24.717 --> 00:08:26.261
Adramelech made that clear.

00:08:27.055 --> 00:08:29.602
He and his army made us look
like a bunch of weaklings.

00:08:30.353 --> 00:08:32.232
I was prepared
to die at his hand.

00:08:33.234 --> 00:08:35.781
[ADRAMELECH] Our objective
is not to massacre your people!

Submit to us,

00:08:41.626 --> 00:08:43.087
Can't say he was a gem.

00:08:43.212 --> 00:08:45.007
He would slaughter anyone
who stepped out.

00:08:45.509 --> 00:08:46.426
But I'd bet my life

00:08:46.511 --> 00:08:48.430
that he wouldn't kill
a civilian for fun.

00:08:49.474 --> 00:08:51.061
We eventually
crossed paths again

00:08:51.144 --> 00:08:52.648
on our way to defeat the Devil.

00:08:53.733 --> 00:08:55.904
[ALBERT] Fall back, I can
handle this one on my own!

00:08:56.531 --> 00:08:57.533
One on one!

00:08:59.452 --> 00:09:01.456
[ADRAMELECH] A true warrior
does not allow themselves

00:09:01.541 --> 00:09:03.335
to be carried
by such cheap pride.

00:09:03.586 --> 00:09:06.008
Come! Face me,
Hero and company!

00:09:06.551 --> 00:09:07.553
[gasps]

00:09:08.722 --> 00:09:10.517
He was a far better warrior
than I was,

00:09:10.601 --> 00:09:12.478
and in many ways,
a far better man.

00:09:12.855 --> 00:09:14.734
Though, that does feel
like a strange way

00:09:14.817 --> 00:09:16.111
to refer to a demon.

00:09:18.198 --> 00:09:19.744
Adramelech
wouldn't follow a king

00:09:19.827 --> 00:09:21.288
who was a bloodthirsty beast.

00:09:21.748 --> 00:09:24.002
So, when Emilia said
she wouldn't kill Satan,

00:09:24.377 --> 00:09:26.799
I was okay with sitting back
and watching for a while.

00:09:27.342 --> 00:09:29.137
I was ready to learn
more about him.

00:09:30.056 --> 00:09:31.350
And find out
what sort of people

00:09:31.433 --> 00:09:33.437
the demons
and their king really are.

00:09:33.813 --> 00:09:35.316
If you ask me, they're a sort

00:09:35.399 --> 00:09:36.819
not much different
from our own.

00:09:37.195 --> 00:09:39.366
Perhaps. So, what's our plan?

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:41.829
With the Devil unable
to use the sacred sword,

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.958
openly taking back
Emilia and the others

00:09:44.042 --> 00:09:45.086
may prove a challenge.

00:09:45.461 --> 00:09:47.256
We have two primary objectives.

00:09:47.423 --> 00:09:48.342
Hmm?

00:09:48.425 --> 00:09:50.012
Well, to release Emilia,

00:09:50.346 --> 00:09:51.641
we must rescue her father.

00:09:52.183 --> 00:09:53.728
We have approximately 12 hours

00:09:53.812 --> 00:09:55.649
to save him
and the emperor as well.

00:09:56.066 --> 00:09:57.402
We must get to them soon.

00:09:57.736 --> 00:09:59.197
To beat the volunteer army.

Whoa, there.

You're suggesting
that we not only free Nord,

00:10:02.705 --> 00:10:05.084
but kidnap the Emperor-Unifier
while we're at it?

00:10:05.877 --> 00:10:07.965
It's not impossible.
Not for us.

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:09.802
Both parties are blind.
