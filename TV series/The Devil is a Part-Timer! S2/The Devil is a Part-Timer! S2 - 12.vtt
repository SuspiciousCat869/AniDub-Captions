Where could Raguel be?
Any ideas?

Because he's using TV signals
to boost his sonar,

there are only
two places he could be.

[EMI] Then why the hell
did we come here?

This is my office,
not a broadcast station!

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:29.738
[URUSHIHARA] Raguel set up
camp in one of these towers,

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.448

How could we possibly do that?

We're gonna use

and send out a sonar pulse
on Docodemo's frequency band.

How shall we ascend this beast?

00:02:01.872 --> 00:02:03.624
The typical choice
would be the elevator,

but it's possible to
climb up via the stairs.

00:08:02.732 --> 00:08:04.109
Anything?

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:07.237
Two hits,
15 kilometers that way.

[URUSHIHARA]
Emi and Raguel?

00:08:08.863 --> 00:08:09.781
[SUZUNO]
Perhaps.

00:08:09.823 --> 00:08:12.784
But it could also be
Emilia and Alas Ramus.

00:08:12.826 --> 00:08:14.411
And at Maou's tower?

00:08:14.452 --> 00:08:16.121
[SUZUNO]
There's one hit.

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:18.832
[URUSHIHARA] Then that's gotta
be the watcher, doesn't it?

00:08:18.873 --> 00:08:20.333
We should give
everybody a heads-up.

00:08:20.375 --> 00:08:21.126
Hold on.

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:23.586
I'm sensing one more hit.

00:08:23.628 --> 00:08:25.171
We must ready ourselves.

00:08:25.213 --> 00:08:26.923
It's coming toward us.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.638
Uh. Good Chiho?

00:08:37.934 --> 00:08:40.145
Damn, girl. You cool?

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:42.439
I don't have time
to explain right now.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.774
Miss Suzuno, did
you send out that sonar?

00:08:44.816 --> 00:08:46.276
Yes, 'twas I.

00:08:46.317 --> 00:08:47.944
She told me that's not good.

00:08:47.986 --> 00:08:49.863
Don't do it anymore please.

00:08:49.904 --> 00:08:52.949
She says the world could
get thrown off balance.

00:08:52.991 --> 00:08:54.534
Dude, who's "she"?

00:08:54.576 --> 00:08:56.870
You gotta fill us in.

00:08:58.329 --> 00:09:01.291
And now, I'm supposed to say,
"Leave me alone, dummy!"

00:09:01.332 --> 00:09:02.959
And stick out my tongue.

Silence, philistine!

You dare speak
to me of God's will?

The same God who told us
to "love thy neighbor"?

00:09:58.389 --> 00:10:00.100
That God disdains you.

You terrorize this world.

hands on an innocent woman?

Our disrupted do's give
evidence of another sonar usage.

Raguel is nowhere to be seen,

I don't think so.

You're Raguel?

everything on wanting

to avenge my father.

00:12:14.442 --> 00:12:16.694
What does it mean for me
if he's alive?

If there's no one to avenge,
are you still my enemy?

about that, Gabe.

very clear instructions

Yeesh, dude.

I don't believe that
she'll be joining us tonight.

Every time that
something happens,

00:13:02.865 --> 00:13:05.326
you assume that I'm the bad guy.

00:13:05.368 --> 00:13:06.703
I didn't do a thing to her.

00:13:06.744 --> 00:13:09.330
She just lost the will to fight.

00:13:09.372 --> 00:13:11.082

over the "defeat the Devil"
rug anymore.

There's a lot of stuff
happening out in the world.

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:47.660
Her primary concern shouldn't
be the fry cook fiend.

00:13:47.702 --> 00:13:50.163
Well, my fun here's done.

00:13:50.204 --> 00:13:51.581

and then have the gall
to call it righteous.

That's low, even for us.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:05.636

That's right.

We're demons.

We're monsters.

We hunt and kill and
terrorize just to survive.

But we know what we are,
and we own up to it.

of their sins and misdeeds.

They're far nobler than you!

To be honest, I'm lost,

00:14:30.078 --> 00:14:32.121
but I'm getting the
feeling you want to fight.

Even with
your full Devil powers,

I can kick your booty
to the curb.

Maybe being the Hero
is too much responsibility

for me to deal with.

how much good it's brought
into my life over the years.

No sense worrying about it now.

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:03.838
[ASHIYA]
My liege!

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.840
Ashiya! Stop him!

00:16:05.882 --> 00:16:07.592
Sire.

00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:10.011
It won't be easy.

00:16:10.052 --> 00:16:12.346
The tip might be gone,
but she's still sharp!

00:16:12.388 --> 00:16:14.265
Slicin' and dicin' all day!

00:16:14.307 --> 00:16:16.476
[ASHIYA]
Prove it to me, you fool!

00:16:18.811 --> 00:16:20.104
[GABRIEL]
Later gator.

00:16:20.146 --> 00:16:21.772
--Ah!
--Huh?

00:16:21.814 --> 00:16:23.024
You fight like the Hero.

00:16:23.065 --> 00:16:24.817
Strength over strategy, huh?

00:16:24.859 --> 00:16:26.652
Yeah. Bang!

00:16:27.653 --> 00:16:28.738
What is this?

00:16:28.779 --> 00:16:30.615
You've barely touched
the real goods.

00:16:30.656 --> 00:16:36.245
You've merely been
ragging on my replicants.

00:16:36.287 --> 00:16:39.457
[RAGUEL]
You moron!

00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:42.835
[MAOU]
Emi!

00:16:42.877 --> 00:16:44.712
Looks like I'm just in time.

00:16:44.837 --> 00:16:47.215
[GABRIEL] You're over
your existential crisis?

00:16:47.256 --> 00:16:49.175
Thought that'd be
harder to process.

00:16:49.217 --> 00:16:51.594
[EMI] I'm repressing that crap;
I'll deal with it later!

00:16:53.471 --> 00:16:55.348
Procrastination's a no-no.

00:16:55.389 --> 00:16:56.933
If you start slacking now,

00:16:56.974 --> 00:16:59.435
you'll end up a
NEET like Lucifer!

00:16:59.477 --> 00:17:01.896
Hey! Since when
did you know this trick?

00:17:12.865 --> 00:17:15.826
This one! He's the real deal!

00:17:15.868 --> 00:17:19.038
Hurry! I can't
hold him for long!

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:20.957
Maou!

00:17:20.998 --> 00:17:22.917
Heavenly Fang of Light!

00:17:22.959 --> 00:17:25.086
[GABRIEL]
Oow!

00:17:30.675 --> 00:17:32.134
[RAGUEL grunts]
Stop wasting our time!

00:17:32.176 --> 00:17:34.804
The future of Heaven is entirely
dependent on whether or not

00:17:34.845 --> 00:17:36.973
we're able to capture
Lailah, ya know!

00:17:37.014 --> 00:17:38.766
So quit interfering!

00:17:41.852 --> 00:17:43.854
That's not going to happen.

00:17:43.896 --> 00:17:45.606
Whoa. This is new!

00:17:45.648 --> 00:17:47.567
That's something
you don't see every day.

00:17:47.608 --> 00:17:49.068
I don't know whether
you're possessing this girl,

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.861
or using some weird
puppet technique,

00:17:50.903 --> 00:17:52.196
but now that
you're finally here,

00:17:52.238 --> 00:17:54.574
I hope you're prepared
to face my wrath!

00:17:54.615 --> 00:17:57.660
[ASHIYA] I thought wrath
was frowned upon.

00:17:57.702 --> 00:18:01.122
HuH? I'm... all woozy.

00:18:04.458 --> 00:18:06.502
Aw... I'll concede.

00:18:06.544 --> 00:18:07.878
You beat us.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.964
We'll get outta your hair.

00:18:10.006 --> 00:18:11.632
[RAGUEL]
We will?

00:18:11.674 --> 00:18:12.883
[GABRIEL] I understand
we're in no position

00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:14.385
to betray orders from Heaven,

00:18:14.427 --> 00:18:18.889
but I've never been one to
fight a battle I might not win.

00:18:18.931 --> 00:18:20.099
What's more.

00:18:20.141 --> 00:18:22.977
After watching you lot
and the humans here,

00:18:23.019 --> 00:18:26.981
I think I'm about ready
to see the old world change.

00:18:27.023 --> 00:18:29.734
You want that, too, yeah?

00:18:30.151 --> 00:18:32.862
Eh, not like I care.

00:18:32.903 --> 00:18:34.238
Asta la bye bye!

00:18:37.325 --> 00:18:40.036
We could've crushed him.

00:18:40.578 --> 00:18:42.830
[EMI]
Lailah. Is that you?

00:18:42.872 --> 00:18:45.041
Is that you, Mom?

00:18:45.082 --> 00:18:46.167
This is bad.

00:18:46.208 --> 00:18:49.253
She says that we messed up
the world's energy balance.

00:18:49.295 --> 00:18:50.630
I guess we went
a little overboard

00:18:50.671 --> 00:18:52.423
gathering up that magic.

00:18:52.465 --> 00:18:53.674
[ASHIYA]
Who is "she"?

00:18:53.716 --> 00:18:57.178
Ah. You're talking
to my mom, aren't you?

00:18:57.219 --> 00:18:58.095
Chiho.

00:18:58.137 --> 00:19:00.222
Please let me say something!

00:19:00.264 --> 00:19:01.891
Uh. Sorry.

00:19:01.932 --> 00:19:04.226
She says we don't
have any more time left.

00:19:04.268 --> 00:19:05.102
Uh, yes.

00:19:05.144 --> 00:19:06.103
Understood!

00:19:06.145 --> 00:19:07.271
Chiho?

00:19:07.313 --> 00:19:09.023
[CHIHO]
I'm so sorry!

00:19:09.273 --> 00:19:12.526
The sun is gonna
come back out tomorrow!

00:19:35.383 --> 00:19:37.468
Guess it's game over?

00:19:42.765 --> 00:19:44.475
Hey, Chi!

00:19:47.561 --> 00:19:50.022
Yeah, you should rest.

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:56.987
The lady you spoke with
never gave you her name?

00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:58.114
Right.

00:19:58.155 --> 00:20:00.074
I can't believe you were
so willing to trust her

00:20:00.116 --> 00:20:01.575
with your body.

00:20:01.617 --> 00:20:05.037
Something about her told me
that she was a good person.

00:20:05.079 --> 00:20:06.622
Plus, I got to fight.

00:20:06.664 --> 00:20:08.624
I've always wanted to
be able to protect you guys

00:20:08.666 --> 00:20:10.835
the way that you protect me.

00:20:10.876 --> 00:20:12.795
It was a nice change of pace.

00:20:12.837 --> 00:20:15.840
[sighs]
You're making me nervous.

00:20:15.881 --> 00:20:19.260
You're almost too ready
for action these days.

00:20:19.301 --> 00:20:21.887
Go ahead and blame
my crazy friends for that.

00:20:21.929 --> 00:20:24.473
They've turned me into
quite the thrill seeker.

00:20:24.515 --> 00:20:27.143
Feel okay after putting
your body through that?

00:20:27.184 --> 00:20:29.687
Physically, I'm totally fine.

00:20:29.729 --> 00:20:31.355
It's just...

00:20:31.397 --> 00:20:32.857
There are all these
memories in my head

00:20:32.898 --> 00:20:35.735
that I know for a fact
don't belong to me.

00:20:35.776 --> 00:20:40.531
Brand new images with
intense emotions attached.

00:20:40.573 --> 00:20:43.743
For example, I see a tiny demon.

00:20:46.036 --> 00:20:48.372
[COWORKER A] Yes.
Of course. I'm terribly sorry.

00:20:48.414 --> 00:20:51.751
[COWORKER B] Absolutely.
We'll be compensating customers.

00:20:51.792 --> 00:20:53.419
[RIKA, EMI sigh]

00:20:53.461 --> 00:20:56.547
[RIKA] Wonder if that weird
stuff yesterday caused this.

00:20:56.589 --> 00:20:57.840
Did you see it?

00:20:57.882 --> 00:21:01.343
There were these bright waves
of light expanding in the sky.

00:21:01.385 --> 00:21:02.553
Oh, wow.

00:21:02.595 --> 00:21:04.805
I was busy giving
Alas Ramus a bath,

00:21:04.847 --> 00:21:07.057
so I must've totally missed it.

00:21:07.099 --> 00:21:08.726
[ALAS RAMUS yawns]

00:21:08.768 --> 00:21:11.979
Mama, can we see
Chi-mi at the hospital?

00:21:12.021 --> 00:21:15.065
Sure. We'll go make
sure she's okay after work.

00:21:17.526 --> 00:21:18.444
[MAOU]
I'm home.

00:21:18.486 --> 00:21:19.904
It's about time, Sire.

00:21:19.945 --> 00:21:21.197
Welcome.

00:21:21.238 --> 00:21:23.407
[SUZUNO]
How is good Chiho fairing?

00:21:23.449 --> 00:21:24.325
[MAOU]
Great.

00:21:24.366 --> 00:21:27.578
Chi's doing really well,
almost too well if you ask me.

00:21:29.538 --> 00:21:30.748
Here's some footage
of the anomaly...

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:34.251
Hey, yo! Check it!
Pics on the TV!

00:21:34.293 --> 00:21:36.629
[MAOU] Told you it
was a good investment!

00:21:42.718 --> 00:21:46.722
For example, I see a tiny demon.

00:21:46.764 --> 00:21:48.474
He's crying a lot,

00:21:48.516 --> 00:21:50.601
and he's so beat up that
if I don't help him,

00:21:50.643 --> 00:21:52.561
I think he'll die.

00:21:52.603 --> 00:21:56.482
You see?
I only ever wanted to help you.

00:21:56.524 --> 00:21:57.942
[MAOU]
Chi?

00:21:57.983 --> 00:22:01.320
Sorry. I was so fixated
on stoking your flame of life

00:22:01.362 --> 00:22:02.863
that I forgot things.

00:22:02.905 --> 00:22:06.742
In fact, I forgot the most
important lesson of them all.

00:22:06.784 --> 00:22:09.078
For that, I've always
wanted to apologize.

00:22:09.119 --> 00:22:10.329
Who are you?

00:22:10.371 --> 00:22:12.915
What are you doing
with Chi's body?

00:22:12.957 --> 00:22:14.542
Don't fool yourself.

00:22:14.583 --> 00:22:18.087
You could never forget about me.

00:22:18.128 --> 00:22:21.799
Satan Jacob.

00:22:21.841 --> 00:22:25.135
I want restoration
of all worlds.

00:22:25.177 --> 00:22:29.348
Enta Isla, Heaven,
and the demon realm, as well.

00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:32.560
It's no coincidence you found
yourself in this world.

00:22:32.601 --> 00:22:34.687
[MAOU]
Huh? How could you--?

00:22:34.728 --> 00:22:37.231
You're here because
this is a "sephirah land,"

00:22:37.273 --> 00:22:39.024
and it wasn't too far away.

00:22:39.066 --> 00:22:41.360
[MAOU] I don't know
what you're talking about!

00:22:41.402 --> 00:22:43.821
[CHIHO]
She holds the other key.

00:22:43.863 --> 00:22:47.116
And that father of hers.

00:22:47.157 --> 00:22:50.703
Tell me. Where are
you hiding right now?

00:22:50.744 --> 00:22:54.790
[CHIHO] I beg you.
Find the Daath of Ente Isla

00:22:54.832 --> 00:22:58.294
and return the world
to its proper form.

00:22:58.335 --> 00:23:00.546
Work hard, King Satan.

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:03.966
So, uh, I'm pretty sure.

00:23:04.008 --> 00:23:07.261
I have this random
memory of you as a kid.

00:23:07.303 --> 00:23:08.095
Huh?

00:23:08.137 --> 00:23:10.472
Something the matter,
Mister Maou?

00:23:10.514 --> 00:23:14.852
Oh, no. Nothing at all.

00:23:14.894 --> 00:23:16.520
The woman who wore that ring.

00:23:16.562 --> 00:23:18.814
Did she say anything
about the future?

00:23:18.856 --> 00:23:20.190
She didn't.

00:23:20.232 --> 00:23:24.612
Also, would it be best if I left
the ring with you or Miss Yusa?

00:23:24.653 --> 00:23:25.779
Neither.

00:23:25.821 --> 00:23:27.823
You should be
the one to keep it.

00:23:27.865 --> 00:23:29.783
Might be lucky.

00:23:31.076 --> 00:23:33.412
[URUSHIHARA] First you gotta
press the button on the top.

00:23:33.454 --> 00:23:34.705
[SUZUNO]
Huh? The top?

00:23:34.747 --> 00:23:35.873
What about these in the mi--?

00:23:35.915 --> 00:23:37.583
Do the colors correspond
to different tasks?

00:23:37.625 --> 00:23:40.419
[URUSHIHARA] Yeah, those
are too advanced for you.
