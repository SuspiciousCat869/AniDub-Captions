How? That sword he's wielding
is clearly sacred!

00:08:54.777 --> 00:08:57.825
I'm glad to see you in
good health, Father Olba.

00:08:58.450 --> 00:08:59.870
I thought we'd never meet again

00:08:59.954 --> 00:09:01.666
after you disappeared
from Japan.

00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:04.379
Imagine my surprise
to find you in Efzahan.

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:06.551
Great. You're here.

00:09:07.594 --> 00:09:09.640
Unfortunately,
I cannot take any time

00:09:09.724 --> 00:09:11.351
to rejoice in this reunion,

00:09:11.435 --> 00:09:13.188
for it is my sworn duty
to judge you

00:09:13.272 --> 00:09:15.234
for your rather
undeniable sins.

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:17.531
Now, good leaders of
the Malebranche.

00:09:17.906 --> 00:09:19.242
In this moment alone,

00:09:19.326 --> 00:09:22.457
I issue you an order as
Demon General Crestia Bel,

00:09:22.791 --> 00:09:24.879
-of the new Devil's army.
-Huh?

00:09:24.962 --> 00:09:27.801
What?
A "Demon General," she says?

00:09:27.885 --> 00:09:29.889
Explain. What is this lunacy?

00:09:29.972 --> 00:09:31.684
Hold, Barbariccia.

00:09:32.226 --> 00:09:33.228
Tell us.

00:09:33.312 --> 00:09:35.609
What is this order
that you intend to give?

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:38.740
Quietly go along
with everything

00:09:38.823 --> 00:09:40.117
that's about to unfold.

00:09:40.201 --> 00:09:41.036
If you do that,

00:09:41.119 --> 00:09:43.833
King Satan will forgive
your unauthorized actions.

00:09:44.167 --> 00:09:46.547
And allow you to return
to the good Camio.

00:09:46.673 --> 00:09:50.012
Wait. Can it be that a
mere human knows Camio?

00:09:50.137 --> 00:09:51.139
Very well.

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:54.062
We have no alternative
but to heed your every order,

00:09:54.145 --> 00:09:55.147
new general.

00:09:55.524 --> 00:09:57.443
Our foolishness
is unforgivable.

00:09:57.528 --> 00:09:59.615
There is no excuse
that we can make.

00:09:59.824 --> 00:10:02.286
We allowed ourselves
to be deceived by Olba

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:03.665
and his Heavenly allies.

00:10:03.748 --> 00:10:05.961
It cost us
many of our brethren.

00:10:06.044 --> 00:10:08.215
These are consequences
we must face.

00:10:08.424 --> 00:10:10.637
Now, what is the
meaning of this, Crestia Bel?

00:10:10.721 --> 00:10:11.722
Explain!

00:10:11.806 --> 00:10:12.933
My wishes have not changed

00:10:13.058 --> 00:10:14.770
since the day
we first met, Olba.

00:10:14.854 --> 00:10:15.897
It's simple.

00:10:16.022 --> 00:10:17.442
All I want is to build a world

00:10:17.526 --> 00:10:20.030
where our people can walk in
the light of faith and justice,

00:10:20.114 --> 00:10:21.826
and where safety
need not be earned,

00:10:21.909 --> 00:10:23.120
but is granted.

00:10:23.872 --> 00:10:26.753
Huh. Perhaps my time in Japan
has changed me.

00:10:27.128 --> 00:10:28.631
I finally gained
the strength of heart

00:10:28.798 --> 00:10:30.092
to work toward that world.

00:10:30.468 --> 00:10:32.848
Those are genuine angels
flying overhead!

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:35.394
Ally yourself with
the Devil and Emilia,

00:10:35.562 --> 00:10:36.981
and you'll be betraying Heaven,

00:10:37.064 --> 00:10:39.612
Ente Isla,
and the angels above us!

00:10:40.029 --> 00:10:42.200
I never thought I'd hear
such words from you.

00:10:42.534 --> 00:10:44.329
You're sorely mistaken, Olba.

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:47.251
For in the world I know,

00:10:47.794 --> 00:10:49.632
there are no genuine angels.

00:10:49.715 --> 00:10:50.717
[gasps]

00:10:51.552 --> 00:10:54.934
Though they may call themselves
Gabriel, Chamuel, and Raguel,

00:10:55.017 --> 00:10:56.562
they're ordinary humans!

00:10:56.646 --> 00:10:58.440
If powerful people
who grow wings

00:10:58.525 --> 00:11:00.319
get to declare
themselves angels,

00:11:00.402 --> 00:11:01.404
so be it!

00:11:01.488 --> 00:11:03.242
I'll take a quick trip
to Tokyo Hand

00:11:03.325 --> 00:11:04.912
and pick up costume wings.

00:11:04.995 --> 00:11:07.083
Then I shall gladly
join their ranks!

to fight for justice,
I understand your confusion,

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.686
but everything that I have
told you today is the truth!

00:11:16.936 --> 00:11:17.896
As I speak to you,

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:19.900

Using their sacred swords to
punish the demons

upon your great empire.

What are you playing at?

Don't blame Alciel, and
don't blame the Malebranche

00:11:34.763 --> 00:11:37.101
for inviting this chaos
into your precious home.

There's proof
they aren't the culprits.

00:11:39.607 --> 00:11:41.484
And we must ask
the Emperor-Unifier

00:11:41.569 --> 00:11:43.030
to bring that
evidence to light.

I've seen it.
