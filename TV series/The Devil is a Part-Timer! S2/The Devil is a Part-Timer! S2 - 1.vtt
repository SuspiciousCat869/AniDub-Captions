00:00:18.477 --> 00:00:22.022
[NARRATOR] All who lived
in Ente Isla knew of Satan,

00:00:22.064 --> 00:00:23.774
ruler of demons.

00:00:23.815 --> 00:00:27.027
His very name was synonymous
with the terror and cruelty

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:29.655
that ruled his demon realm,
as well as

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:33.659
the creatures of the night
that thrived in its depravity.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.037
Four trusted generals
served the Devil\:

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.793
Adramelech, Lucifer,
Alciel, and Malacoda.

00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:45.754
Satan was an ambitious ruler.

00:00:45.796 --> 00:00:48.882
He sought to crush the
humans and their world,

00:00:48.924 --> 00:00:52.302
thereby creating a land
of peace and prosperity

00:00:52.344 --> 00:00:55.264
for all night's creatures.

00:00:58.058 --> 00:01:02.563
[NARRATOR] However, a hero named
Emilia rose up against them.

00:01:02.604 --> 00:01:06.984
She stormed the Devil's Castle,
sacred sword in hand.

In Ente Isla, the war raged on.

[NARRATOR] After Satan,
the mighty general, Alciel,

00:02:04.708 --> 00:02:08.086
and the Hero Emilia
vanished from the realm.

00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:10.589
The five-continent
federation of knights

00:02:10.631 --> 00:02:13.884
conducted a
large-scale operation.

00:02:13.925 --> 00:02:16.303
They wanted to wipe out
every last remnant

00:02:16.345 --> 00:02:20.557
of Satan's army on
the central continent.

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.269
In the midst of the chaos,
a lone figure ventured deep

00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:26.855
into the Devil's
masterless Castle.

You're gonna give somebody

thoughts on our situation?

00:04:55.045 --> 00:04:57.881
What part? That's so vague.

00:04:57.923 --> 00:04:59.216
You mean how the great Satan

00:04:59.257 --> 00:05:01.176
has turned into the
"Maou the burger flipper"?

00:05:01.218 --> 00:05:03.720
Or how his general Alciel,
AKA "Ashiya,"

00:05:03.762 --> 00:05:05.305
stays home playing mommy?

00:05:05.347 --> 00:05:07.766
The sole problem here is you,
Demon General Lucifer!

00:05:07.808 --> 00:05:08.934
You've become a spoiled shut-in,

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:10.560

and wanting much!

Save the fury for later, please.

I'm already melting in here
without all the extra hot air.

00:05:17.442 --> 00:05:19.778

puts hell to shame.

Maybe you should
go buy a new one?

You've lost your say.

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:29.287
Just think of the waste.

00:05:33.834 --> 00:05:35.293
I need that stuff for research.

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.880

did our savings?

Come on, do you really
need to ask that?

[ASHIYA]
I'm aware of the culprit, Sire.

00:05:56.982 --> 00:05:59.734
My question was a formality.

brew some more tea

about it at work.

00:10:44.394 --> 00:10:46.020
[ASHIYA]
First mission.

00:10:46.062 --> 00:10:48.022
Put today's laundry
in the washer.

00:10:48.064 --> 00:10:49.566
Once the sequence is initiated,

00:10:49.607 --> 00:10:52.110
we enter the opportune
window for vacuuming.

00:10:52.152 --> 00:10:53.444
Understood?

00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:54.487
You betcha.

00:10:54.529 --> 00:10:56.364
Say "yes, sir," maggot!

00:10:57.157 --> 00:10:58.491
[URUSHIHARA]
Dude?

00:10:58.533 --> 00:11:00.201
Where'd you find this relic?

00:11:00.243 --> 00:11:01.995
you steal it from
a pharaoh's tomb?

00:11:02.036 --> 00:11:04.289
It looks older than you.

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:07.292
Aren't fully automatic machines
kinda standard these days?

00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:08.710
For the layman, they might be.

00:11:08.751 --> 00:11:10.879
But semi-automatics
have advantages.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:11.713
The greatest of which

00:11:11.754 --> 00:11:13.840
is that they aren't
controlled by a computer.

00:11:13.882 --> 00:11:16.050
If you take a moment to
consider the total amount

00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:17.135
of water and detergent used,

00:11:17.177 --> 00:11:18.595
you'll find far and
wide that they are

00:11:18.636 --> 00:11:21.055
the more economical choice
for small but frequent loads.

00:11:21.097 --> 00:11:23.766
What's more, they can wash
and spin-dry simultaneously.

00:11:23.808 --> 00:11:25.685
This allows us separation.

00:11:25.727 --> 00:11:28.146
We can have loads of towels,
underwear, lights, and darks,

00:11:28.188 --> 00:11:30.565
saving time and protecting
our precious fabric.

00:11:30.607 --> 00:11:31.608
I get it.

00:11:31.649 --> 00:11:33.568
I'm in the presence
of greatness.

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:36.279
Ugh. Just show me
how to use the thing.

00:11:36.321 --> 00:11:37.197
[ASHIYA]
Hmph.

00:11:37.238 --> 00:11:39.073
For starters,
the washer is on the left,

00:11:39.115 --> 00:11:41.117
and the spinner is on the right.

00:11:41.159 --> 00:11:42.577
After you insert the clothes,

00:11:42.619 --> 00:11:45.121
gently turn this dial
to set the timer.

00:11:45.163 --> 00:11:47.498
And nice shirts go in
this little bag, don't they?

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.125
Stop that! Not so fast!

00:11:49.167 --> 00:11:51.544
It's paramount that you undo
the buttons at the cuffs.

00:11:51.586 --> 00:11:53.004
But they're, like, microscopic!

00:11:53.046 --> 00:11:54.589
Why's it so important?

00:11:54.631 --> 00:11:56.925
[ASHIYA] The buttons sit right
where people tend to sweat!

00:11:56.966 --> 00:11:57.926
If you're not careful...

00:11:57.967 --> 00:11:59.636
Poor girl, are you
forced to listen

00:11:59.677 --> 00:12:02.138
to boring conversations
like this every day?

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:03.473
Such is my life.

00:12:03.514 --> 00:12:06.517
Today's talk is more
esoteric than usual.

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:09.103
Odd. I've somehow grown curious.

00:12:09.187 --> 00:12:11.648
Are fully and semi-automatic
so different?

00:12:11.689 --> 00:12:12.690
No clue.

00:12:12.732 --> 00:12:15.401
I've only ever had to use
the fully automatic kind.

00:12:15.443 --> 00:12:17.195
[ASHIYA]
There's more work to be done.

00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:19.030
Shortly,
the clothes will be dry,

00:12:19.072 --> 00:12:21.282
and we'll bring them
inside to neatly fold.

00:12:21.324 --> 00:12:24.661
After that,
we can put them away.

00:12:24.702 --> 00:12:27.956
Pay attention. T-shirts should
be laid sideways like this.

00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:31.125
Then the sleeves folded in equal
widths on the right and left.

00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:33.795
Lastly, you bring the
bottom up to the neck.

00:12:33.836 --> 00:12:34.837
Well, soldier?

00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:36.839
Are you even listening to me?

00:12:36.881 --> 00:12:39.717
Yeah, but I just picked up on
a presence in the room.

00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:40.718
A presence?

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.679
[skittering sound]

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:47.100
Hey. Do you think it could it
be a <i>Blattella germanica</i>?

00:12:47.141 --> 00:12:50.061
<i>Blate--? Blatella</i>
<i>germanica</i>, you say?

00:12:50.103 --> 00:12:51.020
No chance!

00:12:51.062 --> 00:12:52.397
That would be impossible!

00:12:52.438 --> 00:12:54.274
The Devil's castle is
so perfectly defended

00:12:54.315 --> 00:12:56.484
that an invasion
is inconceivable!

00:12:56.526 --> 00:12:59.237
One intruder, and I have
failed as a general!

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:00.071
I dunno.

00:13:00.113 --> 00:13:02.657
It could be a
<i>Periplaneta fuliginosa</i>.

00:13:02.699 --> 00:13:04.909
[ASHIYA] Silence! You better
not be using fear tactics

00:13:04.951 --> 00:13:06.744
to worm your way
out of doing chores!

00:13:06.786 --> 00:13:09.998
I must embark upon a quest
to the library and supermarket.

00:13:10.039 --> 00:13:12.166
Now, take in the laundry
and finish the cleaning

00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:14.711
before I return,
or you'll regret it!

00:13:23.761 --> 00:13:25.596
[BOTH]
Thank you, and come again soon!

00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:27.849
I've got the washrooms
looking clean and tidy!

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:29.559
Great work today, Chi.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.436
I know your shifts
aren't quite over yet,

00:13:31.477 --> 00:13:33.646
but you two can head home early.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.773
[giggles] Mister Maou,

00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:38.192
are you gonna be,
like, super busy tonight?

00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:41.029
Not me.
No plans are the best plans.

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:42.196
[CHIHO]
Well, in that case.

00:13:42.238 --> 00:13:45.700
Is it cool if I hang out at your
apartment for a little while?

00:13:45.742 --> 00:13:47.785
I want to show these
to Miss Suzuno.

00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:50.371
Oh, yeah,
it's Bon Festival time.

00:13:50.413 --> 00:13:52.206
Aren't these the
flax stalks you burn

00:13:52.248 --> 00:13:53.583
to guide your ancestors back?

00:13:53.624 --> 00:13:54.459
Oh, wow!

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.419
Dang. So you already
know about them?

00:13:56.461 --> 00:13:57.420
[MAOU]
Yup.

00:13:57.462 --> 00:14:00.173
We got to your world
around this time last year.

00:14:00.214 --> 00:14:03.509
We did loads of research on
all your magic and rituals.

00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:06.512
That's awesome. Miss Suzuno
must be less familiar.

00:14:06.554 --> 00:14:09.557
I promised to bring some over,
so she could see them in person.

00:14:09.599 --> 00:14:14.270
That sounds fun. One problem.

00:14:14.312 --> 00:14:17.482
Nothing personal, but I don't
think you should come by today.

00:14:17.523 --> 00:14:19.400
Oh, why not?

00:14:19.442 --> 00:14:21.778

for moments like these.

Too late now.

[MAOU] Shoot.
I totally forgot my umbrella.

00:15:23.005 --> 00:15:25.633
These kinds of showers stop
as quickly as they start.

00:15:25.675 --> 00:15:28.177
Maybe we should wait it out in
the break room together.

Nah. I'm more concerned
with my apartment thanthe rain.

Okie doke!

00:15:32.348 --> 00:15:34.684
In that case, why don't
we share my umbrella?

That's really nice,

00:15:35.852 --> 00:15:37.979

Whoever made that crap up
knew what they were doing.

We use the Latin names.

Yeah, of course.

pretty foggy for demons

00:18:23.686 --> 00:18:26.397
Even the demon realm doesn't
grow apples that massive.

00:18:26.439 --> 00:18:28.232
The only time weird stuff
like this happens to me

00:18:28.274 --> 00:18:29.609
is when I'm around you!

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:31.777
[MAOU] That might be because
you're always around me!

00:18:31.819 --> 00:18:33.654
Ever think of that,
Stalky McCreepers?

00:18:33.696 --> 00:18:35.489
Please, that couldn't be
further from the truth!

00:18:35.531 --> 00:18:37.116
I came to give
Bel info on you clowns

00:18:37.158 --> 00:18:38.701
because she's stuck living here.

00:18:38.743 --> 00:18:41.037
Protecting the world
from you is my duty!

00:18:41.078 --> 00:18:42.496
You think I stalk you?

00:18:42.538 --> 00:18:43.706
Well, there wouldn't be much

00:18:43.748 --> 00:18:45.750
to stalk Mister
One Ratty Unislo shirt!

00:18:45.791 --> 00:18:47.585
Shut up! I understand
you hate me,

00:18:47.627 --> 00:18:49.003
but what did
Unislo do to you?

00:18:49.045 --> 00:18:51.505
Do they not carry sports bras
in size pancake,

00:18:51.547 --> 00:18:53.883
Miss Itty Bitty Hero Committee?

00:18:55.509 --> 00:18:57.219
That does it.

00:18:57.261 --> 00:19:00.139
I'll decapitate
you here and now!

00:19:00.181 --> 00:19:01.682
[screeches] Put that sword away!

00:19:01.724 --> 00:19:02.725
Relax, Emi!

00:19:02.767 --> 00:19:04.226
Let's just use our words!

00:19:04.268 --> 00:19:05.603
Too late for that!

00:19:05.645 --> 00:19:08.731
I'm coming, Lord Sata-- Ohh!

00:19:08.773 --> 00:19:10.358
What's wrong with Chiho?

00:19:10.399 --> 00:19:12.943
[CHIHO]
I got a hug from Mister Maou.

00:19:12.985 --> 00:19:15.071
I got a real hug!

00:19:15.112 --> 00:19:17.448
[giggles] A hug!

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:18.366
We lost her.

00:19:18.407 --> 00:19:19.617
Please.

00:19:19.659 --> 00:19:21.619
Kill this enemy of womankind.

00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:23.663
[MAOU]
Don't make this worse, stop her!

00:19:23.704 --> 00:19:26.290
Shoot, I forgot you're
committee member number two!

00:19:26.332 --> 00:19:29.085
For shame. Our plans for world
domination have been cut down

00:19:29.126 --> 00:19:30.753
before my very eyes!

00:19:30.795 --> 00:19:31.629
Who would've thought our doom

00:19:31.671 --> 00:19:34.340
would involve an insult
about a brassiere?

00:19:34.382 --> 00:19:36.384
Pervert! Time to die!

00:19:43.766 --> 00:19:44.600
Huh?

00:19:44.642 --> 00:19:46.394
The hell is going on?

00:19:46.435 --> 00:19:49.522
I can die happy now! Hah!

00:19:49.563 --> 00:19:51.190
[SUZUNO]
Light of Iron!

00:20:13.254 --> 00:20:14.422
[sneezes]

00:20:26.892 --> 00:20:30.521
So, anybody have a clue
what just happened?

00:20:30.563 --> 00:20:32.690
Nope, and it's getting
really late, so goodnight.

00:20:32.732 --> 00:20:33.983
[MAOU]
You're staying right here!

00:20:34.024 --> 00:20:35.901
Bel and I have nothing
to do with this mess!

00:20:35.943 --> 00:20:38.070
Baby Smith apple's all yours!

00:20:44.076 --> 00:20:45.286
[ALAS RAMUS]
Morning.

00:20:45.327 --> 00:20:47.955
Huh? You can speak
our language, child?

00:20:47.997 --> 00:20:50.249
[ALAS RAMUS]
Uh, a lil bit.

00:20:50.291 --> 00:20:52.334
Then fill us in, what are you?

00:20:52.376 --> 00:20:54.086
I'm Alas Ramus.

00:20:54.128 --> 00:20:56.005
So, is that your name?

00:20:56.046 --> 00:21:00.551
Yeah! I'm Alas Ramus! [sneezes]

00:21:02.136 --> 00:21:06.348
Uh. Well, it's really nice
to meet you, Alas Ramus.

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:08.017
Where did you come from?

00:21:08.058 --> 00:21:11.479
I, uh, don't know.

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.814
Could you tell me
who your parents are?

00:21:13.856 --> 00:21:15.983
Parents? What's that?

00:21:16.025 --> 00:21:18.110
He means your mama
and your dada.

00:21:18.152 --> 00:21:21.071
Dada is Satan!

00:21:21.113 --> 00:21:24.742
That's awesome!
Your dada is Satan!

00:21:24.784 --> 00:21:27.411
Huhh?

00:21:27.912 --> 00:21:30.080
Me? For real?

00:21:30.122 --> 00:21:31.499
What the--? Dada?

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:32.708
You have a child?

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:34.168
[MAOU]
No, Chi, please don't freak out!

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:35.127
You had a wife and kids

00:21:35.169 --> 00:21:37.379
back when you were
Mister Bigshot Devil!

00:21:37.421 --> 00:21:38.380
That's not a very
nice secret to keep!

00:21:38.422 --> 00:21:40.591
Calm down!
I don't have a secret family!

00:21:40.633 --> 00:21:42.718
[ASHIYA] You had better
be telling the truth, Sire!

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:44.595
Huh? <i>Et tu</i>, Ashiya?

00:21:44.637 --> 00:21:46.764
An illegitimate heir
is no laughing matter

00:21:46.806 --> 00:21:47.765
in the demon realm!

00:21:47.807 --> 00:21:48.599
More than that,

00:21:48.641 --> 00:21:50.768
I thought we told each other
everything, my liege!

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:54.188
Chill! Why are you all taking
a toddler's word over mine?

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:55.064
Oh, I know.

00:21:55.105 --> 00:21:56.774
Tell us who your mama is.

00:21:58.943 --> 00:22:00.194
Mama.

00:22:03.239 --> 00:22:05.991
Huh? Are you pointing
at me right now?

00:22:06.033 --> 00:22:08.410
[ALAS RAMUS]
Dada. Mama.

00:22:08.452 --> 00:22:12.331
Either the child is a liar, or
you have some explaining to do.

00:22:12.373 --> 00:22:16.210
Okay, Miss Yusa, you can tell us
the kid is lying anytime now!

00:22:17.294 --> 00:22:19.588
Dada! Mama!

00:22:21.382 --> 00:22:23.175
