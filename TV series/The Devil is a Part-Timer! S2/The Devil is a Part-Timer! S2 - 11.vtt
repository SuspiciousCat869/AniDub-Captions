WEBVTT

00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:14.848
[EMI] And done.
Now to add celestial force.

00:00:17.434 --> 00:00:19.102
Ah! It worked!

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.651
[EMI] If I did this right, it
should lead me to more shards.

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:33.408
Ready.

00:00:46.797 --> 00:00:48.006
How are you doing?

00:00:48.048 --> 00:00:49.550
Oh, y'know.

00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:50.926
Huh?

00:00:50.968 --> 00:00:54.012
So I guess this
isn't a date after all.

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:55.764
I brought you something.

00:00:58.016 --> 00:01:00.269
[ASHIYA] Some simple
souvenirs from Choshi.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.395
Enjoy.

00:01:01.436 --> 00:01:03.939
Oh, yeah, got some
real treasures, I'll bet.

00:01:03.981 --> 00:01:05.941
Aw, thanks so much.

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:10.821
[RIKA] Yup.
That's a very "Ashiya" gift.

00:01:10.862 --> 00:01:13.824
So, tell me, what exactly
are you all here to buy?

00:01:13.865 --> 00:01:15.117
--Uh.
--Uh.

00:01:15.158 --> 00:01:17.828
I, for one, am
investing in a television.

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:19.538
I'm here for a TV, too!

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.748
I'd like to purchase
a mobile phone.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.251
So we're all in dire
need of your expertise.

00:01:24.293 --> 00:01:26.169
I can help out with the phone,

00:01:26.211 --> 00:01:29.339
but I don't know enough about
TVs to give you real advice.

00:01:29.381 --> 00:01:31.466
[ASHIYA] False.
You are a television owner,

00:01:31.508 --> 00:01:33.343
which is more
than can be said for us.

00:01:33.385 --> 00:01:35.721
I'm sure you bought
yours yourself, yes?

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:38.599
Yeah, my ol' twenty-sixer!
It's a little outdated now,

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.060
so I was actually thinking about
upgrading to something 4K.

00:01:42.102 --> 00:01:44.855
Forgive the question,
but what might there be 4K of?

00:01:44.896 --> 00:01:45.981
[RIKA]
For real?

00:01:46.023 --> 00:01:47.524
Jeez, I don't know
if we're quite ready

00:01:47.566 --> 00:01:49.359
for the electronics store.

00:01:49.401 --> 00:01:50.819
Hmm...

00:01:50.861 --> 00:01:53.572
Are you hungry? Let's eat!

00:01:53.614 --> 00:01:54.990
What do you say
I give you the nitty-gritty

00:01:55.032 --> 00:01:57.117
while we grab
some shopping fuel?

00:03:35.966 --> 00:03:38.260
[MAOU] I've heard
of this Manmuru joint.

00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:40.595
They serve udon in such a place?

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:42.180
[ASHIYA]
A hundred and ten yen?

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:44.224
[RIKA] That's for a
small with no toppings.

00:03:44.266 --> 00:03:48.019
With a couple add-ons, it'll
only come out to about 300 yen.

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:50.939
Should be cheap enough to not
cut into your shopping funds.

00:03:50.981 --> 00:03:53.942
A-Am I to guess you
come here often, Miss Suzuki?

00:03:53.984 --> 00:03:56.862
Now and then. Broth
in Kanto is usually so thick,

00:03:56.903 --> 00:03:58.864
but I find it to be light
and yummy here.

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:01.074
Plus, it's good for the wallet.

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:05.579
[RIKA]
Looking delicious as usual!

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.122
Let's eat!

00:04:12.461 --> 00:04:14.921
[inhales sharply] My heavens!

00:04:14.963 --> 00:04:16.965
Whoa, is something
wrong, Suzuno?

00:04:17.007 --> 00:04:19.551
You're not a Manmuru fan?

00:04:19.593 --> 00:04:20.886
[SUZUNO]
I-I'm perplexed.

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:24.055
How does something so
scrumptious cost so little?

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:26.475
It's firm, yet chewy
and easy to consume!

00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:29.686
I proclaim this udon
the perfect food!

00:04:29.728 --> 00:04:32.189
Well, I'm happy you
like it that much.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.234
Anyway, let's talk tech!
What kind of TV you looking for?

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:38.862
I just want something that'll
play the shows.

00:04:38.904 --> 00:04:42.240
That narrows it down.
Got a ballpark budget at least?

00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:44.326
26,239!

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:46.119
[RIKA]
Why so specific?

00:04:46.161 --> 00:04:47.454
Don't worry with that.

00:04:47.496 --> 00:04:50.123
Tell me the truth, does our
budget sound feasible?

00:04:50.165 --> 00:04:52.501
I tried to do
some research earlier,

00:04:52.542 --> 00:04:55.754
but only found articles with
tips on buying plans and such.

00:04:55.796 --> 00:04:59.090
The price of a television
remains an enigma to me.

00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:01.176
I think we'll be
able to find one.

00:05:01.218 --> 00:05:02.385
Hell yeah!

00:05:02.427 --> 00:05:04.846
[SUZUNO]
My budget is 70 thousand yen.

00:05:04.888 --> 00:05:07.599
I bet you can get a
super nice one with that much!

00:05:07.641 --> 00:05:09.309
That is excellent to hear.

00:05:09.351 --> 00:05:12.187
I know very little of
Japanese technology.

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:15.357
Anything past the
Showa era remains a mystery.

00:05:15.398 --> 00:05:18.652
That's a throwback!
Wait, are you like, Emi?

00:05:18.693 --> 00:05:22.155
Did you go to school
outside of the country?

00:05:22.197 --> 00:05:24.199
You specified "Japanese" tech.

00:05:24.241 --> 00:05:27.077
Oh! Correct.
We were missionaries.

00:05:27.118 --> 00:05:30.038
So my parents and I lived
overseas for a while.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.623
We never possessed luxuries.

00:05:31.665 --> 00:05:33.917
Hence, technology
isn't my forte.

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:35.877
Interesting childhood, huh?

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:38.630
I'd be curious to hear more
about it if you don't mind.

00:05:38.672 --> 00:05:41.967
Sure, give me just a moment.
I need another helping.

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:44.386
Wow! You must like this stuff!

00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:47.472
She's rather
the udon connoisseur.

00:05:47.514 --> 00:05:49.599
[RIKA]
So, he knows what she likes.

00:05:50.642 --> 00:05:55.814
[MAN speakiing in Spanish]

00:05:55.856 --> 00:05:57.440
Sir, I don't understand!

00:05:57.482 --> 00:06:00.861
Something going down?
I'll be back in a sec.

00:06:00.902 --> 00:06:03.738
Getting involved
might be a bad idea.

00:06:04.406 --> 00:06:09.661
[MAOU speakng in Spanish]

00:06:09.703 --> 00:06:16.668
[Speakng in Spanish]

00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:26.094
[MAOU]
Excuse me, ma'am.

00:06:26.136 --> 00:06:28.305
Could you get this
man a fork, please?

00:06:28.346 --> 00:06:30.181
Okay! Sure!

00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:40.817
Maou's a mystery to me.

00:06:40.859 --> 00:06:43.486
He has the ambition
to learn a new language.

00:06:43.528 --> 00:06:47.115
But not to graduate
from his part-timer status.

00:06:47.157 --> 00:06:48.241
Sorry 'bout that.

00:06:48.283 --> 00:06:50.994
Couldn't help
but go MgRonald's mode.

00:06:51.036 --> 00:06:55.081
Oh. Let's get outta here.
It's getting crowded.

00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:58.335
[MAN sighs]
Hello? Moron!

00:06:58.376 --> 00:06:59.169
I spoke Spanish

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.796
because it's supposed to be a
popular language on this planet,

00:07:01.838 --> 00:07:04.341
but nobody here knows it!

00:07:04.382 --> 00:07:07.052
No! Mi espaÃ±ol esta bien!

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:09.054
If you knew what country
the target was in,

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:12.599
why didn't you tell me to go in
using that country's language?

00:07:12.641 --> 00:07:13.558
I was feeling good

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.602
because I thought
I finally got a hit yesterday,

00:07:15.644 --> 00:07:17.270
but it just turned out
to be some normal,

00:07:17.312 --> 00:07:20.774
yet incredibly
melodramatic girl.

00:07:20.815 --> 00:07:22.943
I'm out. I've got
a lot of work to get done

00:07:22.984 --> 00:07:24.402
if you haven't noticed.

00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:39.960
Well, that's interesting.

00:07:40.001 --> 00:07:42.128
I'm headed toward
the Meiji Shrine.

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:43.505
And that got me thinking,

00:07:43.546 --> 00:07:45.215
maybe she disappeared to Japan

00:07:45.256 --> 00:07:48.635
so that she could
check out what you were up to.

00:07:48.677 --> 00:07:50.637
She's my mother?

00:07:51.846 --> 00:07:53.515
[EMI]
Weird.

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:55.642
Guess she's not at the shrine.

00:07:58.228 --> 00:08:01.356
[EMI]
A hospital. My mom is in there?

00:08:01.856 --> 00:08:04.067
[RIHO] Pardon me,
but is that you, Yusa?

00:08:04.109 --> 00:08:05.986
Huh? What the--?

00:08:06.027 --> 00:08:07.696
Wait, Mrs. Sasaki?

00:08:07.737 --> 00:08:09.531
I thought that was you.

00:08:09.572 --> 00:08:12.450
Any chance you came
here to see her as well?

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:14.202
"To see her"? What?

00:08:14.244 --> 00:08:16.121
[RIHO] If you have
a few minutes to spare,

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:19.165
I'd appreciate it
if you stopped by.

00:08:25.463 --> 00:08:27.173
She's in here.

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:39.436
Let's do this thing!

00:08:39.477 --> 00:08:40.770
All right.

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:48.111
Certainly no shortage
of options in this place!

00:08:48.153 --> 00:08:50.238
New plan, you
gotta stick with Suzuno.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.364
Why might that be?

00:08:51.406 --> 00:08:54.451
Just think about it.
What did she say her budget was?

00:08:54.492 --> 00:08:57.704
[ASHIYA] I believe she had the
gall to say 70 thousand yen.

00:08:57.746 --> 00:08:58.830
[RIKA]
Bingo!

00:08:58.872 --> 00:09:01.374
Both of you need to go
to the same salesperson.

00:09:01.416 --> 00:09:04.335
Say you'd only be willing
to buy the two TVs together.

00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:06.838
They'll look for stuff
in her price range, and...

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.256
Of course, I see!

00:09:08.298 --> 00:09:11.342
We'll be sure to land
a bigger discount!

00:09:11.384 --> 00:09:13.094
Thank you for your genius work!

you been standing there?

Why must I drink tea with you?

00:10:03.686 --> 00:10:05.438
Just be friendly for once.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.983
We gotta drink something to
celebrate our purchases.

00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:11.694
Hey.
Your thoughts on those two?

00:10:11.736 --> 00:10:14.864
You mean Alciel
and the good Rika?

00:10:14.906 --> 00:10:18.701
She looks very nice
while he looks painfully dull.

00:10:18.743 --> 00:10:21.329
Rika put much more effort
into her appearance.

00:10:21.371 --> 00:10:24.582
You see it, too. She jumped
on his invite and got dolled up.

00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:26.543
It's so obvious.

00:10:26.584 --> 00:10:28.002
[SUZUNO]
Goodness, Maou.

00:10:28.044 --> 00:10:30.171
Do you mean to imply...

00:10:30.213 --> 00:10:34.050
...that Rika has
romantic feelings for Alciel?

00:10:34.092 --> 00:10:35.885
Yeah. When I asked her about it,

00:10:35.927 --> 00:10:37.387
she screamed and fell on the--

00:10:38.596 --> 00:10:40.890
How did you phrase
the question, you menace?

00:10:40.932 --> 00:10:44.936
Gimme a break, all I asked
was if she's in love with him!

00:10:44.978 --> 00:10:46.271
[SUZUNO] Yet again,
you've proven yourself

00:10:46.312 --> 00:10:47.689
an enemy of womankind

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:50.525
whose body lacks a
single empathetic bone!

00:10:52.527 --> 00:10:54.737
She's nothing
like our good Chiho.

00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:56.197
What is our next step?

00:10:56.239 --> 00:10:58.867
Emilia and I could
rewrite her memories.

00:10:58.908 --> 00:11:00.702
Huh?

00:11:00.743 --> 00:11:03.413
[SUZUNO] Chiho is deeply
ingrained in our situation.

00:11:03.454 --> 00:11:06.457
She knows who we are
yet remains by our side.

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:08.710
She has long readied
herself for dismay.

00:11:08.751 --> 00:11:11.087
Rika is clueless.

00:11:11.129 --> 00:11:13.131
She doesn't know who Alciel is.

00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:15.341
Falling for him would
only lead her to ruin.

00:11:15.383 --> 00:11:16.843
Jeez, the drama.

00:11:16.885 --> 00:11:18.386
Their contact should stop here.

00:11:18.428 --> 00:11:21.181
We can't allow
this to go any further.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.642
It doesn't have
to be so tragic, y'know.

00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:26.227
Satan has a plan.

00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:27.103
[SUZUNO]
Go on.

00:11:27.145 --> 00:11:28.521
We tell the truth!

00:11:28.563 --> 00:11:30.732
In terms that she can
understand, we say,

00:11:30.773 --> 00:11:34.694
"Hey, yo, check it, Rika, we're
demons from another world."

00:11:34.736 --> 00:11:36.529
If that scares
her away from Ashiya,

00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:39.032
you and Emi will
be relieved, yeah?

00:11:39.073 --> 00:11:41.743
But if she still has feelings
for him after that?

00:11:41.784 --> 00:11:44.996
I bet she'd be willing
to accept the consequences.

00:11:45.038 --> 00:11:48.249
And if we're honest with her,
she won't have to suffer alone.

00:11:48.291 --> 00:11:49.542
No! That's absurd.

00:11:49.584 --> 00:11:53.004
Why would we involve
more humans from this world?

00:11:53.046 --> 00:11:55.798
[MAOU] The second Emi
and I landed in Tokyo,

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.636
involving the people here
became inevitable.

00:11:59.677 --> 00:12:02.639
Emi brought Rika into
our lives a long time ago.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.558
She unintentionally
made a friend at work.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.769
I can't say whether
that's good or bad.

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:10.688
Just know I'm not asking you
to tell her your secrets.

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.524
I'm asking you to be
a little more open-minded.

00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:14.859
Uh!

00:12:15.485 --> 00:12:19.989
And just a quick reminder, none
of us can operate as an island.

00:12:20.031 --> 00:12:22.200
Everyone needs
shoulders to lean on.

00:12:22.242 --> 00:12:23.034
[SUZUNO]
Remove your hand!

00:12:23.076 --> 00:12:26.955
I'm open-minded, just more
careful than you and Emilia!

00:12:26.996 --> 00:12:27.956
I can't tell.

00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:31.376
So, do you and Maou consider
yourselves friends with Suzuno?

00:12:34.087 --> 00:12:37.048
Well, we shouldn't,
in all honesty.

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:39.384
It's a complicated tale.

00:12:39.425 --> 00:12:40.760
But I imagine the time will come

00:12:40.802 --> 00:12:43.888
for us to relay it
to you soon enough.

00:12:46.224 --> 00:12:49.936
For today, why don't you bring
home some pamphlets?

00:12:49.978 --> 00:12:51.354
You already got the TV.

00:12:51.396 --> 00:12:54.482
You can hold off on the phone
until next time, right?

00:12:54.524 --> 00:12:57.485
That's true.
I suppose I'm in no huge rush.

00:12:57.527 --> 00:13:00.238
Hey, if you want,
I'll come back with 'ya!

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.115
I'd love nothing more!

00:13:05.451 --> 00:13:07.620
--[glass breaking]
--Huh?

00:13:07.662 --> 00:13:09.122
What the hell happened here?

00:13:09.163 --> 00:13:12.000
I was watching the TVs and
all the screens went white!

00:13:12.041 --> 00:13:14.335
Then the LCDs shattered!

00:13:14.377 --> 00:13:17.005
Ashiya, I think
this could get ugly.

00:13:17.046 --> 00:13:19.590
Go ahead and take Rika home.

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:21.217
I vow to keep her safe.

00:13:21.259 --> 00:13:22.802
My place is a complete wreck.

00:13:22.844 --> 00:13:24.095
I'm not ready.

00:13:24.137 --> 00:13:26.139
This is too fast!

00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:30.852
Who could've done this?
Barbariccia?

00:13:30.893 --> 00:13:34.188
I don't know. We should
get back to Urushihara.

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:35.773
Can you call Emi?

00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:38.276
I'm gonna tell Chi
to steer clear for a little.

00:13:38.318 --> 00:13:40.820
[phone rings]

00:13:40.862 --> 00:13:42.196
Emilia?

00:13:42.238 --> 00:13:44.115
[EMI]
Bel. It's Chiho!

00:13:44.157 --> 00:13:46.284
I think she has some
kind of magic poisoning.

00:13:46.326 --> 00:13:49.787
Whatever's going on,
she's gone totally comatose!

00:14:00.173 --> 00:14:03.009
Thank you.
I'm glad you're all here.

00:14:03.051 --> 00:14:05.720
Of course.
You know what happened to her?

00:14:07.096 --> 00:14:09.682
[RIHO] I came home
around dinnertime last night.

00:14:09.724 --> 00:14:12.185
Chiho was lying on
the living room sofa.

00:14:12.226 --> 00:14:14.812
I figured she was
just taking a nap.

00:14:14.854 --> 00:14:17.440
But for some reason,
she wouldn't wake up.

00:14:17.482 --> 00:14:19.567
I called her name and shook her.

00:14:19.609 --> 00:14:21.402
I even tried slapping her.

00:14:21.444 --> 00:14:23.363
And when she didn't
pop up and yell at me,

00:14:23.404 --> 00:14:26.199
I knew something was wrong.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.951
And that's when I had
to call the ambulance.

00:14:28.993 --> 00:14:30.328
Good thing is, she's stable.

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.288
But none of the
EMT's or the doctors

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.290
could say what's
going on with her.

00:14:34.332 --> 00:14:36.334
Her life isn't in any danger.

00:14:36.376 --> 00:14:37.835
She's here,
so they can run tests

00:14:37.877 --> 00:14:39.921
and figure out
why she's in a coma.

00:14:45.927 --> 00:14:48.888
[EMI] I was out letting myself
be guided by the shard's light.

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:52.100
And it brought me
to the hospital.

00:14:52.141 --> 00:14:53.267
[ASHIYA]
But you have no way of knowing

00:14:53.309 --> 00:14:56.521
what in this building it was
specifically guiding you toward?

00:14:56.562 --> 00:14:57.897
[EMI]
Exactly.

00:14:57.939 --> 00:15:00.108
It could be that someone
is hiding a piece of Yesod.

00:15:00.149 --> 00:15:02.151
I'm not gonna sit here and
act like I totally understand

00:15:02.193 --> 00:15:03.528
how it works. I mean--

00:15:03.569 --> 00:15:05.071
[RIHO] Would you mind
helping me out a bit?

00:15:05.113 --> 00:15:05.947
Yes, ma'am?

00:15:05.988 --> 00:15:08.282
I'm afraid that I need
to step out for a minute.

00:15:08.324 --> 00:15:10.660
I asked the nurse
to stay with Chiho.

00:15:10.701 --> 00:15:12.453
But could you check on her, too?

00:15:12.495 --> 00:15:14.122
Sure.

00:15:16.541 --> 00:15:17.542
I've got it!

00:15:17.583 --> 00:15:20.253
You got what?
I thought you were doodling.

00:15:20.294 --> 00:15:22.296
Have you figured out
a way we can help Chi?

00:15:22.338 --> 00:15:24.382
Though my math skills
are quite rusty,

00:15:24.424 --> 00:15:26.426
I reached deep into my mind.

00:15:26.467 --> 00:15:27.718
I've got it.

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:28.970
Well, spit it out.

00:15:29.011 --> 00:15:30.471
In good Chiho's body,

00:15:30.513 --> 00:15:33.141
I could clearly pick up
on residual magic.

00:15:33.182 --> 00:15:35.017
You could sense
that too, couldn't you?

00:15:35.059 --> 00:15:36.561
[EMI]
Mm.

00:15:36.602 --> 00:15:41.607
I propose, the magic is
being generated in her body.

00:15:41.649 --> 00:15:44.110
I gave her a bit of celestial
force to gauge her capacity

00:15:44.152 --> 00:15:46.529
for reception of the stuff.

00:15:46.571 --> 00:15:49.449
Based on that data and the
amount of magic in her body,

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:51.409
she should recover.

00:15:51.451 --> 00:15:54.203
My force will quicken
the magic's neutralization.

00:15:54.245 --> 00:15:56.581
Therefore, Chiho
should wake up soon.

00:15:56.622 --> 00:15:59.417
Hold up!
Chi is just a normal human!

00:15:59.459 --> 00:16:02.170
She can't generate magic.

00:16:02.211 --> 00:16:05.381
[SUZUNO] Perhaps a celestial
force-based sonar pulse hit her.

00:16:05.423 --> 00:16:08.843
And her life force was
transmuted into magical energy.

00:16:08.885 --> 00:16:10.470
That's my current theory.

00:16:10.511 --> 00:16:14.515
The purpose of said sonar
remains a mystery to me.

00:16:14.557 --> 00:16:17.018
You say her life force
turned to magic?

00:16:17.059 --> 00:16:18.936
Can such a thing happen?

00:16:20.855 --> 00:16:22.398
Crap, Chi!

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.941
My liege!

00:16:27.195 --> 00:16:28.237
The disarray of your hair

00:16:28.279 --> 00:16:30.948
is characteristic of a
celestial sonar sweep.

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:32.783
It is a defense mechanism.

00:16:32.825 --> 00:16:35.119
Your bodies are merely
resisting the force.

00:16:35.161 --> 00:16:35.995
For real?

00:16:36.037 --> 00:16:37.246
I wonder.

00:16:37.288 --> 00:16:39.415
Who would be using such power?

00:16:39.457 --> 00:16:40.583
We should split up.

00:16:40.625 --> 00:16:43.127
Emi and I, we'll go to Chi.

00:16:43.169 --> 00:16:44.712
You two search the hospital.

00:16:44.754 --> 00:16:46.714
Look for anything
weird going on.

00:16:46.756 --> 00:16:48.591
--[SUZUNO] Mm.
--Understood, Sire.

00:16:52.261 --> 00:16:54.639
Who could be causing
all of this mess?

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:55.556
[URUSHIHARA]
The watcher.

00:16:55.598 --> 00:16:56.474
[ASHIYA, SUZUNO]
Huh?

00:16:56.516 --> 00:16:57.892
[ASHIYA]
It's about time you showed up!

00:16:57.934 --> 00:16:59.435
Hop off, man.

00:16:59.477 --> 00:17:01.771
I was dealing with
the winged wack job.

00:17:01.812 --> 00:17:03.814
He paid me a visit today.

00:17:03.856 --> 00:17:07.902
Who is this "winged wack job?"
You mean Gabriel?

00:17:07.944 --> 00:17:09.153
What did he want?

00:17:09.195 --> 00:17:12.156
[URUSHIHARA] I'll explain
when we meet up with Maou.

00:17:12.198 --> 00:17:16.327
But, TLDR, it appears the
watcher has entered the fray.

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:17.912
On the news?

00:17:17.954 --> 00:17:21.541
They're saying LCD's across the
greater Tokyo metropolitan area

00:17:21.582 --> 00:17:24.168
have been exploding like crazy.

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:26.504
[ASHIYA]
It's that widespread?

00:17:26.546 --> 00:17:28.130
The watcher's using
TV broadcasts

00:17:28.172 --> 00:17:29.632
to put out his signal.

00:17:29.674 --> 00:17:32.760
As for Chiho, guess
she got caught in the blast.

00:17:32.802 --> 00:17:35.179
[MAOU]
That smarmy wack job is back?

00:17:35.221 --> 00:17:37.598
Did he do this to Chi?

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:41.102
It would be way easier if ol'
Gabey was behind this, but no.

00:17:41.143 --> 00:17:43.396
He isn't worried
about us anymore.

00:17:43.437 --> 00:17:44.730
He's done with Yesod.

00:17:44.772 --> 00:17:46.274
Apparently, he was
pulled off of the case

00:17:46.315 --> 00:17:48.859
'cause he kept screwing up.

00:17:48.901 --> 00:17:52.405
Now he's out looking for
"Demon King Satan's treasures."

00:17:52.446 --> 00:17:54.865
Why would he be
fixated on that junk?

00:17:54.907 --> 00:17:56.534
Do you know what they are?

00:17:56.576 --> 00:17:59.620
[MAOU]
I mean, I have a few guesses.

00:17:59.662 --> 00:18:01.163
But I can't come up
with anything Heaven

00:18:01.205 --> 00:18:03.499
would be that desperate for.

00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:05.793
[URUSHIHARA]
Yeah. I'm with Maou on this one.

00:18:05.835 --> 00:18:08.546
Also, a new angel spawned in.

00:18:08.588 --> 00:18:10.631
I bet he's here on
Gabriel's behalf.

00:18:10.673 --> 00:18:12.008
He's called the Watcher.

00:18:12.049 --> 00:18:13.050
The Watcher.

00:18:13.092 --> 00:18:15.761
He who monitors the
actions of all other angels.

00:18:15.803 --> 00:18:17.722
Raguel the Watcher,
am I correct?

00:18:17.763 --> 00:18:20.766
Mm. It's not like this dude is
particularly high-ranking,

00:18:20.808 --> 00:18:22.184
or anything like that.

00:18:22.226 --> 00:18:23.686
But he is tough.

00:18:23.728 --> 00:18:26.188
And he has some
special privileges.

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:28.733
He can declare final judgment.

00:18:28.774 --> 00:18:30.359
[SUZUNO]
He evaluates the angels' actions

00:18:30.401 --> 00:18:32.987
and punishes them
as he deems appropriate.

00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:35.656
More often than not,
this involves Falls.

00:18:35.698 --> 00:18:36.824
But, hold on a moment.

00:18:36.866 --> 00:18:38.659
Even if Raguel
was here just now

00:18:38.701 --> 00:18:41.662
and spread celestial
sonar via broadcast,

00:18:41.704 --> 00:18:44.290
why was Chiho the
only one affected by it?

00:18:44.332 --> 00:18:45.708
Remember a while back?

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:48.169
Her house was the
epicenter of that pulse.

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:51.672
Yeah, that's when Albert
was looking for me!

00:18:51.714 --> 00:18:54.508
I guess that somehow made her
more physically vulnerable

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:56.636
to sonar than the other humans.

00:18:56.677 --> 00:18:59.639
We've still yet to dive into
a larger part of this mystery.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:01.140
What's he searching for?

00:19:01.182 --> 00:19:03.100
The angels don't want the Devil.

00:19:03.142 --> 00:19:07.438
And I doubt this is about the
shards of Yesod or Better Half.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:10.483
I have a feeling
they're after Lailah.

00:19:10.524 --> 00:19:11.901
My mother.

00:19:11.942 --> 00:19:13.778
Huh?

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:15.404
Chiho?

00:19:15.446 --> 00:19:16.238
[MAOU]
Mrs. Sasaki!

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:18.991
I, uh, I heard there
was some incident.

00:19:19.033 --> 00:19:20.493
Chiho. Is she--?

00:19:20.534 --> 00:19:21.994
[MAOU]
Don't worry, ma'am.

00:19:22.036 --> 00:19:24.038
Same as you left her.

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.123
[RIHO]
Thank goodness.

00:19:26.165 --> 00:19:29.669
[MAOU] Seems like things have
calmed down for the most part.

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:32.129
Well, uh,
I think we'll head out.

00:19:33.422 --> 00:19:36.300
[EMI] What do Raguel's "final
judgments" typically consist of?

00:19:36.342 --> 00:19:38.135
[URUSHIHARA] Usually, they'll
force the angel in question

00:19:38.177 --> 00:19:40.513
to Fall, like I did.

00:19:40.554 --> 00:19:43.224
Raguel and Sariel
worked as a pair.

00:19:43.265 --> 00:19:44.975
They would banish angels.

00:19:45.017 --> 00:19:46.727
Strip 'em of immortality--

00:19:46.769 --> 00:19:47.603
And then what?

00:19:47.645 --> 00:19:49.146
I need you to dial it back.

00:19:49.188 --> 00:19:51.107
I fully realize that
I've never met her,

00:19:51.148 --> 00:19:52.733
but this chick is my actual,
flesh and blood mother,

00:19:52.775 --> 00:19:53.609
you know!

00:19:53.651 --> 00:19:54.694
So... yeah!

00:19:54.735 --> 00:19:56.028
She can't get hurt!

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:58.531
Not until I meet her and
hear what she has to say!

00:19:58.572 --> 00:20:02.118
So... I need you to tell me
what happens next!

00:20:02.159 --> 00:20:04.120
[URUSHIHARA]
Well, sometimes they get killed.

00:20:04.161 --> 00:20:06.539
And is Sariel working
with this guy?

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:08.958
[MAOU]
I seriously doubt it.

00:20:08.999 --> 00:20:11.293
He's way more concerned
with his one-sided love affair

00:20:11.335 --> 00:20:13.462
than with Heaven.

00:20:13.504 --> 00:20:17.299
[coughs] If he's not here
to collect his partner,

00:20:17.341 --> 00:20:19.260
I have no clue
what he's planning.

00:20:19.301 --> 00:20:20.678
But it must be big.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.138
Raguel wouldn't
jump to another world

00:20:22.179 --> 00:20:25.307
just to declare
a Fall for one angel.

00:20:25.349 --> 00:20:26.767
Okay. If that's the truth,

00:20:26.809 --> 00:20:30.646
then I say we put the screws
to this goody-two-shoes angel.

00:20:30.688 --> 00:20:32.565
Sire, I don't understand.

00:20:32.606 --> 00:20:36.652
Why would you bother to
meddle in the affairs of angels?

00:20:36.694 --> 00:20:38.028
I don't give a damn
if these angels

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:40.156
are beating each other up.

00:20:40.197 --> 00:20:42.283
But a candidate for future
general of my army

00:20:42.324 --> 00:20:44.326
got caught in the crossfire.

00:20:44.368 --> 00:20:46.746
So you can bet
your balls I'm meddling.

00:20:46.787 --> 00:20:49.665
My liege.
I will stand at your side.

00:20:49.707 --> 00:20:52.334
Assisting in the defense
of my future colleague?

00:20:52.376 --> 00:20:53.961
It's an honor.

00:20:54.003 --> 00:20:56.088
You guys! Please, listen.

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:57.590
We're doing this for Chi.

00:20:57.631 --> 00:21:00.634
We can't let him get away
with making her suffer.

00:21:00.676 --> 00:21:01.469
Will you help?

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:03.304
Yeah, sure, I'm not busy.

00:21:03.345 --> 00:21:04.930
And I fully agree.

00:21:04.972 --> 00:21:07.183
I owe Chiho a couple of favors.

00:21:07.224 --> 00:21:08.017
Feel free to die

00:21:08.058 --> 00:21:11.145
before you ever mention Chiho
being your general again.

00:21:11.187 --> 00:21:12.730
But I'd be willing
to help you dorks

00:21:12.772 --> 00:21:14.607
if it means keeping her safe.

00:21:14.648 --> 00:21:16.525
And he might know about my mom.

00:21:16.567 --> 00:21:19.820
For the sake of good Chiho,
I will choose to cooperate.

00:21:19.862 --> 00:21:23.073
Please note that this will end
after our mission is completed.

00:21:23.115 --> 00:21:24.992
[ALAS RAMUS]
Chi-mi?

00:21:25.034 --> 00:21:27.495
Where did Chi-mi go?

00:21:27.536 --> 00:21:29.914
Look who's awake!

00:21:29.955 --> 00:21:31.874
Do you want to help
Mama protect Chiho, too?

00:21:31.916 --> 00:21:34.084
Uh-huh, I wanna protec her!

00:21:34.126 --> 00:21:36.754
Chi-mi's the bestest!

00:21:36.796 --> 00:21:38.339
You ready to help us?

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:39.507
Yeah!

00:21:41.175 --> 00:21:44.428
Where could Raguel be?
Any ideas?

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:45.346
Yeah, two.

00:21:45.387 --> 00:21:47.973
Same here.
Must be on the same page.

00:21:48.015 --> 00:21:51.310
Because he's using TV signals
to boost his sonar,

00:21:51.352 --> 00:21:53.521
there are only
two places he could be.

00:22:00.444 --> 00:22:02.446
[LAILAH]
Hello there, Miss Sasaki.

00:22:02.488 --> 00:22:06.283
Thanks to your powerful friends,
you'll get to return home soon.

00:22:10.913 --> 00:22:12.832
[LAILAH]
You, who unite forces

00:22:12.873 --> 00:22:16.710
that by rights
should be opposing.

00:22:16.752 --> 00:22:18.128
There's a chance

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:21.423
that one day you shall become
the mother of a new Daath.
