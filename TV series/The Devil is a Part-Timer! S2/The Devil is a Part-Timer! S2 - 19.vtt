already made her way

At this rate, we're gonna need
to dig a demon-sized grave.

It sounds like he wants us here.

If you would cease

Clearly you have
some other objective here.

00:03:17.854 --> 00:03:21.027
However, you need to release
the school at once.

If you disobey,

00:03:22.905 --> 00:03:26.538

If I do kill you,

it will be once I've determined
beyond a doubt

00:03:38.394 --> 00:03:39.648
that you have brought evil

upon these people
and their world.

00:03:43.071 --> 00:03:45.826
My time in Japan
has opened my mind.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.791
Just because someone is
a heretic, or even a demon,

00:03:48.874 --> 00:03:51.546
that does not mean
their murder is justified.

You will regret your sympathy.

00:03:57.934 --> 00:04:00.313
But by then, your only choice
will be to suffer.

00:04:00.731 --> 00:04:03.027
I would much rather
regret my sympathy

00:04:03.111 --> 00:04:05.700
than I would lose
the crux of my fate.

00:04:05.783 --> 00:04:07.704
And I will not be left
to suffer.

I was cool enough to not only
undo the storm damage,

but to erase the last hour

Yeah.

himself Gabriel snatched 'em.

Yes.

why he would kidnap Ashiya.

Before they beamed off,

00:19:29.587 --> 00:19:31.842
Ashiya gave me
a message to relay.

He's waiting
at "The Gates of Hell,"

of the time for his research.

Ashiya was looking into it.

It's called "The Gates of Hell".

It's an art museum in Ueno.

it's well worth trying.
