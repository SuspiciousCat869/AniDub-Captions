It sounds like he wants us here.

Clearly you have
some other objective here.

However, you need to release
the school at once.

If you disobey,

00:03:22.905 --> 00:03:26.538

If I do kill you,

it will be once I've determined
beyond a doubt

00:03:38.394 --> 00:03:39.648
that you have brought evil

upon these people
and their world.

00:03:43.071 --> 00:03:45.826
My time in Japan
has opened my mind.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.791
Just because someone is
a heretic, or even a demon,

00:03:48.874 --> 00:03:51.546
that does not mean
their murder is justified.

You will regret your sympathy.

But by then, your only choice
will be to suffer.

00:04:00.731 --> 00:04:03.027
I would much rather
regret my sympathy

00:04:03.111 --> 00:04:05.700
than I would lose
the crux of my fate.

00:04:05.783 --> 00:04:07.704
And I will not be left
to suffer.

But I don't want you to be
all creepy about it.

00:08:48.097 --> 00:08:49.391
I hate to break it to you,

00:08:49.474 --> 00:08:51.311
but you can't be
my new Earth Dad.

00:08:51.395 --> 00:08:53.775
That's super messed up
of you to even suggest.

00:08:54.276 --> 00:08:56.656
I suggested no such thing.

00:08:56.739 --> 00:08:58.033

If you can do that much,
I promise to keep you safe.

Oh, wow.

00:09:07.093 --> 00:09:08.847
I guess you promise
to stay by my side

You really hadn't
put that one together yet?

That's something
you tell a girl right away!

Hey, you hid under your hat!

I'm handing over my body

to the literal devil.

00:09:58.947 --> 00:10:00.784
Sorry about this one, Mommy.

But Mister Urushihara...

Hush! Under no circumstances
will you get the shard!

I have you in a corner!

Your only escape
from me now is death!

00:10:39.862 --> 00:10:41.239
I'll steal her shard,

and I'll swallow it whole
to keep it from you.

Do you truly believe

that having to disembowel you
would serve as a deterrent?

If that is my fate, so be it!

that I'm just gonna be

You have nothing to gain
by your treachery.

They have allied with villains.

I was cool enough to not only
undo the storm damage,

but to erase the last hour

Yeah.

himself Gabriel snatched 'em.

Yes.

why he would kidnap Ashiya.

Before they beamed off,

00:19:29.587 --> 00:19:31.842
Ashiya gave me
a message to relay.

He's waiting
at "The Gates of Hell,"

of the time for his research.

Ashiya was looking into it.

It's called "The Gates of Hell".

It's an art museum in Ueno.

it's well worth trying.
