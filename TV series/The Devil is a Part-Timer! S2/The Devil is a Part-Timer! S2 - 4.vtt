WEBVTT

00:00:09.968 --> 00:00:12.971
[MAOU] Make sure Chi
gets home safe and sound.

00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:15.224
Yes, Sire,
I shall return shortly.

00:00:15.265 --> 00:00:16.099
[MAOU]
Great.

00:00:16.141 --> 00:00:18.977
Bye, Chi-mi! See you soon!

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.729
Bye! See ya.

00:00:22.397 --> 00:00:25.692
Why does your grand plan involve
me sleeping in this hellhole?

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:28.362
If things get intense when
Gabriel shows back up,

00:00:28.403 --> 00:00:30.489
I'll have the hero on
my side to kick some ass

00:00:30.531 --> 00:00:32.407
and take some names, amiright?

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:34.868
Are you kidding,
or are you just stupid?

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.204
I'm not asking
you to be my ally.

00:00:37.246 --> 00:00:39.456
I think you need to change
your mindset a little.

00:00:39.498 --> 00:00:41.750
Just think of it as a
big ol' favor for the rugrat,

00:00:41.792 --> 00:00:43.085
and not for me.

00:00:43.126 --> 00:00:45.921
[EMI] Yeah.
I guess I can do that much.

00:00:45.963 --> 00:00:48.799
I'm getting real sick of begging
you to help all the time.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.592
Have you no sense of charity?

00:00:50.634 --> 00:00:52.719
I'm not showing charity
to the freakin' Devil!

00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:56.265
You gotta cut
the pity party crap!

00:00:56.306 --> 00:00:57.933
Clap?

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.283
Been any trouble
on the homefront?

00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:39.910
[URUSHIHARA]
Untwist your tits.

00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:42.496
Heaven's hunk of meat
isn't coming till tomorrow.

00:02:42.537 --> 00:02:43.955
[SUZUNO]
How is Chiho faring?

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:44.915
Not too well.

00:02:44.956 --> 00:02:47.709
She worried for His Majesty
the whole walk home.

00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:48.835
I'm sure.

00:02:48.877 --> 00:02:49.836
But I believe it's critical

00:02:49.878 --> 00:02:52.381
that we keep her far
removed from the matter.

00:02:52.422 --> 00:02:53.423
I agree.

00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:55.175
And I've instructed her as such.

00:02:55.217 --> 00:02:56.885
She isn't to set foot
in the Devil's Castle

00:02:56.927 --> 00:02:58.804
until this is settled.

00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:01.056
I don't get the
room assignments.

00:03:01.098 --> 00:03:02.557
In case something goes wrong,

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:06.395
I wanted to give Alas Ramus
one last night with you.

00:03:06.436 --> 00:03:08.814
Way to bring the room down.

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:11.358
[MAOU] We don't know
what'll happen tomorrow.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.820
If she is a Sephirah--a
shard of Yesod--

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:17.906
I imagine the stakes
are pretty high.

00:03:17.948 --> 00:03:20.826
[SUZUNO]
Well, in the simplest of terms,

00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:23.203
the Tree of Sephirah,
or The Tree of life,

00:03:23.245 --> 00:03:26.164
resides in Heaven and
continuously creates the world.

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:27.624
Huh? Our world?

00:03:27.666 --> 00:03:30.085
Indeed.
The tree houses ten fruits,

00:03:30.127 --> 00:03:31.628
which are called the
"sephiroth."

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.673
These fruits correspond to
components that shape our lives.

00:03:34.715 --> 00:03:37.050
For example:
the ninth sephirah, Yesod,

00:03:37.092 --> 00:03:39.845
governs the astral world
and our connection to it.

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:44.349
Its number is nine, its metal is
silver, its planet is the moon,

00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:48.437
its color is purple, and its
guardian angel is Gabriel.

00:03:48.478 --> 00:03:49.980
Too much, too fast.

00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:51.773
Just gimme,
like, three buzzwords

00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:54.526
Was that really too complex
for a former archangel?

00:03:54.568 --> 00:03:57.696
Be nice to him,
he hasn't studied in a while!

00:03:57.738 --> 00:04:00.240
At any rate,
if we believe these legends,

00:04:00.282 --> 00:04:03.201
then Gabriel's point
is quite justified.

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:06.121
One might worry for the
components which Yesod controls,

00:04:06.163 --> 00:04:08.206
they could be in grave danger.

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:11.710
So he needs Alas Ramus back
to maintain universal balance.

00:04:11.752 --> 00:04:13.628
I suppose he's
just doing his job.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:14.796
Oh, jeez.

00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:16.840
Guess that means
the right thing for us to do

00:04:16.882 --> 00:04:18.550
is to send her back home.

00:04:18.592 --> 00:04:22.345
[SUZUNO] Only if we choose
to believe the legends.

00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:25.348
It so happens that we lack any
and all physical evidence that

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.143
the Tree of Life is sustaining
the world as we know it.

00:04:28.185 --> 00:04:31.104
One tree dooming a
planet seems preposterous.

00:04:31.146 --> 00:04:33.690
Okay. Someone put
on their business pants.

00:04:33.732 --> 00:04:35.400
I highly doubt keeping the child

00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:37.402
would unleash any astral mayhem.

00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:39.237
But the angel wants the shard.

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:42.741
And unfortunately, we aren't in
a place to resist his demands.

00:04:42.783 --> 00:04:45.619
The whole situation
is downright absurd.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.496
I'm not sure what to do.

00:04:48.497 --> 00:04:49.331
[EMI]
For real?

00:04:49.372 --> 00:04:52.209
Are you actually planning
to pick a fight with Gabriel?

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:53.960
Well, if that's my only option,

00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:56.296
I'm gonna do what
any good parent would do.

00:04:56.338 --> 00:04:59.174
Since when is the Devil
so capable of compassion?

00:04:59.216 --> 00:05:00.467
Gimme a break.

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:02.677
I'm literally reaping
what I sowed.

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:04.095
But when I think
about all the people

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:06.264
who died during my invasion,

00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:07.891
I'm sure that tons of
them risked their lives

00:05:07.933 --> 00:05:09.851
to save their kids.

00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:11.520
If they were willing to do that,

00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:13.647
it seems fair that the Devil
should grow some balls

00:05:13.688 --> 00:05:15.440
and do the same.

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:17.484
You realize things
sound way less profound

00:05:17.526 --> 00:05:19.653
when you use the word "balls"?

00:05:19.694 --> 00:05:21.196
Yeah, whatever.

00:05:21.238 --> 00:05:22.656
Let's just go to bed.

00:05:22.697 --> 00:05:24.032
--[ALAS RAMUS] Yay!
--[EMI] Sure.

00:05:24.074 --> 00:05:26.159
Let's... go to bed
with you right now?

00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:29.579
[ALAS RAMUS]
Mama sleep with me! Yay!

00:05:35.502 --> 00:05:38.004
Pardon me.
But I have a question.

00:05:38.046 --> 00:05:40.507
[ASHIYA] No, I will not be
paying you rent for the night.

00:05:40.549 --> 00:05:41.883
[SUZUNO] The only
person cheap enough

00:05:41.925 --> 00:05:44.553
to ask such questions is you.

00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:46.930
I'm curious about
the Devil's Army.

00:05:46.972 --> 00:05:51.852
What spurred your interests
into world domination?

00:05:51.893 --> 00:05:55.021
I just can't comprehend
that desire any longer.

00:05:56.314 --> 00:05:57.524
You know what I like?

00:05:57.566 --> 00:05:58.775
Refrigerators.

00:05:58.817 --> 00:05:59.901
Huh?

00:05:59.943 --> 00:06:01.611
Each time you crack it open,

00:06:01.653 --> 00:06:04.406
your produce and dairy
are perfectly preserved.

00:06:04.447 --> 00:06:07.409
If your supplies run low,
you can simply go buy more.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.870
Then you can go home and feast.

00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:11.580
In a way,
we invaded Ente Isla

00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:13.373
in pursuit of
something like that.

00:06:13.415 --> 00:06:17.294
As you know,
we'd do anything for it.

00:06:17.335 --> 00:06:18.879
If you don't understand,

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.589
well, that's quite
all right with me.

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:24.342
If every last one of us works
diligently, we'll return soon.

00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:25.468
And we'll reach our dream.

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.470
Did you hear that?
We'll work!

00:06:29.097 --> 00:06:32.350
[URUSHIHARA] Maybe you should
work on your people skills.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.854
You leech.

00:06:39.274 --> 00:06:40.942
Whatcha lookin at?

00:06:40.984 --> 00:06:42.611
[ALAS RAMUS]
Picture!

00:06:42.652 --> 00:06:44.821
You really like that thing, huh?

00:06:44.863 --> 00:06:46.531
Watch out, if you
hold it while you sleep,

00:06:46.573 --> 00:06:48.533
it's gonna get all crumpled up.

00:06:48.575 --> 00:06:50.327
Let's leave it right over here.

00:06:50.368 --> 00:06:52.537
Aw. Huh?

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:53.997
[MAOU]
Okay, lights out.

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:56.833
[MAOU]
Jeez, kid.

00:06:59.294 --> 00:07:01.796
Ah! What the--?
You're way too close!

00:07:01.838 --> 00:07:03.715
Come on, don't flatter yourself.

00:07:03.757 --> 00:07:06.968
It's not my fault, the little
nugget pulled me over here.

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:10.430
Hey, Dada,
can you tell me a story?

00:07:10.472 --> 00:07:11.932
You don't want one from Mama?

00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:14.893
[ALAS RAMUS]
Tomorrow I do.

00:07:14.935 --> 00:07:16.978
Fine. Let me think.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.022
Where'd we leave off yesterday?

00:07:19.064 --> 00:07:21.566
Traveler just met a nice angel.

00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:23.485
Ah, how could I forget?

00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:24.819
You've got a good memory.

00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:26.237
Smarty.

00:07:27.238 --> 00:07:29.366
[MOAU] The traveler was
hurt by evil demons

00:07:29.407 --> 00:07:31.034
and thought it might be the end.

00:07:31.076 --> 00:07:34.204
But a kind angel swooped
down to save him.

00:07:34.245 --> 00:07:36.373
She told the traveler tales
of amazing things

00:07:36.414 --> 00:07:39.250
he'd never heard of before.

00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:41.127
The tallest of mountains.

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:43.463
The bluest of seas.

00:07:43.505 --> 00:07:46.174
Powerful kings
and their knights.

00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:49.344
And delicious food
that made his tummy rumble.

00:07:49.386 --> 00:07:50.929
She spoke of God.

00:07:50.971 --> 00:07:53.932
And the world of the stars.

00:07:53.974 --> 00:07:55.475
Before she had to leave,

00:07:55.517 --> 00:07:58.186
the angel gave the traveler
a good-luck charm.

00:07:58.228 --> 00:08:00.480
As he set out on
his journey once more,

00:08:00.522 --> 00:08:03.566
he made sure
to always keep it safe.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.570
[MAOU] Thanks to all he learned
from the angel's stories,

00:08:07.612 --> 00:08:09.364
and with the power of the charm,

00:08:09.406 --> 00:08:11.908
the traveler would
eventually become king.

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:14.577
Living happily ever after.

00:08:14.619 --> 00:08:15.745
Good night.

00:08:21.209 --> 00:08:23.336
[EMI]
Hey. So what ended up happening

00:08:23.378 --> 00:08:25.714
to the traveler after
he became king?

00:08:27.424 --> 00:08:29.217
Did he ever find
his way back home

00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:32.053
or try to find the
friendly angel again?

00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:33.680
The hell would I know?

00:08:33.722 --> 00:08:34.597
It's not so deep,

00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:36.933
I've been making the
whole thing up every night

00:08:36.975 --> 00:08:38.059
[EMI]
So what?

00:08:38.101 --> 00:08:40.437
Apparently, I'm telling
tomorrow's story.

00:08:40.478 --> 00:08:43.648
I need reference material.

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.025
Why would he
want another country

00:08:45.066 --> 00:08:48.278
when he was already
the king of his own?

00:08:48.319 --> 00:08:52.032
I thought he was supposed
to live happily ever after.

00:08:52.073 --> 00:08:54.993
[MAOU]
Maybe the power made him greedy.

00:08:55.035 --> 00:08:56.745
Huh?

00:08:56.786 --> 00:08:58.788
[MOAU] If Alas Ramus
wants to hear the rest,

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:00.707
I'll figure it out then.

00:09:02.834 --> 00:09:04.419
Wait, Maou!

00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:27.400
Hey. Morning, Sunshine.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.571
Boo.

00:09:32.697 --> 00:09:35.033
Did you really have
to get here so early?

00:09:35.075 --> 00:09:35.909
Hey, now.

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:38.161
Let's use our words
like big boys and girls.

00:09:38.203 --> 00:09:40.205
Says the freakin' home invader.

00:09:40.246 --> 00:09:41.873
Okay, judgy.

00:09:41.915 --> 00:09:44.125
I'm not a bad guy,
and I've been very patient.

00:09:44.167 --> 00:09:47.712
Attacking a sleeping family
is personally a big no-no!

00:09:47.754 --> 00:09:48.963
Aren't I considerate?

00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:51.966
In return, you can drop
the sword and hear me out.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.429
Ah! How dare you poke
my perfectly sculpted neck?!

00:09:56.471 --> 00:09:58.765
It doesn't get any closer to
God's image than this, trust me!

00:09:58.807 --> 00:10:01.726
The hell?
It's five in the morning.

00:10:01.768 --> 00:10:05.230
What's the big--doucher?!

00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:06.773
Hey, there! Good morn'!

00:10:06.815 --> 00:10:09.442
Sorry to disturb
your adorable slumber.

00:10:09.484 --> 00:10:12.028
Leave, or we'll
disturb your face!

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:13.154
Dada.

00:10:13.196 --> 00:10:15.406
Here's the nitty-gritty,
my friends.

00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:17.909
If you won't be cool and
give me the girl and the sword,

00:10:17.951 --> 00:10:21.162
I'm fine taking one
for the time being.

00:10:21.204 --> 00:10:22.330
So, Yesod.

00:10:22.372 --> 00:10:24.207
Not only was the
poor sephirah stolen,

00:10:24.249 --> 00:10:26.417
but it was shattered to bits.

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:28.128
It was my duty to protect it,

00:10:28.169 --> 00:10:31.381
so I must find the pieces,
and trust me, they're all over.

00:10:31.422 --> 00:10:33.258
Here's one, and there's another.

00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:36.010
The sacred sword was made
from a shard of Yesod?

00:10:36.052 --> 00:10:37.262
Amen, sis!

00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:39.389
I mean, haven't you wondered
what that purple crystal

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:41.766
you've been toting
around might be?

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:48.815
Give up, dear, the sword can't
defeat me in its current form.

00:10:48.857 --> 00:10:50.108
[knocking on door]

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:52.485
[ASHIYA] Your Majesty!
Is something the matter?

00:10:52.527 --> 00:10:55.321
Now that I've laid it
all out for you guys.

00:10:55.363 --> 00:10:57.031
Pretty please,
give me what I want.

00:10:57.073 --> 00:11:00.201
[SUZUNO] Why won't the door
open? A magical barrier?

00:11:00.243 --> 00:11:02.871
[ASHIYA]
Say something! Anything, Sire!

00:11:02.912 --> 00:11:05.957
Huh?! What are you doing?

00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:09.836
Come on. Just leave
Alas Ramus alone.

00:11:09.878 --> 00:11:11.504
Dada?

00:11:11.546 --> 00:11:12.547
Not a chance.

00:11:12.589 --> 00:11:15.466
I won't fall for any more
puppy-dog eyes.

00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:18.970
[MAOU] I'm fully prepared
to bargain with you.

00:11:19.012 --> 00:11:21.556
Instead of the child,
take my head.

00:11:21.598 --> 00:11:24.601
Good deal if you ask me.

00:11:24.642 --> 00:11:26.644
[EMI]
Don't be such a moron!

00:11:26.686 --> 00:11:28.688
If anyone gets your head,
it's me!

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.899
Well, excuse me, princess!

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.359
[GABRIEL] Have you considered
marriage counseling?

00:11:33.401 --> 00:11:35.111
We're not married, okay?

00:11:35.153 --> 00:11:37.030
Wow! So in sync!

00:11:37.071 --> 00:11:40.909
Mmkay, since you're the Devil,
why are you hung up on this tot?

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:43.203
I was saved from a
really terrible place.

00:11:43.244 --> 00:11:46.873
Her shard became a
symbol of hope and light.

00:11:46.915 --> 00:11:49.417
Somewhere along the way,
I forgot about that.

00:11:49.459 --> 00:11:52.587
But now that I have her,
I'll keep her!

00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:54.088
That's truly touching.

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:54.923
But she can be--

00:11:54.964 --> 00:11:58.927
Look, I know about the legend
of the ancient King Satan!

00:11:58.968 --> 00:12:00.762
I can't let her go with you.

00:12:00.803 --> 00:12:02.472
I refuse. Come on.

00:12:02.513 --> 00:12:04.057
Let her stay with me.

00:12:04.098 --> 00:12:04.891
Maou?

00:12:04.933 --> 00:12:07.518
[GABRIEL] Well, I've had
a quick change of plans.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.229
I'm obviously a nice guy.

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:13.024
But after what you said, I have
no choice but to employ force.

00:12:13.066 --> 00:12:16.194
[gasping]

00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:17.445
[GABRIEL]
Avert your gaze.

00:12:17.487 --> 00:12:20.281
It's time for me to take out
some demon trash.

00:12:20.323 --> 00:12:21.532
[ALAS RAMUS]
Stop it!

00:12:21.574 --> 00:12:23.576
I hate you, bad guy!

00:12:23.618 --> 00:12:25.828
I'm good, just look at my hair.

00:12:26.788 --> 00:12:28.373
You're a big ol' liar.

00:12:28.414 --> 00:12:30.750
Malkuth told me
everything you did!

00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:33.628
You all became gods
because of your lies!

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:35.713
You took my friends
away from me.

00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:37.423
You locked us up!

00:12:37.465 --> 00:12:41.094
And worse, you were
mean to Mama and Dada!

00:12:41.135 --> 00:12:43.388
I hate you, bad guy!

00:12:47.058 --> 00:12:48.142
Where'd she go?

00:12:48.184 --> 00:12:49.560
Divine Boots of Light!

00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:52.313
[SUZUNO]
The barrier is down. Emilia!

00:12:52.355 --> 00:12:55.316
Sire! Are you all right?

00:12:55.358 --> 00:12:56.901
They all just took off!

00:12:56.943 --> 00:12:58.278
Hold on!

00:12:58.319 --> 00:13:00.697
Where did Emilia
and the child go?

00:13:00.738 --> 00:13:02.657
[EMI]
Get away from my baby!

00:13:02.699 --> 00:13:04.909
[GABRIEL]
Trust me, hun, I'd love to!

00:13:10.873 --> 00:13:12.750
Yeah, must be the drugs.

00:13:15.295 --> 00:13:17.255
[EMI]
Alas Ramus! Are you okay?

00:13:17.297 --> 00:13:19.757
She's great!
I'm the one getting walloped!

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:21.050
Oh! No!

00:13:25.054 --> 00:13:26.973
[EMI]
You'd pull a sword on a toddler?

00:13:27.015 --> 00:13:29.559
I would! Especially if said
toddler is chasing me

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.686
through the sky in a
murderous rampage!

00:13:31.728 --> 00:13:34.731
Careful, Mama!
That sword is real strong!

00:13:34.772 --> 00:13:37.525
So that's Durandal.
Sword of Gabriel.

00:13:37.567 --> 00:13:39.193
You did your research!

00:13:39.235 --> 00:13:40.528
This beauty is super tough

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:42.488
and can slice through
just about anything.

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:44.741
Like butter. Feel me?

00:13:44.782 --> 00:13:46.284
It's actually pretty awesome.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.747
As Yesod's supervisor,

00:13:50.788 --> 00:13:55.084
I refuse to let that shard slip
away from me again.

00:13:55.126 --> 00:13:56.502
I need you, Suzuno.

00:13:56.544 --> 00:13:58.755
Please, take me up there.

00:13:58.796 --> 00:14:00.256
[GABRIEL'S SUBORDINATE A]
You'll stay right here!

00:14:00.298 --> 00:14:02.383
Halt, King Satan!

00:14:02.425 --> 00:14:03.634
These losers.

00:14:03.676 --> 00:14:05.595
You will not impede Gabriel!

00:14:05.636 --> 00:14:08.848
[URUSHIHARA] Do you have any
idea who you're talking to?

00:14:09.766 --> 00:14:12.352
You sure you're in the
position to tell us off?

00:14:12.393 --> 00:14:15.521
Seems like Gabriel needs
to tighten your leashes.

00:14:16.773 --> 00:14:18.483
Get out of his way.

00:14:20.985 --> 00:14:23.279
Wait. What did you do to them?

00:14:23.321 --> 00:14:25.948
Did my best bud Ashiya
forget my whole backstory?

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:28.910
I was the top archangel
before I fell, you know.

00:14:28.951 --> 00:14:31.704
Look at you, you really
are useful sometimes!

00:14:31.746 --> 00:14:33.206
"Sometimes," huh?

00:14:33.247 --> 00:14:34.457
Screw you guys.

00:14:34.499 --> 00:14:35.958
Go save the baby.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.877
[GABRIEL]
One move against me, hero,

00:14:37.919 --> 00:14:39.629
and I'll be forced to bring
the wrath of heaven

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:42.423
down on your happy little tush.

00:14:42.465 --> 00:14:43.841
Hey, Mama?

00:14:43.883 --> 00:14:45.676
What's up?
Something wrong, baby?

00:14:45.718 --> 00:14:48.930
So, uh, will you stay with Dada?

00:14:48.971 --> 00:14:52.016
Do you love Dada like I do?

00:14:52.058 --> 00:14:53.434
[EMI]
I, uh--

00:14:54.394 --> 00:14:55.269
[MAOU]
Hey!

00:14:55.311 --> 00:14:57.271
I just bought this underwear!

00:14:57.313 --> 00:14:58.439
Quit whining.

00:14:58.481 --> 00:14:59.732
I clearly recall you telling me

00:14:59.774 --> 00:15:02.110
that they were of the
extra-stretch variety!

00:15:02.151 --> 00:15:05.530
[MAOU]
Not what I'm worried about!

00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:08.074
Of course.
I'll be there with him.

00:15:08.116 --> 00:15:09.117
I'm sure.

00:15:09.158 --> 00:15:10.493
Really?

00:15:10.535 --> 00:15:13.287
[EMI]
Yes. Until death do us part!

00:15:14.455 --> 00:15:17.542
[MAOU screams]
Eat my dirty shorts!

00:15:17.583 --> 00:15:19.293
Dada!

00:15:19.335 --> 00:15:20.753
Unhand me! Now!

00:15:20.795 --> 00:15:22.463
Emi! Quick, kill us both!

00:15:22.505 --> 00:15:25.925
You idiot, there's no way I can
do that in front of the kid!

00:15:25.967 --> 00:15:27.677
[MAOU]
This is our only shot!

00:15:32.223 --> 00:15:34.851
Maou!

00:15:40.231 --> 00:15:41.482
[MAOU]
What the--?

00:15:43.776 --> 00:15:45.445
You saved me. Thank you.

00:15:45.486 --> 00:15:49.615
Welcome! I wanna be with
Mama and Dada forever.

00:15:49.657 --> 00:15:52.326
So, for just a lil' bit.

00:15:53.411 --> 00:15:54.620
[ALAS RAMUS]
Bye-bye!

00:15:55.663 --> 00:15:57.248
[SUZUNO]
Are you all right?

00:16:00.001 --> 00:16:02.420
Alas Ramus!

00:16:03.504 --> 00:16:05.506
Oh, pooey, he's still alive.

00:16:05.548 --> 00:16:07.633
Stubborn, eh? Me too!

00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:10.803
Huh?

00:16:10.845 --> 00:16:12.388
C'mon, gimme a break.

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:20.688
Sorry, angel-face.

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:23.149
But I'm afraid you'll be going
home empty-handed

00:16:23.191 --> 00:16:24.400
this time around.

00:16:24.442 --> 00:16:25.526
Ah, I see.

00:16:25.568 --> 00:16:28.196
the Church gave you more than
one piece of heavenly silver.

00:16:28.237 --> 00:16:30.031
Someone's been a lucky girl.

00:16:30.072 --> 00:16:32.617
But sadly for you,
that luck ends.

00:16:32.658 --> 00:16:33.618
Here!

00:16:49.175 --> 00:16:50.051
[EMI]
Interesting.

00:16:50.092 --> 00:16:53.721
Angels bleed red,
just like mortals.

00:16:53.763 --> 00:16:54.722
You're finished!

00:16:54.764 --> 00:16:56.891
Stand down!

00:16:56.933 --> 00:16:58.601
This isn't over, sweetie.

00:16:58.643 --> 00:17:01.812
With time, I'll collect each
and every shard of Yesod.

00:17:01.854 --> 00:17:04.315
I'll be back for
yours soon enough.

00:17:04.357 --> 00:17:06.400
You left Yesod
alone for centuries.

00:17:06.442 --> 00:17:09.529
What suddenly happened
that made you so worried?

00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:10.613
You care to know?

00:17:10.655 --> 00:17:13.449
Too bad you shot down
my attempts to talk it out.

00:17:13.491 --> 00:17:14.575
Huh?

00:17:14.617 --> 00:17:17.495
Perhaps you should
do some self-reflection.

00:17:17.537 --> 00:17:19.830
Figure out who
you truly are, hero.

00:17:19.872 --> 00:17:23.209
And more, what your
silly fight against me means.

00:17:23.251 --> 00:17:25.586
With time, you'll get it.

00:17:25.628 --> 00:17:26.629
And when you do...

00:17:26.671 --> 00:17:28.839
[inaudible]

00:17:40.685 --> 00:17:42.144
Emilia! We're here!

00:17:45.022 --> 00:17:46.232
I'm gonna be fine.

00:17:46.274 --> 00:17:48.693
And it looks like
Gabriel is gone.

00:17:48.734 --> 00:17:51.988
So, uh, where's Alas Ramus?

00:17:54.031 --> 00:17:56.033
No way.

00:17:56.075 --> 00:17:58.619
What am I supposed to do now?

00:17:58.661 --> 00:18:00.830
I'm out of ideas.

00:18:07.044 --> 00:18:09.630
Did you hear about what
went down this morning?

00:18:09.672 --> 00:18:11.882
I stopped by the apartment.

00:18:11.924 --> 00:18:14.218
So, uh, did he--?

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.721
Did the bad guy take her away?

00:18:16.762 --> 00:18:19.432
This wouldn't've happened
if I were stronger.

00:18:19.473 --> 00:18:21.767
You shouldn't talk like that,
it's not your fault.

00:18:21.809 --> 00:18:23.227
It was stupid of me
not to take down

00:18:23.269 --> 00:18:25.438
that angel the second
he showed up.

00:18:25.479 --> 00:18:26.981
Not that I could've beaten him.

00:18:27.023 --> 00:18:29.191
Come on, please
don't blame yourself.

00:18:29.233 --> 00:18:30.693
[ALAS RAMUS]
Chi-mi? Mama?

00:18:30.735 --> 00:18:33.863
What's going on? You get hurt?

00:18:33.904 --> 00:18:36.032
No. We're okay.

00:18:36.073 --> 00:18:39.785
We're just sad because-- Huh?

00:18:39.827 --> 00:18:41.287
Hi Chi-mi!

00:18:41.329 --> 00:18:42.830
Wait, Alas Ramus?

00:18:42.872 --> 00:18:44.707
But how did you get--?

00:18:44.749 --> 00:18:46.542
I'm glad you're all right!

00:18:46.584 --> 00:18:48.252
Come here!

00:18:48.294 --> 00:18:49.170
Wait a second.

00:18:49.211 --> 00:18:52.048
The way people were talking,
I thought she was gone.

00:18:52.089 --> 00:18:53.674
They still think so, too.

00:18:53.716 --> 00:18:56.177
I don't really know the
best way to explain this.

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:00.556
Be careful, kiddo!

00:19:00.598 --> 00:19:03.017
Mama!

00:19:03.059 --> 00:19:04.769
Huh?

00:19:11.359 --> 00:19:14.028
Yeah, About that.

00:19:18.908 --> 00:19:22.620
Alas Ramus ended up becoming one
with my sword and armor.

00:19:22.662 --> 00:19:24.747
[ALAS RAMUS]
Chi-mi! Do I look tough?

00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:27.083
Uh, yeah! You look super tough.

00:19:27.124 --> 00:19:30.920
So, why the heck haven't you
told everybody else she's okay?

00:19:30.961 --> 00:19:32.672
Mister Maou was
so depressed at work,

00:19:32.713 --> 00:19:35.716
he barely got anything done!

00:19:35.758 --> 00:19:37.009
Is that so?

00:19:37.051 --> 00:19:39.261
Then we have a unique
opportunity here.

00:19:39.303 --> 00:19:41.180
He'd benefit from a
taste of what it feels like

00:19:41.222 --> 00:19:42.848
to lose something precious.

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:44.684
But, here's the thing,

00:19:44.725 --> 00:19:45.810
this might seem cute right now,

00:19:45.851 --> 00:19:47.853
but it'll suck when
I defeat the Devil.

00:19:47.895 --> 00:19:48.729
I'll have no choice

00:19:48.771 --> 00:19:51.565
but to make Alas Ramus slice
and dice her own dad!

00:19:51.607 --> 00:19:54.068
Ugh! What do you
think I should do?

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:56.112
Maybe you could put the
mortal enemies thing aside

00:19:56.153 --> 00:19:59.031
and try to get along?

00:19:59.073 --> 00:20:00.491
You know, I have
a pretty good idea

00:20:00.533 --> 00:20:02.284
of what you oughta do first.

00:20:11.961 --> 00:20:13.546
[EMI]
Resorting to arson, are we?

00:20:13.587 --> 00:20:15.923
This is a "sending-off fire."

00:20:15.965 --> 00:20:17.967
Since she came during
a "welcoming fire,"

00:20:18.008 --> 00:20:19.677
it seemed right.

00:20:19.719 --> 00:20:21.679
Well, after all those years
and becoming a king,

00:20:21.721 --> 00:20:24.014
the traveler remembered how
precious the good luck charm

00:20:24.056 --> 00:20:26.225
he got from the
angel was, right?

00:20:26.267 --> 00:20:28.894
Let it go, Emi,
that was just a dumb story.

00:20:28.936 --> 00:20:30.020
I know at least one person

00:20:30.062 --> 00:20:33.149
who didn't think your story
was all that dumb.

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:35.693
And she's a smarty.

00:20:37.903 --> 00:20:40.406
Dada!

00:20:40.448 --> 00:20:41.741
What's going on?

00:20:41.782 --> 00:20:43.784
Hey, kid! Is it really you?

00:20:43.826 --> 00:20:45.536
Dada, you're squishing me!

00:20:45.578 --> 00:20:47.496
Well, how do you
like them apples?

00:20:47.538 --> 00:20:48.831
So, she's still ours?

00:20:48.873 --> 00:20:50.499
This isn't some messed-up prank?

00:20:50.541 --> 00:20:53.127
No, but I was fully prepared
to let you suffer a little more

00:20:53.169 --> 00:20:56.714
until somebody started
demanding to see Dada, so...

00:20:56.756 --> 00:21:00.009
Wait, are you crying?

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:02.553
Dada, did you get a booboo?

00:21:02.595 --> 00:21:03.679
He's all right.

00:21:03.721 --> 00:21:06.849
I think your daddy is just
really excited to see you.

00:21:07.683 --> 00:21:09.226
Happy tears, y'know?

00:21:09.268 --> 00:21:10.644
They're pretty common.

00:21:10.686 --> 00:21:12.438
Right? Mister Maou?

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.982
Huh?! These aren't tears!

00:21:15.024 --> 00:21:16.984
I'm sweating
from my eyes, idiot!

00:21:17.026 --> 00:21:18.944
I knew she was
here the entire time!

00:21:18.986 --> 00:21:20.654
Gah!

00:21:20.696 --> 00:21:22.907
In fact, we already prepared
her dinner for today,

00:21:22.948 --> 00:21:25.242
I'll have you know!

00:21:25.284 --> 00:21:26.118
Ashiya! Suzano!

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.828
We need food for the kid,
and we need it stat!

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:28.662
[SUZUNO]
Alas Ramus!

00:21:28.704 --> 00:21:29.538
[ASHIYA]
I'm on it!

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:32.249
How is the devil
such a terrible liar?

00:21:32.291 --> 00:21:34.126
[CHIHO giggles]

00:21:36.796 --> 00:21:38.464
[GABRIEL]
I hope you'll act with caution.

00:21:38.506 --> 00:21:40.049
Especially if the
safety of the world

00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:43.594
is of any importance to you.

00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:45.221
Trust me.

00:21:45.262 --> 00:21:49.934
We don't want a second coming
of Demon King Satan's Calamity.

00:21:49.975 --> 00:21:52.978
Well, that was ominous.

00:23:23.861 --> 00:23:26.447
[GABRIEL] The kid and the
sword completely fused together.

00:23:26.488 --> 00:23:28.073
This is totally uncool.

00:23:28.115 --> 00:23:31.118
Plus, we don't have any idea
where the other wing ended up.

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:32.912
Well, with love's light wings,

00:23:32.953 --> 00:23:37.750
I o'erperched the yellow
awning 'cross the way.

00:23:37.791 --> 00:23:39.627
Sorry! I got carried away!

00:23:39.668 --> 00:23:41.420
I'm not trying to
be disrespectful,

00:23:41.462 --> 00:23:45.633
but it's pretty obvious
who has the other one, yeah?

00:23:45.674 --> 00:23:46.634
Just think.

00:23:46.675 --> 00:23:49.970
Who was it that stole
Yesod in the first place?

00:23:50.012 --> 00:23:51.639
Lailah.

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.599
You know. Emilia's mother?
