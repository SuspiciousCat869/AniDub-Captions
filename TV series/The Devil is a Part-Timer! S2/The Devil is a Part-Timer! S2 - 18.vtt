00:08:34.444 --> 00:08:37.618
Could you use your power
to open this door?

00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:40.540
No biggie for a Malebranche,
right?

[LIBICOCCO] You certainly look
like a human from this country.

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:56.488
So, you're the one

00:08:56.573 --> 00:08:58.785
that brat Farfa
was talking about.

00:08:58.868 --> 00:09:00.956
You're King Satan's new general.

00:09:01.039 --> 00:09:03.377
The future MgRonald's barista?

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.339
Farfa-- Oh!

00:09:05.423 --> 00:09:07.427
You mean that Fart-fellow guy!

00:09:08.304 --> 00:09:09.139
How nice.

00:09:09.222 --> 00:09:11.811
It sounds like he took care
of all the introductions for me.

00:09:11.894 --> 00:09:13.773
[laughs]

00:09:13.857 --> 00:09:16.403
You are clearly no actor,
small general.

00:09:16.486 --> 00:09:17.990
Your voice is trembling.

00:09:18.617 --> 00:09:19.660
You must know by now

00:09:19.744 --> 00:09:22.165
you can't hide fear
from a demon.

00:09:22.916 --> 00:09:25.463
I am Libicocco,

00:09:25.547 --> 00:09:27.760
one of the leaders
of the Malebranche.

00:09:28.469 --> 00:09:31.141
Not some pee-pants baby
like Farfa.

00:09:32.143 --> 00:09:33.228
I rejoice to hear

00:09:33.312 --> 00:09:35.859
that the Demon King Satan
is alive and well.

00:09:36.569 --> 00:09:39.366

to accept these new "generals"!

Please, ma'am, may I?

00:09:53.477 --> 00:09:55.857
No way, you have to tell me
what's going on.

00:09:55.941 --> 00:09:57.068
Ah, yes, of course,

00:09:57.151 --> 00:10:00.366
I don't doubt you have questions
aplenty about us now.

00:10:00.449 --> 00:10:02.996
[RIKA] I've always thought you
were a pretty mysterious guy.

00:10:03.957 --> 00:10:06.128
I've had questions
since we first met,

00:10:06.211 --> 00:10:07.548
but we haven't gotten
close enough

00:10:07.631 --> 00:10:09.384
for me to ask you
anything personal.

00:10:09.467 --> 00:10:10.637
Yes, I see.

00:10:10.721 --> 00:10:13.601
But now, I think
I deserve some answers.

00:10:13.685 --> 00:10:14.895
Right. What fun.

00:10:15.522 --> 00:10:17.150
So, I'll ask you one more time.

00:10:17.233 --> 00:10:19.905
How the heck did your buddies
just fly out that window?

00:10:20.448 --> 00:10:22.953
They didn't even have fairy dust
or a damn reindeer!

00:10:23.036 --> 00:10:23.913
All right.

00:10:23.997 --> 00:10:25.458
Well, the truth is...

00:10:25.542 --> 00:10:26.586
Tell me.

00:10:26.627 --> 00:10:28.923
...Suzuno and Urushihara,
they...

00:10:29.508 --> 00:10:30.384
Go on.

...were chosen to participate

00:10:31.971 --> 00:10:35.311
in the trials
of a new energy drink.

00:10:35.394 --> 00:10:37.524
-[RIKA] What?
-And this, you see,

00:10:37.608 --> 00:10:38.693
was a rare side effect.

00:10:38.777 --> 00:10:41.448
That's not what they mean
by "it gives you wings!"

00:10:41.532 --> 00:10:42.450
Like, come on!

00:10:42.534 --> 00:10:45.707
The building across from yours
has to be over ten meters away!

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:47.251
If they were able to make
that crazy jump

00:10:47.335 --> 00:10:48.630
without a running start,

00:10:48.713 --> 00:10:50.382
they better win Japan the gold!

00:10:51.761 --> 00:10:53.515
Look, I know that you know!

00:10:53.598 --> 00:10:56.228
You were way more disapproving
than surprised!

00:10:56.311 --> 00:10:59.234
It so wasn't your first time
seeing something like that!

00:11:00.027 --> 00:11:01.864
I find myself in a dilemma.

00:11:01.948 --> 00:11:04.870
That even if I told the truth,
you wouldn't believe it.

00:11:06.206 --> 00:11:08.252
I just saw
two people fly out the window,

00:11:08.335 --> 00:11:10.005
so I'm pretty down
for believing.

00:11:10.715 --> 00:11:11.842

out of our sight.

I'll do as you wish, Sire,
but I don't understand.

[fire blazing]

00:16:02.507 --> 00:16:04.426
No. But why?

00:16:04.511 --> 00:16:06.430
[whooshing]

00:16:06.515 --> 00:16:07.767
Am I losing brain cells,

00:16:07.851 --> 00:16:09.729
or is this storm
getting even gnarlier?

00:16:09.813 --> 00:16:11.692
It is!
Should I pick up the pace?

00:16:11.775 --> 00:16:14.029
I was actually
about to suggest slowing down!

00:16:14.113 --> 00:16:15.448
[yelping]

00:16:15.533 --> 00:16:17.202

[straining]

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:20.668
[CHIHO]
Please stop!

00:16:20.751 --> 00:16:23.298
Or at least tell me
why you're doing this!

00:16:23.381 --> 00:16:24.216
[LIBICOCCO]
Huh?

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:25.761
I was given direct orders

00:16:25.845 --> 00:16:27.974
to go on the biggest rampage
I could muster

00:16:28.057 --> 00:16:29.728
wherever the Gate dropped me.

00:16:29.811 --> 00:16:31.732
Ah? But why, though?

00:16:31.815 --> 00:16:34.486
[chuckles]
It's a foolproof plan.

00:16:34.571 --> 00:16:38.996
You, the children inside,
everyone in this neighborhood.

00:16:39.079 --> 00:16:41.752
All those pouty cry-mouth faces.

00:16:41.835 --> 00:16:42.754
[gasps]

00:16:42.837 --> 00:16:44.507
It's quite
the delectable mission

00:16:44.591 --> 00:16:46.093
for a demon like me.

00:16:46.803 --> 00:16:48.431
The tears of the weak.

00:16:48.515 --> 00:16:50.268
Sorrow, and fear.

00:16:50.352 --> 00:16:52.774
All my favorite flavors!

00:16:52.857 --> 00:16:56.280
-Ah...
-[laughs]

00:16:57.491 --> 00:16:58.869
[gasps]

00:16:58.953 --> 00:17:00.623
[inhales sharply]
I can't breathe.

00:17:00.706 --> 00:17:03.127
It's like there's too much magic
in the air.

00:17:03.211 --> 00:17:06.133
-[CHIHO whimpers]
-Oh, how pathetic you are.

00:17:07.177 --> 00:17:08.931
-Huh?
-Uh?

00:17:09.724 --> 00:17:11.728
[scoffs]
If you have such a problem

00:17:11.812 --> 00:17:12.730
with what I'm doing,

00:17:12.814 --> 00:17:14.526
General Future Barista,

00:17:14.609 --> 00:17:18.116
I kindly invite you
to put an end to my antics.

00:17:18.199 --> 00:17:20.203
[SUZUNO]
Perfect. Then that I shall!

00:17:20.746 --> 00:17:22.667
-[thuds]
-[LIBICOCCO, CHIHO gasp]

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:25.130
â™ª

00:17:25.213 --> 00:17:28.177
As a general, I'm sure
your offer extends to me.

00:17:28.261 --> 00:17:30.473
Though I might end more
than your antics.

00:17:30.558 --> 00:17:31.602
You made it!

00:17:31.685 --> 00:17:33.104
I'm sorry that I'm late.

00:17:34.023 --> 00:17:36.695
Breaking through the storm wall
was not a simple task.

00:17:36.778 --> 00:17:37.905
Quite a pain.

00:17:37.989 --> 00:17:38.991
-[URUSHIHARA] Hey!
-Ah!

00:17:39.074 --> 00:17:41.454
Don't let her think
you did it by yourself.

00:17:41.538 --> 00:17:44.001
I'm coming to her rescue
as much as you are, dude.

00:17:44.084 --> 00:17:46.255
Mister Urushihara, your wings!

00:17:46.339 --> 00:17:48.259
Hm? Oh. Clean, right?

00:17:48.343 --> 00:17:50.096
He drank some Holyvitan.

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:52.309
Gotcha.
That explains the makeover.

00:17:52.894 --> 00:17:54.188
Looking back now,

00:17:54.271 --> 00:17:56.860
should've shot that magic juice
into my veins.

00:17:56.943 --> 00:17:58.488
Ya boy just wasn't ready.

00:17:58.572 --> 00:18:00.785
I suggest
you ready yourself now!

00:18:00.868 --> 00:18:02.454
[LIBICOCCO]
Lucifer, and...

00:18:02.538 --> 00:18:04.793
You must be Deathscythe Bel.

00:18:04.876 --> 00:18:05.711
Hm?

00:18:06.337 --> 00:18:08.383
Then you know
I was named a general?

00:18:08.466 --> 00:18:09.511
[LIBICOCCO]
Sorry.

00:18:09.594 --> 00:18:11.222
I hadn't the slightest suspicion

00:18:11.305 --> 00:18:13.519
that you all might make
an appearance.

00:18:14.854 --> 00:18:17.275
But thank you
for saving me the trip.

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:18.695
[rain falling]

00:18:18.779 --> 00:18:19.781
[NORD] Miss Rika.

00:18:20.323 --> 00:18:23.037
I appreciate you.
For helping my Emilia.

00:18:23.121 --> 00:18:25.417
Oh. No problem at all.

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.797
Hey, can you clear something up
for me?

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:28.757
Of course.

00:18:28.841 --> 00:18:30.218
[RIKA]
Who's Emilia?

00:18:30.301 --> 00:18:32.431
Guess that's something else
you never knew.

00:18:32.515 --> 00:18:35.395
Emi Yusa's true name
is Emilia Justina.

00:18:35.478 --> 00:18:37.482
[RIKA]
And she's not from Japan either?

00:18:37.567 --> 00:18:39.194
Well, uh... [clears throat]

00:18:41.282 --> 00:18:42.159
Uh...

00:18:42.785 --> 00:18:43.620
She's not.

00:18:44.204 --> 00:18:45.791
It sounds absurd,

00:18:45.875 --> 00:18:47.712
but she wasn't even born
on Earth.

00:18:49.047 --> 00:18:50.175
Emi's an alien?

00:18:50.843 --> 00:18:52.012
[ASHIYA]
That's a rather simple way

00:18:52.095 --> 00:18:52.930
to look at it,

00:18:53.014 --> 00:18:54.642
but I think you get the point.

00:18:54.726 --> 00:18:56.187
She's like an alien.

00:18:56.688 --> 00:18:58.901
But she's human
through and through.

00:18:58.984 --> 00:19:00.236
No doubt about that.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.742
Just, one from a faraway world.

00:19:04.453 --> 00:19:05.748
Do you think I'm stupid?

00:19:06.457 --> 00:19:09.087
Of course not,
but you have to believe me.

00:19:09.171 --> 00:19:10.173
Otherwise,

00:19:10.256 --> 00:19:12.302
you'll never understand
what you've seen.

00:19:12.385 --> 00:19:14.766
Because it's honestly
the truth of the matter.

00:19:14.849 --> 00:19:16.728
[RIKA]
What are you talking about?

00:19:17.855 --> 00:19:19.483
[ASHIYA]
That house over there.

00:19:19.567 --> 00:19:22.030
It's a good ten meters away,
wouldn't you say?

00:19:22.113 --> 00:19:24.409
Can you imagine
any ordinary person

00:19:24.493 --> 00:19:26.288
just hopping over to the roof?

00:19:26.372 --> 00:19:27.290
Ah!

00:19:27.374 --> 00:19:29.002
Well, I mean, uh...

00:19:29.086 --> 00:19:30.255
It is pretty far.

00:19:30.338 --> 00:19:31.508
But you're kidding!

00:19:31.591 --> 00:19:33.929
Though I can understand
your disbelief.

00:19:34.012 --> 00:19:35.516
I'm quite serious.

00:19:35.599 --> 00:19:37.310
-Then show me some proof!
-[slams]

00:19:37.394 --> 00:19:38.564
You know,
none of what you're saying

00:19:38.647 --> 00:19:40.191
makes any kind of sense.

00:19:40.275 --> 00:19:43.281
Why would an alien be working
for peanuts at a call center?

00:19:43.364 --> 00:19:45.578
I've asked myself
the same question.

00:19:45.661 --> 00:19:48.499
But still, we all have to eat
and pay the rent.

00:19:48.584 --> 00:19:50.546
And that requires keeping a job.

00:19:51.213 --> 00:19:56.223
[speaking in foreign language]

00:20:03.154 --> 00:20:04.489
What all do you know?

00:20:04.574 --> 00:20:06.452
Did Maou explain who we are?

00:20:06.536 --> 00:20:07.454
Not yet.

00:20:08.331 --> 00:20:09.834
But I'm starting
to get the feeling

00:20:09.918 --> 00:20:11.546
that none of you are human.

00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:13.049
As for now...

00:20:13.132 --> 00:20:13.967
[grunts]

00:20:14.051 --> 00:20:15.888
I'll have to wait
to get a real introduction

00:20:15.971 --> 00:20:16.806
and all that.

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:18.309
[gasps and grunts]

00:20:18.392 --> 00:20:20.814
[rain falling]

00:20:20.898 --> 00:20:25.824
â™ª

00:20:25.908 --> 00:20:27.452
It looks like we're surrounded.

00:20:28.204 --> 00:20:29.414
Where's that armor from?

00:20:29.916 --> 00:20:31.251
Never seen it before.

00:20:31.836 --> 00:20:33.089
The Eastern Continent.

00:20:33.799 --> 00:20:37.389
The second-highest ranking
of Efzahan's knight squadrons,

00:20:37.472 --> 00:20:39.184
the Inlaid Azure Scarves.

00:20:39.686 --> 00:20:40.688
But why?

00:20:40.771 --> 00:20:42.107
What have they come for?

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:44.862
I got some of that,
but I'm completely lost.

00:20:44.946 --> 00:20:48.494
We need to protect her,
Miss Rika, don't we?

00:20:49.079 --> 00:20:49.914
Correct.

00:20:50.582 --> 00:20:51.417
Ah!

00:20:52.085 --> 00:20:53.421
And you're a fighter?

00:20:53.922 --> 00:20:54.966
Well, sometimes.

00:20:55.049 --> 00:20:58.264
I could take on this large
of a squadron back at home,

00:20:58.347 --> 00:20:59.349
but here...

00:20:59.433 --> 00:21:02.272
I've had my fair share of fights
from time to time.

00:21:02.773 --> 00:21:03.859
But I'm untrained.

00:21:04.652 --> 00:21:06.321
Are they looking for me?

00:21:06.405 --> 00:21:07.365
No, doubt it.

00:21:08.242 --> 00:21:10.789
The only reason I'm here
is because I met Maou.

00:21:11.833 --> 00:21:13.252
He's their target.

00:21:13.335 --> 00:21:14.881
That's probably the case.

00:21:14.964 --> 00:21:16.760
-[whimpers]
-[sighs]

00:21:16.843 --> 00:21:18.638
[ASHIYA] If we assume
that whatever happened

00:21:18.722 --> 00:21:19.891
at Miss Sasaki's school

00:21:19.974 --> 00:21:21.561
was simply a diversion,

00:21:21.644 --> 00:21:22.813
then it follows they've come

00:21:22.897 --> 00:21:25.944
to collect the most likely one
to stay behind in a crisis.

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:28.365
Furthermore,

00:21:28.449 --> 00:21:30.662
if one of us can't fight
at the moment...

00:21:31.371 --> 00:21:33.083
that narrows it down to...

00:21:33.877 --> 00:21:34.837
[grunts]

00:21:35.798 --> 00:21:37.008
...me.

00:21:37.091 --> 00:21:39.221
I'm the one that they're after.

Ugh. Stupid rain.

00:21:48.782 --> 00:21:50.159
Should I take a cab?

00:21:50.243 --> 00:21:51.078
It's not far,

00:21:51.161 --> 00:21:53.040
so probably more trouble
than it's worth.

00:21:53.834 --> 00:21:55.921
Not like I'm gonna melt
or anything.

Yeah. Too funky for a cab.

Ugh. I'd literally kill
for a bath right about now.

00:22:08.112 --> 00:22:09.030
Okay.

00:22:09.657 --> 00:22:10.491
Now!
