00:00:09.426 --> 00:00:10.969
[SENICHI]
<i>Nure-senbei</i> are unique.

00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:13.388
They have a rather
smooshy texture, I'd say.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.183
They're super soft and tasty!

00:00:16.225 --> 00:00:18.185
Is this your
first time trying them?

00:00:18.227 --> 00:00:20.229
Yep. Never had em.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.232
I usually go for more
crack in my cracker!

00:00:23.273 --> 00:00:26.568
So did they ever get your friend
Maou's apartment all fixed up?

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:27.486
[CHIHO]
Mm-hm!

00:00:27.528 --> 00:00:29.488
They should be moved in by now.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:30.614
--[phone rings]
--Huh?

00:00:30.656 --> 00:00:32.991
Here. Let me get this one.

00:00:35.077 --> 00:00:36.828
Hello?

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.121
What's good, brother?

00:00:38.163 --> 00:00:41.083
How ya doin'?

00:00:41.124 --> 00:00:42.417
Really?

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:47.589
[EMI] Don't know why I expected
the place to be less of a dump.

00:00:47.631 --> 00:00:49.841
[ASHIYA]
Ugh! Have you not eyes?

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:50.968
Look!

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:53.804
The kitchen faucet
has been tightened!

00:00:53.845 --> 00:00:56.181
No matter how hard I twisted
the knob, it would drip,

00:00:56.223 --> 00:00:58.600
but the good
repairmen hath saved me!

00:00:58.642 --> 00:01:00.394
Yay, repairs!

00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:02.396
Look at you,
understanding stuff!

00:01:02.437 --> 00:01:04.648
You're my little smarty,
aren't you?

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.650
You've lost all
hope of being cool.

00:01:06.692 --> 00:01:09.528
From Demon King to Dorky Dad.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.155
I'm so glad you're digging
the family bonding.

00:01:12.197 --> 00:01:14.992
But, MgRonalds is still
closed for a while, right?

00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:15.993
You should look for a temp job

00:01:16.034 --> 00:01:17.995
before we come
down with the poor.

00:01:18.036 --> 00:01:20.080
Silence, hypocrite!

00:01:20.122 --> 00:01:21.999
[doorbell rings]

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.960
Hi, everybody!

00:01:25.002 --> 00:01:26.795
Chi-mi is home!

00:01:26.837 --> 00:01:28.547
What's up, Chi?

00:01:28.589 --> 00:01:29.506
Good news!

00:01:29.548 --> 00:01:31.049
I found you a job!

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:32.134
In Nagano!

00:01:32.175 --> 00:01:34.386
Uh. Nagano?

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.232
[ASHIYA]
Urushihara.

00:03:10.273 --> 00:03:11.733
You faring well?

00:03:11.775 --> 00:03:14.528
Uh... Why don't
you take a guess?

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:15.862
Sorry, he's gross.

00:03:15.904 --> 00:03:17.739
He's not used
to leaving the house.

00:03:17.781 --> 00:03:19.116
Aw, it's okay.

00:03:19.157 --> 00:03:22.077
Little Chiho here used to get
carsick when she was young.

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:23.620
She was worse than this though,

00:03:23.662 --> 00:03:25.580
she would be sick out
of both ends if you know--

00:03:25.622 --> 00:03:27.958
Let's just keep that
to ourselves, Mom!

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:30.794
You know, maybe there's
something to be learned here.

00:03:30.836 --> 00:03:32.963
We all get sick,
even dark lords.

00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:35.590
Huh?
"Dark lords"? What's that?

00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:36.508
What did I say?

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.176
Not dark lords, that's for sure!

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:41.012
You did! 'Cause that's what
you call black bears, isn't it?

00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:42.222
Yeah! That's right!

00:03:42.264 --> 00:03:43.265
You know me.

00:03:43.306 --> 00:03:44.474
Scared of bears!

00:03:44.516 --> 00:03:47.269
Speaking of,
are there bears in Nagano?

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.396
[RIHO] You would hardly
see them back in the day.

00:03:49.438 --> 00:03:51.064
But I hear that lately
they've been coming down

00:03:51.106 --> 00:03:53.650
the mountain to find food.

00:03:53.692 --> 00:03:55.444
Miss Sasaki's grandmother.

00:03:55.485 --> 00:03:58.905
She was attacked by a wild boar
on the farm, correct?

00:03:58.947 --> 00:04:01.074
[RIHO] Yes, but she
wasn't hurt too badly.

00:04:01.116 --> 00:04:02.868
Though it was enough to
scare away all the kids

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:05.370
they had working part-time.

00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:06.872
Hence they're shorthanded.

00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:08.373
With the summer
harvest coming up,

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:10.959
my brother-in-law needs help.

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.461
That's where you boys come in!

00:04:12.502 --> 00:04:14.337
Thanks again.

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:15.422
Sure.

00:04:15.464 --> 00:04:16.631
We're just happy
to have something

00:04:16.673 --> 00:04:19.259
to do until MgRonald's reopens.

00:04:19.301 --> 00:04:20.677
It's a little late to ask,

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:23.388
but do you think that we
should've invited Miss Yusa?

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.640
I'm sick of her
following us around.

00:04:25.682 --> 00:04:27.267
I could use an Emi break.

00:04:27.309 --> 00:04:29.019
My liege! Look ahead!

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.645
What a sight to see!

00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:34.065
[MAOU] Whoa, that building
has the face of a <i>kappa</i>!

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:35.817
[CHIHO]
It's called Kappakan!

00:04:35.859 --> 00:04:39.654
It's a museum related to the old
legends and all things <i>kappa</i>!

00:04:39.696 --> 00:04:40.906
The <i>kappa</i>?

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:43.658
These spirits are known
for their diverse interests.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:44.534
Sumo!

00:04:44.576 --> 00:04:46.161
And cucumbers!

00:04:46.203 --> 00:04:49.873
And the <i>shirikodama</i>,
AKA the butt soul.

00:04:49.915 --> 00:04:51.041
Lost me at butt.

00:04:51.082 --> 00:04:51.958
It's the truth!

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.711
<i>Kappa</i> are known to extract
an orb called the <i>shirikodama</i>

00:04:54.753 --> 00:04:56.880
straight from the
human's chocolate pocket.

00:04:56.922 --> 00:04:58.673
And without this
mysterious globe,

00:04:58.715 --> 00:05:01.343
the human is robbed of all
of their nerve and vigor.

00:05:01.384 --> 00:05:04.513
Perhaps, that's what
happened to you, Urushihara!

00:05:04.554 --> 00:05:05.931
Huh?

00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:09.810
Give the poor guy a break,
he's too sick for a comeback.

00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:11.895
Well, we're almost there.

00:05:11.937 --> 00:05:13.230
Hey, here's a fun fact.

00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:16.024
All this land you see out here,
minus the roads of course,

00:05:16.066 --> 00:05:17.400
belongs to our family.

00:05:19.194 --> 00:05:21.029
[MAOU, ASHIYA]
What?!

00:05:22.239 --> 00:05:25.534
[YUMIKO] Riho!
I hope the drive wasn't too bad!

00:05:25.575 --> 00:05:27.327
[CHIHO]
It's good to see you, Auntie!

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:29.162
I'm glad you came, Chiho!

00:05:29.204 --> 00:05:31.832
You've grown so much
since I've seen you!

00:05:31.873 --> 00:05:33.917
Is that boy Mister Maou?

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:35.877
Yep, that's me.

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:37.587
Nice to meet you.

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:40.090
I'm your niece's friend, Ashiya.

00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:41.800
I'm Urushihara.

00:05:41.842 --> 00:05:44.094
I'm Yumiko, Chiho's auntie.

00:05:44.135 --> 00:05:46.471
That ride must've
tuckered you folks out!

00:05:46.513 --> 00:05:48.682
Relax for a bit in your rooms.

00:05:48.723 --> 00:05:51.476
Dear?
Why don't you show them the way?

00:05:53.395 --> 00:05:54.938
[gasps]

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.064
[ASHIYA]
Enormous.

00:05:56.106 --> 00:05:58.900
[MAOU] The Devil's Castle
could fit in the damn foyer!

00:05:58.942 --> 00:06:00.026
In fact,

00:06:00.068 --> 00:06:04.322
imagine for a moment the area of
Sasazuka and Hatagaya combined.

00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:07.450
That would still be smaller
than the land the Sasakis own.

00:06:07.492 --> 00:06:09.327
What are you waiting
for, slowpokes?

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:11.079
The stairs are over this way!

00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:12.455
Hey, Ashiya?

00:06:12.497 --> 00:06:15.333
Did our secretly rich friend
just say "the stairs"?

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:17.210
Um, I believe so.

00:06:17.252 --> 00:06:19.588
This place is even
bigger than we thought!

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:21.506
True! What sorcery is this?

00:06:21.548 --> 00:06:24.175
Hurry, or they'll
smell your poverty.

00:06:24.217 --> 00:06:27.637
Thanks for being here, you're
doing our family a huge favor.

00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:29.890
I'm Manji, Chiho's uncle.

00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:32.392
You met my wife, Yumiko.

00:06:32.434 --> 00:06:34.269
And that's my son Kazuma.

00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:36.146
He runs the place.

00:06:36.187 --> 00:06:38.064
So, I'm Chiho's cousin.

00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:40.483
That's my wife, Hinako,
and son, Hitoshi.

00:06:40.525 --> 00:06:41.985
Hello!

00:06:42.027 --> 00:06:44.029
Can you tell
our friends hello, too?

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.530
Hello!

00:06:45.572 --> 00:06:48.033
Wait, so you're Chi's cousin?

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:49.659
[CHIHO]
I just have some experience

00:06:49.701 --> 00:06:51.953
babysitting my cousin's kid.

00:06:51.995 --> 00:06:54.456
[BOTH] Thank you, sir,
we'll forever be in your debt!

00:06:54.497 --> 00:06:56.207
[ALL]
Hmm?

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:57.834
[EI]
Well, looky, here.

00:06:57.876 --> 00:06:59.878
The gang's all back together.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:00.879
Grandma?

00:07:00.921 --> 00:07:03.048
I was under the
impression you were hurt.

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:05.842
Takes a lot more than
that to keep me down!

00:07:05.884 --> 00:07:07.636
Lastly, this is my mother, Ei.

00:07:07.677 --> 00:07:10.388
We heard you were gored
by a boar or something.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:11.890
Just a headbutt!

00:07:11.932 --> 00:07:14.726
I'll be all right, but you
should see the other guy!

00:07:14.768 --> 00:07:17.228
Well, I'm really glad
that you're doing okay.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.314
Let us cover the physical labor.

00:07:19.356 --> 00:07:20.649
We're here to help out.

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:23.401
So rest up and leave
the farming to us, ma'am.

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:24.694
Huh?

00:07:24.736 --> 00:07:26.112
Hey, Hinako.

00:07:26.154 --> 00:07:29.449
Why don't you show
our guests around the fields?

00:07:29.491 --> 00:07:32.160
Chiho, you mind watching
the little guy for a while?

00:07:32.202 --> 00:07:34.037
Of course! Sounds fun!

00:07:34.079 --> 00:07:35.330
How responsible!

00:07:35.372 --> 00:07:37.916
You're becoming a
fine young lady, aren't ya?

00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.460
Her mom says she's been
working on cooking, too.

00:07:40.502 --> 00:07:42.087
Rumor has it,
she's spent a lot of time

00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:44.965
learning some fancy
new recipes to impress Maou.

00:07:45.006 --> 00:07:46.341
Oh, yeah?

00:07:46.383 --> 00:07:48.051
Whose team are you on, mother?

00:07:48.093 --> 00:07:50.220
Don't just tell
people that stuff!

00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:51.054
Oops.

00:07:51.096 --> 00:07:52.931
It came up in conversation, hun.

00:07:52.973 --> 00:07:54.599
I'm not buying that excuse!

00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:55.684
[MAOU chuckles]

00:07:55.725 --> 00:07:57.727
What? Something funny?

00:07:57.769 --> 00:07:58.979
No, not at all!

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.189
It's just, in the car,
I was thinking.

00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:02.399
About?

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.483
This whole trip?

00:08:03.525 --> 00:08:06.486
I think it's going to let me
see a different side of you.

00:08:06.528 --> 00:08:07.821
I'm excited.

00:08:07.862 --> 00:08:11.825
Huh? Cool. Though I'm not
super sure what you mean.

00:08:14.953 --> 00:08:17.789
[HINAKO] I can't express
how grateful we are.

00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:19.791
We won't make you
do anything too difficult.

00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:20.792
No fear.

00:08:20.834 --> 00:08:22.293
We will just need
help with things

00:08:22.335 --> 00:08:23.837
like harvesting and weeding.

00:08:23.878 --> 00:08:26.631
All the super tedious,
but fairly simple tasks.

00:08:26.673 --> 00:08:28.341
Great. Hey, are
you sure it's okay

00:08:28.383 --> 00:08:30.885
for them to ride back there?

00:08:30.927 --> 00:08:33.763
For some reason, this doesn't
make me feel as puke-y.

00:08:33.805 --> 00:08:35.682
While I'm ever-so happy for you,

00:08:35.724 --> 00:08:37.225
we are currently
breaking the law,

00:08:37.267 --> 00:08:39.561
and if caught by police,
could face a fine!

00:08:39.602 --> 00:08:41.479
That won't be a problem here.

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:43.106
All of this land is ours.

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:46.901
Now, there aren't
too many vegetables

00:08:46.943 --> 00:08:48.445
that get harvested
here in the summer.

00:08:48.486 --> 00:08:50.488
But those that do,
need to be handpicked,

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.365
and we have quite a few.

00:08:52.407 --> 00:08:54.868
Those greenhouses
are full of eggplants.

00:08:54.909 --> 00:08:57.120
And nearby are cucumbers.

00:08:57.162 --> 00:08:58.580
Nearby?

00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:01.916
We would call that a
hefty city block in Sasazuka.

00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.335
[HINAKO] The harvest doesn't
start until tomorrow morning,

00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:05.879
but let's warm you up.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.382
It'll be good to
dip your toes in.

00:09:09.424 --> 00:09:10.925
It's nothing scary!

00:09:10.967 --> 00:09:12.802
Just some light weeding.

00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:20.226
Hey. Urushihara, are you dead?

00:09:20.268 --> 00:09:21.936
Tough loss.

00:09:21.978 --> 00:09:25.982
Ashiya. Nothing?

00:09:26.024 --> 00:09:27.567
War, you're fine.

00:09:27.609 --> 00:09:29.152
Weeding? Dead.

00:09:29.194 --> 00:09:31.404
[CHIHO] Mister Maou?
Can we come in for a sec?

00:09:31.446 --> 00:09:33.782
Yeah, just watch the bodies

00:09:33.823 --> 00:09:35.408
Poor boys.

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.744
It looks like they
started you out early.

00:09:37.786 --> 00:09:39.954
There's still a little bit
of time before dinner,

00:09:39.996 --> 00:09:43.500
so Kazuma invited us all
to check out a hot spring.

00:09:43.541 --> 00:09:46.503
--Huh?
--Huh?

00:09:46.544 --> 00:09:47.796
[RIHO]
Wow.

00:09:47.837 --> 00:09:50.173
What a beautiful building.

00:09:50.215 --> 00:09:51.883
[KAZUMA]
Just went up last year.

00:09:51.925 --> 00:09:55.470
It's a hotel, but you can also
come just for the hot spring.

00:09:55.512 --> 00:09:57.889
How about we meet
back up at 6:30?

00:09:57.931 --> 00:09:59.891
Oof!

00:09:59.933 --> 00:10:01.851
Whoa! Hi! Chi-mi!

00:10:01.893 --> 00:10:03.686
Wait, Alas Ramus?

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.232
[EMI]
Slow down for Mama, cutie!

00:10:07.273 --> 00:10:09.109
Short legs, but such speed.

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:11.694
So, uh, what's going on?

00:10:11.736 --> 00:10:12.737
Why're you here?

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:14.989
Hilarious coming from you!

00:10:15.031 --> 00:10:16.366
That's strange.

00:10:16.407 --> 00:10:17.784
Do you know these folks?

00:10:17.826 --> 00:10:19.619
Did you say "Alas Ramus"?

00:10:19.661 --> 00:10:21.704
That's the baby
he took in, right?

00:10:21.746 --> 00:10:24.707
Mama! My Dada is here!

00:10:24.749 --> 00:10:25.917
"Dada"?

00:10:25.959 --> 00:10:27.377
"Mama"?

00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:35.218
Let me make sure I'm
understanding this right.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.762
So... when Maou
and his roommates

00:10:37.804 --> 00:10:39.472
came to Nagano with us,

00:10:39.514 --> 00:10:42.183
they left Alas Ramus
under the care of...?

00:10:42.225 --> 00:10:44.352
Suzuno Kamazuki, ma'am.

00:10:44.394 --> 00:10:46.563
Of course, Miss Kamazuki.

00:10:46.604 --> 00:10:47.522
And you're friends
with sweet Emi,

00:10:47.564 --> 00:10:49.399
who happens to bear
a striking resemblance

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.984
to the baby's real mother.

00:10:51.025 --> 00:10:52.735
How am I doing so far?

00:10:52.777 --> 00:10:53.611
Quite well.

00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:55.071
But you see,
the poor child couldn't stand

00:10:55.113 --> 00:10:58.533
to be apart from Maou,
who she thinks of as a father.

00:10:58.575 --> 00:11:00.368
We did research into the area

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:02.328
and found this
hot spring hotel nearby.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:03.496
It was perfect.

00:11:03.538 --> 00:11:05.081
I knew it would be
an inconvenience,

00:11:05.123 --> 00:11:09.043
but we came anyway in hopes
the baby could see Maou.

00:11:09.085 --> 00:11:11.212
How cruel, Maou.

00:11:11.254 --> 00:11:13.173
You should've brought
the baby with you.

00:11:13.214 --> 00:11:15.049
Actual father or not.

00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:17.760
Uh! Right. I know that now.

00:11:17.802 --> 00:11:20.555
But worse than that, her real
parents have abandoned her

00:11:20.597 --> 00:11:23.600
for so long she's forgotten
who they even are.

00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:26.227
Tell your relative she's started
calling someone else "Mom,"

00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:27.645
and they might come back.

00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:30.481
Eh. Wouldn't worry
about it all that much.

00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:33.693
I have a friend that's so busy,
his kids hardly know him.

00:11:33.735 --> 00:11:35.695
Each family's different.

00:11:36.821 --> 00:11:39.574
Um. Mister Sasaki?

00:11:39.616 --> 00:11:40.617
We just met,

00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:43.328
and I'm fully aware this
might be out of line to ask,

00:11:43.369 --> 00:11:46.623
especially after our painfully
embarrassing introduction, but--

00:11:46.664 --> 00:11:48.124
What is it?

00:11:48.166 --> 00:11:49.375
Will you hire us?

00:11:49.417 --> 00:11:52.337
Suzuno and I would
prove most valuable.

00:11:52.378 --> 00:11:54.589
I actually grew up
on a wheat farm.

00:11:54.631 --> 00:11:57.550
So, I for one,
know what I'm doing.

00:12:01.095 --> 00:12:02.388
I'm sorry, Bel.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.224
Didn't mean to
drag you into this.

00:12:04.265 --> 00:12:05.725
Please. It's fine.

00:12:05.767 --> 00:12:08.311
I have no qualms
with manual labor.

00:12:08.353 --> 00:12:12.982
And I understand all your
concerns about the boys.

00:12:13.024 --> 00:12:15.693
Imagine those clowns
working in the fields.

00:12:21.449 --> 00:12:24.827
What a total pain in my ass.

00:12:24.869 --> 00:12:25.954
[CHIHO]
Mister Maou?

00:12:25.995 --> 00:12:28.122
Are you asleep in there?

00:12:28.706 --> 00:12:29.540
Not yet.

00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:31.000
Sup, Chi?

00:12:36.881 --> 00:12:38.549
[CHIHO]
Gosh, I'm sorry.

00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:40.969
I need a sec to get
in the right space.

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:41.970
[MAOU]
Huh?

00:12:42.011 --> 00:12:45.556
[inhales, exhales]

00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:47.016
Okay.

00:12:49.852 --> 00:12:50.853
[CHIHO]
Hi.

00:12:50.895 --> 00:12:53.273
Good evening, Mister Maou.

00:12:53.314 --> 00:12:54.983
Hey. You good?

00:12:55.024 --> 00:12:59.696
I'm, uh, kinda underdressed.
Like, it's embarrassing

00:12:59.737 --> 00:13:00.905
[MAOU]
Hmm?

00:13:00.947 --> 00:13:03.241
Doesn't seem like a problem.

00:13:03.283 --> 00:13:04.242
What's up?

00:13:04.284 --> 00:13:05.410
Need something?

00:13:05.451 --> 00:13:06.786
Uh-huh.

00:13:06.828 --> 00:13:10.999
I just... Never mind, I'm being
silly, it's not that important.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.500
Thinking about it,

00:13:12.542 --> 00:13:16.921
I don't think I've ever seen
you dressed so casually.

00:13:16.963 --> 00:13:19.132
You look cute
with your hair down.

00:13:19.173 --> 00:13:20.925
You should wear it
like that more.

00:13:20.967 --> 00:13:23.219
Huh? Yeah,
I don't think I can do that!

00:13:23.261 --> 00:13:25.430
It's fine to look
like this at home,

00:13:25.471 --> 00:13:28.474
but I can't go exposing
my home-self to just anybody!

00:13:28.516 --> 00:13:31.019
I guess that makes sense?

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:32.812
So, what did you come here for?

00:13:32.854 --> 00:13:38.818
Uh. So, I, uh, I wanted to talk
to you about Miss Yusa.

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:40.320
Know what?

00:13:40.361 --> 00:13:43.072
Why don't we take
a walk outside?

00:13:46.576 --> 00:13:53.124
Why can we see
so many stars out here?

00:13:53.166 --> 00:13:55.793
I'm no scientist,
but if I had to guess,

00:13:55.835 --> 00:13:58.421
the mountains are
blocking out the moonlight.

00:13:58.463 --> 00:14:02.925
Ah. Makes sense.
Good thinking, Chi.

00:14:02.967 --> 00:14:06.888
Might as well just dive in.
So, about Miss Yusa.

00:14:06.929 --> 00:14:10.141
Oh, yeah. She is what
we came to talk about, huh?

00:14:10.183 --> 00:14:12.435
I found out the real reason
why she asked my uncle

00:14:12.477 --> 00:14:14.812
to work on the farm
with you guys.

00:14:14.854 --> 00:14:16.856
Do you wanna know?

00:14:16.898 --> 00:14:19.567
Yeah, but I doubt
you heard it from her.

00:14:19.609 --> 00:14:21.486
Miss Suzuno told me about it.

00:14:21.527 --> 00:14:23.654
She explained Miss Yusa
was really upset

00:14:23.696 --> 00:14:26.699
by the idea of
you doing farm work.

00:14:26.741 --> 00:14:28.993
I thought that
might be the case.

00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:31.079
Why, did you notice something?

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.622
[MAOU]
Nothing major.

00:14:32.663 --> 00:14:33.539
But it did occur to me

00:14:33.581 --> 00:14:36.459
that her family back on
Ente Isla ran a farm.

00:14:36.501 --> 00:14:37.460
Sure.

00:14:37.502 --> 00:14:40.421
I see how that would
make this upsetting.

00:14:40.463 --> 00:14:43.007
We treated her family
like they were nothing.

00:14:43.049 --> 00:14:46.344
She'd say we have no business
going anywhere near a farm.

00:14:46.386 --> 00:14:49.097
That's the gist of what
she told Miss Suzuno.

00:14:49.138 --> 00:14:51.057
It's kinda creepy.

00:14:51.099 --> 00:14:52.683
I can picture Emi's reaction

00:14:52.725 --> 00:14:55.311
to stuff like this
almost perfectly.

00:14:55.353 --> 00:14:57.230
That makes me kind of jealous.

00:14:57.271 --> 00:14:58.314
Please, don't be.

00:14:58.356 --> 00:14:59.899
No need.

00:14:59.941 --> 00:15:01.150
For real.

00:15:01.192 --> 00:15:04.987
I'm sure it's hard for her to
come to terms with things.

00:15:05.029 --> 00:15:06.614
You're right.

00:15:06.656 --> 00:15:09.700
You know, something's
been on my mind.

00:15:09.742 --> 00:15:10.827
I wonder if there's a way

00:15:10.868 --> 00:15:12.620
for all of the people
I've grown to love

00:15:12.662 --> 00:15:15.248
to find happiness
with each other.

00:15:15.289 --> 00:15:16.707
That seems doubtful.

00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:20.211
At least pretend
to give it a shot!

00:15:20.253 --> 00:15:21.045
[MAOU]
Chi?

00:15:21.087 --> 00:15:23.881
[CHIHO]
We better head back.

00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:25.550
This was such a lovely walk.

00:15:25.591 --> 00:15:26.843
Thank you for coming.

00:15:38.729 --> 00:15:41.941
[EMI] Rise and shine,
league of mediocre gentleman!

00:15:44.152 --> 00:15:46.028
Hey! What? Leave!

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:48.823
You have ten seconds to
explain what you're doing!

00:15:48.865 --> 00:15:50.658
Weren't you paying
attention yesterday?

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:53.995
I'm working here, and it's the
first day of the harvest, idiot.

00:15:54.036 --> 00:15:56.497
[MAOU] I know,
but why did you wake us at...?

00:15:56.539 --> 00:15:57.874
Huh?!

00:15:57.915 --> 00:16:00.501
This is a freakin' felony!

00:16:00.543 --> 00:16:02.211
[EMI]
It's summertime.

00:16:02.253 --> 00:16:03.296
It's normal.

00:16:03.337 --> 00:16:05.506
On your feet, nerds!

00:16:07.008 --> 00:16:08.885
[HINAKO]
Good morning, everybody!

00:16:08.926 --> 00:16:11.762
Please, escort to
yourself to an empty seat.

00:16:11.804 --> 00:16:13.055
You can't come
to someone's house

00:16:13.097 --> 00:16:15.224
and totally monopolize
their kitchen!

00:16:15.266 --> 00:16:16.767
Where might the third stooge be?

00:16:16.809 --> 00:16:19.604
Risking life and limb
by clinging to his futon.

00:16:19.645 --> 00:16:22.190
[fighting sounds]

00:16:23.024 --> 00:16:24.358
[KAZUMA] This morning,
we'll split up into teams

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.736
to harvest eggplants
and cucumbers.

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:29.238
Great, here we go.

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.532
Yusa, have you ever
picked eggplants?

00:16:31.574 --> 00:16:33.326
Yes, sir.

00:16:33.367 --> 00:16:34.702
[KAZUMA]
In that case, Maou and Yusa,

00:16:34.744 --> 00:16:36.537
you can take that greenhouse.

00:16:36.579 --> 00:16:38.831
Hinako and Kamazuki,
head over there.

00:16:38.873 --> 00:16:41.375
Ashiya, you and Pops
can take that one.

00:16:41.417 --> 00:16:44.587
Urushihara,
you're with me today.

00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:46.547
Okay, let's hit it folks!

00:16:47.089 --> 00:16:48.382
[RIHO]
Have a great time, hun.

00:16:48.424 --> 00:16:50.551
I'll pick you kids up
in four days.

00:16:50.593 --> 00:16:51.552
Thank you!

00:16:51.594 --> 00:16:52.553
Drive safe.

00:16:52.595 --> 00:16:54.138
Bye-bye!

00:16:56.474 --> 00:16:59.101
Oh, gosh. Hope it's going well.

00:17:05.816 --> 00:17:09.362
Good grief. I figured it would
be cooler in the morning,

00:17:09.403 --> 00:17:11.697
but I'm sweatin' like a hog.

00:17:11.739 --> 00:17:15.159
Do you know the reason why we
started picking these so early?

00:17:15.201 --> 00:17:16.118
Huh?

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.162
Early-morning harvests
are actually standard

00:17:18.204 --> 00:17:19.705
for summer veggies.

00:17:19.747 --> 00:17:21.707
Why's that?

00:17:21.749 --> 00:17:23.125
[EMI]
At night there's no sunlight,

00:17:23.167 --> 00:17:24.335
and temperatures go down.

00:17:24.377 --> 00:17:26.379
So plants kinda get a break.

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:28.839
They use that time
to replenish nutrients.

00:17:28.881 --> 00:17:30.508
[MAOU]
So if we pick them early,

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:31.884
they'll have just replenished

00:17:31.926 --> 00:17:34.095
and are at their
most nutritious?

00:17:34.136 --> 00:17:37.723
Yeah, exactly. Even if crops
come from the same field,

00:17:37.765 --> 00:17:38.766
they'll still taste different

00:17:38.808 --> 00:17:40.476
depending on
when they're picked.

00:17:40.518 --> 00:17:41.727
[MAOU]
Gotcha.

00:17:41.769 --> 00:17:44.772
Guess rising at the butt-crack
of dawn was worth it.

00:17:44.814 --> 00:17:45.773
So, then.

00:17:45.815 --> 00:17:47.567
If we don't finish
picking them soon,

00:17:47.608 --> 00:17:50.069
can't we come back
tomorrow morning?

00:17:50.111 --> 00:17:51.904
No.

00:17:51.946 --> 00:17:54.073
Huh? Why not?

00:17:54.115 --> 00:17:55.950
[EMI] Any vegetables
that are at their peak today

00:17:55.992 --> 00:17:59.495
will over-ripen at the
speed of light by tomorrow.

00:17:59.537 --> 00:18:02.290
They would be all spongy
and not taste as good.

00:18:02.331 --> 00:18:03.958
No way they'd sell.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.419
Harvest too late,
and you lose everything.

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:08.879
The farmer takes
a massive financial hit.

00:18:08.921 --> 00:18:10.464
Well, that sounds rough.

00:18:10.506 --> 00:18:12.883
[EMI]
Trust me, it is. I'd know.

00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:13.968
Huh?

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:15.928
Miss Suzuno told me about it.

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:18.014
She explained
Miss Yusa was really upset

00:18:18.055 --> 00:18:22.435
by the idea of
you doing farm work.

00:18:22.476 --> 00:18:24.437
What's wrong?

00:18:24.478 --> 00:18:26.188
Are you regretting what you did?

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:28.774
If you're planning
to dump your guilt on me,

00:18:28.816 --> 00:18:30.276
don't waste your time.

00:18:30.318 --> 00:18:31.527
Guilt about what?

00:18:31.569 --> 00:18:33.029
Jeez.

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:35.990
[EMI] Maybe having your
demons destroy my hometown?

00:18:36.032 --> 00:18:38.576
And burning down
my father's fields?

00:18:40.161 --> 00:18:41.370
I'm still angry.

00:18:41.412 --> 00:18:42.997
And I won't forgive you.

00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:44.290
But if you're sorry,

00:18:44.332 --> 00:18:48.002
maybe a little fraction of that
anger will start to go away.

00:18:48.044 --> 00:18:49.712
But just a tiny little bit.

00:18:49.754 --> 00:18:52.715
Like if an ant took a crap,
like that amount.

00:18:52.757 --> 00:18:55.718
In retrospect, your remorse
doesn't matter much.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.094
What?

00:18:57.136 --> 00:18:58.554
Just give it a rest.

00:18:58.596 --> 00:19:00.514
That issue is
between you and me.

00:19:00.556 --> 00:19:02.016
I don't want to
impact the Sasakis

00:19:02.058 --> 00:19:03.351
and the amazing opportunity

00:19:03.392 --> 00:19:06.520
they're giving us by
bringing the past into this.

00:19:06.562 --> 00:19:10.107
So, go ahead and farm your
little heart out, Old MgRonald.

00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:11.651
Jeez, Emi.

00:19:11.692 --> 00:19:13.235
Why "jeez"?

00:19:13.277 --> 00:19:15.988
Could you be a bigger pain?

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:17.365
[ASHIYA] Are we certain
what we're doing here

00:19:17.406 --> 00:19:19.367
is ethical, Sire?

00:19:19.408 --> 00:19:21.077
We rose quite
early this morning,

00:19:21.118 --> 00:19:23.162
and the labor was intense.

00:19:23.204 --> 00:19:24.246
But still...

00:19:24.288 --> 00:19:26.248
They're being way too nice.

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:27.667
They gave us an awesome meal,

00:19:27.708 --> 00:19:29.960
and have let us nap
for over two hours now.

00:19:30.002 --> 00:19:32.129
I feel as though Heaven
would frown upon us

00:19:32.171 --> 00:19:33.964
taking our full pay.

00:19:34.006 --> 00:19:37.093
Be real, man,
Heaven hates you already.

00:19:37.134 --> 00:19:39.887
I'm gonna need to sit here
till the end of time.

00:19:39.929 --> 00:19:41.639
You know, maybe we suck.

00:19:41.681 --> 00:19:42.848
I bet they're letting us nap

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:45.226
'cause that's all
we're qualified for.

00:19:45.267 --> 00:19:46.227
My liege.

00:19:46.268 --> 00:19:48.813
If we want work,
we'll have to go get it.

00:19:48.854 --> 00:19:49.814
Picture Yusa.

00:19:49.855 --> 00:19:53.109
She's using her unique skills
to find work around the farm.

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:55.945
Yeah.
Guess you're on to something.

00:19:55.986 --> 00:19:59.115
Let's go ask Grandma Ei
if she has any jobs for us.

00:19:59.156 --> 00:20:01.325
We got skills, too!

00:20:01.367 --> 00:20:03.119
[CHIHO]
Aw, don't cry, Hii.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:04.787
Wanna play with your new friend?

00:20:04.829 --> 00:20:05.663
Here!

00:20:05.705 --> 00:20:07.039
Come play with me!

00:20:07.081 --> 00:20:08.958
[EI]
A job? Of course.

00:20:08.999 --> 00:20:11.085
How about taking
Hitoshi on a walk

00:20:11.127 --> 00:20:12.586
to see his mama
out in the field?

00:20:12.628 --> 00:20:14.672
The poor dear's been
crying to see Hinako

00:20:14.714 --> 00:20:16.424
since she left this morning.

00:20:16.465 --> 00:20:18.300
Leave it to us, ma'am!

00:20:18.926 --> 00:20:20.761
[URUSHIHARA]
They actually got up.

00:20:20.803 --> 00:20:23.222
What inspirational
colleagues I have.

00:20:23.264 --> 00:20:24.849
I truly respect their grind.

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:28.769
[MAOU] How's the
weather up there? You hot?

00:20:28.811 --> 00:20:30.229
Nope! Hii!

00:20:30.271 --> 00:20:33.733
We have matching hats,
yours is very cool!

00:20:33.774 --> 00:20:35.151
What a sweet girl!

00:20:35.192 --> 00:20:36.610
You're little Miss Polite, huh?

00:20:36.652 --> 00:20:39.113
Yeah, miss! Hii-mi!

00:20:39.155 --> 00:20:42.533
I think your new buddy
might prefer Hii-mister.

00:20:42.575 --> 00:20:44.410
[screams]

00:20:44.452 --> 00:20:45.995
Aw, thanks!

00:20:46.036 --> 00:20:47.997
He must've missed me.

00:20:48.038 --> 00:20:48.873
Quite.

00:20:48.914 --> 00:20:51.292
Glad we could be
of service, ma'am.

00:20:51.333 --> 00:20:53.294
[MAOU]
What have you been up to?

00:20:53.335 --> 00:20:55.546
[EMI]
Just picking some millet.

00:20:55.588 --> 00:20:57.381
Hey, where's Suzuno?

00:20:57.423 --> 00:20:59.717
She's back at the house
helping out with dinner.

00:20:59.759 --> 00:21:01.719
Huh? I didn't know that.

00:21:01.761 --> 00:21:04.305
She went outside right
before you came down.

00:21:04.346 --> 00:21:07.057
I think she said she was
sharpening a knife.

00:21:08.058 --> 00:21:10.644
Well, that's big
serial killer energy.

00:21:10.686 --> 00:21:13.355
Be quiet, that's how you
become victim number one.

00:21:13.397 --> 00:21:15.441
I can let her
know you said that.

00:21:15.483 --> 00:21:18.277
I have a suspicion that
someone'll go hungry tonight.

00:21:18.319 --> 00:21:20.112
Din din! But not for Dada!

00:21:20.154 --> 00:21:22.281
I can handle a lot but not that!

00:21:22.323 --> 00:21:23.949
I'm sorry, I take it back!

00:21:23.991 --> 00:21:25.159
--Shh!
--Huh?

00:21:25.201 --> 00:21:27.244
Is something
the matter, Hinako?

00:21:27.286 --> 00:21:29.246
No. Not yet at least.

00:21:29.288 --> 00:21:30.998
Everybody needs to stay calm.

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:32.416
Crouch down and hush.

00:21:33.667 --> 00:21:34.710
Right there.

00:21:39.673 --> 00:21:41.842
--Bear!
--What now?

00:21:41.884 --> 00:21:42.843
[EMI]
Where's Kazuma?

00:21:42.885 --> 00:21:45.262
He went down to the canal.

00:21:45.304 --> 00:21:47.890
[MAOU]
Look at him. He's so thin.

00:21:47.932 --> 00:21:50.184
If he wants food,
we're in trouble.

00:21:50.226 --> 00:21:51.352
He looks hungry.

00:21:51.393 --> 00:21:54.104
Let's get out of here
before it gets closer.

00:21:54.146 --> 00:21:56.816
We could go down
where Kazuma is.

00:21:56.857 --> 00:21:58.651
That isn't a bad idea.

00:21:58.692 --> 00:22:00.361
Now, Alas Ramus.

00:22:00.402 --> 00:22:01.654
Quiet Time.

00:22:01.695 --> 00:22:03.405
Right. Quiet.

00:22:03.781 --> 00:22:06.283
[EMI]
Don't rush. Nice and slow.

00:22:07.535 --> 00:22:11.747
Honey. Please. Calm down.

00:22:11.789 --> 00:22:15.000
Hitoshi.
Mama needs you to be quiet.
