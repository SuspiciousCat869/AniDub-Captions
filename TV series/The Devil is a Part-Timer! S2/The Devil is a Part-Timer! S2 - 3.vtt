WEBVTT

00:00:14.264 --> 00:00:15.891
Wow!!

00:00:23.065 --> 00:00:25.192
We've got a fountain fan
on our hands!

00:00:25.234 --> 00:00:26.235
Ya like that?

00:00:30.447 --> 00:00:32.491
They look like some
adorable young couple out

00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:34.451
and about with their kiddo,
don't you think?

00:00:34.493 --> 00:00:35.827
--[CHIHO] Yeah.
--[ASHIYA] Quite.

00:02:10.631 --> 00:02:11.840
I feel bad for the kid.

00:02:11.882 --> 00:02:12.841
You said you'd take care of her,

00:02:12.883 --> 00:02:15.552
but you're not even prepared to
protect her from the sun!

00:02:15.594 --> 00:02:18.013
Uh... Yeah, you're right.

00:02:18.055 --> 00:02:20.974
That place probably
has some tiny hats.

00:02:21.016 --> 00:02:23.393
I don't know,
looks a little bougie.

00:02:23.435 --> 00:02:25.687
[EMI] A hat that
small won't cost much.

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:26.563
Well...

00:02:26.605 --> 00:02:28.607
[EMI]
"Well" nothing!

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.741
It looks cute on you,
and I love the colors,

00:02:37.783 --> 00:02:39.576
but it's a teeny bit too big.

00:02:39.618 --> 00:02:43.205
Then again, I'm sure
you'll grow into it soon.

00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:44.706
Nothing to add, pops?

00:02:44.748 --> 00:02:46.792
You don't need
or want my comments.

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:50.295
How long are you going
to take care of her?

00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:51.880
Hard to say.

00:02:51.922 --> 00:02:54.841
Her real parents could show up
tomorrow, and that'd be that.

00:02:54.883 --> 00:02:57.594
Or maybe she'll be
with me until she grows up.

00:02:57.636 --> 00:02:59.971
Is your plan to stay
in this world for good?

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:01.765
This will sound
weird coming from me,

00:03:01.807 --> 00:03:02.599
but aren't you worried

00:03:02.641 --> 00:03:05.227
about all the troops you
ditched in Ente Isla?

00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:08.063
[MAOU]
Nah. I've given up on all that.

00:03:08.105 --> 00:03:09.690
Huh?

00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:12.192
[RIKA] If you ask me, the
baby has Emi fever.

00:03:12.234 --> 00:03:14.528
Look at her little hat,
I'm gonna melt!

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.156
I beg you, my liege, guard your
wallet with vigilance.

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:20.617
Looks like they have
a pink or yellow ribbon.

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:23.036
Okay, kiddo. What'll it be?

00:03:23.078 --> 00:03:25.539
Hmm... Want Malkuth!

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.041
I'd imagine whatever troops
I left are wiped out.

00:03:28.083 --> 00:03:29.918
Probably have been for a while

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.963
So, they fall to pieces the
second their leader leaves.

00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:35.507
Well, that sums up
demons for ya.

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.301
[MAOU]
Aw, this is the one!

00:03:38.343 --> 00:03:39.803
[CLERK]
I can help you.

00:03:39.845 --> 00:03:41.930
Even if I did get
my magic back somehow,

00:03:41.972 --> 00:03:44.516
I couldn't conquer the
world the way I am now.

00:03:44.558 --> 00:03:45.892
We agree on something!

00:03:45.934 --> 00:03:47.227
And if all the demons are dead,

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:49.855
there's no reason to keep
calling yourself their Lord.

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:52.190
Hold up, who said all
the demons are dead?

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:53.775
Does every human
become a soldier

00:03:53.817 --> 00:03:56.278
when your people wage war?

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:57.404
She's going to wear it out,

00:03:57.446 --> 00:03:59.197
so could you remove
the tag, please?

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.158
[CLERK]
Yes, of course, sir.

00:04:02.701 --> 00:04:04.995
Ah! My cute?

00:04:05.036 --> 00:04:06.872
Yeah, you're mega cute!

00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:08.457
It's getting close to lunchtime.

00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:11.460
Maybe that means
the lines will be shorter.

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:15.672
Something must've gone down,
Emi looks POed.

00:04:15.714 --> 00:04:17.632
They probably argued
about money, huh?

00:04:17.674 --> 00:04:22.763
Ahh! Two. Thousand.
Five. Hundred.

00:04:22.804 --> 00:04:25.807
You're looking even paler
and shakier than usual.

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:30.604
Heh heh...
Yes. Astute observation.

00:04:34.983 --> 00:04:37.319
[RIKA] This is way more
boring than I thought it'd be.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.154
I expected some more aggression.

00:04:39.196 --> 00:04:41.573
Maybe children do
bring couples together.

00:04:41.615 --> 00:04:44.785
Huh? Is this all some creepy
form of entertainment to you?

00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:46.328
Ah!

00:04:46.828 --> 00:04:48.622
My sweet and innocent Chiho.

00:04:48.663 --> 00:04:50.624
You should speak
better of your big sis!

00:04:50.665 --> 00:04:53.126
Fine! I sowwy.

00:04:53.168 --> 00:04:55.003
I just wanted to know
what Emi's face

00:04:55.045 --> 00:04:56.546
would look like on
a date with this guy.

00:04:56.588 --> 00:04:58.799
Yeah, that's kinda
textbook creepy!

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.383
I'm no creep, child.

00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:01.593
I am a voyeur.

00:05:01.635 --> 00:05:02.844
[CHIHO]
That sounds even worse!

00:05:02.886 --> 00:05:05.138
Maybe you should
explain why you're here.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.225
Me? I'm not here for that.
It's just--

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:09.851
Come on. You can
spill to your sister,

00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:11.019
my lips are sealed, girl.

00:05:11.061 --> 00:05:12.521
It's nothing!

00:05:12.562 --> 00:05:14.773
Tell her, Ashiya.

00:05:14.815 --> 00:05:17.400
I'm glad someone is at
least enjoying themselves.

00:05:17.442 --> 00:05:19.820
This is the second-happiest
place on earth!

00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:23.240
Life's no fun if you're always
so stiff and proper.

00:05:23.281 --> 00:05:24.783
Time to play!

00:05:26.117 --> 00:05:27.828
[ALAS RAMUS]
Malkuth and Kether!

00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:29.538
--Aw, look atcha go!
--And Geburah and Chesed!

00:05:29.579 --> 00:05:31.706
Balloons are awesome, huh?

00:05:31.748 --> 00:05:34.042
Hold up, who said all
the demons are dead?

00:05:34.084 --> 00:05:35.502
Does every human
become a soldier

00:05:35.544 --> 00:05:37.087
when your people wage war?

00:05:37.128 --> 00:05:39.172
[EMI] I feel like I just had the
rug pulled out from under me.

00:05:39.214 --> 00:05:41.883
[MAOU]
Emi. Earth to Emi!

00:05:41.925 --> 00:05:44.219
Oh. Uh, what?

00:05:44.261 --> 00:05:46.179
You totally just spaced out.

00:05:46.221 --> 00:05:47.597
[EMI]
Huh? I was thinking, okay?

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:49.975
So sorry that I have thoughts!

00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:50.851
Oh, wow.

00:05:50.892 --> 00:05:52.727
Please don't float away, kid.

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:54.020
So what did you want?

00:05:54.062 --> 00:05:56.690
The ankle-biter wants
to check out this show.

00:05:56.731 --> 00:05:59.401
Apparently, she's
super into bright colors.

00:05:59.442 --> 00:06:02.445
[EMI] It costs extra,
though. Is that cool?

00:06:02.487 --> 00:06:04.865
Yeah, I'll have
to apologize to Ashiya.

00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:07.659
I mean, I did
already buy the hat.

00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:09.244
I'm just saying.

00:06:09.286 --> 00:06:12.122
Subtle. No worries,
I can cover it.

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:13.623
[MAOU]
I owe you!

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:20.338
Okay, sadly, this showing
is already sold out.

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.215
I got tickets for the next one.

00:06:22.257 --> 00:06:24.426
If we're stuck waiting,
do you wanna grab food?

00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:25.802
For sure.

00:06:25.844 --> 00:06:27.804
Does anything
sound yummy to you?

00:06:27.846 --> 00:06:29.639
Uhh...

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:31.808
[MAOU]
Ready to get moving?

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:32.726
[EMI]
Yup.

00:06:32.767 --> 00:06:34.060
[giggles]

00:06:34.102 --> 00:06:35.353
Look. Break's over.

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:36.855
Right.

00:06:41.359 --> 00:06:42.611
[EMI]
Too close!

00:06:50.702 --> 00:06:52.287
[RED SHINOBI]
Hup!

00:06:52.329 --> 00:06:53.538
[YELLOW SHINOBI]
Yah!

00:06:55.332 --> 00:06:57.042
Whoa!

00:06:57.083 --> 00:06:58.168
[RED SHINOBI]
Hup!

00:06:58.209 --> 00:07:00.921
Damn, that jump was from
seriously high up there!

00:07:00.962 --> 00:07:03.423
Please, you're the actual devil,
why are you impressed?

00:07:03.465 --> 00:07:05.258
Why are the ninjas so colorful?

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.718
Can't sneak around in that crap!

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.472
Do you mind not ruining the
kid how we have to watch?

00:07:12.057 --> 00:07:13.099
[SHINOBIS]
Let's go!

00:07:16.144 --> 00:07:17.771
[PINK SHINOBI]
Take this!

00:07:17.812 --> 00:07:20.690
Whoa, the pink one
has some nasty moves.

00:07:20.732 --> 00:07:23.735
Don't you think, Alas Ramus?

00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:25.904
What's up? You good?

00:07:25.946 --> 00:07:29.324
Sefi. All. All fell down.

00:07:29.366 --> 00:07:32.202
Dada. Sefi all fell down.

00:07:32.243 --> 00:07:33.578
Say what?

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.289
Everybody all fell down
from the tree.

00:07:36.331 --> 00:07:38.959
Mama got Alas Ramus
and run away.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.544
Now Malkuth is gone away.

00:07:41.586 --> 00:07:43.880
[MAOU]
What does that mean?

00:07:45.173 --> 00:07:46.174
That light!

00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:47.550
I haven't seen it pop up again

00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:49.219
since she hatched out
of the apple!

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.763
Yeah, same.
Let's get out of here!

00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:55.475
Excuse us. Emergency.

00:07:58.228 --> 00:08:00.146
[EMI] She doesn't seem
to have a fever.

00:08:00.188 --> 00:08:02.273
But go buy her a cold drink,
just in case.

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:04.567
[MAOU]
I'm on it!

00:08:04.609 --> 00:08:06.194
[LAILAH]
Is everything all right?

00:08:08.613 --> 00:08:09.990
Uh. Yes, we're fine.

00:08:10.031 --> 00:08:12.993
I think we might've had a bit
too much excitement today.

00:08:13.034 --> 00:08:14.035
Mama.

00:08:14.077 --> 00:08:15.286
I'm right here, cutie.

00:08:18.623 --> 00:08:21.543
Might I lend a helping hand?

00:08:21.584 --> 00:08:23.837
Hey! What do you
think you're doing?

00:08:29.384 --> 00:08:32.345
Gimme. Dada.

00:08:32.387 --> 00:08:33.555
Huh?!

00:08:33.596 --> 00:08:35.724
Ah! Mama!

00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:38.226
There's no reason
to be so wary of me.

00:08:38.268 --> 00:08:40.770
I promise,
I'm no enemy of yours.

00:08:40.854 --> 00:08:43.231
And certainly not of hers.

00:08:44.065 --> 00:08:45.525
My, how you've grown.

00:08:45.567 --> 00:08:47.944
I'm glad you're safe,
Alas Ramus.

00:08:47.986 --> 00:08:50.447
Huh? Why the hell do you
know her name?

00:08:50.488 --> 00:08:51.740
Why wouldn't I?

00:08:51.781 --> 00:08:54.159
It's a very important one.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.827
You should be careful.

00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:57.704
I'm sure there are many
who have taken note

00:08:57.746 --> 00:09:00.457
of the shard of Yesod
on her forehead by now.

00:09:00.498 --> 00:09:03.334
Wait a sec.
Tell me who you are.

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:04.961
[LAILAH]
The enemy is coming.

00:09:05.003 --> 00:09:08.757
Gabriel and his Heavenly
Regiment are on the move.

00:09:08.798 --> 00:09:11.968
I got it! Here!

00:09:15.472 --> 00:09:17.557
You feeling better? I'm gla--!

Thanks for nothing,
captain oblivious!

00:09:20.894 --> 00:09:22.187
She ran away!

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:29.611
[URUSHIHARA]
Wait, what thing that happened?

00:09:29.652 --> 00:09:31.946
[SUZUNO] You know.
The ordeal with the Gate.

00:09:31.988 --> 00:09:32.864
Oh, yeah.

00:09:32.906 --> 00:09:35.366
Cooking up a conspiracy
theory or something?

00:09:46.878 --> 00:09:48.671
[CHIHO]
I found 'em! Twelve o'clock!

00:09:48.713 --> 00:09:51.424
Great work Special Agent Chiho,
but how'd you do it?

00:09:51.466 --> 00:09:52.509
Guided by love?

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.302
You know what they say
about assuming, right?

00:09:54.344 --> 00:09:56.346
Don't make me
spell it out for you!

00:09:56.387 --> 00:09:57.555
What a day.

00:09:57.597 --> 00:10:00.058
I can't believe you
got sick from olive oil!

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.601
We only lost them
because you were taking

00:10:01.643 --> 00:10:03.561
your sweet time on the toilet.

00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:05.688
I'm so ashamed.

00:10:06.689 --> 00:10:08.650
Riding the Ferris wheel, I see.

00:10:08.691 --> 00:10:09.943
I wonder what sort
of naughty stuff

00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:12.403
they'll get into in a private
room way up in the sky.

00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:13.446
Are you for real?

00:10:13.488 --> 00:10:15.657
Don't worry,
I'm only messing around!

00:10:15.698 --> 00:10:17.033
We should ride this thing!

00:10:17.075 --> 00:10:19.244
Do you think you're
up for it, Ashiya?

00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:21.454
Yes. I believe so.

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:23.623
[ATTENDANT A]
Family fun time?

00:10:23.665 --> 00:10:25.083
We've got three!

00:10:25.125 --> 00:10:28.795
Right. Snuggle up
for a pic before you go!

00:10:29.546 --> 00:10:30.380
[ATTENDANT B]
Look this way!

00:10:30.421 --> 00:10:32.048
Eyes over here, mom!

00:10:34.425 --> 00:10:36.469
[ATTENDANT A] These photos
will be available at our booth!

00:10:36.511 --> 00:10:38.429
They'd be a lovely
memento of your trip.

00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:41.641
We couldn't be less interested.

00:10:41.683 --> 00:10:44.561
[ATTENDANT A]
Enjoy your ride!

00:10:44.602 --> 00:10:46.271
Jeez, what a Karen.

00:10:46.312 --> 00:10:48.022
[RIKA]
They're already on board?

00:10:48.064 --> 00:10:49.107
Go quick!

00:10:49.149 --> 00:10:50.400
They might split us up!

00:10:50.441 --> 00:10:51.234
I'm coming!

00:10:51.276 --> 00:10:54.070
Young lady, could you
help me buy some tickets?

00:10:54.112 --> 00:10:55.155
[CHIHO]
Of course!

00:10:55.196 --> 00:10:56.781
First you put
your money in here-

00:10:56.823 --> 00:10:59.117
If you come with me,
we'll get your picture taken!

00:10:59.159 --> 00:11:01.369
It'd be the perfect memento!

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.582
[ATTENDANT B] What's with
the frown, Mister Boyfriend?

00:11:05.623 --> 00:11:07.292
Say cheese.

00:11:08.001 --> 00:11:09.836
Thank you for
all your help, dear.

00:11:09.878 --> 00:11:11.462
Yeah, you saved the day!

00:11:11.504 --> 00:11:13.339
Anytime. Huh?

00:11:18.344 --> 00:11:20.555
[CHIHO]
Whaaaa...?

00:11:20.597 --> 00:11:22.640
We totally abandoned Chiho.

00:11:22.682 --> 00:11:24.851
[ASHIYA]
Yes, indeed we did.

00:11:24.893 --> 00:11:25.685
Tell me.

00:11:25.727 --> 00:11:27.729
Why'd you want
her to live with you?

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:30.190
And why keep her at your place?

00:11:30.231 --> 00:11:31.733
Well, it's uh--

00:11:31.774 --> 00:11:33.443
That crest on her forehead.

00:11:33.484 --> 00:11:36.112
It's obvious you recognize it.

00:11:36.154 --> 00:11:37.989
No more secrets!

00:11:38.031 --> 00:11:41.618
If we had been quicker,
we'd have a better view.

00:11:41.659 --> 00:11:44.370
You okay? Is something wrong?

00:11:44.412 --> 00:11:46.206
No! I'm fine.

00:11:46.247 --> 00:11:49.167
I just feel bad for leaving
our pal stuck down there.

00:11:49.209 --> 00:11:51.628
Sorry, Chiho!

00:11:54.631 --> 00:11:56.633
Huh?

00:11:58.301 --> 00:12:00.970
[RIKA]
A private room in the sky.

00:12:01.012 --> 00:12:03.514
Are you absolutely
sure you're feeling well?

00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:06.017
Your face is taking
on a reddish color.

00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:09.562
Uh... That's weird,
but I'm really all right!

00:12:09.604 --> 00:12:12.273
Maybe my sunscreen
didn't work or something.

00:12:12.315 --> 00:12:15.109
So? Are you gonna tell me
the truth, or should I kill you?

00:12:15.151 --> 00:12:16.611
[MAOU]
Is there a not-crappy option?

00:12:16.653 --> 00:12:18.029
You seriously need to chill out

00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:20.031
with the death threats
in front of the kid!

00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:21.366
Let's just say I'm her dad,

00:12:21.407 --> 00:12:23.493
that's a hundred percent
okay with me.

00:12:23.534 --> 00:12:26.162
It stopped being that simple
when a mystery lady in all white

00:12:26.204 --> 00:12:28.915
showed up and started talking
about a heavenly regiment!

00:12:28.957 --> 00:12:30.416
Unless you want me
as an enemy again,

00:12:30.458 --> 00:12:32.252
tell me everything
you know right now!

00:12:32.293 --> 00:12:34.379
Oh, and you'll be
my ally if I do?

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.881
Not yours, moron. The kid's.

00:12:36.923 --> 00:12:38.549
Huh?

00:12:43.137 --> 00:12:45.848
[MAOU] It started
before I ruled the demons.

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:49.686
Back when I was barely
stronger than a goblin.

00:12:49.727 --> 00:12:52.272
The demon realm
was super brutal.

00:12:52.313 --> 00:12:56.276
Battles to the death
were an everyday occurrence.

00:12:56.317 --> 00:12:58.528
All it took was for one
muscle-for-brains monster

00:12:58.569 --> 00:12:59.821
to come along.

00:12:59.862 --> 00:13:01.864
My clan was wiped out.

00:13:01.906 --> 00:13:03.825
My home, gone.

00:13:03.866 --> 00:13:06.703
The last memory
I have of my parents?

00:13:06.744 --> 00:13:10.832
Is them lying lifeless
on the ground.

00:13:10.873 --> 00:13:14.127
I was almost
right here with them.

00:13:14.168 --> 00:13:16.546
But for whatever reason,

00:13:16.587 --> 00:13:20.550
someone decided this snot-nosed
demon kid needed saving.

00:13:20.591 --> 00:13:23.177
That's the first time
I met an angel.

00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:25.430
I tried attacking her.

00:13:25.471 --> 00:13:28.891
But she brushed
me off like a gnat.

00:13:33.354 --> 00:13:37.692
[MAOU] Instead of killing me
that day, she saved my life.

00:13:37.734 --> 00:13:40.194
She would talk to me while
my wounds were healing.

00:13:40.236 --> 00:13:42.655
She taught me things
I'd never heard of before,

00:13:42.697 --> 00:13:45.742
and explained things
I never quite understood

00:13:45.783 --> 00:13:48.411
The more I learned, the more
I realized how weird it was

00:13:48.453 --> 00:13:50.455
for an angel to save a demon.

00:13:50.496 --> 00:13:55.543
So I asked her,
"Why did you help me?"

00:13:55.585 --> 00:13:58.046
What'd she say?

00:13:58.087 --> 00:13:59.630
Don't laugh at me.

00:13:59.672 --> 00:14:02.133
If you do,
I won't finish the story.

00:14:04.886 --> 00:14:09.015
[MAOU] So, uh, I was crying
when she found me.

00:14:09.057 --> 00:14:12.560
She saved me because I was
the first demon she'd seen cry.

00:14:12.602 --> 00:14:14.604
Why were you crying?

00:14:14.645 --> 00:14:16.939
I wasn't sad, exactly.

00:14:16.981 --> 00:14:18.566
Maybe I was just weak.

00:14:18.608 --> 00:14:23.613
Or maybe because death didn't
seem fair--I don't really know.

00:14:23.654 --> 00:14:25.156
It was this angel who told me

00:14:25.198 --> 00:14:28.326
about the existence
of a "human" realm.

00:14:28.368 --> 00:14:30.119
[EMI]
His invasion of Ente Isla

00:14:30.161 --> 00:14:32.997
was indirectly
caused by an angel?

00:14:33.039 --> 00:14:35.792
Weird, but Alas Ramus's
crest is the same shape

00:14:35.833 --> 00:14:40.880
as a crystal the angel left
behind before she vanished.

00:14:40.922 --> 00:14:43.674
With it, there was a
mysterious note that said,

00:14:43.716 --> 00:14:45.885
"If you want to know
more about this world,

00:14:45.927 --> 00:14:48.054
plant this seed
and help it grow.

00:14:48.096 --> 00:14:51.057
Do your best, Demon King Satan."

00:14:51.099 --> 00:14:53.351
Without all the knowledge
she had given me,

00:14:53.393 --> 00:14:57.021
I couldn't have unified
the demon realm.

00:14:57.063 --> 00:14:59.816
So, I did just as she told me.

00:14:59.857 --> 00:15:03.111
I had faith it would lead
to something good.

00:15:03.152 --> 00:15:05.613
I planted the crystal
and helped it grow strong.

00:15:05.655 --> 00:15:07.615
Guess that makes me her dad.

00:15:07.657 --> 00:15:09.784
Did you ever get
the name of that angel?

00:15:09.826 --> 00:15:12.537
[MAOU] Don't worry about it,
it's no one you would know.

00:15:12.578 --> 00:15:15.998
More importantly, how'd you
get our girl back to normal?

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.959
[EMI]
That lady in white healed her.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.294
All she had to do
was lift up her hand.

00:15:20.336 --> 00:15:21.170
Then what?

00:15:21.212 --> 00:15:22.296
[EMI]
She mentioned something

00:15:22.338 --> 00:15:27.009
about Gabriel and
a "shard of Yesod."

00:15:27.051 --> 00:15:28.177
Excuse me?

00:15:28.219 --> 00:15:30.430
You must've been a seriously
crappy Church knight!

00:15:30.471 --> 00:15:31.848
Huh?

00:15:31.889 --> 00:15:33.141
Shit, Yesod?

00:15:33.182 --> 00:15:35.059
So that's what
all this is all about.

00:15:35.101 --> 00:15:36.853
Dada, okay?

00:15:36.894 --> 00:15:38.479
Yeah, but I need your help.

00:15:38.521 --> 00:15:39.814
What's the red one called?

00:15:39.856 --> 00:15:40.815
Geburah!

00:15:40.857 --> 00:15:42.024
What about the white?

00:15:42.066 --> 00:15:43.317
Kether!

00:15:43.359 --> 00:15:44.318
[MAOU]
Yellow?

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.571
[ALAS RAMUS]
Malkuth! My buddy!

00:15:46.612 --> 00:15:48.865
Good job. Wow. Smarty!

00:15:48.906 --> 00:15:51.159
Smarty?

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.618
[EMI]
What was that about?

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.495
I have a feeling this kiddo
is something way bigger

00:15:54.537 --> 00:15:57.623
than your average
angel or demon.

00:15:57.665 --> 00:16:01.502
Geburah, Kether,
Malkuth, and Yesod.

00:16:01.544 --> 00:16:03.463
They're all names of sephiroth,

00:16:03.504 --> 00:16:06.799
the world-forming jewels that
grow on the Tree of Life.

00:16:06.841 --> 00:16:09.844
Alas Ramus might be
an incarnation of Yesod.

00:16:18.352 --> 00:16:20.021
[CHIHO]
It's hard to admit.

00:16:20.062 --> 00:16:22.356
But I'm only here
because I'm jealous.

00:16:22.398 --> 00:16:25.735
I can't believe
I creeped on my friends.

00:16:25.776 --> 00:16:29.655
And after Mister Maou told me
how much he trusts me.

00:16:29.697 --> 00:16:31.908
I'm the worst.

00:16:31.949 --> 00:16:34.994
[ALAS RAMUS]
Dada! Can we get it!

00:16:35.036 --> 00:16:36.037
A thousand yen?

00:16:36.078 --> 00:16:37.163
We'll take it.

00:16:37.205 --> 00:16:41.125
Uh. Hey. You don't mind?

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:43.002
I'm not doing you a favor.

00:16:43.044 --> 00:16:46.047
I have to buy it, it's the
first picture she's been in.

00:16:46.088 --> 00:16:47.840
Don't show it to a soul.

00:16:47.882 --> 00:16:50.426
If this gets out, it could
compromise my position!

00:16:50.468 --> 00:16:53.012
It'll be safe, right?

00:16:53.054 --> 00:16:55.973
Ah! Oh, thank you, Mama!

00:16:57.475 --> 00:17:00.061
Come on, let's keep it moving.

00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:04.815
--Urushihara? Whats up?
--Hello? Hi, Bel.

00:17:06.984 --> 00:17:09.695
Hey, wait a sec, where did
everybody run off to?

00:17:09.737 --> 00:17:12.448
It seems even
Miss Sasaki has vanished.

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:15.701
That's a little weird.

00:17:15.743 --> 00:17:17.453
Hey, how are you, Emi?

00:17:17.495 --> 00:17:20.706
Is the big date going okay?

00:17:20.748 --> 00:17:23.501
Wait, there was some
emergency at home?

00:17:23.543 --> 00:17:25.545
Oh, gosh. Stay safe.

00:17:26.295 --> 00:17:27.630
Our targets have left.

00:17:27.672 --> 00:17:29.423
Miss Sasaki might've as well.

00:17:29.465 --> 00:17:31.217
Maybe, but I still feel bad.

00:17:31.259 --> 00:17:33.261
Apologize to Chiho
when you see her.

00:17:33.302 --> 00:17:34.845
And say it's from me, too.

00:17:34.887 --> 00:17:36.597
Shouldn't be a problem.

00:17:36.639 --> 00:17:38.766
I suppose I'll be on my way now.

00:17:38.808 --> 00:17:41.769
Thank you for
your great assistance.

00:17:41.811 --> 00:17:44.522
Uh... Just one more thing!

00:17:44.564 --> 00:17:45.856
[ASHIYA]
Yes?

00:17:45.898 --> 00:17:48.693
[RIKA] Oh, crap,
why didn't I let him walk away?

00:17:53.322 --> 00:17:55.157
Here, you should
have my phone number.

00:17:55.199 --> 00:17:57.201
Just in case something happens.

00:17:57.243 --> 00:17:58.578
Ah, thank you, I might require

00:17:58.619 --> 00:18:00.580
your surveillance
skills in the future.

00:18:00.621 --> 00:18:02.081
Goodbye!

00:18:03.708 --> 00:18:05.960
Would you like to
purchase your photo?

00:18:15.469 --> 00:18:17.513
Sorry. They caught me off-guard.

00:18:17.555 --> 00:18:20.016
Oh! Hi! We haven't
been too rough.

00:18:20.057 --> 00:18:23.269
I'm hopeful that we can work out
any kinks with diplomacy.

00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:24.895
So, are you Gabriel?

00:18:24.937 --> 00:18:26.897
[GABRIEL]
Yes! Tis I!

00:18:26.939 --> 00:18:28.649
I didn't expect a
personal appearance

00:18:28.691 --> 00:18:30.943
from Yesod's guardian angel.

00:18:30.985 --> 00:18:32.153
Well, here I am.

00:18:32.194 --> 00:18:34.196
I'll take the kid, and
your friend's sacred sword.

00:18:34.238 --> 00:18:36.240
Also, so sorry, but we also took

00:18:36.282 --> 00:18:38.284
that yummy pizza
Lucifer ordered.

00:18:38.326 --> 00:18:41.621
Oh! Don't fret,
we can pay you back.

00:18:41.662 --> 00:18:42.997
That's not the issue!

00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:44.749
I mean, it's not the main issue.

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:46.834
Uhp! If you don't
hand over the girl,

00:18:46.876 --> 00:18:49.712
you can kiss your
precious pizza money goodbye.

00:18:49.754 --> 00:18:52.798
What kind of parent trades
their kid for pizza money?

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.133
[GABRIEL]
Come on.

00:18:54.175 --> 00:18:55.843
When I found out the
child's shard was taken

00:18:55.885 --> 00:18:59.013
from the Devil's Castle,
I was seriously bummed out.

00:18:59.055 --> 00:19:00.640
But when I started to
sense its energy again,

00:19:00.681 --> 00:19:02.767
I was over the moon!

00:19:02.808 --> 00:19:04.518
So... Pretty please?

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.103
May I have her back?

00:19:06.145 --> 00:19:09.523
No! Bad man took Kether
and Binah and Chokmah!

00:19:09.565 --> 00:19:11.359
He took buddy Malkuth!

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.569
Hate him!

00:19:13.611 --> 00:19:16.364
It's clear she doesn't want
anything to do with you.

00:19:16.405 --> 00:19:18.449
As her dad,
I won't let you take her!

00:19:18.491 --> 00:19:20.284
[GABRIEL]
Aw! Can I have the sword, then?

00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:21.535
Are you dumb, or stupid?

00:19:21.577 --> 00:19:24.288
It's my possession
until I achieve my goal.

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:27.708
So the rub here is that I can't
go home without the little one.

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:29.502
Mmkay? Pretty please?

00:19:29.543 --> 00:19:30.586
Not a chance.

00:19:30.628 --> 00:19:31.796
No matter what?

00:19:31.837 --> 00:19:33.130
No matter what.

00:19:33.172 --> 00:19:36.509
You might become target number
one on Heaven's Most Wanted.

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:38.302
[MAOU] I'm not about
to ruin this kid's life

00:19:38.344 --> 00:19:41.430
just to save my own.

00:19:41.472 --> 00:19:43.057
[GABRIEL]
Bummer.

00:19:43.099 --> 00:19:45.601
I hate when I have to use force.

00:19:45.643 --> 00:19:48.062
This pains me
as much as it will you.

00:19:49.522 --> 00:19:50.523
Dada!

00:19:50.564 --> 00:19:53.067
Even if you were at
full power, I'm sure I'd win.

00:19:53.109 --> 00:19:55.236
If you're smart,
you'll give me the child.

00:19:55.277 --> 00:19:57.029
Well? Are ya smart?

00:19:57.071 --> 00:19:58.197
Are you?

00:19:58.239 --> 00:19:59.865
I'm the ruler of demons, dude,

00:19:59.907 --> 00:20:02.243
pissing off angels comes
with the territory!

00:20:02.284 --> 00:20:04.120
And once I finally
conquer the world,

00:20:04.161 --> 00:20:06.997
I plan on making this girl
the heir to my throne!

00:20:07.039 --> 00:20:08.666
You leave me no choice.

00:20:08.708 --> 00:20:11.627
I'll try my best to go
easy on you, though.

00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:14.797
I can stop the very
second you admit defeat.

00:20:15.756 --> 00:20:17.258
Mister Maou!

00:20:17.299 --> 00:20:19.260
Chiho? Hurry! Run!

00:20:19.301 --> 00:20:22.930
I just came by to apologize
for what I did today.

00:20:22.972 --> 00:20:25.141
Then I saw what
was going on over here.

00:20:25.182 --> 00:20:28.144
I know I probably can't do much
to help with stuff like this.

00:20:28.185 --> 00:20:30.396
But I've gotta try something!

00:20:30.438 --> 00:20:32.314
This is far beyond
your comprehension.

00:20:32.356 --> 00:20:34.191
As a human of this world.

00:20:34.233 --> 00:20:35.067
[CHIHO]
Oh, please,

00:20:35.109 --> 00:20:38.195
I already know all about
Mister Maou and Ente Isla.

00:20:38.237 --> 00:20:39.947
I even know that you're
probably an angel here

00:20:39.989 --> 00:20:42.074
to take away Alas Ramus!

00:20:42.116 --> 00:20:45.035
Wow! So you pegged me
as an angel, eh?

00:20:45.077 --> 00:20:46.954
Is it my beauty and grace?

00:20:46.996 --> 00:20:49.790
No, but out of everyone who's
been mean to Mister Maou,

00:20:49.832 --> 00:20:52.668
the bulk of them
have been angels.

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:54.712
[URUSHIHARA]
She's not impressed, bro.

00:20:54.754 --> 00:20:56.672
As you can see, we're very busy.

00:20:56.714 --> 00:20:59.759
For your own safety,
you should hurry along home now.

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.093
I beg you, sir!

00:21:01.135 --> 00:21:03.679
Please don't take Alas Ramus
away from her home!

00:21:03.721 --> 00:21:05.347
She loves Mister Maou
and Miss Yusa

00:21:05.389 --> 00:21:07.558
like she's known
them for her entire life!

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.059
You can't do this!

00:21:09.101 --> 00:21:10.478
Wha--? There's no need to cry!

00:21:10.519 --> 00:21:12.146
Feelings are not my forte!

00:21:12.188 --> 00:21:13.773
Please, no puppy dog eyes!

00:21:13.814 --> 00:21:15.941
You're making me
look like the bad guy here!

00:21:15.983 --> 00:21:19.069
I beg you. Don't take her!

00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:21.238
All right, fine! Keep the baby.

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:25.409
For now. Tomorrow morning,
we'll be back for her.

00:21:25.451 --> 00:21:27.787
Crew, take wing. Capiche?

00:21:27.828 --> 00:21:29.580
I sound like a wiseguy!

00:21:29.622 --> 00:21:31.457
I'm an angel, not a gangster!

00:21:36.545 --> 00:21:40.466
Hello, every--
Urushihara! Explain this!

00:21:40.508 --> 00:21:42.218
Not the time, pizza police.

00:21:42.259 --> 00:21:43.260
There's real problems.

00:21:43.302 --> 00:21:46.055
Forget Ashiya,
he missed out on the climax.

00:21:46.096 --> 00:21:47.681
So, what's our plan, chief?

00:21:47.723 --> 00:21:49.141
That's up to the kiddo.

00:21:49.183 --> 00:21:51.310
Be honest, do you want
to go with that guy?

00:21:51.352 --> 00:21:52.895
No!

00:21:52.937 --> 00:21:53.813
Thought so.

00:21:53.854 --> 00:21:55.147
Then that's what we'll do.

00:21:55.189 --> 00:21:57.566
Tomorrow, we're gonna
mount an all-out resistance.

00:21:57.608 --> 00:21:59.860
Huh? You can't
be serious right now!

00:21:59.902 --> 00:22:01.695
Bel and I can't just
go up against an angel

00:22:01.737 --> 00:22:02.988
in broad daylight like--

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:04.281
I understand.

00:22:04.323 --> 00:22:06.158
I also understand
determination alone

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.118
isn't enough
to win this fight.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.913
Sometimes, being an adult
means to plan for the worst

00:22:10.955 --> 00:22:13.207
and manage risk later.

00:22:13.249 --> 00:22:14.542
By the way...

00:22:14.583 --> 00:22:15.584
Yeah, what?

00:22:15.626 --> 00:22:18.087
You sleep here.
For tonight, at least.

00:22:18.128 --> 00:22:19.547
--Huh?
--Ahh!

00:22:19.588 --> 00:22:20.548
[CHIHO gasps]

00:22:20.589 --> 00:22:22.925
Huuuuuuuh?!
