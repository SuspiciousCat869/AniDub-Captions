WEBVTT

00:00:10.636 --> 00:00:12.804
[MAOU chuckles creepily]

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:16.141
Too beautiful for this world.

00:00:16.183 --> 00:00:18.101
Hey, uh, Mister Maou?

00:00:18.143 --> 00:00:19.186
[gasps]

00:00:22.481 --> 00:00:24.942
I didn't see you there, Chi.
What's up?

00:00:24.983 --> 00:00:27.402
It's about time
for the big meeting.

00:00:29.112 --> 00:00:31.907
Well, team.
We shut down tomorrow.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.420
Uhhh... What do you mean
when you say, "we shut down"?

00:02:08.462 --> 00:02:11.006
We've had this remodel
scheduled for a long time.

00:02:11.048 --> 00:02:14.259
The earliest we could hope for
it to be done by is mid-August.

00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:16.803
I told you all of this at
a meeting weeks ago.

00:02:16.845 --> 00:02:19.264
Oh, gosh. That meeting was
when you were depressed

00:02:19.306 --> 00:02:22.726
'cause you thought Alas Ramus
was gone for good, huh?

00:02:26.104 --> 00:02:29.441
Really?
You tuned out the announcement?

00:02:29.483 --> 00:02:30.734
Oopsie.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.785
Wait, what's going on in here?
Are you moving out, Suz?

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:41.244
[EMI]
What are you talking about?

00:02:41.286 --> 00:02:43.121
Shouldn't you be
doing the same thing?

00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:44.623
[BOTH]
Hmm?

00:02:45.874 --> 00:02:49.711
Read this. Refrain
from fainting like Alciel.

00:02:50.587 --> 00:02:52.964
"Residents. Due to the
upcoming maintenance,

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:56.093
I ask that you temporarily
vacate the premises..."

00:02:56.134 --> 00:02:57.678
Cool, and go where?

00:02:57.719 --> 00:02:59.971
We received that
notice two weeks ago.

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:03.141
I'll be staying with Emilia
for the time being, but I--

00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:05.727
Did you hear?
We're done for!

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.231
[ASHIYA]
Goodbye. Sweet castle.

00:03:09.272 --> 00:03:10.982
Ashiya?

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:14.611
[ASHIYA]
Your Majesty. Welcome home.

00:03:14.653 --> 00:03:17.739
It turns out I'm gonna be
sorta jobless for a second?

00:03:17.781 --> 00:03:19.533
My bad.

00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:27.457
[ASHIYA] We received this parcel
from the landlady two weeks ago.

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:29.960
Perchance it contains
some glimmer of hope.

00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:32.129
Well, are you gonna
stare at it, or open it?

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.089
Ahhh! You don't
know what's in there!

00:03:34.131 --> 00:03:37.092
I'm plagued with nightmares of
the postcard she once sent us!

00:03:37.134 --> 00:03:39.177
My eyes!

00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:44.349
An earthling artifact?
A video tape!

00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:47.144
Too bad that tech is
virtually extinct in Japan.

00:03:47.185 --> 00:03:49.354
We have no way to watch it here.

00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:51.398
So, let's pretend
we never got it.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.152
Y'know, I think my family
still has an old VHS player.

00:03:55.193 --> 00:03:57.028
Wanna watch at my place?

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.572
Why?

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:02.659
Look, it's the famous Maou!

00:04:02.701 --> 00:04:05.162
Be cool, Mom.
We talked about this.

00:04:05.203 --> 00:04:06.538
Thank you for having us.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.915
Sorry to barge in
on such short notice.

00:04:08.957 --> 00:04:11.376
Nice to meet you.
I'm Emi Yusa.

00:04:11.418 --> 00:04:14.379
Here, a little something
to say thanks?

00:04:14.421 --> 00:04:18.091
Aw. You're just as sweet as
Chiho tells me you are.

00:04:18.133 --> 00:04:20.677
Come in, make yourself at home.

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:30.061
Egypt, huh? She's fancy.

00:04:32.606 --> 00:04:34.941
I hear you boys met
with some misfortune.

00:04:34.983 --> 00:04:37.569
I'm sorry your
apartment was damaged

00:04:37.611 --> 00:04:38.612
Luckily for you,

00:04:38.653 --> 00:04:41.615
repairs are always the
landlady's responsibility.

00:04:41.656 --> 00:04:43.658
So fear not, gentlemen.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.911
However, you'll need to leave
the apartment for a bit

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:47.996
while mommy cleans this up.

00:04:48.038 --> 00:04:51.374
In return, I have
something to ask of you.

00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:53.710
I have a niece in
Choshi City, Chiba.

00:04:53.752 --> 00:04:57.255
She runs an adorable little
snack shack down by the seaside.

00:04:57.297 --> 00:05:00.550
All I ask is that you young men
go and lend her a hand.

00:05:00.592 --> 00:05:01.718
Whaddya say?

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.805
You can work there while the
repairs are happening back home.

00:05:04.846 --> 00:05:08.308
Wha...? But Choshi
is super far away.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:12.437
If you're interested, give a
ringy-ding to the number here.

00:05:12.521 --> 00:05:14.439
You better do
as the pharaoh says!

00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:16.233
This opportunity is perfect!

00:05:16.274 --> 00:05:17.150
I'm with her!

00:05:17.192 --> 00:05:20.612
This solves your housing, job,
and money problems all at once!

00:05:20.654 --> 00:05:23.114
Yeah, you're right. I'll call.

00:05:27.953 --> 00:05:28.995
[AMANE]
Heyo!

00:05:29.037 --> 00:05:30.247
Sorry to call so late.

00:05:30.288 --> 00:05:32.082
I just got word from Miss Shiba

00:05:32.123 --> 00:05:34.084
that you might have
a job opening available?

00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:36.837
[AMANE] Oh, you're the dude
who rents from Aunt Mikitty!

00:05:36.878 --> 00:05:40.465
"Mikitty"...? Uh, yeah!
Name's Maou by the way.

00:05:40.507 --> 00:05:41.716
[AMANE]
Trust me, I know.

00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:44.094
You left me hanging for
so long, I almost gave up!

00:05:44.135 --> 00:05:47.264
Sorry. Our communication
had some hiccups.

00:05:47.305 --> 00:05:48.348
[AMANE]
I believe it.

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.767
Auntie's a crazy globetrotter.

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:51.726
So, you in?

00:05:51.768 --> 00:05:55.063
Maybe. I'd appreciate a few
more details about the gig.

00:05:55.105 --> 00:05:57.107
I just know it's at a beach.

00:05:57.148 --> 00:05:58.525
[AMANE]
You know where Kimigahama is?

00:05:58.567 --> 00:06:01.027
Uh-uh. Huh?

00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:05.031
[MAOU]
Okay. Got it.

00:06:05.073 --> 00:06:07.909
[AMANE] For pay,
how does 10,000-yen a day

00:06:07.951 --> 00:06:08.952
plus food sound?

00:06:08.994 --> 00:06:12.205
Ten thousand a day?
Sounds great!

00:06:12.247 --> 00:06:13.999
How many workers you need?

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.166
[AMANE]
How many you got?

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:16.626
Three strapping young men!

00:06:16.668 --> 00:06:17.794
[CHIHO, EMI]
Wait a sec.

00:06:17.836 --> 00:06:21.381
[AMANE] Gnarly. It's intense
work, so the more the better.

00:06:21.423 --> 00:06:23.133
How fast can you get here?

00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:26.845
Well, then. That's that!

00:06:26.887 --> 00:06:29.222
We'll start working
the day after tomorrow.

00:06:29.264 --> 00:06:32.309
On the phone, you said you
were bringing three men, right?

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:36.313
Does that include Urushihara?
Can he contribute anything?

00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:39.482
Ashiya and I will have
to cover for "His Slackness."

00:06:42.777 --> 00:06:44.070
[MAOU]
I'm home!

00:06:44.112 --> 00:06:46.323
Congrats, you dweebs have jobs!

00:06:46.364 --> 00:06:49.034
Is that so?
Great work, Sire!

00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:50.744
We'll be staying
with Shiba's niece.

00:06:50.785 --> 00:06:54.331
There's a beach snack shack.
We'll work there till Bon ends.

00:06:54.372 --> 00:06:57.959
A snack shack?
That's perfect for you.

00:06:57.959 --> 00:07:01.421
Perfect for us, I hope. You're
working there, too, y'know.

00:07:01.463 --> 00:07:04.549
Wait? For real?
I'm not cut out for labor, dude.

00:07:04.591 --> 00:07:07.302
What are you cut out for,
eating junk and spending money?

00:07:07.344 --> 00:07:09.095
Someone gets me, finally.

00:07:09.137 --> 00:07:11.222
It's too hot to
work on the beach.

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:12.891
We're all gonna melt.

00:07:12.933 --> 00:07:15.685
It's crappy you didn't
ask my opinion first.

00:07:15.727 --> 00:07:18.063
Think of this as a
rehabilitation facility

00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:19.439
for your lifestyle.

00:07:19.481 --> 00:07:21.983
Perhaps on the other side,
you won't be such a hot mess.

00:07:22.025 --> 00:07:24.027
Hop off, robo-jerk!

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:26.821
Everybody here knows
I've never had a job before.

00:07:26.863 --> 00:07:29.866
I'll probably just
get in the way.

00:07:29.908 --> 00:07:34.287
Mama, you help him!
Nobody bully Luci!

00:07:36.915 --> 00:07:38.124
I'll show you guys!

00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:41.586
Burger Boy'll look
like a slacker next to me!

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:45.090
Maou was sweet.
He's a good man.

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:46.341
[CHIHO]
Hmm?

00:07:46.383 --> 00:07:48.551
What? You should
be happy that your crush

00:07:48.593 --> 00:07:50.303
gets the mom
stamp of approval.

00:07:50.345 --> 00:07:51.721
How embarrassing!

00:07:51.763 --> 00:07:53.223
He clearly works hard.

00:07:53.264 --> 00:07:56.393
Plus, he was polite and doesn't
seem to be leading you on.

00:07:56.434 --> 00:07:59.354
Lucky me, I don't think
I'll have to worry one bit.

00:07:59.396 --> 00:08:01.773
Huh? Worry about what?

00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:03.566
When you first heard
about the trip to Choshi,

00:08:03.608 --> 00:08:06.069
you seemed uneasy
about this Urushihara guy,

00:08:06.111 --> 00:08:09.155
your scrunched up
forehead gave it away.

00:08:09.197 --> 00:08:10.407
Just so we're clear.

00:08:10.448 --> 00:08:12.909
If you ask for permission
to go with those boys,

00:08:12.951 --> 00:08:15.161
my answer isn't going to be yes.

00:08:15.203 --> 00:08:17.414
All right. I thought so.

00:08:17.455 --> 00:08:20.417
But y'know,
I liked that Emi girl, also.

00:08:20.458 --> 00:08:23.169
If you went with her and
promised me you'd be safe,

00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:26.089
I think I could be
convinced pretty easily.

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:29.551
[SUZUNO]
You were very cooperative

00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:31.761
with the Devil today.

00:08:31.803 --> 00:08:33.430
I don't want them
to get desperate.

00:08:33.471 --> 00:08:36.224
Who knows what crazy stunt
they might pull under pressure?

00:08:36.266 --> 00:08:37.058
Let's not forget,

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:40.145
Lucifer has a history of
wreaking havoc in Japan.

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:44.024
Ah, understood. Should we
attempt to follow them?

00:08:44.065 --> 00:08:45.066
Choshi is far.

00:08:45.108 --> 00:08:48.528
If they start any trouble, we
couldn't reach them quickly.

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.196
[EMI]
You're right.

00:08:50.238 --> 00:08:51.948
But something tells me
they won't act up

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:54.284
in a place associated
with their landlady.

00:08:54.325 --> 00:08:55.994
They don't want
to burn that bridge.

00:08:56.036 --> 00:08:57.704
Huh?

00:08:57.746 --> 00:09:01.166
Also, we've gotta think
about Chiho.

00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:02.792
Now that she's
associated with us,

00:09:02.834 --> 00:09:05.503
we can't just leave her
here to fend for herself.

00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:06.838
If we do decide to go,

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.506
we should try to get
her mother's permission

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:10.300
to bring her along.

00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:14.471
[KISAKI]
Excellent!

00:09:14.512 --> 00:09:17.140
That's great news. You go, Ma.

00:09:17.182 --> 00:09:19.017
[MAOU]
I'm sorry I worried you.

00:09:19.059 --> 00:09:22.145
Hush. You'll come back, right?

00:09:22.187 --> 00:09:23.021
Huh?

00:09:23.063 --> 00:09:25.607
[KISAKI] You're finally ready
to be my right-hand man.

00:09:25.648 --> 00:09:28.318
It'd be a shame to
lose my top employee.

00:09:28.359 --> 00:09:29.861
[MAOU]
Hmph.

00:09:29.903 --> 00:09:33.031
I promise. I'll be back soon.

00:09:33.073 --> 00:09:34.824
[knocking on door]

00:09:34.866 --> 00:09:35.867
Good afternoon!

00:09:35.909 --> 00:09:38.203
Oh, hey, Chi!
Why're you here?

00:09:38.244 --> 00:09:39.412
Hi, Mister Maou!

00:09:39.454 --> 00:09:42.332
I just swung by to grab
a few things from my locker.

00:09:42.373 --> 00:09:43.833
Ah! Want help?

00:09:43.875 --> 00:09:45.418
Yes, please!

00:09:49.964 --> 00:09:51.925
Maou!

00:09:51.966 --> 00:09:53.802
Well! I bite my
thumb at you sir,

00:09:53.843 --> 00:09:55.386
for despite
my magnanimous decline

00:09:55.428 --> 00:09:57.430
of Gabriel's appetizing
offer of partnership,

00:09:57.472 --> 00:10:00.100
you failed to warn me that your
establishment would be closing,

00:10:00.141 --> 00:10:01.851
therefore cloistering
my love away!

00:10:01.893 --> 00:10:02.685
Take a chill pill

00:10:02.727 --> 00:10:05.105
and repeat that part about
Gabriel again please.

00:10:05.146 --> 00:10:07.565
[SARUE]
Hmm?

00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:09.859
Might I implore you to
show me the steep and thorny

00:10:09.901 --> 00:10:11.945
way to heaven over
a plate of Sentucky Fried's

00:10:11.986 --> 00:10:13.863
new chicken twisters,
fair maiden?

00:10:13.905 --> 00:10:16.366
Miss Kisaki's gonna love this.

00:10:16.407 --> 00:10:17.617
Our secret, darling?

00:10:17.659 --> 00:10:21.121
Only if you tell us what
happened with Gabriel.

00:10:21.162 --> 00:10:23.289
You're starting
to sound like Emi.

00:10:23.331 --> 00:10:24.124
Fine.

00:10:24.165 --> 00:10:26.918
He merely wanted my assistance
collecting the sacred sword,

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.712
and any shards of
Yesod we came across.

00:10:29.754 --> 00:10:32.507
The only reason I came for that
damn sword in the first place

00:10:32.549 --> 00:10:35.718
was to cover for Gabriel's
unforgivable blunder.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.054
That said, though
I have sword's location,

00:10:38.096 --> 00:10:41.349
I didn't have any idea that
Yesod was in shards.

00:10:41.391 --> 00:10:43.977
And I certainly didn't know one
was in the form of a bebé!

00:10:44.018 --> 00:10:44.978
Forgive me.

00:10:45.019 --> 00:10:46.062
[KISAKI]
You two!

00:10:46.104 --> 00:10:48.606
Why are you hanging out here,
when you could go home?

00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:49.774
Uh...?

00:10:49.816 --> 00:10:51.401
The apple of my eye!

00:10:51.442 --> 00:10:53.653
I'll give you exactly
ten seconds to explain

00:10:53.695 --> 00:10:56.156
why you're holding up my crew.

00:10:56.197 --> 00:10:59.909
Just a bit of company
research, nothing more!

00:10:59.951 --> 00:11:02.829
You're banned from
our store until further notice!

00:11:08.042 --> 00:11:10.628
You think he still knows
where the sword is?

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:12.380
Huh. I guess it's possible,

00:11:12.422 --> 00:11:14.883
but that's for Emi to worry
about, and not me.

00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:16.092
Oh, really?

00:11:16.134 --> 00:11:19.262
The sword's connected to
Alas Ramus now, remember?

00:11:19.304 --> 00:11:22.223
You're right. But I'm confident
Emi could handle that.

00:11:22.265 --> 00:11:24.392
She's, like,
way stronger than me here.

00:11:24.434 --> 00:11:27.145
As the kid's dad, I think you
should be more concerned.

00:11:27.187 --> 00:11:30.315
Gimme a break,
whose side are you on?

00:11:30.356 --> 00:11:31.357
Nobody's!

00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:33.610
I'm only on the
team of getting along.

00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:36.321
And us all being
close friends forever.

00:11:36.362 --> 00:11:38.615
One time, you told me
that you trust me

00:11:38.656 --> 00:11:41.159
and feel like you can
really rely on me.

00:11:41.201 --> 00:11:44.078
But I've been thinking,
and I'm not worthy of that yet.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.872
Huh? Why not?

00:11:45.914 --> 00:11:49.959
[CHIHO] I'm no great fighter
like Miss Yusa or Miss Suzuno.

00:11:50.001 --> 00:11:51.920
And I haven't been
by your side all your life

00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:54.047
like Mister Ashiya has.

00:11:54.088 --> 00:11:57.634
So now, it's my mission to learn
some stuff that could help you!

00:11:57.675 --> 00:11:59.594
So if you're going
to put so much faith in me

00:11:59.636 --> 00:12:01.095
to be there for you,

00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:05.308
I'll do whatever it takes to
support you the best that I can!

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:06.517
Thank you.

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:10.188
And I still haven't gotten an
answer about our relationship.

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:11.898
Depending on how that turns out,

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.734
I might have a duel with
Miss Yusa over you someday!

00:12:14.776 --> 00:12:16.653
[sputters]
Huh?

00:12:16.694 --> 00:12:21.115
[CHIHO giggles]
That was totally a joke! Kinda.

00:12:21.157 --> 00:12:24.244
I'm gonna focus on a weapon
that's uniquely my own.

00:12:24.285 --> 00:12:26.579
I wanna be a resource
to my pal Mister Maou,

00:12:26.621 --> 00:12:29.249
but also the Demon King Satan.

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:30.750
That's, uh...

00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:32.585
Huh? Mister Ashiya!

00:12:32.627 --> 00:12:34.170
Huh?

00:12:34.212 --> 00:12:36.506
Hello, Sire. Sasaki.

00:12:36.547 --> 00:12:38.424
I hope MgRonald's was pleasant.

00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:40.969
Nice suitcase;
did you buy that for the trip?

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:44.389
Indeed, I have also purchased
some beach attire and sandals.

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:45.556
The suitcase was pricey,

00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:47.684
but I thought of it as
an early investment.

00:12:47.725 --> 00:12:49.435
I wouldn't be surprised
if our journey

00:12:49.477 --> 00:12:52.397
to restore our magic takes us
overseas in the future.

00:12:52.438 --> 00:12:54.399
We'll be ready
when the time comes.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.151
[CHIHO] Maybe there's a tax
write off for world conquest.

00:12:57.193 --> 00:12:59.028
There certainly should be.

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:01.698
Speaking of, you guys
trying to take over the world,

00:13:01.739 --> 00:13:05.076
what will the rest of our
friends do while you're away?

00:13:05.118 --> 00:13:07.537
[ASHIYA] Neither Emilia nor
Suzuno has mentioned it.

00:13:07.578 --> 00:13:09.664
I assumed they'd follow us,
but perhaps not.

00:13:09.706 --> 00:13:10.665
For whatever reason,

00:13:10.707 --> 00:13:13.626
they're being weirdly cool
about this whole thing.

00:13:15.169 --> 00:13:17.046
I liked that Emi girl, also.

00:13:17.088 --> 00:13:19.674
If you went with her and
promised me you'd be safe,

00:13:19.716 --> 00:13:22.677
I think I could be
convinced pretty easily.

00:13:27.348 --> 00:13:30.143
Hi, sweetie. Need something?

00:13:30.184 --> 00:13:32.562
Quick question.

00:13:32.603 --> 00:13:36.107
Can I please go to Choshi with
Miss Yusa and Miss Suzuno?

00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:47.243
Oh, cool!
An old-fashioned train!

00:13:47.285 --> 00:13:48.911
[ALAS RAMUS]
Choo-choo!

00:13:48.953 --> 00:13:50.788
It's just a box on wheels.

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:53.374
The pioneers used
to ride these babies for miles.

00:13:53.416 --> 00:13:55.126
You wouldn't get the nostalgia.

00:13:55.168 --> 00:13:57.587
We've been here as long as you.

00:14:00.798 --> 00:14:02.759
Are you gonna stay here
for two weeks?

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.136
Don't you have a
fancy job to go to?

00:14:05.178 --> 00:14:07.472
We're taking a girl's trip
for a few days.

00:14:07.513 --> 00:14:08.473
Chiho thought it'd be fun

00:14:08.514 --> 00:14:10.892
to check out the
Choshi Electric Railroad.

00:14:10.933 --> 00:14:14.562
Conveniently, I asked for time
off, 'cause Bel was moving in.

00:14:14.604 --> 00:14:17.315
So, Chi. Was your
mom cool with this?

00:14:17.357 --> 00:14:19.692
Yeah! I have her
full permission!

00:14:19.734 --> 00:14:21.819
We're allowed to spend
three days and two nights

00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:23.321
at an inn of her choosing.

00:14:23.363 --> 00:14:25.990
She only asks that
we call her regularly.

00:14:26.032 --> 00:14:26.991
Simple.

00:14:27.033 --> 00:14:28.493
[EMI]
Hear that, King Narcissist?

00:14:28.534 --> 00:14:31.454
Our little vacation has
nothing to do with you.

00:14:36.334 --> 00:14:39.796
Uh, hello, this is Maou.
We just arrived.

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:46.302
[CHIHO]
Ooo, <i>Nure-senbei</i>!

00:14:46.344 --> 00:14:49.055
Mama? What is Chi-mi getting?

00:14:49.097 --> 00:14:51.682
Special crackers!
You'd like 'em; they're smooshy!

00:14:51.724 --> 00:14:54.352
Smooshy! [giggles]

00:14:54.394 --> 00:14:57.438
Hey, Chi-mi?
Can I share smooshy?

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.857
Of course, what do you
say we split this batch?

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:02.527
Split sounds good!

00:15:02.568 --> 00:15:03.736
[WORKER]
Hope you enjoy.

00:15:03.778 --> 00:15:05.196
[EMI]
We will!

00:15:08.533 --> 00:15:09.367
Real quick.

00:15:09.409 --> 00:15:12.120
Thanks for coming along;
sorry if I dragged you here.

00:15:12.161 --> 00:15:14.372
You didn't, it was like,
the perfect offer.

00:15:14.414 --> 00:15:16.082
Still, though, I'm curious.

00:15:16.124 --> 00:15:17.792
The reason you wanted
to take this trip

00:15:17.834 --> 00:15:20.711
has to be bigger than just
being worried about Maou.

00:15:20.753 --> 00:15:22.296
We talked with Sariel.

00:15:22.338 --> 00:15:23.881
He mentioned that meanie Gabriel

00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:27.176
is still trying to take
Alas Ramus away.

00:15:27.218 --> 00:15:30.221
And Sariel knows
where the sacred sword is.

00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:32.348
I figured Alas Ramus
would be the safest

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:34.559
if we were all together
in one place.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.728
I promise, I'm not asking you
to forgive him and be best buds.

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:38.646
It's just--

00:15:38.688 --> 00:15:41.774
Satan and Emilia will
eventually settle their grudge.

00:15:41.816 --> 00:15:43.776
But to get to a place
where that's possible,

00:15:43.818 --> 00:15:45.862
we must focus on
our mutual enemies.

00:15:45.903 --> 00:15:47.780
The immediate threats.

00:15:47.822 --> 00:15:51.117
I'm still sorry for being
so presumptuous.

00:15:55.329 --> 00:15:57.290
Huh? So you're not mad?

00:15:57.331 --> 00:15:58.541
You rock, Chiho.

00:15:58.583 --> 00:16:01.377
It's no wonder your
mother trusts you so much.

00:16:05.548 --> 00:16:07.216
[AMANE]
Are you Maou?

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:11.554
[MAOU]
Yes! You're Miss Ohguro?

00:16:11.596 --> 00:16:12.555
That's me!

00:16:12.597 --> 00:16:15.224
Though I'm best known as the
owner of Ohguro's Beach Hut.

00:16:15.266 --> 00:16:18.060
Amane Ohguro, here!
Call me Amane.

00:16:18.102 --> 00:16:21.481
It's nice to meet you.
You're really saving our asses.

00:16:21.522 --> 00:16:24.484
This is more than the three
people you told me about.

00:16:24.525 --> 00:16:27.236
Sorry for the confusion,
it'll just be us fellas.

00:16:27.278 --> 00:16:30.072
The ladies decided
to follow us here.

00:16:30.114 --> 00:16:31.324
[AMANE]
Oh, gotcha.

00:16:31.365 --> 00:16:34.619
So we've got your wife, your
daughter, and some gal pals?

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:35.953
You can't help but be curious

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:37.872
about your hubby's
workplace, eh?

00:16:37.914 --> 00:16:39.874
Ugh, I'm not his wife!

00:16:42.627 --> 00:16:45.463
Like Chesed!
So blue, so blue!

00:16:45.505 --> 00:16:47.215
[AMANE]
Welcome to Kimigahama Beach.

00:16:47.256 --> 00:16:50.593
Up on the cape is the
Inubosaki Lighthouse.

00:16:50.635 --> 00:16:51.969
You can't quite
see it from here,

00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:54.805
but Ohguro's Beach Hut
is dead ahead.

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:58.226
It's less populous
than I predicted.

00:16:58.267 --> 00:17:01.145
That's because Beach Season
doesn't start till tomorrow.

00:17:01.187 --> 00:17:03.356
Tomorrow? That's quick!

00:17:03.397 --> 00:17:05.483
[AMANE] You'll only see
surfers out here right now.

00:17:05.525 --> 00:17:08.110
Oh, and maybe some people
catching the sunrise.

00:17:08.152 --> 00:17:10.488
Fun fact, this is
the first place in Kanto

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:11.989
you can see it from.

00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:15.284
Let's go ahead and
get you boys moved in.

00:17:15.326 --> 00:17:17.662
C'mon, I'll show you
where you'll be staying.

00:17:20.581 --> 00:17:23.251
[AMANE]
Cottage, sweet cottage.

00:17:23.292 --> 00:17:25.920
Can't stop the humidity
from wrinkling the tatami.

00:17:25.962 --> 00:17:29.632
I tried, so cut me some slack.

00:17:29.674 --> 00:17:32.385
Whoa. I wanna be a
shut-in here now.

00:17:32.426 --> 00:17:34.971
It makes me happy
you like it so much.

00:17:35.012 --> 00:17:36.389
I know you just got here,

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:38.641
but unload your stuff
and meet me out front.

00:17:38.683 --> 00:17:40.601
We've got work to do.

00:17:48.985 --> 00:17:50.945
It's dirty.

00:17:50.987 --> 00:17:53.197
You said the beach
opens tomorrow?

00:17:53.239 --> 00:17:56.701
Yeah, I'll keep it real.
We're in trouble.

00:17:56.742 --> 00:17:58.411
For someone
who's totally screwed,

00:17:58.452 --> 00:18:00.496
she sure does smile a lot.

00:18:00.538 --> 00:18:01.747
[MAOU]
Hmm...

00:18:01.789 --> 00:18:04.750
It's in bad shape,
but she's paying us a crap ton.

00:18:04.792 --> 00:18:07.253
She must get a good
amount of customers.

00:18:07.295 --> 00:18:08.838
That means...

00:18:09.714 --> 00:18:10.798
Amane?

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:13.217
If we're able to fill
this place to capacity,

00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:14.802
could we maybe get a bonus?

00:18:14.844 --> 00:18:15.886
[ALL]
Huh?

00:18:15.928 --> 00:18:19.098
That'd be tough,
but sure, I'd give you a bonus.

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:20.558
Seems fair.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.351
[MAOU]
You hear that, gentlemen?

00:18:22.393 --> 00:18:25.062
We're getting
the full-house bonus!

00:18:26.439 --> 00:18:28.608
[MAOU] Ashiya. You start
by cleaning the floors

00:18:28.649 --> 00:18:30.484
and make sure they're sandless!

00:18:30.526 --> 00:18:33.362
Uh. Yes, Your Majesty!

00:18:33.404 --> 00:18:35.865
[EMI] Have you got
anything for us to do?

00:18:35.906 --> 00:18:38.117
Huh? You wanna help?

00:18:38.159 --> 00:18:40.244
I'm not heartless enough
to abandon someone

00:18:40.286 --> 00:18:41.495
in this big a mess.

00:18:41.537 --> 00:18:45.499
But you're gonna owe me
for ruining our girls' trip,

00:18:45.541 --> 00:18:47.960
If you help us out,
I'll pay you!

00:18:48.753 --> 00:18:51.881
[MAOU] Buy this stuff,
but don't spend over 5,000 yen.

00:18:51.922 --> 00:18:53.466
Be sure to keep the receipts.

00:18:53.507 --> 00:18:56.135
I know how it works.
The name's Ohguro's.

00:18:56.177 --> 00:18:57.845
Expense type, supplies,...

00:18:57.887 --> 00:18:59.764
Glory!
What a magnificent sight!

00:18:59.805 --> 00:19:03.726
The hero bending
under my Sire's iron fist!

00:19:03.768 --> 00:19:05.603
Where is Mama going?

00:19:05.645 --> 00:19:07.647
Your parents
have to work, child.

00:19:07.688 --> 00:19:10.650
Perhaps the sand
can occupy your mind.

00:19:10.691 --> 00:19:13.277
Hey, I've got a job for you.

00:19:14.695 --> 00:19:17.365
Start by wiping off the dirt.

00:19:19.408 --> 00:19:21.243
[MAOU]
Then apply a bit of this.

00:19:22.328 --> 00:19:25.539
Whoa. It made the
metal look brand new again!

00:19:25.581 --> 00:19:28.751
That's right! Think you can
shine this back to life for me?

00:19:28.793 --> 00:19:30.628
I'll try my best!

00:19:32.713 --> 00:19:34.256
[MAOU]
You're up, Urushihara.

00:19:34.298 --> 00:19:35.925
Cracking the whip on me?

00:19:35.966 --> 00:19:37.635
[MAOU chuckles]

00:19:37.677 --> 00:19:38.886
I need you to find scissors

00:19:38.928 --> 00:19:41.222
and get to work cutting
the foam off these seats.

00:19:41.263 --> 00:19:44.225
People would rather sit
on wood than this nasty stuff.

00:19:44.266 --> 00:19:47.144
Maximum seats for
maximum butts, you feel me?

00:19:47.186 --> 00:19:50.314
Ugh. This better be easy.

00:19:51.732 --> 00:19:54.193
Sick skills, dude.
Have you run a shop before?

00:19:54.235 --> 00:19:58.197
Oh, no. Not exactly-- Uh?

00:19:58.239 --> 00:20:01.409
Hey, Dada! Look at Suzumi!

00:20:06.747 --> 00:20:11.919
Oh. Hello there. It would seem
I got a touch carried away.

00:20:11.961 --> 00:20:15.256
Wait. Will you make one
of those next to the shop?

00:20:15.297 --> 00:20:16.632
Huh?

00:20:34.024 --> 00:20:35.609
Wanna see something?

00:20:35.651 --> 00:20:37.278
Just hold this!

00:20:40.781 --> 00:20:43.117
Whoa!

00:20:46.996 --> 00:20:49.081
Birdie says tweet, tweet, tweet!

00:20:49.123 --> 00:20:50.291
Huh?

00:20:52.251 --> 00:20:54.336
Look! Big, shiny lights.

00:20:54.378 --> 00:20:58.716
That's weird. Maybe those are
fishing boats coming to shore?

00:20:58.758 --> 00:21:03.220
Creepy. Back in Ente Isla,
fires on the sea are a bad omen.

00:21:03.262 --> 00:21:06.849
Here in Choshi, we have a
legend about Mouren Yassa.

00:21:06.891 --> 00:21:08.476
"Mouren Yassa"?

00:21:08.517 --> 00:21:10.686
The ghosts of those
who have died at sea.

00:21:10.728 --> 00:21:13.856
They appear on fishing boats
and try to sink other ships.

00:21:13.898 --> 00:21:16.025
Making more
ghost friends, they say.

00:21:16.066 --> 00:21:19.153
Supposedly, those lights
appear when they're nearby.

00:21:20.196 --> 00:21:21.447
I don't get that trope.

00:21:21.489 --> 00:21:23.741
Why would the souls of the
dead wanna come back here

00:21:23.783 --> 00:21:26.160
and wreak havoc
on their old world?

00:21:26.202 --> 00:21:27.286
What do you mean?

00:21:27.328 --> 00:21:29.121
Oops, didn't mean to get spooky.

00:21:29.163 --> 00:21:33.167
Well, I guess what
I'm trying to say is...

00:21:33.209 --> 00:21:37.171
...don't let that kid of yours
grow up being afraid of ghosts.

00:21:37.213 --> 00:21:38.130
Huh?

00:21:38.172 --> 00:21:43.010
[distant siren blaring]

00:21:43.052 --> 00:21:45.930
Mama's right here.
Don't you worry.

00:21:45.971 --> 00:21:48.891
[cries]

00:21:48.933 --> 00:21:50.726
That's the foghorn
from the lighthouse.

00:21:50.768 --> 00:21:53.437
It isn't signaling
anything too scary.

00:21:53.479 --> 00:21:54.438
Just fog?

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:55.981
Yeah, they put out those signals

00:21:56.023 --> 00:21:58.359
so boats can stay
safe on soupy nights.

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:01.695
It means the fog must be
starting to form on the water.

00:22:01.737 --> 00:22:02.863
Weird.

00:22:02.905 --> 00:22:06.075
But it was so clear out
just a little while ago.

00:22:08.828 --> 00:22:10.496
[AMANE]
Not anymore.
