00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:03.465
[CHIHO]
[screams] Welcome to MgRonald's!

00:00:03.549 --> 00:00:06.972
[scared]

00:00:07.974 --> 00:00:10.479
[MAOU]
Hey, Chi. Have a sec?

00:00:11.314 --> 00:00:14.487
I'm sorry.
I was loud again, wasn't I?

00:00:14.571 --> 00:00:17.619
Both you and the patrons deserve
peace and normalcy.

00:00:17.702 --> 00:00:19.205
Bring that battlefield junk
in here,

00:00:19.288 --> 00:00:21.376
and you won't get promoted
to the second floor.

00:00:21.459 --> 00:00:23.004
Guess you're right about that.

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:25.843
But even
without my new volume prob,

00:00:25.927 --> 00:00:28.348
I'm not getting up there
anytime soon.

00:00:28.431 --> 00:00:30.394
Yeah, I can understand
that feeling.

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:32.022
[CHIHO]
I don't get it.

00:00:32.106 --> 00:00:34.903
How does her coffee come out
so super yummy?

00:00:35.487 --> 00:00:36.949
[MAOU]
Beats me.

00:00:37.032 --> 00:00:40.080
She uses the exact
same pot and beans that we do.

00:00:40.748 --> 00:00:44.005
-I wonder what her secret is.
-Me too.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:46.885
Hey, there!

00:00:47.804 --> 00:00:49.181
Welcome in!

00:02:24.163 --> 00:02:26.042
[MAOU]
Bye! Be safe getting home.

00:02:26.125 --> 00:02:28.964
Yes, sir!
Have a very lovely night!

00:02:29.173 --> 00:02:30.342
If you run into trouble,

00:02:30.425 --> 00:02:32.429
use that big voice
to scream my name.

00:02:34.518 --> 00:02:35.435
[gasps]

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.899
Hush. It's not nice to tease me,
you know!

00:02:37.982 --> 00:02:39.569
[MAOU]
Just be careful out there.

00:02:39.653 --> 00:02:41.949
-Oh, also...
-Great, what now?

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:44.955
You're working hard. Thank you.

00:02:46.542 --> 00:02:48.546
I realized
I hadn't said that yet.

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.967
But I... I'm doing it
for lots of logical reasons,

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.261
not just for you!

00:02:56.143 --> 00:02:58.481
[KISAKI] Was Chi's volume
any better today?

00:02:58.566 --> 00:02:59.483
For sure.

00:02:59.568 --> 00:03:01.572
There were a couple times
that she cut it close,

00:03:01.655 --> 00:03:03.784
but she's trying her hardest
to rein it in.

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:05.495
I see.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.291
I wonder if Chi's found
a new goal

00:03:07.374 --> 00:03:09.044
that she's working toward too.

00:03:09.128 --> 00:03:12.552
Wait a sec. "Too?"
You got some big scheme?

00:03:14.263 --> 00:03:17.060
Don't worry about it.
It's nothing.

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:19.064
[gasps]

00:03:19.148 --> 00:03:21.152
Oh, yeah!
Speaking of our goals and stuff,

00:03:21.235 --> 00:03:24.074
I've been meaning to ask you
how your coffee is so awesome!

00:03:24.158 --> 00:03:25.285
[confused]

00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:30.796
[MAOU]
"MgRonald's Barista Training"?

00:03:31.088 --> 00:03:32.800
[KISAKI] Do you know
what "barista" means?

00:03:35.388 --> 00:03:37.309
[MAOU]
[screams] Fire the ballista!

00:03:39.188 --> 00:03:41.568
No, ma'am!
That sure sounds cool, though!

00:03:41.902 --> 00:03:44.281
"Barista" is an Italian word.

00:03:44.365 --> 00:03:46.578
Most people think it's someone
who makes coffee.

00:03:46.912 --> 00:03:47.789
But really,

00:03:47.872 --> 00:03:50.795
baristas make all types
of nonalcoholic beverages.

00:03:50.878 --> 00:03:54.093
-One of which is coffee.
-[MAOU] Huh, sweet gig.

00:03:54.426 --> 00:03:56.890
[KISAKI] Some baristas handle
a lot more than the drinks.

00:03:56.973 --> 00:03:58.393
They're experts on everything,

00:03:58.476 --> 00:04:00.397
from the equipment
to the customers.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.150
They call themselves "barmen."

00:04:03.027 --> 00:04:05.616
That's my dream,
I want to join their ranks.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:06.952
[gasps]

00:04:07.035 --> 00:04:09.666
I swear, you're gonna rule
the whole world someday!

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:11.168
Like MgR's royalty!

00:04:11.962 --> 00:04:15.636
Well, thank you, but MgR's?

00:04:17.222 --> 00:04:18.182
Rewind.

00:04:18.266 --> 00:04:20.145
If you want
to make coffee like mine,

00:04:20.228 --> 00:04:22.399
then, you should really sign up
for this course.

00:04:22.817 --> 00:04:24.779
Since you've worked
as a shift manager,

00:04:24.863 --> 00:04:27.409
you don't even have to worry
about paying the fee.

00:04:28.161 --> 00:04:29.246
Got it.

00:04:30.498 --> 00:04:32.419
[Ashiya hums]

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:34.256
[door opens]

00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:36.427
Welcome back home, your Majesty.

00:04:36.511 --> 00:04:38.974
Next-door. Why is Suz still up?

00:04:39.057 --> 00:04:40.853
[ASHIYA]
Miss Sasaki is visiting.

00:04:41.312 --> 00:04:42.690
I'm sure
they're nearing the peak

00:04:42.774 --> 00:04:45.195
of celestial force fun time
by now.

00:04:45.278 --> 00:04:47.617
She's working her past midnight?

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:48.827
Wow.

00:04:48.911 --> 00:04:52.084
[door knocks]
[MAOU] Hey, Chi? You in there?

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:54.672
I think it's time for you
to head home.

00:04:55.423 --> 00:04:58.054
Silence, Satan.
You're not her keeper.

00:04:58.137 --> 00:05:00.768
I have good Chiho's
true guardian's blessing.

00:05:00.851 --> 00:05:02.772
Her mother says
she can stay here tonight.

00:05:02.855 --> 00:05:05.318
Oh, funny. Has she now?

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.078
Yes, indeedy! [giggles]
Should've told ya.

00:05:10.161 --> 00:05:14.086
Nah, I just wanted to say,
don't push yourself too hard.

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:15.129
Yes, sir!

00:05:15.213 --> 00:05:17.384
It's rather droll
that the demonic warlord

00:05:17.467 --> 00:05:19.722
believes himself
more compassionate than me.

00:05:19.806 --> 00:05:21.643
We have finished training
for the night.

00:05:21.726 --> 00:05:25.108
Before you so rudely barged in,
we were enjoying the girl talk.

00:05:25.651 --> 00:05:27.320
Now, I bid you goodnight.

00:05:29.534 --> 00:05:31.872
[MAOU]
"Girl talk," my left ass cheek.

00:05:31.955 --> 00:05:32.915
[exhales]

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:34.459
Normalcy is a lie, huh?

00:05:34.544 --> 00:05:36.338
As soon as it's normal,
it's gone.

00:05:36.631 --> 00:05:37.717
Emo time?

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:38.844
Hm?

00:05:39.428 --> 00:05:41.140
Nah. I was just thinking

00:05:41.223 --> 00:05:43.604
about how everything's
always changing.

00:05:43.896 --> 00:05:47.110
I guess "normal" doesn't mean
every day is identical.

00:05:47.193 --> 00:05:49.156
Just that the wicked hand
of Big Papa Time

00:05:49.239 --> 00:05:52.078
is marching along
at the same invisible rate.

00:05:52.162 --> 00:05:54.751
Damn. Has the man got you down?

00:05:54.834 --> 00:05:57.088
Or are you finally
losing your mind?

00:05:57.506 --> 00:05:59.426
I think change is a good thing.

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.098
Life would suck if it was always
the same old, same old.

00:06:02.182 --> 00:06:04.353
Yeah, like I need advice
from you!

00:06:04.436 --> 00:06:07.359
I'm just saying that I know
this subject more intimately

00:06:07.442 --> 00:06:09.112
than anyone else, actually.

00:06:09.196 --> 00:06:10.866
[jarring indication]

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:14.206
I see. Then, perhaps, you would
like to vary our daily routines.

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:16.126
I'll loaf and you do chores.

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:18.130
A real interesting idea,

00:06:18.214 --> 00:06:21.345
but some things are just
too set in stone to touch, so...

00:06:23.767 --> 00:06:26.021
[SUZUNO] I must admit,
I didn't expect you to develop

00:06:26.105 --> 00:06:28.527
such steady activation abilities
in a week.

00:06:28.944 --> 00:06:30.113
It might well be time for us

00:06:30.196 --> 00:06:32.702
to move on
to basic idea link training.

00:06:32.785 --> 00:06:34.121
You really think so?

00:06:34.204 --> 00:06:35.958
You certainly have the aptitude.

00:06:36.584 --> 00:06:38.505
If you had been born
in Ente Isla,

00:06:38.588 --> 00:06:41.260
you could've become
a mighty Celestialist.

00:06:41.343 --> 00:06:42.805
Oh, no way!

00:06:44.642 --> 00:06:46.145
This is like, super selfish,

00:06:46.228 --> 00:06:50.278
but I wish you all could forget
about the messy Ente Isla stuff.

00:06:51.196 --> 00:06:53.702
Then maybe, the new normal
we've found together here

00:06:53.785 --> 00:06:55.038
could go on forever.

00:06:55.121 --> 00:06:57.752
If we all tried our very best
to get along,

00:06:57.835 --> 00:06:59.547
I think it could happen.

00:07:00.799 --> 00:07:04.974
But I know
Miss Yusa's struggling.

00:07:05.809 --> 00:07:07.020
She's different.

00:07:07.103 --> 00:07:09.817
Especially in the way
she treats Mister Maou.

00:07:13.491 --> 00:07:14.827
[SUZUNO]
Your "Mister Maou"

00:07:14.911 --> 00:07:18.084
is not the father-killer
that Emilia set out to slay.

00:07:18.167 --> 00:07:19.002
[gasps]

00:07:19.086 --> 00:07:22.342
In fact, if recent information
is correct,

00:07:22.425 --> 00:07:23.762
her father is alive.

00:07:25.014 --> 00:07:26.601
Up until this point,

00:07:26.684 --> 00:07:30.274
vengeance and duty have been
the driving forces in her life.

00:07:30.609 --> 00:07:34.282
Having lost her mission,
she doesn't know how to proceed.

00:07:35.702 --> 00:07:38.374
But you've given our friend
more purpose than you know.

00:07:38.457 --> 00:07:41.338
Teaching you the arts
has somewhat occupied her mind.

00:07:42.423 --> 00:07:45.429
Emilia is in dire need
of distractions like that

00:07:45.514 --> 00:07:47.433
to turn her focus
from the Devil.

00:07:47.518 --> 00:07:50.189
It's fortunate that MgRonald's
is open again.

00:07:50.273 --> 00:07:52.110
Wait, why does that matter?

00:07:52.611 --> 00:07:55.868
Sariel works at Sentucky Fried
across the street, doesn't he?

00:07:55.951 --> 00:07:58.289
That should keep Olba
and the demons well away,

00:07:58.372 --> 00:08:00.878
lessening Emilia's
Maou-related load.

00:08:00.961 --> 00:08:02.882
[panic] About that,

00:08:02.965 --> 00:08:06.138
I'm not so sure
we can rely on him right now.

00:08:06.221 --> 00:08:09.645
[EMI] We can't count on Sariel
to crack skulls anymore?

00:08:09.729 --> 00:08:12.400
[SUZUNO] Apparently not.
According to good Chiho...

00:08:12.735 --> 00:08:14.279
The apple of my eye!

00:08:14.362 --> 00:08:16.033
I'll give you exactly
ten seconds

00:08:16.116 --> 00:08:18.788
to explain why you're holding up
my crew.

00:08:18.872 --> 00:08:20.416
[grunts]

00:08:20.499 --> 00:08:22.880
Just a bit of company research,
nothing more!

00:08:22.963 --> 00:08:25.384
You're banned from our store
until further notice!

00:08:25.468 --> 00:08:29.017
[gasps]

00:08:29.392 --> 00:08:33.400
She says that he's been a husk
of his former self since.

00:08:33.484 --> 00:08:35.739
He's certainly taking up
less space.

00:08:35.822 --> 00:08:37.743
Maybe he went home for the day?

00:08:37.826 --> 00:08:40.874
No. I can very faintly sense
his presence.

00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.420
Perhaps he's taken shelter
beneath the furniture.

00:08:43.505 --> 00:08:46.343
Come on, he's a grown man,
not a cockroach.

00:08:46.678 --> 00:08:49.349
But if his power levels
are feeling remotely bug-like,

00:08:49.432 --> 00:08:50.351
that's bad news.

00:08:50.434 --> 00:08:52.146
I guess Chiho was for real.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.775
Have a good night, sir.

00:08:53.858 --> 00:08:55.278
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:08:57.407 --> 00:08:58.284
[groans]

00:08:58.367 --> 00:08:59.452
[both gasp]

00:09:00.079 --> 00:09:02.793
The chubby cherub has lost
his chubby!

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.423
My beloved!

00:09:08.262 --> 00:09:10.057
He's deflated.

00:09:10.976 --> 00:09:12.312
What do we do?

00:09:15.652 --> 00:09:17.071
[bird caws]

00:09:17.155 --> 00:09:18.742
[groans]

00:09:23.543 --> 00:09:25.338
[bird caws]

00:09:25.421 --> 00:09:27.968
It's less Chateau
and more shithole.

00:09:30.682 --> 00:09:31.851
Check it out.

00:09:31.934 --> 00:09:34.064
Isn't that Maou
and Chiho's manager?

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:36.485
-[jarring indication]
-[sniffs]

00:09:36.569 --> 00:09:38.740
[gasps]

00:09:38.823 --> 00:09:40.117
I know you're here!

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:43.583
[screams]

00:09:44.084 --> 00:09:46.547
Did my fair goddess
pass by you just now?

00:09:46.631 --> 00:09:48.384
Don't you play smart with me,
Crestia Bel!

00:09:48.467 --> 00:09:49.512
She was here! I know it!

00:09:49.595 --> 00:09:51.808
Attempt to regain
your composure. I beg you!

00:09:51.891 --> 00:09:53.978
The cops won't give a damn
about your heartbreak.

00:09:54.062 --> 00:09:56.400
Let her go in five seconds,
or I'm calling.

00:09:56.818 --> 00:09:58.571
My love was here.

00:09:59.406 --> 00:10:02.913
That much I can smell!
Her personal fragrance lingers.

00:10:02.996 --> 00:10:05.919
The coffee brewed by any other
could never smell as sweet!

00:10:06.504 --> 00:10:08.006
I can't do this!

00:10:10.512 --> 00:10:12.599
Why do we have to deal
with this headache?

00:10:12.683 --> 00:10:14.520
I'm real sick of putting myself
through hell

00:10:14.603 --> 00:10:16.022
to protect the Devil.

00:10:16.106 --> 00:10:17.442
[sighs]

00:10:22.368 --> 00:10:23.872
[SUZUNO]
Up until this point,

00:10:23.955 --> 00:10:27.420
vengeance and duty have been
the driving forces in her life.

00:10:27.796 --> 00:10:31.721
Having lost her mission,
she doesn't know how to proceed.

00:10:32.514 --> 00:10:34.058
[CHIHO] I wonder
what Mister Maou thinks

00:10:34.142 --> 00:10:35.269
about the whole thing.

00:10:35.352 --> 00:10:37.023
Maybe he would want to tell me.

00:10:37.106 --> 00:10:39.027
The hardest part
will be getting him alone

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:40.614
for enough time.

00:10:40.697 --> 00:10:43.452
No! I can't ask for alone time.

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:45.456
That's like a da--

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:47.043
Got something on your mind, Chi?

00:10:47.126 --> 00:10:47.961
Oh, gosh!

00:10:48.045 --> 00:10:50.466
Oops, I totally spaced out
again, didn't I?

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:52.971
Am I all that easy to read?

00:10:53.055 --> 00:10:56.061
To tell you the truth, I've been
feeling anxious lately too.

00:10:56.144 --> 00:10:59.234
It's given me a sixth sense
to see those in the same boat.

00:10:59.317 --> 00:11:01.572
You get anxious too,
Miss Kisaki?

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:04.285
I am only human, you know.

00:11:08.586 --> 00:11:11.132
For now, worry
about what's in front of you.

00:11:11.216 --> 00:11:12.301
Right here, right now,

00:11:12.385 --> 00:11:14.097
there's only one thing
for us to do.

00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:17.228
To flip those burgers
like there's no tomorrow!

00:11:17.311 --> 00:11:18.313
Agreed?

00:11:19.482 --> 00:11:21.027
Yeah! Yes, ma'am!

00:11:21.111 --> 00:11:22.446
You're so wise.

00:11:24.994 --> 00:11:26.121
One thing...

00:11:28.543 --> 00:11:29.377
Awesome.

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:30.421
So, were gonna be honing

00:11:30.505 --> 00:11:32.509
our barista skills together,
then?

00:11:32.593 --> 00:11:33.720
Uh-huh.

00:11:35.389 --> 00:11:36.224
Listen...

00:11:37.435 --> 00:11:40.525
Hello. It seems we caught you
on your way home.

00:11:42.361 --> 00:11:43.990
What'd I do this time?

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:47.496
Sounds like an admission
of guilt, if you ask me.

00:11:47.581 --> 00:11:48.625
[gasps]

00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:51.463
Big shock! Princess wants
an excuse to fight me.

00:11:51.547 --> 00:11:52.465
[grunts]

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:55.972
I need an excuse to fight you,
an excuse to see you.

00:11:56.056 --> 00:11:57.768
Why does the Hero
always have to justify

00:11:57.851 --> 00:11:58.978
dealing with the Devil?

00:11:59.062 --> 00:12:00.189
[shocked]

00:12:01.107 --> 00:12:02.611
What's gotten into you?

00:12:02.694 --> 00:12:04.740
You've been acting
all weird lately.

00:12:04.823 --> 00:12:06.242
[sobs]

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:09.248
[gasps]

00:12:09.583 --> 00:12:11.002
Are you okay?

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.931
Emilia's daddio?
Man is alive and kicking.

00:12:17.014 --> 00:12:18.851
All I did was tell her so.

00:12:18.935 --> 00:12:21.941
I'm still angry
and I won't forgive you,

00:12:22.024 --> 00:12:23.611
no matter what you do.

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:28.245
-[MAOU] I've been thinking...
-[EMI] What?

00:12:29.998 --> 00:12:33.506
Maybe the human world
isn't the one for me anymore.

00:12:34.717 --> 00:12:37.723
I've got a whole lot of demons
waiting for me back home.

00:12:37.806 --> 00:12:40.729
One little call to Camio,
and it's like I was never here.

00:12:41.312 --> 00:12:44.737
I've put off world domination
for long enough.

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:46.030
[shocked]

00:12:47.826 --> 00:12:51.249
No way.
You don't mean that, do you?

00:12:51.332 --> 00:12:53.755
This charade never made sense,
anyway.

00:12:54.506 --> 00:12:57.428
I led hundreds of tribes
back in the demon realm.

00:12:57.512 --> 00:13:00.935
More than five-hundred thousand
soldiers hung on my every word.

00:13:01.019 --> 00:13:03.566
What could I possibly have
to learn from this place?

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:08.283
We all know what that would mean
for you, Miss Hero.

00:13:08.366 --> 00:13:10.204
If I were to bring back
the violence,

00:13:10.287 --> 00:13:12.124
I can guess where you would be.

00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:15.130
Right back at my throat,
just like in the good old days.

00:13:16.216 --> 00:13:18.136
Wait til I tell Ashiya.

00:13:19.138 --> 00:13:22.687
I hope he'll let me terrorize
Japan before we bounce.

00:13:22.771 --> 00:13:24.650
[EMI]
That's hilarious.

00:13:25.902 --> 00:13:30.077
Even if you did have it in you,
I know that you never could!

00:13:31.162 --> 00:13:34.920
Cool it with the yelling.
You'll freak out Miss Kisaki.

00:13:35.003 --> 00:13:37.424
Just tell me
what it is you want, Maou!

00:13:37.509 --> 00:13:39.137
[MAOU] I thought
I made that clear,

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:40.557
to dominate the world.

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.061
And after you do,
what comes next?

00:13:44.648 --> 00:13:47.194
You'll rule a land
that holds no appeal for demons

00:13:47.278 --> 00:13:50.033
other than a captured population
of humans to hunt.

00:13:50.117 --> 00:13:51.579
What comes after that?

00:13:53.331 --> 00:13:54.793
Well, the next logical step

00:13:54.877 --> 00:13:56.797
is to plunge the world
into despair.

00:13:56.881 --> 00:14:00.053
It is painfully obvious to me
and everyone here

00:14:00.137 --> 00:14:01.807
that you would never do
such a thing.

00:14:02.308 --> 00:14:03.644
And it hurts!

00:14:03.978 --> 00:14:05.480
If you were really this cruel,

00:14:05.565 --> 00:14:07.443
bloodthirsty demon
you pretend to be,

00:14:07.527 --> 00:14:08.571
then I would...

00:14:08.821 --> 00:14:11.284
I would still know what
the hell I'm supposed to do!

00:14:11.577 --> 00:14:12.829
Miss Yusa?

00:14:13.581 --> 00:14:16.545
I don't believe you've ever
wanted to conquer anything!

00:14:16.629 --> 00:14:18.048
It's all overkill.

00:14:18.465 --> 00:14:20.260
Murder so that you can matter?

00:14:20.344 --> 00:14:23.308
Murder so there's a chance that
someone out there respects you?

00:14:23.391 --> 00:14:25.312
[jarring indication]

00:14:27.901 --> 00:14:28.736
[grunts]

00:14:30.405 --> 00:14:32.827
[gasps]
Where did Mister Maou go?

00:14:32.911 --> 00:14:34.831
[shocked]

00:14:36.376 --> 00:14:39.423
Well, you might've just saved me
from saying something

00:14:39.508 --> 00:14:41.302
I wouldn't be able to take back.

00:14:41.595 --> 00:14:42.514
But I'm pissed that

00:14:42.597 --> 00:14:45.477
it cost me the sickest clapback
of the century.

00:14:46.145 --> 00:14:48.985
So, who are you two
supposed to be?

00:14:49.402 --> 00:14:53.284
State your name, say your piece,
and scram once you're satisfied.

00:14:53.368 --> 00:14:54.579
Or else...

00:14:55.414 --> 00:14:58.336
I'm already P-Oed.
Don't test me.

00:14:58.629 --> 00:15:00.090
King Satan.

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:05.308
My name is Farfarello, I am
a leader of the Malebranche,

00:15:05.392 --> 00:15:08.106
and come to you today
to speak on their behalf.

00:15:08.189 --> 00:15:10.360
[MAOU]
I figured you were a demon.

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:14.619
How about you, micro-samurai?
You a demon too?

00:15:15.538 --> 00:15:18.084
[ERONE]
Erone. Human.

00:15:18.168 --> 00:15:20.380
[MAOU] Why are you hanging
around this guy?

00:15:20.464 --> 00:15:21.633
[ERONE]
Orders.

00:15:21.717 --> 00:15:24.639
Uh-huh. Right.
And what do you want with me?

00:15:25.474 --> 00:15:27.311
I bring exciting news.

00:15:27.394 --> 00:15:29.231
We've captured
their strongpoint.

00:15:29.315 --> 00:15:31.904
The Malebranche now rule
the Eastern continent.

00:15:31.987 --> 00:15:33.239
Therefore, we humbly ask you

00:15:33.323 --> 00:15:34.785
to return and join us
in taking hold of--

00:15:34.868 --> 00:15:36.412
Nah! I'm good!

00:15:36.914 --> 00:15:37.916
[shocked]

00:15:37.999 --> 00:15:40.003
Huh? Don't you "Huh" me.

00:15:40.087 --> 00:15:42.926
-Get lost!
-But why, your Majesty?

00:15:44.136 --> 00:15:45.430
No service.

00:15:45.515 --> 00:15:47.309
[CHIHO]
Where did he go?

00:15:47.392 --> 00:15:49.188
[SUZUNO]
Could this be the work of...

00:15:49.689 --> 00:15:50.942
[EMI]
A demon.

00:15:56.035 --> 00:15:57.956
-[shocked]
-A barrier.

00:15:58.039 --> 00:16:00.210
[SARUE]
My sweet goddess!

00:16:00.795 --> 00:16:03.676
-I have come to save you!
-Light of Iron!

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:05.513
[grunts]

00:16:07.099 --> 00:16:08.184
[thud]

00:16:09.353 --> 00:16:11.190
What've you done with my love?

00:16:11.608 --> 00:16:14.363
Nothing in the slightest.
She's not here.

00:16:14.698 --> 00:16:16.702
Hold on. Where's Chiho?

00:16:17.202 --> 00:16:19.206
I didn't see her leave.

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:22.004
Why would an ordinary barrier
make someone disappear?

00:16:22.087 --> 00:16:24.551
[SARUE] That's no
ordinary barrier. It's...

00:16:25.553 --> 00:16:27.724
...a dimensional phase shifter.

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:34.195
[MAOU] I already told Ciriatto
I have no desire to come back.

00:16:34.613 --> 00:16:37.242
Besides, do you really take me
for the type of pantywaist

00:16:37.326 --> 00:16:39.998
that would wrestle it out
in another man's fundoshi?

00:16:40.332 --> 00:16:42.629
[FARFARELLO]
"Another man's fundoshi"?

00:16:42.712 --> 00:16:44.215
[grunts]

00:16:44.298 --> 00:16:46.803
[MAOU] A fundoshi is a type
of Japanese underwear!

00:16:46.887 --> 00:16:49.726
If you're gonna come barging
over here, learn the culture!

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:52.397
In the traditional martial art
of sumo wrestling,

00:16:52.481 --> 00:16:54.819
you're only allowed
to wear a fundoshi!

00:16:54.903 --> 00:16:56.907
It basically functions
like armor.

00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:58.869
[FARFARELLO]
So, one wins once he's destroyed

00:16:58.953 --> 00:17:01.207
his opponents under garments?

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:02.209
[MAOU]
Son of a...

00:17:02.292 --> 00:17:03.419
It's just a phrase,

00:17:03.504 --> 00:17:05.716
nobody wrestles
with their hogs out!

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:06.885
Understood.

00:17:07.302 --> 00:17:10.893
I'm sorry to be that guy,
but sumos wear mawashi now.

00:17:11.561 --> 00:17:13.231
Oh, yeah, sounds right!

00:17:13.314 --> 00:17:16.487
Wait! So, why is it "fundoshi"
in the idiom then?

00:17:16.571 --> 00:17:19.034
Because that's what they wore
a long time ago.

00:17:19.536 --> 00:17:22.542
Hey! Why are you here?
It's not safe, Chi!

00:17:22.625 --> 00:17:25.715
You can't take Mister Maou back
to Ente Isla, you hear me?

00:17:25.798 --> 00:17:28.219
He still has a lot of stuff
to do in Japan, so--

00:17:29.138 --> 00:17:30.599
Stay behind me.

00:17:30.683 --> 00:17:31.852
[FARFARELLO]
Your Majesty,

00:17:31.935 --> 00:17:34.733
am I to believe that
what this girl says is true?

00:17:35.317 --> 00:17:38.031
And why does this "stuff"
involve protecting a human?

00:17:38.114 --> 00:17:39.618
If I didn't know better,
I would think

00:17:39.701 --> 00:17:41.872
this world has made you
lose your way.

00:17:41.955 --> 00:17:45.671
This world has convinced you
to abandon your own kind.

00:17:45.755 --> 00:17:47.341
-That ain't true!
-[gasps]

00:17:47.424 --> 00:17:49.470
I won't forget where I started!

00:17:49.554 --> 00:17:51.892
And I won't forget those
who believed in me!

00:17:51.975 --> 00:17:53.353
Not for my life!

00:17:54.396 --> 00:17:57.277
I didn't realize what
world domination would mean.

00:17:57.361 --> 00:17:59.574
I was able to turn a blind eye
for a while.

00:17:59.658 --> 00:18:02.412
But I can no longer
look past the tragedy I caused

00:18:02.496 --> 00:18:03.999
in the name of conquest!

00:18:04.083 --> 00:18:06.880
If I try to walk
that same path of ruin again,

00:18:06.963 --> 00:18:10.888
the Hero really will kill me,
and demon-kind will be doomed!

00:18:10.971 --> 00:18:12.307
But we have grown!

00:18:12.391 --> 00:18:14.395
We won't make
the same mistakes again!

00:18:14.478 --> 00:18:16.482
If we keep throwing violence
at the world,

00:18:16.566 --> 00:18:18.946
it's gonna throw violence
right back at us!

00:18:19.614 --> 00:18:21.367
I'll say it one more time.

00:18:21.785 --> 00:18:24.916
Leave the Eastern continent,
and go home.

00:18:24.999 --> 00:18:27.839
Ciriatto will help you
figure out the logistics.

00:18:27.922 --> 00:18:29.676
And Camio won't punish you.

00:18:30.719 --> 00:18:33.851
My, my! What a shame.

00:18:33.934 --> 00:18:36.940
Olba had warned me that
this country had defanged you.

00:18:37.023 --> 00:18:39.111
But I refused to believe him.

00:18:39.863 --> 00:18:42.618
Though if what he was saying
is factual.

00:18:43.035 --> 00:18:43.871
[shocked]

00:18:43.954 --> 00:18:45.958
Lemme guess,
you'll kill me here and now?

00:18:46.041 --> 00:18:48.171
Let Barabriccia
make himself king?

00:18:48.672 --> 00:18:52.053
No.
I will ask that you take this.

00:18:52.137 --> 00:18:53.097
What's that?

00:18:53.181 --> 00:18:55.770
A travel-sized bit
of condensed magic.

00:18:55.853 --> 00:18:57.439
If you were to consume it,

00:18:57.523 --> 00:18:59.611
I believe that your heart
will be restored

00:18:59.694 --> 00:19:01.615
to it's former ferocity.

00:19:02.032 --> 00:19:04.203
Interesting. Guess I'll keep it.

00:19:04.286 --> 00:19:06.875
Though I can tell you,
my feelings won't change.

00:19:06.958 --> 00:19:10.006
Keep it? Please, Sire,
you must eat it now.

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:12.135
Oh? What's with the big hurry?

00:19:12.219 --> 00:19:13.555
You'll see.

00:19:14.389 --> 00:19:15.518
[ERONE]
Breaking.

00:19:15.726 --> 00:19:16.937
[glass cracks]

00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:18.147
[crashes]

00:19:18.231 --> 00:19:20.151
Heavenly Fang of Light!

00:19:20.235 --> 00:19:21.822
[explosion]

00:19:21.905 --> 00:19:23.032
[groans]

00:19:23.115 --> 00:19:24.577
Whoa! Emi?

00:19:24.661 --> 00:19:25.996
Glad you're here!

00:19:26.413 --> 00:19:28.209
And were glad you're alright.

00:19:28.292 --> 00:19:32.133
Emilia! Bel!
Watch out for the child samurai.

00:19:32.217 --> 00:19:34.137
He's making the barrier!

00:19:34.639 --> 00:19:35.808
The second that I pick a fight,

00:19:35.891 --> 00:19:37.645
you've got the nerve
to disappear.

00:19:38.145 --> 00:19:39.566
That really pissed me off.

00:19:39.649 --> 00:19:41.653
The hell?
I didn't get a clapback in!

00:19:41.736 --> 00:19:44.909
Well, at least I could take out
a little anger on the barrier.

00:19:44.993 --> 00:19:47.790
-I feel way better now!
-[MAOU] You freak.

00:19:47.874 --> 00:19:50.879
Leave those dorks to me.
You just protect Chiho.

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:53.635
-Right.
-Who are you?

00:19:54.052 --> 00:19:55.013
Weird.

00:19:55.096 --> 00:19:58.562
You're a demon, aren't you?
You really don't recognize me?

00:19:59.187 --> 00:20:01.902
No. Impossible, you can't be!

00:20:02.528 --> 00:20:04.949
Emilia Justina,
get it right next time!

00:20:05.033 --> 00:20:06.661
If there is a next time.

00:20:10.084 --> 00:20:11.504
[groans]

00:20:15.219 --> 00:20:17.140
[groans]

00:20:17.223 --> 00:20:19.311
If you forget everything
you've seen here,

00:20:19.394 --> 00:20:21.608
I'll let you scurry on home
to the demon realm

00:20:21.691 --> 00:20:23.904
and quietly live out
the rest of your days.

00:20:23.987 --> 00:20:26.033
I can't stop you
from trying anything.

00:20:26.534 --> 00:20:28.664
Just be prepared
to lose your head.

00:20:29.081 --> 00:20:31.920
Why does she always sound
more like a villain than a Hero?

00:20:32.755 --> 00:20:34.216
Erone!

00:20:34.299 --> 00:20:35.218
[gasps]

00:20:37.556 --> 00:20:38.850
Stay back!

00:20:39.769 --> 00:20:40.688
[grunts]

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:45.698
Holy Mirror Flare!

00:20:51.083 --> 00:20:52.545
[grunts]

00:20:53.337 --> 00:20:54.674
[yells]

00:21:00.143 --> 00:21:01.521
[ALAS]
Erone?

00:21:01.604 --> 00:21:05.319
Mama! Erone! No more!

00:21:05.738 --> 00:21:08.200
No more being a meanie!

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:13.587
Please stop it!

00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:16.341
Hello?
It's no time for baby talk!

00:21:16.425 --> 00:21:18.764
Gaze of the Fall!

00:21:23.774 --> 00:21:25.026
[grunts]

00:21:25.109 --> 00:21:27.865
Erone. We withdraw.

00:21:27.948 --> 00:21:29.201
[shocked]

00:21:33.543 --> 00:21:34.712
[FARFARELLO]
Your Majesty,

00:21:34.796 --> 00:21:37.133
I shall be back
to bring you home.

00:21:37.217 --> 00:21:40.599
Says the demon being carried
by a scrawny human kid.

00:21:40.682 --> 00:21:44.022
Nice try,
but you two can't escape my--

00:21:44.106 --> 00:21:45.609
Oh, come on!

00:21:45.692 --> 00:21:46.528
[grunts]

00:21:47.111 --> 00:21:49.282
-God, you suck.
-Excuse me?

00:21:49.366 --> 00:21:51.955
But, hey,
you did technically help us.

00:21:52.038 --> 00:21:53.708
So, thanks, I guess.

00:21:54.042 --> 00:21:57.131
-Yikes, Suz. You good?
-Think so.

00:21:57.215 --> 00:22:00.722
All of my bones are intact,
but he packed a punch.

00:22:03.728 --> 00:22:05.398
[EMI]
That Erone kid.

00:22:06.568 --> 00:22:08.780
I think he might be
like Alas Ramus.

00:22:08.864 --> 00:22:10.784
[all shocked]

00:22:10.868 --> 00:22:15.334
Uh-huh! Yessod is me!
And my friend Erone is Geburah!
