00:00:05.547 --> 00:00:07.257
(humming)

00:00:09.468 --> 00:00:11.178
(both grunt)

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.556
(both grunt)

00:00:15.182 --> 00:00:17.184
(scoffs)
Good throw.

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:20.604
You could be a major league player.

00:00:20.771 --> 00:00:21.980
Major league?

00:00:22.105 --> 00:00:27.611
They used to play baseball
in a big stadium in front of a huge crowd.

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:30.989
Then I want to be a pitcher
on a baseball team.

00:00:31.073 --> 00:00:34.743
For that to happen,
we'll need to make this world peaceful.

00:00:36.203 --> 00:00:37.246
Peaceful?

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:42.584
That means no more war, Charlotte.
Maybe it's difficult for you to grasp.

00:00:43.168 --> 00:00:46.129
COLONEL: <i>The Peacebuilding Force</i>
<i>that I work for</i>

00:00:46.213 --> 00:00:48.090
<i>is trying to make this world peaceful.</i>

00:00:48.173 --> 00:00:50.592
I know. You're the best, Dad.

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:52.761
Just wait and see.

00:00:52.844 --> 00:00:57.099
We'll beat those
damn scrap iron machines soon.

00:00:57.182 --> 00:01:00.018
No cursing in front of children.

00:01:00.102 --> 00:01:02.854
(all chuckle)

00:01:04.982 --> 00:01:06.400
(squeaks)

00:01:07.985 --> 00:01:09.987
("ASEED" by ZAQ playing)

00:02:41.536 --> 00:02:44.456

00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:48.919
-(clanks)
-(Black Trike groans)

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:49.961
Uh?

00:02:52.506 --> 00:02:54.174
(beeping)

00:02:54.257 --> 00:02:59.054
BLACK TRIKE: <i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I'm not able to repair the drive system.</i>

00:03:00.138 --> 00:03:02.057
Black Trike.

00:03:02.808 --> 00:03:05.560
DEAD MASTER:
I thought Hemiteos Unit Assist Vehicles

00:03:05.644 --> 00:03:08.438
were equipped with a self-repair function.

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:11.525
BLACK TRIKE:
<i>We self-repair with materials collected</i>

00:03:11.608 --> 00:03:14.444
<i>from natural objects in the area.</i>

00:03:14.528 --> 00:03:19.491
<i>But there are many unrepairable parts.</i>
<i>Some required materials are unavailable.</i>

00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:21.034
What are we going to do?

00:03:21.118 --> 00:03:24.246
We can't continue our journey
without Black Trike.

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.124
Of course, there's no other choice
but to fix it.

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:32.963
STRENGTH: Scavenging through scrap iron...

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:34.464
(Strength grunts)

00:03:34.548 --> 00:03:37.843
This task is not worthy
of the name Hemiteos Unit.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.475
Dead Master, if we get attacked
under these conditions, we're toast.

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:47.811
COLONEL: <i>I need you to be on the lookout.</i>

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:49.354
DEAD MASTER: Leave it to me.

00:03:49.438 --> 00:03:52.441
If I see Unmanned Forces,
I'll shoot them down right away.

00:03:52.524 --> 00:03:55.902
COLONEL: <i>You must report to me</i>
<i>before you start firing. Don't forget.</i>

00:03:55.986 --> 00:03:57.279
If you say so.

00:03:57.362 --> 00:04:00.866
-(keyboard clacking)
-(Monica humming)

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:02.284

00:04:04.202 --> 00:04:05.287
(clicking)

00:04:10.584 --> 00:04:12.836
-Okay.
-(beeps)

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.339
MONICA: It looks like
the self-repair function needed

00:04:16.423 --> 00:04:18.717
more electrical power, too.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.344
I hope this works.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.764
-(clicks)
-BLACK TRIKE: <i>Whoa.</i>

00:04:24.806 --> 00:04:26.141
<i>Satisfactory.</i>

00:04:26.224 --> 00:04:30.979
<i>Monica Kaburagi,</i>
<i>you are brilliant for a private citizen.</i>

00:04:31.563 --> 00:04:34.024
Do you need to say
"for a private citizen"?

00:04:36.234 --> 00:04:37.778
(clatters)

00:04:39.488 --> 00:04:40.530
Uh...

00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:47.245
MONICA: Did you find anything
that looks useful?

00:04:47.329 --> 00:04:48.163
Uh?

00:04:49.498 --> 00:04:51.166
Let me see it.

00:04:55.462 --> 00:04:56.713
(thumps)

00:04:56.797 --> 00:04:59.090
(clatters)

00:04:59.174 --> 00:05:01.843
(gasps)
What are you doing?

00:05:01.927 --> 00:05:04.137
You could have killed me!

00:05:04.221 --> 00:05:05.222
Sorry.

00:05:11.895 --> 00:05:13.188
EMPRESS: Where's Strength?

00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:16.149
DEAD MASTER: It's her turn
to be on the lookout.

00:05:16.233 --> 00:05:18.568
-(clinking)
-(Strength yawning)

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.909
DEAD MASTER: Here you go. Open your mouth.

00:05:27.786 --> 00:05:32.916
We can relax a bit now that we've crushed
the Educational Institution.

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:36.878
Although we couldn't get
that girl called Charlotte.

00:05:42.217 --> 00:05:44.553
We'll surely be attacked again.

00:05:44.636 --> 00:05:47.305
You'll be able to talk with her.
I assure you.

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:48.390
Hmm...

00:05:50.976 --> 00:05:56.064
My daughter liked sports
and toasted marshmallows.

00:06:00.902 --> 00:06:02.904
(soft music)

00:06:23.758 --> 00:06:24.801
I'm sorry.

00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:27.053
COLONEL: What are you apologizing for?

00:06:27.721 --> 00:06:30.015
EMPRESS: I threw that ball
and ripped it up.

00:06:30.098 --> 00:06:33.226
COLONEL: I see.
You throw a blazing fastball.

00:06:33.768 --> 00:06:36.688
You should be an ace pitcher
for the New York Yankees.

00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:37.981
Yankees?

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:43.153
It's a story from long ago.
My daughter used to like baseball, too.

00:06:43.737 --> 00:06:46.239
Your daughter. Charlotte.

00:06:46.907 --> 00:06:49.326
COLONEL: I was surprised
she was even alive.

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:50.869
Let alone showing up like that.

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:54.998
Don't be afraid to feel happy
that she's alive.

00:06:56.082 --> 00:06:57.250
(gasps)

00:06:57.917 --> 00:07:01.838
Strength said there's still a chance
we can get her back.

00:07:01.921 --> 00:07:04.799
As long as there's a chance...

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:08.219
Humans are like that, right?

00:07:11.765 --> 00:07:13.266
You're right.

00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:17.187
COLONEL: Humans are like that.

00:07:19.064 --> 00:07:22.567
DEAD MASTER: <i>Colonel, can you hear me?</i>
<i>There's something coming towards us.</i>

00:07:22.651 --> 00:07:23.610
Mm?

00:07:23.693 --> 00:07:25.695
(tense music)

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:30.742
COLONEL: Giganteses.
Even worse, with highly toxic Arche.

00:07:30.825 --> 00:07:33.495
We're fine. Hemiteos Units
are immune to Arche.

00:07:33.578 --> 00:07:36.873
We couldn't battle
the Unmanned Forces if we weren't.

00:07:36.956 --> 00:07:38.833
COLONEL: But Monica and I will die.

00:07:38.917 --> 00:07:41.294
What's toxic Arche?

00:07:41.378 --> 00:07:45.006
Out-of-control nanobots
that have become toxic to the human body.

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:48.218
We can't fight Giganteses here, anyway.

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:51.763
It would be an inefficient,
pointless battle.

00:07:51.846 --> 00:07:54.391
It would be even more difficult
if they call for backup.

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:58.645
Okay, then it's decided.
Let's just keep going. Uh...

00:07:58.728 --> 00:08:01.439
We haven't repaired Black Trike yet.

00:08:01.523 --> 00:08:03.441
That will be the priority.

00:08:03.525 --> 00:08:06.695
Hurry up and fix it,
then we'll rush to the destination.

00:08:06.778 --> 00:08:08.655
About that...

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:10.240
What's the matter?

00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:12.659
We still lack the hard-to-find parts.

00:08:12.742 --> 00:08:13.702
Such as?

00:08:13.785 --> 00:08:15.245
Rare metals,

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:18.581
especially the 17 rare-earth elements.

00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:24.796
MONICA: Yttrium <i>for lasers,</i> neodymium
<i>and</i> dysprosium <i>for micro motors.</i>

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:26.548
There are some others, too.

00:08:26.631 --> 00:08:28.591
How can we get those?

00:08:28.675 --> 00:08:33.722
From the wreckage of Unmanned Forces,
but that still might not be enough.

00:08:34.139 --> 00:08:38.560
Personal computers
and LCDs would help, even old ones.

00:08:38.643 --> 00:08:40.645
Oh, here they are.

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:42.981
What? Don't leave out the subject.

00:08:43.064 --> 00:08:45.316
MONICA:
It's a Peacebuilding Force facility.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.359
A base?

00:08:46.443 --> 00:08:47.944
No, a library.

00:08:48.445 --> 00:08:52.157
Peacebuilding Force Memorial Library.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.953
How can there be machine parts
at a library?

00:08:57.037 --> 00:08:59.664
Well, it's a facility
of the Peacebuilding Force.

00:08:59.748 --> 00:09:02.208
It seems to be abandoned now,

00:09:02.292 --> 00:09:06.004
but it's highly likely that there are tons
of computers and tablets left there.

00:09:06.629 --> 00:09:11.217
It's far from refugee camps or towns,
so not likely to have been scavenged.

00:09:11.301 --> 00:09:16.347
STRENGTH: Black Trike can't move.
Somebody has to stay here.

00:09:18.433 --> 00:09:20.226
Dead Master.

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:24.898
Would you stay here and be the lookout
while protecting Black Trike?

00:09:24.981 --> 00:09:26.399
Roger.

00:09:27.358 --> 00:09:29.360
(action music)

00:09:38.328 --> 00:09:40.622
Hmm, this must be it.

00:09:40.955 --> 00:09:45.001
COLONEL: Monica. If you're putting me on,
I'm gonna bury you here.

00:09:45.085 --> 00:09:47.003
No way, I'm not making things up.

00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:50.924
MONICA: Strength.

00:09:51.007 --> 00:09:52.550
STRENGTH: Okay, if got to.

00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:56.513
MONICA: See, as I thought.

00:10:09.651 --> 00:10:10.944
There's something here.

00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:13.196
(yelps)

00:10:16.908 --> 00:10:18.243
What the...

00:10:18.827 --> 00:10:21.371
ANDY: <i>How do you do, everybody?</i>

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:25.959
<i>Welcome to the Peacebuilding Force</i>
<i>Memorial Library.</i>

00:10:26.543 --> 00:10:30.922
<i>I am Andy, the librarian android.</i>

00:10:34.801 --> 00:10:37.971
<i>The reading room is this way.</i>

00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:41.766
This robot hasn't been hacked
by the Unmanned Forces?

00:10:42.142 --> 00:10:46.229
He's a limited-function AI,
operating off-line. We're safe.

00:10:46.396 --> 00:10:48.982
Although it's junk, a very old model.

00:10:49.274 --> 00:10:51.151
Let's dismantle it for parts.

00:10:51.234 --> 00:10:52.110
(Andy shrieks)

00:10:52.193 --> 00:10:55.405
ANDY: <i>I am not junk.</i>

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:06.332
(suspenseful music)

00:11:11.963 --> 00:11:13.631
COLONEL: We can use these.

00:11:13.715 --> 00:11:15.884
Do you have a server room?

00:11:15.967 --> 00:11:18.136
ANDY: <i>It is over there at the back.</i>

00:11:18.219 --> 00:11:20.471
<i>Since we are in standby power mode,</i>

00:11:20.555 --> 00:11:24.767
<i>we are down to only 1% functional</i>
<i>of normal times.</i>

00:11:24.851 --> 00:11:27.353
<i>Would you still like me to take you there?</i>

00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:29.147
Yes, of course.

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:33.651
You check out the server room.
We'll collect parts here.

00:11:33.735 --> 00:11:35.195
Got it. Please take me there.

00:11:35.278 --> 00:11:38.948
ANDY: <i>Certainly. Follow me.</i>

00:11:39.032 --> 00:11:40.867
Okay.

00:11:48.291 --> 00:11:52.921
MONICA: As expected, the database server
doesn't seem to be working.

00:11:53.504 --> 00:11:56.341
I guess it'll be worth it
if I can collect some parts.

00:11:56.716 --> 00:12:03.056
ANDY: <i>Databases continue</i>
<i>to be securely updated inside me.</i>

00:12:03.139 --> 00:12:07.143
<i>If you need information, please inquire.</i>

00:12:07.227 --> 00:12:08.478
Hmm...

00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:12.398
So do you have
any information on the Colonel?

00:12:12.482 --> 00:12:14.692
The military man who came here with me.

00:12:14.776 --> 00:12:16.611
ANDY: <i>Why do you need that?</i>

00:12:16.694 --> 00:12:18.988
I want to get some dirt on him.

00:12:19.072 --> 00:12:22.242
ANDY: <i>That statement</i>
<i>is morally troublesome.</i>

00:12:22.325 --> 00:12:23.743
It's okay.

00:12:23.826 --> 00:12:25.995
I'm good friends with the Colonel.

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:27.914
ANDY: <i>In that case, it is okay.</i>

00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:31.584
-<i>Searching...</i>
-That was too easy.

00:12:32.627 --> 00:12:33.836
ANDY: <i>Search completed.</i>

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.798
<i>I've found info on an individual</i>
<i>who fits that description.</i>

00:12:36.881 --> 00:12:41.719
<i>But because he is on a secret mission,</i>
<i>his general military record was deleted.</i>

00:12:41.803 --> 00:12:46.266
I thought so. How about his family?

00:12:46.349 --> 00:12:49.727
ANDY: <i>The Colonel had a wife</i>
<i>and a daughter.</i>

00:12:49.811 --> 00:12:52.188
<i>They are both deceased.</i>

00:12:52.272 --> 00:12:54.607
The daughter is alive, though.

00:12:55.483 --> 00:12:56.776
What was his wife like?

00:12:56.859 --> 00:12:59.028
ANDY:
<i>The Colonel's wife Jessica graduated from</i>

00:12:59.112 --> 00:13:02.282
<i>Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</i>

00:13:02.365 --> 00:13:06.160
<i>Her major was metal-organic science</i>
<i>and nanotechnology.</i>

00:13:06.244 --> 00:13:08.788
<i>Her records after graduation are deleted.</i>

00:13:08.871 --> 00:13:12.292
Isn't she a civilian? Why was it deleted?

00:13:12.375 --> 00:13:13.751
ANDY: <i>I do not...</i>

00:13:13.835 --> 00:13:16.754
-How's it going?
-Whoa! You scared me.

00:13:16.838 --> 00:13:18.840
-(Monica yelping)
-COLONEL: Monica!

00:13:21.551 --> 00:13:22.593
(exhales deeply)

00:13:23.344 --> 00:13:26.014
(Monica groaning)

00:13:26.097 --> 00:13:29.100
It hurts.

00:13:33.104 --> 00:13:35.315
(gasps)
It's...

00:13:36.733 --> 00:13:37.984
It's an enemy!

00:13:39.152 --> 00:13:41.571
An infantry soldier unit
of the Titans drones.

00:13:43.906 --> 00:13:45.074
(whimpering)

00:13:45.158 --> 00:13:46.701
-(Colonel grunts)
-(gasps)

00:13:47.285 --> 00:13:48.494
Are you okay, Monica?

00:13:48.578 --> 00:13:49.454
MONICA: Look!

00:13:50.038 --> 00:13:52.206
COLONEL: It's a feral unit
with no signal reception.

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:55.376
(gunshots)

00:14:05.178 --> 00:14:08.181
(electricity crackling)

00:14:08.264 --> 00:14:11.893
(grunting)

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.698
(clangs)

00:14:27.909 --> 00:14:29.077
(gasps)

00:14:31.913 --> 00:14:35.958
Since it's a feral unit,
reinforcements are not likely on the way.

00:14:36.042 --> 00:14:36.918
Yeah.

00:14:38.753 --> 00:14:40.421
What's wrong?

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:44.050
ANDY: <i>Thomas. He wasn't a bad guy.</i>

00:14:44.133 --> 00:14:45.009
What?

00:14:45.134 --> 00:14:48.554
You named an infantry soldier unit
from the Unmanned Forces?

00:14:48.638 --> 00:14:52.475
MONICA: Maybe because they
are both machines they got along?

00:14:52.558 --> 00:14:57.188
He would have attacked you
if he came online. We saved your life.

00:15:07.532 --> 00:15:10.576
Now, how should we get back up?

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.870
ANDY: <i>You can get back up from here.</i>

00:15:12.954 --> 00:15:14.580
(trilling)

00:15:16.666 --> 00:15:18.626

00:15:19.669 --> 00:15:20.545
MONICA: Huh?

00:15:23.381 --> 00:15:25.049
ANDY: <i>That's my family.</i>

00:15:25.133 --> 00:15:26.801
Oh, okay.

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:35.309
ANDY: <i>They were abandoned,</i>
<i>so I gathered them together,</i>

00:15:35.393 --> 00:15:39.355
<i>and little by little, I repaired them.</i>

00:15:39.438 --> 00:15:42.984
<i>I want to form a baseball team</i>
<i>with my family.</i>

00:15:46.571 --> 00:15:48.114
I see.

Ethical tests.

00:16:55.014 --> 00:16:57.725
ANDY: <i>Should I explain it to you</i>
<i>in plain language?</i>

00:16:58.726 --> 00:16:59.727
EMPRESS: Yes.

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:04.315
ANDY: <i>In order for sophisticated AI</i>
<i>to achieve autonomous behavior,</i>

00:17:04.398 --> 00:17:07.944
<i>they were required to have</i>
<i>an appropriately high level of ethics.</i>

00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:10.363
<i>Many tests were developed for them.</i>

00:17:10.488 --> 00:17:11.322
What tests?

00:17:11.614 --> 00:17:13.783
ANDY: <i>A famous one is the trolley problem.</i>

00:17:13.866 --> 00:17:17.828
<i>There's a runaway trolley.</i>
<i>Five workers are in its path.</i>

00:17:17.912 --> 00:17:22.667
<i>You're at the lever that switches tracks.</i>
<i>If you pull the lever, they will be saved.</i>

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:26.128
<i>But if you do, there is a worker</i>
<i>on the tracks ahead.</i>

00:17:26.212 --> 00:17:29.549
<i>Given you cannot contact them,</i>

00:17:29.632 --> 00:17:32.134
<i>would you choose</i>
<i>to save five workers or one?</i>

00:17:35.221 --> 00:17:36.639
(clangs)

00:17:36.722 --> 00:17:42.144
ANDY: <i>Artemis solved this trolley problem</i>
<i>by saying it would kill one and save five,</i>

00:17:42.228 --> 00:17:48.150
<i>then take responsibility by suicide.</i>
<i>This made the humans happy.</i>

00:17:48.734 --> 00:17:52.822
<i>They thought, "This is our desired</i>
<i>artificial intelligence. It is perfect."</i>

00:17:53.864 --> 00:17:57.743
So, what is the definition of life
for an artificial object, anyway?

00:17:58.244 --> 00:17:59.495
(Andy chuckles sheepishly)

00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:00.705
ANDY: <i>That's the problem.</i>

00:18:00.788 --> 00:18:05.167
<i>Science without philosophy</i>
<i>is dangerous and unstable.</i>

00:18:05.876 --> 00:18:07.003
I finished.

00:18:07.086 --> 00:18:10.214
-COLONEL: All right, let's pull out.
-Wait a minute.

00:18:11.382 --> 00:18:12.842
There's one last thing I want to ask.

00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:13.884
ANDY: <i>Yes?</i>

00:18:13.968 --> 00:18:16.178
What is Light House Number Eight?

00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:20.349
ANDY: <i>Searching... Search completed.</i>

00:18:20.433 --> 00:18:22.518
<i>It is a facility</i>
<i>of the Peacebuilding Force.</i>

00:18:22.602 --> 00:18:27.732
<i>Its activities are marked as classified.</i>
<i>It has already been shuttered.</i>

00:18:27.815 --> 00:18:29.942
<i>There should be nothing left of it now.</i>

00:18:30.026 --> 00:18:31.485
No.

00:18:37.074 --> 00:18:38.367
Mm.

00:18:39.827 --> 00:18:42.747
(grunting)

00:18:45.333 --> 00:18:46.584
Andy!

00:18:48.544 --> 00:18:50.588

-(thumps)

00:18:57.386 --> 00:19:00.056
ANDY: <i>Is this a real ball?</i>

00:19:00.139 --> 00:19:02.558
I hope you can play baseball someday.

00:19:02.642 --> 00:19:03.768
ANDY: <i>What?</i>

00:19:05.645 --> 00:19:10.358
You shouldn't be using a steel pipe.
I'll bring you a real bat if I find one.

00:19:10.441 --> 00:19:13.110
ANDY: <i>Will you come again?</i>

00:19:13.194 --> 00:19:16.238
Once we get our business done, yeah.

00:19:18.991 --> 00:19:20.993

00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:38.678
I've eliminated possible
enemy reconnaissance drones.

00:19:39.053 --> 00:19:42.473
I stalled them but it might have been
detected by the main unit.

00:19:42.556 --> 00:19:47.478
COLONEL: Got it. Return immediately.
How are the repairs going?

00:19:48.312 --> 00:19:50.523
MONICA: What do you think, Black Trike?

00:19:50.648 --> 00:19:54.527
BLACK TRIKE:
<i>Self-repair function availability, 99.8%.</i>

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:58.114
<i>Power supply including backup, 100%.</i>

00:19:58.197 --> 00:20:00.908
<i>Drive system damage, repair complete.</i>

00:20:00.991 --> 00:20:04.412
<i>I'm now in a condition to move any time.</i>

00:20:05.621 --> 00:20:06.664
Yes!

00:20:07.248 --> 00:20:10.501
COLONEL: We can go any time now.
Black Trike's repairs are finished.

00:20:10.584 --> 00:20:13.003

Hey, Empress. What's the matter?

00:20:38.028 --> 00:20:40.197
(gasps)
Nothing.

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:43.325
What is it?

00:20:45.661 --> 00:20:48.956
Why are you staring at me
so lovingly all of the sudden?

00:20:49.039 --> 00:20:53.169
I just thought, the three of us
can do anything as long as we're together.

00:20:53.461 --> 00:20:55.463
What the hell is that, out of the blue?

00:20:55.921 --> 00:20:59.008
Have you heard of the trolley problem?

00:20:59.175 --> 00:21:00.259
You think I'm stupid?

00:21:00.342 --> 00:21:01.969
Of course, I know about it.

00:21:02.178 --> 00:21:03.429
What would you two do?

00:21:03.512 --> 00:21:06.307
I'd kill the guy
who thought up such a test.

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:09.935
It depends on if the ones I could save
include my loved ones.

00:21:10.269 --> 00:21:14.732
If not, then I don't care.
I'll just roll dice or something.

00:21:15.316 --> 00:21:16.150
(gasps)

00:21:16.233 --> 00:21:17.735
(chuckles)

00:21:17.818 --> 00:21:20.738
STRENGTH: Why are you laughing?
Did I say something funny?

00:21:20.821 --> 00:21:23.491
DEAD MASTER:
Oh, you have a nice smile, too.

00:21:24.074 --> 00:21:27.745
That was a strange robot,
wanting to form a baseball team.

00:21:27.828 --> 00:21:28.913
It was.

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.969

ANDY: <i>Are you a visitor?</i>

I'm the avenger.

00:22:07.535 --> 00:22:11.997
And I destroy everything Empress
gets involved with.
