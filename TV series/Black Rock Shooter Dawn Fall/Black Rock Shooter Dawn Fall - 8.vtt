WEBVTT

00:00:02.044 --> 00:00:04.046
(suspenseful music)

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:10.552
Huh?

00:00:21.063 --> 00:00:22.981
(trilling)

00:00:23.065 --> 00:00:25.984
The Arche level is safe.
We can take our masks off.

00:00:26.068 --> 00:00:27.444
(chuckles)

00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:28.987
Outside air at last.

00:00:29.071 --> 00:00:30.239
(grunts)

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:36.245
Humans are stuck in an endless war
after losing to machines

00:00:36.328 --> 00:00:37.955
in just four months.

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:41.208
The machines began
an extensive reconstruction of the Earth.

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:46.213
Their final plan is to connect the Earth
and the moon with the Orbital Elevator.

00:00:47.756 --> 00:00:53.095
Colonel, you said I have to get
to the Orbital Elevator.

00:00:53.178 --> 00:00:54.513
(sighs)

00:00:57.182 --> 00:00:58.100
COLONEL: Look.

00:00:58.183 --> 00:00:59.101
Mm?

00:01:01.186 --> 00:01:06.149
The cable from the moon continues
to stretch towards geosynchronous orbit.

00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:07.276
Mm-hm.

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:11.780
By our calculations, the warped cable
with a total length of 360,000 kilometers

00:01:11.863 --> 00:01:16.493
will connect to the Orbital Elevator
on the Earthside in two more weeks.

00:01:16.577 --> 00:01:19.288
COLONEL: That's Dawn Fall Day.

00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:23.041
Earth's final day. Humankind's deadline.

00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:24.251
What?

00:01:25.002 --> 00:01:30.048
The best-case scenario would be for us
to get to the Elevator on the Earthside

00:01:30.132 --> 00:01:33.010
in time and destroy it, and we win?

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:35.971
Yeah. For that, we need
to cross the Iron Ocean first.

00:01:36.054 --> 00:01:38.807
But the other side of the ocean
is Lunatic's territory.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.144
Once we've crossed,
there's no guarantee we'll make it back.

00:01:42.227 --> 00:01:46.064
Hey! I came along with you guys
to earn money for survival.

00:01:46.148 --> 00:01:50.360
What? Aren't you all worried
about not getting home alive?

00:01:50.444 --> 00:01:52.321
Not really. It's my duty.

00:01:52.404 --> 00:01:54.323
I must find the Light House.

00:01:55.407 --> 00:01:57.326
I'm going to follow Empress.

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.328
I'm going to kill Lunatic.

00:01:59.411 --> 00:02:01.830
Jeez. Are they serious?

00:02:01.913 --> 00:02:03.582
(slurps, sighs)

00:02:03.665 --> 00:02:06.585
Now is our last chance.
There's no turning back from here.

00:02:06.668 --> 00:02:09.254
Though I have no intention
of waiting for you to decide.

00:02:09.338 --> 00:02:10.297
What?

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.798
(beeping)

00:02:11.882 --> 00:02:13.800
What's happening?

00:02:14.676 --> 00:02:17.846
Oh, sorry. That must be our fault.

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:21.808
There's no way to avoid being contaminated
by Arche when we're out fishing.

00:02:21.892 --> 00:02:23.060
(both gasp)

00:02:26.063 --> 00:02:29.358
Do you represent the fishers
taking us across the Iron Ocean?

00:02:29.441 --> 00:02:31.902
Yes. I'm the captain of the fishers.

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:34.863
My name is Isana.
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

00:02:35.864 --> 00:02:37.783
I didn't expect you to be so young.

00:02:37.866 --> 00:02:38.825
Are you nervous?

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:42.162
No, I've found people
who don't engage in small talk

00:02:42.245 --> 00:02:43.872
are efficient and trustworthy.

00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:46.583
ISANA: Let's get down to business, then.

00:02:46.667 --> 00:02:49.378
The ship is at the dock.
We can set sail any time.

00:02:49.961 --> 00:02:51.254
Take me there.

00:02:56.051 --> 00:02:56.927
(chuckles)

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.387
(whimpers)

00:02:59.388 --> 00:03:00.389
(gasps softly)

00:03:03.558 --> 00:03:08.355
MONICA: <i>It was definitely</i>
<i>the biggest mistake of my life.</i>

00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:15.529
Monica.

00:03:15.612 --> 00:03:18.156
You sure like studying.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.909
I don't have anything else to do.

00:03:20.992 --> 00:03:24.663
How about you going into the ocean
with a weak body? Are you insane?

00:03:24.746 --> 00:03:29.626
It's okay. Why don't you come in, too,
and celebrate our friendship?

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.128
No way.

00:03:34.965 --> 00:03:36.633
(whimpers)

00:03:39.845 --> 00:03:42.639
Gosh. What are you doing, you idiot?

00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:49.271
Nice. You're cute when you're wet, Monica.

00:03:49.855 --> 00:03:53.316
You think you can get away with anything
just because you're pretty?

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.734
I think so.

00:03:55.193 --> 00:03:57.821
I'd let you get away with anything.

00:03:57.904 --> 00:03:59.072
(grunts)

00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:04.995
Hold your breath.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.922
MONICA: <i>Then soon after,</i>

00:04:16.381 --> 00:04:17.841
<i>she vanished,</i>

00:04:18.508 --> 00:04:22.637
<i>leaving a note that said,</i>
<i>"I'm going to die soon."</i>

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.480
EMPRESS: Monica.

00:04:32.606 --> 00:04:33.774
Oh, hello.

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:38.403
Are you seasick?

00:04:38.487 --> 00:04:41.698
I wish it was just seasickness.

00:04:41.782 --> 00:04:43.784
Do you have a relationship
with that person?

00:04:43.867 --> 00:04:46.286
I did, in the past.

00:04:46.912 --> 00:04:51.625
I thought she was long dead.

00:04:53.835 --> 00:04:57.547
We'll arrive on the opposite shore
around midnight.

00:04:57.631 --> 00:04:59.508
Where are you headed?

00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:01.760
Well, just to the moon.

00:05:01.843 --> 00:05:04.596
It'll be a long trip.

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:08.099
We'll take the shortest route
across the Iron Ocean for you.

00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:12.479
Hey, this ship looks pretty worn out.
Are you sure it's safe?

00:05:12.813 --> 00:05:17.108
We purposely let Iron Ocean creatures
live on the ship's hull.

00:05:17.192 --> 00:05:20.695
They serve as Arche countermeasures
and as camouflage against Gigantes...

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:23.448
(coughing)

00:05:23.532 --> 00:05:25.575
(retches)

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:26.576
(gasps)

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.664
Arche contamination. Must be serious
if you're coughing up crystals.

00:05:32.374 --> 00:05:35.502
The levels are high in the ocean air.

00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:39.172
Gas masks don't do much
if you're here for long periods of time.

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:42.759
Poaching Iron Ocean creatures
as raw materials for batteries

00:05:42.843 --> 00:05:46.555
make good money,
but it's hazardous to your health.

00:05:46.638 --> 00:05:50.183
Is that why you accepted our offer
from the Peacebuilding Force?

00:05:50.684 --> 00:05:52.853
Money to survive
and for settlement rights.

00:05:52.936 --> 00:05:56.982
I can finally carry out my duties
as the fishers' captain.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:59.985
Sex?

00:06:00.068 --> 00:06:02.362
What? Why all of a sudden?

00:06:02.445 --> 00:06:04.030
It's the act of love.

00:06:04.114 --> 00:06:08.743
When I was distressed before,
you said it might help.

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:10.954
(sighs)

00:06:11.037 --> 00:06:12.080
I see.

00:06:12.622 --> 00:06:14.916
Well, you could say
I have a grown-up problem

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.459
that not even sex can solve.

00:06:16.543 --> 00:06:18.587
Whoa!

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:19.963
Now? Here?

00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:21.214
Quiet.

00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:26.386
Iron Ocean creatures.

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:27.929
Not just them.

00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:33.101
Gigantes?

00:06:33.977 --> 00:06:37.230
(water splashes)

00:06:41.818 --> 00:06:43.737
Jeez. That was so close.

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:55.248
(screeches)

00:06:56.583 --> 00:06:57.584
Gross.

00:06:57.667 --> 00:06:58.585
It's eating them.

00:06:58.668 --> 00:07:01.296
Looks like it was hiding
in the ocean trench.

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:02.339
Monica!

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:04.633
Is this your damn fault again?

00:07:04.716 --> 00:07:07.010
What do you mean "again"?
I've got nothing to do with this!

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:09.846
(buzzing)

00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:13.433
-Bastards!
-ISANA: Stop.

00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:15.560
Don't use guns on them.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:22.734
The Swarm Division will hear the gunshots
and flock over here.

00:07:23.318 --> 00:07:26.738
But we'll be eaten by Gigantes
if we do nothing.

00:07:26.821 --> 00:07:29.532
Gigantes hasn't even noticed us yet.

00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:30.784
COLONEL: What?

00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:35.664
Our ship is disguised as a reef.
Leave it to me.

00:07:35.747 --> 00:07:37.540
All right. Go ahead.

00:07:38.708 --> 00:07:40.877
It's me. Stop the engine.

00:07:46.966 --> 00:07:48.635
We'll wait till they pass.

00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:02.816
(water splashing)

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:04.109
You were right.

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:13.827
Swarm Division.

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:16.996
It's a bit troublesome to battle them.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:21.459
-We'll be okay. If we stay quiet, they...
-MONICA: Wow!

00:08:23.294 --> 00:08:26.214
Keep quiet, or I'll dump you
in the Iron Ocean, Monica!

00:08:26.297 --> 00:08:28.425
Just look at that.

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:32.595
(snickers)

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:35.265
I smell a big stash of money.

00:08:40.019 --> 00:08:41.146
Be careful.

00:08:41.312 --> 00:08:42.689
Okay. I'll be back.

00:08:45.817 --> 00:08:50.655
You'd better be sure about there being
organic enhancement parts for Empress.

00:08:50.739 --> 00:08:51.740
I'm positive.

00:08:51.823 --> 00:08:54.909
We're detecting some pretty
big organic parts there.

00:08:54.993 --> 00:08:56.870
MONICA: If Empress absorbs them,

00:08:56.953 --> 00:08:59.748
future battles should become
much easier to win.

00:08:59.831 --> 00:09:03.585
You aren't just trying to get
a hold of rare parts, are you?

00:09:03.668 --> 00:09:04.711
(grunts)

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:14.846
For giant creatures,
they all seem to be tame.

00:09:15.346 --> 00:09:18.099
Most Iron Ocean creatures
are surprisingly tame.

00:09:18.725 --> 00:09:20.769
ISANA: But there are some
that are vicious.

00:09:20.852 --> 00:09:25.231
We had to hurry back
with... Monica's loot.

00:09:25.315 --> 00:09:29.360
Why did she stay on the ship?
This was her idea.

00:09:29.444 --> 00:09:32.113
Well, maybe that's my fault.

00:09:32.697 --> 00:09:33.615
STRENGTH: Whatever that means.

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.535
This place is full of bugs.

00:09:37.619 --> 00:09:40.121
Good thing we left Dead Master
on the ship.

00:09:40.705 --> 00:09:41.873
Why is that?

00:09:41.956 --> 00:09:44.751
She's always really hated bugs.

00:09:44.834 --> 00:09:47.462
If she were here,
she'd be shooting them left and right.

00:09:47.545 --> 00:09:48.713
Bugs.

00:09:48.797 --> 00:09:52.842
Bugs are scary. Bugs are gross.
(whimpers)

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:58.098
You know me from back
when we were at Light House Number Eight.

00:09:58.181 --> 00:10:00.141
EMPRESS: You know how I was in the past.

00:10:00.225 --> 00:10:02.060
That was the former you.

00:10:02.143 --> 00:10:05.146
I don't remember much about those days
at the Light House...

00:10:09.192 --> 00:10:12.654
Oh, by the way, why are you so small?

00:10:13.238 --> 00:10:15.657
Never mind, it doesn't matter, I guess.

00:10:19.994 --> 00:10:21.287
(soft exhale)

00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:24.707
STRENGTH: One thing I remember

00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:27.418
is that we had a discussion
about the "Plank of Carneades."

00:10:27.961 --> 00:10:33.383
After a shipwreck, a plank supports
one survivor in the ocean.

00:10:34.008 --> 00:10:36.302
The plank can only support one person.

00:10:36.386 --> 00:10:41.891
Would it be okay for that person
to survive by letting others drown?

00:10:42.684 --> 00:10:44.144
What was your answer?

00:10:45.895 --> 00:10:47.689
I would push everybody off.

00:10:48.773 --> 00:10:49.941
What was my answer?

00:10:51.401 --> 00:10:52.735
Strength. Isana.

00:10:55.405 --> 00:10:57.407
(thrilling music)

00:11:02.662 --> 00:11:03.788
What...

00:11:05.165 --> 00:11:06.332
(grunts)

00:11:09.544 --> 00:11:10.378
(grunts in pain)

00:11:10.962 --> 00:11:12.005
Crap!

00:11:14.716 --> 00:11:16.634
I wouldn't push anyone off.

00:11:17.552 --> 00:11:18.887
What does that mean?

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:20.847
My answer to the plank problem.

00:11:20.972 --> 00:11:24.392
We're Hemiteos Units, so we wouldn't die.

00:11:24.809 --> 00:11:27.520
I'd find a way for everyone to survive.

00:11:28.605 --> 00:11:30.023
[inaudible]

00:11:30.732 --> 00:11:31.816
You haven't changed.

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:32.984
What?

00:11:33.401 --> 00:11:35.069
Just shut up and move over.

00:11:38.281 --> 00:11:39.449
Are you all right?

00:11:40.158 --> 00:11:42.327
We're fine. You can go back now.

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:44.370
Thanks for coming this far with us.

00:11:49.626 --> 00:11:53.755
My answer might be,
"to jump in the ocean myself."

00:12:01.262 --> 00:12:02.347
(hissing)

00:12:04.766 --> 00:12:06.893
This is making me itchy.

00:12:06.976 --> 00:12:11.731
Your skin is touching the Iron Ocean
and it's just itchy? How incredibly tough.

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:15.693
I detect the presence
of organic parts nearby.

00:12:15.777 --> 00:12:18.446
A treasure chest hidden on an island, huh?

00:12:18.905 --> 00:12:23.952
Wait a minute.
Why isn't Gigantes detecting it, too?

00:12:24.035 --> 00:12:25.119
That is strange.

00:12:25.203 --> 00:12:27.705
I have a bad feeling about this.

00:12:32.919 --> 00:12:34.128
What the hell?

00:12:34.212 --> 00:12:36.839
Gigantes. But it's dead.

00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:42.637
EMPRESS: Should we go in? It's dead.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.806
It doesn't matter because it's dead.

00:12:44.889 --> 00:12:48.226
The least we can do
is effectively recycle it.

00:12:51.396 --> 00:12:52.522
It's pitch-black.

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:57.110
We have the ability to see in the dark
if we try hard enough. Let's go.

00:12:57.193 --> 00:12:58.361
Okay.

00:13:06.744 --> 00:13:08.288
The captain has returned.

00:13:08.913 --> 00:13:11.791
Empress and Strength aren't with her.
I wonder why?

00:13:15.586 --> 00:13:18.673
STRENGTH: My Gigantic Arms are stuck
and I can't get through.

00:13:18.756 --> 00:13:20.008
Did you find anything?

00:13:20.591 --> 00:13:22.010
Yeah, I did.

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:28.266
-(warbles)
-(gasps)

00:13:29.684 --> 00:13:33.521
SEITAI PARTS: <i>Empress Code confirmed.</i>
<i>Restarting system.</i>

00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:35.565
What?

00:13:35.648 --> 00:13:37.317
This thing is still alive.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:38.443
I'm going to pull it out.

00:13:38.526 --> 00:13:39.944
(grunts)

00:13:40.028 --> 00:13:41.529
(rumbling)

00:13:41.612 --> 00:13:42.780
(both yelp)

00:13:43.281 --> 00:13:44.240
What's happening?

00:13:44.323 --> 00:13:47.118
This shaking is not normal.
We're leaving now.

00:13:47.702 --> 00:13:48.995
They're not back yet.

00:13:49.579 --> 00:13:51.414
The safety of the ship comes first.

00:13:55.418 --> 00:13:57.628
That is not acceptable to me.

00:14:01.924 --> 00:14:07.013
SEITAI PARTS: <i>Error. Update Empress Code.</i>

00:14:07.597 --> 00:14:12.018
<i>Error. Update Empress Code.</i>

00:14:15.438 --> 00:14:16.814
We're safe for now.

00:14:18.649 --> 00:14:21.652
(buzzing)

00:14:24.155 --> 00:14:26.074
We're safe?

00:14:26.157 --> 00:14:27.158
STRENGTH: I don't think so.

00:14:32.371 --> 00:14:34.082
Whoa! This hurts!

00:14:34.582 --> 00:14:37.877
-It's just itchy for you? Are you serious?
-Hm?

00:14:40.379 --> 00:14:43.633
The shaking stopped.
We are going to wait for Empress.

00:14:44.092 --> 00:14:46.552
That shaking was clearly abnormal.

00:14:46.636 --> 00:14:49.639
Our safety is not guaranteed.
We must leave now.

00:14:49.722 --> 00:14:54.185
Wait. From the looks of it,
I'm sure those two are responsible.

00:14:54.268 --> 00:14:56.896
They can take care of themselves.
Let's go.

00:14:57.021 --> 00:15:00.191
Colonel, do you really want
to die that badly?

00:15:02.985 --> 00:15:04.153
(gasps)

00:15:04.821 --> 00:15:05.863
DEAD MASTER: Empress!

00:15:07.782 --> 00:15:09.700
(whimpering)

00:15:13.246 --> 00:15:15.039
Die, you damn stalker bug!

00:15:15.123 --> 00:15:16.707
Don't shoot, you idiot!

00:15:16.791 --> 00:15:19.836
(weapon firing)

00:15:23.589 --> 00:15:25.591
(suspenseful music)

00:15:26.092 --> 00:15:27.135
Go!

00:15:32.723 --> 00:15:36.018
They're coming. Swarm Division.

00:15:36.602 --> 00:15:40.189
Oh, that's right.
I totally forgot guns are prohibited.

00:15:40.273 --> 00:15:41.691
From this side, too.

00:15:43.526 --> 00:15:44.360
(yelps)

00:15:45.778 --> 00:15:46.904
Hey.

00:15:47.905 --> 00:15:49.824
It's getting interesting.

00:15:49.907 --> 00:15:51.492
(rumbles)

00:15:51.576 --> 00:15:53.494
Whoa. Oh, no!

00:15:53.578 --> 00:15:55.496
(yelping)

00:15:56.831 --> 00:15:59.625
Phew! Thanks. Uh?

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:04.422
Huh? What are you doing?

00:16:04.505 --> 00:16:08.176
I don't want to die yet.
Maybe I'll take this and run.

00:16:10.553 --> 00:16:11.929
Be serious.

00:16:13.472 --> 00:16:16.309
Are you trying to disappear
from my life again?

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:25.484
I don't have that long to live.
So I'll be the decoy.

00:16:25.568 --> 00:16:27.361
I can't let you die, Monica.

00:16:27.445 --> 00:16:29.322
(gasps, grunts)

00:16:29.947 --> 00:16:33.159
-(coughing)
-(gasps)

00:16:33.242 --> 00:16:34.869
(groaning)

00:16:35.703 --> 00:16:36.871
Isana.

00:16:36.954 --> 00:16:38.873
(quivering)

00:16:38.956 --> 00:16:40.458
You're such an idiot.

00:16:42.084 --> 00:16:44.462
-(grumbles)
-(weapon fires)

00:16:44.545 --> 00:16:48.883
(explosions)

00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:56.015
Empress! Above you!

00:16:56.098 --> 00:16:58.476
(zapping)

00:17:01.187 --> 00:17:02.355
I missed.

00:17:03.231 --> 00:17:06.400
There's nowhere to hide.
We could get wiped out.

00:17:08.986 --> 00:17:10.655
Monica, what are you doing?

00:17:10.738 --> 00:17:13.866
It's getting rough,
so I'm leaving with the valuables.

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:14.909
Don't try to find me.

00:17:15.993 --> 00:17:18.412
What is she now, a looter?

00:17:18.496 --> 00:17:20.790
No. She's being a decoy.

00:17:22.625 --> 00:17:24.168
I know that.

00:17:24.252 --> 00:17:25.253
What should we do?

00:17:25.836 --> 00:17:31.008
Dogs don't clean up after their own feces.
That's the owner's responsibility.

00:17:31.092 --> 00:17:34.345
-Then...
-Go. Capture the deserter.

00:17:34.428 --> 00:17:35.763
All right. I'm going to.

00:17:35.846 --> 00:17:37.848
(action music)

00:17:40.351 --> 00:17:41.185
Empress.

00:17:46.774 --> 00:17:47.942
(grunts)

00:17:55.199 --> 00:17:58.035
(gun zapping)

00:18:00.621 --> 00:18:01.872
GUN: <i>Cool down.</i>

00:18:08.421 --> 00:18:10.798
They've become easier to target.

00:18:13.134 --> 00:18:14.093
Take that!

00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:25.438
I wanted to tell you something
when you went away from me.

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:28.482
What's this all of a sudden?

00:18:29.358 --> 00:18:31.485
Let me be with you when you die.

00:18:31.569 --> 00:18:33.070
(gasps)

00:18:34.405 --> 00:18:35.781
I will.

00:18:39.619 --> 00:18:41.120
I'm not going to let you die, stupid.

00:18:41.621 --> 00:18:44.915
Don't take away my reason to live again.

00:18:52.298 --> 00:18:54.634
(growling)

00:19:10.274 --> 00:19:11.359
(gasps)

00:19:19.367 --> 00:19:21.786
Isana!

00:19:29.335 --> 00:19:32.004
-Empress.
-(gasps)

00:19:32.088 --> 00:19:34.090
(ethereal music)

00:19:42.014 --> 00:19:44.517
SEITAI PARTS:
<i>Empress Code update confirmed.</i>

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.519
<i>Starting RNA transcription.</i>

00:20:00.658 --> 00:20:02.326
Execute enhancement.

00:20:15.631 --> 00:20:18.050
(zapping)

00:20:33.691 --> 00:20:34.942
(sighs)

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.995
It's cold! I'm glad I brought a coat.

00:20:46.579 --> 00:20:47.872
We've been waiting for you.

00:20:47.955 --> 00:20:51.584
We'll guide you to the meeting point
for the Orbital Elevator Attack.

00:20:52.084 --> 00:20:53.377
I'm counting on you.

00:20:53.627 --> 00:20:56.255
And this is what you asked for.

00:20:57.423 --> 00:20:59.091
How's Empress doing?

00:20:59.425 --> 00:21:02.136
She's sleeping.
She seems to have a slight fever.

00:21:02.219 --> 00:21:07.057
STRENGTH: She absorbed so much energy
all at once, so no wonder.

00:21:07.892 --> 00:21:12.521
Though there were unexpected problems,
we crossed the Iron Ocean as planned.

00:21:13.063 --> 00:21:14.648
Here's the payment we promised.

00:21:17.693 --> 00:21:19.236
That's all?

00:21:19.862 --> 00:21:21.947
That's the imminent danger pay.

00:21:22.031 --> 00:21:24.241
I also got you
the land certificate you wanted.

00:21:26.952 --> 00:21:27.995
(gasps)

00:21:28.078 --> 00:21:30.498
ISANA: A settlement in San Diego.

00:21:30.581 --> 00:21:32.750
Is anything the matter?

00:21:33.709 --> 00:21:34.794
(chuckles)

00:21:34.877 --> 00:21:35.711
No.

00:21:36.462 --> 00:21:39.965
Thank you for these payments.
Have a safe journey, everybody.

00:21:40.716 --> 00:21:43.177
So, what are you gonna do now?

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:46.305
Now? Of course, I'll continue on with you.

00:21:46.388 --> 00:21:51.227
I'm convinced now that
there are more valuable items to be found.

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:52.853
(Monica giggles)

00:21:52.937 --> 00:21:54.396
Monica.

00:21:55.523 --> 00:21:56.398
What?

00:21:56.982 --> 00:21:58.150
See you again.

00:22:00.319 --> 00:22:03.656
I guess I'll be seeing you
when I get back.

00:22:03.739 --> 00:22:05.658
Let's swim in the ocean together.

00:22:06.242 --> 00:22:08.494
ISANA: This time, to commemorate our love.

00:22:11.121 --> 00:22:12.873
No way.

00:22:13.999 --> 00:22:15.960
(closing theme music)
