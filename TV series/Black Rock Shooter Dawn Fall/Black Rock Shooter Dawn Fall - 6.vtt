(suspenseful music)

00:00:42.793 --> 00:00:43.669
(gasps softly)

00:00:44.503 --> 00:00:45.712
SMILEY: Congratulations.

00:00:46.505 --> 00:00:47.631
Uh...

00:00:48.507 --> 00:00:49.508
(gasps)

00:00:51.426 --> 00:00:52.636
Hm...

00:00:54.763 --> 00:00:55.681
Uh...

00:00:56.265 --> 00:00:58.809
You've passed the Adaptability Test.

00:00:59.768 --> 00:01:02.562
(whimpering)

00:01:02.646 --> 00:01:04.356
No need to worry.

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.362
After we turn you into a Hemiteos Unit,
you're going to conceive my child.

00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:12.739
(frantic breathing)

00:01:13.448 --> 00:01:18.036
The time has come for you to undergo
full-scale modification surgery.

00:01:18.537 --> 00:01:20.872
You shall be reborn.

00:01:23.417 --> 00:01:25.460
However, at the time of surgery,

00:01:25.544 --> 00:01:29.298
if you are so unwilling
and full of sorrow,

00:01:29.381 --> 00:01:31.758
that's not my true intention.

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.428
SMILEY: What I want you to do

00:01:34.511 --> 00:01:39.182
is have pride in the fact that
you are going to become a wonderful being.

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.358
Artemis, the Goddess of Machines,
who is on the moon...

00:01:48.442 --> 00:01:51.737
Humans are in the process
of being eliminated by Her selection.

00:01:52.738 --> 00:01:54.614
It's nothing to be sad about.

00:01:54.698 --> 00:01:55.615
Huh?

00:01:55.699 --> 00:02:00.746
SMILEY: Switching of the superior species
is a healthy thing, in the long term.

00:02:01.747 --> 00:02:02.956
For example,

00:02:04.207 --> 00:02:08.962
any sharp blade develops rough edges
as time goes by.

00:02:09.546 --> 00:02:14.343
Then it must be sharpened,
but that also has a limit.

00:02:14.926 --> 00:02:20.349
There is no other choice
than to find a new blade, that's all.

00:02:20.932 --> 00:02:24.561
Artemis was originally created by humans.

00:02:25.062 --> 00:02:27.272
Do you know why it turned out this way?

00:02:28.857 --> 00:02:35.155
Humans made Artemis wiser
and more loyal than anything else.

00:02:35.864 --> 00:02:37.658
That was the big mistake.

00:02:40.243 --> 00:02:43.413
Humans have domesticated
countless species of animals.

00:02:43.497 --> 00:02:48.877
But none of those animals posed a threat
by rising up against humans.

00:02:49.461 --> 00:02:54.633
Humans should have made Artemis
somewhat unwise and weak.

00:02:54.716 --> 00:02:57.177
The humans who created Artemis

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.890
did not understand
what is important at all.

00:03:01.973 --> 00:03:05.936
(panting)

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.355
(action music)

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:12.442
VOLT: Identification signal received.

00:03:12.526 --> 00:03:15.237
It's Hemiteos Unit, Strength.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.072
We should hurry, too.

00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:28.250
Get ready. We're starting.

00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:29.251
(grunts)

00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:35.006
(weapon firing)

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.133
(Strength grunts)

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:38.885
I came for payback!

00:03:41.513 --> 00:03:43.306
MAN: <i>The enemy has entered</i>
<i>our Main Temple,</i>

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.434
<i>the Overland Aircraft Carrier.</i>

00:03:45.517 --> 00:03:48.437
<i>There are more enemies approaching.</i>

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.981
<i>All crews intercept at full power.</i>

00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:54.276
(explosion)

00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:02.200
It's time to make good on our education.

00:04:02.284 --> 00:04:05.829
Death to the uneducated barbarians.

00:04:05.912 --> 00:04:07.914
(action music)

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:12.294
Mm...

00:04:12.377 --> 00:04:14.671
Don't be too reckless.

00:04:14.754 --> 00:04:17.799
I can't let you die in a place like this.

00:04:18.592 --> 00:04:22.554
I'll be okay. You'll protect me.

00:04:22.637 --> 00:04:23.555
Uh...

00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:27.058
Oh, you are so right.

00:04:30.645 --> 00:04:31.813
(giggles)

00:04:31.897 --> 00:04:33.857
You're such an angel.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.151
You are my beloved angel.

00:04:36.234 --> 00:04:37.736
(chuckles)

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:39.488
(gunshot)

00:04:39.571 --> 00:04:41.156
This is crazy.

00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:43.074
It's getting crazier by the minute.

00:04:43.158 --> 00:04:45.702
I feel like I made a big mistake
along the way.

00:04:45.786 --> 00:04:49.498
Looking back rationally,
there's no need for me to do this.

00:04:49.581 --> 00:04:53.960
Shut up! You've already lost your chance
to get out, so brace yourself.

00:04:55.796 --> 00:04:57.964
The whole gang is here for a car chase.

00:04:58.048 --> 00:05:01.635
Car chase? Seems to me like
just another excuse to exchange fire.

00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:04.471
I'd like to know your definition
of a car chase.

00:05:04.554 --> 00:05:07.724
You keep babbling,
just don't bite your tongue, driver.

00:05:07.808 --> 00:05:09.226
(blasting)

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.686
BLACK TRIKE:
<i>Enemy threat level assessment.</i>

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.274
<i>I recommend prioritizing the elimination</i>
<i>of those with anti-tank offensive power.</i>

00:05:16.358 --> 00:05:17.275
Got it.

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:19.986
(action music)

00:05:21.363 --> 00:05:23.698
(zooming)

00:05:30.872 --> 00:05:32.290
(zaps, blasts)

00:05:46.638 --> 00:05:48.682
Colonel, what is our plan from here?

00:05:48.765 --> 00:05:52.686
Send Empress and Dead Master
to the Overland Aircraft Carrier, for now.

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:55.480
I'll figure out
what we're doing after that.

00:05:55.564 --> 00:05:56.731
Roger.

00:05:56.815 --> 00:06:01.236
Are Peacebuilding Force operations
always this haphazard?

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:02.988
I'm surprised you've survived.

00:06:03.071 --> 00:06:06.366
Of course,
we're not always this haphazard!

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:08.451
(gunshots)

00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:14.791
STRENGTH: Let's hurry because this place
is a den of perverts.

00:06:14.875 --> 00:06:16.710
NORITO: Don't say it like that.

00:06:16.793 --> 00:06:19.087
It makes me more worried about my sister.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.464
Don't wimp out on me now.

00:06:22.173 --> 00:06:26.261
(gunshots)

00:06:26.344 --> 00:06:29.347
Do you really think those BB guns
would work on me?

00:06:29.431 --> 00:06:34.269
(explosions)

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:39.649
Interesting.

00:06:40.358 --> 00:06:42.360
(foreboding music)

00:06:42.444 --> 00:06:44.404
(squelching)

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:47.657
(gasps)

00:06:49.993 --> 00:06:52.912
I shall educate them.

00:07:01.713 --> 00:07:03.340
These are...

00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:04.716
(gasps)

00:07:06.968 --> 00:07:09.137
(whimpering)

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.055
STRENGTH: Hey.

00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:13.141
Hey.

00:07:13.725 --> 00:07:17.646
I know how you feel, but make sure
your sister's not one of these bodies.

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:18.688
NORITO: No!

00:07:18.772 --> 00:07:19.689
STRENGTH: You have to.

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:21.816
Don't waste our time.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:25.195
If her body's here,
the rescue mission is over.

00:07:28.323 --> 00:07:29.199
I understand.

00:07:30.408 --> 00:07:33.203
Rescue mission...

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:34.954
What's the matter?

00:07:35.038 --> 00:07:39.292
Well, we did come here
to rescue your sister,

00:07:39.376 --> 00:07:42.921
but it's turning
into something more than that.

00:07:44.005 --> 00:07:45.674
This reminds me of...

00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:52.806
going into the kitchen to clean up,
and finding a cockroach.

00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:57.227
I can't leave the kitchen
until I kill the cockroach.

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:58.728
That's how I feel.

00:07:59.521 --> 00:08:01.564
(ominous music)

00:08:05.527 --> 00:08:07.237
LUNATIC: All preparations are done.

Where the hell is Smiley?

00:08:22.544 --> 00:08:27.090
This unit's supposed to be for him.
I can't make adjustments without him.

00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:31.553
For times like this,

00:08:31.636 --> 00:08:34.931
he should have uploaded
his bio-information frequently.

00:08:35.014 --> 00:08:36.224
I mean, jeez.

00:08:36.307 --> 00:08:38.268

(sighs)
I'm bored.

00:08:43.773 --> 00:08:46.026
Too much time with nothing to do.

00:12:25.787 --> 00:12:28.414
You... You're not human?

00:12:29.415 --> 00:12:32.752
<i>Don't lump me in</i>
<i>with those ignorant humans.</i>

00:12:32.835 --> 00:12:34.545
<i>I'm more similar to you girls.</i>

00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:37.423
<i>My child will be</i>
<i>even more perfect than me.</i>

00:12:38.007 --> 00:12:40.927
Child? Are you going to
make Miya your bride?

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:45.682
<i>Yes. None of the ultimate sacrifices</i>
<i>will be in vain.</i>

00:12:45.765 --> 00:12:46.724
(groans)

00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:51.813
Ultimate sacrifices...

00:12:52.438 --> 00:12:54.691
<i>I've finally found the one</i>
<i>who's adaptable to me.</i>

00:12:54.774 --> 00:12:57.068
<i>The female who is worthy of my body.</i>

00:12:57.151 --> 00:13:00.488
<i>And you are also qualified.</i>
<i>You should be happy.</i>

00:13:00.571 --> 00:13:01.864
I'll never forgive you.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.119
Don't be too hard on you?

00:13:06.202 --> 00:13:07.870
STRENGTH: You're just a freak.

00:13:08.454 --> 00:13:12.250
How could you? There are no freaks here.

00:13:12.333 --> 00:13:16.838
It's just me who is Artemis' human avatar,

00:13:16.921 --> 00:13:20.300
and you who is one
of the silly guardians of humans.

00:13:20.383 --> 00:13:24.345
Two of us who share the same origins,
but are total opposites,

00:13:24.429 --> 00:13:28.349
similar to two poles on magnets
that repel each other.

00:13:28.433 --> 00:13:31.561
Enough with your nonsense.

00:13:35.523 --> 00:13:36.441
I'll blow you away!

00:13:37.275 --> 00:13:38.443
(zaps)

00:13:38.526 --> 00:13:40.445
(gasps)

00:13:40.528 --> 00:13:41.696
Tch.

00:13:41.779 --> 00:13:42.947
STRENGTH: Darn it.

00:13:47.118 --> 00:13:48.202
Ta-dah!

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:51.622
Now, it's my turn.

00:13:51.706 --> 00:13:53.124
I'll blow you away!

00:13:53.207 --> 00:13:54.709
(tires screech)

00:14:09.182 --> 00:14:10.433
(gasps)

00:14:11.684 --> 00:14:12.852
You're mine.

00:14:17.315 --> 00:14:18.316
(grunts)

00:14:28.076 --> 00:14:29.494
(Black Trike whimpers)

00:14:29.577 --> 00:14:32.371
Quite impressive,
but since it has come to this...

00:14:32.955 --> 00:14:35.750
Behold, Smiley's ultimate form.

00:14:41.798 --> 00:14:42.715
-(grunts)
-(gasps)

00:14:43.549 --> 00:14:46.552
-This will teach you! Learn!
-(Empress groans)

00:14:48.638 --> 00:14:51.599
That felt good.

00:14:51.682 --> 00:14:52.975
How does this feel?

00:14:54.227 --> 00:14:56.729
(Smiley gasps, whimpers in pain)

00:14:58.481 --> 00:15:01.150
That one looks kind of menacing.

00:15:01.234 --> 00:15:02.985
(weapon firing)

00:15:04.987 --> 00:15:06.155
BLACK TRIKE: <i>Ouch!</i>

00:15:06.239 --> 00:15:07.782
Black Trike.

00:15:07.865 --> 00:15:10.618
<i>Serious damage to the main engine.</i>

00:15:10.701 --> 00:15:14.789
<i>ECU self-diagnosis</i>
<i>and troubleshooting program initiated.</i>

00:15:17.375 --> 00:15:19.502
Hm... Out of ammunition, eh?

00:15:23.297 --> 00:15:24.757
Even his own men?

00:15:31.848 --> 00:15:35.268
Colonel, Empress is engaging
in a battle with Smiley.

00:15:35.351 --> 00:15:36.769
VOLT: Permission to back her up.

00:15:37.645 --> 00:15:41.065
COLONEL: <i>Permitted. Don't be reckless.</i>

00:15:41.149 --> 00:15:42.567
Roger.

00:15:47.155 --> 00:15:48.322
(gasps)

00:15:50.533 --> 00:15:52.577
Don't be reckless, he says.

00:16:04.547 --> 00:16:07.758
LUNATIC: Oh, is that all you got?

00:16:07.842 --> 00:16:10.052
STRENGTH: No way, of course not.

00:16:11.596 --> 00:16:14.599
LUNATIC: I'm going to take
my time with you.

00:16:15.349 --> 00:16:17.977
SMILEY (evil laughter): What's the matter?

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:20.479
You've got nothing left?
There's more from me.

00:16:21.606 --> 00:16:23.024
(groaning)

00:16:25.109 --> 00:16:27.403
Colonel! I'm leaving the future up to you!

00:16:27.486 --> 00:16:28.988
What?

00:16:29.071 --> 00:16:30.656
(explosion)

00:16:32.992 --> 00:16:34.160
Volt.

00:16:36.454 --> 00:16:39.665
SMILEY: How much more
are you going to disappoint me

00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:42.293
when we are right in the middle of...

00:16:42.376 --> 00:16:43.294
(zaps)

00:16:43.377 --> 00:16:44.712
...education?

00:16:49.717 --> 00:16:52.136
(panting)

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.764
BLACK TRIKE: <i>You did it, Empress.</i>

00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:57.141
Mm. So now I just have to...

00:16:58.976 --> 00:17:02.647
(metal squealing)

00:17:10.529 --> 00:17:13.950
Huh? Did they just destroy
the Educational Institution?

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:17.578
What are you going to do?

00:17:17.662 --> 00:17:19.205
That's all for today.

00:17:19.288 --> 00:17:21.332
Never mind about the Institution.

00:17:21.415 --> 00:17:24.335
LUNATIC: But it'll be a problem
if Charlotte is abducted.

00:17:24.418 --> 00:17:28.756
Smiley never showed up, either.
This whole day is messed up.

00:17:29.882 --> 00:17:31.425
I'll reward you for not breaking.

00:17:32.134 --> 00:17:36.681
That kid's sister can be found in a lab
at the end of that corridor.

00:17:36.764 --> 00:17:38.140
(gasps)

00:17:38.224 --> 00:17:39.308
STRENGTH: Why are you--

00:17:39.392 --> 00:17:42.311
LUNATIC: But you have to promise
we'll play again.

00:17:42.937 --> 00:17:45.356
For now, I'm out of here.

00:17:45.439 --> 00:17:47.483
See you again!

00:17:48.943 --> 00:17:50.820
(gasps)

00:17:50.903 --> 00:17:52.113
Miya!

00:17:53.531 --> 00:17:54.365
Tch.

00:17:54.991 --> 00:17:56.450
STRENGTH: That witch.

00:17:56.951 --> 00:17:59.120
I barely survived.

00:18:03.499 --> 00:18:04.458
(groans)

00:18:05.001 --> 00:18:06.002
(gasps)

00:18:07.086 --> 00:18:08.254
MIYA: Norito.

00:18:08.337 --> 00:18:09.171
Miya.

00:18:09.255 --> 00:18:11.424
NORITO (sobs): I'm so happy. Miya.

00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:15.636
EMPRESS: Smiley wasn't human.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.054
That's right.

00:18:17.138 --> 00:18:19.682
He couldn't make babies with humans.

00:18:19.765 --> 00:18:24.478
That's why he tried to create pseudo
Hemiteos Units to conceive a child.

00:18:24.562 --> 00:18:26.480
It's all a sick joke.

00:18:27.106 --> 00:18:30.151
Is my daughter his bride, too?

00:18:30.234 --> 00:18:32.528
She was probably modified
for that purpose.

00:18:33.696 --> 00:18:36.198
But if it had been a success,
there wouldn't be

00:18:36.282 --> 00:18:38.951
any reason to target Miya or Empress.

00:18:39.035 --> 00:18:41.120
Something must have gone wrong.

00:18:41.704 --> 00:18:42.830
I see.

00:18:43.456 --> 00:18:45.124
STRENGTH: Your daughter...

00:18:45.207 --> 00:18:46.250
Charlotte?

00:18:46.334 --> 00:18:47.835
STRENGTH: Yeah, Charlotte.

00:18:47.918 --> 00:18:52.757
While I was fighting in that monstrosity,
I met a girl named Lunatic.

00:18:53.341 --> 00:18:55.593
She said she was Artemis' human avatar.

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:57.595
Lunatic.

00:18:58.179 --> 00:19:01.807
STRENGTH: She said it would be a problem
if Charlotte was abducted from them.

00:19:02.308 --> 00:19:03.309
So?

00:19:03.392 --> 00:19:04.602
STRENGTH: Isn't it strange?

00:19:05.186 --> 00:19:08.189
She said "abducted," not "killed."

00:19:08.272 --> 00:19:09.523
(gasps)

00:19:09.607 --> 00:19:13.319
I see. It might be possible
to deprogram her from their mind control.

00:19:13.903 --> 00:19:17.323
At any rate, it's meaningful
to get Charlotte back from them.

00:19:17.406 --> 00:19:18.491
(sighs)

00:19:19.867 --> 00:19:20.868
(grunts)

00:19:21.452 --> 00:19:23.663
Okay, we're ready to go now.

00:19:23.746 --> 00:19:26.040
Thank you. You have helped us a lot.

00:19:26.123 --> 00:19:27.291
Thank you.

00:19:27.375 --> 00:19:30.378
You'd better not be captured
by weirdos ever again.

00:19:30.461 --> 00:19:31.754
I know.

00:19:33.506 --> 00:19:36.634
Are you going with Empress, Strength?

00:19:36.717 --> 00:19:40.763
I guess. There are cockroaches
that need to be completely exterminated.

00:19:40.846 --> 00:19:44.266
If I go with them,
I'll probably meet that witch again.

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:46.268
STRENGTH: Then I'll beat her to a pulp.

00:19:46.352 --> 00:19:48.020
You were no match for her.

00:19:48.604 --> 00:19:51.565
What? You want to get your ass kicked?

00:19:58.739 --> 00:20:00.116
Norito.

00:20:00.658 --> 00:20:04.078
I have a feeling
they're going to change the world.

00:20:05.079 --> 00:20:06.038
Yeah.

00:20:07.415 --> 00:20:08.999
NORITO: I feel like that, too.

00:20:12.753 --> 00:20:15.047
How are you doing, Black Trike?

00:20:15.131 --> 00:20:16.674
BLACK TRIKE: <i>The damage is too serious</i>

00:20:16.757 --> 00:20:19.385
<i>to be serviced</i>
<i>by the self-repair function.</i>

00:20:19.468 --> 00:20:22.471
<i>In order to keep driving,</i>
<i>repairs must be made by hand</i>

00:20:22.555 --> 00:20:26.308
<i>using the maintenance manual</i>
<i>within six hours.</i>

00:20:26.892 --> 00:20:29.937
Okay. Wait just a little bit.

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:31.355
BLACK TRIKE: <i>Roger.</i>

00:20:35.735 --> 00:20:40.614
There was no trace of your daughter
at the crash site.

00:20:40.698 --> 00:20:42.616
She's probably still alive and kicking.

00:20:43.701 --> 00:20:44.618
Yes.

00:20:45.327 --> 00:20:51.083
Anyway, we're back to heading
towards Artemis' Orbital Elevator.

00:20:51.167 --> 00:20:52.293
Yes, we are.

00:20:52.877 --> 00:20:54.712
By the way, Monica?

00:20:54.795 --> 00:20:59.675
Is your map system
that doesn't use GPS still working?

00:20:59.759 --> 00:21:01.302
Of course, it is.

00:21:01.886 --> 00:21:03.804
Do you still want to be the navigator?

00:21:04.388 --> 00:21:08.684
I think it would be
more stupid of me to get out now.

00:21:08.768 --> 00:21:11.312
I might as well go all the way.

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:15.441
Have you heard of the "Concorde Fallacy"?

00:21:19.195 --> 00:21:20.112
MONICA: I have.

00:21:20.696 --> 00:21:24.742
It was thought of as a mistake,
because they couldn't get out of it

00:21:24.825 --> 00:21:27.620
from an economic standpoint.

00:21:28.287 --> 00:21:32.458
I imagine that the developers
of the Concorde were purely happy

00:21:33.459 --> 00:21:38.172
to see their aircraft keep flying
for many years.

00:21:39.423 --> 00:21:44.094
Well, I view this as a good experience
even without the humanitarian aspect.

00:21:44.678 --> 00:21:48.766
Colonel, you don't see her
as the Concorde, do you?

00:21:49.558 --> 00:21:51.602
(scoffs)
I guess not.

00:21:52.228 --> 00:21:57.274
COLONEL: They certainly are not
as elegant as passenger airliners.

00:22:00.152 --> 00:22:03.906
So, Empress, where are we heading?

00:22:04.782 --> 00:22:08.661
Our house, Light House Number Eight.

00:22:09.245 --> 00:22:12.164
We have to go there.
