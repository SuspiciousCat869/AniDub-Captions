WEBVTT

00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:06.298
(distant clanging)

00:00:10.636 --> 00:00:12.304
(explosions)

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:16.808
What are you?

00:00:16.892 --> 00:00:18.310
(yells)

00:00:20.229 --> 00:00:21.355
I'm Strength.

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:23.232
I clobber.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.112
STRENGTH: I grab and tear apart.

00:00:31.573 --> 00:00:32.407
I destroy.

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:34.993
(gasps)

00:00:39.581 --> 00:00:40.499
(groans)

00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:42.459
Go boom now!

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.714
Empty as I thought.

00:00:48.465 --> 00:00:50.175
(thuds)

00:00:53.804 --> 00:00:55.806
(action music)

00:00:57.683 --> 00:00:59.351
Why are you doing this?

00:01:01.937 --> 00:01:03.981
("ASEED" by ZAQ playing)

00:02:32.027 --> 00:02:34.029
(thrilling music)

00:02:38.617 --> 00:02:41.036
Oh! Is it because I just used it?

00:02:42.037 --> 00:02:42.954
(zapping)

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:45.457
(Strength grunts)

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:48.043
(Empress groans)

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:49.920
Take this!

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:50.962
(electricity crackles)

00:02:51.046 --> 00:02:52.464
(Black Trike shrieking)

00:02:52.547 --> 00:02:53.382
(clangs)

00:02:57.219 --> 00:02:58.387
Uh...

00:03:01.973 --> 00:03:06.269
BLACK TRIKE: <i>You are currently drained.</i>
<i>I recommend you retreat.</i>

00:03:06.353 --> 00:03:07.562
Uh...

00:03:07.646 --> 00:03:09.815
BLACK TRIKE: <i>It's Black Trike, Empress.</i>

00:03:09.898 --> 00:03:11.316
(gunshots)

00:03:11.775 --> 00:03:13.318
Pay attention!

00:03:13.402 --> 00:03:14.820
(bullets clanking)

00:03:16.154 --> 00:03:17.698
(gasps)

00:03:20.158 --> 00:03:22.369
(engine revving)

00:03:23.704 --> 00:03:24.788
(groans)

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:27.040
Tch.

00:03:27.541 --> 00:03:32.170
This pain, these fragments of memory...

00:03:35.507 --> 00:03:39.928
It's an awful feeling,
like drowning in my own vomit.

00:03:40.011 --> 00:03:41.179
My agony...

00:03:42.973 --> 00:03:45.892
is your fault, isn't it, Empress?

00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:50.272
STRENGTH: Black Rock Shooter!

00:03:54.151 --> 00:03:55.652
(giggles)

00:03:55.735 --> 00:03:57.112
I smell money.

00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:00.532
Mm.

00:04:00.615 --> 00:04:02.200
(engine revving)

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:12.294
Why did Strength attack you?

00:04:12.878 --> 00:04:16.590
EMPRESS: Strength, do you know her?

00:04:16.673 --> 00:04:20.302
COLONEL: She's in our records.
You used to be on the same side.

00:04:21.303 --> 00:04:22.679
On the same side?

00:04:23.472 --> 00:04:24.306
(sighs)

00:04:24.973 --> 00:04:27.768
COLONEL: Do I have to explain
from the beginning?

00:04:29.853 --> 00:04:31.855
(upbeat music)

00:04:39.654 --> 00:04:44.117
Project Elysion was
for large-scale automation of labor.

00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:47.662
COLONEL: <i>Artemis,</i>
<i>the core system for the project,</i>

00:04:47.746 --> 00:04:50.373
<i>chose war against the human race.</i>

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:54.586
(muffled explosion)

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:57.798
COLONEL: <i>Artemis and its Unmanned Forces</i>

00:04:57.881 --> 00:05:01.468
<i>are working hard to feed humans</i>
<i>to the Iron Ocean.</i>

00:05:02.344 --> 00:05:05.972
<i>That will produce a new Unmanned Forces.</i>

00:05:10.727 --> 00:05:11.937
Did you see that?

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.773
Batteries act as currency around here.

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:20.320
Large power stations will surely
be detected by the Unmanned Forces.

00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:24.032
Securing electricity is our lifeline.

00:05:24.115 --> 00:05:25.534
(sobs)

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.959
(approaching footsteps)

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:37.671
Hmm?

00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:44.219
You can take off your mask.

00:05:44.302 --> 00:05:47.556
This cave is treated
with Arche decontamination.

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:48.974
Hmm...

00:05:57.148 --> 00:06:02.737
Bartender, where's the nearest
Peacebuilding Force post?

00:06:03.321 --> 00:06:04.823
I don't know.

00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:07.784
Are there any wired network facilities
in this town?

00:06:07.868 --> 00:06:10.495
You think we have
something useful like that here?

00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:13.081
Well, I guess not.

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:21.798
The Hemiteos Unit was the secret weapon
of the Elysion Project.

00:06:22.299 --> 00:06:26.469
Its guardian angels,
human girls modified into weapons of war.

00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:30.473
COLONEL: The leader of the unit was given
the mission code name of Empress.

00:06:30.557 --> 00:06:33.727
Also known as Black Rock Shooter.

00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:36.229
That's who you are.

00:06:36.313 --> 00:06:39.149
Wow. I didn't know you were that amazing.

00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:41.026
That's so cool.

00:06:41.109 --> 00:06:42.277
(snickers)

00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:48.033
When Artemis
and its Unmanned Forces rose in revolt,

00:06:48.158 --> 00:06:52.120
the Hemiteos Unit still fought
on the side of the human race.

00:06:52.203 --> 00:06:57.542
They fought many battles, but in the end,
they lost and went missing.

00:06:58.084 --> 00:06:59.252
I...

00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:03.465
have to go to Lighthouse Number Eight.

00:07:04.174 --> 00:07:05.759
What is that?

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:07.469
I don't know.

00:07:07.552 --> 00:07:09.471
That doesn't make any sense.

00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:11.890
Can I say something?

00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:14.601
You stay quiet, or I'll kill you.

00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:18.063
NORITO: You're a professional killer,
aren't you?

00:07:18.146 --> 00:07:22.942
Killing is my profession and my hobby.
I live only for violence.

00:07:23.026 --> 00:07:25.737
I'll assault and kill anyone in my way.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.282
I'll even mess their dead corpses.
So don't mess with me.

00:07:29.366 --> 00:07:31.910
What does that mean?

00:07:31.993 --> 00:07:32.869
Uh...

00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:34.746
NORITO: You don't need to know.

00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:38.291
For now, we'll have
to forget about Strength.

00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:42.712
We'll go to a Peacebuilding Force post
and regroup.

00:07:42.837 --> 00:07:45.465
Then, you are going to save
the human race.

00:07:46.174 --> 00:07:48.218
Save the human race.

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:51.596
Lighthouse, whatever it was,
will have to wait until this is over.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.808
-We need to get a map or a guide--
-Huh?

00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:55.725
What?

00:07:56.351 --> 00:08:01.898
You like killing and messing with it.
That's wonderful, I totally respect you.

00:08:02.732 --> 00:08:04.484
You're not eligible.

00:08:04.567 --> 00:08:05.694
(whines)

00:08:05.777 --> 00:08:07.320
That's a bummer.

00:08:07.404 --> 00:08:08.238
(sighs)

00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:10.240
So, who are you?

00:08:10.824 --> 00:08:12.617
I can be your guide.

00:08:12.701 --> 00:08:14.035
What?

00:08:14.119 --> 00:08:18.164
There's a Peacebuilding Force base
200 kilometers west of here.

00:08:18.748 --> 00:08:23.002
Just knowing it's to the west
won't get you there.

00:08:24.212 --> 00:08:25.130
(thumps)

00:08:25.964 --> 00:08:28.383
But I know the exact location.

00:08:28.466 --> 00:08:31.177
Are you trying to tell me
that you're stupid?

00:08:31.302 --> 00:08:35.348
How many years do you think have passed
since GPS became unusable?

00:08:35.432 --> 00:08:38.309
I have a map system that doesn't use GPS.

00:08:38.393 --> 00:08:40.603
Abandoned portable base stations

00:08:40.687 --> 00:08:44.816
and Wi-Fi routers still give off
some kinds of signals.

00:08:45.316 --> 00:08:46.901
I pick up and collect them,

00:08:47.027 --> 00:08:51.072
and then do an image analysis
to study the terrain, which gives me...

00:08:51.656 --> 00:08:54.409
I get what you're saying.
So, what do you want in return?

00:08:54.492 --> 00:08:55.326
MONICA: Excuse me?

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:56.786
Don't play dumb.

00:08:56.911 --> 00:09:02.000
These days,
nobody is kind to others for nothing.

00:09:02.083 --> 00:09:04.544
What's your intention for joining us?

00:09:05.754 --> 00:09:06.755
(chuckles)

00:09:06.838 --> 00:09:08.882
I can't blame you for asking.

00:09:08.965 --> 00:09:11.801
What I'm interested in is this girl.

00:09:13.136 --> 00:09:17.557
She's great. She's so cute.
She makes me salivate.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:18.892
COLONEL: A pervert.

00:09:18.975 --> 00:09:21.311
Let me do a physical exam on her.

00:09:21.436 --> 00:09:22.979
A pervert, all right.

00:09:23.063 --> 00:09:25.607
No, I'm a researcher.

00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:30.779
I can't tell if she's an enhanced human
or an android yet,

00:09:30.945 --> 00:09:33.406
but she's clearly been augmented.

00:09:33.531 --> 00:09:38.495
Doesn't that mean you could use somebody
who is capable of doing maintenance?

00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:40.246
Maintenance?

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.373
Yeah, maintenance.

00:09:44.501 --> 00:09:48.713
The knowledge I can gain by working
on that amazing bike alone

00:09:49.339 --> 00:09:51.466
would be enough compensation for me.

00:09:52.217 --> 00:09:53.468
Hm...

00:09:53.551 --> 00:09:57.597
I knew it. You think I showed up
at just the right time, don't you?

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:01.851
You don't at all look like
the mechanically inclined type, soldier.

00:10:01.935 --> 00:10:03.103
What did you say?

00:10:03.186 --> 00:10:04.020
Hey.

00:10:04.104 --> 00:10:05.522
MONICA: I nailed it, didn't I?

00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:09.859
Oh, I haven't introduced myself yet.
My name is Monica Kaburagi.

00:10:09.943 --> 00:10:12.445
I'm one of the top five system engineers

00:10:12.529 --> 00:10:18.409
and hackers around this area,
or maybe even on earth.

00:10:18.493 --> 00:10:21.037
As a child, I was already
mechanically inclined...

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:23.498
-Hey!
-MIYA AND MONICA: What?

00:10:23.581 --> 00:10:26.584
Empress, I want to ask you
to do something for us.

00:10:27.544 --> 00:10:28.461
Huh?

00:10:31.673 --> 00:10:33.466
This is where we live.

00:10:37.345 --> 00:10:38.179
(Norito grunts)

00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:43.977
We have a lack of electricity,
a lack of fuel, lack of food,

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.396
and most of all, a lack of medicine.

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:48.439
(groaning)

00:10:49.274 --> 00:10:55.196
Antibiotics, saline, and clean syringes
would make a big difference.

00:11:00.535 --> 00:11:05.165
That's what we were looking for
when we met you.

00:11:05.248 --> 00:11:07.250
(light music)

00:11:08.001 --> 00:11:09.169
(gasps)

00:11:10.003 --> 00:11:12.422
What are you trying to say, kid?

00:11:13.464 --> 00:11:16.050
NORITO: There's an old hospital nearby.

00:11:16.634 --> 00:11:20.638
It's abandoned, but there
are lots of supplies left inside.

00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:22.932
Why don't you go there?

00:11:23.016 --> 00:11:24.017
We can't.

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:27.061
"Beehives" surround the hospital ruins.

00:11:27.145 --> 00:11:28.146
Oh.

00:11:29.439 --> 00:11:30.356
Bee?

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:34.360
Beehives. The common name
for the Swarm Division.

00:11:34.944 --> 00:11:39.449
COLONEL: It's the generic term
for drones that act collectively.

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:42.243
No capability to capture humans,

00:11:42.327 --> 00:11:45.246
so they concentrate on killing humans.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:47.498
At any rate, Empress,

00:11:47.624 --> 00:11:52.503
with your help, we should be able
to bring back the necessary supplies.

00:11:52.587 --> 00:11:54.756
I beg you to please help us!

00:11:54.839 --> 00:11:56.049
(groans)

00:11:56.591 --> 00:11:59.010
-(gasps)
-We don't have time!

00:11:59.093 --> 00:12:00.511
(grunts)

00:12:00.595 --> 00:12:01.804
(sighs)

00:12:03.848 --> 00:12:06.100
EMPRESS: Being told
by that short-tempered man

00:12:06.184 --> 00:12:10.230
to "save the human race"
didn't really convince me.

00:12:10.313 --> 00:12:11.356
Mm...

00:12:11.439 --> 00:12:12.774
Huh?

00:12:12.857 --> 00:12:14.901
But now, right here,

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:19.364
where I can reach out to them,
there are humans in need.

00:12:20.406 --> 00:12:23.409
I can't remember anything right now.

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:29.374
First of all, I want to remember
what kind of person I was.

00:12:30.166 --> 00:12:35.338
EMPRESS: I hope I wasn't someone
who would abandon those in need.

00:12:35.964 --> 00:12:37.715
I want to believe that.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.679
So I'll do it.

00:12:43.179 --> 00:12:45.181
(both sigh)

00:12:46.432 --> 00:12:48.434
(action music)

00:12:50.937 --> 00:12:56.109
If you're really one of the Hemiteos Unit,
you must replenish your ammunition here.

00:12:56.192 --> 00:12:57.402
I have a weapon.

00:12:57.485 --> 00:12:58.653
(clinks)

00:12:58.736 --> 00:13:02.156
That BB gun is beyond inadequate.

00:13:02.991 --> 00:13:04.242
Uh?

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:08.788
Coil Gun.

00:13:13.584 --> 00:13:17.755
The ammunition should be
refined inside your body.

00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:31.060
It's delicious.

00:13:33.771 --> 00:13:36.024
COLONEL: So that's the ruins
of the hospital.

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:41.988
There are beehives on both sides of it.
They're pretty big.

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:47.785
MONICA: Whoa. Those are huge.

00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:50.913
NORITO: They've grown
since I last saw them.

00:13:52.123 --> 00:13:53.541
We'll make it simple.

00:13:54.208 --> 00:13:59.464
Empress will attract the Swarm Division
and crush as many of them as possible.

00:14:00.256 --> 00:14:03.885
Meanwhile, we'll go in
and grab as many supplies as possible.

00:14:04.469 --> 00:14:09.182
The priorities are small generators,
batteries, and pharmaceuticals.

00:14:12.185 --> 00:14:15.646
I'm surprised you agreed to do this.

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:17.148
You looked like...

00:14:17.774 --> 00:14:20.526
How should I say it?

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:23.112
The cold and heartless type.

00:14:23.821 --> 00:14:25.490
I just want to see for myself,

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:29.035
to assess the power of Empress.

00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:31.287
If she's too powerful.

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:34.624
We probably can't make her do
what she doesn't want to.

00:14:35.541 --> 00:14:36.584
I'm going.

00:14:36.667 --> 00:14:39.796
(engine revving)

00:14:43.174 --> 00:14:46.427
If she dies here, then that's that.

00:14:47.345 --> 00:14:49.347
(ominous music)

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.317
BLACK TRIKE: <i>Here they come, Empress.</i>

00:15:15.665 --> 00:15:21.045
<i>Frick! Unexpected firepower, Empress!</i>
<i>This might be trouble.</i>

00:15:21.838 --> 00:15:23.297
I'll figure it out.

00:15:25.883 --> 00:15:30.555
I'll stay here and be on the lookout.
Hurry up and get your supplies.

00:15:30.638 --> 00:15:31.848
Right.

00:15:31.931 --> 00:15:34.725
I've never been good at physical labor.

00:15:34.809 --> 00:15:38.104
My involvement with this dangerous task

00:15:38.187 --> 00:15:41.607
should come with a promise
of additional compensation, I think--

00:15:41.691 --> 00:15:43.151
COLONEL: Step on it!

00:15:43.526 --> 00:15:44.694
Okay.

00:15:46.112 --> 00:15:48.114
(suspenseful music)

00:15:49.198 --> 00:15:50.158
(grunts)

00:15:50.658 --> 00:15:54.036
(weapon firing)

00:15:57.623 --> 00:16:00.001
BLACK TRIKE: <i>Empress, there's a new swarm.</i>

00:16:00.084 --> 00:16:01.169
(grunts)

00:16:02.086 --> 00:16:04.505
(Norito panting)

00:16:05.423 --> 00:16:06.465
Hurry, Miya.

00:16:07.049 --> 00:16:07.967
Yeah.

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:09.510
MONICA: Let's go.

00:16:11.053 --> 00:16:13.931

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:16.475

00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:19.729
Quickly!

00:16:19.812 --> 00:16:22.023
One more run.

00:16:22.106 --> 00:16:24.525
Don't get greedy.
It's important to know when to--

00:16:24.609 --> 00:16:25.526
(clangs)

00:16:26.861 --> 00:16:28.779
Darn. Get in.

00:16:28.863 --> 00:16:30.281

00:16:30.364 --> 00:16:31.532

00:16:32.867 --> 00:16:34.535
From behind, too!

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.997

-Don't be reckless.

00:16:43.544 --> 00:16:45.588
MONICA: Hold on tight, everybody!

00:16:51.052 --> 00:16:53.846
BLACK TRIKE: <i>Empress, the swarm</i>
<i>is all in one place.</i>

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:55.223
<i>This is your chance.</i>

(tires screech)

00:17:24.627 --> 00:17:26.003
NORITO: She got them.

00:17:26.087 --> 00:17:27.380
Awesome.

00:17:27.463 --> 00:17:29.507
It looks promising as I thought.

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:31.008
(warbles)

00:17:31.092 --> 00:17:32.510

00:17:34.595 --> 00:17:37.181
-What the hell!
-COLONEL: Don't!

00:17:40.226 --> 00:17:41.978
Darn! He fell! Stop!

00:17:42.061 --> 00:17:43.729

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:51.404
Shoot, this is too close.

00:17:53.948 --> 00:17:56.075
(zooming)

00:17:56.158 --> 00:17:57.034

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:05.626
Empress, above you!

00:18:06.544 --> 00:18:07.712
(blasts)

00:18:07.795 --> 00:18:09.005
(gasps)

00:18:12.466 --> 00:18:13.634
Empress!

-BLACK TRIKE: <i>I'll back you up.</i>

00:18:35.239 --> 00:18:36.240
Oh.

00:18:38.075 --> 00:18:39.744
You drive me crazy.

00:18:42.663 --> 00:18:45.791
Why do you force yourself to fight?

00:18:46.459 --> 00:18:47.501
Because I can.

00:18:47.585 --> 00:18:51.881
That's not what I mean!
What does this kid matter to you?

00:18:53.174 --> 00:18:55.843
His name isn't "kid."

00:18:57.094 --> 00:19:00.097
Every human being matters.

00:19:00.806 --> 00:19:01.682

00:19:02.933 --> 00:19:04.518
Whatever.

BLACK TRIKE: <i>It's been a long time.</i>
<i>How are you?</i>

00:19:45.518 --> 00:19:47.937
I'm depending on you to guide us there.

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:50.648
Got it. Of course, I will.

00:19:50.731 --> 00:19:52.566
We've already wasted some time.

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:56.445
It wasn't a waste.
We saw that she's the real thing.

00:19:56.612 --> 00:20:00.241
I've never seen a Swarm Division
being obliterated like that.

00:20:02.076 --> 00:20:06.205
That one named Strength
is making me curious, too.

00:20:06.288 --> 00:20:08.749
Speaking of curious...
