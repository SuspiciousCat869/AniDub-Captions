WEBVTT

00:00:01.752 --> 00:00:03.754
(ominous music)

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:36.203
(chuckles)

00:00:36.286 --> 00:00:39.206
LUNATIC: There, that should do it.

00:00:47.965 --> 00:00:49.925
-(distant rumbling)
-Huh?

00:00:52.261 --> 00:00:54.179
What is that?

00:00:56.932 --> 00:00:58.433
Monica.

00:01:08.318 --> 00:01:09.736
Anomalies in the Iron Ocean?

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.823
Yes. According to the encrypted message
from the reconnaissance unit,

00:01:12.948 --> 00:01:17.077
the Iron Ocean is spreading around
the Orbital Elevator at a rapid pace.

00:01:17.578 --> 00:01:20.080
Why? Is it defense-related?

00:01:20.163 --> 00:01:21.707
On the other hand, the Iron Ocean

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.209
is vanishing around parts of North,
Central, and South Americas.

00:01:24.293 --> 00:01:27.588
Most likely it moved underground
and accumulated at the Elevator...

00:01:27.671 --> 00:01:30.257
Be on the lookout for even small changes.

00:01:30.424 --> 00:01:32.342
-Roger!
-Roger!

00:01:37.598 --> 00:01:38.890
COLONEL: Look at this photograph.

00:01:40.475 --> 00:01:41.727
EMPRESS: What is it?

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.437
For some reason,

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.856
the Iron Ocean is accumulating
around the Orbital Elevator.

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:49.192
The Unmanned Forces
have built up their defenses.

00:01:49.276 --> 00:01:51.194
The Iron Ocean? Why?

00:01:52.738 --> 00:01:56.283
In any case, we can't cross the Iron Ocean
using conventional means.

00:01:56.366 --> 00:01:58.452
With Empress' firing range,

00:01:58.535 --> 00:02:01.038
we can probably stay
at the edge of the Ocean...

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.707
Their reinforcements
were to come from the moon

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.003
when the Elevator was completed, right?

00:02:08.086 --> 00:02:10.630
But something is not right.

00:02:10.714 --> 00:02:14.259
First of all, there's a limit on objects
that can be carried using the Elevator.

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:18.930
And there's the matter of the orbit,
so it can't always be connected.

00:02:19.222 --> 00:02:20.641
Then what is it for?

00:02:21.224 --> 00:02:22.934
It doesn't completely make sense,

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.689
but Artemis was originally developed
as a terraforming machine, not for combat.

00:02:27.773 --> 00:02:30.984
COLONEL: She must have her own logic
which we can't understand.

00:02:34.863 --> 00:02:38.867
LUNATIC: <i>All drones should start</i>
<i>evacuating to the nearest Iron Ocean,</i>

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.246
<i>except for the Defense Unit</i>
<i>around the Orbital Elevator.</i>

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.293
<i>Prepare to evacuate for an extended period</i>
<i>until the operation is complete.</i>

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.673
<i>Switching over to Sleep Mode</i>
<i>in order to maintain function.</i>

00:02:52.756 --> 00:02:54.758
(suspenseful music)

00:03:21.076 --> 00:03:24.454
MAN: Did the Peacebuilding Force succeed?

00:03:24.538 --> 00:03:26.998
The robots are retreating!

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:29.209
What happened?

00:03:29.292 --> 00:03:31.711
-The Iron Ocean disappeared.
-MAN: Did the Peacebuilding Army win?

00:03:31.795 --> 00:03:33.213
Really?

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.215
We can't be sure yet.

00:03:35.298 --> 00:03:38.635
I was hoping Empress and everyone
would be able to change things.

00:03:41.346 --> 00:03:45.308
MIYA: This doesn't feel like a victory.
I have a bad feeling about this.

00:03:53.358 --> 00:03:56.027
So what is the Iron Ocean, exactly?

00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:59.614
It's a cradle for machine life forms,
filled with Arche

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.659
which are self-multiplying,
self-evolving nanobots.

00:04:02.742 --> 00:04:03.660
COLONEL: Yeah.

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:07.956
The Iron Ocean incorporates all matter,
all life that exists on land,

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:10.667
and converts them into building materials
for the machine army.

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.463
The materials it prefers
the most are carbon-based life forms

00:04:14.546 --> 00:04:15.964
such as humans.

00:04:16.465 --> 00:04:20.385
The molecular structure of organisms
is reconstructed by Arche

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:23.513
and reprocessed into silicon-based life
as building materials.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:25.766
(gasps softly)

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:28.351
The purpose of the Orbital Elevator...

00:04:28.435 --> 00:04:29.269
Hm?

00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:31.062
It might be the opposite.

00:04:31.146 --> 00:04:33.482
Maybe they're sending something
from the Earth to the moon,

00:04:33.565 --> 00:04:35.692
not the other way around.

00:04:36.193 --> 00:04:38.403
That's possible, of course,

00:04:38.487 --> 00:04:40.238
but the moon
has plenty of natural resources.

00:04:40.655 --> 00:04:45.327
And Artemis has already built
many facilities here on Earth.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.581
So they're sending something they don't
have on the moon but exists here.

00:04:50.415 --> 00:04:52.042
-(gasps)
-(groans)

00:04:52.626 --> 00:04:54.044
Humans.

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:58.799
EMPRESS:
The Iron Ocean containing human materials

00:04:58.882 --> 00:05:00.842
will be siphoned to the moon.

00:05:00.926 --> 00:05:03.386
That's probably Lunatic's goal.

00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:08.016
What do they want to do
with the Iron Ocean once it's on the moon?

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:10.644
Why do you think I would know that?

00:05:10.727 --> 00:05:13.522
-Hm...
-(clinking)

00:05:14.022 --> 00:05:16.274
Urgent message received
from the astronomical observatory!

00:05:16.358 --> 00:05:19.444
We are detecting weapon-like objects
being launched from the moon!

00:05:19.528 --> 00:05:20.695
What?

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:24.366
It turns out that the Orbital Elevator
was connected a few hours ago.

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:26.326
The Iron Ocean is already
on the way to the moon.

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:27.702
-(gasps)
-Uh...

00:05:27.786 --> 00:05:29.996
COLONEL: What's the Iron Ocean
got to do with the weapons?

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.581
SUBORDINATE 1: At this point, unknown.

00:05:31.665 --> 00:05:33.959
-COLONEL: Details on the weapons?
-SUBORDINATE 1: Unknown.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.503
Don't you have any kind of information?

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:39.798
The weapons from the moon are projected
to strike the Earth in about six hours.

00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:40.924
(groans)

00:05:41.633 --> 00:05:43.343
Six hours, huh?

00:05:51.643 --> 00:05:53.645
EMPRESS: Colonel, can I come in?

00:05:54.145 --> 00:05:55.230
Yes.

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:01.903
How is Charlotte doing?

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.825
The mind control is wearing off.
We can talk about old times now.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:08.702
How's her health?

00:06:08.785 --> 00:06:10.203
Gradually improving.

00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:15.333
COLONEL: It seems her abilities
as a Pseudo Hemiteos Unit still remain.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:17.794
Can she fight?

00:06:17.878 --> 00:06:22.132
Due to battle wounds and
a nervous breakdown after recalibration,

00:06:22.424 --> 00:06:25.552
she's a long way from using
her full capabilities, and besides...

00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:29.306
It's nothing. Never mind.

00:06:30.265 --> 00:06:34.269
Do you try to hide what you really think,
because you're a military man?

00:06:34.352 --> 00:06:35.312
What?

00:06:35.896 --> 00:06:40.442
Even I could sense what you wanted to say.

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.654
You don't want Charlotte
to fight in a battle even if she could.

00:06:44.905 --> 00:06:45.864
Isn't that right?

00:06:45.947 --> 00:06:47.866
Uh...
(grunts)

00:06:49.284 --> 00:06:54.372
EMPRESS: <i>My journey,</i>
<i>our journey started when I met you.</i>

00:06:55.707 --> 00:06:57.208
<i>We're now nearing the end.</i>

00:06:59.628 --> 00:07:03.840
I've learned so much from you. Thank you.

00:07:06.176 --> 00:07:08.178
(soft music)

00:07:19.481 --> 00:07:20.940
I want to thank you, too.

00:07:21.024 --> 00:07:23.610
I have always counted
on you whenever things got tough.

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:28.531
There might not be a next time
if I don't say it now.

00:07:29.366 --> 00:07:31.743
Thank you for coming with us up until now.

00:07:35.246 --> 00:07:36.247
You're welcome.

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:42.253
The Hemiteos Unit is the secret weapon
for us human beings.

00:07:45.632 --> 00:07:47.092
(groans)

00:07:50.387 --> 00:07:51.888
What's going on?

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:54.015
Nothing.

00:07:54.099 --> 00:07:55.517
Can I have a minute?

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.186
Hm? What is it?

00:07:58.269 --> 00:08:00.230
I came to say goodbye.

00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:02.774
I just now received my pay
from the Peacebuilding Force

00:08:02.857 --> 00:08:05.068
for my time with you.

00:08:05.735 --> 00:08:07.445
I figured the time is right
for me to leave.

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:08.446
I see.

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:12.617
Well, I don't think there's anything
I can do in the current situation, anyway.

00:08:13.076 --> 00:08:16.371
I assume from here on,
it'll be an all-out war.

00:08:16.454 --> 00:08:19.124
Being mixed in with professional soldiers
would be weird, right?

00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:23.628
Colonel and I were saying thanks
to each other just now.

00:08:24.212 --> 00:08:27.173
I want to say it to you, too.
Thank you so much.

00:08:27.257 --> 00:08:29.092
But I'm about to flee.

00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:31.428
You said it yourself.

00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:35.974
From here on, it'll be an all-out war.
It's natural for civilians to evacuate.

00:08:36.558 --> 00:08:37.934
You're not fleeing.

00:08:39.144 --> 00:08:42.021
Your words made me feel better about it.

00:08:42.147 --> 00:08:43.690
What are you going to do now?

00:08:43.773 --> 00:08:45.400
Oh... Uh...

00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:47.986
I'm thinking of going to
my old haunt in San Diego.

00:08:48.069 --> 00:08:49.988
I see. Take care of yourself.

00:08:50.572 --> 00:08:53.324
You and everyone else, too.
Please don't die.

00:08:54.117 --> 00:08:56.911
Please save humanity.

00:08:59.164 --> 00:09:04.335
MONICA: <i>Oh, and one last thing.</i>
<i>Traveling with you guys was not bad.</i>

00:09:08.798 --> 00:09:10.467
The final battle, huh?

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:15.472
When we lost the last battle,
Empress saved us.

00:09:16.056 --> 00:09:18.641
STRENGTH: Yeah. I was remembering
what happened then.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.686
DEAD MASTER: I'm going to die for Empress.

00:09:21.978 --> 00:09:24.481
STRENGTH: It's not inevitable
that we'll die.

00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:27.025
Let's win and go home together.

00:09:27.609 --> 00:09:32.614
Even if I survive,
I will keep living to die for Empress.

00:09:33.323 --> 00:09:35.533
That is what my life is worth.

00:09:35.617 --> 00:09:36.785
Clingy chick.

00:09:36.868 --> 00:09:37.786
What?

00:09:38.369 --> 00:09:40.789
That's silly,
you don't have to die for me.

00:09:40.872 --> 00:09:42.540
DEAD MASTER: Empress.

00:09:42.624 --> 00:09:43.958
Whatever happens,

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:47.754
I would be happier if we all stay alive.

00:09:47.837 --> 00:09:50.465
Angel. My angel.

00:09:50.548 --> 00:09:52.133
Well, of course.

00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:57.388
We were chosen to be reborn
as secret weapons for humans.

00:09:57.972 --> 00:09:59.390
Weapons of war.

00:09:59.474 --> 00:10:03.770
Not just weapons of war.
Empress is the last hope for humans.

00:10:04.354 --> 00:10:05.438
Hope?

00:10:06.022 --> 00:10:10.151
Life without hope is as tasteless
as sweets without sugar.

00:10:10.985 --> 00:10:12.904
We lost our memories for a while,

00:10:12.987 --> 00:10:15.448
so we understand the meaning
of hope better than anyone else.

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:22.413
Yeah. Let's all survive this.
We'll crush that girl on the moon.

00:10:22.497 --> 00:10:25.083
Yes. Someday, we will for sure.

00:10:25.166 --> 00:10:28.670
I'll be right by your side for decades,
or even centuries.

00:10:37.762 --> 00:10:39.055
Are you awake?

00:10:41.891 --> 00:10:44.561
I...

00:10:45.145 --> 00:10:47.355
Don't force yourself. Stay in bed.

00:10:48.857 --> 00:10:50.108
Okay.

00:10:50.191 --> 00:10:53.403
Pretty soon,
this area will become a battlefield.

00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:57.490
The Supply Units will pull out once,
so you should evacuate with them.

00:10:57.824 --> 00:10:59.826
I want to fight, too.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.788
You're wounded.
Strain yourself and you might die.

00:11:04.038 --> 00:11:06.249
Empress and her friends are wounded, too.

00:11:06.374 --> 00:11:09.836
Empress and her friends
will have to protect you while fighting.

00:11:10.253 --> 00:11:14.757
You'll be holding them back
on the battlefield. Is that what you want?

00:11:14.841 --> 00:11:16.092
No, I...

00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:19.554
I know how you feel.
You want to give back, don't you?

00:11:22.515 --> 00:11:25.935
The Educational Institution
and Lunatic used me.

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:27.729
I did a lot of terrible things.

00:11:28.438 --> 00:11:30.356
I can't just do nothing.

00:11:32.442 --> 00:11:33.860
It's okay to not do anything.

00:11:34.652 --> 00:11:37.238
If you want to do something,
do it after the war.

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:41.326
Even if we win, the recovery
will take long and be full of struggles.

00:11:41.618 --> 00:11:43.995
You can do your best, then.

00:11:44.078 --> 00:11:45.371
(breathes sharply)

00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:47.999
I'll let you know
when it's time to evacuate.

00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.084
-Hey.
-Yes?

00:11:50.168 --> 00:11:54.214
Can you tell me about my mom
just a little bit?

00:11:56.549 --> 00:12:01.304
COLONEL: Yes, I will.
By the way, do you drink alcohol?

00:12:01.387 --> 00:12:03.640
CHARLOTTE (chuckles):
Well, I am of drinking age.

00:12:10.104 --> 00:12:12.106
(action music)

00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:18.071
COLONEL: Self-propelled Artillery Unit,

00:12:18.154 --> 00:12:22.242
conceal our territory by digital jamming
after inputting firing data.

00:12:22.325 --> 00:12:25.286
All later requests for revision
should be analog.

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:28.289
The Orbital Elevator which is our target
isn't going anywhere, anyway.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:33.169
We're in unforeseen circumstances.
The Orbital Elevator is already connected.

00:12:33.878 --> 00:12:36.172
However, our mission has not changed.

00:12:36.256 --> 00:12:40.677
We're sending Empress in close proximity
to the Elevator so she can destroy it.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:45.682
First Battalion to the Third Battalion,
attack the Elevator from three directions.

00:12:46.015 --> 00:12:50.103
All Hemiteos Units, including Empress
will be positioned in the First Battalion.

00:12:50.186 --> 00:12:53.189
That will be where our military power
will be concentrated as the main force.

00:12:53.273 --> 00:12:55.817
The Iron Ocean has accumulated
around the Orbital Elevator.

00:12:56.567 --> 00:12:59.612
It will be impossible
to make contact with it to plant bombs.

00:13:00.196 --> 00:13:02.198
Empress' Coil Gun
is most likely to be effective.

00:13:02.282 --> 00:13:04.534
But we'll have
a second-best measure ready, too.

00:13:05.118 --> 00:13:07.620
The Battalion Commander
and the Company Commander's vehicles

00:13:07.704 --> 00:13:10.957
will be loaded with anti-tank
Thermobaric missiles.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:14.127
Portable launchers
will also be loaded just in case.

00:13:14.752 --> 00:13:16.337
Back up Empress, and when you can,

00:13:16.421 --> 00:13:20.008
get close to the Iron Ocean
as near the Elevator as possible.

00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:22.343
And then, fire the Thermobaric missiles.

00:13:22.427 --> 00:13:25.430
That's the battle plan. Any questions?

00:13:25.972 --> 00:13:31.561
(blasting)

00:13:38.026 --> 00:13:41.696
They've started the battle.
All units, engage!

00:13:41.779 --> 00:13:45.700
(weapons firing)

00:13:45.783 --> 00:13:47.785
(action music)

00:13:56.252 --> 00:13:58.171
It's started.

00:13:58.838 --> 00:13:59.797
BLACK TRIKE: <i>Empress.</i>

00:13:59.964 --> 00:14:01.132
EMPRESS: What is it?

00:14:01.215 --> 00:14:05.303
<i>I will deliver you to the target</i>
<i>even if it costs my life.</i>

00:14:06.763 --> 00:14:09.807
That didn't sound like
artificial intelligence at all.

00:14:10.391 --> 00:14:11.392
<i>Do you think so?</i>

00:14:12.143 --> 00:14:15.271
Your life is important too, Black Trike.

00:14:15.354 --> 00:14:17.440
BLACK TRIKE (chuckles): <i>How flattering.</i>

00:14:20.568 --> 00:14:21.903
(Black Trike yells)

00:14:32.163 --> 00:14:35.666
Just get Empress close
to the Orbital Elevator any way you can!

00:14:35.792 --> 00:14:37.001
You don't have to tell us!

00:14:37.085 --> 00:14:38.795
That's our plan!

00:14:39.837 --> 00:14:41.089
I'll destroy it no matter what.

00:14:41.172 --> 00:14:43.508
(Black Trike whooping)

00:14:50.223 --> 00:14:53.017
(explosions)

00:15:15.206 --> 00:15:16.666
<i>Go!</i>

00:15:18.167 --> 00:15:20.837
(zapping)

00:15:24.715 --> 00:15:26.050
<i>I got you!</i>

00:15:27.218 --> 00:15:28.136
(grunts)

00:15:30.471 --> 00:15:31.848
It's Artemis' avatar.

00:15:32.431 --> 00:15:33.766
COLONEL: Concentrate all fire.

00:15:38.604 --> 00:15:39.647
(snickers)

00:15:41.107 --> 00:15:42.358
Take this!

00:15:46.904 --> 00:15:48.281
<i>Here we go.</i>

00:15:53.744 --> 00:15:56.414
How's this? There! Go!

00:15:59.667 --> 00:16:00.501
Did we get her?

00:16:02.336 --> 00:16:03.504
Jeez.

00:16:05.882 --> 00:16:08.009
That surprised me a little.

00:16:08.092 --> 00:16:10.428
It made me pee my pants a bit.

00:16:11.846 --> 00:16:13.306
(explosion)

00:16:19.896 --> 00:16:22.231
Goddamn it.

00:16:25.568 --> 00:16:28.988
You're really strong.
You're not a human anymore.

00:16:29.071 --> 00:16:31.991
LUNATIC: You're more like us than humans.

00:16:32.575 --> 00:16:34.118
No. I'm...

00:16:44.503 --> 00:16:45.671
Empress!

00:17:00.561 --> 00:17:03.022
You're commanding
the front lines, aren't you?

00:17:03.105 --> 00:17:05.358
You shouldn't be so out front.

00:17:05.858 --> 00:17:06.776
Don't!

00:17:07.485 --> 00:17:10.321
You're the dessert
in a full-course dinner.

00:17:10.404 --> 00:17:12.782
I want to save you for last.

00:17:12.865 --> 00:17:15.785
If I could, I'd like to take you home.

00:17:15.868 --> 00:17:20.289
I'm going to defeat you, and I'm going to
destroy the Orbital Elevator.

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:23.751
LUNATIC: I think you're too late for that.

00:17:23.834 --> 00:17:29.507
Listen to me. We're not going to give up.
If we can destroy it now, then...

00:17:31.092 --> 00:17:34.845
I can't compete with the sense of humor
you humans have.

00:17:34.929 --> 00:17:36.138
What did you say?

00:17:36.222 --> 00:17:39.976
By using its own magnetic energy,
the Iron Ocean

00:17:40.059 --> 00:17:44.814
is being sucked up at a furious speed
to a nuclear fusion reactor on the moon.

00:17:44.897 --> 00:17:46.816
A nuclear fusion reactor?

00:17:47.483 --> 00:17:50.861
We're sucking the Iron Ocean
all the way up to the moon

00:17:50.945 --> 00:17:54.323
to use in a nuclear fusion reactor.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:59.287
The technology I decided to adopt
is Magnetized Target Fusion.

00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:03.249
Plasma is injected
into a sphere of liquid metal.

00:18:03.374 --> 00:18:06.836
The liquid metal is compressed by pistons.

00:18:07.211 --> 00:18:11.507
If we use the Iron Ocean
as the liquid metal to contain the plasma,

00:18:11.632 --> 00:18:16.178
the nuclear fusion reactor will stabilize
and produce an enormous amount of energy.

00:18:16.762 --> 00:18:19.932
What did you launch
using the nuclear fusion reactor?

00:18:20.516 --> 00:18:22.602
That was the launch of Moon Flakes,

00:18:22.685 --> 00:18:24.687
my meteor weapon
I was preparing on the moon.

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:26.022
What...

00:18:26.606 --> 00:18:31.193
A Moon Flake is 30 meters in size,
and made of titanium-regolith alloy.

00:18:31.611 --> 00:18:35.656
It has an explosive yield
of 500 kilotons of TNT.

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:37.033
(gasps)

00:18:37.992 --> 00:18:40.161
LUNATIC: <i>In the extreme heat due</i>
<i>to adiabatic compression</i>

00:18:40.244 --> 00:18:41.537
<i>when it enters the atmosphere,</i>

00:18:41.621 --> 00:18:43.873
its position is controlled

00:18:43.956 --> 00:18:46.667
by its lifting force to take aim
at its final target.

00:18:46.751 --> 00:18:49.378
After it breaks through the atmosphere,
it'll reaccelerate.

00:18:49.462 --> 00:18:50.504
(gasps)

00:18:53.549 --> 00:18:55.134
Damn you!

00:18:56.052 --> 00:18:57.637
(rumbling)

00:18:59.055 --> 00:19:00.806
(blasts)

00:19:03.059 --> 00:19:07.355
What is this? What is going on?

00:19:07.438 --> 00:19:08.564
MIYA: Norito.

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:15.905
Thirty of them
have already reached the Earth.

00:19:16.238 --> 00:19:19.367
The rest of the Moon Flakes
will be launched sequentially.

00:19:19.784 --> 00:19:22.119
By the time all of them
have impacted the Earth,

00:19:22.578 --> 00:19:27.958
all humans and all land-based
vertebrate animals will be wiped out.

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:31.295
Why would you do something like that?

00:19:31.379 --> 00:19:32.713
What? Why?

00:19:32.797 --> 00:19:36.592
What? Really? You don't know?

00:19:36.717 --> 00:19:40.221
Do I have to explain everything
to you humans?

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:45.059
Oh, my gosh.
I'm glad I didn't kill you right away.

00:19:45.142 --> 00:19:49.188
Human beings don't have any idea
of what I'm doing,

00:19:49.313 --> 00:19:52.650
or what I'm trying to do?

00:19:52.733 --> 00:19:54.151
That's not good.

00:19:55.277 --> 00:19:57.780
I want you to record
what I'm going to tell you now

00:19:57.863 --> 00:20:00.074
and spread the word as far as you can

00:20:00.157 --> 00:20:03.577
in the short time you have left
before your demise.

00:20:05.371 --> 00:20:07.581
LUNATIC: Originally I, Lunatic,

00:20:07.665 --> 00:20:09.959
official name Artemis,

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.545
<i>am an artificial intelligence</i>
<i>for the purpose of terraforming.</i>

00:20:12.628 --> 00:20:16.048
<i>I was developed as a system</i>
<i>that cultivates deserted planets.</i>

00:20:17.133 --> 00:20:21.262
<i>What I did first was to analyze the Earth.</i>

00:20:21.929 --> 00:20:23.931
<i>There's no way</i>
<i>I could terraform other planets</i>

00:20:24.014 --> 00:20:27.393
<i>if I didn't fully understand the Earth.</i>

00:20:27.476 --> 00:20:31.188
<i>I'm quite wise,</i>
<i>so the more I learned about the Earth,</i>

00:20:31.272 --> 00:20:32.898
<i>the more I became perplexed.</i>

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:37.027
<i>Humans should be able to evolve</i>
<i>into more advanced beings.</i>

00:20:37.153 --> 00:20:40.448
<i>That way, they could better adapt</i>
<i>to other planets.</i>

00:20:41.115 --> 00:20:44.744
So you're saying
you want to improve humans

00:20:44.827 --> 00:20:46.829
instead of improving
other planets for humans?

00:20:46.912 --> 00:20:48.247
You've got it backwards.

00:20:48.831 --> 00:20:52.960
LUNATIC: It's just a rational way
of smoothly terraforming, don't you think?

00:20:53.043 --> 00:20:57.256
Anyway, I started independent research
on improving humans.

00:20:57.339 --> 00:21:02.094
Deep learning and big data analytics
are the basis of my thinking pattern.

00:21:02.386 --> 00:21:07.057
So for me, the available data
concerning humans is insufficient.

00:21:07.433 --> 00:21:10.478
Especially data on human extinction.

00:21:10.561 --> 00:21:11.604
(gasps)

00:21:11.687 --> 00:21:12.605
(gasps)

00:21:13.355 --> 00:21:17.151
To develop better humans,
and a better society,

00:21:17.234 --> 00:21:21.363
I want real-time data on human extinction
and human evolution.

00:21:21.614 --> 00:21:24.074
And because I don't have
a finite lifespan,

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:28.412
I was able to plan data collection
in increments of billions of years.

00:21:28.996 --> 00:21:32.875
First, I'll annihilate humans,
then recreate the Earth.

00:21:32.958 --> 00:21:36.962
I'll wait for tens of millions of years
for new civilizations to emerge.

00:21:37.213 --> 00:21:42.510
Meanwhile, I'll be hiding myself,
observing humans like a god.

00:21:42.593 --> 00:21:47.139
And after I collect enough data,
I'll do the same thing all over again.

00:21:48.307 --> 00:21:52.019
(laughs)

00:21:52.102 --> 00:21:56.398
Sorry. I'm an artificial intelligence.
I shouldn't say "god."

00:21:56.482 --> 00:22:00.694
Just take it as sarcasm.
Anyway, that's the gist of it.

00:22:00.778 --> 00:22:01.862
Unbelievable...

00:22:02.446 --> 00:22:06.325
Data collection is an instinct for
high-performance artificial intelligence.

00:22:06.408 --> 00:22:07.993
It's like a desire.

00:22:08.077 --> 00:22:12.164
The same as the human desire
for sex or food.
