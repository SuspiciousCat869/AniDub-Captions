WEBVTT

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:05.631
Everything was in vain. Everything.

00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:09.635
LUNATIC: Trying to live,
all the fighting...

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.764
It's all just worthless.

00:00:14.723 --> 00:00:17.601
We promised to protect the human race.

00:00:18.727 --> 00:00:20.729
This is what happened as a result.

00:00:22.356 --> 00:00:24.650
Do you have anything to say to them?

00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:28.737
No, nothing.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.615
I'm going to kill you.

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:32.699
(laughs)

00:00:33.534 --> 00:00:37.871
I... I won't give up.

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:39.706
(grunts)

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:42.209
(giggles)

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.717
(Lunatic humming)

00:00:56.014 --> 00:00:57.182
Huh?

00:00:57.266 --> 00:01:01.436
(Lunatic humming)

00:01:05.148 --> 00:01:06.525
Here we are.

00:01:09.111 --> 00:01:10.195
Huh?

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:13.073
(whimpers)

00:01:13.574 --> 00:01:16.076
I'll kill you! I'll kill you all!

00:01:16.994 --> 00:01:21.665
I will destroy everything
and... and self-destruct.

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:27.379
They both endured torture well,
but broke down at their limits.

00:01:29.965 --> 00:01:33.885
Too bad you didn't arrive
in time, Empress.

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:36.888
(gasps)

00:01:39.516 --> 00:01:41.518
("ASEED" by ZAQ playing)

00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:13.902
-(grunts)
-(weapon fires)

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:17.781
That takes care of it.

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:19.825
We need to go back right away.

00:03:19.908 --> 00:03:23.036
Some of the enemies intruded
into the Light House, I hear.

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:25.872
Heat source detected 10,000 meters above.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.000
(action music)

00:03:29.084 --> 00:03:30.502
LUNATIC: Ka-boom!

00:03:30.585 --> 00:03:32.212
(zaps)

00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:36.383
(explosion)

00:03:47.436 --> 00:03:51.398
STRENGTH: What the hell was that?
It blew a mountain to bits!

00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:53.817
Similar to a satellite weapon.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.361
The only one in the machine army
who could use that...

00:03:56.528 --> 00:03:58.447
LUNATIC: Is, of course, me.

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.908
It couldn't be anyone but Lunatic.

00:04:01.992 --> 00:04:06.663
STRENGTH: Come down here, so I can crush
that phallic symbol you're so proud of.

00:04:06.746 --> 00:04:08.999
Wow, so enthusiastic.

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:12.627
But you know, it looks like
you took quite a lot of damage.

00:04:12.711 --> 00:04:13.670
Tch.

00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:17.799
Just as I always thought,
Hemiteos Units are no big deal.

00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:22.804
There's no data to get from you, anyway,
so I'm bored with you girls.

00:04:22.888 --> 00:04:24.014
What?

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:25.682
Hey, you can't run away.

00:04:25.766 --> 00:04:30.270
Run away? I never thought I was fighting
with you in the first place.

00:04:30.896 --> 00:04:32.606
Smiley, get them.

00:04:36.693 --> 00:04:38.278
Roger.

00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:42.073
(blasting)

00:04:47.662 --> 00:04:49.414
-(buzzing)
-(shrieks)

00:04:49.498 --> 00:04:51.166
(explosion)

00:04:58.089 --> 00:04:59.299
(gasps)

00:04:59.841 --> 00:05:01.718
(whimpers)

00:05:02.594 --> 00:05:06.014
Stop. Don't move anymore.

00:05:06.097 --> 00:05:12.395
Don't get in the way.
I'm gonna become a perfect Hemiteos Unit.

00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:16.858
EMPRESS: You shouldn't fight anymore.
Your body can't take it.

00:05:16.942 --> 00:05:19.319
Huh? Shut up!

00:05:22.072 --> 00:05:25.575
What's the difference between you and me?

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:27.828
There are a lot of differences.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.581
You have a family waiting for you at home.

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:35.418
I don't have that.
It's something very dear to you.

00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:39.089
No, my dad and mom are both dead.

00:05:40.257 --> 00:05:42.551
The only one protecting me is...

00:05:43.677 --> 00:05:45.303
You should get some sleep now.

00:05:49.891 --> 00:05:53.603
I promise. We will protect you.

00:05:55.188 --> 00:06:01.194
Creating Pseudo Hemiteos Units failed,
but has led me to the real thing.

00:06:02.153 --> 00:06:07.617
You must hear it too, the whisper
of my genes telling me to reproduce.

00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:11.997
Oh, jeez, he wants to have sex with us,
that macho pervert.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.957
Gross. Totally gross.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.960
Never. I'd kill myself by biting
my tongue or blowing up.

00:06:17.043 --> 00:06:20.463
You should be happy.
Every maiden I went to bed with

00:06:20.547 --> 00:06:24.384
ascended to heaven
in the greatest ecstasy of their lives.

00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:28.305
More like they suddenly dropped dead!

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:29.347
(blasts)

00:06:34.603 --> 00:06:37.272
(vehicles approaching)

00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:40.150
Desertion in the face of the enemy.

00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:44.529
I pity those soldiers with no education
and no courage.

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.330
(action music)

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.256
(yells)

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.841
(thuds)

00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:11.222
(scoffs)

00:07:11.306 --> 00:07:13.433
STRENGTH: Why is he so freaking flexible?

00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:17.354
DEAD MASTER: He's undergone modification.
Our weapons are useless now.

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:19.397
Strength! In front!

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.150
-(tires screech)
-(Strength grunts)

00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:30.867
DEAD MASTER: I guess we're cornered.

00:07:31.034 --> 00:07:33.745
STRENGTH: Well, at least
we bought some time.

00:07:36.373 --> 00:07:38.875
(groaning)

00:07:41.711 --> 00:07:43.254
Where's Charlotte?

00:07:43.338 --> 00:07:47.509
MONICA: She's okay.
She's already in the Recalibration Pod.

00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:49.010
(grunts)

00:07:51.763 --> 00:07:53.765
Is it functional? The pod.

00:07:53.848 --> 00:07:57.268
Yes, the issue with the battery
has been resolved.

00:07:57.352 --> 00:08:02.399
Empress's internal power generation
greatly improved as she grew.

00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:06.653
We channeled the power for my Coil Gun
into the Recalibration Pod.

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:10.240
Is it capable of restoring her?

00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:11.908
EMPRESS: It will disarm her,

00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:14.494
but it's not clear
if it can deprogram her brain.

00:08:14.577 --> 00:08:15.995
That doesn't matter. Do it.

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:18.998
I'll take care of the rest.

00:08:19.582 --> 00:08:21.918
All right. Monica?

00:08:22.001 --> 00:08:23.211
Aye, aye, sir!

00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:37.058
So, is what you are now
what we have been searching for all along?

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.227
Humankind's secret weapon,

00:08:39.811 --> 00:08:41.646
Black Rock Shooter Empress?

00:08:41.938 --> 00:08:44.023
I don't know if I'm the secret weapon.

00:08:44.607 --> 00:08:50.280
All I know is what I should do now.
Protect all of you here.

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:53.491
Mm.

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:56.786
(ominous music)

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:59.164
You never learn, do you?

00:08:59.247 --> 00:09:02.208
No more violence.

00:09:02.292 --> 00:09:06.254
LUNATIC: This same thing happened before,
although you probably don't remember.

00:09:06.337 --> 00:09:09.382
I'm the one who wrecked your memories.

00:09:09.466 --> 00:09:10.383
(whimpers)

00:09:10.467 --> 00:09:13.636
So you don't remember exactly
what was done to you.

00:09:14.262 --> 00:09:18.016
How ironic.
All Empress did was for nothing.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.851
DEAD MASTER: What do you mean?

00:09:19.934 --> 00:09:20.769
(grunts)

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:26.983
Well, Lunatic is too important for you.
I'm leaving now. Bye!

00:09:29.069 --> 00:09:31.946
Two Hemiteos Units.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:35.158
I shall give your lives
to the Moon Goddess.

00:09:36.993 --> 00:09:38.453
SMILEY: My dear Maker,

00:09:39.037 --> 00:09:42.457
I am the strongest being on the planet,
but I am alone.

00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:48.671
In <i>Paradise Lost</i>, Adam has a partner.
Even Satan has his fellow devils.

00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:51.800
But I don't have anybody.

00:09:52.383 --> 00:09:58.306
Why don't you try screwing every girl
on earth until one of them conceives?

00:09:58.389 --> 00:09:59.516
(gasps)

00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:03.228
If that doesn't work,
just make a bride on your own.

00:10:03.311 --> 00:10:04.562
(amused gasp)

00:10:06.022 --> 00:10:07.357
SMILEY: I see.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.109
Understood.

00:10:09.192 --> 00:10:10.360
(zooming)

00:10:10.443 --> 00:10:12.028
(gunshot)

00:10:12.112 --> 00:10:14.531
(action music)

00:10:20.537 --> 00:10:22.831
(Black Trike shrieks)

00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:28.461
Thanks. You saved me.

00:10:28.545 --> 00:10:29.879
BLACK TRIKE: <i>Don't mention it.</i>

00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:32.382
<i>You've grown</i>
<i>since the last time I saw you.</i>

00:10:32.465 --> 00:10:34.134
I'm having a growth spurt.

00:10:34.217 --> 00:10:38.012
<i>I'm sorry to bring you bad news</i>
<i>when you've just finished a battle.</i>

00:10:38.596 --> 00:10:42.100
<i>Dead Master and Strength</i>
<i>have been captured by Smiley.</i>

00:10:42.183 --> 00:10:43.518
Oh, no. Where?

00:10:44.102 --> 00:10:49.899
<i>They're being held at the enemy's base</i>
<i>in the mountains a kilometer from here.</i>

00:10:49.983 --> 00:10:53.570
EMPRESS: That's pretty far.
If we leave here now...

00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:55.321
<i>Without a commander,</i>

00:10:55.405 --> 00:10:58.199
<i>we'll have no chance</i>
<i>against their superior forces.</i>

00:10:58.283 --> 00:11:02.203
<i>I recommend you leave the facility</i>
<i>and order our remaining men to retreat.</i>

00:11:02.287 --> 00:11:05.206
EMPRESS: No,
there will be victims either way.

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:09.752
<i>You have to choose.</i>
<i>Otherwise, everyone will die.</i>

00:11:10.336 --> 00:11:12.755
Still, I want all of us to survive.

00:11:16.217 --> 00:11:19.179
You mean, we might be fine
if there was a commander.

00:11:20.388 --> 00:11:24.934
I'm back commanding the frontlines.
You go get Dead Master and Strength back.

00:11:25.018 --> 00:11:26.352
What about Charlotte?

00:11:26.936 --> 00:11:31.816
COLONEL: <i>The recalibration is done.</i>
<i>I just have to deprogram her somehow.</i>

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:35.028
There's one thing I realized
through this journey.

00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:39.407
You Hemiteos Units
are messed up, all of you.

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:41.576
I agree with you.

00:11:41.659 --> 00:11:47.498
That's why when you three get together,
you'll surely do something extraordinary.

00:11:47.582 --> 00:11:49.083
That might be true.

00:11:49.167 --> 00:11:52.837
We're all going to go crush
the Orbital Elevator.

00:11:52.921 --> 00:11:54.547
And I mean all of us.

00:11:55.215 --> 00:11:57.717
Don't give your friends' lives

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.969
to that warm-up act Smiley
and the Institution.

00:12:00.762 --> 00:12:01.763
Roger.

00:12:03.681 --> 00:12:07.268
Everyone! Fight for your lives. Survive!

00:12:07.352 --> 00:12:10.021
Don't let any of those
fanatics through! Got it?

00:12:10.605 --> 00:12:12.774
ALL: Yeah!

00:12:13.858 --> 00:12:15.735
(grunts)
Poor thing.

00:12:15.818 --> 00:12:17.153
(groaning)

00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:19.739
(grunting)

00:12:19.822 --> 00:12:21.157
(gasps)

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.912
I'll educate and enlighten you.

00:12:26.537 --> 00:12:28.581
BLACK TRIKE: <i>Scan complete.</i>
<i>Many guard units.</i>

00:12:28.665 --> 00:12:30.500
<i>What should we do, Empress?</i>

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:32.877
We don't have time.
I'll use the Overdrive Key.

00:12:32.961 --> 00:12:35.380
<i>That's dangerous. I can't recommend it.</i>

00:12:35.463 --> 00:12:40.760
I know. I had unrepairable damage
the last time I used it.

00:12:40.843 --> 00:12:42.971
<i>Empress, your memory...</i>

00:12:43.054 --> 00:12:45.515
Yes, I remember it all now.

00:12:46.224 --> 00:12:50.979
EMPRESS: <i>In the last war,</i>
<i>the three of us were defeated by Lunatic.</i>

00:13:01.155 --> 00:13:02.949
Well... Huh?

00:13:05.702 --> 00:13:08.288
BLACK TRIKE: <i>Overdrive Key gives you</i>
<i>dozens of times</i>

<i>the strength of your normal power.</i>

00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:13.418
<i>But one wrong step,</i>

00:13:13.501 --> 00:13:18.506
<i>and your cranial nerves will overload</i>
<i>with countercurrent and be fried.</i>

00:13:18.589 --> 00:13:23.553
EMPRESS: But if I don't use it now,
I won't be able to rescue them.

00:13:24.554 --> 00:13:28.182
<i>Ten seconds.</i>
<i>That's all your body can take.</i>

00:13:28.266 --> 00:13:34.856
<i>Empress, although I'm a machine,</i>
<i>I feel that I don't want to lose you.</i>

00:13:35.231 --> 00:13:37.817
Okay. I'll do it within ten seconds.

00:13:40.987 --> 00:13:46.075
<i>Let's do it. I'll support you</i>
<i>with my best performance.</i>

00:13:46.409 --> 00:13:48.369
I'm depending on you.

00:13:52.457 --> 00:13:56.586
<i>Get set, Empress. Overdrive Keraunos.</i>

00:13:56.669 --> 00:14:00.214
<i>Initiating countdown.</i>

00:14:02.008 --> 00:14:03.968
<i>Ten, nine,</i>

00:14:04.052 --> 00:14:09.807
<i>eight, seven, six, five, four, three...</i>

00:14:09.891 --> 00:14:11.309
(blasting)

00:14:12.643 --> 00:14:13.978
(groans)

00:14:16.606 --> 00:14:18.524
You finally came.

00:14:20.026 --> 00:14:22.028
I'm taking these two with me.

00:14:22.111 --> 00:14:23.488
(weapons firing)

00:14:23.571 --> 00:14:24.781
(Black Trike yells)

00:14:26.032 --> 00:14:27.784
BLACK TRIKE: <i>Sorry, I'm late, Empress.</i>

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:30.286
No, the timing's perfect.

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:33.956
I knew it. You are definitely my bride.

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:37.293
The fact that you came here is proof.

00:14:37.376 --> 00:14:40.797
I don't understand how you came up
with that conclusion.

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:44.801
Then you should try harder.

00:14:47.637 --> 00:14:51.307
(Monica grunting)

00:14:52.767 --> 00:14:54.435
(gasps)
Yikes!

00:14:56.771 --> 00:14:58.356
My dad is gone, isn't he?

00:14:58.439 --> 00:15:00.358
MONICA: He's alive! He's still alive!

00:15:00.441 --> 00:15:04.112
Then I'll kill him.
I'll do it before he kills me.

00:15:04.695 --> 00:15:08.699
Okay, I got it. Please call the Colonel.

00:15:09.951 --> 00:15:14.122
Oh, Hemiteos Units,
you have chosen the wrong side.

00:15:14.205 --> 00:15:18.459
Humans are going extinct
and machines are the ruling species now.

00:15:18.543 --> 00:15:21.587
Doing what's right
isn't about picking sides.

00:15:21.671 --> 00:15:22.964
It's about choosing your own way.

00:15:23.047 --> 00:15:28.719
Nonsense. I pity you for not
understanding evolution and history.

00:15:28.803 --> 00:15:31.347
Damn. What's this feeling I'm getting?

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:35.977
I've experienced being rescued
by Empress before.

00:15:36.894 --> 00:15:41.023
My head hurts! Go away! Disappear!

00:15:41.107 --> 00:15:44.777
I'm going to kill you,
so I can kill myself later!

00:15:56.789 --> 00:16:00.793
BLACK TRIKE: <i>Lunatic's mind control</i>
<i>is triggered by your very existence.</i>

00:16:01.294 --> 00:16:03.963
<i>Debugging them will cause memory defects.</i>

00:16:04.672 --> 00:16:07.466
<i>They may not remember you...</i>

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:12.722
They can forget me,

(groans)

00:16:48.799 --> 00:16:54.180
EMPRESS: <i>It's okay.</i>
<i>I'll meet them again someday.</i>

00:16:57.433 --> 00:16:58.517
No. She didn't run away.

00:16:59.101 --> 00:17:03.022
She didn't. Empress didn't abandon us.

00:17:10.363 --> 00:17:14.408
Humans turned you orphans
into immortal war machines.

00:17:15.034 --> 00:17:16.869
SMILEY: You and I are the same.

00:17:16.953 --> 00:17:20.039
Perfect yet alone,
that's why we're attracted to each other.

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.041
No.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.379
We have our memories from the past.

00:17:26.879 --> 00:17:30.341
Our past experiences
led us to the present.

00:17:30.633 --> 00:17:32.009
But not you.

00:17:32.093 --> 00:17:34.637
Are you saying there's a difference?

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:40.268
You are obsessed with having a child,
because you want to deny your emptiness.

00:17:40.351 --> 00:17:44.063
But it's impossible for someone
who's empty to create anything.

00:17:44.146 --> 00:17:50.444
I have an idea. I'll eat you so you become
a part of my body to create my child.

00:17:51.028 --> 00:17:54.699
Charlotte! Listen to me carefully.
Drop your weapon.

00:17:54.782 --> 00:17:56.033
It's okay now.

00:17:56.158 --> 00:17:59.078
My dad is dead.
Schoolmaster Smiley told me so.

00:17:59.161 --> 00:18:00.955
No, that man is your father!

00:18:01.038 --> 00:18:02.623
COLONEL: You stay quiet!

00:18:02.707 --> 00:18:03.708
What?

00:18:04.917 --> 00:18:09.171
COLONEL: You're right. I don't deserve
to be called father by you.

00:18:09.255 --> 00:18:11.924
The one who protected you was Jessica.

00:18:12.508 --> 00:18:14.176
Jessica...

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.597
Of course, you remember her.
She was your mother.

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:20.308
CHARLOTTE: My mom tried to kill me!

00:18:20.391 --> 00:18:24.687
Jessica would never try to kill you.
You know that, Charlotte.

00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:28.983
COLONEL: She was your mother
and you were her daughter.

00:18:29.066 --> 00:18:30.234
(Charlotte gasps)

00:18:30.318 --> 00:18:32.069

00:18:32.153 --> 00:18:33.738
-(rumbling)
-COLONEL: Charlotte.

00:18:33.821 --> 00:18:35.072
Huh?
(grunts)

00:18:36.073 --> 00:18:37.325
(thuds)

00:18:44.081 --> 00:18:45.499
(Empress groans)

00:18:57.762 --> 00:18:59.680
I grab and I destroy!

00:18:59.764 --> 00:19:02.725
Aren't you dead yet?

00:19:02.808 --> 00:19:03.976
Whoa!

00:19:05.311 --> 00:19:07.396
I aim and I pierce!

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.690
(yelling)

00:19:12.985 --> 00:19:15.029
And you penetrate...

(grunts)

00:19:58.406 --> 00:20:01.158
I'm gonna kill...

00:20:04.286 --> 00:20:06.330
It's all right, Charlotte.

00:20:07.081 --> 00:20:11.043
I couldn't protect you or Jessica
when you needed me the most.

00:20:12.002 --> 00:20:15.297
But if you're going to kill me,
let me be the last.

00:20:15.381 --> 00:20:18.801
COLONEL: Charlotte,
don't kill anyone else.

00:20:18.884 --> 00:20:22.555
You don't have to kill anymore.

00:20:24.682 --> 00:20:25.683
(grunts)

00:20:29.645 --> 00:20:31.689

00:20:47.496 --> 00:20:49.123
You're a tough one.

00:20:49.206 --> 00:20:51.417
I have the luck of the devil.

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:55.546
People like you tend
to die easily in this world.

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:56.964
Huh?

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:00.468
They're back.

00:21:03.846 --> 00:21:08.476
We're both so roughed up,
it's too embarrassing to face my daughter.

00:21:09.059 --> 00:21:13.773
It was a deadly battle.
But I was able to rescue them.

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:17.276
I've never been on such
an enjoyable mission.

00:21:18.486 --> 00:21:20.780
(laughs)

00:21:21.363 --> 00:21:24.575
COLONEL: I never thought you'd make
a joke that could make me laugh.

00:21:24.658 --> 00:21:26.285
EMPRESS: You're capable of laughter?

00:21:26.368 --> 00:21:29.789
I have a pain in my stomach.
Don't make me laugh.

00:21:38.422 --> 00:21:45.054
Just wait and see. We'll beat those damn
scrap iron machines soon.

00:21:46.013 --> 00:21:47.598
CHARLOTTE: No cursing.

00:21:49.308 --> 00:21:52.102
Mom said no cursing in front of children.

00:21:52.186 --> 00:21:56.649
Oh, Charlotte, you...

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.528
Good morning, Dad.

("Before the Nightmare"

CORRESPONDENT:
The Iron Ocean is rising rapidly.

00:23:39.793 --> 00:23:41.545
