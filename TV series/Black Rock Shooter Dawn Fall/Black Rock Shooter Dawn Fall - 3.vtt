EMPRESS: Enemy? Bad guys?

00:00:17.476 --> 00:00:21.188
"Bad" is an understatement.
The Educational Institution is a cult.

00:00:21.772 --> 00:00:25.192
COLONEL: They massacre while claiming
to educate the ignorant masses.

00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:27.194
They're insane.

00:00:27.778 --> 00:00:31.198
It seems they already found out
about you, Empress.

00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:33.075
It's too soon.

00:00:33.158 --> 00:00:36.828
Should we fight or flee?
Of course, we should flee.

00:00:37.913 --> 00:00:40.707
Oh, geez! Hey, wake up!

00:00:40.791 --> 00:00:41.833
(whimpers)

00:00:41.917 --> 00:00:44.670
Educational Institution.
Empress went to fight them.

00:00:44.753 --> 00:00:46.129
We have to go, too.

00:00:46.797 --> 00:00:48.590
MONICA: No way! Why?

00:00:48.674 --> 00:00:51.468
We don't have a choice.
Just drive and go after her.

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:52.928
Yes, sir!

00:00:55.013 --> 00:00:56.848
Damn it!

00:04:39.488 --> 00:04:41.114
We did it somehow.

00:04:44.326 --> 00:04:47.579
We weren't the ones they were after.

00:04:47.662 --> 00:04:49.623
Hey, we don't have time to waste here.

00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:50.916
What about her?

00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:53.668
COLONEL: We'll take her
to the nearest town.

00:04:53.752 --> 00:04:55.545
We can't do more than that.

00:05:24.032 --> 00:05:26.159
No sane person would come near here.

00:05:26.243 --> 00:05:29.996
An Educational Institution train
will pass by here soon.

00:05:30.288 --> 00:05:32.290
My friends are being transported on it.

00:05:32.791 --> 00:05:36.545
We were all orphans from the slums.

MOMIJI: <i>We came under the protection</i>

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:46.721
to hold rituals as priestesses.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.183
They told us they would feed and pay us

00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:52.769

Hey, hey, ho. Done.

(groans)

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:21.590
Ooh.

00:06:22.048 --> 00:06:23.133
Excuse me.

00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:24.634
What is it?

00:06:24.718 --> 00:06:29.180
Our Human Resources Unit reports that
one of the sacrificial girls has escaped.

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:33.393
The rest of them will soon depart
on the armored train.

00:06:33.476 --> 00:06:36.021
One girl is missing?

00:06:36.605 --> 00:06:38.565
We're tracking her. We won't lose her.

00:06:38.648 --> 00:06:39.941
Hmm...

00:06:40.025 --> 00:06:42.569
Why do you think I require sacrifices?

00:06:46.364 --> 00:06:49.326
I was the one chosen by the Moon Goddess.

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.871
Finding a girl befitting one such as me
is very difficult.

00:06:52.954 --> 00:06:56.833
That won't stop me from trying.

00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:58.585
It is all for the human race.

00:06:58.668 --> 00:07:00.211
Yes, sir!

00:07:00.837 --> 00:07:04.382
SMILEY: <i>We educate the ignorant masses.</i>

00:07:04.466 --> 00:07:06.843
<i>That's why</i>
<i>we're the Educational Institution,</i>

00:07:07.344 --> 00:07:11.973
<i>the only organization which takes</i>
<i>the progress of humankind seriously.</i>

00:07:13.058 --> 00:07:15.143
Anything that interferes
with that education

00:07:15.226 --> 00:07:19.314
must be eliminated
through the use of force.

00:07:19.564 --> 00:07:24.611
Summon all forces around the railway
and recapture the girl.

00:07:24.694 --> 00:07:29.407
And if recapture is not possible,
you know what to do.

00:07:34.245 --> 00:07:36.373
Three hundred kilometers east of here,

00:07:36.998 --> 00:07:41.252
there is a facility where the girls
are confined by the Institution.

00:07:41.336 --> 00:07:43.129
So you ran away from there?

00:07:43.963 --> 00:07:45.256
Not on foot, clearly?

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.384
I drove a car part of the way.

00:07:47.884 --> 00:07:49.594
But I'm not good at driving.

00:07:50.095 --> 00:07:51.763
I crashed the car.

00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:57.977
You're asking us to rescue some girls
who are being transported

00:07:58.061 --> 00:08:01.564
from one Educational Institution facility
to another? That's crazy.

00:08:03.692 --> 00:08:05.735
But I…

00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:07.320
(zaps)

00:08:07.404 --> 00:08:08.571
(gasps)

00:08:09.781 --> 00:08:10.949
Everybody duck!

00:08:11.074 --> 00:08:12.617
What the hell?

00:08:12.701 --> 00:08:14.327
-Snipers!
-(whimpers)

00:08:24.462 --> 00:08:26.464
(tense music)

00:08:29.134 --> 00:08:30.885
I won't let you escape again.

00:08:30.969 --> 00:08:34.389
DEAD MASTER:
This is how I express my love, Empress.

00:08:35.598 --> 00:08:37.934
Black Rock Shooter.

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:42.230
(suspenseful music)

00:08:43.022 --> 00:08:45.442
I counted to three from the bullet impact.

00:08:45.775 --> 00:08:48.695
I would say it's probably
from about one kilometer away.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:49.696
How do you know?

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:53.324
High-caliber rifle bullets
are faster than the speed of sound.

00:08:53.408 --> 00:08:55.368
So there's a gap between the impact--

00:08:55.452 --> 00:08:57.203
BLACK TRIKE: <i>That calculation is wrong.</i>

00:08:57.287 --> 00:08:58.455
How is it wrong?

00:08:58.538 --> 00:09:03.668
<i>The speed of the bullet at impact</i>
<i>was over five times the speed of sound.</i>

00:09:03.752 --> 00:09:07.422
<i>Due to insufficient data,</i>
<i>the enemy's exact position can't be fixed.</i>

00:09:07.505 --> 00:09:10.008
<i>But it's clear they're</i>
<i>over five kilometers away.</i>

00:09:10.091 --> 00:09:13.553
Five kilometers?
So that can't be an ordinary firearm.

00:09:13.678 --> 00:09:14.929
Monica.

00:09:15.013 --> 00:09:16.097
Yes, sir?

00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:17.432
Stand up for a minute.

00:09:17.515 --> 00:09:20.435
What? Is there a good reason I should?

00:09:20.518 --> 00:09:23.938
Let them shoot once more
to determine the number of snipers.

00:09:24.064 --> 00:09:27.692
I'm not doing that.
I'm not getting up. I don't want to die.

00:09:27.776 --> 00:09:29.819
Oh, all right.

00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:34.157
-(hissing)
-(gasps)

00:09:39.079 --> 00:09:40.246
(gasps)

00:09:42.874 --> 00:09:43.792
Tch.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.588
BLACK TRIKE: <i>Here we go!</i>

00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:53.927
(Dead Master scoffs)

00:10:00.558 --> 00:10:02.977
Looks like we lost them.

00:10:04.104 --> 00:10:08.608
COLONEL: There's enough cover here.
They shouldn't be able to get us easily.

00:10:09.109 --> 00:10:12.403
Long-range snipers
aren't standard for the Unmanned Forces.

00:10:12.987 --> 00:10:14.781
Could it be the Educational Institution?

00:10:14.864 --> 00:10:19.786
No. Institution snipers work
with at least teams of four.

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:22.789
Two snipers and two spotters.

00:10:22.872 --> 00:10:26.000
They shoot at once, aiming at two targets.

00:10:26.084 --> 00:10:27.335
Then...

00:10:27.418 --> 00:10:29.129
It could be something else.

00:10:29.712 --> 00:10:32.799
Excuse me, about the train…

00:10:32.882 --> 00:10:34.175
Huh?

00:10:34.884 --> 00:10:38.471
How can you change the subject like that?

00:10:38.555 --> 00:10:41.558
Can't you tell we're busy
discussing other things?

00:10:43.434 --> 00:10:45.061
I want to help her.

00:10:45.145 --> 00:10:46.563
-COLONEL: Keep quiet!
-(whimpers)

00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:48.940
That's just not in the cards.

00:10:49.023 --> 00:10:51.401
MONICA: About that, Colonel.

00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:52.443
What?

00:10:52.527 --> 00:10:54.612
MONICA: Actually,
it might just be in the cards.

00:10:54.696 --> 00:10:55.530
What?

00:10:56.114 --> 00:10:58.867
I've been checking Empress's wound.

00:10:59.576 --> 00:11:03.496
It's amazing. I want to lick it all over,
that's how wonderful it is.

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:06.499
Don't lick anything. Get to the point.

00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:10.670
Empress absorbs scrap iron
and drone parts,

00:11:10.753 --> 00:11:13.965
and accumulates them internally
by high-density compression.

00:11:14.048 --> 00:11:17.844
They're used to building her own parts.

00:11:18.219 --> 00:11:20.555
Sounds basically like recycling.

00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:24.142
MONICA: Yes. The self-regeneration
has already begun.

00:11:24.225 --> 00:11:26.060
She heals herself automatically.

00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:29.606
But this way takes some time.

00:11:30.315 --> 00:11:34.903
There are adaptable biological materials
for the DNA computers

00:11:34.986 --> 00:11:38.114
mounted on Hemiteos Units,
including Empress.

00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:42.619
You mean if we had those materials,
she'd heal faster?

00:11:43.203 --> 00:11:44.913
Without those materials,
it might take days

00:11:44.996 --> 00:11:46.664
for her arm to regenerate.

00:11:47.081 --> 00:11:50.585
Maybe a week or more.

00:11:50.668 --> 00:11:54.923
If we had those biological materials,
future battles would be easier.

00:11:55.006 --> 00:11:56.174
Hmm...

00:11:56.883 --> 00:11:58.635
How heavily guarded is the train?

00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:00.178
Uh...

00:12:00.261 --> 00:12:03.306
I was in a rush to get out,
so I'm not sure.

00:12:03.389 --> 00:12:06.601
But there were five
or six Educational Institution soldiers.

00:12:07.185 --> 00:12:08.978
I think some robots, too.

00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:12.815
That's no problem for Empress.
It'll be a cinch.

00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:18.404
Biological material from a few robots
would be enough for an arm.

00:12:18.488 --> 00:12:21.074
MONICA:
Maybe for some stock material, too.

00:12:21.157 --> 00:12:22.367
Mm.

00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:27.497
All right. Our purpose will strictly
be to collect biological materials,

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:30.083
but we're going to rescue your friends.

00:12:30.166 --> 00:12:31.459
(gasps)

00:12:32.168 --> 00:12:34.045
Colonel says he'll help you.

00:12:34.128 --> 00:12:35.630
I'm so relieved!

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:38.633
COLONEL: Where are the girls?

00:12:38.716 --> 00:12:40.718
In the last car of the train.

00:12:40.802 --> 00:12:42.303
First, we need to get close.

00:12:42.387 --> 00:12:45.223
Empress, can you fire the Coil Gun?

00:12:45.306 --> 00:12:49.560
I can. But with one arm,
it's hard to balance.

00:12:49.644 --> 00:12:52.105
That's fine as long as you can fire it.

00:12:52.188 --> 00:12:55.608
Anyway, that'll be our first strike.

00:12:56.693 --> 00:12:58.695
(suspenseful music)

00:13:10.039 --> 00:13:10.999
-What?
-Whoa!

00:13:11.082 --> 00:13:12.500
COLONEL: What the hell is that?

00:13:13.376 --> 00:13:16.963
There are more guards than we anticipated.
Our game plan won't work.

00:13:17.046 --> 00:13:18.965
-I'll fire now.
-Huh?

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:20.049
COLONEL: Wait...

00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:22.218
(zapping)

00:13:22.302 --> 00:13:23.136
(gasps)

00:13:25.096 --> 00:13:26.639
(explosion)

00:13:30.727 --> 00:13:32.895
(buzzing)

00:13:35.023 --> 00:13:39.444
(zapping)

00:13:40.528 --> 00:13:42.447
(weapons firing)

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:44.949
Darn it. We'll have to fight.

00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:59.922
Black Trike, I'm counting on you.

00:14:00.006 --> 00:14:03.259
BLACK TRIKE: <i>Roger that. Here we go.</i>

00:14:12.769 --> 00:14:13.936
(grumbles)

00:14:16.022 --> 00:14:17.607
BLACK TRIKE: <i>Take that!</i>

00:14:20.693 --> 00:14:23.112
(weapons firing)

00:14:23.196 --> 00:14:26.616
(grunting)

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:28.701
(grunts)

00:14:28.785 --> 00:14:30.203
(whimpers)

00:14:30.286 --> 00:14:33.164
(blasting)

00:14:51.557 --> 00:14:52.558
(Colonel grunts)

00:14:55.394 --> 00:15:00.608
DEAD MASTER: Oh, Empress.
You belong to me.

00:15:00.691 --> 00:15:03.111
I'm the one who will destroy you.

00:15:03.194 --> 00:15:05.696
That must be Dead Master.

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:09.909
I see. She was the sniper
who targeted Empress.

00:15:10.535 --> 00:15:12.078
Who the hell is she?

00:15:12.411 --> 00:15:14.288
COLONEL: She's like Strength.

00:15:14.372 --> 00:15:17.083
They used to be on the same side
as Empress in the past.

00:15:23.756 --> 00:15:25.675
(grunting)

00:15:31.097 --> 00:15:33.766
(zapping)

00:15:40.481 --> 00:15:41.524
(grunts)

00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:46.445
(groans)

00:15:49.991 --> 00:15:50.908
(grunts)

00:15:53.494 --> 00:15:54.537
Get out of the way!

00:16:02.336 --> 00:16:03.379
(gasps)

00:16:19.145 --> 00:16:20.396
(soft grunt)

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:28.154
Empress, I love you. And I hate you.

00:16:31.282 --> 00:16:35.411
I'll kill you, then violate you.
I'll violate you, then kill you.

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:40.958
(mutters)

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.295
-(blasts)
-(grunts)

00:16:49.133 --> 00:16:51.010
I said, out of the way!

00:16:53.512 --> 00:16:54.805
(blasts)

00:16:57.266 --> 00:16:58.351
Colonel.

00:16:58.434 --> 00:16:59.477
Now's the time!

00:17:04.857 --> 00:17:06.776
See you later.

00:17:12.865 --> 00:17:17.286
Jumping on a train car.
This is the most enjoyable mission ever.

00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:19.538
Is this fun for you?

00:17:20.414 --> 00:17:22.291
I thought you were strange.

00:17:22.375 --> 00:17:26.254
You don't understand sarcasm, do you?

00:17:33.344 --> 00:17:34.470
(grunts)

00:17:47.608 --> 00:17:49.402
Too close.

00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:58.661
I absolutely got this.

00:17:59.787 --> 00:18:01.163
-(zaps)
-(blasts)

00:18:06.586 --> 00:18:08.504
Hurry up and fix yourself!

00:18:08.588 --> 00:18:09.547
-(trilling)
-(gasps)

00:18:12.383 --> 00:18:13.426
(grunts)

00:18:17.471 --> 00:18:18.681
(buzzing)

00:18:23.978 --> 00:18:26.897
This is so great. What a party.

00:18:27.857 --> 00:18:30.484
Oh, that was sarcasm.

00:18:30.568 --> 00:18:31.444
Yeah, it was.

00:18:32.528 --> 00:18:34.780
(gunshots)

00:18:42.079 --> 00:18:43.497
(all gasp)

00:18:43.581 --> 00:18:45.374
(gunshots)

00:18:47.376 --> 00:18:48.753
That was the last of them.

00:18:56.636 --> 00:18:57.720
(both) Mm.

00:19:16.113 --> 00:19:19.241
(panting)

00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:27.750
-(door slams open)
-(all whimpering)

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.380
Don't be afraid. We've come to rescue you.

00:19:32.755 --> 00:19:34.256
Just on the way.

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:35.383
Everyone!

00:19:35.466 --> 00:19:37.093
(all gasp)

00:19:38.594 --> 00:19:40.304
I'm going to let you out now.

00:19:42.056 --> 00:19:44.517
GIRLS: Thank you, Momiji.

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:48.521
-I'm so glad you came to save us.
-(all whimpering)

00:19:49.146 --> 00:19:50.314
MOMIJI: <i>Just a minute.</i>

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:52.316
Hm.

00:19:52.942 --> 00:19:53.818
Do it.

00:19:55.152 --> 00:20:00.324
(toy babies laughing)

00:20:02.451 --> 00:20:03.327
(gasps)

00:20:03.411 --> 00:20:05.079
(grunts)

00:20:07.915 --> 00:20:09.834
(laughing stops)

00:20:12.878 --> 00:20:14.296
-(explosion)
-(Colonel screaming)

00:20:15.631 --> 00:20:17.007
Whoa!

00:20:17.091 --> 00:20:19.051
(splashing)

00:20:20.219 --> 00:20:22.221
(somber music)

00:20:27.435 --> 00:20:31.147
(groaning)

00:20:31.731 --> 00:20:32.940
Empress!

00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:40.740
EMPRESS: I...

00:20:41.741 --> 00:20:44.660
I... I...

00:20:44.744 --> 00:20:46.662
(groaning)

00:20:48.748 --> 00:20:52.626
I'm sorry. I...

00:21:11.645 --> 00:21:14.482
MONICA: Westward
to the Peacebuilding Force base.

00:21:15.065 --> 00:21:16.066
We'll be fine.

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:18.277
It should just be another few hours.

00:21:18.903 --> 00:21:20.237
Yeah.

00:21:20.321 --> 00:21:24.241
COLONEL: Battling Artemis' Unmanned Forces
is literally hell.

00:21:24.325 --> 00:21:27.286
I've been through horrible missions.

00:21:28.329 --> 00:21:32.958
I don't care how many
of my soldiers die anymore.

00:21:33.584 --> 00:21:35.169
But look at her.

00:21:35.503 --> 00:21:38.464
MONICA: She's been sleeping
since we lost the girls.

00:21:38.547 --> 00:21:41.467
I didn't think she was this unstable.

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:43.427
It's going to be all right.

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:46.806
She was born to fight.

00:21:47.181 --> 00:21:51.519
She's a secret weapon of the human race
thoroughly modified for that purpose.

00:21:51.602 --> 00:21:53.229
Black Rock Shooter.

00:21:53.312 --> 00:21:55.272
She'll be okay.

00:21:55.356 --> 00:21:56.774
I hope so.

00:22:06.951 --> 00:22:08.160
Empress.

00:22:08.244 --> 00:22:09.620
(chuckles)

00:22:09.703 --> 00:22:11.914
(zooming)

00:22:13.958 --> 00:22:15.918
