00:00:02.377 --> 00:00:04.379
(light music)

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:13.972
Is it really okay?

00:00:18.393 --> 00:00:19.394
Yeah.

00:00:19.978 --> 00:00:22.940
This way, we can fight together forever.

00:00:26.318 --> 00:00:29.947
It's very hard to live forever.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.448
But...

00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:35.410
(groans, screams)

00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:41.959
(Strength panting)

00:00:44.962 --> 00:00:46.922
This headache is killing me.

00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:51.009
("ASEED" by ZAQ playing)

00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:30.567
(woman gasps)

00:02:31.652 --> 00:02:33.987
(woman screams)

00:02:35.697 --> 00:02:38.200
(men whimper)

00:02:38.283 --> 00:02:40.702
(gulping)

00:02:45.957 --> 00:02:47.918
Bartender, another one.

00:02:50.504 --> 00:02:51.421
(soft grunt)

00:02:51.505 --> 00:02:55.676
Don't be skimpy. Give me the bottle.

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:57.803
-(gulping)
-Hey, you.

00:02:57.886 --> 00:03:00.180
You're scaring the other customers.

00:03:00.263 --> 00:03:01.932
-Isn't it time to go home--
-(grunts)

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:03.350
(exhales heavily)

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:06.436
-(retreating footsteps)
-Huh?

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.188
(retches)

00:03:08.271 --> 00:03:10.982
Not in front of my bar!

00:03:14.403 --> 00:03:20.992
(Strength retching)

00:03:21.076 --> 00:03:24.204
(breathing heavily)

00:03:24.287 --> 00:03:29.084
Crap! Now, I'm really drowning
in my own vomit.

00:03:31.628 --> 00:03:36.466
Please help...
The fortified city was attacked...

00:03:39.136 --> 00:03:42.389
This spot is occupied. Go away.

00:03:42.472 --> 00:03:45.559
(groaning)

00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:48.228
You.

00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:49.563
Huh?

00:03:50.856 --> 00:03:53.066
Are you Strength?

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.986
You're that kid from the other day.
I can still kill you.

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.487
(groans)

00:03:59.281 --> 00:04:02.242
Please. I need Empress right away.

00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:03.243
(gasps angrily)

00:04:03.827 --> 00:04:07.998
Don't say that name. It drives me crazy.

00:04:09.583 --> 00:04:11.835
(grunting)

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:16.715
There's no time. My sister has been
abducted by the Educational Institution.

00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:19.217
Get off me, you brat. Don't touch me.

00:04:19.301 --> 00:04:21.011
(weapons firing)

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:22.012
Uh!

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:23.764
(whirring)

00:04:23.847 --> 00:04:24.890
(grunts)

00:04:27.476 --> 00:04:29.978
You're a pawn
of the Institution, aren't you?

00:04:30.061 --> 00:04:32.439
No, but they took my sister and...

00:04:38.028 --> 00:04:39.446
(grunts)

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:47.370
Yikes!

00:04:54.503 --> 00:04:55.420
(gasps)

00:04:59.508 --> 00:05:03.178
Definitely a Hemiteos Unit.
Dispose of her.

00:05:03.261 --> 00:05:06.473
You'll be the ones getting killed.

00:05:06.556 --> 00:05:08.558
(Norito grunting, yelps)

00:05:09.518 --> 00:05:10.685
(yells)

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.648
(gunshots)

00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:17.859
Is that all you got?

00:05:21.196 --> 00:05:22.906
(grunts)

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:23.824
(explosion)

00:05:23.907 --> 00:05:25.200
(gasps)

00:05:25.283 --> 00:05:27.077
(gunshots)

00:05:31.206 --> 00:05:32.374
(yells)

00:05:34.918 --> 00:05:36.461
Take this!

00:05:43.927 --> 00:05:45.720
Arche? Darn it!

00:05:47.305 --> 00:05:50.141
(squelching)

00:05:50.225 --> 00:05:51.309
(grunts)

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:11.037
(thrilling music)

00:06:16.543 --> 00:06:17.586
(grunts)

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:21.840
(sobbing)

00:06:21.923 --> 00:06:23.842
No more violence.

00:06:23.925 --> 00:06:26.344
(engine roars)

00:06:26.428 --> 00:06:27.596
(groans)

00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:30.098
(tires screeching)

00:06:32.767 --> 00:06:33.768
(sobs)

00:06:33.852 --> 00:06:37.188
(tires screeching)

00:06:37.272 --> 00:06:40.650
(gunshots)

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:44.279
(grunts)

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:50.994
After them.

00:07:00.962 --> 00:07:03.590
(engines zooming)

00:07:06.343 --> 00:07:08.219
(zaps, blasts)

00:07:12.307 --> 00:07:13.308
(thuds)

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.769
(crackling)

00:07:18.396 --> 00:07:20.398
(light music)

00:07:24.361 --> 00:07:26.363
(tense music)

00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:33.536
(groaning)

00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:39.542
(gunshots)

00:07:40.627 --> 00:07:44.047
-(grunting)
-(squishing)

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:50.553
Empress, all enemy drone response
has vanished.

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:52.555
This fight is over.

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:54.057
Yes.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.104
This base is now under control.

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:03.191
The Institution's indiscriminate airstrike
left no survivors.

00:08:03.274 --> 00:08:05.527
All of their soldiers

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:08.363
and abductees are dead.

00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:21.334
EMPRESS: I couldn't save them, again.

00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:26.256
Colonel, where's Charlotte?

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:29.718
She escaped out of our range of pursuit.

00:08:30.051 --> 00:08:31.386
She's too fast.

00:08:33.471 --> 00:08:39.310
I've been salvaging information
from the database left on the train.

00:08:39.894 --> 00:08:44.441
I have good news and bad news.
Which do you want to hear?

00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:45.567
Good news.

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:47.360
All right, then.

00:08:47.569 --> 00:08:50.572
Since the GPS is unusable,

00:08:50.655 --> 00:08:54.909
transport trains are controlled by
old-fashioned service planning diagrams...

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:57.954
Cut the crap. What did you find out?

00:08:58.038 --> 00:09:03.543
I found the point where the train line
meets the rails from the Institution.

00:09:03.626 --> 00:09:05.795
So if we follow the train line...

00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:10.300
The head of the Educational Institution,
Smiley, will be there.

00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:11.301
(gasps)

00:09:13.636 --> 00:09:15.972
(breathes heavily)

00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:17.724
(clinks)

00:09:19.476 --> 00:09:20.560
Uh...

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.564
(somber music)

00:09:24.647 --> 00:09:26.858
What's the bad news?

00:09:28.193 --> 00:09:29.694
Oh, about that.

00:09:31.529 --> 00:09:34.866
I found something that kind of
makes things worse.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:38.078
Miya.

00:09:38.161 --> 00:09:39.621
How about Norito?

00:09:39.704 --> 00:09:43.208
They only sacrifice girls,
so maybe they already...

00:09:47.337 --> 00:09:48.338
EMPRESS: Let's go.

00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:49.506
If we stop now,

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:52.675
those who we should be able
to save will die.

00:09:53.676 --> 00:09:55.053
(engine starts)

00:09:56.805 --> 00:09:58.014
(zooms)

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:16.449
Uh...

00:10:16.908 --> 00:10:19.786
Hey, wait for me!

00:10:19.869 --> 00:10:21.830
(grunting)

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:28.503
You forgot about me! Hey, you guys!
Let me go with you!

00:10:29.671 --> 00:10:31.881
(buzzing)

00:10:36.928 --> 00:10:38.471
They're everywhere.

00:10:39.013 --> 00:10:40.348
(Strength whimpers)

00:10:40.431 --> 00:10:42.934
Is it just a matter of time
until they find us?

00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:47.063
Don't give up yet.
Let's find another route.

00:10:47.147 --> 00:10:48.148
Okay.

00:10:49.607 --> 00:10:50.567
Huh?

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:51.734
You know what?

00:10:51.818 --> 00:10:53.403
What?

00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:56.156
I just thought that
you seemed so different.

00:10:56.239 --> 00:10:59.951
When you had your Gigantic Arm,
you seemed so strong.

00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:03.079
I'm weird without it.

00:11:03.163 --> 00:11:05.206
No, I mean...

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:07.834
Well, you're so tiny and cute.

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:11.296
-(whimpers)
-Uh...

00:11:11.379 --> 00:11:13.840
-(sobbing)
-Hey!

00:11:14.883 --> 00:11:16.509
(gasps, grunts)

00:11:21.848 --> 00:11:23.850
(somber music)

00:11:31.983 --> 00:11:35.945
(panting)

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:37.113
(yelps)

00:11:39.073 --> 00:11:40.366
(whimpers)

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:41.993
-(cracks)
-(shrieks)

00:11:43.328 --> 00:11:44.704
(whines)

00:11:45.205 --> 00:11:50.376
(grunting)

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.462
(both grunting)

00:11:53.296 --> 00:11:54.464
That was close.

00:11:59.886 --> 00:12:02.722
Let's go now.
They'll find us if we stay here.

00:12:03.765 --> 00:12:08.269
I know, but where can we go?

00:12:09.646 --> 00:12:12.315
Take me to where Empress is.

00:12:12.398 --> 00:12:14.817
Empress?
(gasps)

00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:18.988
NORITO: Is it too hard?

00:12:19.072 --> 00:12:21.574
STRENGTH: Oh, well, I...

00:12:29.666 --> 00:12:33.920
I guess it's not easy being
a powerful Hemiteos Unit.

00:12:34.003 --> 00:12:37.423
It's not that. To me, Empress is special.

00:12:37.507 --> 00:12:39.300
Because of her, I...

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:41.719
(sobs)

00:12:41.803 --> 00:12:43.263
I can't remember.

00:12:43.638 --> 00:12:47.558
Why? Why did you disappear, Empress?

00:12:48.351 --> 00:12:51.813
You really don't know where she is?

00:12:52.522 --> 00:12:55.817
I don't know. I can't remember anything.

00:12:59.904 --> 00:13:01.781
Oh, hey!

00:13:02.448 --> 00:13:03.616
What?

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.120
Maybe we should rest a little.
You look like you're in pain.

00:13:08.454 --> 00:13:10.957
They're looking for us. We should flee.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:11.874
(grunts)

00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.084
Huh?

00:13:13.167 --> 00:13:15.920
(both breathing sharply)

00:13:19.924 --> 00:13:24.345
Fool. You still don't get it?
That kid double-crossed you.

00:13:25.013 --> 00:13:25.847
What?

00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:32.603
(gasps)

00:13:35.732 --> 00:13:37.150
Why?

00:13:37.859 --> 00:13:41.154
They said I'd get my sister back
if I obeyed.

00:13:41.738 --> 00:13:45.074
She's a mighty fighting machine
that survived the war,

00:13:45.158 --> 00:13:46.659
so don't spare the ammo.

00:13:47.243 --> 00:13:50.163
(breathing nervously)

00:13:50.246 --> 00:13:53.416
(weapons clicking)

00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:56.669
(whimpering)

00:14:01.215 --> 00:14:02.258
(yells)

00:14:03.426 --> 00:14:08.598
Run! It's all my fault!
But spare Miya, my sister.

00:14:08.681 --> 00:14:09.766
You little...

00:14:10.933 --> 00:14:11.851
(groans)

00:14:11.934 --> 00:14:13.102
(weapons click)

00:14:13.186 --> 00:14:16.647
(grunting)

00:14:20.276 --> 00:14:21.277
(clangs)

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:25.031
(rumbling)

00:14:25.114 --> 00:14:27.116
(all screaming)

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.493
(gasps)

00:14:39.003 --> 00:14:42.757
Crushed by rocks from this height.
That must be fatal even for her.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.008
(gasps)

00:14:44.092 --> 00:14:45.510
Take him.

00:14:45.593 --> 00:14:46.511
(Norito grunts)

00:14:46.594 --> 00:14:48.971
Bastards! Let me go!

00:14:49.055 --> 00:14:51.724
NORITO: Miya!

00:14:57.522 --> 00:14:59.524
(calm music)

00:14:59.607 --> 00:15:04.529
(Strength sobbing)

00:15:06.155 --> 00:15:09.117
It's awful. Just like I thought.
I hate humans!

00:15:11.994 --> 00:15:14.288
They betray easily and break down easily.

00:15:14.372 --> 00:15:16.791
They are crap. Humans are crap.

00:15:19.335 --> 00:15:24.632
But they're probably going to kill him.
And his sister, too.

00:15:25.216 --> 00:15:29.887
Ignore them. Even after saving them,
they end up getting killed, like always.

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:35.768
Hemiteos Units are immortal.
Humans are not.

00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:40.439
Humans are too fragile.
So many die in wars. It seems endless.

00:15:41.858 --> 00:15:46.195
That's why I hate humans now?

00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:48.823
But my headache still won't go away!

00:15:49.824 --> 00:15:51.242
(thuds)

00:15:53.035 --> 00:15:54.954
(sobbing)

00:15:58.749 --> 00:16:04.130
Did you know it would be like this
from the beginning, Empress?

00:16:04.213 --> 00:16:07.925
EMPRESS: <i>It's very hard to live forever.</i>

00:16:08.009 --> 00:16:09.177
But...

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:14.807
Then why are you fighting again?
Why are you trying to protect humans?

00:16:15.725 --> 00:16:17.310
Tell me why.

00:16:19.187 --> 00:16:21.230
(uplifting music)

00:16:27.445 --> 00:16:30.656
Black Rock Shooter!

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.074
(weapon fires)

00:16:39.665 --> 00:16:41.209
Answer me.

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.422
(squelching)

00:16:50.426 --> 00:16:54.889
All he could do is snitch,
and he's not worth educating.

00:16:55.389 --> 00:16:56.599
We're disposing of him.

00:16:56.682 --> 00:17:01.812
CHARLOTTE: <i>That's fine.</i>
<i>Useless men are food for the Iron Ocean.</i>

00:17:03.231 --> 00:17:04.857
Agreed.

00:17:04.941 --> 00:17:06.609
(groaning)

00:17:10.112 --> 00:17:11.530
(crashes)

00:17:12.698 --> 00:17:14.408
(tires screeching)

00:17:18.871 --> 00:17:20.915
(gunshots)

00:17:24.335 --> 00:17:26.504
Strength...
(groaning)

00:17:26.587 --> 00:17:27.880
(Norito coughs)

00:17:27.964 --> 00:17:31.384
I can do this! I know I can! Let's go!

00:17:42.728 --> 00:17:44.689
-(zaps)
-(both gasp)

00:17:44.772 --> 00:17:46.274
(engine rumbles)

00:17:46.357 --> 00:17:48.192
-(gunshots)
-(tires screeching)

00:17:49.777 --> 00:17:52.280
-Hm?
-(weapon firing)

00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:58.452
(suspenseful music)

00:18:03.791 --> 00:18:08.170
My goodness. Strength has such good luck.

00:18:08.796 --> 00:18:11.173
Your voice has reached us.

00:18:20.016 --> 00:18:22.018
Empress' energy.

00:18:22.935 --> 00:18:24.937
(action music)

00:18:32.653 --> 00:18:34.488
(clanking)

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:41.454
I'm alive again!

00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:45.583
It's time for a major payback.

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:53.257
Let the Arche swallow her whole.

00:18:53.883 --> 00:18:57.011
You think I'd fall
for the same trick twice?

00:18:58.971 --> 00:19:01.223
(sloshing)

00:19:03.559 --> 00:19:04.477
I clobber!

00:19:07.104 --> 00:19:08.397
I grab!

00:19:08.481 --> 00:19:09.565
(groans)

00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:12.026
I tear apart and destroy!

00:19:12.109 --> 00:19:14.570
(blasting)

00:19:16.072 --> 00:19:21.285
That's the stuff. Hurray for violence!

00:19:25.581 --> 00:19:27.583
(calm music)

00:19:30.461 --> 00:19:34.965
I hope next time you can be reborn
in a better world.

00:19:38.969 --> 00:19:41.681
We're attacking
the Institution's headquarters.

00:19:42.264 --> 00:19:43.974
I want you to come, too.

00:19:44.684 --> 00:19:47.103
STRENGTH: No way I'm going with you.

00:19:47.687 --> 00:19:48.688
All right.

00:19:50.064 --> 00:19:51.148
Norito.

00:19:54.735 --> 00:19:56.028
What's this?

00:19:56.612 --> 00:20:00.700
It's the point where the train line
meets the rails from the Institution.

00:20:01.158 --> 00:20:04.578
Your sister Miya was taken there.

00:20:04.662 --> 00:20:05.788
(gasps)

00:20:06.914 --> 00:20:08.332
Whatever. You do you.

00:20:08.749 --> 00:20:12.044
Your excessive charity is sickening.

00:20:12.795 --> 00:20:14.547
Strength.

00:20:15.089 --> 00:20:17.425
Okay. You can do whatever you want.

00:20:18.759 --> 00:20:22.430
I have a feeling I'll be able
to fight next to you again.

00:20:25.349 --> 00:20:27.351
(zooming)

00:20:32.815 --> 00:20:38.237
Crap. I would've been dead without you.
I'll repay you for this.

00:20:45.286 --> 00:20:47.037
My headache's gone.

00:20:53.502 --> 00:20:54.795
I won't need this anymore.

00:20:58.716 --> 00:21:01.135
Sorry I betrayed you.

00:21:02.887 --> 00:21:04.638
Do you know what you're facing?

00:21:04.722 --> 00:21:06.640
(whimpering)

00:21:11.729 --> 00:21:15.149
You just concentrate
on rescuing your sister.

00:21:15.232 --> 00:21:16.066
(Norito gasps)

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:18.110
We're going to crush the Institution.

00:21:18.194 --> 00:21:19.153
Right!

00:21:19.236 --> 00:21:20.821
(engine starts)

00:21:29.455 --> 00:21:33.125
EMPRESS: <i>It's very hard to live forever.</i>

00:21:33.793 --> 00:21:34.627
But...

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:41.217
if we do, we can keep meeting
our precious friends.

00:21:42.426 --> 00:21:43.469
(gasps)

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.688
Please be safe, Miya.

00:22:01.028 --> 00:22:02.446
Hmm...

00:22:06.534 --> 00:22:08.536
(ominous music)

00:22:14.083 --> 00:22:16.043
("Before the Nightmare"
by Kanako Takatsuki playing)
