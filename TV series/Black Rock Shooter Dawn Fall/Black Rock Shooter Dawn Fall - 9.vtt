SMILEY: I feel bad about you
being a guinea pig for us.

00:00:08.217 --> 00:00:11.136
Schoolmaster Smiley, you saved my life.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.639
I'll endure any kind of suffering.

00:00:14.348 --> 00:00:16.141
Wonderful sense of commitment.

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:19.895
SMILEY: Your dead father would be proud
of you for being so useful.

00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:22.940
(quivers)

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:27.945
CHARLOTTE: I'm scared, Mom.
Where are we going?

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:29.655
-Hurry, we must go.
-(zaps)

00:00:29.738 --> 00:00:31.823
(both gasp)

00:00:32.407 --> 00:00:33.575
Stop right there.

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:34.993
JESSICA: Let us go.

00:00:35.077 --> 00:00:39.081
Charlotte, listen. The experiment failed.

00:00:39.665 --> 00:00:41.583
I... was a failure?

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:47.047
Hemiteos modifications were incomplete.
Jessica sabotaged the device.

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:48.423
Mom did?

00:00:48.507 --> 00:00:49.841
No, Charlotte.

00:00:49.925 --> 00:00:51.301
SMILEY: Don't worry.

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:54.846
No matter the result,
you're like my daughter.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.308
In place of your dead father,
I will love you as my daughter.

00:00:58.392 --> 00:01:01.311
You'll be my father?

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:05.023
So just come back here
to my side, Charlotte.

00:01:05.107 --> 00:01:06.608
JESSICA: Shut up, Smiley!

00:01:06.692 --> 00:01:09.361
This is where your plan ends.

00:01:10.195 --> 00:01:11.363
CHARLOTTE: Mom?

00:01:11.947 --> 00:01:13.949
There's no other choice now.

00:01:14.032 --> 00:01:15.701
-(gunshot)
-(both yelp)

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.120
(groans)

00:01:19.538 --> 00:01:21.331
SMILEY: A parent murdering their child?

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.001
Well, I'll forgive your sin.

00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:28.589
Come back with us and complete
your daughter's Hemiteos modifications.

00:01:28.672 --> 00:01:31.592
Make your daughter into my bride
to bear my child.

00:01:31.675 --> 00:01:32.801
Never!

00:01:32.884 --> 00:01:35.012
SMILEY: Aren't you concerned
about her life?

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:38.223
JESSICA: You can't kill her,
because it's still possible for her

00:01:38.307 --> 00:01:40.892
to be fully adaptable.

00:01:40.976 --> 00:01:45.939
But I will never let her be yours.
I swear I'll save her someday.

00:01:46.023 --> 00:01:50.319
You're neither human nor machine.
You're nothing but a sex doll.

00:01:50.402 --> 00:01:54.948
You can't love anyone, no one loves you.
You'll never have a child.

00:01:55.532 --> 00:01:58.952
I'm going to overcome my fate. Kill her.

00:01:59.536 --> 00:02:01.955
Charlotte... You...

00:02:04.541 --> 00:02:06.418
(gunshots)

00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:10.005
JESSICA: <i>Please, save my daughter.</i>

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.300
<i>Black Rock Shooter.</i>

00:02:19.264 --> 00:02:23.060
You should forget about your mother
who tried to kill her own daughter.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.686
Don't worry.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.900
You will fight for me, and someday,
you will conceive my child.

00:02:30.275 --> 00:02:34.738
Only I can love you
whether you'll be a Hemiteos Unit or not.

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:36.198
(gasps)

00:02:39.034 --> 00:02:40.744
Schoolmaster Smiley.

00:02:42.037 --> 00:02:44.039
("ASEED" by ZAQ playing)

00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:17.757
The experience of almost being killed
by her own mother traumatized her deeply.

00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:21.470
She was moved to tears by my love,
and pledged her lifelong loyalty to me.

00:04:21.553 --> 00:04:25.265
So that's how you completed
her brainwashing?

00:04:25.348 --> 00:04:28.268
(chuckles)
What a plotter!

00:04:30.353 --> 00:04:32.314
Did you call for me?

00:04:33.023 --> 00:04:37.944
Those guys made it to Cartagena.
They'll reach the Orbital Elevator soon.

00:04:38.028 --> 00:04:40.363
Yes, I knew that.

00:04:40.447 --> 00:04:43.950
Well, if you don't do something,
they'll topple the Tower of God.

00:04:44.534 --> 00:04:47.412
Although, my actual body's on the moon,

00:04:47.496 --> 00:04:51.333
and I don't care at all about equipment
on the Earth being destroyed.

00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:53.293
Just rebuild and it's all okay.

00:04:53.877 --> 00:04:56.797
We'll destroy the whole Earth
someday, anyway.

00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:00.550
CHARLOTTE: Schoolmaster Smiley.

00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:04.179
I promise I will kill Empress.

00:05:04.262 --> 00:05:07.849
Then we have to find
Light House Number Eight.

00:05:07.933 --> 00:05:09.559
CHARLOTTE: I don't take orders from you.

00:05:09.643 --> 00:05:13.980
If you go to Light House Number Eight,
you can become a complete Hemiteos Unit.

00:05:14.064 --> 00:05:15.065
(gasps)

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:20.570
You should hurry. That's the goal
of Black Rock Shooter and the others.

00:05:20.654 --> 00:05:22.197
(grunts)

00:05:30.622 --> 00:05:33.583
COLONEL: Empress still has a high fever.

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:35.377
According to Black Trike,

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.963
the only solution
is to recalibrate her body.

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:41.758
There's no other choice
but to look for Light House Number Eight.

00:05:41.842 --> 00:05:45.554
The Orbital Elevator is close by now.
We didn't need this detour.

00:05:50.642 --> 00:05:54.229
WOMAN: <i>From Earth to the moon,</i>
<i>then into space.</i>

00:05:54.312 --> 00:05:57.482
<i>Elysion Project has commenced.</i>

00:06:01.403 --> 00:06:05.115
Hello.
Welcome to Light House Number Eight.

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:06.616
Oh...

00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:11.162
Can I ask you your name?

00:06:11.246 --> 00:06:12.873
I don't have a name.

00:06:12.956 --> 00:06:14.624
(gasps)

00:06:14.708 --> 00:06:17.210
JESSICA: Then pick a card.

00:06:20.255 --> 00:06:22.549
A name will connect you to the world.

00:06:22.674 --> 00:06:25.844
And connect people to other people.

00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:31.349
I'm Jessica.
I'm a teacher at this orphanage.

00:06:31.433 --> 00:06:32.809
Jessica.

00:06:32.893 --> 00:06:37.272
Yes. Why don't you show me your card
that will decide your name?

00:06:38.648 --> 00:06:39.733
Here.

00:06:40.358 --> 00:06:44.279
JESSICA: Wow! This is the Empress card
with very good meanings,

00:06:44.362 --> 00:06:46.656
-like happiness, love...
-COLONEL: <i>Empress.</i>

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.283
-...and prosperity.
-COLONEL: <i>Empress.</i>

00:06:50.368 --> 00:06:53.288
-(gasps)
-She's awake.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.040
Where are we?

00:06:55.624 --> 00:06:59.252
COLONEL: This city used to be Bogota,
the capital of Colombia.

00:07:01.546 --> 00:07:04.382
MONICA: Really, it's totally desolate.

00:07:04.466 --> 00:07:06.635
COLONEL:
It's the home city of the Elevator.

00:07:06.718 --> 00:07:09.888
Too many drones around
for humans to live here.

00:07:10.597 --> 00:07:14.476
We got here following your directions.
Are you sure this is the place?

00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:17.646
BLACK TRIKE: <i>Yes.</i>
<i>According to the salvaged data,</i>

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:20.899
<i>there's a building registered</i>
<i>by the name Light House Number Eight</i>

00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:23.068
<i>in the center of town.</i>

00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:26.446
EMPRESS: If we go there,
I might be able to find out

00:07:26.529 --> 00:07:30.241
what my mission is,
and what Hemiteos Units really are.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.703
Quiet down, pay attention.

00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:37.040
By DNA computer analysis,
Hemiteos Units...

00:07:37.123 --> 00:07:38.500
Were you transferred here?

00:07:38.583 --> 00:07:40.001
What...

00:07:40.585 --> 00:07:43.046
From today,
we'll be training partners, I'm told.

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:45.590
I'm Empress, and you are?

00:07:46.424 --> 00:07:48.635
I'm a demon.

00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:51.429
They say my horns are weird,
like a monster.

00:07:52.597 --> 00:07:56.017
I think your horns are cool,
like a deer in the woods.

00:07:56.101 --> 00:07:58.019
(gasps)

00:07:58.728 --> 00:07:59.646
(chuckles)

00:08:00.397 --> 00:08:01.564
DEAD MASTER: An angel.

00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:05.944
Never mind, it's nothing.
But I don't have a name.

00:08:06.027 --> 00:08:08.071
Then pick a card.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.328
DEAD MASTER: "Death."

00:08:15.412 --> 00:08:20.667
Maybe you should be Dead Master.
It sounds cooler than a demon.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.377
-Really?
-Yes.

00:08:25.004 --> 00:08:26.798
I'm Dead Master.

00:08:26.881 --> 00:08:29.175
Mm. So starting from today...

00:08:30.468 --> 00:08:32.721
BOTH: We're on the same team.

00:08:37.392 --> 00:08:39.686
Good morning, my angel.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.731
Where's the Light House?

00:08:42.814 --> 00:08:45.358
It's right here.
We're at Light House Number Eight.

00:08:45.442 --> 00:08:46.276
What?

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:48.653
DEAD MASTER: It seems
to have collapsed in the war.

00:08:48.737 --> 00:08:52.991
We strolled around the facility.
There is no info on Hemiteos Units.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.243
But why...

00:08:55.326 --> 00:08:59.414
STRENGTH: Well, if Hemiteos Units
were mankind's secret weapon,

00:08:59.497 --> 00:09:02.125
I guess Lunatic's gang
wouldn't leave this place alone.

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:05.170
DEAD MASTER: Are you here
to make wisecracks, you hooligan?

00:09:05.253 --> 00:09:07.297
STRENGTH: What did you say?
It's just the opposite.

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.966
I came to say I found a clue.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:12.761
This isn't Light House?

00:09:12.844 --> 00:09:18.349
Don't you think an orphanage would be
too out in the open for secret research?

00:09:18.433 --> 00:09:23.354
So you think the research lab
for Hemiteos Units is somewhere else?

00:09:23.938 --> 00:09:25.440
That's right.

00:09:27.025 --> 00:09:29.152
Your deployment has been decided.

00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:33.156
They'll give us the details later.

EMPRESS: <i>Our duty was mainly to guard.</i>

DEAD MASTER: Light House Number Eight

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:52.217
was an experimental lab
for creating top-quality soldiers.

00:09:52.801 --> 00:09:54.969
Were we so easily deceived?

00:09:55.053 --> 00:09:57.972
I don't think they deceived us.

00:09:58.431 --> 00:10:01.851
If I hadn't come here,
I would have died long ago.

00:10:01.935 --> 00:10:06.523
I thought my life was over
when I lost both of my arms.

00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:11.528
When I became a Hemiteos Unit,
I got these big arms. Not bad, actually.

00:10:12.112 --> 00:10:14.197
DEAD MASTER: Who are we going to fight?

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.283
If we battle humans,
we'll have to kill humans.

00:10:17.367 --> 00:10:20.411
I don't care who. I'll kill them all.

00:10:20.995 --> 00:10:23.915
I'm Strength. I'm absolute power.

00:10:24.582 --> 00:10:27.794
They said our powers
are something special.

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:32.006
If that's true,
what's important is not who we fight.

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:35.885
It's what we're fighting for,
and that is our choice.

00:10:35.969 --> 00:10:38.513
Then what are you going to fight for?

00:10:38.596 --> 00:10:40.974
EMPRESS: I want to fight
to protect those I care for.

00:10:41.474 --> 00:10:45.270
What? Do you have
someone you care for other than me?

00:10:45.353 --> 00:10:47.188
Isn't that irrelevant?

00:10:47.272 --> 00:10:51.192
EMPRESS: It's Jessica.
I don't want to disappoint her.

00:10:51.776 --> 00:10:54.154
Oh, the teacher. I see.

00:10:58.158 --> 00:11:02.912
Of course, I care for you two as well.
If it's for my friends, I'm able to fight.

MONICA:
It seems to be some kind of laboratory.

All of the electric power in this mine

00:12:08.353 --> 00:12:09.520
Huh?

00:12:13.149 --> 00:12:14.567
MONICA: What could this be?

00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:18.071
There's something tucked
between the tarot cards.

00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:21.574
A high-capacity storage medium.

00:12:22.242 --> 00:12:24.118
I guess I should play it back, huh?

00:12:24.244 --> 00:12:25.078

You mean, the Colonel's wife?

I know this person.

COLONEL: It's definitely her. Jessica.

MONICA: But, Colonel, did you know
your wife was a Hemiteos Unit?

00:13:00.571 --> 00:13:02.490
No, it's news to me, too.

00:13:02.573 --> 00:13:04.826
Should I play the rest?

00:13:04.909 --> 00:13:07.870
Let's watch it.
I want to know the truth, too.

00:13:08.871 --> 00:13:09.747

<i>Elysion Project's purpose was to build</i>
<i>a semipermanent infrastructure.</i>

00:13:19.048 --> 00:13:24.429
<i>I assisted the Peacebuilding Force's</i>
<i>research into creating ultimate soldiers.</i>

00:13:25.054 --> 00:13:28.474
<i>They were called Hemiteos Units,</i>
<i>at Light House Number Eight,</i>

00:13:28.558 --> 00:13:30.476
<i>and I was a trial subject.</i>

<i>Code Name, Stella.</i>

00:13:32.812 --> 00:13:36.482
<i>But my Hemiteos modifications failed,</i>
<i>because I was too old.</i>

00:13:36.733 --> 00:13:40.653
<i>So to acquire girls of adequate age,</i>
<i>which were teenagers, many orphanages</i>

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.865
<i>called Light Houses</i>
<i>were built around the world.</i>

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:48.536
<i>And complete and functional</i>
<i>Hemiteos Units were created.</i>

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:52.373
<i>But right around that time,</i>
<i>Artemis' uprising began.</i>

00:13:52.874 --> 00:13:55.918
<i>Hemiteos Units that existed</i>
<i>to guard the project</i>

00:13:56.252 --> 00:13:59.088
<i>were sent to the front lines</i>
<i>and died in the battles.</i>

00:13:59.505 --> 00:14:02.258
<i>Only three high-performance</i>
<i>Units survived.</i>

00:14:02.341 --> 00:14:06.512
<i>They were Empress,</i>
<i>Dead Master, and Strength.</i>

00:14:07.597 --> 00:14:09.724
<i>As the war situation deteriorated,</i>

00:14:09.807 --> 00:14:12.018
<i>initial specimens like me</i>
<i>were to be recalibrated.</i>

<i>But Empress' team was defeated</i>
<i>before that happened,</i>

00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:18.316
<i>and the Peacebuilding Force lost the war.</i>

00:14:19.233 --> 00:14:22.195
<i>The project was canceled,</i>
<i>and the Light Houses were closed.</i>

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:27.158
<i>I hid my identity and started life</i>
<i>as a normal human being.</i>

00:14:29.077 --> 00:14:32.163
<i>I even lied to the man</i>
<i>who became my husband.</i>

00:14:32.747 --> 00:14:37.418
<i>Because anyone who discovered</i>
<i>my secret would be in great danger.</i>

00:14:38.002 --> 00:14:41.923
<i>Yet, my daughter and I were kidnapped</i>
<i>by the Educational Institution.</i>

00:14:42.006 --> 00:14:46.177
<i>That man Smiley said my husband was dead.</i>

00:14:46.761 --> 00:14:50.306
<i>But I don't believe my husband was killed.</i>

00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:53.684
<i>So if you meet my husband,</i>
<i>I want you to tell him...</i>

00:14:55.061 --> 00:14:58.856

<i>They tried to force me</i>
<i>to create a Hemiteos Unit.</i>

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:26.843
<i>My daughter, Charlotte,</i>
<i>was the subject of the experiment.</i>

00:15:27.343 --> 00:15:28.177

<i>I'll let my daughter escape</i>
<i>during the system disruption.</i>

00:15:36.394 --> 00:15:40.273
<i>I firmly believe that this record</i>
<i>and my daughter will make it out.</i>

00:15:40.356 --> 00:15:43.609
<i>And if this video is found,</i>

00:15:44.318 --> 00:15:47.113
<i>that means you came back, Empress.</i>

00:15:47.196 --> 00:15:48.573

<i>You fought but finally lost to Lunatic.</i>

JESSICA: <i>You were wounded and disappeared.</i>

00:16:01.794 --> 00:16:05.298
<i>But I knew you would reappear someday.</i>

00:16:06.507 --> 00:16:09.218
<i>Welcome back to our home.</i>

00:16:10.928 --> 00:16:12.597
I'm home.

00:16:14.182 --> 00:16:18.186
<i>I couldn't prevent you girls</i>

<i>I knew you would be hurt,</i>
<i>but I closed my eyes to it.</i>

00:16:21.731 --> 00:16:26.652
<i>Still, I'm begging you.</i>
<i>If I fail to help my daughter, Charlotte.</i>

00:16:27.278 --> 00:16:28.779
<i>Please save her.</i>

00:16:30.364 --> 00:16:32.033
Jessica.

00:16:32.116 --> 00:16:34.035
JESSICA: <i>I'm entrusting this to you.</i>

00:16:42.585 --> 00:16:47.506
<i>The Hemiteos proteins in your body</i>
<i>can be recalibrated by entering this pod.</i>

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:49.133
That means...

00:16:49.717 --> 00:16:54.639
<i>This pod has the capability to enhance</i>
<i>or erase the power of the Hemiteos Units.</i>

00:16:55.223 --> 00:16:59.227
<i>Empress, you have the freedom</i>
<i>to choose either option.</i>

00:17:01.646 --> 00:17:05.483
It seems that this device only
has enough battery power to be used once.

00:17:05.566 --> 00:17:10.780
If we use it to recalibrate Empress,
Charlotte's powers can't be erased.

00:17:10.863 --> 00:17:12.240
Mm.

00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:15.243
Start the recalibration of Empress.

00:17:15.326 --> 00:17:16.452
But--

00:17:16.535 --> 00:17:18.704
We're not out of options.

00:17:18.788 --> 00:17:23.793
Lunatic said it would be a problem
if Charlotte was abducted from them.

00:17:23.876 --> 00:17:27.088
If Charlotte
was a perfectly brainwashed Hemiteos Unit,

00:17:27.171 --> 00:17:29.215
that shouldn't be a problem.

00:17:29.298 --> 00:17:30.716
I'll secure the area.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:31.968
EMPRESS: Colonel.

00:17:33.553 --> 00:17:35.972
I promise I'll save Charlotte.

00:17:38.307 --> 00:17:41.978
Finish as quickly as possible.
We don't have time to waste now.

00:17:43.062 --> 00:17:43.938

COLONEL: How's Empress?

00:19:41.347 --> 00:19:45.017
Still recalibrating. It might take
at least another ten minutes.

00:19:45.101 --> 00:19:49.563
Damn it. I'll protect this area.
You go treat the wounded soldiers.

00:19:50.147 --> 00:19:51.482
Okay, sir!

Great aim. You should be
an ace pitcher for the New York Yankees.

What are you talking about?
You're being creepy.

00:20:22.638 --> 00:20:26.350
It doesn't look like
I can get through to you.

Let me through or I'll kill you.

00:20:30.354 --> 00:20:31.897
Although I'll kill you either way.

00:20:31.981 --> 00:20:32.898
I refuse.

00:20:33.482 --> 00:20:36.026
