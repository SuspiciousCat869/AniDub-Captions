They're Artemis' human hunting drones.

With your ability,
perhaps you can safely escape with her.

-No.
-What?

00:11:42.076 --> 00:11:46.331
Either we all die, or we all survive.

We've confirmed that the Hemiteos Unit

Your Education Institution's forces

Look, in front!

00:15:19.127 --> 00:15:21.212
BLACK TRIKE: <i>Gravel Mode.</i>

00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:31.556
<i>Frick!</i>

00:15:38.437 --> 00:15:41.149
<i>Tarmac Mode.</i>

00:15:41.732 --> 00:15:44.902
What kind of bike is this?
Why are you so strong?

00:15:44.986 --> 00:15:47.446
I don't know. What is this bike?

00:15:47.572 --> 00:15:49.157
BLACK TRIKE: <i>I'm Black Trike,</i>

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.534
<i>a highly advanced</i>
<i>Hemiteos Unit Assist Vehicle.</i>

00:15:51.617 --> 00:15:55.413
<i>I'm honored to serve you, Empress.</i>

00:15:55.997 --> 00:15:58.416
NORITO: You're "Empress"?
That's a weird name.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:15:59.876
I'm...

00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:04.881
-(blasts)
-(gasps)

00:16:13.139 --> 00:16:16.559
Another one. Who is it this time?

00:16:18.144 --> 00:16:21.105
Peacebuilding Force. All the way out here?

00:16:24.942 --> 00:16:29.113
-There's no doubt. That must be her.
-SUBORDINATE: She's already being pursued.

00:16:29.197 --> 00:16:30.114
(grunts)

00:16:30.198 --> 00:16:32.867
It just looks like she's a kid
protecting some other kids.

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:34.368
(explosion)

00:16:34.452 --> 00:16:35.870
Goddammit.

00:16:35.953 --> 00:16:38.456
(weapon firing)

00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:44.253
He got them! Wow!

00:16:48.633 --> 00:16:51.219
(engines revving)

00:17:00.811 --> 00:17:04.649
You must be "Black Rock Shooter" Empress.

00:17:04.732 --> 00:17:06.025
Who are you?

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:07.985
They call me Colonel.

00:17:08.986 --> 00:17:10.071
Is that your name?

00:17:10.154 --> 00:17:11.989
Of course not.

00:17:12.323 --> 00:17:13.407
It isn't?

00:17:13.491 --> 00:17:18.412
You're a survivor of the Hemiteos Unit,
guardians of the human race.

00:17:18.496 --> 00:17:19.914
COLONEL: Empress.

00:17:20.498 --> 00:17:25.378
The Peacebuilding Force's network
picked up your reboot pulse.

00:17:25.461 --> 00:17:26.671
(gasps)

00:17:28.589 --> 00:17:30.258
Why do you look confused?

00:17:31.467 --> 00:17:35.096
NORITO: She lost her memory.
She is confused.

00:17:35.346 --> 00:17:37.014
COLONEL: What the hell?

00:17:37.598 --> 00:17:40.393
I don't know how confused you are,

00:17:40.977 --> 00:17:45.648
but you should be able to see how bad
this world has become by this landscape.

00:17:46.857 --> 00:17:51.028
Long ago, through the efforts
of several supranational corporations,

00:17:51.237 --> 00:17:56.242
Project Elysion started, which was
for large-scale automation of labor.

00:17:56.867 --> 00:17:59.161
And it failed?

00:17:59.245 --> 00:18:00.162
Exactly.

00:18:00.746 --> 00:18:04.667
The core system of Project Elysion,
an artificial intelligence called Artemis

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:07.128
<i>chose war against the human race.</i>

00:18:07.712 --> 00:18:11.132
The reasons are too complicated
to explain now, so I'll skip it.

00:18:11.716 --> 00:18:14.760
COLONEL: Artemis and its Unmanned Forces

00:18:15.011 --> 00:18:19.015
are currently building an Orbital Elevator
to connect Earth with the moon.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.225
When it's completed,

00:18:21.392 --> 00:18:25.730
huge machines being mass-produced
on the moon will come here in full force.

00:18:26.522 --> 00:18:29.900
So the completion
of the Orbital Elevator is the time limit.

00:18:30.651 --> 00:18:31.902
I don't get it.

00:18:32.403 --> 00:18:36.073
What does that have to do with me?

00:18:37.033 --> 00:18:42.246
You're going to destroy that Elevator
while it's under construction, Empress.

00:18:43.247 --> 00:18:45.666
That's what you were born to do.

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:46.792
Uh...

00:18:46.876 --> 00:18:48.002
(machine roaring)

00:18:48.085 --> 00:18:49.253
There!

00:18:54.133 --> 00:18:58.012
COLONEL: This is not good.
It's pretty large, so let's move.

00:18:58.095 --> 00:18:59.221
EMPRESS: Move?

00:18:59.472 --> 00:19:03.559
That's not a small fry like before.
The weapons we have won't be enough.

00:19:04.393 --> 00:19:07.104
COLONEL: Those kids will slow us down.
Leave them here.

00:19:07.188 --> 00:19:08.356
(Norito and Miya gasp)

00:19:08.856 --> 00:19:11.108
Where do you live?

00:19:11.192 --> 00:19:12.360
Hey!

00:19:12.443 --> 00:19:14.862
There's a mountain
a few kilometers from here.

00:19:14.987 --> 00:19:18.616
The remaining survivors live there
in the hollowed-out fortified city.

00:19:18.699 --> 00:19:20.618
I'll take you home.

00:19:26.582 --> 00:19:29.460
I'm only trying to help, you know.

00:19:30.211 --> 00:19:33.089
I don't want to abandon anybody.

00:19:33.964 --> 00:19:37.009
Being abandoned cuts deep.

00:19:37.551 --> 00:19:39.220
You...

00:19:39.303 --> 00:19:40.471
(blasts)

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:42.848
(weapon firing)

00:19:44.934 --> 00:19:46.268
(grunts)

00:19:47.895 --> 00:19:49.188
Hurry, go after her.

00:19:54.193 --> 00:19:56.195
(action music)

00:20:10.835 --> 00:20:12.837
-Hey!
-(groans)

00:20:17.258 --> 00:20:18.426
COLONEL: Goddammit.

00:20:19.802 --> 00:20:22.138
Nothing's going right.

00:20:25.766 --> 00:20:27.935
(zooming)

00:20:31.647 --> 00:20:33.649
(dramatic music)

00:20:48.748 --> 00:20:49.957
BLACK TRIKE: <i>Holy...</i>

00:20:51.625 --> 00:20:53.252
Are you okay, Miya?

00:20:53.419 --> 00:20:54.920
Norito.

00:20:57.882 --> 00:20:59.884
(thrilling music)

00:21:03.137 --> 00:21:06.056
Now, I remember
just a little bit how to do it.

00:21:08.142 --> 00:21:09.310
(gasps)

00:21:16.942 --> 00:21:19.361
You can manipulate Arche?

00:21:19.445 --> 00:21:20.613
(whirs)

00:21:20.696 --> 00:21:22.531
(clicking)

00:21:24.283 --> 00:21:25.868
(electricity crackles)

00:21:25.951 --> 00:21:27.286
(zapping)

00:21:29.872 --> 00:21:31.290
(explosion)

00:21:31.373 --> 00:21:32.541
Incredible.

00:21:37.004 --> 00:21:37.922
(gasps)

00:21:38.005 --> 00:21:39.924
(growls)

00:21:40.007 --> 00:21:41.801
It's still moving.

00:21:46.055 --> 00:21:46.972
BOTH: No!

00:21:49.183 --> 00:21:51.393
(engine revving)

00:22:01.904 --> 00:22:03.072
(gasps)

00:22:09.078 --> 00:22:10.871
Hey, Empress.

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:16.210
(closing theme music)
