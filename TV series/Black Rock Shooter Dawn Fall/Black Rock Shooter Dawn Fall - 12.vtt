WEBVTT

00:00:01.585 --> 00:00:05.506
LUNATIC: First, I'll annihilate humans,
then recreate the Earth.

00:00:05.797 --> 00:00:09.635
I'll wait for tens of millions of years
for new civilizations to emerge.

00:00:10.052 --> 00:00:15.224
Meanwhile, I'll be hiding myself,
observing humans like a god.

00:00:15.307 --> 00:00:19.728
And after I collect enough data,
I'll do the same thing all over again.

00:00:20.896 --> 00:00:21.939
(chuckles)

00:00:22.898 --> 00:00:24.900
(suspenseful music)

00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:29.446
STRENGTH: There are fewer enemies
to fight now.

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.198
Fewer on our side, too.

00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:32.574
Although for us...

00:00:33.242 --> 00:00:35.827
As long as Empress is alive,
we'll be all right.

00:00:35.911 --> 00:00:37.621
STRENGTH: Exactly my thoughts.

00:00:40.165 --> 00:00:42.668
You must be able to understand by now.

00:00:43.085 --> 00:00:46.046
Although we're different in a way
that I'm an AI and you're a Hemiteos Unit,

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.550
we're the same in a way
that we'll both live forever.

00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:51.551
We should band together and cooperate.

00:00:52.177 --> 00:00:56.807
For someone who thinks they're so smart,
you're saying something so foolish.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.392
Huh?

00:00:59.226 --> 00:01:02.312
Hemiteos Units
are the guardians of the humans.

00:01:02.396 --> 00:01:04.231
You still don't get it?

00:01:04.314 --> 00:01:07.025
It's just the current human race
that will die off.

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:10.988
Eventually, an ideal evolutionary tree
will form.

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:13.365
The Earth will become better.

00:01:13.448 --> 00:01:18.870
The people I've met are more important
than the Earth you're trying to remake.

00:01:18.954 --> 00:01:21.039
(grunts)
Never mind, then.

00:01:21.123 --> 00:01:22.666
Hemiteos Units have a fault

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:26.086
of being swayed by emotions in the end,
because they're half-human.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.547
It was destiny that I would fight.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.675
Can I ask you one last question?

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:33.176
What?

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.970
How many Moon Flakes
are you going to launch?

00:01:35.637 --> 00:01:36.471
Five thousand in all.

00:01:36.555 --> 00:01:39.057
They'll be raining down
on Earth in sequence.

00:01:39.141 --> 00:01:40.684
Five thousand.

00:01:41.393 --> 00:01:42.936
They're being launched in sequence.

00:01:44.521 --> 00:01:45.480
Huh?

00:01:46.898 --> 00:01:48.900
I'll fight until the end.

00:01:48.984 --> 00:01:52.362
If I can stop even one from launching,
it'll be worth it.

00:01:52.446 --> 00:01:54.740
(gasping)

00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:56.950
(chuckles)

00:01:57.034 --> 00:02:00.120
For that to happen,
you'll have to defeat me.

00:02:00.912 --> 00:02:03.623
EMPRESS: That's why I'm here.

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:09.338
Colonel, head to the Orbital Elevator.
I'll be there right away.

00:02:09.421 --> 00:02:12.090
Right. I'll leave this to you.

00:02:12.174 --> 00:02:14.968
(zapping)

00:02:15.052 --> 00:02:16.094
(blasts)

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.808
BLACK TRIKE: <i>Here I come!</i>

00:02:21.892 --> 00:02:22.809
You're late.

00:02:22.893 --> 00:02:26.355
<i>You seem to be enjoying</i>
<i>your conversation with Lunatic.</i>

00:02:26.438 --> 00:02:28.106
<i>Hey!</i>

00:02:30.192 --> 00:02:32.694
(action music)

00:02:32.778 --> 00:02:34.112
(panting)

00:02:35.697 --> 00:02:37.366
(blasts)

00:02:41.536 --> 00:02:43.872
(weapon firing)

00:02:50.921 --> 00:02:53.090
(panting)

00:02:58.679 --> 00:02:59.596
(gasps)

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:04.601
Why are you two siblings
in a place like this?

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:08.647
Why? Because we were worried
about all of you.

00:03:09.231 --> 00:03:11.775
MONICA: Past this point,
it's a genuine battlefield.

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:13.735
There's nothing that we can do.

00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:15.445
I still want to go there.

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:17.406
Can't we at least deliver
some extra ammunition?

00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:23.912
Darn it! Norito, I'll go with you.
Miya can't come, though.

00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:25.372
What?

00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:28.792
I'll come back for you later.
Hide behind those rocks and wait.

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:32.879
NORITO: If we don't come back,
you should return to town.

00:03:32.963 --> 00:03:34.256
(sighs)

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:35.507
Okay.

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.268
(weapons firing)

00:03:47.185 --> 00:03:48.145
(explosion)

00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:50.397
SUBORDINATE 1: <i>They've found</i>
<i>our artillery base.</i>

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.068
<i>Fatal damage by tank class enemy.</i>
<i>Impossible to continue the mission.</i>

00:03:55.152 --> 00:03:57.279
<i>Best of luck to the assault team.</i>

00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:03.702
<i>The vehicle unit's assault has failed.</i>
<i>The Second Battalion has been annihilated.</i>

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:05.829
<i>I repeat. The assault has failed.</i>

00:04:05.912 --> 00:04:08.206
<i>Division HQ was destroyed.</i>

00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:11.293
<i>Survivors from the Battalion HQ</i>
<i>should take over the chain of command.</i>

00:04:11.376 --> 00:04:13.545
(panting)

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:18.049
Just one bullet left, huh?

00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:29.060
Looks like luck hasn't abandoned me yet.

00:04:29.144 --> 00:04:32.105
(weapons firing)

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:36.276
Out of the way, you scraps of iron!

00:04:40.155 --> 00:04:42.365
(groaning)

00:04:45.202 --> 00:04:46.703
(whirring)

00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:52.083
COLONEL: Charlotte!

00:04:56.922 --> 00:04:58.673
(explosion)

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:02.052
Not done yet.

00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:07.557
God... darn it.

00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:14.856
Bastards. You did this!

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.404
(zaps)

00:05:22.197 --> 00:05:23.615
-(groans)
-(gasps)

00:05:24.825 --> 00:05:25.784
Dad...

00:05:27.285 --> 00:05:29.496
(screams)

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:31.039
Dad!

00:05:31.122 --> 00:05:33.124
(groaning)

00:05:33.208 --> 00:05:34.459
No.

00:05:34.543 --> 00:05:38.046
Just when we finally became family again.

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:39.214
(groans)

00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:41.800
Dad. I'm sorry.

00:05:42.217 --> 00:05:44.469
There's nothing to apologize for.

00:05:44.553 --> 00:05:49.224
I'm the one who should apologize.
I'm sorry that I have to die here.

00:05:49.307 --> 00:05:50.725
Dad.

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:53.979
What are you doing?

00:05:54.062 --> 00:05:56.565
Let's retreat together for now.

00:05:57.107 --> 00:06:00.777
No, don't. I beg of you.

00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:03.321
If we can get to where
the combat medic is,

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.282
maybe they can help you.

00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:09.536
Please, Charlotte. Don't mind me.

00:06:12.581 --> 00:06:14.541
COLONEL: All right, Charlotte.
I'll tell you what.

00:06:15.584 --> 00:06:17.294
If we're going back to the rear,

00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:21.256
can you bring me
the thermobaric anti-tank missile?

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:26.261
I don't want to leave it unattended.
It's in that vehicle.

00:06:27.012 --> 00:06:28.763
(breathes sharply)
I'll do it.

00:06:29.848 --> 00:06:32.267
(somber music)

00:06:40.025 --> 00:06:42.694
COLONEL: I want you to survive, Charlotte.

00:06:44.362 --> 00:06:48.533
There's hope left for the human race.
Don't let it go.

00:06:48.617 --> 00:06:49.951
(breathes heavily)

00:06:51.036 --> 00:06:53.204
I will always love you.

00:06:53.288 --> 00:06:54.205
-Dad.
-(gunshot)

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:55.206
(gasps)

00:06:56.791 --> 00:06:57.834
Dad!

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:00.920
-(blasts)
-(yelps)

00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:04.174
(gasps)

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:07.385
(buzzes)

00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:09.888
-(crashes)
-(tires screech)

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:18.730
MONICA: Charlotte!

00:07:20.482 --> 00:07:21.441
My dad...

00:07:21.524 --> 00:07:23.526
(somber music)

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.321
Colonel.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.244
I... What should I do now?

00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:40.960
Let's live through this.
Your dad would want that, too.

00:07:41.044 --> 00:07:42.462
Huh?

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.219
(Strength yelling)

00:07:54.182 --> 00:07:55.850
What the hell!

00:07:55.934 --> 00:07:57.727
(blasts)

00:07:58.687 --> 00:07:59.854
Strength!

00:07:59.938 --> 00:08:02.899
You go ahead
to where Empress is without me.

00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:04.901
No, I can't do that, Strength.

00:08:04.984 --> 00:08:07.654
Who do you think I am, huh?

00:08:07.737 --> 00:08:10.657
Don't die, Strength.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:15.662
(sobbing)
I... I'm scared. But...

00:08:15.745 --> 00:08:19.666
(shouting)

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.627
SUBORDINATE 2: All men, back up Empress!

00:08:22.711 --> 00:08:25.630
Get her to the Orbital Elevator
at all costs!

00:08:26.423 --> 00:08:27.632
(weapon fires)

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:29.551
(blasts)

00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:49.779
I finally got this far.

00:08:51.031 --> 00:08:52.741
(gasps)

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:55.201
BLACK TRIKE: <i>Empress!</i>

00:08:58.288 --> 00:08:59.456
Black Trike.

00:09:02.042 --> 00:09:03.168
(laughs)

00:09:03.251 --> 00:09:05.420
Who cares about a piece of junk like that?

00:09:06.796 --> 00:09:09.424
Black Trike is not a piece of junk.

00:09:09.507 --> 00:09:12.427
It's my dear friend.

00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:14.554
Overdrive Key.

00:09:16.139 --> 00:09:17.307
Ignition.

00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:20.935
(both grunting)

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:31.237
Okay, that's it.

00:09:32.072 --> 00:09:36.242
Empress using the Overdrive Key
is as strong as I predicted.

00:09:37.994 --> 00:09:39.287
Pretty good job.

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:43.249
But this is really the end
of your anguish-filled life.

00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:46.211
And now the death and rebirth
of the human race will begin.

00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:50.965
Huh?

00:09:52.383 --> 00:09:54.969
Don't get cocky, you rotten computer.

00:09:55.053 --> 00:09:57.222
Dead Master!

00:09:57.305 --> 00:09:58.723
(weapon fires)

00:10:03.061 --> 00:10:04.479
Darn it.

00:10:04.562 --> 00:10:06.564
-(groans)
-(zapping)

00:10:07.857 --> 00:10:11.778
I've already regenerated.
You're no match for me.

00:10:11.861 --> 00:10:13.404
(groans in pain)

00:10:17.992 --> 00:10:19.410
What an inconvenient body.

00:10:20.745 --> 00:10:21.913
Empress.

00:10:24.749 --> 00:10:26.292
I love you.

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.838
-Take that.
-(zaps)

00:10:30.922 --> 00:10:31.923
(gasps)

00:10:32.757 --> 00:10:34.926
Everyone who was in the way
is gone at last.

00:10:35.969 --> 00:10:37.178
(grunts)

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:49.399
Norito.

00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:51.234
-(rumbling)
-Huh?

00:10:52.861 --> 00:10:53.736
(Miya gasps)

00:11:00.618 --> 00:11:02.954
This battle is almost finished.

00:11:03.371 --> 00:11:05.498
It's the end of the human race.

00:11:05.582 --> 00:11:07.959
Well, they tried hard.
I'll give them that.

00:11:08.626 --> 00:11:12.589
LUNATIC: Empress, you no longer have
a reason to fight. Don't you agree?

00:11:13.006 --> 00:11:16.593
You, Hemiteos Units,
were born to protect the human race.

00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:20.471
But those humans are almost all dead.

00:11:22.056 --> 00:11:27.437
Anyway, what you're seeing is an avatar
of my actual body on the moon.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.522
It's meaningless to destroy my avatar.

00:11:29.606 --> 00:11:32.942
Whatever you do,
it won't reach me on the moon.

00:11:34.444 --> 00:11:37.030
-EMPRESS: What you said was right.
-LUNATIC: Hm?

00:11:38.031 --> 00:11:40.241
If there are no humans left,

00:11:40.325 --> 00:11:43.536
there's no reason
for Hemiteos Units to exist.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.538
Everyone knows that.

00:11:45.622 --> 00:11:48.166
Then I don't mind dying here.

00:11:48.249 --> 00:11:49.167
(gasps)

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:55.882
(screaming)

00:11:55.965 --> 00:11:59.636
Your body won't be able to stand it
if you go over that threshold.

00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:09.896
(screaming continues)

00:12:13.942 --> 00:12:15.944
(thrilling music)

00:12:17.779 --> 00:12:18.696
(gasps)

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:20.198
NORITO: Is that...

00:12:21.366 --> 00:12:22.784
Empress?

00:12:23.826 --> 00:12:24.786
Stupid.

00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:33.920
-Do it!
-Shatter it into pieces, Empress!

00:12:34.003 --> 00:12:36.005
Black Rock Shooter!

00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:38.258
(blasts, trills)

00:12:38.341 --> 00:12:40.635
I guess I'll let you beat me this time.

00:12:40.718 --> 00:12:42.178
(blasts)

00:13:00.071 --> 00:13:03.449
EMPRESS: Oh, there were humans left.

00:13:18.339 --> 00:13:22.010
I... feel so happy now.

00:13:32.562 --> 00:13:36.024
Everyone's dead.
The machine army's gone somewhere, too.

00:13:36.607 --> 00:13:38.276
What are you going to do now?

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:40.528
The meteors are still falling.

00:13:41.112 --> 00:13:44.490
First, I'll pick up Miya,
then we can evacuate to safety.

00:13:45.158 --> 00:13:46.534
How about you, Monica?

00:13:46.617 --> 00:13:48.786
It might take some time, but...

00:13:50.121 --> 00:13:54.584
the merciless queen is still on the moon.
We need to prepare.

00:13:58.421 --> 00:14:01.049
LUNATIC: <i>The Orbital Elevator</i>
<i>and other related facilities</i>

00:14:01.132 --> 00:14:04.510
<i>for recreating the Earth</i>
<i>suffered great damage.</i>

00:14:05.595 --> 00:14:08.473
<i>Due to the disruption of the transport</i>
<i>of the Iron Ocean,</i>

00:14:08.556 --> 00:14:12.435
<i>the launch of 906 Moon Flakes</i>
<i>was canceled.</i>

00:14:12.852 --> 00:14:15.813
<i>A fatal error occurred in the operation.</i>

00:14:15.897 --> 00:14:20.401
But still, more than 70%
of the Earth's organisms died.

00:14:20.943 --> 00:14:22.779
<i>I consider that a sufficient achievement.</i>

00:14:22.862 --> 00:14:24.197
<i>The plan needs a major adjustment.</i>

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.199

00:14:37.418 --> 00:14:38.961
So approximately 200 years.

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.675
It's only a moment in time for me.

00:14:45.676 --> 00:14:47.762
<i>I'll just take a rest for a while.</i>

00:14:56.437 --> 00:14:58.481
(wind howling)

00:15:04.529 --> 00:15:06.114
(young girl grunts)

00:15:06.781 --> 00:15:07.740
Here!

00:15:12.328 --> 00:15:14.497
My aim is accurate, isn't it?

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:17.750
Don't throw it so hard. Here.

00:15:20.294 --> 00:15:23.214
You should throw softer, Strength.

00:15:24.298 --> 00:15:25.967
It's Charlotte.

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:29.971
Dead Master, Strength, it's almost time.

00:15:30.054 --> 00:15:31.889
BOTH: Okay!

00:15:31.973 --> 00:15:33.850
(both giggling)

00:15:35.309 --> 00:15:38.688
You two are so good at playing catch.

00:15:39.063 --> 00:15:41.274
You could be Major League players.

00:15:41.357 --> 00:15:42.775
What's that?

00:15:43.526 --> 00:15:45.278
I don't really know, either.

00:15:50.074 --> 00:15:52.118
BLACK TRIKE:
<i>Checking fixed bolt number three. Clear.</i>

00:15:52.577 --> 00:15:54.162
MAN: Checking fixed
bolt number four. Clear.

00:15:54.245 --> 00:15:58.291
<i>That kind of tickles when you do that.</i>

00:15:58.875 --> 00:16:02.336
A large group of armed robbers
was observed in Sacramento.

00:16:02.837 --> 00:16:05.006
Send two companies
from our unit as reinforcements.

00:16:05.089 --> 00:16:06.799
I'll leave the personnel selection
up to you.

00:16:06.883 --> 00:16:07.842
MEN: Roger.

00:16:11.429 --> 00:16:14.390
SUBORDINATE 3: About the negotiations
with the Los Angeles vigilante group...

00:16:14.974 --> 00:16:18.561
We'll deal with that after this launch.
Leave it for now.

00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:20.229
Roger.

00:16:24.942 --> 00:16:26.152
The time has come.

00:16:26.235 --> 00:16:27.570
YOUNG STRENGTH: Norito.

00:16:27.653 --> 00:16:30.198
-Hm?
-(chuckling)

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:34.327
In here, call me Colonel.

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:37.788
It feels funny.
You're our big brother, Norito.

00:16:39.165 --> 00:16:40.333
Where's the Doctor?

00:16:41.042 --> 00:16:42.793
With Miya, I think.

00:16:50.384 --> 00:16:52.303
Doctor, it's almost time.

00:16:53.387 --> 00:16:57.558
Oh, yeah, that's right.
My mind was elsewhere for a minute.

00:16:58.309 --> 00:17:01.229
Are you all right, Miya?
Aren't you nervous?

00:17:01.312 --> 00:17:04.106
It's your first major mission, isn't it?

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:06.359
Yes, it is.

00:17:06.943 --> 00:17:09.195
Long ago,
when the Moon Flakes hit the Earth,

00:17:09.278 --> 00:17:10.947
you suffered a serious injury.

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:17.370
You had to go through a Pseudo Hemiteos
Unit modification to survive.

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:21.207
If you don't want to fight, that's okay.

00:17:21.749 --> 00:17:27.088
I want to protect everybody,
because they protected me in the past.

00:17:27.171 --> 00:17:28.172
I see.

00:17:28.631 --> 00:17:30.091
YOUNG STRENGTH: Oh, there she is.

00:17:30.174 --> 00:17:31.342
YOUNG DEAD MASTER: Dr. Monica.

00:17:31.425 --> 00:17:32.677
What?

00:17:35.179 --> 00:17:37.098
What do you mean, what?

00:17:37.181 --> 00:17:38.933
You asked me to call
Dead Master and Strength,

00:17:39.016 --> 00:17:41.352
because you had something important
to tell them.

00:17:41.978 --> 00:17:43.854
You're right, I did.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.899
We need you to stay in the control tower.

00:17:46.983 --> 00:17:51.028
At this time of the day,
I want to watch the sunset.

00:17:51.195 --> 00:17:52.154
Why?

00:17:55.408 --> 00:17:59.996
MONICA: It reminds me of the best journey
I ever took in my life.

00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:01.038
YOUNG STRENGTH: Journey?

00:18:01.872 --> 00:18:04.542
Well, I'll tell you all about it someday.

00:18:06.085 --> 00:18:07.503
Oh, I just remembered.

00:18:09.589 --> 00:18:13.759
Charlotte, Miya. Each of you, pick a card.

00:18:22.351 --> 00:18:23.769
MONICA: That's Temperance.

00:18:23.853 --> 00:18:27.064
In the upright position,
it means balance and moderation.

00:18:27.648 --> 00:18:28.816
CHARLOTTE: But why?

00:18:28.899 --> 00:18:31.402
They will be your code names
for this mission.

00:18:31.944 --> 00:18:34.488
We haven't decided
on any code names for you yet.

00:18:35.197 --> 00:18:39.327
From today, Temperance will be
the code name we'll use for Charlotte.

00:18:40.202 --> 00:18:41.829
Temperance.

00:18:42.872 --> 00:18:43.831
Roger.

00:18:44.415 --> 00:18:45.833
And for Miya.

00:18:48.377 --> 00:18:51.547
MONICA: Wheel of Fortune
in the upright position.

00:18:52.214 --> 00:18:54.634
It means a turning point.

00:18:54.717 --> 00:18:56.844
In that position,
it means good fortune is coming.

00:18:56.927 --> 00:19:00.806
Perfect for Miya, I think.
Your code name is Fortune.

00:19:02.642 --> 00:19:03.809
Fortune.

00:19:04.977 --> 00:19:07.355
I guess we should go now.

00:19:12.943 --> 00:19:16.947
MONICA: It's hard to believe
I stuck with them all the way here.

BLACK TRIKE: <i>Here we go,</i>

00:19:31.087 --> 00:19:32.588
We'll destroy Lunatic Core Artemis

00:19:32.672 --> 00:19:36.967
and wipe out those
scrap iron machines on the moon.

00:19:37.051 --> 00:19:39.679

00:19:56.195 --> 00:19:57.196
Uh...

So pretty.

Us, too!

00:20:31.564 --> 00:20:33.983
