WEBVTT

00:00:01.335 --> 00:00:03.337
(ominous music)

00:00:18.936 --> 00:00:21.146
Why don't you give up already?

00:00:28.403 --> 00:00:30.864
Everything was in vain.

00:00:30.948 --> 00:00:31.990
Everything.

00:00:32.491 --> 00:00:35.786
LUNATIC: Trying to live,
all the fighting...

00:00:36.495 --> 00:00:39.039
<i>it's all just worthless.</i>

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:42.501
<i>We promised to protect the human race.</i>

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.587
<i>This is what happened as a result.</i>

00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:54.763
(tense music)

00:01:00.227 --> 00:01:03.563
SMILEY: <i>This is Schoolmaster Smiley.</i>

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:05.899
<i>Attention leaders of all departments.</i>

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:09.903
During transport,
we lost the girls necessary

00:01:09.987 --> 00:01:12.281
for the rituals.

00:01:12.364 --> 00:01:15.951
As it turned out,
they were killed by a bomb

00:01:16.034 --> 00:01:18.912
we set up as a fail-safe device.

00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:24.126
<i>We did not want to kill them.</i>

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:28.213
<i>But they are better off being dead</i>
<i>than being returned</i>

00:01:28.297 --> 00:01:30.549
<i>to the ignorant humans.</i>

00:01:30.632 --> 00:01:33.302
Empress is the target of Artemis,

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.138
but that's not all.

00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:39.391
Black Rock Shooter
is the most evil existence in the world.

00:01:40.892 --> 00:01:43.145
<i>We are deploying Charlotte.</i>

00:01:44.313 --> 00:01:46.690
<i>It may feel a little premature,</i>

00:01:47.274 --> 00:01:49.818
<i>but this should resolve the situation.</i>

00:01:50.527 --> 00:01:54.197
<i>All crews are expected</i>
<i>to highly motivate themselves.</i>

00:01:54.281 --> 00:01:55.657
<i>That is all.</i>

00:01:58.035 --> 00:02:00.037
("ASEED" by ZAQ playing)

00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:30.627
(thrilling music)

00:03:34.548 --> 00:03:38.385
(engine revving)

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:03.201
Oh, wow!

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.919
I've been waiting, Colonel.

00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:14.421
Volt.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.215
I'm the leader of the reinforcement unit.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:21.678
She must be

00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:23.889
the human race's secret weapon.

00:04:24.765 --> 00:04:26.933
So it seems.

00:04:27.017 --> 00:04:32.481
Hemiteos Unit, mission code name Empress.

00:04:32.564 --> 00:04:36.234
Also known as Black Rock Shooter.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.072
(men shouting)

00:04:41.156 --> 00:04:42.991
(man whooping)

00:04:43.074 --> 00:04:47.245
What? What's that? I'm a little scared!

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:55.003
VOLT: No battlefronts
against Artemis are improving.

00:04:55.587 --> 00:04:58.924
At least during these few weeks,

00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:01.384
none of our forts or territories
have been seized.

00:05:01.468 --> 00:05:03.220
COLONEL: And the Orbital Elevator?

00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:06.139
Orbital Elevator? What's that?

00:05:06.223 --> 00:05:07.849
Just listen quietly.

00:05:08.517 --> 00:05:10.936
It's steadily nearing completion.

00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:13.980
VOLT: The time limit is one month.

00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:19.903
We must somehow bring Empress
to the Orbital Elevator by then.

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:25.659
I must destroy the Elevator.

00:05:25.742 --> 00:05:26.910
Yes.

00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:32.541
And after that,
I must go to Light House Number Eight.

00:05:33.124 --> 00:05:35.001
You have a lot of musts.

00:05:35.794 --> 00:05:39.464
I must protect everyone.

00:05:42.968 --> 00:05:44.386
Mm.

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:46.096
I must...

00:05:46.596 --> 00:05:48.014
Hm...

00:05:48.098 --> 00:05:49.474
(grunts)

00:05:49.558 --> 00:05:51.518
There are some problems we're facing.

00:05:52.269 --> 00:05:55.313
First, Empress has memory loss.

00:05:55.772 --> 00:06:00.527
There must have been a malfunction
when she rebooted from her long sleep.

00:06:01.278 --> 00:06:06.157
Also, other Hemiteos Units
have similar memory problems.

00:06:06.867 --> 00:06:09.119
We've been attacked
by her former friends twice

00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:10.579
while on the way here.

00:06:10.662 --> 00:06:11.705
What?

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.918
COLONEL: The other day, with Empress,
we fought the Educational Institution,

00:06:17.043 --> 00:06:19.754
and tried to rescue girls
who were going to be sacrificed

00:06:19.838 --> 00:06:21.464
in their rituals.

00:06:21.548 --> 00:06:24.926
Wasn't that unrelated to our mission?

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.095
COLONEL: We needed to do it.

00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:29.806
We wanted parts to repair Empress.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:33.268
But in the end, the rescue failed.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.313
The girls were blown up in front of us.

00:06:37.105 --> 00:06:41.610
They'd rather kill them than lose them.
Very typical of the Institution.

00:06:41.693 --> 00:06:42.694
(gasps)

00:06:43.945 --> 00:06:47.449
Anyway, Empress is mentally unstable
at the moment.

00:06:47.908 --> 00:06:50.535
We are wondering what she needs.

00:06:50.952 --> 00:06:53.830
Does she need time to rest,
or anti-anxiety drugs?

00:06:53.913 --> 00:06:57.792
Or some device
especially for Hemiteos Units?

00:06:58.251 --> 00:07:01.713
Once we figure that out,
we'll head towards the Orbital Elevator.

00:07:02.714 --> 00:07:06.676
I guess that bastard Smiley
is up to no good as usual.

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:08.345
Smiley?

00:07:08.553 --> 00:07:10.597
The boss of the Educational Institution.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.099
I didn't explain it to you yet, did I?

00:07:14.476 --> 00:07:17.187
He's the one who set off the bomb?

00:07:26.237 --> 00:07:27.155
VOLT: Can I come in?

00:07:27.238 --> 00:07:30.408
Oh, Major Volt? Of course, come in.

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:33.787
Sorry to bother you, ladies.

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.914
It's about the Colonel.

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:36.998
Yes?

00:07:37.332 --> 00:07:40.835
I wanted to tell you both something
about him, especially Empress.

00:07:41.336 --> 00:07:44.005
The Colonel's wife and daughter

00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:46.132
were killed
by the Educational Institution.

00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:47.175
What?

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:53.431
So when the sacrificial girls
were blown up by the Institution,

00:07:53.515 --> 00:07:55.642
the Colonel must have been shocked, too.

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:59.062
Why are you telling us this?

00:07:59.688 --> 00:08:01.773
I wouldn't usually disclose such things.

00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:07.237
But I decided to, because I heard Empress
has been shaken since the incident.

00:08:09.572 --> 00:08:14.077
If we stop now, multitudes of people
will die because of us.

00:08:14.577 --> 00:08:17.330
That's why he's suppressing
his personal feelings.

00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:23.420
He'd probably rather fight the Institution
than go destroy the Orbital Elevator.

00:08:25.004 --> 00:08:28.425
Have you known the Colonel
for a long time, Major Volt?

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:30.385
I've known him for about ten years.

00:08:30.969 --> 00:08:33.263
I respect him like a father.

00:08:35.473 --> 00:08:36.933
I don't have any family,

00:08:37.434 --> 00:08:41.521
so this Peacebuilding Force
is everything to me.

00:08:43.732 --> 00:08:45.692
Enough about me. Sorry to bore you.

00:08:46.276 --> 00:08:48.945
We leave tomorrow. Get some sleep now.

00:08:55.744 --> 00:08:56.953
What do you think?

00:08:57.245 --> 00:08:58.163
Think about what?

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.165
Well...

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:01.958
Never mind.

00:09:02.042 --> 00:09:04.627
Would you like to have sex
with me to relax a bit?

00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:06.880
What's sex?

00:09:06.963 --> 00:09:10.008
My goodness!
Do I have to start from there?

00:09:10.091 --> 00:09:11.593
It's the act of love.

00:09:12.052 --> 00:09:13.470
I don't understand.

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:16.890
I'm very tired today.

00:09:16.973 --> 00:09:18.683
I want to sleep.

00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:21.895
Oh, well, it might be too early
for you, anyway.

00:09:27.525 --> 00:09:29.527
(upbeat music)

00:09:35.533 --> 00:09:37.452
COLONEL: Okay. We're departing now.

00:09:37.535 --> 00:09:40.914
Our destination
is Artemis' Orbital Elevator.

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:04.020
(somber music)

00:10:07.982 --> 00:10:09.067
(soft grunt)

00:10:11.152 --> 00:10:12.195
(grunts)

00:10:24.499 --> 00:10:26.459
(ominous music)

00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:36.719
(chuckling)

00:10:41.516 --> 00:10:43.977
(rapid breathing)

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:45.436
(sighs)

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:48.606
I should not be impatient.

00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:53.987
VOLT: <i>A vehicle is rapidly approaching.</i>

00:10:54.571 --> 00:10:55.488
Unmanned Forces?

00:10:55.572 --> 00:10:58.575
No. It's an armed
two-wheel vehicle with a rider.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.827
VOLT: Its speed is staggering.

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:02.120
(zooming)

00:11:02.704 --> 00:11:03.872
BLACK TRIKE: <i>Vehicle verified.</i>

00:11:07.959 --> 00:11:09.169
<i>It's Dead Master.</i>

00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:11.045
Damn it.

00:11:15.425 --> 00:11:16.342
(scoffs)

00:11:16.426 --> 00:11:17.343
Colonel.

00:11:17.427 --> 00:11:20.346
Hold it. Empress is too close.

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:21.347
Darn it.

00:11:21.931 --> 00:11:22.849
VOLT: <i>Roger.</i>

00:11:22.932 --> 00:11:26.603
<i>Stand by! Hold your speed and distance.</i>

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:28.813
Empress!

00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:32.400
You are... Dead Master.

00:11:32.984 --> 00:11:36.529
Forgive me for suddenly
attacking you the other day.

00:11:36.696 --> 00:11:38.281
I apologize.

00:11:40.116 --> 00:11:42.243
I meant no offense,

00:11:42.327 --> 00:11:45.038
because I love you.

00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:48.541
Love? Do you mean sex?

00:11:50.376 --> 00:11:51.252
What?

00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:55.256
I just learned about it last night.
She taught me.

00:11:57.091 --> 00:11:59.260
That witch!

00:11:59.344 --> 00:12:03.264
What? Is she glaring at me? Why?

00:12:03.348 --> 00:12:04.807
(sighs)

00:12:04.891 --> 00:12:06.893
We'll talk about that later.

00:12:07.393 --> 00:12:09.187
Anyway, Empress,

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:14.108
you and I both lost parts of our memory
and are confused, isn't that right?

00:12:14.192 --> 00:12:15.068
Yes.

00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:18.029
But we do remember some things.

00:12:18.238 --> 00:12:22.075
All through our battles with Artemis,
you were in pain.

00:12:23.034 --> 00:12:25.578
I was in pain?

00:12:29.332 --> 00:12:33.294
Was I feeling this way the whole time?

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.298
DEAD MASTER: <i>This world has gone insane.</i>

00:12:39.884 --> 00:12:44.305
Artemis has exposed the insanity
of human beings.

00:12:47.684 --> 00:12:50.937
This world isn't worth saving anymore.

00:12:51.938 --> 00:12:52.897
Huh?

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:59.904
Even if the Unmanned Forces didn't exist,
humans would probably kill each other.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.033
-(grunts)
-Mm!

00:13:04.117 --> 00:13:05.034
(gasps)

00:13:06.869 --> 00:13:09.289
So...
(sobs)

00:13:10.581 --> 00:13:13.501
I'm going to kill you. Don't worry.

00:13:14.002 --> 00:13:15.753
I'll die, too, right after.

00:13:16.045 --> 00:13:20.258
Although before I die,
I'll pleasure myself with your corpse.

00:13:23.594 --> 00:13:25.972
Hey! She's not normal!

00:13:26.764 --> 00:13:31.019
You're saying you'll destroy me
to end my suffering?

00:13:31.102 --> 00:13:32.145
Yes, I am.

00:13:32.854 --> 00:13:35.273
Did you come all this way to tell me that?

00:13:35.356 --> 00:13:37.817
I was in too much
of a hurry the last time.

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:40.820
I ambushed you, so you ran away.

00:13:40.903 --> 00:13:45.825
Now that you know my intentions,
you'll offer your body to me, right?

00:13:48.077 --> 00:13:49.579
I don't feel like dying.

00:13:49.662 --> 00:13:53.332
So, you won't let me kill you?
After all my begging?

00:13:53.916 --> 00:13:56.294
It's not that I don't ever want to die.

00:13:56.377 --> 00:14:01.549
I just want to decide
when I will die for myself.

00:14:03.342 --> 00:14:05.553
(breathes heavily)

00:14:06.637 --> 00:14:11.059
DEAD MASTER: Negotiation has failed.
It's time to use force.

00:14:11.142 --> 00:14:13.561
EMPRESS: Hey, wait. I...

00:14:13.644 --> 00:14:15.188
(tires screeching)

00:14:18.066 --> 00:14:18.983
No!

00:14:19.067 --> 00:14:21.402
The armed vehicle is breaking away.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.237
This is bad.

00:14:23.321 --> 00:14:26.324
She's more dangerous from a distance.

00:14:26.574 --> 00:14:27.408
What?

00:14:27.492 --> 00:14:30.745
Is there anywhere to hide?

00:14:30.828 --> 00:14:32.246
Darn it.

00:14:33.331 --> 00:14:38.211
It ended up this same way again.
Why doesn't she understand me?

00:14:45.843 --> 00:14:47.053
(sharp exhale)

00:14:49.055 --> 00:14:50.223
(gasps)

00:14:50.306 --> 00:14:51.599
(tense music builds)

00:14:58.106 --> 00:14:59.482
(grunts)

00:14:59.774 --> 00:15:00.858
(explosion)

00:15:02.151 --> 00:15:04.654
VOLT: Jet-type fighter drone confirmed.

00:15:05.613 --> 00:15:07.865
It's attacking the two-wheel vehicle.

00:15:08.449 --> 00:15:11.119
Intercept! Anti-aircraft fire!

00:15:15.456 --> 00:15:16.749
(gasps)

00:15:17.708 --> 00:15:18.584
(gasps)

00:15:18.668 --> 00:15:20.002
(explosion)

00:15:21.587 --> 00:15:23.047
(weapons firing)

00:15:24.966 --> 00:15:27.093
(whooshing)

00:15:28.719 --> 00:15:31.097
-(blasts)
-Darn.

00:15:44.819 --> 00:15:47.071
(blasting)

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.659
What the hell is that?

00:15:53.911 --> 00:15:54.912
Mm.

00:15:57.081 --> 00:15:57.915
(groans)

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.127
-(gasps)
-(grunting)

00:16:07.216 --> 00:16:09.260
(groaning)

00:16:16.142 --> 00:16:17.894
Darn it.

00:16:32.283 --> 00:16:34.327
COLONEL: Charlotte?

00:16:34.911 --> 00:16:38.331
What's happening? Why?

00:16:40.583 --> 00:16:42.793
Nice to meet you.

00:16:44.086 --> 00:16:46.505
Is this over already?

00:16:47.798 --> 00:16:49.008
That was too easy.

00:16:49.842 --> 00:16:54.555
Schoolmaster Smiley wants you so badly.
And yet you're so weak.

00:16:55.056 --> 00:16:58.559
It's strange. I envy you.

00:16:58.643 --> 00:17:01.687
Empress is mine!

00:17:01.771 --> 00:17:03.814
Get your filthy foot off of her.

00:17:05.149 --> 00:17:08.069
(weapon firing)

00:17:14.492 --> 00:17:16.827
You are, well...

00:17:16.911 --> 00:17:19.622
CHARLOTTE: Dead Master, aren't you?

00:17:19.705 --> 00:17:23.751
You're supposed to be a good sniper,
but you came so close by.

00:17:24.377 --> 00:17:25.753
How pathetic.

00:17:26.629 --> 00:17:29.799
(groaning)

00:17:32.885 --> 00:17:35.805
-(Charlotte grunting)
-(Dead Master groaning)

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.937
LUNATIC: <i>Why don't you give up already?</i>

00:17:43.854 --> 00:17:46.274
Everything was in vain.

00:17:46.357 --> 00:17:47.608
Everything.

00:17:48.276 --> 00:17:51.153
Trying to live, all the fighting...

00:17:53.197 --> 00:17:55.741
it's all just worthless.

00:17:56.701 --> 00:17:59.620
We promised to protect the human race.

00:18:00.204 --> 00:18:02.623
This is what happened as a result.

00:18:04.208 --> 00:18:06.419
Do you have anything to say to them?

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:09.839
No, nothing.

00:18:11.048 --> 00:18:13.342
I'm going to kill you.

00:18:13.426 --> 00:18:14.594
(laughs)

00:18:15.511 --> 00:18:19.724
I'm not giving up.

00:18:20.433 --> 00:18:22.435
(intense music)

00:18:28.858 --> 00:18:29.734
Huh.

00:18:30.943 --> 00:18:34.196
(electricity crackling)

00:18:35.781 --> 00:18:37.158
Stop!

00:18:38.826 --> 00:18:40.119
Charlotte!

00:18:47.668 --> 00:18:50.087
(whimpers)

00:18:50.171 --> 00:18:51.505
Wait.

00:18:56.594 --> 00:18:58.596
(soft music)

00:19:13.611 --> 00:19:14.654
Empress.

00:19:15.321 --> 00:19:17.657
I'm not going to die yet.

00:19:19.241 --> 00:19:22.912
So I don't want you to die yet either.

00:19:22.995 --> 00:19:26.916
(sobbing)

00:19:32.963 --> 00:19:34.882
Charlotte.

00:19:38.719 --> 00:19:40.930
(panting)

00:19:45.601 --> 00:19:46.894
(shrieking)

00:19:46.977 --> 00:19:49.939
I'm done! Oops.

00:19:50.022 --> 00:19:52.024
(calm music)

00:19:57.238 --> 00:20:00.658
Repair complete. This is a sturdy car.

00:20:01.534 --> 00:20:05.871
Six men left in the reinforcement unit.

00:20:09.333 --> 00:20:11.502
Why didn't you shoot her?

00:20:13.129 --> 00:20:14.714
That's because...

00:20:15.589 --> 00:20:18.008
she's my daughter.

00:20:18.092 --> 00:20:19.176
(gasps)

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:20.678
Oh, my.

00:20:21.262 --> 00:20:23.931
She was kidnapped
by the Educational Institution.

00:20:24.515 --> 00:20:26.142
I thought she was dead.

00:20:26.392 --> 00:20:29.603
I don't know why she...

00:20:31.313 --> 00:20:36.402
I don't get it. I really don't get it.

00:20:38.904 --> 00:20:40.406
I messed up.

00:20:41.574 --> 00:20:44.535
I've lost so many of my men again.

00:20:49.081 --> 00:20:50.750
Black Trike can track her.

00:20:50.833 --> 00:20:53.753
EMPRESS: We can still pursue Charlotte.

00:20:53.836 --> 00:20:54.712
What?

00:20:54.795 --> 00:20:56.464
BLACK TRIKE: <i>Of course, we can.</i>

00:20:56.547 --> 00:20:58.966
You must, if she's so dear to you.

00:20:59.049 --> 00:21:02.636
It's too late for regrets after death.

00:21:03.095 --> 00:21:07.683
But our mission is to destroy
the Orbital Elevator.

00:21:08.017 --> 00:21:11.437
Maybe we don't have to pursue her.

00:21:12.813 --> 00:21:16.108
She'll be back, that jet-drone girl.

00:21:16.358 --> 00:21:17.610
I'm sure of it,

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:20.029
because her target is Empress.

00:21:20.654 --> 00:21:25.659
If we keep moving towards the Elevator,
she'll try to get Empress again somewhere.

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.244
Uh...

00:21:28.037 --> 00:21:29.371
And when that happens...

00:21:29.914 --> 00:21:30.956
EMPRESS: Just talk to her.

00:21:32.374 --> 00:21:35.085
Dead Master understood how I felt.

00:21:35.586 --> 00:21:37.254
First, have a talk.

00:21:37.338 --> 00:21:39.381
Ask her what happened.

00:21:40.174 --> 00:21:42.259
What if communication fails?

00:21:42.927 --> 00:21:46.514
I'll be sure to capture her
without killing her.

00:21:47.848 --> 00:21:49.517
Empress.

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:53.020
I'm not going to give up.

00:21:53.103 --> 00:21:55.564
BLACK TRIKE:
<i>Charge finalized 12 minutes ago.</i>

00:21:55.648 --> 00:21:57.775
<i>We can go any time, Empress.</i>

00:21:57.858 --> 00:21:58.818
Okay.

00:22:13.999 --> 00:22:15.960
