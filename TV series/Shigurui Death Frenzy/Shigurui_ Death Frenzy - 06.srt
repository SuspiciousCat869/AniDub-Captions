1
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:55,583
I applied an ointment that
works well on spear wounds.

2
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:59,416
Your fever should
break soon as well.

3
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:03,791
I took the liberty
of saving this for you.

4
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:15,958
Heartbreaking...
Truly and utterly.

5
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,500
I will see him
punished severely...

6
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:51,875
I will see personally to the
punishment of Seigen Irako...

7
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:56,000
The man who drove
my lady into this mess.

8
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:22,250
Seigen Irako...
At your disposal.

9
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:28,166
Seigen Irako.

10
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:34,250
Today, at this sacred
place, I will instruct

11
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:38,166
you on the Kogan
Style's secret technique.

12
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,208
This is it...
Nagareboshi...

13
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:43,666
Not only is he giving
me his daughter,

14
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,041
but he is finally giving me

15
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:48,250
the Kogan Style's
secret technique!

16
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:51,541
I am most obliged, Sensei!

17
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,083
Very good...

18
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,583
But first...

19
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:57,333
To demonstrate
your skills to Sensei...

20
00:03:57,416 --> 00:04:01,041
I will now spar with you myself.

21
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:03,250
I understand.

22
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,958
Watch carefully and know...

23
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:21,000
That the successor
to the Kogan Style...

24
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:24,666
...can be no man
but Seigen Irako!

25
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:46,166
Game over.

26
00:04:55,583 --> 00:05:00,125
Ushimata-dono, I clearly
scored the first blow...!

27
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:02,125
It is customary in
a sparring match

28
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:05,166
amongst ourselves
to halt one's strike!

29
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,791
Seigen-dono...

30
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,791
I...
I am all right...

31
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,000
Irako...

32
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:29,833
Sensei did not say
the match was over.

33
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:33,750
Wha--...?

34
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:57,833
What is going on...?!
This--this isn't right!

35
00:05:57,916 --> 00:06:01,000
Next... Fujiki.

36
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:18,500
Fujiki...
is smiling...?

37
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:24,208
Is--is he out of his mind?

38
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:27,208
I cannot fight with this injury!

39
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:32,583
No...
Don't come near me!

40
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,958
Stay away!

41
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:38,416
Do you wish to give up?

42
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:46,208
Do you wish to give up...
the secret technique, Seigen?

43
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:57,000
It was due to my
own inexperience that I

44
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,750
halted my bokken
and sustained injury...!

45
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:03,708
When I saw you wearing armor,
I should have paid it heed...

46
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,958
I should have understood...

47
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,791
...and fought as though
this were a battlefield.

48
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:11,958
So then you wish to give up.

49
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,166
No, Sensei...!

50
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:18,625
I have devoted my entire
existence to train for this day!

51
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:24,416
Being given the Kogan Style...
is a necessity...

52
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,416
...in order for me to rise up!

53
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,833
Being given Mie and the house...

54
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:34,708
...becoming a
retainer to the lord...

55
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:38,041
I will bleed the
Kogan Style dry!

56
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:41,416
And in so using it
as my stepping stone...

57
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:47,250
I, Seigen Irako...
will become renowned!

58
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,250
Hello, Fujiki.

59
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,583
It's been too long.

60
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,291
I wonder, when was it...?

61
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,041
...that people
stopped whispering

62
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:47,500
you were successor
to the Kogan Style...

63
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:59,291
An even match...

64
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:02,166
No...

65
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,958
How pitiful...

66
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:11,875
If not for me, you could at
least have gotten Mie...

67
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:47,333
Yes, Fujiki...
crawl on your hands and knees...

68
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:51,458
I however...
choose to soar!

69
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,125
Fujiki...

70
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:36,958
Young Master...

71
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:50,000
Oh, Seigen-sama...

72
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,916
I have prayed this
day would come...

73
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,958
...from the very first
time I came to meet you.

74
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,875
Conceive...

75
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:04,166
Conceive...!
Con-ceeeive!

76
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:13,500
My son...

77
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,375
Mother...!

78
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,250
It is not over yet...

79
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:26,208
Tonight is only
a stepping-stone...

80
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:29,000
I will continue
to rise higher...

81
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,541
...higher...

82
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,166
...ever higher...!

83
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:57,041
That will be enough.

84
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,583
Please, do not worry...

85
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:18,791
What we are giving
him now will help...

86
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:22,500
It is a sure remedy made
from the seeds of poppies.

87
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:25,083
Its effect will melt
Seigen's pain away,

88
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:28,833
much like the morning
sun on a light snow.

89
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,541
And now it comes to this...

90
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:36,833
In order to resolve the matter,
my lady must burn the

91
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:40,625
very cause of that which
drove her into this mess.

92
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:46,416
This is a direct order given
to you by Kogan-sensei.

93
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,500
If you will not mete out
Sensei's punishment...

94
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:54,125
Irako Seigen's life...
will be forfeit.

95
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,291
His life...

96
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,833
Seigen-sama...!
Run!

97
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,791
Please, you must run...!

98
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:32,166
K-Kogan...!

99
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,958
Seigen-dono...

100
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,083
A sword...?

101
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:44,208
Yes...
I remember now...

102
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:52,125
I am to be given Nagareboshi...

103
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:08,500
♪ Red moon rising...
Void of sanity, ♪

104
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:13,541
♪ filled with blood,

105
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:31,625
How dare you deceive me...?

106
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:35,041
Munenori...

107
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:40,041
It was your advice that
I conceal my extra finger...

108
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,041
How dare you deceive me...?

109
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:48,541
How dare you deceive
me, Munenori?!

110
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,000
Irako-sama!

111
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:59,083
Fight him, please!

112
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:02,791
Kill him...
Kill that monster!

113
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,583
Mie-sama...

114
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:11,083
This weather is
not good for you...

115
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:14,208
Would you not
prefer to wait inside?

116
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:20,875
I am not cold.

117
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,416
Akiba Mountain...

118
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:25,916
Where Father has gone...

119
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
...to teach the Kogan Style's
secret technique...

120
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:34,958
And the man he teaches...
will become his successor.

121
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:39,958
Mie-sama is smiling again...!

122
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:42,333
After all of her hardships...

123
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:46,625
After everything I long thought
had made her forget how!

124
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:21,750
Idiot...

125
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:55,416
She is like a heavenly maiden...

126
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,500
It is as if the snow melts...

127
00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:00,958
...with the warmth
of Mie-sama's smile.

128
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:05,458
He is not like
those other puppets...

129
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,750
That day...

130
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:11,958
He did everything in his
power to protect my pride.

131
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:15,166
Yes...
He is a gentleman.

132
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,666
A true and caring gentleman.

133
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:31,708
Wh...
What is going on?!

134
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,333
No...

135
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:39,208
I am not to learn
the secret technique!

136
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:42,666
This is...!

137
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:18,666
♪ When the ladies' man with
the hair as black as night ♪

138
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:23,125
♪ Soaked with Lady Iku

139
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:31,333
♪ A blindfold of crimson
bloomed that day ♪

140
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:28,541
The never ending
wailing serves not

141
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:32,083
only as the death rattle
of a genius swordsman...

142
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,500
No...

143
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:39,041
This also, is the first cry...
of a newly born monster.

144
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:40,333
Fujiki...

145
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:44,458
You are now the successor
to the Kogan Style.

146
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:53,916
Those eyes...!

147
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:08,791
It is said that on that day,
two monsters were born...

148
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,291
They were wrong.
