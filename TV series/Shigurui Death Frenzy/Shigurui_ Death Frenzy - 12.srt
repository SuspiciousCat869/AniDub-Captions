1
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:10,250
Irako...!

2
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:21,333
You will state the
purpose of your visit.

3
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:23,250
Of course.

4
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,583
Kengyou Shizuhata-sama
sent me...

5
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:27,666
I have come to deliver
his appreciation to

6
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,125
Kogan Iwamoto-dono
for his swordplay

7
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:32,333
performance the other day.

8
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:35,416
Is that a biwa lute?

9
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,875
That is very thoughtful of him.

10
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:40,250
Then, please...
do come in.

11
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:57,958
So that is the blind samurai
who desires Sensei's life.

12
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:01,416
It is laughable that he
came here on his own...

13
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,833
He will find that the
three Tengu of Noubi

14
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:06,958
will quickly turn
the tables on him.

15
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,875
I smell urine.

16
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:28,041
He must be in his
state of dementia.

17
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:32,166
He is certainly not
in his right mind.

18
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:37,458
There are two men
in front of me.

19
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,375
And one behind.

20
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:49,791
Iku...

21
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:52,291
Shall we begin?

22
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:29,000
That was splendid.

23
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:32,416
Sensei also seems quite pleased.

24
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,125
Please pass our regards
along to Shizuhata-sama...

25
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,666
We appreciate your performance.

26
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,541
Of course...

27
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:43,541
Next I will show you
a rare piece of art.

28
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,125
Art?

29
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:49,625
It is a refined bit of work...
drawn on the skin of Iku-sama...

30
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:52,125
Kengyou's mistress.

31
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:53,708
Go on...
Take a good look.

32
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,791
You have done well...
Iku.

33
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,541
Seigen-sama...

34
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,000
Finish it...!

35
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:21,000
Finish it,
as your heart desires!

36
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,208
I checked the hardness of the

37
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:26,666
tatami mats when
I was dancing earlier.

38
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:30,916
We successfully
made him draw his sword.

39
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,166
Things are going
just as I intended.

40
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,208
Sensei!

41
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:38,416
We will handle him!

42
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,125
Am I...

43
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,750
Dead...?

44
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:40,041
This place...

45
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,250
This is Hell...

46
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,583
The sounds...

47
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:15,125
The smell of
blood and entrails...

48
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:20,958
...It was not enough
to shut my eyes...

49
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:24,500
Now you wish to shut
my ears and nose as well...

50
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,666
Kogan.

51
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,000
This place...

52
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:57,875
Do not bow your
head before him...

53
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:03,125
Remain steady and look
Sensei directly in the eyes.

54
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:06,833
Do not move even a muscle.

55
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,708
Irako-sama...

56
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:07,666
...please, do as
your heart desires.

57
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:42,916
That is it...

58
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,291
He is doing it...

59
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:47,500
Irako-sama's certain
victory stance.

60
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:12,208
Nagareboshi, the Kogan Style
secret swordplay technique.

61
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:17,541
No man has ever been known to
escape this devilish maneuver.

62
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,708
I have beaten it...

63
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:33,416
I have beaten Nagareboshi.

64
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,916
All that is left is to
hear the sweet sound

65
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,250
of Kogan falling to the ground.

66
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,708
That was not it.

67
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:50,625
That was the sound
of Iku collapsing.

68
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,208
Not that either...
That is the stone lantern.

69
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,833
What is that...?

70
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:21,791
What is happening...?
What the hell is there?

71
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:14,166
Father...

72
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:26,666
Today...
I have found true happiness...

73
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:39,250
Mie, it is you...

74
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:48,583
You have become so beautiful.

75
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:13,416
Gennosuke Fujiki has arrived
at the Iwamoto residence.

76
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,375
Mie-dono!

77
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,416
Sensei!

78
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:45,166
Sensei...!
Sensei!

79
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,541
Oh, Sensei...

80
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:13,166
Fujiki...

81
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:24,666
Welcome home Fujiki...

82
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:47,333
Seven days after
he had left town,

83
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:50,458
Gonzaemon Ushimata returned.

84
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,750
Upon seeing the front gate,

85
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:56,541
he realized what had
happened in his absence.

86
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:16,291
Tell me, are you the blind man

87
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:19,583
who killed the
Tiger in Kakegawa?

88
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:26,250
Go on, Seigen.
Tell him your name.

89
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:29,833
I am a steward for
the Shizuhata Family...

90
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:32,750
My name is Seigen Irako.

91
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:36,666
What style do you use?

92
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,791
Mumyo...
Sakanagare.

93
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:46,833
I wish to see...
Show me your technique.
