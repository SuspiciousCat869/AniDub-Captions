1
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:07,625
Kan 'ei Year 10.
December.

2
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:41,208
Due to conduct unbecoming
the lord of a large domain,

3
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:44,916
Tadanaga Tokugawa was
ordered to commit seppuku

4
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,875
despite his standing as

5
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:50,208
Shogun Iemitsu's
younger brother.

6
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:54,666
Tales of his misconduct
have been passed down

7
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,083
through the generations,

8
00:02:56,166 --> 00:03:00,708
although none have ever
been confirmed as true.

9
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:15,416
Kan 'ei Year 10.
Sunpu Castle.

10
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:20,666
My Lord, there
was something I would

11
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:24,041
like to say to you, if I may.

12
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,125
Something stinks.

13
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:41,458
My request is something I wish
you to accept at any cost.

14
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:46,791
It-- It concerns the
match to be held...

15
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:50,333
September 24th
inside the castle walls.

16
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:55,375
Please do not force the
swordsmen to use real blades.

17
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:58,416
I beg of you to stop.

18
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,333
Their swordsmanship
can be represented

19
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,500
fairly using bokken...

20
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:08,416
To use real katana would be a

21
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,583
waste of these
highly skilled men.

22
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,583
The country is at peace now...

23
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:29,333
Sunpu Castle is bound
to Tosho-Daigongen-sama.

24
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:32,583
To violate the Castle's garden
with blood at a time like this

25
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:36,416
would be seen as defiance
toward the government.

26
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,625
It would bring nothing but

27
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:40,166
despair to his
lordship's family.

28
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,541
Therefore, on behalf
of those swordsmen,

29
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:46,708
I will show you the result
of using real blades.

30
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:03,166
This is what a real sword...
would do to those men...

31
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,583
This is it... my Lord.

32
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:11,416
Suruga is worth
550 thousand koku.

33
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,291
Are you saying, my Lord,
that you would desire

34
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:18,333
this match even if it were
to cost you that domain?

35
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,333
You... fool...

36
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:55,833
September 24th...
The same year.

37
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:18,041
Indeed it is a pointless
thing to lose such

38
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:22,500
skilled samurai in a
match using real swords.

39
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:28,875
However...

40
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:32,708
Who can stop our Lord?

41
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:37,708
Who can stop him when
even Torii-dono sacrificed

42
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:41,625
his life and was still ignored?

43
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:50,541
We all know, quite well, that a
samurai's life is not his own.

44
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:03,583
The highest honor
a samurai can achieve

45
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:07,291
is to die in the
name of his Lord.

46
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:52,000
Mie-dono.
What is the matter?

47
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:55,916
I saw you.

48
00:07:57,291 --> 00:08:00,916
I had a vision of you and you
were winning the match.

49
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,416
Gennosuke Fujiki.

50
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,125
It is time for your match.

51
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:37,791
At the pleasure of our Lord,
the match will now commence.

52
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,291
Yes, sir.

53
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:49,916
On the west, Gennosuke Fujiki!

54
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:59,416
One arm?!

55
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,458
If I remember
correctly this is the

56
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:06,666
man recommended by you, Saegusa.

57
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,041
You are correct.

58
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:09,541
Have you lost your mind?

59
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:13,083
The only thing a one-armed
swordsman can do out there is--

60
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,958
Is win.

61
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,291
But Hyuga-dono...

62
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:23,625
Ah... You use the Kogan style,

63
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:26,583
which is said to be
unrivaled in the Noubi area.

64
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,291
Gennosuke Fujiki.

65
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:31,416
You come recommended by
Chief Retainer Saegusa-sama,

66
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,875
the Lord of Izu, correct?

67
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:36,541
To be safe...

68
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:39,791
I must now give your
body an inspection.

69
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:42,583
Please...
Take your time.

70
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,916
A wound of defeat...

71
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:58,250
Is it acceptable to bring such
a man before our Lord?

72
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:08,875
It was clear to me

73
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,083
that he had been
diligent in developing

74
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,833
the muscles on his back...

75
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:16,583
...to compensate
for his missing arm.

76
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:27,625
On the east...
Seigen Irako!

77
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,833
Iku...

78
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,625
I will be fine.

79
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,708
A cripple?

80
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,416
And that is not all...

81
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,916
He's blind...

82
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,041
Gennosuke Fujiki.

83
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,958
Seigen Irako.

84
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,958
Without hesitation,
please exhibit to the

85
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,750
greatest extent of
your abilities,

86
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:24,666
your sword skills for our Lord.

87
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:55,166
A one-armed man
versus a blind cripple.

88
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,291
To stain the garden
with such a show.

89
00:11:57,375 --> 00:12:00,166
It is unworthy of
being called martial arts.

90
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,250
There is no excuse for it.

91
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,041
Enough.

92
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,875
Look at them, Asakura.

93
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:11,041
To swordsmen of
such indomitable spirit...

94
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,500
...they will take this
cruel fate given them...

95
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:15,916
...and use it to
stir their souls...

96
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,916
...until finally...

97
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:40,000
That stance...
I have not seen it before.

98
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,000
There it is...

99
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:46,375
Irako-sama's certain
victory stance.

100
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,708
Mumyo Sakanagare!

101
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:58,583
Fujiki-sama...
I want you to slay him.

102
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:04,125
Please kill Irako.
I detest him so...

103
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:06,541
...so very much.

104
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,666
You damn monster.

105
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:25,000
I cannot...
read their swordsmanship.

106
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:30,708
Their swordplay is...
abnormal.

107
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:59,166
Gen-na Year 8.
To-otomi Province.

108
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:25,500
Here it is...
Tsuba-zemari.

109
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,208
A tough move...

110
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:30,541
He is not even able
to say, "I give up."

111
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,625
I...

112
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:49,000
That will be enough.

113
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,416
Fujiki...

114
00:15:56,791 --> 00:16:01,208
Could you not have tried and...
How do I put this...?

115
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,250
Gone easier on him?

116
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:04,916
Ushimata-shihan...

117
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,541
They will never
learn unless it hurts.

118
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:12,958
Reporting!

119
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:16,000
A man with another
style is at the entrance.

120
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,625
My name is Seigen Irako...

121
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,875
I am here to
challenge your Master...

122
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:40,166
Iwamoto-sensei.

123
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,125
Father!

124
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:51,000
Father, a man with another
style has come to the dojo!

125
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,791
Master...

126
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,666
No...

127
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,916
I beg you, please...

128
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,833
No...

129
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,041
Oh!
Father!

130
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,416
Challenging our dojo?

131
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:44,666
Very well.
I will let our sensei know.

132
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,791
However, the rules of this dojo
state that you must first

133
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:53,083
face two of our apprentices
before you can challenge sensei.

134
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,500
That will be fine.

135
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:12,916
Matching our apprentices
against swordsmen

136
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,791
of other styles is a
vital part of training.

137
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:19,416
As vital as the rules
governing the match itself.

138
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,750
Yet, regardless of
whom is victorious

139
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,791
at the end of the match...

140
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:28,416
...no grudge of any
kind should ever be borne.

141
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:33,333
Treat with courtesy...

142
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,750
Swordsmen of other styles.

143
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,333
Killing them, of course...

144
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:42,416
Is never allowed.

145
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:45,291
We give them a new look...

146
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,000
And send them back.

147
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:51,916
Make the bodies of those
who challenge us a living

148
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,083
message that shows the
strength of the Kogan style.

149
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:59,291
This will raise the reputation
and fame of the dojo.

150
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,083
Unnecessary.

151
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,666
Unnecessary...!
That bastard's red lips...

152
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:11,958
They are unnecessary
for swordplay!

153
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:18,333
It seems the tip of
Fujiki's sword is fired up.

154
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:25,958
And the young
upstart jumps right in.

155
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,833
Now.
Tsuba-zemari.

156
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:31,666
I will crush him!

157
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,416
He missed his chance.

158
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,625
What is happening?

159
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:50,791
Something is wrong with Fujiki.

160
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:04,125
Interesting...
Yubi Garami.

161
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:12,791
Enough.

162
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:16,875
Assistant Instructor!

163
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:17,625
Shihan-dai!

164
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,250
Fujiki Shihan-dai!

165
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:28,083
It is nothing.
This is not over.

166
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:33,750
This...
This is not over yet...

167
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,833
Do you hear me?

168
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,041
I am certain you think that.

169
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:49,708
I said 'enough'.

170
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:53,916
This is not... over yet...
This is not over yet.

171
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,916
Fujiki...

172
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,666
Do you hear?

173
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:04,791
Yes, Fujiki, I know.

174
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,833
I will be the next
person you face.

175
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,125
So it is to be another
sparring match using bokken?

176
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:11,458
Now, please...
forgive my rudeness.
