1
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:45,250
Throughout history,
every domain in the

2
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:49,458
world has had to
deal with foolish rulers.

3
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,375
There is nothing suspicious.

4
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:47,708
Chosen to serve the
lord in bed on that night

5
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:50,541
was the daughter
of one of his retainers...

6
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:53,291
Her name was Sato.

7
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,208
Tadanaga Tokugawa...

8
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:57,000
New lord of Sunpu Castle...

9
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,708
...son of the previous
Shogun Hidetada...

10
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:03,083
...younger brother of
the current Shogun Iemitsu...

11
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:05,833
To see this spoiled
man face justice

12
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:07,833
for his reign of cruelty,

13
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:10,250
the world would have
to wait until a certain

14
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:14,916
match held before the
lord in Kan'ei Year 6.

15
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:07,583
Kan'ei Year 5, June.

16
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:13,083
Excuse me good sirs...
Could you please wait a moment?

17
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,041
What do you want?

18
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:21,625
Ah, you gentlemen left
but have not yet paid.

19
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,250
Oh, the bill from the inn...

20
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:26,125
Right...
We forgot...

21
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,666
Insolent punk.

22
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,125
He got what he deserved.

23
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:45,000
They say that Suruga
Dainagon-sama is as

24
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:47,333
ferocious a lord as Nobunaga.

25
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,000
And from what I hear...

26
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,041
If we have the skills
he would not have

27
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:54,500
any problem employing
swordsmen like us.

28
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:57,041
Everybody knows that.

29
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:01,041
Look around you...
This town is full of ronin.

30
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:04,208
Even he...
cannot employ us all.

31
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:07,875
Then we will show
him we are the best.

32
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:10,541
Once we prove to him
that our skill level is much

33
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:14,291
greater than these other ronin,
his choice will be clear.

34
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:17,875
Much like Musashi who
defeated Yoshioka in Kyoto.

35
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:21,541
Yes, that would be
a quick and easy way.

36
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:24,583
So who...
will be our prey?

37
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,250
There is a dojo nearby,

38
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:29,291
something called
the Kogan Style.

39
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,458
The Kogan Style...?

40
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:34,166
What kind of backwoods
swordsmanship is that?

41
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:38,875
The story goes that the Sensei,
Kogan Iwamoto, is insane...

42
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,958
...and his daughter is
nearly as mad as he is.

43
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:44,500
People say that of
the two instructors,

44
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:46,000
Ushimata is the idiot,

45
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:49,833
but the other, Fujiki,
cannot even speak.

46
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:54,583
Not so much a "backwoods" dojo
as it is a "brainless" one, huh?

47
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:04,416
Say that again!

48
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,833
Say what again, boy?

49
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,750
You must be one
of Kogan's pupils.

50
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:30,458
Show me...
What you've got.

51
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:50,375
Not just yet.

52
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,000
I am very sorry.

53
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:03,291
Not only did I use the Kogan
Style for my personal strife...

54
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,833
...but I also
promised to fight them.

55
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,750
My opponents are
seven rogue ronin...

56
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,291
They told me to
bring a witness to

57
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:13,375
Jinba Pass this evening at dusk.

58
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,250
Please give me your permission.

59
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,041
I will defeat them
with one sword

60
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:19,708
even if it costs me my life!

61
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,833
Suzu...

62
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:35,625
Well done.

63
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:55,875
It was one year ago in the
spring when the new pupil,

64
00:09:55,958 --> 00:10:00,916
Suzunosuke Kondoh, was
approved for Naka-Mokuroku.

65
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:51,000
We are done.

66
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:59,708
What...?
one more match, please!

67
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:02,666
Just one...
One more!!

68
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:17,041
Nagare is a Kogan Style
secret technique passed on

69
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:20,625
only to those of Naka-Mokuroku
level and above.

70
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:24,208
Have patience,
you cannot master it overnight.

71
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:27,750
Is Fujiki-shihan cold to me...

72
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:28,916
...because I was approved for

73
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,250
Naka-Moku-roku due to
my "connections?"

74
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,875
He is not the kind of man to be
bothered by such a thing.

75
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:45,083
I suppose the fight at Jinba
Pass is in full clash by now.

76
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,416
Yes.

77
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,416
How truly heartbreaking.

78
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,291
According to Mosuke-san...

79
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:19,000
...she still refuses to
eat any of her meals...

80
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,291
...no matter how many
ways they prepare them...

81
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:24,916
At most she eats only rice
broth every couple of days.

82
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,916
Three years after
his banishment...

83
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,375
And she still cannot
get over Irako.

84
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,625
Do not mention that name.

85
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,750
Sensei, too much of
this sun is not good for you.

86
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,666
We should go inside.

87
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:42,833
Sensei?

88
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,375
He...

89
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,166
With bare hands...?

90
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,583
With these stray dogs...
I have no need...

91
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,208
...for a sword.

92
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:43,041
I did not know a dragon
was hiding in Kakegawa.

93
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,416
Shinmusou Hayashizaki Style.

94
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:09,000
Look at him...
He is good.

95
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:32,541
Winter, Kan'ei Year 2.

96
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:36,666
Eleven months after the
punishment of Seigen Irako.

97
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,000
Sensei...

98
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:37,166
This is no ordinary hole.

99
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,750
I believe, Sensei...

100
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:56,000
...that this has something to
do with a secret technique.

101
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:00,208
Too slow!

102
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:13,500
If you want to take something...

103
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:17,500
You should first give it.

104
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:24,166
If you want to
make something weak...

105
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:27,041
...you should first
make it strong.

106
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:31,583
If you want to
shrink something...

107
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:35,458
You should first extend it.

108
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,250
Thus...

109
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,875
If you want to open something...

110
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:58,375
You should first...
cover it.

111
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:30,416
Based on his skills, it was
the following day that

112
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,958
Gennosuke Fujiki
was approved for

113
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:36,625
Dai-Mokuroku in the Kogan Style.

114
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:05,000
Leave one of them alive.

115
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:12,125
We give him a new
look and send him back.

116
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:34,291
Someday...
Someday that will be me.

117
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,791
Suzunosuke...
