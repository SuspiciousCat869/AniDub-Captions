1
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:59,250
Please forgive
my impertinence...

2
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:03,750
If I force myself on her now,

3
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:06,458
Mie-sama will take her own life.

4
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:09,833
If that happens,
your family line ends.

5
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:14,041
For her sake and that
of the Kogan Style,

6
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:18,291
allow us to continue
after the wedding.

7
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:27,541
Irako-sama.

8
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,500
Hello, Mie-dono.

9
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:32,541
Training has ended for the year,
why do you still practice?

10
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:36,291
Because, I still
lack experience.

11
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:44,666
Well, then...

12
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:56,833
Mariko, do you recall where
Irako said he was from?

13
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:59,791
If I remember correctly,
he is from Edo...

14
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:02,916
I heard tale that he is the son
of a rich dye shop owner...

15
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,416
...and that the
man disowned him

16
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,375
because Irako failed to do
anything but practice swordplay.

17
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:09,583
Hmmm...

18
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,291
That makes the
successor of Kogan Style

19
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:15,458
the disowned son of
a dye merchant.

20
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:33,208
I find it peculiar
that no one has seen

21
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:36,041
Gennosuke since
earlier this evening.

22
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:40,000
How far could he have gone
in all of this snow?

23
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:43,375
The incident with
Mie affected him deeply...

24
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:47,125
He seems to have descended
into very low spirits.

25
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:49,208
Now that I reflect back on it,

26
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:52,166
when Sensei chose
Seigen as his successor...

27
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,625
None of us was more
unsettled by it than Fujiki.

28
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:58,625
Certainly you don't think
he would have run away?

29
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:02,666
He is not a man of such
petty characteristics.

30
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:07,125
I believe he has his own
valid reasons for doing this.

31
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:11,750
There is no need to worry...
He will be back in no time.

32
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:22,875
Welcome.

33
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:28,166
Your companion is
waiting for you upstairs.

34
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:31,291
You know what
is required of you?

35
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:34,041
Of course.
I know nothing...

36
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:36,833
You were never here
this night, and certainly

37
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:39,458
neither was anyone
resembling your companion.

38
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:44,333
In fact, this night
is absent of visitors.

39
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,916
Thank you.

40
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,916
I like the snow...

41
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,833
When winter comes...

42
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,333
...the children sing
a different song...

43
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:19,833
instead of
"How Cruel, How Cruel."

44
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:26,416
♪ Du-ring the cold sea-son. ♪

45
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:32,375
♪ Down came a crying
boy from the moun-tain. ♪

46
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:38,000
♪ So many tears;
is there a reason? ♪

47
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:42,833
♪ From the boy came sim-ply:
"Because it is cold. ♪

48
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,583
Apparently...

49
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:48,375
I am to be successor
to the Kogan Style.

50
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:01,583
It is time we stopped
fooling around.

51
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,083
I can't...

52
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:06,083
Even the thought of another
woman tearing you from me...

53
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:09,000
I will not stand for it.

54
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,166
I refuse to face this...

55
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,375
I am not your mother in law...

56
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,958
I am neither Tiger's mistress...

57
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:22,958
...nor am I cursed.

58
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,500
I am a perfectly normal woman...

59
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:29,166
Somebody told me that one time.

60
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,666
Cuh...

61
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:56,208
Con...
Conceive!

62
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,833
Fujiki...

63
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:07,291
A year surely passes quickly.

64
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,041
Irako...

65
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:15,250
The last day of December,
in the first year of Kan'ei.

66
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:15,958
Wanna have a good time?

67
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:29,875
♪ How boring is the world.
Oh, good heavens. ♪

68
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:37,708
♪ From the dreary days of old,
all the way to this very day ♪

69
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:43,291
♪ Nothing is harder
than being in love. ♪

70
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:46,333
♪ "Why," someone asks. ♪

71
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,625
Say...

72
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:53,458
Say mister.
Looking for a good time?

73
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:57,666
You should not sneak
up on people like that.

74
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:03,416
A pregnant whore?!
Hell, no.

75
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,083
What happens if I
go knocking in there,

76
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:08,416
and something knocks back?

77
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,708
Boy, it sure is cold out here.
It's so cold.

78
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,791
Oh, great.
Now I'm sober.

79
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:29,000
To think that her baby
is six months overdue.

80
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:31,833
It sounds creepy,
but I would think the child

81
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:34,208
has already died
inside her belly.

82
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:38,666
Then it must...
It must be a demon child.

83
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:51,125
Looking for a good time?

84
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,458
Gintsuba from Mochiya.

85
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,166
The rice cakes you
said you wanted

86
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,833
to stuff your face with one day.

87
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:50,166
Those detestable fingers...

88
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:54,333
They have taken from
me two former lovers...

89
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:55,750
No...

90
00:15:57,625 --> 00:16:02,666
Not any more...
Irako-sama makes three!

91
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:08,291
Soon that 300 koku will be mine.

92
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,291
I will not allow it.

93
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:14,750
This is the last time I come
to this muddy row house.

94
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:16,750
They will not take him away.

95
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:20,750
From this moment
forth, my status is...

96
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:22,958
No one will take Irako-sama.

97
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:24,583
...samurai!

98
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:43,166
I dreamt last night...
That I was bitten by a mosquito.

99
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:48,958
Let me help you change.
You must be cold.

100
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,541
I am not.

101
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:56,333
Iku?

102
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:57,750
Yes?

103
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:06,583
By observing the
patterns on a blade

104
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:10,625
a swordsman can guess how
many his tool has killed...

105
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:13,250
...and in what manner.

106
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:17,583
It is even more apparent
with one's own sword...

107
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:21,541
I can see clearly who cares
for it while I am asleep...

108
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:24,250
...and how well he does.

109
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:31,583
Exceptional work, Fujiki.

110
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:37,125
Iku, come here.

111
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,458
You, also, are my tool...

112
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:58,583
And I can see
you clearly as well.

113
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:27,000
How dare you deceive me...
Irako!

114
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:03,791
Those are all of
Sensei's instructions.

115
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:08,750
Each of you, please
take action, immediately.

116
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,916
Ushimata-sama...

117
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Mie-dono, good morning.

118
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:39,125
If you need something,
please tell us servants.

119
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,666
We are obliged to assist you.

120
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:45,875
Dried chestnuts, sea tangle,
dried abalone...

121
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:48,875
Those are for Shihou-Zen--the
warlords meal.

122
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:51,583
Are you headed
into battle or something?

123
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:55,000
Ushimata, answer me.

124
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,791
Irako.

125
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:22,541
Kogan-sensei wishes to see you.

126
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:23,916
Sensei?

127
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,625
He said it is an urgent matter.

128
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:36,750
Fujiki...

129
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:44,125
From now on...
Call me Young Master.

130
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:58,250
Halfway up Akiba Mountain...

131
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:01,208
Kontake Shrine...

132
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,916
A hallowed place
to the Kogan Style.

133
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,833
It is where swordsman
Kogan Iwamoto awoke

134
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:10,708
to the secret swordplay
technique, Nagareboshi.

135
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:43,041
Seigen Irako...
at your disposal.

136
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:48,500
Seigen Irako.

137
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:55,000
Today, at this sacred
place, I will instruct you

138
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:58,750
on the Kogan Style's
secret technique.

139
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:01,791
This is it...
Nagareboshi...

140
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:04,291
Not only is he giving
me his daughter,

141
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:08,791
but he is finally giving me the
Kogan Style's secret technique!
