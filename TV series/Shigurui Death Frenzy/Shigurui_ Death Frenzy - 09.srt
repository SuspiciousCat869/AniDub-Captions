1
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,500
Mie-sama...

2
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:44,166
Fujiki...
You are not eating...?

3
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:50,000
Is something wrong?

4
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:01,625
Um...

5
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:06,833
What does it feel like...
when you cut through a person?

6
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:08,333
Hmm...

7
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:11,916
...the sound is not unlike that
of beating on a wet towel.

8
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,416
If you cut well, however,
you do not feel a thing.

9
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:24,000
Dinner is good tonight.

10
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:48,833
It was Mie.

11
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:53,708
Slay her.

12
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:04,000
Slay her, and bring it back.

13
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,916
It is uncanny.

14
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,666
Mie-sama...

15
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,166
I have no choice.

16
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,708
For the Kogan Family.

17
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,208
Mie-sama.

18
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,875
Mie-sama...

19
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:31,208
With a sword
over her shoulder...

20
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,041
Hold these for me.

21
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:06,250
This is dangerous...
Mie-sama's Nagare must be--

22
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:16,166
It is imperfect...
And that imperfection...

23
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:19,416
...is precisely what
makes her such a threat.

24
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,916
Fujiki...

25
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:17,375
Why would Mie-sama
take a cursed sword?

26
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,791
She is only a woman.

27
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,125
Soon...

28
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:50,208
Soon, he will come for me...

29
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:07,333
You will have to say that again.

30
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:13,875
It is my belief that...
the killer is Seigen Irako.

31
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:25,791
Seigen Irako
committed the murders...?

32
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:29,583
Why do you say that?

33
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:32,666
When we punished
him three years ago...

34
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:37,041
it was Shinpachiro Munakata
who gave him an imitation sword.

35
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:40,750
And Munakata's body was found
with such a sword in his mouth.

36
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:45,125
By the same token,
Kurouemon Yamazaki branded

37
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:47,250
Seigen with a hot iron...

38
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:50,708
And his body was found
with a burned cheek.

39
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:54,083
Furthermore, the place
where Suzunosuke's

40
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,250
head was left on display...

41
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,500
...was where we all
cornered Seigen when he

42
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:01,750
first came knocking
on our dojo's door.

43
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:05,708
Irako is a blind man.

44
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,375
Another blind swordsman,
named Seigen Toda,

45
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:14,250
famous during the
Period of Warring States,

46
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:18,041
once found himself ordered
to a match by his lord.

47
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:19,750
Once he neared his opponent,

48
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:22,458
he pummeled the
man with a wooden stick.

49
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:28,083
Because he could not see, it
was the only way he could fight.

50
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:32,291
That is what the swordplay
of a blind man is like.

51
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:43,333
Irako is hiding.

52
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,250
Somewhere here in Kakegawa.

53
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,208
Ah, gentlemen...

54
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:04,375
Does Iwamoto-sama
require my services?

55
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,916
No massage today.

56
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,291
So, what does bring
you gentlemen here?

57
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:22,500
Have you heard anything about
a new face among the Zatou?

58
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:26,416
New face...?
Well, as you can see...

59
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,000
...uh...

60
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,500
...and as you know,
we Zato are blind.

61
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,666
We never see a new face.

62
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:36,291
There is one in
particular whom we seek.

63
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:40,166
And we know how tightly
knit your blind guild is.

64
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:44,125
You are speaking about
Toudouza, are you not?

65
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:47,541
If you are looking for
a Toudouza member...

66
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:50,333
...why do you not
ask Kengyou-sama?

67
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:52,416
Ken--...?

68
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,125
Kengyou, you say...

69
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:30,875
We cannot receive an audience
with Kengyou due to our class.

70
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:34,916
You know this, and yet you still
suggest we meet with him.

71
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:40,041
Toudouza is an
autonomous organization.

72
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:44,166
Kengyou Shizuhata is the
highest ranked man in it.

73
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,166
He once played a biwa
lute before Lord Ieyasu,

74
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:51,791
the Tosho-Gongen, and was given
excessive distinction for this.

75
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:54,916
With his acupuncture skills,

76
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,333
he is currently the
personal physician of

77
00:14:57,416 --> 00:15:02,625
Tadanaga Tokugawa, the Suruga
Dainagon and the Lord of Sunpu.

78
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,416
How touching it sounds...

79
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:27,166
For music played
by a person of sight.

80
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:34,416
Preparations for your audience
at the castle are complete.

81
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,625
Watch your back.

82
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:03,250
Same to you.

83
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:09,750
Hikobee Mariko...

84
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:12,083
He possesses
Herculean strength,

85
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:15,208
second only to
Gonzaemon Ushimata.

86
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:18,041
Each part of his body,
without exception,

87
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:21,833
is a complete weapon
in and of itself.

88
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:36,916
This room seems much larger now.

89
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:16,041
His dominant hand...
it must have festered.

90
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:25,416
Here is your payment
for the three tigers.

91
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:38,291
Thank you very much.

92
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,541
But tell us, Okitsu-dono...

93
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:45,250
What about the
three who still remain?

94
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,958
With those three?

95
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:51,833
It may take longer to
find the right opportunity...

96
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:55,208
It is rare they
drop their guard.

97
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,958
So, they are the true tigers.

98
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:00,625
Exactly.

99
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,125
I will take my leave now.

100
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,375
Okitsu...

101
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:46,041
Was Irako in the house
you just came from?

102
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:48,916
Fujiki...

103
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,208
...are you going
to spend the rest of

104
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:53,291
your life in that room
for the Tiger's cubs?

105
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:57,791
You still think there is a
future for the Kogan Style?

106
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:04,166
The Kogan Style's future...
is within Mie-sama.

107
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,458
Mie-sama?

108
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,708
You fool!

109
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,208
The vessel called the heart...

110
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:14,833
Once it cracks...

111
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:18,666
...once it cracks it
can never fully be--

112
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,041
It will never heal!

113
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:24,458
This technique
is something I stole...

114
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,625
...from you Fujiki!

115
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,791
When we punished Irako...

116
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:31,833
...you recklessly showed
this secret to everyone...

117
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:34,875
The move that took
you so much effort...

118
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:38,375
See how inept you are...?!
You bastard!

119
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:08,083
Fujiki...

120
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,875
As I suspected...

121
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:15,666
You are...
on another level...!

122
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:23,416
That room...

123
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,791
For the Tiger's Cubs...
Today, becomes even larger.
