1
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:49,541
Six days after the party
at the Kengyou residence...

2
00:01:56,666 --> 00:02:01,208
About seventeen miles
away from Kakegawa...

3
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:04,750
At a post-station town
near Hamamatsu...

4
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,000
We have heard much
about the Kogan Style

5
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,958
skills you have
shown us today...

6
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:25,916
Having seen them in action
has enlightened my students.

7
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:32,500
It is not much, I know, for we
are a people of modest means.

8
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:36,958
But, please...
accept this meager token.

9
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,375
I sincerely appreciate it.

10
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:59,500
As the day of the full moon
in August draws closer,

11
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:02,208
they visit every dojo
that has the word

12
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:05,541
'unrivaled' scrawled
on their signboard.

13
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,541
This action is known widely as

14
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:14,458
"Tiger's visit
to unrivaled dojos."

15
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:17,416
It was through this that
Kogan earned his traveling

16
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,083
expenses when he
was a young samurai.

17
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:27,541
This summer, Gonzaemon
Ushimata has good reason

18
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:30,458
for completing
this journey alone...

19
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:38,458
There is no doubt in my mind...

20
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:42,208
...that Seigen Irako's intention
is to put an end to the

21
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:45,833
Kogan Style with
Kengyou's support.

22
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:48,375
Leaving the dojo
during such a crisis

23
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,916
is the last thing
I would like to do...

24
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,541
Please, Sensei...

25
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,500
Please let me stay with you.

26
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,541
No!

27
00:04:57,125 --> 00:05:00,791
This is a task
we must not neglect!!

28
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:20,125
And now, my hopes must rest...
with Fujiki...

29
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:24,750
The plan was for Sekiun
to slay Gennosuke Fujiki.

30
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:28,083
But that old fool stepped
in and saved you...

31
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:32,166
It seems that he did not
believe you to be strong enough.

32
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:36,833
And you are supposed to be the
successor to the Kogan Style?

33
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,208
Gennosuke-sama...

34
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:22,708
There are visitors
here to see you.

35
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:31,416
I am an Instructor
at Kogan's Noubi Dojo...

36
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,791
Hanshinken Ibuki.

37
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:34,916
Likewise...

38
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,166
Rokurobee Neoya.

39
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,083
Likewise, I am...

40
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,583
Unryusai Kanaoka.

41
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:50,125
You heard from Ushimata-shihan?

42
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,041
Correct...

43
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:52,875
In his letter,
he asked us to

44
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:57,291
fill in during his absence
from Iwamoto Dojo.

45
00:07:57,375 --> 00:08:04,041
Therefore...
We will protect Sensei.

46
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:11,750
Is there a problem?

47
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:15,208
Get up and go tell Sensei
we are here right now.

48
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,833
I am sorry...

49
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:21,791
...but Sensei is
resting at this time...

50
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,416
In his absence...

51
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,750
I would ask you to
have a match with me.

52
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:33,208
You are the one called Fujiki...

53
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:35,041
Are you not?

54
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:38,875
And you are saying you would
like to witness our skills.

55
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,833
I had heard
Fujiki was a

56
00:08:56,916 --> 00:09:00,666
stubborn and fearless
man, but this...

57
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:15,958
Kuramashi...

58
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:18,750
He dodged it!

59
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:27,333
Clearly I need not
go easy on this one.

60
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:45,833
That man, Gennosuke Fujiki...

61
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:49,166
It seems he is
truly not ordinary.

62
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:53,833
Since we have
revealed our plan to him,

63
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:57,791
sooner or later we
will have to settle things.

64
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,666
As a baby of no more
than a few months age,

65
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,541
I was abandoned by
my parents and

66
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:12,458
my eyes pecked out by crows...

67
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:17,750
Since that time, too far back to
remember, I have not seen light.

68
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,958
Because of my circumstance,

69
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,291
I had to gain the
light on my own...

70
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:23,541
Through performing arts,

71
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:27,541
social studies, community
status, even fame.

72
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:31,250
However...
there was one thing...

73
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:35,458
One mountain I could never
climb no matter my efforts.

74
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:41,458
That is martial, arts...
Seigen.

75
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,083
The last frontier...

76
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:54,708
...that which blind men
have no ability to reach.

77
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:58,083
But in this frontier
of martial arts,

78
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:00,500
your body hides
mysteries that would

79
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:03,625
surpass even
those men with sight.

80
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:10,250
This last light...

81
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:23,208
Will you share it with me...
Seigen Irako?

82
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:09,125
Fujiki...
Know that you are next.

83
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:39,291
On the night of the full
moon in mid-autumn...

84
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:42,291
It is a custom for samurai
households to keep their

85
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:46,125
doors wide open in
admiration of the moon.

86
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:57,375
Oh, Mie-dono.

87
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:58,375
Welcome...

88
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,375
Please sit down.

89
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:09,583
Her body had come
to life once more,

90
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:14,000
and again gave the appearance
of being dangerously seductive.

91
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:17,583
But for whom
did this change occur?

92
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:22,833
The moon is beautiful
hanging in the sky.

93
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,416
Iku...

94
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,250
Tonight...

95
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:17,000
Tonight, it all ends.

96
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:30,916
Their punishment and
subsequent exile from the

97
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,666
Kogan Style caused Irako
and Iku tremendous misery.

98
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:55,708
Iku...

99
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:58,875
Take cover.

100
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:16,250
You scum!

101
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:03,416
It was at this moment,
most unexpectedly,

102
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,708
that a great speed was achieved.

103
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,583
Stupid...

104
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:27,166
I was in too much of a hurry.

105
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:48,208
Seigen Irako must
have given this order.

106
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,375
Irako!

107
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,000
Poison?!
