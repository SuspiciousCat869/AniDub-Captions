1
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:56,541
Mie-sama is eating again...
I wonder...

2
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:37,875
The Kogan Style
apprentice murders

3
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:40,125
shocked everyone in Kakegawa.

4
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:43,250
It came to be known that
the one responsible for

5
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:46,083
vertically cutting the faces
of the four swordsmen

6
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,833
was their fellow apprentice
Sanjyuurou Okitsu.

7
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:53,416
Likewise, the one who
came to punish Okitsu

8
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,291
was his fellow apprentice
Gennosuke Fujiki.

9
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:02,541
What is truly fearful about the
Kogan Style is the members'

10
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:06,666
way of risking their lives in
swordsmanship competitions.

11
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:11,291
Many rumors have found their way
to a close through this manner.

12
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,500
Don't play dumb!

13
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:25,583
You two must have sold out the

14
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:28,666
Kogan Style for money,
just like Okitsu...!

15
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,708
Out with it!

16
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:33,833
I swear I would never
do such a thing.

17
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:45,416
I am not blind...!

18
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:48,500
You two are dogs!

19
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:54,625
Both of you are
Kengyou's lapdogs!

20
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,291
When the obsessed old
swordsman snapped out

21
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,833
of 49 days of dementia,
he became frenzied at the

22
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:08,333
betrayal by one
of his apprentices.

23
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:12,958
It was at that time a letter
was delivered by this man.

24
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,333
I do not understand...

25
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:38,875
If Kengyou Shizuhata is the
one behind the scenes,

26
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:41,208
controlling the
killing of our men,

27
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:45,208
why does he hide behind
a veil of anonymity?

28
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:59,375
When one faces this
biwa lute, it is the same as

29
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:03,000
being before
the Tokugawa Family.

30
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:24,791
Raise your head...
No need to be formal.

31
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:34,000
Kogan...
I am glad you came.

32
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,833
Of course...

33
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:59,916
You should start going
easier on yourself, Kogan...

34
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,166
I hear you are having difficulty
presenting yourself for duty.

35
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,500
Thank you for your concern.

36
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:09,375
You should also choose
your successor soon

37
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:10,916
and reassure our lord.

38
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,333
My daughter is
quite ill right now.

39
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,916
I would humbly
ask for more time.

40
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,208
Very well, Kogan.

41
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:22,375
Kakegawa treasures
the Kogan Style...

42
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:26,541
I wanted you to hear
those words from my lips.

43
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:31,958
I asked you to come
today because I wanted to

44
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:36,416
borrow the eyes of the
first-class Tiger swordsman.

45
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:13,250
What do you think
of Sekiun's sword?

46
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:19,291
You are said to be unrivaled,
so I want your expert opinion.

47
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:57,250
What do you see Kogan?
Is it a Wazamono?

48
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:01,458
This cannot cut...
It is for show.

49
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,875
For show, you say.

50
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:07,916
If I am not mistaken, Kogan,
your leading students

51
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,125
are praised as the 'two
dragons.' Is that correct?

52
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:15,208
One of them,
Gennosuke Fujiki, is here...

53
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,083
...but the other one has been...

54
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:19,208
Would you be so kind as to allow

55
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:22,375
Gennosuke to give
my Sekiun a lesson?

56
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,625
Show him some real swordplay?

57
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:59,000
They are ready, sir, and
awaiting your command.

58
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:06,291
Today, Gennosuke Fujiki
will use a bokken...

59
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:09,666
Since Sekiun's sword is nothing
more than a display piece,

60
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,791
this match will be just for fun.

61
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,833
So please...
both of you...

62
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,791
Have as much fun as you like.

63
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:21,541
The bokken has
not been doctored.

64
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,541
Se-- 

65
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:35,041
Sensei...

66
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:43,500
Kogan...
are you fighting?

67
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:50,250
Since this is for fun...

68
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:52,458
Sensei...

69
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:54,291
Stand down.

70
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,250
Now, boy...
Come at me.

71
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:47,458
Ridiculous...

72
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:50,458
He cannot cut with that grip.

73
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:54,666
Guarding, huh?
That is foolish.

74
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,583
Such a thin sword cannot...

75
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:06,625
However, Sensei
has only a bokken...

76
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:13,583
Perhaps, it might...

77
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:40,416
Spanish swordplay.

78
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:46,250
In Spanish swordplay, the sword
is not designed for cutting.

79
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:50,000
It is designed for thrusting.

80
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:37,166
Sekiun's father was a highly
stipended retainer of a lord.

81
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,916
Though shunned and
abandoned by his parents,

82
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,958
it was not because he lacked
enough hair to tie a topknot.

83
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:51,000
After wandering many places,
he ended up here.

84
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:56,333
In the care of Tada-aki Ini, a
user of the Single Sword Style.

85
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:00,083
This sword is from Spain,

86
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,791
a country in the land
known as Europe.

87
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:05,500
Hold it lightly, as you
would a feather duster...

88
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:08,750
and thrust it as if
striking a shuttlecock.

89
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:14,083
Sekiun...
You must master this thrust.

90
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:23,000
Sekiun did not know how
this bizarre sword became

91
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:25,541
separated from
its owner and arrived

92
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:28,291
from such a far
away foreign country...

93
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:32,250
...even so,
he saw himself in it.

94
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:06,166
This foreign sword perforated
top students of the

95
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,250
Single Sword
Style's Ono Faction,

96
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:11,250
like so much Swiss cheese.

97
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:15,333
And its certain
victory piercing thrust...

98
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,416
Sekiun-dono...

99
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,916
Is the opponent you
face this evening a tiger?

100
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:49,625
Not good.

101
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:54,333
Because Sekiun is retained by
Kengyou-sama, Sensei hesitates.

102
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:57,958
That man is too strong for
this to be merely for fun...

103
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:01,666
Damn that Irako.
He entrapped us!

104
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,666
What was that noise?

105
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:47,041
Sekiun-sama has fallen.

106
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:58,000
Since this was for fun...

107
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:01,666
I used my bare hands.

108
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:40,166
The reason Sekiun's
parents abandoned him

109
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,666
was because he
did not understand--

110
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,291
nor could he employ--

111
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:49,166
the loyalty that a samurai
feels towards his master.

112
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,625
To think he aimed
his vexation at losing

113
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:54,708
to you towards me,
his own master...

114
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:58,166
I suppose it is my fault
for paying a stipend to a

115
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,416
man I always suspected
of being disloyal.

116
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:05,500
Kogan... You did
well in punishing him...

117
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,666
I thank you for it.

118
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:41,500
Senior apprentices,
it has been a while.

119
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,500
Remember where we are Fujiki.

120
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:46,791
This is the residence
of Shizuhata-sama.

121
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:51,291
If we make waves here, Sensei
will be the one who is punished.

122
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:03,375
Ushimata-shihan.
Won't you have a drink first?

123
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:20,208
Forgive me...
As you know, I am blind...

124
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:21,541
Irako...

125
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:24,375
Was it you who tried to
kill Sensei by setting him

126
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:27,750
against that man
with European swordplay?

127
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:32,041
You accuse me falsely.

128
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:36,916
The plan was for Sekiun
to slay Gennosuke Fujiki.

129
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,375
But that old fool stepped
in and saved you...

130
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:44,500
It seems that he did not
believe you to be strong enough.

131
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:49,333
And you are supposed to be the
successor to the Kogan Style?

132
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:01,083
You are wrong, Irako.

133
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:04,208
Shizuhata-sama told
them to "have fun."

134
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:09,750
That is the only reason Sensei
told Fujiki to stand aside.

135
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:12,250
What are you trying to say?

136
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:16,583
Gennosuke Fujiki is
incapable of having fun.

137
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:48,791
A man who cannot
have fun, you say?

138
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,833
Nonsense.

139
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:53,083
You are the same
scum who joined in the

140
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:56,083
"fun" of burning a woman's
breast and who blinded me!

141
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:16,000
Fujiki...
Know that you are next.
