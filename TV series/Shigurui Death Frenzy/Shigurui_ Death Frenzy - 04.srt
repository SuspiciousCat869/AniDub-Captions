You show
much improvement...

23
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:11,833
You will soon be
ready to write on paper.

24
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:14,750
Hold it...!
I object...

25
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,541
Hold that last move.

26
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,208
I cannot hear you.

27
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:21,083
No holding in a
duel with real swords...

28
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:23,041
A senior apprentice
acting this way

29
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:26,125
is not fit to look
Fujiki in the face.

30
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,833
A fine job you did in
slaying the Funaki brothers.

31
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:35,333
Irako did
as much as I.

32
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:38,166
You killed the older
brother, Hyouma, first...

33
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,375
Irako only took advantage
of that opportunity.

34
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:44,166
Correct...
From a strategic angle,

35
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,833
you practically
killed them both.

36
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:55,625
Regardless, I wish
I could have seen it...

37
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,541
Irako must have
been quite astounded,

38
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,708
witnessing the
Kogan Style secret

39
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:02,916
technique Nagare for
the first time.

40
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,375
The "Number One Ladies
Man" of Kakegawa

41
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,750
has probably lost face.

42
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:54,416
How cruel...
how cruel...

43
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:14,250
Do you not place any
value upon your life?

44
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:24,041
One cannot die by
simply enjoying a hot bath.

45
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:32,833
The "How cruel,
how cruel" song is not a lie...

46
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:36,750
Men who come close to
me--well, you know the rest.

47
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:42,583
He's one of
Master's apprentices...

48
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:44,916
Seigen Irako...

49
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,916
My lady, there is something
I want to tell you.

50
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,791
Do you always do this?

51
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:54,916
The sword is a samurai's life...

52
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,791
Are you warm enough?

53
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,291
Please continue...

54
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,416
It is curious...

55
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,291
When I was ten years old,
my father ordered

56
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:15,541
you to hold metal sticks
thrust into hot coals...

57
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,125
I remember...

58
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,416
Even when the smell of
burning flesh filled the room,

59
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,250
your face never flinched...

60
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:26,875
Your eyes that day
filled me with fear.

61
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,666
The curse I bear is real...

62
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:41,250
Two men have
taken me as their wife...

63
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:44,416
And two men
have ended up dead...

64
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,916
Yet even though
my curse was to blame...

65
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,250
Master continues
to show me kindness.

66
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,041
Are you familiar with the

67
00:08:57,125 --> 00:09:00,250
sword called
"Nana-cho Nenbutsu"?

68
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,583
Nana-cho Nenbutsu...?

69
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,750
If I recall,
it was left in Master's

70
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:07,333
care by the Shogun Lord.

71
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,083
What I now tell you...

72
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,125
...is the tale of Sensei...

73
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:19,291
...and how he came to
keep that sword.

74
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:22,208
This Wazamono,
given me by Lord Yorinobu

75
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:24,333
is named "Nana-cho Nenbutsu"...

76
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:27,208
Which means
"The Half-Mile Prayer."

77
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:28,916
His retainer,

78
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,666
master swordsman
Lord Nagakatsu Tamiya,

79
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,916
used it on a Beggar Monk
in a roadside shrine...

80
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,375
While the monk was
indeed cut, he kept walking,

81
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,208
reciting his
prayer to Buddha,

82
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,875
without shedding
a single drop of blood.

83
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,625
Only after he
walked nearly half a mile...

84
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:49,416
...did his wound open
and blood gush out.

85
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,458
Tell me, Kogan...

86
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:54,458
Do you think this story is true?

87
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:57,666
I shall try it myself.

88
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:04,000
L-Let's go...
No use fighting.

89
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,000
I suppose it
was merely a rumor...

90
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:39,333
Or have your skills grown
weak with advancing age?

91
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,916
This sword cannot
be called a Wazamono.

92
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,541
It should be called
an accursed blade.

93
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:50,416
Entrusting it to one such
as you would surely

94
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,000
bring misfortune to his
lordship's family.

95
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:57,541
Is that right, Kogan?

96
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,208
My Lord...

97
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,958
Your time is done...

98
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:48,333
Then my fiancé...
The official who was killed...

99
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,291
Are you saying
Master did it?

100
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:52,958
I am his apprentice...

101
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:55,708
I cannot say anything more.

102
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,791
It is ludicrous to think of...

103
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,958
The man I have
been sleeping with...

104
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:04,208
...is responsible for
killing a man I loved.

105
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:07,208
The truth remains unclear...

106
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:11,541
But, what I want
to say to you is this...

107
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:19,500
You are a perfectly
normal woman...

108
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:23,750
That children's song...
is a joke.

109
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:40,958
♪ How cruel,
how cru-el... ♪

110
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:51,791
So, Ushimata-Shihan...

111
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,916
What is it that you
needed to discuss?

112
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,041
Sensei is thinking
about arranging a

113
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:02,916
marriage for Mie-dono...
to either you or Fujiki.

114
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,083
And become successor
to the Kogan Style...?

115
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:09,541
It is far more
than I deserve...

116
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,083
Let me tell you one thing...

117
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:16,166
You would be wise
to stop your frequent

118
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,333
visits to Lady Iku
in Togiya town.

119
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:22,458
What--are you talking about?

120
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:23,833
I followed you...

121
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:27,041
...from the bathhouse
the other day.

122
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,416
Oh that...

123
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,208
She felt dizzy
after a lengthy bath...

124
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:34,250
I was merely
escorting the lady home.

125
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,291
She had expressed
a growing fear of

126
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:40,125
the rats infesting her ceiling
space, and I offered to

127
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:43,083
stop by occasionally
to rid her of them...

128
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:45,375
I have done
so several times.

129
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:48,666
I have done nothing
to be ashamed of.

130
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,958
Do not insult me.

131
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:08,750
Irako...

132
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:14,791
...if Sensei were to become
aware of what you are doing...

133
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:18,958
I understand fully,
Shihan...

134
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:22,750
I will not
visit lady Iku again...

135
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:30,708
So he wants to give me
that virgin daughter of his...

136
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,875
If those are
Sensei's orders...

137
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:35,541
...how can I ignore him?

138
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:55,875
December,
in the First Year of Kan'ei.

139
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:19,500
The Kogan Style's
final training for the year...

140
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:22,625
...the Performance
of Mutou-Dori.

141
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:48,250
Sensei!

142
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:07,750
Father, please...!

143
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,583
What do you
want from me...?

144
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:12,208
What have I done?

145
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,583
Cuh--

146
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,291
Cuh--Conceive!

147
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:27,166
All due respect,
Mie-dono...

148
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:31,958
If I understand him...
Sensei wishes...

149
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:34,208
...for you and I to
have physical relations

150
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:36,250
right here and now.

151
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:38,916
Cuh--

152
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:46,500
Cuh-...
Conceive!

153
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,458
For a samurai family...

154
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:55,208
...a wedding ceremony
is a solemn act...

155
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:57,500
...performed to
continue the family name

156
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,541
and give birth to an heir.

157
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,291
There is no
room for the

158
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:03,583
personal feelings of
the betrothed...

159
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,500
All decisions are
made at the judgment

160
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:07,666
of the head of the family.

161
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,916
Utterly deplorable...

162
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:14,833
I take my leave of this farce.

163
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,958
Mie-dono!

164
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,083
It is nothing.

165
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,625
Ignore my father...

166
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:28,000
He is more deplorable
than usual today.

167
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:32,250
It is in your best interests
to leave here now as well.

168
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:40,583
Ushimata...

169
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,208
Out of my way!

170
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:47,958
Please return to
where you were seated.

171
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:52,708
Sensei has chosen Seigen
Irako to be your husband.

172
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:56,583
It is vital to the security
of the Kogan Style.

173
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:00,791
Fujiki...!

174
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,791
Those eyes...

175
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:25,291
The same eyes
he had that day...

176
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:30,041
Puppets...

177
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:33,416
Men are all puppets...

178
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:39,166
And I am a tool
for giving birth...

179
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:43,166
But the fruits
I bear will be rotten.

180
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:51,291
I'll kill myself...

181
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:56,833
I'll bite off my own tongue...
and kill myself.

182
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,708
Please forgive
my impertinence...

183
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:14,208
If I force myself
on her now...

184
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:17,250
Mie-sama will
take her own life.

185
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:20,625
If that happens...
your family line ends.

186
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,083
For her sake...

187
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,791
...and that of
the Kogan Style...

188
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:25,791
Allow us...

189
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:29,583
...to continue
after the wedding.

190
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:41,291
My--my heir...
It is born!

191
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,666
Seigen Irako was no puppet...

192
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:53,541
He was something
far more horrific...

193
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,083
Irako-sama...

194
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:06,166
What have I done
to warrant this punishment?

195
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:10,750
Do not worry...
I will not do anything violent.

196
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:24,375
Irako-sama...!
What is this...?

197
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,916
The Kogan
Style successor...

198
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,583
The Kakegawa Domain
Martial Arts Instructor...

199
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:32,708
A fief of 300 koku...

200
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,666
The Suruga Domain
Swordplay Instructor,

201
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,708
Tamiya,
the Lord of Tsushima...

202
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:38,458
800 koku...

203
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:40,458
The Shogunate Family
Swordplay Instructor,

204
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:41,833
Munenori Yagyu...

205
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,750
3000 koku...

206
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:47,125
How far will my
swordplay take me?!

207
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:05,083
It is a joyous day today...

208
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:10,458
It is a joyous day...

209
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:14,500
Sensei has made his choice...

210
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:16,666
Irako...

211
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:24,916
I am Iemon Shigaraki
of the Funaki Style...

212
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,625
To avenge Hyouma and Kazuma,
I shall take your head.

213
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:39,000
It was not you, was it...?

214
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:41,000
Your hands lack
the skill to have

215
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:43,250
defeated the Funaki brothers.

216
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,000
Impossible...

217
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:59,333
So fast...

218
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:11,958
From his
frozen fingertips,

219
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:14,833
a new technique
was suddenly born...

220
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:17,583
And it was good.
