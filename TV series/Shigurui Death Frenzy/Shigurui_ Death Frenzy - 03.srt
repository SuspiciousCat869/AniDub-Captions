1
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:04,458
He actually did it.

2
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:05,541
Yes...

3
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:06,791
The Hachimaki-Giri is

4
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:09,250
Ushimata-shihan's
special technique.

5
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,583
The real question is
when did Irako master it?

6
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:14,750
Natural talent...
What he was born with probably

7
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:18,416
outweighs our natural
abilities combined.

8
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:21,083
In just one short
year of being with

9
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:24,000
our dojo he has accomplished
impressive many things.

10
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:26,625
By comparison,
Assistant Instructor Fujiki

11
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:28,916
is hardly taken
notice of lately.

12
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,083
The way things stand, the
successor of the Kogan Style

13
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:35,500
might not be who we
have anticipated.

14
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,750
Fujiki...

15
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,833
A year surely passes quickly.

16
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:31,333
Yes...

17
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:38,250
In just one short year...
I have come so far...

18
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:42,375
Kogan Iwamoto...

19
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:44,208
His demented state keeps hidden

20
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:47,375
numerous secret
swordplay techniques.

21
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:50,833
Mie Iwamoto...

22
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:53,375
She is a vessel
that will give birth to

23
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:56,333
the successor of
the Kogan Style.

24
00:06:56,416 --> 00:07:00,875
The Kogan Style will be mine...
And when it is...

25
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:03,625
I will bleed it dry.

26
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:08,083
We humbly thank you for
your loyal patronage.

27
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,333
Certainly...

28
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:12,083
Put it on the tab for the
Iwamoto household.

29
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:14,750
Yes, of course...
And thank you, madam.

30
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:17,500
Please, take care of yourselves.

31
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:03,041
Neri, huh?

32
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,416
Is it raw enthusiasm
that leads you to

33
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:10,250
attempt my method of training?
Or is it merely curiosity?

34
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,166
I have a request.

35
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,416
I know.

36
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:24,375
But you are not allowed a
sparring match with Irako.

37
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,125
Because if you were
to match blades,

38
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:29,083
it would not be
only for practice.

39
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,458
Fujiki, you are
Naka-Mokuroku in the

40
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,958
Kogan Style--an advanced pupil.

41
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:37,916
Why do you concern
yourself with practice drills?

42
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,125
That bastard...

43
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,958
He lacks the etiquette
for martial arts...

44
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:43,041
His behavior...

45
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,500
...sets a bad example
for the others.

46
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,458
Nonsense...

47
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,375
There is something else that

48
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,750
lurks in the corners
of your mind...

49
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:53,291
A thought that disturbs
your consciousness

50
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,666
and dulls your swordplay.

51
00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:00,916
Did you think I could not see
through to your very core?

52
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,875
Father!

53
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:51,750
I am not Iku...!
It is Mie!

54
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,750
I am not Iku!

55
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:22,416
Good, Mie.
The vessel is finally ready.

56
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:29,708
Bath...

57
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,708
Yes, sir.

58
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:35,916
At some point between
every fall and winter,

59
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,875
Kogan will awaken from
his demented state.

60
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:42,958
He is normal for only one
half a day at the longest.

61
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:45,083
It is during this short
period of time that he

62
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:48,291
gives instructions for the
dojo while the apprentices

63
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:51,291
seek to satisfy these
demands to the letter.

64
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:55,125
This...
is the Kogan Style practice.

65
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,458
Gonza...

66
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,125
Sensei?

67
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:06,500
Who do you think should be
the Kogan Style successor?

68
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:09,083
Fujiki or Irako?

69
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:12,583
Gennosuke Fujiki
would be my choice.

70
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:14,083
And why is that?

71
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:18,083
Above all else, because
he respects Mie-dono.

72
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:22,166
Raise your head.

73
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,458
What did you say?

74
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:30,000
What was that about Mie?

75
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:33,375
You can say it...

76
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:37,083
If only the girl had
been born a boy.

77
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,000
I do not care about respect.

78
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:43,083
I am asking which of these two
men will give the stronger seed.

79
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:45,791
And in that...

80
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:49,208
...you would say they
stand even, correct?

81
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:56,208
In the town of Nissaka...

82
00:11:56,291 --> 00:12:01,750
I believe Ichidensai
Funaki has twin sons.

83
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:03,958
Their heads...

84
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:08,208
Bring me the heads
of Funaki's sons.

85
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:11,000
This task is for
Fujiki and Irako...

86
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:13,916
The one of them
who completes this...

87
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,750
...will seed my bloodline.

88
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,500
In Kakegawa Domain,
Ichidensai Funaki has

89
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:35,125
been called a master swordsman
since the Keichou Era.

90
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,875
In his dojo, a special
swordplay technique

91
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:43,625
is performed every spring.

92
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:44,000
Brother!

93
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,416
Got it!

94
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,666
Hyouma and Kazuma Funaki.

95
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,291
They have mastered
the secret of Kabuto-Nage

96
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:57,666
and are fully proficient
in the Funaki Style.

97
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:01,875
They are the strongest
swordsmen in Nissaka.

98
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,666
But why Funaki's sons?

99
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:11,166
Long ago, during a match
before the shogun lord,

100
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,666
Sensei sliced off
Ichidensai's lower jaw.

101
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,875
It was after this
that the lord spoke.

102
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:21,083
Believing Sensei
had lacked in manners,

103
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,166
he severely punished him.

104
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:26,500
Perhaps he has not
forgotten such humiliation.

105
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,791
At any rate, the
country is at peace...

106
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:33,916
Even if the dojos of
the Kogan and Funaki

107
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,041
agree to having a
match with real swords...

108
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,875
...decapitation of
another as if in battle...

109
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:42,375
They probably will
not even agree to it.

110
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:45,250
Even so, how could
we approach such a matter--

111
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:48,833
asking them to have matches
so we can choose our successor.

112
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:51,000
We would be laughed at.

113
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:56,333
The order given us by Sensei...
is simply too unreasonable.

114
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:59,333
However...
Sensei's word is absolute.

115
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:04,125
It is our duty as apprentices
to follow it to the letter.

116
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:18,958
Around 6pm.
Nakayama Pass in Sayo.

117
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,500
The name Sayo
comes from the word

118
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,458
'Sai' which means 'obstruct.'

119
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,541
The name Nakayama
means 'boundary.'

120
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:48,125
Do you know why
the rock before us cries?

121
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:50,916
The story I have heard,

122
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,583
tells that it used to be
a God of Obstruction,

123
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:57,500
that protected travelers
by blocking evil spirits.

124
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,708
One day, a pregnant
woman named Oishi

125
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:04,708
went to Kikukawa
village to work.

126
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:10,458
She was on her way back home
when her stomach began hurting.

127
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:16,958
A passing samurai found her, but
could not leave her there...

128
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,208
He tended to her
with the greatest of care.

129
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:20,666
But...

130
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:35,458
The woman was
killed by a Kamaitachi...

131
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:37,666
Now possessed
within this rock...

132
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,666
...her soul forever weeps.

133
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:46,750
Nissaka...
is a dangerous place.

134
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:15,666
So, big brother...

135
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,083
Have you given any
thought to getting married?

136
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:21,375
It would certainly alleviate
some of our father's stress.

137
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,750
I would have to be
careful in my choice.

138
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:27,791
She would, after all,
serve you as well.

139
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:44,125
Both body and soul...
have been purified.

140
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:02,208
Who are you...?

141
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:06,166
Do you not realize we are Hyouma
and Kazuma of Funaki Dojo?

142
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,708
If you desire a match, the
proper way is to follow the

143
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:12,708
samurai code and let us know
the time and place beforehand.

144
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,416
We are not samurai.

145
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:19,208
We are Kamaitachi
from Nakayama Pass.

146
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:26,666
You look rather small for
a supernatural being!

147
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,500
Our style will teach
you a lesson in humility.

148
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,833
Kabuto Wari...

149
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,208
Fujiki...

150
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:22,125
I can move
more quickly than him.

151
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,291
I know I can.

152
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,916
But striking
simultaneously will not work...

153
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,958
So what will?

154
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:45,375
Why do you pause...?
Do you wait for the sun to rise?

155
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,500
Kamaitachi, do not scare...

156
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:51,750
These men...
are from Kogan.

157
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:01,375
Fujiki from Kakegawa.

158
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,541
If a man of Kogan Style lifts

159
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:15,250
his sword above
his head, beware.

160
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:18,000
With this much
distance between us...

161
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,916
What can he do?

162
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,250
He's too far.

163
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,083
Brother...

164
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:47,708
Too far.

165
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:50,916
He's too far.

166
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,583
It is the quickest
slashing attack that is

167
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:59,125
capable of slaying the
opponent instantly.

168
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:02,000
This technique is a secret
passed on only to those who

169
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:05,375
are Naka-Mokuroku and
above in the Kogan Style.

170
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,791
It is expressly
forbidden from being

171
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,833
used in practice at the dojo.

172
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:13,333
And it is called...
Nagare.

173
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:18,916
Brother!

174
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,083
Irako.

175
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,541
Rinse your mouth.
