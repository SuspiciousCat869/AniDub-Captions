1
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:19,958
Sensei.

2
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:28,125
When a dead body
is discovered within

3
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:30,291
the Kogan Dojo's premises...

4
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:32,583
...the first
suspect to consider...

5
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:36,125
...should not be an outsider.

6
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,541
Pardon me.

7
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:07,041
Please take your time.

8
00:03:57,208 --> 00:04:01,250
It is not Kogan Sensei
who killed Suzu.

9
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:06,250
And therefore...

10
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:10,375
...we need to tell the local
officials about this incident.

11
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,916
The clothing around his neck
is not stained with blood.

12
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,791
Which means his head
was severed from his

13
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,833
body after his heart stopped.

14
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:32,583
Then that means...

15
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:35,583
Suzunosuke's life was
taken by the singular

16
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:39,625
stroke which split his
soft face down the middle.

17
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,000
Ushimata...

18
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:48,458
Do you have any
suspects in mind?

19
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:50,958
The other day a
ronin spoke poorly of

20
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:54,125
Kogan Style and
Suzu executed him.

21
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,291
What a foolish thing to do.

22
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:59,833
Here at Kakegawa...
there are masses of ronin

23
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:03,166
who seek to be employed
by Tadanaga-sama.

24
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:07,375
And the violence these
men bring with them...

25
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:10,083
...becomes more difficult
to watch by the day...

26
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:13,916
It may not be easy to get
a good idea of who did it.

27
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:06,833
Suzunosuke...

28
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:13,708
Tell me...
Why were you crying then?

29
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,833
The unrivaled Kogan Style
has been disgraced...

30
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:23,166
We have to take care
of this killer quickly...

31
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,708
If we let this go much longer,
people will scorn us.

32
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:31,291
Once we become a laughingstock
it will be too late.

33
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:34,583
We will lose our reputation
and never get it back.

34
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:44,083
Then our best option
is to invent a killer.

35
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,833
What do you mean by 'invent'?

36
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:50,166
Are we to choose
a person at random

37
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,541
to take the fall as murderer...?

38
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:55,333
That would mean the real
killer would walk away free.

39
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:58,708
It must be known that those
who oppose the Kogan Style

40
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,833
will be dealt with swiftly.

41
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:05,208
So our suspect cannot
be just anyone...

42
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:09,250
He must be highly skilled
in the ways of a warrior.

43
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:16,333
Jingoro Higaki.
He uses the single sword style.

44
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,958
A most suitable candidate.

45
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:20,750
Where is he?

46
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,833
I heard that after
he lost to Ushimata,

47
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:25,500
he secluded himself in
Awagatake Mountain and

48
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:29,000
now spends all of his time
improving his swordsmanship.

49
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,333
Eventually, we will
slay the true killer.

50
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:46,791
Hold that vexation in your
heart for the time being.

51
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,833
Shinpachirou Munakata...

52
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:58,166
The twenty-two sword wounds,
on his body of steel are just

53
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,166
like those of a
fierce warrior from the

54
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,416
Period of Warring States.

55
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:07,625
The wounds on his palms tell
an even more graphic story.

56
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,958
Who is there?

57
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:55,541
My name is Shinpachirou
Munakata of the Kogan Style.

58
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:58,375
I...
am glad you came.

59
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:03,000
I was thinking of going to see
you lovely people very soon.

60
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,958
You will face me in battle.

61
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:34,041
You should have left
Kakegawa long ago.

62
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,958
I have slain
the chosen killer...

63
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:41,458
...for the murder of
Suzunosuke Kondou.

64
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:30,833
Is that a madman I see?

65
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,166
That is no walking stick...

66
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,250
It is him...!

67
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:56,291
This is Suzunosuke's
true killer!

68
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,541
It may be possible
for the Kogan Style

69
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:24,958
to save face in this matter.

70
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:27,958
However...

71
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,166
Where is the honor in it...?

72
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:35,333
Can this truly settle the score
for Suzunosuke's death?

73
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:20,875
Well then...
I take my leave now.

74
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:24,875
Thank you for troubling
yourself to come here.

75
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,166
As before...
It was an upward cut.

76
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:44,208
This is obviously the work of
the same person who killed Suzu.

77
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:49,916
Munakata was approved
based on his skills, right?

78
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,708
Yet being split down
the middle like that...

79
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,666
Must have let his guard down.

80
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,333
How unsightly.

81
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:04,416
Yamazaki...
watch what you say.

82
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,625
Munakata was one of us!

83
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:08,250
Stop it.

84
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:12,833
This is no time for fighting
amongst our own brethren.

85
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:30,625
Remain on your guard...
Our enemy is very skilled.

86
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,291
Right, an imitation sword.

87
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:52,000
He said when Munakata's
head was put out in

88
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:55,375
public an imitation
sword was in his mouth.

89
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,666
Why would the
killer take the time to

90
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,416
do something so
stupid like that?

91
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:04,041
Don't you get it?

92
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:06,250
He is saying
that the Kogan Style...

93
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:09,583
...is as dull as
an imitation sword.

94
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:35,041
Are--Are you
with the Kogan Style?

95
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:38,041
You say that we are dull?

96
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,125
No...
Not me.

97
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:41,958
I never said that!

98
00:14:56,666 --> 00:15:01,250
Confine your tongue,
lest it confine you.

99
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:40,750
I remember on that
day how the cicadas

100
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,875
were as noisy as they are now.

101
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:46,208
What day was this?

102
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,666
Nevermind.

103
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:28,750
Fujiki-sama...

104
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:36,291
She has been like this
for about an hour now.

105
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,375
Mie-sama? 

106
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:02,041
Wha--...?
Was it you...?

107
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:04,708
Was it you who killed Suzu...?

108
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,375
Was it?!
