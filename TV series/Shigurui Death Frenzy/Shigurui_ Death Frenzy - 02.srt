1
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,791
Keichou Year 6.

2
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,083
Kogan Iwamoto.

3
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:03,458
A warrior said to be
unrivaled in the Noubi area.

4
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:25,083
His right hand
had one more finger

5
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:27,875
on it than any normal hand.

6
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:31,000
It was Sadakatsu Matsudaira,

7
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:33,750
then Lord of Kakegawa,
who said...

8
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:39,625
The Kogan Style Secret Swordplay
Technique, Nagareboshi...

9
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:43,833
Its mysteriousness
is unequaled...

10
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:46,958
...throughout all of history.

11
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,166
Shall I do that for you?

12
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,333
Please...
Do not worry about me.

13
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:45,541
This is excellent
training for my fingers.

14
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:29,250
So...
How is Fujiki holding up?

15
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:33,250
While it was only training...

16
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,916
I cannot say I am surprised...

17
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,375
To lose so badly,
so disgracefully

18
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:40,833
and to a challenger
of our dojo, no less.

19
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:06,125
He refused to open up,
even when Mie approached him.

20
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:08,708
My feeling is that
he will not be up to any

21
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:10,833
lessons of reading
and writing today.

22
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:12,625
It may be only my imagination...

23
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:16,375
But Mie has acted
oddly since the match.

24
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:19,375
Use care when
choosing your words.

25
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:22,750
This man Irako,
with his skills and attitude...

26
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:25,000
He impresses me as dangerous...

27
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:28,708
I imagine he will be
quite difficult to deal with.

28
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:33,208
I hope we did not bring
trouble down upon ourselves.

29
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:36,375
Not to worry.
He is a fool.

30
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,375
That leap...!

31
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:26,291
I knew it was out
of the ordinary.

32
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,500
He reads the distance
to his opponent.

33
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:37,375
I have seen through your
moves to your weaknesses...

34
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:40,000
Knowing this, you should
concede the match...

35
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:43,125
Show the integrity of a samurai.

36
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:48,416
Well, Ushimata-dono?

37
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:56,958
Ootsubo, Yamauchi...
Block all the exits.

38
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:03,125
It seems Instructor Ushimata
has finished warming up.

39
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:04,791
Excuse me.

40
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,208
I have not yet
mastered this technique...

41
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:23,333
...but I will still show
you the Kogan Style.

42
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:58,666
His smile...
It has vanished.

43
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:09,083
Killing him would be easy.

44
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:12,708
Making him into
something else, however...

45
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:34,666
Finally...

46
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:38,875
I have come to face what I
know is true swordsmanship.

47
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,333
I now know regret...

48
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:44,708
...of the days I have
spent as a rogue.

49
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,250
Starting at this very moment...

50
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:52,375
I would like to become
a pupil at this dojo.

51
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:06,291
A dojo is no place for
these kinds of theatrics.

52
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:10,416
He looks to have made
Instructor Ushimata quite angry.

53
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,750
Violating our hallowed
dojo with this charade...

54
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:18,583
My sword!

55
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,583
My sword!
Out of my way!

56
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,500
That is mine!
Take your hand off of it!

57
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,375
Challenging swordsmen
of other styles

58
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:29,833
is simply another
part of training.

59
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:32,958
It is never a matter
of life and death.

60
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:02,958
The bastard actually
has some natural talent.

61
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:06,000
No...
That is not talent you see.

62
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,708
It is cowardice.

63
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,541
Bring me a spear.

64
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,458
How is he?

65
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:23,541
He said he would not eat until
his request had been granted.

66
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:26,458
What a stubborn one.

67
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:30,208
He will be quite a
challenge to deal with.

68
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:04,000
Ushimata-dono...

69
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:06,916
I must apologize
for this, my lady...

70
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,083
But I have to ask you to leave.

71
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:11,958
I am here because
Master asked me to come.

72
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,291
I understand.

73
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:16,291
However, you will not
be able to see him today.

74
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,333
I am sorry.

75
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:44,666
The size of this place...

76
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,375
The number of servants...

77
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,875
Exactly what I would
expect from the

78
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:58,791
famed martial arts instructor
in Kakegawa Domain.

79
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:02,416
Must be at least 300 koku...

80
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:15,625
The only daughter
of Kogan Iwamoto.

81
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,166
Mosuke?

82
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,625
Yes.

83
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:40,208
It is ready for you now.

84
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,875
I prepared it using
thick malt syrup in addition

85
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,916
to the kuzuan sweet sauce.

86
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,125
Please enjoy.

87
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:21,166
The amount of
stickiness is just right.

88
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:41,791
If I marry into the family,
I become Kogan's successor...

89
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:45,958
Gaining also the Kakegawa
retainer worth 300 koku...

90
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,625
Not too bad.

91
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:57,333
Ah, Ushimata-dono!

92
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,041
Seigen Irako...

93
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:06,333
Our Sensei would
like to see you now.

94
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,083
That is wonderful news!

95
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:12,625
I take it to mean he has granted
my request to become his pupil?

96
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:15,916
Sensei will make that decision.

97
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:22,333
So, I will finally
meet Kogan Iwamoto...

98
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,041
A rare master swordsman,

99
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:27,166
who has even faced battle
with Munenori Yagyu...

100
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,416
In another time,
Kogan himself might have

101
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,166
become swordplay instructor
to the Shogun family.

102
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,708
What an unusual grip.

103
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:57,375
Plus he's fast,
and has a long reach.

104
00:16:57,458 --> 00:17:00,291
Stepping into that
range is foolhardy...

105
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,791
Very well...

106
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:08,416
Yagyu Shinkage Style...
Juumonji!

107
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:12,291
Very nice.

108
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:23,458
Kogan Style, Nagareboshi!

109
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:41,000
I should not do this...
I should not fight any longer.

110
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:44,791
Even through the use of my
certain victory technique...

111
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:48,416
I stand no chance
of defeating this man.

112
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,666
I yield.

113
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:59,250
The match is a draw.

114
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:17,208
I have seen your skills
and judged you worthy.

115
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:20,666
I will recommend you
to the Tokugawa family.

116
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:25,375
Thank you for this honor.

117
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,500
However...

118
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:38,500
You wish to work for us...

119
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:42,458
Why do you hide your finger?

120
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,708
It is displeasing.

121
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,250
An insult.

122
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:58,416
His Highness Taiko has the exact
same number of fingers as you...

123
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,166
Are you saying that
this is displeasing?

124
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:06,625
Driven by ambition,
Kogan asked Munenori Yagyu for

125
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:10,458
his assistance in preparing for
his audience with the official.

126
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:13,791
Therefore, it was he
who advised Kogan to hide

127
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:16,083
his extra finger
during this audience...

128
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:19,416
It was his cunning that
crushed Kogan's ambition.

129
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,875
Bunroku Year 4.

130
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:48,833
Ushimata-dono...

131
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:51,166
If you keep me
tied up like this...

132
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,916
I cannot show
Sensei every courtesy.

133
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,333
Do not bow your
head before him...

134
00:19:56,416 --> 00:20:00,750
Remain steady and look
Sensei directly in the eyes.

135
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:03,666
Do not move even a muscle.

136
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:22,583
This ritual...
What kind of charm is this?

137
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:36,875
Sensei will now appear.

138
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,541
Ushimata-dono!

139
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:14,083
No Sensei, this is not Iku-sama.

140
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:18,458
This is a man who wants to
join the dojo and be your pupil.

141
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,916
Magnificent.

142
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,166
Magnificent...

143
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,583
Most magnificent...
Do you see?

144
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:44,250
The Yodare-Azuki Bean Ceremony.

145
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:48,416
A decorum for the commencement
of training in the Kogan Style.

146
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:08,166
No one knows when it was
that Kogan Iwamoto began

147
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:12,125
his descent into such
a demented state.
