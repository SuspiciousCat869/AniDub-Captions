[SUZUHA] Let me put it
into perspective for you:

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,333
that's upwards of 5.7
billion human lives

6
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:26,625
snuffed out by the year 2036.

7
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:28,333
And it all starts with this.

8
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,416
[MAYURI]
But what is "this"?

It's a time machine, Daru.

--Huh?

You're familiar with it.

That's good, Uncle. Very good.

00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:58,666
I've run interference--

24
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,125
so many times I'm
barely myself anymore.

25
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:03,458
The only way I was able to
land back onto this world line

26
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:05,958
was by allowing Kurisu to die.

27

And now you're asking me
to go another round?

Rintarou. Hear me out.

00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,000
What if I told you the
circumstances of her death

of July 28th, 2010

kicked off the war?

I don't have a clue
how it all dovetails.

42
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,666
All I know is I've
been entrusted

43
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,416
with an important mission:

44
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,333
rescue Makise Kurisu and
shift things to a world line

45
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:53,250
beyond the divergence barrier,
free of the attractor field.

46
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:55,625
A little place we
call Stei's Gate.

47
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:34,500
[OKABE]
I don't believe it.

48
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,541
You actually hatched
this plan yourself.

49
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:38,708
By that I mean you will.

00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,291
With Dad.

51
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:43,000
Though you're the first to
admit it's pure conjecture.

Push comes to shove,

53
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,291
it's possible this is
all wishful thinking.

54
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:48,291
Even if a Steins Gate
world line exists,

55
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,791
the odds of us reaching
one are slim to none.

nothing gained, right?

taking a chance, right?

only go backward in time,

96

but forward?

97

Uh--I should hope so.

the point if we couldn't?

line than its twin.

because I can't
change our position.

105

If we stir up trouble
at the Radio Building,

106
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:55,375
it might throw Kurisu's
movements out of whack.

I, uh...

161
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:19,291
Uh--

162
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,291
I'm just... here to see...

163
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,125
[FEMALE ANNOUNCEMENT]
Your attention, please.

164
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,250
Doctor Nakabachi's conference
is about to begin

165
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:29,916
on the 8th floor lecture hall.

166
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,125
All who are interested
are welcome...

167
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:33,458
[MAKISE]
At least finish a sentence!

168
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:34,375
[MAKISE sighs]

169
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,583
[NAKABACHI] Printed on the
handouts there in front of you

170
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,291
is more or less
the hard blueprint

171
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,833
for one of mankind's
oldest ambitions.

172
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,791
Of course, the
theoretical scaffolding

173
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,666
begs some explanation.

174
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:47,916
[NAKABACHI]
As I'm sure you're aware,

175
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,250
mainstream science currently...

176
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:50,583
[SUZUHA]
In the brief I was given,

177
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,541
they said you'd be able
to pick her out instantly.

178
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:53,791
Is that true?

179
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:54,833
[OKABE]
Yeah.

180
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:56,375
[SUZUHA]
Right. Bear in mind, though.

181
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,458
It's probably a bad idea
to take her off site.

182
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,291
We don't know who
kills her or why.

183
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:01,500
And in the event
that her death is

184
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:02,875
a fixed point on the timeline,

185
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:04,791
we don't want things
getting more complicated.

186
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,833
I learned that the
hard way with Mayuri.

[OKABE]
I have none, sir!

192

I throw down the gauntlet as
to your "theory's" authorship!

this is where she'll end up.

[gasps] Wait!

198
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:29,958
What if she's killed somewhere
else and dragged here?

199
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:32,041
Damn it! I hadn't
thought of that!

This is where it happens.

[OKABE]
What is that she's reading?

[OKABE]

206
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:53,000
Is that why so much
is riding on this?

Look, please.

212
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,500
I just want you to
read this, 'kay, Dad?

[OKABE]
"Dad"?

214

[OKABE gasps]
Nakabachi's her dad?!

215
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,208
Look, I... I'm just trying
to bury the hatchet.

216
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,708
It's been years. Too damn long.

217
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,916
I want you in my life again.

218
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,875
[OKABE] Don't tell me
her father's the one who--

219
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:22,250
[MAKISE] ...as you
like to say, and well,

220
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:25,208
I'm now convinced that
you were right all along.

221
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,708
I wanted your opinion
on the theory.

222
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,541
If this paper gets accepted,

223
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,625
you can lord it over
all the stuffed shirts

who laughed you
out of the academy.

225

[NAKABACHI gasps]
I did not get "laughed out"!

226
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,041
I turned my back
on their politics

227

to pursue my
researches unfettered!

[NAKABACHI]
Hmph.

00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,041
[NAKABACHI]
This isn't half bad.

231
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,625
[MAKISE]
Really?

232
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:47,416
'Cause I was thinking, maybe,
if you were okay with the idea,

233
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,750
we could publish it
under both of our names.

inspired me to--

Don't be ridiculous.

sees the light of day,

Walk it off. Look,
I know you're in shock,

but you've got to
pick yourself up.

We've got enough fuel
for one more trip

Shut up!

I won't do it!

I won't put myself
through that again!

That is not true.

Are you mad?

00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,333
I tried dozens of times!
No, double--triple that!

355
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:24,208
And every time, I failed!

I know how cruel time can be.

You may not think that's true,
but believe me, I do.

We like to imagine we can bend
it to suit us, when really--

[OKABE]
Really...

00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,208
[OKABE]
This was bound to happen.

It was stupid of me

I'm sorry, but...

But at this rate,

372

[MAYURI]
And why?

373
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,625
Why does Okarin have to carry
the weight of the future

374
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:21,208
all by himself?

375

It's too much for him.

376
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,875
[SUZUHA] Because Uncle
Okarin has an ability

377
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:29,500
that lets him observe and
remember the world lines.

378
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:32,791
[MAYURI] But Okarin never
asked for that responsibility.

379
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,791
Look what it's done to him.

380
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:38,625
If he tries again, he's only
going to end up hurt more.

it's probably impossible
