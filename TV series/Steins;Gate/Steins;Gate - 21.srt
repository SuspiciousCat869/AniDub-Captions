1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,625
But to keep
Mayuri alive...

2
00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:14,333
To return to that version of
fate... Makise Kurisu...

3
00:00:14,416 --> 00:00:15,708
...must die...

4
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:17,500
Alright. Let's
delete this puppy.

5
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:19,250
Stop!

6
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:23,166
It isn't necessary.

7
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,875
It can't be.

8
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,708
Where's Okabe?

9
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:07,666
No idea. Been too busy to
keep tabs on him.

10
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,916
Break a leg out
there, Mayushii!

11
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,166
Same to you, soldier!

12
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,833
Peace out!

13
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:16,083
So I take this is the last
day of Comima?

14
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:18,208
Yup. You should totally
come with me...!

15
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:20,500
There's so much adorable
cosplay to scope out!

16
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:23,500
Uh... I'm... pretty sure
it'd wouldn't be my thing.

17
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,916
Where did Okarin run off to?

18
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,958
Your guess is as good
as mine, sweetie;

19
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:31,041
who knows what rock
he's under...

20
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:33,750
Or why he called
off the hack.

21
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:42,250
It's gonna get up to like
a million degrees today.

22
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,750
Even mad scientists
have to keep hydrated

23
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:47,291
if they don't want a visit
from Uncle Heat Stroke.

24
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,708
You going back to
Comima I assume?

25
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:52,125
Yup! Wouldn't miss it.

26
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:54,291
Yes, well. Be careful.

27
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,208
K.

28
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:04,333
There... That'll give you a
little shade... See you later!

29
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:07,125
Wait...!

30
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:15,375
Think it through, Okabe...

31
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:18,166
Every D-mail undone has
pushed Mayuri's death

32
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,458
back another
twenty-four hours...

33
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:22,250
Originally it occurred
on the thirteenth;

34
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:25,875
undoing Suzuha's text
moved it to the fourteenth...

35
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:29,500
Then Faris',
Ruka's, Moeka's...

36
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,958
Every reversal has
bought us a day...

37
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:34,000
Which means if I'm
doing the math right,

38
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:38,041
on this world-line Mayuri will
die at 8 o'clock on August 17th.

39
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,500
Today.

40
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,000
Okarin!

41
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,333
I'd say it sounds like you
honed in on your quarry.

42
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:49,625
Uh-huh! Good thing
I found 'em when I did:

43
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:53,125
they were almost sold
out! Daru's gonna flip!

44
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:55,166
Oh... They have this
cool art book on some

45
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,541
mecha show I'd never seen,
too... You should come see!

46
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,750
Oh... I Believe I'll pass.

47
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:03,375
Are you sure...?
I could take you to it.

48
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:06,250
Thank you, no...
I'm a bit preoccupied.

49
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,833
Poor Okarin...

50
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:10,875
Well, if there is anything you
wanna see, I know the layout.

51
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:14,083
Dully noted.

52
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:16,083
We can leave... I mean, if...

53
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:18,958
Bah...! Come now,
don't be absurd...

54
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:20,541
When I say "preoccupied,"

55
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,833
I'm referring to my never-ending
vigil against the Organization,

56
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:25,208
who, I've grok-ed from
various trustworthy sources,

57
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:26,375
have set this place crawling

58
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,458
with specially trained
ninja assassins.

59
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:29,875
Perfect place for
them, really...

60
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:32,458
They blend with the costumed
crowd like cephalopods.

61
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:35,791
Wow... Sounds like they go to
an awful lot of trouble, huh?

62
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,458
I'm going to try and
get the drop on them.

63
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:40,500
Reconvene here at
1500 hours, understood?

64
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:41,708
Sir!

65
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,333
Oh, hey...!

66
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:45,875
They've got a concession
stand just a little ways down

67
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:47,208
from the entrance!

68
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,708
Five hours... Stiff upper lip...

69
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,416
Push through to an answer...

70
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,791
You've got to keep
Mayuri from dying

71
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:56,250
without jumping from
this world-line.

72
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:06,625
You expect me to go near his
stuff without a hazmat suit...

73
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:10,750
Okay, okay. Slow down.
Just... Give me a second.

74
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:12,750
These bookshelves
look like a war zone.

75
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:18,291
Would it be a thick as a normal
directory, you think, or--?

76
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:21,125
I am totally gonna sue.

77
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:24,791
Yeah

78
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,166
It's me.

79
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,000
What have you guys found
out...? Any progress?

80
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,208
Progress? We're at
standstill day three.

81
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:33,250
You told us to hold off.

82
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,250
And now'd be a
good time to know why.

83
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,166
What exactly's going on?

84
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,625
Mayuri... dies today.

85
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,708
Yeah. We've
established that...

86
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:44,125
It's the whole reason we
wanna hack into SERN...

87
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:45,750
The first text that
jumped back in time--

88
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:49,166
No...! That's no longer our tac!

89
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm puzzling out a
way to save Mayuri

90
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:53,291
that doesn't involve our having
to reverse anything else.

91
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,958
But why?

92
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:59,250
Because... there have been
unforeseen developments.

93
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,208
Okay. Such as?

94
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,916
Look, I can't explain
at the moment...

95
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,666
There's an alternative;
I'm going find it.

96
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,291
That's all you need to know.

97
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:08,708
Why are you talking like it's--

98
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:09,666
Stop grilling me--!

99
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,458
Stop leaving me in the dark!

100
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:14,166
Listen, I want to help you;

101
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,375
but I can't do that if you play
things so close to the chest.

102
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:22,916
It's happening soon, isn't it?

103
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,666
Damn it, Okabe
give me something!

104
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,708
Man, my feet are super sore.

105
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,291
Worth it, though.

106
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,708
Hey, mind if we pop by
the lab for some snacks?

107
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:42,000
I don't know about you,

108
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,375
but I could eat a house
right about now.

109
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:48,666
You okay...? You look tired.

110
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,375
Uh...

111
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:55,708
It's almost time...
Oh god...

112
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,500
What am I gonna do...?

113
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,500
I'd opt for the two of us
breaking into a run, but...

114
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:03,458
Okarin?

115
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:05,125
Let's go.

116
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:15,583
'Kay. Weird question...

117
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:18,708
Why'd you tag along
with me today?

118
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:21,166
You didn't really look very
much, and, well you know...

119
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,208
That is kinda the whole reason
for coming to these things

120
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:26,750
in the first place; plus you
had me to show you around...

121
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,791
It's not every day
I get to be the one

122
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,833
who knows more about
something than you do.

123
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:35,458
I don't know...

124
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm still glad you
came, though.

125
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,916
This was the first time you and
I have been to Comima together.

126
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,208
I'm totally marking
it on my calendar.

127
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:52,791
Mayuri...

128
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,041
In point of fact...

129
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,208
I'd pinned my hopes on
seeing Rukako blushing

130
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:57,958
in some wildly
inappropriate cosplay.

131
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:59,666
Shame he was a no-show.

132
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,833
No kidding!

133
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:02,083
People would've been
swarming around him.

134
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:03,291
He'd've had his own fan club!

135
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:04,791
Without a doubt.

136
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:07,083
Every blog on the interwebs
would be flooded with pics.

137
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:09,416
Heh. And people would
see that adorable face.

138
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,708
And they'd say to
all their friends:

139
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,416
"make way for the
next big thing!"

140
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,291
And, and, once
he got all famous,

141
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,666
you and me and the gang could
say we knew him back when.

142
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:20,000
There's not a detail about that
scenario doesn't ring true.

143
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,250
You know, I think if you
ever did a cosplay

144
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:23,500
you'd be just as popular.

145
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,000
Perhaps one day.

146
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,166
Are you serious?

147
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,333
Mind you, I'd only
consider it on condition

148
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:29,666
that we cosplay as a team.

149
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,291
Okay!

150
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:31,875
But, of course...

151
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:33,875
Warming Christina to the idea
might prove a bit problematic...

152
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,083
Getting the others on board
would be cinch comparatively,

153
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,833
though; and she'd follow
their lead eventually...

154
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:39,833
That accomplished,
we shall descend upon

155
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,916
an unsuspecting
Comima in full regalia,

156
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,958
the infamous Hououin
Kyouma in all his glory

157
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,875
as the group's
dazzling Axis Mundi!

158
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,916
Yeah, well... We better
start planning our outfits...

159
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,291
Kurisu might be easier to
convince than you think.

160
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:54,791
Tell you what: I'll work on her,
you focus on everybody else.

161
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,583
An excellent--

162
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,958
Oh no...! I just wound you.

163
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:06,041
Don't tell me you're broken...

164
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:09,750
So not fair... I've
taken extra special--

165
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,541
Okarin?!

166
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:14,208
Damn it, no! I'm not
going to watch this again!

167
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,083
What do you
want from me?!

168
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:17,291
Okarin?!

169
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:20,083
Just stay here!

170
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:21,375
I don't...

171
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,750
This is not going
to happen...!

172
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:27,833
I'm going to change it...!
Damn it...!

173
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:30,458
I'll let myself get mowed
down in her place...!

174
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,833
Deal with that,
you bastards...!

175
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:36,708
Things'll have to change...!
There'll be no choice...!

176
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,291
Okarin!

177
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:48,958
Mayuri?!

178
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,708
Mayuri!

179
00:09:55,416 --> 00:10:03,666
I'm so... glad I was... finally
helpful... just this once.

180
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,416
Mayuri...

181
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:13,000
It's not... Every day...
I get... to do that...

182
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:16,458
Okarin...

183
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,708
No... please don't...

184
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:32,833
You can't see any stars
from here... Stay with me.

185
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:39,666
Damn it, stay with me...

186
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:04,000
Right-o. Commencing hackage.

187
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:05,041
Okabe?

188
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:09,500
What's wrong?

189
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:32,708
You gonna be
up here all day?

190
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:38,500
I told you. I want to be alone.

191
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,916
Yeah, I know... And I
totally respected that,

192
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,875
till your little woe-is-me
session took a turn

193
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:48,916
a couple hours back and
started... well... worrying me.

194
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,541
Out with it... Why the change of
heart about deleting the text?

195
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:55,500
You were against the idea
yourself originally, remember?

196
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:58,125
So now you're suddenly afraid
of taking some chances...?

197
00:11:58,208 --> 00:11:59,708
That's what's going on?

198
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:02,625
Perhaps I've newly awakened to
my inner law-abiding citizen.

199
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,208
Like hell you have...

200
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,875
You're way too full of yourself
to be a law-abiding citizen...

201
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:08,458
Evil geniuses mock the fuzz--

202
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:11,583
I'm not an evil genius!!!

203
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:14,875
That's a bunch of childish
crap... "Hououin Kyouma...?"

204
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:16,333
Who gives a damn about him...?

205
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:23,083
He's fiction...! Haven't
you put that together...?

206
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:26,125
Well... Stop the presses,
we have a revelation.

207
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:30,375
Oh god, don't tell me
you've time leapt again?

208
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,166
What happened?

209
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,458
Hey, I've helped you get
this far, haven't I...?

210
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,333
Don't start holding
out on me now...

211
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:44,458
We're a team. A damn good one;
at least to hear you tell it.

212
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,166
We haven't made
a difference.

213
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:51,541
Suzuha... Rukako... Faris...

214
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:54,291
I asked them to sacrifice
what they cherished most,

215
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:55,833
but to what end...?

216
00:12:55,916 --> 00:13:00,500
It's pointless... We haven't
been able to do a damn thing.

217
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,500
What are you saying?

218
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,083
No more...

219
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:05,541
Okabe!

220
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,041
Listen... I'm not an idiot...
I know you were crying...

221
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:22,500
Hashida saw it, too...
Scared the hell out of him.

222
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:26,166
Please... Tell me...

223
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,250
Damn it I'm trying to help!

224
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:38,208
Alright, then...

225
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:40,083
On July twenty-eighth,

226
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:42,541
Mayuri and I went to a lecture
at the Radio Building...

227
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:47,458
We... I... found you dead in
a storage closet. Stabbed...

228
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:50,666
I panicked, and not
knowing what else to do,

229
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,166
sent Daru a text about it
before telling anyone else...

230
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,083
His phone was hooked
up to the microwave and...

231
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:58,750
lo and behold, the
very first D-mail...

232
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:02,208
The very first split from
one world-line to another...

233
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:04,916
From alpha to beta, or
whatever the hell it is...

234
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,083
Point being, if we delete that
text from SERN's database,

235
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:14,541
we bump back to the
world-line prior to all of this.

236
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:19,666
We undo that D-mail...
You'll be...

237
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,208
You'll be murdered.

238
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,875
Don't just let it go off.

239
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:41,708
Answer it.

240
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:45,500
Mayuri?

241
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,041
Yep-yep!

242
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:48,541
What's up?

243
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:51,250
Well, Daru said you were
acting all strange or whatever,

244
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:54,125
so I thought maybe
I should check in...

245
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:57,083
Thank you, sweetheart, but
tell him he worries too much.

246
00:14:57,166 --> 00:15:00,208
But...

247
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:01,375
I'm sorry...

248
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,833
It's just I was so
excited about Comima,

249
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:07,375
but, I should've paid
more attention to you...

250
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,625
The thing with the
ninjas got me remembering

251
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,375
the stories you used to tell
me about, you know, them...

252
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:13,833
Don't they have
like four leaders?

253
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:17,875
I remember Geppu, Sudachi,
Seiyuu and... Jakko?

254
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,666
Genbu, Suzaku,
Seiryuu and Byakko.

255
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,583
Those are the guys...
See though?

256
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:25,000
I do pay attention. I get
mixed up sometimes,

257
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:27,958
but I like the
Organization stuff...!

258
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:35,125
You, uh... I mean, you'd tell me
if I was a third wheel, right?

259
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:36,458
Ah, 'course you would!

260
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,541
Listen, I gotta go,
but if there's anything

261
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:41,500
you wanna talk about,
I'm only a phone call away!

262
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,833
Mayuri, wait...! I wasn't...

263
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:46,666
Go on. I'd have to be
completely tone deaf

264
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,625
to miss that note of
desperation in your voice,

265
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,000
so she must be upset.

266
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,541
So you should go...

267
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,458
Getting yourself all worked
up about what happens

268
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,666
to me isn't going to
solve anything right now...

269
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:01,041
Besides, there's nothing I hate
worse than being brooded over...

270
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,500
Find Mayuri, and do
whatever you need to do...

271
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,791
The longer you sit up here
and mope like some kind of

272
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:09,708
lame gargoyle, the more
pissed off I'm going to get.

273
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:12,916
Well...? Don't make
me repeat myself.

274
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,416
This is Mayushii...!

275
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,208
Actually, it's my phone,
so leave me a message--

276
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,416
Well?

277
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,916
One of the cosplayers
from her group said she

278
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,166
headed out quite a
while ago, actually.

279
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,833
I see.

280
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,083
I'm sorry, Gran...

281
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:00,750
Bet you came to see me
for Obon, didn't you?

282
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,625
I came cause I...
wanna talk about

283
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:07,625
the dreams I've
been having lately...

284
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:09,416
They're so scary...

285
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,625
Something really terrible
always happens to me...

286
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:14,625
I got shot in one of them;

287
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:16,416
I got hit by car
in one of them;

288
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,625
in another one I even got
run over by a train...!

289
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:22,166
And it always feels so real...

290
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:27,750
Like, you'd swear it actually
happened... I hate it...

291
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:31,250
I always try to scream, but I
just can't for some reason...

292
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:34,666
It's awful.

293
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,083
I don't know why
I keep having them.

294
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,375
Thing is...
Near the end, it's like,

295
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,250
Okarin always jumps
in and rescues me

296
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:44,583
from whatever is going on...

297
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,583
But, when I try
to say thank you,

298
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,750
it's like he can't
hear me or something...

299
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:54,500
He just stands there holding
me with this look in his eyes.

300
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:57,041
It makes me feel
really sad for him...

301
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:59,291
You can tell he's
trying not to cry,

302
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,875
but he's having to fight
back his tears so hard

303
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:04,750
you can tell any second
he's just gonna lose it.

304
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,083
I try to say I'm sorry,

305
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:09,416
but there's the whole he
can't hear me thing...

306
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,791
And then... I dunno.

307
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:14,083
That's the part where
I usually wake up, I guess.

308
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:18,666
Sorry, I ought to change the
subject to something nicer, huh?

309
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,375
We've got like a ton of new
members at the lab, now...

310
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:25,833
Kurisu, Moeka,
Ruka, Faris, Suzuha.

311
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:28,166
All super, super nice people.

312
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:31,416
It's okay, gran: you don't have
to memorize all their names.

313
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,291
Kurisu is super smart;

314
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:36,083
she's the only one who can
really speak Okarin's language

315
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,041
when he gets into that
mood of his, you know...?

316
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:39,708
It's fun to watch...

317
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:45,708
I think Mr. Mad Scientist
has finally found his match.

318
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,958
Sometimes... I think about
the way things used to be.

319
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:54,458
It was snowing when I came
to the lab the first time...

320
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,083
It was supposed to
be spring by then,

321
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,416
but I guess Winter
wasn't ready to go.

322
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:02,083
I'd just gotten out
of school for the day;

323
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,583
Okarin wasn't
even there yet.

324
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:05,916
I was cleaning the place up

325
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,750
when he sorta dragged
his feet through the door

326
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,166
the way he does sometimes...

327
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:14,708
I said "Welcome home, Okarin!"
and he just stood there.

328
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:16,916
Then he looked around
and said "good work."...

329
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
After that, I spent two
whole hours there every day,

330
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:23,375
even though we didn't
really talk all that much...

331
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,000
The silence wasn't
bad, though...

332
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:29,833
It was... comfortable
I guess is the best word.

333
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:32,041
It's hard to explain I dunno:

334
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:34,166
it was just a nice way
to pass the time...

335
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:40,000
I felt like the luckiest hostage
in the whole wide world!

336
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,666
Not too quiet for you, is it?

337
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:46,916
Nah! I like that we can just
sit here like this. It's fun.

338
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,458
Yes, well... Don't become
too enamored of the calm...

339
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:50,750
Domestic tranquility is a

340
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:52,250
clinically-proven
breeding ground

341
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,791
for all sorts of Organization-
sponsored hallucinations.

342
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:57,458
Wow. Sounds like
I'd better be careful...!

343
00:19:57,541 --> 00:20:00,250
Unless, you know, they're
nice what-do-you-call-'ems...

344
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:01,458
Hallucinations.

345
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:02,958
Okey-dokey...

346
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:06,291
You think the Organization
people are really all that bad?

347
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,791
I miss it...

348
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,125
We didn't talk a lot back then,

349
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:14,875
but... it was more
than we do now...

350
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:17,166
I used to be able to
tell what was on his mind

351
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,916
by just looking at the
expression on his face...

352
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,750
That doesn't seem to be
how it works anymore...

353
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:27,166
Still, though... I can tell
he's hurting inside...

354
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:31,958
It's obvious... He looks so
tired he's about to fall over...

355
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:38,166
And I know that somehow
it's all my fault...

356
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,750
Whatever I've done, I'm sorry...

357
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:46,208
Ah, dang it...! I'm focusing
on the negative again, aren't I?

358
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:49,041
I don't mean to,
Gran. I really don't.

359
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:56,833
I guess... I guess I just don't
want this chapter to end yet.

360
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,375
Don't worry about that.

361
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,541
Okarin!

362
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,083
How'd you know
where to find me?

363
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:14,708
What kind of nonsense
question is that?

364
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:17,458
Lest we forget,
you're my hostage!

365
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:20,166
I will never allow you to
escape my dastardly clutches...

366
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,958
Do you hear me?

367
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:24,583
You can't keep me forever.

368
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:30,916
Do not doubt my resolve,
oh innocent one,

369
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,125
for I am not so
weak as to falter now.

370
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:36,583
All will be clear soon enough...

371
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:41,666
When the time is right.

372
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,625
Let's go.

373
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,416
Oo, oo! First, though, I need...

374
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,750
Yes, yes... You want to
buy another Oopa, I know.
