1
00:00:13,208 --> 00:00:14,750
You're on Earth...

2
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:20,541
Seventy-million years
ago, give or take.

3
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:23,250
Mayuri?

4
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:25,750
You were brought here
by a time machine,

5
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:28,500
but you probably won't
remember that yet.

6
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:29,958
I don't understand...

7
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:31,750
It's crazy, you know.

8
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:35,000
I've chased after you through
so many mixed-up world lines

9
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:39,541
that I don't even remember how
far back it was I lost count.

10
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:41,708
Please, I...

11
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,666
'Course, the "you"
I followed here is just one of

12
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,416
a whole bunch of
different versions.

13
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,541
You're the original, though.
That much I know.

14
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:51,000
The Mayuri that found you

15
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:53,708
is just one of a
bunch of versions, too.

16
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:57,541
But I sure I'm the
original version of me.

17
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:59,958
I learned that the hard way.

18
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:01,708
The important thing is,

19
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:04,541
I have a feeling we're
both going to die here.

20
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:08,583
The good news is, the stuff
that makes us who we are

21
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:10,541
will pass down to the versions

22
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:13,208
of us seventy-million
years from now.

23
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:16,291
So... It's okay.

24
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,166
Okarin!

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,208
Kurisu's mostly finished
setting everything up

26
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:38,083
and she says you
should come take a look.

27
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:42,750
Even awesome-er, though,
my cosplay is almost done. Huh?

28
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:44,958
Earth to Okarin...

29
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,666
Hey, hold this a
second for me, will you?

30
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,291
Like that, yeah.

31
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,291
Like this?

32
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,583
Yep-yep...
Nice and stretched out.

33
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:35,208
Try to think like
you're a clothesline.

34
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:37,583
Awww. What a pretty ribbon.

35
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:41,416
I know right? Ah!
You should totally try this on!

36
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,291
It's okay, I have other
outfits I can compete in.

37
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:45,541
It is kind of cute...

38
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,083
Got the cosplay bug?

39
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:48,750
Please. Don't even go there...

40
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:51,541
Like I'd ever traipse
around in public wearing...

41
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,958
Finished!

42
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:02,041
Yay...! Mayushii takes
home the gold! I beat you...

43
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,458
This was a race...?
Oh dear...

44
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,125
You cleaned our clock, huh?

45
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:09,791
But we're not far behind.

46
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,583
Matter of fact, we're done...

47
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,708
We've got our leaper, folks.

48
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:19,916
Oh, wow...

49
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,500
Definitely looks like something
an evil genius' bunker

50
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:23,833
would have in the armory, huh?

51
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:26,708
Hmmm... So it works kinda
like the Phone Wave...

52
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,375
Except it comes with a headset?

53
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:30,333
It may not be a
masterpiece of design...

54
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:32,125
But this puppy is
able to transport

55
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,250
a person's memory to
any point in the past...

56
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:37,375
Particularly now that
we've got access to the LHC.

57
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,916
And what does the
LHC have to do with it?

58
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,958
Well... To put it simply,
it's acting as a compressor.

59
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:46,375
See, our machine more or
less reads the neural patterns

60
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:49,625
that comprise one's memory and
converts them into terabytes.

61
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:53,333
Three-point-two-four
terabytes, to be exact.

62
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:54,958
The Phone Wave can only
move thirty-six bytes

63
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:58,125
of data at a time, so terabytes
are totally out of bounds.

64
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:01,208
With the LHC, however, we can
generate a black hole that'll

65
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:05,041
defrag the neural data to a
size the Phone Wave can manage.

66
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,208
Basically, once the
data is compressed

67
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:10,000
we can send it just
like we would a D-mail.

68
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:14,708
So it's like putting your
old quilt into a vacuum bag

69
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:16,458
before shovin' it
into the closet?

70
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,958
Well, not exactly,
but close enough, I guess...

71
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,208
You've got the basic idea.

72
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,041
Anyway, we send it to
your phone in the past

73
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:25,083
like we do with D-mail...
It goes through...

74
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:28,041
then gets unraveled by the
broad spectrum signal...

75
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,500
And the neural
patterns comprising

76
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,500
your present state of
memory are overlaid

77
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:34,833
onto the neural pattern
unique to your past self.

78
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:37,208
We can only send data back in
48 hour increments, though...

79
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,791
Push that window any
further and the copy signal

80
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:42,208
will find nothing to match up
with in your past brain...

81
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:43,791
The developmental gap between

82
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:46,083
the two versions of
yourself will be too great.

83
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,333
And then there's the
other glaring issue...

84
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:49,208
What?

85
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:50,708
Unlike our D-mail experiments,

86
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:53,166
this isn't something we can
run without a test subject.

87
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,875
Specifically a human being.

88
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,458
Believe me, I really wish
that weren't the case,

89
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:01,750
but it's the only surefire way
to verify memory transference.

90
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,291
Proxies just aren't enough.

91
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,625
Wait, so you're saying
one of us has to volunteer

92
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:08,791
to be the first chimpanzee
in space...? Yeah, not it.

93
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:12,666
Okabe...? Give me your
opinion on all of this.

94
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,458
I want to know what you
think about it, not Hououin.

95
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:19,708
Daru.

96
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:20,958
Yo-yo.

97
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:23,083
Am I to understand that
you've yet to puzzle out

98
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,583
how we're connected to SERN?

99
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:27,125
Uh-huh. But we can
be reasonably sure

100
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:28,708
they haven't
sniffed out our trail.

101
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,833
I'm inclined to agree
with Daru's assessment...

102
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,250
If they were wise to us,

103
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,791
we'd have seen some
indication of it by now.

104
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,041
If we've really found
a way to conquer time...

105
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:44,958
I have to know.

106
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:49,333
Um... Maybe we can send a
gel-nana back to the past

107
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,750
to see if it changes into how
it was when I bought it...?

108
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,916
Sweetie, think about
what you're asking, okay...?

109
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,083
Bananas don't have memories.

110
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,208
And ours aren't worth risking.

111
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:03,416
I think it fair to say we're
out of our depth here...

112
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,708
I vote we, go public
with our findings

113
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,291
and let someone else
sort out the ethics.

114
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,500
Um... I second that.

115
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,791
If that's what everyone wants,
that's what we'll go with.

116
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:14,750
That's what I want!
I second it, too!

117
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,333
Do we know what kind of
pizza Hashida's ordered?

118
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:25,583
No idea.

119
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:26,958
Well, it's not a big deal.

120
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:29,833
Salad pretty much goes
with whatever. Let's see...

121
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:30,708
Hold on.

122
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:31,500
Now what?

123
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,958
You are making a salad...?

124
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:35,583
That's right... Grapefruit
salad, to be precise.

125
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,083
Then why in the name
of all that's holy

126
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:38,375
am I looking at ground beef?

127
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,625
C'mon, you don't like
to mix it up a little?

128
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:42,916
Grapefruit's like the
equivalent of black anyway:

129
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,916
it goes with everything.

130
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,708
Excuse me...
Have you eaten one?

131
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:48,000
Oh and since when did you
become such a connoisseur?

132
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,875
Look, they have these things
called "prepared" salads

133
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,833
designed to save a busy woman
like you the trouble of--

134
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:55,250
No thanks, those are
basically boxes of foliage...

135
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,416
You've seriously got to
loosen up and learn how

136
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,875
to make your own fun
sometime. I swear...

137
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:02,083
Ah! Cilantro! Perfection!

138
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:04,000
It's me... It appears
the sleeper agent

139
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,375
is going in for a checkmate...

140
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:10,208
Backup requested to keep
her out of the kitchen--

141
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:12,250
I can't believe
you're joking around.

142
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:13,500
I gotta say,

143
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:16,416
I didn't think you'd be
taking this all so well.

144
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,625
I'm kinda surprised.

145
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,208
I thought you'd be
climbing the walls

146
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:22,291
to leap through time once
we figured out the mechanics.

147
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:23,458
That bother you?

148
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,666
It is what it is.

149
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:35,666
Ever read any Martin
Heidegger... or, try to?

150
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:40,375
He thought that
humans were... temporal.

151
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:43,791
Just so you know,

152
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,791
I'm glad we're turning this
thing over to someone else...

153
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:50,458
Really... I mean, I think all
of us are, but me in particular.

154
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:53,000
Is it okay if we invite
Ruka and Faris to the party,

155
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,708
'cause we kinda already did...

156
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,666
When did this become a party?

157
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:00,875
This sounds weird...

158
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:01,958
But I get the impression

159
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,833
Mayuri's more
relieved than all of us.

160
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,500
Maybe you're right...

161
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:07,791
I think out of the group,

162
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,666
she had the keenest
focus on the big picture.

163
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,875
We couldn't see the
forest for the trees.

164
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:17,125
When do we go public?

165
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,458
The sooner the better,
as far as I'm concerned.

166
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:22,250
Just give me a heads up;
I want to let my mom know.

167
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,125
Oh, hell...

168
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,916
Dad's going to find out
I made a time machine...

169
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,250
I don't even want to imagine

170
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,000
the kind of temper
tantrum he's gonna pitch...

171
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,125
It'll probably be a big enough
deal that we'll have to put

172
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:37,041
Aomori on the back-burner,
for a while at least.

173
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,041
I wouldn't worry too much.

174
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,708
As a lab member you
are entitled to

175
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:43,875
my protection in times
of impending crisis.

176
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:47,666
Oh, sure I am...

177
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,583
Provided I submit to
your evil will, right?

178
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,458
Provided that you
keep in contact.

179
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:56,583
Uh... Well, I... I mean, sure...

180
00:09:56,666 --> 00:10:00,166
Oh...! I... Uh...

181
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:07,625
Uh... Wait, hold on you...

182
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,875
Owww...! What are you doing?!

183
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:13,000
You're so out of character
all of a sudden I'm forced

184
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:15,083
to conclude you've been stricken
with some kind of fever!

185
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:16,416
What...?

186
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,791
Look, I... it's not like
I was serious or anything;

187
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:19,958
I was just trying to avoid

188
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,958
an awkward situation
by being courteous.

189
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,666
Liar, liar. Pants on fire.

190
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,791
What is your problem?!

191
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,458
How the hell do you
expect a girl to act

192
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:28,916
when you keep
flying off the handle?

193
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,916
And then you babble about

194
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,083
"keeping in touch"
like you care...

195
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,791
Stop throwing me curve balls!

196
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,583
I'm sorry, which
one of us is supposed

197
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:35,958
to be flying off the handle...?

198
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:38,208
Don't make this more
complicated than it is already:

199
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,166
you're my assistant.

200
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,083
Yeah, well there aren't
any words for what you are.

201
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,416
Really? 'Cause you just
hurled a slew of them at me!

202
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,583
You know what: I thought
of one. "Impossible."

203
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,833
Hey. Soup's on.

204
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:54,125
Thanks for waiting on us...

205
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,208
You have the
manners of a baboon.

206
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:58,333
What? It was gettin' cold.

207
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:01,250
Thanks for the variety,
too, I might add.

208
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:02,916
There's like a plethora
of good stuff here, dude.

209
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,958
Moron...!

210
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,041
All these are
smothered in olives,

211
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,583
which you damn-well
know I hate!

212
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,708
This is exactly why I'm
making a salad fit for royalty.

213
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:11,458
Give me a sec to toss
all the bits together

214
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:12,250
and we'll have proper noms.

215
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:13,500
You let her buy produce?!

216
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,958
I tried to stop her but
she wouldn't see reason!

217
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,375
Damn it...!

218
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:19,000
Are you or are you not
pledged to protect our lives?!

219
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,708
Don't lose heart,
my harried friend;

220
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:22,041
we're not done-for just yet...

221
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,541
Bear in mind,

222
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:25,500
that apple pie fiasco may
well have been an accident...

223
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:26,875
The rare miss of a gourmand...

224
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,541
Damn it, I forgot
to buy radishes.

225
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:29,958
Oh well, shallots'll do.

226
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:31,833
Okay... If I survive this meal,

227
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:33,333
I'm going to write a
letter of apology

228
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:34,208
to everyone I've ever wronged.

229
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:35,125
I'm back!

230
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:36,541
We're saved...!

231
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,375
Mayuri, darling, could you
scuttle into the kitchen--

232
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,583
Hey! Wassup, party people...?

233
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:43,000
Wowza, something in here
smells almost edible...

234
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,208
Did you guys
order some pizza...?

235
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:47,000
'Cause I got
chicken tenders, too.

236
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,166
I thought you knew better
than to have her around.

237
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,208
I happen to be a
member of this lab...

238
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:58,916
Mind telling us all
what you're doing here?

239
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,791
I'm a lab member, too.

240
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:01,791
What's happening?

241
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,291
Not a clue.

242
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,916
Did something happen between
the two of you or what?

243
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,333
No... She just gets off leveling
bizarre accusations at me.

244
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:11,291
Like when she tells people
I'm a mole for SERN...

245
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,666
Well, hey, if the
shoe fits... Wear it.

246
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,708
What gives you the right
to say crap like that...?

247
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:16,958
You don't even know me!

248
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:19,291
Keep talkin'... I know
how this goes down.

249
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:20,291
Huh?

250
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:21,416
Trust me, lady...

251
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,916
The things you're gonna do...

252
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,833
Let's just say I'm more of
an expert on what's behind

253
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:29,583
that whole innocent girl
act than you are.

254
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:30,625
Wait, what?

255
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,125
I'm sorry,

256
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:34,333
could you maybe run that by
me again without the crazy?

257
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:38,166
Uh-oh... Um, are you
guys gonna fight?

258
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,000
Clear a path, please,
oh sensitive one...

259
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,166
It appears the only remedy
for this awkward turn

260
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,375
of events is the intercession
of yours truly... Zombie!

261
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,833
I did not raise an
insolent back-biter!

262
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:52,541
You didn't raise
me at all, freak.

263
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:55,083
If you intend to don the
appellation "mad scientist"

264
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:56,125
you must first subdue your--

265
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,500
I have no intention
of donning it.

266
00:12:58,583 --> 00:12:59,916
Part-timer!

267
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,041
You can point your finger
at me all you want, Okabe.

268
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:04,458
If you ignore my warning,
whatever happens is on you.

269
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:06,708
I... don't deny
that you warned me...

270
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:08,333
Hey! Slow down a sec!

271
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:10,416
Don't tell me you
actually believed her?!

272
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,458
No, it's a bit more
complicated than that...

273
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:13,916
You sure didn't
put up an argument.

274
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,166
Well... Perhaps I...

275
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,916
Perhaps you shoulda
just let 'em cat fight.

276
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,958
If you'd like to jump in
and help me contain this,

277
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:20,083
you are more than welcome!

278
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,000
Umm...

279
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,333
Please stop fighting...

280
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:27,000
I really hate it
when people fight.

281
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:28,416
Sweetie...

282
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,333
Uh... For the record,
I'm not a big fan of it myself.

283
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:33,041
I don't mean to be all weird...

284
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:37,416
I just want you to like each
other as much as I like you.

285
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,833
Weigh your options carefully.

286
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:57,000
Is it a virus or a link...?
Only one way to know.

287
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:59,333
But of course, therein
lies your dilemma:

288
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:02,416
the cost of knowing may
be forfeiture of dessert!

289
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:05,833
Like I always say:

290
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:08,458
when in doubt come at the
enemy with all you've got!

291
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:14,625
Like a rat in a trap...!

292
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:17,416
Three viruses and
no help in sight...

293
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,291
Not one to be
ungracious in triumph,

294
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:22,291
however, admit defeat now
and I'll concede the cherry.

295
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:23,958
Poor gal's got no game face.

296
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:26,500
You're being mean
to her, Okarin.

297
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,375
Law of the jungle, my dear.

298
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:31,875
Hate not the player;
hate the game.

299
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,333
In case you were wondering,

300
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:36,208
the cards nesting up there
in the corner are all links.

301
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:37,708
He's not half as shrewd a player

302
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:43,083
as he'd like everyone to
believe, take my word for it.

303
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:43,958
Ah-ha!

304
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:45,125
Whoa. Good call.

305
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:46,625
Damn you...!

306
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:48,708
Underlings are not supposed
to rat-out their superiors!

307
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:50,166
Oh, nice move, chief...

308
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,833
Calling someone "underling"
totally inspires loyalty.

309
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:55,666
Yeah, well...
I'm not thanking you.

310
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,416
Oh, here.
Let me give you a hand.

311
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,750
Aww... Thanks,
sweetie--actually,

312
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:03,125
if you wouldn't mind
making tea, that'd be great.

313
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,041
You're a doll.

314
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:06,791
You know I really
can't thank you enough.

315
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:07,916
What for?

316
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,208
Trying as hard as you are

317
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:11,791
to get along with
Suzuha for my sake, silly.

318
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:14,416
Ah... Well, sad
to say I don't think

319
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,958
it's done a whole lot of good...

320
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:19,166
But what you said earlier about
us all liking each other...

321
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,208
We spend so much time
in this room together

322
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:23,916
it'd be a waste if
we couldn't get along.

323
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,375
Okabe and I had a
little chat about you.

324
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:29,166
About how while we're
all fumbling in the dark,

325
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:33,000
you always seem to
see what's important.

326
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,083
You know, Okabe never
seems more himself

327
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,333
than when the topic of
conversation is you...

328
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:39,250
It's kinda creepy to
tell you the truth.

329
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,708
Aww, that's not a very
nice thing to say you know.

330
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:43,791
Sorry! It's the truth.

331
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:46,500
I call shenanigans...!

332
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:47,500
You accepted outside help...!

333
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:48,666
Your victory was
a deus ex machina!

334
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,166
Ergo that cake is a lie!

335
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,625
I was gonna give you
the cherry, but nah...

336
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:55,791
I will marshal my forces
for round two, rest assured.

337
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,750
Savor that cherry,
callow upstart;

338
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,541
it may well be your last!

339
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,291
Why don't you handle this one?

340
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,333
I can manage the tea.

341
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:18,791
Okarin...

342
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,291
What on earth are you doing?

343
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:22,916
Heh! It's dark.
I couldn't find a flashlight.

344
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,208
Just be careful;

345
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:26,458
that's Future Gadget
Numero Six you're holding

346
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:28,583
and it has... nostalgic value.

347
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:31,750
Huh... Plus it's nice and shiny!

348
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,083
You having fun?

349
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,333
Oh yeah, you bet I am...

350
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:43,750
The pizza was super tasty.

351
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,541
Suzuha and Kurisu
are getting along...

352
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,541
Hmph. Peachy.

353
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:54,750
We have a whole bunch of new
lab members now, you know...

354
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,833
I've been thinking lately
about some of the things

355
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,333
we could really use around here.

356
00:16:58,416 --> 00:16:59,833
Is that a fact?

357
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:01,916
Oh yeah... We need, uh...

358
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,625
Well, new dishes. More chairs...

359
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,833
Have patience, my dove...
Give it a little time.

360
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:08,833
Once we've gone public
with our discoveries

361
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,958
somebody's bound to
pay us handsomely...

362
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,958
Then I'll set you loose
in a department store.

363
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,375
Wait, so... You'll let
me get more chairs?

364
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:16,750
And new dishes, of course...

365
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:18,583
Which will just
be the beginning...

366
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:19,750
Think even bigger.

367
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,375
Can we get a new microwave...?!

368
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:24,625
I majorly miss not being able
to heat up my chicken tenders...

369
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,708
Mayhap I'll take
it under advisement.

370
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:33,375
It's funny how much
things have changed.

371
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:34,875
I mean, just a few months ago

372
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,916
you were always
so sad, you know?

373
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:42,083
The lab was quiet and lonely.

374
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:44,916
It was pretty much just
you and your computer.

375
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:49,833
Then Daru came along...
And Makise, too...

376
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:51,541
Ruka came on board...

377
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:56,625
Then Suzuha...
Moeka... And Faris...

378
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,583
Even Mr. Braun and
Nae are like family now.

379
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:02,791
I suppose so.

380
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,000
The place is
getting so crowded...

381
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:09,125
It's kinda goofy for me
to still be your hostage.

382
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:18,000
Hey, guys!

383
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,041
Come back in...!

384
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:22,166
Somethin's going
on with the trains.

385
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,666
Developments on the metro:

386
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,791
a terrorist bomb threat
called in to local authorities

387
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:28,791
just moments ago has
shut down every line. Repeat:

388
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,500
Every line, traveling
to or away fr--

389
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:34,625
This terrorist crap is so...
Ugh... I mean, come on.

390
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,833
Jeez, I better check in at home.

391
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:37,875
Hey, uh...

392
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:39,500
This soiree was
supposed to be about

393
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:41,375
celebrating your time
machine, wasn't it?

394
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:42,625
Yeah, sort of...

395
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:43,958
Kinda funny you would
ask 'bout that now...

396
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,250
How deep have you
hacked into SERN?

397
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,625
Well we're pretty
much done digging.

398
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,833
Hit the mother
lode a while back.

399
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,041
What are you talking about?!

400
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:53,833
I'm talkin' about being
directly connected.

401
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,458
Oh god... There's no...!

402
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:10,291
I... I've gotta get home.

403
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:12,333
Huh? Suzu...?

404
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:15,916
Alrighty, then...
That was subtle.

405
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,708
You got money
for a cab, Mayuri?

406
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,541
Uhm.. Not really, no.

407
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,083
Oh no. I just wound you!

408
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:50,541
Don't tell me you're
broken... So not fair...

409
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:54,291
I've taken extra good
care of you and everything.

410
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:09,000
Oh god...
Please don't...

411
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,875
What... the hell...?

412
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:16,666
Don't move. Let's see
those hands in the air.

413
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,833
What are you doing?

414
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:48,541
Wait, you... You?!

415
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:51,666
Your time machine is
now the property of SERN.

416
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,125
Hold on...!
You can't just storm--

417
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:58,250
Makise Kurisu...
Okabe Rintarou...

418
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:02,750
Hashida Itaru...
You'll be coming with us.

419
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:06,291
And Mayuri?

420
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:09,458
I'm sorry.

421
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,500
The little one isn't needed.

422
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,125
Please, no...

423
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:22,583
I'm begging you.

424
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:27,125
For FB... For... For...

425
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:52,750
Oh, god... Mayuri!

426
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:58,208
Please, no...

427
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:09,000
What is this?

428
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,500
What the hell is this?!
