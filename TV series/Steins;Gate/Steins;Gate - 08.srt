1
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:26,625
Me... humanity's savior...?

2
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:30,083
Nonsense...! I have chosen the
path of the mad scientist...!

3
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:32,750
I vie for chaos
and destruction!

4
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,416
Dude, you're freaking me out...

5
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:48,750
We shall be recommencing
Operation Wyrd

6
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:50,291
without further delay.

7
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:53,083
'Kay, but you know Mr. Braun's
gonna lose his shit, right?

8
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:54,333
Then let him!

9
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:57,708
Wait! I told you before...
this is too risky.

10
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:58,875
"Too risky"?

11
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:01,541
This afternoon you
couldn't wait to begin.

12
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:04,125
When did you say?

13
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:06,458
You already sent it, didn't you?

14
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:09,208
Yes... The experiment
has indeed taken place...

15
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:10,875
I've no doubt that
the events of the past

16
00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:13,000
have been altered
in certain details.

17
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:14,500
No kiddin'?

18
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:16,916
You mean we really made the
jump to another world-line?

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,458
Near as I can tell.

20
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:20,333
This would also explain why
your memories of earlier today

21
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:22,041
differ so significantly
from mine.

22
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:24,333
Oh yeah. You mean that
whole lottery-number-thing

23
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:25,625
you were talking
about before?

24
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:27,583
That's the one.

25
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:29,500
So... Then why are
you the only one

26
00:01:29,583 --> 00:01:32,375
who remembers us
sending that D-mail?

27
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:34,541
According to Titor...

28
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:36,333
I might have an
unprecedented skill...

29
00:01:36,416 --> 00:01:38,958
The only way I'll know is
for us to change the past

30
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:42,375
enough to shift
the world-line again.

31
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:43,625
What's the skill?

32
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:45,166
When a world-line splits off,

33
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,458
and memories
which are inconsistent

34
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:49,208
with the new reality get
erased... mine are not.

35
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:51,208
I call it "Reading Steiner."

36
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:47,833
Check it!

37
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:50,375
Well, nothing in the
sent messages folder...

38
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:53,750
But it does look like a D-mail
hit the inbox five days ago!

39
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:54,875
So it worked.

40
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,666
Whaddya think? Did I win?!

41
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,750
If you had won,
you wouldn't be asking me.

42
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:07,541
We sent a D-mail five
days into the past,

43
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,125
telling Daru the
position of the cards

44
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:12,166
in his match with Faris.
So he should've won.

45
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,375
Hey, Mayuri...

46
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:17,375
This might sound like
kind of a dumb question,

47
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:20,041
but when I went up against
Faris the other day, did I...

48
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:24,333
Sorry, what was that...? Kicked
my butt...? Yeah... 'Course...

49
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,500
Sure, thanks... You, too.

50
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,041
Daru got the message all right,

51
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:35,541
but it didn't seem
to change the past.

52
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:36,916
It should've,
though, shouldn't it?

53
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,750
He knew where the cards were.

54
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,375
I guess the
world-line doesn't jump

55
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,708
for every little incidental
thing that runs interference.

56
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:45,500
I feel like we need to find a
more objective way of analyzing

57
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:49,375
whether or not we've gone
through that kind of shift.

58
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:50,083
Really?

59
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,416
Wait a sec!

60
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,750
That doesn't mean I agree
with what you're doing!

61
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:55,458
I'm just saying...! Hey...

62
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:57,958
Why do you think you've been
able to retain your memories

63
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,375
after a jump, while all of
ours are getting overwritten?

64
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:04,000
You already know the
answer--it's my Reading Steiner!

65
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,250
If you're genuinely
curious as to how it works,

66
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:13,500
perhaps you should be the
one to send out our next D-mail.

67
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,416
I don't want to.

68
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,000
Still worried about
a time paradox?

69
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:22,583
Changing the past, just...
just feels... unfair.

70
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:26,875
For better or for worse,
the eighteen years

71
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:29,583
I've lived up until now
have made me who I am today.

72
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:31,041
There may have been bad times,

73
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,083
but they've been mine--just
as much as the good times.

74
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:37,458
In other words...
You're a scientist... A mad one!

75
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:39,166
What?! Where did
you get that?!

76
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,375
You've no qualms about
sitting back and letting others

77
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:44,083
hurl themselves headlong into
the unknown, obviously...

78
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:47,208
That is rather the attitude
that sets mad scientists apart.

79
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:48,875
Whatever!

80
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:50,791
That said, in all seriousness--

81
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:59,250
Anyway... if we want to
perfect the D-mail system,

82
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:00,458
we're going to have to--

83
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:07,666
We're going to have to
conduct more experim--

84
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,375
Moeka?

85
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,250
Shut up!

86
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,500
Can I?

87
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,041
You are a tenacious one,
Shining Finger...

88
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:32,000
Home again,
home again--jiggity jig! Haha!

89
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:33,625
Those crepes hit the spot, yeah?

90
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:34,875
Yeah.

91
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,083
Do you ever
actually go to class?

92
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:40,625
I'm awaiting my compatriot.

93
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:43,625
Hey! What'd I tell you
about spookin' my kid?

94
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,375
I didn't do the least
little thing to her!

95
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:46,708
Come on, Nae...

96
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,500
Let's go inside before
this loser freaks you out

97
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:51,666
any more than he already has.

98
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,750
Good morning!

99
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,750
Yay! It's Mayuri!

100
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,083
Too-too-roo!

101
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,458
Brought you something!

102
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,625
Wow, my favorite!

103
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,666
And Okarin gets one, too!

104
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,750
Whaaaaaaasup!

105
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,500
Oh, good morning, Suzuha!

106
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,291
Good morning, part-time girl!

107
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:22,416
Well? Spill it! How'd it
go with Mr. You-know-who?

108
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,416
What do you mean?

109
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,708
Time-travel, goofball...!

110
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,833
D'y'ever get a hold
of Titor or what?

111
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:29,000
Uhh, he and I did
end up corresponding,

112
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:31,208
in fact, but I'm not exactly
sure if I believe him anymore.

113
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:33,291
What the in hell...?!

114
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,708
Why would you doubt him?!

115
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:38,083
Um... Explain to me why
you're so worked up about it?

116
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,416
I think somebody just outed
herself as a Titor fangirl.

117
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,500
Yeah, as if!

118
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:45,125
Too-too-roo!
It's Kurisu everyone!

119
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:46,666
Good morning, you guys.

120
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,333
So, she gave ya the ol'
stink-eye yet again, huh?

121
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:03,416
What's her problem, anyway?

122
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,666
People fighting
really gets me down.

123
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,958
Uh... Hey, I'm sure it's
just a misunderstanding.

124
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:10,791
Thank you.

125
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:12,666
Nothing too complicated,
Shining Finger.

126
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,250
Make it simple enough
that we'll know whether

127
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,708
or not the past
has been changed.

128
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,458
"I got this cell
phone four days ago,

129
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:24,833
but I don't like it...

130
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:28,416
So I want to tell the
past me not to purchase it."

131
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,875
I get it...

132
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:31,791
If you see Moeka and she's
got a different cell phone,

133
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:32,958
you'll that know it worked...

134
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:34,708
You did tell her
to stay "simple."

135
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:37,583
Indeed...! Take your
places, everyone!

136
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,125
Ready!

137
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:51,500
All right! Initialize the
Phone Wave (Real Name--!

138
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,833
Wow, it's perfect...!

139
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,166
Why the melon?

140
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,625
I just... wanted to
apologize to you for getting

141
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:03,208
the numbers all mixed up when
I bought that ticket for you...

142
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:04,958
Do you think you can forgive me?

143
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:09,083
Oh... Yeah... Course
I can... No problem.

144
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,000
And... my callow apprentice...

145
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:14,041
owning up to this slight misstep
has bolstered your powers.

146
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,666
Heh. Well thanks,
I'll get out of your hair now.

147
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,166
Oh, are you leaving already?

148
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:22,333
I figured you were in the
middle of something, so...

149
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:25,083
Anyway, good luck with it!

150
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:27,500
You wanna come back sometime
and try on my cosplay?

151
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,083
I don't know about that...

152
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,333
I'm not really into that
sort of thing, you know?

153
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:32,375
Aw, I understand.

154
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:33,333
That's too bad, though.

155
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:35,666
You'd look super-cute in them...

156
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,000
I'll see you later!

157
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,333
'Kay...! Later, Ruka!

158
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:43,291
Kid's a gem.

159
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:12,583
I don't have to ask
this time... I felt it...

160
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:16,583
How...? How'd it change...?

161
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:25,041
All this kinda blows my
mind sometimes, ya know?...

162
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,666
Something's different,
but...? Wait...!

163
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,166
Where's Shining Finger?!
She was just here!

164
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,916
What are you on about?

165
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,041
Just ignore him.
That's what I do.

166
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:47,250
Did Ruka...
happen to stop by...?

167
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:50,458
My Ruka...? Nope.
Why do you ask?

168
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:53,375
What about Moeka, then?!
Has she been here today?

169
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:56,916
I don't think so...
Do I know her?

170
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Kiryuu Moeka! The one
I call Shining Finger.

171
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,500
Okarin... I don't
know who you mean!

172
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,208
Who is this chick?

173
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,041
It's not just Mayuri, Okabe...

174
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,291
I've never heard of her, either.

175
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:11,708
Oh God...!

176
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:14,583
We sent another
D-mail, didn't we!

177
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:17,041
We did...? What's
different this time?

178
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:19,041
Did we alter the
past so thoroughly

179
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,375
that Moeka's very
existence was negated......?!

180
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:23,708
Impossible...!

181
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,625
I still have her
earlier messages,

182
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:30,958
so at least she was alive as
of then, but what about now...?

183
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:41,916
She messaged me right back.

184
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,416
That's very much in character...

185
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,416
So she's still here...

186
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:51,375
Let me get this straight...

187
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:54,791
The girl that you were asking
about... Shining Finger...

188
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:58,583
She sent herself a D-mail...
and changed the past in that...

189
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:01,625
she never made her
initial visit to the lab?

190
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,958
In so many words, yes.

191
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,875
So... your ability

192
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,416
to remember conflicting
memories after a jump...

193
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,000
Your "Reading Steiner,"
I think you called it?

194
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,250
That name is ridiculous,
by the way, I mean...

195
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,625
Come on--it's
just word-salad.

196
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:19,000
Thank you so much for
that unsolicited opinion

197
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:21,333
from the peanut gallery.

198
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:22,958
I have to ask you something,

199
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:25,291
and I'm hoping you don't
take it the wrong way.

200
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:27,583
You're not, like,
pulling our leg, are you?

201
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,208
Okay, I'm ready!

202
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,916
We can talk about this later.

203
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,458
See you tomorrow!

204
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,250
I know what I remember.

205
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:47,666
But...Could I be...?

206
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,541
Seriously, how do the boys sleep
in there? Buncha savages...

207
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:58,375
I guess that's what hackers
and mad scientists do!

208
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,125
Hey, know what?!
We should get together

209
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:02,375
some night and have
ourselves a big sleepover!

210
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:04,166
No guys, and you
got yourself a deal...

211
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,125
Better yet... why don't we
have one in my hotel room.

212
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:08,458
We can do that?!

213
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:09,500
Why not?

214
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:13,000
Oh, I can't wait--it's
gonna be so fun!

215
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,416
Hey, Ruka! Too-too-roo!

216
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,875
Whoa, really?

217
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:27,458
Blasphemy!

218
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,916
You made the pilgrimage here
without your sacred blade?!

219
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,791
I... I thought that...

220
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:32,791
You stop being a grumpy-butt!

221
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,250
Ruka's my extra-special guest,

222
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:36,000
so I want everyone
here to behave!

223
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:39,458
You are still okay with me
dressing you up... right?!

224
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:40,458
Uh, sure... I guess...?!

225
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:42,250
Of course you are,
my darling Ruka!

226
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,625
It's too late to
turn back now...!

227
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,583
Y'know, maybe this isn't...!

228
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,708
Now... let's get you out
of those clothes, yeah?

229
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,791
You're gonna be so pretty!

230
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,500
Oh, oh! Watch the hands!
Watch the hands!

231
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:55,750
I'll put it on, I swear!
Just let me dress myself, okay?

232
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,416
I can't do this
if you're looking!

233
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,458
You'll need help!

234
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,166
No, wait! Please
don't take that off!

235
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,416
I'm begging you...!

236
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,125
It's like yuri
times infinity...

237
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:08,291
That stammering blossom
is Mars, not Venus.

238
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,333
Yeah, but ya know...?

239
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,375
That's even hotter!

240
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:14,083
Ta-da!

241
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:21,625
He's Kirari from
the game Rai-Net!

242
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:26,791
It fits perfectly!
You look adorable!

243
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:29,166
I've never been so
embarrassed before...

244
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,583
Don't be embarrassed...!

245
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,958
You're the prettiest boy
these goofballs have ever seen!

246
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:35,750
Balls or not, man...
I would so hit that...!

247
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,375
What do you think, Okarin?

248
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,166
Let's see here...

249
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:43,083
Code Red...!

250
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,458
The Organization's attacking me

251
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:47,000
with mind-blowingly
adorable cosplay!

252
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:50,125
Curves and colors eating
through my corpus callosum!

253
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:53,000
Uh... are you going to
be all right, Kyouma...?

254
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,458
Oh give it a rest,
you big drama queen.

255
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:58,500
Hey, Kurisu's here!
Too-too-roo!

256
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:07,791
Behold the pervert, undressing
the poor dear with her eyes...

257
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:08,958
No I'm not!

258
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,208
This moment gets
better and better...!

259
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:12,583
Well, what do you think...?

260
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,083
Looks pretty cute, huh!

261
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,916
Yeah...! I could never pull
off an outfit like that!

262
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,416
Well... Um, I usually
wear more clothing...

263
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,875
Okay, are you ready for
the next cosplay outfit?

264
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:23,833
Mayuri...!
I have a confession...!

265
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:26,166
I didn't actually come
here to play dress up...

266
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,708
I stopped by to ask

267
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:30,166
the members of the Future Gadget
Lab for a really big favor!

268
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,125
Wait, so you're not really
here to play dress up with me?

269
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:34,708
I tried to tell
you on the phone,

270
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:37,625
but you sounded so excited, I
couldn't bear to disappoint you.

271
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:40,125
I guess I did kinda
get carried away...

272
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,208
So, what pray
tell is this favor?

273
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:45,791
Okay... Don't be mad.

274
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,125
There's someone in the past

275
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,291
I've gotta send a really
important text message to!

276
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:50,125
Huh?!

277
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:51,291
Sorry...

278
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:56,000
Remember how I brought you
that watermelon yesterday,

279
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:59,208
to make up for the ticket...?

280
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,250
We sent another
D-mail, didn't we!

281
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,791
Hold up... What's
different this time?

282
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,833
Did we alter the
past so thoroughly

283
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:08,375
that Moeka's very
existence was negated...?!

284
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,458
Impossible...!

285
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,083
I didn't mean to eavesdrop!

286
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:17,250
I was about to knock right
when you said that stuff...!

287
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,791
It's okay...

288
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:21,375
Why don't you just tell us what
message you wanna send back.

289
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:24,916
Okay... I, uh...

290
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,750
I think I was
meant to be a girl!

291
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,208
Huh?!

292
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:31,541
For as far back
as I can remember,

293
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:34,000
I've always felt awkward
about the way I look...

294
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,708
I don't think it'd be a problem
if the parts of me you see...

295
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:41,333
y'know... matched
the parts you can't.

296
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:44,041
Wait... What...?
Time out for a sec...

297
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:47,958
Why is the cute girl talking
about not liking how she looks?

298
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,666
Hmph. Alas, my poor
assistant--allow me

299
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,750
to shatter that candy-coated
bubble of naiveté around you.

300
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,166
Naiveté?

301
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,041
Our dear Rukako isn't a
female... Quite the opposite.

302
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:00,291
How dumb d'you
think I am? Come on.

303
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:01,833
Oh, it's the truth...

304
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:03,875
I believe any scientist worth
her salt would be conducting

305
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:06,041
some field research
right about now.

306
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:12,750
Someone this cute
can't possibly be a boy...

307
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:16,375
Sorry... I'll just--

308
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,708
How ya doin' there?

309
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:26,666
Look, this isn't a joke!

310
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,875
I'm totally serious
about wanting to be a girl!

311
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:31,625
Please let me do it!

312
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:32,791
Here's the thing...

313
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,791
I fail to see how
sending a text message

314
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:37,541
into the past can change
a Y chromosome into an X.

315
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,125
I've already got
an idea, though,

316
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:41,583
I heard that if you eat a lot
of meat when you're pregnant,

317
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:43,083
you end up having
a baby boy...

318
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:46,208
And if you eat lots of veggies,
you have a girl instead.

319
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:48,666
Maybe if she knew that...

320
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,416
So... you want to
message your mom

321
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,791
and have her
double-down on the salad?

322
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,750
Yeah...If you'll let me.

323
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:57,833
So be it... Your request
shall be summarily granted.

324
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,958
Oh Kyouma, thank you so much!

325
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:02,250
This is so exciting!
I hope it works!

326
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:02,958
Me too!

327
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,291
As hot as it would be,

328
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,208
I don't know if changing
someone's gender is smart.

329
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,333
Some old wives' tale
about food isn't going

330
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:10,458
to change whatever
gender he happens to be.

331
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:11,708
He's right, Daru.

332
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,833
There's absolutely no
evidence to support it.

333
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:15,833
If sending a D-mail
makes him feel better,

334
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:18,250
what's the harm in
letting him try it?

335
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,958
All right... Forswear your
life among the mundanes

336
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:24,125
and consent to become our
newest lab member--Double-O Six!

337
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:25,166
Yes!

338
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,916
Now... let us
begin without delay!

339
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,541
You're seventeen years old
this year, if I'm not mistaken?

340
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,041
Oh... Uh-huh!

341
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,333
As I thought...

342
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,791
That means you came
into the world in 1993...

343
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,625
Why's it matter
when Ruka was born?

344
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:39,583
And someone remind
me, what year it was

345
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:42,166
when cell phones started
to be popular in Japan?

346
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,833
Looks like it was '96,

347
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,958
and we're talking
bare-bones telephony.

348
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:50,541
Messaging wasn't 'til later.

349
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,166
So what we're saying
is that we shouldn't

350
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,500
just assume anything.

351
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:55,125
Rukako's mother might
not have had a cell phone

352
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:57,416
in the early '90s when
she was pregnant with him.

353
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,916
Wait, you mean he won't
be able to send a D-mail?

354
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,375
Oh no...

355
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,916
We could tweak the
Phone Wave to do mind control...

356
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,416
Yeah, I see you using that
power for good, Harem Boy.

357
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,375
Oh yeah......!
I can totally picture it...

358
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:12,291
Faris at my command...

359
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:16,000
I've got it.

360
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,208
My brilliance is
frightening even to me!

361
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,041
If you've got
something, just spill it.

362
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,833
If cell phones
are off the menu,

363
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:24,000
let's try sending
it to a pager!

364
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,166
Let see here...

365
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,250
"Pagers were miniature
receivers to which

366
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,125
one could send signals
through the telephone.

367
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:32,000
They enjoyed widespread
use in the 1990s,

368
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:35,375
but were antiquated by the
advent of cellular phones."

369
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:36,500
Pagers, huh?

370
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,500
So that's what
they looked like...!

371
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:39,791
Quaint technology...

372
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:41,250
I take it you're familiar
with it, Christina?

373
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:42,416
That's still not my name--

374
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,208
and I'm just
reading what's here.

375
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,250
Well, I hope you're ready

376
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,541
for your first assignment,
zero-zero-six!

377
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:51,000
It pertains to your wish!

378
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,916
Ascertain if your
mother had a pager,

379
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,166
and then ascertain the
number of said pager!

380
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,166
I'm on it!

381
00:19:58,625 --> 00:19:59,500
Good news, Kyouma!

382
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:01,750
She totally had one!

383
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,500
Still remembered
the number, too!

384
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,041
Excellent work, Double-O Six!

385
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:07,250
Have you decided what
you're going to say?

386
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:08,833
Yes!

387
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,416
I hope she already knows she's
expecting when she gets this...

388
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,916
I figured information stored
in a pager was limited,

389
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,791
so the message shouldn't
be too complicated...

390
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,000
I think it was a good idea

391
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,625
to keep the message
as short as we can...

392
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:21,041
Now we just need to
convert it into digits.

393
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,291
Monkey wrench.
Conversion's burning through

394
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:25,375
more numbers than
I thought it would.

395
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:26,625
Huh?

396
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,208
Looks like we can only
transmit enough numbers

397
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:29,833
for 24 characters at a time,

398
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:31,791
which means we're
four over the limit.

399
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:34,875
Fine... Observe...

400
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:37,458
Turning it into
numbers, we get...

401
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,250
Are you ready to send
your D-mail, Ruka?

402
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:43,416
Yes!

403
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,208
You're positive this
is a good idea, huh?

404
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:47,083
It's perfectly safe.

405
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:13,583
Different... but
I remember everything...!

406
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:16,375
Does that mean...?!

407
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,041
I don't know anyone
who would go out in that.

408
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:20,041
Sure! Why not?
It's comfy enough.

409
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:23,208
In fact, I think you'd look
really cute in this, Ruka!

410
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,916
Who, me...? Uh...

411
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:29,708
Dude or not?

412
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:32,625
Oh, real nice...! Keep your
eyes on the face, Mister!

413
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,958
Uh... I was doing research.

414
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,166
Now what...?

415
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,666
I can't ask if Ruka's a girl...

416
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:43,083
The poor thing would
probably faint...

417
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:46,541
I guess... the text didn't work.

418
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:48,708
Dude...?! Stop...

419
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:50,458
Why are you such a
creeper all of a sudden,

420
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:51,458
with the weird smile?

421
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:52,625
You're grossing me out.

422
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:54,125
Yeah, bad Okarin!

423
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:56,833
That skeeziness from
Daru wouldn't surprise me,

424
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,291
but I expect better from you!

425
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:00,083
Hey, who're you calling skeezy?!

426
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:01,458
I'm just a
red-blooded young man!

427
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:04,083
Call it what you want!
I've seen your hard drive!

428
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:05,333
Oooooh, yeah.

429
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:08,791
Something... Something
has changed from before.

430
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:12,083
We're on a
different world-line.

431
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:15,083
The question is... what?
