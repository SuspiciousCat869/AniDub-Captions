1
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,458
Look... Just hear
me out, please...

2
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:19,833
I know it's hard to believe,
but... you really were a dude.

3
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:28,666
Why do you keep saying that?

4
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,208
No, no, no. Don't cry...

5
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:32,250
I promise you, I'm not
trying to be mean...

6
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:35,958
I'm doing this for Mayuri.

7
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:37,708
I need you to find
it within yourself

8
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:39,458
to give up being a girl.

9
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:26,791
What's the damage...?

10
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:29,708
You're sitting there, like...
well... like an apprentice

11
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:32,291
who screwed up yakisoba
noodles in front of the chef.

12
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:34,708
Thank you... That's
not a bad analogy...

13
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:36,208
Well done...

14
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:37,916
Guess I prefer that to being
told I look like a busboy...

15
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,416
'Course could've gone the other
way with it... called me noodle.

16
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:44,458
Well hey, at least you
still have the gumption

17
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:46,708
to wring a bad joke
out of the situation.

18
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:50,500
Okarin! I am so mad at you right
now I can hardly see straight!

19
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:52,041
Wha... What are
you talking about?

20
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:54,000
Don't you even try to
play all innocent...!

21
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:55,916
You made Ruka cry!

22
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,333
How do you know that?!

23
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:59,375
I kind of put it together
when I invited her

24
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:01,416
to the lab today and
she burst into tears...

25
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,000
I asked what was wrong--you
know, like friends do--

26
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,583
and she told me
you called her a boy!

27
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:09,666
She didn't happen to
mention the D-mail, did she?

28
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,166
What's that got to do...?

29
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,416
Stop trying to worm your
way out of this, mister...!

30
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,541
You owe Ruka an apology
and that's all there is to it!

31
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:22,208
You jerk.

32
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:23,916
You don't say things
like that to a lady,

33
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,875
what's wrong with you?

34
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:26,375
Don't jump to conclusions...!

35
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:28,000
There's method
to my crassness!

36
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,375
Of course there is.

37
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,250
If I may speak with you
in private... I'll clarify.

38
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:34,916
Damn it! Would you quit it
with the jacket already!?

39
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:40,208
That's the long and
short of it, really.

40
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:43,791
The next D-mail I have to
undo is the one we let Ruka send

41
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,750
to his mother's pager while
she was pregnant with him.

42
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:50,250
So, Urushibara
really is a boy...

43
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:51,791
That's rather hard to take in.

44
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:55,750
Well, believe me, it's the
truth... At least it used to be.

45
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:59,166
But she's so... feminine...

46
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,541
Next you'll tell me
she looked like Hashida.

47
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:11,000
Ooooh. No.

48
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,541
Heh. look-wise, Ruka's no
different than he is now.

49
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:14,875
Whew. Okay, then.

50
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:17,500
Anyway... Point is, if
we intend to save Mayuri,

51
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,625
we have to persuade Ruka
to go back to being a boy.

52
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:21,541
Think about it, though:
is it necessary...?

53
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:23,500
In this case you know
what the text said,

54
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,625
so you can undo it without
her being a part of it...

55
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:28,833
A little underhanded maybe, but
it might spare some feelings...

56
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:30,916
I don't think Ruka could
ever be "persuaded..."

57
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,500
The problem with
that scenario is

58
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,666
that I haven't the first clue as
to his mother's pager number...

59
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,833
Besides... I'd really rather
not resort to cheap trickery...

60
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:40,458
We're playing with another
human being's identity here;

61
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:41,500
I don't want to be clever.

62
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,083
Good luck upholding
those principles

63
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:45,000
without reducing her to tears.

64
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:48,250
You're just joking
around with me, right?

65
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,625
'Course you are...
That's what you do.

66
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:53,666
There is such a thing
as taking things too far,

67
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,875
though; in case no one told you!

68
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:00,875
That didn't hurt for the
reasons you think it did.

69
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:03,083
What? I don't follow...

70
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:05,083
I was just trying to be as
straightforward as possible...

71
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:07,583
It's not like I told him he
was hideously deformed.

72
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,166
She's in love with you,
you moron...!

73
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,875
You might as well have told the
poor thing she was Quasimodo.

74
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,208
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

75
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:15,208
Stop...! Put yourself
in her place for a minute.

76
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,208
How would you feel under
the circumstances...?

77
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,791
Essentially sexless to
the person you desire.

78
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:23,250
But, he's... What am I supposed
to do? He really is a guy!

79
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:26,083
In another world-line
maybe, but not in this one.

80
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,375
He-- <i>she</i> --wants to talk to me.

81
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:37,000
Could you come by the shrine
when you have a chance?

82
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,041
Hi, Okabe.

83
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,291
Uh, so yeah.
Sorry about earlier.

84
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:46,833
No... I'm sorry for
getting so emotional.

85
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:49,666
Water under the bridge.
You wanted to talk?

86
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,416
Um, yes... I kind of had
a favor I wanted to ask.

87
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,708
By all means.

88
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,958
Okay, I'll just come
right out with it:

89
00:05:57,041 --> 00:06:00,875
I believe you... So... well...

90
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:02,333
Yeah?

91
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:07,291
I'll agree to go back to
being a boy if... if... oh...

92
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,708
If you'll be my boyfriend!

93
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:15,583
I'm sorry...?!
I don't, uh... Why me?!

94
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,916
Because I like you.

95
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,291
More than that:
I'm crazy about you.

96
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:22,750
All I...

97
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,750
All I want out of this is
to be with you for a day...

98
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:27,875
Just one day... Give me
that before I change back!

99
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:31,500
But... You're a dude... I...

100
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,791
Okay, okay: yes! Done deal!

101
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:38,291
Just stop crying...!
So be it...!

102
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,375
I'll take one for the
team, if only for day!

103
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:42,208
Let us be an item!

104
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:43,666
You really mean that?

105
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,041
Uh, the waterworks...

106
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:48,291
I'm sorry... I'm just so happy.

107
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:52,500
Unexpectedly touching...

108
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,208
So the only way
through this is for you

109
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:57,416
to go on a date
with her tomorrow?

110
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,541
That's correct.

111
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:01,750
Bleh. A mad scientist
and a high schooler...

112
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,833
Pardon my flesh
for crawling a little.

113
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:06,958
Ha ha... I realize
I'm throwing caution

114
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:08,708
to the wind by coming to my
assistant for dating advice,

115
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,416
but that's no
reason to taunt me.

116
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,000
I am not your assistant!

117
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:15,083
Oooh...! Kyouma's
going out on a date?

118
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:18,708
That's interesting... Here's
your iced coffee, Meow-ster...

119
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:21,750
Now, surely we're close
enough to tell me who with...

120
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:24,333
That is unless...
It's patently obvious...

121
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:27,000
I do not foul my own nest.

122
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:29,583
Mind if I make an
observation, Casanova sir...?

123
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,875
All this woman-chasing
is going to play havoc

124
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:33,208
with your special technique.

125
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:36,375
What does she mean
"all this woman-chasing?"

126
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:39,666
Hey! You can't leave
loaded statements

127
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,375
like that just
hanging in the air!

128
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,750
So... a special
technique, huh...?

129
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:52,083
I bet Ruka would love to
see what that's all about.

130
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,416
Wait, that came out wrong...

131
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,083
I was aiming that
at your alter ego...!

132
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,500
Well neither of us is amused
by your lewd insinuation...

133
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:02,458
Filthy assistant.

134
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,416
What...? Are you serious?

135
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,208
Wow, thanks for
making this awkward...

136
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,375
Look, she brought up
your special technique...

137
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:10,333
I was just pointing out
how stupid it sounded...

138
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:13,208
I wasn't... trying
to be all perverted.

139
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:14,375
You look like a radish.

140
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:15,833
Oh shut up...!

141
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:18,208
I'm blushing 'cause I know
your mind is in the gutter.

142
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,125
Point is, just go
on the damn date!

143
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,291
Why do you think we're having

144
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,166
this awkward conversation
to begin with?!

145
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,083
Okarin...

146
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:27,916
There some special
reason you were waitin'

147
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,583
to fill your ol' pal in
on the sexy details?

148
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,500
Dude, if it's dating
advice you're after,

149
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:34,958
I'm like the golden child!

150
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,916
Seriously, I've made
out with so many babes

151
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,958
they're thinkin'
about passin' a law!

152
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:43,083
Nene... Shiori...
Honoka... Rinka...

153
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,041
Thank you, Lothario, but no...

154
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:49,541
System cheats aren't going to
help me on a real tête-à-tête.

155
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:52,125
First things first, I need
to find somewhere popular...

156
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:55,250
Aoyama, perhaps...
Or Nishi-Azabu...

157
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:56,875
"Fashionable and trendy...

158
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:01,708
Premium night...
"Special dinner..."

159
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,250
I give up... This world
is alien to me...

160
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:08,083
How can a Martian be expected
to navigate the oceans of Venus?

161
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,791
Better steel yourself, capt'n.

162
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,041
Bite your tongue...!

163
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,375
My IQ is on par
with Sir Isaac Newton.

164
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,958
And like his august self I have
no use for the fairer sex...

165
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:19,083
Hououin Kyouma is
dedicated to higher purposes

166
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:20,666
than these ridiculous
flights of fancy!

167
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,458
Yes, we get it:
you're a genius...

168
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,916
As dedicated to science
as you are to virginity.

169
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,458
Oh and I suppose
you're experienced...?!

170
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:30,291
Pray tell how many wayward ships
have you coerced into your port?

171
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,833
Go on, I'm listening!

172
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,208
Just as I thought!

173
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,416
You're no less chaste
than the rest of us seekers;

174
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,250
ergo utterly devoid of
input on the topic at hand!

175
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,041
Not that I'd expect otherwise.

176
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:44,291
Fine! So I've never gone
all the way! Screw you!

177
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,666
"The key to making your
first date the first of many

178
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,250
is to put your
best foot forward...

179
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:56,166
What you wear is crucial;
brand names don't matter,

180
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:00,000
but overall cleanliness
and style certainly do..."

181
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,541
Good to go in that department...

182
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,750
Nothing broadcasts chic
like a crisp, white lab coat.

183
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,958
You are not
wearing a lab coat...

184
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:08,416
"Where you choose to dine
is equally important...

185
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,250
However, don't feel
you have to pick

186
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:11,833
somewhere terribly expensive...

187
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,791
Usually the ideal restaurant
is one you already frequent."

188
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:17,916
Ah, well in that case...
There's always here.

189
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,916
That's not what
they're saying, tool...!

190
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,416
A ramshackle greasy
spoon like this

191
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,041
is no way to wine
and dine a girl!

192
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:26,708
Okay... That only leaves
one option... Queen May's.

193
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:30,000
In what universe
is that acceptable?!

194
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:31,166
Then a weapon shop?

195
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,708
You gonna club her
over the head?!

196
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:35,958
Will you pry yourself from
the twaddle in that book

197
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:38,041
for two seconds and bring this
discussion back down to earth?!

198
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:40,125
You're a virgin, lest we forget!

199
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:41,458
I don't know what that
has to do with anything!

200
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,708
That's the point, isn't it?
How would you know?!

201
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:44,833
I'm going to punch
you in the face.

202
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:46,458
Excuse me...
Have you considered

203
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,708
giving the wisdom between
these pages a try?

204
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,875
That's a hentai game
strategy guide, jackass!

205
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:54,416
So...?! You don't think dating
is a giant part of that scene?!

206
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,666
Where do you think I learned
the best way to hold hands...?

207
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,625
The trick is to position your
arm so that a strategically

208
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,583
swinging elbow grazes some
boobage while you walk...

209
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,500
Before you know it,
you're all over each other

210
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:06,791
ike sea otters.
Man, it's so hot!

211
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,291
In fact, to hell
with you losers!

212
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,291
I've gotta go see a
man about a unicorn!

213
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:12,750
It's morning...

214
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:16,791
And I still don't have the
first glimmer of a plan...

215
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:19,000
Stop feeling sorry for
yourself and put it on.

216
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,291
Take the tags off;
you're not a mannequin.

217
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:24,083
And oh my god, have
you never worn a tie?

218
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,958
Seriously... Why am I even
bothering with this...?

219
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,458
Aright then.

220
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:31,500
Why do I feel like I'm about
to be taken out for a walk?

221
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:32,750
Your handkerchief...

222
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:35,041
Not that I expect you
to know how to use it.

223
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,625
Isn't this supposed to
symbolize something specific...?

224
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,208
Like "I've waited for you..."

225
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:41,000
Only if it's yellow and
you're in the eighties...

226
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,791
Why is some obscure
little factoid like that

227
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,916
even rattling around in
your head to begin with?

228
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,708
Same reason it's
rattling around in yours?

229
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,958
Uh! Stay focused...!

230
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,291
A gentleman spreads his
handkerchief out on a park bench

231
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:54,041
so his companion can sit
down without getting sullied.

232
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,541
You know what? Never mind.

233
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,083
I'll be following you covertly

234
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,208
so I can text you when you're
about to screw something up.

235
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:00,875
That, seems like a bit much...

236
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,458
Nonsense. Hashida! To arms!

237
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:04,750
Huh?!

238
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:07,291
Commence Operation Valkyrie!

239
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,708
Huh... catchy name.

240
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:13,791
"When meeting your date,
time is of the essence...

241
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:17,541
Be sure to arrive at
least fifteen minutes early."

242
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,750
Okabe!

243
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:25,500
I'm so sorry!

244
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:29,083
I thought I'd given myself
plenty of time to get here...

245
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,625
I, uh... hope you
haven't waited long.

246
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:35,791
No, no... I... Just got
here myself, actually.

247
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:38,375
Whew, oh good...
So I'm not late.

248
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:43,375
So ... Shall we go?

249
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:44,916
Sure!

250
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:55,791
I've never seen you out
of your lab coat before;

251
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,125
you look really sharp.

252
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,833
Well... this being a
special occasion and all...

253
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,083
"When walking down the street,

254
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:04,666
take the side of oncoming
traffic, but be subtle."

255
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,333
Something's
bothering you, isn't it?

256
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:09,541
No, not at all!
I'm just... thinking.

257
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,833
Oh my! What on earth is that?!

258
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,958
At least his heart's
in the right place.

259
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,708
"Causally-delicately--shield her

260
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:18,166
from any passing cars
and/or motorcycles."

261
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,333
Fire in the hole!

262
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:21,458
Atta boy!

263
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:22,791
Okabe...

264
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:23,666
Oww...

265
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,375
Are you two alright?

266
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:27,875
Don't accept help from
a maid, damn it all...!

267
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,583
A girl doesn't want to
see her man touching

268
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:32,666
some frilly little chit and
don't take her tissue pack!

269
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:36,208
Is it me, or are you gettin' a
vicarious thrill from all this?

270
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,416
So, the weather sure
is nice today, huh?

271
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,583
Yeah...

272
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,583
It is partially cloudy, though.

273
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,083
Yeah, I guess.

274
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,500
The cake is really good.
Not too rich...

275
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:00,208
Yes. I'm liking the coffee, too.

276
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:05,750
What is wrong with me...?!

277
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:08,291
I'm a master of small talk,
especially around Ruka...

278
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,166
Why does dating
change the dynamic?!

279
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,625
How did you find this place...?

280
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,500
I assume you must be a regular.

281
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,166
No...!

282
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,458
This is a shipwreck...

283
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,000
"The key to good conversation

284
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:20,166
is treating it like
a game of catch."

285
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,666
This is actually
my first time here.

286
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,875
He tossed it back!

287
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,416
And on the subject of firsts...

288
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,875
Today being August fourteenth,

289
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,875
this is the anniversary of
the first patent ever issued

290
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:32,000
in the country of Japan.
Isn't that fascinating?

291
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,916
Yeah, tossed it
back into the pit!

292
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,458
You're like an
encyclopedia of neat stuff.

293
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,666
Hmm? Well you know how it is.

294
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,750
Can we please get the
hell out of here now...?

295
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:47,833
It's not like we can just
bust through the window

296
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:49,916
on zip lines and rescue him...

297
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,208
We're not going anywhere until
we've seen this thing through.

298
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,791
Thank you. Come again.

299
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,583
Umm... Are you bored?

300
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,125
I mean with the
whole date thing...?

301
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:03,208
I'd understand... It's okay.

302
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:04,750
Don't be ridiculous,
of course not...!

303
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:07,458
I was just marshalling my
strength for phase two...!

304
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:08,916
Come along!

305
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,041
Ruka?

306
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:17,458
This heat is killing me...

307
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,083
He just walked straight
to Ueno and back!

308
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,125
What the hell?

309
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,166
Hey, Okabe...

310
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,458
Do you remember the first
time the two of us met...?

311
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:35,041
That amazingly chivalrous
stunt you pulled?

312
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:39,000
Those wannabe paparazzi
were swarming all over me

313
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:40,208
with their cameras and stuff.

314
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:41,541
I was terrified

315
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:44,583
and you jumped in to defend
a complete stranger.

316
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,083
Oh. Yeah.

317
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,750
I... I can't even
begin to thank you...!

318
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:54,583
Sorry for all the trouble.

319
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:57,041
Hm? Why are you apologizing?

320
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:59,291
Because I look like a girl...

321
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:05,750
People always make
a big deal out of it.

322
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,541
What you look like is
neither here nor there...

323
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,833
People are idiots.

324
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:13,041
The genuine you...
transcends that rot.

325
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,916
You have no idea what hearing
those words meant to me then.

326
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,541
For the first time
I felt like a real person.

327
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:23,083
It stuck with me...
Made me fall for you...

328
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:25,666
Hey... You'd have heard it
from someone eventually...

329
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:29,625
I... Wait! You
remember all that?!

330
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:32,416
But that comes from when you
were a guy, doesn't it?!

331
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,375
Well... I... That...
shouldn't make sense,

332
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:40,166
but I guess so...
I'm suddenly confused...

333
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,416
This is exactly what
happened to Faris...

334
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:46,333
Her memories are reaching
across conflicting world-lines.

335
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,583
Thank you... It was
sweet of you to do this.

336
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:57,625
Having you for my
boyfriend, even... for a day...

337
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,583
It was... It meant
everything to me...

338
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:03,666
Hey...

339
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,458
Here. My mother's
old pager number.

340
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:21,333
"Meat veg. Meat meat
veg. Meat veg meat. Veg."

341
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,666
That ought make Urushibara's
mom take the first message

342
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,041
with a big grain of salt.

343
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,958
She'll discount the
whole thing as a prank.

344
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:29,958
I think we're
ready to fire it off.

345
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:34,250
What's wrong, Okabe...?
You look a little...

346
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:37,416
Too-too-roo!
Great news, you guys...!

347
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,833
I saw Ruka out on a date with a
tall, dark man of mystery today!

348
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,333
How awesome
heart-warming is that?!

349
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:44,875
Uh... Yeah, she
was with Okabe.

350
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,416
What? Nuh-uh...!

351
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,958
This guy was wearing clothes
he wouldn't be caught dead in.

352
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:51,458
There was just this aura
about him, you know?

353
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:54,500
Total gentleman. Definitely
not someone we've ever met.

354
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:55,958
Exactly!

355
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,625
That wasn't the
real me out there...!

356
00:17:57,708 --> 00:18:01,541
Ruka was duped by a figment of
our imagination; a mere charade!

357
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:02,708
What happened?

358
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,166
Our date isn't over yet.

359
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,750
Wait, what? Okabe...

360
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:13,541
Kyouma...! How dare you
saddle me with that insult!

361
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,166
And enough of the boyfriend/
girlfriend, shemale shtick!

362
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:20,083
Prattling on about gender roles;
hell, I wasn't born yesterday!

363
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:21,875
The only thing that
matters is chemistry...!

364
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:24,416
Everything else
is a non-issue...

365
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,083
I'm the guru.
You're the grunt...

366
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,666
That's how it's
always been with us...

367
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:31,541
That is how it's always
going to be... Understood?

368
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,375
Yes sir!

369
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,250
Then showcase what you've
learned from knowing me!

370
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,583
Take up Samidare!

371
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,166
Excellent!

372
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,083
Don't falter! Keep it up!

373
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:44,541
Right!

374
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:47,166
Heed me, grasshoppa.
You have much to learn...

375
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,416
Stories of this blade's

376
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,500
supernatural proclivities
are notorious...

377
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:53,416
Many of them traceable
to Yoshitsune's time.

378
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,458
The most gnomic
and profound of these

379
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,625
tells of a wandering samurai,
lost beneath the--

380
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,250
This is officially a disaster.

381
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:00,666
Oh stop it, silly...!

382
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:04,541
Look how much they're
enjoying each other's company!

383
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,708
I think our work
here is done, people.

384
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,500
Promise me you'll save her...

385
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:16,625
Do whatever you have to.

386
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:17,958
I think I might know
what happened

387
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:20,166
to that old PC you've
been looking for.

388
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,541
The 5100?!

389
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:25,625
We had a computer from the
seventies that I kind of

390
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:28,416
maybe knocked over and broke
while going through storage.

391
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,500
But... it was a total
accident...I didn't know!

392
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:33,958
It was just another piece
of junk thrown into the mix...

393
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:36,875
I'm so sorry!

394
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:39,041
It's my fault... I'm an idiot...

395
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:43,708
But you've got to find a
way around it and save her!

396
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,708
Thank you for training
with me like we used to

397
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,041
in the old days;

398
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:50,666
it meant more to me than
I think you'll ever know.

399
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:51,833
I...

400
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:55,083
Please go... I don't
want to cry again...

401
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:56,500
You've seen me do it enough.

402
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,208
Hey! Aren't you
forgetting something?

403
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:07,333
The password...
El... Psy... Congree.

404
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:08,541
Congroo.

405
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:12,500
Sure... Whatever.

406
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:19,500
I... I really don't want
to do this... It's so...

407
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,916
I mean... The second
I give up being a girl,

408
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,250
I'll have to bury
my feelings for you

409
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:25,333
the way I've always done!

410
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:27,750
It's not fair!

411
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,625
I'm not allowed to
like you if I'm a boy!

412
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:33,583
People won't understand...

413
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:34,916
Rukako...

414
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,750
The thing is I could
handle all that

415
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:39,500
if I was just allowed
to remember how
wonderful today's been...

416
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:41,791
But this'll all go away...

417
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:44,375
I'll have no idea that you
and I actually went on a date...

418
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:48,125
That I got to hold you
like this without worrying

419
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:51,000
what everyone
else would think...

420
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,625
God, if I'd known being a girl

421
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:54,125
would hurt this
much in the long run,

422
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:55,291
I wouldn't have changed...!

423
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:57,958
Why did I do this to myself?!

424
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,500
Listen to me, damn it!

425
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:02,166
What you are doesn't matter.
It's who you are...!

426
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:06,250
Nothing's going to
change between us!

427
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:07,666
When you say it like that...

428
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,625
I can almost believe you...

429
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:11,875
And I'll have the first
thing you said to me...

430
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,875
That should be enough.

431
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,916
Just do me one
more favor, okay...?

432
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,041
Remember when
I was a girl...

433
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:22,666
Remember how different
things might've been.

434
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:26,541
I... won't be able to help it.

435
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:36,833
Why are you standing
there like that?

436
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:42,541
Urushibara Ruka...
Delicate as an orchid.

437
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:43,958
Fair as a cherry blossom...

438
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:46,666
The personification
of feminine grace.

439
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,750
Hey, uh... Question.

440
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:49,958
Yeah?

441
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:52,416
Do you... Like me?

442
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,333
Where's this coming from?!

443
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:55,541
Do you?

444
00:21:55,625 --> 00:22:00,958
Kyouma, please...
I... I respect you.

445
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:03,583
And... a dude.

446
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:16,250
One more D-mail... Deep breath.
