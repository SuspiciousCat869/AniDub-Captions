1
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:24,000
Impossible...

2
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:24,875
Behold...

3
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:28,750
my bleak and dusty doom...

4
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:29,958
It's me...

5
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:32,791
I've fallen prey to
their wily saboteurs.

6
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:34,375
What......?!

7
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:36,375
So my current peril is...

8
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:41,708
is in fact the will...
of Stein's Gate?

9
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:42,916
Yes, of course.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,708
Two weeks ago...

11
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:45,833
Less than, in fact...

12
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:47,833
The signs were all around me...

13
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:50,291
Plain as the nose on my face...

14
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:53,583
How could I have
been so blindsided?

15
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,916
Agreed... I'll check in later...

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,041
if this arid wasteland
hasn't undone me.

17
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:04,166
El...

18
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,958
Psy... Congroo...

19
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:11,083
Wassssup!

20
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:14,166
Hm? What the--? So...

21
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,583
you've joined the yakuza
or you're going on safari...

22
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:18,166
Am I in the ballpark?

23
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:22,791
These threads aren't
safari... They're L.A.

24
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:25,750
Short for... "lab appropriate?"

25
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:27,208
You're so forgetful, Okarin!

26
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:29,916
They're holding a big
Rai-Net tournament in America,

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,125
and Faris got an
invitation to compete in it,

28
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:34,458
so she's taking us all
with her for moral support,

29
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:35,791
don't you remember?

30
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:37,791
Ha...! You mean the
Great Federated States need

31
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:40,958
the presence of one Hououin
Kyouma to put things to rights!

32
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:43,375
Do you know how
delusional you are?

33
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:50,208
Hey, Kurisu just texted me!

34
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:51,458
Let's see what she says...

35
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:53,791
Looks like she's all
caught up with her work,

36
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:55,708
so she'll be able to
visit us out there!

37
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:59,916
And she made sure to
mention Okarin coming, too...!

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,916
Lookit!

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,291
What do we got...?

40
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:05,750
"Don't bother bringing
Okabe unless you have to...

41
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:07,875
My scientific credibility
can't afford it."

42
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:11,666
Man, if that ain't a textbook
slam-fest, I'll eat my hat.

43
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,250
Pish-posh...!

44
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,541
She wants us to sow the seeds
of the lab's trans-Pacific plot

45
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:17,750
under the guise of
a simple vacation!

46
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:20,583
Then I'm gonna pack
my big oopa pillow!

47
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,875
America, huh?
I hope it's a one-way trip.

48
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:27,833
Bring me back a gift, okay?!

49
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:29,041
Course I will, silly...!

50
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:31,791
How about you, Moeka,
do you want anyth--?

51
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:47,833
Or, uh...

52
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:49,041
Some chocolate...

53
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,791
Uh...

54
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:00,958
Here they come...

55
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,125
Reason for visit?

56
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,666
Well...

57
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,291
if you're going to be blunt,
let me refer to my manifesto.

58
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:18,250
"Aha...!

59
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,250
Look upon this
visage of chaos...!

60
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,125
I am a mad scientist...!

61
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:25,250
your precious Founding Fathers
cannot save you now!"

62
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,166
So, you're a mad scientist, huh?

63
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,916
No...! Wait!

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,750
I'd retract my previous
declaration regarding

65
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,875
any intended pandemonium
within your fine country!

66
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,333
In retrospect,
I should have explained

67
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:46,375
that it's an entirely
figurative manifesto...!

68
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:47,333
There he goes...

69
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:53,500
How dare they...?

70
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:55,708
Trying to block the entry
of a scientific luminary

71
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:56,875
such as Hououin Kyo--

72
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,791
Still like to rant, huh?

73
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,166
Typical.

74
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:03,250
Okarin...?

75
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:05,916
Aren't you gonna say hi?

76
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,750
Huh...?

77
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,208
Of course, it's you...!

78
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:11,083
How embarrassing not
to recognize my assistant.

79
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,000
I am not your assistant!

80
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:14,333
At first...

81
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:15,833
I thought perhaps you were
an Organization assassin

82
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,958
sent to neutralize yours truly.

83
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:18,833
What an idiot...!

84
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:20,458
He's worse than Leeroy Jenkins.

85
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,333
Still trolling the web, huh?

86
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:23,708
Shut it, Daru!

87
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:26,958
Just get in the damn car
before I change my mind...!

88
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:27,875
Uh...

89
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:29,000
hold on...

90
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,333
Don't tell me that
you intend to drive.

91
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:31,375
Got a problem with that?

92
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:32,666
Oh, Rukako?

93
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,500
Yes, Kyouma?

94
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:35,500
Please fetch me a taxi.

95
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,125
Hey! Son of a...

96
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:57,125
I watched you get out of
the stupid cab, you big faker.

97
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:02,125
What?

98
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:03,250
Cab fare please.

99
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:06,041
Um... excuse me??
You freeloading--!

100
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,500
Kyouma!

101
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,833
Look! It's Faris!

102
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:12,083
Meow come you cancelled
the hotel reservation

103
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:13,166
I made for you?

104
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,041
Oh, you'd rather our
enemies be privy

105
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:16,666
to our precise coordinates?

106
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,208
Oh no!

107
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:20,291
You mean the Seven Lords of
the North American Continent?!

108
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:21,250
Yes...

109
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,541
The Seven Philosophers!

110
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:26,250
It's time for the final
apocalyptic battle?!

111
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:27,791
Almost...!

112
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:30,375
But we must be careful not to
make the first move, my pet.

113
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,791
Don't you worry!

114
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,833
I'll send 'em all packing with
the Perspicacious Death-Paw!

115
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:37,375
You mean...

116
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:40,166
you've finally mastered the
most lethal of attack moves?!

117
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:43,791
Then cry havoc...!

118
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,166
And let slip the

119
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,875
Perspicacious Death-Paw-equipped
cat-girls of war!

120
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:50,333
Until flesh and bone
fail me, and my spirit

121
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:53,041
returns to the mead-stained
timbers of Valhalla!

122
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:55,625
The U.S. shall
taste of Ragnarok!

123
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:11,958
Pretty fancy domicile
for a mere assistant, no?

124
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:16,041
You're outta here as soon as
you have somewhere else to stay.

125
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,166
Step away from the tub!

126
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,208
Hands off the soda!

127
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,583
Aw, you too?!

128
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,833
Hello out there!

129
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:27,666
This is Julie Woodhouse
with the weather!

130
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,916
Why does this seem so familiar?

131
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,791
Cause this is exactly what
we'd be doing if we were home!

132
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:35,791
Creatures of habit, all o' you.

133
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:39,333
So... how's life been
treating you over here?

134
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:40,500
Fine, I guess...

135
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,166
Same as it did before.

136
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:45,000
Not writing any papers
on time travel, I assume?

137
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:46,166
Nah...

138
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,708
I thought I'd just
leave the raving about

139
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,916
alternate world-lines to you.

140
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,458
Fair enough.

141
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:53,666
But people have been known to
harbor the rare stray memory

142
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,000
from those other
world-lines, you know.

143
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,083
Look, I know what
you're getting at, okay...?

144
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,750
You wanna know
what I remember?

145
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:02,500
I remember you saving me
at the Radio Building,

146
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:05,625
and me finding you afterward
so I could thank you properly...

147
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:08,791
And that's all.

148
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:11,208
So you don't recall
anything more substantial?

149
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:12,375
Huh...?!

150
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:13,083
No...

151
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,500
Substantial like how?

152
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:16,833
Never mind.

153
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,041
Hello?

154
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,708
Really? Where is it?

155
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,750
No... Oh god no...

156
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:47,458
Are you trying to get
us killed, woman?!

157
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:48,208
See ya.

158
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:49,750
Oh no you don't!

159
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:52,416
You're really going to ditch
us at this house of ill-repute?!

160
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,000
Pretty much...

161
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,375
That's what you get for skipping
out on the room Faris set up.

162
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:57,791
What were you thinking...?!

163
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:00,083
Do you know how many
horror movies I've seen

164
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:01,833
that were set in one
of these deathtraps...?!

165
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:04,250
Some hillbilly psycho will
spot me through the blinds,

166
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,458
chainsaw through the door,

167
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,416
and jury-rig my face
into a belt-buckle!

168
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,166
How tiny of a role does
reality play in your life?!

169
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,750
Now you ask him that?

170
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,000
Kurisu...

171
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:14,875
I know motels can't be
as horrible as they are

172
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:17,916
in the movies but...
I'm still sort of...

173
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,166
nervous...

174
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,291
You'll be fine...

175
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,916
Now, I guess we had
better figure out

176
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,916
who's bunking with who, yeah?

177
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,208
Well, I've shared a room

178
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:27,250
with Okarin a whole
bunch of times before...!

179
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,125
We used to have
these great sleepovers

180
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,500
when we were young--just
the two of us!

181
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,208
Just you two?

182
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:35,416
Oh, get your mind
out of the gutter.

183
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,708
She just said, "when we
were young," didn't she?

184
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,166
What sort of
sad little virgin--?

185
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,250
You be quiet...!

186
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:41,458
The point is...

187
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:43,541
Mayuri's not sharing
a room with the guys!

188
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:45,875
Maybe you can bunk
in with Rukako--

189
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,208
He's kind of a guy, I guess.

190
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:49,333
Okay.

191
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:50,708
Or you know what,

192
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,041
maybe I'll just stick
around here for the night...

193
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,125
Then Okabe, rooms with Daru...

194
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:55,208
Mayuri's with me...

195
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,000
Huh...?!

196
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,916
So I'm all by myself...?!

197
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,625
I don't wanna...!

198
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:02,166
Okay, Mayuri and
I still share a room...

199
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,375
Daru is alone...

200
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,041
And you'll be...

201
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:06,500
I won't be scared at all...

202
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,166
with Kyouma nearby.

203
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,125
Yep...

204
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:13,583
Still a dude.

205
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:16,666
How did Makise end up as the
one with a bed to herself?

206
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,833
Because...

207
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:19,875
Rukako and Mayuri
sharing a room is fine.

208
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,375
Yeah it is...

209
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:22,291
Yuri-licious...

210
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:23,625
Dream on, Daru...

211
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:26,083
Plus, if their room were a
garden of Sapphic glee,

212
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,250
wouldn't this one be ya--?

213
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,125
What now?!

214
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,166
Hey, Okarin...?

215
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,375
Yes. What?

216
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,041
Wanna do rock-paper-scissors

217
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:35,208
to see who's gonna
sleep in the car?

218
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:45,166
What's the matter?

219
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,875
I surrendered the bed to Daru...

220
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:48,916
Mere courtesy, I assure you.

221
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,416
We need him running on
all cylinders tomorrow.

222
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,416
Lost at rock-paper-
scissors, huh?

223
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,708
Yeah, well, what are
you doing out here then?

224
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,083
I dunno.

225
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:33,083
Hey.

226
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,333
Huh?

227
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,041
Don't go just yet.

228
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,750
I want to ask you something.

229
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,708
What madness is this?!
It comes in diet?!

230
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,625
Take a couple back with you.

231
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:47,916
At the current exchange rate,

232
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,750
they're cheaper to
import anyway.

233
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,208
So, what's this
burning question...?

234
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:57,250
Of course!

235
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:58,208
You want me to
look over your work!

236
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,250
Genius that I am, it's--

237
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:00,000
You know what?

238
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:03,333
Just forget it.

239
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:06,458
It's not the first time
you've told me that, actually.

240
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,041
It's not?

241
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,208
Oh, that's right--it was
on another world-line.

242
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:11,500
You wouldn't know.

243
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:12,750
That's what I'm
talking about...!

244
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,791
I can think of a hundred
reasons why this

245
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,750
"alternate world-line"
craziness could never be true...

246
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:19,541
but then, I dream things...

247
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:23,208
things that feel more like,
I dunno, memories...

248
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:24,750
Moments like...

249
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:29,166
you're crying on an overpass
in Akihabara, and I'm there...

250
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,958
...or we're debating
equations written out

251
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:34,041
on a whiteboard, neither
of us backing down...

252
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:37,041
...or we're sitting
together on a stairwell...

253
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,291
and I'm patching up a
hole in your lab coat...

254
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:43,291
It seems you remember more than
your consciousness admits to.

255
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:44,791
So, they're all real?

256
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,375
When you get right down to it,

257
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:49,166
their authenticity is a question
of perspective and semantics.

258
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,333
Having never truly taken
place on this world-line,

259
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,666
"dream" is as appropriate
a term for them as any.

260
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,208
But they...

261
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,791
they actually happened on some
of the other world lines...

262
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,250
Yeah.

263
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,416
I see.

264
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,708
Um...

265
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:05,500
Can I...

266
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:06,791
ask another question...?

267
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,458
What is it?

268
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:09,791
There's this...

269
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:13,625
one particular... dream...
I keep having... But...

270
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:16,250
in this one... we're...

271
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,125
Yes...? We're what?

272
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,333
We're, uh...

273
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:24,000
If I could help you remember
it somehow, I would.

274
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,750
Yeah, I'll bet!

275
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:36,250
I'm so glad Okarin and Kurisu

276
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:39,166
are getting to spend
this time together...

277
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,500
Say your prayers,
Rai-Netters!

278
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:51,250
And that's the match!

279
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:54,458
Way to kick ass, Faris!
You guys got pwned!

280
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,208
I did it!

281
00:12:57,208 --> 00:13:00,875
Faris! Faris! Faris!

282
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:07,708
This chick's Rai-Net
cosplay is awesome!

283
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,958
Aren't you glad
I brought it Ruka?!

284
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:21,458
Here's... your omelet, master.

285
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,416
Hold on...

286
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,583
You just served me
without meowing.

287
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:28,791
Why do I have to
be a cat-girl maid?!

288
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,208
Because!

289
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,583
Part of your duty as goodwill
ambassador to the States

290
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:34,375
is extolling
Japan's maid culture!

291
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:36,875
I don't remember volunteering
for goodwill ambassador,

292
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:38,083
because I didn't!

293
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:39,666
We agreed to work the tournament

294
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,833
if they'd pony up the funds
for our plane tickets...

295
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:44,416
Ergo, your ears and apron.

296
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,208
So why am I stuck
wearing them, huh?

297
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:47,750
No one flew me anywhere.

298
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,666
It's for the greater
good of the lab.

299
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,791
Then you put on the damn apron!

300
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,000
You know, it's good to
see you so full of moxie.

301
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:57,583
I mean, last night you
seemed so pensive...

302
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:00,291
about the alternate world-lines.

303
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,791
Pensive...?

304
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,166
No, I was just a little
tired--that's all...

305
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,083
I mean, it's not
like I... care.

306
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,375
You're better off that way.

307
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:14,041
Believe me, those paths
are better left untrod.

308
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:17,791
None of it was real...
Not in the life I know.

309
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:20,958
You're right.

310
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,666
Thanks for waiting!

311
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,916
I didn't know they
were gonna run late...!

312
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,750
Suzuha...?

313
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:47,333
Suzuha!

314
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,833
How is she even here...?
This contradicts her farewell...

315
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,708
Before she left she said...

316
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:04,458
See you in seven years.

317
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:06,250
This world-line is
devoid of time-travel,

318
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:11,750
so there can't be a Suzuha until
her birth seven years from now.

319
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:12,875
But there she is...

320
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:15,125
Suzuha, in the flesh...

321
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:17,291
Maybe I was wrong
about this world-line...

322
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:22,333
Maybe it does have
time-travel... and worse...

323
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:23,166
Huh...?

324
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,500
What do you mean he's gone?

325
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:26,041
Now that you mention it...

326
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:29,250
I did see somebody in a lab
coat walk out of the event hall

327
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,000
a little while ago...

328
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,833
Hey, you guys!
So I asked around...!

329
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:36,958
Turns out Kyouma jumped
into a taxi and sped off!

330
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:38,041
No way!

331
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:40,500
Maybe the Organization's
after him...!

332
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:43,291
Dude's finally
lost his marbles...

333
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:46,125
Kurisu...!

334
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,125
Never thought I'd
have a doppelganger.

335
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,250
Trippy.

336
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:51,291
The resemblance is... uncanny.

337
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:52,875
I'm not even from L.A.

338
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,625
I was in town for
the tournament,

339
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:57,125
and now my friend and
I are heading to Vegas.

340
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,958
Any other day, you
wouldn't've seen me.

341
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,458
What're the odds.

342
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:03,625
Y'know, this lookalike of
mine must mean a lot to you...

343
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:06,208
You followed me
into the boonies...

344
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:07,208
It's sweet...

345
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:10,500
And more than a
little expensive.

346
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:11,416
If you knew her...

347
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,833
I think you would understand.

348
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:18,000
So, does that mean you don't
know where she is these days?

349
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:19,333
She's incommunicado.

350
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:20,916
But later...

351
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,375
seven years from now...
we'll meet again.

352
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:25,291
There, ya see...?

353
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,416
It'll all work
out in the end.

354
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,375
Funny that you
mention seven years...

355
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:31,458
A psychic told me
I'd get married

356
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:34,250
and have a kid around then.

357
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:36,250
Yeah... S'dumb.

358
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,500
No... That sounds right.

359
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,416
Huh...?

360
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,541
Sorry for cutting into
your travel time like this.

361
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:47,583
I'm glad you did.

362
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:48,833
Later!

363
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,375
Later.

364
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,375
"See you in seven..."

365
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,500
Daru, my friend...
you're gonna do just fine.

366
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:22,041
Wait...! Sixty-seven cents to
my name... and no charge.

367
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:27,333
How the devil do
I get back?! What?!

368
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:32,416
I started walking...
No other choice, really.

369
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,125
Kurisu...

370
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,833
Dammit to hell...!

371
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:57,750
I refuse to die in this
worthless, sun-bleached tundra!

372
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:00,125
Do your worst,
you sandy bastard!

373
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:04,125
You shall not claim the
life of Hououin Kyoumaaaaa!

374
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:17,541
I should've told her...
when I...

375
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:25,291
had the chance...I'm a fool...

376
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,333
I'll second that.

377
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:40,375
Just a mirage...

378
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,125
Wrong, but I'm flattered.

379
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:44,375
What your heat-addled brain
is perceiving right now

380
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,416
is an actual female.

381
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,916
I was worried about you.

382
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,166
Not worried enough to
fill up the gas tank

383
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,416
before you sallied forth...!

384
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,458
Excuse me for rushing out here!

385
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:01,166
My mistake!

386
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,583
What about your phone?

387
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:04,791
So inept.

388
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,458
You're a fine one to
talk, Mr. "Dead Phone

389
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:07,666
an' a Handful of Change!"

390
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,083
You'd be vulture chow right now

391
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:11,166
if I hadn't come and
scraped your sorry butt

392
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,000
off of this highway!

393
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,666
Cut me some slack.

394
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,958
I caught a glimpse
of what looked like

395
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,458
an old friend of mine
getting into a car,

396
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:18,208
so I grabbed a cab and
followed her, alright?

397
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:19,708
So that's what happened?

398
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,083
Uh-huh.

399
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:21,958
I see...

400
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,583
I thought maybe you had run off

401
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:26,458
because of what I said in
the diner this afternoon.

402
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:30,458
Hardly. Wait...
What did you say?

403
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:34,791
Huh?! Uh... you know...

404
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,083
About it not being real...

405
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:37,916
That. Right.

406
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,250
Yes, that!

407
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,750
What else could I possibly
be talking about...?!

408
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:44,500
I have to get to the bottom
of these dreams I'm having.

409
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:45,375
Why's that?

410
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:46,791
Because I...!

411
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:53,166
I just...Remember how...
I mentioned another dream...?

412
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:57,041
One I... didn't really
talk about...?

413
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,333
Why does it feel more real

414
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:00,166
than things that've
happened when I'm awake?

415
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,333
It was.

416
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:03,416
What...?!

417
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,208
Because it was real...
For both of us.

418
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:07,458
Wait, what are you saying?!

419
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,458
I'm saying that on an
alternate world-line,

420
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,833
I told you I was
in love with you.

421
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:14,875
I mean... I am in love
with you, Kurisu.

422
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,541
How do you feel?

423
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,416
That's not fair.

424
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,541
We might have gone through
a ton of stuff together

425
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:28,458
in those alternate world-lines
you've seen, Okabe...

426
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:30,416
But I'm in this one.

427
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,708
And whatever
happened between us

428
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:34,333
during that time feels
like a dream to me.

429
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:37,541
I don't know...
what you mean to me yet.

430
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,291
I have an ability
called Reading Steiner...

431
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:49,666
It's how I remember
things across world-lines...

432
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:53,500
It's how I remember you.

433
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,541
Fate gave us three weeks...

434
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:59,041
and I relived them...
time and again...

435
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:02,625
a rat skittering through a
maze of his own fashioning...

436
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:05,875
but my one constant...

437
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:11,041
the one truth that never
failed me... was you.

438
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:13,916
So I'll say it again...
I love you...

439
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,791
That's just something
you should know.

440
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,416
But what am I to you...?

441
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,083
Not in dreams,
not in dim memories...

442
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:26,333
What does your
heart say right now?

443
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:29,500
Okabe...

444
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:32,583
If... you really wanna know...

445
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:57,041
Just close... your eyes.
