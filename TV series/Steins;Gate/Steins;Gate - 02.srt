1
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:20,208
Huh? What are you doing?

2
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:21,875
Impossible...

3
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:25,291
How...?

4
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:31,541
You're... You're alive!

5
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:36,000
Are you a zombie?!

6
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:38,666
I'm about to scream bloody
murder here in a second, mister.

7
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,625
Look, I only want to
get to the bottom of this.

8
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:43,041
Where are the stab wounds?

9
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,083
What is your trauma?!
Get away from me!

10
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:49,708
Feel free to slap him
if he gets too grabby.

11
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:53,583
You were skewered like a pig!
I saw it plain as day!

12
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:57,166
Not more than three hours ago,
during Dr. Nakabachi's lecture--

13
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,500
Ix-nay on the azy-cray, dude.

14
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:00,791
We've been over this,

15
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:02,708
the doctor's lecture
never happened, remember?

16
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:04,000
But, I...!

17
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:06,750
Excuse me... They're
ready for you now, ma'am.

18
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,166
Uh... Coming.

19
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,125
You can't just saunter off!

20
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:10,333
No you don't.

21
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:13,708
You are sick.

22
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:15,125
Far from it!

23
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:18,583
I am Hououin... Kyouma!

24
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:58,666
First off, thanks
for coming today.

25
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,916
I appreciate it.

26
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,416
Um... It's only fair to
warn you I'm really not

27
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,333
all that accustomed
to speaking publicly,

28
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:08,208
so you'll have to strap in
and bear with me a little bit.

29
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,500
Wow, she's cutting
her teeth on us?

30
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,333
So I guess a zombie's
out of the question...

31
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:15,541
Will you get over this please?

32
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:16,958
Time machines will be the focus

33
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:18,875
of our discussion
this afternoon.

34
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,500
Kind of left
field from the topic

35
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,500
covered in my article,
I realize, but...

36
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:26,625
I'll try my best to
sound semi-coherent.

37
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,000
Coincidence, surely.

38
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,291
Personally, my assertion...

39
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,916
...is that they're no more
real than the boogey man...

40
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,041
Tantalizing to consider,
perhaps, but framed objectively,

41
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:39,625
something any serious physicist
simply outgrows--

42
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:40,833
Objection!

43
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,083
I'm sorry?

44
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,958
"No more real than
the boogey man..."

45
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:47,083
HA! Your evidence,
skeptic, please!

46
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:49,208
I hope no one saw
me come in with you.

47
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:50,916
That's not really...

48
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:56,875
Well-established
theoretical foundations

49
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:59,916
in virtually every branch of
physics argues against the idea.

50
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,666
I'm not a lone nut.

51
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,708
Pray continue.

52
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,125
Alright then... Fine...

53
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,750
You're so keen,
let's do this open forum...

54
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:11,083
Wouldn't want the conversation
hijacked by entrenched

55
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:12,916
nay-sayers, now would we?

56
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,541
Agreed...? Hououin Kyouma?

57
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:30,125
That infuriating...

58
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,916
Safe to say string theory
doesn't gibe with the notion

59
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,583
of bouncing around through
time in a blue police box...

60
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:39,625
However charming that sounds...
Any argument from you, sir?

61
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:42,583
So much for Gödel's view...

62
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,791
Let's forge ahead to
the next contender...

63
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:48,708
That is, I should say...
if I'm not moving too fast...

64
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:52,458
That concludes my reasoning with
regard to the quantum view...

65
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,375
Unless of course the
gentleman would like

66
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:55,833
to point out
something I missed...

67
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:57,416
Feel free to jump in, sir.

68
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,041
Auuuugh!!

69
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:01,791
Why must she be so
damnably articulate...?!

70
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,125
Blast...

71
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:06,708
I'm gonna leave you to
ramble, go find some AC...

72
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,250
Clearly the bastards
mean for this

73
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:11,000
to escalate into full-out
psychological warfare...

74
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:14,166
Easy enough though...
I'll just beef up my defenses.

75
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,416
Eight!

76
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:29,166
Nine... One more to go...
You can do it!

77
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:31,541
 Ten!

78
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,500
And the great Ruka
is victorious...!

79
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,583
Oh...! Hey, Okarin's
here! Too-too-roo!

80
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:41,375
Huh? Oh, Okabe... Uh,
I mean Kyouma... Sorry.

81
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:44,291
Don't tell me the password
has slipped your mind yet again.

82
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:49,083
Huh? Oh, right.
Um, El Psy... Concrete?

83
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,708
Congroo, I'm sure you mean.

84
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:52,500
That's the one, yes.

85
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:54,875
Right-o, so what did
you need me to carry?

86
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:57,625
Oh, it's right here...
I kinda...

87
00:05:57,708 --> 00:06:00,083
Well, you might say
I wasn't expecting the shrine

88
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:01,916
to give us so
much corny goodness.

89
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,416
Father received
them as a gift...

90
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,291
But we can't eat enough to
keep it from going to waste.

91
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:07,583
Works out for us...

92
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:10,083
Your donation to the
lab is most appreciated...

93
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,458
No doubt it'll give member
morale a little boost.

94
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:15,291
Really...? You're not
just saying that, are you?

95
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,708
Uh, errr...

96
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:21,083
Don't you think Ruka's sword
practice is starting to pay off?

97
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:22,625
Thank you... Oka--

98
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:26,875
I mean Kyouma wanted me
to show some discipline.

99
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:28,791
The Samidare Blade is
very close to revealing

100
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:31,208
its otherworldly secrets
to you, I'm certain.

101
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,958
Keep at it, and you'll be
a worthy wielder in no time.

102
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,458
Yes, sir!

103
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,000
And to think, you found it in
the weapons shop for only

104
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:40,833
980 yen and they didn't even
know it was magical and stuff!

105
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:44,291
Well then, let us inspect
your progress, grasshoppa...

106
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:45,958
Demonstrate an exorcism.

107
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:49,750
Uh. Well, sure.
I guess... Except, I...

108
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,791
Don't really perform
them all by myself...

109
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:52,916
Father's usually around to--

110
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,291
Auuuuughh!!!

111
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,541
A malign spirit has
taken possession

112
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,791
of my right hand, Rukako!

113
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:02,083
Banish it before I'm forced
to do something unseemly!

114
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,625
Be right back!

115
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:05,625
That spirit sure likes messing
with you while you're here.

116
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:09,166
Indeed! It is insatiable!

117
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,875
Urushibara Ruka...
Delicate as an orchid.

118
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:14,625
Fair as a cherry blossom...

119
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:20,541
The personification of
feminine grace... And a dude.

120
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:26,666
Tall as a willow...
Slender as a reed... A dude.

121
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:31,833
Radiant in shrine
vestments... Dude.

122
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:34,458
The sun dips low in a rosy sky.

123
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:40,583
Cicadas buzz...
Ruka... is a dude.

124
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,333
Bye!

125
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:50,000
How cool is it that we know
someone who can do exorcisms?

126
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,083
Being in good with the
shrine has its perks.

127
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:55,750
Take that evile spirits! Oof!

128
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,500
Oopsie... Heh.

129
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:01,375
Aww...

130
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,333
Don't tell me they've
blocked this off.

131
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:07,541
They had to. It's leads to the
back of the Radio Building.

132
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,250
Guess that makes sense.

133
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,791
I'll take the swag.

134
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,958
You've got work, right?
Hand it over.

135
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:27,458
Hmm... Aren't
you a gentleman...?

136
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:32,541
It's a late shift today,

137
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:36,083
so I'll probably just head
on home after I get out.

138
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:36,791
Hey...

139
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,291
You, uh...

140
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,208
really don't remember hearing
that scream this morning?

141
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,291
What? Where?

142
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,000
The stairwell of
the Radio Building.

143
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,166
Umm...

144
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,041
That'd be the kind
of thing to stick out.

145
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,250
You'd think so, yeah.

146
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:53,000
Well, anyway. Never mind.

147
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:56,416
Hahaha. You're so
random sometimes.

148
00:08:57,416 --> 00:09:00,666
I don't get it.
No one remembers but me.

149
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:04,083
If this isn't some elaborate
prank, I'm losing my mind.

150
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:10,666
Shuttering up early
today, Mr. Braun?

151
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:16,166
Can't speak for this Mr. Braun
fella, but I am, yeah.

152
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,041
Interviewing a part timer.

153
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,541
You're kidding me...

154
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,041
Has father time encroached
so swiftly that help is needed

155
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:25,000
to maintain a clientele-free
cavern like this?

156
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:27,583
Come closer and ask.

157
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:30,083
Hey, you guys!

158
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,250
Sorry.

159
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:36,958
That's how all the cool kids
are sayin' wassup these days.

160
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:39,083
I'm guessing she's
not here to shop.

161
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,166
You stay out of this...
Gimme a name.

162
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,083
Amane Suzuha.

163
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:42,833
Your age?

164
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:43,500
Eighteen.

165
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,458
Reason for applying?

166
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:45,708
Serious CRT buff.

167
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,208
You're hired.

168
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,041
Nice bit o' vaudeville; you
should take it on the road.

169
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,875
Should I care what you think?

170
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,583
Not 'less you give a
crap about some idiot

171
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,250
rentin' the space above us.

172
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,375
An "idiot" who happens to
be none other than Hououin--!

173
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,000
You want me to double your rent?

174
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,541
Okabe Rintarou.

175
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:02,625
Nice to meet'cha!
Whacha got in the bags?

176
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:05,833
Have a look. Donations in
the form of intelligence corn.

177
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,583
I could, part with
an ear for a song...

178
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:10,750
Groddy. Looks like it's made
of little yellow blisters...

179
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,375
Cool to see how it
starts out, though.

180
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:13,375
You've never seen...?

181
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:14,083
Lemme touch it!

182
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:15,583
Easy.

183
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:16,916
Be warned, girl...

184
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,500
Many a passing
acquaintance of mine

185
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,208
has been hounded
by the Organization...

186
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:24,458
Sara. Dear Claudia.
Innocent Simone...

187
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:27,583
That's so tragic... Well,
I don't frighten easily, mister.

188
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:29,291
Please don't
encourage the guy...

189
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:30,916
He's whacked enough as it is.

190
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,166
Yeah?

191
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:35,166
Ha! Just keep telling
yourself that, Cue Ball.

192
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,875
One day, the world shall
tremble beneath my feet.

193
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:45,208
So... Evil laughs are trendy?

194
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:03,916
The crash was right around noon.

195
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,916
Then that corroborates
Daru and Mayuri...

196
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,208
So it <i>was</i> cancelled.

197
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,916
"Makise Kurisu..."

198
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:29,291
Working hypothesis: Reality
and my brain are at odds.

199
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:43,125
Huh? What do we have here?

200
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,333
SERN maintains a strict monopoly
on the time machine market...

201
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:57,833
Civilians and corporations alike
are banned from acquiring one.

202
00:11:57,916 --> 00:11:59,583
This is how they've
been able to implement

203
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:03,583
their vision unchecked;
why the world's the way it is.

204
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:06,125
I'm here to reroute the past
for the sake of your future.

205
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:09,041
I've come to take down SERN
and thwart the dystopian mess

206
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:12,833
they've created in my own time.
I'm here to protect freedom.

207
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,166
Aren't you worried
that by being here

208
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,541
you run the risk of
creating a paradox?

209
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,833
Ah, the so-called
'Grandfather Paradox?'

210
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,041
It doesn't exist.

211
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:22,250
It's possible to
meet your past self.

212
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,875
You'll simply change
world lines if you do.

213
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:30,541
You have to let go of this
idea of time as a single line

214
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,583
moving from past to future.
It's actually comprised of

215
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,625
infinite lines all
running parallel.

216
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:38,208
We call these "world lines."

217
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,666
Let's say for example
someone murdered you.

218
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,375
By traveling back
in time to prevent it,

219
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,583
I create two divergent worlds:

220
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:47,041
one where you're killed,
one where you're not.

221
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:50,083
The same basic idea is
true of all such actions.

222
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:53,125
The traveler splits off
to a different world line.

223
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:59,041
So his thing now
is he's Japanese...?

224
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:02,250
He rears up on U.S.
message boards back in 2000,

225
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,666
claiming he's from 2036...

226
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,791
...alludes to a
war-ravaged future

227
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:10,750
he's traveled back in time to
try and steer us clear of...

228
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,291
...takes the internet and every
underground publisher by storm.

229
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:16,083
Still, though... You'd think

230
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:18,708
a decade would've cooled
down the imitators by now.

231
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:25,041
Come on, stop giving me
dead links. It's annoying.

232
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:28,416
Damn it! Why'd you have to nix
all your files on the S.O.B.?

233
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,083
A dozen results...? No way.

234
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:36,375
Ten years ago every chode

235
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:38,541
with a .com address
was on top of this thing!

236
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,125
Impossible!

237
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:46,125
No, no, no... This is wrong...

238
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:49,416
I had books about him on
this shelf! I'm certain I did!

239
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:56,958
Daru. It's me.

240
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:59,458
This better be good,
dude. I'm with Faris.

241
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:00,583
Where'd you move my books?!

242
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:01,833
I'm sorry?

243
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:03,750
The ones I had on
John Titor, man...

244
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:06,166
Look, I've always kept
them in the same place...

245
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,708
Tell me you moved them!

246
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:08,958
Wait. Slow down.

247
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:10,416
What?!

248
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:15,666
Who the Hell is
John Titor...? Dude?

249
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:20,125
I spent all night trying to
turn up pay dirt on the man...

250
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:25,750
No stone unturned, no forum
un-scoured... And yet...

251
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,208
"I have a question
for you, Titor...

252
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:34,041
About ten years ago...
The year 2000, in other words...

253
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:36,083
That's an interesting
topic you bring up.

254
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:39,750
Unfortunately, however, I've
never visited the year 2000.

255
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,916
Nor do I have any plans to.

256
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:59,083
Excuse me...?!
What in the...?!

257
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,875
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa! Not so fast!

258
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:04,125
Er, that is to say, hold the
phone just a moment please!

259
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,583
Or rather, delete the
pictures you just took of me

260
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:09,000
from your phone
for your own safety!

261
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:14,500
I'm sorry... Apparently
I've offended you in some way.

262
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,916
What were you
taking pictures of?

263
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,041
Evidence.

264
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:21,708
Evidence I was here... I mean...

265
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:25,625
Of the stuff I've seen...
I suppose you could say.

266
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:31,666
Can I show you something?

267
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,208
Sure?

268
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,000
This.

269
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:38,250
Quite the dinosaur
you've got there, miss.

270
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:39,458
You're an expert?

271
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:40,375
Sorry.

272
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:42,125
Do you know anyone who is?

273
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,833
Well, uh, Daru, but...

274
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,500
A friend of yours, I guess?

275
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,625
I don't think that's
any of your business...

276
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,666
Kindly delete those
pictures, if you would.

277
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:55,166
I need this Daru's
contact info. Please.

278
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,625
I think not!

279
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,458
I don't believe this...

280
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:02,500
You're trying to
strong-arm me, aren't you?

281
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,500
I'll delete it, if you tell me.

282
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:10,375
Uh... Ah... Very well then...

283
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:13,041
But you're mistaken if you
think I'll sell out a cohort...!

284
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:16,833
I'll give you <i>my</i> contact info.

285
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:18,333
What name should I type?

286
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:19,375
Can't you read?

287
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,625
It says Hououin
Kyouma right there!

288
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:27,625
Fine... Allow me.

289
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,666
'Kay. Just send me
a blank text, then...

290
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,958
I'll reply back when
I have a free moment.

291
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,458
Welcome home, Meow-ster!

292
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,125
We've been waiting for y--

293
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:45,583
Oh! I didn't know it was you...!

294
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:49,208
Well then welcome
home meow-ster Okarin.

295
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,750
So... How's tricks, May?

296
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:54,291
It's Meow-ushii while
I'm on the clock, silly...

297
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:55,708
Ohhhh, you know what?

298
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:58,083
We should find a way to
make your name kitty-ish too.

299
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,333
How bout Rrrowkabe?

300
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:00,666
Is Daru around?

301
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,375
Oh, he's lounging in the back.

302
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,375
Kyouma!

303
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:07,000
What happened to your solemn
oath to darken our doorway

304
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:09,375
every three days, you
big goofy Frankenstein?

305
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,541
Ah... Blame the
Organization, love.

306
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:14,250
Oh... You poor thing!
What have they done now...?

307
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,541
Tell me you've got a plan!

308
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:17,166
Whatever it is, you
know we've got your back!

309
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,416
In good time... I'll take my
usual Stealth Field, thank you.

310
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,708
Hang on now... When're
you gonna let me join?!

311
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:26,041
Faris...! I cannot let you fight
my battles in good conscience.

312
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:29,833
Not even when I've mastered
my super secret special move?

313
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,166
Do what...?!

314
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,958
Surely you can't have
perfected it so quickly...

315
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:34,500
Oh, but indeed I have...

316
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:37,916
Months of hardship in the Guiana
Highlands couldn't deter me,

317
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,250
nor the death of
my beloved master...

318
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:43,291
No...! I have the power!

319
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:45,541
You do realize I hate you now...

320
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,583
So, about my text message...

321
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:53,541
Seriously. I'm not talking
to you. You're dead to me.

322
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,791
Ugh... Stop worrying...

323
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:58,625
I have no interest in a girl
who spews naught but falsehoods.

324
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:02,083
Watch it... I can't allow you
to talk about my girl that way.

325
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,708
Strong words for a Don Juan...!

326
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,458
Your precious harem
know you're here?

327
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:07,916
Nice try, chief... It doesn't
count if I fool around

328
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,541
on 'em with a flesh
and blood woman!

329
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,375
Okay. Change of
subject, please...

330
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,291
Here. Have a look at this.

331
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:17,041
Whoa... That's your classic
IBN Fifty-one-hundred.

332
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:19,041
Is that a big deal?

333
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,791
Dude, it's not just retro, it's
like the rarest of the rare.

334
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,500
'Bout a month ago,
word through the grapevine

335
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,083
had one floatin'
around here somewhere.

336
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:28,000
Your new friend and me probably
troll the same message boards.

337
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:28,708
And?

338
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:29,958
It hasn't turned up yet.

339
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:31,833
Knight Heart couldn't
even get a lock on it,

340
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:33,083
so my bet is the
whole thing was

341
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:34,750
just a rumor someone
threw out there

342
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:37,250
to light a fire under
the local antiquing crowd.

343
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,083
What do you think it's worth?

344
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:40,583
Well it's been
about thirty years

345
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:41,916
since they had
'em on the market...

346
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,666
PCs were still so pricey
back then not many people

347
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,416
had the scratch lyin'
around to buy one...

348
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,833
Kinda the dark ages, in a way.

349
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:49,958
Really...

350
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,958
Ah... and speak of the devil...

351
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:56,666
It would appear
this Kiryuu Moeka

352
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,250
is a woman on a
bit of a mission.

353
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:03,875
Oh joy, the plot thickens: she's
a "freeter"--whatever that is.

354
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:07,333
And evidently only a person
of few words in person. Great.

355
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:08,500
What's up?

356
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:09,875
You owe me a lunch

357
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,750
for not unleashing this
chatty Kathy on you, man...

358
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,458
"Sorry. No dice...

359
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:19,791
My sources say it was probably
just a rumor... El Psy Congroo."

360
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:23,000
Bon appetit, Meow-sters!
Eat while it's hot.

361
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:27,125
Bitchin'! Prepare
to be impressed...

362
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,416
I'm about to do some damage!

363
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,791
Keep it in your pants.

364
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:32,458
Oh man, this is
heaven on a plate!

365
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:35,125
I'll be sure to send your
compliments along to the chef.

366
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:41,625
Analysis: the gel-nanas,
hitherto fore so to be named,

367
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:44,458
have been ripped asunder
at the molecular level.

368
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:48,041
Hmm... They're basically
mutant bananas, you mean...

369
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:53,125
That can't be good. What do
you s'pose is causing it?

370
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:56,125
I think you'll agree the
only conceivable explanation

371
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:59,166
at this stage is some sort
of uncommonly intense EM wave.

372
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,333
What's your basis?

373
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,750
A mad scientist's
intuition, my friend.

374
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:05,083
Gotcha. Flyin' by the
seat of our pants.

375
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:06,416
Ready when you are, boss.

376
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,458
Superlative! Let us
then commence!

377
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:12,208
Uh, you really wanna use these?

378
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:13,916
Fear not, Double-O 3.

379
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,416
These specimens are the fruit
of Mayuri's generous donation...

380
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,750
Yeah, they're hers.

381
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,833
We haven't time to quibble
over particulars, Hack,

382
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,000
for this is science.

383
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,208
Okay, but I think
one's more than enough.

384
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:29,416
Just note, while I was
willing to up the ante,

385
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,666
you remain a one
banana Cautious Carl.

386
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,166
You know,

387
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,541
I refuse to be insulted by
the guy who named this machine.

388
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,250
Phone Wave (Real
Name TBA) happens to be

389
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,708
a clever ruse to throw the
Organization off our scent.

390
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:49,208
Well, you're the only idiot here
who thinks they're sniffin'.

391
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:50,583
Oh is that a fact?

392
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,541
Just callin' it
like I see it, man.

393
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:54,916
Done.

394
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,541
What is it?

395
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,375
It's gone! Look!

396
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:03,833
Impossible!

397
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:07,791
Red alert...

398
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:12,041
Implement emergency lock-down
protocol Theta 666 immediately.

399
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:13,583
Don't give me that!

400
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,125
Damn you, there's no time to
push this through parliament!

401
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,500
Right now? Seriously?

402
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,333
Is this your idea of a joke?!

403
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:21,875
Uhh... Hey, if anyone's gettin'
punked here it's me.

404
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:24,416
Look, either you've palmed it

405
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,041
or we have a
teleporter on our hands!

406
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:29,583
A what? You think
it teleported??

407
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:31,958
Come on... That's crazy talk.

408
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,541
Crazy talk, is it...?!
Open your eyes!

409
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,791
How else does an
ordinary banana go from--

410
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:48,166
How. The. Hell...?

411
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,666
Um... That's funny...

412
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,333
I could've sworn we tore it
off from the rest of 'em...

413
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:55,333
Funny. I could've sworn I saw
you do it not a minute ago.

414
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:57,208
Yeah... That's what I thought.

415
00:21:57,291 --> 00:22:00,458
I think... we might
be on to something.

416
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:02,458
Kinda seems like it, huh?

417
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:05,166
Interesting experiment
you've got going on there,

418
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:10,250
Okabe Rintarou... or wait...
I'm sorry, is it Hououin Kyouma?

419
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:16,583
Makise Kurisu...!
