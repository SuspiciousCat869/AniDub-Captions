1
00:00:08,625 --> 00:00:14,625
"Outcome of trial:
Human is dead. Mismatch."

2
00:00:14,708 --> 00:00:16,750
Human is dead?

3
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:18,291
Uh-huh.

4
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:19,458
Someone...

5
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:22,125
...died?

6
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:25,083
Apparently so.

7
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:26,958
What else is there?

8
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:28,333
According to this,

9
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,708
there's more in "Jellyman's
Report, number 143."

10
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:32,041
And that is...?

11
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:34,666
Your guess is as
good as mine, dude.

12
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,166
There's a weird lookin'
database here, though...

13
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:40,625
Okay... What is this?

14
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:43,458
Some... kinda proprietary code?

15
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:54,750
Eff this!

16
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:58,750
I officially have no idea
what I'm looking at...! Die!!!

17
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:01,375
Maybe this would be a
good time to take a break...?

18
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:06,125
Hhhh... Who did I think I was?
Unreadable code is unreadable.

19
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:09,000
You've fought nobly, sir.
Take a breather.

20
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:11,291
Take a freakin' nap, more like.

21
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:13,458
I got some more
noodles, if you want.

22
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:14,333
Thanks, May.
I'll take it lyin' down.

23
00:01:14,416 --> 00:01:16,333
Proprietary code...

24
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:19,125
He was say something
like the IBN 5100

25
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:21,500
was built before
PCs were using BASIC,

26
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:24,375
so it can read IBN's proprietary
programming language--

27
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:26,750
The IBN 5100's
singular abilities

28
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:28,916
are needed to halt
SERN's ambitions...

29
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:32,750
I would very much like to
speak with you at some point.

30
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:34,750
This is my email address.

31
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:37,500
If you contact me, I will reply.

32
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:16,250
How much clothing do you have?

33
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:20,166
I threw a couple of Daru's
things in the mix, too...

34
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,125
Sorry; we've been pulling
a lot of late-nighters...

35
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:24,416
You should be able to tell
his unmentionables from mine

36
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,666
by the disparity in size.

37
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,458
 Oh my!

38
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,000
Okabe!

39
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:35,125
Wassabi!

40
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,291
That is not my
name... Firstly...

41
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:40,208
Secondly, a hearty "hale and
well met" will suffice...

42
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,083
Thirdly... From what pit
do you mine your slang?

43
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,708
Wassabi, Suzuha!

44
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,083
Cut it out...!

45
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:47,333
Wait a sec, since when
do you two know each other?

46
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:48,583
We spend too much time

47
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,958
in the same building not
to have met eventually.

48
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:53,125
And just lookie at
the sweet Rai-net card

49
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:57,041
she gave me when
we did: Good as gold!

50
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:58,041
Where you off to?

51
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,500
Oh, laundry...

52
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,291
Okarin and Daru
have been working late,

53
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,541
so they're getting kinda stinky.

54
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,541
Part-timer!

55
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:07,166
'Less you wanna be a
short-timer, get crackin'.

56
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,291
Right...

57
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:12,250
And you stay
clear of her, Romeo.

58
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,541
Interesting appellation
to lay on me,

59
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:17,083
when clearly the
love-struck one here is you.

60
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,333
Shut it, freak...

61
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:20,333
One day you're gonna
mouth off like that

62
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:21,583
in front of my daughter...

63
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,041
At which point
I'm gonna end you.

64
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:25,916
Nae? Your rodent?

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,875
Hey, don't talk
about her like that!

66
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:31,000
If anyone's the rodent it's the
guy drooling over the damn kid!

67
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:33,458
I'm right here,
and I am not a kid!

68
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,083
I am a skilled warrior.

69
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:36,083
A what?

70
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:37,791
You tell him, part-time girl...

71
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:40,583
Keep that sharp tongue of
yours whetted on his blunt head

72
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,125
and I'm certain you'll
rise through the ranks

73
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:43,666
of your battalion in no time.

74
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,000
Oh, shut up...! You contaminate
people with your craziness!

75
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:47,250
Hey! I can take care of
myself, 'kay, thank you.

76
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:48,583
You'd think I had
a sign on my back

77
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,916
that said
"insert crazy here..."

78
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:55,291
Hhhhh... See ya.

79
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:56,916
Yeah, we...

80
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,333
It's a little tic of hers,
you might say...

81
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:09,708
I've dubbed it
"Shaking Hands with Stardust"

82
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:19,333
Bet if I did this long
enough, I'd reach a star.

83
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,916
Best wait till you
can see some, though.

84
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Hey, now...
Just 'cause I can't see them

85
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,916
sometimes doesn't mean
they're not always there.

86
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,375
EM waves, definitely...

87
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,750
Which, of course, would
be the simplest explanation

88
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:39,500
for the cell phone's
odd behavior...

89
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:42,250
Except... That banana was...

90
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:45,833
This humble kitchen
appliance... is a time machine!

91
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,833
Hmph! Whatever.

92
00:05:56,541 --> 00:06:01,416
Oh, dear... I hate leaving Faris
here in the dark all alone.

93
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,166
Look away.

94
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,125
'Kay.

95
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:06,250
The man's a universe
unto himself:

96
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,583
ever expanding and
plagued by entropy.

97
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:12,875
Of course it'd be
Shining Finger...

98
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:15,333
Come on, Titor.
Respond to my damn text...

99
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,583
I don't like being
held in suspense.

100
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:21,708
Okay, okay. I get it.
Lay off... Ugh.

101
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,208
Thank you for contacting me.

102
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:29,041
Regarding the screen cap
you sent of that code:

103
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,875
it is indeed a proprietary
programming language

104
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,375
developed by IBN.

105
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:36,833
You'll need an IBN
5100 to un-encrypt it.

106
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:39,000
Good luck finding one, though.

107
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:45,083
Hop to, people! The lab
is now at Def Con One!

108
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:48,541
Super top secret emergency
protocol's in full effect!

109
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:54,500
Okarin. You're kind
of scaring me...

110
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,500
Wake up, pork pie!

111
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,125
Our battle with the
Organization is about

112
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:00,458
to reach a frenzied pitch!

113
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:02,791
We have the means to smoke
them out of the shadows!

114
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,833
D'you just say
something about pie...?

115
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:07,291
Focus on SERN, damn you!

116
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,166
Puppet masters of an
inconceivably vast

117
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,583
worldwide conspiracy?!

118
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:12,833
Dark overlords obsessed
with twisting science

119
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:15,250
to their own vile and
nefarious purposes?!

120
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:18,666
The world needs only one
despicable mad scientist...!

121
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,875
We have to realize our
goal of global dominion

122
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:22,833
before the upstarts
cut us off at the pass!

123
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:25,458
'Kay, I'm just
gonna say it: I'm lost.

124
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:28,750
Here's the plan... we track down
and snatch up an IBN 5100...

125
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,458
That done, we crack SERN's code

126
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:32,166
like eggs over a
cast iron skillet!

127
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,541
Into the breech, friends!

128
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:37,541
Uh... I hate to tell you...
But I gotta work today.

129
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,166
I stand alone.

130
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,875
You might be of
use to me after all.

131
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,333
Well, lookie here.

132
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:58,833
Excuse me.

133
00:07:58,916 --> 00:07:59,958
What now?!

134
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:01,458
You're coming with me.

135
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,208
Hey, hold it!

136
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:07,458
This was a nice jacket
when I woke up today.

137
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:10,125
How can you not have dug
up a single lead yet...?

138
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:11,875
Bacon-fed moron...

139
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,833
There a reason
you're scowling at me?

140
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:17,208
This look's not meant
for you... Rest assured.

141
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:19,625
Yeah, well...
Then knock it off.

142
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,041
Sulking, are we...?

143
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,416
To her credit,

144
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,083
Mayuri felt you might be
inclined to irritability...

145
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:26,416
Don't you think
you're a bit too old

146
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,125
to rely on such
childish tactics?

147
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,291
Why hello, Kettle.
My name is Pot.

148
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,958
Anyway, what'd you
want to talk about?

149
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,541
It's very simple, Christina.

150
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:37,333
I want to you dispense
with the attitude

151
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,333
and come back to the
lab on assignment.

152
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:41,666
You consider that the
attitude might have something

153
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,666
to do with that name?

154
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,875
Kindly let me finish, Zombie.

155
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,291
When do you ever?!

156
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,958
How did I end up in league
with a head-case like you...?

157
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,458
From this point forward,

158
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,875
my curiosity can suck
it up or go to Hell.

159
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,125
What...? Seriously?!

160
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:57,083
What's wrong now?
Is it bad news?

161
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,791
You've no idea. Wait...

162
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,625
Suppose this text
obsessed girl's in bed

163
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:02,625
with the Organization?

164
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,250
What Organization?

165
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,958
The only one that matters!

166
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:08,541
A big, transnational
conglomerate secretly pulling

167
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,041
our strings from the shadows!

168
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:13,500
Oh, wonderful. You're one
of those... A conspiracy nut.

169
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:14,375
What's wrong?

170
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,291
Uh... Nothing.

171
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,708
What do you want from me?

172
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:23,250
I said it was nothing!
Pursue it and you loose a tooth!

173
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:25,583
Lashing out... No matter...

174
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,541
Come with me to
recover my laundry

175
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,500
and I'll give you your mission.

176
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:30,916
Uh...

177
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,750
I'm not some slave girl on
a chain... Wait, laundry?

178
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:38,250
Hmmm. Interesting setup.

179
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:39,958
Your hotel doesn't have one?

180
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:42,625
No, it's too ritzy
for that kind of thing.

181
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,500
'Sides, I'm not really
all that comfortable

182
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,291
with leaving my
clothes in public.

183
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:49,666
Well, observe how
the other half lives

184
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:53,625
and be grateful I ushered you
across that--Still no change?

185
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,000
Why would there be?

186
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,375
It's a washing machine,
not a particle accelerator.

187
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:59,791
Oft times the most enigmatic
features of the universe

188
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,666
couch themselves
in the commonplace.

189
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,833
Who, for example,
could've predicted

190
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:06,333
a cell phone transforming a
microwave into a time machine?

191
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:07,958
It's not a time machine!

192
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,041
Huh?

193
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,458
Listen... Time
machines are fiction...

194
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,708
You've seen what you
wanted to see, that's all.

195
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:15,250
Keep on with this idea
that you've somehow

196
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,250
discovered one and I'm walking.

197
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:22,083
Why do you insist on denying
the evidence of your own senses?

198
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm not.

199
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,833
Hah! But of course...!

200
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:28,083
Some sort of trauma...
I see it... Clearly...

201
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:30,875
You were struck by a bolt of
noonday lightning on the plains

202
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:32,625
of Arkansas at age five,
left to fend for--

203
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:33,958
Shut up.

204
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,375
Then what?

205
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:38,958
Theoretical limitations,
that's what! It's impossible.

206
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:41,333
Theories are no more
than lexical chicanery...

207
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,708
The love poetry of imbeciles...

208
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:46,166
Accept what you've
seen. Come on.

209
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,250
No.

210
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,458
You know, this
stubbornness will end--

211
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:52,333
I said no... so lay off...!

212
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:56,291
I'm not going to get lost down
the same blind alley as dad!

213
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,791
I'm sorry.
That was uncalled for.

214
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,125
No, no!

215
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:09,375
I'm quite satisfied
with the outburst

216
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:10,875
I wheedled out of you just now.

217
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,583
Well played, me!

218
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:17,666
Anyway, the point is,
your microwave is not,

219
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,416
nor will it ever be,
a time machine.

220
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,375
Yeah, yeah...

221
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:21,625
Listen, while you're here,

222
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,250
I'm sorry I made
you join the lab...

223
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:26,083
You, don't have to stay...

224
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:28,333
But I want you to know
I'm not one to hold a grudge...

225
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:30,458
Your lab designation
will remain open

226
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:32,500
in the event that you
ever change your mind...

227
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:35,916
the 004 slot will forever
and always belong to you.

228
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,041
Oh, quit trying to act all cool!

229
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:41,291
Hey! Damn it, that was
like the perfect sign-off!

230
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:44,250
It might have been, yeah; if
your laundry wasn't still here.

231
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:47,541
If anyone's leaving,
it should be me. Goodbye.

232
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,166
Ugh, what?!

233
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,291
I believe in street argot, the
phrase is "payback's a bitch."

234
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:53,791
Now you can go.

235
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,291
See you around. Never.

236
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:58,000
Hold it.

237
00:11:58,083 --> 00:11:59,791
Hey! Watch the jacket!!!

238
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:03,541
I meant to pick your
brain about the IBN 5100.

239
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:04,958
And that would be...?

240
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,958
An old PC.

241
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:08,125
What for?

242
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,125
There's that curiosity again...

243
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:14,500
You really want to know?

244
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:17,833
No...! Maybe an overview...

245
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:19,541
Hmph.

246
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:23,750
Very well... The IBN is
connected to SERN's secret plot.

247
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,125
We need the machine's
unique functionality

248
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:29,916
to decode the proprietary
programming language SERN uses

249
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,791
to mask all interdepartmental
exchanges vis-à-vis

250
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:35,125
its covert time
travel experiments.

251
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,500
Are you appropriately shocked?

252
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,666
Right... That's what I get.

253
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,208
Oh, I see... Sarcasm, huh?

254
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:46,208
Well Patter off to that veil of
ignorance you call a life, then!

255
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,125
Mark my words, Christina:

256
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:51,250
you will rue the day you
saw fit to underestimate me!

257
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,666
Where are you getting
that name from? Gah...

258
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,875
We need the machine's
unique functionality

259
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:59,000
to decode the
proprietary programming...

260
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:03,166
That's what I get for
fraternizing with know-it-alls.

261
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,083
A PC?

262
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:05,416
Yeah. A really old one...

263
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,958
and it only costs
fifty-one hundred yen...

264
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,416
Least I think so.

265
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,708
Uh. Hold on...
You don't mean...?

266
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,958
Too-too-roo! Guess what, Okarin?

267
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:20,750
I found something
out that's going to put

268
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,916
a big fat smile on your face.

269
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,500
No cell phones, big-shot.

270
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:27,041
Faris said she's totally seen
the computer you're looking for!

271
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,291
Isn't that awesome!

272
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:29,583
I said--

273
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,541
Hey!

274
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:40,583
Damn kid.

275
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:43,375
This doesn't cover your bill!

276
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:46,833
Faris, Meow-meow!
Faris, Meow-meow!

277
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:51,791
Faris, Meow-meow! Faris,
Meow-meow! Faris, Meow-meow!

278
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:54,375
Okay... The Hell...?

279
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,875
Hiya! Welcome Meow-sters!

280
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:59,625
The competition for the
Faris Cup is about to begin,

281
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,333
so I hope you've
brought your game-face!

282
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:03,083
Who here thinks they
have what it takes

283
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:06,125
to get their name
on a specialty omelet?

284
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,125
AHHHHHH! Faris, meow-meow!

285
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:12,666
Faris, meow-meow!
Faris, meow-meow!

286
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,791
Wh-What dimension
did I fall into?

287
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,958
Hey! Too-too-roo!

288
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:20,333
Mayuri...

289
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:22,083
Perhaps you can explain
what I'm witnessing here...

290
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,625
Has there been a
gravity distortion...?

291
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:25,625
Silly... It's the Faris Cup.

292
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:26,791
Huh?

293
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,791
That's when Faris
plays Rai-Net Battler

294
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,875
with anyone who
wants to step up.

295
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:33,125
Kyouma!

296
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:34,708
Have you come to challenge me?

297
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,041
You're kinda late,

298
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,291
but it's not unusual for
me to take ten at a time,

299
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:39,041
so I can squeeze
you in... Just go--

300
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:40,416
Thank you, no!

301
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,541
I've come here to lay
my hands on the IBN...

302
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,083
You will tell me where it is!

303
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:48,083
That so?... I'll be glad to
tell you if you agree to play.

304
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:50,416
Uh! Stop spouting
off nonsense...!

305
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,666
I'll have you know that nothing
less than the fate of the world

306
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,541
hangs in the balance here...!
I've no time for games--

307
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,666
The Faris Cup is for
people who want to compete;

308
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,250
everyone else must wait outside.

309
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:01,458
Is it now acceptable for a maid
to banish her young master...?

310
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:02,500
I need that PC!

311
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,583
Can't hear you.

312
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:10,958
Be warned, my dear: time
demands I not go easy on you.

313
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:13,500
Sounds like someone's
feeling confident.

314
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:14,875
C'mon. Think it through...

315
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:17,291
You do know that Faris
ranks nationally, right...?

316
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:22,458
Daru... Behold... as I take
your lady-friend here to school.

317
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:25,041
My strategy is
absolutely failsafe.

318
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,416
I'll bet it is.

319
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:33,625
Special codename...
K. B. O. O. M.!

320
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:37,791
Otherwise known
as KAH-BOOM!

321
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,541
Certainly sounds awesome...

322
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,333
You intrigue me.

323
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,250
Feign impassivity
while you can...

324
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:47,000
The moment my strategy
detonates, your national ranking

325
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:50,958
will be summarily reduced
to brick-dust and tears.

326
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,041
You're passionate...
That's good.

327
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:54,375
Remember our deal...

328
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:55,833
By engaging in battle,

329
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,458
I secure the right to
be told everything

330
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:00,166
you know about
the IBN... Agreed?

331
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,041
Kitties never lie.

332
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:03,875
Bring it!

333
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,250
Prepare to face an opponent

334
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,041
who will change
your view of the game!

335
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,875
I surrender!

336
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:11,500
Well that was a lot of build
up for a lot of nothing...

337
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,791
That was your big,
balls-out strategy?

338
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:16,208
Huh... If I didn't know better,

339
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:19,250
I'd say you intended
to be a suicide bomber...

340
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:23,291
Kaboom... K B... O...
O. M... Ooooooh...

341
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:26,083
Lamest. Anagram.
Ever. ...Oh crap...!

342
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:29,416
Now...! The intel I require
if you would please, Faris...

343
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,541
You're sure
demanding for a loser.

344
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:36,416
Lest we forget, I didn't agree
to win, I agreed to participate.

345
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,125
See... The most formidable foe

346
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:40,250
is one who cares not
a whit for the game.

347
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,416
Is that fair?

348
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,125
Well... I'd have to
look it up... but...

349
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:45,958
All's fair in love and war!
I was brilliant!

350
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:48,666
Brilliant? Dunno about that...
Cheesy, definitely.

351
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,916
Silence...! Where've
you got the IBN 5100?!

352
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,916
I don't.

353
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,291
Of course you do!

354
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,208
Dad had one around the
house when I was little,

355
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:59,666
but that was years ago...
It's long gone now.

356
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,500
Eh? Blast...! Your special move!

357
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,291
You actually used
it against me...

358
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:06,416
It's the Side-Saddling...
Question Dodge!

359
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,875
How did you know...?!
Well, kudos to you...

360
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,458
Indeed you've somehow
seen right through me...

361
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:14,041
Very well done.

362
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:18,625
Was that really all you knew?

363
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:21,291
Sorry... Last time
I laid eyes on an IBN

364
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:24,083
was at a shrine
somewhere in Akihabara.

365
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:26,250
Wait... A shrine?

366
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:29,125
"Kurisu. Good to hear from you
all the way over there in Japan.

367
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,708
Hope you're enjoying yourself.

368
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:33,458
Posed your question to the
professor and he said that,

369
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:36,291
yes, the IBN 5100
is indeed able to work

370
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:39,750
with special programming
languages that antedate Basic."

371
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:42,416
He was right?

372
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:52,833
Huh. A PC... I'd have
to run it by my father.

373
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:54,458
It's an IBN 5100.

374
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,041
He may not recognize the name,

375
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:57,708
but if he let's me have
a gander at it I'll know.

376
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:59,791
Okay. I'll ask him.

377
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:02,541
It's all on you now.
Code words, please.

378
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:05,500
Uh, El Psy Congress...?

379
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:07,500
It's Congroo!

380
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,625
Go ahead.

381
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:13,041
It's me.

382
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,125
Me who...?

383
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:15,916
I know a lot of
people by that name...

384
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,166
Though I have to say...

385
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,666
You sound like someone
I once knew in Paris.

386
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,125
You're like the most impossible
human being I've ever met.

387
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:23,291
Could it be my errant assistant?

388
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,750
When did you change
your name from Christina!

389
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,083
Will you give it a rest?!

390
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,375
There's that
ever-present attitude.

391
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:30,958
You bring it out of me!

392
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:33,000
Hmph. What do you want?

393
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:34,583
Where are you?

394
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:35,833
Why would you want to know?

395
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,375
No reason.

396
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:40,708
En route to Yanabayashi Shrine,
if you're so disinterested--

397
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:45,875
Oh, a hang up.
Very classy. Harassment!

398
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,250
What was that call all about?

399
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,458
I wanted to know where you were.

400
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:52,541
I don't remember
asking you to show up.

401
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:55,125
Well, That's understandable,
since you didn't.

402
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,000
Sorry to keep you
waiting for so long.

403
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:59,666
Ah. Did you talk to him?

404
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,083
Yeah... And you're not
going to believe this,

405
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:03,416
but the one we've
got lying around

406
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,375
just happens to be the
model you're looking for.

407
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:06,875
It is?!

408
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:10,333
Hold on, are you...? You're
talking about an IBN 5100?!

409
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:13,250
Uh-huh... Um...
Who's your new friend?

410
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,250
Assistant...
So, where's it stashed?

411
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:18,583
Uh... Hey! Don't just blow
me off! Introduce us...!

412
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:21,541
I think you can do a little
better than "assistant."

413
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,250
We're not here for
an ice cream social,

414
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,041
and you're lucky
I deign to call you that.

415
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:26,916
You chauvinistic son of a...

416
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,166
Fine. Whatever makes you happy.

417
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,083
This is Makise Kurisu.
My assistant.

418
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:34,416
Good... But, for the record,
I'm not his assistant...

419
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,666
So... what was your name?

420
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,166
Ruka Urushibara. Hello.

421
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,333
How old are you?

422
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,500
I'm actually turning
seventeen this year.

423
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:42,916
One year younger than me...

424
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,416
What...? I don't believe that...

425
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,333
You look so... I don't know,
put together... I'm jealous.

426
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:50,708
Oh, please...
You're way prettier.

427
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:54,166
Um... I, uh...
I'll go get dad...

428
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,916
That... was hilarious.

429
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,625
Did I say something wrong?

430
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,333
Wow.

431
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,791
I'm having a hard time believing
this day's actually come.

432
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:07,000
Uh, why is that exactly?

433
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,250
Well, you see...

434
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,416
The person who sort of
donated this thing to us

435
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,416
made a point of saying
that someday a young man

436
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,708
in dire need of
it would turn up.

437
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:17,416
Til then we were just
supposed to look after it...

438
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,916
I guess it had to
have been something

439
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,666
like ten years ago now.

440
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,083
Makes perfect sense...

441
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:26,916
It's Fate; the tides of destiny.
Stein's Gate has chosen!

442
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,250
Again with that?

443
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:38,291
Wow. It really is the
right model. That's crazy.

444
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,000
This is fantastic.

445
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:42,333
Is that what you're
looking for then?

446
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:44,458
Any chance we might borrow it?

447
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:45,958
I don't see why not.

448
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:49,166
I'm in your debt, good sir!
Lift with your knees.

449
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,208
Uh-uh.

450
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,000
Damn it, Christina,
earn your keep!

451
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:55,166
Stop calling me that!

452
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,416
Why don't I get you a cart...

453
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,000
I wouldn't dream of imposing...

454
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:01,458
You've done quite enough...
You should be ashamed!

455
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:02,791
How dare you
put the man out?!

456
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,250
 Oh, please...!

457
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:06,583
Do you even listen
to yourself talk...?!

458
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,083
You're a loon!

459
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,958
Can't have too
many friends, right?

460
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:13,416
I hope my Ruka here
takes a page from you two.

461
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,541
Yeah.

462
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:17,958
Wait here.
It won't take a second.

463
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:21,375
Your dad's a sweet guy.

464
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,208
 You really think so?

465
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:27,541
I'm not going to get lost down
the same blind alley as dad!

466
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:30,833
Excuse me?

467
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,833
Nothing.

468
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,875
Sorry... It, uh...

469
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:37,333
Looks like the cart's
seen better days.

470
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,500
Things you don't
think you'll be doing

471
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:42,875
when you wake
up in the morning...

472
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:46,166
Stop whining and
put your back into it.

473
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:51,166
Hey...

474
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:51,791
Come on.

475
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,083
Never mind then!

476
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:54,666
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

477
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,416
Kindly refrain from taking
your frustrations out

478
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,708
on my lumbar, please!

479
00:21:57,791 --> 00:21:58,958
Hang on! How is it that

480
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:01,125
I'm the one who has
to schlep backwards?!

481
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:02,541
Because that's the
direction you're facing.

482
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:06,250
I can't be facing
backward, genius.

483
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:07,875
Sure you can! I believe in you!

484
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:09,458
Appreciate the encouragement,

485
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:12,833
but I really think we need to be
moving sideways... Scratch that!

486
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,375
I know we need to

487
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,833
'cause I'm about to drop this
thing on your freaking toes!
