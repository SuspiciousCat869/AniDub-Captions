1
00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:19,083
After the train... I leapt over,
and over, and over, and over...

2
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:23,041
So many times that
it's all a blur now.

3
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:29,375
But... however hard I tried...

4
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:33,833
Mayuri would always die...

5
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:36,916
Right in front of me.

6
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:51,416
When Moeka and her
thugs didn't attack...

7
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:55,041
it was as if fate
stepped in for them...

8
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:58,541
Like the whole world
wanted Mayuri dead...

9
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:02,166
And nothing I did
could change its mind.

10
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:11,083
What's the hold-up?!
This is ridiculous!

11
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:13,000
Train lines have shut down.

12
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:14,500
Can't you cut through
an alley or something?!

13
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:15,625
Come on, man!

14
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:18,458
That's not really
an option... Sorry.

15
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:20,458
Oh no. I just wound you!

16
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:24,291
Don't tell me you're broken.
So not fair...

17
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:25,375
I've taken extra good care--

18
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:27,416
Not again... Please.

19
00:01:35,708 --> 00:01:37,541
Mayuri!

20
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:44,833
Shiina Mayuri is
confirmed dead...

21
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:48,916
HOE-oh-een-- Okabe Rintarou,
rather, has fled the scene.

22
00:01:56,708 --> 00:02:00,166
No matter what I do,
no matter what I try...

23
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:05,250
she keeps on dying... I don't
understand. What is this?

24
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:12,000
Is this the choice of
Stein's...? No. No it's not...

25
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:14,375
Get out of your damn
head, Okabe...

26
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:16,541
None of that crap is real...

27
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:20,250
Not the Organization. Not
Stein's Gate... None of it.

28
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:24,541
You're an idiot!

29
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:03,416
What's the deal...?
Explain it to me!

30
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,125
Dude, I just hit
a story branch.

31
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:06,833
The least you could do as
a man is let me save it!

32
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:07,916
Look, I'll do it for you...

33
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,166
Just get the hell out of town

34
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,708
before you don't have
that option anymore...!

35
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:11,416
I'll explain later.

36
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,833
What's going on?

37
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:44,708
It doesn't matter...
She's already left.

38
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:49,458
It's the same... Every
time I try to save her...

39
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,708
Every time...

40
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:58,458
Not even the texts
change... Wait...

41
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:02,750
"Shining Finger...

42
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:05,791
There's something about the
time machine you should know...

43
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:08,583
I need to speak with you alone.

44
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:25,083
Don't move... Hands in the air.

45
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,041
Who the hell are
you working for?!

46
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,750
I just... work for Arc Rewrite.

47
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,375
Don't play games with me!

48
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:47,958
I know you and your
pals are planning

49
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:50,666
to bust into our lab tonight
and try to abduct us, okay?

50
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,708
How...?

51
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:55,083
Because I'm from
the God damn future.

52
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,708
Who are you...? Answer me!

53
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:58,916
Can I text it...?

54
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Screw that...!
Tell me to my face...!

55
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,875
Are you people
working for SERN?!

56
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:03,958
We're Rounders.

57
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:05,125
You're what?

58
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:08,250
Our mission is to
retrieve the IBN 5100.

59
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,416
Haven't you psychos
already made off with it?!

60
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,375
What?

61
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:12,500
Do I look stupid...?!

62
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,875
It's been missing
since your D-mail!

63
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,750
That's right...

64
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,375
When the world-line shifted,

65
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:22,500
Moeka lost all memory of
sending that text, didn't she?

66
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:23,750
This isn't making any sense...

67
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,500
Why raid the lab
in the first place?

68
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,583
The IBN's not
even friggin' there!

69
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:28,125
I...

70
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:29,833
Answer me!

71
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:32,291
Do you really have to ask?

72
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:33,750
Three things...

73
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:38,500
First off: you have access
to knowledge you shouldn't.

74
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:42,666
Secondly... You've
created a time machine.

75
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:49,333
Last but not least: you
intended to go public with it.

76
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:54,333
You knew all of that...?

77
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:57,208
How long have your overlords
at SERN been on to us?!

78
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:01,375
FB is the only authority
I'll ever answer to.

79
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:04,291
And that's what...?
Like a splinter cell--

80
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:11,625
FB... is my... my everything...

81
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,291
Where am I?

82
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,375
Don't move.

83
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,833
Are you or are
you not John Titor?

84
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:25,083
That's the only
explanation that fits.

85
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,541
No!

86
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,125
Oh god...

87
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,625
Bomb threat
worked like a charm.

88
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:42,875
Trains'll be stalled for a
while... We're good to go.

89
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:48,416
Secure Makise Kurisu
and Hashida Itaru...

90
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,250
Everyone else is expendable.

91
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:51,750
No!

92
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:55,166
Wait! Don't do this...!

93
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,000
I'll give you whatever
the hell you ask for,

94
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,791
just don't kill Mayuri!

95
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:02,250
Look, I'm sorry...!

96
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,083
I didn't know what I was doing!

97
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:07,291
Who'd believe a nut like
me about SERN anyway?!

98
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,291
Take the damn time machine,
I don't care...!

99
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:11,416
I won't tell a living soul
about this, I swear to god!

100
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,208
Commence operation.

101
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,333
I'm begging you not to
go through with this...!

102
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:18,875
I'm just a nobody whose
curiosity got the better of him!

103
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,541
Nothing was ever
going to come of it!

104
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:24,375
Nothing ever does...
Please don't kill my friend...!

105
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,291
Too late.

106
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,791
Mayuri...

107
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:36,875
Mayuri!!

108
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,041
Shut the hell up!

109
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,666
Mayuri!

110
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,250
No...

111
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:06,875
What's with you...?

112
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,500
Earth to Okabe.

113
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,583
Not again.

114
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:19,083
No... I can't take it anymore!

115
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,916
Okabe, no!

116
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,583
Dude...

117
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:26,500
Calm down; we agreed
not to do it...

118
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:31,041
There's no point in breaking
the damn thing, alright?

119
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:32,375
There you go...

120
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:36,208
We've got a party to plan...
Let's focus on that.

121
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:37,833
Party--

122
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:41,166
Hey, wait for--!

123
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,208
Clackety-clack...! Look,
Mommy--it's the bullet train!

124
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:55,250
Ah, Oka-- um, I mean Kyouma...

125
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,125
Have you seen Mayuri?

126
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:00,958
Oh, she headed out
a little while ago...

127
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:02,166
I know.

128
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,125
She came here to invite
you to the party tonight...

129
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,875
As we speak she's stopping
off at her friend's place

130
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:09,208
to fix a hem en route
back to the lab...

131
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:12,625
I know. I know everything!

132
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:25,375
I'm sorry, I don't
know what to say.

133
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:29,708
I know everything...
And I'm powerless.

134
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,416
Do I want to know
what you're doing here?

135
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:42,375
Kurisu...

136
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:45,041
Something must be wrong for
you to use my actual name...

137
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:49,500
What happened, then...?
Or... What's going to happen?

138
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:55,458
Uh-huh. You
time-leapt, didn't you?

139
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:58,208
It's... It's all my fault...

140
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,500
What is?

141
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:03,791
From start to
finish it's my fault...

142
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:07,041
I'm the one who told
Daru to hack into SERN...

143
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,958
I'm the one whose
stupid idea it was

144
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:11,000
to build a time
machine to begin with;

145
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,083
and the one who brought
Moeka into our lives...

146
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:16,291
I'm the reason...
that Mayuri...

147
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:24,708
Well, I won't argue that
you aren't reckless...

148
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:28,125
Fact of the matter is we have
no idea how dangerous leaping

149
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:29,541
might be to you physically.

150
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,708
For all we know, do it enough
and you could possibly

151
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,666
leap yourself right out
of existence altogether.

152
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,000
Humans beings are
time haunted...

153
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,916
That's what Heidegger
thought, isn't it?

154
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,458
Oh, you've read him...?

155
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:42,250
Funny, I was just thinking about
that passage earlier today.

156
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:45,708
You were about two seconds
away from quoting it to me.

157
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,500
Okay. Not gonna lie.
Kind of creepy.

158
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,625
It's like you're rooting
through my frontal lobes...

159
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,791
Note to self:
time-leaping side effects

160
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:55,833
include the ability
to freak people out.

161
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:58,291
What am I going to do?

162
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:00,625
When exactly does
the lab get attacked?

163
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,916
Just after seven thirty.

164
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,166
I have a rough idea
why Mayuri keeps dying.

165
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,666
Several ideas, actually...

166
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:11,791
But sitting here brooding about
them isn't going to do anything.

167
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,041
Come on.

168
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,791
I am not about to let
a friend get killed...

169
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:18,125
You and I have work to do.

170
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:20,208
I'm so sorry.

171
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:21,708
Stop apologizing...

172
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:25,416
I'm in this mess with you
by choice... I'm one of you...

173
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:27,708
Perk up...!

174
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,125
You're supposedly a
world-class mad scientist...!

175
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,750
One bent on giving the powers

176
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:34,708
that be a run for
their money, right?

177
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,291
"Of course you are!"

178
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,500
Shut up.

179
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:02,208
Okay, I've set it for
about five hours ago...

180
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,166
Around the time we put
the finishing touches

181
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,375
on the time-leap machine.

182
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:07,625
Any earlier than that,

183
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:10,458
and we run the risk of
it not being completed.

184
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,791
You have to get everyone
to leave once it's finished

185
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,750
and re-tell me everything
you told me earlier,

186
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:21,916
even though it might be
difficult for me to take, okay.

187
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,041
Wear me down and I'm bound
to believe you eventually.

188
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,625
You sure about that?

189
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:29,791
Hey, I know precisely how much
crazy I can swallow at one time.

190
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,708
Think about it: I'm the
one who designed the machine

191
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:35,458
so I'll trust that it works...
Just play to my ego.

192
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:37,166
So, your willingness
to believe me

193
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,708
is proportional to
your narcissism...

194
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:40,333
Naturally...

195
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,250
I'm proud of the fact that I'm
a kickass research scientist...

196
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:45,958
Tell me I'm good at applied
science and you're in.

197
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,291
Just to be on the
safe side, though,

198
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:49,750
we should give you
a trigger phrase.

199
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:54,208
When you see me, tell me
I've been craving my own fork.

200
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:57,291
Like Personalized...?
That's kind of an odd thing...

201
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,791
Why not? I already have a
spoon waiting to go with it...

202
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:04,625
Hey, stay on task! My motives
are immaterial! Are you ready?

203
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:07,083
Uh... Yeah, okay.

204
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:11,083
I won't remember you
used my actual name...

205
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:13,083
Kind of a shame, really.

206
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:15,875
Might go a long way
toward endearing you to me.

207
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:29,375
Hey, hold this a second for me,
will you? Like that, yeah?

208
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:30,375
Like this?

209
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,458
Yep-yep... Nice
and stretched out.

210
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,750
Try to think like
you're a clothes-line.

211
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,125
Aw, Mayuri...
What a pretty ribbon.

212
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:41,541
I know! Oh! Hey, you should
totally try this one on...!

213
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:45,083
It's okay, I have other
outfits I can compete in.

214
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,708
It is kind of cute...

215
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:48,333
Got the cosplay bug?

216
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:50,750
Please. Don't even go there...

217
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:53,541
Like I'd ever traipse
around in public wearing...

218
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,083
That's right...

219
00:14:57,166 --> 00:15:00,541
Five hours back lands me here
right before Mayuri leaves...

220
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,208
The time-leaper
is done moments

221
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:05,416
after she puts the
final stitch in her outfit.

222
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,916
Finished!

223
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,416
Yay...! Mayushii takes
the gold! I beat you...

224
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,375
Oh dear... This was a race...?

225
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:16,041
You cleaned our
clock then, didn't you?

226
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:19,333
But we're not far behind...
Matter of fact, we're done...

227
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:21,333
We're not going through with it!

228
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:27,125
Crap! Too sudden!

229
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:28,125
What are you talking about?

230
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,000
I mean, it's clear

231
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,375
that we're all completely
and utterly exhausted...

232
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:33,750
What we need is rest...

233
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:36,250
All further experimentation
is called off for today.

234
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:40,375
One beef bowl, please.

235
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:41,250
Coming up.

236
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:42,500
Explain why here?

237
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:43,833
Well it wasn't by design.

238
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:46,041
I didn't get your message
until after I'd ordered.

239
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,333
Just doesn't strike me

240
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:48,750
as the sort of place
that you would patronize.

241
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,875
I just found it; it's not
like I'm a regular yet...

242
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:53,708
Mayuri was the one who
recommended it... Ugh...

243
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,333
What'd you want to
talk to me about...?

244
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:58,291
First you send us all packing
for the day with no explanation,

245
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,541
then I get one of
your cryptic texts...

246
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:03,583
Listen to me.

247
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:06,250
I've come from approximately
five hours in the future.

248
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:09,875
You what...? Is that the
first half of a pickup line?

249
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:12,083
Damn it all, you told me
you'd know the precise amount

250
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:13,708
of crazy you'd be
willing to swallow!

251
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,625
I'm approaching this the
way you instructed me to!

252
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,541
Okay then, let me
stop you right there.

253
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:20,166
In the short time we've known
each other, have I ever once

254
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,625
struck you as someone inclined
to swallow any amount of crazy?

255
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:23,666
That's what I thought...!

256
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,541
But... Look,
think of it this way,

257
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,500
that I'm here at all is a
testament to your ingenuity!

258
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,375
Doesn't that entice belief?

259
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:30,666
You are certifiable...

260
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,333
Ever think you
missed your calling

261
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:34,541
as a schizoid case study?

262
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,916
Easy does it.
Mustn't slug her...

263
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,250
Right now what you crave
more than anything...

264
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,791
Is a monogrammed fork.

265
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:45,916
Convinced?

266
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,333
Where the hell is
that coming from...?

267
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:49,916
I say that five hours from now?

268
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,416
You have a personalized spoon
to go with it, so why not?

269
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,416
Damn it! Future me is in for
such a royal ass kicking...!

270
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,625
Surely this is sufficient

271
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:00,583
to persuade you
I'm telling the truth...

272
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:03,208
Okay... So you're
telling me a time machine

273
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:06,500
I constructed...
works as designed...

274
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,291
Here's your beef bowl, hon.

275
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,958
One thing is clear: if you've
got your facts straight,

276
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:16,166
this is serious stuff
we're dealing with.

277
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,666
Yeah.

278
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,750
Maybe our trouble is we're
focused too tightly on Mayuri...

279
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,375
Why not shift to Moeka...?

280
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,041
Couldn't she and the
Rounders be dealt

281
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,416
with before they
become an issue?

282
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,583
I've tried that...

283
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,791
The same basic scenario
played itself out

284
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:30,000
regardless of what I did.

285
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:33,000
Damn.

286
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,875
Still... Every
natural phenomenon,

287
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:37,250
however immutable it might
appear to be on the surface,

288
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,250
is subject to change.

289
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,916
We have to think in terms
of cause and effect.

290
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,416
Now usually cause of death
is directly attributable

291
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,916
to something: illness,
accident, whatever.

292
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,541
But really these are
just incidental details;

293
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:52,083
local manifestations
of a broader principle.

294
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:55,083
In Mayuri's case, the Rounders
are the obvious culprit,

295
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,583
but they're not the prime mover.

296
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:58,708
That's something more abstract.

297
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:00,166
We can deduce as
much from the fact

298
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,791
that she dies even when
they're not involved.

299
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,458
So what's the
underlying cause?

300
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,041
I can't be sure...

301
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:08,291
I mean, it could even be that
the circumstances of her birth

302
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:11,416
somehow set her on a path which
made dying on a certain date,

303
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,625
at a certain time unavoidable.

304
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,333
You're sounding
like an astrologist...

305
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:17,000
That's fatalism and I don't
buy into it for a second.

306
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:19,333
You're right, it's absurd--
I just don't know a better

307
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:20,958
way to frame what
I'm trying to get at.

308
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,291
The point is, we're
not thinking back

309
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:24,875
far enough to expose
the real catalyst.

310
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:26,666
Indeed...

311
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:31,625
Maybe we need only think back

312
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,208
so far as to leave the
machine unfinished...

313
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:34,625
Hold on.

314
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,666
We don't know the machine
isn't just another detail.

315
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,625
But surely...

316
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:39,583
She's hit the nail on the head.

317
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,208
You know something...?
If so, please just to tell us.

318
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,583
You're right not wanting
to abandon the time machine.

319
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:48,791
Take my word for it

320
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,916
when I say this'd be
impossible without one.

321
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,458
You wouldn't have a prayer.

322
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:53,791
If you wanna save the world...

323
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:56,208
You've gotta push past
the divergence barrier...

324
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:59,125
That nagging one percent
gap between world-lines

325
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:01,083
attached to the same alpha.

326
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,625
Okay. Pay attention kiddos,
it's gonna get complicated:

327
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:08,708
The Divergence Number indicates
a given world line's latitude

328
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,291
on a continuum, so to speak.

329
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:12,666
The only way to keep
track of it is this:

330
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,291
A trusty Divergence Meter.

331
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:17,708
Nixie tubes...My hats off
to the taste of its inventor.

332
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:21,333
Funny you should say that.
This bad boy's papa is you.

333
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:22,916
Me?!

334
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,125
Your memories tend to stay put
regardless of the world-line,

335
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,500
so eventually you
developed--or will develop--

336
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,791
a gauge to keep track.

337
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:31,166
The meter records and
represents, numerically,

338
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,916
the gap between the
present world-line

339
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,458
and the one it
splintered off from.

340
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:37,333
Indispensable for the
discerning time traveler.

341
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:40,625
0.337187...

342
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,833
That's this world-line's number.

343
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:45,000
If you're havin' trouble gettin'
your head around the concept,

344
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,750
it might help to
think of world-lines

345
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:51,500
like fibers in a rope.

346
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:54,000
At first blush a rope
looks like a single thing...

347
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,000
But hone in, and it's
obviously made up

348
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:58,541
of many interlocking threads.

349
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:00,333
Now each thread is
its own thing,

350
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,125
independent of its neighbors...

351
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:04,291
but they're all moving
in the same direction.

352
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:07,250
That's why it's so strong.

353
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,791
Wait. Are you telling us
that every world-line

354
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,416
leads to Mayuri's death?

355
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,916
For now.

356
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:16,291
But all bets are off if you
can manage a big enough change

357
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:19,000
to push past the one percent
divergence barrier.

358
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,458
Something that'll derail
you off the alpha track

359
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,875
with enough force to
land you onto a beta line.

360
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:26,416
Okay. The one on
the right is yours.

361
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,833
Uh, excuse me.

362
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:30,125
I'm not quite athletic
enough to shimmy up a rope...

363
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:34,041
Ugh. Fine then. Wait here...
I'll be back in a second.

364
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,291
What is she?

365
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:48,625
Professional shimmy-er,
perhaps...? I dunno.

366
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:55,916
The coast is clear... Hop to.

367
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:59,166
Alpha and beta world-lines
play out differently,

368
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,708
so they lead to
different futures.

369
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:03,791
Very different futures,
most of the time.

370
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:05,791
Normally it's impossible
to travel between them.

371
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,916
You can D-mail or
leap all you want;

372
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,125
it's not going to
alter things enough

373
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:11,666
to break you away
from the alpha line.

374
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,166
That said, though...

375
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,291
There are relatively fixed
points in any line where events

376
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,416
of great enough significance
occur to break off

377
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,375
toward a beta, depending on
the choices that are made.

378
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:22,583
Recent examples of what
I'm talking about are,

379
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:23,958
like, let's say the Gulf War...

380
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:27,000
The Y2K panic from the
turn of the last century...

381
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:28,916
And, it should
go without saying,

382
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,166
the invention of
the time machine.

383
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:37,208
Is that...?

384
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:39,708
Points like that are the
only elbow room we've got;

385
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:43,083
the only way to "shimmy"
from an alpha to a beta.

386
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:45,500
Yes, but the question is how to
take advantage of such points?

387
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,125
Hold on.

388
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:48,458
First things first...

389
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,875
Don't you think it's time
to tell us who you are?

390
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:02,125
Is this...?

391
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:03,625
You know what it is.

392
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,666
I'm a time traveler;
specifically from the year 2036.

393
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,125
Dear god...

394
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:13,041
We've met online a few
times, you and me...

395
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:15,041
I post as John Titor.
