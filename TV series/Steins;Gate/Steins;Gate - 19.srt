1
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:27,208
Hurry up and cook, noodles!

2
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:34,458
I had fun at Comima this --

3
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:36,333
You're gonna go back
tomorrow, aren't you?

4
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,208
Huh...?

5
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:38,291
Uh... yeah...

6
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,416
And, you'll be coming
back around now?

7
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,791
I think so.

8
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:46,083
Ooh! You should
come with me, Kurisu!

9
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,250
Uh, I dunno. Big crowds
really aren't my thing...

10
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:50,875
But tomorrow's the second day,
so it shouldn't be too bad...!

11
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:53,500
Hey, Okarin!
Wanna come... with...?

12
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:01,250
You--roof. Now!

13
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,166
What the hell's
wrong with you?!

14
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,666
Mayuri's been trying to cheer
you up ever since you got back!

15
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,375
Could you at least pretend
not to be a jackass?

16
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,916
I'm sorry. It's just...
the waiting...

17
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,500
God, it's killing me...!

18
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,208
What...?

19
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:20,416
She isn't dead...

20
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,083
But it's a stay of
execution! Nothing more!

21
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,708
I've told you this...
over and over again.

22
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:33,833
What do you mean?

23
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,958
Our D-mails have come at a cost.

24
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,958
Mayuri's going to
die tomorrow...?!

25
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:54,416
Short of a miracle... yes...

26
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:59,333
It used to be Friday the 13th...
That night. Every time...

27
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:05,041
But each D-mail I undo
pushes it back a day.

28
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:07,875
That's why...
I have to go with her.

29
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:10,375
You've thought of
a way to save her.

30
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:15,333
I'm going... to watch her die.

31
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:16,500
Why?!

32
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:17,875
It's the only way
I can be sure how long

33
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:21,333
Mayuri's got on this
world-line... and once I am...

34
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:24,083
I'll leap back
once last time.

35
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:26,208
And I'll stop it.

36
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:32,625
So, the next D-mail...

37
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:36,041
It was from this
Kiryuu Moeka girl, right?

38
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,833
Indeed... And
I know what she wrote.

39
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:41,208
She cautioned her past
self against purchasing

40
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:43,041
a new cell phone.

41
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,541
It'll only work if I
send her a new message

42
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,375
from that phone, though.

43
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,666
Then you had better
start looking for her.

44
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,500
I'll go with Mayuri to Comima.

45
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:55,583
What?!

46
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:58,666
Maybe we'll get
lucky and she won't...

47
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,666
I'll be with her and that's
gotta count for something!

48
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,250
And what if it doesn't...?!

49
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,583
If I don't find Moeka tomorrow,
are you ready to watch her die?!

50
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,291
No! And neither are you!

51
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:11,666
Okabe... you don't have
to bottle this stuff up...

52
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,041
From this moment on,

53
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:16,916
you and me are in this
thing together, okay?

54
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,750
You're right...
You've always been right.

55
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,208
Don't you forget it...

56
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,458
'Cause no matter how
many world-lines you jump,

57
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:29,125
that's never gonna change...
I've got your back.

58
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,041
"At Ariake now...

59
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:44,250
Huge crowd here, worse than
I imagined... Save me..."

60
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:50,958
"No reply from Moeka, but
I found out where she works."

61
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:54,166
"I'll see what
they can tell me..."

62
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,125
"Roger. Don't do
anything crazy."

63
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,375
Moeka, you said...?

64
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:05,083
If she's the girl I'm thinking
of, she lasted a day or two

65
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,708
and then flaked out.
Her address...?

66
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:10,583
Yeah, I have it...
but why should you?

67
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:28,000
Affirmative.

68
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,666
Excuse me...!

69
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,041
You're saying she...
killed herself...?!

70
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:36,416
Moeka... you're sure
that was her name...!

71
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,041
Yes, sir.

72
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:38,083
When did she die?!

73
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:39,500
Late last night, more or less.

74
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:42,541
Body was taken to
Third Chiyoda Hospital.

75
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:43,708
Having trouble with
the next of kin, though.

76
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:45,416
I'm too late...

77
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,583
You feeling all right...?

78
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:53,208
Suicide...

79
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,750
Think...!

80
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,875
Maybe it was murder...

81
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:05,125
One of her fellow
rounders... But why...?

82
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:10,166
Damn it, man--it
doesn't matter...!

83
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,791
Mayuri... is doomed...

84
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,208
Wait. Another time leap...!

85
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,916
If I can get to Moeka
before she dies last night...!

86
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,083
Go ahead.

87
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:43,125
She... oh god, Okabe...
She... she's dead...

88
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:44,333
Mayuri's dead...!

89
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:48,416
Time of death... 7:52 p.m...

90
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,750
I should have been with her.

91
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,375
What the hell...!
Okabe, you jerk!

92
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:58,041
Did you eat this pudding?!

93
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,208
Don't look at me like that...!

94
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:01,583
I wrote "Makise,"
on here plain as day!

95
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,708
Are you even listening to me?!

96
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:09,166
"I've got your back...
don't you forget it."

97
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:12,500
You were right... I can't
do it alone... Kurisu.

98
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:15,500
Huh...? did you just...
call me by name?

99
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:18,250
Does the name "Kiryuu Moeka"
mean anything to you?

100
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,208
How come... Should it?

101
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,958
Finding her... is now a
matter of life-or-death.

102
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,125
What do you mean...? 

103
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:15,750
FB...FB... Write me
back... Please...FB...

104
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:18,625
Did I do something wrong...?

105
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:24,125
Why won't you respond...?
Please... What did I do?

106
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,333
FB...

107
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,208
You and I need to chat.

108
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:31,125
Everything you
asked for, I did...

109
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:31,916
All of it...

110
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,083
Moeka... Look at me...!

111
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:36,500
I need you to
give me new orders, FB...!

112
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:39,125
Forget the damn phone...! Hey!

113
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,333
...FB...

114
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:48,000
...FB... FB... FB...
FB... FB...FB... FB...

115
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:49,208
No...!

116
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:53,333
No, it's mine!

117
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,625
Let go...! It's... mine!

118
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,500
I'm sorry...

119
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:15,875
But you started this...
when you killed my friend!

120
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:28,958
Give it back...!

121
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:33,500
Give it back! Give it back!
Give it back! Give it back!

122
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:35,041
Give it back...!

123
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,583
Hey, I'm here!
You have her phone?!

124
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,791
Just pried it away from her!
Everything ready on your end?

125
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:41,375
We'll all set!
Wow, is that her?!

126
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:42,916
Let her carry on!
Where's Mayuri!?

127
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,291
Is she down there?!

128
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,833
Yeah! And the TV is
definitely on! I can hear it!

129
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:48,041
Texting now...!

130
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Kurisu!

131
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,041
Fire it up--now!

132
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,125
I'm on it!

133
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:55,833
Give it back!

134
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:58,666
This is it... The last one.

135
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:02,375
One message left to go...
and she lives...!

136
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:22,583
Give it back...!
Give it back...!

137
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:23,541
Gimme back my phone...

138
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:26,166
Hold on... Why am I still here?

139
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,125
Problem!

140
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:27,833
It didn't work?!

141
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:28,875
Are you sure it was on?!

142
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,333
Did it light up like before?!

143
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:32,583
There was arcing all over
the place...! What happened?

144
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:34,625
My whole Reading Steiner
thing never kicked in!

145
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,000
Huh?!

146
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,625
I'm still on the same
world-line as a moment ago.

147
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:40,333
Why'd it fail?

148
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,083
Give it back!

149
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:51,416
Aw, come on! You share this
building with other people ...!

150
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,166
Give it back!

151
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,625
Why the hell isn't it working?!

152
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:58,083
The process isn't exact--
we just send new texts,

153
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,416
we don't know how
they're received...!

154
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,541
What if your message just
wasn't convincing enough

155
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,208
to keep her from
buying that new phone?!

156
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:05,583
How'm I supposed
to convince her?!

157
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:15,125
You're right.
It's the same one...!

158
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:18,083
It's the same phone she messaged
her past self not to buy!

159
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:19,250
That's gotta be it, then!

160
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:21,166
We just need to
figure out a better text!

161
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:24,500
"I got this cell phone four
days ago, but I don't like it...

162
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:27,875
So I want to tell the
past me not to buy it."

163
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:30,916
What if the message she showed
us wasn't the one that she sent?

164
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,875
Are you telling me we have no
idea what she wrote to herself?!

165
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:35,708
Whatever she wrote, there
should still be a copy...!

166
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:38,041
I'm checking for it now!

167
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:44,375
Give it back...! Give it back! 

168
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:47,208
What's going on,
Okabe...?! Talk to me!

169
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:48,625
I'll call you right back!

170
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:07,625
Enough with the shouting! Give
it a rest, for cryin' out loud!

171
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:09,375
Give it to me!

172
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,333
Gimmie back my phoooone!

173
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:22,000
Gimmie the phone! It's mine!

174
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:35,125
Calm... down...!

175
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:37,125
Guess I better check it out...

176
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,875
I... 

177
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:45,166
The hell're you--?

178
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:52,041
You should be ashamed, goin'
at it with the door wide open...

179
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,250
The hell is wrong with people?

180
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:16,833
What can I do...?

181
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:21,000
What can I do...
to make you give it back?

182
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:24,916
Do you remember sending
yourself a D-mail...?

183
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,333
What...? I don't... I...

184
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:29,916
You, got a message...

185
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,541
A very strange one, two weeks
ago... From your future self.

186
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,166
How'd you know...?

187
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,500
Tell me what it said...

188
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:40,291
and you get your phone back...!

189
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:42,291
Must've been something
important, right...?!

190
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:45,666
The IBN 5100, perhaps...

191
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,041
a meet-up with your
gun-toting thugs?!

192
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,250
Tell me what it said!

193
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:50,541
I know it's gotta be
something like that--

194
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,000
it's written on your damn face!

195
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:55,625
I'll break it--I
swear to god I will!

196
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:56,750
I'll never betray them.

197
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:57,833
 "Them" who?!

198
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,208
FB, Moeka?

199
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:06,500
My life... is empty
without FB...

200
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:11,250
FB gives me
guidance... purpose...

201
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:14,375
"Purpose"?! So FB's
calling the shots...?!

202
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,166
You're not going to tell me...

203
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,458
Because you're such a
loyal little foot-soldier...

204
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:23,416
Even now... when it's obvious
that your precious FB

205
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,791
doesn't give a good
goddamn about you!

206
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:29,541
You've been written off!
FB has abandoned you!

207
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:32,250
I'm not gonna
fall for your lies...!

208
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,833
But they don't write
back, do they...?!

209
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:35,583
And you know why
that's happening......?!

210
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:36,875
They don't need you anymore!

211
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:37,916
No!

212
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,583
FB would never
just throw me away!

213
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:53,875
I was lost... FB...
rescued me...

214
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:57,333
"Rescued you?"...
They condemned you...!

215
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:21,250
Ask me why I would say something
like that... Go ahead...!

216
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:26,375
FB is like...
is like a mother to me...

217
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,750
What sort of work
would I have to do?

218
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,750
I possess a
text-based time machine...

219
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:33,666
You messaged yourself
from the future with it!

220
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,541
Even work I could do?

221
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:39,833
FB... made me
feel so needed...

222
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:43,916
I've never had a job before.
I don't have any skills, either.

223
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,541
You wanna know how your
FB fairy-tale ends...?!

224
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:01,125
'Course you do...!

225
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:02,583
You ready...?

226
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:09,500
You die... Four days from now,
you take your own life.

227
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,583
Huh...?

228
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:14,041
You sit here waiting for
a text that never comes...

229
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:17,000
and then you kill yourself,
here in the dark!

230
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:17,875
That's a lie.

231
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,375
You know in your heart

232
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:22,041
that you are never going to
hear from FB again, Moeka...

233
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,875
It's torture, isn't it...?
Worse than death!

234
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:26,083
Stop it...!

235
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:28,750
When's the last time
they responded...? Huh?!

236
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:32,291
Poor, patient Moeka...
abandoned yet again...!

237
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,791
You're going to die,
Moeka...! Right here...!

238
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:38,666
No...!

239
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,916
You're going to murder yourself,

240
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,458
surrounded by darkness!

241
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:42,875
No...

242
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,375
You know what your grand
reward is for killing Mayuri?!

243
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,000
You die like a stray mutt!

244
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:48,416
Forgotten until they
trip over your corpse!

245
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:48,958
FB--!

246
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,208
FB won't help!

247
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:52,375
All it would take is
a single text, right?!

248
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:54,541
But they don't care!

249
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,833
Nooooo!

250
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,375
I'm sorry...

251
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:41,500
I assume FB is a woman...

252
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:44,166
You did say before they
were like a mother to you.

253
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:47,375
I guess...

254
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,291
You guess?

255
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,666
We've never met in real life...

256
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,708
I don't ever wanna...

257
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:56,375
What's the point......?

258
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:59,000
I'm sure she would hate me...

259
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,291
You've never even
spoken on the phone

260
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:02,791
with each other
before, have you...

261
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,541
Why are you so
committed to this woman?!

262
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:08,458
She made me feel
like... I belonged...

263
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:09,666
What and that's all?

264
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:20,375
You're a fool...! So did we...!

265
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,000
Okabe?!

266
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,166
You call that "calling
me right back"?!

267
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,458
What's the matter...?
Were you worried about me?

268
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,125
No...! Maybe.

269
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:39,166
Oh. I'm sorry.

270
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,541
What'd you learn?

271
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:45,625
Wait, so... the IBN
5100 was stolen by...

272
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:46,833
Moeka, yeah.

273
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:48,875
Well, where is it right now?!

274
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,250
I wish I could tell you...

275
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:53,708
It won't matter anyway
after we undo her message.

276
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:57,416
The new one's going back
to 11 a.m. on July 31st.

277
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:08,458
It's activated!

278
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,458
This should do it...

279
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:26,500
Not again...!

280
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:27,541
What?

281
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:28,750
It didn't work!

282
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,375
So, the message is
about the right thing,

283
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,666
but the past her
didn't believe it?

284
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,916
I'll prep the Phone Wave
and you can send her another!

285
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,791
She'll have to believe one
sooner or later, right...?!

286
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,458
No...

287
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,041
There's only one person who
Moeka is going to believe.

288
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:48,375
If she gets a D-mail from
that particular number...

289
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:49,708
she'll obey in a heartbeat.

290
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,375
Who is it...?!

291
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,208
I'm going out to find FB.

292
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:05,208
I don't suppose that
you have any leads.

293
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:07,208
Not that you would
tell me, anyway.

294
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:08,708
When you were yelling...

295
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:12,791
you told me that I killed
somebody... Will that happen?

296
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:17,208
Yes... Would you, if FB asked?

297
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:19,208
Without question... I would. 

298
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,958
Even if you knew she was
about to throw you away?!

299
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,375
Because that is
exactly what happens...!

300
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,083
And then you cave
in under the despair!

301
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:31,166
Four days from now, you're
going to commit suicide...

302
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:34,583
Deny it all you want, but that's
what's fated to happen...!

303
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:37,208
There's no escape!

304
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:39,958
Luckily... I don't leave
things to fate anymore.

305
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:44,125
I've fought against
it far too long!

306
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:47,708
I'll keep fighting...
until Mayuri is safe!

307
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:04,166
The coin lockers...

308
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:10,666
At the Dai Building...

309
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,291
The computer is
inside one of them...
