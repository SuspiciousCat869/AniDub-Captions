1
00:00:08,166 --> 00:00:09,791
Is this...?

2
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:11,166
You know what it is.

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,708
I'm a time traveler;
specifically from the year 2036.

4
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:16,208
Dear god...

5
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:19,000
We've met online a
few times, you and me...

6
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:21,125
I post as John Titor.

7
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:00,916
By the year 2036...

8
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,875
SERN has taken complete
control of the world.

9
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:05,916
Their word is law.

10
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,958
Democracy is
nothing but a memory.

11
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:12,791
People sleepwalk through their
lives completely devoid of hope.

12
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:15,791
Opposition is treason;
treason is death.

13
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:24,375
I was a member of the
anti-SERN resistance.

14
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,250
On the run, day and night,

15
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,708
living in the hit
squads' crosshairs...

16
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,666
I realized they couldn't
be defeated in my time.

17
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:55,916
So I bet my only chip--

18
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,208
the secret time-machine
my father had left me.

19
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:25,875
That's why I'm here.
I need to prevent that future.

20
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:29,000
Then all those things John Titor
was posting online were true?

21
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,000
Yeah... Much as
I wish they weren't.

22
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,000
But SERN's a
research organization--

23
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,750
it doesn't have a standing
army or anything like that...

24
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:38,416
I tried asking Titor about
it online a bunch of times

25
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,750
and I never got
a straight answer.

26
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:40,958
Hold on...

27
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,416
So that was you posting
under the nom de web

28
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,041
"Chestnut Rice
and Kamehame-ha"?!

29
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,958
Hey, she laid her
cards out on the table...

30
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:50,916
So the least I can do
is reciprocate, right...?

31
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,583
I hid my posts in plain sight...

32
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:55,250
Attributing them all
to Hououin Kyouma--!

33
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:56,541
Yeah, we know that.

34
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,250
Once SERN builds
a time-machine,

35
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:02,916
they're the ones who're
calling all the shots...

36
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,166
With that kind of
power at their disposal,

37
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,416
it doesn't take long for
them to decide the world needs

38
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,250
to bend to their liking,
for our own good, of course.

39
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,041
And one person did
more than anyone else

40
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:15,083
to bring SERN's
machine to fruition...

41
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:19,458
"The mother of time-travel,"
they call her... Makise Kurisu.

42
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,333
Are you saying I'm
some kind of traitor...?!

43
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,125
I would never help them...!

44
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:24,916
I don't know where you
got your information,

45
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,416
but it's obviously wrong!

46
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,750
It's true in 2036.

47
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:32,208
Is that why you've always
been so hateful around me?

48
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,500
What about my
future self, then?

49
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:43,583
Later in life, you're going
to become an infamous terrorist.

50
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:44,916
A what?!

51
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,916
More like an anti-SERN
freedom-fighter, actually.

52
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,333
Oh, also... you
two should know...

53
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:55,541
By the time I leave in 2036,
both of you are dead.

54
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:00,583
Time for me to go.

55
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:01,791
Wait a sec...!

56
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,416
You can't just drop
a bombshell like that

57
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,250
and blithely sashay
back to the future!

58
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:06,750
The future's a dead-end...

59
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,708
I'm heading to an
earlier point in time...

60
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:11,666
Back to the year 1975.

61
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,541
Why nineteen seventy-five?

62
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,833
SERN is only able to
build their time-machine

63
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,000
because they get their hands
on a working version of one

64
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,958
from Akihabara and then
improve on that technology.

65
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,250
Our Phone Wave, you mean?

66
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:23,625
Mhmm.

67
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:26,750
They managed to set up a
worldwide monitoring system

68
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:29,708
to alert them to the emergence
of any viable research

69
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:31,208
in the field of time-travel.

70
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:33,791
I hate to lay this at
your doorstep, Okabe...

71
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:37,916
but that first D-mail you
sent probably caught their eye.

72
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,250
You mean the one I sent in
front of the Radio Building?

73
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,375
That's the one...

74
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:42,916
But if we can just
delete that message

75
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,291
from their system altogether

76
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:47,166
before anyone over at
SERN bothers to read it...

77
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,166
...we'll change... the future.

78
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:53,041
We'll toss life as we
know it onto a world-line

79
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:56,750
where their time-travel
ambitions never pan out!

80
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:59,750
Will making that jump
help us save Mayuri's life?!

81
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,083
We can hope.

82
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,625
Then what are we waiting for?!

83
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:04,208
Let's go back in your machine
and hack their database --!

84
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:07,708
We'll need to find an
IBN 5100 to pull that off.

85
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,333
Wait, so... is that why...?

86
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,958
My mission was to
travel back to 1975,

87
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:15,041
obtain an IBN 5100, and
make sure that it got to you...

88
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,375
That's was all.

89
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:20,208
But I let myself get distracted,

90
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:22,625
and spent too much
time looking for my dad...

91
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:25,083
I should've left
this year way earlier.

92
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:28,541
What's going on?!

93
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,250
Oh my god.

94
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:35,125
Something's broken...!

95
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:39,458
Not good...!

96
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:40,333
Do we run?!

97
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:41,666
One of us is about to...!

98
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,375
Sneak out of here as
soon as they're distracted!

99
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,416
Is someone in there...?

100
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:48,875
Who are you?!

101
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:50,041
Foolish man...!

102
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:51,625
Can you not see I'm
clearly in the midst

103
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:53,250
of a foiling an
Organization plot...?!

104
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:56,333
This'll send their ranks
tumbling like so many dominoes!

105
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,916
I recommend you forget what
you've seen here tonight...!

106
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,458
Now if you'll excuse me...!

107
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:01,083
What the hell?!

108
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,416
Get back here!

109
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:06,083
C'mon--let's go!

110
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:12,583
Hurry it up!

111
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,541
Look--I don't know what
happens later, okay?!

112
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:17,875
But right now we're on the same
side--so just trust me, dammit!

113
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,166
Okabe!

114
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,625
You're sure you weren't
followed...?! Come on, then.

115
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,291
So now what? We can't
exactly go back there...

116
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,750
I can't believe the
time machine is broken...

117
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,750
Did crashing into
the roof do it?

118
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:56,791
Hey, I didn't crash. I
miscalculated the coordinates

119
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:59,750
and... well, kind of
materialized mid-roof...

120
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,083
Semantics aside, though:

121
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:03,416
no... it wasn't broken
when I got here.

122
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,541
What happened, then?

123
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,125
Remember that
thunderstorm we had...?

124
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,166
I think that
could have done it.

125
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,250
Maybe the lightning,
or the rain...

126
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,333
Hell, probably both.

127
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,125
It's my fault.

128
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,208
If I hadn't stopped you
from leaving that night...

129
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,375
Wait--I can use the Phone Wave!

130
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:24,500
Yeah, but you can only go back

131
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:27,416
as far as 48 hours
with it, remember?

132
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,708
Right, of course--that was
more than two days ago.

133
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,708
Heya, Okarin!

134
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,041
And Kurisu and
Suzuha make three!

135
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,208
I cancelled the party tonight!

136
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:36,791
Why haven't you
both gone home?!

137
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,666
Uh, she told me she wanted to
un-cancel the party, so yeah.

138
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,166
Don't be grumpy! Look at
the tasty snacks we picked up!

139
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,541
I told you to leave for today!

140
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,791
I'm sorry, honey.
We're just dealing

141
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:49,791
with some important stuff
right now, that's all.

142
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:50,875
Can I help?

143
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,250
Just call it a day.

144
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,416
I'll pay you back for
all the snacks and stuff...

145
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,416
We'll have a party
later on--I promise you.

146
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,708
Okay, then...

147
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:02,250
But only if you promise me
that you're gonna be safe...!

148
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,250
'Cause I get all
worried about you.

149
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:07,208
We'll be all right...
You have my word.

150
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,125
Alright! See ya later, then!

151
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,583
See ya.

152
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:21,500
I hear they even
stopped the trains.

153
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:22,750
You serious?

154
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:34,833
We have got to get the
time-machine operational again.

155
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:42,541
Here's the plan...

156
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,833
Okabe jumps back
to five hours ago,

157
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:47,250
when the lab first had
time-leap functionality...

158
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:50,250
Then you jump back again
to the full 48-hour maximum,

159
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,458
to 2 p.m. on the 11th...
Everyone clear?

160
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:53,833
Sounds like that's as much time

161
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,166
as we're going to
have to work with.

162
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,958
I just hope that it
ends up being enough.

163
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:58,750
Whatever it takes to
get that time-machine up

164
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,958
and running again, that's
what we do--understood...?

165
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:04,291
I'll keep reliving those
two days 'till it works!

166
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,416
This isn't about
saving the world.

167
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,625
Not for me. Not anymore.
This is about Mayuri!

168
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:28,458
Okabe?

169
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:29,708
Something the matter?

170
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:32,041
Get the lab members
up here on the double.

171
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,000
There's something
you all need to see.

172
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:42,291
It ain't a blue box...
but it's still damn cool.

173
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,000
Can you fix it?

174
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:46,416
Hey, future-girl--what do
you know about this thing?

175
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,708
I just used it--I don't know
what's under the hood...

176
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,875
My dad's the one
who put it together.

177
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:52,833
We can't possibly
fix a time machine

178
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:54,791
from 2036 with the
current technology--

179
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,458
How will we know unless we try?!

180
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,958
Just repair it, Daru!
You have 48 hours...!

181
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,541
You're the only
one who can do it!

182
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,333
Why 48 hours?

183
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:06,666
Because... it's just
more of a challenge!

184
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,000
Look, if you can
do it in two days,

185
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,750
I'll give you whatever
you ask for, okay?

186
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:13,166
I'm in! I want a day-long date
with Faris if I pull it off!

187
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,833
Fine. I'll make that
happen somehow.

188
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:16,083
Hah...! Oh yeah, right.

189
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:18,625
I can make it
happen...! I swear!

190
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,375
You want this pretty bad.

191
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,708
Damn right I do... Now fix it.

192
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,041
Then let's earn that date!

193
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,916
Oh!

194
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,666
There's something
you gotta do.

195
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:37,500
You gotta bring us an IBN 5100
when it works again, okay?

196
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,750
Ooh! And an animation
cell of this pose, from...

197
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:43,208
the 1975 mahou series
"Radical Girl Omit-chan"!

198
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:45,208
Don't get greedy!

199
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:46,666
Want me to stay
here and help out?

200
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,875
A good idea, but no...

201
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,375
We need you to
get back to the lab

202
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,833
and finish up construction
on the time-leap machine...

203
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:53,541
That way, if we miss
our two-day deadline--

204
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:54,875
Okarin, wait...!

205
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:57,041
You're forgetting
something really important...!

206
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:59,333
We gotta help
Suzuha find her dad!

207
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:00,583
Don't worry about it, Mayuri--

208
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,125
Don't say that...!

209
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,208
I know you used the time-machine
'cause you're on a mission,

210
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,166
but you wanna see
your dad, don'tcha?

211
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,875
You've never even met him!

212
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:12,583
I really wanna make it happen
for you if I possibly can!

213
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,791
You know your father's
online handle, don't you?

214
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:19,666
That was just a code-name...
I don't know his real one.

215
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,041
So where did you get Amane?

216
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:22,333
Got it from my mom...

217
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:25,083
All I've got to go on
is this one clue...

218
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,208
a pin he used to wear.

219
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,708
Okay, I remember
you saying your dad

220
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:35,750
was somewhere in Akihabara
this year... Never fear!

221
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:38,666
'Cause Detective Mayuri
always gets her man!

222
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:43,875
Find him or not...
She's a good egg.

223
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,291
What's the verdict?

224
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,458
Well, I could be talking
outta my butt here...

225
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:03,041
but based on what I've been
able to scope out so far,

226
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:06,625
the insides remind me a lot of
how the Phone Wave operates.

227
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:09,833
So then, you might be able to
get it working again after all?!

228
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,666
I've been wondering
'bout your dad, y'know...

229
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,791
if maybe he's
somebody close to us.

230
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,750
I mean, he had enough
info on us to know where

231
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:20,750
we were and what we were up
to when it all went down...

232
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:24,208
Maybe... He didn't tell
me anything in-person...

233
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:27,250
All I have is the information
he left for me in his will...

234
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:31,000
My dad and I never actually
met though, so there's that.

235
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,291
He was conducting his
own time-travel research,

236
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:35,500
apart from whatever it
was SERN was up to...

237
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:38,208
trying to undo some
of what they'd done.

238
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:41,583
Pulling this off is the best way
I know of to honor his memory.

239
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:47,250
Man... That really
sucks, Suzuha...

240
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:48,833
But hey, don't
worry about it!

241
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:51,041
I'll get this all fixed up,
and you're in like Flynn!

242
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,375
And I'm gonna keep looking for
your old man while you're off

243
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,666
doing your time traveling thing.

244
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,125
You just come
back to us, okay?

245
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:58,333
Oh, and if you could get
me that cel on the down-low...

246
00:13:58,416 --> 00:13:59,833
that'd be cool...

247
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,916
I absolutely loathe
making this stuff...

248
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,041
C'mon, Future
Gadget Lab founder...

249
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,833
Think you ought've invented
a robot to do this by now?

250
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:17,541
Coffee's an assistant's
sacred duty.

251
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,250
Future Gadget the Second...

252
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,208
New R&amp;D Prototype...

253
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:31,875
Alpha test number
two-point-six-seven.

254
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,458
Or "Bamboo-Copter
Cam," for short.

255
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:35,958
On account of the
closed-circuit digital camera

256
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,083
we put in the base.

257
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:38,875
This is actually practical...!

258
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,708
We could use it to
conduct an aerial search--!

259
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,916
Sadly, the camera
lacks its own gyrometer,

260
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,083
and the spinning footage
is nausea-inducing.

261
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,958
That seems like it's
a pretty basic problem

262
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,708
for version two-point-six-seven.

263
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:50,916
Ah, but that's the
only one... You see...

264
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,208
Daru tends to name
things on a whim

265
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:55,708
without much concern
for logic or convention.

266
00:14:58,291 --> 00:14:59,541
Where's Daru?

267
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:02,041
Still there. Probably
gonna pull an all-nighter.

268
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,125
The Divergence Meter...

269
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:21,041
You should be the
one to keep this.

270
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:22,541
It's only fair,

271
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,416
considering you're the one
who built it in the first place.

272
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,125
Remember, the big
picture changes

273
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:30,208
if the tubes ever reflect a
number bigger than one-point-oh.

274
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:31,666
And since you're the only one

275
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,958
with the Reading
Steiner ability,

276
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:35,458
you're the only one who
can track the changes.

277
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:37,083
Did my future self
hand that over

278
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,291
to you right before he died?

279
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:43,125
Nu-uh. I've never even laid
eyes on future-Okabe...

280
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:46,416
Too risky... seeing as how
you're one of the founders

281
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,916
of the resistance
group I'm a part of.

282
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Me, spearhead the resistance?
Surely you jest.

283
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:56,541
First I let Mayuri die
through no fault of her own...

284
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:59,750
and then I go tilting at
windmills like a goddamn fool?!

285
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,708
How can you say that?!

286
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,250
What's foolish about wanting
to save the world from tyranny?!

287
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:07,000
Isn't that a goal
worth dying over?!

288
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:42,083
Uh... how's it hanging?

289
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:44,875
I'mma bust out some questions,

290
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:48,833
yo, so holla at ya boooooy...!
Wordtoyamutha!

291
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,166
Sorry. I don't speak jive.

292
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,625
Well that was
nice and awkward...

293
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,708
I've a button that
I want you to ID...

294
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:59,083
Have you seen this before?

295
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:00,750
Or, if you don't
recognize it, then...

296
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,833
perhaps you know
someone who would...?

297
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:05,125
Nah, it isn't
ringing any bells...

298
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:08,125
Sorry... I wish I had
something I could tell you.

299
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:09,958
I can't believe you
said "wordtoyamutha"

300
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:12,583
to this guy, you freak...

301
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:13,708
Look, if you remember...

302
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,750
please don't hesitate to call.

303
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,208
Maybe the pin simply
doesn't exist yet...

304
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:26,166
There's nothing to say
it couldn't be made

305
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,416
in the near future.

306
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,958
Yeah, I guess...

307
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:31,291
Well... it's okay, maybe it
just wasn't meant to be, y'know?

308
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:33,041
Hey, at least we tried.

309
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,375
So you're throwing in the towel?

310
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:36,875
Just like that?
With a full day left?!

311
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:37,500
Why are you getting s--?

312
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:38,875
Listen!

313
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:41,000
Saving Mayuri's life is
my absolute top priority...!

314
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:44,041
But, you are a lab member
and I intend to help you out!

315
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:46,458
Dammit, that's just what
friends do for one another!

316
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:47,541
But if you've already given up,

317
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:50,041
then what's the
point of even trying?!

318
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,708
Hey, you don't
have to yell about it.

319
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,500
Huh...?

320
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,833
Wow.

321
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:59,208
Sorry.

322
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:00,875
Attention, Attention!

323
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:02,291
What in the... nine hells...?

324
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:05,083
There was a kidnapping
yesterday--right near here!

325
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:08,125
The kidnapper was wearing a pin
just like the one on my fliers!

326
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,583
If you could give it a
look it'd be a big help!

327
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:13,916
Okarin! You're here!

328
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,458
Lookie what I made!

329
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,625
Colorful...

330
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:23,791
Fliers are a pretty
good idea, huh...?

331
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,875
I was thinking about
everything real hard...

332
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,791
and then it just
kinda hit me! Ooh!

333
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,250
And that's when I grabbed
my markers and got to work!

334
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,708
I think I'll call it
"Operation Attention!

335
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:33,625
Someone Got Kidnapped."

336
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:35,291
Advertising a bogus kidnapping

337
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:36,625
might be takin'
things overboard...

338
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:37,833
What are you going to do

339
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,541
when the police take
notice of this little--?

340
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:41,208
Never mind...! Time to go!

341
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:42,291
How come?

342
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:44,541
You! Miss...! stop!

343
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,541
I'm sorry, Okarin...

344
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:52,875
From this moment on,

345
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:54,750
how 'bout you run all your
plans by me first, yeah?

346
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,375
Just to be safe side...

347
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,791
Huh?

348
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,875
What's with the kung-fu?

349
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,833
Never hurts to be
prepared, that's all.

350
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:08,166
I'm glad I found you guys.

351
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,000
I got some terrible
news out there...

352
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,416
Go on...

353
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,791
When I went to buy lunch...

354
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:17,583
I overheard two of the
shop clerks gossiping.

355
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:18,916
I'm sorry, Suzuha,

356
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,791
but I think your dad might
have kidnapped somebody!

357
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:30,541
Wait... what...?
What's so funny, huh?

358
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,083
How goes it?

359
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:39,541
Take a soda break?

360
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,666
This is not my soda of choice

361
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,041
and it's room temperature,

362
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,916
but it's gonna be gone
in like thirty seconds, bro.

363
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,125
Well? Do you think
you can get it working?

364
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:49,791
Should have it done by tomorrow.

365
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:50,875
Check this guy out!

366
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:52,416
We're gonna have time to spare!

367
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,500
Daru's a cheetah when
it comes to tech jobs.

368
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:57,666
He's so unassuming, I'd never
have known he was a bad-ass.

369
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,416
Don't judge a book by its cover.

370
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,750
Guess you're right.
Lesson learned.

371
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,916
Wanna hop in and
lend a hand, Suzuha...?

372
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,916
The heat in the time-machine
might be oppressive,

373
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,416
but it's nothing
that couldn't be fixed

374
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,083
by stripping down to
our unmentionables...

375
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:11,500
Why're you such a creeper?!

376
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:14,375
Wow, Suzuha and Daru make
a pretty good match, huh!

377
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:18,125
Huh...?! How do you
mean? Predator-prey?

378
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:21,500
I don't know how
I mean it. But they just do.

379
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,041
What's going on?

380
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:25,750
Oh, it's nothing... Mayuri's
just being inscrutable again.

381
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:28,166
I know you gotta
go back to 1975,

382
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,333
but I'm gonna worry
about you a lot...!

383
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,416
And if that time-machine
could hold two people,

384
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,750
I would totally
be going with you!

385
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,625
No offense, but how's
that going to help ?

386
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,250
How can you ask that, silly?!

387
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,041
I'd hold her hand real tight...

388
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:40,750
and tell her stuff like,
"Don't be scared,

389
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,583
'cause your friend
Mayuri is here for you,

390
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:45,666
and we're in this thing
together, come rain or shine!"

391
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:54,208
Listen... There's
something I need to say...

392
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:57,125
and the chance might
not come up later, so...

393
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,791
If that's how you
feel, go ahead.

394
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:04,375
Thanks so much... You guys
have really gone to bat for me.

395
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:06,083
When I first came
back to this time,

396
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:08,500
I didn't know a single person
around here, you know...?

397
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:10,125
This place might
be walk in the park

398
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:11,291
compared to where I'm from...

399
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:14,458
but to me, it was
still as scary as hell.

400
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,708
But now, just get a load
of all the awesome people

401
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:20,125
here than I can call friend.

402
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:23,666
Traveling back to this
period was a good idea...

403
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:27,500
This was... the most
fun I've ever had.

404
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:29,791
I'm glad I got this
time to be with you guys,

405
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:31,333
even if it wasn't for long...

406
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:36,583
Being a member of the Future
Gadget Lab... it was nice.

407
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,541
Yeah, it was...

408
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:39,958
It's up to you.

409
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:41,583
You're the only
chance we've got...

410
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:45,416
Promise me you'll keep
the world the way it is now.

411
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,791
I promise...

412
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,541
Yes?

413
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:54,208
Yeah, is this the
"wordtoyamutha" guy?"

414
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:56,500
You're the street vendor, right?

415
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:57,541
I just wanted you to know.

416
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:59,083
Last night, I met
a guy who wanted

417
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:01,041
a pin like you
were asking about.

418
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:03,083
You're telling me
you found her father?!

419
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:05,041
I'll meet you in
the alley in fifteen.
