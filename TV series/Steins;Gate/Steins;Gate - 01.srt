1
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,708
Consider: Can the universe be
justifiably called "infinite?"

2
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:17,000
Doubtful...

3
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:22,875
It may not have a discernible
end, but it had a beginning...

4
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:24,291
And its component parts

5
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:27,875
definitely have a limited
cosmological shelf life...

6
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,125
Splitting hairs or not,
if history tells us anything

7
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:35,583
it's that scientists often
make very poor poets...

8
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:40,666
We're a ship of
fools chasing phantoms;

9
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:44,708
heedless of what really
underwrites natural law.

10
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:48,958
Okarin.

11
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,666
Yeah, yeah. 

12
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:22,958
Infiltration commencing.
El. Psy. Congroo...

13
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,625
Over and out. 

14
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:31,583
Place is a mortuary.

15
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:34,333
Organization stink
is all over this.

16
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:35,708
Why did we
come here again?

17
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:40,000
Huh? You're here because
I permit you to be.

18
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:45,541
Ooo! A time machine? Neat!

19
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,541
The good doctor has
beaten us to the punch,

20
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:49,416
oh devoted one...

21
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,541
He, in his unqualified hubris,

22
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:53,916
has broken ground on the
invention of the millennium

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,375
and I'm morbidly curious

24
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:58,958
to see where our theories
intersect, if at all. Hmph!

25
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:01,541
Huh...?! 

26
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:03,666
The roof!

27
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:19,208
Eh...? What the hell?

28
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:31,375
Is anything not an emergency? 

29
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:32,916
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,583
I know sometimes it's not,
but this one counts for sure.

31
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:39,000
These are really,
really rare, and I'm broke.

32
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:41,041
I look like an ATM to you...?

33
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:44,166
Too bad so sad,
Greedy Gus... Life lesson.

34
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,750
Awww!

35
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:51,583
The Reality Principle does like
to disabuse us of our whims...

36
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,958
Case in point:
this one's a dud.

37
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:03,250
Look...! He's metal...! 

38
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:04,333
Huh?

39
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:07,083
I don't believe it...!
A metal oopa!

40
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:08,166
And that's good? 

41
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,541
Ahh! You bet it is!

42
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:17,750
Hhhh... Yes, well. You
would know better than I.

43
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,250
Thank you, Okarin. 

44
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,125
"Hououin Kyouma." 

45
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:22,625
Whatever. You're the best. 

46
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,708
My name is a matter of--

47
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:27,291
Your attention, please.

48
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,500
Doctor Nakabachi's
conference is about to begin

49
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,125
in the 8th floor lecture hall.

50
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:33,500
All who are interested
are welcome to attend.

51
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,583
Printed on the handouts
there in front of you

52
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,166
is more or less the
hard blueprint

53
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,750
for one of mankind's
oldest ambitions...

54
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:44,125
Of course...

55
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:46,416
The theoretical scaffolding
begs some explanation.

56
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,083
As I'm sure you're aware,

57
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:50,000
mainstream science currently
boasts something like ...

58
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:51,333
"Okay, don't be mad.

59
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:54,708
I think I dropped my Oopa,
but I'm looking for it!"

60
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,125
Each separate
discipline involved...

61
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:59,708
"The, inter-dimensional
vectors of time travel..."

62
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,500
Doctor!!!

63
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:09,791
Save your questions until...

64
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,333
I have none, sir...!

65
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:13,708
I throw down the gauntlet as
to your "theory's" authorship!

66
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:16,041
Do you take us all for
babes in the wilderness...?!

67
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,208
<i>Please</i> ! World lines?
Kerr Black Holes...?

68
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:21,500
Two words, sir:
"John Titor!" Oh, yes!

69
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:24,958
I submit to all and sundry that
you have shamelessly plagarized

70
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:27,083
the decade-old scratchings
of an internet meme!

71
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:30,041
Oh please...!
Far from it, my friend!

72
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:33,166
Titor's so-called theories
are borderline schizophrenic!

73
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,750
Well, you'd certainly be in
a unique position to know...

74
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:38,208
I wonder if you might indulge
us with a brief overview

75
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,291
of just where
your views diverge?

76
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,750
Excuse us.

77
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:46,041
H-Hey...!

78
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:46,958
Seriously? John Titor...?

79
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,208
Guy's got a point.

80
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:49,916
There's, like,
similarities out the wazzu...

81
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,291
Hmph!

82
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,791
Who in the Hell are you?! 

83
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:56,541
I think that's my line.

84
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,208
Uh... Beg pardon? 

85
00:04:58,291 --> 00:04:59,500
'Kay, so...

86
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:00,875
What were you trying
to tell me back there...?

87
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:02,916
Earlier I mean? 

88
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,583
Earlier?

89
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,208
Quarter of an hour ago. 

90
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:07,958
They let you outta
the nut house?

91
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,583
Hold on a second...
Makise Kurisu...

92
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:15,333
The published Makise Kurisu... 

93
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,208
Okay, that's impressive...

94
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,500
I'm guessing you're a
grunt in some university lab?

95
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,333
Damn your eyes!

96
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:23,750
What is the
Organization playing at?!

97
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,958
Uh... I'm sorry...?

98
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,833
Look, I just wanted
to ask you about what--

99
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,875
And you're a fool
to expect I'll talk...!

100
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:32,583
Red Alert. I've been
cornered by an Agent.

101
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,375
Possibly a sleeper.
Certainly illustrious...

102
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:35,750
Who are talking to? 

103
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:39,000
Fear not. I'll give her
the slip. Somehow. Perhaps--

104
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:41,416
Uh... It's... not on.

105
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:45,875
Hahahahaha!

106
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:48,416
Well...! You are a credit
to your training, madam...

107
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,958
Few discover the ploy...

108
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:51,666
This phone shuts
off automatically

109
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,041
in all hands but mine...

110
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:55,833
thus preserving the
integrity of my communications.

111
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,750
Great. You're crazy. 

112
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,666
Clearly this is asking a lot,

113
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,625
but I need you to summon up
whatever focus you can spare.

114
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,375
Think back fifteen minutes...

115
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,583
You were trying your damnedest
to tell me something...

116
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:13,791
And going by the look you had on
your face, it was worth hearing.

117
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,750
Nice...

118
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:19,541
But don't think to ensnare
me with this gambit...

119
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,125
And rest assured,

120
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:23,250
when next we meet I shan't be
caught off guard so easily...

121
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:23,708
Uh...

122
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,208
Very well.

123
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:27,208
Wait, I...!

124
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:38,833
Clearly a lunatic... I think
I'd remember meeting her.

125
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:55,291
Ah! There you are.

126
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,875
Mayuri! Where have you been? 

127
00:06:57,958 --> 00:06:59,666
What do you mean? I texted!

128
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,666
My oopa's gone missing!

129
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,291
I wrote my name on
it and everything...

130
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:05,666
D'you drop it somewhere? 

131
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,583
Probably.

132
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,166
Such is life.

133
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:11,750
Ah! You have any idea how much
a metal oopa goes for on eBay?

134
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,125
We're talkin' ten thousand yen!

135
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,208
Ten thousand yen?!

136
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:16,291
Yup.

137
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:20,791
Well don't just stand there!

138
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:24,250
That lil' bauble could be the
lab's ticket back to the black!

139
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:26,583
I'm not gonna sell my friend!

140
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:29,208
Just imagine all of the
gloriously wicked experiments

141
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,833
we could get off the ground with
ten thousand yen in the coffers!

142
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:34,416
I'm not gonna sell it. Don't--

143
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:41,750
Whoa...

144
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:44,375
Get outside!

145
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,708
Uh...

146
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,666
I know you're there...

147
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:20,666
Holy... Crap...

148
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:32,708
What's going on?

149
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:34,625
Your guess is as good as mine. 

150
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:48,375
Hey, Okarin! 

151
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,291
Hey you feel alright...?

152
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,625
'Cause you look like
you're about to throw up.

153
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:59,125
Someone's... been murdered...

154
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,625
The eighth floor... 

155
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:38,208
Wha...? Uh...

156
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,250
What is going on...? 

157
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:01,875
Too-too-roo! Bottoms up!

158
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:07,958
The Hell is this?

159
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,625
Um. A drink?

160
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:12,083
No, I mean...
Everyone just disappeared...

161
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,250
They did?

162
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:16,166
Yes! A moment ago
there were people here!

163
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,166
Really?

164
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,583
Stop kidding around!

165
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:20,958
You had to have seen it, too...!
Tell me you saw it, too!

166
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:22,208
I didn't.

167
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,708
This is ridiculous!

168
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,750
Don't play games...

169
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:16,666
I know you're watching...
That's right, freak...

170
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:20,583
It behooves you
nothing to ignore me.

171
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,000
Take a good look.

172
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,958
Quaff deeply from the
trough of Future Shock...!

173
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:27,791
Allow that wooly brain
to be stricken with envy!

174
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:30,083
You are speaking to
Member Double-O One...

175
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,958
Lab Founder, Evil Genius and
Mad Scientist extraordinaire...

176
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:36,791
'Tis I... Hououin Kyoma.

177
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:39,291
I still think that
Okarin sounds way cuter.

178
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:40,625
Silence...!

179
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,625
My nom-de-plume is for
special missions only...!

180
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:46,041
The girl, is known as
Double-O Two. My assistant...

181
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:49,666
Cosplayer and resident
female... Shiina Mayuri!

182
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:53,291
Too-too-roo! I prefer Mayushii. 

183
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,833
Next up... I give
you Hashida Itaru...

184
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:59,666
Our... Hack...
Member Double-O Three!

185
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,083
Ugh. It's hack-er.

186
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:02,541
The way you say
it makes no sense.

187
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,458
These are The Members.

188
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:06,791
Stop third degree-in'
the lil' guy, will ya?

189
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,333
It's gettin' painful.

190
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:12,000
Bad enough you yoinked him outta
the eighty percent off bin.

191
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,416
Heed me!

192
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,708
To find us,
pry open the tiny door,

193
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:18,375
hang a left at
Red Queen's Ersatz Botanical

194
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:20,375
and we're two blocks up
in the warehouse lofts

195
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:23,166
just before March
Hare's Haberdashery!

196
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:26,291
Chaos is our prime directive:
To pitch the world on its ear

197
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:28,500
via the maddest of
mad sciences...!

198
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:31,250
If you knew all of this prior,
continue to stare blankly...

199
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:36,250
Ah-ha! Just as I suspected!
Doff the charade, mutant!

200
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:37,791
Hey guys, you know what?

201
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:40,583
I was just thinking how weird
it would be if to Alpacaman,

202
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:42,166
we're the weird old piece
of discount software...

203
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,250
Maybe we could stitch together
an eight-bit Turing Test slash

204
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,583
First Person Shooter
and find out.

205
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:49,083
Ooo! And we could use it
on your Two-D girlfriends

206
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:50,666
to see if they're
really into you.

207
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:54,125
They're not girlfriends; they're
a harem I worked very hard for.

208
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,833
No one wants to discuss
your den of iniquity.

209
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:59,000
We were just having
a lively back-and-forth

210
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:01,500
about the age-old question
of whether or not the world

211
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:04,500
as we know it isn't just
some high-rez RPG programmed

212
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,291
into existence by a
higher intelligence.

213
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:06,833
It's not.

214
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,083
How do you know?

215
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,666
Because as a concept,
it's absolutely bunk...

216
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,000
And because every moment
we fritter away pondering

217
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,333
such nonsense we lose
time more fruitfully spent

218
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,666
devising ways to unravel
The Organization's plan.

219
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,500
Hhhh... Oh, yeah. My bad.

220
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:21,625
Didn't mean to take us
down the rabbit hole there.

221
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:22,916
Hold thy tongue Hack...!

222
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,250
You are addressing

223
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:27,500
the rabbit hole's preeminent
denizen, Hououin...

224
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,333
...Kyouma!

225
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:33,750
I'm sorry, you said something?

226
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,666
Mark me, my porcine friend,

227
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,416
one of these days you'll
despair to have missed

228
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,375
even the least of my utterances.

229
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:40,958
Exactly why I back up

230
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:43,375
every insane outburst
in triplicate, chief...

231
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:46,666
Press chopper's gotta
be on the scene by now...

232
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,166
...several sources
independently confirmed

233
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,958
that the impact
occurred around noon...

234
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:53,250
The object appears
to be a satellite.

235
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:55,166
As you can probably judge
for yourselves at home,

236
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,000
it's massive.

237
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:59,291
Okay... Retracing steps...

238
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:02,833
Mayuri came with me to see Dr.
Nakabachi showboat this morning,

239
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:03,958
I remember that.

240
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,833
We left the lab
together, in fact...

241
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:09,333
We were standing in the doorway
of a half-empty lecture hall

242
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:12,791
when the crash happened...
But then what?

243
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:16,666
I did?

244
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,333
Yeah. I was right
there with you;

245
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,333
we saw the crash on
the news and you said

246
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:24,333
"The Organization has made its
move at last," or whatever...

247
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:26,916
Then we ran straight
there to have a good look.

248
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,833
Canceled?!

249
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:29,250
How can you be surprised?

250
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,333
You were rantin' sideways
about it this morning,

251
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:33,041
said the doc got cold feet...

252
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:34,583
No, no, no!

253
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:37,125
Nakabachi's lecture started
at twelve o'clock on the dot!

254
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:39,583
Sorry, dude. You're havin'
a stroke or somethin'.

255
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:41,916
It was cancelled.
Good thing, too.

256
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,291
They'd be scrapin' you

257
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,083
off the bottom of that
satellite if it hadn't been.

258
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:47,916
What in the Hell
is wrong with me...?

259
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,333
Has The Organization been
tampering with my memory?

260
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:54,750
Ah! Of course...!
It's absolutely clear!

261
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,833
Stein's Gate has chosen!

262
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,416
And here we go...

263
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,041
Another reference
no one gets but you.

264
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:04,166
Consider your audience
once in a while, huh?

265
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:08,125
Daru! Future Gadget #1!

266
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:09,541
Alpacaman's mad.

267
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,125
You changed the channel on him.

268
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:11,666
Here.

269
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,833
Thank you.

270
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,000
Damn you, Mr. Braun!

271
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:20,500
Your shoddy equipment
will be our death.

272
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:23,666
What'd you expect?
He gave it to us for free.

273
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,291
Hack! Hoist this fossil!

274
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:26,625
Give the hack thing a rest...

275
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,791
And no: it's a sauna out there.

276
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,916
Just 'cause I've got
some meat on my bones

277
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,708
doesn't mean I'm,
like... strong...

278
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:34,833
Mutiny!

279
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,708
Mr. Braun...!

280
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:44,083
Hey. It's Mr. Tennouji or
it's nothing. I told you.

281
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,541
I require repairs...
Now... Or else...

282
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:51,458
Huh? The Hell you
do with it now...? Ugh.

283
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:54,375
You psychos screw up everything
you lay your damn hands on...

284
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,000
It'll be a thousand yen.

285
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,458
Ah! That is outright
extortion, sir...!

286
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,041
I will not stand...

287
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:02,125
I could always toss you outta
your digs, if you'd rather...

288
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:04,166
Damn the vagaries of haggling.

289
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:07,791
When you gonna wise up and
run with a better crowd, girlie?

290
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:11,375
I don't think I really have a
choice. I'm a hostage, you know.

291
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:13,541
I swear. One of these days...

292
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:14,875
Are you kidding?

293
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:18,083
The electron gun's fried!
That'll cost you double.

294
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:19,666
Take it or leave it.

295
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:22,291
Your decision.

296
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:27,833
New development.

297
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:30,416
The Organization has
apparently hit Cue Ball

298
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,541
into the corner pocket...

299
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:33,625
Our enemies multiply.

300
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:34,916
Here.

301
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,125
Huh?

302
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:42,458
You sure guzzle that stuff
like it's going out of style.

303
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:48,958
To exemplary IQ's, this "stuff"
is nothing short of ambrosial.

304
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,416
Listen to them...
they're singing!

305
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,833
Daru! It seems our
landlord has finally

306
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:11,833
gone over to The Enemy,
as we've feared.

307
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:15,250
Our hand is forced... Plan
Omega must be set in motion!

308
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,541
Alrighty...

309
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,125
This is no time to be glib!

310
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,333
We must conduct a
verifiable field test

311
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,291
for Future Gadget Numero Eight!

312
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:25,208
Oh, right. The "Phone-wave
(Real Name TBA)"...

313
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:28,958
<i>Okay</i> ... How do you "field test"
a kitchen appliance?

314
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,916
Three and a half
years now, yes...?

315
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,875
That's how long you and
I have known one another?

316
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,708
Only if we're countin'
the year and some change

317
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:36,666
of high school when we
were in different classes

318
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,208
and never said a
word to each other.

319
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:39,666
Details, details...

320
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,958
The point is, our friendship
spans the abyss of time...

321
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:46,583
One would imagine our thoughts
to be simpatico by this stage.

322
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,458
Heh. Scary thought.

323
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:50,791
If you wanna give the
R.E.N.G another whirl,

324
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,750
though, I'm down for it.

325
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,000
Banana, Double O Two!

326
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,666
Why? You're just gonna
nuke the poor thing...

327
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,208
You'll make it all icky.

328
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:01,333
Steel yourself, woman!
This is for science!

329
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:03,041
Well, it's your experiment...

330
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,958
Bet you'd think it
was pretty wasteful

331
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:06,875
if you paid for
these yourself, though.

332
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,208
Yes, yes.

333
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:13,000
Welcome to the Radioactive
Entre Navigational Gopher

334
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:14,458
for your Phone-wave.

335
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:16,625
To set time, press the
numerical keys corresponding

336
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:19,708
to the desired
allotment of seconds,

337
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,250
followed by the pound sign.

338
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,458
One-two-zero-pound.

339
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:29,041
Solid turntable action.
Clockwise.

340
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:31,375
Unique for a
microwave, I notice.

341
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:32,833
Clockwise?

342
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:35,791
There's significance buried
somewhere in that fact,

343
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:36,916
I can feel it...

344
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,708
Approached from a
quantum perspective,

345
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,208
Hand's rule of
maximum multiplicity...

346
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:41,791
Don't get ahead of yourself.

347
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:42,875
No, of course.

348
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,000
Thank you. 

349
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:48,791
Typical result.

350
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:51,125
Great big gobs o'
greasy grimy gopher guts.

351
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:53,041
Doesn't do that to
my chicken tenders.

352
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,250
Maybe it's something about...

353
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:55,875
Perhaps, but the
consistency of its effect

354
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:58,500
on bananas tends to strengthen
my Stein's Gate hypothesis...

355
00:19:58,583 --> 00:19:59,791
Just what I was thinkin'.

356
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,833
Stifle. Eat one
for verification.

357
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:03,041
Hells no.

358
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:05,625
So be it. The honors
go to you, my lovely.

359
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:09,500
Hmm... Do I have to? The bananas
get all gross and floppy.

360
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,833
I don't really like
the way they taste.

361
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:12,750
You've eaten one?

362
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:13,458
Mayushii...

363
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:14,583
Huh?

364
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:15,833
Could you give me
that spiel again...?

365
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:18,166
Only instead of
gross could you say wet?

366
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,958
Alrighty... The bananas
gets all wet and floppy.

367
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,250
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

368
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:24,875
Hopefully this gives
our viewers at home

369
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,708
a better view of this
thing's dimensions--

370
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:28,666
not to mention the
damage it's caused...

371
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,000
I'm totally dying here.

372
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:33,166
You've been outside
all of ten minutes.

373
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,458
Hey, put yourself in my shoes.

374
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,375
It's a lot farther
than a guy like me

375
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,333
usually ventures on
foot in the summer.

376
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:42,625
Why can't they do
it at Queen May's?

377
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,541
Because a college wants
nothing to do with a maid café.

378
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:48,375
Ugh... Yeah, well the
deans are beggin' me

379
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:50,458
to drop out with that attitude.

380
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:58,083
Whew! Air-conditioning!
I can feel the life coming back.

381
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,666
There's no way in
hell the satellite

382
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,791
can be just a coincidence.

383
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,458
You still harping on that?

384
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:04,333
You're telling me you're
not the least bit curious

385
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:05,500
to see the crash site?

386
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:07,083
Like we'd see anything
through the crowd.

387
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:11,208
'Sides, I'm keeping tabs on the
whole shebang via the interwebs.

388
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:15,833
Ah... Extra vacation days...
Another holiday?

389
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,833
Wait a minute, of course...
Give me your phone.

390
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:21,583
What for?

391
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,416
Stop asking questions!

392
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,250
Violation of my basic
rights, douche bag!

393
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,500
I sent you a text.

394
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:29,750
About Makise Kurisu's murder...

395
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:31,833
Dude. That was
like so last week.

396
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,583
Last week?

397
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:37,291
You broke it up into
three parts... Spam monkey.

398
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:38,041
See?

399
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:39,083
Huh?

400
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:43,833
Received July 23rd,
12:56pm? What?

401
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,333
Yup.

402
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:49,166
What the...?
Hang on, my outbox...

403
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:52,875
Where is it? What's today?

404
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:55,708
Huh? It's the
twenty-eighth. Why?

405
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:58,416
Spill it.

406
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,583
My text... Traveled
backward in time...

407
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:01,625
What?
