1
00:00:10,041 --> 00:00:14,041
Curséd be these hands...
what granted you life...!

2
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:17,375
Now honor our sulphurous
contract... writ in blood...!

3
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:21,166
Let the ebon
flames burn black...!

4
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:26,916
Fulfill my wish, O beast!

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,333
Ahhhhh!

6
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,750
How'm I gonna heat up
my chicken tenders now...?!

7
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:33,500
You can expect this level
of disregard for your things.

8
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:35,791
You might wanna run for it.

9
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:36,916
Don't be a butthead...!

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,583
You should say
that you're sorry--

11
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:40,500
then go out and buy
me a new microwave!

12
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,625
Surely not in this economy?

13
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:46,166
No photographs...!
I was very clear on that!

14
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,791
A keepsake.

15
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:48,500
Huh?

16
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:51,166
Shining Finger!

17
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,375
Check it, ladies, the
upgrade is complete...!

18
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:57,666
Phone Wave Mark II Version 1.03
is ready to rock your world...!

19
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,875
Thanks to the heroic
efforts of yours truly,

20
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:02,541
we can now shuttle D-mail
to any number we feel like!

21
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:04,291
Excellent work, my friend!

22
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:06,916
We should get back to
the experiments, then!

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,291
Is it really a... time machine?

24
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:11,500
You're not to breathe
a word of it to anyone.

25
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:15,458
I sure do hope Mr. Prawn
doesn't get mad at us again...

26
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:18,458
Part-time girl!

27
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:19,833
Hello down there!

28
00:01:19,916 --> 00:01:20,708
Hi!

29
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:21,583
This is no time for too-too-!

30
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:24,125
Where's... Mr. Braun?!

31
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:25,083
Who's that?

32
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:26,250
Daddy's name
isn't Mr. Braun...

33
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:28,041
Oh, you're talking
'bout the big boss-man.

34
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:29,458
I think he's been
out on a house-call

35
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:30,333
for most of the afternoon.

36
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:31,500
House call?

37
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:33,166
Why you think I'm
fiddling with my bike?

38
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:41,083
Now, Mayuri.

39
00:01:58,333 --> 00:01:59,625
It's real!

40
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:02,083
Hey... what was that...?

41
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:43,083
I betcha some
juicy chicken tenders

42
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:45,625
would go really
well with all this...

43
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:49,125
Huh? Hold on...!
Where's the bag with my soda?!

44
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:50,625
Sorry. Sold out.

45
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:52,958
Then you beat a path from
store to store till you find it!

46
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:56,000
I wouldn't have to explain this
to an assistant worth her salt!

47
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:58,916
I'm not gonna schlep all over
town just to get you soda...!

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,041
Here.

49
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:04,750
Hand it over...

50
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,333
I'm a mad scientist,

51
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:09,083
not some shriveled octogenarian
mewling about his fiber intake.

52
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,166
Let the round
table now assemble!

53
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,541
Just a sec, man--I'm
gettin' the sweats.

54
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:18,500
What in the nine hells do
you think you're doing...?!

55
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:20,375
You want the
Organization to hear this?

56
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:21,666
Why not invite them in?

57
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,916
Yeah, whatever.

58
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:30,333
Starting now, Operation Wyrd

59
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:32,500
goes into the second
phase of experimentation...

60
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:36,666
which will allow us...
to gauge D-mail's effect.

61
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,541
Barley tea's so
good in the summer...!

62
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,208
You want some, Moeka?

63
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:44,375
Okay, so what kind of
experiments are you thinkin' of?

64
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,500
We are going to change the past.

65
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:52,125
No way. We are not taking
that kind of risk...!

66
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,041
What if it results
in a time paradox?

67
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,291
Then so be it...!

68
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:57,375
Any true mad scientist
would absolutely kill

69
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,125
to know if D-mails can
really alter the past.

70
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:00,833
You disappoint me, Assistant.

71
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:02,291
I... I just think...

72
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,166
How are you gonna
prove it, Okarin?

73
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,791
Thank you so much for asking.

74
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,083
By virtue of a single event,

75
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,583
the occurrence of
which will brook no doubt.

76
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,750
Picking the winning
numbers in the lottery!

77
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,041
Okarin... I'm
disappointed in you.

78
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:22,666
Dude, sick! I'm totally
rollin' up to the curb

79
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,625
at Queen May's in the earthbound
equivalent of a Star Destroyer!

80
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,000
Instead of being Greedy Gus'es,

81
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:27,208
wouldn't it be a lot nicer

82
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,791
if we tried to make
world peace happen...?

83
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:32,041
We could give everyone
on Earth an oopa cushion!

84
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:35,458
Seriously, man...
Way to be a total jackass.

85
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:38,041
I'm trying to see if I can alter
the blasted past, woman...!

86
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,708
We need a quantifiable change!

87
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,541
And that's the first
thing you could think of?

88
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:42,958
Quiet, Little Miss Moneybags!

89
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,666
"Moneybags"...? What the hell?!

90
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,208
Well that's what
you really are...!

91
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:49,875
Lounging in some
opulent hotel room

92
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,083
your parents are paying for...!

93
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,250
"Let them eat cake!"
eh there, Antoinette!?

94
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,291
Don't you have a lotto to fix?

95
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,208
Makise's right.
We should figure that out.

96
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,625
Which one should we win, though?

97
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:02,708
Which one, indeed...

98
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:03,958
What's the matter?

99
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:05,208
Not sure...

100
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,125
Where is Double-O Five?

101
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:10,375
Dunno.

102
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,958
What're you doing?!

103
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,500
There ya go.

104
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,000
Can't take my eyes off of
you for a second, can I?

105
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:20,416
I texted... You never replied.

106
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:27,041
Dude, smoking hot aside,
what a space-cadet.

107
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:27,833
Christina!

108
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:29,250
You are hereby tasked

109
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:30,666
with preventing her
from wandering off!

110
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:34,916
Huh...?! Hey!
I'm not your guard dog.

111
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,458
Poor Moeka, stuck on the couch.

112
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,666
Would you like me to give
you the grand tour of the lab?

113
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,458
It really is a
whole lot of fun...!

114
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:45,250
If you don't believe
me, just ask Kurisu!

115
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:49,166
Hmmm... now where to start...

116
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,250
How 'bout the Lotto 6?
It looks juicy.

117
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:55,958
They've just announced
this week's winning numbers.

118
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:59,000
So now we send them into the
past... and see what happens.

119
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,416
You're really going to do this?

120
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,416
If you've a better
idea, speak up!

121
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:05,666
The numbers're right here,
so we can do it whenever...

122
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:11,166
Looks like the current jackpot's
at... Two-hundred million!

123
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,166
Two... hundred million...?!

124
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,625
Whoa, Daru! Hold on...!

125
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:14,958
That's a little much, yeah...?

126
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,500
Say wha?

127
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,166
Well... hitting a jackpot of
that size would only serve...

128
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,875
to... draw unwanted
attention to ourselv--

129
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:22,000
What a total chicken.

130
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:23,458
Second prize?!

131
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:26,166
Oh, good call. Only 23 million.

132
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,333
What's third?!

133
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:28,041
Seven-hundred thousand.

134
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:30,791
Perfect-that-one-yes!

135
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,583
Good form there,
fearless leader.

136
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,500
This from the girl who's
quailing in her boots

137
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:35,208
at the thought--

138
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:35,916
This is an oopa cushion!

139
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,250
If you ever feel oogy

140
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:38,500
and you need to
some cheering up...

141
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,791
just-give-'em a big hug!

142
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:44,458
Next stop! The lab refrigerator!

143
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:47,333
What's inside you today...?

144
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:49,000
May I...?

145
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:59,625
Time to earn your
keep, Double-O Five.

146
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:03,458
Here's your first Future
Gadget Lab assignment.

147
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:05,541
Oh! This is exciting!

148
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:08,208
I would like you to compose
the D-mail message...

149
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,916
Something that will convince
the ignorant me of a week ago

150
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,791
to buy a ticket with the
number we've provided.

151
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:20,375
Seven days is...
168 hours. Cool if I round up?

152
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,916
That'll do.

153
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,375
Short and sweet.

154
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:24,708
Okay. Ready when you are.

155
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:28,666
Stein's Gate will finally
swing open to admit me!

156
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,166
Not that again.
Give the crazy the day off.

157
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:34,041
You're remarkably
close-minded for a scientist!

158
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,000
You looked like you
were... both having fun.

159
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:40,833
Fun?

160
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:42,458
Dealing with this nut-case?!

161
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:45,000
They're the OTP in the
fan-fic I call my life...

162
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,541
We are not OTP!

163
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:49,833
Oh...! So you know the jargon
of the fan-fic community...!

164
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:52,541
Huh...?! I don't know
what you're talking about!

165
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,291
It rolled off your
tongue so naturally...

166
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:57,333
Look. If we're gonna
do this, let's do it!

167
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:01,208
'Kay, everybody--I'm getting
ready to fire up the Phone Wave!

168
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,208
We are not taking
that kind of risk...!

169
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:21,166
What if it results
in a time paradox?

170
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:26,833
Come on...!
Fortune favors the bold!

171
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:36,500
El... Psy... Congroo!

172
00:09:54,416 --> 00:10:02,375
Okarin...Okarin...!
Hey, are you in there...?

173
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,291
Are you okay...?

174
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,125
I... I don't know...

175
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:16,791
How long... how long have
I just been standing here?

176
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:20,166
Um... about 30 seconds, I guess.

177
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,916
I actually lost
half a minute...?

178
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,250
You don't remember anything...?

179
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,458
We were talking about
what D-mail we should send

180
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,458
to see if it would really
alter the world line...

181
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:28,458
Then all of a sudden...

182
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:29,916
You rushed over
to the Phone Wave

183
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,458
and you went,
"hahhauah" all breathy-like.

184
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:34,666
Hey Mayushii--do that
breathy thing again, yeah?

185
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,000
Oh give it a rest, Daru!

186
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,250
Sorry.

187
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:50,041
It arrived...

188
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,833
Are you sure
you're feeling okay?

189
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:56,458
What about the money?!
From the lotto ticket...!

190
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,791
Did we win third prize,
Christina?! Tell me!

191
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:02,666
Stop calling me that...!
Wait... what ticket?

192
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,333
You really, don't know
what I'm talking about?!

193
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,666
I'm confused...

194
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,750
For the lottery...!

195
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,541
Our experiment
to change the past!

196
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:11,833
Sending back a D-mail!

197
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:13,708
Stop acting like such a spaz!

198
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,208
We haven't come up with
a message to send back yet!

199
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:17,750
What...?

200
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:20,041
Wouldn't it be nice if we tried
to make world peace happen?

201
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,458
We could give everyone
on Earth an oopa cushion!

202
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:25,500
They really don't...
remember it at all...

203
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,583
It's open!

204
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,041
Oh! Hey, Ruka! Come on in!

205
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,458
I hope that you can
forgive me, Kyouma!

206
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:43,166
What...? Why?

207
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,291
Here...

208
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:48,666
Oh-two... and
twelve... eighteen...

209
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,791
an' all the rest... Rukako!

210
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,541
How'd you come up
with these numbers?!

211
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:55,208
Um... well I... tried
to buy a lottery ticket

212
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,041
using the numbers you gave me...

213
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,125
Come again...?!

214
00:11:58,208 --> 00:11:59,500
You said I should
play those numbers

215
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:01,666
because they were lucky
or something, so I tried...

216
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,166
That... was when?

217
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,916
Guess it's been
about a week now?

218
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,666
Omigosh, is your
brain psychic, Okarin?

219
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,416
So, are we winner-winner-
chicken-dinner or what?

220
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,833
That's the thing...

221
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:14,375
I got one of the numbers
all turned around in my head.

222
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:15,916
Huh...?!

223
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,875
Aw, you were so close, dude!

224
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,625
Man, that sucks!

225
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:25,708
Okabe... did you use the
Phone Wave to do this...?

226
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,916
Where's the bag with my soda?!

227
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,125
I'm not gonna schlep all over
town just to get you soda!

228
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:43,916
There's no doubt in
my mind that I sent it.

229
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:48,333
Nothing...
Like it never existed.

230
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:52,625
Perhaps... my actions
have rewritten the past.

231
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:55,875
They've no memory
of the experiment.

232
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:58,875
We discussed it and
carried it out together.

233
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:01,250
No one else remembers it.

234
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,958
I'm the only one.

235
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,750
This feels just like that day.

236
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:12,375
Come on... think...

237
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,916
Whatcha looking at?

238
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,250
Something important to me.

239
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,875
You okay?

240
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,708
You look like,
you've been brainwashed.

241
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:43,416
I, look that rough?
Hell... Maybe I was.

242
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,916
A bit of brainwashing
would certainly

243
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,541
explain whatever's
going on--What the hell?!

244
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:00,250
You haven't been chipped.

245
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:01,416
Uhhh...

246
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,125
Whatever it is,
nobody's brainwashed you.

247
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,416
Good... to know...?

248
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,958
Hey, how do you wash your brain?

249
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:10,541
Well...

250
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:15,041
A mad scientist like yours truly
would be happy to explain it.

251
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:18,416
Maybe we'll hold off 'til she's
a little less afraid of you.

252
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,625
There's something
I have to know.

253
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:27,916
Tremor, huh?

254
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,291
There was one a
while back, I know that.

255
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,000
The shop was
shaking pretty heavy.

256
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:33,625
You should have felt
another about ten minutes ago.

257
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,833
Nope. Dunno how
I could have missed it.

258
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:36,750
You feel it?

259
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,000
Nope.

260
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:41,625
Could you be any
more of a perv?!

261
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,000
C'mon, they stick out...!

262
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,416
Nature wants me to look at 'em!

263
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,166
See? I told ya it's easy
to hear what's going on.

264
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,916
So ungodly loud...!

265
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,541
Did you hear us going on
about the time machines, also?!

266
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,375
Mm-hmm! That was
super interesting.

267
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,041
Well, the knowledge
you're privy to is--

268
00:14:57,125 --> 00:15:00,666
Relax! I'm not gonna go
around blabbing about it.

269
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,000
Y'know... if it's a
problem with the time machine

270
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:04,541
that's got you all
down in the dumps...

271
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:07,625
why not try hitting up
ol' John Titor for advice?

272
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:13,250
In his earlier posts...
Titor did mention

273
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:14,791
that altering the past
would change the...

274
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:18,333
the "divergence number,"
I believe he called it...

275
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:21,041
which would in
turn shift existence

276
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:22,500
onto a different world-line.

277
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,541
Any memories from
the previous world-line

278
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,083
that don't agree
with the new reality...

279
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:31,083
are basically overwritten with
the non-conflicting memories

280
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:33,625
they would have experienced.

281
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,666
The D-mail tossed
us from a world-line

282
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,791
in which Rukako didn't
buy a lottery ticket

283
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:41,041
onto one in which he did.

284
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:45,083
And the past changed
to reflect this new track.

285
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:47,458
In this world, we never
sent the winning numbers

286
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,083
for third prize back in time.

287
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,083
It isn't that they
don't remember it...

288
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:57,208
to them, it never
actually transpired.

289
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,125
Yet I remember everything...

290
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,250
But how is that possible?

291
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,416
Aw, balls! Nae!

292
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,958
Whatever you do,

293
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:14,458
don't tell your daddy I was
slacking off out here, okay?!

294
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,416
Only if you let me
ride your bike later!

295
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,791
Got yourself a deal!

296
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,833
Hey...! Frankenstein!

297
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:23,625
Good luck with
that stuff upstairs.

298
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,375
Oh... thanks...

299
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:30,041
Son of a...!

300
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,416
Yay, you're home!

301
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,791
Okabe!

302
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,500
What the hell were you
doing out here with my kid?!

303
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:35,791
Huh?!

304
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,125
My good Mr. Braun,
I've no idea what you're--!

305
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:38,166
Don't lie to me!

306
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,666
That's my baby
girl you're eying,

307
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,375
so don't think you can
run your experiments

308
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,291
on her up there in
that creepy lab of yours!

309
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,250
How dare you
insinuate I would stoop

310
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:46,833
to using a child as a lab rat!

311
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:48,500
Why don't you ask
Suzuha what we were doing.

312
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:49,625
She was out here with us!

313
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:50,875
Say what?

314
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:52,208
Is that the truth, honey?

315
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:53,541
Uh huh, she was out here--

316
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,458
but she definitely
wasn't slacking off!

317
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:56,666
She wasn't, huh...?!

318
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,875
Why you lazy good-for-nothing!

319
00:16:58,958 --> 00:16:59,958
I'm making a break for it!

320
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:01,375
What the hell am
I paying you for?!

321
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:04,250
All ya do is goof off!
Look at this!

322
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,750
You haven't even
started on this repair!

323
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,875
I... I won't do it again!

324
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:19,625
Due to unforeseen circumstances,

325
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,500
I'm calling off today's
Phone Wave test...

326
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,333
Go home, you guys.

327
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,125
Okarin...?

328
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:36,291
Hey... Didn't you
hear me, Assistant...?

329
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,208
You're free to go.

330
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,833
Just doing a little thinking.

331
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:42,916
Oh yes... You'd rather sit there

332
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,166
and stare at my back than
return to the gilded cage

333
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,333
of your state room--right,
Little Miss Moneybags?

334
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,250
Quit calling me
that stupid name.

335
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,833
I'm composing a very
important message here...

336
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:54,666
If you insist on loitering,
do try to keep your inarticulate

337
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,541
brain-starved moaning
to a minimum, Zombie.

338
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:02,333
Oh goody. We're back to
my least favorite nickname.

339
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:15,750
You're like a schoolgirl,

340
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:18,958
waiting for that cute
boy to write back.

341
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:21,166
Speaking from
experience, are we...?

342
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:25,041
What's up, anyway...?

343
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:27,916
Who're you texting?

344
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,166
John Titor.

345
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,416
Huh?

346
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:52,666
Daru?

347
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,833
What's going on?

348
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:55,250
Okarin--thank God!

349
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:58,041
Look, I just realized
I've made a terrible mistake!

350
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,416
What was it...?! Talk, man!

351
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:04,458
It's all... all my fault...

352
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,458
I left my wallet
back at the lab!

353
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:07,708
What?

354
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:09,291
Yeah! And Queen May's
shut its doors to me!

355
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,500
I hate to ask, but
could you maybe--?

356
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,916
Too-too-roo! Hi, Okarin.

357
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Oh, hello there, Mayuri.

358
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,083
Daru's gonna be hitting
you up for money...

359
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:23,333
You don't have to give
him anything though, okay?

360
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:24,666
Okie-dokie...

361
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,458
But I called to see if you
were feeling any better.

362
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,791
If you're not, then I give
you permission to hug

363
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:33,583
my oopa cushion for as long
as it takes to cheer you up!

364
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,083
You know what,
I may just do that...

365
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:38,833
You have a good night, okay?

366
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:41,666
Don't forget to hug it, okay?

367
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,208
Huh. You're all smiles again.

368
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:56,208
It's him!

369
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:58,583
I received your message...

370
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:00,375
From what you describe,

371
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:02,833
I can only conclude
that you altered the past

372
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:05,500
and shifted the world line.

373
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,708
Your scenario does
puzzle me, though.

374
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:10,291
I don't understand how
you have retained memories

375
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,791
of your original past.
It is problematic.

376
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,416
I swear it's the truth...

377
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,208
This has happened
to me twice now...

378
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,125
What do you make of it?

379
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:22,291
I don't know.

380
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,958
In the version of 2036
from which I hail,

381
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:26,666
the idea of using e-mail

382
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:30,333
to alter past events
hasn't been explored.

383
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:31,833
The concept of altering the past

384
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:35,208
and shifting the world-line
is nothing new to us.

385
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:37,041
That said, it operates within

386
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,666
limits we've
thought were absolute.

387
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,500
No one has ever
been known to maintain

388
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:45,250
their memories across world
lines and observe their changes.

389
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:46,625
Even so...

390
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:50,208
Kyouma... It might be
that you have that ability.

391
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,750
You might be the one person...

392
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:58,833
who can guide the world
beyond 1% divergence.

393
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,333
"Guide the world?!"

394
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:03,250
What is he talking about?!

395
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:08,916
What is this 1% divergence
you're talking about...?!

396
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,833
And what lies beyond
it that's so important?!

397
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,125
Beyond it lies true freedom.

398
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,583
Your future is condemned

399
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:35,583
to dystopia unless that
barrier can be crossed.

400
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:39,583
My goal is to save the future...

401
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:43,500
And you may be the
only one who can do it.

402
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:48,916
You look like
you've seen a ghost.

403
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,083
No... It doesn't make any sense.

404
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:51,750
This has got to be
some kind of mistake...

405
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:54,583
How can I... save the future...?

406
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:56,250
That's absurd...

407
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,625
Kyouma... I ask you...

408
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:14,250
...to be... our savior.
