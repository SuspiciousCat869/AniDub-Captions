1
00:00:08,625 --> 00:00:09,916
We undo that D-mail...

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,416
You'll be...You'll
be murdered.

3
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:56,416
Ah, there you are.

4
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,125
Don't stay up here so
long you draw the ire

5
00:01:58,208 --> 00:01:59,250
of Uncle Heat Stroke.

6
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:00,833
Says the guy who's
always sprawled out

7
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:02,958
on the roof like a cat.

8
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:05,375
It's cloudy today anyway.

9
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,916
Hey, d'you find Mayuri...?

10
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,750
Daru said he didn't see
her at all at Comima.

11
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:14,125
Yeah... I saw her afterward.

12
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:15,583
Ah...

13
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:21,791
Hey... Okabe?

14
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,000
What's up?

15
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:31,500
Never mind, then...

16
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:36,375
Hey...

17
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:40,375
It's starting to rain.

18
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:46,500
Where the hell did
this come from?!

19
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,625
You could have mentioned the
rain a little sooner, y'know...

20
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:58,166
For cryin' out loud,
I'm soaked to the bone.

21
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,125
I'm no meteorologist.

22
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:02,750
You were the one
staring up at the clou--

23
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:09,083
You're such a perv!

24
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:11,791
Hey, it's not like I was
trying to ogle you, okay?!

25
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:14,833
Your penchant for sheer clothing
can hardly be held against me.

26
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:17,166
Guess I forgot what a
typical male you can be!

27
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,791
Ha! As if I'd go to any undue
trouble to catch a glimpse

28
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,041
of your scrawny a--

29
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,833
Finish that thought and
I'll smack you so hard,

30
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,708
your cerebral neocortex
will be pudding!

31
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:25,541
Yeah, you'd like
that--wouldn't you, Zombie!

32
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:27,958
Hey, get outta my face!

33
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,125
Was that... always there?

34
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,708
I must've snagged
it on something

35
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:34,125
while I was looking for you...

36
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:35,625
God, you're klutzy.

37
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:38,250
Because I used my points on
intelligence, not dexterity.

38
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:39,541
Sure ya did...

39
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,375
Whatever gets you
through the night, dark elf.

40
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:42,666
Give it here...

41
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,916
I keep a sewing kit on me--

42
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,250
I can get it fixed
up for you in a jiff.

43
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:47,708
Quite the hausfrau.

44
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,083
Spare me the smirk.

45
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:51,125
I get it, I'm a girl so I'm
good at home-ec stuff--

46
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,000
blah... Just gimme
the damn coat.

47
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:57,000
As you've probably noticed,
it's kinda dark in here,

48
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:59,125
so don't expect needlework
worthy of Athena...

49
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:00,916
I'd say what color
thread I'm using,

50
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,458
'cept that I can't even tell.

51
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:07,625
Your choices, quote-unquote,
are black, red, and pink.

52
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:10,458
I'm just praying that
I don't get the pink...

53
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,250
Ah! Don't try anything!

54
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:13,625
Oh, don't worry.

55
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:14,916
I'm pretty sure a coat-rack
would prove more arous--

56
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,291
What part of "brain
pudding" didn't you get?!

57
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,083
Hmph. You're a
piece of work...

58
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,375
Where'd you even go

59
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:25,458
that you managed to
rip it like this, anyway?

60
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:26,625
Let me see...

61
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:29,083
I went to the lab...
The laundromat...

62
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:32,250
Took a walk... Last of all...

63
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,583
I made a trip to your
fancy hotel.

64
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:37,500
My hotel...? How come?

65
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,166
I didn't have much choice...

66
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:43,416
You wouldn't reply to my
messages... or answer my calls.

67
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,416
Wait, were you...
worried about me--?

68
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,333
I'd be remiss if I didn't
keep tabs on my assistant...

69
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:49,458
Can't have you running amok.

70
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,083
Aren't you done sewing yet?

71
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:57,708
Hold your horses. Catch!

72
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,875
It's still soggy!

73
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:01,125
Just put it on.

74
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:02,708
Who wants to see
the scrawny body

75
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:05,250
of a mad scientist with
pudding for a brain?!

76
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,833
It happened right here...
didn't it?

77
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,666
This is where...
where you found me...

78
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,291
How... do you know that...?

79
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:32,833
I didn't know.
I only suspected...

80
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:36,625
But now that we're here,
I'm having these feelings...

81
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:40,416
So you... you
remember being...?!

82
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,208
Yeah... I can remember
it happening...

83
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:47,333
But the memories I have
are so hazy...It's Like...

84
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:52,208
I dunno... Like I'm looking
at myself through a fog.

85
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:55,083
They're not just of... that.

86
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:59,291
I remember you... How hard
this all has been...

87
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:02,833
You want to save
Mayuri so badly...

88
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:08,083
You're so lonely and hurt...
and you just keep trying...

89
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,875
You live it again, and again...

90
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:12,625
but in the end,
she always dies...

91
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:16,583
How many times have I watched
as you howled her name...

92
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:21,166
I've seen how hard you've
been fighting for her.

93
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,708
You get this look on your
face and when you do,

94
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:30,333
I realize how... how
irreplaceable Mayuri is to you.

95
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:38,291
Nobody's ever... I've never
been that person to anybody.

96
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,125
You're so determined...

97
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:44,541
It made me want to help you...

98
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:47,416
I couldn't let you
face this by yourself.

99
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:55,583
Okabe... I want
you to save her.

100
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,250
Mayuri has to live.

101
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:03,083
And you're the one who
has to make it happen.

102
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:04,416
How can you say that...?

103
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,166
If I return to that
world-line... you will die!

104
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:16,125
If that's... what it
takes... so be it.

105
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:18,041
There's only one way
to make this work.

106
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,291
You know that better
than anyone.

107
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:24,125
So what, then...?!
I just abandon you...?

108
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:25,791
It can't be helped, can it...?

109
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:32,125
I've been trying
since yesterday...

110
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:33,791
I've wracked my brain...

111
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,541
looking for some
magic solution...

112
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:38,250
something that
would save us both.

113
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,541
But there isn't one...

114
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,166
Everything led to the
same conclusion...

115
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:46,750
She continues on the
original line... and I end.

116
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:55,166
Okabe, wait!

117
00:07:56,625 --> 00:08:00,416
You won't die... I'm not
going to let you... I refuse!

118
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:06,333
I can't throw you away
...not even for Mayuri...!

119
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:08,708
What was the point of
this repetitious hell...

120
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:11,791
if I have to lose
someone either way?

121
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:14,833
Someone I...I...!

122
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,666
No more running...

123
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,833
This is what I want...

124
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:36,333
Going back won't change that!

125
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:40,625
Goddamn it!

126
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,541
Time-leaping isn't
going to work...!

127
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,375
You'll never get
past the 1% barrier!

128
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,708
But how can we know for
sure unless we try it?!

129
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:49,666
All that's gonna happen is that
you'll watch Mayuri die again!

130
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,250
Don't go back...

131
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:54,791
Seeing her die is gonna
break you, Okabe!

132
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,750
It won't, though...
How could it?

133
00:08:56,833 --> 00:09:00,250
Do you know how many times
I've watched her die now?

134
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,875
Dozens. Easily.

135
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:10,208
Again... and again, and again
and again and again...!

136
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,666
No matter how many
times I have to watch it

137
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,000
to save you, it's not
going to break me--!

138
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,166
Did you hear what
you just said to me...?

139
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,583
Our friend... is dying
and you don't care...

140
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:29,000
I know you don't
really mean that!

141
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,416
If losing Mayuri doesn't
hurt you anymore...

142
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:37,375
Then... your heart
is already broken.

143
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:41,291
Please, just stop...
It's destroying you.

144
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,708
Yeah... you're right.

145
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:47,666
Has for a while.

146
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:52,041
What's happening is awful...
but I can barely feel it.

147
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:56,541
I'm numb to it...
How did I get here?

148
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:57,791
I've waited to go back,

149
00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:01,833
all so I could note her
precise time of death.

150
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:06,083
Now, her dying is... nothing
more than a puzzle to be solved.

151
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:11,000
I can always...
just give it another go...

152
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:15,083
Try it again... Ad infinitum...

153
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,083
Please, Okabe... Save her...

154
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,833
If you let her die...

155
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,416
you're going to regret it for
the rest of your life...!

156
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,791
Losing her for good
is going to end you!

157
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,333
You know that I'm right!

158
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,416
Think of all the things
you've done to keep her alive!

159
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,500
If you give up now,
then what was it for?!

160
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:40,458
If you let her go... the
Okabe that I know is dead.

161
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:43,708
Dammit...! If I save
Mayuri's life... then you--!

162
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,291
I'll just go back...!

163
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,583
To the initial world line where
the first D-mail was never sent!

164
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,333
I think that's
what's best for you!

165
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:50,958
What's best for both of us!

166
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:03,958
We've argued so many times
these last twenty days...

167
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:07,208
Gone at it like cats
and dogs, even...

168
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,875
But we've shared
our problems, too.

169
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:13,625
Kurisu's the one I relied
on when things got rough.

170
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,750
I came to her with
this over and over...

171
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:19,333
and she always believed in me.

172
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:23,416
She's a scientific genius.
Published at the age of 18...

173
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,041
She can be stubborn as a mule...

174
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:28,000
And proud... and nosy...

175
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:31,083
There's a world of ideas
dancing in her eyes...

176
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:36,083
And her theories... god, how
they always hold me spellbound.

177
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:38,125
I remember every
word she said...

178
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:41,666
Every moment...
we spent together...

179
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:45,791
I've called her
so many things...

180
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:49,166
But never the words
in my heart.

181
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,250
Kurisu...

182
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:02,833
I just don't know...
how to save you.

183
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,500
I'm sorry...

184
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,583
Thank you...

185
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:14,833
Nobody's ever... wanted
to have me around so much.

186
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,375
Why did that girl turn
out to be you...?

187
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:23,583
Why couldn't it have
been somebody else?!

188
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:25,541
You know...
there's a lot about

189
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:29,000
changing world-lines that
we aren't sure of.

190
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,250
Maybe when you...

191
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,750
blip out of existence
in this world-line...

192
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:37,625
you just trade places with
their Okabe or something...

193
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:41,125
You could, for all we
know, right...?

194
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:45,041
It doesn't matter...
You'll be gone.

195
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:48,791
That's what I'm saying...
maybe I won't be.

196
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:51,083
Even if I am dead in
the original world-line...

197
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:55,166
that doesn't necessarily
mean I'll be dead here, too!

198
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,416
There are infinite lines...

199
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,916
What if each one
has its own me...?

200
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,291
And maybe all of our
minds are connected,

201
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:04,625
forming the Kurisu you know.

202
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:09,625
That would be...
wonderful, wouldn't it?

203
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:11,625
Getting to be in so
many times and places.

204
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,916
Always with a similar
quest for truth...

205
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,500
always with a desire to make
a difference in the world...

206
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:21,500
always with the same
love for... someone...

207
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:24,083
Many stars, shining
in their own space...

208
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,916
but just one constellation...

209
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,666
That would be a
beautiful truth.

210
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:34,166
Okabe... Please don't think
of this as letting me die.

211
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,583
Even if the
world-line changes...

212
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:38,583
and I'm gone... so long as
you remember me...

213
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:41,041
I'll still be right there...

214
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,166
With you.

215
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:46,791
I couldn't forget you...
Not even if I tried.

216
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:52,958
There's not a person I care
for in this whole world...

217
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,375
like I do for you.

218
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,750
Uh... You don't...

219
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:57,833
I mean it.

220
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:01,208
What are you trying...
to tell me...?!

221
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:03,625
Kurisu... I love you.

222
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,000
Huh?!

223
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,500
How do you feel about me?

224
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:08,375
How do I feel?!

225
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:13,208
I have to know... just for this
moment... what I was to you.

226
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:18,458
You really want to know...?

227
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:19,375
Yeah.

228
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,208
Don't look, okay?

229
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:22,750
Close your eyes...

230
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:23,541
What for?

231
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,166
Just close 'em!

232
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:59,333
There was... a scientific
rationale for that.

233
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,750
Because... certain
important memories,

234
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:04,291
including but not limited
to one's first kiss,

235
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:05,666
are stored in the hippocampus--

236
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,250
which makes 'em harder
to forget... So I figured--

237
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,458
There's just one problem.

238
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:13,333
You're assuming that
was my first kiss.

239
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,166
Kissing your pillow
doesn't count, virgin!

240
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,541
You would know, wouldn't you...

241
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:19,041
Nevertheless, I will
admit my first kiss

242
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:21,625
lacked that romantic
je ne sais quoi...

243
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:25,375
Either way... my hippocampus
didn't get that one...

244
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,166
Let's try it again.

245
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,541
Huh?

246
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:31,500
I can't risk forgetting
this... Not for anything...

247
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:38,291
I mean, I guess that's
logical... And it's just a kiss.

248
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:47,416
It feels... like time
is passing so quickly...

249
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,208
Damn you, Einstein...

250
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:52,333
Your science is crowding
in on our kiss...

251
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:53,750
He was right, Okabe...

252
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:57,125
The passage of time
depends entirely

253
00:15:57,208 --> 00:16:00,791
on where you're standing...

254
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,458
Relativity Theory...

255
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:08,333
It's so romantic... but
it's just so tragic, too...

256
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,375
This is it.

257
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:19,541
It's not to late
to call the others.

258
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:22,541
A big goodbye with everyone
would hurt too much.

259
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:24,041
But if it's just you...

260
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:26,625
then I can't wait to be outta
here and back in the U.S.

261
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:31,458
It's a joke.

262
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:34,166
I brought you something...
A memento.

263
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,916
What the hell...?

264
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,166
Hey, that happens to be version
2.67 you're sneering at.

265
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,500
It's still impractical...

266
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,041
But I suppose it's the
thought that counts.

267
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,416
Okay...

268
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:53,666
Kurisu--?

269
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,375
Oh, yeah.

270
00:16:56,458 --> 00:17:00,833
Got you something. Catch!

271
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,625
You know you
throw like a girl.

272
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:09,208
Go get it, smartass.

273
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:10,750
Yeah, yeah...

274
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:36,041
Okabe...

275
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:41,041
It hurts me to say it... but
you're gonna have it rough.

276
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,875
It'll be a world where no
one else remembers me...

277
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:48,250
Only you... And you'll
have to shoulder it alone.

278
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,875
You care about people,
more than you know...

279
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:53,250
Losing them gnaws at you.

280
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:59,291
I'm sorry.

281
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:03,500
But... knowing you care
means so much to me.

282
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,208
Maybe when you're
up in the lab...

283
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:08,666
or drinking your soda...
or just walking through town...

284
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:13,000
Or maybe even
during... a kiss...

285
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,000
Not every single time...
Just once in a while...

286
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:20,833
I hope that you'll
think of me...

287
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:25,458
'Cause I'll be right
there with you...

288
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:27,666
Even if we're worlds away...

289
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:31,958
know that I'm
still in your heart.

290
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:37,791
Okabe... Okabe... Okabe...!

291
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:49,791
Heads up...!
I think I found it!

292
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:52,916
This is the droid we're
looking for, right?!

293
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,416
If we erase that line...

294
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,666
Then mission accomplished.

295
00:18:55,750 --> 00:19:01,541
Okarin... You feel okay?

296
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,541
Why wouldn't I?

297
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:08,916
Finally...! The ultimate moment
of Operation Verdandi is nigh!

298
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,875
Victory is ours for the taking!

299
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,750
Despite their vile
machinations... we held fast...

300
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:17,791
we stayed true to our
convictions... and persevered!

301
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:21,666
We have survived the
Battle of Ragnarok!

302
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,125
To my comrades-in-arms...

303
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,666
who fought and
bled for this victory...

304
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,750
You have my gratitude!

305
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:32,375
And I promise...
I will never... forget you!

306
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:36,041
What awaits us now... is the
future she would have wanted...!

307
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:41,541
A world not hamstrung
by their tyranny!

308
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:47,958
All of this... will
never have happened!

309
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:49,541
Kurisu...

310
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,208
Forgive me...

311
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:57,625
Okabe!

312
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,541
You wanna know...
how I feel...?

313
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:07,875
Kurisu!

314
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:11,583
Okabe...! You should know
by now that I'm in l--

315
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:28,458
Mayuri...

316
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:30,791
Who is lab member
zero-zero-four?

317
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:33,958
Zero-zero-four...?
Hmmm...

318
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:37,166
Oh! A trick question.
There isn't one.

319
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:46,750
Behold...! The way is
clear! We're free...!

320
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:50,416
I, the mad scientist
Hououin Kyouma,

321
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,375
have triumphed over a
two-fold assault by SERN

322
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:56,666
and the Organization by
twisting the very fundamentals

323
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,125
of time and space!

324
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:00,375
The world as we know it
has been put to rights...

325
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:03,041
and a future of
chaos awaits us...!

326
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:07,583
This, my friends... is
the choice of Stein's Gate!

327
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:11,000
It's okay... Just be yourself.

328
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:13,083
Whaddya mean...?! This is me!

329
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:15,458
How else should I deliver
a victory speech?!

330
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:19,458
You don't have to pretend to
be Hououin Kyouma for me.

331
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:22,708
The bad stuff isn't
gonna happen to me now.

332
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:25,958
I can tell... you can
cry now if you want...

333
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,625
Go ahead.

334
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:34,833
We took apart the Phone Wave.

335
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:38,500
If we hadn't built it...
I'd never have met her.

336
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:41,250
But... it came at too
high of a price...

337
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,166
Too many people had to suffer...

338
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:49,625
Hououin Kyouma's
consigned to the past.

339
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:52,500
As are the tools
of his mania.

340
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:53,666
Life isn't about do-overs...

341
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:58,708
For good or ill,
you get one chance.

342
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:03,333
This is for the best...
Isn't it... Kurisu?

343
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,125
Hello?

344
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:13,166
Huh...? Wait, who is this...?

345
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:14,541
I'm your what now...?!

346
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:17,125
Okarin, huh?
Yeah--lemme get 'em.

347
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:20,666
Hey, Okarin! Phone!
It's some crazy chick!

348
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,083
Go ahead.

349
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:24,166
Please, get to the roof of
the Radio Building A-SAP!

350
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,125
Huh? Who is this?!

351
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:28,166
Listen! I came here from 2036!

352
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:31,625
I'm Hashida Itaru's
daughter, Amane Suzuha!

353
00:23:31,708 --> 00:23:34,791
Suzuha?! But--! What are
you doing here...?!

354
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:36,916
How is SERN still a
threat in your timeline?!

355
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,333
I'll explain when you get
here, but you have to hurry!

356
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:41,625
I need you to prevent
World War III!
