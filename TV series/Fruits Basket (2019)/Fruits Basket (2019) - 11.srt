[MAYUKO]
That's it. Times up.

3
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:20,646
No complaining.
Pass your tests to the front.

4
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,648
[YUKI]
Miss Honda.

5
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:23,815
How'd it go?

6
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:27,611
You know what? I think I did
much better than I expected to.

7
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:29,988
I filled in a lot more of
the blanks than usual.

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,198
[UOTANI]
Oh, yeah?

9
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,158
I'm real proud a ya, Tohru.

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,034
Thanks!

11
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:36,870
I knew it was within your
power to pass this exam.

12
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:40,082
Yuki tutored me, so he's the
one who should get the credit.

13
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:42,459
The way you explained
things was so clear.

14
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:46,088
Seriously, I couldn't have
done it without you.

15
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:49,550
Thanks, but... it was nothing.

[KINOSHITA]
Why's the prince blessing them

with such a cute smile?!

18
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:53,887
[IWATA] Dammit, I'm
too scared of Wave Girl

20
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,640
[HIROSHI]
Hey, Hanajima.

21
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:58,892
You're lucky you've got
that brainwave stuff.

22
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:01,311
Bet you ace every
test, don't you?

23
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:03,939
[YUSUKE] How'd you feel
about the midterms?

24
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:05,607
Oh, those?

25
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:08,819
Let's see. I went to special
tutoring for them.

26
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,363
After the test, the
school called my house.

27
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:14,950
Yes. I recall my mother weeping.

28
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:17,411
[HIROSHI] But, uh, what
about your wave powers?

29
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,871
The logical conclusion
is that I'm an idiot.

30
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,249
So much so that my powers
can't make up for it.

31
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,293
Eh, I wouldn't worry
too much about that.

32
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:25,836
At least you can be
sure you'll never be

33
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,379
the dumbest person in the room.

34
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:28,213
What's that?

35
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,757
For your sake, I hope you're
not talking about me.

36
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,218
Uhh. Dude, obviously I am.

37
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,636
[KYO]
I never took review lessons

38
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:36,930
and no one's ever had
to call my parents!

39
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:39,391
Yeah, turns out Kyon‐Kyon's
a surprisingly good student.

40
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:40,642
Why's that surprising?!

41
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:41,310
[UOTANI]
Weird.

42
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,979
So he doesn't suck at
everything that's competitive?

43
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:45,856
I'm gonna end every one of you.

44
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:49,526
I get it. Kyo's been holed up
in his room a lot lately.

45
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,945
He must've been up there
studying the entire time.

46
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:53,780
So it would seem.

47
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,157
[TOHRU]
For some reason,

48
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:58,160
imagining him hunched over
a book makes me smile.

49

Huh?

[YUKI]
Is something wrong?

00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:12,090
Oh. Uh.

55
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:16,219
No, it's nothing really.
I've just gotta work harder!

56
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:19,556
Swab, swab. That's my job!

That must feel good.

00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:57,612
[TOHRU]
Yep!

61
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,948
And it'll be a new term
after spring break!

62
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,367
It's kind of crazy
how fast time flies.

63
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,119
I know what you mean.

64
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:05,829
Oh. I almost forgot.

65
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:08,123
I'm going over to
Shii‐<i>chan</i> 's with you today.

66

[TOHRU]
Really? A special occasion?

67
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,626
You could say that.

68
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,421
I've got a little present that
I want to give you there!

69
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:15,922
You didn't have to do that!

70
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:16,923
What is it?

[MOMIJI giggles]

72
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:19,259
[MOMIJI]
Should I tell you?

73
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:21,470
Uh, <i>nein</i>, I think
I'll keep it a secret

74
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,054
until the perfect time, eh.

75
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:26,725
Well, I'm definitely
looking forward to it.

Welcome home.

I've never seen Shii‐<i>chan</i>'s

This is so exciting.

Uh! What is that noisy
brat doing here?

Ha! Did your bath make
you grumpy, Kitty?

You're gonna have to tone down
the hyper, you got that?

Somebody help! Kyo's
picking on me again!

[SHIGURE]
So, Momiji,

87
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,082
did you tell them why you're
staying over tonight?

88

[MOMIJI]
Mh‐mh. Not yet!

89

What day is it tomorrow?

Lemme think. The 14th?

[MOMIJI]
Bingo!

That means it's White Day!

00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:03,762
As my gift to you,

94
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:06,807
I'm taking you to a hot
spring so you can relax.

Surprise! He‐he.

There's no need for a title.

Which inn are you going to?

100
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:21,071
Well, there is one run
by the Somas, so...

101
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,405
Yeah. Makes sense.

102
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:25,575
[TOHRU] Um, a hot spring
is so expensive.

103
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,494
And I'd be going without Mom.

104
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:29,621
What would she have
to say about this?

105

Whoa, it's not that big a deal.
It's a little hot water.

a trip to Paris or something.

I know, but...

He's right!

And I'm sure your <i>mutti</i>
would be happy

00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:41,716
if you had a good vacation.

00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,302
Unless for some reason you
don't want to go with me.

112
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,013
No, I do. I'm excited!

[MOMIJI]
Yuki and Kyo will come, too.

It'll be great.

You don't get to decide whether
I'm going or not, ya brat.

Aw, come on, why are you
such a stubborn kitten, Kyo?

117
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:59,359
What about you, Yuki?
You're gonna go, right?

118
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:00,694
Yeah, sure.

119
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:01,903
Why not?

120

[MOMIJI]
Yuki knows what's up!

121

[KYO] That makes me
wanna go even less!

[SHIGURE]
Oh, yeah.

Sorry to change the subject,

00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,163
but I hear you're a
month behind paying

00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,124
your school trip deposit, Tohru.

[gasps]

127
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:15,876
It's all right.

128
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:18,461
I had a quick phone call with
your grandfather last night.

129
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:21,673
Apparently, your homeroom
teacher contacted him about it.

130
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:24,301
Grandpa said he'd be happy
to pay the balance for you.

131
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:27,470
[TOHRU] Oh, no. Please tell
me he's not gonna do that.

Last month I had to‐‐
Well, a lot happened.

133

But I can just pay for it
with the job earnings

134
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,186
from this month, so it's fine.

135
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,189
I've already told
our teacher, too.

136
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,524
[YUKI]
That's what that was.

137
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:42,652
Sorry about this. I didn't
mean to get you involved.

138
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,070
But I don't understand.

139
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:47,198
You work all the time, Tohru,
so why was last month any‐‐?

[KYO, YUKI grunt]

[YUKI, KYO, SHIGURE]
She spent her money

00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,744
on Valentine's chocolate!

143

Where's your class
going on the school trip?

You idi‐‐!

[TOHRU]
Ah! What?

The bath. Your turn. Go now.

00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,591
Huh? Sure. Okay.

I‐I think I'll go
and get cleaned up!

Who's a good boy?

00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:13,224
Managing to control
your anger for once.

152
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:16,478
We shouldn't be surprised.
That's our Tohru.

153
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,272
Of course she bought chocolate
supplies with her own money.

154
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:21,858
How could we not have
caught on earlier?

155
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,194
Because she smiles
to hide her feelings!

156
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:25,987
How were we supposed to know?

157
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:28,448
She shouldn't of felt obligated
to give us chocolates.

158
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,825
All it did was make life
that much worse for her!

159
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:34,454
She shoulda used it on clothes
or shoes or her trip deposit!

160
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:35,580
What an idiot!

161
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:38,333
She's gonna end up
drowning in debt one day!

162
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,670
At this rate, she'll miss out
on all the good stuff in life!

163
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,922
[MOMIJI]
Hey, you know what?

164
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,299
We had some free time
in class yesterday.

165
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:47,842
Huh?

166
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,762
<i>Ja</i>, so we ended up
reading a book together.

167
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,056
It was called, let me think...

168
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:55,141
Oh, <i>Funny Stories</i>.

169
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,518
We read a bunch of it.

170
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,228
One of the chapters in
the middle was called

171
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,939
"The Most Idiotic
Traveler in the World."

172
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,649
As you can guess,
the main character

173
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:03,900
is someone on a journey,

174
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:06,861
and she keeps getting tricked
by people she comes across.

175
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,613
That's why the author
calls her an idiot.

176
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,365
[VILLAGER A]
I can't afford medicine.

177
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:12,617
[MOMIJI] The villagers all
scam something from her.

178
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,577
[VILLAGER B]
I need money for seeds.

179
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,247
[MOMIJI] They swindle her
out of money and clothes‐‐

180
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,833
anything she has to give.

181
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,085
But because the
traveler is dumb,

182
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:24,546
she doesn't understand
what's really happening.

183
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:27,382
So when the villagers lie and
tell her she's saving them,

184
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,634
she starts weeping.

185
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,678
And she always tells them

186
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,390
"I wish you peace and happiness"
before she waves goodbye.

187
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:38,018
Eventually, she gives
away all her clothes.

188
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,395
And embarrassed to be seen,

189
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:44,774
she decides to travel
through the woods alone.

190
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:48,319
There, she meets many
demons of the forest.

191
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,531
They want nothing more
than to gobble her up,

192
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:53,616
so each one decides
to deceive her

193
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:56,411
with clever words and trickery.

194
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:59,247
As always, the
traveler is duped.

195
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:03,001
She gives away her leg,
and then an arm.

196
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,670
Before long, there's
nothing left of her

197
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:07,922
except for a head on the ground.

198
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:11,926
Her eyes are the last to go,
given to the final demon.

199
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,262
As the monster of the woods
chomps on her eyes,

200
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,806
it has one last thing to say,

201
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:21,436
"Thank you. Here is a gift in
return for your generosity."

202
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:24,105
But that, too, is a lie.

203
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:26,357
The so‐called gift is
just a piece of paper

204
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,152
with the word "idiot"
written on it.

205
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:32,322
Still, the blind traveler weeps.

206
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:35,075
"Thank you so much," she says.

207
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:38,244
"This is the first gift
I've ever received.

208
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:42,499
I'm so very happy. And I'm
forever grateful to you.

209
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,668
I can never repay you
for your generosity."

210
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,879
Tears pour from her
empty eye sockets,

211
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,006
wetting the earth beneath her.

212
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:52,759
And with that,
the traveler passes away,

213
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:55,929
dying in a pool of
her joyful tears.

214
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:05,313
Everyone else in our
class laughed at this.

215
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,190
They thought it was dumb.

216
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:08,650
But I didn't.

217
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:11,945
I just closed my eyes instead.

218
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,363
I thought about a traveler who,

219
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:16,407
even though she was swindled
out of everything but her head,

220
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,577
still cried and was grateful.

221
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:25,500
And what I decided was...
this girl was a lovely person.

222
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,752
Truly.

223
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,379
It's a waste of time
to think about

224
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,256
what you might lose in life.

225
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:35,218
And so the traveler paid
no mind to such things.

226
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,720
My classmates might think
that makes her an idiot,

227
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,305
but I don't agree.

228
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,891
She was just trying to be kind.

229
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:44,894
Even if other people think
it was okay to trick her,

230
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:47,897
I don't believe they're right.

231
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:49,691
All I wanted after
hearing the story

232
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:53,027
was for the traveler
to be happy for real.

233
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,990
So, Yuki and Kyo,

234
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,909
what do you think
about this character?

235
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:03,830
Was she an idiot?
What does your heart tell you?

236
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:10,044
[YUKI]
It says... that she...

237
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,216

I'll go with you.

238
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:16,301

you're having a good‐‐

to the hot spring.

241
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:25,768
I didn't get you anything in
return for the chocolate.

242
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,189
So as my gift for you, I'll put
up with that damn rodent.

243
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,857
Unless you'd rather
I stay back here

244
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,568
while the rest of you
go off on a trip.

It's fine.

The properness is part
of the Soma family, too!

due on the same day.

knows about the zodiac,

00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,391
You fiend!

314
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:11,809
How dare you say you wanna room

315
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,519
with the girl you brought
along on vacation!

316
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,480
I always wanted to believe
you were a good boy,

317
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,773
even though you're the Cat!

318
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,483
Eee, you lascivious beast!

319
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,443
This is a horrifying
turn of events!

320
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:21,152
For shame, Kyo.

321
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,779
You're the one
who's horrifying here!

322
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,822
If you won't apologize,
I'll do so on your behalf.

323
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,075
And not just to her,
but to the entire world!

324
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,786
Please forgive this child
for his many perversions!

325
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:30,620
[KYO]
But why?

326
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:31,954
I told you that's
not what I mean!

327
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,748
I take it back, I'm happy
sharing a room with Yuki!

328
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,167
Are we sure she's
in frail health?

329
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:38,378
[KYO sighs]

330
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:41,005
[KYO]
Finally, some peace and quiet.

331
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:43,674
Tohru! Aren't you so
excited for the spring?

332
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:44,300
[TOHRU]
Yes!

333
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:45,718
[MOMIJI]
Let's bathe together!

334
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,677
[TOHRU]
Okay!

335
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,513
You're the one with bad
thoughts around here.

336
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,307
Kyo! Why're you picking on me?

337
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:53,017
[TOHRU]
But Momiji's so little.

338
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,394
I don't mind if he's there.

339
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,604
[KYO]
What? Don't you talk crazy, too!

340
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:57,772
[MOMIJI]
Yuki, get him off me!

341
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:00,274
[KYO] Jeez, you little
wimp. Stop crying!

342
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,442
‐‐Shut up!
‐‐Please!

343
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:03,736
‐‐Quit wiggling!
‐‐I want to bathe with Tohru.

344
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,279
[YUKI]
Momiji.

345
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,573
Stop begging like
a spoiled child.

346
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:11,411
You didn't bring Miss Honda here
to make her feel uncomfortable.

347
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:12,537
<i>Nein</i>.

348
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,206
But we can still sleep
together tonight!

00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,291
[BOTH]
He doesn't give up.

350
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,670
[TOHRU]
This is amazing.

351
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,880
I've never been to
an open‐air bath!

352
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,633
I can just picture Momiji
doing laps around here.

[MOMIJI]
Motorboat!

354
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,803
[TOHRU]
First things first.

355
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:31,013
Ta‐da! Mom!

356
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,849
What do you think? Nice, right?

357
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,684
Can you feel it, too?

358
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:37,061
[PROPRIETRESS]
Oh, hello.

359
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:38,187
[TOHRU]
Hello, ma'am!

360
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:40,273
I hope the water
temperature's okay.

361
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,733
It's absolutely perfect.

362
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,861
What's that? Who is she?

363
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:47,363
[TOHRU]
This... This is my mother.

364
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:49,449
She died last year.

365
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,867
But I wanted her to
have the chance

366
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,869
to enjoy the hot spring, too.

367
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:57,039
My. That's the loveliest
thing I've heard in a while.

368
00:15:57,081 --> 00:16:00,918
Oh, I neglected to mention
this when we met earlier,

369
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,796
but my child is a
member of the zodiac,

370
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:06,424
like the young master
and the others.

371
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:07,842
The Monkey.

372
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:10,428
I just thought you might
be interested to know.

373
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,430
[gasps]

374
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:13,389
To be quite honest,

375
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:16,476
I was very concerned when
I first heard about you.

376
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,896
Our truth is something
we must protect.

377
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:22,773
I feared an outsider
knowing about the zodiac

378
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,859
would result in harm
to the Somas.

379
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:26,152
Particularly my child,

380
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:28,905
who has psychological
wounds already.

381
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:32,408
And I worried for the
other children, too.

382
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:35,953
But I'd like to apologize for
thinking that about you.

383
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,623
I can tell you're a good person.

384
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,959
And that you'll keep the Soma
family's secret to yourself.

385
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:46,047
If you ever meet my child, I do
hope a friendship blossoms.

386
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:49,842
Oh. Same. I hope
I have a chance to soon.

387
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:52,261
If you don't mind,
what is the Monkey like?

[PROPRIETRESS grunts]

389
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,015
Forgive me, I'm so sorry!

390
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:57,850
I understand the
world's condemnation,

391
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,644
but my only child is
precious to me,

392
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,479
and a deeply kind
person at heart,

393
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:04,273
despite what you may have
heard to the contrary!

394
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:05,525
Please, reserve judgment...

395
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,652
Never mind, you don't
have to apologize!

396
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,905
Ha! They sound like they're
having fun over there.

397
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,074
[MOMIJI]
That's right!

398
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:16,202
The properness is also
Ritchan's dear <i>mutti</i>!

399
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:17,703
Oh, yeah, the Monkey.

400
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,414
Ritchan lives outside,
like Shii‐<i>chan</i> does.

401
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,291
I'm sure you two
will meet one day.

402
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,209
Great!

403
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:26,420
Hey! Do you want to play a
round of ping pong with me?

404
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,548
I'm good, but those
meanies won't let me

405
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,341
join in any of their games.

That's out.

I told you, you have
to bounce it first.

Shut up, Rat!

410
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,308
Why would I do something
that slows down the ball?!

411
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,644
Because those are the
rules of the game.

412
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:43,980
Still out.

413
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,565
Again? Really?

414
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,984
I thought you could
compete with me for once,

but you remain hopeless.

We're finished. Done!

This sucks! Real men
battle with their fists!

suggested a ping pong war.

[TOHRU]
Um, well, maybe... I could play.

That face you made.

You put everything you had
into that horrible swing.

in front of me, you know.

I figured. But I don't wanna
laugh in front of Kyo.

[YUKI] Does it meet with
your approval... princess?

471
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:08,833
[TOHRU gasps]

472
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,251
Uh, oh, yeah.

473
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,169
Yes! Of course it does.

474
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,797
It's perfect.

475
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:15,840
[YUKI]
Pleasing you...

476
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,383
[gasps]

477
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:20,386
...is a great honor, princess.

478
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,933
D'you like the act?

479
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:32,189
[TOHRU]
He really is just like a prince.

480
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,736
[TOHRU] Actually, it turns out
there are a lot of princes

481
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,863
in the Soma family, Mom.

482
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:42,825
There are cool ones.
Ones that are cute.

483
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:46,412
And kind ones, too.

484
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:49,582
I'm so happy that I get to
spend my days by their side

485
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,584
getting to know them better.

486
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,335
After tonight,

487
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:58,090
I'm even more grateful for
what I have in my life.

488
00:20:58,132 --> 00:20:59,550
Thank you.

489
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:05,306
[PROPRIETRESS] I must
apologize for not being

490
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,891
a better host.

491
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,727
Please come again.
Sometime soon.

492
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,896
Why are you using
me as a crutch?

493
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,939
[TOHRU] Please take
good care of yourself.

494
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,399
The same to you.

495
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:16,859
Thanks.

496
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:18,360
[MOMIJI]
I don't see the bus anywhere.

497
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,154
It sure is late picking us up.

498
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:22,156
[TOHRU]
I'm sad, Momiji.

499
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:23,324
I'm not gonna see you as much

500
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,326
since we won't be working
together after the break.

501
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,243
Huh?

502
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,411
Oh, yeah!

503
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:30,039
What grade will you be going
into once we get back?

504
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,957
Are you starting
middle school yet?

505
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,250
[MOMIJI]
<i>Nein</i>!

506
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,003
I'll be starting high
school! Surprise!

507
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,171
I got special permission,

508
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:39,423
so I'll be going to your
school from now on!

509
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,175
Haru's coming, too!

510
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:43,761
[TOHRU]
Huh?!

511
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,012
[KYO]
Wait, you're what?

512
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:47,181
Why the hell would you
and Haru secretly apply

513
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:48,474
to go to our school together?

514
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:50,768
[MOMIJI] To see this shocked
look on your face, of course!

515
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:51,894
[KYO]
Seriously?

516
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:53,395
I get why they gave you a pass,

517
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,689
but I'm amazed they'd let
Haru in with his hair.

518
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,316
[MOMIJI]
Huh? What do you mean?

519
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:59,652
[YUKI] Miss Honda, it seems
you didn't realize,

520
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:02,279
but Momiji is just a year
younger than all of us.

521
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,280
The same as Haru.

522
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,907
[TOHRU]
Huh?!

523
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:06,951
I could've sworn he was only
an elementary student,

524
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,036
but it turns out he's coming
to our school in April?

525
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:10,120
With Hatsuhara?

526
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,497
I can't figure out
which part of this

527
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:13,666
I should be more
surprised about!

528
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,626
[MOMIJI]
How about everything?

529
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:18,295
[TOHRU]
It sounds like school will be

530
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,422
even livelier this spring.

531
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,132
And with more Somas!

532
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,384
[SHIGURE]
So.... what do you think

533
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,302
of the White Day gift I got her?

534
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,595
This old man will be thrilled

535
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:28,138
the day she wears
this around here.

536
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,057
Ooh. Maybe she'll
call me master.

537
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:32,768
One of these days you're
going to be arrested.

538
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:06,028
[AKITO] "You look like
you're having fun."
