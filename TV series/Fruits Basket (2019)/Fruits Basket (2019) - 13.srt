1
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:15,641
[TOHRU]
What will we be able to harvest

2
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,518
from the garden in May?

3
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,519
[YUKI]
Hmm.

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,022
Carrots, turnips, chives.

5
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:23,190
[TOHRU giggles]

6
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:24,274
Strawberries, too.

7
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:28,695
Oh, yay! It's almost
time now. I'm so excited!

8
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,697
So am I.

9
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:31,406
[TOHRU sneezes]

10
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:32,533
You feeling okay?

11
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:35,369
Oh, I'm fine. A little
bit chilly, that's all.

12
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,329
It's colder than
usual for April.

13
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,706
You should head back
inside and warm up.

14
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:41,500
I'm almost done here, anyway.

15
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:42,042
You sure?

16
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:45,003
[stomach growling]

17
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,463
I'm a little hungry, too.

18
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:47,839
[TOHRU chuckles]

19
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,925
Well, in that case,
I should get to cooking.

20
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:52,135
I'll let you wrap
things up out here.

21
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:53,762
[YUKI]
Great. Thank you.

22
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:59,476
[TOHRU] It's been a few days
now since I met Akito,

23
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:01,228
the Soma family head.

24
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,439
I was worried about Yuki,
but he seems to be doing fine.

25
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,149
Thank goodness!

26
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,234
[TOHRU]
Hm?

27
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:09,027
A pile of clothes?

28
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,155
What are they doing out
on the path like this?

29
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,741
It's almost as if
somebody undressed here.

30
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:17,160
[gasps] Could a zodiac
member have‐‐?

31
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,328
[gasps]

32
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:18,912
[TOHRU screams]

33
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:20,163
Oh, no, Miss Honda!

34
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,749
I heard you scream.
What's wrong?

35
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,544
There's something
under my clothes!

36
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,004
[TOHRU screams]

37
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:04,851
[KYO]
Man, I'm freakin' starving.

38
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,312
[SHIGURE] I bet Tohru
will be back before long.

39
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,397
Eh, whatever.

40
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,732
It's not like I can't make
something myself.

41
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:11,692
[SHIGURE]
If you're really hungry,

42
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,944
I've got something that
might take the edge off.

43
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:17,072
Let's have a little snack.
Delicious and nutritious!

44
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:19,783
Can't you find anything better
to do than screw with me?!

45
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:22,536
Kyo! How dare you waste
perfectly good food!

46
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,496
‐‐I'm ashamed!
‐‐[door opens]

47
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:27,165
Oh, look at that!
The intrepid gardeners have‐‐

48
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:30,711
Skin this revolting creature
and roast its reptilian corpse.

49
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,003
[SHIGURE]
Huh?

50
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,171
Oh, Aya.

51
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:33,755
What?

52
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:36,341
[SHIGURE] Well, this is a
surprise. What brings you here?

53
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:37,676
Um, Yuki.

54
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,636
I said skin this filthy
thing and cook it!

55
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:43,724
Now, now. Let's all stay calm.

56
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,475
This is Ayame Soma.

57
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:47,936
As I'm sure you've
realized, he's the Snake.

58
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:48,895
Yeah.

59
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:51,815
Snakes don't tend to do very
well in the cold weather,

60
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:54,901
so he transforms like that
a lot this time of year.

61
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:57,028
Winters must be hard on him.

62
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,407
See, there's me, Ayame,
and Hatori. All the same age.

63
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:02,743
So we've been together
since elementary school.

64
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,828
I like to think of us
as the Three Musketeers,

65
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,913
always looking out
for each other.

66
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:10,041
Wow. I had no clue.
That's adorable!

67
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,377
[KYO] Three Musketeers?
That's a dumb name.

68
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,546
[YUKI] I can only imagine
Hatori's suffering.

69
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,423
So, Yuki, are you
going to tell me

70
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:18,258
why we have snake on the menu?

71
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,719
It's too appalling
to be spoken out loud.

72
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:23,138
Oh, come on, don't
be so hard on him.

73
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,766
After all, he is your
own dear brother.

74
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:26,683
[TOHRU]
Huh?

75
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:27,684
[TOHRU yelps]

76
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:29,060
[AYAME]
If you'll give me a moment,

77
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,480
I shall explain the
incident myself.

78
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:34,900
I was dreadfully cold,
my body, weakened.

79
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,444
What choice had I
but to seek warmth?

80
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:40,030
When a warm human body
approaches me at such a time,

81
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,531
I must cling to it.

82
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:45,076
And so, acting on
instinct, I did.

83
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,328
Greetings, all!

84
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:49,956
Hello, Yuki. How have
you been, my brother?

85
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,374
[TOHRU]
It's grown‐up Yuki!

86
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,667
[YUKI]
Unacceptable!

87
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,796
Consider yourself lucky that
we haven't called the police!

88
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:58,590
Whoa, whoa. What did
that jerk do to you?

89
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,217
Oh, it's no big deal.

90
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:02,511
So Kyonkichi really
did come to live here?

91
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,763
[KYO] I told you not to use
that stupid nickname!

92
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:05,889
‐‐Okay, well, Kyonkichi aside...

93
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:07,098
‐‐[KYO] I said stop!
‐‐Okay, well, Kyonkichi aside...

94
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,892
It's been too long, darling.

95
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:10,185
Yes, it has been.

96
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:11,686
Did you behave yourself?

97
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,981
You better not have
cheated on me, you dog.

98
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,691
I would never do such a thing.

99
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:20,028
You know you're the only
one for me. Truly.

100
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,946
[BOTH laugh]

101
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,072
[YUKI]
Seriously?

102
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:23,365
[TOHRU]
Oh, wow.

103
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:27,577
He and Yuki may look alike,
but that's about it.

104
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:30,789
[SHIGURE]
So anyway, this is Tohru Honda.

105
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,833
I'm guessing you came
here to meet her?

106
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,167
Yes, indeed I did!

107
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:37,462
My apologies. Hello.
I'm Yuki's older brother.

108
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:38,630
Call me Ayame.

109
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,924
Um. Right. Uh, nice to meet you.

110
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:42,634
Oh, no, not at all.

111
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,553
The pleasure is mine, princess.

112
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:45,470
[gasps]

113
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,806
The lone belle in
this den of beasts.

114
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,809
You poor thing. A captive
among foul brutes!

115
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,270
No one's being
held captive here.

116
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,229
That's enough.

117
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:56,898
You don't need to make fun of
her on top of everything else.

118
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,233
I would never!

119
00:05:58,275 --> 00:05:59,234
Whatever you may think,

120
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:01,695
I am paying her
the utmost respect.

121
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,197
Make some tea, princess.
I'm simply parched.

122
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,241
And luncheon, too,
as quickly as you can.

123
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:07,534
[YUKI]
That's not respect!

124
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:08,451
[SHIGURE]
He's right.

125
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,871
That's how you treat
a servant, not a princess.

126
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,331
[AYAME] Is it? Bring luncheon
at your leisure, then.

127
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,500
[KYO]
That wasn't the issue!

128
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,961
Really, why must this
be so complicated?

129
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:20,297
All right, then. Come, Tohru.

130
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:21,131
Me?

131
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,800
‐‐[TOHRU] Uh, um‐‐ Ah!
‐‐[AYAME] We shall eat out!

132
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:25,969
No need to fear!
It'll be my treat!

133
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:28,513
[AYAME laughing]

134
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,728
[SHIGURE] I don't know why
you're upset with me.

135
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,984
[AYAME] Go ahead, feel free
to order whatever you'd like.

136
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,986
I'll be having the
gyoza lunch plate.

137
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:45,447
[GIRLFRIEND A]
I think he's a man...

138
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,782
Yuki and the others will
be fine on their own.

139
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,284
They're not helpless children.

140
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,870
I promise they can
fend for themselves.

141
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,247
Yes, but after all
they've done...

142
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:55,916
I just want to treat
you to a meal.

143
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,250
Is that too much to ask?

144
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:58,168
Oh, no! Of course not!

145
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,253
I mean, it was very generous
of you to offer.

146
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:01,379
Indeed.

147
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,132
Excuse me. We'll have
two gyoza plates.

148
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:05,133
Comin' up!

149
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:08,011
[TOHRU]
I'm just along for the ride.

150
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:09,971
[TOHRU]
Honestly, I'm surprised.

151
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:11,389
In all the time I've known him,

152
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,934
Yuki's never said anything
about having a brother.

153
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,645
[AYAME] It's not something
he'd be likely to mention.

154
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,189
As you can tell,
we don't exactly get along.

155
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,524
Actually, perhaps it's
more accurate to say

156
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,109
that we're not close.

157
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,654
There's a ten year
difference in our ages,

158
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,864
and Yuki was a sickly baby.

159
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:29,407
He was kept more
or less quarantined

160
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,242
from the time he was born.

161
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,536
So, basically,
I did as I pleased

162
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:34,746
and barely spared him a thought

163
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,582
beyond occasionally
remembering I had a brother.

164
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,125
[TOHRU]
Quarantined?

165
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,919
[AYAME]
By the time I noticed it,

166
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:43,213
the rift between us
had grown deep,

167
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:45,632
with steep cliffs
to either side.

168
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:48,385
Too wide to traverse.

169
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,719
Yuki seems well.

170
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:51,972
I heard that Akito came
to visit your school.

171
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,139
Um, yes.

172
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,100
That can't have been easy.

173
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,519
I won't tell you
the details myself,

174
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,563
but to Yuki, Akito is
a source of terror.

175
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:04,859
It's more extreme than the
fear the rest of us feel.

176
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,946
I worried he'd be depressed
after their encounter.

177
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:12,575
Honestly, I came to check in
on him more than to meet you.

178
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,786
But he seems to be
doing just fine.

179
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:18,164
Which was, frankly,
disappointing.

180
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,666
I thought I'd finally
have a chance

181
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,043
to act like a big brother.

182
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:25,296
Can I ask: Do you regret it now,

183
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:28,133
letting the rift grow
between you?

184
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,468
Funny how life works.

185
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,762
Things we're oblivious
to as children

186
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:37,100
have a way of becoming
painfully clear as we age.

187
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:40,729
Things we should've done.
Words we should've said.

188
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,647
Paths we should've taken.

189
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:46,526
If only we had, how
different life might be...

190
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:51,156
[AYAME] What I feel
may be less about regret

191
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,742
and more about repentance.

192
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,870
Perhaps if I atone
for my mistakes now,

193
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,998
I can let my younger
self off the hook.

194
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,586
Goodness. We adults sure
are arrogant, aren't we?

195
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,922
[TOHRU] You know,
my mom said something once.

196
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,924
She only understood
how parents felt

197
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,093
after she had me and became one.

198
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:14,012
Heh.

199
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,598
But she also said she knew it
was important to hang onto

200
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,185
her childhood self,
no matter how old she got.

201
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:23,688
She refused to
let herself forget.

202
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,399
The first time she did a
flip on the jungle gym.

203
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:29,152
The first time she
got yelled at.

204
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:30,945
She said if she
could always remember

205
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:34,783
how she felt as a child,
then even grown up,

206
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:38,328
she could talk to them
on a real level.

207
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,497
Maybe she couldn't
completely understand,

208
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,916
but she could still
meet them halfway.

209
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,628
[KYOKO] And besides,
life is more fun like that,

210
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,797
don't you think?

211
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,090
Wow, that was probably way more

212
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,216
than you really
wanted to listen to,

213
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,343
but basically what
I'm trying to say is,

214
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,512
you and Yuki can meet
each other halfway.

215
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,430
It's not too late!

216
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,100
[TOHRU]
I'm sorry.

217
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:03,812
It's okay, really.
That was actually insightful.

218
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,523
I know! My mom's the best
in the whole world!

219
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:09,859
[AYAME]
No. I was talking about you.

220
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:14,489
Anyway, I see why Yuki
seems to be doing so well.

221
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,950
And maybe there's
still hope for us.

222
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,619
I won't know until I try.

223
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:20,954
[COOK A]
Here you go.

224
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,748
Our food. Excellent.
Well, then, shall we?

225
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,291
Yes, please!

226
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:28,503
[AYAME]
Do something for me.

227
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:32,423
Continue being such a good
friend to my brother.

228
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:36,010
[TOHRU] For just a second,
he seemed different somehow.

229
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,304
[TOHRU]
Hello, anyone home?

230
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,848
Miss Honda. You're back.

231
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:40,473
[TOHRU]
Yep.

232
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:42,517
Did you three end up
finding something to eat?

233
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,560
[YUKI]
Forget that.

234
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,687
Did my brother do
anything to upset you?

235
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,313
[TOHRU]
No. He took me to lunch.

236
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,107
It was delicious.

237
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,483
[sighs]

238
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:53,027
[TOHRU]
Hey, Yuki.

239
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:57,031
I was wondering. Would you say
that you hate your brother?

240
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,032
[YUKI]
Uh.

241
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,994
[TOHRU] Uh, never mind.
It's really none of my business.

242
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,495
I'm sorry.

243
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,747
Well, I guess it's more that...

244
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:07,375
...I find him difficult.

245
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,377
I can never tell
what he's thinking,

246
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:10,879
and we're so different.

247
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,965
[AYAME] Then those are
obstacles we must overcome!

248
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:17,260
Now is the time for us to
meet each other halfway.

249
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:19,053
Okay, brother?

250
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,305
[AYAME laughs]

251
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,931
I'm sorry! But he
transformed again

252
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:23,016
right after we left
the restaurant,

253
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,726
and then he told me that
sometimes snakes can die

254
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,060
if they get too cold, so...

255
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:29,063
And we wouldn't want that.

256
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,816
[YUKI] You're no brother
of mine, you scum!

257
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,693
‐‐[TOHRU] Yuki!
‐‐[AYAME laughs]

258
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:35,945
[AYAME]
One cannot alter the truth.

259
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:38,781
[SHIGURE] Oh, hi.
When did you two get back?

260
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,451
[TOHRU]
Yuki didn't see it,

261
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:44,454
but for a moment
at the restaurant,

262
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:48,333
Ayame had the most brotherly
expression on his face.

263
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:57,425
[alarm beeping]

264
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,806
[AYAME]
Five more minutes.

265
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,475
[KYO]
I'll kill you!

266
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,311
[TOHRU]
Hm? Hm? Hm?

267
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:10,480
[AYAME]
I was left with no other choice.

268
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:13,691
Yuki locked his door and forbid
me entry into his room.

269
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,569
Well, Shigure's got a
room too, you idiot.

270
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:19,864
No, that wouldn't do. He never
lets me get a lick of sleep.

271
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,492
Careful now, honey.
Think of the kids.

272
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,619
[KYO] Just stop.
How much longer are...?

273
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:27,497
[YUKI] Ignore him,
ignore him, ignore him.

274
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:28,957
[AYAME]
Not to worry.

275
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,417
I can sleep in darling
Tohru's room tonight.

276
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,294
[YUKI, KYO]
Go home now!

277
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:34,462
[TOHRU]
If this keeps up,

278
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:35,838
I don't think the
rift between them

279
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,549
is going to go
away anytime soon.

280
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,678
[MOMIJI]
Really? Aya's visiting?

281
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:44,138
I haven't seen him
since New Year's.

282
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,932
He lives on the outside, too.

283
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:47,809
Oh, yeah? I didn't realize that.

284
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,978
Maybe I should come say <i>hallo</i>.

285
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,729
Oh, I wouldn't want
to get in the way

286
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,731
of their brotherly
bondage time, though.

287
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,316
It's "bonding."

288
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:57,402
[MOMIJI]
Was Yuki glad to see Aya?

289
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,362
[TOHRU]
Well... Heh. Umm...

290
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:00,905
There he is.

291
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,535
Uh. Yuki‐pukey...

292
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,453
You think so?

293
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,998
I get it. Totally.

294
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:13,126
The shop, though. Who's
running it while Aya's away?

295
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,961
I mean, he's the owner.

296
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:17,755
Nobody told me that Ayame
ran his own business.

297
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,633
It's true. He sells
wedding dresses.

298
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:23,803
Along with nurses' uniforms
and maid outfits.

299
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:25,888
So kinda like a... boutique?

300
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,642
It's a shop for men's fantasies.
That's what he says.

301
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,187
Hey, we're home!

302
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:36,316
‐‐Heavens, what good boys.
‐‐[KYO, YUKI] He's still here.

303
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,900
Coming straight home from
school without dawdling.

304
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,111
Were you that eager
to see me again?

305
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,112
Sweet of you.

306
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,781
Though personally, I'd prefer
more alone time with Tohru.

307
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,326
[KYO, YUKI] That's why
we're here, you creep.

308
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,077
You're looking at
a photo album, huh?

309
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:49,203
[AYAME]
Mh‐hm.

310
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:52,290
From our high school days.
How young we were!

311
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,042
See, Tori's there, too.

312
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,251
[TOHRU gasps]

313
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:56,586
Three handsome devils.

314
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:57,712
[TOHRU]
Yes!

315
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,714
Wow, so you were already
wearing your hair long

316
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:01,424
back when you were a teenager.

317
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:02,675
Indeed!

318
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,385
Though it was against the rules.

319
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:05,219
Huh?

320
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,764
Your turn, Yuki.
Come take a look‐see.

321
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:08,973
Get to know your brother.

322
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,516
Not interested.

323
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,143
Always so stubborn.

324
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,770
Very well, then.

325
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:16,189
You leave me no choice
but to tell the story

326
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,649
of why I was permitted
to keep my hair long.

327
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,609
[YUKI]
What?

328
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,693
[AYAME] Listen closely.
It all happened...

329
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:22,445
[KYO] This is what he
wanted from the start.

330
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,322
[YUKI]
I don't care!

331
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,491
[PRINCIPAL A] I may've let
your hair color slide,

332
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,951
but I don't remember
approving that length.

333
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,787
Get it cut before tomorrow.

334
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:32,038
But, sir, I can explain‐‐

335
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,081
[PRINCIPAL A]
I said no.

336
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,249
Rules exist to be
followed, young man.

337
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,211
I am a member
of the royal family.

338
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,295
Uh?

339
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:41,547
[AYAME]
I've kept it a secret until now,

340
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,674
but I'm actually
from another country.

341
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,094
What? What are you
talking about?

342
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,303
It's true.

343
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:48,638
The members of our royal line

344
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,890
must always wear
their hair long.

345
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:53,393
As was dictated by
a divine revelation

346
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,686
given to our first
king, Lulubara,

347
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,605
at the tender age of four.

348
00:14:57,647 --> 00:15:00,191
"Ma ludu muni,"
chanted great Kandla,

349
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,443
as his forehead
shone with light.

350
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:06,114
And in response, King Lulubara's
body was unleashed.

351
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,825
It lunged forward like
lightning, aflame,

352
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,077
his willowy hair
streaming out behind him,

353
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:14,288
like unto branches
in a soft breeze.

354
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,416
Well, you might wonder
where the great Kashipalu

355
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:17,542
was at this time.

356
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,626
He was in his chambers,

357
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:21,504
sleeping soundly as a
bud waiting to flower,

358
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:23,840
but then his heart suddenly
began to beat faster

359
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:24,966
and he spoke!

360
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:28,219
"Kampanil!" he cried out.
Now, you should know...

361
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,721
Right I just remembered an
urgent appointment I have.

362
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:31,806
Sorry.

363
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,599
I haven't explained Kandla yet.

364
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:36,227
It's fine! You can
have long hair!

365
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:39,313
And thus he was persuaded.
My locks were unshorn.

366
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,816
Wait! You're royalty
from another country?

367
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:43,818
How freakin'
oblivious can you be?

368
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,987
[SHIGURE] Mh‐hm. Mh‐hm.
Those were the days.

369
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,488
You're unbelievable.

370
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:50,658
But wait! I have an even
more unbelievable tidbit.

371
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,494
Aya was student
council president.

372
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:55,288
Really? That's amazing!

373
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,832
[SHIGURE] He was more popular
back then than you might think.

374
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,959
Sure, some of it was
due to his good looks,

375
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,921
but what really drew people in
was just how sensational he was.

376
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,923
[HATORI]
Stop messing around. Let's go.

377
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,593
[SHIGURE] He changed rules and
generally shook things up.

378
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,845
Suddenly, school was
a lot more fun.

379
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:14,015
Who knows? Maybe he had a
natural talent for leadership.

380
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,975
Oh. I'm not so sure.

381
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:17,810
Honestly, I always thought
Tori would've been

382
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:19,645
a better choice for the job.

383
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,856
So much responsibility.

384
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:23,232
Well, you know.

385
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:25,568
You remember the school
trip, don't you?

386
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,488
Sure. And everything
that came after.

387
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,907
"After"? Did something happen?

388
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,366
[TOHRU]
He's interested!

389
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,911
Yuki wants to know about
his brother's past.

390
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,787
This is real progress.

391
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,665
Now's your chance,
Ayame! Cross that rift!

392
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:43,169
On the trip, a few of
the students took a detour.

393
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:46,547
I'm sad to say, they paid a
visit to the pleasure district.

394
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:47,632
[ALL grunt]

395
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,091
Now, now, wait!

396
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,552
Don't pass judgment
without hearing their side.

397
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,429
Any red‐blooded boy
might find themselves

398
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:55,681
doing the same in
their situation.

399
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:58,100
And for what it's worth,
we didn't go along.

400
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,937
We were over that scene.
So last year.

401
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:01,771
[YUKI]
Did he...

402
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:04,023
[KYO]
...seriously just admit to that?

403
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:06,150
But, alas, in a
stroke of bad luck,

404
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,319
the teachers learned of
their transgression,

405
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:09,612
and they vengefully declared

406
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:11,948
that the students
should be expelled.

407
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:15,535
Of course, I protested this
in my capacity as president.

408
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:18,371
And so, a meeting was held
between the students,

409
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:22,375
their guardians, the principal,
and the teachers.

410
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,085
[AYAME] Minors such as
ourselves journeying

411
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,170
into a pleasure district
is certainly not something

412
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,881
of which we should be proud.

413
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:32,927
For if we do not uphold the
law, social order breaks down.

414
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:34,845
That said, I find it regrettable

415
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:38,015
that sexual desire itself
is being rejected.

416
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,434
Treated as a source of evil.

417
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,894
I ask you this:

418
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:45,106
What is sexual desire, if not
the force that drives us

419
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,650
to maintain the great,
unbroken chain of human...?

420
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:48,734
President.

421
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,486
[PRINCIPAL A]
Ayame's uncharacteristically

422
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:51,779
serious today.

423
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:55,074
[TEACHER A] So he was just
pretending to be an idiot.

424
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:57,785
And so, I'd like to make
the following proposal.

425
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:58,619
To the youth out there

426
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:01,497
struggling with
adolescent lust...

427
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:04,584
...suffer no longer!

428
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,501
That's right.

429
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:09,755
From this day forward,
direct your lust toward me!

430
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:12,592
[BOTH gasp]

431
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,343
[AYAME]
It is only natural that I,

432
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:15,928
the students' representative,

433
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,598
should bear the burden
of their desires.

434
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,516
And as these acts
will be between men,

435
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:22,518
there will be less
cause for fear.

436
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,479
Indeed. I know you
must be wondering.

437
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,565
Am I a "bottom" or am I a "top"?

438
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:30,151
Well, I am a bottom all the way!

439
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,236
[BOTH]
You're crazy!

440
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,947
The end. Quite a moving
story, don't you think?

441
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:36,490
Try "idiotic"!

442
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:37,742
[AYAME]
Excuse you.

443
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,119
They all escaped expulsion
thanks to that speech.

444
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:41,287
[KYO]
You're kidding, right?

445
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:42,705
It helped that Hatori stepped in

446
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:44,248
and smoothed things
over afterwards.

447
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,208
Now tell me, Yuki,
don't you feel like

448
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,919
you understand your
brother a little better?

449
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,212
[chuckles]

450
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:51,172
Get out right now.

451
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,257
[TOHRU]
The rift. The rift.

452
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,009
That didn't do the trick?

453
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:58,387
All right. Then I'll tell you
about the chairman's statue.

454
00:18:58,429 --> 00:18:59,889
It all happened one
warm summer day...

455
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:00,765
[YUKI]
I said get out!

456
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,683
‐‐I went to school only to...
‐‐[TOHRU] The rift! The rift!

457
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:04,310
[YUKI]
Shut up and leave!

458
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:06,812
Shigure! Do something
about this jerk!

459
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,856
[SHIGURE]
Hm? Why? This is fun.

460
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:10,483
Yes, I'm having a great time.

461
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,485
Well, you're driving
the rest of us crazy!

462
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:13,527
[sighs]

463
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:17,156
I can't help, anyway. I've never
been able to control Aya.

464
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:18,574
The only person he listens to‐‐

465
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:19,617
[HATORI]
Hey.

466
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:22,578
If you leave your door unlocked,
anyone can walk in.

467
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,746
[TOHRU]
Hatori!

468
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:25,206
[SHIGURE]
Speak of the devil.

469
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,875
[AYAME]
Tori! Why, what brings you here?

470
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:31,045
Hatsuharu. He told me
to come collect you.

471
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:35,549
You've had a nice, long visit.
Now it's time to go.

472
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,426
Come on.

473
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:38,678
Okay, bye‐bye!

474
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:39,553
[TOHRU, KYO, YUKI]
Huh?

475
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,806
Yuki, what with all
the commotion,

476
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,891
I fear we had little
time to chat.

477
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:46,352
But dear brother, worry not,

478
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:48,604
for I shall come
see you again soon.

479
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:51,357
[YUKI] That's exactly
what I'm worried about.

480
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:53,484
All right, Tori. Let us go.

481
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,069
Bye, Gure. I'll see you.

482
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:57,822
Absolutely. I'll drop by
your place sometime.

483
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,824
Farewell for now, then.

484
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,117
[chuckles]

485
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,326
[gasps]

486
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:03,744
[AYAME laughs]

487
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:06,330
Behave yourselves.

488
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:08,416
What the hell just happened?

489
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:11,252
[SHIGURE] For the most part,
Aya doesn't listen to anybody.

490
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,003
But he listens to Hatori.

491
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,756
He really does. Why is that?

492
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:18,718
[SHIGURE]
Admiration, he says.

493
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,971
Hatori has qualities he
wishes he had but doesn't,

494
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,889
so he looks up to the doc.

495
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:27,560
Their friendship has always
been very important to him.

496
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,562
Aya told me that
a long time ago,

497
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,814
and he was being serious.

498
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:36,485
I guess, what it comes down
to is that he loves Hatori.

499
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:38,571
[KYO] So because Ayame
respects the guy,

500
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,573
Hatori got stuck
being his keeper?

501
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,908
Also accurate!

502
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,452
[AYAME]
This must've been inconvenient.

503
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:45,995
My apologies for that.

504
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:47,705
[HATORI] Instead of
being sorry afterward,

505
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,874
maybe you should try
thinking before you act.

506
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,834
I assure you, I did.

507
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:55,379
Alas, I just can't seem to
get Yuki to open up to me.

508
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:59,925
Yuki isn't stupid or cold,
but he is still a kid.

509
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:03,179
There are some concessions
that he's not ready to make yet.

510
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,722
He'll come around.

511
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,727
[AYAME]
I like Tohru.

512
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:12,188
She reminds me of
you a little bit.

513
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:15,316
You'll both do anything
to help other people.

514
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:19,069
That's a quality
I find irresistible.

515
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:23,240
[chuckles] What can I say?

516
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:27,077
How do you always know exactly
what it is I want to hear?

517
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:33,417
[AYAME] Ah, Tori. Against you,
I'll lose every time.

518
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,379
[SHOW HOST A] I'm just saying,
I don't think...

519
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,923
[TOHRU]
It was a crazy couple of days,

520
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,758
but Ayame sure is fun.

521
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,676
[YUKI]
No, he's a hopeless airhead.

522
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,137
Uh, well, I don't know
if I would say that.

523
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:46,555
[YUKI]
Still.

524
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:49,600
He can admire someone for
having qualities he lacks.

525
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:52,853
Instead of being jealous,
he cherishes their friendship.

526
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:55,981
I think that's pretty great.

527
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:01,362
[KYOKO] Whatever happens,
we can at least meet halfway.

528
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:08,077
Haru.

529
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:10,120
Are you okay?

530
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:13,582
Yeah, um. It's just...

531
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:14,875
I wanna thank you.

532
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:17,753
For, well, you know,
worrying about me.

533
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:21,465
[KYOKO] And besides,
life is more fun like that,

534
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:22,466
don't you think?

535
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:23,926
[TOHRU]
Oh, no!

536
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:25,553
I forgot to ask him
what kind of store

537
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,388
sells nurse and maid outfits!

538
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,056
Now I may never know!

539
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:30,057
Whoa, say what?

540
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:32,309
A sex shop of some kind.

541
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,528
[MOMIJI]
"That's a secret."
