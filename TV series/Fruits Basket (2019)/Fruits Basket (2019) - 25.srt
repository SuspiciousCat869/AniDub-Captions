1
00:00:16,225 --> 00:00:19,686
[KYO] Why did he offer to take
me in all those years ago?

2
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:22,439
Did he pity me?

3
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:25,400
Was he ordered to?

4
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:27,069
I didn't know.

5
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:33,200
[KAZUMA] Now I may not look it,
but I actually run a dojo.

6
00:00:33,242 --> 00:00:36,119
You could try it out,
if you'd like to.

7
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,623
[SOMA WOMAN A] So Kazuma
really did take him in.

8
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:41,166
[SOMA WOMAN B] The poor man
shouldn't have to care

9
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:44,753
for that boy just because his
father couldn't handle him.

10
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:48,465
[SOMA WOMAN A] Imagine being
responsible for such a creature.

11
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:57,057
[KAZUMA]
Time for a change.

12
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:58,976
From now on, you're going
to breathe the air

13
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:00,727
of higher places.

14
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:02,229
Sound good?

15
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:07,192
[KYO]
And things did change.

16
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:10,946
For the first time, someone
showed me the outside world.

17
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,659
[KYO]
Helped me find my way.

18
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:17,744
And stayed by my side.

19
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:22,958
[KYO] Hey, you're what they
call a "master," aren't you?

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,792
What?

21
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:27,588
I mean, that's what they call
karate teachers on TV.

22
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,840
That's what you are. A master.

23
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:30,632
Well...

24
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:31,925
[chuckles]

25
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:34,219
Yes, I suppose that's true.

26
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:38,724
Although none of my pupils
actually call me by that title.

27
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:43,145
[KAZUMA] The two of you have
shown great improvement.

28
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:45,647
‐‐[DISCIPLE] Thank you, Sensei!
‐‐Uh, Master?

29
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:50,319
Hello, Kyo. Welcome home.

30
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:55,157
[KYO]
If only he were my real father.

31
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:58,118
This man who's done
so much for me.

32
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,369
[yells]

33
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:05,167
[KYO]
I wonder what Master would think

34
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,294
if he knew I felt that way.

35
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:10,339
For all I know, I'm just
some pathetic cast‐off

36
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,965
he took pity on.

37
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,928
Your father is on his way.

38
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,181
Or, I guess, I should
say foster father.

39
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:22,517
But whatever, you'd think he
would've raised you better.

40
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:26,104
[SOMA WOMAN A] Who'd want to
look after the Cat child?

41
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,189
[SOMA WOMAN B]
Maybe there's something wrong

42
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,399
with Kazuma, too.

43
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:30,776
[KYO]
Shut up!

44
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:34,613
He is not my dad, so you
just shut the hell up!

45
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:37,699
[KYO]
How much more can I ask of him?

46
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:40,035
I've already burdened
him enough.

47
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:46,625
Never act like Master's my
dad again, you got that?!

48
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:50,170
[KYO] I don't need him
to be my father.

49
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:52,422
Not if it's just gonna hurt him.

50
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,302
[KYO gasps]

51
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:08,855
Kyo, good morning.

52
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,441
Master. Where is he?

53
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:13,276
He went back to the dojo.

54
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,361
[KYO]
Huh?

55
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:16,988
[SHIGURE]
Tohru is walking him partway.

56
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,075
You mean... he left?

57
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:31,837
[KYO] Why'd you leave
without saying anything?

58
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,339
We didn't get the
chance to talk.

59
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,842
I didn't get the chance
to thank you.

60
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,096
[KAZUMA]
I'll be fine from here.

61
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:43,098
Thank you for the company.

62
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,351
[TOHRU] Um, do you think maybe
you should say something

63
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,353
to Kyo before you go?

64
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,567
What would I say?

65
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:56,486
You know, when I
first took him in...

66
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:59,114
...it was a form of
atonement for me.

67
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,034
[KAZUMA]
Like Kyo,

68
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:06,747
my grandfather was
possessed by the Cat.

69
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:09,416
He was cast out by
his immediate family.

70
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:12,627
Spoken of cruelly
by his relatives.

71
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,464
Treated horribly by everyone.

72
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,632
Myself included.

73
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:22,554
I'm ashamed to admit... I only
met my grandfather once.

74
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:24,765
[KAZUMA'S GRANDFATHER]
Hi, there.

75
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,057
[yelps]

76
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,852
[KAZUMA'S GRANDFATHER]
Kazuma, come here.

77
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:30,979
I'll give you a treat.

78
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:32,022
[gasps]

79
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:35,901
No way! I'll be cursed.

80
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:45,202
I understand.

81
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:48,538
[KAZUMA]
Such brutal, thoughtless words.

82
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,834
And yet, instead of
rebuking me, he just smiled

83
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:56,713
and offered me his forgiveness.

84
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:59,716
Years went by. I grew up.

85
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:03,845
And when I saw the way Kyo was
treated, the world he lived in,

86
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:07,933
I realized for the first time
how foolish we'd all been.

87
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,852
How needlessly cruel.

88
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:14,981
Taking him in may have been a
self‐serving decision initially,

89
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:18,151
a way to relieve the pain
of my guilty conscience.

90
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:25,158
[KAZUMA] Yet, before
I knew it... I loved him.

91
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,036
Like he was my son.

92
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:30,372
Like I was his real father.

93
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:37,504
[KAZUMA] When I took his beads,
I ignored his wishes,

94
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:41,216
and forced my idea of our
relationship onto him.

95
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:44,928
[KYO] He is not my dad,
so you just shut the hell up!

96
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:49,099
[KAZUMA] That's why I don't
know what to say to him now.

97
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,269
"Good for you. I'm so proud."

98
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,479
What right do I have to say that

99
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:58,191
after selfishly putting
my feelings before his?

100
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:02,070
It would be arrogant and unfair.

101
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:06,741
Besides, all I did was
create the opportunity.

102
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:10,829
You're the one... who saved Kyo.

103
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:13,164
You were there when it
mattered the most.

104
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,457
Thank you.

105
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:18,420
[TOHRU]
Master Kazuma, what you did...

106
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:21,172
...I'm not really sure
I'd call it selfish.

107
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:25,719
I know you think it was,
but the way you talk about Kyo,

108
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,306
it makes me feel so warm inside.

109
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:33,560
Relationships are complicated
and confusing sometimes,

110
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:35,937
and I won't pretend
to understand yours,

111
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,440
but for what it's worth,

112
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:41,860
right now, I think you sound
very much like a father.

113
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,154
[KYO]
Master!

114
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,954
Hey, Kyo!

115
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:55,081
[TOHRU gasps]

116
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:58,460
You left! You left
without telling me!

117
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,337
Why would you do that?!

118
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,381
It's like you're running away!

119
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:05,967
[gasps]

120
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,555
[TOHRU]
Kyo!

121
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,265
[KYO]
Tell me...

122
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:15,143
Did you think I was
pissed at you?

123
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:19,356
Or maybe... you're
just sick of me.

124
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:25,153
I've caused you nothing
but trouble. I know that.

125
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:30,325
I was being childish, wanting
to run back to the dojo.

126
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:33,453
Using you as a way to
hide from the world.

127
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:35,705
I'm sorry.

128
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:38,124
I've messed up so many times,

129
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,961
and I know I've still
got a long way to go,

130
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:44,965
but someday... someday
I'll be stronger.

131
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:49,344
Strong enough to stand
on my own. I promise!

132
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:51,554
I'll stop doing stupid stuff.

133
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:54,808
I won't hurt you or be
a burden to you anymore.

134
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,768
And when that happens,

135
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,729
I'll be worthy of
calling you my father!

136
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:03,608
I'll be that man, someday!

137
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,068
Watch me!

138
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:20,542
[KAZUMA] So many times...
we've passed each other by.

139
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,336
It's taken us years to get here,

140
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:26,923
but perhaps we've finally
managed to connect.

141
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,260
[KAZUMA]
And I know why.

142
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:32,262
[TOHRU gasps]

143
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,681
Kyo! You okay?

144
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,975
You're not there yet.

145
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:41,688
No doubt you'll cause me
trouble for years to come, son.

146
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:44,691
[KYO]
Yeah, maybe.

147
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:47,777
But you didn't have
to knock me down!

148
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,988
You couldn't block
a little shove?

149
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,948
Looks like someone's
getting sloppy.

150
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,408
[KYO chuckles]

151
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,868
[KYO]
Tohru!

152
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,286
You see that just now?

153
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,371
Uh. Um, yes!

154
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:01,041
Well? Was I right or what?

155
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,793
Master's unstoppable in a fight.

156
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,089
Yes. Yes! Yes!

157
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:11,259
You know, one "yes" really
woulda been enough.

158
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:14,554
Obviously I'm no match for him.

159
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:19,142
[KAZUMA] We came together...
after all these years..

160
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:23,021
...because you were here
to show us how.

161
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:38,578
[YUKI] There may be times
when I want to run away.

162
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,585
[SHIGURE]
So, with your master returned,

163
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:47,629
you'll be training
at the dojo again,

164
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,048
but why only three
times a week?

165
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,257
Because.

166
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,718
I'm glad that everything
worked out so well.

167
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,763
Okay, enough.
Just drop it already.

168
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:00,725
[YUKI]
Morning.

169
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:03,478
[TOHRU]
Yuki, you're up! Good morning!

170
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,938
[SHIGURE]
What she said.

171
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,981
There's some breakfast,
if you're hungry.

172
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,609
Thanks. It looks great.

173
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,033
[YUKI sighs]

174
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,159
[KYO]
Seriously?!

175
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:19,744
[YUKI]
You have Cat germs.

176
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,871
Uh!

177
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:24,082
Whatever, you smug rodent.

178
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,251
I'm not gonna let you
get to me anymore.

179
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,294
I'm changing, starting today!

180
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,712
[TOHRU]
I'm so proud!

181
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,631
He's working hard to
become the kind of man

182
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,967
he told his master he would be.

183
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:38,555
Well, this ought
to be interesting.

184
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:41,516
Let's see you try.

185
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:44,602
[growls] You girly‐boy!

186
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,854
[SHIGURE, YUKI]
That didn't take long.

187
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,605
[KYO]
You freaking piss me off!

188
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:51,192
Changed man or not, I'll hate
you until the day I die!

189
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:52,777
Go to hell!

190
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:55,363
And he's out.

191
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,699
So much for him being
a changed man, I guess.

192
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,741
[TOHRU]
Well, I don't know.

193
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,828
I mean, at least it didn't end
in a fistfight this time.

194
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,997
[YUKI]
Till the day you die?

195
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:07,750
I'll keep on hating you
from my grave, stupid Cat.

196
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,553
Oh, good morning, Yuki!

197
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:20,096
Same to you.

198
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,062
[TOHRU]
It's strange.

199
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,815
When I went to sleep that night
after everything happened,

200
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,734
Kagura was still there.

201
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:36,529
But when I woke up,
she'd already left.

202
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:41,451
[TOHRU]
And then... there's Yuki.

203
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:46,414
He seems distant...
and a little sad.

204
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:48,333
[HATSUHARU]
Honda.

205
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,417
Yo.

206
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:51,628
[TOHRU]
Oh, Hatsuharu. Hello!

207
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,504
He here? Yuki?

208
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,048
No. He isn't.

209
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,634
I'm not sure where he
ran off to, though.

210
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,136
Why? Is there something wrong?

211
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:05,391
Yeah, maybe. When I saw
him earlier, he seemed off.

212
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,936
Uh‐‐

213
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,647
Eh. Never mind.

214
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:14,192
[TOHRU] That night,
were the others watching?

215
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,236
Was Yuki?

216
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:22,617
Could he have seen... when Kyo
changed into his true form?

217
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,535
From what happened before,

218
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,580
I'm guessing that Kagura
already knew about it.

219
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,465
See ya.

220
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:38,675
Huh?

221
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:49,018
[HATSUHARU]
Something happen?

222
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,813
'Cause from the look of things,
you're not doin' so good.

223
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:56,317
Don't say that when I'm
fighting to move forward.

224
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:58,361
You're not really helping.

225
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:01,990
[HATSUHARU]
Fighting to move forward, huh?

226
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,827
[YUKI]
How's Kagura doing?

227
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,788
[HATSUHARU]
Dunno. Don't see her much.

228
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,582
I figure she's probably fine.

229
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,543
Why're you asking about her?

230
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:17,297
[YUKI]
Kagura.

231
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:21,134
You're leaving?
Everyone's still asleep.

232
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:24,470
[KAGURA]
Yeah. I need to go, though.

233
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:27,515
Tell Kyo I'll see
him later, will you?

234
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:30,810
Wait. Forgot who
I was talking to.

235
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:32,061
Kagura!

236
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,899
Uh, never mind.

237
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,027
You're silly, Yun‐<i>chan</i>.

238
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:42,530
[YUKI]
Always so strong.

239
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:51,831
[YUKI] Something happened,
but it's not for me to share.

240
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:57,253
I need to keep a lid
on things. A tight one.

241
00:13:57,295 --> 00:14:02,008
On his true form,
and everything else, too.

242
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:05,762
I have to keep it in. All of it.

243
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,181
Otherwise...

244
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:11,434
...those ugly feelings
will spill out.

245
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:14,812
Hatred. Revulsion.

246
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:19,233
They'll well up inside me...
until I feel like I'm drowning.

247
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:24,864
[YUKI]
And that can't happen again.

248
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:29,535
[HATSUHARU] You know, Honda
is really worried about you.

249
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,788
You didn't notice, did you?

250
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,039
No.

251
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:38,795
[HATSUHARU] You don't wanna talk
about your feelings, I get it.

252
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:44,050
But the longer you keep quiet,
the more she's gonna worry.

253
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,012
[YUKI]
You're one to talk.

254
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:51,349
I worry about how much you
worry about other people.

255
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:57,772
Fair enough.
But that's who I am.

256
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:01,859
I'd rather people have fun than
spend all their time suffering.

257
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,448
[YUKI]
Fair enough.

258
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,626
[YUKI]
Miss Honda.

259
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:19,961
[gasps]

260
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,129
There you are!

261
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,588
Some of the student
council members

262
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,882
were looking for you
a little while ago.

263
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,135
Sounds like things are really
starting to get busy for y‐‐

264
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,719
[YUKI]
Miss Honda.

265
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:34,225
I can tie my tie faster than
I used to, and it looks better.

266
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:38,020
And fewer of my vegetables
have been dying lately.

267
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:41,899
And, um, I talk to
more people now.

268
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,734
Some, at least.

269
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:47,071
These are small things,
I know they are,

270
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:48,781
but I'm trying.

271
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:53,119
I'm working hard to get better
at the stuff I'm not good at.

272
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:57,790
Basically, I wanna change
myself, little by little, but...

273
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:03,004
[YUKI] Someday, I want to
be able to open the box

274
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,923
I've stuffed all my
frightening feelings into

275
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:10,386
and truly experience them,
without being swallowed whole.

276
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:15,516
[YUKI] I want to keep the
promise I made that day.

277
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,353
[YUKI] But... I've got
a long way to go.

278
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:22,648
You've been worried,
and I didn't notice.

279
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,483
I'm sorry.

280
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,484
[TOHRU gasps]

281
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:27,195
Oh, no, it's okay!
I always worry.

282
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:31,282
[YUKI] I know I'm still as
lame as I've always been.

283
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:35,745
And there are still a lot of
things that I can't tell you.

284
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,997
Not yet.

285
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:41,709
Just know I'm changing
little by little,

286
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:44,378
so that someday...

287
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,298
...I'll have the courage
to tell you everything.

288
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,927
[TOHRU]
Okay.

289
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,434
Summer's coming up.

290
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:00,520
I think I'll spend more
time outside this year.

291
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:04,065
Heh. Maybe it'll turn out
that you like summer, too.

292
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,192
[YUKI]
Yeah.

293
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:10,404
Once I thought it over,
it didn't really sound so bad.

294
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:14,450
Watching fireworks, going to
festivals, visiting the beach.

295
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:17,495
Seems like a good season
to make memories.

296
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,872
Memories with you.

297
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:21,040
You don't want to?

298
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:21,958
Ah!

299
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,835
No! I mean, of course
I do! Don't be silly!

300
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,546
[YUKI]
You should know,

301
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:29,799
I'll kidnap you if I must.

302
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,759
[squeals]

303
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,348
Your face!

304
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,604
Miss Honda! A‐Are you okay?

305
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:45,022
[TOHRU]
Yeah! I'm fine!

306
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,692
Just a bump on the head.
You surprised me, that's all.

307
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,068
And I guess I
overreacted a little.

308
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:54,282
[YUKI laughing]

309
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:57,493
[YUKI]
Sorry. I shouldn't laugh.

310
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:59,453
Well? Home?

311
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:06,586
[TOHRU] You're not lame
to me, Yuki. Not at all.

312
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,046
Kyo and Yuki are trying so hard,

313
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:12,049
and they're growing into
such wonderful people.

314
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,011
It's like they change
a little every day.

315
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:18,639
And I'm not sure how much longer
my heart can hold out.

316
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:23,936
[GUY]
So that's Yuki Soma, huh?

317
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:26,606
He's as pretty as they say.

318
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:30,026
I guess. But he just seems so...

319
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:30,985
Huh?

320
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,028
[GIRL]
Forget it.

321
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,779
You're so weird.

322
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,282
You should show more
interest in other people.

323
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:38,993
Y'know, take a page
outta my book.

324
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:43,539
[KYO] So, uh, why is Haru
walking home with us?

325
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:45,499
'Cause I got a
dinner invitation.

326
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,876
Just tell me what
sounds good to you.

327
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,502
I can whip up whatever you want!

328
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:51,088
How'd we end up with
you as a dinner guest?

329
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,884
No one else knows. Just us two.

330
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:55,635
Whatever.

331
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,887
[KAGURA]
Guess who!

332
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,305
Kyo!

333
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,352
[KAGURA]
I'm so happy!

334
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,771
You didn't run away from
me like you usually do!

335
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,898
[HATSUHARU, YUKI] You didn't
really give him a chance.

336
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,941
Okay, then, off we go!

337
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,610
Where are you dragging him to?

338
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,779
Huh? Shii‐<i>chan</i>'s house!

339
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,406
He called earlier and
invited me over for dinner.

340
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:19,325
You, too? It's not a
freakin' restaurant!

341
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:21,327
[KAGURA] Oh, I almost
forgot! I'll be going...

342
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:23,996
You see? She seems fine.

343
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:28,542
She's fighting, too.
Moving forward, in her own way.

344
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,795
[KYO]
Just let me go!

345
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,421
That's it. I'm going
out for dinner.

346
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:36,509
[KAGURA] Stop complaining.
You know you're happy to see me!

347
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:40,304
[YUKI] There may be times
when we want to run away.

348
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:46,143
[YUKI] But we're fighting
through it. All of us.

349
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,649
[AYAME]
I shall tell you the truth.

350
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,901
When I received this
abundance of crab,

351
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:56,737
I knew in my heart that I
had to give some to Yuki,

352
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:59,073
and I hurried here
to bestow it upon him.

353
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:01,784
Not many would make such a
sacrifice for their brother.

354
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:05,329
But I shall, for my love
has no boundries.

355
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:08,999
Whatever's the matter, Yuki?
Your eyes look so distant.

356
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,711
Wait, I understand!
It's not distance at all!

357
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,546
You are simply overcome
with emotion in the face...

358
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:16,006
You can do it,
Yuki. Stay strong.

359
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,467
[MOMIJI]
<i>Guten abend!</i>

360
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:21,929
[TOHRU]
Momiji! Kisa! Hatori!

361
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:23,973
[HATORI]
Shigure invited us over.

362
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,392
[KISA] Hiro‐<i>chan</i>, too.
He'll be by later.

363
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:28,811
It's like a party! Uh.

364
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:30,771
Where is Shigure, though?

365
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:33,274
[HATORI] He had urgent business
at the Soma estate.

366
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,608
We passed him on our way.

367
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,402
The Soma estate?

368
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:38,863
I can't wait until
summer break is here.

369
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,656
Then I can stay
over every night!

370
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:41,574
[KYO gasps]

371
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,576
Not happening! No way!

372
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,327
[MOMIJI]
Huh? But why not?

373
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,579
[KYO]
How am I supposed to relax

374
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,081
with a hyper little
bunny hanging around?

375
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:52,376
[TOHRU]
Summer will be here soon.

376
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:56,255
It feels... like
something's going to happen.

377
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:58,674
Like something's about to begin.

378
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:01,510
Something important.

379
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:04,054
And it's wonderful.

380
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,473
I'm excited, too!

381
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,100
We're gonna do so
much awesome stuff!

382
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:12,229
Go to the beach. Watch
fireworks. Play split‐the‐melon.

383
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,397
And catch stag beetles!

384
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:14,690
Sounds great!

385
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:16,609
[MOMIJI]
You guys will come, right?

386
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:27,161
I heard you're clear to go home.

387
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:29,830
That's good, right?

388
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:32,458
You know, if you hadn't snuck
out of the hospital so much,

389
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,043
they might've
released you earlier.

390
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:36,879
[WOMAN]
Hiro.

391
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:43,719
I know now that Gure
is the only option left.

392
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:47,515
It won't be easy, but...

393
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:51,268
So you're not giving
up, then, Rin?

394
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,940
[ISUZU]
I'm never going to give up.

395
00:21:57,358 --> 00:22:02,947
[ISUZU]
The curse... somehow, I'll...

396
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:08,327
[YUKI]
I can feel it coming.

397
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:12,498
I don't know what it is,
but I feel it in my chest.

398
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:16,085
[KYO]
It's in my chest.

399
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,629
Expanding, filling it.

400
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,548
I feel it coming.

401
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:27,054
[TOHRU] Something so big...
it leaves me speechless.
