Yeah, but the way he's dressed,

00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,814
it looks like he's
going clubbing.

Kinda strange.

He could be lost.

There's a lot, sorry.

I guess I went a little
overboard with the groceries.

It's no trouble.

going to throw him off the roof.

a cold, that's why.

You do feel a little warm.

52

The quicker you
can treat a cold,

the sooner you'll feel better.

Let's see if I can find
you some medicine.

You should probably stay
home from school tomorrow

00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:42,087
I told you to be quiet.

159
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:42,963
[coughs]

160
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,674
[KYO yelling]

161
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,095
[TOHRU]
Huh.

162
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,972
Um, string?

163
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:54,641
[HATSUHARU]
Got one.

164
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:57,102
Oh, no! Are you okay?
That was a really bad fall.

165
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,187
Hey. What happened?

166
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,481
What in the hell was that for?!

167
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:03,024
[HATSUHARU] Figured it was
the only way I'd be able

168
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,567
to get you to stop.

169
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,528
[KYO]
Uh? Haru?

170
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,530
That was a very
dangerous prank.

171
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:11,324
Not everyone's skull is
as thick as Kyo's here.

172
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:12,867
Never, ever try this at home.

173
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,494
It still hurt, jerk!

174
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:16,371
So, it's your turn now.

175
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:20,333
Everyone's coming to visit.
Don't you have school, though?

176
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,918
[HATSUHARU]
Uh.

177
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,170
I set out from home on Sunday

178
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,965
and wound up in a neighborhood
I didn't recognize.

179
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,217
Somehow, three days passed.

180
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:30,510
It's a mystery.

181
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:33,179
[YUKI]
No, it's called getting lost.

182
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,305
[TOHRU]
Uh.

183
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,600
Uh... maybe we should find
somewhere else to talk?

184
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:40,061
[YUKI]
Agreed.

185
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:42,856
Miss Honda, this is
Hatsuharu Soma.

186
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,649
He's a third‐year
junior high student,

187
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,776
so one year younger than us.

188
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:49,529
Haru, this is Miss Tohru Honda.

189
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:52,365
Oh, that's who you are.

190
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:53,408
Nice to meet you.

191
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,744
Ah! No! It's my pleasure!

192
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,830
[TOHRU] Hatsuharu's so
polite and soft‐spoken.

193
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,207
He seems really
mature for his age.

194
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,960
So, you gonna tell us
what you're here for?

195
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,545
To fight you.

196
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:06,421
Huh?

197
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,131
[HATSUHARU] I was gonna
challenge you at New Year's,

198
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:11,593
but you skipped out,
so I came to you.

199
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:12,552
Now let's go.

200
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:13,928
[KYO]
Whoa, hold on.

201
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,431
I'm kinda in the middle of
an important race here.

202
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,516
[HATSUHARU] I traveled
three whole days for this.

203
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,143
[KYO]
No, you just got lost!

204
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:21,394
[HATSUHARU]
Come on, let's fight.

205
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:23,646
It's not gonna happen,
so just go home.

206
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:24,689
No thanks.

207
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:25,982
This won't end well.

208
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:26,816
Why?

209
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:30,070
Hey, Kyo. It might be a good
idea to go along with Haru.

210
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,738
[KYO]
I said no, and I meant it!

211
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,656
We're done, man. Leave.

212
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,663
Too late.

213
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:44,751
I'm not interested
in your petty excuses.

214
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:46,044
Now get up!

215
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:49,089
It's time for you to prove that
you're a real man, kitty‐cat.

216
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,049
Fight me and die!

217
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,884
‐‐[HATSUHARU cackling]
‐‐Could we skip the dying part?

218
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,220
‐‐[HATSUHARU cackling]
‐‐Damn brat!

219
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,513
[TOHRU screams]

220
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:59,099
That's wonderful.
He summoned Dark Haru.

221
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,475
Who's Dark Haru?

222
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,477
The guy's usually
a space‐cadet,

223
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,188
but sometimes
he'll totally snap.

224
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,233
We call that version...
Dark Haru.

225
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,692
[TOHRU]
Huh. I see.

226
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:13,113
So it's kind of like when
Kagura gets a little violent?

227
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:13,988
[YUKI]
No.

228
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,324
Unfortunately,
he's much creepier.

229
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:19,202
Don't just stand over on the
sidelines and watch, Yuki.

230
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:21,412
Today is the day that
I make you mine.

231
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,664
And do what with me?

232
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:25,416
‐‐Now, stand up, Kyo!
‐‐I'm already standing up!

233
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:29,295
Miss Honda, you should go on
ahead; this could take a while.

234
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,840
I should stay.

235
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:32,757
Too bad.

236
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:33,842
I thought you had a spine,

237
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,927
but I guess you must've
lost it at some point.

238
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:39,180
You are seriously messed up when
you turn dark, you know that?

239
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:40,598
Ouch, that hurt.

240
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,100
You better hurry up
and fight me.

241
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,310
I might decide to make
that girl mine, too.

242
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,187
What the hell's that
supposed to mean?!

243
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:48,481
[HATSUHARU] We'll spend some
time gettin' to know each other,

244
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:51,151
doing a little of this
and a little of that.

245
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,486
[KYO] What are you
even saying right now?

246
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:56,030
[KYO] This blockhead always got
lost on the way to the bathroom

247
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,575
when we were kids,
so I had to walk him there.

248
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,410
And this is how he repays me?

249
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:02,996
And anyway, what's "a little
of this and a little of that"?

250
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:06,291
Whatever it is, girls have
nothin' to do with this.

251
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:11,629
Still, for some reason,
I'm extra pissed off now.

252
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,173
[KYO]
That's it, you damn brat!

253
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,883
Stop! Please!

254
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,596
There! That's what you
shoulda done from the start,

255
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:20,638
you pathetic coward!

256
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,600
Come here, bastard. I'm gonna
punch your damn teeth in!

257
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,810
No, seriously. I'd get going.

258
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,729
This'll definitely
take some time.

259
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,898
I can't, 'cause Kyo...

260
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,817
Hey, don't just sit there.

261
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:35,069
Yeah, at least run a few meters.

262
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,488
[KYO, HATSUHARU yelling]

263
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,489
Let's go!

264
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,283
It's your funeral, kitty!

265
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:41,784
Try throwing a punch, loser!

266
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,745
[KYO] You can talk as much
trash as you want to‐‐

267
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,413
‐‐it isn't gonna save you.
‐‐Oh, yeah?

268
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:46,789
[TOHRU]
It's like we've been transported

269
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,499
into a martial arts movie.

270
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,500
Um, guys?

271
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:54,255
It's okay. Really. They'll wear
themselves out eventually.

272
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:56,424
Besides, I don't know about you,

273
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:59,427
but I would greatly prefer not
to get caught in the crossfire.

274
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:00,511
[TOHRU]
Yeah, right.

275
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,804
[bang]

276
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,605
That punch! Kyo seems
really strong today.

277
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:14,943
Yeah. I would say he's probably
the stronger of the two.

278
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,362
They've both studied martial
arts since they were kids,

279
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,113
and they appear to enjoy it.

280
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,448
[coughs]

281
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,366
Well, of course.

282
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:25,119
Didn't you study it because
you enjoyed it, too?

283
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,663
Maybe.

284
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,042
[YUKI]
It's hard to say.

285
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,877
[gasps]

286
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,379
Huh? Is there something wrong?

287
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:38,341
What happened, Soma?
Please say something!

288
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:39,550
Soma, please! Answer me!

289
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,219
Yuki! An attack?

290
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,763
Man, you're really burning up.

291
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:45,765
I'll call the main house and‐‐

292
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,561
No, you don't wanna do that?

293
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,980
Huh.

294
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:56,025
Kyo, is it okay if I take
a rain check on our fight?

295
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:57,694
Uh. Yeah, sure.

296
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:00,196
I think our best bet is
Sensei's house, then.

297
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,740
We could take a taxi there.

298
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,117
No, that's out.

299
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:07,829
In this condition,
Yuki might transform.

300
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,789
[TOHRU]
Is there some way I can help?

301
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:12,625
Please, I'll do anything!

302
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:15,545
Yeah, all right. I think
I'll take you up on that.

303
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,755
It's a good thing you're cute.

304
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:18,881
[TOHRU]
Huh?

305
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,508
I'm saying if I'm
gonna hug someone,

306
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,761
I'd prefer it be a
cute girl like you.

307
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:24,971
[gasps]

308
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:28,933
Uh, 'scuse me,
what are you doing?

309
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:31,102
Ask permission first, you jerk.

310
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:34,564
[HATSUHARU] It'll be easier on
Yuki if I carry him this way.

311
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:38,109
You'll have to keep holding
onto me so I don't turn back.

312
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,319
[TOHRU yelps]

313
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,868
[moos]

314
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,458

00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:01,051
Okay, then. A test.

472
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,386
[TOHRU]
Uh?

473
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,431
[HATSUHARU]
Try calling him by...

474
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:08,684
[TOHRU] Really? Are you
sure that's a good idea?

475
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,937
You're here, Miss Honda?

476
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:14,273
Yes! I'm so glad you're awake!

477
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:15,441
I transformed!

478
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:17,860
Careful! You shouldn't
push yourself.

479
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:20,488
Hold on. How did I get home?

480
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:23,949
Simple. Hatsuharu transformed
so he could carry you.

481
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:27,328
Oh. Thanks, Haru.

482
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,330
I told her how
much I love you.

483
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,040
I just thought you should know.

484
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:34,043
[YUKI] Why would you tell her
something ridiculous like that?

485
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:36,462
What if she actually
takes you seriously?

486
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:37,838
[HATSUHARU]
I am serious.

487
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,133
And besides, I think
it's a really sweet story.

488
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:43,552
Don't you... Yuki?

489
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:45,513
Come, now. You don't‐‐

490
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:46,597
[gasps]

491
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,477
[TOHRU]
Hatsuharu.

492
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:54,688
I think it's safe to say
that I failed the test.

493
00:21:56,273 --> 00:22:00,277
[HATSUHARU] Try calling
him by his given name.

494
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,154
It'll make him happy.

495
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,574
[TOHRU] And so the day
of the marathon ended

496
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:08,118
without anything
going too wrong.

497
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,787
Ha! Three of a kind!

498
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,580
I've got a full house.

499
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:14,917
[HANAJIMA] Meanwhile,
I have five of a kind.

500
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:16,710
Ah! How'd I lose again?!

501
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,129
‐‐[YUSUKE] She's too good.
‐‐I want one more round!

502
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,005
[TOHRU]
That night,

503
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:23,592
Yuki wasn't the only one
in bed with a cold.

504
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:24,844
Well, what do you expect

505
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:27,596
when you play poker
outside all day?

506
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:31,183
[HATORI] Obviously, the family
is trying to work me to death.

507
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:06,695
[KAGURA]
"It's Valentine's, after all!"
