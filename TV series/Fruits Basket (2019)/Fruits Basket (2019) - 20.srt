As you should be.

This is a welcome

own struggles to overcome, huh?

Try again. It's evening now.

Why can't you sleep
like a normal person?

But that's precisely
why I became a writer.

So I wouldn't have to. Uh.

What have I done to deserve such

Let the poor thing go.
You'll contaminate her.

It's easier now. Trying, I mean.

Oh, right.

She's actually having a little
sleepover at Shigure's house.

Would you dance if
I said to dance?

No?

Well, are you going
to give that back?

Come on. Couldn't you at least
make an effort to be polite?

here to meet you.

Huh? But why would you‐‐?

hurt your tiny brain?

just stayed at home.

for the inconvenience.

be late for my shift at work,

mooching off a kid.

child to fill your own stomach?

to be ashamed of yourself.

too bad, though.

we'll meet again.

boring experience.

There's a picture of
my mother... in there.

113
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:13,915
My mom was just kidnapped
by a member of the zodiac.

114
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:16,793
She's gone. I need
to get her back.

115
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:19,880

to work on time right now.

Why are you sitting in the
middle of the sidewalk?

Momiji, it's gone.

119
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,640
[MOMIJI] Whatever it is must be
important. You look so lost.

So she's a mama's girl, huh?

121
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,734
What a loser.

What the heck are you
hangin' around here for?

124
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,781
[HIRO] I don't see why
it's any of your business.

125
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,576
Wait, hold on. Are you saying
that I can't sit here?

126
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:51,620
I need your permission
all of a sudden?

127
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,121
You must think pretty
highly of yourself,

128
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:54,664
giving orders like that.

129
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:57,042
Ha! Everyone bow
before King Kyo.

130
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,085
[KYO]
Okay, brat, cut the crap.

131
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,713
I don't have to listen to this
from some stupid little kid.

132
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:04,007
Real mature, losing your
temper with some "kid."

133
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:06,384
Agh! I'm gonna punch
you into next week!

134
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,594
[TOHRU]
Hiro!

135
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,932
My pocketbook. I need‐‐

136
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,600
What's wrong?

137
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:16,186
[TOHRU]
I need my pocketbook.

138
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,605
Mom's in there.

139
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:20,982
Hiro! What did you do to her?

140
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,109
It sounds like you're
accusing me without proof.

141
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,402
In which case, I hope
you're prepared

142
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,821
to make restitution
if I'm innocent.

143
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,740
All I did was take
her pocketbook.

144
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,825
[KYO] Then obviously
you're not innocent!

145
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,077
Give it back right now!

146
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,328
Why should I, though?

147
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:36,373
That idiotic girl practically
begged me to take it.

148
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,874
All right, that's enough!

149
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,210
Shut your mouth
before I do it for you.

00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,340

Please say no.

00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,018
Ah, Kisa, what a fun surprise!

00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,023
[HIRO]
Someone fetched her.

160
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,775
It seems the Rabbit's
been sticking his nose

161
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,026
where it doesn't belong.

162
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,778
So it's true?

163
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,905
But stealing is wrong.

164
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:11,950
You have to give back
what you took from Tohru,

165
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:14,077
or she'll be sad.

166
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:19,290
[KISA]
Will you? Please?

167
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,875
[HIRO]
This is dumb.

168
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,420
I don't even want
this thing. Take it!

169
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,296
<i>Das ist keine Art</i>!

170
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,339
Hiro!

171
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:28,675
[TOHRU] No, it's okay.
Everything's fine now.

172
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:30,885
It's not fine!

173
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:35,390
[KISA] Hiro‐<i>chan</i>, tell me:
Why did you do that?

174
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:39,185
I don't like it when you do
things that make people sad.

175
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,771
It's mean.

176
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:44,107
What's so great
about her, anyway?

177
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:45,608
It's like that idiot
is the only thing

178
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,902
you can talk about these days.

179
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:52,032
You even took the <i>Mogeta</i> DVD
straight to her place to watch.

180
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,242
I lent it to you.

181
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:57,037
I was gonna watch it with you.

182
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,455
I don't understand.

183
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:01,041
It didn't seem like you
wanted to watch it before.

184
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,668
I figured you wouldn't care.

185
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,254
[HIRO] I'm not interested in
this, but you like it, right?

186
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:08,673
You can borrow it.
It's nothing I'd watch.

187
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:12,510
Seriously? Do I have to spell
out everything? Just think!

188
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,304
She's not a mind reader.

189
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:17,015
[HIRO]
Shut up, bunny boy!

190
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,726
I mean, I know I couldn't
do anything to help

191
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:22,312
when you were going
through all that stuff.

192
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:26,357
But still... I was worried.

193
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,151
Really worried.

194
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:31,279
And I just felt so helpless.

195
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:32,572
[gasps]

196
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,788
Any idea what's going on?

197
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,498
You're so dense, Kyo.

198
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:42,957
‐‐Huh?
‐‐Isn't it obvious?

199
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,793
Hiro was jealous of Tohru.

200
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,127
He's trying, but...

201
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:48,671
You remember what sixth
grade was like, right?

202
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,757
Feelings are scary.

203
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,803
[KISA]
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

204
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:59,432
We'll watch it together.
Next time, okay?

205
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,229
So he lashed out because
he thought he had

206
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,439
a rival for Kisa's affection.

207
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:08,358
I wouldn't want to
be in your shoes.

208
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,442
Huh?

209
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:10,819
There's one more thing.

210
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,154
I want you to tell Tohru
that you're sorry.

211
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:15,323
She's right, Hiro. Do it.

212
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:18,743
Tohru is late to work
because of you.

213
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,704
Actually, an apology's
not enough.

214
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:24,457
I think Hiro needs to
be punished for this.

215
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:25,792
You do, do you?

216
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:28,711
And what's this
"punishment" gonna be?

217
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,881
[TOHRU] I sentence you
to the hug penalty!

218
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:34,676
Come on. What kinda
punishment is that?

219
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:35,677
[MOMIJI chuckles]

220
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,721
I guess she couldn't wait
to find out what year he is!

221
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,640
[giggles]

222
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:45,645
You're forgiven. I'm so glad
I got to meet you, Hiro!

223
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:50,150
[TOHRU] I met a new member
of the zodiac today, Mom.

224
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:55,530
I can tell he's super smart,
but he's still so young.

225
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,866
And it turns out he's in love‐‐

226
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:01,202
in the most adorably
awkward way.

227
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,000
[DEMON LORD A laughs]

228
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,168
[DEMON LORD A]
Look at you, Art.

229
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,712
Trembling in the
face of my power!

230
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,172
As you should be.

231
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,673
This is a welcome
change from home,

232
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:16,926
where my wife rules with
an iron fist and no mercy!

233
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:18,428
What, so he'd quit being a jerk

234
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,638
if his wife was a little
bit nicer to him?

235
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,516
Does it not occur to this guy
that maybe he just sucks?

236
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:26,227
The character development
in this show is lacking.

237
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:30,064
Perhaps we could all just keep
our insights to ourselves.

238
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:30,899
[HIRO]
Well?

239
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,444
How long are you gonna make me
wait for another cup? Fill it.

240
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,863
Unless you were intentionally
depriving me?

241
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,865
No! I didn't notice
it was empty.

242
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:42,827
Like you even care. I can't
stand inconsiderate people.

243
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,120
Be nice.

244
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:46,331
It's fine. I don't mind, really.

245
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,875
[HIRO] It's not fine.
You should be more observant.

246
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:50,043
Right! I'll do my best.

247
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,921
[KYO] Hey, stop treating
her like she's a servant.

248
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,715
You're a guest in this house,
so try actin' like it.

249
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:58,801
And why are you spending all
your days off here, anyway?

250
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,930
Isn't there anyone else
you can go and annoy?

251
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,348
[HIRO]
Did I miss something?

252
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,474
'Cause last time I checked,

253
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,351
the Cat wasn't the
master of this house.

254
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,353
What are you contributing
that gives you the right

255
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,979
to complain about it?

256
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:12,315
People who whine about their
situation while accepting

257
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,984
no responsibility
are so irritating.

258
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:18,112
[KYO]
I wanna punch this kid so hard.

259
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,114
[HIRO] Any snot‐nosed brat
can point out an issue

260
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,033
without solving it.

261
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,077
[KYO] I'm lookin' at a
snot‐nose brat right now!

262
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,871
[SHIGURE] Okay, stop.
Go easy on the boy.

263
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:29,958
It's only a phase. Some
pre‐teen rebelliousness.

264
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:30,792
Oh, yeah?

265
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,961
Well, he can go rebel at
the main estate, then!

266
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,713
And preferably do all of
his flirting there, too!

267
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:36,965
Don't be cruel.

268
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,884
That sort of thing is already
difficult enough for any kid.

269
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,553
Being a member of the
zodiac just makes it harder.

270
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,139
Flirting's not easy in
or out of the compound.

271
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:48,643
It takes determination
and skill. Y'know?

272
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:49,811
[TOHRU]
Huh?

273
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,020
[SHIGURE]
Anyway, you shouldn't let him

274
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:52,563
put your back up like that.

275
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,940
Losing your temper only proves

276
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:56,109
that you're still in
your rebellious phase.

277
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:56,943
[KYO]
Tch.

278
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:59,279

[MITSURU]
"Adult"?

280
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,700
In what world does a man
who can't meet his deadlines

281
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:04,909
count as an adult?

282
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:05,618
Hello.

283
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,413
She was at the door, seconds
away from hanging herself.

00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,580
Tell me why!

285
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,959
Why won't you finish on time
no matter how much I beg you?

286
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:14,877
[SHIGURE]
It's a real mystery, isn't it?

287
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,129
We may never know.

[SHIGURE]
Okay, okay. I'll do it.

Oh! I just remembered
a pressing errand.

Don't worry. I'll be right back.

No, wait! Whatever it is,
do it later! Sensei...

It's so noisy.

What's it take to get some
peace and quiet around here?

298
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:40,945
More tea. I'm still thirsty.

00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,697
I told you to stop that!

00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,751
That's definitely in short
supply these days.

kinda mean around Tohru.

Dunno. Yeah, maybe.

always wanna come over here?

For you.

310
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,523
I may not like her, but you do.

You're right.

I get this warm feeling inside,
just from being around her.

315
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,464
[HIRO]
Bathroom.

316
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:52,058
I'm sorry. He, um,
really is a nice person.

317
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:52,809
[TOHRU chuckles]

318
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:56,938
You two seem so close. You
must be friends from way back.

319
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,899
[KISA]
Actually, for a long time,

320
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:03,361
I thought Hiro‐<i>chan</i> hated me.

321
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:07,740
About a year ago, we would
play together all the time.

322
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:10,493
But then...

323
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:14,831
...he suddenly started
ignoring me, completely.

324
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,874
And I didn't know why.

325
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:22,213
[KISA] So when he said that
stuff earlier, I was surprised.

326
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:25,633
[HIRO]
I was worried. Really worried.

327
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:29,345
And happy.

328
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:31,806
It must've been nice to hear.

329
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:34,851
[HIRO]
Hey.

330
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,561
Oh! I didn't realize
you were back.

331
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,104
The tea is ready
if you'd like some.

332
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:40,148
You're off today.
I'm bored here.

333
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,941
You should take us out.
Somewhere fun.

334
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:43,901
Um, okay, where would
you like to go?

335
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:47,113
Really? You can't even decide
that much for yourself?

336
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:49,115
Don't you have opinions
about anything?

337
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:51,200
Or are you happy
to blithely walk along

338
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:53,369
whatever path others
set out for you?

339
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:54,954
Wow! That must be an easy life,

340
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:57,081
letting everyone else
take the initiative.

341
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,708
I'm sorry.

342
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:05,381
[HATORI] Whether out of
ignorance or innocence,

343
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:07,925
Hiro must not have realized
how Akito would react

344
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,344
to what he was going to say.

345
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,679
And likely thought it was safer

346
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:15,099
than staying silent
on the matter.

347
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:18,519
[HIRO]
I love her. I love Kisa.

348
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:20,313
[HATORI]
You can guess the result.

349
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:24,066
It took Kisa two weeks to heal
after Akito was done with her.

350
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:27,361
I can only imagine what
kind of shape she was in.

351
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,696
[HATORI]
From the sound of it,

352
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:33,659
Hiro avoided her as much
as possible after that.

353
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,328
Which means he wasn't
around to help

354
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:38,539
when Kisa's classmates
started bullying her.

355
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,501
A person Hiro loved
got badly hurt

356
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,085
because of something he did.

357
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,087
Anyone would be scared.

358
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:48,466
And now, he's probably furious
with himself for what happened,

359
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:51,469
but he doesn't know
what to do with that rage.

360
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,930
It's not as if he
can blame Akito.

361
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:57,266
So he's taking it out on
poor, innocent Tohru instead.

362
00:16:57,308 --> 00:17:00,102
Another victim of
youthful folly. Tragic.

363
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,687
[HATORI]
I'm surprised, though.

364
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,356
By what?

365
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:06,526
I assumed you would've known
about this long before now.

366
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:09,695
I thought Akito told you about
anything concerning the family.

367
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:10,530
[SHIGURE laughs]

368
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:13,908
Apparently even I am
only trusted so far.

369
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:16,744
Let Akito scheme.

370
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:18,329
[HATORI]
Hm?

371
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:21,832
When the dust settles,
one of us will be sorry.

372
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,960
But it won't be me.

373
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:26,921
You're a child.

374
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:31,259
[SHIGURE] Yes. I'm disgustingly,
unrepentantly immature.

375
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,385
I worry what will happen

376
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:35,304
if Akito eventually does
take it out on Honda.

377
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:37,598
Like Hiro did.

378
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,769
I have to say, we really
are terrible at this.

379
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:43,521
The whole "love" thing.

380
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:46,315
When it comes to cherishing
another person,

381
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:48,901
we Somas are lost.

382
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:53,864
[HIRO]
This is just a park.

383
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,658
[TOHRU]
Yep! Cool, huh?

384
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,409
Uh, no.

385
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,786
You could've taken us to a
movie or an amusement park,

386
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:01,539
but your pea‐sized brain chose
this dump of a place instead.

387
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:02,582
Are you kidding?

388
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,916
[TOHRU]
Well, honestly,

389
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,459
I don't have a lot
of money right now,

390
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,878
so this is the best I could do.

391
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,172
It's great! I like
coming to the park.

392
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,632
Fine, I forgive you.

393
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:14,552
I appreciate it. Thank you.

394
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,596
Look! There's a
crepe truck here.

395
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,472
Would you guys like to get some?

396
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,099
Kisa, want one?

397
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:21,100
Sure.

398
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:23,352
Okay, what kind do you want?

399
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:24,812
I'll have a chocolate one.

400
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:28,441
Right! And do you have
a favorite flavor, Kisa?

401
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:32,236
Maybe strawberry.
But, no, wait...

402
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,905
[TOHRU]
Is there another kind you like?

403
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:35,906
[KISA]
Banana.

404
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,492
Both, then, and
we'll go halfsies.

405
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:39,410
[KISA]
Mh‐hm!

406
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:41,579
[TOHRU] Give me a sec.
I'll be right back.

407
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,499
[TOHRU]
Okay, I'll take

408
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:49,253
one chocolate, one strawberry,
and one chocolate banana please.

409
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,714
[VENDOR A] Got it!
It'll be a minute or two.

410
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:52,923
Thank you!

411
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,175
Let's see...

412
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,218
[TOHRU grunts]

413
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,595
Uh, I'm sorry, did you
need something?

414
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:59,930
I'm paying for my crepe,
and Kisa's, too.

415
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,932
[TOHRU]
Right. Okay.

416
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:06,437
[HIRO]
I don't understand.

417
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:09,482
You're nothing but a
spineless space cadet.

418
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:12,526
If you could do it,
why couldn't I?

419
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:13,027
[TOHRU]
Hm?

420
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:16,238
Hey, are you as great
as everybody says?

421
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,114
[TOHRU]
Uh.

422
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,283
Can you magically make
people's worries disappear

423
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:22,203
and give them hope
where they had none?

424
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,955
Can you erase sorrow?
Eliminate pain?

425
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,707
Can you save people?

426
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:29,710
Uh, no. I can't do
anything like that.

427
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:32,421
Modesty only makes it seem like
you're fishing for compliments.

428
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:33,714
It's stupid.

429
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:35,132
Right.

430
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,679
[HIRO]
I loved her.

431
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,640
I wanted to be true
to my feelings.

432
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:46,185
And I thought I could
make Akito understand.

433
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:52,316
[HIRO]
But... I'm a coward.

434
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:57,863
Kisa got hurt because of me,
and I didn't say anything.

435
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,866
Not to her or Akito.

436
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,744
[HIRO]
Why?

437
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:11,544
I'm such a child.
Pathetic and naive.

438
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:14,046
I mean, I can't do anything.

439
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:16,799
I'm just a bratty kid.

440
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:18,551
[HIRO] But I got jealous
when she showed up

441
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,845
and actually helped.

442
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,930
What's wrong with me?

443
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:29,353
[HIRO] I'm sick of how
childish I am. How useless.

444
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,856
I don't wanna be like this.

445
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,733
I wanna be an adult.

446
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,985
Someone she can count on.

447
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,028
But I don't know how.

448
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,030
You're amazing, Hiro.

449
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,992
It's really hard to believe
you're only in sixth grade.

450
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:43,909
Shut up.

451
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:47,079
I wasn't asking you to make
me feel better or anything.

452
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:49,206
Hold on, are you
buttering me up?

453
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,500
No, I promise I'm not.

454
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:53,878
My mom told me that it's
really scary to admit

455
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,214
you're still a child and have
a lot to learn about the world.

456
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:01,677
A lot of people avoid facing the
truth and ignore it, instead.

457
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:03,929
It's hard.

458
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:07,850
So if someone can admit they've
still got growing up to do,

459
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:11,145
well, they must be
really brave, right?

460
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:14,273
You say you can't do anything,
but that's not true.

461
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:16,609
Someday, you'll be
able to protect Kisa,

462
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,695
like a prince out
of a fairytale.

463
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:21,572
So, do me a favor.

464
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:24,825
Don't sell yourself short, Hiro.

465
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:27,578
You have courage in your heart.

466
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:30,414
[HIRO]
I see.

467
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:32,166
Basically, you're trying
to tell me that there's

468
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,960
nothing princely whatsoever
about me right now, is that it?

469
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,962
Uh! No! That's not
what I meant at all.

470
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:39,965
Well, guess you're
not wrong about that.

471
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:42,343
[VENDOR A]
Here you go, dear.

472
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:43,594
Thanks!

473
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:47,932
Hang on.

474
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,684
I figure that little speech was
worth the price of a crepe.

475
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,686
So I'll treat you, this once.

476
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:53,854
Uh.

477
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:57,399
[HIRO]
She's so embarrassing.

478
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:00,027
"Prince"? Please.

479
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:01,779
You can't say stuff like that.

480
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:04,698
Not without anything
to back it up.

481
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,742
What if she's wrong about me?

482
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:09,995
Is she gonna take
responsibility?

483
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:13,999
If I just.... can't?

484
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:17,628
[TOHRU]
You have courage in your heart.

485
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,923
What happened?
You're kinda smiling.

486
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:23,968
Did something make you happy?

487
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:27,221
[HIRO]
I'll do it. Just you watch.

488
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:28,973
I swear.

489
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,767
[TOHRU]
Hiro! You forgot your change!
