00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,223
[TOHRU]
It's spring!

2
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:17,559
And the first day of the new
term is always so exciting!

3
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:21,063
We are now officially
second‐year students!

4
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:23,106
Aw, the first‐years
were adorable!

5
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:25,359
Even if some of them
looked totally lost.

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,735
The two of you really missed out

7
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:29,613
by not coming to the opening
ceremony to wish them well.

8
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:31,323
‐‐[KYO] Sounds horrible
‐‐[UOTANI] Hard pass.

9
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,992
I'm already suffering
through this hay fever.

10
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,620
Put me in a loud, cramped
room and I'd be in hell.

11
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:38,872
Stop complaining
and take some meds.

12
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:40,499
They don't work for me.

13
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:43,627
Maybe all those drugs in my
rebellious youth were a mistake.

14
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:46,171
What drugs are
you talkin' about?

15
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:48,340
I'm surprised the prince
isn't with you.

16
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:51,552
Well, everyone on the ceremony
committee's really busy today.

17
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,887
Man, sounds like a rough life.

18
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:55,180
Plus I bet he's getting mauled

19
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:57,724
by lovestruck
first‐years already.

20
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,101
[SATOMI]
Excuse me.

21
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:02,688
Senpai, I think I somehow
lost my student ID.

22
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,983
You, too? I don't know what
you want me to do about it.

23
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,442
[SATOMI]
Please help!

24
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:08,694
[YUKI]
Do you remember the last time

25
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,154
you're certain you had it?

26
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,531
I'll help you look.

27
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:15,200
Can you tell me your name
and class number?

28
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:19,246
I'm Satomi Arimori, 15,
Scorpio, blood type B!

29
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:20,497
My hobbies include
arts and crafts,

30
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:21,832
and my best feature
is my slim ankles!

31
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:22,874
[RINA]
I'm Rina Sonomiya!

32
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,210
And lots of people say I look
like I should be in a pop idol!

33
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:27,170
[STUDENT A]
No one says that, you idiot!

34
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,213
[STUDENT G]
Uh...

35
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:31,383
I know I should be jealous,
but I feel bad for him.

36
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,302
I wouldn't be surprised
if the prince ends up

37
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,470
student council
president this year.

38
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:38,015
The current one should
focus on his own issues.

39
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:41,018
[TOHRU] I don't think Yuki
would really want that.

40
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:52,446
[TOHRU]
Huh?

41
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,865
[UOTANI sneezes]

42
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:55,824
Here, take this.

43
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:57,326
[UOTANI]
Ugh. Thanks.

44
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:58,744
Of course.

45
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:39,970
[HANAJIMA]
Tohru.

46
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,221
[TOHRU]
Hm?

47
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:43,140
I picked up some waves
from the adults area

48
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,267
that felt like they
might belong to Shigure.

49
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,686
Oh. Right. He should be here.

50
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,104
There are a couple of new Somas

51
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:52,482
who're entering the
school as first‐years.

52
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:54,568
[SHIGURE]
I adore Haru and Momoji.

53
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,528
It's like they're my
younger brothers.

54
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,572
Clearly I'll have to be there.

55
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,532
I'd never be able
to forgive myself

56
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:03,493
if I missed their
glorious school debut.

57
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:04,703
Hm?

58
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:07,456
What? Why those
suspicious looks?

59
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,040
I'm appalled.

60
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,333
Surely you don't think I'm going

61
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,712
simply to ogle high school girls
in their natural habitat?

62
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,464
Besides, I am an artiste.

63
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:18,508
It's my job to observe the
beauty this world offers.

64
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,426
Idiot.

65
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:22,763
Hold on a sec. You're saying
more Somas go here now?

66
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,806
[TOHRU]
That's right. Two boys.

67
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:27,142
You met one of them at
the culture festival.

68
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:29,269
Kyon, bring the newbies here.

69
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,979
Yes, go. Let's see them.

70
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:32,689
Why do I have to?

71
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:34,691
Just send that one instead.

72
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:36,860
She's already planning
to say "hi," I bet.

73
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:38,528
Well, yeah. I am.

74
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,823
Yes, but why should we trouble
our dear friends with such

75
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:44,951
menial errands when you can
play fetch for us instead?

76
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,369
I'm not a dog!

77
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,454
[UOTANI]
Move it, Carrots.

78
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:49,664
Guys, it's really fine.

79
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,291
I wanted to go welcome
them to school

80
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,585
whenever I got some
free time anyway.

81
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,045
But you can still join me.

82
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,671
If you're not doing
anything else.

83
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:57,964
What a pain.

84
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,466
Now I have to see
those two idiots

85
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:01,802
in the outside world
and at school?

86
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:05,013
Maybe the change of scenery will
make you get along a lot better!

87
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:07,891
This could be a good thing.

88
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:09,726
I'll see ya later!

89
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,439
Crazy how hard it is for him
to say no to her these days.

90
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,274
It's entertaining.

91
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,277
[KYO] Have you met a pair
of guys named Soma?

92
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,655
A little blond kid and
one with white hair?

93
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,782
Oh, yes! They're in our class!

94
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:24,282
‐‐[KYO] Go get them.

95
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,409
‐‐[GIRLS] Sure!
‐‐[KYO] Go get them.

96
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,828
[KYO sighs]

97
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:28,995
[KYO]
If she wanted to see them,

98
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,623
she could've at least tracked
down their class number.

99
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,667
Sometimes it's like
she's not thinking.

100
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,544
[STUDENT H] Dude, check
her out. Pretty cute.

101
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:36,878
[STUDENT I]
Definitely.

102
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,464
Looks like she might be
a bit of an airhead, though.

103
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,883
[STUDENT I] Yeah, maybe,
but that's fine by me.

104
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:44,302
Girls who think they're so smart
can be a pain sometimes.

105
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,720
[STUDENT H]
Heh. Fair enough.

106
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,265
Let's go introduce ourselves.

[TOHRU]
Huh?

109
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:56,356
‐‐[BOYS yell]
‐‐[TOHRU] Hm? Hm?

110
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:57,649
Damn scumbags.

111
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,693
This is what happens
when you space out.

112
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:02,070
Um, yeah, sure?

113
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:04,906
You should be more aware of your
surroundings when you're alone.

114
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:08,034
Otherwise, losers like that
might take advantage of you.

115
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,287
[TOHRU]
Hm? Right. Got it.

116
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,747
When you're alone, not now.

117
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:13,748
Whenever I'm with you,

118
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,710
you can space out all you want
and I'll make sure you're okay.

119
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:17,919
[TOHRU]
Right.

120
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:23,383
I didn't mean that in
a weird way, okay?

121
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:24,175
[TOHRU]
Hm?

122
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,136
Weird, like how?

123
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,016
Like you'd take it the
wrong way. Course not.

[TOHRU] Whoa! Kyo, wait!
Please calm down.

Kyo, why you got to
be such a meanie?!

137
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,418
Look around, you do realize
that you're wearing

138
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,003
a girls' uniform, right?

139
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:03,048
Even this wannabe playboy
put on the right jacket!

140
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:03,798
[HATSUHARU sighs]

141
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,301
[HATSUHARU] If he likes it,
then what's the problem?

142
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:07,636
Isn't it so cute?

143
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,679
Yeah! It really suits you.

144
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:11,723
How am I in the wrong here?

145
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,058
[HATSUHARU gasps]

146
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,267

Huh?

00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:15,393
Seriously?

148
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,605
I can't believe that's what
you're wearing, Momiji.

149
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:20,941
And you. No better.

150
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,860
Oh, good! Does this mean you're
done with your committee work?

151
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:24,986
[YUKI]
No, not yet.

152
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:27,697
I just came to check on these
two while making the rounds.

153
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:29,532
Hey, <i>ja</i>, did they tell you?

154
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:33,328
Earlier, before school, I got
warned not to mess around.

155
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,246
After all, if I crash
into a girl,

156
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,123
I might change in front of them.

157
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,584
So instead, I'm going to play
it cool while I'm here.

00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:42,045
[KYO] This is you playing
it cool?! Dressed like that?!

[TAKEI]
Your dubiousness is justified,

160

Kyo Soma of Class 2‐D.

161
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:48,051
Your tangerine hair
may be a nuisance,

162
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:50,762
but a boy wearing a girl's
uniform is unprecedented!

163
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,181
Brazen, even! Not to mention
the length of those shorts!

164
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,474
Shameless!

165
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:57,560
The teachers may overlook
this travesty, but I will not.

166
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,728
That is my duty.

167
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,438
For I am Makoto Takei,

168
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,733
your trusted student
council president!

169
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:08,321
And to you, I'm the commander
of the School Defense Force.

170
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:10,198
Another idiot appears.

171
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,867
What gall! This coming
from an obvious ruffian!

172
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,995
You're practically
jangling with jewelry!

173
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:18,456
And don't even get me started
on your ludicrous bleached hair!

174
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,792
[YUKI] Actually, president,
that is his natural color.

175
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:21,543
[TAKEI]
Guh?

176
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:24,629
Yuki! Greetings!
It's a pleasure to see you.

177
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,631
But back to the vile
matter at hand!

178
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,299
This can't be real‐‐
the roots are black!

179
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,801
Trust me on this one.

180
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,387
I am a scholar and
his hair defies sense!

181
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:33,972
[TOHRU]
It'd be a whole lot easier

182
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,057
if we could just tell
him the truth.

183
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,976
Now, shall we move on
to the little sprite?

184
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:40,729
What's the meaning of your look?
Speak up for yourself!

185
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,022
Huh?

186
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,983
[TAKEI] Is this some rebellious
statement on masculinity?

187
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,609
Or is this simply
the sense of self

188
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,695
you'd like to present
to the world?

189

[cries]

190
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:53,825
I just... I think this uniform
looks much cuter on me.

191
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,453
Um. Please, sir.
Don't be too harsh on him.

192
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,997
I am not being harsh,
just asking questions!

193
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,331
I'm abiding by common sense

194
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,958
as well as the rules
of this institution

195

[KYO grunts]

00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:07,922
I thought I had shit on my shoe,

but you're what
I've been smelling.

You can't speak to me like‐‐

Whoa, Haru.

Why don't I ask you
some questions now.

204
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,889
You think wearing a tie
means you're not a bully?

205
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,558
Or no one's ever been mugged
by a guy not wearing jewelry?

206
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,352
That people with one hair
color can't murder a man?

207
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,521
Just who the hell do
you think you are?

208

It's Dark Haru.

00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:28,443
Well? What happened?

211
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,945
Where's your righteous fury?
Lost your voice?

Stop it. You can tell he's
got no fight training.

this, ya stupid Cat!

What?! Don't act like
you're that great!

217

You ran away from our last fight

with your tail
between your legs!

Is your brain broken? You're the
one who called that fight off!

[HATSUHARU] Oh, let me guess,
you're on this worm's side.

I shouldn't be surprised
you'd think he's right.

He looks fine in that
uniform, right?

Eventually he'll grow up.
But let him enjoy himself.

He can dress like a man later.

Unacceptable!

so you weren't surprised.

want to see each other.

A‐Akito. It's you?

That's correct. Tohru Honda.

Ah! I'm very pleased
to meet you!

319

[TOHRU]
I don't understand.

00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,809
Why is Akito at our school?

321
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,770
Should we really be
meeting like this?

322
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:16,439
I didn't expect the family
head to be so young.

323
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:18,775
Or as beautiful as Yuki.

324
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:24,113
Wait. This is the person
who hurt Hatori's eye.

325
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:25,823
[AKITO]
Hm.

326
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,409
You strike me as quite
feminine. Gentle, too.

327
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:30,661
I'm glad you seem like
such a good girl.

328
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,914
And most importantly,
you're also very cute.

[TOHRU] What? Oh, no,
I'm just a normal‐‐

Ha. Don't get flustered.
I'm just stating the obvious.

331
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,797
Sorry it took me so long
to introduce myself.

332
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,257
I'm rather shy when it
comes to strangers.

I hope you're not angry.

[TOHRU]
No, no, of course not!

335
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:51,808
That's a relief. So, how
about a formal introduction?

336
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:55,395
Nice to meet you. I'm Akito.
Head of the family.

Yes! Right!

But please, the
pleasure is all mine.

[TOHRU]
It's strange.

340

Akito comes off as much
softer than I had expected.

341

Now that we've met,

I'm hoping we'll be able
to get along well.

[AKITO]
Ah. Yuki!

346
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:22,004
I was hoping I'd run
into you. My boy.

347
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,966
Feels like a lifetime has gone
by since I saw you last.

348
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,844
Can't believe how grown up
you look. You're taller, right?

349
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,720
[YUKI]
What did you do?

350
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,515
What did you say to Miss Honda?

351
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:36,894
Nothing. I was simply
paying my respects.

352
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,688
Isn't that right, Tohru?

353
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,982
Wasn't I just
paying my respects?

354
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:44,360
Um. Yes, that's right.

355
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:47,447
But, Yuki, now that you're here,

356
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:52,118
there is a question that's
been weighing on my mind.

357
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,496
What would possibly make you
skip New Year's with me?

358
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:58,624
Don't you know how
that makes me feel?

359
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:02,753
Especially when I have been
so generous to you lately.

360
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,714
When you do foolish
things like that,

361
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:07,717
it really hurts my feelings.

362
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:11,345
I wonder if this means you
need a little reeducating.

363
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:16,184
Perhaps some time in your
special room is in order.

364
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:20,396
You recall those days.
Would you like to repeat them?

365
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:23,733
Or do you remember
how to be a good boy?

366
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:30,656
Um. I'm sorry.

367
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:33,951
But we have to get
back to class now.

368
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:37,455
You know, or else
we'll be in trouble.

369
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,083
Of course. Forgive me.

370
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,460
I suppose I should
be getting back

371
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,962
to Shigure and company anyway.

372
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,298
They're probably worried.

373
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,592
Yuki, I hope that you're

374
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:52,553
enjoying your time
at this school.

375
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:57,391
And remember... it would make
me happy if you visited.

376

[TOHRU] I shoved my way
between the two of them

without even thinking.

I don't know what they
were talking about,

379
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:31,884
but... I think Akito
must be... dangerous.

[TOHRU] That look. I've never
seen anything so threatening.

[YUKI] Did Akito really not
say anything strange to you

385
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,027
before I got here?

No! Nothing! I promise.

just saying hello.

Okay.

No.

why Akito hates me.

important thing right now.

There are no rules

You serve with every
ounce of strength,

every ounce of strength.

[HATORI] Yes. But Akito
doesn't understand.

Unexpectedly.

468
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,985
There was something about him.

469
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:03,072
He struck me as a
very unusual person.

470
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:06,408
I can't help but wonder if he's
a member of the zodiac, too.

471
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,285
And which one.

472
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:12,581
To be honest with you,
I felt a little scared of him.

473
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:15,376
[YUKI]
I guess we can't stay here.

474
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:18,671
It's getting pretty
late. Shall we?

475
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:21,215
Yes!

476
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:26,512
[TOHRU] But after spending so
much time with my friends,

477
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:29,139
that fear feels worlds away.

478
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,517
Like I'll never feel it again.

479
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:06,236
[AYAME]
"How have you been, my brother?"
