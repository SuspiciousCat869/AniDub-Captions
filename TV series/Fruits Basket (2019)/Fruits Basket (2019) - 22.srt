00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:30,195
[STUDENT C] Now... She just
needs a little inspiration.

158
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,029
[HANAJIMA]
Don't!

159
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:34,574
[STUDENT C laughs]

160
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,409
[STUDENT F]
Aw. Did you get an ouchie?

161
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:37,869
[STUDENT E]
Poor baby.

162
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:41,247
[HANAJIMA] Don't think of
anything. Clear your mind.

163
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:44,000
Focus on nothing but the pain.

164
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:46,294
Don't let your anger take over.

165
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:49,923
Don't let anyone
get hurt or die.

166
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,175
Don't go out of control.

167
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:53,676
Don't kill anyone!

168
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,345
What's going on in here?

169
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,096
[STUDENT E]
Crap!

170
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,597
[STUDENT C]
Oh, uh, Sensei.

171
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,849
Hanajima was playing
around with matches.

172
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:02,143
[STUDENT D] Yeah, we were
just trying to stop her.

173
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:08,775
[HANAJIMA]
This is good. Nobody got hurt.

174
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:13,822
[HANAJIMA'S FATHER]
We should move.

175
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,240
Look, I know you
don't want to admit

176
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,367
that those girls are to blame,

177
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,993
but your mother
and I are worried.

178
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,662
This can't keep happening.

179
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:25,708
We'll find a new school.
One you can actually enjoy.

180
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,628
You three should move
away and leave me here.

181
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:32,382
If I went along, I'd just cause
even more trouble for you.

182
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,134
No, never!

183
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,637
[HANAJIMA'S FATHER]
Saki.

184
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,015
Don't assume that you're
causing trouble for anyone.

185
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:44,894
This is how parenting works.
We'll always be concerned.

186
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:48,273
That's because we love our
kids with all our hearts.

187
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,943
It's true. We love you, Saki.

188
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,403
So, please...

189
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,823
Don't give up just yet.

190
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:59,117
Things are gonna get better.

191
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,621
[TEACHER A]
Come here, Hanajima.

192
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,999
Care to explain why
your nails are black?

193
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,043
And on the first day of
school, too. Take it off.

194
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,338
[HANAJIMA] It's because I
can't wear a black uniform.

195
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,800
Uh. And what does your uniform
color have to do with anything?

196
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:18,678
The wearing of black is
a symbol of my prior sin.

197
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,847
Don't you want the
other students warned?

198
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:21,806
[CLASSMATE G]
Sensei!

199
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:24,934
Hanajima's wearing
black nail polish.

200
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:27,645
[TEACHER A] Apparently,
it's her badge of sin.

201
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:28,354
Let's go together...

202
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,607
[HANAJIMA] Even though I
was in a new environment,

203
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:34,152
I was careful not to
get close to anybody.

204
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,404
Doing so wouldn't
have felt right.

205
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:39,532
Like I'd be ignoring the
horrible thing I'd done.

206
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,911
[HANAJIMA'S FATHER]
Don't give up just yet.

207
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,496
[HANAJIMA]
On what?

208
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,625
What am I supposed to
be holding out for?

209
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:49,918
Huh?

210
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:52,754
It smells good.

211
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,005
Yeah I know, right?

212
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,215
Thanks so much.

213
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:56,799
[TOHRU]
Hope you enjoy it!

214
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:01,387
We're giving out bigger servings
today. Glad you're here!

215
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,139
By the way, I'm Tohru Honda.

216
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:05,516
Nice to meet you, Hanajima.

217
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,602
The food at this school
is so delicious,

218
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,270
I just know you're
gonna love it!

219
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:11,147
‐‐Let me know what you think.
‐‐[CLASSMATE J] Shut it, Honda.

220
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,190
We're all starving here

221
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,067
and you're holding up
the whole line.

222
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:17,028
Please accept my
humble apologies!

223
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,488
[HANAJIMA]
Awfully flighty.

224
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:21,616
And why does she
speak so politely?

225
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:24,369
I'm surprised she talked
to me without hesitation.

226
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,621
Most people are too afraid.

227
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,748
[UOTANI]
Yo. Newbie transfer student.

228
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,084
I bet you're planning
to eat lunch alone, huh?

229
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:34,212
That kinda bothers me,
so take a seat right here.

230
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,965
[HANAJIMA] Another person
who's not intimidated.

231
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,259
You've got a whole doom
and gloom vibe about you,

232
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,386
that's why people are
keeping their distance.

233
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,513
Hey. Tohru, over here!

234
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,640
Thank you for waiting for me!

235
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:49,060
This is perfect! Are you gonna
have lunch at our table, too?

236
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,062
Uh‐huh. I just
scored us a third.

237
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,189
Oh! What a wonderful surprise!

238
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:55,191
[HANAJIMA]
Maybe she's polite to everybody.

239
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:58,945
[TOHRU] Right this way.
I promise neither of us bite.

240
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:01,739
Please sit and make yourself
at home as we eat together.

241
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,825
"Hanajima," huh?

242
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:07,328
If Kyoko was here, she'd say,
"You're now Hana‐<i>chan</i>!"

243
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,539
Oh, yes! Naturally!

244
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,000
Can we call you
that from now on?

245
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,835
[HANAJIMA]
They are so odd.

246
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:18,172
I apologize. But I'm afraid
I won't be eating with you two.

247
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,799
The fact is, it's
better if you don't

248
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:21,676
involve yourselves with me.

249
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,678
It would only bring
pain, nothing more.

250
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,013
[UOTANI]
Huh?

251
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,973
Oh, no, am I the same way?

252
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,766
Do I bring nothing
but pain to people?

253
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,393
I bet people get double the pain

254
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,145
whenever they get
involved with me.

255
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,730
[UOTANI cackling]

256
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:36,107
I don't know what got lost,
but it wasn't my intention

257
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,609
to depress her or
make you laugh.

258
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,485
Understand?

259
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,738
[gasps] Yes. I do understand.

260
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:44,657
I'll work harder to bring
happiness into people's lives.

261
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:47,452
[HANAJIMA] Nor was I asking you
to create new life goals.

262
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,245
[UOTANI]
Eh. Whatever.

263
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:51,497
No need to sweat over
anything like that.

264
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:54,208
Think about the good parts
of your transfer today.

265
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,586
It's beautiful outside,
we've got good food,

266
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:59,213
and you get to eat with
us big ol' weirdoes.

267
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,883
Lunch is better together.

268
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,676
You are both so strange.

269
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:05,636
[BOTH]
We get that a lot!

270
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:10,808
[TOHRU, UOTANI laugh]

271
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,227
[TOHRU] I hope we get the
chance to see you soon.

272
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:16,397
[UOTANI] Of course we will.
She does go to school here now.

273
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,399
Then let's have a
second lunch date.

274
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:19,942
See ya tomorrow.

275
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:24,155
[HANAJIMA] No one's ever looked
forward to lunch with me,

276
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,824
or said, "See you tomorrow."

277
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,117
Will they greet me
with "good morning"

278
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,119
like we're friends as well?

279
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,748
[TOHRU]
Hi! Good morning, Hana‐<i>chan</i>!

280
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:37,794
P.E. is gonna be great today.
I can't wait for the pool and‐‐

281
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:40,129
Oops, you seem lost
in thought, so...

282
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:41,422
[UOTANI]
What's goin' on?

283
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:44,467
You're blushin' like you
just confessed your love.

284
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:45,385
[TOHRU]
Maybe... Maybe I...

285
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:48,346
[HANAJIMA] It happened
because I was happy.

286
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:49,847
I kept thinking it was a mistake

287
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,475
for them to get me
involved in their lives.

288
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:56,562
But before I knew it,
we were a trio.

289
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:59,023
Suddenly, I belonged.

290
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,487
[UOTANI]
Whoa!

291
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:06,989
Another gorgeous red sunset.

292
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,784
[TOHRU]
So pretty!

293
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:12,745
It's such a gentle color.

294
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:14,997
[UOTANI]
Agreed.

295
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,624
You're right!

296
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:23,881
[HANAJIMA] We'll have good
weather tomorrow, too.

297
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,007
[UOTANI]
Hope so.

298
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,801
[TOHRU]
Oh, me, too!

299
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,846
[HANAJIMA] Swept up by
these new friendships,

300
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,932
I almost forgot
my place in life.

301
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:36,185
But after two seasons,
I remembered.

302
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:41,023
[CLASSMATE F]
Um. Hey, Hanajima.

303
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:44,819
They say you killed a boy,
back in elementary school.

304
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:48,489
That can't be true, right?

305
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:51,576
[CLASSMATE K] I heard you used‐‐
What did they call them?

306
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,911
Evil waves or something?

307
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,997
Huh? Waves?

308
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,166
[CLASSMATE F] I mean,
it's probably just a rumor.

309
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,126
But people are also
spreading the word

310

Did you... do this?

I'm so... scared.

327
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:39,707
Did I just use my power again

[TOHRU]
Hana‐<i>chan</i>!

Stay back!

You shouldn't come near me.

I'm not right.

I should've been honest
with you. I'm so sorry.

But please... This is the end.

You two shouldn't hang
out with me anymore.

Those girls? They were right
about my wave powers.

So, please. Leave me.

[HANAJIMA] I have a sin
that will never fade.

339
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,455
A stain that won't wash away.

340
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:23,334
I don't want to hurt
anyone else.

If the punishment
for what I've done

is to be shunned
the rest of my life,

then so be it.

344

But we're growing into
such close friends.

Don't you feel that?

346
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:40,393
I do, and I don't
want it to go away.

I want us to grow even closer.

[TOHRU] There may be things
I still don't know about you,

But I might hurt you.

Don't go assuming that
you're causin' us trouble.

Do you really wanna
break things off?

That's what matters.

It's all I need to know.

[HANAJIMA'S FATHER]
Don't assume that you're

causing trouble for anyone.

366

[HANAJIMA] Before them,
when I'd walk home,

367
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,999
the sky would make me
feel so terribly lonely

368
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:48,919
that I'd begin to tremble.

369
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:54,050
But at some point, the sky
took on a certain gentleness.

370
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:57,553
And there was more than
one shadow on the ground.

371
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:01,182
It seemed like such a
small thing at the time,

372
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:04,101
but we were together.

373
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,981
[HANAJIMA]
I'm sorry.

I'll pray for you.

you for who you truly are.

Hm? What is it?

I couldn't hear anything.

00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:59,490
I think... I was able to
block the voices just now.

How did you do it?

391
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:07,456
[HANAJIMA] There was a flash,
and then a whoosh.

Hey, kid, that make
any sense to you?

Basically, she learned
to trick the waves.

394
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:15,047
[HANAJIMA] It would still
be a while before I learned

395
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:17,007
to fully control my power.

396
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,801
I couldn't help but
wonder, though,

397
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:22,263
if this was all because I
didn't feel so alone anymore.

398
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,765
Regardless, I never
used my power

399
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:27,059
for the mere pleasure of it.

400

feel weird to you all of...

Just to chastise people a bit.

00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,274
I think it's more
than just a bit!

00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:39,280
[MEGUMI] How much longer are you
going to dress only in black?

[HANAJIMA]
I'm not sure.

405
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,868
It's been so long since
I've worn anything else.

406
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:47,496
I'm not certain I'd be able
to relax in other colors.

407
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:49,039
You don't have to
keep wearing black

408
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,417
just to make me feel better.

409
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:54,378
I promise I don't mind
being the only one.

No, this color helps
me to relax, too.

And besides, think
what would happen

wearing pastels.

I bet the entire neighborhood
would freak out.

That's true. That could be
quite interesting, though.

[HANAJIMA]
Sometimes, my heart hurts.

423
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,875
Mostly when I think
about how selfish it is

424
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:34,919
that I felt I needed more,

425
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,631
even though I had a family
who loved me so much.

We need other people.

In fact,

I bet that no matter how much
others might oppress you,

430
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,393
how hopeless you feel,

431

or how loved you
are by your family,

you'll always want to be

That's my theory. Ha.

And also, for parents...

Well, as long as our
kids seem happy,

then... that's really the
only thing that matters.

437
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,998
That's why, even if
someday you three

go your own separate ways,
doesn't mean anyone gave up.
