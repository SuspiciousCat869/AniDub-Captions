1
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:17,100
[WOMAN A]
I heard it was suicide.

2
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:18,560
[WOMAN B]
Poor thing.

3
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:21,396
[MAN A] The Cat spirit
must've driven her to it.

4
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:22,231
[KYO]
Shut up.

5
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,899
[WOMAN C]
The child isn't even crying.

6
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:25,400
[MAN B] You'd think he'd
show some remorse

7
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:26,401
for what he did.

8
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:29,404
Just shut up!
This isn't my fault!

9
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:31,365
You don't understand!

10
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:34,284
[KAZUMA]
I do.

11
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:37,454
I understand.

12
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:39,248
Nice to meet you.

13
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,750
My name is Kazuma Soma.

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,586
This isn't my fault.

15
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:46,922
This isn't my fault.
It's not my fault!

16
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:48,465
[KAZUMA]
It's okay.

17
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:53,262
It's okay. I understand.

18
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:54,555
[gasps]

19
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:05,274
Kyo, how would you like to
come and live with me?

20
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:43,705
[SHIGURE]
This is a pleasant surprise.

21
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,040
How've you been?

22
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:46,500
Fine, thank you.

23
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,168
And I hear that
life as a novelist

24
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,503
has been treating you well.

25
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,088
[SHIGURE laughs]

26
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,506
[SHIGURE]
Oh, I get by.

27
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,549
Ah. Thank you very much.

28
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,593
Of course!

29
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:59,554
[TOHRU] This must be the man
Kyo told me about before.

30
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:00,889
His master.

31
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:03,517
[KAGURA]
Sensei, I'm glad you're back.

32
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:04,810
It's been so long.

33
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:09,314
It has. But you've
been well, I hope.

34
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:12,359
[YUKI]
It's good to see you.

35
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:14,361
Sensei.

36
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:16,196
Hello there, Yuki.

37
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:20,158
You're so much taller than
I remember. You've grown.

38
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:22,994
[SHIGURE]
Oh, Tohru.

39
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,706
Sorry. This is Kazuma Soma.

40
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,833
The family's martial
arts instructor.

41
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:31,461
He's taught Yuki, Kagura
here, Haru, and others.

42
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:33,255
He's Kyo's master.

43
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,757
[TOHRU]
Oh, I didn't realize...

44
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:38,969
If you don't mind, may I
please call you "Tohru"?

45
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,637
Oh! Yes, please do!

46
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:43,724
That would be great.
Um. It's nice to meet you!

47
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,892
I've heard a lot about you.

48
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:48,729
I believe you know of
the zodiac spirits?

49
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,897
[TOHRU]
Uh, yes.

50
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,858
Ah, but how much?

51
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:55,777
[SHIGURE]
Hey, Kyo.

52
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,612
Maybe you should stop
sulking in the corner

53
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,156
and greet your master.

54
00:03:59,197 --> 00:03:59,823
You haven't seen him

55
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:02,075
since you trained in
the mountains, right?

56
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:04,411
Aren't you happy to be reunited?

57
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:05,662
I, uh‐‐

58
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,919
Is something wrong?

59
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,215
Could you tell me which
room belongs to Kyo?

60
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,761
Oh, sure. You just go up
the stairs and take a right.

61
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,053
I'd be happy to show you.

62
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:25,474
No. I can manage on
my own, thank you.

63
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,021
[SHIGURE, KAGURA chuckle]

64
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,230
That's classic Kyo.

65
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,482
Totally.

66
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,650
I think I'm missing something.
What do you mean?

67
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,235
[giggles] It's cute.

68
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,030
Kyo's actually really happy
to see his master again,

69
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:43,074
but he would probably rather
die than let us see it.

70
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,994
Especially with Yun‐<i>chan</i>
hanging around.

71
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,498
[knocking]

72
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,167
[KAZUMA]
Kyo. Let's talk.

73
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:55,378
[KYO]
That was rude of me.

74
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,506
I'm sorry, Master.

75
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,634
It's okay. I understand.

76
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,058
[KYO]
You're really here.

77
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:10,227
Welcome back, Master!

78
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:14,022
[KAZUMA]
It's good to be back.

79
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,237
[TOHRU] So, I guess Kyo's
master isn't one of the Somas

80
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,863
with a zodiac spirit?

81
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,031
[KAGURA]
No.

82
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:26,076
He is still a member of
the main family, though.

83
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:29,830
[KAGURA] They say Sensei's
grandfather was actually the one

84
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:33,375
possessed by the Cat
spirit before Kyo.

85
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,460
I guess, if anyone
can understand

86
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:40,382
some of what Kyo's going
through, then he'd be the one.

87
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,050
But I've always thought
their connection

88
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,636
was based on more
than just that.

89
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,639
Sensei really seems to love Kyo.

90
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:50,684
Like a true father
would love his son.

91
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:58,400
Wow, they must be so close.

92
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,737
[KYO] Does this mean your
training sabbatical

93
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,281
is finally over?

94
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:05,949
Yes, it is.

95
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:08,159
I'm afraid I can't afford
to spend any more time

96
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,369
away from the dojo.

97
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:12,914
Great! So, can I go back
to the dojo, too, then?

98
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,833
That's what you said, right?

99
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:19,921
For now, you will
continue to live here.

100
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:23,008
So, what? You're just
gonna break your promise?

101
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,135
I guess you're scared
of Akito, too.

102
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,845
That's not it.

103
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,805
My observations have
led me to believe

104
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:31,850
that this is the best
environment for you.

105
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,852
Whether the two of you
living under the same roof

106
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:37,272
was coincidence, or fate,

107
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:40,066
the fact remains,
she is a comfort to you.

108
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:44,738
[KYO] Master! Please,
I can't stand it here.

109
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,531
It's like I'm sitting
in a lukewarm bath

110
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,492
and my skin's getting pruny.

111
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:56,833
Sometimes, I hate it so much...
I feel like I wanna scream.

112
00:06:56,875 --> 00:07:00,503
I didn't ask for this.
I don't need to be comforted.

113
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,299
[KYO]
I hate it.

114
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,304
[KAZUMA]
Now that isn't true.

115
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:11,598
That's not hate you feel.

116
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,815
[KAGURA] Sensei will be
staying the night, won't he?

117
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,651
Me, too! It's like
a slumber party.

118
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,527
It's not! Go home, would ya?

119
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,445
Aww!

120
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:26,404
I'm glad he's staying,

121
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,782
but where do you think
we should put his futon?

122
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:32,243
Maybe he can share
Shigure's room?

123
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,870
[YUKI]
No, definitely not.

124
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:34,996
[TOHRU]
Uhh.

125
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,414
Well, I guess that
means he and Kyo

126
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,041
will just have to bunk together.

127
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,876
Huh? Why can't he sleep
here in the living room?

128
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:41,169
[KAGURA]
I'll go ask him.

129
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:42,462
Come back!

130
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:45,340
It'll be nice. I'm sure you
have a lot to talk about.

131
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:46,716
Not really.

132
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,343
Oh, I know!

133
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,220
Um, here's an idea.

134
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,639
If there's time, maybe I could
see you and your master

135
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:56,393
do some of that sparring
you talked about before.

136
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,061
[KAGURA]
Sensei's gonna stay!

137
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:00,063
Sensei's gonna stay!

138
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:01,398
[KAZUMA]
It's time.

139
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,986
I thought I should warn you.
I'm going to remove it. Tonight.

140
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,655
Things may get messy.

141
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:10,699
[SHIGURE]
I don't doubt it.

142
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,910
Why now? Seems like an
awfully sudden move.

143
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,745
I know.

144
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:18,957
But today, when I saw
how he looks at her,

145
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:23,128
I thought, perhaps she's the
one who can open his heart.

146
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,755
Perhaps she will accept him.

147
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:28,216
All of him.

148
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:33,054
Either way, I think it's best to
find out now rather than later.

149
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:35,390
We are running out of time.

150
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,311
[SHIGURE] Even you would
entrust everything to her.

151
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,565
One young girl.

152
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:47,027
[SHIGURE] Still, you can't
be certain it will succeed.

153
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,903
Even if she does accept him,

154
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:53,533
Kyo will most likely
reject that acceptance.

155
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:57,287
And this time, he may
well break for good.

156
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,916
[SHIGURE]
He might come to despise you.

157
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:05,045
You may never see
his smile again.

158
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:09,257
Tell me, is that really a
risk you're willing to take?

159
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,635
[KYO]
Ha! Are you kidding me?

160
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,262
How'd this even happen?

161
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:17,474
You really suck at
cooking, Master.

162
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:18,641
[KAZUMA]
Yes.

163
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,101
I suppose I'll need
more training

164
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:22,312
if I want to make
something edible.

165
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,105
[KYO laughing]

166
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:25,690
[KAZUMA]
Even so...

167
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:31,321
[KAZUMA]
Even so, I'll take my chances.

168
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:32,864
On her.

169
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:39,913
[KAZUMA] Tohru, might you have
a spare moment this evening?

170
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,874
Of course.

171
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,252
[KYO]
Listen, Master,

172
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:49,756
whatever this is about,
couldn't we have talked inside?

173
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:53,218
You know I'm no good when
the weather's like this.

174
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,762
My grandfather suffered
the same way.

175
00:09:55,804 --> 00:10:00,100
Apparently, rainy days often
left him feeling weak and ill.

176
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,685
But is it the Cat spirit..

177
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,437
...or is it the spirit
of your true form

178
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:06,523
that can't stand the rain?

179
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,943
It's time.

180
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:13,071
To move forward, you must fully
accept who you truly are.

181
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,197
If you cannot do that, then‐‐

182
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:16,074
I accept it now!

183
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:23,039
[KYO]
I have for a long time.

184
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:27,377
Being born with the Cat spirit
meant my life was already over.

185
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:30,797
And that it's the Rat's fault.

186
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,008
He's the reason
all this happened.

187
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,971
Everything woulda been different
if it weren't for him!

188
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,681
This is all his fault!

189
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,474
He's the reason this happened!

190
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:43,852
So I'll kill him,
and then I'll die, too!

191
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,312
Then you'll be satisfied, right?

192
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:50,150
That's what you want!
If I die, then you'll be happy!

193
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,322
I see you haven't changed.

194
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,158
You need to make a choice.

195
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:01,536
Is this how you wish
to live your life?

196
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:05,540
Covering your ears...
Closing your eyes...

197
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:10,378
Burying everything else beneath
the hate you feel for Yuki...

198
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,630
Is that the only way
you can keep yourself

199
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,633
from falling apart?

200
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:19,762
If that's how you live,
then that's how you'll die.

201
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:23,933
Lost and alone.

202
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:25,894
Like my grandfather.

203
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:32,358
You hate it here.
That's what you said.

204
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:37,071
But it's not true. You're
simply trying to run away.

205
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,616
You realized you've
grown comfortable here.

206
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:42,160
This "lukewarm bath"
makes you feel safe.

207
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,495
Except, you're also scared.

208
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,540
You don't want your true
form to be discovered...

209
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:49,834
...because of what
you stand to lose.

210
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,920
Instead of risking that loss,

211
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,756
you'll run away and
spare yourself the pain.

212
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:58,551
Therefore, I will take
away your escape route,

213
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:00,887
and we'll see what happens.

214
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:04,182
Will you lose what you've found?

215
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,768
There is no turning
back after this, Kyo.

216
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,978
[gasps]

217
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,440
[KAZUMA] Let's see if your
life truly is already over.

218
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,240
[KYO'S MOTHER]
It's okay.

219
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:24,494
It'll all be okay...
because I love you.

220
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:27,580
That's why I don't want
anyone else to see you.

221
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:32,085
Don't look. Nobody
look at my son.

222
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,586
Don't look.

223
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,422
[KYO'S MOTHER]
Don't look.

224
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,174
It's disgusting.

225
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:42,303
[KYO]
Don't look!

226
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:53,815
[AKITO]
Really? This is Kyo's true form?

227
00:12:53,856 --> 00:13:00,738
[KYO grunting]

228
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,742
It's like some hideous
creature from a nightmare.

229
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:09,080
What's that stench?
It's revolting.

230
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,874
Like the smell of
something rotten.

231
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:17,338
[AKITO]
So, that's what it looks like.

232
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,216
The true form of the Cat spirit.

233
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:29,684
Are you... Kyo?

234
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,104
It's disgusting.

235
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,532
[KYO]
She saw. She saw.

236
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:46,075
She saw me.

237
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:49,537
It's too late. It's over.

238
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:53,875
It's... all over.

239
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:59,130
[KAZUMA] Now you've seen
what Kyo's kept hidden.

240
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:03,259
The true form of the Cat
spirit that possesses him.

241
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:07,764
Tell me, does it disgust you?

242
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:10,600
Frighten you? Repulse you?

243
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:33,831
[KAZUMA] Will you run
to him... or from him?

244
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,463
[yelps]

245
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:56,104
[TOHRU retching, coughing]

246
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:01,317
[TOHRU] I've never smelled
anything so awful.

247
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:03,986
Like something rotten.

248
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:07,990
That was him. That was
Kyo's other form.

249
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:15,581
[TOHRU coughing]

250
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,667
[TOHRU]
I don't understand.

251
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,710
What's happening?

252
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,505
What's the right thing to do?

253
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:25,425
I feel so lost.

254
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:28,886
But... even so!

255
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,444
[KYO'S MOTHER]
What's the matter?

256
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,737
Did something happen again?

257
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:53,661
[KYO'S MOTHER] Kyo, did
Akito say something to you?

258
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:55,413
It's okay.

259
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:56,581
It'll all be okay...

260
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,957
[KYO]
Stop.

261
00:15:57,999 --> 00:15:58,958
[KYO'S MOTHER]
...because I love you.

262
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,834
[KYO]
Stop it!

263
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:01,252
[screams]

264
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:13,097
[KYO]
I can't... take any more.

265
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:21,355
[TOHRU]
Kyo, I‐‐

266
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,274
[KYO]
Stay away!

267
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,276
What are you doing here?!

268
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:29,405
Why the hell are you following
me like nothing's changed?!

269
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:30,198
Kyo, please‐‐

270
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,200
[KYO]
I said stay away!

271
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:35,536
What is wrong with you?!
You've got eyes, don't you?!

272
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,371
A nose, too, right?!

273
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:41,083
We both know I'm disgusting
like this, so go!

274
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,503
Just leave me alone.

275
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,922
I don't need you or your pity!

276
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,674
[KYO]
Please.

277
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,885
Please, no more.

278
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,470
I know.

279
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:55,139
But... But I...

280
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:56,432
[KYO'S MOTHER]
I love you.

281
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:57,183
[growls]

282
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:58,851
[KYO]
Don't touch me!

283
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:03,731
Get lost.

284
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:11,364
[TOHRU coughing]

285
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:14,408
[KYO]
Idiot! Get out of my sight!

286
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,453
Next time I'll carve
up your face.

287
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:18,913
I mean it.

288
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:42,853
[KYO] If I'm going to lose her
anyway... I won't hold back.

289
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:46,357
I'll hurt her so badly that
she'll never forgive me.

290
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:50,236
So badly she'll never have
to worry about me again.

291
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:55,992
I'll wreck everything... so
she'll never want to look back.

292
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:59,662
I can't take it.
I'm sick of losing people.

293
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:01,747
Sick of pity.

294
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,666
Sick of being miserable.

295
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,711
Sick of having things
forced on me.

296
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:12,091
[KYO'S MOTHER] No, honey.
You're as human as anyone else.

297
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:16,137
You turn into that form
sometimes because of evil magic,

298
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:19,181
not because there's
anything wrong with you.

299
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,976
You're back to normal
soon after, right?

300
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:26,063
That proves it.
You're not a monster.

301
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:31,068
It's okay, I promise.
I'm not scared at all.

302
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:35,531
[KYO] Liar. You were
scared, weren't you?

303
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,827
[KYO] Isn't that why you checked
dozens of times every day

304
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:42,413
to make sure the
beads were still on?

305
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,959
[KYO'S MOTHER] I'm so proud
to have you as my son.

306
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,294
[KYO]
Yeah, right.

307
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:51,797
If you were so proud, why
didn't you let me go outside?

308
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:52,923
[KYO'S MOTHER]
You're so adorable

309
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,301
I have to keep you
all to myself.

310
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:57,595
[KYO]
You were ashamed of me.

311
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:00,348
[KYO'S MOTHER]
Sweetheart, I love you.

312
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:03,893
I would die for you.
You know that, right?

313
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:08,481
[KYO] Why did you always
say stuff like that?

314
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,900
How can you love somebody

315
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:14,028
when you never acknowledge
who they really are?

316
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,488
She loved you.

317
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,573
Your mother loved you more
than anything in the world.

318
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:19,784
Stop it! You're wrong!

319
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,662
Don't force that "love" on me!

320
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,580
I don't need it.

321
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:25,998
I don't.

322
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:36,217
[gasps]

323
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,638
[TOHRU]
Let's go home. Please.

324
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,515
We have to go home.

325
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,725
Right now!

326
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:47,436
[TOHRU] If we don't,
I have a feeling Kyo

327
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,232
won't come back to
that house ever again.

328
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,820
[KYO]
Just go away.

329
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:56,654
[TOHRU]
No!

330
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:57,905
[KYO]
Don't you get it?

331
00:19:57,947 --> 00:19:59,240
[TOHRU]
No, I don't!

332
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,158
[screams]

333
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:07,623
[TOHRU]
I'm scared.

334
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:09,959
Even though I know
that's your voice,

335
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:12,336
it doesn't sound like you.

336
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:16,298
You're in a form I've
never seen before...

337
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,802
...and it scares me.

338
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:26,142
But... scared or not...
I wanna understand.

339
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:30,229
If you need to talk,
I'll listen.

340
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:34,442
If you need to be selfish,
I'll let you.

341
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:37,611
I wanna help you the
way you've helped me.

342
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:41,949
If you're feeling hurt,
or scared, or weak,

343
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:47,163
I want you to tell me,
so I can face it with you.

344
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,956
Because...

345
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:51,834
Because I wanna
keep living together.

346
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:58,549
I wanna eat with you, study
with you, worry with you.

347
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:00,843
All of those things.

348
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:02,720
Please, I just want...

349
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:05,556
I just wanna stay
with you, Kyo!

350
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,317
[KYO]
The thing is,

351
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:22,490
if she didn't love all of me,
that would've been fine.

352
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:27,578
Or even if...
if she were scared...

353
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,706
...I'd get that.

354
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:33,417
Because being scared would've
meant she was looking

355
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:37,046
at the ugly part of me.

356
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:40,716
But she never did.

357
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:44,386
Mom used love to avoid
seeing the truth.

358
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:48,098
To avoid even thinking about it.

359
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,060
But... I wanted her
to understand.

360
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:55,648
I just wanted her to say
we'd face it together.

361
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:59,318
To say... she wanted to stay.

362
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:08,244
[KYO] Even back then,
I knew it was stupid.

363
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:12,957
A kid's dream that would
never come true.

364
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:16,252
Because who would ever say
something like that to me?

365
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,256
[KYO]
That's what I thought.

366
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,757
Until...

367
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:25,261
[KYO]
Tohru.

368
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:29,723
[KYO]
Tohru.

369
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,858
[KYO]
...you showed up.

370
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:44,822
[KYO] You showed up and
things began to change.

371
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:47,157
You started to melt
away the ugly feelings

372
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,660
and dark thoughts inside me.

373
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:53,539
Bit by bit, day by day...

374
00:22:56,959 --> 00:23:01,755
[KYO] Why would somebody like
you... wanna stay by my side?

375
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:08,345
[KYO]
Why... would you cry for me?

376
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:15,644
[KYO]
How can I ask you to?

377
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:17,980
I know I shouldn't.

378
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:20,024
I don't have any right.

379
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:26,322
[KYO]
I know that it's a mistake...

380
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,824
...for you to be here with me.

381
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:49,803
[KYO] But still... I find myself
wanting to treasure you.

382
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:53,390
To stay with you forever.

383
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,809
I can't help but wish...

384
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,820
[TOHRU]
"Summer will be here soon."
