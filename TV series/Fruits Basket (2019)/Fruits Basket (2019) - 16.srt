She'd say that she was red,

158
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,982
because she was
the Crimson Butterfly,

159
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:05,110
and that Tohru's dad, a
straightforward man, was white.

160
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:08,488
Mix those, and you
get pink for Tohru.

161
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,824
A pink swimsuit's perfect.

162
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,243
Aw, man. She's gonna
look so cute.

163
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:16,413
You both really love
Miss Honda. It shows.

164
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,581
Helping her seems
to make you happy.

165
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:19,666
[UOTANI]
Well, yeah.

166
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,377
Like I told you before,
the girl kinda saved me.

167
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:26,423
Wasn't exactly easy adjusting to
life as a respectable citizen.

168
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,299
Woulda been impossible
without her.

169
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:31,011
Right. Like you're respectable.

170
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,054
[UOTANI] What d'you mean?
Of course I am.

171
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,806
[ITO]
Isn't that Uotani?

172
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,933
What're you gonna
do about it, Ishi?

173
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:40,645
[ISHIHARA] Lookin' awfully cozy
in her new social circle.

174
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:41,521
[TAKEMURA]
Wanna rough her up?

175
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:43,565
[ITO] She's got some
guys with her, though.

176
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:44,858
[TAKEMURA]
Idiot.

177
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,444
You think I'm scared of
a couple jerks like that?

178
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:48,778
They'll just run away
like all the other

179
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,989
useless guys these days.

180
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,574
[ITO]
Got that right.

181
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:57,454
[ISHIHARA]
But... they are seriously yummy.

182
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:01,082
[TAKEMURA] Yeah. Not gonna
argue with that one.

183
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:01,916
[TOHRU]
Uh...

184
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,711
You guys bought this
for me? Like, a gift?

185
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:06,421
I don't understand.

186
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,506
It's our way of
saying "thank you."

187
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,675
[TOHRU]
But I‐I didn't even do anything.

188
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:13,094
Come on, just take it already.

189
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:15,722
Really. We want you to have it.

190
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:17,766
Please accept, okay?

191
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,434
[gasps]

192
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,686
[TOHRU] This means so
much. Thank you guys.

193
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:25,648
I will treasure it.
Forever and ever.

194
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,775
Oh, Tohru!

195
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,526
Our Tohru.

196
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,694
[YUKI, KYO]
Uh.

197
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:35,617
[CLERK A]
Here's your table.

198
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,577
[YUKI] Which swimsuit
did you end up getting?

199
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:39,621
[UOTANI] You'll find out
when she wears it.

200
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,915
I mean, you'll probably
go to the beach, right?

201
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,709
[YUKI]
Mh‐hm. I hope so, anyway.

202
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:47,545
We ladies should take a trip
of our own sometime, too.

203
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,546
We should!

204
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,131
I would enjoy that.

205
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:53,676
You're so close. Like you've
been friends a long time.

206
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,762
Did you meet in
elementary school?

207
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:58,139
Oh, no. Middle school, actually.

208
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,517
Hanajima, you started at
our school back in what,

209
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:01,226
eighth grade?

210
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,020
Yes. I had to transfer in.

211
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:06,856
I caused some minor problems
at my previous school.

212
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,108
[BOTH]
Yeah?

213
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,234
You were still part of the gang

214
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,944
back when we first
met, weren't you?

215
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:14,364
Sure was. I started running
with them in fifth grade.

216
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,491
[TOHRU] You always went
around with a mask on.

217
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:19,327
[UOTANI] Don't forget the long
skirts and super‐thin eyebrows.

218
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:22,247
[HANAJIMA] No mask now, but
the last two are still true.

219
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,873
[UOTANI]
Oh, yeah. Guess you're right.

220
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:26,042
[UOTANI laughs]

221
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:28,128
[BOTH]
Should she really be laughing?

222
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,588
Well, I had a real chip
on my shoulder back then,

223
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,840
and it showed.

224
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,299
So on edge.

225
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:37,011
Like a lion that's gone
too long without a meal.

226
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,305
My teachers didn't know
what to do with me.

227
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,266
Neither did my dad.

228
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:46,479
Seems like it should be harder,
but going bad's pretty easy.

229
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:49,107
Before I knew it,
I'd joined a female gang‐‐

230
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,775
running around with
a buncha tough chicks

231
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:53,111
causing all kinds of trouble.

232
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:56,739
I hurt people and
got hurt myself.

233
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,700
Did a lotta bad stuff.

234
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:01,661
You don't even wanna
know the half of it.

235
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:04,414
Basically, I was a moron.

236
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:08,334
An idiot of epic proportions.

237
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:17,385
But still, even an idiot...
can find somebody to look up to.

238
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:19,971
She pushed aside men
and became a gang leader,

239
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,764
despite being a woman.

240
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:25,935
Her street name was
the Crimson Butterfly.

241
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:28,146
Also known as Kyoko.

242
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,731
Tohru's mom.

243
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,233
[TAKEMURA]
Hey, Ishi.

244
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:34,736
We gonna do something
or just stand here?

245
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:39,324
Hold on. I wanna picture
of those hotties first.

246
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,075
[TAKEMURA, ITO giggling]

247
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,661
Um. Excuse me.

248
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:46,873
[CLERK A]
Enjoy your meal!

249
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:49,209
[UOTANI]
Heck yeah. This looks great.

250
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,795
I'm pretty sure you mentioned
this before, briefly,

251
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:55,798
but, um, your mom was
some kind of biker?

252
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,050
Yes, that's right!

253
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:59,135
Before she had me,
Mom was the big‐shot leader

254
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:01,179
of a motorcycle
gang around here!

255
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,973
Oh, wow. Really?

256
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:06,935
It's hard to picture that,
knowing her daughter.

257
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,561
Kyoko was special.

258
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:12,106
Not some wannabe, back‐alley
thug playing gangster.

259
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,942
They say whenever
she rode her bike,

260
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,069
the red taillight
weaving back and forth

261
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,571
looked like a
fluttering butterfly.

262
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:20,281
She was a good fighter.

263
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:22,825
And respected the
codes of the street.

264
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,036
Every time I heard an older
member talk about her,

265
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,580
I liked her even more.

266
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:29,832
That happens to
everybody, right?

267
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,626
You find someone you
view as your hero

268
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,379
and put them on an
untouchable pedestal.

269
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,798
You really love the
Butterfly, huh, Uotani?

270
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,341
[UOTANI chuckles]

271
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:40,343
[DELINQUENT A] I'm surprised
you haven't run into her.

272
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:41,970
I'm pretty sure she lives
in a neighborhood

273
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,513
not too far away from here.

274
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,181
[gasps] For real?

275
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:46,057
[DELINQUENT A]
Yeah.

276
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,392
Way I hear it, she got married

277
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,227
and changed her last
name to "Honda."

278
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:52,563
I think she's even got a
daughter about your age, too.

279
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,481
Who knows?

280
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:56,109
Maybe you go to school
with the Butterfly's kid.

281
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:59,237
Crazy. A daughter?

282
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,576
[STUDENT C]
Watch out. It's Uotani.

283
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,120
[UOTANI]
I have a feeling I know exactly

284
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,414
what Kyoko's daughter
must be like.

285
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,208
A total delinquent badass.

286
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,128
Shouldn't I have noticed
another girl like that, though?

287
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,005
Whatever. I gotta
find this girl.

288
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:20,091
Then maybe I'll get to meet
the Crimson Butterfly herself.

289
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,260
[UOTANI]
Huh?

290
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:22,969
[squeaks]

291
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:24,178
‐‐I'm so sorry!
‐‐ Watch where you're going,

292
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,221
you big idiot.

293
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:27,140
Yes! I promise I
will from now on!

294
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,142
I will be more careful‐‐

295
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:33,688
Ah! Oh, no, this is such a
disaster! I am such a klutz.

296
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,773
[UOTANI]
What's with this chick?

297
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,109
[TOHRU] Excuse me! Please don't
step on those notebooks.

298
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,320
Um, did you hear me?
I need these.

299
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,071
...the last musical guest
was the best part.

300
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:43,781
[TOHRU]
I'm sorry, but if you could just

301
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:44,574
watch where you're stepping...

302
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,826
She said don't step
on them, numbnuts!

303
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:48,453
[growls] Get it together.

304
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,705
Stop spacing out and
pick these up already.

305
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:51,414
Okay!

306
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:52,749
Screw this school.

307
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,335
Class is bad enough without
havin' to do this crap.

308
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,170
You. What's your name, huh?

309
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,796
[TOHRU]
What? Oh, right.

310
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,048
I'm Tohru Honda.

311
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,591
[UOTANI]
D'you say Honda?

312
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,259
Next thing I know
you're gonna claim to be

313
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:05,511
the Crimson Butterfly's
daughter.

314
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:06,888
Yes! I am.

315
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:10,308
That was my mom's title back
when she was still active.

316
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,228
[UOTANI]
You gotta be kidding.

317
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,855
[TOHRU]
I'm sorry, what?

318
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,612
[UOTANI]
Seriously?

319
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:26,032
You should definitely come
meet her. She'd love that.

320
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:28,451
[UOTANI]
Could this girl...

321
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:32,330
...actually be <i>the</i>
Kyoko's daughter?

322
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,707
Of course I didn't
realize who she was.

323
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:37,210
She's about as
plain as they get.

324
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,545
And it's not only that...

325
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:40,630
[TOHRU]
By the way,

326
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:44,342
feel free to say no, but
could I call you "Uotani"?

327
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,928
[UOTANI]
Uh. Yeah, fine.

328
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,764
[TOHRU]
I'm glad we met, Uotani.

329
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:55,895
[UOTANI]
She seems... a little...

330
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:58,106
How do I put it?

331
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,941
Strange.

332
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,902
[KYOKO] Surprise!
How was school today, Tohru?

333
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:04,237
‐‐[TOHRU] Um.
‐‐[UOTANI] Huh?

334
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,738
‐‐[TOHRU] You're kinda heavy.
‐‐What the heck?

335
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,366
[KYOKO] How lucky am I that I
caught you on your way home?

336
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,410
Hey, listen what
happened to me today.

337
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:11,953
You won't believe it.

338
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,496
Actually, before that?

339
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:17,291
There's a classmate of mine here
who really wants to meet you.

340
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,918
[UOTANI]
No way.

341
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:23,923
Could this person...
really be her?

342
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:29,011
Oh, is that so?
Who do we have here?

343
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,681
This is Uotani.

344
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:34,183
[UOTANI] Turns out the
delinquent I admired...

345
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:36,978
...had changed into
a doting parent.

346
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,605
It was like a punch to the gut.

347
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:40,314
In that moment,

348
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:43,276
my hardcore admiration
for her disintegrated.

349
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:46,320
It's hard to explain just
how disappointed I was.

350
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,865
Which was totally unfair.

351
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,659
I'd created this perfect
image of Kyoko in my head,

352
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,453
what I thought she'd be like,

353
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:57,081
and then I had the nerve to be
mad because it wasn't real.

354
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,875
I wanted her to be the
person I'd imagined,

355
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,918
not some nice mom.

356
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,671
Pretty selfish.

357
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:07,425
'Course, Kyoko smiled and
took things in stride.

358
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:11,179
She forgave me for being selfish
and didn't hold it against me.

359
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,389
Even though I wasn't done yet.

360
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:17,143
I'm sorry. It's such a mess.
I didn't expect company.

361
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:19,437
Please, make yourself at home.

362
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:22,815
[UOTANI] The Crimson
Butterfly is doing laundry?

363
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:25,985
[KYOKO] Say, why don't you stick
around for dinner, Uo‐<i>chan</i>?

364
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:27,653
What'd you call me?

365
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,989
[KYOKO] Uo‐<i>chan</i>.
That's your new nickname.

366
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:31,324
[grunts]

367
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,575
[TOHRU gasps]

368
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:35,453
Yes, please stay and
eat with us, Uo‐<i>chan</i>!

369
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:38,080
[UOTANI]
It's already a thing?

370
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,833
[UOTANI]
I, uh, nah. I'm goin' home.

371
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,294
Oh, come on. You must be hungry.

372
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,922
And nobody cooks
like my Tohru does.

373
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,632
I'm just okay.

374
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,842
[KYOKO] By the way,
what's on the menu tonight?

375
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:51,385
[TOHRU]
I'm happy you asked!

376
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:54,639
We're having meat
stewed with potatoes.

377
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,641
[UOTANI]
Great. But I really gotta go.

378
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:00,019
Oh, wow. I get it.
Your parents are strict.

379
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:01,479
Don't be stupid.

380
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:04,065
You can tell they're not
just by looking at me.

381
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,275
Well, that's not
necessarily true.

382
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:08,903
Everyone's lives are unique.

383
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:11,447
I couldn't be more
disappointed in you!

384
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:13,074
The Crimson Butterfly I idolized

385
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,618
has turned into a domestic,
overly‐friendly mom

386
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,703
who can't stop loving
on her dumb daughter.

387
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:21,165
I can't believe what a pathetic
person you've turned into.

388
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,210
[UOTANI gasps]

389
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,004
[KYOKO]
I just relaxed a bit.

390
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,881
And it feels nice.

391
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:38,266
[KYOKO]
Huh?

392
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,813
[TOHRU]
Uo‐<i>chan</i>!

393
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:46,899
Uo‐<i>chan</i>! Wait!
You forgot your mask.

394
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:49,694
Don't call me that name like
we're friends or something.

395
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:50,861
[gasps]

396
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,281
[UOTANI] I don't want
anything to do with you.

397
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:56,158
Run back home and let
your mommy spoil you.

398
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,743
So stupid!

399
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:00,663
Your life makes me
wanna puke everywhere.

400
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,749
It's her.

401
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,461
[UOTANI]
What the hell?

402
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:10,131
Why do I feel like
I'm missing out?

403
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:13,301
Even though they're the ones
who got on my nerves.

404
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,761
I dunno why I'm so pissed.

405
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:23,644
[UOTANI] Maybe 'cause I didn't
fit into the vibe of that place.

406
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:27,356
Something there
made me feel so...

407
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:29,609
...uncomfortable.

408
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,360
[AKIMOTO]
Uotani.

409
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:33,404
[UOTANI]
Yeah, Akimoto‐<i>senpai</i>.

410
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:36,907
Tell me, did you meet
the Butterfly's daughter?

411
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,284
[UOTANI chuckles]

412
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:40,077
I'm over that idea.

413
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,663
I mean, it's such a pain
to go to school anyway.

414
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:44,999
[DELINQUENT A] Yeah, I hear
you. Totally not worth it.

415
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,375
[DELINQUENT B]
Ya got that right.

416
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:49,337
[DELINQUENTS laughing]

417
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:54,925
[UOTANI]
This is the vibe I fit into.

418
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,761
[DELINQUENT A] Who do you
think you are, bitch?!

419
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,137
You wanna die? Huh?

420
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:00,598
[DELINQUENT B] I'll give you
scars you'll never get rid of!

421
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,224
[UOTANI]
This is where I belong.

422
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:05,019
[DELINQUENTS laughing]

423
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:07,772
[DELINQUENT C] Man, my mom
called the freakin' cops on me.

424
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,982
I swear I'm gonna
kill her one day.

425
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:12,693
My old man told me
to never come back.

426
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:15,112
[DELINQUENT B]
But he says that every day.

427
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,155
[DELINQUENT C]
Thing is, they're the...

428
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:21,535
[UOTANI] I need a place where
I can fall as far as I want.

429
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,037
[UOTANI]
Nothing going on today.

430
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,872
Guess I could go home for once.

431
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:26,999
Your dad's the only
one there, right?

432
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,085
It'd be cool to smother
him in his sleep.

433
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,503
[DELINQUENT C]
At least swipe his cash!

434
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:33,255
[DELINQUENTS laughing]

435
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:42,598
[UOTANI]
My mom left us for some new guy.

436
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,642
I was in the first grade.

437
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:47,436
I've been living with
my dad since then.

438
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,403
[TV HOST B]
Next, tell us about a strange

439
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:56,654
snacking habit you have.

440
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:57,863
Starting from the left.

441
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:58,823
[TV HOST C]
Let me think.

442
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,784
Okay, well, I don't know
how strange it is, but...

443
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:04,203
...I like to wrap rice
crackers in ham.

444
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:06,831
[UOTANI]
All he ever does is drink.

445
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,333
[AUDIENCE laughing]

446
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,544
[UOTANI]
I'm used to it, though.

447
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,795
[TV HOST D]
...a growing boy. That's all.

448
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:14,880
[TV HOST B]
What? He's older than I am!

449
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,425
[TV HOST] Wait till you hear
about his cheese habit.

450
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:26,142
[UOTANI] You can get
used to a lot of things.

451
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,978
Whether you want to or not.

452
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:40,197
[KYOKO]
I just relaxed a bit.

453
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,158
And it feels nice.

454
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,035
[TV HOST B]
What's next?

455
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,036
[TV HOST A]
Just wait.

456
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,831
This is going to take you
to another world entirely.

457
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:52,251
[TV HOST B] Perfect. Well,
it was nice knowing you.

458
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:53,335
[gasps]

459
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:32,059
[growling]

460
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:34,061
Watch it, mister.

461
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:36,772
Wait, is that all you got?

462
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:38,065
Was it weird sounding?

463
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:40,734
Not weird, but it's kinda
missing something.

464
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:43,279
[TAKEMURA] Yeah, maybe start
with adding more words.

465

[ITO]
Here, lemme try.

466
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,742
What the hell are you

467
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,828
You wanna throw it

Don't you think that's
going a little far?!

472
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:04,300
It's not proper for girls
to say such filthy things.

473
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,969
Baby. Don't get your panties
in a wad, loser.

479
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:17,271

00:23:29,617 --> 00:23:30,868
[ISHIHARA laughs]

485
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,661
Look, someone's coming.

00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:42,129
[TAKEMURA]
What are we supposed to do now?

490
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:44,381
Don't be wimps!
We follow through with this.

491
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,299
Let's fight, kid!

492
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:46,842
[TAKEMURA]

00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:53,724
[GIRLS gasp]

00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:57,186

498
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,605
[GIRLS scream]

499
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:01,315
[MOMIJI]
Hm?

500
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:02,483
Huh.

501
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:07,071
