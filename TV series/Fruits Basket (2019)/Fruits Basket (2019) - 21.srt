Whoa. You're right!

Oh. So, you saw?

Yeah. What's up? Is there
some kinda problem?

No, I don't believe so,

but they were expressing an
interest in visiting my house.

00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,004
It's odd.

They're apparently writing
an article on waves

But whatever their reasons,

00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,101
there was definitely something
unpleasant about their waves.

34
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:47,936
So, did you tell them
they could come over?

Sure. Why would I refuse?

[NARRATOR A] Any student
as revered as Yuki Soma

must have his own following.

00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:52,602
At Kaibara High School,

82
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:55,438
they are known as
"The Prince Yuki Fan Club."

Its membership
supposedly includes

over half of the school's
female population.

love, and protect the prince

who has deigned to grace their
school with his presence

In other words: "Keep those
other bitches away from him!"

88
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:11,621
Ahem.

89
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:14,708
The club's core principles
are strictly enforced.

90

Those who go against
said principles,

even non‐members,
are eligible for punishment.

Something must be done.

After our unpredictably
efficacious <i>senpai</i> graduated,

95
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,724
I thought our club would finally
be able to function properly.

96
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:34,394
But then came the insidious
insurgency of Tohru Honda.

97
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:37,063
What right does she have
to smile by Yuki's side

98
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:40,483
or accompany him to
and from school?

99
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,319
How dare she use her wiles

of his family!

If our Yuki were to fall
in love as a result

of that witch's cruel magic,

I‐I... I don't know
what I would do!

But we'll stop her!

108
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,172
We'll protect our innocent
prince from the witch,

109
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,423
no matter the cost!

110
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:07,093
[MOTOKO] Indeed. You're
absolutely right, Minami!

111
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:10,055
However, it won't be easy.

112
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,431
The witch is under
the protection

113
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:13,850
of a powerful Demon Queen.

114
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:17,771
Yes. That dark wielder
of evil waves.

115
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,439
Oh, yeah. Way evil.

116
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:21,983
I know firsthand just
how strong they are.

117
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:24,152
If you say so.

118
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:25,946
[KINOSHITA] I stayed in bed
for a week straight

119
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:28,657
with all these weird visions
and voices in my head.

120
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:29,741
They went on forever,

121
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,535
until I thought I might never
be able to sleep again.

122
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,454
You must've been
so frightened.

123
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:37,749
I can only imagine
the horror! Tragic!

124
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,627
Arisa Uotani is bad
news, but still human.

125
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:43,380
We at least stand a
chance against her.

126
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,340
But that Hanajima!

127
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:46,841
She's a different story!

128
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:50,303
She has powers that no ordinary
mortal can possibly match!

129
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:53,974
True. True. She is
formidable indeed.

130
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,725
That said, the fact remains

131
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:58,436
that if we wish to be rid of
the witch once and for all,

132
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,564
we must first drive the
Demon Queen from her side.

133
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,692
Which is why we will do
everything in our power

134
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:07,237
to ensure our plan to infiltrate
Wave Girl's home succeeds!

135
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:10,782
Once inside, we will determine
the Demon Queen's weakness,

136
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,994
and use that to seal
away the evil waves!

137
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,495
Whatever the sacrifice,

138
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:19,249
our precious prince's
heart must be protected!

139
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,500
Do not fear.

140
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:23,795
Remember, we fight in
the name of Prince Yuki!

It's this way. Are you coming?

Uh. Yeah. Sure.

So, you take the

00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:47,193
Is it much farther
to your house?

[ALL]
Uh.

149
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:58,163

Listen, we must show no fear.

Stay strong.

151
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,459
It will take all our courage
to defeat this Demon Queen.

So, uh... What do you guys
think her house is like?

I mean, um...

I've got this picture
of it in my head.

00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,058
An old building in the
middle of a cemetery,

the sky above perpetually dark,

except when lit by
flashes of lightning.

161
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,522

and inside her room is a
mysterious magic circle

163
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,736
surrounded by fallen statues.

164
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:33,198
Who knows what kind of
rituals she performs in there?

165
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,825
[giggles]

166
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:36,826
[KINOSHITA laughs]

167
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:38,661
Crazy, but very possible.

168
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,623
What do we do if it actually
is like that, Senpai?

169
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:44,250
We run as fast as we can.

170
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,544
[HANAJIMA]
We've arrived.

171
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,420
Right here.

172
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:49,380
Uh. Already?

173
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,718
Uh! No cemetery or anything!

174
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,098
There, see? Your imagination
ran away with you.

175
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,934
Right. The real battle
begins now. Ready?

176
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:01,851
[KINOSHITA, YAMAGISHI]
Yeah!

177
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:03,103
Come.

178
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,661
[KINOSHITA]
Um... Your house is nice.

179
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,916
Thank you very much for
allowing us to come over.

180
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,169
[HANAJIMA]
I'll go and make some tea.

181
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:32,257
My room is on the second
floor, just down the hall.

182
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,092
Oh, and...

183
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,927
...I would advise you
never to speak your names

184
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,428
while you are in this house.

185
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,139
For your safety.

186
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,351
[ALL]
Why not?

187
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,233
[YAMAGISHI] Well, her room's
pretty normal, too.

188
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:51,109
That's a relief.

189
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:54,279
What's with all the black
and purple, though?

190
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,823
Motoko‐<i>senpai</i>,
I'm not sure we should be

191
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:58,700
drinking anything
made by Wave Girl.

192
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,869
You know, the whole
"demon" thing?

193
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,705
Minami. Mio. Stay strong.

194
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,331
We can't arouse suspicion.

195
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,249
[KINOSHITA, YAMAGISHI]
Uhh.

196
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,084
Now, with the Demon
Queen occupied,

197
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:09,836
this is our chance
to conduct a search.

198
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,212
[KINOSHITA, YAMAGISHI]
Yeah, got it!

199
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,506
[MOTOKO]
We must discover her weakness!

200
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:17,594
[MOTOKO]
They're all black.

201
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:20,763
Find a weakness. Right. Uh!

202
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,850
Even her make‐up is...

203
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,727
[KINOSHITA]
Find a weakness. Right.

204
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:26,644
[gasps]

205
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,771
[KINOSHITA]
She likes <i>shojo</i> manga?

206
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:31,232
I didn't see that one coming.

207
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,942
But it doesn't really
scream "weakness."

208
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:35,612
I mean, who doesn't
like a good <i>shojo</i>?

209
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,822
Oh. Hey, I have this series.

210
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,449
[MOTOKO]
We need find something!

211
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,951
A diary or a photo.
Maybe a poem...

212
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:42,994
A poem?

213
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,205
Oh, yeah, those are the worst!

214
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:48,374
That's the spirit!

215
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,753
I don't care if all you can find
is some scandalous underwear.

216
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:55,506
Anything will... do.

217
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:58,384
‐‐Tea's ready.
‐‐Hanajima, quick!

218
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:01,471
An intruder! There's
somebody behind that door!

219
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:03,097
[HANAJIMA]
Oh, Megumi.

220
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,349
[MOTOKO]
Huh? Who's that?

221
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,892
[HANAJIMA]
My younger brother.

222
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:07,727
He does this sometimes.

223
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:10,939
I saw his shoes downstairs,
so he must be home from school.

224
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,315
[YAMAGISHI]
A brother?

225
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,734
[KINOSHITA]
Is he a demon, too?

226
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:15,902
[HANAJIMA]
Megumi?

227
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:18,905
Stop hiding and come
and introduce yourself.

228
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,659
Hello, there.

229
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,745
[MOTOKO]
Come all the way out, you freak!

230
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:28,623
You are obviously
not Tohru and Arisa.

231
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:31,209
So are you new
friends of Saki's?

232
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,210
They're not.

233
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,712
We're the same gender,
and we go to the same school,

234
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,590
but other than that, they're
perfect strangers to me.

235
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:39,676
[MOTOKO]
Is she being serious?

236
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:49,602
Um, you look a lot
like your big sister.

237
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:51,062
We look nothing alike.

238
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,480
[KINOSHITA]
They could be twins!

239
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:54,190
[YAMAGISHI]
Practically identical!

240
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:57,235
So, anyway, I was
wondering, um...

241
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,153
...what else you have in common.

242
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:02,323
Can you do the wave
thing like her?

243
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:03,992
I do not possess that power.

244
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,285
[GIRLS sigh]

245
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:08,079
What I do is much different.

246
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:11,165
Mine is the power
to curse people.

247
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:14,585
I'm especially skilled
at foiling counter‐curses.

248
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,338
I'm proud. It's quite hard.

249
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,339
[HANAJIMA]
He's an odd child.

250
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:19,465
[KINOSHITA]
You're one to talk!

251
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,550
[YAMAGISHI]
'Cause you're so normal.

252
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,093
[MOTOKO]
Pot, meet kettle.

253
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:26,472
So, like, cursing people and
stuff, how does it work?

254
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:27,098
[MEGUMI]
Their names.

255
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,349
[wheezes]

256
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:31,102
Provided I know what
the target's name is,

257
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:34,397
putting a curse on them is
a relatively simple matter.

258
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:38,067
That reminds me.

259
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:40,069
I don't believe you've told
me your names yet, ladies.

260
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:42,572
Well! We don't wanna
overstay our welcome.

261
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:44,198
Let's finish our business here.

262
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,242
A few quick questions and
we'll be out of your hair

263
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:47,368
before you know it.

264
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,495
Gone like a rainstorm in summer!

265
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:50,079
Your names.

266
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:51,539
Yes, how right you are!

267
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,833
We'll ask and be on
our way immediately.

268
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,960
It should be no time at all.

269
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:58,713
Senpai, please! I really
don't wanna stay here!

270
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:00,798
But you must.
We've made it this far.

271
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,051
We cannot allow our
courage to fail us now.

272
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:06,304
She's right! We can't leave
until our mission is complete.

273
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:07,055
But please.

274
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,473
I said no!

275
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:11,392
We must discover her
weakness. No matter what.

276
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:13,102
Yes! Even should we be cursed‐‐

277
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:15,480
Hanajima‐<i>senpai</i>, do you
have any weaknesses?

278
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,066
[KINOSHITA, MOTOKO]
That wasn't exactly subtle!

279
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,901
Yes, I do.

280
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:24,155
[ALL]
Really? Like what?

281
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:27,700
[HANAJIMA]
I see what this is about. Yes.

282
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:30,286
As members of the Yuki Soma
fan club, you don't care

283
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:32,497
for how close Tohru has
become to him recently.

284
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,998
[KINOSHITA]
Uh.

285
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,335
[HANAJIMA] And you want
her out of the picture.

286
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:40,463
But there's a problem,
because I'm in your way,

287
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:43,674
and it seems you fear me.

288
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,259
[MOTOKO gasps]

289
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,762
But your strategy was childish.

290
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:49,389
Trying to figure
out my weakness.

291
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,473
[gasps]

292
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:51,682
[KINOSHITA]
That's cheating!

293
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,102
You're using your waves
to read our minds!

294
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,895
I'm doing no such thing.

295
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,814
You're so obvious,
there's no need.

296
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,190
You little liar!

297
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:02,735
Just let it go.
Don't waste your breath.

298
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:04,570
If she knows, then we
can stop prevaricating

299
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,572
and get straight to the point.

300
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:09,575
You're right. We don't
like that witch.

301
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:13,413
No. More than that,
we utterly despise her.

302
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,372
Now, then.

303
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:17,291
Will you give your little
friend a message for us?

304
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,837
Tell her to keep her
distance from Yuki.

305
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:24,132
Why should I do that?
It's none of my business.

306
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:27,009
Your jealousy is as ugly
as it is obvious.

307
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,303
Uh! You take that back!

308
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,805
We're not jealous, we're angry!

309
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:32,932
That's right! She's an intruder.

310
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:36,227
Acting like Yuki belongs
to her pisses me off!

311
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:39,397
Perhaps you're unaware
of what jealousy means.

312
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:43,276
And what do you and your cohorts
know about Tohru, pray tell?

313
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:47,113
I can't stand to see you
ignorantly belittle her...

314
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:49,240
...over someone as
trivial as that boy.

315
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:52,785
What was that? Did you
just call Yuki trivial?

316
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:55,663
Did you hear her?
She just insulted our prince!

317
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:58,082
We're standing right here.
