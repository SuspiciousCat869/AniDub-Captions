Perfect festival food.

This feels wrong.

Look at him.

I didn't realize
he was so miserable.

perhaps you'd like to tell
me when you became a girl.

and Akito got interested.

Akito has a fairly high fever,
though, so I nixed the idea.

Akito told me to bring back
a nice photo of you boys.

What will Akito say
about my dress?

I've gotta get
out of this thing.

[TOHRU] Sure, but just think,
everyone liked it so much!

[YUKI] Boys don't like being
called "cute," you know.

I'm sorry.

The truth is, I thought you
looked really cute as well.

I didn't want you to see
me looking like that.

So pathetic.

[TOHRU]
Um. Thing is...

178

Whenever my mother
called me cute,

180

with this incredible
sense of happiness.

181
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:43,732
Because I knew that
what she really meant

182
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,735
was that she loved me.

183
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:50,488
It was a form of love
between us.

[TOHRU]
Oh, Mom.

I'll never get to hear
her say that again.

186
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,165
Anyway, I think that's
what our classmates meant,

187
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,583
just that they like you.

[YUKI]
No.

191
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:13,344
Actually, what you've shared
makes me feel kinda better.

192
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:17,015
I guess I could give my <i>senpais</i>

can you help me with this?

Yeah. Sure.

If you wore it,
I bet you'd look great.

200
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,660
I don't think I could pull
it off. But I wish I could.

201
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,287
Just like a princess.

[YUKI]
You'd look cute.

203

It's the truth. You'd be
much cuter than me.

I think my heart's gonna
beat right out of my chest!

If you ever see him again,

it'd be best to avoid
being alone with him.

Um, why do you say that?

220

Because...

He's the one who suppressed
everyone's memories

when I got found out.

So I guess... I just want you
to be careful around him.

00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,895
Maybe that sounds
dramatic to you,

317
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:17,023
but Tohru was the first
friend we ever had.

318
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:20,443
And in a lotta ways,
she saved us.

319
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:23,571
I don't expect either of
you to understand that.

320
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,699
I just hate this.

321
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:30,495
The fact that we didn't know to
support her when she needed us.

322
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,374
[UOTANI] It's like Tohru does
all the work in our friendship,

323
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:38,211
but can't count on us for
putting in the same energy.

324
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:41,172
Is it even worth being
friends with us?

325
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,050
[KYO]
Look, you're good.

326
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:47,220
She's not the kinda girl
who sweats stuff like that.

327
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:49,972
[YUKI]
Miss Honda.

328
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:53,476
She deserves the moon, but
would never ask you for it.

329
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,105
[TOHRU]
Sorry for taking so long.

330
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,981
I couldn't find the
cards anywhere.

331
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,526
Let's play Rich Man‐Poor man.

332
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,028
[HANAJIMA]
That's a brilliant idea. I'm in.

333
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:08,032
Aw yeah. I can't wait to
school coppertop over here.

334
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,075
Not a chance.

335
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:10,368
I'll beat you, and when I do,

336
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,495
you gotta dye your
hair black, got it?

337
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:12,995
[UOTANI]
Fine...

338
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,665
Here, do the honors?
Cut the cards for us.

339
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:18,960
[KYO] This is my natural color,
you bleach‐blonde moron!

340
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,169
Yeah. Sure.

341
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:21,504
[KYO]
Fight me!

342
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,633
[SHIGURE]
How are you feeling?

343
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,887
[SHIGURE]
Yuki and Kyo seem much happier,

344
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:33,933
and I'm certain it's because
Tohru is living with us now.

345
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:37,186
I hope things continue
on a positive track.

346
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:38,813
I know your real goal.

347
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:44,360
I assume you think this will
fail, but you're out of luck.

348
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:46,112
Because you see,

349
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:49,782
Tohru is a much better
person than you are.

350
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:52,368
You don't have to say it.

351
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,329
I know I always ask
for the moon.

352
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,296
[UOTANI]
Ugh.

353
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,715
I yelled too much
and my throat hurts.

354
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:08,426
At least you didn't end up
the poor man like I did.

355
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,761
This is a rather luxurious bed.

356
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,389
[TOHRU] Isn't it?
Shigure bought it for me.

357
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:16,392
[UOTANI] What is he? Some
kind of "Mister Moneybags"?

358
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:17,852
Huh? Whoa, Tohru.

359
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:20,062
I can't believe you
still have that hat.

360
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:23,441
[TOHRU] Of course I do.
It's an important memento!

361
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,319
[HANAJIMA]
Really? What's the story?

362
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,570
Oh, that's right.

363
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:30,781
I don't think I ever had the
chance to tell you about this.

364
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,450
It's from when I was a kid.

365
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:36,454
In elementary school, the boys
bullied me all the time.

366
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:37,872
One day, they were chasing me,

367
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:40,249
and I was so scared as
I ran away from them

368
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:44,253
that I completely lost
track of where I was.

369
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:47,298
I hid because I was afraid
they would find me,

370
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:51,886
and eventually, I just sat
there bawling my eyes out.

371
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:54,639
That's when I saw a boy
across the street.

372
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,724
And he was wearing this hat.

373
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:59,560
He stood and stared at
me for a little while.

374
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:02,480
But then he ran off,
without saying a word.

375
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,524
And for some reason
I chased after him.

376
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,192
Like it was on instinct.

377
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:08,486
[TOHRU]
Wait! I don't wanna be alone!

378
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:09,987
I wanna go home!

379
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,948
Please don't run so fast. Ah!

380
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:18,788
[TOHRU] I almost lost sight
of him so many times,

381
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:22,500
but he'd wait for
me to catch up.

382
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:25,836
And thanks to this
mysterious boy...

383
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,635
[gasps]

384
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,596
[TOHRU]
...I found myself outside

385
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:38,766
of my apartment
building once again.

386
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:42,520
[HANAJIMA]
That's a wonderful memory.

387
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,814
If the two of you met again
later and fell in love,

388
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:47,149
it'd be an even better story.

389
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:49,735
It's the type of setup
from a romance novel.

390
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:50,611
[TOHRU giggles]

391
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:52,446
I won't hold my breath

392
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,906
[UOTANI]
Hey, it's a small world.

393
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:56,367
You never know, it might happen.

394
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:57,326
[TOHRU]
That's true.

395
00:17:57,368 --> 00:17:58,452
If I did meet him again,

396
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:01,998
I'd at least like to thank
him for what he did.

397
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,875
He's probably forgotten all
about it by now, though.

398
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,503
I bet it was just
another day for him.

399
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:12,717
But still, he holds a
special place in my heart.

400
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,135
[TOHRU] I think that
boy might've been

401
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,596
someone important in my life.

402
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,347
My first love.

403
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:19,640
You poor kid.

404
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:22,852
You even had a rough life when
you were little, didn't you?

405
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,980
Oh, no, I wouldn't
say that at all.

406
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:29,191
I recently learned
exactly how lucky I am.

407
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,736
And I won't take
that for granted.

408
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,488
I get to live in this
house with the Somas.

409
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,283
I had the most
incredible mother.

410
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:40,494
And I have not one,
but two wonderful friends

411
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:44,874
named Hana‐<i>chan</i> and Uo‐<i>chan</i>
right here by my side.

412
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:48,836
I know you two will
always have my back.

413
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,504
How could I possibly
be ungrateful

414
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,298
when I have people who care?

415
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,592
I can't tell you what
that means to me.

416
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,887
How fortunate it makes me feel.

417
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,389
I love you two.

418
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:01,474
Look, you're good.

419
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:04,393
She's not the kinda girl
who sweats stuff like that.

420
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:05,645
Miss Honda.

421
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:09,190
She deserves the moon, but
would never ask you for it.

422
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:13,527
[TOHRU]
All right.

423
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:16,238
We should probably
be getting to sleep.

424
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,491
They really do get
her, don't they?

425
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,034
Uh. What?

426
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:25,498
It's true. They see straight
through to her essence.

427
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:29,168
Her ability to appreciate
what she has in the moment,

428
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:32,713
instead of always looking ahead
and wishing she had more.

429
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:37,218
And incomparable friendship.

430
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,427
That's right.

431
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:39,929
Yours, too.

432
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:49,772
[YUKI]
Cretin.

433
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:52,274
I've told you not to drink
straight from the carton.

434
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:53,359
Oh. Good morning!

435
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:55,236
‐‐Lay off me, stuck‐up rat.
‐‐I hope you slept well.

436
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,612
[KYO yells]

437
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:58,698
Oops, looks like you
spilled the milk.

438
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,324
Go and buy more for us.

439
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:01,492
You jerk!

440
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,744
That's it. We're settling
this right now.

441
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:05,079
A cat and a rat.

442
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:06,163
[KYO, TOHRU, YUKI gasp]

443
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,123
Uncanny.

444
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,666
[TOHRU]
Oh, hello! Y‐You're up!

445
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,251
Can I get you something?

446
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,419
Why do you say that?

447
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,087
You know, they're
like that cartoon...

448
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:16,799
[KYO] That's right.
I forgot they were here.

449
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:20,803
Still, this seems like
a fun house to live in.

450
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:22,430
I'd decided that if I came over

451
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,516
and found out it was a bad
environment for Tohru,

452
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:28,728
then I'd do all sorts of
things to the two of you.

453
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,187
What kinda things?

454
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,856
Like what?

455
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:36,610
Has anyone ever told you...
that your waves are quite nice?

456
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,195
[BOTH]
Huh?

457
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,947
[HANAJIMA]
Oh, you don't realize it?

458
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:42,032
Well, that's good, too.

459
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,577
Well, we're counting
on the two of you.

460
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,954
Please look after her for us.

461
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:53,878
You guys. I'm okay.
But thank you for...

462
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,421
[KYO]
That was like...

463
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:58,799
[YUKI] ...they were
giving away a bride.

464
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:00,843
Now, let's have breakfast.

465
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:03,471
We'll have to come back
and visit here again.

466
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:04,680
[HANAJIMA]
Yes.

467
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:07,600
I'd like to investigate the
Soma family's strange waves.

468
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,351
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
she's gotta be kidding.

469
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:10,561
[TOHRU]
Um!

470
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:13,439
I promise that I'll be
super careful, 'kay?

471
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:15,900
Your secret will not get out.

472
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,943
Plus, they're both
really good people.

473
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,237
I swear.

474
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,239
Yeah, fine. Have it your way.

475
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,950
Yes, they are your
friends, after all.

476
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,952
[gasps]

477
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:32,458
[phone ringing]

478
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,377
[TOHRU]
Hello?

479
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:36,754
[HATORI]
Is this Tohru Honda?

480
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,839
[TOHRU] Uh, yes.
May I ask who's calling?

481
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:43,093
[HATORI] Hatori Soma. We met
at the festival yesterday.

482
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,220
I'll cut to the chase.

483
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:47,515
I need you to come to the Soma
estate on your next day off.

484
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:48,057
[TOHRU]
Pardon?

485
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:50,851
I have something important
I must discuss with you.

486
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:52,853
Don't tell anyone about this.

487
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:56,106
You'll come by
yourself as well.

488
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,651
He's the one who
suppressed their memories.

489
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,820
So just be careful.

490
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,154
[TOHRU]
This isn't good!

491
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:05,074
But then, Mom did tell me not to
doubt people without a reason.

492
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:09,578
[HATORI] If you don't show up.
I trust you know what'll happen.

493
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,790
[TOHRU]
Right. I'll be there.

494
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:15,042
[HATORI]
Good.

495
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:18,629
And who knows, you may
even get to meet Akito.

496
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,214
[gasps]

497
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:06,445
[TOHRU]
"Spring comes."
