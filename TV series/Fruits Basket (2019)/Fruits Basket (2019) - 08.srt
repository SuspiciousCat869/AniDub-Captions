time visiting your parents

160
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:42,337
in a while, right?

161
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:46,091
[YUKI] She's never going
to see her parents again.

162
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:49,260
[KYO]
No matter how much she wants to.

163
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,972
Guess I can learn to
put up with Akito.

164
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,181
If I must.

165
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:56,059
I can handle Kagura
in small doses.

166
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,519
If I must.

167
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,062
[SHIGURE]
Hmm...

168
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:01,022
As far as these two
are concerned,

169
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:04,067
Tohru's words are the law.

170
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,236
[YUKI]
If she says she'll be fine,

171
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,863
then shouldn't we trust her?

172
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,825
[KYO] Yeah. New Year's is
always the same, anyway.

173
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:15,328
We just have to suck it
up and get through it.

174
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,204
[TOHRU]
All set?

175
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,623
Make sure you don't lose
each other in the crowds!

176
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:19,874
We'll be fine.

177
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,836
The streets'll be empty.
Most people are watching TV.

178
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,504
Make sure you lock up.

179
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:26,006
You should check
the windows, too.

180
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:29,342
Right! See you
when you get back.

181
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,177
[SHIGURE]
Have a happy New Year!

182
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,929
[TOHRU]
And you guys, too!

183
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,224
[YUKI gasps]

184
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:38,977
[YUKI]
She'll be okay. I'm sure.

185
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:53,199
[HATORI] Akito. It's too
cold to be barefoot.

186
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:56,244
[AKITO]
It's been a long time...

187
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,000
[AKITO]
...since I saw Yuki.

188
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,087
You know, a few nights ago,

189
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:08,423
she left her bedroom
window wide open.

190
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,008
[YUKI, SHIGURE]
Are you a peeping Tom now?

191
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,094
Oh, come on. Get real.
I saw it from the yard.

192
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:15,889
She could really stand
to be more observant.

193
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,892
She fell down the stairs
again yesterday, too.

194
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,644
She's the kinda girl who'd
run into a brick wall.

195
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:24,814
Definitely the type who'd die
choking on her New Year's mochi.

196
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:27,317
[YUKI] Why would you even
imagine something so horrible?

197
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:28,735
[sighs]

198
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:29,944
That's enough.

199
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,362
You sound like a couple
of new parents

200
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,697
fretting over their child.

201
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:33,490
[KYO, YUKI]
Huh?

202
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:36,618
Look, I get it, you're worried
about Tohru being alone.

203
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:39,204
But it was your decision
to come to the estate.

204
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,121
What're you talkin' about?

205
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:41,664
I'm not worried‐‐
she's just fine!

206
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:45,001
This is ridiculous.
Keep walking.

207
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:47,253
Oh, now that I think about it,

208
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,422
the paper said something
about burglaries.

209
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,257
There've been a
bunch in this area.

210
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,301
I think the criminal's
still on the loose.

211
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:54,844
[BOTH gasp]

212
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:55,512
[KYO]
Crap.

213
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:58,306
She's such an airhead I bet
she'd invite the burglar inside

214
00:09:58,348 --> 00:09:59,265
from the cold!

215
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,017
[YUKI] She'll probably
even fluff his pillow

216
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:02,185
and serve him tea,

217
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:04,729
while asking him to
tell her his life story.

218
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,564
[KYO growls]

219
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,066
[SHIGURE]
I like this game.

220
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,901
Hey, come on. Get a grip, 'kay?

221
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,986
If you stand around in
the street like that‐‐

222
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,113
You could be killed.

223
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:13,905
[SHIGURE yelps]

224
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,783
Oh. Hi. I did not see you there.

225
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:19,327
[KYO] Does she always have
to make a dramatic entrance?

226
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:22,080
[YUKI] Where does one even
buy a cloak like that?

227
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,332
[SHIGURE] Fancy meeting
you on the road! Heh.

228
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:25,834
We're on our way
home to spend time

229
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,252
with the rest of the family.

230
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:31,631
I see. So she'll be
utterly alone this year.

231
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,133
[BOTH gasp]

232
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,968
[HANAJIMA] She's never
spent a New Year's holiday

233
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,428
without her mother.

234
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,682
And this time, she
won't have anyone.

235
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:43,685
Arisa and I both offered
to spend the break with her,

236
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,854
but she just smiled
that smile of hers

237
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:49,899
and told us it was important
to be with our families.

238
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:52,235
Who's looking out
for her, though?

239
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,612
Think about it.

240
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:58,867
All the New Year's specials...
All the performers...

241
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,035
They're basically the
exact same every year,

242
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,663
which must bring back memories.

243
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:07,917
How will she feel this time,
seeing them without her mother?

244
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:08,918
[YUKI]
What must she have felt

245
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,504
when she watched us
leave her behind?

246
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:17,302
I wonder, is she really okay
with how this turned out?

247
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:21,347
Will she end up
being happy, or not?

248
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:25,101
[KYO] Did we abandon her?
How must she feel right now?

249
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:26,352
[BOTH grunt]

250
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,314
[KYO groans]

251
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,024
What are you buffoons doing?

252
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,775
Just go to the banquet.

253
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,694
Your precious Akito misses you.

254
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:36,112
And what about you?

255
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:37,947
You'll break your precious
Kagura's heart.

256
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:39,365
[KYO]
Agh! Screw you!

257
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,868
You can take that insane
girl for all I care.

258
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,786
And you can have Akito.

259
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,038
[KYO]
I'll pass!

260
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,623
[SHIGURE]
Wait, are you kidding me?

261
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:49,000
Where are you off to now?

262
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,668
[BOTH]
I'm going home.

263
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,295
Really? You, too?

264
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:53,379
Your dinner's waiting.

265
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:54,923
Shut up. I don't care

266
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,050
‐‐about the banquet.
‐‐Yeah, yeah.

267
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:59,969
Oh, I get it.
You planned this.

268
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:01,638
That whole speech was
just to trick them

269
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,098
into going back for her.

270
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,227
It wasn't a trick.
Not like you're thinking.

271
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:10,480
My only desire was to do
something nice for her.

272
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,982
And nothing more.

273
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:15,568
I wish you good waves
in the new year.

274
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,739
She's a clever one.

275
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,621
[YUKI] We've lived
together for four months...

276
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:29,290
...and I still don't
fully understand her.

277
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:34,295
[KYO] I missed it.
I couldn't see the truth.

278
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:37,840
Because she always seems
like she's so carefree.

279
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,884
[YUKI]
She gives an earnest smile

280
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,720
to even the smallest things.

281
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:46,182
[KYO]
Yeah. She's constantly smiling.

282
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:49,269
[YUKI] And she always says
what you want to hear most.

283
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:52,730
This may sound strange,

284
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,566
but your kindness
reminds me of a candle.

285
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,695
It can light up the darkness.

286
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,947
Though I do have one request.

287
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:04,158
If I forget you, please
befriend me again.

288
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,703
I have always loved
the zodiac Cat!

289
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,037
I'm confusing you.

290
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,833
What I mean is:
I want us to be friends!

291
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:17,755
[TOHRU] So trust me
when I say, I can see it.

292
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:21,551
You have a plum on your
back. I swear it's true.

293
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,263
[YUKI]
Why didn't I see it?

294
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,558
[KYO]
Why couldn't I see it?

295
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,479
[TOHRU]
Soma, Kyo, Shigure.

296
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:36,274
I wanted all of us
to stay together.

297
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,693
Learning about each other.

298
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:41,362
I wanted it so much.

299
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:44,365
[KYO]
There's no way she's fine.

300
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,909
She doesn't wanna be alone.

301
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,912
[YUKI] I should've known she
wouldn't wanna be by herself.

302
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:57,337
[TOHRU]
I want to go... home.

303
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:01,716
Even if it is selfish,
that's what I want.

304
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:03,843
To be with all of you!

305
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,347
[YUKI]
I wanna go home.

306
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,432
[KYO]
I wanna go home.

307
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:10,641
[YUKI]
I wanna go home.

308
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,393
[KYO]
I wanna go home.

309
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:15,355
[YUKI, KYO]
I want to go home.

310
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,439
Right now!

311
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:17,648
[gasps]

312
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,989
[gasps]

313
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,783
Whoa! Oh my gosh, you scared me!

314
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,118
What happened?
What‐What're you doing back?

315
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,537
[gasps]

316
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,122
Ah! No, don't worry!

317
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:36,125
I‐I can explain. Oh! I was
cutting onions! Yeah, that's it!

318
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:38,878
Um, and, you know, it's
that time of year where...

319
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,296
...where you just can't
help but be moved

320
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:41,422
by the songs people sing

321
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:45,259
and all of the happy people
that are on TV and stuff...

322
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,220
[BOTH groan]

323
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:51,140
[TOHRU] Ah! What's happening?
Are‐Are you two okay?

324
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:54,894
[YUKI] Thank goodness. If we
hadn't realized in time...

325
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:59,857
[KYO] We almost let her cry
through the new year alone.

326
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,318
Um. Hello?

327
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:06,948
[YUKI] We're okay. Just excited
to watch the first sunrise.

328
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,241
[KYO]
Yeah, that's right,

329
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,368
but I wanna eat
New Year's noodles first.

330
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,744
[gasps]

331
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,168
[YUKI, KYO]
We're home.

332
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,670
[gasps]

333
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:26,300
[TOHRU]
Welcome home, you two.

334
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,684
[SHIGURE]
Honey, I'm home!

335
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,102
[HATSUHARU]
About time.

336
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:37,019
[SHIGURE]
Hm?

337
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,188
You're the last
one here, Sensei.

338
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,566
[SHIGURE] Ah, if it isn't
my two favorite Ha's.

339
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,359
Nice of you to greet
me at the door.

340
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,570
We have actual names, you know.

341
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,489
One of these days you'll learn
to have fun, I'm sure of it.

342
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,616
What's up? Long time no see.

343
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,034
Yeah, where are the others?

344
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,453
[SHIGURE]
Hmm.

345
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,580
Well, not to make a big
deal of it or anything,

346
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,166
but... they're skipping?

347
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,750
"They're skipping"?

348
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,252
Huh.

349
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:04,213
I can already feel the heat
of Kagura's fiery rage.

350
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:06,424
Which is nothing compared
to the bone‐chilling horror

351
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,218
of Akito's quiet fury.

352
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,554
[HATORI]
So, what do we do?

353
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:14,348
[SHIGURE] Relax. I can
handle Akito myself.

354
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,017
[HATSUHARU]
Sheesh.

355
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:19,187
And here I was looking forward
to my last fight of the year.

356
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:22,857
Calm down. Don't you go
breaking houses, too.

357
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:23,900
[HATSUHARU]
I guess...

358
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:27,278
...I can understand why
they'd wanna skip, though.

359
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:32,617
It's easier running from pain,
instead of facing it.

360
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:33,826
You're wrong there.

361
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:36,204
I don't think this was about
running away for them at all,

362
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,622
or at least not entirely.

363
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,624
Uh, what're you saying?

364
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,376
[MOMIJI] Shii‐<i>chan!</i>
You're finally here!

365
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,670
The banquet is about to start.

366
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:48,341
Oh! Momiji. I'm looking
forward to your dance.

367
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,467
[MOMIJI]
<i>Danke</i>!

368
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,844
There's something we
have to deal with first.

369
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:54,096
Who knows how Akito
will react to hearing

370
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,057
that those two are skipping.

371
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,892
Wait, who's skipping what?

372
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:00,895
Is someone not coming
to the banquet? Who? Who?

373
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:14,367
[SHIGURE]
Good evening.

374
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:19,956
[SHIGURE]
It's a pleasure to watch you

375
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:24,418
reaping what you sowed... Akito.

376
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,805
[TOHRU gasping]

377
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,890
What's wrong? Why are you
looking at me that way?

378
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:39,684
[KYO]
I need you to eat slower.

379
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:40,476
[TOHRU]
Hm?

380
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:43,896
But I'm pretty sure I'm eating
at a normal rate of speed.

381
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:46,357
Mochi is best when you
take time to savor it.

382
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,234
Just make sure you're
chewing it well.

383
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:51,362
You, too? What's up
with you guys?

384
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,489
[TOHRU] Do people really choke
on mochi that often,

385
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:56,534
or are they just being paranoid?

386
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,786
[phone ringing]

387
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:01,872
Oh, that's weird.
Who's calling so late?

388
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:07,545
Whoever it is, they got
pretty crap manners.

389
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,463
What if it's someone
from the estate?

390
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,590
[KYO gasps]

391
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:13,801
[KYO] Don't tell me Kagura
caused some kind of emergency.

392
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:16,304
[YUKI]
Did Akito fly into a frenzy?

393
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:20,558
[TOHRU]
Hello. May I ask who's calling?

394
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,018
[UOTANI]
Hey, Tohru. It's me.

395
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:26,063
Uo‐<i>chan</i>? Why are you calling
so late? Is everything okay?

396
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,231
Wait, please don't tell me

397
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:29,358
you ended up choking
on your mochi.

398
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,194
Yeah, no, that's something
only you would do.

399
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,322
Also, how could I call
you if I were choking?

400
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,656
That doesn't make sense.

401
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:37,908
[chuckles] You've got
a good point.

402
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,744
So what's the matter, then?

403
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,455
[UOTANI]
Nothing. I'm just saying hi.

404
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,206
I was worried you
might be feeling

405
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,417
a little lonely or something.

406
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,044
[TOHRU]
You called to check in on me?

407
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,420
Well, yeah.

408
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,881
Hanajima was saying
stuff about your waves

409
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,091
being agitated or whatever.

410
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,134
Huh?

411
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:56,844
Nuh‐uh, drop it
right now, Pops!

412
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:59,388
Our deal was you got one beer
in honor of the holiday.

413
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,390
Oh, yeah. I must've lost count.

414
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:03,976
Don't play dumb with me!
Trash the can.

415
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:05,728
Jeez. Hopeless geezer.

416
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,563
[TOHRU chuckles]

417
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:11,025
[TOHRU] You know,
I truly am a lucky girl.

418
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,860
[UOTANI]
Don't cry, stupid.

419
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:15,905
I gotta go, but have
a good New Year's.

420
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:19,033
Thanks. And the same
to you and your family.

421
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:20,284
[phone clicks]

422
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,246
That was Uo‐<i>chan</i> calling.

423
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,456
She was just checking in

424
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:28,626
because she was worried
about me for some reason.

425
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,503
Oh. I see.

426
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,088
But that's nice, isn't it?

427
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:32,630
‐‐Of course!

428
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,215
‐‐Speaking of your friends,
‐‐Of course!

429
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:38,719
we saw Hanajima earlier on
our way to the Soma estate.

430
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,221
What a coincidence.

431
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,389
[YUKI]
Indeed.

432
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,975
She was really concerned
about you, too, Miss Honda.

433
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,395
That's very kind of her.

434
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,771
Hana‐<i>chan</i>...

435
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:51,941
I'll make sure you're my first
phone call of the new year.

436
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,609
I'll be waiting.

437
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:56,612
So, um, are you sure
it's going to be okay

438
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:58,739
for you to miss the big banquet?

439
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:01,033
I promise, I'm glad
you're here with me,

440
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:03,285
but I don't wanna
get anyone in trouble.

441
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,412
No, it's fine.

442
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:08,290
We'll drop by and wish them a
happy New Year at some point.

443
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,667
[YUKI]
Probably.

444
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,006
[YUKI]
Thank you for cooking.

445
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,300
Of course, it was nothing.

446
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:23,222
[YUKI] Right about now, the
banquet should be in full swing.

447
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:27,643
[KYO]
I wonder how mad Kagura is.

448
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:33,607
[YUKI]
Akito must be furious, but...

449
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:36,527
[KYO]
But...

450
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:41,574
[humming]

451
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:49,373
It's so much colder
on the roof.

452
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:50,499
[YUKI]
Here.

453
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,544
Please be careful.

454
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:57,131
I will be. Thank you
for giving me a hand.

455
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:06,056
[TOHRU gasps, giggles]

456
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,310
Look, you guys,
the sun's coming up!

457
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:12,229
Perfect. Made it.

458
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,441
[YUKI]
I feel strangely at peace now.

459
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:17,818
I don't feel guilty, either.

460
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:21,071
[KYO] I had a lot of
reasons for coming back,

461
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:24,033
but if I'm being
honest, deep down...

462
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,451
So, are you ready?

463
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:27,661
You only get one chance
for a New Year's wish.

464
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:30,956
I've already got
mine figured out.

465
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,583
[YUKI]
Deep down...

466
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,252
[TOHRU gasps]

467
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:46,055
[KYO]
Deep down... all I wanted...

468
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,348
[YUKI]
All I really cared about

469
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:50,100
was greeting the new
year at her side.

470
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:53,854
Hey, Kyo, Soma.

471
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:56,565
I just wanna say
happy New Year!

472
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:59,193
I'm looking forward to
the next one with you.

473
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:01,862
The feeling is mutual.

474
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:03,823
Uh. Yeah, same.

475
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:11,580
[KYO] This is the year I'm
gonna beat that damn Rat!

476
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:14,750
[YUKI] Uh‐huh, sure.
Good luck with that.

477
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:32,226
[TOHRU] It's going to be
a wonderful new year!

478
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,946
[HATSUHARU]
"Yuki was my first love."
