1
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:15,641
[KAGURA]
Um.

2
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:16,767
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:20,187
I know I'm not expected,
but is it true?

4
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:22,147
Is Kyo here?

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,818
That's right. You don't know me.

6
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,904
I'm Kagura Soma.

7
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:30,447
Oh, Kyo's just inside.

8
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:33,992
Facing a strong
opponent: Chives.

9
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,745
[KAGURA]
It is true.

10
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:38,872
He came back to me.

11
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,918
‐‐Kyo, I'm here!
‐‐[TOHRU] Hey, wait!

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,420
[TOHRU] She's so cute and‐‐
Wait, what did she say?

13
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:48,632
If she's a Soma, then that
means she must be...

14
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:50,717
[SHIGURE]
Yuki.

15
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:53,136
Stop that. You'll
end up choking him.

16
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:55,389
[KAGURA]
Where are you?

17
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,099
Oh, hello there.

18
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,475
[KYO]
Wha‐‐? Kagura?

19
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:01,019
It's you.

20
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:05,107
You disappeared for
four whole months.

21
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:08,485
You didn't even
say bye. Nothing.

22
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:11,530
I was scared. Worried.

23
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:15,409
Do you know how
much I missed you?!

24
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,577
[TOHRU]
Huh?

25
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:52,506
[KAGURA]
I thought about you constantly!

26
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:55,842
You jerk!

27
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,844
Do you have any idea
what you put me through,

28
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:58,887
running off like that?

29
00:02:58,929 --> 00:02:59,596
Huh? Do ya?

30
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:01,348
[YUKI] Seems it's time
to replace the doors.

31
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,100
Why does everyone
go out of their way

32
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,726
to trash my poor house?

33
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:05,852
[TOHRU]
Are they okay?

34
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,938
Yeah, don't worry about them.

35
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,482
This is Kagura's way of
showing she cares for him.

36
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:11,900
You know, like how little kids

37
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:14,111
are always mean to
the people they like.

38
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,028
It's the same thing.

39
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,280
Sure, if you say so.

40
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,366
But, uh, doesn't it seem
like her personality

41
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:21,535
did a complete 180 to you?

42
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:24,037
She just gets that way
when she's emotional.

43
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:26,331
Especially whenever
Kyo's involved.

44
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:29,459
She may not act it, but she's
two years older than us.

45
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:32,045
That's right. And
part of the zodiac.

46
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:32,963
I knew it!

47
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:35,048
What year is she?
You've gotta tell me!

48
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,427
Uh. Watch her a while and
I bet you figure it out.

49
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:41,596
[TOHRU] I'm kinda worried
she's gonna end up killing him.

50
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:42,764
I doubt it.

51
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:43,932
[gasps]

52
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:49,187
[KAGURA]
Uh! Kyo! What happened?

53
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,982
You poor thing.
You're all beaten up!

54
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,276
Who did this to you, my love?

55
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,653
Cue the waterworks.

56
00:03:58,447 --> 00:03:59,573
[sneezes]

57
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,074
It's cold.

58
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:02,826
Yup. Breezy.

59
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:03,744
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:06,121
I think I was just so
excited to see Kyo again

61
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,540
that I couldn't
hold myself back.

62
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,417
[TOHRU] She's like a
totally different person.

63
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:12,961
But, Kyo, it is
partially your fault.

64
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:14,337
You disappeared for four months

65
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,631
and didn't even bother
to call me once.

66
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,593
Why should I have to worry
about telling you where I am?

67
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:20,469
Don't be silly.

68
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,637
Of course you should keep
your future wife in the know.

69
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,639
Future what now?!

70
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,559
I didn't know you had a
fiancÃ©e! That's so sweet.

71
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,561
[YUKI] You must be relieved
someone would consider

72
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:30,645
such a cruel fate.

73
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:31,354
[SHIGURE]
Congrats.

74
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,440
[KYO]
You guys aren't helping.

75
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:34,649
[KAGURA] You see,
when we were little,

76
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,735
Kyo told me we'd get
married one day.

77
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:39,404
[KYO] Only 'cause you threatened
me with kitchen knives!

78
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:40,906
What's wrong?

79
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,116
You should want to marry
another animal spirit.

80
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:45,577
It's your best chance
at happiness.

81
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,871
We could suffer our
curses together.

82
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:49,289
And of course,

83
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,374
we don't transform
when we hug each other.

84
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,001
Oh, whoa! It's true!

85
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,961
Watch, I can hug
Yun‐<i>chan</i>, too!

86
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,588
That's really interesting.

87
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,298
Why don't you change?

88
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,424
Wish I knew.

89
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:03,428
There are two others, though.
Female zodiac members, I mean.

90
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,721
And we've found that
they don't trigger

91
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,556
our transformations, either.

92
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:09,017
Really? Two more?
Where are they now?

93
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:11,144
Aw! I wanna meet them, too!

94
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:12,896
Would you like to
know their animals?

95
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:13,855
[TOHRU]
No, thank you.

96
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:15,857
On second thought, it'll
be a lot more exciting

97
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:18,527
if I get to see them and
figure it out for myself.

98
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:19,694
[YUKI chuckles]

99
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:20,821
That's very like you.

100
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,280
Anyway!

101
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,616
You know things don't usually
go so well for our kind

102
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,202
when we marry normal people
of the opposite sex.

103
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:28,745
Right, Shii‐<i>chan</i>?

104
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:30,747
Well, you have a point.

105
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,833
There are plenty of
problems tied to that.

106
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:35,293
It can be hard for us
to have regular jobs.

107
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,211
And of course,

108
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:39,172
you'd still transform every time
your spouse embraced you.

109
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:40,215
Sex wou‐‐

110
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:41,132
Too much.

111
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,259
[TOHRU]
Hm?

112
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,468
[KAGURA]
Kyo!

113
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,595
You can't play coy
with me anymore.

114
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:47,472
Tell me, do you like me or not?

115
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:48,181
Huh?

116
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:49,724
'Cause I like you so much.

117
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,560
More than anyone else
in the whole world.

118
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,144
No, make that the universe!

119
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,814
If I were your wife, I'd cook
you amazing food every day

120
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:59,109
and forgive any affairs as
momentary lapses of judgement.

121
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,443
No matter what
your feelings are,

122
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,529
it's obvious you're never
going to find another woman

123
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:03,947
who loves you as much as I do.

124
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:05,240
Understand?

125
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:06,032
Speak up!

126
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,784
Why aren't you agreeing with me?

127
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:10,537
[SHIGURE] He loses all boldness
when it comes to girls.

128
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:11,329
Oh, right.

129
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,415
Tohru, you're quite
a fan of the Cat.

130
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:14,374
What do you think of this?

131
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,586
What's that? A rival?

132
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,004
You can't have him.

133
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,255
I don't care what you feel,

134
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,465
nothing will stand in
the way of our future!

135
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,759
What is it you like about
him, anyway, Tohru?

136
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,512
Because I like all of him.
Every single bit.

137
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:30,223
I cherish the good things about
him along with his flaws.

138
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:33,018
Even if he were to change
into his true form,

139
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,937
I wouldn't think
of him any diff‐‐

140
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,106
Not another word.

141
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:43,361
[TOHRU]
His "true form"?

142
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:50,452
If you keep babbling on like
that, you're gonna regret it.

143
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:57,792
[KAGURA]
How dare you threaten me!

144
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:07,969
[TOHRU] I wonder what all that
"true form" stuff was about.

145
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,512
Well, whatever the case,

146
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:12,766
Kagura seems to be overflowing
with love for Kyo.

147
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,559
Unabashedly.

148
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:20,357
[TOHRU] It's amazing
she feels so strongly.

149
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,901
I haven't had my first love yet.

150
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,529
Oh, Kyo! I'm here to
scrub down your back!

151
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,114
[KYO growls]

152
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:31,284
Dear. No need to act
shy around me!

153
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:35,080
[TOHRU] Honestly, I think
I'm kind of jealous.

154
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,456
[KYO]
Dammit.

155
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:38,041
Why is this my job?

156
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:41,044
No complaining. You are
partially at fault here.

157
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:43,129
[KYO] Shut up! Are you
kidding me right now?!

158
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,715
Hey, you should be
pitching in, too, Rat‐boy!

159
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:47,092
No, thanks.

160
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,094
Cats should be able to
clean up their own messes,

161
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,220
even stupid cats.

162
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,680
What did you just say?

163
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,390
Stand up. We're
fighting this out.

164
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:54,599
‐‐[KAGURA] Hey, Kyo!
‐‐Uh. What?

165
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,393
Look at this!

166
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,186
Aw, a cute little kitty.

167
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,939
Quit playing around.
You're the one to blame for‐‐

168
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,066
[stomach growls]

169
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:06,569
I know it's a little early, but
I think I'll start on dinner.

170
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,279
Stay out of that kitchen!

171
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,239
Okay?

172
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,448
I'll cook tonight!

173
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,117
What? Why would you
want that hassle?

174
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,452
So I can treat my beloved Kyo.

175
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,037
Then why don't you
let me help you out?

176
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:19,249
Don't worry, I can handle
a simple meal on my own.

177
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,463
Kyo, dear. Hope you're
looking forward to it.

178
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:30,844
[SHIGURE] Kyo, dear. You should
have time to fix that door.

179
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:36,766
[TOHRU]
Wow! This is incredible!

180
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:39,769
I can't believe you just
whipped up such a nice meal!

181
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:40,979
Oh, stop.

182
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,982
Looks great, but how many
people are you feeding?

183
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,568
[SHIGURE]
So much for all our groceries.

184
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,778
I was so excited about
feeding my true love

185
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,072
that I may have gotten
a little carried away.

186
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:52,907
Uh, speaking of Kyo,
where is he?

187
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,075
Probably upstairs.

188
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,535
[KAGURA]
I'll go get him!

189
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,413
Dinner for my darling.

190
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:01,124
Dinner for my darling.

191
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,418
Darling! Your dinner is ready!

192
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,669
Not hungry.

193
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:07,047
[KAGURA] Don't lie. Your
tummy was growling earlier.

194
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,548
[KYO]
No, it wasn't.

195
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,050
I even cooked extra to make sure

196
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,843
you'd leave the table
nice and full.

197
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,011
Don't want any.

198
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,805
But why not? Some of your
favorite foods are on the table.

199
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:18,850
Lay off! I already
told you I'm good!

200
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,478
[KAGURA]
But this was for you.

201
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,982
I did my best to make you smile.

202
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,860
I wanted to feed my beloved!

203
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,570
[screams]

204
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,286
[TOHRU coughing]

205
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,580
Wha‐‐?! Oh my gosh!

206
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,707
Uh. Should we get some help?

207
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,335
Well, great.
The feast is ruined.

208
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,753
Oh, no!

209
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,506
Why does everyone
destroy my house?

210
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:52,425
I'm sorry, I'll make
more food right away.

211
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:55,470
Using what? The fridge is empty.

212
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,475
Go home already.

213
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:06,022
Kagura. Wait!

214
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:09,859
[SHIGURE]
Stay here. I've got this one.

215
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,032
Where are you off to?

216
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,158
The store.

217
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,789
At this hour? The roads
are dangerous at night.

218
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:24,541
[KAGURA]
Hey, Shii‐<i>chan</i>.

219
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:27,544
Do you think I could
live here with you?

220
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:30,171
I don't like him living
with another girl.

221
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:31,714
I'm worried.

222
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,385
You know you can't, so why ask?

223
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:38,054
[KAGURA] Apparently,
you don't understand love.

224
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:40,431
Or how anxious it
can make someone.

225
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,646
That's not true.

226
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:50,066
Even I get jealous sometimes.

227
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,322
Should I order delivery?

228
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,824
[KYO]
I'll take Katsudon.

229
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:00,577
No. Please, wait a bit longer.

230
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,585
[CLERK A]
That'll be 3,700 yen.

231
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:09,919
Got it.

232
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,047
[gasps]

233
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,925
[TOHRU]
Here. I'll take care of it, sir.

234
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:30,398
Here. How 'bout I carry
some of that for you?

235
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,941
I've got it.

236
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:35,695
[KAGURA]
Hey, Tohru.

237
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:37,030
Yes?

238
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,615
[KAGURA]
Do you like Kyo?

239
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,325
Well, that's a tough one.

240
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,868
You know, if it's a
yes or no question,

241
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,953
then of course
I like him, but...

242
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:45,496
I sort of always have.

243
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:49,542
Even when I was little, I loved
the Cat in the zodiac story.

244
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:51,336
Because of that,

245
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:55,673
you could call me a Year
of the Cat fan, I guess.

246
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,051
So you're a fan?

247
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,010
That's right!

248
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,511
When I heard the zodiac story,

249
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:04,182
all I wanted was to be
a Year of the Cat.

250
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,684
I think I get it.

251
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,603
But that's nothing.

252
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,230
I mean, the two of
you have been close

253
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,690
pretty much your whole
lives, haven't you?

254
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,527
[KAGURA]
That's true.

255
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,447
I first met him
when we were kids.

256
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,158
He was drawing a fried
egg in the dirt.

257
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,954
A fried egg?

258
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,580
[KAGURA]
Yeah.

259
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,086
[KAGURA]
Hiya.

260
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:36,130
If you want someone to
play with you, I will.

261
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,924
You mean it?

262
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:41,219
Yeah! Of course!

263
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:44,514
And from now on,
I'll stay by your side.

264
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:47,392
You and I will be
together forever!

265
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,276
[TOHRU]
That look...

266
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,653
I can tell you've
always liked him.

267
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:03,992
Hey, Tohru. I wanna thank you.

268
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:08,204
[KAGURA]
For coming to find me.

269
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:14,711
Come on, we should get home.

270
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,714
I bet everyone's gotta
be starving by now.

271
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,466
Yeah.

272
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:21,759
[TOHRU]
So, what're you gonna make?

273
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,553
[KAGURA] I was thinking
hamburger steaks.

274
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,221
[TOHRU]
I'd love to help, if you want.

275
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:26,514
[KAGURA]
Yes, please do!

276
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:29,100
[TOHRU]
My mouth is already watering.

277
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,019
[stomach growling]

278
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,938
It's possible I might starve.

279
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,523
Same.

280
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:36,983
‐‐[TOHRU] Hi, everyone.
‐‐[KAGURA] We're home.

281
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:38,568
And we're saved.

282
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:39,986
Welcome back, girls.

283
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,447
We'll get dinner together
as fast as we can.

284
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:45,116
I'll follow your lead.
Let's not waste any time, 'kay?

285
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,576
Right!

286
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,828
[TOHRU, YUKI giggle]

287
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:57,962
'Kay, these are almost ready.

288
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,839
Could you go ahead and
set the table maybe?

289
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:01,716
I'm already on it.

290
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:06,637
Dinner's about to be served.

291
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,681
Smells heavenly.

292
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:09,932
Where'd Kyo go?

293
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:13,394
[YUKI] He went upstairs a while
ago and hasn't come down yet.

294
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:19,359
Hey, Kyo! It's almost
time to eat dinner.

295
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,574
Ah, there you are.

296
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:29,160
I should've known
I'd find you up here.

297
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,662
The food'll be done in a minute.

298
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,456
I'm gonna pass.

299
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:36,417
Kagura worked really hard
to put it together, though.

300
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,878
She said she just wants
to make you happy.

301
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,297
[KYO] Yeah, well, she's always
saying crazy things.

302
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,508
Like all that marriage stuff.

303
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,676
There must be something
wrong with her brain.

304
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,428
It's so annoying.

305
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,304
[TOHRU]
But...

306
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:51,265
Isn't it a blessing to have
someone care about you?

307
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,559
Someone who worries
about your happiness

308
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,396
and wants to always
be by your side?

309
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:59,732
You know, I'd like to think
someone cares for me that way.

310
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:03,403
Even if that person and I are
separated by a huge distance.

311
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:06,197
I find it very reassuring.

312
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,657
And it's amazing to me

313
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,534
the way someone can
love another person

314
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,036
with their entire heart.

315
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,247
'Cause after all,
doesn't everybody dream

316
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:16,999
there's someone out there
destined to be with them?

317
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:20,670
Uh... I don't know about that.

318
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,130
I know what you dream of.

319
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,090
You wanna defeat
Soma, don't you?

320
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:27,385
That's why you went into
the mountains to train.

321
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:30,847
Ugh. Shigure's been blabbing.

322
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,015
[TOHRU] That training must
have been hard on you.

323
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:35,601
Especially since you were
by yourself out there.

324
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:38,855
[KYO] I wasn't alone. I had
my master there with me.

325
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,106
[TOHRU]
Oh, I didn't know.

326
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:42,400
Is he a very strong person?

327
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,402
Obviously, he has to be!

328
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:47,822
He's an amazing fighter.
Even Yuki couldn't beat the guy.

329
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:50,783
He's been teaching me since
I was just a little kid.

330
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:52,702
Which is why I've
gotten so strong.

331
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,787
Plus, even though he's a
member of the Soma clan,

332
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:56,831
he actually understands me.

333
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:58,958
You wouldn't believe
how tough he is.

334
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,711
I could hardly wait for
our lessons each morning.

335
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,921
Don't get me wrong,
the training was harsh,

336
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,507
but it was also
incredibly fulfilling.

337
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:09,177
I felt myself getting stronger.

338
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:12,346
Just thinking about it
gets me so pumped up.

339
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,515
[TOHRU]
I've never seen him so excited.

340
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:16,392
He's got so much passion.

341
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:20,438
[KYO] Man, I could really go for
a few sparring rounds right now.

342
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,274
[TOHRU] It's not that he
just wants to beat Soma.

343
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:26,277
He truly loves martial arts.

344
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,195
[KYO gasps]

345
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:30,531
Oh. This is probably boring
to a girl like you, I bet?

346
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:31,782
What? No way!

347
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,910
Okay, sure, I don't know
much about martial arts,

348
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:34,869
but I'm not bored at all!

349
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:37,163
I promise! This is
really interesting!

350
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:39,457
Yeah? 'Cause I'd be
bored in your shoes.

351
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,584
It's not like you care
about this stuff.

352
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,336
True, I do have trouble
not falling asleep

353
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,004
when people are talking
about, like, physics,

354
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:47,256
but I'm not completely
uninterested in martial arts.

355
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:48,633
I even know a few moves!

356
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,634
Like, let me think!

357
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:54,263
There's the, uh, um, what's
it called? Right‐handed jab!

358
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,145
Horrible.

359
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,025
[TOHRU] I feel like I've
caught another glimpse

360
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:08,861
of the true Kyo.

361
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:12,323
Underneath that grumpy look,
he always has on his face,

362
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:15,201
he's hiding an awkward smile.

363
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:21,082
Thank you for waiting.

364
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,960
[SHIGURE] You took so long, I
thought I was going to pass out.

365
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,003
Sorry 'bout that.

366
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,255
[KAGURA]
Here.

367
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:33,928
This one's yours.

368
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:39,725
[SHIGURE]
What's this?

369
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:42,645
Now why did Kyo get a
fried egg on top of his?

370
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:45,565
Looks good. Let's eat
it before it gets cold.

371
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:46,399
[SHIGURE]
Thanks for the food!

372
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,484
‐‐[YUKI] Thank you for the food.
‐‐[TOHRU] Thank you, Kagura.

373
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:50,236
This is delicious.

374
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:52,154
It really is.

375
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:57,243
My tastebuds are so happy.

376
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:13,384
What are you waiting for?
Have a seat and join us!

377
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,094
Sure.

378
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:16,470
[SHIGURE]
It's getting late, Kagura.

379
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,514
It would probably be best
if you stayed the night.

380
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:21,851
[KAGURA] Really? Yay!
Let's share a bed, Kyo.

381
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,102
[KYO]
Not on your life!

382
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:25,521
[KAGURA]
Aw, no need to be shy.

383
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:31,193
[KAGURA]
Today we must part.

384
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:34,280
Please be well, my love.
I'll come back to see you soon.

385
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:37,658
I'll be fine as long as you stay
as far away from me as possible!

386
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,869
Well, they're in high
spirits this morning.

387
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,329
So, what's your guess?

388
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,581
Did you figure out
Kagura's year?

389
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,750
No, I didn't.

390
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:46,250
[BOTH]
Huh?

391
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:50,254
Fine! Just for that, you're not
even getting a kiss goodbye!

392
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:53,174
I'm not going to take any
more of your punches‐‐

393

394
00:18:56,427 --> 00:19:00,389
I can't believe him.
How can he be so mean?

395
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:02,516
But... I love him!

396
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,185
‐‐[SHIGURE, KYO] Who's that?
‐‐Someone's there!

397
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,691
Oh, good morning.
How can I help you, sir?

398
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:13,903
Oh, I, uh... forgot
to deliver your paper.

399
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,988
Thank you!

400
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,657
[SHIGURE]
Perfect save.

401
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,825
[TOHRU] Soma's even more
dazzling than usual

402
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:20,660
this morning.

403
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:24,455
That was a close one.
Be more careful, Kagura.

404
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:25,623
[KAGURA]
Sorry.

405
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:26,540
[gasps]

406
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:27,917
[KAGURA]
I didn't know there'd be a man

407
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,127
on the other side of the door.

408
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,962
Okay, I figured out her year.

409
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,632
It turns out her zodiac
is the Year of the Boar.

410
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:37,468
[SHIGURE] I don't think this
counts as "figuring it out."

411
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:40,221
And yet, you seem so
pleased with yourself.

412
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,722
This makes perfect sense.

413
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:44,225
When you have a goal,
it's all you can think about.

414
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,977
This must be the Boar's
influence on you.

415
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,438
[SHIGURE] That's less of a
deduction and more of a fact.

416
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,898
I've gotta hug you.

417
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,859
You're the cutest little piggy
I could ever imagine.

418
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,319
She's ignoring me.

419
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:58,030
Hey, Kagura. I think
I kinda see now.

420
00:19:58,072 --> 00:19:59,448
At first, I didn't understand

421
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,826
what could make you
love Kyo so much.

422
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,035
But after last night,

423
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:06,539
I can tell there are a bunch
of great things about him.

424
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,249
I hope I can see more of them...

425
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,502
How dare you cheat on me!

426
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:12,294
I knew it!

427
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,755
I can't take my eyes off of
you for a single second!

428
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:16,298
[KYO]
What are you talking about?

429
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,509
I thought you said you'd
forgive his affairs.

430
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:21,178
I never said he wouldn't
be punished first!

431
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,513
[TOHRU]
Excuse me.

432
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,640
I think there's a
misunderstanding.

433
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:26,934
I meant that I wanna become
someone more like you,

434
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:28,519
who's able to see
the good in people

435
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,479
even when it isn't obvious.

436
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:32,022
Does that make sense?

00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,065
[gasps]

438
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:35,735
You mean it? Like, for real?

439
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:39,613
Yeah! I think it's a fantastic
trait to have, don't you?

440
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:40,865
[gasps]

441
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:44,118
Yeah, I do.

442
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,036
Put some clothes on!

443
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,914
You need more training, dummy.

444
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:53,586
[KAGURA]
See ya later, darling!

445
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,588
Let's get together real soon!

446
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:58,299

Hurricane Kagura has passed.

447
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,467
Darn it.

448
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:02,845
With all this chaos at home,
I didn't get to plant anything.

grow something new

451
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,932
at your secret base?

452
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,517
Yeah, strawberries.

453
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,354
Really? I love strawberries.

454
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,690
I'd hoped you might like them.

455
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,528
We're gonna be late.

456
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:31,123
[TOHRU] For some reason, I have
way more motivation lately.

457
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:32,458
[TOHRU]
I'll take these.

458
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,419
[LIBRARIAN A]
All right. One moment.

459
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:36,962
[TOHRU] I wanna learn
more about the things

460
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:39,256
that Kyo and Soma
are interested in.

461
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,634
And what they dislike, too!

462
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:45,179
If I do that, then maybe...

463
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:46,806
...maybe I'll get to
see more of the sides

464
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:49,141
that they keep hidden
from the world.

465
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:51,435
At least, I hope that happens.

466
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,479
[MAYUKO]
Oh, there you are.

467

you in the staff room.

weren't waiting long.

[gasps]

471
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,918
[TOHRU]
I'd gotten too comfortable.

472
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,295
I knew my living
situation was temporary

473
