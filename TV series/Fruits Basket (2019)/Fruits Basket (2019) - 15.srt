1
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:14,598
[TOHRU gasps]

2
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,727
[TOHRU]
It's so beautiful! And big!

3
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:21,104
Do you really find it
that remarkable?

4
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:24,775
Yes! I've never actually
seen a lake in person!

5
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:26,401
[chuckles]

6
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:29,655
This is just the sort of cabin
Jason might show up at.

7
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,489
Jason?

8
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:33,325
A particularly vicious bear
that lives around here.

9
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:35,285
I thought everybody knew that.

10
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:37,704
Yeah! Of course
I know about it!

11
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:38,872
[HATORI]
Shigure.

12
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:41,375
I wonder why someone
would name a bear Jason.

13
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,293
[HATORI, YUKI sigh]

14
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:44,670
[TOHRU]
Wow, Mom.

15
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:47,464
It's amazing how quickly
things happen lately.

16
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:50,634
We've suddenly found ourselves
at the Soma vacation house.

17
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:52,469
I was surprised when
Hatori came, too,

18
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:55,305
but that just makes the
trip even more perfect.

19
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:56,765
Except...

20
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:58,308
[YUKI]
Hey, Miss Honda?

21
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,352
Yes?

22
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,688
Well, um...

23
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,653
[YUKI]
Never mind.

24
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:12,573
It's nothing. Sorry.

25
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:15,909
[TOHRU]
I don't know what...

26
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:20,247
[TOHRU] ...but something
strange is going on.

27
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:23,417
Yuki and Kyo don't
seem like themselves.

28
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:00,389
[TOHRU]
It started last night.

29
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,558
We were eating dinner after
visiting the gravesite.

30
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,240
So, um...

31
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,158
Hello, kids.

32
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,077
I‐I hope your errand went well.

33
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,078
It did.

34
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,289
Now tell me, who would like
to go on a trip tomorrow?

35
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,040
[TOHRU, KYO, YUKI]
Huh?

36
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:29,918
A trip! It'll be the first
day of Golden Week.

37
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,129
What better time to
get away from it all?

38
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,715
'Kay, what's with the
last‐minute vacation planning?

39
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,466
You drunk or somethin'?

40
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:38,969
I may drink,
but I never get drunk.

41
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,054
[YUKI] I'm not really sure
we'd know the difference.

42
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:42,514
Let's go.

43
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,224
The Soma family
maintains a lake house

44
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:45,684
for just such an occasion.

45
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,185
Well? You in?

46
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,854
Uh. Oh, no, I couldn't possibly.

47
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,022
I mean, I already went on the
previous Soma vacation, so‐‐

48
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,858
Ah, but you see,
that trip doesn't count

49
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,193
because I didn't
get to go with you.

50
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,655
Such a shame,
missing out like that.

51
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:01,658
I was heartbroken.

52
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,784
Then let's go!

53
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:03,994
[YUKI, KYO]
You manipulator!

54
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,120
Well, it's settled.

55
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:07,789
I assume you boys
will be coming along?

56
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,666
Unless, of course,
you want Tohru and me

57
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,543
to be all alone in the
wilderness together.

58
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:12,419
[BOTH grunt]

59
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:14,588
Then off we go!

60
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:18,133
Hop in the car and we'll
be there in no time.

61
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:18,925
[SHIGURE sighs]

62
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,427
Thank you for
volunteering, Doc.

63
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:22,929
You're such an excellent driver.

64
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,556
[TOHRU]
And there you have it, Mom.

65
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,809
That's how we ended up
at this cabin by the lake.

66
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,020
But these two still seem upset.

67
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,481
I'm really starting to worry.

68
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,524
Hey, why'd you really pack us up

69
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:36,485
and bring us out
here so suddenly?

70
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:37,235
Huh?

71
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,738
You have always had
an ulterior motive.

72
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,073
Your lack of trust saddens me.

73
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,325
Can't a man just take a trip

74
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,368
with the people he
cares most about?

75
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,245
Perhaps instead
of tormenting me,

76
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,164
you should make the most
of our lovely surroundings

77
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:51,958
and take Tohru for a
walk down by the lake.

78
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:56,713
Hey, what's wrong with
you two? So moody!

79
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:59,216
No, it's okay. I don't
mind going by myself.

80
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:00,217
[SHIGURE]
Hmm...

81
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:04,262
This won't do. We need
someone to brighten the mood.

82
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,014
I know! I'll call Aya!

83
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:08,517
[growls]

84
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,602
[KYO, YUKI]
Call him and you die.

85
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,145
[SHIGURE chuckles]

86
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:13,605
[HATORI groans]

87
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,233
[SHIGURE] Serves them
right for not going

88
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,651
the first time I asked.

89
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,986
They've both been a bit
down since yesterday.

90
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,613
It's odd.

91
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,949
You know, I think I've figured
out the real reason

92
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,493
for this impromptu getaway.

93
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:29,913
It's all a ploy to
torment your editor.

94
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:32,082
[screams]

95
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,208
[COWORKER A]
Mii‐<i>chan</i>, just come back

96
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,835
to the office for now, okay?

97
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,629
It'll be fine, I promise.
He's only teasing you again.

98
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,881
So please, don't do
anything drastic!

99
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:44,261
It's all in good fun.
I'm just teasing her a little.

100
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,513
[HATORI]
I pity that poor woman.

101
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,814
[grunts]

102
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,065
[TOHRU]
I'm not sure how much longer

103
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:59,359
I can handle the awkwardness.

104
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:02,445
It's so bad, they
aren't even arguing.

105
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,155
Everything seemed pretty
normal yesterday

106
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,949
when we went to visit the grave.

107
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:08,660
So what happened?

108
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:09,578
Oh, no!

109
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,079
The only explanation
I can think of

110
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,914
is that they're angry with me!

111
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,417
Maybe I did something rude
while we were having our picnic.

112
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,168
I have to fix this!

113
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:20,964
[TOHRU]
Um, guys.

114
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,050
[TOHRU]
I'm really sorry!

115
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,093
[KYO, YUKI]
Huh?

116
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:27,637
[TOHRU] I know that
sometimes I'm super spacey.

117
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,931
I can be rude without
realizing it.

118
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:33,143
So... So if I did
something to offend you,

119
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:37,480
please tell me what it was
and I won't ever do it again.

120
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,941
I won't. I swear.

121
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:42,110
But please...

122
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:44,070
[TOHRU]
...go back to normal.

123
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,573
Wait, Miss Honda.
I don't understand.

124
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:49,951
Yeah, me neither. What the
heck are you talking ab‐‐? Ah!

125
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:52,913
Oh, no! Are you okay?

126
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:55,790
Damn it. What is that, anyway?

127
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,879
A... footprint?

128
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:01,880
It's Jason!

129
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:02,839
Jason's here?!

130
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:04,215
Thanks, Shigure.

131
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,885
What should we do?
Shigure said he was vicious!

132
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,887
We have to go right now! Ah!

133
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:11,890
Miss Honda!

134
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:12,682
[KYO gasps]

135
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:13,850
[MITSURU] You have to
stop torturing me...

136
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:15,769
[SHIGURE]
Calm down, it's fine.

137
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,897
The manuscript is already
finished. It was a joke.

138
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:19,981
‐‐[MITSURU] Then turn it in!
‐‐Yeah, yeah.

139
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,399
‐‐Please, Sensei.
‐‐Okay.

140
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,359
‐‐Just turn it in!
‐‐Bye, now.

141
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,610
[MITSURU screaming]

142
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:28,406
Happy? I told my editor
the truth, as instructed.

143
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,699
Was that so hard?

144
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:32,577
But who's going to keep
me entertained now?

145
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,079
Hey, I'm bored, too.

146
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,666
Oh, dear! No, we can't
have Doc Hatori bored.

147
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:41,920
Never fear, I have just the
thing. A little light reading.

148
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:45,006
It won't kill you to sit back
and relax with a book.

149
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:48,593
You've always enjoyed reading,
almost as much as me.

150
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,303
[HATORI]
I see.

151
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:54,015
[HATORI]
It's because of Kana's wedding.

152
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:57,018
Maybe this is his way
of looking out for me.

153
00:07:58,353 --> 00:07:59,396
[HATORI]
Shigure.

154
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,605
Yes?

155
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:01,898
Thanks.

156
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,987
Reading a book does sound nice.

157
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,488
It's been awhile.

158
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:13,743
[SHIGURE] I wonder how Tohru
and the boys are getting along.

159
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:16,204
[HATORI]
With her there, they'll be fine.

160
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:22,085
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

161
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:24,045
[YUKI]
Miss Honda, are you okay?

162
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,131
Yuki! I'm so sorry!

163
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,842
Come on. Look where
you're goin', will ya?

164
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,343
[TOHRU]
Sorry.

165
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:31,970
[YUKI]
Like you have room to talk.

166
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,848
You're the one who tripped
first. Over a footprint.

167
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,183
Yeah? What the hell do you know?

168
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,602
A shut‐in like you doesn't
belong in the woods!

169
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,021
[YUKI] Seems I'm doing
better than you,

170
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:43,648
despite all your so‐called
training in the mountains.

171
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,776
Screw you, Rat! Go back
and mope in your room.

172
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:48,862
You wouldn't even last
two days out here.

173
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,905
You've got no survival skills.

174
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,908
[YUKI] At least I'm not an idiot
with no knowledge of the world.

175
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,952
So you know, Jason isn't a bear.

176
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:57,495
He's a character
from a horror movie.

177
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,414
[KYO] So there's a bear
in a horror movie.

178
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:00,540
What do I care?

179
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:01,708
[YUKI]
Like I said: Idiot.

180
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,084
You're dead! I mean it.

181
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,253
I'm gonna freakin' kill
you for real this time!

182
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,380
[YUKI] You keep saying
that, and yet, I live.

183
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:09,049
Ditch your little
rodent buddies.

184
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,468
Fight fair and square
like a real man!

185
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,011
[YUKI]
Given our respective sizes,

186
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,846
you'd have an unfair advantage.

187
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,182
[TOHRU giggles]

188
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,725
You're back to fighting!

189
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:22,353
[giggling]

190
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,480
[YUKI]
Are you okay?

191
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,231
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
be laughing.

192
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:28,068
You were in the middle
of a serious argument.

193
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,528
That was rude of me.

194
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,407
I couldn't help it.
I was just so relieved.

195
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:38,495
I never thought I would be
this happy to watch you fight.

196
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:42,332
But it means you guys
are finally back to normal.

197
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,334
I'm so weird.

198
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:48,129
[TOHRU laughing]

199
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:51,174
[YUKI]
Miss Honda, you know...

200
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:53,218
What you said right
before you fell,

201
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,095
about whether we
were mad at you.

202
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:58,640
I just want you to know,
it wasn't that at all.

203
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:04,187
If it seemed like I was
angry, it's because...

204
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:05,772
...because...

205
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:08,983
...I guess I just
wasn't feeling well.

206
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,861
But I'm doing better now.

207
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:15,365
And I'm sorry for
making you worry.

208
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,242
[KYO]
Same here.

209
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,620
I wasn't mad or anything.

210
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:24,499
Just... wasn't feelin' so great.

211
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,334
You know, like Rat Boy said.

212
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:27,293
[YUKI]
Copying me?

213
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:27,961
No!

214
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:30,130
[TOHRU gasps, screams]

215
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,342
[TOHRU]
Anyway, thanks for telling me.

216
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:37,011
I'm glad it was just because
you weren't feeling well.

217
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,305
Wait! I mean, I'm not
glad you were sick.

218
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,933
But I am happy that
nothing's changed.

219
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,184
Why would it?

220
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:45,728
I promise you,
everything is the same.

221
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,188
[BOTH] I still hate
this guy every bit

222
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,815
as much as I always have.

223
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:50,567
Huh? What was that?

224
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:51,734
Did you say something?

225
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,570
[KYO] Yeah! That I'm gonna
hate your stupid guts

226
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,029
for the rest of my life!

227
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,866
[YUKI] I assure you, the
feeling is entirely mutual.

228
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:01,077
[TOHRU laughing]

229
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,579
[TOHRU]
That's much better.

230
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:06,374
It's good to see them
so full of life again.

231
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,376
I'm happier when they're
screaming at each other

232
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:09,836
than when they're quiet.

233
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:12,088
That's probably pretty strange.

234
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:16,593
But somehow, for them,
it feels right.

235
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:19,220
[YUKI] Why don't we head
back to the cabin?

236
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:21,347
[KYO] We'll go down
to the lake tomorrow.

237
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,640
[TOHRU]
Okay!

238
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,439
You like it?

239
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,191
It's revolting.

240
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,572
[YUKI]
Are you ready to go?

241
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,407
[TOHRU]
Yep! I'm all set.

242
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:40,825
You're going to the lake?

243
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,285
Try not to fall in, Kyo.

244
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,162
Like I would!

245
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,414
[YUKI]
No guarantees Miss Honda won't.

246
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:49,459
Well, we're going.
We'll see ya later.

247
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,543
Uh.

248
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:54,422
[SHIGURE] Is the good
doctor taking a nap?

249
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:55,006
[TOHRU]
Yes.

250
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,425
Huh. Hatori actually sleeps?

251
00:11:57,467 --> 00:12:00,845
Naturally. People tend to
die without sleep, you know.

252
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:03,223
I'm aware of that, idiot.

253
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,474
But he doesn't seem
like the type

254
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:07,268
who'd fall asleep in
front of other people.

255
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,395
Ah. Hm.

256
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,482
It's unusual, but he's tired.

257
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:15,151
He's been through a lot lately.

258
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:16,986
Here. A blanket.

259
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:19,113
He might catch cold
if he's not covered up.

260
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,949
You're so kind, Tohru.

261
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,951
You'll make a wonderful
wife someday!

262
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,661
[TOHRU]
Uh! It's just a blanket.

263
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:25,954
[BOTH]
You idiot.

264
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:29,207
[AYAME] He's right. That
was wondrously attentive.

265
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,417
Allow me to praise you.

266
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,340
What's wrong?
You're all so quiet.

267
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,300
Because a snake
suddenly showed up!

268
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:42,470
Why do you keep doin' that?!
Where'd you slither in from?

269
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,973
I came through the door
like a civilized person.

270
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,558
Not the sharpest tool in the
shed are you, Kyonkichi?

271
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,435
[KYO]
Shut up. I'm plenty sharp!

272
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:50,603
‐‐Um, hello, Ayame. It's nice‐‐

273
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:51,771
‐‐[YUKI] Stay back.
‐‐Um, hello, Ayame. It's nice‐‐

274
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:53,690
I do not trust this viper.

275
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:54,607
[AYAME]
Greetings!

276
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:58,111
No doubt the mere sight of me
has taken your breath away,

277
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,946
but please calm yourselves.

278
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:02,115
I came out here on
important business,

279
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,534
thanks to a certain
interested party.

280
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,577
[YUKI, KYO]
But who would‐‐? You!

281
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,914
Ah! Wait! Hold on! it wasn't me!

282
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,874
There's nothing
to fear, darling!

283
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,626
Should the world turn on you,

284
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:17,005
I will remain ever at your
side, steadfast and true.

285
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:20,091
<i>Je t'aime, mon amour</i>.
<i>Bon voyage!</i>

286
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:23,344
Aya! You are the only
one I can depend upon!

287
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:25,805
<i>Annyeong hasimnikka!</i>

288
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,640
Will you quit screwin'
around and tell us

289
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,392
what the heck
you're doin' here?!

290
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:32,270
Now, now. No reason
to get testy.

291
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:35,273
In the words of
William Shakespeare,

292
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:39,527
"Love all, trust a few,
do wrong to none."

293
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:42,447
Okay. Your point?

294
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,241
It's such a great line.

295
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:47,368
[YUKI, KYO]
You just wanted to say it?

296
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,496
I'm tired. Just seeing
you is exhausting.

297
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,832
Go home. There's no reason
for you to be here!

298
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,208
How rude!

299
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,127
Behold, my reason.

300
00:13:56,169 --> 00:14:00,465
Yuki. Today, we will deepen
our brotherly bonds.

301
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,426
I'll drown you in the lake
myself before that happens.

302
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:06,763
[AYAME] How poetic! We shall
be together even in death.

303
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,765
[YUKI] I wasn't planning
to drown with you!

304
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,558
Um.

305
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,976
What have I told
you about making

306
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,270
a nuisance of
yourself, Ayame?

307
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:15,980
Why, hello, there, Tori.

308
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:19,025
I'm sorry. Did we
wake you up, Hatori?

309
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:20,818
I don't know anybody
who could sleep through

310
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,362
all of that yelling.

311
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,697
[SHIGURE] Sorry for ruining
your beauty rest.

312
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:25,990
Had I known you were sleeping,

313
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:28,785
I would've been as quiet
as a mouse, sweet Tori!

314
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,953
[HATORI]
Somehow I doubt that.

315
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,664
Well? What brings you
to the lake house?

316
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,583
Oh. Simple, really.

317
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:36,542
I went to the main estate,

318
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,586
where I spoke to a maid,
who was 53 years old,

319
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:40,671
and she told me you'd
gone to the cabin.

320
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,257
I immediately decided
to join you here.

321
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,718
I got in a car and
the rest is history.

322
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,761
[YUKI]
You've got to be kidding.

323
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:50,014
[KYO] Sure, he answers Hatori's
questions right away.

324
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,266
Yuki. Kyo. You should be going.

325
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,520
Didn't you have plans to take
Honda down to the lake today?

326
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,521
[YUKI, KYO grunt]

327
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,272
Uh! Is that true, boys?

328
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,941
Then you had best make haste.

329
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,360
You gentlemen are
escorting a young lady.

330
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,320
And she should not
be kept waiting.

331
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:06,364
I don't know why you're
not gone already.

332
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:07,990
[YUKI, KYO]
It's your damn fault.

333
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,368
Right! We've got our things,
so we'll be going now.

334
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,204
Wouldn't wanna waste
this beautiful day! Bye!

335
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,668
[SHIGURE] I figured you'd at
least try to go with them.

336
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:22,255
And spoil their fun? What sort
of lout do you take me for?

337
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,673
Besides, it's been so long

338
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:26,634
since the three of us had
quality time together.

339
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,428
The night is ours.

340
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:31,806
You won't sleep a wink, lover.

341
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,182
I can't wait.

342
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:37,145
It will be a pleasure to share
your dreams tonight, sweetling.

343
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,604
[BOTH]
Nice!

344
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,815
Doesn't that ever get old?

345
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:47,947
[TOHRU sighs]

346
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:48,948
Looking at this view,

347
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:52,285
you can almost feel your
worries melting away.

348
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,581
[YUKI] That jerk. Is he
gonna stay the night?

349
00:15:56,622 --> 00:16:00,168
He's your idiot brother.
Do somethin' about him.

350
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,420
Don't you think
I would if I could?

351
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,714
I hate people
who're so dependent.

352
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:07,049
You're the one piggybacking
off of Shigure.

353
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,343
Sounds like dependency's
a family trait.

354
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,637
Shut up. That's none
of your business!

355
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,264
Don't talk to me about my life!

356
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,183
I don't wanna
talk to you at all.

357
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,809
The only reason I'm
even lookin' at you

358
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:18,561
is 'cause you're in my space.

359
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:19,437
[YUKI]
In that case,

360
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:20,813
‐‐[YUKI] maybe you should leave.
‐‐Hey, you guys.

361
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:21,856
‐‐[KYO] I wish I could.
‐‐Let's calm down.

362
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:23,024
‐‐Trust me.
‐‐Let's calm down.

363
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,026
You really think I'd be
at the damn lake with you

364
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,402
if I had a choice?

365
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:28,321
I promise, being here
is an exercise

366
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,989
in torture for me, too.

367
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:32,366
Ha! Well, this dumb place‐‐

368
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,409
[YUKI, KYO]
Uh.

369
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,662
It's not that, Miss Honda.

370
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,539
I just don't like
it that he's here.

371
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:39,832
That's the problem.

372
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:41,709
Right.

373
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:42,668
Huh?

374
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,170
[YUKI, KYO]
Uh...

375
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:47,924
[YUKI]
I mean. Uh, never mind.

376
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,134
[KYO]
As long as you understand.

377
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,725
[TOHRU]
Isn't it beautiful?

378
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:59,393
Maybe we should do
a lap around the lake

379
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,103
so we can see the whole thing.

380
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,438
[YUKI]
Okay.

381
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,731
[KYO]
Sure.

382
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:10,988
[AYAME]
This is for you.

383
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:11,906
What's that?

384
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:15,201
A photo. It was taken
at Kana's wedding.

385
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:17,745
Whether or not you look
at it is up to you.

386
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:19,997
Hold on. You went?

387
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,042
No, no. It was a
gift from Mayu.

388
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:25,878
Really? You ran
into Mayu, huh?

389
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,673
Indeed. The Mayu who
dumped you after a month.

390
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,424
The same Mayu who said
you were nothing more

391
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:31,968
than a "ripple on the water."

392
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:35,096
Ah. The Mayuko who was good
friends with Kana in college

393
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,890
and lost interest in you
almost immediately.

394
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:41,811
Uh. Yes, well, I was
young back then.

395
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:45,982
So anyway, I take it you didn't
go to the wedding, either.

396
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,734
Can't blame you for not
wanting to see her.

397
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,153
[HATORI] I was afraid she
might get flashbacks.

398
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,906
I didn't overwrite her
memories with others.

399
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:55,199
It would've been problematic

400
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:57,076
if she'd happened to
remember something.

401
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:58,494
Would it, though?

402
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:00,288
If she had remembered you,

403
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,999
maybe you two could've
fallen in love again.

404
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,875
Stealing the bride
on the wedding day,

405
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,544
how very dramatic.

406
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,546
Like something out of a movie.

407
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:11,173
No, it's over. Kana and me.

408
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,926
We could never go back.

409
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:19,640
If we tried, it would only
end in sorrow. Again.

410
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:22,310
[HATORI] We can't be
the people we once were.

411
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,644
The naive couple who thought

412
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:26,731
they would spend
their lives together.

413
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,066
The guilt would always be there.

414
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,903
It would fester and
fester until, inevitably,

415
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,323
she would fall ill again.

416
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:38,993
I would like to believe that
we still love each other,

417
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:43,039
but being with her is no
longer something I want.

418
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,208
Nor do I have any
desire to see her.

419
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,836
[HATORI]
All I can do is pray...

420
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:51,922
...that she'll be happy.

421
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,508
I cannot accept that.

422
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,552
Yes, I'm biased in your favor,

423
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:59,513
but that doesn't change
how wrong all of this is.

424
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,724
It's not fair to you.

425
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:03,184
Kana has it easy.

426
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,352
She's forgotten everything

427
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,520
and found her chance
at happiness.

428
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,064
And you're stuck
shouldering the burden

429
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,983
of those memories all alone.

430
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:15,029
I can't help but feel that she's
left you behind with nothing!

431
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,489
Has she?

432
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:22,995
I wouldn't say that.

433
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:24,747
This is the problem with you!

434
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,248
Kindness is your
greatest strength

435
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,042
and your biggest weakness.

436
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:31,420
It's why you get hurt. Why you
endure needless suffering.

437
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:35,132
He's right. Nice guys
get taken advantage of.

438
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,260
[HATORI] That's rich,
coming from the two of you.

439
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:41,097
Fine, I won't tell you to
get back together with her.

440
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:44,308
However, I want to make
one thing perfectly clear.

441
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:48,145
Whatever it may take,
somehow, someway, Tori,

442
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:52,191
I want you to be approximately
2,000 times happier than Kana.

443
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:54,610
Okay. Why 2,000?

444
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:57,238
One thousand is too little!

445
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,447
[HATORI]
Hm.

446
00:19:58,489 --> 00:19:59,532
You should try showing this

447
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:02,910
aggressive side of yourself
to Yuki sometime.

448
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:04,829
Uh. Should I?

449
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,789
Hmm...

450
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,833
All right. No Kana.

451
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,919
But maybe... you'll find
someone else to love.

452
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:15,214
Someone who doesn't bring
you pain and sadness.

453
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:18,759
A woman who brings you
joy and hope instead.

454
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:21,595
Well said, Gure!
You're such a poet.

455
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:24,515
As a novelist, I take
offense at that.

456
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:27,143
[HATORI]
Someone else to love?

457
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:30,146
That would be a foolish
thing to hope for.

458
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:33,858
Better to be grateful
for what I had.

459
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,152
Cursed as we are,

460
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:39,447
perhaps having a short time
with someone like Kana

461
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:44,034
is the most we can
expect from life.

462
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:48,372
I don't believe I could
ask for anything more.

463
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,834
[SHIGURE]
Ah. They're back.

464
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:58,758
[HATORI]
All I can do is watch over them.

465
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,887
So they don't make
the same mistakes.

466
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:06,807
So their smiles don't
wither and die.

467
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:08,934
Yuki! You've returned!

468
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,603
Did you have fun
with your friends?

469
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,438
I am not his friend!

470
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,939
‐‐By the way,
‐‐[KYO] Hey!

471
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:17,401
Tori gave me some sound advice
regarding our relationship.

472
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,153
I shall be more aggressive
in my attempts

473
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:20,946
to deepen our brotherly bonds.

474
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,491
That is no doubt
the best course.

475
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:26,452
[YUKI] Or maybe you could
just give up instead.

476
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:30,080
Sorry, but, um, what
do you mean, aggressive?

477
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:33,042
You see, Yuki is my
younger brother,

478
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,377
and I am his older brother.

479
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:38,714
With that truth in mind,
I declare the following:

480
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:44,386
Yuki, as I am your elder,
you must obey me!

481
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,476
[YUKI]
Not in a million years!

482
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:52,520
[AYAME screaming]

483
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:55,105
Ayame doesn't get it.

484
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,857
Not even a little.

485
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:01,153
[SHIGURE]
He's not the only one, Hatori.

486
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:04,031
You still have your whole
life ahead of you.

487
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,827
[CLASSMATE D] How's it
goin', Ms. Mayu‐<i>chan</i>?

488
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:10,538
[MAYUKO] Hey, show your
teacher some respect.

489
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,581
It's "Ms. Mayuko
the Great to you."

490
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:13,833
[CLASSMATE C laughs]

491
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:17,127
Working hard, Ms. Mayuko
the Great? It's a holiday.

492
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,005
Yeah, I sure am. And it blows.

493
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,048
You here for club?

494
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,424
[GIRLS]
That's right!

495
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,760
[CLASSMATE C] Well, see ya,
Ms. Mayuko the Great. Heh.

496
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:26,887
[MAYUKO] Yeah, yeah.
Be careful on the way home.

497
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:27,471
[GIRLS]
Okay.

498
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:31,267
[SHIGURE] Who knows?
You might find someone yet.

499
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:07,029
[UOTANI]
"She said don't step on 'em!"
