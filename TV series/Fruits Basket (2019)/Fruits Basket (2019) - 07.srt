1
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:16,350
Hey! I can't find her.
She's gone!

2
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:17,684
Don't get your
whiskers in a knot.

3
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,686
She said she was going
out to visit a friend.

4
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:22,606
Are you incapable of
listening when people talk?

5
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:23,315
Uh.

6
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:26,068
She never goes out, so what
am I supposed to think?!

7
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,570
Well, I'd say Kyo's
hissy fit has shown us

8
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:32,574
just how much a part of the
household Tohru's become.

9
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:35,827
He's positively lost
without our fair maiden.

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,123
[TOHRU]
Wow. This place is huge.

11
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,042
I came without telling
Soma and the others

12
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:43,961
just like Hatori said I should,

13
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:46,547
but now I wonder if that
was such a good idea.

14
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,465
[MOMIJI]
Tohru! <i>Hallo</i>!

15
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:49,883
[TOHRU yelping]

16
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:52,219
[MOMIJI]
You're here right on time!

17
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:53,762
I'm sorry! You startled me!

18
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:55,597
‐‐[door opens]
‐‐Huh?

19
00:00:57,975 --> 00:01:00,852
Come on in. Welcome
to the Soma estate.

20
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,313
Thanks. It's really something.

21
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:05,482
Harry's house is down this way.

22
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:11,154
[TOHRU]
I can't believe how quiet it is.

23
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:14,366
Almost like nobody
actually lives here.

24
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:17,202
I guess it's sort of peaceful.

25
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:19,913
But it's also
making me nervous!

26
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,250
Welcome to my home.

27
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:25,252
[TOHRU panting]

28
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:27,796
[HATORI] I didn't realize the
walk here was so arduous.

29
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:29,506
Oh, it's not.

30
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:31,133
Come on in and have a seat.

31
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:33,302
Momiji, bring us
something to drink.

32
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:34,511
<i>Ja</i>!

33
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:36,805
A drink sounds great, thanks.

34
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,408
[TOHRU]
Huh.

35
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:22,953
It's kinda surprising to see a
woman's photograph on his desk.

36
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:25,664
He comes off as a
really stern person,

37
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:26,748
and something about his voice

38
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,668
makes it sound like
he's always angry.

39
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,752
[gasps]

40
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:32,129
[TOHRU]
Is that why I'm here?

41
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,757
Is‐Is he going to scold me for
being hopelessly incompetent?

42
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:36,299
[MOMIJI]
Tohru?

43
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:36,925
[TOHRU yelps]

44
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:39,052
What's the matter?
Do you feel sick?

45
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:40,512
Harry is a doctor.

46
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,723
[TOHRU] Oh, no! I'm
absolutely fine, I swear!

47
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:45,559
'Kay. Then why don't we
go ahead and sit down?

48
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:53,567
[TOHRU] So, um. Are you
a doctor at a hospital?

49
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,944
Did you have to take time
off to meet with me here?

50
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:59,322
No. I don't treat anyone
outside the Soma clan.

51
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,074
I'm the family doctor.

52
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:04,077
Though half my job is
babysitting its head.

53
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:08,165
Constantly getting sick
is Akito's specialty.

54
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:10,834
[MOMIJI] Plus, all of the
Somas are super busy today,

55
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:13,128
so nobody will stop
by for an exam.

56
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:13,712
[TOHRU]
Huh?

57
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,672
They're getting ready
for New Year's!

58
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:17,632
It's a big event here for us,

59
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,009
so outside people will pitch in

60
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,385
to help with the
preparations, too,

61
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,220
and not just inside ones.

62
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,222
[TOHRU]
Outside? Inside?

63
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:24,973
Yep!

64
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:28,643
See, the members of the main
family are on the "inside."

65
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,437
Remember the tree‐lined road?

66
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,814
The one that leads
to the front gate?

67
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:35,609
We call the residents of that
area "outside" people.

68
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,736
I think there are
about <i>ein hundert</i>?

69
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:38,945
A hundred of them.

70
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,531
There are another 50
living on the inside.

71
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:44,075
And all 150 of us are Somas!

72
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,912
Wow. That's a really big family!

73
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,705
[MOMIJI] The only people
who can live "inside"

74
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:52,042
are zodiac members like us,
or people who know our secret.

75
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,002
Shii‐<i>chan</i> and Yuki
are gone now,

76
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:55,796
but they used to live here, too.

77
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,839
Kyo was outside, though.

78
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:59,674
I don't know how skilled
you are at math,

79
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,802
but that means even
within the Soma family,

80
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:05,263
a full two‐thirds aren't
aware of the zodiac secret.

81
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,265
So perhaps you can see
how outrageous it is

82
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,602
for a complete stranger
like you to know it.

83
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,854
Ordinarily, I would've
wiped your memory

84
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,731
as soon as you learned about it.

85
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:19,694
But Akito hasn't given me the
order to, for whatever reason.

86
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:23,907
Tell me, do you enjoy
living at Shigure's house?

87
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:25,742
Uh, yes. I do.

88
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:28,662
I recommend moving
out immediately.

89
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:32,332
Stay away from the
Somas from now on.

90
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:35,085
You seem to think our possessed
family is fascinating,

91
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,670
maybe even delightful.

92
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:37,838
But it's not.

93
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:41,299
We're monstrous.
Loathsome. Cursed.

94
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,135
So listen when I tell you:

95
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:48,390
Leave before you regret ever
associating with the Somas.

96
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:52,769
Make no mistake, Akito
is trying to use you.

97
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,437
[doorbell rings]

98
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,064
[HATORI]
Wait here for a moment.

99
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:03,947
[TOHRU] "Cursed"?
What did he mean by that?

100
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:05,740
[MOMIJI]
You should know.

101
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:10,537
Harry is almost entirely
blind in his left eye.

102
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:12,789
He used to have a girlfriend.

103
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:17,127
Her name was Kana.
She was really nice.

104
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:20,881
They were even
going to get married.

105
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,633
But... Akito got angry.

106
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,012
[MOMIJI]
So, so angry.

107
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,722
Said they weren't
allowed to get married,

108
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:32,893
then lashed out, and
injured Harry's eye.

109
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:36,730
But you know what?
Harry never blamed Akito.

110
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:39,441
As for Kana, she blamed herself.

111
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,860
She said it was her
fault he got hurt.

112
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:44,738
She felt so guilty,
she became depressed.

113
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:48,533
Like she'd never be happy again.

114
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:55,123
Finally, Harry decided to
erase Kana's memories.

115
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:59,044
He couldn't stand to watch
her fall apart anymore.

116
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,755
So, he took away all
the memories she had

117
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,798
of them being in love.

118
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:07,761
[MOMIJI]
Kana left the estate.

119
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,846
Harry cried when she went.

120
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:13,224
But even then,
he didn't blame Akito.

121
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,645
[TOHRU]
Why not?

122
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:20,315
[MOMIJI]
Because... that's the curse.

123
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:24,361
Harry doesn't want to see any
more people end up like Kana.

124
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:28,573
He doesn't want you to get hurt
by the curse like she did.

125
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:32,869
[TOHRU crying]

126
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:35,413
[MOMIJI]
Wait, are you crying?

127
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,958
Oh, no! Did I make you cry?

128
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,460
Tohru. I'm so sorry!

129
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:42,003
[TOHRU]
It's not that.

130
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:47,968
It's just... Hatori's so kind
to be worried about me.

131
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:52,639
Whatever happens,
I'm glad I met all of you.

132
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:58,728
Even if Hatori's right, and I'm
being used for some reason,

133
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:02,148
I can only feel grateful for it.

134
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,733
And I know I'll never regret

135
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:07,821
meeting Soma and
Kyo and Shigure.

136
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:12,617
If it weren't for them,
I wouldn't be who I am now.

137
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:13,910
And me, too?

138
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,453
[TOHRU]
Huh?

139
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,373
[MOMIJI]
Are you glad that you met me?

140
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,210
Of course I am.

141
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,506
[SHIGURE]
Don't look so glum, you two.

142
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:28,717
I promise we're not using Tohru.

143
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:29,759
‐‐[TOHRU] Shigure!
‐‐[MOMIJI] Shii‐<i>chan</i>!

144
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:32,303
Doc Hatori here can be
a bit melodramatic.

145
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,930
It's a character flaw.

146
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,223
[TOHRU]
What brought you here?

147
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:37,475
My gut! It told me
to come, Tohru!

148
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:41,021
It's a novelist thing.
I have a keen sixth sense.

149
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,230
Clearly a lie.

150
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:45,025
You only came to check on
the New Year's preparations.

151
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:48,069
[SHIGURE] Ugh. The common folk
are so quick to envy geniuses.

152
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:48,820
Tragic, really.

153
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:49,738
[HATORI]
Genius?

154
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,282
You'd never guess it,
but those two are best friends.

155
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,701
Honestly, with all
the worrying you do,

156
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,578
it's a wonder
you're not bald yet.

157
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:59,706
I keep telling you Akito
doesn't mean any harm to Tohru,

158
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:01,750
but you refuse to believe me.

159
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,085
And now you've gone
and scared the poor girl.

160
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:07,005
What if she actually moves out?

161
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,424
[TOHRU]
Please. It's okay, really.

162
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:12,719
Just knowing you were concerned
about me means a lot, thank you.

163
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:14,888
But I'm going to stay
where I am for now.

164
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,682
Very well. Be sure to
take this with you.

165
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:18,725
[TOHRU]
Hm?

166
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:21,936
[HATORI] It's the camera
from the culture festival.

167
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,730
Why give it to me?

168
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:26,983
Our deal. Have you
forgotten it already?

169
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,069
I told you that
if you came here,

170
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,279
I would surrender
the camera to you.

171
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:35,533
If you don't show up,
I trust you know what'll happen.

172
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,911
[TOHRU]
That's not what he said at all!

173
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,829
I guess Hatori and
Shigure are both

174
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:42,624
"my way or the highway"
types of people.

175
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:45,794
I forgot. I haven't
introduced you to Akito.

176
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,421
Um. It's okay, really.
I don't mind.

177
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:49,547
I was wondering, though,

178
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,175
you're a member of
the zodiac, too, right?

179
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:53,676
Which of the spirits are you?

180
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:54,844
[SHIGURE laughs]

181
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:56,596
Now that's an
excellent question!

182
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:58,098
And the answer's hilarious.

183
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,682
I'll call your publisher
and tell them

184
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,602
every embarrassing thing you've
done since you were four.

185
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:04,979
Right. Lips sealed.

186
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,232
[HATORI]
I apologize for today.

187
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,317
Huh?

188
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:13,154
All I did was make
you cry. I'm sorry.

189
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,203
[SHIGURE]
I'll stay for a bit.

190
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:23,248
I still need to sneak a peek
at the celebration set‐up.

191
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,875
And I've got a dance
rehearsal to get to.

192
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:26,459
[TOHRU]
Dance?

193
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:29,963
Yes, it's sort of like a ritual
we perform every New Year's.

194
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:34,634
Now, Hatori, you behave
yourself around young Tohru.

195
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,177
Let's go.

196
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:38,012
[TOHRU]
'Kay.

197
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,097
<i>Bis bald</i>!

198
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,849
I'll see you later!

199
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:58,158
So, is it true that you're best
friends? You and Shigure?

200
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,951
Us? Best friends?

201
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:03,329
Well, that's what Momiji said,
b‐but maybe he was wrong?

202
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,039
[HATORI] I'm stuck
with him, that's all.

203
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,374
[gasps]

204
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:12,338
[TOHRU] Maybe he doesn't
wanna talk about Shigure.

205
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,965
[HATORI]
Hey, watch your step.

206
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,300
Huh? Ah!

207
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,641
[gasps] Are you okay,
Hatori? I‐‐ Uh!

208
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:27,770
[TOHRU]
Ah!

209
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,272
What do I do?

210
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:30,231
Water!

211
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:32,609
Wait, hold on! Which kind
of water does he need?

212
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,528
Fresh water or salt water? Ah!

213
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,739
[HATORI]
This brings back memories.

214
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:42,285
Tohru Honda isn't the first
person to react this way.

215
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,787
It's nice to meet you.

216
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:47,332
I'm Kana Soma, and
I'll work very hard

217
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,459
to be a good assistant for you.

218
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,126
Right.

219
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:51,336
[KANA]
I've always found it strange

220
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,921
that we've never
spoken to each other

221
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,548
even though we're a
part of the same clan.

222
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,258
Hm. You may have
heard this before,

223
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,969
but you're quite the popular
guy on the outside.

224
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:01,346
Let's get to work, shall we?

225
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,057
[KANA]
It's snowing!

226
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,809
I thought we'd get snow.

227
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,812
Hey, I've got a
question for you.

228
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,899
What comes of snow
when it melts?

229
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:15,026
The answer to that
is obviously water.

230
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:15,818
[KANA mimics buzzer]

231
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,862
[KANA giggles]

232
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,950
The answer is spring comes.

233
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,577
Spring is my favorite season.

234
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:29,999
[HATORI] She was my spring.
My new season.

235
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:34,045
Somewhere along the line,
trapped in my dark cage,

236
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,380
I'd frozen.

237
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,173
I was snow.

238
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:42,095
But then Kana came into my life.
A fresh, bright spring.

239
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,602
[KANA giggling]

240
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:50,853
[HATORI]
I fell in love

241
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,106
like it was the only
logical thing to do.

242
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,984
[giggling]

243
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:08,371
[HATORI]
And then... she found out.

244
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:09,706
[KANA]
What do I do?

245
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:10,456
Water!

246
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,750
Wait, hold on! Which
kind does he need?

247
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,420
Fresh water or
salt water? Hatori!

248
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,926
For future reference,

249
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,845
putting a real seahorse
or seadragon

250
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,097
in the bath like
that would kill it.

251
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,098
[KANA chuckles]

252
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,808
Got it, sorry.

253
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,644
But this does answer
one question for me.

254
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:33,938
You've never held me
in your arms before,

255
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,524
and now I know why.

256
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:39,902
It makes sense. This
must be pretty scary, huh?

257
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:42,113
Of course you wouldn't
want people to know.

258
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:45,033
Of course you'd keep
them at a distance.

259
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:50,121
Especially someone you love.

260
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:53,082
But please, don't get scared.

261
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:55,418
Don't reject me for knowing.

262
00:13:57,003 --> 00:14:00,715
[KANA] I'm glad I met you.
That hasn't changed.

263
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:05,762
Loving you has made me so happy.

264
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,056
I want to be with you.

265
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,101
[HATORI]
I wept.

266
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:16,272
For the first time in my life,
I felt somehow forgiven.

267
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:19,817
Somehow saved.

268
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:24,405
Like a river of snow melted by
the first breath of spring.

269
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:27,700
The tears wouldn't stop flowing.

270
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:31,621
For almost two months,
life was like the best dream.

271
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:35,166
She smiled and said it was
as if I was condensing

272
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:40,505
a lifetime of happiness
into a handful of weeks.

273
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,674
But then we begged Akito
to allow us to marry,

274
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,844
and the dream came
to an abrupt end.

275
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:47,845
[gasps, yells]

276
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,806
You think I'll give him
to someone like you?

277
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,140
Akito! Wait, just calm down!

278
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:51,974
[HATORI]
Akito!

279
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,142
[AKITO]
You can't even lift the curse!

280
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:54,811
‐‐[HATORI] Akito, please!
‐‐[AKITO] You're not wanted!

281
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,854
[AKITO]
We don't need you!

282
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:00,316
‐‐Hatori!
‐‐You're the one to blame!

283
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:02,360
[AKITO] It's your fault
if Hatori goes blind,

284
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:03,736
do you hear me?

285
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:06,656
This is all your fault!
It's all your fault!

286
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:10,952
It's all your fault!
It's all your fault!

287
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:16,582
[HATORI]
She fell ill.

288
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,836
No matter what I
said or what I did,

289
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,422
the crying never stopped.

290
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:26,884
The curse. She grew
more and more sick.

291
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:30,888
Her heart was suffering.
Her mind, too.

292
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:37,311
[AKITO] Isn't this exactly
the type of situation

293
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,605
where your little memory trick
would come in handy?

294
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:42,650
You ought to wipe the
slate clean for her.

295
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:44,277
What's stopping you now?

296
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:47,697
You've never been shy before.

297
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,240
The poor girl's only suffering

298
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,784
because she remembers
her time with you.

299
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:54,454
Her love for you.

300
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:57,165
Don't you owe her
this much at least?

301
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:00,835
To save her from that agony?

302
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:02,587
What she really
wants, deep down,

303
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:06,007
is to be set free
from your love.

304
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,926
Give her that freedom.

305
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,845
Let her forget.

306
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:15,183
[KANA]
This wouldn't have happened

307
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:19,312
if only we'd never met.

308
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:22,023
[HATORI] Am I just
getting what I deserve?

309
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:26,360
Is this my punishment for
blindly following orders?

310
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,988
For stripping away
people's memories,

311
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:32,658
regardless of how
much pain it caused?

312
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:37,788
Even so, I never imagined I'd
have to erase with my own hands

313
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,333
the memories most
precious to me

314
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:44,170
from the mind most
precious to me.

315
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:47,507
[KANA]
I'm so sorry.

316
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:51,385
It's my fault.
I couldn't protect you.

317
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:56,349
I'm so sorry.

318
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,560
I'm sorry, Hatori.

319
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:12,240
[HATORI] I'm the one who
owes you an apology.

320
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:15,201
I'm the one who failed
to protect you.

321
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:21,582
[HATORI]
Thank you for everything, Kana.

322
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,668
It's all right now.

323
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:30,174
It's over. You don't
have to suffer anymore.

324
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,886
[KANA]
I'm glad I met you.

325
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:35,930
That hasn't changed.

326
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:42,812
[HATORI] God, please let her
meet someone better than me.

327
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:46,482
Someone who can give her
the happiness she deserves.

328
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:49,652
I'll do anything.

329
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:53,281
I'll be snow in a world
without spring.

330
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:56,617
Frozen until the day I die.

331
00:17:56,659 --> 00:18:00,329
Just please... Please.

332
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:03,541
[TOHRU]
Hatori. Hatori!

333
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,209
Can you hear me?

334
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:08,671
Are you okay? How do you feel?

335
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:09,589
I'm freezing.

336
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:14,719
Um, that's because under your
coat, y‐you're... kinda naked.

337
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,803
[HATORI]
So you saw?

338
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:17,597
Oh, no, I didn't look I promise!

339
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,223
[HATORI]
You saw my zodiac form?

340
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,767
[TOHRU]
Well, yeah.

341
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:22,685
Huh?

342
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:24,520
I don't think it's weird
or anything. It's great!

343
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:26,272
And of course, there's
the surprise factor!

344
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:28,608
I mean, who doesn't love
a good surprise?

345
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:31,652
Oh, your shoes! They're
probably back by the stairs.

346
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:33,696
I'll just go and get them.

347
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:41,037
[MAYUKO] So, you're finally
getting married, huh?

348
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,747
Congratulations, Kana.

349
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,332
Thanks, Mayuko.

350
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:47,335
[SOMA WOMAN A]
Well, what's the lucky man like?

351
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:50,463
[KANA] Huh. My heart always
feels calm when I'm with him.

352
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:53,549
His face isn't quite as
handsome as Hatori's, though.

353
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:55,593
[SOMA WOMAN A]
You're terrible! Don't say that.

354
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:58,346
Gimme a break, he was
the man of my dreams.

355
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,598
Even if he never felt the same.

356
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,059
I wish I'd gotten to tell him
"hi" while I was visiting.

357
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,269
[SOMA WOMAN A]
Easy! You've already got a man.

358
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,521
[KANA] And I'm madly in
love with him, so don't...

359
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:10,650
[HATORI]
Two years after I last saw her,

360
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:14,528
and she's smiling like
she did back then.

361
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:18,491
So, she found happiness.

362
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:22,411
I'm glad. So glad.

363
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:24,497
Congratulations.

364
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:27,041
I'm sorry,
congratulations for what?

365
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,834
[HATORI]
Nothing. Never mind.

366
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:29,794
[TOHRU gasps]

367
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,380
Do you see that? It's snowing!

368
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,341
No wonder you were
feeling so cold earlier.

369
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,179
[HATORI]
Yes.

370
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:43,099
Please, let her be happy.

371
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:47,937
I'll be the snow.
Frozen until the day I die.

372
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,022
Just please...

373
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:52,692
[KANA] What comes of
snow when it melts?

374
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,238
[TOHRU]
Hatori?

375
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,865
You look sad. Is
something the matter?

376
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:03,369
I'm fine.

377
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:09,041
Tell me, what do you suppose
comes of snow when it melts?

378
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,377
Huh, let me think for a second.

379
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:12,920
[TOHRU gasps]

380
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:15,506
When snow melts, spring comes!

381
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:20,136
No matter how cold it is now,
spring will come again.

382
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:24,140
It never fails.
Pretty mysterious, huh?

383
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,269
Yes.

384
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,854
It is.

385
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:35,443
[TOHRU] Thanks for walking me
to the gate. I appreciate it.

386
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,903
[HATORI]
Sorry about the incident.

387
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:40,197
[SHIGURE]
You're still here? Slowpokes.

388
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,490
[TOHRU]
Shigure!

389
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:42,783
[SHIGURE]
Now, doctor,

390
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:45,286
you haven't been behaving
improperly, have you?

391
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,329
No! He hasn't done anything!

392
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,290
See you later.

393
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,584
Thank you for
inviting me to visit!

394
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,086
Poor Tohru.

395
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:56,672
It was quite rude of him to
summon you here like that.

396
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:59,008
But he's not as much
of a jerk as he seems.

397
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:02,136
[TOHRU] Not at all!
He was very kind to me.

398
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:03,637
Well, let's get home.

399
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,849
All this New Year's prep
has me positively famished.

400
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,741
[SHIGURE] Speaking of,
what are we having for dinner?

401
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:24,742
[TOHRU]
Shigure.

402
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:25,826
[SHIGURE]
Hm?

403
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:32,917
Will you tell me...
about the curse?

404
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,961
Sorry, it's just...

405
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:39,673
It just seems like I should
be doing something to help.

406
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:44,595
And you are, just by
being yourself.

407
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:49,016
But for now, I don't think I
should tell you anything more.

408
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,518
I'm sorry.

409
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,813
[TOHRU]
After today,

410
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:56,816
I feel like I understand
more about the Somas,

411
00:21:56,857 --> 00:22:00,694
and also like I don't
understand anything.

412
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:03,823
It's strange feeling
both things at once.

413
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:06,909
I still haven't
officially met Akito.

414
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:09,328
I wonder if I will someday.

415
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,915
[SHIGURE]
I guess it's true what they say.

416
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:16,126
A <i>kotatsu</i> can put even the
fiercest demons to sleep.

417
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,628
[TOHRU chuckles]

418
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,295
[SHIGURE]
All right...

419
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:21,507
[TOHRU] Anyway, whatever
I know or don't know,

420
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:24,510
nothing changes how much
I wanna cherish this.

421
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:27,763
And I will. Today, tomorrow...

422
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:31,809
I'll cherish each and every
moment I spend in this house.

423
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,654
[TOHRU]
"See you when you get back."
