Of course. Sorry.

I‐I'm sure you'll handle it.

I ended up back here again.

That must be her dad.

They're so disgusting.

Ah, well. They'll be fine.

[NEWSCASTER A] It's such
a shame that the clouds

never went away last week.

[NEWSCASTER B]
Tell me about it.

47
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,000
The humidity was so bad

00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,585
that my clothes wouldn't even
dry completely on the line...

...sunny skies and no rain.

That's right!

It's finally going to feel like
spring is in full bloom.

Time to break out those
warm‐weather clothes.

55
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,514
[NEWSCASTER A]
I can't wait.

56
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:25,974
I'm not usually one
for hot weather,

57
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,809
but I just bought the
most adorable sandals

00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,270
I've been dying to wear out.

Uo‐<i>chan</i>! I mean, Uotani.

60
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,734
I'd be honored if you'd join
us for dinner tonight.

[gasps]

62
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,198
[TOHRU]
Is everything okay?

63
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:45,243
Of course I'm uncomfortable.

64
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,205
The home you guys have is...

65
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:52,501
It's so foreign to me.
I never had this.

66
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,086
It feels wrong.

67
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,381
I know I don't belong,
so I'm basically an outcast,

68
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:01,259
which only makes me
more uncomfortable.

69
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:05,889
Thing is, even if I did
have something like this,

70
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:08,433
I'd still yell at my dad
and tell him to go to hell

71
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:11,353
like I didn't give a damn.

72
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:14,022
If my old man had dinner
waiting for me after school,

73
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:15,607
I just wouldn't go home.

74
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,692
Or I would, but I'd
refuse to eat it,

00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,153
and tell him it
smelled like crap.

76
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:21,321
I know that's the truth,

77
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:25,116
even if it's never
happened to me before.

78

No matter what my
home life is like,

I'll always be the
same delinquent.

00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:34,584
Either way, I'll still be this.

81
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:40,131
[UOTANI] So what are these
feelings? Why am I jealous?

82
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,093
Why do I still wish
this was my life?

83

I'm an idiot.

Houses full of light...

92

The home you go back to
after a day with friends...

Where others are
waiting for you.

Kind people who welcome
you home... with a smile.

lonely this entire time?

And it feels nice.

Maybe I have been all my life.

99

Maybe this whole time,
I've been looking for something.

[UOTANI] Trivial moments...
but precious ones nonetheless.

I've been missing?

you and her mom?

Oh, yeah, right.

109

out for a while, didn't I?

Hmm...

Because what I did next...

used to be just like those kids.

00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,811
Y'think so?

159
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:24,230
Then why do adults act like
they're so much better than us?

160
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,190
[KYOKO gasps]

161
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,233
[KYOKO]
My sincerest apologies!

162
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,777
[chuckles]

163
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:31,821
[UOTANI]
From then on,

164
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:34,449
I went to Tohru's house
on the regular.

165
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:46,419
[UOTANI] Kyoko always welcomed
me with a warm smile.

166
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,963
I was grateful.

167
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,131
She listened to me,

168
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:52,801
and carefully considered
my problems.

169
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,053
Even though they were childish.

170
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:59,307
[KYOKO] All right!
These peas are ready to go!

171
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,267
[TOHRU]
I appreciate your hard work.

172
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:04,562
Hey. Why do you always
talk so politely?

173
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,313
[KYOKO sighs]

174
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:06,940
[KYOKO]
It's Katsuya's fault.

175
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,567
Ah, Katsuya is
Tohru's dad's name.

176
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:13,154
He always spoke like that, and
she just kind of picked it up.

177
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:14,906
Thank you so much for your help.

178
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,408
But I don't mind it.
It's adorable.

179
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,830
You really are a doting
parent. I guess it's cute.

180
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:25,166
[UOTANI] Before I knew it,
I was comfortable in their home.

181
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:29,587
I had no one to blame for
that but Tohru and Kyoko.

182
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,631
Anyway, that's how
I started spending

183
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,591
so much time with them.

184
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,261
I became friends with Tohru.

185
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,888
And even started going
to school all the time.

186
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:42,225
Because if I went to school,
I got to hang out with her.

187
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:43,768
[TOHRU]
The Battle of Sekigahara.

188
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,062
Okay. What about
the third shogun?

189
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:47,939
[TOHRU]
Iemitsu Tokugawa.

190
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,650
Right. The year 1853.

191
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:52,026
[TOHRU]
Hmm...

192
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,571
[UOTANI]
First hint: A foreigner.

193
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:55,446
[TOHRU]
Um...

194
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,365
[UOTANI]
Second hint: A boat.

195
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,742
Ah‐ha! The arrival of Mr. Perry!

196
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:02,829
Bingo! But you can
drop the "Mr."

197
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:05,373
[TOHRU]
Oops. Force of habit.

198
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:06,666
[UOTANI]
Studying was kind of fun

199
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,668
once I understood how it worked.

200
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,087
And Tohru was easy
to get along with.

201
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:13,590
Probably because she was
always standing beside me,

202
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,508
from the beginning.

203
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,969
Looking back on it,
she was there for me,

204
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,096
even when I didn't
know I needed her.

205
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,639
[UOTANI]
Like I could pass that up.

206
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:22,932
Miss Uotani.

207
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:23,850
[UOTANI]
Huh?

208
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:26,019
[TEACHER A] What do you think
you're doing bothering her?

209
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,980
Hey. Hold on.
We were only talking.

210
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,815
[TEACHER A]
Miss Honda, are you okay?

211
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,275
Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

212
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:33,818
Uh.

213
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,321
[UOTANI] Thing is,
to the people around us,

214
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:39,824
we apparently didn't look like
we should've been friends.

215
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:42,035
Which I can understand.

216
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,287
[DELINQUENT A]
Haven't seen Uotani in a while.

217
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:45,997
Heard anything, Akimoto?

218
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,123
[AKIMOTO]
No.

219
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:48,625
[DELINQUENT B]
Word is she become some kinda

220
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,251
straight‐laced star
student lately.

221
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:53,379
[DELINQUENT A] Oh, hell no, that
is not happening. Go get her.

222
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:56,007
Yeah, we should teach
her a real lesson.

223
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,971
[CLASSMATE A]
Hey, so I had a question.

224
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:02,555
Yes?

225
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:06,059
You and Uotani are close,
right? Like, best friends?

226
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,143
[TORHU gasps]

227
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:10,521
Well, I... It would be an honor
to be her best friend,

228
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,607
so I hope maybe
one day I will be.

229
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:13,775
[TOHRU gasps]

230
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:16,903
[TOHRU] But what if Uo‐<i>chan</i>
doesn't feel that way?

231
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:17,946
Sorry.

232
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:18,988
Huh?

233
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,157
[CLASSMATE B]
No way. They can't be friends.

234
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:24,035
They're just too different.
It doesn't make any sense.

235
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:24,994
[CLASSMATE C]
Pretty sure our teachers

236
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:27,205
have been keeping an eye
on both of 'em, too.

237
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,039
Who knows?

238
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,749
Maybe Honda's different
outside of school

239
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,918
and does horrible
stuff in secret.

240
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,836
[CLASSMATE B] I mean, if she's
hanging out with Uotani,

241
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,213
I bet you're right.

242
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,340
[UOTANI]
How can I go in there?

243
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,759
I don't care if anyone
talks about me,

244
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:44,222
but I don't want them spreading
any rumors about Tohru.

245
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:47,392
Maybe it'd be better for her
if I wasn't around at all.

246
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:52,772
If I distanced myself...
she might be happier.

247
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:55,817
[CLASSMATE A] Hey. You made
too many of those, Honda.

248
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,987
[TOHRU]
Nope! This is for Uo‐<i>chan</i>.

249
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,251
[DELINQUENT A]
Huh?!

250
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,211
You wanna leave the gang?

251
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:17,130
Musta lost your damn mind.

252
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,756
Do you think you can
just say you're done

253
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,341
and we'll forget about ya?

254
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:23,636
If you wanna quit, you gotta
take the punishment.

255
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:24,804
[UOTANI]
I know.

256
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:26,597
[DELINQUENT B] Then I don't
wanna hear any complaining!

257
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,598
[DELINQUENT A]
Circle up on her.

258
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,100
[DELINQUENTS shouting]

259
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:30,977
[UOTANI]
This is terrifying.

260
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,771
I wanna run... so badly.

261
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:37,734
But I can't. Because...

262
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,944
[DELINQUENT A]
First one's on me.

263
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:44,699
Uh‐uh. The night
is just beginning.

264
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:49,746
[DELINQUENTS shouting]

265
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:53,666
[UOTANI]
I wanted to change my life.

266
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:57,754
It was the first time
I'd ever felt that way.

267
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:00,840
I didn't wanna live
like that anymore.

268
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:02,633
I would be different.

269
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,721
[UOTANI]
I had to because of her.

270
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,139
How's that feel?!

271
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:11,309
[DELINQUENTS shouting]

272
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,102
[DELINQUENT A]
Come on, get up.

273
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:14,771
How long you gonna lay there?

274
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,272
[KYOKO]
I think she's had enough.

275
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:17,690
[DELINQUENTS]
Huh?

276
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,486
[DELINQUENT B]
Who's that?!

277
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:28,951
Kyoko? I...

278
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:42,965
You awake?

279
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:43,549
[UOTANI]
Kyo‐‐

280
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:47,553
Easy now, or we'll both fall.
Plus, your leg's hurt.

281
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:55,895
Some older girl from your gang
dropped by the house tonight.

282
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:58,523
The one with a mole on her chin.

283
00:14:58,564 --> 00:14:59,732
She knew what was
going to happen

284
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:01,859
and that she couldn't
stop it herself,

285
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,821
so she asked for my help.

286
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,989
[UOTANI]
Akimoto.

287
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,534
It's just that... I like her.

288
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,536
You know how it is.

289
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,747
If she wants to go straight,
then she should.

290
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:16,958
She said leaving the gang

291
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,669
would be the best
thing for you, so...

292
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,131
[UOTANI]
Senpai.

293
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,632
But anyway, I'm sure
that quitting

294
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:26,008
took a whole lotta guts.

295
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,635
You did good.

296
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,262
Don't say that.

297
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:32,014
It just caused trouble.
Even for you.

298
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,475
Oh, no. It was nothing.

299
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:37,270
All I did was shoo a few kids
on back to their houses.

300
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,522
I wouldn't call that hard.

301
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,902
[KYOKO]
You know, this wasn't so bad.

302
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:48,239
You had someone kind in the
gang looking out for you.

303
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:52,076
Many people have gone through
a lot worse trying to get out.

304
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,871
You really are a lucky one.

305
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:57,832
[UOTANI crying]

306
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,584
I'm stupid.

307
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:04,464
[UOTANI] I don't learn
anything till I get hurt.

308
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:07,049
I'm such an idiot.

309
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:10,887
One thing I've discovered
is that sometimes

310
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,263
you can't understand
your feelings

311
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:15,558
until you make trouble...
and get hurt.

312
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:24,025
Sometimes we don't
know how we feel...

313
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,860
...until we're at our worst.

314
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:28,029
Then it all becomes clear.

315
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:33,826
[KYOKO] You can rebel
against what's pure,

316
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:37,538
but then, when you
find yourself filthy,

317
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:41,250
you start to long for the very
thing you turned away from.

318
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:45,171
You have to know
gentleness to feel pain.

319
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:49,258
Just as you only notice the
darkness if you have the sun.

320
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,886
You can't underestimate either.

321
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:54,847
'Cause everything
has its purpose.

322
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:57,517
So, even if you
screw up sometimes,

323
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:00,394
it's never for nothing.

324
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,689
As long as you make sure
you recognize that,

325
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:08,069
those mistakes will nourish you,
and help you grow even stronger.

326
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,490
'Least, that's my theory.

327
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,786
Listen, Kyoko. I just‐‐

328
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:22,750
Your daughter... I wanna
be Tohru's best friend!

329
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:27,588
I want her to be proud
to stand beside me.

330
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:31,884
That's the reason
I quit. I had to.

331
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:38,182
[UOTANI] I was determined
to make myself better for her.

332
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:41,769
Even if it meant leaving
my old life behind.

333
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:47,149
[KYOKO]
Hmm.

334
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,986
[UOTANI] It's a little
embarrassing to think about

335
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:53,114
how much I bawled as she
carried me back to her house,

336
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:56,200
as if she was giving me
a piggy‐back ride.

337
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,663
[UOTANI]
But it wasn't for nothing.

338
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:06,294
[UOTANI] For a while after that,
people picked fights with me,

339
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,713
but I came out of things okay.

340
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:12,091
It's really amazing
to not be alone.

341
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:16,804
[UOTANI] Unfortunately,
I never saw Akimoto again.

342
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:19,974
I heard around town
that she moved far away.

343
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:23,102
[UOTANI]
School gradually grew on me.

344
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:27,023
I started eighth grade,
then later, met Hanajima.

345
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,902
[UOTANI] Kyoko always laughed
when we were around.

346
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,780
She really liked us.

347
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:39,285
But then, one day all
of that changed...

348
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,123
[UOTANI] I couldn't believe
the apartment window

349
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:45,875
had gone dark.

350
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,253
[UOTANI]
I missed her.

351
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:53,341
[UOTANI]
She saved a random delinquent.

352
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:57,678
Someone she didn't have
any obligation to.

353
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,556
Kyoko was honest and warm.

354
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:03,809
At heart, a big softy.

355
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,561
I loved her.

356
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,231
[TOHRU]
Hey!

357
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,025
Hey, Uo‐<i>chan</i>?

358
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,985
Huh? Yeah? What's up?

359
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:14,737
Well, things are...

360
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:16,989
...getting a little out
of hand back here.

361
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:18,532
It's kinda scary.

362
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:19,367
Ugh.

363
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:23,037
Hanajima, take it easy on 'em,
they're just dumb kids.

364
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,288
I'm well aware.

365
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,874
I'm being as gentle as
possible. They're fine.

366
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,501
Don't mess with us, loser!

367
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,252
You're gonna regret
underestimating us

368
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:31,212
this whole time!

369
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,546
[UOTANI]
Aren't you done talking?

370
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:35,925
You shut up!
I'll send you flying!

371
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:38,260
[ISHIHARA]
My arms don't reach!

372
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:39,762
Come on! Stretch!
Let her have it!

373
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:41,806
If the kid was smart,
she'd of aimed low.

374
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,224
She's got a lot to learn.

375
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,768
I just hope this
is over with soon.

376
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:50,356
[UOTANI] It's kind of a blessing
to be underestimated sometimes.

377
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:52,400
If you wanna show off
how tough you are,

378
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:55,277
there are plenty of
other ways to do that.

379
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:58,197
Stop acting out like this
while you still can,

380
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:01,492
before something
serious happens.

381
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,786
If you want someone
to scold you,

382
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:06,205
I'm happy to do that any time.

383
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:10,626
[UOTANI]
All right. Let's head back.

384
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:12,002
[KYO]
Finally.

385
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,505
[TOHRU] I'm glad everything
turned out okay.

386
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,508
Hey, so are you good?

387
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,970
[TAKEMURA] What are you doing?
We gotta go after 'em.

388
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,680
I'm not worthy.

389
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,056
[ITO, TAKEMURA]
What'd you say?

390
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:25,683
[TOHRU]
We should be getting home.

391
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:26,892
The sun's going down.

392
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:27,935
[UOTANI]
Sounds good.

393
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:30,396
And thank you for such
a wonderful time.

394
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:33,315
It was a blast. Really.

395
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,526
See you at school
in the morning.

396
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,865
[UOTANI]
Kyoko isn't around anymore.

397
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:45,286
However, she left important
things for me here.

398
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:49,290
[UOTANI]
Her words, her feelings...

399
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:53,169
...and best of all, Tohru.

400
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,962
These things nourish me.

401
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:58,424
And because of them,
I've been able to grow.

402
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:11,187
[UOTANI humming]

403
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,563
‐‐[can pops]
‐‐‐[UOTANI] Hm?

404
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,482
Drop it, right now!

405
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:17,526
Your doc said to start
drinking less, old man.

406
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:18,736
Whoops. You caught me.

407
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:21,280
Yeah, yeah, real cute.
Put the can down.

408
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:23,449
And back off the salt!

409
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:25,701
Dummy.

410
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:28,204
You're hopeless, Pops.

411
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,092
[ITO]
Sorry to keep you waiting.

412
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:07,469
[TAKEMURA]
Yo. Wait.

413
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,555
Really? What are you wearing?

414
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:11,599
Ha. Like it?

415
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,310
Made it myself.

416
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:17,313
[TAKEMURA] Ugh. You care way
too much about how you look.

417
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:20,774
Stop trying to copy Uotani.
We're totally different.

418
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:24,695
Well. Yeah. I guess
that's probably true.

419
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,572
[TAKEMURA]
Huh?

420
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:28,657
[ITO] If you want to show
off how tough you are,

421
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:31,285
there are plenty of
other ways to do that.

422
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:34,747
So stop acting out like
this while you still can,

423
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:37,958
before something super
serious happens.

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,960
If you want someone
to scold you,

425
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:41,587
I'm happy to do that any time.

428
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:48,177
[TAKEMURA] Who do you think you
are stealing Uotani's lines?

[ITO growls]

Hey! You guys!
