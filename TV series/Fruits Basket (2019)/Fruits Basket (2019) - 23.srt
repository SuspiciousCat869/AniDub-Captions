Those of you with failing

That sucks!

00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:24,775
I don't wanna hear it!

7
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,193
You should be grateful
to your teachers

8
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:27,569
for this second chance.

00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:29,988
They're all giving up their
weekends to help you.

Tell 'em!

You don't wanna do make‐ups,

then don't fail in
the first place.

00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,496
But I'm sure you passed
everything, Tohru, right?

00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:20,599
[UOTANI]
Tohru? You don't look so good.

16
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:24,394
Well, let's hear it.
Did you fail?

17
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,063
How many?

18
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:30,484
Uh. Okay, that's
not too bad, then.

19

One subject's nothin'
to stress out over.

[HANAJIMA]
Indeed, take heart.

21
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:38,116
And if it helps, you scored
wonderfully compared to me.

22
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,493
I failed them all.

23
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:42,746
If anyone is gonna be
depressed, it oughta be you.

24

You haven't failed any exams
before now, have you?

25
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,835
No tutoring sessions with
the prince this time around?

26
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:52,214
Actually, Yuki did
help me study.

Please forgive me!

[TOHRU]
I'm such a disgrace.

33
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:08,855
Yuki took time away from his
own studies to tutor me

34
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,399
and I still failed.

35

What a terrible way
to repay his kindness!

36
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:16,196
I'm too ashamed to look at him.

37
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:19,199
And now my head's starting
to hurt for some reason.

Hey, the world
isn't ending here.

39
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:23,745
Besides, the make‐ups
have easier questions

40
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:25,539
than the regular tests.

41

[YUKI]
Don't worry.

42
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,418
You shouldn't let it
get to you too much.

You'll be okay.
Everybody has bad days.

pass the make‐up test

46

worry about yourself.

it, the more horrible I feel.

What's my problem?

00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,373
I promised Mom I would
graduate high school.

How can I keep that promise
if I start failing tests?

00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,380
I'm feeling a little dizzy.

I can't let this happen again.

[SHIGURE]
Yep, a bit of a fever.

Well, yeah, that's
pretty obvious.

Go on, get to bed already.

You freak out when
other people get colds,

so don't act like it's
no big deal when you do.

this for Tohru?

make up the bad grade

about Yuki, anyway?

there... I just...

...get thrown off.

162
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:36,159
[KYO] So I don't mind
cookin' a meal or two

163
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,745
if it'll bring your smile back.

164
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,246
Okay?

165
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,707
Don't worry about
that part, at least.

166
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,336
[TOHRU]
I get it now.

167
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,255
So that's what he's doing.

168
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:51,382
Well, hurry up and eat it!

I didn't see it at first,

00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,975
but this is his way
of cheering me up.

173
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,399
It really is good.

174
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:11,194
[KYO]
Yeah, right. No, it isn't.

That's just creepy.

[MOMIJI]
Are you sure, Harry?

180
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,768
You can't give Tohru a
shot if it'll hurt her!

181
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:45,603
I can barely feel it.

182
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:47,522
It's just a little
sting, I promise.

183
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:50,275
Shii‐ <i>chan</i> said his shot
was super painful.

184
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,694
And that it took a long
time to get it right!

185

Harry kept poking him
over and over again.

when you're as young as Kisa,

[TOHRU]
Hm?

219
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,153
[YUKI] I put together
some sample problems

[TOHRU] Of course I wanna

have to worry anymore.

238
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:07,412
[TOHRU] It's probably because
I got so much help from you!

239
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:10,039
And Hana‐ <i>chan</i> passed
this time around as well.

240
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,583
Huh. I guess she was right.

The make‐up test was
easier, as assumed.

come down pretty hard.

[YUKI] The report earlier said
it should let up a little

in the afternoon.

Oh, good. Maybe the weather
will be kind to us.

It would be so nice
if the summer sun

Then, um...

284
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,312
This might be a bold to ask,
and you can say no,

285
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:57,688
but if you were
in your Cat form,

you the rest of the way.

never gonna open up again.

00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:14,640
[KYO]
Never mind.

317
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:18,102
[KYO]
Well? Spit it out.

318
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:19,937
Why'd you even come here today?

319
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:22,732
No reason, I guess.
I just stopped by.

320
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,193
Ugh. Don't do that again.

321
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:26,569
Huh? Why not?

322
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,821
Can't I come by because
I want to see you?

323
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:31,407
[KYO] No, 'cause I
don't wanna see you.

324
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,618
[KAGURA]
You're so mean, Kyo.

325
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,745
How can you say that?

326
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,206
Especially when...

327
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:40,166
You okay?

328
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,418
When I have so
much love for you?!

329
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:43,836
[KYO]
Exactly!

330
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,421
When are you gonna realize
that's one of the reasons

331
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,340
I don't want you here?!

332
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:50,968
[KAGURA giggles]

333
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:53,930
I'll kill you.

334
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,474
Kagura, why don't I
lend you this feline?

335
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,559
Maybe you two
could go on a date.

336
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:00,895
Ah! Yes, that's a great idea.

337
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,105
[KYO] What?! I'm not
yours to lend out.

338
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,149
[YUKI] He just doesn't want
the house to get wrecked.

339
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:08,778
No way, I refuse.
What would we even do?

340
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,072
Well... here's a thought.

341
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,532
Tohru, dear.

342
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:15,493
Why don't you give them your
shopping list for dinner?

343
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:18,246
That's perfect!
We can go for you!

344
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:19,247
I'm staying.

345
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,415
Oh. Okay.

346
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:24,835
Um. Here. If you're
sure you don't mind.

347
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:25,753
[KAGURA]
Mh‐hm!

348
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,672
I still say no.

349
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:31,717
[KAGURA]
Let's go! It's a date!

350
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:34,512
Ah. The house is safe. For now.

351
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:35,346
[TOHRU]
Huh?

352
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,806
[YUKI]
I knew it.

353
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,849
Giving them some time alone
will be good for everyone.

354
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:41,310
It'll make Kagura
happy, at least.

355
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:44,897
She should really tone it
down a little. Or a lot.

356
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:48,901
[TOHRU] Actually, I wonder
if she's already trying to.

357
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:50,319
Think about it.

358
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,780
I bet she wants to see
him every single day,

359
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,407
but she stays away.

360
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,950
Holds back.

361
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:00,830
[TOHRU] Somehow, it seems
like she's purposefully

362
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,457
trying to distance
herself a little.

363
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:07,503
[TOHRU] I wonder what
the reason could be.

364
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,255
[SHIGURE]
What a mess.

365
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:12,925
I'll withdraw money for the
damages from Kyo's bank account.

366
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,510
And Kagura's, too.

367
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:17,263
[TOHRU] Wow. I didn't know
Kyo had a bank account.

368
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,306
[SHIGURE]
Huh?

369
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:23,477
Oh. Mh‐hm. Yuki here
has one, too.

370
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:26,981
He gets money from the family
deposited in there every month.

371
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:29,400
I had no idea you...

372
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:33,946
[TOHRU]
I still don't know very much

373
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:37,908
about their situations
or family affairs.

374
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:39,243
[SHIGURE]
If you're both free,

375
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:41,537
maybe you should go on
a little date as well.

376
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:44,790
Uh. Oh, no, that's
okay. I should...

377
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,667
[YUKI]
I'd like that.

378
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:50,504
If you're okay with
the usual secret base.

379
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:55,051
[TOHRU] However, I'll find
out more about them in time.

380
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,844
Okay!

381
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,554
[TOHRU] And I wanna be
a person who can accept

382
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:02,933
whoever they are deep
inside without question.

383
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:13,694
Let's see. Eggs, milk,
fermented soy beans.

384
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:17,573
Oh! She put fish on here,
too, Kyo! Your favorite.

385
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,411
[KAGURA]
Hey, I was wondering.

386
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,704
[KYO]
Hm?

387
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:26,415
She doesn't know about
you yet, does she?

388
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,084
[KYO gasps]

389
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,962
So, then... do you plan
on hiding it forever?

390
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:33,130
You shut up!

391
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:35,174
It's none of your business
what I tell her!

392
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:38,511
[CUSTOMERS whispering]

393
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,513
Darling...

394
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,598
I can't believe you'd
yell at a girl in public.

395
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:43,933
You're the worst. So rude!

396
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,643
Ow! That really hurts!

397
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:48,187
[KAGURA] I swear, you can
be so embarrassing.

398
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,189
Come on, let's shop.

399
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:53,567
[KYO]
I don't get it.

400
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:59,448
Why are you so obsessed
with me? It's not normal.

401
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:02,451
Any sane person would
try to avoid me.

402
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,830
Or at least... keep me
at arm's length.

403
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,039
[gasps]

404
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:14,255
[KAGURA] You say that
because you don't know.

405
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:19,635
[KAGURA]
That day... when it happened...

406
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,470
What I felt...

407
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,394
Know what?

408
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:32,189
[KAGURA]
If I told you, you'd cry, so...

409
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:33,691
No can do.

410
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:36,527
‐‐[KYO] Huh?
‐‐Anyway, we should hurry up.

411
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,864
‐‐What? Just tell me.
‐‐[KAGURA giggles]

412
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:43,492
[KAGURA] Aw. Looks like
it might rain again.

413
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:46,287
[KYO] I don't think I'm
gonna get it out of her.

414
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,997
Let's hold hands
walking back.

415
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,457
No freakin' way.

416
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:53,043
But why not? We used to
all the time, remember?

417
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:56,380
[KYO] Yeah, when we were
three or four years old.

418
00:20:56,464 --> 00:21:00,509
But, Kyo... why do you hate me?

419
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:01,510
[KAGURA crying]

420
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:04,722
[KYO]
Ugh. Jeez. Fine!

421
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:08,517
You wanna hold hands, then here.

422
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:09,810
Thanks!

423
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,188
But only halfway there.

424
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,397
Okay!

425
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:18,360
[KYO] Any sane person
would try to avoid me,

426
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,613
or at least keep me
at arm's length.

427
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,948
[KAGURA]
Don't you realize?

428
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:27,995
Kyo... you're the one
who distanced yourself.

429
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:33,793
[BOTH laughing]

430
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:39,215
It's starting to sprinkle again.

431
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,384
I wonder if Kyo and
Kagura are almost back.

432
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:43,552
[YUKI]
No need to worry.

433
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:46,263
Kagura can carry him
if he can't make it.

434
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:49,141
[gasps]

435
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:52,561
Oops! I'm sorry, I‐‐
Is something wrong?

436
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,361
I didn't know he was back.

437
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,112
Oh, so, you know him then?

438
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:03,864
[KYO]
That is enough!

439
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:06,283
We already held hands
the whole way here.

440
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:09,203
You know how I hate it
whenever people get clingy.

441
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,664
Of course I do,
but that's no fun!

442
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:12,832
[KAZUMA]
Kyo.

443
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:19,672
[KAZUMA]
You look well.

444
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:22,466
Kyo.

445
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:27,555
[KYO]
Master.

446
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:06,528
[TOHRU]
"Let's go home."
