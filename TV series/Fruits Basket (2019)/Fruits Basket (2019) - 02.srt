Hello! Package delivery!

00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:22,648
[TOHRU]
They're...

4
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,900
They're all animals!

00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:27,486
Yeah. Those are some
cute pets you got there.

please sign here.

Aren't you a smart

00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:39,081
Thanks a lot, ma'am.
Have a good day!

[KYO]
Ugh!

12
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:44,044
We could've covered if you
jerks hadn't transformed, too!

13
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:46,713
[YUKI] You're the one who
screwed up first, stupid Cat.

[SHIGURE sighs]

19
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:52,469
[SHIGURE]
We can either tell her the truth

20
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:54,972
or make up a story she
won't believe anyway.

21
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:57,182
As you can see, I'm the Dog,

22
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:58,350
Yuki is the Rat,

23
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:00,561
and Kyo Soma over
here is the Cat.

24
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:04,439
We're all possessed
by animal spirits.

25
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:07,067
Ten others in the Soma family
are similarly possessed

26
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:09,152
by the different
zodiac animals.

27
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:13,031
It's been this way
for generations.

28
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,408
Unfortunately,
it doesn't give us

29
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:17,160
any especially cool
powers to speak of.

30
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,829
Pretty much all we
can do is communicate

31
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,372
with our respective animals,

32
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:22,791
and we transform when
our bodies are weakened

33
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:25,419
or when hugged by someone
of the opposite sex.

34
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,590
We automatically turn
human again after a while.

35
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:32,009
Completely naked, I'm afraid.

36
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:07,062
[SHIGURE]
Sorry about that.

37
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:09,439
I know it must've come
as quite a shock to you.

38
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:11,817
Now, then, are you
feeling a bit calmer?

39
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,778
I think so, but it's kind
of a lot to take in.

[gasps]

41

[TOHRU]
Of course!

42
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,616
That must be why Soma
shoved away that girl

43
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:21,326
who tried to hug him.

44
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:24,413
I have to say, that was a
pretty pathetic showing, Kyo.

45
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,790
I mean, you are a
trained martial artist.

46
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:29,418
Shouldn't it be a little harder
for a girl to sneak up on you?

47
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,337
You really have eyes for no
one but Yuki, don't you?

48
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,755
Don't make it sound like that!

49
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:35,090
It's not my fault!

50
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:37,676
You're the ones who let
a girl into this house!

51
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,302
Why is she even here?!

52
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,721
Calm yourself.

53
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,389
You have absolutely no say

54
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:44,808
in who we allow to
come in the house.

55
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:45,976

Huh? I'm bleeding?

on that immediately.

I knew you were a moron,

65
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:04,411
but I didn't think
you were this stupid.

Out of respect for the
sheer depth of your idiocy,

I'll do you a favor
and fight you for real.

So... please try
not to bore me.

Oh, this is normal.

72
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:23,764
Get them in a room together
and they're bound to go off.

00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,932
You know, like
fire and gasoline.

74

Uh, okay, but shouldn't
we try to stop them?

00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:29,519
Let them spar.

they'll be done soon.

Just as I feared.

Yes, I'm sure he'll be fine.
There, you see?

[TOHRU] I never imagined that
the boy known as "the prince"

would be so tough.

Oh my gosh, I have to hurry
or I'll be late to class!

00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,188
I'm sorry for running
off like this,

95
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,898
but it's important to me
to go to school every day,

96
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,191
I hope you understand.

your late mother.

Don't apologize.

00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:20,821
Though, I should let you know,

100
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:23,782
I will have to report that you
witnessed our transformation

101
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:26,117
to Akito, the family head.

102
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,661
"Family head"?

103
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,371
Wow, that sounds important.

Of course.

107
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,088
[YUKI] That explains
why you were so quick

108

to tell our secret.

[SHIGURE]
Hm?

110
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,009
She'll have her
memories altered.

111
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:46,054
Like those others did before.

112
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:48,223
No, this is much different.

113
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:50,183
Back then, there were
so many people involved

114
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:52,769
that we didn't have a choice.

115
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,771
I should get going, too.

116
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:58,650
Hey, stupid Cat, you'd better
fix the roof in her room.

117
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:02,153
Kyo, look after
the place, will you?

118
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,072
Don't you dare think
about running off again

119

while I'm gone either.

It's not like you to be late.
You oversleep?

124
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,129
Huh? Oh. That's right.

125
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,715
[KINOSHITA] So you admit
you're super lazy.

126
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,843
You should've stayed at home
and gotten more beauty rest.

[BOTH yelp]

128
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:31,641
[UOTANI] The prince was late,
too, so they're extra on edge.

And suspicious.

130
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:35,854
[TOHRU] I definitely can't tell
them I stayed at his house.

131
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:39,983
What a buncha airheads.
Must be nice to be so dumb.

Is that you, Soma?

00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,538
What did you tell your friends?

135
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,875
Our secret, is it safe?

136
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,753
I‐I didn't tell them anything.

137
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:00,962
Oh, no, were you worried

138
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:03,131
that I would go and
blab to everybody?

I promise, you don't have
to worry about me.

My mom always told me
that only bad people

spill secrets that have
been entrusted to them.

No. I'm concerned‐‐

We could even seal it with fire
or blood if you wanted to!

[YUKI]
No, listen.

do stuff like that all the‐‐

That's not the issue here.

I'm sorry,

but even though you're doing
your best not to tell,

150
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:29,407
we might end up
erasing your memories.

Well, not literally.

153
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:36,748
It's more like a strong
form of hypnotism.

154
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,334
[YUKI] A long time ago,
the truth about me came out,

155
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:42,420
just like it did this morning.

156
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,255
I was playing around
with some friends

157
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,132
and a girl hugged me.

158
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,346
[YUKI]
It was a giant mess.

159
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:53,640
And in the end, everyone
who saw it happen

160
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:55,892
had their memories suppressed.

161
00:07:56,851 --> 00:08:00,188
[YUKI]
Akito, am I really so strange

162
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,525
that I have to hide who I am?

163
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:06,069
[AKITO]
Yes. You are.

164
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:09,072
A person turning into a rat
is obviously something

165
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:12,158
no one would understand.

166
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,911
People would be sickened
by your existence,

167
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:18,123
and they'd begin to
avoid you at all costs.

168
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:21,584
You would be utterly alone.

169
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,795
Is that what you want?

170
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,799
[TOHRU]
Are you okay?

171
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,220
[YUKI]
I'm sorry.

172
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:36,641
But I can't go against whatever
Akito says is right for us.

173
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:41,604
No matter what's decided,
I must go along with it.

174
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,898
That's just... how it is.

175
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,734
Wait. Hold on, I‐‐

176
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:53,908
[TOHRU]
I'm so sorry!

177
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,786
It was an accident, I swear!
I‐I'd never do that on purpose!

178
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:59,748
[YUKI] It's okay.
Just as long as no one saw.

179
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,751
[TOHRU]
What I wanted to say was...

180
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:06,212
...I appreciate you being
concerned about me.

181
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:09,299
It makes me happy. So, thanks.

182
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,551
And I get what you said.

183
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:14,429
This is an important secret
I accidentally found out.

184
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:17,348
Something that could have
a huge effect on you.

185
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,350
So please, I want you to do

186
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:23,813
whatever will make you and
your family feel the safest.

187
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:27,025
Sure, the idea of forgetting
does make me sad,

188
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:30,487
but if that's what I have
to do, I'll grin and bear it.

189
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,989
I do have one thing to ask you.

190
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:36,493
If I forget you,
please befriend me again.

191
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:37,994
[TOHRU gasps]

192
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:42,707
The amount of time we
stay as animals varies.

193
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,794
There we go. All done.

194
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,755
[TOHRU]
Oh. Your tie is crooked.

195
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,634
[YUKI] I'm not great
when it comes to that.

196
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,177
No sweat.

197
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:57,472
It's lucky for you,
I'm here to help.

198
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:00,683
[AKITO] People would be
sickened by your existence.

199
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,436
You would be utterly alone.

200
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:07,357
[YUKI] Miss Honda,
you don't feel... sickened?

201
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,234
Oh, no. I'm all better.

202
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:12,320
Huh? No, that isn't
what I meant.

203
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:16,991
[YUKI]
Shall we go?

204
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,285
[TOHRU]
Yeah. Good idea.

205
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:23,289
[YUKI]
Thanks for that.

206
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:27,001
[TOHRU] No problem.
I've got a knack for neckties.

207
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,553
[KYO]
Call a pro to really fix it.

208
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,680
For now, you just need to
keep the rain out, right?

209
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:41,558
[TOHRU]
Oh. Thank you.

210
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:42,559
[KYO]
H‐Hey!

211
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,144
Y‐Yes?

212
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:50,150
[KYO] I, uh, can get kind of a
one‐track mind when I'm upset.

213
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:53,319
So, about this morning...

214
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,531
...I wanted to say I'm so‐‐

215
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:59,742
[SHIGURE]
Yuki, Tohru, I'm home!

216
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:02,912
Is that clumsy kitten who lost
another fight still here?

217
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:05,540
Forget it, dammit.

218
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:09,127
No. Please. What
were you saying?

219
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,339
[SHIGURE]
It's good news.

220
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,258
Tohru is allowed
to live with us.

221
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,970
So long as she continues
to keep our secret.

222
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,389
Does that mean I
won't be punished?

223
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:22,724
As long as you stay quiet,

224
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,309
you won't have done
anything wrong.

225
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,476
[TOHRU]
I will!

226
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,730
[TOHRU] Thank goodness!
I get to keep my memories!

227
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:32,358
To be honest, that plan almost
sounds too good to be true.

228
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,569
Like you two might be scheming

229
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:37,405
and mixing up Miss Honda
in some plot or other.

230
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:40,658
Oh, come on. Would I do that?

231
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,704
[AKITO] I'll trust this "Tohru"
person, for the time being.

232
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:48,124
This might be a
good opportunity‐‐

233
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:51,211
for Yuki and Kyo, as well as me.

234
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:53,796
[SHIGURE chuckles nervously]

235
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:56,090
[TOHRU]
Excuse me.

236
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:59,552
Um, it's probably a little
late to be saying this,

237
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:02,513
but I'm so glad I've
gotten to meet you.

238
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,682
The feeling's mutual.

239
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,477
Um, yes. I do agree.

240
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:12,065
And it's a pleasure to
meet you, too. Uh, Kyo.

241
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:15,235
You can leave me outta this!
I've got nothing to do‐‐ Uh!

242
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:18,238
[splash]

243
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,781
[KYO]
What the hell was that for?!

244
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,116
[YUKI]
Go away. Outsider.

245
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,952
[TOHRU]
Well, I guess that's that.

246
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,871
I'll be staying with
the Soma family for now.

247
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,626
This is amazing.

248
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,336
I can't believe you
managed to clean up

249
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:34,754
such a disgusting kitchen.

250
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:36,965
Well, I gave it my best.

251
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,550
I didn't even know that
Shigure owned a rice cooker.

252
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,886
Yeah, I had to excavate it.

253
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,432
How does it taste?

254
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,393
I hope all the flavors
are coming through.

255
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,980
Delicious. I haven't had
a meal like this in a while.

256
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,231
Oh, wonderful!

257
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:54,524
Where is Shigure?

258
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:58,695
He and that stupid Cat have been
gone for quite a long time.

259
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,614
And you went out for a little
bit earlier, too, didn't you?

260
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:04,534
[YUKI] Yeah. To my secret
base in the backyard.

261
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:08,955
What? A secret base? Is it
like some private fortress?

262
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:12,917
[YUKI] Eh, it's probably not
as interesting as you imagine.

263
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,086
But I can show it to you
sometime if you'd like.

264
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,505
[gasps] Wait, seriously?

265
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:18,423
That's so exciting!

266
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,799
I saw one once when I was a kid,

267
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:21,009
but no girls were
allowed inside.

268
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:21,884
Shut up!

269
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,595
Will you listen to me
for one second, Kyo?

270
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,223
I'm so pissed. Is this
what makes you happy?

271
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:28,725
Manipulating innocent
people like me?

272
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:29,475
[SHIGURE]
Slow down!

273
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,561
Sure, I'm enjoying
this thoroughly...

274
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:32,395
[TOHRU]
Welcome home.

275
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:34,439
Would you two like
something to eat, maybe?

276
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,481
Hell no!

277
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,692
Don't take your
anger out on her.

278
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:38,860
And no shoes inside.

279
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,195
Says the man who did laps
around the room in his.

280
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,072
How nice. Is that food for us?

281
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:46,159
'Scuse me. Why's he upset?

282
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,869
[SHIGURE
It's his nature.

283
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,120
Also, I might've tricked him

284
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:51,205
into taking a school
transfer exam.

285
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,373
A transfer?

286
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:54,417
Yep, it's official
and everything.

287
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,085
Tomorrow, our Kyo
will be walking

288
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:58,671
the same school hallways
as the two of you.

289
00:13:58,713 --> 00:13:59,547
Thanks for the foo‐‐

290
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:02,508
You're done. Put that
down and get out.

291
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,260
[SHIGURE]
I knew you'd be mad.

292
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:08,264
Here's the thing:
This is good for him.

293
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:10,808
He should be going to the
boys' school near his place,

294
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,187
but he hasn't shown up to class
in over four months now.

295
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,606
Apparently, he's been
training in the mountains.

296
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:17,899
Why training?

297
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,319
All that he wants is to
beat Yuki in a real fight.

298
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:24,614
They've been rivals ever
since they were kids.

299
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,491
He's an idiot.

300
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,201
Thanks for the food.

301
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,078
Of course.

302
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:34,040
[TOHRU] I wonder why Kyo
wants to beat up Soma so bad.

303
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:37,210
Maybe he resents the fact
that he was tricked.

304
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:40,171
Just like the Cat in
the old zodiac story.

305
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:43,883
But I get the feeling
it's not my place to ask.

306
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:45,968
At least not right now.

307
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,262
Especially since I'm
pretty sure that Kyo

308
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:51,349
doesn't like me
in the slightest.

309
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,017
Just my luck.

310
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:56,062
I finally get to meet
the zodiac Cat

311
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:58,523
and everything goes wrong.

312
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,192
[STUDENT B]
Where is he?

313
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,403
[STUDENT C] Look, over there.
The boy with the orange hair.

314
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,862
[STUDENT D]
Think it's his natural color?

315
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,239
[STUDENT E]
He's super cute!

316
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,990
[CLASSMATE A]
So, you're related to Soma?

317
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,826
[CLASSMATE B]
I bet you're crazy close, huh?

318
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,119
[CLASSMATE A]
Tell us everything.

319
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,703
[TOHRU]
He's terrified.

320
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,665
[STUDENT F] Hey, Yuki.
I hear that's your cousin.

321
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,959
Why haven't you
introduced us already?

322
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,293
[YUKI]
Sorry, Senpai.

323
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,712
It's true that we're
technically cousins,

324
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,215
but I've never spoken
to him before.

325
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,175
[TOHRU]
What's with that weird smile?

326
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:28,010
[UOTANI]
I'm diggin' his carrot top.

327
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,429
Maybe 'cause it kinda reminds me

328
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,889
of the blazing hair your
mom use to have, Tohru.

329
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,684
[TOHRU] Yeah. Now that
you say that, I see it.

330
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,060
I feel them.

331
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:39,272
His strong waves are exactly
the same as Yuki Soma's.

332
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:42,108
They're odd. What am I sensing?

333
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,527
It's almost as if the
waves aren't human.

334
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:47,947
[TOHRU] Whoa. Hana's Wave
Report is totally spot on.

335
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:49,449
[CLASSMATE D]
Something wrong?

336
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,909
[CLASSMATE C] Hey. Where
are you going? We were ta‐‐

337
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,705
[CLASSMATE C]
Ow, that hurts! Let go of me!

338
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,331
[CLASSMATE E]
Oh my gosh! What is your issue?

339
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,666
[CLASSMATE D]
Get your hands off of her!

340
00:15:58,708 --> 00:15:59,959
Everybody leave me alone!

341
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,669
[CLASSMATES scream]

342
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,798
[CLASSMATE D]
No way. He's incredible.

343
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,843
[UOTANI] Looks like he'll
be fun to have in class.

344
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,268
[YUKI]
Hey.

345
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:21,022
Would you try thinking before
you cause a big scene like that?

346
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,732
Why do you go here?

347
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:27,069
The place is crawling with
girls. You're insane.

348
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,654
It's better than
being forced to go

349
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,324
to the all‐boys'
school Akito picked.

350
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:35,077
I want at least one foot
outside of the Soma cage.

351
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:38,372
I can't understand why you
want to be inside it so badly.

352
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:39,290
[growls]

353
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,959
Course you don't!
You'd never understand!

354
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,044
I'm gonna win!

355
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,087
I'll beat you and become
a full‐fledged member

356
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,589
of the Soma clan.

357
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:49,133
I won't let them ostracize me
anymore, you hear me?

358
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,426
Please don't!

359
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,348
I'm‐I'm so sorry.

360
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,641
But you shouldn't‐‐

If you fight at school, you‐you
could get in trouble, or‐‐

362
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,229
Will you shut up already?!

363
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,064
This isn't any of your business!

364
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,857
What's your deal anyway?!
Stop causing...

365
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:06,067
That's enough.

366
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,109
...get out of here!

367
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,319
[KYO grunts]

368
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:14,242
Maximum... anger.

369
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:18,454
He already hated me, and this
made things even worse.

370
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:23,459
You really are a hopeless fool.

371
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:26,045
[KYO]
Aren't you gonna kick me?

372
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:29,048
Sometimes not getting
kicked hurts more.

373
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:38,099
[SHIGURE] Your very first day
and you skipped class?

374
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,643
[KYO] Listen, I wanna
leave this house.

375
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,645
It's only your third night here.

376
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:46,899
Think of it as training.
That'll help you tough it out.

377
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:49,485
[KYO] I always end up
saying mean things to her.

378
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:50,861
Every time.

379
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,321
Wait, who?

380
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:55,157
Oh. You must mean Tohru.

381
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,368
[KYO]
I can't do this, okay?

382
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:01,497
I'm not cut out for living
so close to other people.

383
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:05,793
Nah, it's just that you don't
have much experience yet.

384
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,336
Think of it this way:

385
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:09,422
You can break a table
in half with one punch,

386
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,382
we're well aware of that,

387
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,593
but you're also capable
of stopping that punch

388
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,970
right before it lands.

389
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,597
That's because you've trained.

390
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:20,308
And getting along with people
takes practice, too.

391
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,393
If you interact with strangers,

392
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:25,813
you might hurt them, or you
might end up hurt by them.

393
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:27,565
But that's how you learn,

394
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:30,151
about other people
and about yourself.

395
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,068
If you don't do that,

396
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,739
you'll never be
capable of connecting.

397
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,034
So keep training and resist
the urge to run away.

398
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:41,662
Then, one day, when you meet
a girl who says she loves you,

399
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:44,832
you'll be able to
treasure her completely.

400
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:47,501
Like such a girl exists.

401
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,587
And what will you
do if she does?

402
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,922
[KYO]
That's a pretty easy question.

403
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,508
I'll start out by asking
her if she's crazy.

404
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,844
Is that so?

405
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,179
[YUKI]
I'm home.

406
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,765
But where's Tohru?
Still at school?

407
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:01,766
At work.

408
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:02,975
She won't be done until late,

409
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:04,935
so I'm thinking of
walking her home.

410
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,605
[SHIGURE]
Yeah. That's a smart idea.

411
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,316
Perverts sometimes
creep around here.

412
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,072
[TOHRU sighs]

413
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,449
[KYO] Stop causing problems
and get out of here!

[sighs]

415
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:22,662
[TOHRU] When I said
I'd quit being the Dog

416
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,372
and become a Cat instead,

417
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:27,667
I really meant it
with all my heart.

418
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,795
I can't believe the real
Cat spirit hates me.

419
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,381
[KYOKO]
Just be you, Tohru.

420
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:36,550
I know I should be, Mom.
This won't bring me down.

Don't tell me...

00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:48,771
Is this... some creepy
forest pervert?

Oh. Oh, no.

So, you hit me. Whatever.

00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,581
Just drop it.

Okay. Uh, Kyo?

433
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:11,627
[KYO]
Yeah, what?

434
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:13,129
I was just saying your name.

435
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,630
Well, it sounded like
you were calling me!

436
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:16,048
Sorry!

437
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,509
[KYO]
No, it's fine.

438
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:21,637
You can say my name
without needing something.

439
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,307
And I know you don't mean
to cause any problems for us.

440
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,393
And if I piss you off,
you can go ahead and hit me,

I don't care.

442

[TOHRU]
Am I reading this wrong,

443
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:35,234
or is he trying to apologize?

444
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:39,280
Is that why he's
out here? To find me?

445

[TOHRU]
Hey, Kyo.

00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,784
I'm sorry I hurt you.

447
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:46,746
But the honest truth is,
I thought you were a pervert,

448
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,497
that's why I swung
my bag at you!

[TOHRU]
I actually really like you!

I have always loved

Uh...

453
00:20:56,046 --> 00:21:01,051
I'm serious. I even wanted to
be born the Year of the Cat.

454
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,261
I'm confusing you.

455
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:06,182
What I mean is, I want
us to be friends!

456
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,686
What'll you do
if she does exist?

457
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:13,230
A girl who says she loves you.

458

Ugh. Nothin's good about
the Year of the Cat, okay?

459
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:23,407
[TOHRU] I think... I might be
starting to understand him,

460

just a little bit.

461
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:27,912
He can be awkward
sometimes, yes,

462
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:31,540
but I think he has
a gentle heart.

463
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:34,418
He knows what it feels
like to be sorry.

464
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,837
And he's an honest person.

[SHIGURE] Why, Kyo, you
lecherous little deviant!

What gives you the
right to call me that?!

467
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:45,554
You know, Tohru,

00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:47,681
he personally offered to
walk you back from work

00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,433
so you'd get home
safe and sound.

470
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,977
That was a one‐time thing;
it won't happen again.

471
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,438
[TOHRU]
Okay. But I'm glad you're here.

472
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,483
It's really nice to see you
eating a proper meal with us.

473
00:21:57,525 --> 00:22:00,569
So how is it?
Up to your standards?

474
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:05,825
What do you want?

475
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:06,617
Nothing.

476
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:07,868
You were looking at me.

477
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,203
You're in front of me.

478
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:11,747
Sure, like you'd gimme
that look for no reason!

479
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:12,790
Is the food that bad?

480
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:14,291
It is!

481
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,295
[TOHRU]
Then I'll try harder next time.

482
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,756
[KYO]
I mean. Uh, no.

483
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,719
[TOHRU]
As you can see, Mom,

484
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,346
we patched things up.

485
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:31,267
And I have a feeling the
days ahead will be fun!

486
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:07,279
