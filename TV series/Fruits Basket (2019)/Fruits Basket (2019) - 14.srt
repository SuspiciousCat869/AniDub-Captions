1
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:17,935
[MOMIJI] I think every
memory is important.

2
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:20,020
Nothing's okay to forget.

3
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:30,072
[MOMIJI]
Nothing.

4
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:35,827
[TOHRU] Shigure, is there
anything you need me to do

5
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,371
around here on May 1st?

6
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:39,957
I'd like to go out for a few
hours in the afternoon.

7
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:41,708
Oh! Take all the time you want!

8
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,628
I'll be out on an errand
most of the day myself.

9
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,713
What's the story?
Hanging out with friends?

10
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:49,675
Yes. It's been a year
since my mom passed.

11
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,843
We're visiting her grave.

12
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:52,928
[SHIGURE]
Good girl.

13
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,972
The first anniversary, huh?

14
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:56,056
That's right.

15
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:58,559
But we're not doing anything
too special for it.

16
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,644
I'm sorry. I can't go.

17
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:02,771
Uh, no. Please don't worry!

18
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:04,815
[YUKI] Would it be
okay if I joined you?

19
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,275
You want to?

20
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,277
I'd like to pay my respects.

21
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,737
If you don't mind the company.

22
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:14,533
Thank you very much.
Mom will be so happy!

23
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:17,953
And Kyo? Surely you've got
nothing better to do.

24
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:19,830
You should tag along with them.

25
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:57,886
[UOTANI] Say what?
The prince is coming with us?

26
00:02:57,928 --> 00:02:58,804
What about Kyon?

27
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,847
Well, I don't really know.

28
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,599
He didn't give
much of an answer.

29
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:03,975
Oh, man, just think.

30
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,812
Kyoko woulda've had so
much fun with that punk.

31
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,356
I'm talkin' some
hardcore tormenting.

32
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:11,108
[KYOKO]
Look at this hair, Carrots!

33
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,192
I'm gonna eat you right up.

34
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:12,943
[KYON]
Cut it out.

35
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,236
Then, right when
it seemed as though

36
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,738
he couldn't take
any more torture,

37
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,325
she'd pull him into a bear hug
strong enough to pop his back.

38
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:24,955
[TOHRU] That would be
terrible. In so many ways!

39
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:27,833
It's odd. This
doesn't feel real.

40
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,377
A whole year has
passed since that day?

41
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:31,628
I know what you mean.

42
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,463
It still feels like she'll
pop out of nowhere

43
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:34,965
looking just fine.

44
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:39,302
Apologizing to us because this
was all some twisted joke.

45
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:45,767
[UOTANI] Sorry. I'm being
a total downer, huh?

46
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:50,021
I guess it just goes to show
what a badass Kyoko was.

47
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,774
The legend of the "Crimson
Butterfly of Route Seven"

48
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:55,360
will never be forgotten.

49
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:56,361
[TOHRU giggles]

50
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,237
[MOMIJI]
Tohru!

51
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:58,739
[TOHRU gasps, yelps]

52
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,198
Please, you gotta hide me!

53
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,283
But from what?

54
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,493
Classmates. We're playing
cops and robbers.

55
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:05,287
And I'm the criminal!

56
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,914
There you are.
No use running now!

57
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,916
Tohru, you work today, right?

58
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,293
I'll see you then!

59
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,669
[STUDENT B]
Stop, you thief!

60
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:16,089
Hey, you guys! I found him!
Second floor, hurry!

61
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:17,591
Oh, no, not good.

62
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,968
Please slow down.
Watch where you're going.

63
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,303
That kid.

64
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:25,098
I wonder which one of his
parents is from Germany.

65
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,683
[TOHRU]
Now that I think about it,

66
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:28,351
I don't hear any of
the Somas say much

67
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,895
about their moms or dads.

68
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,980
Hardly anything at all.

69
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:35,358
I've never even laughed like
that in front of my parents.

70
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:40,572
Whoops! Sorry, Tohru!

71
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,365
‐‐[STUDENT B] Gaining on ya!
‐‐Momiji!

72
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:46,161
Please stop. This could
end up being a total mess!

73
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:49,998
Look at her.
She's worked so hard.

74
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,460
Even if she's worried right now,
she's still cheerful.

75
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:55,587
To get to this point,
she must've talked herself

76
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,756
out of countless dark moments.

77
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:00,258
But I think... if she died,

78
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,552
I wouldn't be able
to smile for a year.

79
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:06,431
Maybe much longer.
Or ever again.

80
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,850
I might even wish
I'd never met her

81
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:11,812
so that I wouldn't have
to feel her absence.

82
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:18,318
[HANAJIMA] She's put in so much
effort to get to this point.

83
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,576
Are you done after we
take these bags out?

84
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:27,369
[TOHRU]
Almost.

85
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,246
I've still gotta empty the
trash in the breakroom.

86
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,831
I can do that.

87
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,123
Oh, that's okay!

88
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,085
It's fine I'm having fun!

89
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,211
Here.

90
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:41,132
I really appreciate you
helping me out like this.

91
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,843
[MOMIJI] I told you
not to worry about it!

92
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,886
Is Yuki walking you
home again today?

93
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:45,637
Yup.

94
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:46,763
Kyo should be a good friend

95
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:48,974
and come and get you
every once in a while.

96
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,976
But he's stubborn.

97
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,186
[TOHRU]
By the way, Momiji?

98
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:54,020
[MOMIJI]
<i>Was</i>?

99
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,147
[TOHRU] I know one of your
parents came from Germany,

100
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,358
but was it your mom or your dad?

101
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,693
My <i>mutti</i>!

102
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:02,779
And, um, that means...

103
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:04,322
"<i>Mutti</i>" means "Mama."

104
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,533
Got it, so your mom is German.

105
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:09,953
[MOMIJI] I've got a picture
of her here. Ta‐dah!

106
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:12,038
Wow! She's so gorgeous!

107
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,331
[MOMIJI chuckles]

108
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,084
[TOHRU] I can definitely
see the resemblance

109
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:17,669
between the two of them.

110
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:21,423
She met Papa‐‐ Oh,
he's a Soma, of course.

111
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,633
Anyway, they met when
they were in college.

112
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:25,218
Then they got married.

113
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,805
I don't know how he managed to
attract such a beautiful person.

114
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,390
Oh, is that so?

115
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:33,393
[MOMIJI] And guess what!
I have a little sister, too!

116
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:36,438
Her name's Momo!
She looks just like Mama.

117
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,149
Huh? I can't believe I didn't
even know you have a sister.

118
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,442
[MOMIJI]
<i>Ja</i>!

119
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,736
She's just in second
grade, though.

120
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:46,031
Oh, and she's not one
of the zodiac spirits.

121
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,700
You wouldn't believe
how spoiled she is.

122
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,870
She follows Mama everywhere,
like some kinda baby duck.

123
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:52,746
And she's not very great...

124
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,414
[TOHRU]
He sounds so happy.

125
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:57,167
[MOMIJI] ...when she does, it's
a little clumsy and jumbled.

126
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,461
It's pretty much
the cutest thing!

127
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:03,048
Mama and Momo usually come here
to pick Papa up after work.

128
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,758
So they're probably around.

129
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,469
It's so great you all
get to go home together.

130
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,555
<i>Ja</i>, well, that
would be <i>wunderbar</i>,

131
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:13,558
but Mama doesn't know
anything about me.

132
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,644
[TOHRU]
Uh?

133
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,104
[MOMIJI'S MOTHER with accent]
Oh, Momiji.

134
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,899
That is you, isn't it?

135
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,859
What are you doing
here, of all places?

136
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,903
And so late in the evening?

137
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:28,365
[TOHRU]
Speak of the devil. It's her!

138
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,240
[MOMIJI chuckles]

139
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,910
My friend works here,
so I came to keep her company.

140
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,828
No one likes to
clean alone, right?

141
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,289
[MOMIJI'S MOTHER]
That's very kind, but remember,

142
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:37,832
this isn't a playground.

143
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,418
You're right. I'm so sorry.

144
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,463
[TOHRU] Then this must
be his sister Momo.

145
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:47,217
[TOHRU] Momiji looks more
like their mom than she does.

146
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,677
[MOMIJI'S MOTHER]
Think of your poor <i>mutti</i>.

147
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,638
She'll be so worried if
you're not home for dinner.

148
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,057
Oh, it's okay! I'm leaving now!

149
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:56,768
[MOMIJI'S MOTHER] Straight
home. Don't take any detours.

150
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:57,852
[MOMIJI]
I won't!

151
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:02,941
We should get going, too,
<i>engel</i>. Papa must be waiting.

152
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,818
Thanks for your hard work.

153
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,945
Yeah. Sure.

154
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,365
[MOMIJI'S MOTHER]
Come on, Momo.

155
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:15,537
[MOMIJI]
<i>Ungluck</i>!

156
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,664
What a pain.

157
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:20,041
Today is not my lucky day.

158
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:23,169
I'll have to apologize
to Papa later.

159
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,838
Momiji.

160
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,884
<i>Ja</i> . Like I said,
she doesn't know me.

161
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:34,097
She forgot. She had
her memories erased.

162
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:35,390
[gasps]

163
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,642
[MOMIJI] She obviously
knows what my name is,

164
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,310
but thinks I belong
to a different branch

165
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,730
of the Soma family.

166
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,648
Children possessed
by a zodiac spirit

167
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,859
are born two months
before full term.

168
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,779
And that's only the beginning
of their problems.

169
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:54,117
Just think: You meet someone
you love, get married,

170
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:57,078
and then you find out you're
going to have a child together.

171
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,497
You want everything
to be perfect.

172
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,833
But then, when you hold
your newborn in your arms,

173
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:05,086
it turns into a
strange, tiny animal.

174
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:09,257
Imagine how devastating
that must be for a mother.

175
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:14,012
To cradle your baby and have it
turn into something inhuman.

176
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:17,557
The mothers usually
react one of two ways.

177
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:20,185
They're either extremely
overprotective of their kids,

178
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:24,522
or they end up rejecting
them completely.

179
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:29,736
<i>Mutti</i>... fell into
the second category.

180
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:32,614
She rejected me, body and soul.

181
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,450
She wouldn't even look at me.

182
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:39,370
When she wasn't sleeping or
hiding, she was always on edge.

183
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:43,374
Sometimes screaming
hysterically.

184
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,542
Thinking about it now,

185
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,462
I think it emotionally
broke something in her.

186
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:48,922
Like Kana.

187
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,301
[MOMIJI'S FATHER]
Momiji.

188
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:56,387
Your mother might not
make it through this,

189
00:09:56,429 --> 00:10:00,058
but the doctor thinks...
it is possible she'll get better

190
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,353
if she forgets all about you.

191
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:06,147
I know that would
be painful for you.

192
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:08,191
But I promise to love
you that much more

193
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,860
to make up for losing her.

194
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:13,655
If you love Mama like I do,

195
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:17,075
then this is the one way
you can save her life.

196
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,123
[HATORI]
Are you certain?

197
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:26,793
You're sure you want to
forget about your son?

198
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:31,798
It's a big decision.
You won't regret it?

199
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,386
You really want to sit there
<i>und</i> ask me such a question?

200
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:39,180
Then I'll tell you.

201
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:42,976
I regret that I ever gave birth
to that cursed creature.

202
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:48,148
[MOMIJI]
And that was it.

203
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,942
I was erased from
Mama's memories.

204
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:55,738
It wasn't long before she
started getting better.

205
00:10:55,780 --> 00:11:00,076
After two months went by,
she was even smiling again.

206
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:05,081
[MOMIJI]
Mostly....

207
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:09,002
...I just hope that I really
was able to save Mama.

208
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:12,797
[TOHRU]
He's been watching over her

209
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,341
this whole time, hasn't he?

210
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:20,221
Secretly, from afar...
so she wouldn't see him.

211
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:24,934
[TOHRU] I bet that day when
I first met him downstairs,

212
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:28,813
he'd come here to catch
a glimpse of his mother.

213
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:36,821
[MOMIJI] Anyway, I'm never
going to be like her.

214
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,156
I've decided to live my life

215
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:41,910
keeping every one of my
memories close to my heart.

216
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,203
Even sad ones.

217
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:46,414
Or memories that only
ever seem to hurt me.

218
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:51,085
Of times I sometimes
wish I could forget.

219
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:55,048
I've promised myself I won't
let them go, no matter what.

220
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:00,637
[MOMIJI] Because if I can stand
up and face those memories,

221
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:04,557
if I can learn to accept them,

222
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,851
then I believe one day,
I can become a person

223
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:10,855
who isn't beaten down by things
that have hurt me in the past.

224
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:16,736
I want to believe
I'll be stronger.

225
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:18,863
I want to believe there
isn't a single memory

226
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:21,115
that it's okay to forget.

227
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:24,327
And that's why, in truth...

228
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:28,164
...I never wanted Mama
to forget anything.

229
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:29,916
I wanted her to
try to get better.

230
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:34,462
To not give up.
To try and love me.

231
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:38,591
Which... is just me
being selfish, I know.

232
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:43,221
So that's a secret.

233
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:57,986
That's me. I'm the same.

234
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,238
I wanna be like that.

235
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:06,661
[TOHRU] I wanna embrace all of
my memories, and keep believing,

236
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:09,038
just like Momiji.

237
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,290
[KYO]
Hey.

238
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:16,087
Just so you know,
I'm going to the gravesite.

239
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:24,137
[TOHRU]
That way I won't be defeated.

240
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,848
And someday,
I can find the beauty

241
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:30,268
hidden in the difficult
moments of my life.

242
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:44,115
[YUKI] Fortunately
the weather cleared up.

243
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:47,744
It's been so gray lately,
but this is nice.

244
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,747
I think maybe it's because
Mom is happy today.

245
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,915
After all, she's got
a few new people

246
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,709
coming to say "hi" to her.

247
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,255
[UOTANI]
Tohru!

248
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:01,341
[TOHRU] There you are!
Thanks for coming!

249
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,550
Yeah, of course.

250
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:04,469
Perfect weather to
visit a grave, huh?

251
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,303
[TOHRU]
It is!

252
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,096
Why the heck are you
two dressed like that?!

253
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:08,348
You got a problem with this?

254
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,433
Yes, my dress is
too plain, isn't it.

255
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:11,642
Are you crazy?!

256
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,394
[YUKI]
Um, excuse me, but...

257
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:16,105
...that's the kind of coat
biker gangs wear, right?

258
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:17,940
Huh. You know your stuff.

259
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,859
Yup. This belonged
to Tohru's mom

260
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:21,569
before she passed it on to me.

261
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:24,697
It's the esteemed coat
of the Crimson Butterfly.

262
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:27,575
Uh. Of course. What's that?

263
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:30,578
That was Mom's name when she
was still an active member.

264
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,413
[YUKI]
Member of what?

265
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:36,084
[UOTANI] The crew's all here,
so let's hit the road.

266
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,251
[YUKI]
These girls.

267
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,879
[KYO]
Could they be more ridiculous?

268
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:46,052
Oh, hey. Looks pretty clean.

269
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:48,513
[HANAJIMA]
Did someone already stop by?

270
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,431
It must've been my grandpa.

271
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:54,060
See? Look. He knows what
Mom's favorite food is.

272
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:55,395
[KYO]
Oh, yeah, that guy.

273
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:56,979
[TOHRU]
Uh‐huh.

274
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,732
What's his deal?
Was he your mom's dad?

275
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:02,193
No, he's my father's father.

276
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:05,571
Yeah, our Kyoko didn't
really talk to her parents.

277
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:08,157
And what about your dad?

278
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:12,412
Apparently, he caught a really
bad cold, and then he died.

279
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,539
I was pretty little
when it happened,

280
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,999
so I don't remember
much about him.

281
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:22,422
[YUKI] No wonder she was
so worried when I felt sick.

282
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:25,883
[TOHRU]
Hi, Mom. It's me and my friends.

283
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,427
[HANAJIMA]
Greetings.

284
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:28,886
There's not much to do.

285
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,222
The old man cleaned it up
pretty good earlier.

286
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:33,933
The flowers even look new, too.

287
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:37,812
[YUKI] Her father died,
and then her mother.

288
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:39,939
I don't understand.

289
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:43,234
How is it that she can still
smile and be cheerful?

290
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:47,738
Why isn't she radiating
despair instead?

291
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,617
I remember the day
when it happened.

292
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:55,621
A teacher came to get her.
She was obviously surprised.

293
00:15:55,663 --> 00:16:00,209
And after they spoke a little,
she ran from the classroom.

294
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:03,129
Her two friends immediately
went after her,

295
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:06,924
and of course, the other
students all gossiped.

296
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,051
I remember wondering
for a second

297
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:13,139
if maybe one of her relatives
had gotten into an accident.

298
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:16,392
But I didn't give it
much thought.

299
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:19,103
At the time, I was
only vaguely aware

300
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:23,524
that someone named Tohru Honda
even existed in this world.

301
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:28,529
Yet, now, we live beside each
other in the same house.

302
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:30,823
And she's always close by.

303
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,325
[TOHRU]
Hey, Yuki!

304
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:36,245
Look at these flowers.
Aren't they wonderful?

305
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:38,748
[YUKI]
Somehow, against all odds,

306
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,501
I can't help but smile
when she does.

307
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,212
[TOHRU]
Oh. Not good.

308
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,589
I messed up the arrangement.

309
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:49,050
[UOTANI] Give 'em here.
Prince, you hold these.

310
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,343
[YUKI]
Okay.

311
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:54,680
[KYO]
I was wondering...

312
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,182
[HANAJIMA]
Hm?

313
00:16:56,224 --> 00:17:01,437
[KYO] Can you, uh, see
ghosts and stuff like that?

314
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,314
Like, are there any here now?

315
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:06,943
I'd need spiritual power,
and I don't possess that.

316
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,278
[KYO] What? But that
weird wave stuff‐‐

317
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,530
[HANAJIMA]
Waves and spiritual power

318
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:11,948
are completely different.

319
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,824
You mustn't confuse them.

320
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:17,370
When I say I sense waves,
I basically mean human thoughts.

321
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:20,456
Think of them as words that
pass from brain to brain.

322
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:23,501
‐‐With no sounds required.
‐‐I already regret asking.

323
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:27,129
[HANAJIMA] Tell me,
why the sudden interest?

324
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:31,259
[KYO] No real reason.
I was just wondering.

325
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,677
[HANAJIMA]
Think of it this way.

326
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:36,138
Living humans are
stronger than the dead.

327
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,934
The waves of those who've left
us are most likely very weak,

328
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:43,020
so they end up being drowned out
by the powerful waves of those

329
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,690
who still feel the light
of the sun on their face.

330
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,985
The dead can't be heard.

331
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,861
It's interesting.

332
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:57,702
Right now, it feels as though
your waves are screaming at me.

333
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,913
Why is it that this graveyard
fills you with such chaos?

334
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:02,123
[gasps]

335
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,589
And guilt.

336
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,594
[TOHRU]
Hey, you two. What's up?

337
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,345
I hope I'm not interrupting.

338
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:18,264
No, you're good.

339
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:19,223
[HANAJIMA]
Indeed.

340
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:22,435
In that case,
please come with me!

341
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,353
We're all set up now.

342
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:26,606
[KYO gasps]

343
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,233
You shouldn't have a picnic
in a damn cemetery!

344
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:31,235
[UOTANI]
Huh? Get a grip, loser.

345
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:34,113
The rowdier we are,
the happier Kyoko is.

346
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:35,990
And what are we gonna do
if the priest sees us?

347
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:38,159
We'll just apologize, chill out.

348
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,870
[YUKI]
Still, this feels quite strange.

349
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,330
[UOTANI]
Will you sit down already?

350
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,957
I can't relax with you
hovering over me.

351
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:47,168
Ugh, fine. Here, you happy?

352
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:50,004
Hungry? What can I get
for you to eat first?

353
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:51,339
Whatever.

354
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,381
'Kay!

355
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:53,883
From what I can tell,

356
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,719
it sounds like you were both
close with Miss Honda's mother.

357
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,471
Yeah, she was real good to us.

358
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,473
Plus, such a big deal
that I looked up to her

359
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,600
before ever meeting
her in person.

360
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:03,434
[YUKI]
A big deal?

361
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:04,977
[UOTANI]
Do you not listen?

362
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:07,938
She was the legendary
Crimson Butterfly!

363
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,066
They say whenever she
rode her motorcycle,

364
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:13,653
the red tail lights looked like
wings fluttering in the wind.

365
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,453
[UOTANI]
I've been noticing.

366
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,247
Lately, those guys seem like
they're better and better

367
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,458
the more I see
'em all together

368
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,961
The prince certainly seems more
chill talking to mere mortals.

369
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:35,341
And no matter what Kyon says,
he definitely cares about Tohru.

370
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:37,468
Maybe one day he'll actually
find some courage

371
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,053
and confess his love to her.

372
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,346
That won't do.

373
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:42,556
I won't allow someone
to get into a relationship

374
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,308
with Tohru so easily.

375
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,269
What are you?
An overbearing dad?

376
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:50,231
[HANAJIMA] Something like that.
Besides, I'm half joking.

377
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,525
[UOTANI]
That means you're half serious.

378
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:55,903
As always, those Soma boys
exude such harsh waves.

379
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:58,489
Confusion. Chaos.

380
00:19:58,531 --> 00:19:59,657
I couldn't tell you why,

381
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:03,202
but their minds seem to be ruled
by dark, troubled thoughts.

382
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:05,162
It's almost palpable.

383
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,999
[HANAJIMA] All humans have
such thoughts, of course.

384
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,378
Those two are plagued by them
to an excessive degree.

385
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,423
As long as that
remains the case,

386
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:19,510
they probably don't have
the capacity for romance.

387
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:23,139
And if I were to be completely
honest, they're quite dense,

388
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,391
especially when the
matter of love is at hand.

389
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:27,977
That goes for our Tohru, too.

390
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,478
But who knows?

391
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,022
Sometimes feelings sprout
for no real reason,

392
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:35,317
blooming before you
can even realize it.

393
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,402
Oh, dear.

394
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:39,321
For some reason, thinking
about Tohru getting married

395
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,948
brings tears to my eyes.

396
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,324
I can't help it.

397
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:45,661
[UOTANI] Don't go getting
ahead of yourself.

398
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:47,538
[TOHRU sighs]

399
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,415
I don't know that there's
anything more refreshing

400
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:52,752
than a cup of tea
after a long day.

401
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:56,255
I had such a fun time
visiting the grave earlier.

402
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:57,757
And I'm so glad I finally

403
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,926
got to introduce Yuki
and Kyo to my mother.

404
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,931
[TOHRU] You see, Mom, those
two are always helping me out,

405
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,100
even when they don't know it.

406
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:12,521
I hope you get the chance to
meet Shigure sometime, too.

407
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:14,190
I want you to know:

408
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,650
Every day I spend with
the people in this house

409
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,027
is a good day.

410
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:20,613
I enjoy it more and more.

411
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:24,700
So you can watch over me
without worrying. I promise.

412
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:28,579
I'm just fine. Okay, Mom?

413
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:41,926
Did you seriously make tea
and then fall asleep out here?

414
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,136
Hey, you're gonna
catch a cold.

415
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:45,179
Come on, get up.

416
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:46,847
[giggles]

417
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:51,977
[KYO]
Like waking a child.

418
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,651
[KYO]
Hey.

419
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:11,539
[YUKI] The breeze must've
knocked these down.

420
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,334
[YUKI]
A hat?

421
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:16,502
[gasps]

422
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,393
I'm sorry.

423
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,612
[HATORI]
"I wouldn't say that."
