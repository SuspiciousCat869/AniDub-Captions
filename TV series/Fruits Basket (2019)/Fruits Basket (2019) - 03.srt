[TOHRU] The Culture Festival
is coming up next month,

2
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:20,729
and things are suddenly getting
really busy at school.

3
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:22,231
[YUKI]
It's decided.

4
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:25,025
For the festival, our class
is going to operate

5
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:26,985
a rice ball stand.

6
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,613
With that settled, I'd like
to hear everyone's thoughts

7
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:31,907
on the kinds of fillings
we should use.

8
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:33,283
[TOHRU]
Oh!

9
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:35,869
What if we did
tricolor rice balls?

10
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:37,371
So that in every rice ball,

11
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:39,665
people get three
different fillings to try.

12
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:40,874
A bargain!

13
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:42,209
That's cute. I like it.

Seriously?

15

[STUDENTS]
Huh?

16
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:46,922
We totally need to
ditch that idea, Yuki!

17
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:50,259
Yeah, what if she suggests a
tuna, kelp, pickled plum combo?

18
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,302
Oh my gosh, that would
be so disgusting!

Nowhere near as disgusting
as your personalities, morons.

What kind of psycho brings
a steel pipe to school?!

23
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,812
I say we should do
rice ball battles.

24
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:02,604
Battles?

25
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:04,773
Yeah, brutal
head‐to‐head matches.

26
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:06,817
First to pin their
opponent wins.

27
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:07,985
Weapons are allowed,

28
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:10,237
and customers have to duke
it out for their rice balls,

29
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:11,613
and the only rule is no killing.

30
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:12,906

Hard pass.

[KYO]
I'm trying to contribute here!

32
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:15,951
You jerks could at
least think about it!

33
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:16,910
That's one idea.

34
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:19,663
What if some of the rice
balls are actually duds?

35
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:21,373
We could make a deal
where you buy three

36
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,625
and then choose a
fourth one for free.

37
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:26,295
Only some of the choices
are simply... empty.

Sorry, Kyon‐Kyon,
yours was way too weird.

You've gotta tell us
what's up with the cats!

They're adorable!

I guess it's not surprising
cats like you so much.

63
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:22,726
It's not like I encourage them.
They show up on their own.

It happens to all of
us with our animals.

00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,130
Still, the fighting's no good.

159
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,298
‐‐Um, Kyo.
‐‐I'm comin' for ya!

160
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,383
[KYO yells]

161
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,134
[KYO]
Get ready, rodent!

162
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,020
[YUKI] Just looking at
you... makes me sick.

163
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:00,772
[TOHRU gasps]

164
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,399
Soma, wait.

165
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,776
[KYO]
Dammit.

166
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,945
Why can't I ever win?

167
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,989
[TOHRU] Are you all right?
You didn't bite your tongue‐‐

168
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,782
[KYO]
It's not my first fight!

169
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,493
Get out of here already.

170
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:15,578
Uh. I mean...

171
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,247
It's just that...

172
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:20,375
I keep losing to him,
and I hate it.

173
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:20,959
Huh?

174
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,545
Never mind, okay?
You should head home.

175
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:26,131
You've got work today, right?

176
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,549
[grunts]

177
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,510
[KYO] He was a lot rougher
on me than usual.

178
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:32,637
Guess he's in a bad mood.

179
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,851
[TOHRU]
Bye! Have a good night!

180
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:42,313
[TOHRU]
Soma's so polite.

181
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,650
And he's always considerate
of other people.

182
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,652
But maybe he can
only be that way

183
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:51,031
if he bottles up all
of his own feelings.

184
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,074
Until...

185
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:54,659
[yelps, screams]

186
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:01,499
[TOHRU]
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

187
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,793
Guess I shouldn't think so hard
when I'm going down stairs.

188
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:08,381
[STRANGER laughing]

189
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:10,800
Oh, hello there.

190
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:12,635
[TOHRU]
It's so late in the day.

191
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:15,305
I'm surprised someone's here.

192
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:16,556
[STRANGER]
Oh?

193
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:17,474
"Tohru"?

194
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:18,099
[TOHRU]
Huh?

195
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:19,684
You're Tohru Honda?

196
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,561
Yes, that's me, but
how do you know‐‐?

197
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:23,938
<i>Sieh da</i>! <i>Welch ein gluck</i>!

198
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,066
[TOHRU]
Huh? What language is that?

199
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,942
<i>Schon dich‐kennenzulernen.</i>

200
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,820
[TOHRU] I'm sorry,
but I don't understand.

201
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:31,696
[TOHRU gasps]

202
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,406
[STRANGER]
<i>Sehr hubsch</i>!

203
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:36,326
Uh. Okay! I mean, that was...

204
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,411
Sorry, but I've gotta go now!

205
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:40,789
[STRANGER]
Hm?

206
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,293
What's this?

207
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,800
[YUKI]
Miss Honda, you seem flustered.

208
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,260
Huh?! Oh, there was just
a stranger, and I, um...

209
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,096
[YUKI]
Stranger?

210
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,680
[TOHRU]
Soma?

211
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,266
Scare you? I'm sorry.

212
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:03,561
I wasn't expecting to see you.
Are you here to walk me home?

213
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,479
[YUKI]
Mh‐hm.

214
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,898
You shouldn't be out
this late on your own.

215
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,733
Thank you for
thinking about me.

216
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,319
You and Kyo are always so kind.

217
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,450
Well, then, shall we?

218
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:19,619
Please! Wait just second!

219
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,162
I wanted...

220
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:22,497
Well, I wanted to tell you

221
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:25,416
that if there's anything
that's been bothering you,

222
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,669
I'm happy to listen.

223
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,587
It's like how telling
somebody your bad dreams

224
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,422
makes them not so scary.

225
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,508
I thought, if you
felt comfortable

226
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,135
sharing your burdens with me,
then maybe they wouldn't...

227
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,053
All right, kiddos,
it's gettin' late.

228
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,305
Quit flirtin' and
go home already.

229
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,978
I meant it about
wanting to help.

230
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,271
Only now it looks like I've gone

231
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,399
and made everything worse,
like I always do.

232
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:55,822
[YUKI]
Back when I lived at home,

233
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,866
it felt like I was in a cage,

234
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,952
with the main family and
Akito always watching.

235
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,496
I longed to have a normal life.

236
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:06,124
To be surrounded
by normal people.

237
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:11,171
That's why I applied to a co‐ed
high school and left home.

238
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,173
But I was deluding myself.

239
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,633
I haven't really managed
to leave the cage.

240
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,302
I'm still living
in a Soma house,

241
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:21,890
and I still have no idea how to
interact with normal people.

242
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,309
I think I'm subconsciously
keeping my distance

243
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,103
so nobody will get too close.

244
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:30,440
But... Kyo is different.

245
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,275
People are drawn to him.

246
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:33,693
And he may be anxious at first,

247
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:36,279
but once he's used
to them, he relaxes.

248
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:39,157
He's always been like that.

249
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,201
Even if he can't be
one of the 12,

250
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:44,329
he knows how to get along
with regular people.

251
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:48,041
That's better, if you ask me.

252
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:51,794
I wish I could be like that,
more than anything.

253
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,671
It's why he gets on my nerves.

254
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,423
When I see him trying
so desperately

255
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:58,259
to join the same Somas
I wanna escape,

256
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:01,971
I can't help but think,
"What's wrong with me?"

257
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,933
[TOHRU]
Nothing's wrong with you.

258
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:08,102
Plenty of people out there
are drawn to you, too.

259
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,188
Girls at school really like you.

260
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,357
They think you're a kind person.

261
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:17,487
[YUKI] I'm only being kind
because I want them to like me.

262
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,239
Same as a child
handing out candy

263
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,950
because he wants the other
kids to play with him.

264
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,369
I'm nice for my own benefit.

265
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:29,499
[YUKI]
Maybe I'm a phony.

266
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:32,627
[TOHRU] I think I'm
starting to understand

267
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,420
what the problem is.

268
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:38,841
Kyo is jealous of Soma,
and Soma is jealous of Kyo.

269
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,761
That's why they resent
each other so much.

270
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,098
[TOHRU]
I guess it makes sense.

271
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,933
But as far as I'm concerned,

272
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:50,728
they're both really
great in their own way.

273
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,439
So why...?

274
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,358
I wish you and Kyo could‐‐

275
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:01,281
[TOHRU yelps]

276
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,283
Just wonderful.

277
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,329
[NEWSCASTER A]
An unexpected typhoon will bring

278
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:09,998
high winds and heavy rain
through tomorrow morning...

279
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,000
We're home. Is that the weather?

280
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,334
It's getting ugly out there.

281
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,670
They're saying it's an
unexpected typhoon.

282
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:18,339
It is really coming down.

283
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:21,175
[SHIGURE]
Uh! You're dripping everywhere!

284
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:30,852
[TOHRU]
Huh?

285
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,520
Soma!

286
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:33,396
[gasps]

287
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:36,816
[YUKI] Miss Honda!
It's dangerous out here!

288
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:38,484
This is nothing!

289
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:39,944
When the last typhoon
came through,

290
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:41,904
I spent the night outside
my tent holding‐‐

00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,364
[yelps]

292
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:44,574
You okay?

293
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,451
I'm fine, sorry.

294
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,245
But, Soma, what're
you doing out here?

295
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:51,205
This way.

296
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,958
I don't understand.
Where are we going?

297
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,918
[gasps]

298
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,378
[TOHRU]
Wow, it's a farm!

299
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,214
[YUKI] I'd say more of a
vegetable garden, actually.

300
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,258
How cool! Did you plant
it all yourself?

301
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,634
[YUKI]
Mhm.

302
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,678
The secret base I mentioned.

303
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,221
That's so heroic!

304
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,350
Risking life and limb to protect
your base from the typhoon.

305
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:13,436
Please allow me to join
you in your noble fight!

306
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,695
[YUKI]
You're a truly kind person.

307
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:23,738
[TOHRU]
Huh?

308
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,948
[gasps] Oh, gosh.
You're kidding, right?

309
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,826
I mean, nobody's ever said
anything like that to me before.

310
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,203
[yelps]

311
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,120
Well, maybe it's sort of like

312
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:32,413
what you were talking
about earlier:

313
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:35,291
A phony kindness to make it
seem like I'm a good person.

314
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:39,212
[YUKI] No, in your case,
I think it comes naturally.

315
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,672
[TOHRU]
You know, my mom once told me

316
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:45,301
that it was always better
to believe instead of doubt.

317
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:48,471
She said human beings
aren't born with kindness.

318
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:50,932
That's something that
only comes to us later.

319
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:53,434
All we have at
first are desires.

320
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:55,853
For things like
food and shelter.

321
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:59,690
Basically, just
survival instincts.

322
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:03,027
She said kindness is our
hearts growing inside us.

323
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,821
Growing like people‐‐
at different rates,

324
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:05,988
in different ways.

325
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,450
And... that's why one
person's kindness

326
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,369
might look different
from another's.

327
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,121
So...

328
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,248
[KYOKO] It's simple to
understand desire,

329
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:18,084
because it's something
everyone has from birth.

330
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:22,338
But each person's kindness is
pretty much handmade by them,

331
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:25,091
so it's easy for others
to misunderstand it,

332
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:27,093
or assume that it's phony.

333
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:29,345
But, Tohru...

334
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,723
[TOHRU] It was exciting to think
there were different shapes

335
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:36,018
of kindness in the world,
like round ones or pointy ones.

336
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,021
None quite the same.

337
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,857
This may sound strange,

338
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,651
but your kindness
reminds me of a candle.

339
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:45,570
It lights up.

340
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,989
When it does, I can't
help but smile

341
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,032
at the warmth it gives off.

342
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,827
There's nothing phony about it.

343
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:55,788
That was probably a pretty
strange analogy, I bet.

344
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,874
[YUKI]
No, not at all.

345
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:01,085
Actually, I'm kind of ashamed.

346
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,963
I shouldn't have unloaded
all of that on you.

347

[gasps]

349

The more you tell me about
your life and feelings,

350
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,219
the better friends
we can become.

351
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:13,389
It makes me so happy you
felt you could let me in.

352
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:15,808
Oh. I guess that
was pretty rude.

353
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,852
No, I wasn't thinking
that, I promise.

[KYOKO]
But, Tohru...

357
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,827
...I want you to
believe in people.

358
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:38,581
Doubting is easy.
Anybody can do that.

You be the kind of girl who
can have faith in others.

One day, I know...
that will help someone.

361
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:56,974
We defended it to the end!

At the low cost of
getting half‐drowned.

363

Are there any vegetables
ready to harvest?

364

[YUKI]
Well, the chives might be.

But I'll work on that.

to interact with people.

proud of that one.

Rice balls made with chives.

So you don't like them, then?

No way! I freakin' hate chives!

407
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:56,844
What's wrong with sticking
to something normal,

408
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,804
like salmon or octopus filling?

409

[TOHRU] The way you
shaped that rice ball!

You're great! Really!

414
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:08,981
It's not a big deal.

415
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:11,525
I had to make my own food
while I was training.

416
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,278
But just 'cause I can make it
doesn't mean it'll taste good.

417
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,905
It's still impressive.

418
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:18,991
If someone was working hard
training to make rice balls,

419
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:20,451
I think they would
be very jealous

of how good you are at it.

Rice ball training isn't
something people do.

Where do you even
get these ideas?

Huh?

431
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,102
Just think, if a person
is a rice ball,

432
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:49,021
and what's great about that
person is a pickled plum,

433
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:51,273
the problem is, the
plum's on their back,

434
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,484
where they can't see!

435

Maybe everyone in the

No two of them
are exactly alike.

But since they can't
see their backs,

440
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:07,289
they can't see the plums
that make them unique.

441
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,458
They think they don't
have anything special‐‐

plain white rice.

Even though that's
not true at all.

Even though they really do
have a plum of their own.

445
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,636
Maybe that's the
reason we get jealous.

I never went to bed.

472
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:25,034
Are you kidding? You didn't
get any sleep at all?

473
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:25,493
Nope!

474
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,203
With all the exciting
things to think about,

475
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,872
my brain wouldn't turn off.

476
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:30,664
What's this?

477
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:32,750
Rice balls with chives.

478
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,169
Kyo says he doesn't
like chives, though.

479
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:37,505
[KYO]
Yeah, because they're inedible.

480
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,301
Ah!

481
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:43,385
Eat it.

482
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,095
[TOHRU gasps]

483
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,972
[TOHRU]
Is it a lost cause?

484
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:49,517
Will they hate
each other forever?

485
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:50,935
I can't help but think,

486
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,271
if they could each understand
the other's good points,

487
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,482
maybe they could get along.

488
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:02,196
You know, I've really
misunderstood you.

489
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:03,322
I'm sorry.

490
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:06,575
Right back at ya. Sorry, man.

491
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:08,202
We should cherish
our friendship!

492
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:09,995
Let's never fight again, 'kay?

493
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,330
Yeah!

494
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:14,083
[TOHRU]
Somehow, that's not any better.

495
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,459
[doorbell rings]

496
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:16,752
[TOHRU]
Coming!

497
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:20,297
[KAGURA]
Excuse me.

498
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,632
Hello?

499
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,969
[KAGURA]
Um.

500
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,180
I'm sorry to bother you,
but is it true?

501
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:32,142
That Kyo is here?

502
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:06,528
[TOHRU]
"What year is she?"
