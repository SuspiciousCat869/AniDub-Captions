Sensei?

00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:19,728
I'm here to pick up
your manuscript!

3
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,232
If you'll just hand it over,
I'll be on my way!

4
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:27,319
Very funny. Pretending
you're not at home again.

5
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:28,820
Hello?

00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:32,991
Come on, you've had
your fun! Sensei!

[MITSURU] Please, Sensei!
I know you're in there!

9
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:41,458
Don't do this to me!

Hiya.

00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:53,804
[MITSURU] Sensei! Uh,
where are you right now?

13
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:56,390
[SHIGURE] I got the biggest
craving for <i>takoyaki</i>,

14
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,350
so I took a stroll
to Octopus Dude.

15
00:00:58,392 --> 00:00:59,601
Have you ever tried their food?

16

[MITSURU]
But today is your deadline!

[SHIGURE]
Is it really?

18
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:04,439
Totally slipped my mind.

Oh, no, you don't!

00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:12,447
You're hungry? Great!

22
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:13,782
Because I'm gonna
feed every last one

Whoops. I'm so sorry!

27
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:25,586
[RITSU] No, I'm the one
who should apologize

28
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:26,795
for walking in front
of your leap...

29
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:28,422
It's my fault. I'm
rushing because Sensei

30
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,716
cares more about downing
street food than his deadline!

31
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:31,633
He'll be the death of me.

32
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:33,343
But, sorry, that's
not your fault is it.

33
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:34,803
I must be going now.

00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:37,514
I'm coming for you,

[RITSU screams]

39
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:50,485
[RITSU] The bottom of my bag
broke. This is a disaster!

40
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:51,320
[TOHRU]
Here.

41
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,030
I'm more than happy
to give you a hand.

42
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:55,490
[RITSU] No, please, that's
far too much to ask of you.

43
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,575
Nonsense.

44
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:58,994
It's good to help each other
out when we face problems.

45
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:00,454
[RITSU]
Forgive me.

46
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,205
See, It doesn't
matter where I am;

47
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,916
I always cause problems
for the people around me.

48
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,669
I shouldn't be taking up
space, or using up oxygen.

49
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:09,087
Still, even though I feel bad,

50
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,757
I'm making you get on
the ground and help me.

51
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:15,510
I apologize. Not just to you,
but to the entire world!

52
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:18,430
Listen, all of
humanity, I'm sorry!

53
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:21,767
But until then, I'll apologize
to the entire world! I'm sorry!

54
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,393
Wait, are you Ritchan?

[screams]

56
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:28,815
Am I so horrible that even
strangers on the street

57
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,025
know what my name is?

58
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:31,943
Of course they do! My cursed
name must be infamous,

59
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,445
so everyone knows to avoid me.

00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:34,029
I've been living...

00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:35,322
No, I figured...

62
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:36,448
I apologize for...

63
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:40,369
Ah. Why are you here, Ritchan?

64
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,870
[RITSU]
Ah! I apologize!

65
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:42,788
Someone of my low worth

66
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,748
shouldn't have the
honor of visiting you.

67
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,627
I'm just so sorry!

68
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:24,181
[SHIGURE]
What a rare treat this is.

69
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,640
You're usually so timid.

70
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,726
Not the sort to drop
in out of the blue.

71
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,770
Oh! Yes, sorry for barging in.

72
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,855
And for causing Tohru
so much trouble

73
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:33,690
because I overloaded my bag.

74
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:35,734
No. I was happy to help!

75
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:38,028
And even happier to meet you.

76
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:43,200
[TOHRU] I was hoping I'd get to
meet Ritchan, the zodiac Monkey.

77
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:46,244
Who knew she'd end up
being such a pretty girl?

78
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,330
So, then, why the
impromptu visit?

79
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:51,500
No, this is terrible.
I must be intruding on you.

[SHIGURE]
Mh‐hm.

81

Sit down, it's a joke.

85
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:00,550
So, what's on your mind?

86
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:04,137
Well, you see, most of the
other members of the zodiac

87
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:07,057
had already met Tohru since
she started living here,

88
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,517
so I figured it would
be rude of me

89
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,353
if I didn't introduce
myself to her.

90
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,063
My name is Ritsu Soma.

91
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:15,190
You know my mother from
the hot spring you went to.

92
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:17,234
It's such a pleasure
to meet you.

93
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,027
No, the pleasure is all mine.

94
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,154
My name is Tohru Honda.

95
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:24,074
Ah. Right. It's not
nearly enough, but‐‐

96

Ooh, you brought a gift? Yay!

97
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:26,660
Yes.

98
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,370
But I didn't know what
fruit you would like,

99
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:31,373
so I got you some books
on fruit instead.

100
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,750
I hope you find them enjoyable.

101
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,254
Or not! I'm so sorry.

102
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,714
This must be a terrible
present‐‐absurdly rude.

103
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,050
Well, yeah. It kind of is.

[RITSU]
I'm the worst!

106
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,096
I'll go to the market
and get some real fruit.

[RITSU] I knew I shouldn't
have come here today.

109
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:53,353
Why am I making you put
up with my stupidity?

110
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:55,063
Don't be so hard on yourself.

111
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:56,398
Yes, he's right!

112
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,442
I'm excited to meet you,
Ritchan, so don't you worry!

113
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:02,404
The fact that you came to visit
me makes me truly happy.

114
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:06,157
I swear it! I'm delighted
that you're here.

[RITSU sniffs]

116
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:11,580
You're so kind. Thanks for that.

117
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:15,041
[TOHRU] Wow. She's even more
beautiful when she smiles.

118
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,168
[SHIGURE] I see you still
take after your mother.

119
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,170
The two of you panic so easily.

120
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,131
You're going to be
a working adult soon;

121
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,967
you can't constantly act
on edge in the real world.

122
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:26,177
I know. I apologize.

123
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,680
With that in mind,
maybe it'd be wise for you

124
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:29,973
to grow a little more backbone.

125
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:31,349
Yes, I hope to!

126
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,394
I want real confidence in
myself more than anything.

127
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:36,438
And maybe one day,

128
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,858
I'll be overflowing with
self‐assurance just like Aya is.

129
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,401
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

130
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,111
Yeah, that's not happening.

131
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,864
Huh, but why not?
Is it because I'm too weak?

132
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,198
Aya's the issue.

133
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,283
He has what you might call

134
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:51,286
a "superhuman level"
of belief in himself.

135
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:52,704
[RITSU]
Oh. I see.

136
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,080
Let's start small.

137
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,499
You must know you
apologize far too quickly.

138
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,293
Yes, you're right. Sorry.

139
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,045
[SHIGURE]
Point confirmed!

140
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,546
Here's an idea.

141
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:04,341
As the first big step
toward a new, better you,

142
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,134
you're banned from
reflexive apologies.

[gasps]

144
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,679
And, Tohru, cheer
Ritchan on, yes?

145
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:12,474
Uh. Sure, of course!

146
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:15,310
[RITSU] They're going through
all this trouble for my sake.

147
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,520
What kindhearted people.

148
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,940
Thank you. I will take
on this challenge!

149
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:20,857
[YUKI]
I'm home.

150
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:24,110
Ah. Well, talk about your
perfect timing, right?

151
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:27,280
Yuki will be the first
test you must pass.

152
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:29,449
But I need to prepare
myself emotionally.

153
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:32,118
Not true. You got this!

154
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,829
Hey. Ritsu, what're
you doing here?

155

[RITSU yells]

156
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,290
You're right! The likes of
me shouldn't be allowed

157
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:38,583
anywhere near your
home, should I?

158
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:39,584
I'm so sorry! This is totally...

159
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,086
[YUKI]
That's not what I meant.

160
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,879
Hey! Try it again!

161
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:43,964
[RITSU gasps]

162
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,884
[RITSU]
Y‐Yuki.

163
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:50,762
You're beginning to resemble
your older brother so much.

164
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:51,680
[YUKI]
We're done here.

165
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:54,724
[RITSU] Ah! Did I say something
to make you mad at me?

166
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,226
Not at all.

167
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:59,437
[RITSU]
No! I'm so sorry!

168
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,481
Ah. Here comes Kyo.

169
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:03,900
Ritchan, pull yourself
together and try again.

170
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:04,609
[RITSU]
Huh?

171
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:07,487
[KYO] Huh? What're
you doing here, Ritsu?

172
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:08,822
Uh! You're right.

173
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:09,906
The likes of me
shouldn't be allowed

174
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:12,450
anywhere near your home,
should I? I'm so‐‐

175
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,453
I came to introduce
myself to Tohru.

176
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,663
[KYO]
Huh?

177
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:19,582
[RITSU] By the way, I wanted
to say I'm happy for you.

178
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:20,583
Why?

179
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,086
You and Yuki are living
under the same roof now.

180
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:24,713
I bet you're becoming
good friends.

181
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,131
[BOTH]
Like hell we are!

182
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,173
[RITSU yelps]

183
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,634
I couldn't be sorrier!

184
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,928
I take it back!
You hate each other!

185
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,472
I knew someone as worthless as
me shouldn't be visiting here!

186
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,142
I'll be taking my leave!
I apologize for staying so long.

187
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,394
For ever showing up!
For ever being born!

188
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,187
Thank you for putting up
with such a worthless person

189
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,772
for as long as you managed to.

190
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:44,733
I'm leaving now and
I'll never return.

191
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,943
I'm sorry!

192
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,278
No, please stay!

193
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,072
[ALL grunt]

194
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:53,992
[TOHRU]
Huh?

195
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:57,620
Wait, I don't understand
this. Aren't you a girl?

196
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:01,041
And I thought only males
in the zodiac transformed

197
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,251
when I hugged them.

198
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:06,963
Uh. But you... What's happening?

199
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:12,343
I... I'm so sorry!

200
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,683
[SHIGURE]
So, here's the deal, Tohru.

201
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,727
Ritchan is actually male.

202
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:21,686
Be that as it may,

203
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,981
he's worn girls' clothes
since he was quite young.

204
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:26,900
That makes a lot more sense.

205
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,652
But why wear girls' clothes?

206
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:33,531
Something about them
makes me feel secure.

207
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,533
In the beginning, I just
wanted to try them on

208
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,994
to see what they'd be like.

209
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:42,665
Then, once I realized I was
far more at peace in them...

210
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,251
...I couldn't dream of stopping.

211
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:48,129
[RITSU] Kagura‐<i>chan</i>,
could I have this dress?

212
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:51,800
[KAGURA] Huh? What,
you mean like to wear?

213
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:55,804
I'm sorry. I'm so
embarrassed of myself.

214
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,305
No, please, you shouldn't be!

215
00:09:57,347 --> 00:10:00,141
The clothes really suit you.
You're gorgeous!

216
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:01,559
[SHIGURE]
I think you may be missing

217
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,728
the bigger picture on this one.

218
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,523
[YUKI] Thing is, you'll
be working soon, Ritsu.

219
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,149
Will you wear
girls' clothes then?

220
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,235
I don't know. What if I can't?

221
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,112
Uhh...

222
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,072
[RITSU cries]

223
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,698
[SHIGURE]
Hey, here's an idea.

224
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,033
Why don't you three
get comfortable

225
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:19,619
and ditch your school uniforms?

226
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,454
[YUKI]
Mh‐hm. That does sound good.

227
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:23,665
Please excuse me for a moment.

228
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:29,420
[RITSU]
I have to apologize to you.

229
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,839
[SHIGURE]
Huh?

230
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,175
I agreed to take you up
on your challenge earlier

231
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:36,136
but then immediately failed.

232
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,096
[MITSURU]
Octo‐<i>sensei</i>!

233
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,305
Were you expecting someone?

234
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:42,058
Uh! Quickly! Go close the door!

235
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,059
Do it!

236
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:45,186
Uh, right. Sure.

237
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:48,773
[MITSURU]
Listen, you coward!

238
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,191
Sensei, I know you're in there.

239
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:52,360
Don't make me break
down this door!

240
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:55,280
You can't hide from me
forever! Why can...

241
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,199
Um, so, do you know the woman
trying to break into your home?

242
00:10:58,241 --> 00:10:59,450
[SHIGURE]
Hmm.

243
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,370
Yes, I do. She's what
you'd call a stalker.

244
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,414
What? Really?

245
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:08,585
She figured out where I live,
and now I live my life in fear.

246
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:12,297
How fortuitous, though!
Fate offers you a new challenge.

247
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,131
Huh?

248
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,132
[SHIGURE]
Ritchan!

249
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:17,177
Assert yourself by sending
this obsessed fan away.

250
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:20,096
If you can get rid of my
stalker all by yourself,

251
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:24,225
well, then, it will be proof of
your improved self‐assurance!

00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:26,394
Are you sure?

253
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:27,812
Then I'll do it.

254
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,606
I will find my inner strength!

255
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,107
Okay, great.

257
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,864
Hello?

That pervert! He's been holed up
inside with some girlfriend!

264
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,257
[RITSU]
No, you've got it all wrong.

265
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,176
I'm related to Shigure!
I'm not his girlfriend!

266
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,803
Ha! You think I'd believe
a bold‐faced lie like that?

267
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,096
[RITSU]
It's the truth, honest!

268
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,224
Stop hiding behind your lover!

You've done it, right?
Tell me it's complete!

finished with his draft.

Please, Father, Mother,

If the manuscript
isn't finished yet,

there's no way
I can go on living.

Alas, maybe I'll have a copy
of the draft in the afterlife.

Do you really need to ask?

Are you done? Is it ready?

317
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,720
[RITSU] That manuscript was
more precious to Mitchan

318
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:09,307
than her own life, and I
destroyed it in front of her.

319
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:13,102
Only through death may I attempt
to atone for what I've done.

320
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:14,604
[TOHRU yelping]

321
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,606
Miss Honda, please calm down.

322
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:19,025
[RITSU] Furthermore,
I've disappointed everyone,

323
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:21,402
despite the many chances
they've given me.

324
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:24,238
I'm not worthy of
any more kindness.

325
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,616
Gods, what purpose
do I have for living

326
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,659
if all I do is ruin things?

327
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,287
How can I not be
a burden to others?

328
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:33,706
Well, you could start by
climbing down from the roof.

329
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:35,166
Please! Listen!

330
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:38,878
None of us are upset with you.
You have to come down.

331
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,381
No. You don't understand me.

332
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:43,800
I've always been this way.

333
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,802
Having a zodiac
spirit for a child

334
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,846
causes people enough trouble.

335
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:52,683
But on top of that,
I ended up being a crybaby.

336
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:56,229
A clumsy coward.

337
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:01,150
My parents were always having
to apologize on my behalf.

338
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:03,903
[RITSU]
I'm sorry. So sorry.

339
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:05,696
Mom and Dad, you must hate

340
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,491
always having to
apologize for me.

341
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:10,660
You probably wanted
a normal child

342
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:13,204
who could play
without you worrying.

343
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,500
[RITSU]
I think, maybe a person like me

344
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,752
should just give up on life.

345
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:21,879
There's no reason not to.

346
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,882
Maybe everyone would
be better without me.

347
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:28,553
And yet, I don't even have
the courage to end things.

348
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:31,931
I stand here a failure
in every possible sense.

349
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:34,016
Still, I have the
nerve to stay alive.

350
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,477
[TOHRU] But that's what
takes real courage.

351
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,773
‐‐Miss Honda!
‐‐When'd she get up there?

352
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:43,734
What's wrong with having
the nerve to live?

353
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:47,113
Isn't... Isn't that what
makes us human?

354
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:48,906
Sure, sometimes we get lost.

355
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,033
We cry, or worry,
or we're afraid,

356
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,119
but we feel joy, too!

357
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:56,414
[RITSU] What's the point
in the end, though?

358
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,332
When I look at my life,

359
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:01,544
I can't find a single reason
for me to have ever been born.

360
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:05,047
[TOHRU] Maybe the point of
living is to find that reason.

361
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,549
Somewhere deep down,

362
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:10,887
I know you must be desperately
looking for your life's purpose.

363
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:15,808
You might not realize it...
but your heart is searching.

364
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,353
[KYOKO] Oh, Tohru.
I'm so glad I had you.

365
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,314
Now I'm happy every day,

366
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:25,109
because you're here
with me, making me smile.

367
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,445
[TOHRU] Then, I guess the
whole reason I was born

368
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,448
was so I could make
you happy, Mommy!

369
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,616
[KYOKO chuckles]

370
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,619
[KYOKO] If that's true,
I won't question it.

371
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:39,332
[TOHRU]
I think that none of us are born

372
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,000
with some predetermined reason

373
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:43,794
to be alive in this
world, Ritchan.

374
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,505
Because your reason
for living is something

375
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:49,550
you need to decide or
discover for yourself.

376
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:50,885
[gasps]

377
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,055
Be careful!

378
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,806
[RITSU]
Oh, no, Tohru!

379
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:01,229
[TOHRU] And I think...
everyone is different.

380
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,189
Maybe you'll find
meaning in a dream,

381
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:06,025
or a job that you really
love, or maybe...

382
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:10,905
...maybe your reason
is another person!

383
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:15,034
Sometimes your purpose might
feel uncertain or unstable.

384
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:17,286
You might even lose your reason.

385
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:20,498
But as long as you're alive,
and you wanna keep looking,

386
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,458
you'll find another one.

387
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:25,336
[TOHRU]
I get it now.

388
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:28,005
I'm looking for the
same thing myself.

389
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:33,553
And my big hope is...
that it's a person.

390
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,765
[TOHRU]
Or, rather, people.

391
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:41,727
I wanna live for
the sake of others.

392
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,522
That's why, I think it's okay

393
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:48,568
to have that nerve
to keep on living.

394
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:51,571
Because if you have
the nerve to live,

395
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,281
you might meet that
special person

396
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:56,033
who's your reason
to embrace life.

397
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:59,495
The one who wants you
to be their reason, too.

398
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,625
[RITSU]
I wonder if someone like me

399
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:07,753
will find what you're
talking about.

400
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,047
I hope I do one day.

401
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:15,761
[RITSU]
And, yes, I agree with you.

402
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:20,558
It'd be nice if I could
live... for someone else.

403
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,407
‐‐She's awake!
‐‐Um, are you okay?

404
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:37,491
Where's the draft?

405
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,869
[SHIGURE]
Rewriting at this very moment.

406
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,954
Sensei, thank you!

407
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:44,248
But I won't be finished
for another hour or so.

408
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,916
How 'bout some <i>takoyaki</i>?

409
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,960
I'm on it!

410
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:51,297
It's dark outside. Why don't
you escort her, Ritchan?

411
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,799
Huh? Oh, okay.

412
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,469
[BOTH]
Uh.

413
00:18:57,762 --> 00:18:59,764
[COOK A]
Hope you enjoy!

414
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:03,059
[RITSU] Again, I'm really
sorry about messing up

415
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,227
those pages earlier.

416
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,563
No, I should be
apologizing to you.

417
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:11,108
I acted like a fool in front
of someone I'd just met.

418
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,736
Still, that man has no
right to call me a stalker,

419
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,571
even if he was joking.

420
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:17,531
Does he always act that way?

421
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:18,616
That was nothing.

422
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,951
He's constantly teasing
me to amuse himself,

423
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,620
ignoring deadlines
and disappearing

424
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:24,372
whenever I need him.

425
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:27,375
My, sounds terrible.

426
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:31,587
[MITSURU] Honestly, I'm not
sure I'm cut out for this job.

427
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:33,589
I panic too easily.

428
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:36,133
When that happens,
I can't think rationally,

429
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,303
so I end up causing
trouble for other people.

430
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:40,137
[MITSURU sighs]

431
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,140
That might be the part
of myself I hate most.

432
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:47,269
I know the feeling.

433
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,271
I've always been a disaster.

434
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:53,567
Ever since I was a child,
it has defined who I am.

435
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:56,487
I think that might
be the reason why...

436
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:59,573
...I've never had any
confidence in myself.

437
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:03,494
I don't know why I was born,
so I've felt useless.

438
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:12,753
But, despite that... I have the
audacity to continue living.

439
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:16,382
Because... it's possible
that someday,

440
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:21,846
even a mess of a person like me
will find the reason I'm alive.

441
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,473
It might even be
for someone else.

442
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,559
Someone who needs me.

443
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:28,561
[RITSU]
Just so you know,

444
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:31,897
I'm repeating another person's
words, they're not mine.

445
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:36,777
I don't care who it is that
said it in the first place.

446
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:39,697
Hearing it makes me feel
like I can keep going!

447
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:42,366
[RITSU]
We should probably head back

448
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:45,035
before the <i>takoyaki</i> gets cold
and we have to grab some more.

449
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,912
[MITSURU]
Okay!

450
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,124
So good.

451
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,793
[MITSURU] So, about that
manuscript, is it done?

452
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:54,336
Here, Tohru, open wide.

453
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:57,089
I need you to eat faster!
Shovel that octopus down!

454
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:58,966
Please, use these
delicious treats as fuel

455
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:00,801
to power your rewrites for her!

456
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:01,844
Take those words to heart

457
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:03,596
and become a <i>takoyaki</i>‐fueled
writing machine!

458
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,848
[SHIGURE]
Didn't I mention? It's finished.

459
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,767
Don't worry, you can
thank me later.

460
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:11,312
Sensei, you angel.
I'm so grateful. Thanks.

461
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:13,689
Aw, I'm so happy
for you, Mitchan!

462
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:16,942
Thank you, too. I'm really
glad we talked earlier.

463
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,235
No, don't thank me.

464
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:21,197
This was all my fault
to begin with.

465
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:24,408
Say, if it's okay with you,

466
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,203
I was wondering if you might
want to be my friend.

467
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:31,373
Uh. But are you positive you
want to be friends with me?

468
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,958
Oh, yes. Please!

469
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,211
Maybe you could teach
me to dress better.

470
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:37,546
I'd love to learn how to
put on a kimono properly

471
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:38,506
and be more feminine, like you.

472
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:39,799
[SHIGURE]
Oh, I should clarify.

473
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,508
Huh?

474
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,802
Ritchan's actually a boy.

475
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,136
Huh?

476
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,682
Ah! I'm so sorry!
I shouldn't have jumped...

477
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,935
It's my fault! I apologize
for my confusing attire...

478
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,895
No, no, it's just that
you're so beautiful,

479
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:54,772
I couldn't help but
assume with envy.

480
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,649
[RITSU]
Beautiful? You're so kind!

481
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,567
I'm sorry I made you
feel the need...

482
00:21:58,609 --> 00:21:59,318
[YUKI sighs]

483
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,444
Will this ever end?

484
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:02,112
[KYO]
So stupid.

485
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,072
I can't do much well,

486
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,990
but I'll happily show you
how to wear a kimono.

487
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,283
No problem!

488
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,910
I look forward to it!

489
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:09,453
It'll be a lot of fun.

490
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:11,789
[RITSU] Oh! Yes!
I'm excited about it, too!

491
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:13,624
Honestly, I swear it.

492
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:18,629
[RITSU] I hope one day I can
look at someone and say,

493
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:21,507
"I was born for your sake."

494
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:25,135
[MITSURU] I hope I can tell
someone, "You're my reason."

495
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:28,973
And I hope whoever I
say those words to...

496
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,267
[RITSU, MITSURU]
...wants to say them back.

497
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:06,612
[HIRO] "I can't believe
you picked it up."
