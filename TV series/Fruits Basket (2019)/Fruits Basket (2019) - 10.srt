I'm so glad you like it!

Just one more way
you've changed things.

it was just me and Yuki.

Hm? Hello, Kyo. Good morning!

Hey, come and eat.

[YUKI] Better hurry,
or it'll all be gone.

00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,840
Um, don't you want breakfast?

10
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,259
Not hungry.

That's a let‐down.

I figured that
the prince's locker

Chocolates.

I believe I know what happened.

26

What we have here
is a clear case

27
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:52,047
of the cuckoo phenomenon.

28
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:54,800
Just as a cuckoo chick will
take over a shrike's nest

and dump out its eggs,

each girl has tossed away the
previous girl's chocolates

31

in order to draw
attention to her own.

Man, that's low, even
for those cuckoos.

And I will be the hawk

the final sugary offering.

some of his chocolates, though?

It's February 13th.

me something.

He said that you and Yuki are
starting to get along better.

get to know each other,

I hope he's right.
That would make me happy.

163
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,192
Well, bye!

164
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:09,364
[SHIGURE] Haru's surprisingly
wise sometimes.

165
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:10,657
Come, now.

166
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:13,660
Would it kill you boys to
meet each other halfway?

167
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,870
And what do you know about it?

168
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:20,000
Stop talking like we're supposed
to be friends or something.

169
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:23,545
Get to know him?
Don't make me puke!

170
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,755
I hate his guts,
and I always will.

171
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:28,425
All of you should
just accept that!

172
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,179
[SHIGURE] You know,
it almost sounds like

173
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,098
you feel obligated to hate him.

174
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,850
[grunts]

175
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,435
[SHIGURE]
What's wrong?

176
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,061
Are you scared of
what might happen

177
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:42,480
if you actually got to know him?

178
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,904
Kyo, wait!

179
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,532
Please! Come back to the house!

180
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,495
[YUKI]
Something happen? What's wrong?

181
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:01,374
Me. I may have been a bit
impatient with Kyo.

182
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,084
Pushed him too far.

183
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,842
Kyo? Where are you?

184
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,886
C‐Can you hear me?

185
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:17,348
[TOHRU] Back there, he really
did look like he was scared.

186
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,777
Kyo. Are you‐‐?

187
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:29,819
[gasps]

188
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,198
[TOHRU]
His hatred.

189
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:36,201
He's using it to
protect something.

190
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,329
But what? Himself?

191
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,915
[KYO]
Forget it.

192
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:45,335
What happened back
there... forget it.

193
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,754
It has nothing to do with you.

194
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,130
Let it go.

195
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:58,640
It's okay if you don't
like him. Really.

196
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:03,603
I mean, I've been hoping you
two could learn to get along.

197
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:06,731
But... it's fine if you can't.

198
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:09,234
It's fine if you hate him.

199
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,069
It really is.

200
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:15,365
[TOHRU]
I can see it, plain as day.

201
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:18,076
You have a plum right
there on your back.

202
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:22,247
Soma's great, but the
thing is, so are you.

203
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,587
[KYO]
I don't wanna see.

204
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,507
I don't wanna think
about anything.

205
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,008
Not yet.

206
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,179
[TOHRU] Kyo's heart is
so much more delicate

207
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:40,932
than he wants people to know.

208
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,351
And so is Yuki's.

209
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:46,354
A single touch
might bruise them.

210
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:52,735
[TOHRU] So, I know we
have plans tomorrow,

211
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:56,239
but it's okay if
you'd rather not go.

212
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,491
I guess I can live with it.

213
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,785
It's just one day.

214
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,537
If you're sure.

215
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,669
[TOHRU grunts]

216
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:12,255
Ow. What did you do that for?

217
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:15,717
No reason, really.
Let's just get back.

218
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:21,681
[TOHRU] The pain they
hold inside, the fear...

219
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:27,145
Someday, I hope I can
help wipe it all away.

220
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,938
That's what they did for me.

221
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:33,818
And more than anything,
I want them to be happy, too.

222
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,289
[SHIGURE]
I dreamed about the one I love.

223
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:53,171
[SHIGURE] And that was that.
It was all over for me.

224
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:57,926
[phone beeps]

225
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,220
[MITSURU] Sensei, I'm
heading over there now,

226
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,804
so please drop everything

227
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,349
and get that manuscript
ready to go!

228
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,851
Cute. And the "please"
was a nice touch.

229
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,937
[YUKI]
Shigure?

230
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,647
I'm not sure how long we'll be.

231
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:13,483
Go! You kids enjoy yourselves.

232
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:16,069
What fun! Who doesn't
love a double date?

233
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,238
Oh, one more thing, Yuki.

234
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,322
What is it?

235
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:23,284
Don't be a cheapskate.
No splitting the bill, okay?

236
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:25,203
Wasn't planning on it.

237
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,998
And you be a proper
escort for sweet Kagura.

238
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,375
This is so stupid.

239
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,168
Um, sorry.

240
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,004
Are you sure you don't mind
going over to the main estate?

241
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:38,174
I can probably just deliver
the chocolates myself later.

242
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:41,010
Worry not. I wasn't
planning to eat them.

243
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:42,845
Oh, no, that's not
what I meant!

244
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:43,930
You just seem really
busy with work‐‐

245
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:46,224
[YUKI]
No, it's fine.

246
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:49,477
He'll do it. You just
stay away from the estate.

247
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,312
But, well...

248
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:54,274
[SHIGURE] Little does he know
she's already been there.

249
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:57,527
No. Yuki's right.
I'll handle it.

250
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:02,615
You just leave the chocolates
to me. Enjoy your date.

251
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,286
Okay!

252
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,622
[KYO]
Hey! If we're going, let's go!

253
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:11,124
[TOHRU]
Right. Coming!

254
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,584
Thanks a lot! We'll see
you when we get back!

255
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:14,669
[phone ringing]

256
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:15,795
[SHIGURE]
Sure.

257
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:17,922
[phone ringing]

258
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,924
Now, get out of here.

259
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,510
[ANSWERING MACHINE]
We're sorry.

260
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:24,554
No one is available
to take your call.

261
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,389
Please leave a message
after the beep.

262
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:27,390
[phone beeps]

263
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:28,224
[MITSURU]
Sensei!

264
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:31,144
Listen, I know you're screening
my calls, and that's fine,

265
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,229
but don't you dare run
off before I get there!

266
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:34,814
[static]

267
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:37,942
[SHIGURE]
Hmm. Interesting.

268
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:41,195
So that's what she
expects from me.

269
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:44,699
It would be such a shame
to disappoint her.

270
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,367
[KAGURA]
Kyo!

271
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,619
I was so excited
thinking about today!

272
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,663
I hardly got any sleep at all!

273
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:51,914
[KYO]
Oh, yeah?

274
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:52,915
Well, in that case, maybe you...

275
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,752
[YUKI]
Is something wrong, Miss Honda?

276
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,338
Well, it's just, no
matter what happens,

277
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,340
Shigure is always smiling.

278
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,883
So I have a difficult
time telling

279
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:05,219
whether or not I'm
causing trouble for him.

280
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:08,264
[YUKI] Not many people know
what's going on inside his head.

281
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:11,434
He's a mystery to most
everyone but Hatori.

282
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,186
You know, it's funny.

283
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:18,024
Somebody said, "He's like
a ripple on the water.

284
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:21,402
A wave that approaches,
then recedes.

285
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:25,031
It tickles your feet, but when
you reach down to touch it,

286
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:26,449
it leaves.

287
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:29,494
He's the kind of man you
can never quite catch."

288
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,080
I always thought that
analogy was too pretty.

289
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:35,833
If you ask me, he's the
jellyfish waiting to sting you.

290
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,335
[TOHRU chuckles]

291
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,504
[KAGURA]
Yun‐<i>chan</i>! Tohru!

292
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,130
We're going to miss the
beginning of the movie

293
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,590
if we don't hurry.

294
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:44,258
Oh! Right!

295
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:47,762
Valentine's!

296
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:50,848
He may be smiling
on the outside,

297
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,266
but who knows what
kind of things

298
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,394
he's plotting on the inside...

299
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,814
[SHIGURE]
Special delivery!

300
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:00,566
Valentine's chocolates
from yours truly.

301
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,071
Okay, you're right. I lied.

302
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:07,240
They're really from Tohru.

303
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,533
[HATORI]
Idiot.

304
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,286
[HATORI]
She's a thoughtful girl.

305
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,913
[SHIGURE]
That's an understatement.

306
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:16,958
She sent some along for
Momiji and Haru, too.

307
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:20,169
She was going to bring them over
here herself, but I volunteered.

308
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:22,046
And do you want to know why?

309
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:25,716
Because she, Yuki, Kyo, and
Kagura are all going out

310
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,718
on a double date together!

311
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,429
That's certainly unexpected.

312
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,680
[SHIGURE]
Isn't it?

313
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,682
Must be Tohru's influence.

314
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:36,018
That young lady has worked
a Valentine's miracle.

315
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:40,231
They're probably snuggled up,
watching a movie as we speak.

316
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:41,732
[ART]
Mogeta, no!

317
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,444
The evil creature can't
get its hands on you!

318
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,779
Stop, Art. It's too
late to save him!

319
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:48,781
Wait, look! The Mogeta!

320
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:51,075
This is all wrong!
What's happening here‐‐?

321
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:54,954
[MOGETA]
Mogeta!

322
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:55,955
[ART]
Mogeta!

323
00:15:55,997 --> 00:16:00,376
[HEROINE A] Don't do it, Artemis
Donpanina Taios, aka "Art"!

324
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,628
[MOGETA]
Mogeta!

325
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:06,966
Mogeta!

326
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:09,719
[HATORI] I can imagine
her influencing them.

327
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,973
She has the most uncanny way
of softening anyone she meets.

328
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:15,391
[SHIGURE]
I have a confession.

329
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:18,728
I maybe‐kinda‐sorta
picked on Kyo yesterday.

330
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,813
He got a bit agitated
and ran off.

331
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:22,356
Don't wind him up.

332
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:25,401
But then, Tohru went after
him and brought him back,

333
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:27,445
and he seemed almost normal.

334
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,530
She has some sort of
tranquilizing effect

335
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,115
on those two.

336
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,618
[HATORI]
You certainly look satisfied.

337
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,370
Things are going exactly
as you planned them.

338
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,873
Why do I detect a note
of criticism in your voice

339
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:40,041
when you say that?

340
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:44,295
[HATORI] Like hell you're not
using her, you shameless liar.

341
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:45,922
You and Akito both.

342
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:49,759
She's a pawn you two are using
in some kind of elaborate game.

343
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,553
Don't even think about
pretending otherwise.

344
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,809
Do you remember that
morning? The dream?

345
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:05,024
We all woke from it
crying. You, me, Aya...

346
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:09,820
For you two, it became something
twisted and painful.

347
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:15,535
But for me, those feelings
still linger, unfaded.

348
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:21,457
That affection... that passion,
so thrillingly sweet and sad.

349
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,961
[SHIGURE]
I don't want it to end.

350
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,380
I want it to last forever.

351
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:30,550
I want to give it form
and make it mine.

352
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,093
I will.

353
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:37,473
All these years, and that
vow is still right here.

354
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:41,894
If I have to lie, or manipulate
a few people along the way,

355
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:44,313
then so be it.

356
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:47,858
It's a small price to pay,
even if someone gets hurt.

357
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,028
[sighs]

358
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,739
[SHIGURE] I do feel bad
about it sometimes, though.

359
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:58,619
Mostly, it's when I'm
looking at Tohru.

360
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:01,998
She's just good,
through and through.

361
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,292
She helps for those two,

362
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,211
but her innocence may
be a bit much for me.

363
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:10,047
Sometimes she forces
me to realize

364
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:14,468
that mine might be the
filthiest soul of all.

365
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:18,139
Granted, I am as
dirty as they come.

366
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:25,146
It's funny, but sometimes I find
myself feeling jealous of you.

367
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:28,858
And I wonder if maybe I'm
the most cursed of us.

368
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,319
[door opens]

369
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,445
[MAIDSERVANT A]
Pardon me.

370
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:35,072
Doctor, it's time for
Akito's checkup.

371
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,073
Ooo, I know!

372
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:40,244
Why don't I fill in for you?
I promise I'll be very thorough.

373
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,246
[HATORI]
Saw that one coming.

374
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,751
[HATORI] Tell Honda I said
thank you for the chocolates

375
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:47,710
when you get home.

376
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:49,378
Sure, sure.

377
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:54,342
[HATORI] Whatever outcome
you're aiming for...

378
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:57,303
...you had better be
prepared to lose a tooth.

379
00:18:57,345 --> 00:19:00,806
Yuki or Kyo. Maybe even Honda.

380
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,767
One of them is bound
to punch you in the face

381
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,644
before this all plays out.

382
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:07,355
Yes, well, that may be.

383
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:10,232
I don't care for pain,
but I'll take it.

384
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:13,819
[HATORI] You should know,
I won't be your ally in this.

385
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:17,239
But I won't work
against you, either.

386
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:21,410
Right, then. Goodbye.

387
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:24,330
[HATORI] Shigure.
Don't let Akito catch cold.

388
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:26,123
[SHIGURE chuckles]

389
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,755
[HATORI]
You're not the only one.

390
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:35,966
My hands are dirty, as well.

391
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,927
[SHIGURE]
They can have a few teeth.

392
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,096
Bones, if they want them.

393
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,933
[SHIGURE]
That's not what I care about.

394
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,187
[SHIGURE]
Akito.

395
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,817
Shigure. Why are you here?

396
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:57,530
I came to visit. I've been
wanting to see you.

397
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:03,202
[AKITO]
Well, that isn't surprising.

398
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:05,037
[SHIGURE]
Of course it's not.

399
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:09,959
Since I care about
you most of all.

400
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,588
[SHIGURE]
I will get what I want.

401
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:19,510
No matter what lies I have
to tell, or who I have to use,

402
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:22,888
I'll make that dream eternal.

403
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,267
[TOHRU]
Ah. That was really touching!

404
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,144
[KAGURA]
With so many moving scenes!

405
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:31,188
Especially that one with
Mogeta and the true emperor!

406
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,982
That was my favorite one, too!

407
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,233
Glad you liked it.

408
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:36,026
So the date's over, right?

409
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:39,113
Now, now. I know you don't
really mean that, Kyo.

410
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:40,781
Such a shy boy.

[TOHRU]
Excuse me.

415
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:54,754
Can we help you with something?

416
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:57,965
No. Nothing matters now.

417
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:01,719
It's over. I'm ready to end
my worthless existence!

418
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:02,178
[TOHRU]
What?

419
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,138
If you have to die,
could you maybe not do it

420
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,473
right in front of my house?

[SHIGURE]
This is my editor, Mitsuru.

424
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:15,399
Why did you do it? You jerk!

425
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:16,609
I asked you not to run off,

426
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,778
and then you went
and did it anyway!

427
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:21,781
That wasn't running off.
I went out for a bit, is all.

Okay.

By the way, Hatori
sends his thanks.

[TOHRU]
Oh! I'm glad!

434
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:36,545
I was worried he'd
think it was weird.

435
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:38,798
So, do I get some?

436
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,925
I'm actually making
them right now.

437
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,469
I want them to be
perfect for you.

Why aren't you writing?!

Fine, fine.

442
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,693
to take your work
more seriously?

443
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,737
Don't you care about it?

444
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:02,947
[SHIGURE]
My work?

445
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:06,909
Not that much, really.
Certainly not more than myself.

446
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:10,663
[MITSURU] Then think about
how much happier you'll be

when your manuscript is done
and I leave you alone!

Okay, okay.

I'll follow you to the ends
of the earth if I have to!

Now that's a scary prospect.
