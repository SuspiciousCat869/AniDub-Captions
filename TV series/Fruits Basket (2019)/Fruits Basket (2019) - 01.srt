forgotten by everyone.

Wow!

I still have plenty of time
before I need to get to class,

Hello.

This is a surprise.

Uh, good morning,
sir! I'm so sorry!

I shouldn't have been looking
around without permission.

It's fine.

34
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,055
I just wouldn't imagine that
a teenager like yourself

35
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,681
would find this
place interesting.

No, I really do, though!

37
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:24,936
Especially these zodiac
figurines you've got. Adorable.

38
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:28,273
[SHIGURE] Yes. They're a
favorite of mine, too, actually.

set without the Cat.

The Cat?

00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,988
Oh, right. I see.

42
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,783
You're thinking about the old
zodiac folktale, aren't you?

00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,284
Uh‐huh!

44
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:42,913
My mom would tell it to me over
and over when I was little.

[KYOKO]
Once upon a time,

46
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,172
God made an invitation
to the animals.

47
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:54,591
God said, "I'm having
a banquet tomorrow

48
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:57,302
and all of you are
invited to come."

49
00:02:57,344 --> 00:03:00,305
But the Rat was mischievous
and loved to play pranks.

50
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,474
He lied to his
neighbor, the Cat,

51
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:07,562
telling him the banquet was
actually the day after tomorrow.

52
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:11,358
On the day of the banquet,
the Rat rode on the Ox's back,

53
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,986
then leapt easily down to arrive
first at their destination.

54
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,406
After him came
the Ox, the Tiger,

55
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,824
and the rest of the animals,

56
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,535
and they all feasted
merrily until dawn.

57
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:24,663
All of them, that is,
except the Cat.

58
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:28,667
Tohru, why the heck
are you crying?

59
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,211
The poor Cat! How sad!

60
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:33,338
Okay! That's it!

61
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,425
From now on,
I'm a Cat, not a Dog!

62
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,431
Ah.

63
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,851
If he heard that little story,
I wonder how he'd feel.

64
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:46,685
Um, pardon?

65
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,937
So, then, Year of the Dog?

66
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:51,523
That makes me feel so much
closer to you already.

67

After all, I'm a Do‐‐

We in the "Prince Yuki

to worshiping the prince
who has graced our school

Yuki Soma.

He's only a first‐year,

he's already like the
prince of our school.

If that were a good
enough excuse,

Hm?

There's something
about his waves

that I find rather strange.

Another installment of
Hanajima's Wave Report.

Strange in what way?

00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,849
That's the thing.
I'm not quite sure.

145

[UOTANI] He does kinda give
off a mysterious vibe.

her love to him a while back

[TEACHER A]
All right, you three.

153

Your hands should be moving,
not your mouths. Uh?

00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,494
You're done?

155
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,413
Yeah, it's not like
it's rocket science.

Anyway, Tohru,

161
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:04,174
Hanajima and I are going
shopping after school today.

162
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,175
You wanna come?

163
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,552
Sorry, I would,
but I have to work.

164
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,095
Man, you got a raw deal.

165
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,639
Having to work yourself
half to death

166
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,432
'cause you promised to
pay your own tuition.

167
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:14,684
Still, you work almost daily.

168
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:18,271
That's kind of a lot just for
tuition, don't you think so?

169
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:19,481
Here, extra‐large.

170
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:20,273
[UOTANI]
Oh, boy.

171
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,567
[TOHRU] Oh, I'd like to live
by myself after I graduate,

172
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,235
and housing can be expensive.

173
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,655
So that means I have
to start saving up now!

174
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:27,989
I don't wanna get all weepy,

175
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,824
so start eating and
build up your strength!

176
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:30,825
Yes, ma'am.

177
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,119
You're offering like you're
the one who cooked the food.

178
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:33,787
For now though,

179
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:36,665
you're still staying at your
grandpa's place, aren't you?

180
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:37,499
Yeah!

181
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,210
The old geezer had better be
feeding you well, at least.

182
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:43,838
And not squeezing all your
wages out of you, either.

183
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,590
Exceptional.

184
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:46,883
[TOHRU]
I can't tell her.

185
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,594
If Uo knew I was
living in a tent,

186
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:50,971
she might drive her motorcycle

187
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,472
straight into my
grandfather's house

188
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:54,975
and start demanding answers.

189
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,107
[gasps]

190
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:05,485
[TOHRU] Soma! Thank
you for this morning!

191
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:06,903
It's quite all right.

192
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:09,030
I should be apologizing
for Shigure.

193
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,740
[TOHRU]
Oh, no, not at all!

194
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,909
He's a very nice person.

195
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:16,413
And he even let me look at
his cute zodiac figurines.

196
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:17,706
That's right.

197
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,709
I believe you were saying
something about being a Cat?

198
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:25,547
Yeah, I was kind of a
strange little kid. Sorry.

199
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:26,881
[YUKI]
The Cat is an idiot.

200
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,633
[TOHRU]
Huh?

201
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,135
[YUKI]
Stubborn, too.

202
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,178
[TOHRU]
Hm?

203
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,639
[YUKI] Did you know the
zodiac animals actually began

204
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:37,017
as part of a system
for telling time?

205
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,561
They were first used
as clock divisions.

206
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:42,856
Later, yin and yang and
elemental relationships

207
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:47,402
were folded in, and they
became fortune‐telling tools.

208
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:50,238
The truth is, the math
never left any room

209
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,159
for the Cat to begin with.

210
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:59,372
But honestly, I think that's
for the best, anyway.

211
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:02,208
I mean, being allowed
to join the zodiac?

212
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,419
What's so great about that?

213
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:06,046
Better to be alone.

214
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,173
Stupid Cat.

215
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:11,176
Sorry, but I don't
really understand.

216
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,429
Are you trying to
say you hate cats?

217
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:15,847
[TOHRU gasps]

219
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,529
Oh, no, I'm sorry! I have to
hurry up and get to work!

220
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,322
[YUKI]
Miss Honda?

221
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,823
Uh, yes?

222
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,912
There hasn't been much
color in your face today.

223
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,790
And it's still so hot.

224
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:45,001
You should be careful not
to push yourself too hard.

225
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,687
[TOHRU]
When I was three years old,

226
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,232
my dad got sick and died.

227
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:10,902
After that, Mom worked
super hard to support us.

228
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,321
And I helped out
whenever I could.

229
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:20,078
Sweet Tohru! Your mama is
hungry for <i>sukiyaki</i> today!

230
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,038
<i>Sukiyaki</i>!

231
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,707
[TOHRU] Mom was always
there to protect me.

232
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:28,378
She was so strong. So cheerful.

233
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,296
I never thought
someone like her...

234
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,590
[tires screeching]

235
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:38,721
[TOHRU] ...would die in an
accident like that, so suddenly.

236
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,516
Everyone argued about
who should take me in.

237
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:44,894
But in the end, my grandpa
was the one to do it.

238
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:46,479
Dinner's ready, Grandpa.

239
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:48,189
[TOHRU]
He's living on a pension now,

240
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:50,066
and I didn't wanna
be a burden,

241
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:53,653
so I promised him I would pay my
own tuition and living expenses.

242
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:55,989
Also, I'm Tohru.

243
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,533
[TOHRU]
That all happened in May.

244
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:01,077
[GRANDFATHER] Kyoko dear,
my daughter and her family

245
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,829
are going to be moving in here,

246
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:05,039
but first I'm having
some renovations,

247
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,876
so I plan to stay
with them for a bit.

248
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,003
I suppose we could both
live at their place

249
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,838
until the construction
is finished,

250
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,174
but it's just so small.

251
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:17,802
If you have a good friend
you can stay with instead,

252
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:21,181
that might be more
comfortable for you.

253
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,808
[TOHRU]
Uo lives in a tiny apartment,

254
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,644
and the Hanajimas
are a family of five.

255
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:30,773
There's no way I could stay
with them for months, so...

256
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,358
That's fine, Grandpa!

257
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,067
[TOHRU]
After all,

258
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,361
I'm going to live alone
eventually anyway.

259
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:38,573
This is a chance for me to see
if I'm up to the challenge.

260
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:41,159
Even if the only place I can
afford to live is in a tent

261
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,286
that I bought on sale!

262
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:45,455
Even if typhoons like
the one a few days ago

263
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:46,915
threaten to blow me away!

264
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:47,832
I'll never give up!

265
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:49,375
No matter how small and flimsy,

266
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,920
anywhere can be home
once you get used to it.

267
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,713
Our jobs have gotten
so much easier

268
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:55,215
since they hired the new girl.

269
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:56,966
Yeah, no kidding.

270
00:11:58,676 --> 00:11:59,928
[SHIGURE sighs]

271
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,679
[SHIGURE]
I'm so tired of eating out

272
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,766
or getting delivery
every single night.

273
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,560
[YUKI] The obvious solution
is to make dinner.

274
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:10,438
Except that you complain
every time I cook something.

275
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,398
Well, maybe I would stop
complaining so much

276
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,151
if someone would stop putting
pickled radishes in the curry.

277
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:17,612
As if you're any more
competent than I am.

278
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,989
Please. You're awful
around the house.

279
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:21,741
Two slovenly bachelors like us

280
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:24,535
could really stand to
have a woman around.

281
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:29,499
Hey, speaking of, isn't that
the girl from this morning?

282
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,042
Tohru, right?

283
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,211
Maybe she really
does live nearby.

284
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:36,547
I heard her mother passed
away a little while ago.

285
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,341
So she could've moved.

286
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:42,428
But none of the land's been
rented. Not outside the family.

287
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,599
[TOHRU sighs]

288
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:50,603
Hey, Mom, I'm finally back!

289
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:52,438
I'm really sleepy,

290
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,817
but I still have some homework
to finish before tomorrow.

291
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,568
[sighs]

292
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,321
I'm feeling a little weak
and light‐headed.

293
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:03,199
I'll wash my face.
That should wake me up.

294
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:04,409
Huh?

295
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,666
[SHIGURE laughing]

[YUKI]
It isn't that funny.

297
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,254
I thought something was strange.

298
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:20,049
The Somas own all
the land in this area.

299
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:23,636
[TOHRU]
Um, would it be okay if...

300
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:25,888
...if I lived there
just a little longer?

301
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:30,435
I'll leave as soon as the
renovations are over, I swear.

302
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:36,190
Please, I don't have a lot
of extra money, but I'll pay.

303
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,775
That's a dangerous spot.

304
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,737
The cliffs aren't too stable,
and there are creeps around.

305
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,864
Not to mention, a young
girl can't spend months

306
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,324
living alone in a tent.

307
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:48,369
No, it's all right!
I'm even used to the slugs!

308
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:50,580
I promise, I've got the
strength and willpower

309
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:51,664
to see this through!

She's got a fever.

313
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:03,551
I'll go grab some ice to
help cool her down a little.

314
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:07,263
Though, getting to it
could take a while.

315
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:10,058
[TOHRU]
It's the Toxic Jungle.

316
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,559
Nice analogy!

317
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,895
[wolf howling]

318
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:18,983
There, see?

319
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:22,612
What did I just tell you?
Part of the cliff has crumbled.

320
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:25,656
What? It did?
But how can you tell?

321
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:26,991
[SHIGURE]
Hm?

322
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:30,161
Oh, I like to call it
my animal instinct.

323
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,287
Oh...

324
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:32,705
[YUKI]
Enough joking.

325
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:35,458
Do you know exactly what
part of the cliff collapsed?

326
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,377
How awful.

327
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,545
Surely it was nowhere
near my tent, though!

328
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:40,838
Surely not!

329
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,756
[TOHRU, SHIGURE laughing]

330
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:44,050
Well? Where is it, then?

331
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:49,680
Wait a sec! Mom's picture
is still inside!

332
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,890
Mom!

333
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:52,642
You need to calm down!

334
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:56,062
[TOHRU]
But she's still in there!

335
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:57,313
She's trapped.

336
00:14:57,355 --> 00:15:00,900
I have to get her out.
She‐She can't breathe!

337
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,446
Why don't we come back in the
morning when there's more light?

338
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:07,573
What if something
happened to you?

339
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:11,953
I doubt your mom would want
you to get hurt, right?

340
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,999
[TOHRU]
I'm sorry.

341
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,877
It looks like I've
lost my home again.

342
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,881
[SHIGURE]
That must be tough.

343
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:27,260
[TOHRU] No. I mean,
I wish it hadn't happened,

344
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,095
but I've been through worse.

345
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:33,099
Even worse than this? Like what?

346
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,644
[TOHRU]
Like missing the chance to say

347
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:40,481
"See you when you get back."

348
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:44,944
It was the morning of
the day my mom died.

349
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:48,823
I'd stayed up almost all
night studying for a quiz.

350
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:53,202
She was leaving for work,
but I couldn't wake up.

351
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:55,955
That's the only morning
I didn't say it.

352
00:15:55,997 --> 00:16:00,751
I always said it,
except for that one time.

353
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:04,422
Lately, I'd been thinking
about quitting school

354
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:07,008
and getting a job instead.

355
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:10,344
But... Mom told me:

356
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:15,016
[KYOKO] I only made it as far
as middle school, you know.

357
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,559
But I always wished
I'd gotten to try

358
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:19,562
the "high school girl" thing.

359
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:21,814
So you go out there and
have those experiences

360
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:23,858
I didn't get to have.

361
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,237
[TOHRU]
She was the best mom,

362
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,656
and I didn't say goodbye.

363
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:33,534
That morning... I didn't
even open my eyes

364
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,411
to watch her leave.

365
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,582
[TOHRU]
I'm an idiot.

366
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:43,169
Making a bad grade...
Getting a job...

367
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:45,922
Those things aren't what
should've mattered.

368
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,341
Mom was.

369
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:52,303
The least I can do now is
graduate from high school,

370
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,931
like she wanted me to.

371
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:59,310
I have to make that
dream come true.

372
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:06,275
I can't just lie here and do
nothing because of some fever.

373
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,283
[YUKI]
Surprising.

374
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:19,914
[YUKI] She's so cheerful and
upbeat at school. Always.

375
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:24,043
I wouldn't have guessed
she'd been through so much.

376
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:26,212
It's amazing.

377
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:29,507
[SHIGURE]
Amazing? How so?

378
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:32,093
[YUKI]
Well, take me and the Somas.

379
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,470
I thought I'd broken
free of them,

380
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:36,013
but I haven't really.

381
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,766
Or I would've bought
a tent like Miss Honda

382
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:42,144
and gone off some place
where they couldn't find me.

383
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:45,273
I'm realizing that I'm spoiled.

384
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,316
It's actually pretty
rude, you know.

385
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:49,777
Calling her suffering "amazing."

386
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,279
[YUKI]
True.

387
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:55,908
[YUKI]
Can you take things from here?

388
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,911
Don't tell me you're planning
to go dig up the landslide.

389
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:00,871
That's a lot to manage alone.

390
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,748
Want me to come along?

391
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,126
[YUKI]
Alone?

392
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:10,256
I'll have plenty of help.
Don't worry about me.

393
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:15,636
[RATS squeaking]

394
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:17,847
See you when you get back.

395
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:25,980
[KYOKO]
Tohru.

396
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:31,068
Tohru. You've got a fever again.

397
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,403
You don't have to
burn yourself out

398
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:35,656
helping with the
housework, you know.

399
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:42,246
Just be you, Tohru, and
live life at your own pace.

400
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:45,791
Eventually, you'll catch up.

401
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,966
I miss you.

402
00:18:57,011 --> 00:19:00,473
[TOHRU] I don't have time to
sleep! I have to dig Mom out!

403
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,141
[YUKI]
Good morning.

404
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:03,559
Are you feeling better?

405
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:05,770
[TOHRU] Oh. I, um, yes.
I mean, good morning!

406
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,229
[YUKI]
Here, your photo.

407
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,648
[TOHRU]
Huh?

408
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,568
[YUKI] I think I got all the
rest of your things, too,

409
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:13,778
but could you check and see?

410
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:14,779
[TOHRU]
Uh.

411
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,782
No way! You mean you moved all
that dirt by yourself? But‐‐

412
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,867
No, of course not. I couldn't.

413
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:22,203
[TOHRU]
But... then how?

414
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,789
I can't tell you.

415
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:28,417
Well, I'll just bring
your things upstairs.

416
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:30,419
I know the house is a mess,

417
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:33,506
but we do have a spare
room on the second floor.

418
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,174
You can stay here
until the renovations

419
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:37,093
at your grandfather's are done.

420
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,010
Ah!

421
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:39,345
I couldn't do that!

422
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:41,138
The bedroom doors all
have locks on them.

423
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,973
No, that's not what
I meant at all!

424
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,726
Do you enjoy doing
chores? Housework?

425
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:47,895
You know, like
cooking and cleaning.

426
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:51,899
Uh, yeah. I mean,
it's kind of calming.

427
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,859
[SHIGURE]
Hmm...

428
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,195
Wonderful! Welcome home!

429
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:58,364
Your room's not aired out,
so you should open a window,

430
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:00,282
and I'll get you a copy
of the house key, too.

431
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,117
I can't!

432
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,869
If I moved in here,
I'd only be a burden on you!

433
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:08,624
Miss Honda, we don't consider it
a burden, so please just accept.

434
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,460
Besides, where else
do you have to go?

435
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:13,754
Okay, but please,

436
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:15,965
if I'm going to impose
on you by living here,

437
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:18,926
at least I should know if there
are any special rules to follow.

438
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,553
There are none.

439
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,724
You should just be
you, Miss Honda,

440
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,810
and live your life
at your own pace.

441
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:29,854
It's that simple.

442
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:34,275
[KYOKO]
Just be you, Tohru.

443
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,447
[TOHRU]
Soma.

444
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:42,366
He really is a mystery.

445
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:45,202
Are you sure about
this? She is a girl.

446
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,705
[YUKI]
You wait until now to ask?

447
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:51,000
It'll be fine, just as long
as she doesn't hug me.

448
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:57,214
Like I thought, it is a little
stuffy in here. Yuki, open...

449
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,383
[TOHRU]
Is this really all right?

450
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:01,510
It feels too good to be true.

451
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:03,304
Uh, 'kay.

452
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:08,517
[TOHRU]
Wait. Where are Soma's parents?

453
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,895
Do they live
somewhere else, maybe?

454
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,612
[TOHRU]
Huh?

455
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:20,946

Yo.

Are you ready for a beating,
Rat‐boy? Let's do this.

457
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:29,371
[YUKI] Honestly. Why don't
you just accept it already?

458
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:31,081
You're too weak to take me.

459
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,416
Think so, huh?

460
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:36,796
Well, too bad for you I'm not
the same fighter I was before!

461
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:37,797
I'll show you!

Wait! I'm sure we can
settle this without‐‐

Hey, Yuki, was that
Kyo's voice I heard?

Um. I'm so sorry! Are you okay?

Yeah, that's him.

00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,574
Okay, so here's the thing...

475
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:06,951
We have to hurry!
