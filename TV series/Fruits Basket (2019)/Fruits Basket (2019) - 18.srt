1
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:17,100
[YUKI] Looks like the
rain's dying down,

2
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:19,686
but let's wait here
a little longer.

3
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:20,938
'Kay!

4
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:25,025
So, um, finals are coming up.

5
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:26,610
Yeah.

6
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:28,070
But I almost forgot.

7
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:30,781
Before that, we have the
student council elections.

8
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:31,990
Yeah.

9
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,201
And from what I understand,

10
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:36,078
President Takei wants
you to take his place

11
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:38,539
after he graduates.

12
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:42,125
But it looks like maybe...
you would rather not.

13
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:47,256
No. I wouldn't. Not at all.

14
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,508
I don't know what
he expects of me,

15
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:53,929
what they all expect,
but they've got the wrong idea.

16
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:57,349
'Cause the real me is more...

17
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,643
More what?

18
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:02,521
[YUKI] Never mind.
Forget I said anything.

19
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:03,772
Sure.

20
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:06,733
Look! It's tapered off enough,
we should be good to go.

21
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,652
You ready?

22
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:10,821
[HATSUHARU]
Oh, hey, Yuki.

23
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:11,822
[YUKI]
Haru!

24
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:13,699
[TOHRU]
Hatsuharu?

25
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,034
Why are you out? It's raining.

26
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,911
I'm not the one who's soaked.

27
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:21,790
Why are you out?
Did you get lost again?

28
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:23,792
I've been searching.

29
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:27,087
For her. It took a while.

30
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:29,047
Aw, what a cute little kitty!

31
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,632
[YUKI]
Saw that coming.

32
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:32,843
[YUKI] Miss Honda,
she's actually a tiger.

33
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:33,552
[TOHRU]
Hm?

34
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:36,680
[HATSUHARU] This is Kisa Soma.
Careful, her teeth are sharp.

35
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:37,681
Oh, wow!

36
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:41,018
I didn't expect to run into
the zodiac Tiger spirit today!

37
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,769
Um. It's nice to meet you!

38
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,063
I'm Tohru Honda. Can I‐‐?

39
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:48,191
[HATSUHARU, YUKI gasp]

40
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,484
[YUKI]
Miss Honda!

41
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:50,944
[HATSUHARU]
Ah...

42
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:27,207
[SHIGURE]
Oh, dear. You got nibbled on?

43
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:30,252
Yes, um, maybe I
should've expected it.

44
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,921
Kisa, come here and apologize.

45
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:35,298
[TOHRU] No, she doesn't
need to. I'm fine, really.

46
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,466
Kisa!

47
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:39,678
Yuki, that won't work.
She doesn't talk.

48
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,512
What?

49
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,723
Kisa can't talk.

50
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:45,726
She stopped altogether shortly
after she entered middle school.

51
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,145
She's mute.

52
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:51,106
According to Tori,
it's psychological.

53
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:54,651
She's locked all of
her words up inside.

54
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:55,819
With everything that's happened,

55
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:58,864
she stopped talking,
stopped going to school,

56
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,908
then today, she ran
away from home.

57
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,744
[TOHRU gasps]

58
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,996
[HATSUHARU] That's why
I was looking for her.

59
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,915
Didn't expect to find her
in Tiger form, though.

60
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:09,708
There you are.

61
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,127
[TOHRU] Did she bump into
someone of the opposite sex?

62
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,921
[HATSUHARU] Seemed like
she was just exhausted.

63
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:21,261
So... what happened to make her
stop talking and leave school?

64
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:22,554
Kids.

65
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,055
[TOHRU]
Kids?

66
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,474
[HATSUHARU]
Bullies.

67
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,311
[TOHRU yelps]

68
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:30,771
That hurts.

69
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:33,774
What, are you pissed at me?

70
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,485
Telling me not to
shoot my mouth off?

71
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,528
Well, sorry, that's too bad.

72
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,656
You have any idea how worried
I've been about you?

73
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:42,949
And I'm not the only one.

74
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:46,036
Your mom's been looking
all over for you, too.

75
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:48,288
[TOHRU]
Wait, Kisa!

76
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,206
Uh! You're bleeding!

77
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:49,998
You're bleeding and Kisa ran...

78
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,084
It'll be okay, Tohru.
I'm sure she won't go too far.

79
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,711
I'll get Kisa and then
I'll stop the bleeding.

80
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:56,129
Just calm down.

81
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,590
Maybe you should give
a crap once in a while.

82
00:04:58,632 --> 00:04:59,758
Oh, my.

83
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,886
Did you quietly turn into Dark
Haru while I wasn't looking?

84
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:06,598
[HATSUHARU] Uh‐uh.
Just not a fan of tiger bites.

85
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,226
Wish I knew what to do with her.

86
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:12,938
Haru, you seem awfully
worried about her.

87
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,649
I didn't know you were so close.

88
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,650
[BOTH]
You jealous?

89
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:17,818
No!

90
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,402
No sense of humor.

91
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:19,820
‐‐Nope.

92
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,947
‐‐I'm right here.
‐‐Nope.

93
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:25,617
[HATSUHARU]
Thing is, she reminds me of you.

94
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,995
You know, back
when you shut down,

95
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,039
stopped talking for a while.

96
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:36,211
[HATSUHARU] You curled up
in a corner and went silent.

97
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,922
It was the only way that
you could protect yourself.

98
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:41,466
She's just doing the same.

99
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:44,302
[YUKI]
Shut up!

100
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,346
Is it really that big a deal?

101
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:48,723
[YUKI]
Yes, it is!

102
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,517
You ashamed?

103
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,943
Sensei. That's a nasty
habit of yours.

104
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:02,237
You can't see a wound
without rubbing salt in it.

105
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,238
[SHIGURE chuckles]

106
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,657
Yes, well, it's my nature.

107
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,831
[footsteps]

108
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,291
There you are!

109
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,001
I've been looking
all over for you.

110
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,002
Why don't we go‐‐?

111
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,295
[TOHRU gasps]

112
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,005
It's fine. That doesn't hurt.

113
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,424
Nope, nope. Not one
tiny little bit.

114
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:25,677
Um, anyway, uhh...
Will you come inside?

115
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:28,763
Everyone is really worried
about you, so, please.

116
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,223
[KISA'S MOTHER]
Kisa.

117
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:31,850
[TOHRU]
Uh, hello.

118
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:36,062
Kisa. I've been looking
everywhere for you.

119
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,105
[TOHRU gasps]

120
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:42,027
Shigure called. He wanted to
let me know you'd been found.

121
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,821
Please. Why are you doing this?

122
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:47,032
You're causing
trouble for everyone.

123
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:51,036
Did you even stop to
think for one second?

124
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,663
Do you enjoy making
things hard for me?

125
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:54,623
[gasps]

126
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:58,168
[MOMIJI] The mothers usually
react one of two ways.

127
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,795
They're either extremely
overprotective of their kids,

128
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,673
or they end up rejecting
them completely.

129
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:04,674
Well?

130
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:06,426
Why didn't you tell
me about those kids

131
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:08,762
who were bullying you?

132
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,514
Why did you run away from home?

133
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:14,935
Why won't you say anything?

134
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,771
I'm so tired.

135
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:20,148
I can't take this anymore.

136
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,401
[TOHRU]
She couldn't tell you.

137
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,237
When you're being
bullied like that...

138
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,740
...it's hard to talk about.

139
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:32,744
I know. It happened to me.

140
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,996
I couldn't tell my mom, either.

141
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:37,248
She found out
eventually, though.

142
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,667
And when she did,

143
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:43,088
I started crying and
apologizing like crazy.

144
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:46,257
I felt so ashamed.

145
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,928
I felt pathetic and worthless
for being bullied,

146
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:55,141
and I hated the idea of my mom
knowing it had happened.

147
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:59,604
I thought once she knew,
she might not love me anymore.

148
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,356
I was so scared.

149
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,274
[YUKI]
I was scared.

150
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,111
To let people know about
that part of myself.

151
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:10,448
I tried to hide it by
pretending I was okay.

152
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:16,246
But that just made me feel even
more pathetic... and ashamed.

153
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:20,166
[TOHRU] Instead, my mom
took my face in her hands

154
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,420
and said, "It's okay."

155
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,422
And I could breathe again.

156
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:28,925
When she said that there was
nothing to be embarrassed about,

157
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:33,471
I cried again,
this time in relief.

158
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,975
Maybe that's how Kisa feels.

159
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:42,063
[TOHRU] Maybe she's scared
that you'll hate her.

160
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:44,691
So she couldn't tell you

I'll be at your house later
today. I want to see Kisa.

317
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,501
And I have something for her.

318
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:01,711
[YUKI]
A present?

319
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:04,797
A note. It's from her
homeroom teacher.

320
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:08,259
So... it'll probably
make us wanna puke.

321
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,136
See you soon!

322
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:13,514
I don't believe being
weak should be considered

323
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:16,225
a good thing, but...

324
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:19,479
...I don't think stronger
always means better.

325
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,689
You've probably heard
of survival of the fittest

326
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:23,524
in the animal kingdom.

327
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:27,069
The thing is, we're
humans, not animals.

328
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:33,576
[YUKI] That goes for all of us.
The zodiac as well.

329
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:35,870
[TOHRU]
Well, yeah.

330
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,124
You are!

331
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:47,340
[YUKI]
That's encouraging.

332
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,050
[TOHRU chuckles]

333
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:55,973
What's it say?

334
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,896
"Soma, I hope you're well.

335
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:04,565
Do you think you'll be coming
back to school soon?

336
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,108
I'm awaiting your
return along with

337
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,693
the rest of your classmates.

338
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,445
I want you to know you
can always talk to me,

339
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:11,822
and I think if you
participate more in class,

340
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,075
you can be friends
with everyone."

341
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,453
[sighs]

342
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,458
[YUKI] "The most important
thing you can learn

343
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,418
is to love who you are.

344
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,128
Find something good
about yourself

345
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,339
and look to it when
you're feeling down.

346
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:31,759
If you hate yourself, how can
others appreciate you?

347
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:34,637
Self‐love is the most
important love we have.

348
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:38,099
I hope of all my lessons,
you remember this one."

349
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:43,104
I was right.
I wanna barf now.

350
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:49,277
[YUKI]
Kisa. I get it.

351
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,446
I'm the same as you.

352
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,949
There was a time when
I stopped speaking.

353
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:57,827
For different reasons.

354
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:01,289
Regardless, I talked to no one.

355
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,875
And... I felt so
embarrassed those days.

356
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,253
I truly hated myself.

357
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:09,088
I was so lost.

358
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:14,885
So I'm not sure your
teacher's actually right.

359
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:18,681
What does "self‐love" even mean?

360
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:20,725
How do we begin to try
and find something good

361
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:24,645
about ourselves when
we're trapped in darkness?

362
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:27,440
The whole reason
we despise ourselves

363
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:31,193
is because we can only
see the parts we hate.

364
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:34,864
So forcing ourselves to find
"good things" feels pointless,

365
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:37,950
like we'd just be
making them up.

366
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:41,787
It's a nice sentiment,
but that's not how life works.

367
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:47,251
Instead, I think it's when
someone else says they love you

368
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:50,546
that you're finally able
to start loving yourself.

369
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,634
[YUKI] When someone truly
accepts who you are,

370
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:57,637
that's when you can start
to forgive yourself,

371
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:01,515
and suddenly see the good
things you had all along.

372
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,104
[KISA]
Yes.

373
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,731
[gasps]

374
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:10,608
[KISA]
You're right.

375
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,026
Yes.

376
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:16,113
It made me glad.

377
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,533
‐‐Kisa...
‐‐[YUKI] Kisa.

378
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:20,785
What will you do?

379
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:24,872
Moving on, do you
still want to be silent?

380
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,918
[KISA]
No. I can't.

381
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,087
I need to be better.

382
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,421
Or else...

383
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,676
[KISA] ...I'll feel like
an even worse person

384
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,719
than I do right now.

385
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,766
[KISA]
Even if we aren't ever friends,

386
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:47,228
even if they keep ignoring me...

387
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:51,190
...I have to try.
I have to change.

388
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:52,608
Or else.

389
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,070
[YUKI]
You're right.

390
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:59,240
Let's try.

391
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:02,618
I will, too. Promise.

392
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:06,747
And if you get sad again,
or life gets too painful,

393
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,999
you can come back.

394
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,377
She'll be here waiting for you.

395
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,381
[HATSUHARU]
It's been so long.

396
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:20,177
[HATSUHARU]
I've missed your voice, Kisa.

397
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,523
[KISA]
Please, wait!

398
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,233
Huh?

399
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:35,901
Hi, Tohru.

400
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,446
[gasps]

401
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,701
Kisa!

402
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:47,455
[TOHRU crying]

403
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:50,207
[YUKI] I can't keep
running away forever.

404
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:56,088
[YUKI] Even if my heart is still
covered in such dark shadows,

405
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:59,675
there will come a time when
I have to confront my weakness.

406
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:07,308
[YUKI] So that all those gray
days, those tears I shed...

407
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,560
...will have been
worth something.

408
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:17,234
[TOHRU] And so, even though she
was sometimes hesitant to speak,

409
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,820
Kisa headed back to school.

410
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:22,364
Yuki should've come
to see her off with us.

411
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:25,367
He said he had something
he had to do today.

412
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:28,329
[TOHRU] Truthfully, I'm a
little sad Kisa won't be

413
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,581
by my side anymore.

414
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:33,459
But I guess I'll just
have to bear it.

415
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:35,461
Because she mustered her courage

416
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:38,631
and is fighting to
be her best self.

417
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:42,468
You can do it, Kisa.
I believe in you.

418
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:46,555
Yuki! What did you just say?

419
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:50,059
[YUKI] I accept your offer,
and will be your successor.

420
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,103
My apologies for not
saying "yes" sooner.

421
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,355
So for your troubles,

422
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:57,107
I swear that I will be
a reliable president

423
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,735
and carry on your legacy.

424
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:03,280
Moving forward,
I hope you'll advise me.

425
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,574
Is this a dream?
Your love for me‐‐

426
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:07,034
Think again.

427
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:13,582
[YUKI] It's not like I've
suddenly become stronger.

428
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:16,085
Or did anything
to change, really.

429
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:23,467
[YUKI] My body still trembles,
but I'll keep facing my fears.

430
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,720
[YUKI]
What's important is...

431
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:31,183
...that my weakness
inspires me to improve.

432
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:07,655
[RITSU]
"I'm so sorry!"
