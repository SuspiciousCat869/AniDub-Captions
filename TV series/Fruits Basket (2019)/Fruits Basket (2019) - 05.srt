1
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,681
[TV HOST A]
You know, folks, I'm...

2
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:16,266
[TOHRU]
Grandpa called.

3
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:19,228
He said the renovations
are wrapping up.

4
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,522
[SHIGURE]
They worked surprisingly fast.

5
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:22,689
[TOHRU]
Yes.

6
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:24,608
The exterior walls aren't done,

7
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:28,570
but most of the work's complete,
so it's ready to live in.

8
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:32,491
Grandpa said I could
come back, so...

9
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:34,201
[TV HOST A]
Let me try it.

10
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:37,120
[TOHRU] Uh! Oh, no! I forgot!
I haven't started cooking!

11
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:38,622
We can scrounge something up.

12
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:41,542
Or better yet, why don't we
just go out to eat instead?

13
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,919
[TOHRU]
It'll be fine.

14
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:46,630
I already have all the
ingredients I need.

15
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:48,966
[TV HOST B] ...we've got a great
show lined up for you tonight,

16
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:50,926
so I hope you'll stick around.

17
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,933
[KYOKO]
Hey! Sorry I'm late!

18
00:00:57,975 --> 00:00:58,767
[TOHRU gasps]

19
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:00,519
[TOHRU]
Mom!

20
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:02,145
I hope work was okay.

21
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,689
Dinner'll be ready
in just a sec‐‐

22
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,940
Ah!

23
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:06,191
I told you, stay in bed

24
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:08,026
until your fever was
gone, young lady!

25
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,444
Oh, no, don't worry!

26
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:12,281
My temperature's already
come down a whole lot.

27
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,366
You work so hard
for us every day.

28
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:16,410
I can't just do nothing.

29
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,709
[KYOKO]
Thank you, sweetie.

30
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:29,464
But sometimes,
it's okay to be selfish.

31
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:34,261
That's something we
all deserve, you know?

32
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,559
Huh? Ah!

33
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:41,602
Ow!

34
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:47,983
[TOHRU]
Thanks, Mom. But I'm okay!

35
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:50,444
I'm sure Grandpa's house
is looking great now!

36
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,029
I can be happy there, too.

37
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,740
Besides, anything's
gotta be better

38
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,659
than living in a tent, right?

39
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:35,006
There's some leftover
salted fish in the fridge.

40
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,342
It'll go bad before too long.

41
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:40,178
You'll probably wanna pick up
soy sauce at the store soon.

42
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,972
Oh, and garbage day
changed recently,

43
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,474
so keep that in mind.

44
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:45,851
What else?

45
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,603
Um... Right.

46
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:52,065
Here, this is my
grandfather's address.

47
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:54,651
I'll leave it with
you just in case.

48
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:57,112
I guess tomorrow's the big day.

49
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:59,740
You've done so much
for us. Thank you.

50
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,742
[TOHRU]
No! Thank you!

51
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,744
And I promise, you can trust me.

52
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:06,830
I'll take the Soma family
secret to my grave.

53
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:09,541
You'll enjoy being
home again, won't you?

54
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,627
Oh, yes. I'll settle
back in just fine!

55
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,671
Well, I should go
pack up my room

56
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:16,590
and get ready for moving day.

57
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:22,679
I half‐expected
you to stop her.

58
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,306
Why would I?

59
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:28,059
This was always just going to be
a temporary living arrangement.

60
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,229
[KYO]
Rat boy's right.

61
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,900
[KYO] Weird thing
isn't her going home.

62
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,652
It's that she ever
stayed here at all.

63
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:38,904
[SHIGURE]
Of course.

64
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:42,991
And obviously everyone's
fine with this development.

65
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,326
[sighs]

66
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,246
[TOHRU]
I've been fooling myself.

67
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,165
It was silly of me to
think the Somas and I

68
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:51,958
could become a family.

69
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,422
Then again, I always have
been a little on the dim side.

70
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,257
Haven't I, Mom?

71
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,553
All right, everyone! Here's
what we're playing today.

72
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:05,305
The fruits basket game!

73
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:08,350
Let's all remember the
rules and have some fun.

74
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:11,645
[STUDENT A] You're an apple.
You're a banana.

75
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:15,106
A cherry. A pear. A peach.

76
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,943
Honda, you're a rice ball!

77
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,487
[TOHRU] I don't know why,
but for some reason,

78
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:22,739
the boys picked on me
a lot back then.

79
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:28,328
He was probably trying to be
mean to me, but at the time...

80
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,081
[TOHRU]
Yay! Rice balls are yummy!

81
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:33,166
[STUDENT A]
Okay, here we go. Apple!

82
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,710
[CHILDREN laughing, chattering]

83
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:36,962
[TOHRU]
The game went on,

84
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:40,465
and one by one,
the others were called.

85
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:43,426
I waited for it to be
the rice ball's turn.

86
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:48,640
[TOHRU]
I waited and waited.

87
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,352
[TOHRU]
That's right...

88
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:55,313
I've never been the
brightest lightbulb.

89
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:03,071
[TOHRU]
Um, the place looks great.

90
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:05,407
Thank you for letting me stay.

91
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,617
We're glad to have
you, Kyoko dear.

92
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,911
Come on, Grandpa, that's Tohru.

93
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:11,913
[TOHRU]
It should've been obvious.

94
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:15,125
The rice ball would never
get to join the group.

95
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:19,004
Rice balls don't belong
in a fruits basket.

96
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:22,007
[SHIGURE]
Evidently, she's gone.

97
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:25,385
Not terribly sentimental,
as far as goodbyes go.

98
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:34,185
[SHIGURE]
Well, that was a clean parting.

99
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:37,856
Even so, you left plenty of
melancholy in your wake.

100
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,610
Goodbye for now.

101
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:47,157
[TOHRU]
Really? I love strawberries.

102
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,868
Your kindness lights
up like a candle.

103
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,705
But please, if I forget this,
will you befriend me again?

104
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,964
[TOHRU]
I actually really like you!

105
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:05,467
I have always loved
the zodiac Cat!

106
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,594
Right‐handed jab!

107
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:09,304
[chuckles]

108
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:14,517
I mean, sure, Soma is great,
but the thing is, so are you.

109
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,917
[TOHRU] I wonder if they ate
breakfast this morning

110
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,711
without anyone there
to heat it up.

111
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,880
Maybe I should've done
things differently.

112
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:47,133
Said goodbye to them in person.

113
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:50,720
I just figured I'll see them
again at school, so...

114
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,057
Tohru! Are you done
unpacking yet?

115
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:56,518
[TOHRU] Oh! I'm so sorry!
I'll finish up right now!

116
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,936
This sucks.

117
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,563
Grandpa's place is bigger
than our last one was.

118
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,065
More space, and yet here I am,

119
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,192
sharing a room with
somebody else.

120
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:06,069
I'm sorry.

121
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:09,364
Oh, Kyoko. They're calling
for you downstairs.

122
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:11,783
It's still Tohru, Grandpa.

123
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:16,496
I'm here. You wanted
to speak to me?

124
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:17,956
That's right, we did.

125
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,792
We need to discuss this
sooner rather than later.

126
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,085
The thing is, Tohru,

127
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:24,754
I hear that you were
living unchaperoned

128
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,297
in a single man's home.

129
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,508
I had a private
detective investigate.

130
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,261
Living with a guy?!
You're kidding!

131
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:34,305
And I thought between the two
of us I was the more mature one!

132
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:39,894
Wait, a private detective?
To follow me? But why do that?

133
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:43,982
My son has ambitions. He wants
to become a police officer.

134
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,735
For that to happen, we can't
very well have someone

135
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:50,321
with a criminal record in
the family, now can we?

136
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,282
At first I thought a
private investigation

137
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,159
might be going too far,

138
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,079
but they say Kyoko used to
have violent tendencies.

139
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:00,290
And you know, the apple
doesn't always

140
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:04,252
fall far from the tree,
so I was concerned.

141
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,004
If you're going to
live in this house,

142
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,714
you need to make sure
all of your actions

143
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:10,091
are discreet from now on.

144
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,510
Be honest, Tohru.

145
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,262
While you were living there,

146
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:17,015
they didn't do anything
to you, did they?

147
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:20,185
Anything indecent?

148
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,519
[slap]

149
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,735
Dad, what's gotten into you?

150
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:30,070
[GRANDFATHER]
Honestly!

151
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,907
Are jeering and taunting all
you people know how to do?

152
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,910
I'm very sorry
about them, Kyoko.

153
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,411
It's okay.

154
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,830
[GRANDFATHER] Please don't
think too badly of them.

155
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,333
They're terribly
unpleasant people,

156
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,793
but what can you do?

157
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:45,960
[AUNT]
How could you say that?!

158
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,796
You're not exactly
helping here!

159
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,255
[GRANDFATHER]
Hm? What's wrong?

160
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:52,258
Did I say something
I shouldn't've?

161
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,804
Still, nasty or not,
they are my family.

162
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:59,516
And I've invited them
to share my home.

163
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:02,477
If they say a few ugly
things to me, well,

164
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,646
I can tolerate it.

165
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,732
But there's no reason
you should stay here

166
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,401
and put up with their
petty backbiting.

167
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,570
Are you saying...?

168
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,781
[GRANDFATHER]
Oh, no! None of that.

169
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:17,283
I'm not trying to kick you out.

170
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,869
It's just, I don't think
"putting up with things"

171
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:21,788
really suits you, Kyoko.

172
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,039
[gasps]

173
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:27,418
[GRANDFATHER] Katsuya said
Kyoko would always be happiest

174
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,088
living somewhere she
could spread her wings.

175
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:34,592
Hard to do that surrounded
by negativity and spite.

176
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,052
[TOHRU]
Dad.

177
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:38,888
[GRANDFATHER] So you see,
I think you might need something

178
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,808
a little more than this place.

179
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,977
My dear, if there's
somewhere you'd rather be,

180
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,311
that's all right.

181
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:48,523
I promise you I'll understand.

182
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:49,941
[TOHRU]
No.

183
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:54,404
How could I possibly need
more when I have so much?

184
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:59,993
[TOHRU]
Mom loved me with all her heart.

185
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:03,913
I have two friends who
are always there for me.

186
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:09,419
And Soma and his family
were so kind to me.

187
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,964
[TOHRU] You're offering
me a place to stay.

188
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,675
Giving me a roof
over my head again.

189
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:18,678
I can't be anything
but grateful for that.

190
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:24,058
[TOHRU]
I know I'm blessed. Truly.

191
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:31,024
[TOHRU] So I shouldn't say...
that what really I want...

192
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,737
[TOHRU]
...is to go home.

193
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:39,240
[TOHRU] I shouldn't be
asking for even more

194
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:41,159
than I already have.

195
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:45,663
I shouldn't miss the
Soma family so much.

196
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:49,083
Soma and Kyo...

197
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,754
I wanted to get to
know them better.

198
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,381
I wanted to keep
eating with them.

199
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:59,219
To keep talking about
everything under the sun.

200
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,804
I wanted more.

201
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:06,643
The truth is...
I didn't wanna leave.

202
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,731
[TOHRU]
Soma, Kyo, Shigure...

203
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:14,442
I wanted all of us
to stay together.

204
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,861
Learning about each other.

205
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:20,531
I wanted it so much.

206
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,952
Is that selfish of me?

207
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,913
Is it asking for more
than I deserve?

208
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:30,959
[YUKI]
Come on.

209
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:36,589
It's time to go home.

210
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:49,560
[KYO grunting]

211
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,647
Would you stop? That angry
pacing is distracting me.

212
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:55,733
If it bothers you so much,
then go read in your room!

213
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,026
What's with them?

214
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:59,195
Kicking her out for
some renovations,

215
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:02,198
then casually summoning her
back when they're over with?

216
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,159
What else would they do?
Seems perfectly normal to me.

217
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,953
[KYO]
It isn't normal at all!

218
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,579
They're treating her
like she's disposable,

219
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,708
like what she wants
doesn't even matter.

220
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:14,294
This from the idiot who left
home without so much as a word

221
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,754
and dropped off the
map for four months.

222
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:20,091
[KYO] You wanna fight?
'Cause I'm ready!

223
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,010
You're the angry one.

224
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,803
But if you want a
beating, then let's go.

225
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:26,931
I'll show you who's getting
beat! Outside now, rodent!

226
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,558
Will you children
please calm down?

227
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,101
My poor house can't take it.

228
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,894
‐‐[YUKI] I am calm.
‐‐[KYO] I'm calm as hell!

229
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,688
[SHIGURE]
Clearly.

230
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:34,814
[KYO]
Dammit!

231
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:49,078
I'm going to take a walk.

232
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,414
Enjoy the fresh air!

233
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:53,499
[SHIGURE]
Hm?

234
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,800
What's wrong? Looking
for something?

235
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,386
Uh. Yeah, just nail clippers.

236
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,055
[SHIGURE]
Mh‐hm...

237
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:13,353
If you're looking for the note
Tohru left, you're out of luck.

238
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,439
‐‐[SHIGURE] Yuki took it.
‐‐[KYO] That bastard!

239
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:17,607
[SHIGURE chuckles]

240
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:24,238
[YUKI] It's hard to find just
from the information on here.

241
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,282
So what now? I guess
I could ask around.

242
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:31,204
[KYO]
Hey! Hold it right there!

243
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:35,124
Hand over that note
now or I'll kill ya!

244
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:40,004
[SHIGURE sneezes]

245
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:42,090
[YUKI]
Not this one.

246
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,674
Or this one.

247
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,427
Hey, moron! You just
took us in a circle!

248
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:47,845
[YUKI]
I don't get it.

249
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,931
The house should be in
this block of buildings.

250
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,599
Well, none of the
nameplates said "Honda,"

251
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,226
so obviously it's not.

252
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:53,976
Give it.

253
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:54,936
Hands off.

254
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,771
[KYO]
Listen, it just got remodeled,

255
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:58,314
so it'll be all new and shiny,

256
00:14:58,356 --> 00:14:59,899
which means if we
haven't found it yet,

257
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:02,443
we're looking in
the wrong place!

258
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:03,653
[YUKI gasps]

259
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,405
The exterior walls aren't done,

260
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:09,700
but most of the work's complete,
so it's ready to live in.

261
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,411
[KYO]
Uh. Hey!

262
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,622
Where do you think you're going?

263
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:18,584
[YUKI]
Here it is.

264
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:21,212
[KYO] It's totally still
under construction.

265
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,755
[YUKI]
Just outside.

266
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:25,508
Come on, we can at least go
in and talk to Miss Honda.

267
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,717
Yeah.

268
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:31,973
There's no answer.

269
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,600
Maybe they can't hear that
wussy knock of yours.

270
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:35,977
My turn.

271
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:38,729
Excuse me!

272
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:39,772
Wait!

273
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,024
What the hell did
you do that for?!

274
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:42,984
Shh!

275
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,026
[AUNT]
...might be going too far.

276
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:47,947
But they say Kyoko used to
have violent tendencies.

277
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:50,158
And you know,
the apple doesn't always

278
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:54,162
fall far from the tree,
so I was concerned.

279
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,913
If you're going to
live in this house,

280
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,623
you need to make sure
all of your actions

281
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,417
are discreet from now on.

282

[AUNT'S SON]
Be honest, Tohru.

While you were living there,

00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,840
they didn't do anything
to you, did they?

We can't do anything out here.

Think about it:

The important thing here
isn't what we want.

297
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,867
It's what Miss Honda wants.

[TOHRU]
No.

How could I possibly need
more when I have so much?

...is to go home.

I shouldn't be asking for even
more than I already have.

I shouldn't miss the

00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,217
[YUKI]
Come on.

315
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,345
It's time to go home.

316
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,016
You're... You're here!

317
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:39,767
Who's that?

318
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:40,935
[AUNT'S SON]
They're hot!

319
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:43,938
Wait, Soma! I don't understa‐‐

320
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,231
It's time to go.

321
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:48,276
What? You're here too, Kyo? Ah!

322
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,486
[TOHRU]
But I‐‐

323
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:52,321
We're sorry for
the interruption.

324
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:54,865
Your door was unlocked,
so we let ourselves in.

325
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,909
Are Miss Honda's
things upstairs?

326
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:58,953
Now just a moment.
What is this about?

327
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:02,081
Can't you tell? We've
come for Miss Honda.

328
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:03,749
[AUNT'S SON]
Wait, are you from the house

329
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,294
where Tohru was playing
live‐in girlfriend?

330
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,713
That would mean you're
actually a guy!

‐‐[AUNT'S SON groaning]

333
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:15,636
Be careful how you speak about
Miss Honda in the future.

334
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:16,929
Scum.

335
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,727
[TOHRU]
Hey, um, Kyo.

336
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,478
Why did you come here?

337
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,063
Jeez. You left us
the information,

338
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,523
so we used it, okay?

339
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:29,650
Not that it was exactly helpful.

340
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,110
Do you know how long
I had to spend

341
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:32,778
looking around with
that damn Rat?

342
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,530
It was freakin' torture.

343
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:39,160
But honestly, I don't understand
why I'm doing this, either.

344
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,995
I mean, why did
I feel so on‐edge

345
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:42,788
the second you left
the house earlier?

346
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:46,709
I don't get it, and that
pisses me off even more!

347
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:49,670
[TOHRU]
Then... those two came for me

348
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:52,298
even though they can't stand
being around each other?

349
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,507
[KYO]
It's your fault!

350
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,301
If you didn't wanna
leave our place,

351
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:57,136
you should've just said so!

352
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:58,596
[TOHRU]
How did you know?

353
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:01,057
[KYO] We heard the whole
thing from outside.

354
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:10,608
[KYO] Being selfish sometimes...
it's no big deal.

355
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:14,070
I wouldn't like it if somebody
was selfish every single day...

356
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,907
...but that isn't
the way you are.

357
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:20,951
You can be selfish
every once in a while.

358
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:24,288
I figure you deserve
that much at least.

359
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,875
So next time, just ask.

360
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,254
[KYOKO]
It's okay to be selfish.

361
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,632
That's something
we all deserve.

362
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:43,391
Uh! What is it?! What's wrong?!
Why are you crying?!

363
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:44,975
[TOHRU]
Home...

364
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:51,190
[TOHRU]
I want to go home.

365
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:55,569
Even if it is selfish,
that's what I want.

366
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,738
To be with all of you.

367
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,959
Then come on, let's go home.

368
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:12,461
But, Kyo, all of my stuff...

369
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:19,635
Let's go.

[STUDENT A]
Okay, next is...

371
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,059
...the rice ball!

372
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:40,072
[TOHRU]
I can't believe it.

373
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:43,576
I'm the luckiest
person in the world.

374
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,494
You were right, Mom.

375
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,749
[AUNT sighs]

376
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,919
Okay, what in the
world just happened?

377
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,921
[AUNT'S SON]
He was really a guy.

378

[AUNT]
I'm exhausted.

[AUNT'S SON]
He was really a guy.

380

[GRANDFATHER]
Be well, Kyoko.

381
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:05,306
You made the right choice.

382
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,933
[AUNT'S DAUGHTER]
It's still Tohru, Grandpa.

383
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,770
[AUNT'S SON]
He was really a guy!

[SHIGURE clapping]

385
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:17,193
You captured the fair maiden.
Congratulations, boys!

00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,904
You make us sound really creepy
when you put it that way.

Let's go with "rescued
the fair maiden."

Um, I guess I'm moving
back in here, then.

[SHIGURE]
Mh‐hm. Mh‐hm.

390
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,037
So it would appear.

391
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,748
And if there's any fallout,
you just leave it to me.

392
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,042
Oh, no, I couldn't
ask you to do that!

393
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,085
I've put you through
so much trouble already!

394

Now don't be silly!

It's good you're back.

396
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:40,508
These two tried awfully
hard, after all.

397
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:41,717
Couldn't have been easy:

398

Swallowing their pride,
stealing your note,

399

dashing off on a
desperate search for you.

Heh. It was impressive.

401
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,977
I have to say, I've
never seen our Yuki

402
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,021
go to pieces quite like that.

403
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:56,982
I did not go to pieces!

I believe that was your face.

[KYO]
Argh! Damn it, Yuki!

409
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:12,832
It's not a perfect
home, but it's yours.

If you want it.

Yes!

412
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,169
Today's the day I take you out!

413
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:18,921
This just keeps getting
more embarrassing.

414
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:22,883
[TOHRU] And so, after an
eventful day, here I am,

415
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:27,388
living at Shigure's house again,
exactly where I wanna be.
