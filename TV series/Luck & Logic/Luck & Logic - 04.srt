322
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,333
without caving
under the pressure

323
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,708
is because we trust
the people beside us!

324
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:03,916
How do you not
understand that?!

325
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,791
Teamwork saving
the day is an idea

326
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:08,416
that sucky fighters cling to
make themselves feel better.

327
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,666
[TAMAKI]
Say what?!

328
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,000
You really think you can
do everything yourself.

329
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:13,541
That's a dangerous
delusion, friend!

330
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:15,625
[CHLOE]
Just keep outta my way!

331
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,500
[CHLOE yelling]

332
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:24,083
[CHLOE yelling]

333
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:30,375
[YOSHICHIKA grunting]

334
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,083
[LOGIGRAPH]
Trance Limit reached.

335
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,791
[PIERI]
Civilian evacuation is complete.

336
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:37,333
[VERONICA]
Did you read that, Tsurugi?

337
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:38,375
Yes.

338
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,625
[ATHENA]
Are you okay?

339
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,791
[TAMAKI]
I'm sorry we're late, you two.

340
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:57,916
No problem.

341
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,416
You're just in time!

342
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:03,208
Take Athena and
get her outta here!

343
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,166
I'm pretending
I didn't hear that.

344
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,458
I've come to
protect both of you!

345
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,833
[VERONICA]
These Foreigners are unique.

346
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:14,375
The more they're defeated,

347
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:17,791
the higher their individual
Paradox Levels seem to elevate.

348
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:20,791
Something else is off about
these party-balloon freaks.

349
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:23,791
I haven't seen a single Trance
Jacked civilian anywhere.

350
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,166
That is strange.

351
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,000
[NEMESIS] So I guess that
means they're all just

352
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,833
a bunch of puppets, aren't they?

353
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:32,958
[CHLOE] We'll have to
take 'em down ourselves.

354
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,291
Ready, Princess?

355
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:37,250
Tsurugi. Athena, stay behind me.

356
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,666
Hope you're ready too, Val!

357
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,708
[VALKYRIE]
Right!

358
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:41,458
[CHLOE, VALKYRIE]
Logic Drive!

359
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,458
[CHLOE] We're gonna mow down
all these buggers at once!

360
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:52,916
Blade Sword!

361
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,833
Eight Foreigners
are still remaining!

362
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,541
Paradox Level is... 5.0!

363
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:17,208
5.5. 6.0!

364
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,625
[TAMAKI yelling]

365
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,666
This is our chance! Chloe, go!

366
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:50,000
Pleased to meet you.
I'm the team leader here.

367
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:52,625
It'll be my job to make sure
you don't get hurt anymore.

368
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:55,041
After all,
I'm a brilliant attacker.

369
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:04,875
Princess Tama!

370
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,875
[TAMAKI] Chloe! Prove that
you're ALCA's top ace!

371
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,041
[CHLOE]
Yes!

372
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,333
Get outta my way!

373
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:28,791
Paradox Level's up to 6.5 now!

374
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,541
[CLAU]
7.0!

375
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:36,833
[CLAU]
7.5!

376
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:40,541
Back to the skies, 9.8!

377
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,083
Situation contained.

378
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,166
[ALL sigh]

379
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,291
[NEMESIS]
So it all turned out fine?

380
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:56,500
[VERONICA]
Fortunately.

381
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,750
Zera's review session
lasted way too long!

382
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,833
No helping that.

383
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:06,458
I could eat this whole table.

384
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:07,375
[VENUS giggles]

385
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:08,875
Okay, everyone.

386
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:11,375
Dinner's ready to eat, so let's
go ahead and get started!

387
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:14,166
There's no doubt you all
fought really hard today.

388
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,666
But the only reason you were
able to beat that Foreigner

389
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,083
was a sudden stroke
of good luck.

390
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,125
According to my Logic,

391
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:22,833
the success rate
of the operation

392
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,583
was only eight percent.

393
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,666
Are you telling me
we won by a fluke?

394
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,125
No way!

395
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:29,541
Come on, Chloe.

396
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:32,166
We still beat the sucker. Right?

397
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:41,041
Well, we did it.

398
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:42,083
Yes.

399
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:44,791
But Yoshichika...

400
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,875
I'm just so sorry.

401
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:51,666
I know I'm the reason our
Trance didn't go very well.

402
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,541
You've done more than enough
to make up for that.

403
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:02,625
[ATHENA]
The thing is...

404
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:05,958
I have something that I need
to talk to all of you about.

405
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:12,083
I met the Foreigner
known as Lucifer.

406
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,708
You mean like, the fallen angel?

407
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:17,416
So he must be
the 9.8, isn't he?

408
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:20,291
[ATHENA]
He is.
