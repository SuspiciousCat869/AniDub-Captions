[CLAU]
That's right, sir.

It's the Paradox Zones.

The interference has
crippled their operations.

a massive influx of Logic

Right! Okay, let's go!

13

[PIERI] We've evacuated 49%
of the central precinct, sir.

[ZERA]
That's not good enough, Pieri!

Before we know it, all

One hell of a day, huh?

As of this moment,

00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:03,541
I'm taking charge
of the command center.

you're needed on the field.

Yes, sir.

[NEMESIS]
All right.

00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:18,541
[JARNO] Have the other

They haven't, sir.

29
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:23,458
We're reading Tetra-Heaven
Foreigners coming from all over.

30
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:26,208
Looks like every branch
is busy fighting them off.

31
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:30,416
Then I think we have to assume
we're on our own for now.

32
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,125
Attention Logicalists.

33
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:34,625
Remember, your first

the safety of our civilians.

35
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:37,875
To that end,

36
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:41,375
every Foreigner must be
captured and brought in quickly.

37
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:43,958
Your secondary task
is just as vital.

Close the Gate

I think I'm being insulted.

It's obvious what you are.

Just hand over the gate card.

So we can end this

Neither one, thanks.

321
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,625
[OLGA]
How cliché.

322
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:54,541
Ever the heroic leading man,
aren't you?

323
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,208
If you think you
can get through this

324
00:18:56,291 --> 00:19:01,708
based on guts and courage alone,
you're in for a rude awakening.

325
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:03,208
[YOSHICHIKA]
That's not our plan.

326
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:09,125
[YOSHICHIKA]
Sir. Permission to Over Trance?

327
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:12,416
He's joking, right?

328
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,625
No, wait!

329
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,333
There has to be another way!

330
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:18,041
[JARNO] Permission to
Over Trance is granted.

331
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,416
[TAMAKI]
Director! Please, don't!

332
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,083
[JARNO] This is a path they
willingly chose to take.

333
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:29,041
[LOGIGRAPH] Confirmed.
Executing Over Trance.

334
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:29,875
[YOSHICHIKA]
Ready?

335
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:31,541
[ATHENA]
Yes.

336
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:32,916
[YOSHICHIKA, ATHENA]
Over Trance!

337
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,625
[LUCIFER]
It's all come to this.

338
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:02,750
Despair or destruction.

339
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,541
If we aren't careful,
we'll be the ones

340
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:07,958
who are forced
to make that choice.

341
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,541
Let's see what they're
made of, shall we?

342
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,541
Logic Drive!

343
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:16,291
Twin Evaworld!
Twin Eleven Stars!

344
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:20,291
[YOSHICHIKA]
Benediction!

345
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,208
I don't know if this
gamble is going to pay off.

346
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:47,083
[OLGA chuckling]

347
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,458
Don't let that
give you any false hope.

348
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:55,125
I hear my Logic.

349
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:57,458
The probability of
my losing to you...

350
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:02,041
...is zero percent.

351
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:04,416
[OLGA]
Lucifer.

352
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,000
[LUCIFER]
Yes. Let's do it.

353
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:09,625
All for the sake of Paradise!

354
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:11,041
Stop them, now!

355
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,333
Over Trance!

356
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:16,416
Olga!

357
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,458
[ALL screaming]

358
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:17,541
[OLGA]
Now, we begin our journey.

359
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:19,791
To the very edge of our Logic!
