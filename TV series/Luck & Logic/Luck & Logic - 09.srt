164
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:53,375
I was under the impression
that you had no interest

165
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:56,083
in fighting on
either side in this war.

166
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,458
And that hasn't changed.

167
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:00,458
I'd much prefer to spend
my time enjoying this world.

168
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,708
But, I'm sure that
makes you anxious.

169
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:04,875
[JARNO]
You're right.

170
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,541
Having a Foreigner
of your immense power

171
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:09,916
strolling through our city
isn't the most comfortable idea.

172
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,166
[LUCIFER] And I would hate
to see anything happen to it.

173
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,375
If I join you,

174
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,375
we can work together
to ensure its safety,

175
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:18,541
and I can enjoy
all it has to offer.

176
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,458
[JARNO]
So you seek to coexist, then?

177
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:23,625
Very interesting.

178
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,333
[LUCIFER] I've heard that
there aren't many humans

179
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:27,000
who can make a Covenant.

180
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,750
I hope you have one available.

181
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,833
[OLGA]
Well then look no further!

182
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:34,625
Yes. Breakchild.
Olga Breakchild.

183
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,166
If you're after someone with
strength, then I'm your man.

184
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:40,041
[JARNO] We appreciate the offer,
but we can't accept.

185
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:42,500
That's too bad.
What's the reason?

186
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,166
I'm afraid we still
don't know enough about you.

187
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,333
We can't entrust one
of our Logicalists

188
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,333
to an unknown variable.

189
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:50,833
Hold on. What about--

190
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:51,916
[TAMAKI]
Shh!

191
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,791
Indeed.

192
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:55,041
What a shame.

193
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:58,791
I should have realized
I was being too hasty.

194
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:02,250
Then allow me to start our new
relationship on the right foot.

195
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,375
[LUCIFER] This is
the custom when humans

196
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:09,208
want to extend friendship,
I believe?

197
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,625
[JARNO]
Quite right, Lucifer.

198
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:18,958
I look forward to a
prosperous relationship.

199
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:23,333
[LUCIFER]
Olga, was it? I like you.

200
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,583
[OLGA]
I don't get it! Why?

201
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,833
Why won't you let me
team up with Lucifer?

202
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,291
Is it his past?

203
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:37,208
Quetzie was an enemy once
and he turned out just fine!

204
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:38,291
So it must be me!

205
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:39,750
[VERONICA]
Olga!

206
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:42,333
I need you to understand.
I'm not trying to stop you.

207
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:45,416
I would be happy to see
you enter into a Covenant.

208
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,791
In that case...

209
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:49,458
[JARNO] But I do wish
you would be more cautious.

210
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:52,166
After all, this is an
infamous fallen angel

211
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,041
we're talking about.

212
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,750
I understand, sir.

213
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:07,583
Hey, Olga!

214
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,291
Keep up the good work!

215
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:26,083
[SANDMAN]
Kick!

216
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:27,166
[OLGA grunts]

217
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,166
Nanahoshi isn't the only one!

218
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,875
Tsurugi entered a Covenant
right after they met!

219
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,500
So why?!

220
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:34,875
[SANDMAN]
Gut check!

221
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:39,291
Why can't... I have one too?

222
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:44,083
[SHINOBU]
Olga! Olga!

223
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,500
[SANDMAN]
Punch!

224
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:46,791
It'll kill him!

225
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:48,833
[OLGA] Am I not good enough
to Covenant with?!

226
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:52,666
If I can't find a Covenanter,
then why am I a Logicalist?

227
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,208
[OLGA grunts]

228
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:56,000
Olga!

229
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,458
Come on...

230
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,125
How do you turn
this dumb thing off?

231
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,541
[SANDMAN laughs]

232
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:07,041
[SANDMAN]
Punch!

233
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:08,416
[OLGA yelps]

234
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:13,666
[SHINOBU]
Olga!

235
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,083
Thank goodness. Are you okay?

236
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:18,291
No one asked you
to get involved!

237
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:21,291
What the hell?

238
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,458
[SHINOBU]
Listen!

239
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,625
I may know squat
about being a Logicalist.

240
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:26,041
But...

241
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:29,750
I do know that all life is
precious, including yours!

242
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:34,666
Ow!

243
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:36,875
[SHINOBU]
Talk to me.

244
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,208
What's the matter?

245
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,125
What's the matter?

246
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:43,125
Does it have something
to do with Lucifer?

247
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,916
[SHINOBU] So you just need
to know if he's someone

248
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,583
you can trust?

249
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,166
[OLGA]
Pretty much.

250
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,833
[SHINOBU] Then you should learn
everything you can about him.

251
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:59,125
The research department's
been trying to,

252
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:02,250
but they haven't found anything
solid in all this time.

253
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,416
I feel like
it's bound to fail.

254
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,208
That's unfortunate.

255
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:09,833
If only we had somebody
who knew him personally.

256
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:14,791
Wait, we do!
Yes! Thanks, uh...

257
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,041
It's Shinobu.

258
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,000
Thanks, Shinobu. Really.

259
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:18,958
[SHINOBU chuckles]

260
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:20,625
You're very welcome.

261
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:27,833
[ENLIL] So you've
come around, have you?

262
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:29,958
Don't get excited.
It's not what you think.

263
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:31,791
I'm here to ask about Lucifer.

264
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,333
[ENLIL]
The fallen angel.

265
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:34,166
[OLGA]
That's right.

266
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,291
What do you know about him?

267
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:39,041
[ENLIL] Only that I owe him
a debt to some degree.

268
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,750
If you're looking for his
weakness, I can't help you.

269
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,333
That isn't what I mean.

270
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:46,833
I'm interested in the type of
person he is. His convictions.

271
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:49,166
[ENLIL]
Now that is negotiable.

272
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,208
You already know
what my terms are.

273
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,916
Your "one day of freedom."
Is that right?

274
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
[ENLIL]
Indeed.

275
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,041
What do you say, young man?

276
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:01,500
You should be asking my Logic.

277
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:03,208
It says there's
a 50 percent chance

278
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:06,458
that letting you out of here
will end in some calamity.

279
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,541
[ENLIL]
Isn't your pride worth the risk?

280
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:12,916
All you have to do is open
this door, and fame, power...

281
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,750
Everything you've desired
will be yours to take.

282
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:19,833
One day.

283
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:27,250
[PIERI]
Emergency!

284
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,541
A Foreigner has escaped
from the containment facility!

285
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:32,750
He is believed to have
Trance Jacked a staff member.

286
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:35,291
[VERONICA] The Foreigner
in question is Enlil.

287
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,708
He's a handful.

288
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:39,166
[YOSHICHIKA] Do we know
who he Trance Jacked?

289
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,458
From what we're seeing,

290
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:43,416
Enlil's location and
Olga's Logigraph overlap.

291
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,500
Olga?

292
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,166
[TAMAKI]
How could this have happened?

293
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,541
[YUKARI]
Hate to say it...

294
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,583
But we all know how impatient
Olga's been feeling.

295
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:51,833
[CHLOE] Could he have
opened the cell for him?

296
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:54,125
[YOSHICHIKA] I'd rather not
jump to conclusions.

297
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:55,875
I don't want to
suspect him, but...

298
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:58,333
For now... It doesn't matter.

299
00:14:58,416 --> 00:14:59,583
[VERONICA]
That's right.

300
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:03,166
Focus. You still have
a mission to complete.

301
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,291
Don't worry, Chief.

302
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:05,916
We're supposed to
clobber him, right?

303
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,458
We'll restrain the
target and bring him back.

304
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,291
[VERONICA]
Good. Then double time it.

305
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:11,583
[CHLOE, YOSHICHIKA]
Yes, ma'am!

306
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,625
[YOSHICHIKA]
We're close. Stay sharp.

307
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:18,666
[CHLOE]
Okay.

308
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:20,666
[YOSHICHIKA, CHLOE yell]

309
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:28,750
[ENLIL]
Veronica! Come out!

310
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:31,625
You and I have a
date with destiny!

311
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:36,333
[ENLIL] This has been
a long time coming!

312
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:38,708
Jeez!

313
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,208
That's some lung power!

314
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,166
We can take him!

315
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,416
Just like we practiced!

316
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,083
[CHLOE]
Okay! Here goes!

317
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:47,166
[CHLOE yells]

318
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,500
[ENLIL]
I only want Veronica, not you!

319
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:52,833
[ENLIL]
Stand aside!

320
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:54,166

use you as their scapegoat.
