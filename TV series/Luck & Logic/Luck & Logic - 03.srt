Now, you had a question for me?

58
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,125
[YOSHICHIKA]
It's about Yurine.

59
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:56,625
She's been a Logicalist ever
since she was around 13, right?

60
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,916
[VERONICA]
When she was in middle school,

61
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,750
she left her parents
to participate in a

62
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:04,541
Gifted and Talented
education program.

63
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:07,375
That's when she moved to Naien.

64
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,041
Her dream was to become a doctor

65
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,583
that specialized
in Paradox Sickness.

66
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:14,375
She hoped that she would
be the one to find a cure.

67
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:19,666
Then, one day, her
Logicalist powers manifested.

68
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,375
She was pulled into
ALCA on the spot.

69
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,875
That must have been
pretty tough on her.

70
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:28,291
Actually, she never once
complained about it.

71
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,416
She accepted her
powers gracefully

72
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,000
and devoted all of her efforts
to protecting the city.

73
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,500
Whether she was a doctor
or a Logicalist,

74
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,208
she was still saving lives.

75
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,708
In other words,

76
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:42,000
it meant she was still working
towards her true calling.

77
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:43,833
Her dedication is
what helped her become

78
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:46,708
the youngest leader
in ALCA's history.

79
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,250
She wants to be the best,

and never compromise who she is.

00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:18,666
'Cause we're awesome!

163
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,541
Yeah!

164
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,708
Now let's see if the
other two can pull it off.

165
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,875
When it comes to offense,
they leave much to be desired.

166
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,291
That's true.

167
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:29,916
The center back and the keeper
don't usually put points

168
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,833
on the board.

169
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:33,458
Tsurugi, give Yurine support.

170
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,375
Yurine, don't hold back.

171
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,541
We're not taking this one alive.

172
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:38,250
[YOSHICHIKA gasps]

173
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,083
You want me to kill it?

174
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,125
That's not necessary!

175
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,375
Tamaki, let's
use our Logic Drive.

176
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,833
Venus, no... Hold on. Please!

177
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,000
[VENUS]
This is the Whip of Love.

178
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:56,333
Yeah. I know, but...

179
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:57,625
[VERONICA]
Don't hesitate!

180
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:00,458
[PIERI]
Danger!

181
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:03,291
Her Paradox Level
is rising rapidly!

182
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:04,416
[VERONICA]
Yurine!

183
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:12,458
[SUCCUBUS chuckling]

184
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,291
[ATHENA] Those were more
powerful than before.

185
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,708
We can't take
hits like that again.

186
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:26,166
[YOSHICHIKA]
All right. Switch tactics.

187
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,291
[ATHENA]
Right!

188
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:36,500
[YOSHICHIKA yelling]

189
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:44,541
[OLGA] No good.
He didn't hit hard enough.

190
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,458
[SUCCUBUS]
Damn you!

191
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,375
Don't think this is over!

192
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,250
[YOSHICHIKA]
She vanished?

193
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,708
[VERONICA]
Can you get a lock on it?

194
00:11:57,791 --> 00:12:00,708
The Trance Jack appears
to have been released.

195
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,958
So there's no way
we can track her.

196
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,458
[VERONICA]
Why did you ignore my order?

197
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:09,625
Tell me!

198
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:12,833
I apologize. I have no excuse.

199
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,208
[VERONICA sighs]

200
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:16,791
Go to your room
and think about it.

201
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:17,958
Hold on...

202
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:20,333
Did you forget what
you told me, Chief?

203
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:23,583
Yurine treats life as
precious, just like I do.

204
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:26,458
So how could you
give her a kill order?

205
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:29,333
Because dreams alone
can't save people.

206
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,875
Her hesitation allowed
a Foreigner to get away.

207
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:34,500
Which means even
more people are at risk.

208
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,291
Foreigners are still
living creatures.

209
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:45,791
So they have rights, too.

210
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:48,083
Yurine wants to
protect all life.

211
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,666
That's why she studied medicine.

212
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,166
[ATHENA]
Yoshichika... I love you.

213
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,833
[YOSHICHIKA gasps]

214
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:57,083
Well that kinda
came out of left field.

215
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,875
You have a deep sense
of compassion in your heart.

216
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,875
I'm worried for her. Tamaki.

217
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:10,625
Yeah.

218
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:34,666
[SUCCUBUS laughing]

219
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,708
Come and feed me
like the helpless cattle

220
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:37,833
that you are!

221
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,291
[PIERI]
I'm detecting the Succubus

222
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:42,708
in southern Naien District,
Area 05.

223
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,458
[VERONICA]
What about Chloe and Asuha?

224
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,666
[CLAU] They're not able
to re-Trance yet!

225
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,250
So how should we
move forward on this?

226
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:51,458
Tsurugi can't take it down
all by himself.

227
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:53,083
Let's go. Nemesis.

228
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,291
[NEMESIS]
Time to play rough.

229
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,833
[VERONICA]
You too. Come, Tsurugi.

230
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:56,375
[YOSHICHIKA]
Right!

231
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:57,541
[OLGA chuckles]

232
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:58,916
This should be good.

233
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,208
The chief puts on
one hell of a show.

234
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,250
[SUCCUBUS]
It's not enough!

235
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,291
Let me devour all of you!

236
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,333
What was that?!

237
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:32,000
I think I'll enjoy
this little party.

238
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:34,958
Tsurugi, I'm going to
take the lead on this one.

239
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,041
[ATHENA] In that case, let's
make sure that no civilians

240
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:38,666
are caught in the crossfire.

241
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:42,083
[NEMESIS]
Off you go! Restraint Bombs!

242
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:43,666
Fly, my pretties!

243
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,666
She's going all out
from the beginning!

244
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,500
[SUCCUBUS]
Pesky little insects!

245
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,458
[YOSHICHIKA]
Aegis!

246
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,000
[VERONICA chuckles]

247
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:03,125
Shatter.

248
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:20,416
With a Logic drive that strong,
no wonder she's the chief.

249
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,500
[ATHENA] Actually, that was
just a regular attack.

250
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:25,041
[YOSHICHIKA]
You're kidding me...

251
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:36,208
[VENUS] How long do you
plan to stay here?

252
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:38,208
[TAMAKI]
Leave me alone.

253
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:40,166
You're not lovely
at all like this.

254
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,041
Seriously.

255
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:41,958
[alarm wailing]

256
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,625
[PIERI]
Multiple victims onsite.

257
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:46,333
Requesting immediate
rescue team support.

258
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,541
[TAMAKI]
Let me go!

259
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:51,416
[VENUS]
You can't hide from this.

260
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,000
Come on.

261
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,000
[SUCCUBUS screams]

262
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,166
[NEMESIS]
What is this chick, a zombie?

263
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,291
Stop this!

264
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,666
The fight's already done!
Have mercy!

265
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,083
Careful.

266
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,541
I might think that you're
trying to give me orders.

267
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:26,750
[VENUS]
Don't look away.

268
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:33,583
He needs help, Venus.

269
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,791
[VENUS] This isn't what
you're here to do, Tamaki.

270
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,875
Stay focused on the mission.

271
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:51,833
Lowly human scum like you

272
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:53,833
should learn their rightful
place at our feet.

273
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:55,166
Is that so?

274
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,208
Well, I believe destructive
Foreigners like you

275
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:58,833
don't deserve leniency.

276
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,875
You think you've
already won, don't you?

277
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:06,625
Then try hitting me
in total darkness!

278
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,458
Yurine!

279
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,541
Hand over my prey!

280
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:17,125
[VENUS]
Whip of Love!

281
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,666
[VENUS]
Tamaki!

282
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,500
We can't let her
hurt anyone else.

283
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,083
Stand aside, wretch!

284
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,166
[VERONICA]
Come on, Yurine.

285
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,416
Just kill her
and be done with it!

286
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,000
[YOSHICHIKA]
There's no need to go that far!

287
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,750
If we don't stop her here,

288
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,875
she'll hurt people
somewhere else.

289
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:38,625
[VENUS]
I feel your pain.

290
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:42,125
I would choose compassion
over violence every single time,

291
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,083
if that were possible.

292
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:47,041
But, if my compassion
will cause someone else

293
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:49,416
to get hurt in the end...

294
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,208
Well then...
It isn't worth it.

295
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:54,958
Yurine, don't!

296
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,500
You stay out of this.

297
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:58,208
That is an order.

298
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:03,083
[TAMAKI] My one wish
is to protect the lives

299
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,541
of all living beings.

300
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,541
Nothing is more
important to me.

301
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:10,791
But to save some lives,
I have to harm the wicked.

302
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:13,958
I cannot escape this paradox.

303
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:15,416
So I...

304
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,666
I will choose both paths!

305
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,291
[YOSHICHIKA]
There's another way!

306
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:25,250
[VENUS, TAMAKI]
Logic Drive! Lover's Dance!

307
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:29,833
[SUCCUBUS screaming]

308
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:37,750
[NEMESIS sighs]
That's the end of that.

309
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:38,833
Tell me...

310
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:41,000
Do you think that was too cruel?

311
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:41,875
I do.

312
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,666
I won't ask you to accept it.

313
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,166
Your Logic is your own.

314
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,291
No one can decide it for you.

315
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:50,375
Still, the fact that we have
a mission hasn't changed.

316
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:52,291
Don't forget what it is.

317
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,666
I never found out what your
favorite food was, Tamaki.

318
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,166
So I thought I'd make
a bit of everything.

319
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,541
Yet the mood around here
still seems pretty sour.

320
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,458
[laughs awkwardly]

321
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,958
Duh. It's been like this
since this morning.

322
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:27,333
Jeez... sorry.

323
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,458
[chair creaks]

324
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:32,458
Everyone... Please forgive me.

325
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,000
Okay!

326
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:36,666
I've officially reached the
breaking point with this crap!

327
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,000
Get over it!

328
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:44,000
You're still the same person we
all know and love, Princess!

329
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,958
Right? Back me up here!

330
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:51,666
You've shown me that I can't
afford to lag behind anymore.

331
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,750
But I'll find the
ultimate Covenanter soon,

332
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:54,750
don't you worry.

333
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:55,916
Uh... Sure.

334
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,166
It's not like any of us care.

335
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,625
I'm gonna make some tea.

336
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:09,208
[TAMAKI] I appreciate you
trying to stop me.

337
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,583
And from this day forward,
I'll believe in you.

338
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,833
I'll believe in you, too!

339
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,208
We may all be different.

340
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:23,125
But when we put
our Logic together,

341
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,458
there's nothing
we can't accomplish.

342
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:29,416
Wow. Did you get that
out of a fortune cookie?

343
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,916
Gee, thanks a lot!

344
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,500
[ALL laugh]

345
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:34,166
[YOSHICHIKA]
It's not funny!

346
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,583
[TAMAKI giggles]

347
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:42,208
I'm picking up
a Foreigner presence

348
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,458
in Naien District,
Area 01!

349
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:47,500
The Paradox Level... is 9.8?!

350
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:50,833
What's the situation?

351
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,083
[PIERI] We still haven't
identified the target.

352
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,125
It's gone...

353
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:08,916
[YOSHICHIKA]
Vanished?

354
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,708
[CHLOE]
The hell's going on here?

355
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:14,541
It's probably because
we finished off the Succubus,

356
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,458
which means the Archdemons
will be coming after us

357
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:17,458
with a vengeance.

358
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:18,708
Oh, no...

359
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:20,500
This is all my fault.

360
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:26,958
Where's she going?

361
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,250
Aw, come on.

362
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,291
Just one more time?

363
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:42,458
Sorry. I don't think
you'd last another round.

364
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:44,625
[ATHENA]
Lucifer?

365
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:47,708
Well, hello.

366
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:50,541
You must be the Athena
I've heard so much about,

367
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:52,791
the one who helps the humans.

368
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:56,500
Don't worry.
The girl is unharmed.

369
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,708
I've just heard so much
about Trancing

370
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:00,666
that I wanted a taste.

371
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:04,833
Why are you in this world?

372
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:06,833
There's nothing
left for me back home.

373
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:09,833
So I thought I'd see what
this one had to offer.

374
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:11,375
From what I've seen so far,

375
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:14,000
I think I could live quite
comfortably here.

376
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:17,750
[LUCIFER]
After all... it is Paradise.
