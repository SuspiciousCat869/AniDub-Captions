Now where is Gordo hiding?

This weather irritates
his lower back,

so he decided
to stay home today.

I guess that means
you're in charge now.

with Hoshimi collector cards.

I am.

96
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,041
It's because of Mana, isn't it?

97
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,625
Correct.

98
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:13,500
That one is a wounded spirit.

99
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,041
But she's tough.

100
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,750
And protects herself
at all costs.

101
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:21,375
She can be as sharp and
cold as a sword made of ice.

102
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:22,541
And yet...

103
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:24,083
She's fragile, which is
the reason I chose

104
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,916
to serve her in the first place.

105
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,208
I've been a good
Covenanter for her,

106
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:33,000
but I've failed to
bring her any peace.

You're not giving
yourself enough credit.

Your support has truly
changed her. I know it.

109
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,291
I hope you're right about that.

110
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,291
This is hard for me to admit.

111
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:44,666
But I'm slightly jealous
that Yoshichika was the one

112
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,291
who connected with
Mana instead of me.

113
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,458
You're the type of person
who notices the little things.

114
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:53,708
Yeah. Like with your finger.

115

It's just a habit, I guess.

[laughing]

141
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,083
My Logic informs me
that not even a goddess

of Athena's talent

Let me think.

148
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,291
Perhaps you should
try connecting

149
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,291
to the other person more.

150
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,500
Connecting in what way?

151
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:29,958
Well...

152
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,833
Personally, I try to predict
what Yoshichika is feeling

153
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:33,958
in any situation
and then act upon it.

154
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,375
That makes sense.

155
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,916
Kinda like you're tapping
into his emotions, right?

156
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,750
[VERONICA]
Not all partners work that way.

157
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,916
So what are some other methods?

158
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,333
Just think about
Chloe and Valkyrie.

159
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,208
They don't employ
that type of strategy.

160
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:48,458
Yes.

161
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:50,125
It seems like Valkyrie
and Chloe always focus

162
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:52,375
on different objectives
when they Trance.

163
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:55,833
But what works for them might
not work so well for others.

00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:57,541
A solid observation.

165
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:00,291
Every duo finds their
own method, eventually.

166
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,000
You're right about that.

167
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,416
Don't worry.

168
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,000
You'll discover your own
Trancing technique soon enough.

169
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:08,958
First I'll need a
Covenanter. But who?

170
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:11,250
[OLGA]
Why wait, newbie?

171
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:13,458
All you need is to Trance
with yours truly,

172
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,125
and let my genius
take care of you!

173
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,333
Like you have any.

174
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,833
I think Olga is pretty amazing.

175
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,583
I've always really
admired people

176
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:26,166
who have that much
confidence in themselves.

177
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,541
All of the top soccer players
on the team I managed

178
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:30,125
were the same way.

179
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:32,375
They believed their
dreams would come true.

180
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:33,958
And I did too.

181
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,833
[OLGA] I'm happy that you
can recognize my talent.

182
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:39,291
Gives me faith that you're
going to do well here.

183
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:40,916
I really hope you're right.

184
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,583
I want to be the
best Logicalist I can.

185
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:50,208
Maybe I should take a page out
of the others' Trancing books.

186
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,250
Tsurugi's strength
comes from his empathy

187
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:53,833
and reasoning skills.

188
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,541
That won't work.

189
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,708
I'm not nearly
as smart as he is.

190
00:09:57,791 --> 00:10:00,250
Chloe relies on her instincts.

191
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,750
Still, no go.

192
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:05,750
[YUKARI] I wouldn't
be able to approach it

193
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,625
with Tamaki's tenacity.

194
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,583
And I'm definitely not
as level-headed as Mana.

195
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:14,958
I wish the answer
would come to me.

196
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:23,125
[YUKARI] A little pepper
should do the trick.

197
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:28,708
That's good!

198
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,541
Maybe thinking like a manager
isn't going to help

199
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:33,916
in this case.

200
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,041
[LITTLE QUETZIE]
Hey! Listen to me!

201
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:41,000
I'm cold! So very icy cold!

202
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:42,750
Put a cork in it, will ya?

203
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,791
[LITTLE QUETZIE]
Why are you so cruel to me?

204
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:45,791
I'm freezing in here.

205
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:48,416
[KITAOKA]
We all are! What a pest.

206
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,083
Okay, I hear you!

207
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,291
The heat will be back on
later this afternoon,

208
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,583
so just hold on till then, okay?

209
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:59,333
[KITAOKA]
I'm putting in for a transfer.

210
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,416
Hey, I have something for you!

211
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,750
[gasps]

212
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:06,541
[KITAOKA]
This can't be happening!

213
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:13,250
[KITAOKA]
Don't you die on me!

214
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,291
Hey!

215
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:17,791
Please wake up, little guy.

216
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,041
[LITTLE QUETZIE growls]

217
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,000
[YUKARI]
Just a little farther.

218
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:24,083
But I know Kitaoka would
appreciate some warm stew.

219
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,083
[YUKARI]
What's happening?

220
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,416
[YUKARI panting]

221
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,750
[YUKARI screams]

222
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:43,875
You're free?!

223
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,250
[QUETZIE] That dumb guard
unlocked the door for me

224
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:50,125
while I was getting
a little shut eye.

225
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:52,916
Kitaoka?
You have to release him!

226
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,375
Please...

227
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:00,208
You can't keep him Trance Jacked
for very much longer.

228
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:01,750
The results could be deadly!

229
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:05,125
[QUETZIE] You think I care what
happens to a pathetic human?

230
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:07,250
His name is Kitaoka
and he'd nev--

231
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,125
[QUETZIE]
I've never seen you before.

232
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:12,500
But I can tell by your outfit
that you're a Logicalist.

233
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:15,375
Yes. But I'm just
in training right now.

234
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:18,250
[QUETZIE] You need to be trained
to keep your mouth closed.

235
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,583
Unless you have a death wish.

236
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:22,875
No... I don't.

237
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:25,333
All I want to do is
protect innocent civilians

238
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:26,916
from Foreigners like you.

239
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,875
[QUETZIE]
Hmm... You're a very brave girl.

240
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,458
I bet you taste good!

241
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:37,416
My name is Yukari!
I'm not food!

242
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,208
But you're in luck.
How about some stew?

243
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:45,375
[VERONICA] This situation
is extremely dire.

244
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:46,875
So what do we do?

245
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,083
We have to take him out,
obviously.

246
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:52,125
Clau, Pieri, I need you
to begin the evacuation.

247
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:53,166
[PIERI, CLAU]
Right!

248
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,875
Chloe and Yurine
are still tending to Asuha.

249
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,875
So it's up to the four of us
to handle this situation.

250
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,375
[gasps]

251
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:02,750
[OLGA]
If I didn't know any better,

252
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,916
I'd think you'd
forgotten about me.

253
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:07,791
[VERONICA sighs]

254
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:10,208
Okay, then the five
of us will handle this.

255
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,708
[YUKARI]
Before I started training,

256
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:17,250
I was the manager of a girls'
high school soccer team.

257
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:18,291
Which means...

258
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:19,958
I looked after
all of the players.

259
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:21,625
I made sure they had
everything they need--

260
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,458
[QUETZIE]
What are you rambling about?

261
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:26,083
I don't care about
your boring life, human!

262
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,041
Get to the point or die!

263
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,375
Okay!

264
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,708
Well, basically my job was
to take care of people

265
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,125
that I looked up to.

266
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,708
[QUETZIE] You could have said
that from the beginning.

267
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:38,625
I believe I
understand what you are.

268
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,125
You're like a priestess

269
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:42,583
living to serve
the god she worships.

270
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:45,833
The actual title is "manager."

271
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:48,208
[QUETZIE] These "managers"
seem slightly less useless

272
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:50,208
than the rest of you humans.

273
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:54,291
As you can see,
he's holding Nanahoshi prisoner.

274
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,375
Yeah.

275
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,375
So how are we
handling negotiation?

276
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:58,916
We won't be.

277
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,041
[YOSHICHIKA]
Huh?

278
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,333
No time for that.

279
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:02,916
If he extends his Paradox Zone,

280
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,250
then this entire branch
will be demolished.

281
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:06,625
[NEMESIS]
It's true.

282
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:08,708
Then he can release as many
Foreigners as he wants.

283
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:11,958
What are you thinking?

284
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,583
We'll destroy the floor.

285
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:19,166
Some well-timed blasts will
drop them into the lower levels.

286
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,708
Are you just
assuming she's gonna

287
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,500
magically survive
that kinda fall?

288
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:24,750
It's your job to
make sure she does.

289
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,291
My job?

290
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:35,000
Do whatever is necessary
to keep her from harm.

291
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,291
Are we clear?

292
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:38,541
Crystal.

293
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,083
[OLGA] Hey.
What do you need me to do?

294
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:45,000
[VERONICA] Oh, I have a very
important job for you, Olga.

295
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,458
Oh?

296
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:49,416
You will be the one giving
Nanahoshi her instructions.

297
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,958
Sure, I can talk her
through it, no problem.

298
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:56,500
Hold on.
It won't be from there.

299
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,666
[YUKARI] There's been an
increase of Foreigners

300
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,958
coming to our world
and causing chaos.

301
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,375
Why is that?

302
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:09,875
[QUETZIE] The denizens of
this world have forgotten

303
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,083
how to worship.

304
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:12,875
They praise only
their own progress

305
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:15,958
and attempt to bind
their betters.

306
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:19,458
That is what
causes us to rampage.

307
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:22,500
What about you,
little trainee?

308
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:24,416
Do you show reverence?

309
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:27,458
Yes. I do.

310
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:29,375
[QUETZIE]
Finally, a sensible human.

311
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,875
[YUKARI laughs nervously]

312
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:34,000
[OLGA] "We're carrying out
a rescue operation!

313
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,500
Buy us some time!"

314
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:38,583
[QUETZIE] Little girl...
Are you listening to me?

315
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:39,916
Yes, of course.

316
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,333
Hurry up!
We're running low on time!

317
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,916
It would be a lot faster just
to blow up the ceiling.

318
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,166
That is not an option.

319
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,416
Do you want them
to be buried alive?

320
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,208
Two more minutes and
we'll be ready to go, Chief.

321
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:04,125
[QUETZIE] Humans have lost sight
of their place in this world.

322
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:07,333
They need to devote themselves
to the gods through worship.

323
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:09,166
[YUKARI]
True.

324
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,125
[QUETZIE] If you agree
to serve me loyally,

325
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,291
you shall be greatly rewarded.

326
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:17,791
However, I do not hesitate to
punish any unfaithful followers.

327
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:20,875
[OLGA] "We will blast from
below and bring you both down."

328
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:23,250
That sounds a bit dangerous.

329
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:24,708
[QUETZIE]
Why would I care?

330
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:26,708
All humans are expendable.

331
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,916
[OLGA]
"There is no other way."

332
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,083
That seems like it may kill us!

333
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,083
And I really don't
want us to die.

334
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,291
[QUETZIE]
Quiet!

335
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:36,958
How dare a priestess
talk back to her god?

336
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:39,125
[OLGA]
"Draw this out!"

337
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,000
Please, forgive my rudeness.

338
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,250
I swear...

339
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,375
I will worship and pay
tribute to you, Master.

340
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,416
And then you won't
need to punish me, right?

341
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,583
[QUETZIE]
I would not...

342
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:50,916
If you were speaking honestly!

343
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,958
You have the audacity to think
that you could distract me?!

344
00:16:58,291 --> 00:16:59,541
[OLGA]
Huh?

345
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,541
No! Get out of there!

346
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,083
[OLGA yelling]

347
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:09,583
[QUETZIE]
Insolent whelp!

348
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:11,583
Did you think me a fool?

349
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:14,125
You've been plotting
against me this whole time.

350
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:15,416
[YUKARI whimpers]

351
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,333
No... I haven't.

352
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,041
[QUETZIE]
You lie.

353
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:20,208
[roars]

354
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:23,458
Sorry, Quetzalcoatl.
We're out of time.

355
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,416
[YUKARI screams]

356
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:35,333
[QUETZIE roaring]

357
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,250
You okay?

358
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,333
Yeah. Thanks.

359
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,375
[rumbling noise]

360
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:48,166
[QUETZIE]
Who are you?

361
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,750
[QUETZIE roaring]

362
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,458
Nice. Don't worry,
you're safe now.

363
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:04,208
Stay right where you are and
let us take care of this beast.

364
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,750
Wait, don't kill him!

365
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,750
[QUETZIE yelping]

366
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,333
No one should die here.
Not even him.

367
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,041
This is it.

368
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,166
Say goodbye.

369
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,208
Wait!

370
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,791
This isn't over, Chief.
I haven't had my turn yet!

371
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,625
Watch out, Quetzalcoatl!

372
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:27,416
I'm calling for a time out!

373
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,750
Nanahoshi!

374
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,875
Here goes nothing!

375
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:39,875
Aegis!

376
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:07,583
[QUETZIE]
You...

377
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:09,916
Why did you protect me?

378
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Because... it's part of my job.

379
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:16,208
A good manager always...
protects her team.

380
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,833
[QUETZIE]
What? You make no sense.

381
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,791
What reason is that
to risk your life?

382
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:23,625
I didn't want someone to die.

383
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:24,958
Even you.

384
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:29,000
So I stepped in.
For my teammate.

385
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,333
Rescue team, stat!

386
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,833
[VERONICA]
You all right?

387
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:47,791
Don't worry about me.
Go check on Kitaoka.

388
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,875
Yes. He's fine.

389
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:51,666
Strange...

390
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,125
Logicalists aren't
such pushovers.

391
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,458
How intriguing.

392
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:58,583
I'll accept defeat
this time, Lucifer.

393
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:10,666
[YUKARI laughing]

394
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,041
Hey, little girl.

395
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:13,958
Are you really a trainee?

396
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:15,500
Yes, I wasn't lying about that.

397
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:17,916
All right,
that settles it then.

398
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,250
I'll allow you to
be my priestess.

399
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,041
Are you ready?

400
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,458
[LOGIGRAPH]
Trance Session.

401
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,000
[LOGIGRAPH]
Activation.

402
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:47,541
[YUKARI laughing]

403
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:50,666
Whoa!

404
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,666
Way to go, girl,
you're doing awesome!

405
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,875
So, uh...

406
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:56,041
What happened while
we were at the hospital?

407
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,375
It's kind of a long story.

408
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,208
[YUKARI laughing]

409
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:01,916
Well, my Logic was right.

410
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,083
It said she'd pull it off
and she did just that.

411
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:07,125
But her potential
is still nothing

412
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:09,375
compared to the power
that I possess.

413
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:10,416
[CHLOE]
Mm-hmm.

414
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,666
Now you just
have to apply yourself.

415
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:15,416
So...

416
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,541
How do you feel... about them?

417
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:20,333
It's sorta like one's the brakes
and the other's the gas pedal.

418
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:23,291
I actually think they
complement each other well.

419
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:26,166
Do you honestly believe
we can trust Quetzalcoatl?

420
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,166
[YOSHICHIKA]
I'm not sure about that.

421
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:33,166
But they get along,
so that's a start.

422
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,250
That's true.
I believe they'll do just fine.

423
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:39,458
[YUKARI]
Look at me! I'm flying!

424
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:40,916
[QUETZIE]
You aren't flying.

425
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,375
You're getting carried!

426
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,583
And I really appreciate
you doing that!

427
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:45,375
Thanks, Quetzie!

428
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:46,416
[QUETZIE]
Huh?

429
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:49,250
Is everything okay, Quetzie?

430
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:52,708
[QUETZIE] Call me Quetzie again
and I'll drop you like that!

431
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:54,000
But it's so adorable!

432
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:55,625
I think it's perfect for you!

433
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:56,833
[giggles]

434
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,083
[QUETZIE]
I'm not adorable!

435
00:21:58,166 --> 00:21:58,958
I'm a God!

436
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:00,000
[YUKARI]
Well I like it!

437
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:01,458
[QUETZIE]
I don't care!

438
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:02,833
[YUKARI laughing]

439
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:05,208
She'll always
be a manager, huh?

440
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:07,708
Now acting as a
priestess serving her god.

441
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:09,083
I never would
have thought of it,

442
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:11,583
but it really is the
perfect path for her.

443
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:14,208
Can't let them
show us up, can we?

444
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,250
Right!

445
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:17,916
[QUETZIE]
Hey! Stop!

446
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,166
[YUKARI laughing]

447
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,916
[QUETZIE]
I'm tired!
