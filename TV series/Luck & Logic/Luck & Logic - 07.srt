1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,208
[SHIORI]
Vacation time?

2
00:00:14,291 --> 00:00:15,708
[YOSHICHIKA]
Yeah.

3
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:18,708
All of the Logicalists got
permission for an overnighter.

4
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:20,041
But is that okay?

5
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:22,083
Can you guys afford
to take a day off?

6
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:23,500
Yeah.

7
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:25,333
They have a rotation in place
for this kinda thing.

8
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:26,958
[SHIORI]
What's that mean?

9
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:28,541
Some Logicalists
from another branch

10
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:30,083
will cover for us
while we're out.

11
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:32,083
I think this group
is from Sapporo.

12
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:33,333
That's awesome!

13
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:35,333
Well, we'll have
to celebrate then!

14
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:37,500
He'll be coming
to visit us tomorrow!

15
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:38,916
That's wonderful news.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,875
So I guess this
calls for a party!

17
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:44,250
[SHIORI]
We'll be waiting for you!

18
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:45,791
She's hyped.

19
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:48,000
[ATHENA] I'm glad you'll get
to see them after all this time.

20
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:49,541
Me too.

21
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:51,125
Why don't you
come along with me?

22
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:54,291
Is that okay?

23
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:55,666
Of course it's okay.

24
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,500
You're always with me, anyway.

25
00:00:58,666 --> 00:00:59,916
Can't wait!

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,291
[doorbell rings]

27
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:03,083
[YOSHICHIKA]
I'm home!

28
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:04,541
[SHIORI]
Welcome back!

29
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,541
Glad you could
join us, Athena!

30
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:10,875
Thanks for having me.

31
00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:12,333
Let's hurry upstairs!

32
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:14,416
Everyone else
is waiting for you.

33
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,791
They're here!

34
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:17,666
Everyone?

35
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:22,041
Happy birthday, Yoshichika!

36
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:27,541
You didn't tell me that
today was your birthday!

37
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:29,875
That's because it isn't.

38
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:31,000
[ALL]
Huh?

39
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:35,125
[YOSHICHIKA]
Shiori...

40
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:13,416
[YOSHICHIKA laughs]

41
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:16,916
You've got some
explaining to do.

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,791
I wanted to say
thank you to everyone

43
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,458
who watches your back for me.

44
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:21,708
But I didn't think they'd come

45
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:24,416
if I extended a
regular invitation, so...

46
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,958
I thought that having
a birthday on your day out

47
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,750
was a little too convenient.

48
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,000
Of course I was right.

49
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:33,750
Sorry about this.
Aren't you, Shiori?

50
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:36,000
Sorry, everyone.

51
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,416
It's all right!

52
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,500
I've been wanting to spend
some time with all of you.

53
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,000
Let's stay anyway.

54
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,625
[YOSHICHIKA]
Still, I feel bad.

55
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,750
I'm just surprised
that "Mr. Workaholic"

56
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:47,958
tagged along with us.

57
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:50,708
I heard my Logic's call,
and I answered.

58
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,041
[CHLOE]
Uh-huh.

59
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,125
[YOSHICHIKA laughs]

60
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,875
Hold on. Is Dad here?

61
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,000
Oh, no! I forgot!

62
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,958
He said he would
be home an hour ago!

63
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,958
[YOSHICHIKA] I bet he's
picking up women again.

64
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,416
[SHIORI]
He wouldn't!

65
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,333
[RENTARO]
Please, come on in!

66
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,125
[YOSHICHIKA]
Dad! Not right now!

67
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,416
--[thump]
--[YOSHICHIKA yelps]

68
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,083
Chief! How're you doin' today?

69
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:13,708
Well, that looked painful.

70
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,250
[NEMESIS]
Veronica and I were at the bar,

71
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,041
but your dad called
and invited us over.

72
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,541
Oh, right.

73
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,791
He told us that today is your
birthday. Congratulations.

74
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:24,916
[YOSHICHIKA]
Uh... It's not, actually.

75
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,041
[NEMESIS]
Huh?

76
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:27,500
Crazy...

77
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,166
I shoulda known Shiori would
come up with the same idea

78
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,125
as her old man.

79
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:31,083
Great minds, huh?

80
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:32,541
[laughing]

81
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:33,750
What's he mean?

82
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:36,208
We're way past that already.
Just let it go.

83
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:38,833
All right.
Now that everyone's here,

84
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:41,041
I can resume
preparations for the feast!

85
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:43,083
Is there anything
that we can do to help out?

86
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,833
Sure, if you'd like to!

87
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:45,916
Cool.

[QUETZIE]
Hey! Give me a taste!

90
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,291
Be patient.

91
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,833
[QUETZIE]
Feed me, woman!

00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,916
Princess! What can I do to help?

93
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,291
Oh, well...

94
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:03,541
You can, uh...
handle decorations!

95
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,791
All over it!

96
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,083
[VALKYRIE] Why do I
have to do these, too?

97
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,416
It's more fun to draw
than gripe about it.

98
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:28,125
[YOSHICHIKA]
Dad...

99
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:30,083
Shouldn't you be working?

100
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,875
Oh, but I am working!

101
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:35,208
I'm entertaining your chief
and the little lady.

102
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,125
Can't argue with that.

103
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:38,250
On that note,

104
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,625
what kind of work
do you do, exactly?

105
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:44,250
Hm? That's a secret, my dear.

106
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:47,291
[NEMESIS] Huh? Come on,
now I'm really curious!

107
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:48,541
That's surprising.

108
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:51,291
I never thought I'd see
Nemesis act so social.

109
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:53,666
I don't think I'll
ever understand her.

110

[TAMAKI]
It's ready!

111
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:04,791
So, uh, will your mother
be joining us too?

112
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,541
You mean you haven't
told them yet?

113
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,666
Uh, yeah, my bad.

114
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,458
Our mother got sick
and passed away

115
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:12,208
around seven years ago.

116
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:14,333
I'm so sorry,
I didn't realize.

117
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,291
There's nothing to be sorry for.

Kasumi would be happy
that you joined us tonight.

119

Whaddya say we turn the topic
to something steamy?

120
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,750
Is there someone
you've got a crush on?

121
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:26,875
Knock it off, Dad.

122
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:28,291
This isn't a
middle school field trip.

123
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,250
What are you so
embarrassed about?

124
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:31,958
You're all getting
to be that age.

125
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:35,041
I'm sure you've got 20
or 30 gals in your sights.

126
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:37,208
And I'm sure I'm
gonna strangle you.

Oh! Venus has the floor!

[VENUS giggles]

The people that I like
are all sitting at this table!

Aw, how sweet!

That includes you, Yoshichika!
Way to go!

133
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:54,625
Well, Venus is sort of
a "philanthropist."

134
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:57,166
[RENTARO]
Yeah? How about you, then?

135
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,250
[YOSHICHIKA]
Huh?

136
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:01,083
[RENTARO]
Is anybody here your type?

137
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,875
How the heck
can I answer that?

138
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,500
[RENTARO]
It's common courtesy.

139

I mean, come on, you're
surrounded by pretty ladies!

140
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:09,416
[YOSHICHIKA]
I haven't thought about it.

141
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,416
We've got our hands full
protecting the city every day.

142

[RENTARO]
Yeah? And? And?

143

[YOSHICHIKA]
That's all!

144
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:17,750
[SHIORI] Dad, would you
please get a clue, already?

145
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:20,458
Mom would never ask that
in front of houseguests!

146
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:33,208
So... I can try it first?

147
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:34,500
The answer is still no.

148
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:36,458
You'll just have to wait
like everyone else does.

149
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:38,125
Fine.

150
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,583
[TAMAKI]
That must be their mom.

151

If you were here with us,

152
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:42,875
I know you'd be very
proud of your son.

153
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,041
She's pretty.

154
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:52,041
We've made some
wonderful friends, Mom.

156
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:58,708
Knock it off. He'll get angry!

157
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:01,500
Why? This is a
big time improvement.

158
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,833
[YOSHICHIKA yells]

159
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:06,625
What are you doing?

160
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:09,458
Well? It's much
cuter now, right?

161
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,541

Can we? Come on.

I'm afraid that will have

Next time! You promised!

Hold up.

[LUCIFER] Don't scowl
at me like that, Athena.

A face like yours
should always have a smile.

It's as if our lives
in Tetra-Heaven

were nothing more than dreams.

[ATHENA]
More like a nightmare.

Don't you feel any guilt

for the century of
suffering you caused?

I've made up for that
and then some.

The land of the fallen was hell
in every sense of the word.

Why don't you tell me
what you're really planning?

I've already told you.

This world is paradise,
and I plan to enjoy it.

Exactly like you're doing.

[ATHENA gasps]

Just what are you implying?

Yoshichika Tsurugi, was it?

[LUCIFER]
Are you attracted to that human?

Be honest.

204

I know that a goddess
such as yourself

205

wouldn't choose a
male partner otherwise.

Yes.

Not that my feelings
are any of your business.

I'm rooting for the two of you.

Don't misunderstand.

Yoshichika and I are only ju--

[LUCIFER]
Temporary partners, right?

213
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,708
The moment the fighting is over
you'll return to Tetra-Heaven.

214

I'm sure that'll happen.

I refuse to.

[LUCIFER]
I believe differently.

There's always the option of

Men and gods coexisting.

That'd be an ideal world,
don't you think?

Speak of the devil,
and he arrives in the flesh.

Please don't engage him.

I'd take her advice
if I were in your shoes.

Why spoil the fun with violence?

call me immediately?

[YOSHICHIKA]
You just what?

here to enjoy this world.

[YOSHICHIKA]
He was lying!

Do you trust him
more than you trust me?

anything like that!

[YOSHICHIKA]
Whatever.

244
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,208
[YOSHICHIKA] I guess gods
have their own Logic, right?

245
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:19,666
A human like me
wouldn't understand.

We should probably
help him get to bed.

his way to bed eventually.

He does this all the time.

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,625
before you catch up with me.

323
00:15:55,708 --> 00:16:00,125
Oh. I forgot about that.

324
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,166
[TAMAKI gasps]

325
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:05,666
[ATHENA]
Ticklish there?

326
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,541
So, uh...

327
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,166
Yes?

328
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,208
[TAMAKI]
Did something happen?

329
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:13,291
I mean...

330
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,041
With Yoshichika and I...

331
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:16,916
Is that it?

332
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,833
[TAMAKI]
Mm-hmm.

333
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:21,708
[OLGA]
She was talking with Lucifer?

334
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,250
You heard me.

335
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:27,000
[OLGA] Man, you really
get on my nerves.

336
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,500
[ATHENA]
I explained it.

337
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:32,208
But I don't think
Yoshichika believed me.

338
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,791
I really am sorry.

339
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,791
It was our feud in Tetra-Heaven

340
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:38,458
that started all this
trouble for Septpia.

341
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,708
Humans have suffered
because of us.

342
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:45,083
So once we take care
of the problem,

343
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:48,583
I'll go back to Tetra-Heaven
where I belong.

344
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,291
It won't be much longer.

345
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,125
[TAMAKI]
I'm sorry you feel that way.

346
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:04,208
[TAMAKI]
It's my turn to talk, okay?

347
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:09,833
Tamaki...

348
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:13,833
You can't go.

349
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,833
Do you think
that's what we want?

350
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,166
No.

351
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,333
Where's this coming from, Olga?

352
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:31,750
I don't have one myself,
but you do have a Covenanter,

353
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:34,958
and she's put all
of her trust in you.

354
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:37,416
I was just concerned for
her safety, that's all.

355
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,666
That guy's no joke.

356
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,458
He's the most powerful
Foreigner we've seen!

357
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:43,375
A Paradox Level of 9.8
could destroy this country.

358
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,166
Of course I was worried!

359
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:48,458
[OLGA] And you decided to brand
him as an enemy over that?

360
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,625
Forget his Paradox.

361
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,500
It's not a scale of intentions.

362
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,583
Its only use
is to measure power,

363
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:59,791
and that can't tell you whether
someone is righteous or evil.

364
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,791
Yeah, I guess you're right.

365
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,250
[TAMAKI] Yellow-Dragon
Princess, Xiaolin.

366
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:09,833
Before I met Venus,
she was my Covenanter.

367
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:12,583
She ruled over
the dragons of Disfia.

368
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:13,916
Once her mission ended,

369
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,333
she went back there
to resume her duties.

370
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:17,916
I still think about her.

371
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,208
I can't help wondering how
she's doing these days, y'know?

372
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:25,166
If we had telephones
that connected between worlds,

373
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:28,666
I'd call in a heartbeat
just to hear her voice again.

374
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,250
That's really sweet

375
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:36,000
I believe we were
brought together for a reason.

376
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:38,125
If you leave once
the fighting's over,

377
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:39,958
how will you know what it is?

378
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:45,500
[OLGA] Who said that gods
and humans couldn't coexist

379
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,916
in the first place?

380
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,458
The fact that we're
from separate worlds

381
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:52,666
doesn't mean we have to be
defined by our differences.

382
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,500
It's not in my Logic.

383
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:57,833
[OLGA]
But you think what you want.

384
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:01,208
It's not my business
or my concern.

385
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,125
[YOSHICHIKA]
You're right.

386
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,708
I was a real jerk.

387
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:07,166
You should be
disgusted with yourself.

388
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,791
You're 100 percent
wrong on this one.

389
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:12,708
My Logic says so.

390
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:14,750
[YOSHICHIKA]
I'm going to apologize to her.

391
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:18,375
Good grief.

392
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,708
He's more of an idiot
than I thought he was.

393
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,375
--[door opens]
--Oh no...

394
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:23,666
Tsurugi, hold on!

395
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:30,041
I'll go see if Shiori has
fresh clothes we can borrow.

396
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:31,375
Whoa, hold the phone!

397
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:32,875
You can't go out
in just a towel!

398
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,458
[ATHENA]
It's fine.

399
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:38,791
[YOSHICHIKA]
Athena! I'm so sorry.

400
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,625
I made a huge mistake!

401
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:45,833
[YOSHICHIKA gasps]

402
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,208
What are you talking about?

403
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:50,458
[TAMAKI]
Idiot!

404
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:55,416
Seriously, how clichéd
can one person be?

405
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,375
[YOSHICHIKA]
I am so sorry!

406
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,708
You're still mad, aren't you?

407
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:08,916
[TAMAKI]
Of course I am.

408
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,375
[YOSHICHIKA]
I know it looked bad,

409
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,583
but I didn't mean
to see anything.

410
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,083
[TAMAKI sighs]

411
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:16,416
[TAMAKI] That isn't what
I'm mad about, you dork.

412
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,958
[TAMAKI] I'm not the one
you should apologize to.

413
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:24,458
Your lack of trust
in Athena really hurt her.

414
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,708
How the heck would you feel?

415
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:28,375
She searched for your Logic card

416
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,041
because she wanted
to be with you,

417
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,333
and this is how you treat her?

418
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,708
Thanks for the help, Yurine.

419
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:57,541
[YOSHICHIKA]
Athena.

420
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:03,541
Sorry. I was a
total jerk earlier.

421
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:06,625
I know gods and humans
can understand each other.

422
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:09,250
I was just upset.
I didn't mean it.

423
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:12,791
[YOSHICHIKA]
I won't doubt you ever again.

424
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:15,708
I trust you, 200 percent!

425
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:21,166
[ATHENA]
Thank you.

426
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,125
[ATHENA] I can't tell you
how happy I am to know

427
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:26,666
you feel that way.

428
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:31,375
[YOSHICHIKA] I look forward
to being with you, Athena.

429
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,833
So do I.
We make an amazing team.

430
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,458
I'm sorry, but do I know you?

431
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:52,083
You still don't remember her?

432
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:53,666
Nemesis!

433
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,083
[NEMESIS] Do you have any idea
how often she comes to see you?

434
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:57,125
[VERONICA]
Stop!

435
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,500
It's nice to meet you.

436
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:02,333
I am your subordinate.

437
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:04,166
Veronica Ananko.
