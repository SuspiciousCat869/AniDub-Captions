00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:23,416
That was a nice workout.

[CHLOE gasps]

6
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:32,333
[TAMAKI] Not only that,
he took his Logigraph.

7
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:34,333
Without clearance.

[CLAU] We've pinpointed
the location of his Logigraph,

10
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:39,625
but he's not responding.

11
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:42,041
He either cut off all
communications with us,

12
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,833
or the Logigraph itself
has been destroyed.

13
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:46,375
Its coordinates
have changed recently,

14
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:48,041
so it seems he has it with him.

15

[CHLOE] No use.
I can't get through to Olga.

16
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:56,250

I wonder what happened to him.

This is not a laughing
matter, Quetzie.

Maybe not,

but I think I know what
happened to your lost friend.

[OLGA]
Tell me something.

30
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:28,458
Honestly. Why did you
have my Logic Card?

31
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,083
[LUCIFER] I took it to help you
realize your full potential.

32
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:32,500
Simple as that.

33
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:37,916
Your fellow Logicalists
were treating you unfairly.

34
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,541
It reminded me of
how the other gods

35
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,750
oppressed me during
the Hundred Years War,

36
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:44,333
causing me to lose
my place in Tetra-Heaven.

37
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,458
[LUCIFER]
In my experience,

38
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,083
shaking off the
whole "evil" label

39
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:52,458
once it's been attached to your
name is damn near impossible.

40
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:55,666
And it's difficult to exist
when your own supposed comrades

41
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,375
don't show you the
respect you deserve.

42
00:03:58,458 --> 00:03:59,833
They will never understand

43
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:02,416
how brilliant of a man
you truly are.

44
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,375
Now why are you here?

Aren't you afraid to be
alone with the devil?

...that you had
something to show me.

Students. Professionals. Lovers.

They were all
surrounded by people

51
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:23,958
who took them for granted
and treated them unkindly,

52
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:26,791
which made them lose sight
of their own Logic.

53
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:29,250
Sounds familiar,
doesn't it, Olga?

54
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,000
[LUCIFER] I can hear each
and every one of them

Asking for their
heart's desire, Logic.

And I aim to give it
to all of them.

[OLGA] What kind of Logic
do they ask for?

Oh, no.

been taken prisoner.

[CLAU]
Hey, Chief!

I think I've figured out

for unlocking
the basement cell.

Was it Olga?

No, it wasn't.

73
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:15,750
The analysis logs
show that it was opened

the person who
was on duty that day

78
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:24,875
was the new transfer,
Miki Shinobu.

79
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,375
But why would she do that?

80
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,958
[YOSHICHIKA] I guess this means
Olga wasn't guilty after all.

81
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,541
Okay, so the plan is to
storm into the enemy's camp

give him back to us!

be too dangerous.

There's got to be
a way to grab Olga

You shouldn't
underestimate them.

They may deflate
that ego of yours.

I'll take that bet.

But if do I end up
fighting them and win,

hand over your Gate Card.

too afraid of losing,

That's it.

00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,416
And thanks to you guys, I ended
up losing that bet after all.

123
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,208
So Lucifer used his Gate Card

124
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:03,750
to allow you passage into
this world, is that right?

125
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,291
[QUETZIE]
That's what I'm saying.

126
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,375
Then he could have easily
let other archdemons

127
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,500
into Septpia without us knowing.

128
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,166
The question is how many?

129
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,250
What is that sneaky devil up to?

130
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,125

of sides should we make

to compliment Quetzie?

134
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,500
I swear I've already
told you everything I know!

135
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:27,000
Lucifer just provided a bridge
for me to come to this world

136
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,958
and that's it!
I promise that's all I've got!

137
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:30,125
[yelling]

138
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,416
I mean it is
possible that Lucifer meant

139
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,250
what he said about living
on our world peacefully.

140
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,166
But why volunteer
to work with ALCA

141
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,333
if that's his intention?

142
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,708
[QUETZIE]
This isn't funny!

143
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:42,375
I bet Lucifer asked
Shinobu to open the cell door.

144
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:45,791
[NEMESIS] He does have
a way with the ladies.

145
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,083
If Lucifer was responsible
for the break out,

146
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,291
then there's a high
probability that this was all

147
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:52,708
an elaborate trap
to get control of Olga.

148
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,750
[LUCIFER]
This Gate Card is the key.

149
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:59,083
With it I can save the
archdemons from suffering

150
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,875
in Tetra-Heaven's land
of fallen angels.

151
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:05,041
[OLGA] So then all of this time,
it was you pulling the strings.

152
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,791
[LUCIFER]
I truly never meant any harm.

153
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,416
I was trying to give
the archdemons

154
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,000
a new place to call home.

155
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:11,833
Nothing more, I swear.

156
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:13,625
It was not my plan
for them to bring

157
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:16,875
such destruction
and chaos to this world.

158
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:18,208
Please forgive me.

159
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,291
[LUCIFER] There's only
one thing I wish for.

160
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:26,416
A world where gods

00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:05,041
My Logic has been
speaking to me often.

321
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:08,916
It says I should not
protect ALCA or Septpia.

322
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,458
That I should create
a new world where Septpia

323
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,375
and Tetra-Heaven coexist.

324
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,041
A Septa-Heaven!

325
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:18,000
Lucifer and I will build
this new land together.

326
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,166
And lead the people to paradise.

327
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,000
[YOSHICHIKA]
Nonsense!

328
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:22,416
Open your eyes!

329
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,875
[OLGA] I don't have time
to argue with you.

330
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:26,958
Can't you see he's just
using you as his pawn?

331
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,916
[OLGA]
Be quiet!

332
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,375
I alone chose this path,
and I walk it freely.

333
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,666
There's only one way to find out
which of our Logics is correct.

334
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,375
You know it as well as I!

335
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:38,875
Now it's time to fight!

336
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:40,666
Attack me!

337
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,166
Or does the thought of
fighting a worthy opponent

338
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,958
frighten you?

339
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:46,333
I have no choice.

340
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:47,666
[ATHENA]
Are you sure?

341
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,833
[YOSHICHIKA] He doesn't
understand what I'm trying

342
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:50,000
to tell him!

343
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:51,833
So I'll have to teach him
the hard way!

344
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,333

[YOSHICHIKA gasps]

347
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:19,916
Disappointing.

348
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,291
[TAMAKI]
Looks like it's our turn, Venus!

349
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,583
[VENUS] Don't worry, I'll have
you patched up in no time!

350
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,875
[CHLOE] Hope you're ready
for a face-lift, traitor!

351
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,000
You're done here.

352
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,208
Detonate!

353
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:43,208
Activate Gravity Star!

354
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:49,791
[NEMESIS]
Not too bad.

355
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:50,958
[YUKARI]
Everybody...

356
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:52,041
Watch out!

357
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:53,750
That mass of darkness
is dangerous!

358
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,166
It acts like a black hole,

359
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,500
devouring anything
that comes close to it.

360
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:58,916
[OLGA]
Concisely put.

361
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:07,708
It'll save time if I
take you all at once.

362
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:09,666
Seven Star Strike!

363

You can't run from me forever!

Seven Star Strike!

370
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:41,166
Gather around me!

371
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,708
[YOSHICHIKA]
Aegis!

372
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,416
This power...

373
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,958
It must come from Lucifer.

374
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:02,500
It's both of our
energies combined.

375
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,666
I am the only
person here capable

376
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,416
of mastering Lucifer's
absolute power.

377
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,208
We are a perfect match.

378
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,208
[OLGA]
Fight's over.

379
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:15,833

[CHLOE]
What's his deal?

382
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,541
It feels like he's cheating.

383
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,708
Taking them down
was surprisingly quite easy.

384
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:32,750
[LUCIFER]
True. 

385
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,833
[ZERA] This attack
has caused so much damage.

386

Olga's on the move.

00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:41,500
Where's he going?

389
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,250
He appears to be heading...

390
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,500
...towards us!

391
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:53,208
He's here.

392
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,916
And on his way
to the basement cells.

393
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:00,250
[OLGA]
The time has finally come.

394
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,916
Get ready for the
sweet taste of freedom.

395
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,291
[JARNO] I used to have such
high hopes for you, Olga.

396
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:10,541
Your intuition in the art of
combat was without parallel.

397
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:14,375
Please stop what you're doing
and return to ALCA.

398
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,083
[OLGA chuckles]

399
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:18,833
I promise that you
won't be punished harshly.

400
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:21,250
But you will have to
leave with me immediately.

401
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:24,166
You seem to be
misinterpreting this situation.

402
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,833
I will not be returning.

403
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:29,375
I'm not your soldier anymore,
so stop giving orders.

404
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:30,916
Or else.

405
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,041
I can't let you turn Septpia
into a new kind of hell.

406
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:35,625
[OLGA]
I wouldn't dare.

407
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:38,250
This world will
soon be a heaven.

408
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,458
Now leave.

409
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:41,750
[JARNO]
I will not.

410
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:46,291
[OLGA] You'd be a fool to think
ALCA can save this planet.

411
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,375
The savior... is me.

412
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:50,500

You have my deepest gratitude.

Thanks to you,
I was finally awoken.

It was my pleasure.

00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:17,041
I need you.

419
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:24,166
[OLGA] It's time to make
the paradise you prayed for

420
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,458
a reality.
