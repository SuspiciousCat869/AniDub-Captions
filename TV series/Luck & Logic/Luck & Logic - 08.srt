[YOSHICHIKA]

25
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,291
It's such an
old-fashioned gesture,

26
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:34,583
not to mention problematic.

27
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:36,000
Let's talk.

28
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:40,333
We have a lab in Hakodate,
in the Sapporo Precinct.

29
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,458
Four years ago, Veronica
was being trained there

30
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:45,416
by a man named Ash Paxton.

31
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,916
That man was later Trance Jacked
by a Foreigner from Monolium,

32
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,125
an ice belva, to be precise.

33
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:54,583
This destroyed his personality.

34
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,791
His Paradox Sickness was severe,

35
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:59,875
and the higher-ups decided
he should be quarantined.

36
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:01,416
So they stuck him
in the basement

37
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,625
of the Central Hospital.

38
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:06,666
They found him easier
to forget about that way.

39
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,500
That's harsh.

40
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:11,750
It was out of my hands, but I
tried to make the most of it.

41
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:14,458
Veronica's wellbeing
was my top concern.

42
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,750
I decided she would
be better off here.

43
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:21,416
Three days ago,
a team from headquarters

44
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,000
started a follow-up
investigation.

45
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:25,583
And that same day,

46
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,625
Ash was moved back to the lab,
despite his condition.

47
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,625
When he arrived,
the ice belva,

48
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,083
which was under
tight containment,

00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,083
reportedly started going wild.

50
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,500
I find that rather odd.
Don't you?

51
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,791
Bring her back. For me.

52
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:50,666
[QUETZIE] I don't get why I'm
being forced to go on this trip!

53
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,458
I brought plenty of things for
us to snack on for the ride!

54
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:57,458
And Sapporo is pretty famous
for its tasty morsels!

55
00:04:57,541 --> 00:05:00,041
Oh my word,
they all look so yummy!

56
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,666
You know that I have
no interest in human food.

57
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,541
There's gotta be something
there that you'll like, Quetzie.

58
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:06,166

might work.

00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,291
Marimo, huh?

62
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:13,291
Well is it still alive,
at least?

63
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,375
Yeah, uh... Probably.

72
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,625
I mean, for her to leave
without saying a word...

73
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:39,875

00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:49,000
[YOSHICHIKA] So the chief's
at the top of this tower, huh?

164
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:52,625
Let's think.
We have to find a way up there.

165
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:54,000
[ATHENA]
Okay.

166
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:57,333
Not if I have anything
to say about it, you won't.

167
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:02,708
What're those?

168
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:03,541
[YOSHICHIKA]
Run!

169
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:04,666
[ATHENA]
Right!

170
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,791
[BOTH gasp]

171
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:09,833
Oh, no!

172
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,208
[ATHENA]
Why are they after us?

173
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:14,250
[YOSHICHIKA]
I don't know.

174
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,416
But I won't let them
get near you.

175
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,416
[ATHENA]
On your left! Look out!

176
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:26,833
[ATHENA screams]

177
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:27,666
[YOSHICHIKA]
Athena!

178
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,291
[ATHENA screaming]

179
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,125
[YOSHICHIKA]
Trance!

180
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:45,416
[ATHENA]
Are you okay?

181
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,958
[YOSHICHIKA]
Uh... Yeah.

182
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,125
[ATHENA]
That was a pretty nasty fall.

183
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,583
[YOSHICHIKA]
What about you? You okay?

184
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:53,833
[ATHENA]
I am.

185
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:55,250
[crashing noise]

186
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,833
[crashing noise]

187
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,750
[ATHENA]
What is this?

188
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:17,583
[YOSHICHIKA]
They're all dead.

189
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:18,958
Terrible.

190
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,875
Yeah.

191
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,666
Pieri, can you do it?

192
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,083
Sir...

193
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:27,166
No matter how tight the Hakodate
Lab's security might be,

194
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,958
it'll be nothing compared
to Central Bank's

195
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,375
underground vault.

196
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:35,041
How would you know that?

197
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,291
Last one.

198
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:39,458
This secret lab is about
to be a lot less secret!

199
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:45,291
[BELVA growling]

200
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,041
[LAB STAFF 8A]
This is not good!

201
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,125
[LAB STAFF 8B] Chief Orlov, the
Belva's rejected the Trancing!

202
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:52,708
Performing an Over Trance
at this point

203
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:54,125
would kill him for sure!

204
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:55,125
[ORLOV]
Keep going!

205
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,000
If you won't do it
for all mankind,

206
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,708
then at least
follow my damn orders!

207
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:01,458
[LAB STAFF 8C]
We have to shut it down!

208
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:03,041
Do not interfere!

209
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:06,958
I can do it.
If anyone can, it's me.

210
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:09,791
I'll control.
Over Trance.

211
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:14,125
I'll protect us. I promise.

212
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,625
This is for our future!

213
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:22,250
He's gone?

214
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,416
Well, his humanity is.

215
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,083
He went too far and now
all that's left of him...

216
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,708
...is tragedy.

217
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,583
You mean the Belva was...

218
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:32,875
[ZERA]
You saw what happened.

219
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:36,250
I need you to rendezvous
with Tsurugi and Athena ASAP.

220
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:37,916
[YUKARI]
Yes sir.

221
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,458
Quetzie, the chief's in danger!

222
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:41,875
This is no time for you
to have a leisurely meal!

223
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:42,875
[QUETZIE choking]

224
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:45,166
We have to hurry!
Choke it down!

225
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:48,791
[ATHENA] Does Chief Veronica
know about what happened?

226
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,125
She's cut off all
communications with us.

227
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:54,125
[ZERA] I've dispatched
Nanahoshi and Quetzalcoatl.

228
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,500
Once you're all together,

229
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,291
you'll have to inform
the chief of the situation.

230
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,166
Right.

231
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,666
[JARNO]
Listen.

232
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,000
You're the only ones with
a shot at reaching her before...

233
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,083
...she does something
she'll regret.

234
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:05,333
Yes, sir!

235
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:06,791
[YUKARI, QUETZIE screaming]

236
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,083
[QUETZIE] I'm getting dizzy
and freezing to death

237
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:09,166
at the same time!

238
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,916
[YUKARI]
Hang on! You can do it!

239
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,208
[YUKARI screaming]

240
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,375
Where are the others?
I don't see them!

241
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,416
[screaming continues]

242
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:26,333
This is about to go bad!

243
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,541
[YUKARI, QUETZIE screaming]

244
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:32,583
[crash]

245
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,083
[YUKARI]
That coulda gone better.

246
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,625
Quetzie, you still in one piece?

247
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:39,750
[QUETZIE groans]

248
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,708
[ATHENA]
Yukari?

249
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,833
Wow, I can't believe
we actually found you!

250
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,666
Thank goodness you're both okay!

251
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,708
[YUKARI gasps]

252
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:48,416
[ATHENA]
Are you all right?

253
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,458
[YUKARI]
Uh-huh!

254
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:54,083
[YUKARI]
Hold on.

255
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,125
These Foreigners...

256
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:58,125
It looks like they're all dead!

257
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:02,375
[YUKARI]
Quetzie!

258
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:03,375
[QUETZIE]
Huh?

259
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,333
How long do you
plan to lie there?

260
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:07,750
We have to go stop
Chief Veronica!

261
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:12,083
[YUKARI]
Here we go!

262
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,916
[BELVA growling]

263
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,083
[VERONICA]
I will avenge you.

264
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:26,583
[BELVA growling]

265
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:30,750
[VERONICA]
You won't leave alive, Belva!

266
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,000
Nemesis!

267
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:35,416
[NEMESIS]
Madness! Fury! Intimidation!

268
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,250
[YUKARI]
Gotta go faster!

269
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:41,333
The tower won't hold!

270
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:42,958
[YOSHICHIKA]
We have to split up.

271
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:45,041
I'll find the chief
and tell her the truth.

272
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:47,708
You go on and look for
the missing Logic Cards!

273
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:48,708
[YUKARI]
You got it.

274
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:50,041
[YOSHICHIKA]
Now!

275
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:50,708
[YUKARI] Please make sure
she doesn't do anything

276
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:51,708
she'll regret!

277
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,291
[YOSHICHIKA]
I will! Don't worry!

278
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:56,375
[YUKARI] I'm gonna find
those Cards no matter what!

279
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:57,666
[YOSHICHIKA]
Counting on it!

280
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,750
Oh, no!

281
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:05,666
Damn it!

282
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:09,083
Nemesis.
Let's hit him hard! Now!

283
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:11,125
[NEMESIS]
Prepare to be exterminated!

284
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:14,583
Jealousy, Trepidation, and
refreshments at no extra charge!

285
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,041
[VERONICA]
Take this!

286
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,958
[NEMESIS]
All-Star Bombs!

287
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:21,791
Even more!

288
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:23,666
Give it your all!

289
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:31,708
[VERONICA]
Tsurugi?

290
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,416
Chief, don't do it!

291
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,750
You have to stand down!

292
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,166
[VERONICA]
Get out of the way!

293
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:39,041
That thing destroyed Ash's mind!

294
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:40,166
[YOSHICHIKA]
No!

295
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,208
The belva is the real victim!

296
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:46,083
It was Ash and the lab chief,
Orlov, who destroyed its mind!

297
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:49,583
[VERONICA]
Like I'd ever believe that.

298
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,916
Even if you saw it
with your own eyes?

299
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,375
Do not interfere!

300
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,541
I can do it!

301
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,708
If anyone can, it's me!

302
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:02,166
[VERONICA]
What is this?

303
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,833
It's impossible!

304
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:13,375
[YOSHICHIKA]
We gotta go!

305
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:18,333
[VERONICA]
Ash!

306
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,625
Instructor!

307
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:30,625
[ORLOV chuckles]
Perfect.

308
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:33,458
All the evidence
goes up in smoke.

309
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:42,916
[VERONICA]
Thank goodness.

310
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,541
[YOSHICHIKA]
No, Chief! Don't!

311
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,083
Orlov and Ash were experimenting

312
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,250
with some kind of
artificial Over Trance

313
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:56,958
and they took it way too far!

314
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:59,458
The belva isn't the enemy!

315
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:00,250
Chief, stop!

316
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,458
[NEMESIS]
Yoshichika!

317
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,666
That's enough.

318
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,250
I'm with you. Let's end this.

319
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:07,666
When I was all alone,

320
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:11,125
Ash took me under his wing
and he never abandoned me.

321
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:13,041
He saved my life!

322
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,583
[ASH]
Veronica...

323
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:24,500
Together, we're going to bring
an end to this otherworldly war.

324
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:27,750
He instilled me with a new
sense of hope for the future.

325
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:30,875
He told me we were going
to save the world together.

326
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,791
He promised me!

327
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:34,958
[VERONICA]
And this monster!

328
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:37,541
No, please! Don't do this!

329
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,333
[NEMESIS]
Veronica.

330
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,000
[VERONICA]
Damn it!

331
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:49,208
The victim's... you?

332
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:50,333
Oh, Chief...

333
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:51,875
[YUKARI]
I'm here!

334
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,041
[YOSHICHIKA]
Nanahoshi!

335
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,041
[YUKARI]
I'm sorry I took so long.

336
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,125
Instructor Ash...

337
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:01,500
Forgive me.

338
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:04,250
Stop!

339
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:05,291
[VERONICA]
Stay back, Tsurugi!

340
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:06,916
[YOSHICHIKA]
I said I'd protect you!

341
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,333
And that's what I'm gonna do!
No matter what it takes!

342
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,166
I'm so sorry.

343
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,958
I could only find
one of his Logic Cards.

344
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,250
[YOSHICHIKA]
It's over now.

345
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:54,333
[ORLOV]
What are you doing?

346
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:56,916
I'm the chief of this lab,
you morons!

347
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
[JARNO]
Don't worry. They know that.

348
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:02,625
[ORLOV]
Director. What is this?

349
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,375
Orlov Tunguska...

350
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,375
You're hereby under arrest.

351
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:08,375
This is a serious
violation of the Accords

352
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,875
on the Treatment of
Otherworldly Detainees.

353
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:13,166
The courts will not be lenient.

354
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,208
[CHLOE]
Yay, you're okay!

355
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:21,583
I was so worried!

356
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:22,708
Hey, Chloe!

357
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:23,791
[QUETZIE yells]

358
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,083
I'm glad you
brought her home safe.

359
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:30,625
Thank you.

360
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:31,666
It's okay.

361
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,875
I hope we didn't
worry you too much.

362
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:35,250
Not at all.

363
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,333
[JARNO]
Hey...

364
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:40,000
There was no doubt in my mind
that you'd be back.

365
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:43,041
Director.
We have to talk about...

366
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:46,666
Something tells me that you
won't be needing this anymore.

367
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,833
Yes, I will.

368
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:50,291
I committed a major
disciplinary breach.

369
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,541
Staying is
out of the question.

370
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,083
What breach?

371
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:56,291
The way I see it, you went to
back up the Sapporo branch.

372
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:57,375
There's no reason you--

373
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:58,916
I tried to kill
an innocent Foreigner

374
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,291
and I almost succeeded!

375
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:01,625
[JARNO]
The belva will be heading back

376
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:04,708
to his own world shortly.
You aren't guilty.

377
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:07,416
I'll re-submit my
letter of resignation.

378
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,875
[ZERA]
Chief!

379
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,833
I'm sorry to bring this up now,

380
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:13,458
but it's time to conduct
member evaluations.

381
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:14,625
[CHLOE]
Me first!

382
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,625
I ate a ridiculous
amount of pizza today.

383
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,000
My clothes don't fit!

384
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:21,208
As a Logicalist, I need
to learn to respect my body!

385
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:22,958
She's such a disgrace.

386
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:24,333
[TAMAKI]
My turn!

387
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,541
I write really long letters
to my sister in Kyoto

388
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:27,750
every single day.

389
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,000
And because of that,

390
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:31,750
the Naien postal workers
can't take any time off.

391
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,208
Letters really are best
when written by hand, though.

392
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:35,375
[MANA]
Guys...

393
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:39,625
I snuck out,
in the middle of the night.

394
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:43,083
And I ate some... ramen.

395
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:44,291
Hey, Chief!

396
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:46,375
I'll write an apology.
I'll clean toilets.

397
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,250
Really! Whatever you want!

398
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:49,333
Me too!

399
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:53,125
I'm, uh... really sorry
for something!

400
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:55,333
What are you doing?

401
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:58,166
Are you still determined to go?

402
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,416
I can't.

403
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,083
See you later!

404
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:15,791
[VERONICA]
Tsurugi...

405
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:17,708
--Thank you--
--[CHLOE] I'll take KP!

406
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:20,833
All pizza, all the time, baby!

407
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:22,750
[TAMAKI] Ya know, I don't
think that's how it works.

408
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:25,041
[CHLOE]
What do you mean by that, huh?

409
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:27,708
[VERONICA laughs]

410
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:31,125
Yurine, Asuha,
and Nanahoshi, you're on KP.

411
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:34,000
Chloe, you're cleaning
bathrooms for a whole week.

412
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:36,000
[CHLOE] Knew I
shouldn't have said that.

413
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:38,583
[VERONICA] I think the two young
men should clean my office.

414
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:41,625
What? Aw, man...

415
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,208
I wasn't supposed
to be here today.

416
00:22:45,291 --> 00:22:47,166
Victim of fate.

417
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,708
This sucks.

418
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:51,375
[ZERA] You need to learn not
to sweat the small stuff, kid.

419
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:52,250
Lighten up!

420
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:53,625
[YOSHICHIKA]
Yeah, I'll try.

421
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:56,083
[ZERA] Now, I wanna hear
every detail about Sapporo!

422
00:22:59,916 --> 00:23:02,625
Fly, fly away peaceful birds.

423
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:06,458
[YOSHICHIKA]
What's she saying?

424
00:23:06,541 --> 00:23:10,208
Give us hope that we too
may soar far above our burdens.

425
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:11,708
Majestic and free.

426
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:13,666
Unencumbered by doubt.

427
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:17,291
In a sea of clouds
unafraid of falling.

428
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:18,541
You know what?

429
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:20,958
If the chief needs me,
I'm glad to help out.

430
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:22,750
[NEMESIS]
They might not be geniuses,

431
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:25,750
and they screw up a lot, but
they're really not a bad bunch.

432
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:28,750
They're exactly as stubborn
as they are resourceful.

433
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:30,833
And maybe that's
just what you need.

434
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:33,583
They're your comrades
and your children.

435
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:36,500
Yeah. They really are.
