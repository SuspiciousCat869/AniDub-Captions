00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:38,958
Oh, okay. Just a dream.

9
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:40,708
Is there any chance
that you were dreaming

10
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,625
about the two of us?

11

[YOSHICHIKA]
How'd you know?

12
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:47,375
Because to be honest,
I was dreaming about you, too.

13
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:48,833
That's kinda crazy.

14

It's quite common, actually.

Now that the two of us
have Tranced together,

Yeah, that's right.

18
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:58,375
So what happened in your dream?

[ATHENA giggles]

20
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:02,500
That's my little secret.

This is unexpected.

for the next

Since you're technically
a new member to the chapter,

It's a pleasure to meet you.

00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:50,958
I came to deliver a message.

43
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:52,458
My Logic tells me

44
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:56,500
you will come to great
harm during your trial.

45
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:59,458
And it's never been wrong.
Not even once.

46
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:04,666
So what's his problem?

47
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,333
[JARNO laughs]
I wouldn't worry about him.

[CHLOE]
Really?

51
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,333
Why do we have to be here?

52

[VERONICA] Because it's
a review for everyone.

[YUKARI]
Oh, uh, yes, ma'am!

[YOSHICHIKA]
Excuse me, Chief?

I'm pretty sure somebody is
missing from the classroom.

I don't see Olga.

No! I hate these quizzes.

You did study, right?

67
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,791
Let us begin.

68
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:18,916
First question--

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,166
I wouldn't worry.
You'll do just fine.

70
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,833
The world we are currently
on is called Septpia.

71
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,875
But there are many realms
exactly like it

72
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:28,541
that are inhabited by
powerful gods and dragons.

73
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:30,083
That said,

74
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,416
which one of these realms has
been attacking Naien lately?

75
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:37,541
A: Monolium. B: Disfia.
C: Tetra-Heaven.

76
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:43,083
'Cept for Chloe, correct.

77
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:45,833
Val, didn't all of you goddesses

78
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:47,500
I mean, yeah.

I know! Here!

80
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:52,291
I've been doing
some research on this.

81
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,416
The archdemons fought
a hundred-year war

82
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,333
against the goddesses
of Tetra-Heaven,

83
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:57,708
and eventually lost.

84
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:00,375
After their defeat,
they found and unlocked doorways

85
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,750
which allowed them
to flee to other worlds.

86
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,750
That's why they're trying
to move to Septpia.

87
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,875
[NEMESIS]
More like invade it.

00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,083
Huh?

89
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,583
Anyway, the goddesses
followed them here,

90
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,708
and ended up joining the ALCA.

91
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:12,958
Yes. Good.

92
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:15,375
That was a very
well-phrased summary.

93

It's true.

97
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,375
That's why we have
to recover the cards

98
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,166
from any Foreigners we fight.

99
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,083
If they lose those, they won't
be able to move between worlds.

100
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:29,875
And preventing that
is our ultimate goal.

322
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:53,791
We'll talk later, okay?

323
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,583
[VENUS]
Fine, fine.

324
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:58,083
[YUKARI] So Chloe fights
as a center forward,

325
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:00,541
while Mana is more
like a side back.

326
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,916
And if Tamaki works
as the center back,

327
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,208
then that would leave
Tsurugi as the keeper

328
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:06,375
of our little team.

329
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:09,000
Hey, soccer girl, take a break.

330
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,875
[YUKARI] I'm sorry,
but are you talking to me?

331
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:12,458
[NEMESIS]
No matter how hard you study,

332
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:14,375
it's pointless
without a Covenanter.

333
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:15,833
[YUKARI]
Oh. Right.

334
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:18,208
Well then I'll try harder
to find a Trancing partner.

335
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:19,333
[NEMESIS]
Uh-huh.

336
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:20,416
[YUKARI]
Excuse me...

337
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,083
Can I ask you a question, Chief?

338
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:23,083
Ask away.

339
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:24,625
Well, I know that
a Trance occurs

340
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:27,416
when a Logicalist links to a
Covenanter to use their power.

341
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,625
And a Trance Jack
is where a Foreigner

342
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:32,791
successfully takes control
of an unwilling person's body.

343
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:35,750
But I'm still not quite sure
what an Over Trance is.

344
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:38,041
[VERONICA] That's not
something you need to learn.

345
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:39,250
Why isn't it?

346
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,208
[OLGA]
We're forbidden to use it.

347
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:42,541
[VERONICA]
Olga...

348
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,291
[OLGA] I'm sure you know
that every living creature

349
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:47,125
is made up of 1,000 Logic cards.

350
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,166
A Trance occurs
when two partners

351
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,291
combine half of
their Logic cards.

352
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:52,875
On the other hand,

353
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:55,125
when every one of their Logic
cards are used to link together,

354
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:57,166
what's known as an
Over Trance happens.

355
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,708
It's dangerous because
it causes both parties

356
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:03,375
to contract Paradox Sickness,
destroying their personalities.

357
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:04,875
How terrible!

358
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:06,041
[VERONICA]
It can't happen.

359
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:08,541
The Logigraphs
prevent any Over Trances.

360
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,833
But if for some reason
one is ever needed,

361
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:13,291
I'm in charge of
giving the go ahead.

362
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:14,791
[YUKARI]
That's good to know.

363
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,708
[OLGA]
But Mr. Hong Kong pulled it off.

364
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:20,791
[TAMAKI]
Finish it, Chloe!

365
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:21,958
Finally!

366
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:22,958
Valkyrie!

367
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:23,875
[VALKYRIE]
I'm ready.

368
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:24,541
[YOSHICHIKA]
Chloe!

369
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:25,416
[CHLOE]
Huh?

370
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,625
Wait... Asuha has him.

371
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:30,541
Hear that? Take your shot
whenever you're ready.

372
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:32,750
[TAMAKI gasps]

373
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:35,166
Oh, man! No fair.

374
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,458
[MANA]
Copy that.

375
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,333
Moon walk!

376
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,541
[MANA]
Artemis? You ready?

377
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,500
[ARTEMIS]
I am whenever you are, Mana.

378
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:56,125
[MANA, ARTEMIS]
Start Logic Drive!

379
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:00,458
[ARTEMIS]
At this moment,

380
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,416
a lovely poem
would soothe my heart

381
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,625
and nourish my spirit.

382
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,041
[MANA]
Here's one.

383
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,625
"Die, beast!"

384
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:20,291
[ZERA] Tsurugi's Logic influence
dramatically improved

385
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:21,458
the team's numbers.

386
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,791
Mental and physical levels
were cut in half

387
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:24,916
from previous trials.

388
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,166
Really?

389
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:29,708
Hey, good job!

390
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:32,583
I saw everything.
It really taught me a lot.

391
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,500
[YOSHICHIKA] You're always
lurking around in corners.

392
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:40,416
Why aren't you training
with the rest of us?

393
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,250
[OLGA] I completed that
simulation ages ago.

394
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:44,833
I don't need to practice.

395
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:46,708
So does that mean
you're the ace of this group?

396
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,875
You can call me that
if you want to.

397
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:50,625
[YOSHICHIKA]
What combat skills do you use?

398
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:52,625
And I'd love to meet
your Covenanter.

399
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,250
[alarm wailing]

400
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,458
[PIERI] Foreigner presence
detected in Area 08

401
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,416
of the Eastern Naien District.

402
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,541
Paradox Level is at 1.1.

403
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:04,833
[ALL gasp]

404
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,958
[CHLOE] Seriously?
That's not much of a threat.

405
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:09,083
[VERONICA] So only one
of you will be needed.

406
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:11,375
Tsurugi. Head out.

407
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:12,500
Why me?

408
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:13,875
[VERONICA]
The girls need to rest.

409
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,708
Yesterday's fight
took a lot out of them.

410
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:17,833
They are drained both
mentally and physically.

411
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:18,875
Makes sense.

412
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:20,375
But I'm still pretty new
around here.

413
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,291
Shouldn't Olga go instead?

414
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,041
Don't question me. Just go.

415
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,666
That's a direct order.

416
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,083
[YOSHICHIKA]
I don't get it.

417
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:32,166
When is this guy gonna
have to do something?

418
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,000
[NEMESIS]
Technically he is a Logicalist,

419
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:36,250
but also kinda not one.

420
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:39,333
Huh? What's that
supposed to mean?

421
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:43,250
[YOSHICHIKA] He's hiding
something. He must be.

422
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:53,500
[YOSHICHIKA]
What's the deal with Olga?

423
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:57,916
[ATHENA] Stop thinking about him
and concentrate on our mission.

424
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:00,666
[YOSHICHIKA]
You're right.

425
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,250
Let's do this.

426
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:17,291
[SANDMAN]
Now, children.

427
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,416
Bring me all your candy. Do it!

428
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,750
Unless you want
a face full of sand!

429
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:24,250
Really, now?

430
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,916
Stop picking on the children.

431
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,583
I'm sorry. Have mercy.

432
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:31,541
Fine. Just release
your Trance, okay?

433
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:33,208
[SANDMAN chuckles]

434
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:34,375
Gotcha!

435
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,166
[SANDMAN]
Huh?

436
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,916
Please cooperate,
little guy. Or else.

437
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,041
[SANDMAN sighs]
You win.

438
00:19:58,208 --> 00:19:59,958
Are you ready to rock?

439
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,541
C'mon. Let's go.

440
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,500
[YOSHICHIKA]
What are you doing here?

441
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:08,958
[YOSHICHIKA]
Are you gonna answer, or not?

442
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,250
[ATHENA]
Please leave him alone.

443
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:14,250
It's not what you think.

444
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,291
This is between him and me.

445
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:18,250
[YOSHICHIKA]
Again...

446
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,625
What are you
planning with Belial?

447
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:21,666
Just listen!

448
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,083
[YOSHICHIKA]
Huh?

449
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:26,708
Yes, he's a Logicalist like you,
but he's also not one.

450
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:27,750
Say what?

451
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,625
It's hard to explain.

452
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:31,875
He is a Logicalist...

453
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,833
But he hasn't located
his Covenanter yet.

454
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:38,458
[YOSHICHIKA]
What's his total Trance time?

455
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:39,916
[ATHENA]
Zero seconds.

456
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:42,875
[ATHENA]
The last two days,

457
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:46,208
Olga has been trying to
convince Belial to join him.

458
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:47,875
As his Covenanter.

459
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:50,000
[YOSHICHIKA] So everyone
acts weird around him.

460
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,416
Because... Well...

461
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,208
We feel sorry for him.

462
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:55,708
It's fine.

463
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:58,333
One day I'll find the ultimate
Covenanter to Trance with.

464
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:00,625
But until then,
I'll be more than happy

465
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:01,833
with what I have.

466
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,916
[OLGA laughing]

467
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:12,583
[YOSHICHIKA]
What's with this guy?

468
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,791
[YOSHICHIKA] Sorry I'm late.
Please forgive me.

469
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:24,041
[JARNO] I heard you found out
about Olga's little issue.

470
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,666
I wasn't trying to be nosy.

471
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,083
But he had said earlier that
some kinda "great harm"

472
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:29,250
was coming to me.

473
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:31,708
He has a talent
for predicting the future.

474
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:32,958
So be careful.

475
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,416
He's a fortuneteller?

476
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,666
Yes.

477
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,791
But let's address the
results of your trial.

478
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:40,375
Well... I'm going
to make some changes.

479
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:42,125
[YOSHICHIKA]
Hm? Changes?

480
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:44,916
He's making you the new leader.

481
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,083
[YOSHICHIKA]
Seriously?!

482
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:47,125
Yes.

483
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:52,083
[TAMAKI growls]
He's not fit to lead, sir.

484
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:54,208
He waited to apprehend
the Foreigner.

485
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:55,708
That was careless!

486
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:57,916
The Trance Jacked citizens
should have been saved first.

487
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,166
Tsurugi's actions
put human lives at risk.

488
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,041
He shouldn't be giving
orders to anyone.

489
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:03,750
My apologies, Tamaki.

490
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:07,125
But as the ALCA director,
I get to make these decisions,

491
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:09,583
and Yoshichika will
be the new leader.

492
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:11,041
[TAMAKI]
As you wish, sir.
