[YOSHICHIKA]
My faithful Athena.

321
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:01,083
I, Yoshichika Tsurugi,

322
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,833
make a solemn vow
to devote my Logic to you.

323
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:07,333
Trance with me.

324
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:08,375
Yes.

325
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:10,916
Here we go!

326
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:29,500
This ugly cow isn't
making it easy for us.

327
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:30,500
[TAMAKI]
Oh no!

328
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,458
We're almost at
our Trance Limit!

329
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:34,166
What? So soon?

330
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:37,250
It was obviously trying
to run down the clock all along.

331
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:41,583
[CHLOE gasps]

332
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:52,000
[YOSHICHIKA]
Aegis!

333
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:57,791
Are you all right?

334
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,250
Where'd you come from?

335
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:00,958
[YOSHICHIKA] It's using up
a great deal of Logic

336
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,500
on this heavy attack.

337
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,000
It's gonna have to switch
to another medium soon.

338
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,875
[YOSHICHIKA]
We'll only have a moment.

339
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,583
Don't miss this opportunity!

340
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:14,000
Who died and left you
in charge, huh?

341
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,375
[ATHENA, YOSHICHIKA]
Logic Drive!

342
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:20,708
[YOSHICHIKA]
Reflection!

343
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:31,541
Go now!

344
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:32,958
[CHLOE]
I'm all over it!

345
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,416
Cover me, Mana!

346
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:37,250
Are you ready, Valkyrie?

347
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,291
[VALKYRIE]
Copy!

348
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,208
[CHLOE, VALKYRIE]
Logic Drive go!

349
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:45,333
[CHLOE]
Last Final Finish Sword!

350
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,458
[LOGIGRAPH]
Trance Limit reached.

351
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,583
[YOSHICHIKA]
Trance release.

352
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,333
Athena?

353
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:23,333
Is that gentleman
your Covenanter, Athena?

354
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:24,291
[ATHENA]
Yes, he is.

355
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:25,375
[VALKYRIE]
You went with a boy?

356
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,041
Didn't see that one coming.

357
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,125
[VENUS]
Lovely!

358
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,666
I want one too!
[giggles]

359
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,416
Who is this guy?
An ALCA recruit?

360
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,625
Beats me.

361
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,708
He sure knew his way
around a fight, though.

362
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:43,583
[SHIORI] My brother's done
enough for you creeps.

363
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:44,666
Leave him alone!

364
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,541
You aren't welcome here, so go!

365
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:49,750
[YOSHICHIKA]
Shiori... wait!

366
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:57,000
I promise...
I'm not gonna do anything crazy.

367
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:59,541
Yeah, you'd better not.

368
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,833
I'm not gonna do anything
to worry you, either.

369
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:04,291
It's too late for that.

370
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:05,916
But this is
something I gotta do.

371
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,083
To protect you
and everybody else.

372
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:15,625
Make sure you do.

373
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,875
You better be the
stereotypical lead character

374
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,708
who always wins, understand?

375
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:23,333
If you lose,
I'll never forgive you!

376
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,041
Shiori...

377
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:28,750
I want our viewers to be bored
from how unkillable you are!

378
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:30,125
Me too.

379
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:32,500
Go get 'em, kiddo,
and visit when you can.

380
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:33,875
I will, Dad.

381
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:38,958
[JARNO]
Well...

382
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:41,916
I certainly admire your
single-minded devotion.

383
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,125
Though, I must admit that I
never would have guessed

384
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:45,541
you'd Covenant with him.

385
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:49,000
I'm really glad that I did.
No regrets.

386
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:50,916
[JARNO]
Indeed.

387
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,791
My image of him has
grown as well. Greatly.

388
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:57,250
[CHLOE] He was in Hong Kong
two years ago?

389
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:58,041
That's right.

390
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,375
He's also the only person

391
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,208
among the currently
active Logicalists

392
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:04,708
who has successfully performed
the prohibited Over Trance.

393
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:07,125
Is there like an
employee handbook?

394
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,500
Speak of the devil...

395
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:16,083
Let's welcome the newest member
of the ALCA, Yoshichika Tsurugi.

396
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:17,541
Nice to meet you all.

397
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,583
I'm looking forward
to working with you.

398
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:20,916
[VERONICA]
I'm sure you are.

399
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,333
This is Tamaki.

400
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:23,791
I'm the team's leader.
Nice to--

401
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:24,875
[YOSHICHIKA]
Sorry.

402
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:27,083
But could we pick
this up tomorrow?

403
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:30,583
I haven't slept since yesterday.
[yawns]

404
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:33,875
My Logic is begging me
to hit the sack.

405
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:36,041
Are you really
blowing off introductions?

406
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,666
Your room is this way.

407
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,125
Great. Thank you.

408
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,166
Unbelievable.

409
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:47,916
--[ATHENA chuckles]
--[door closes]

410
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,666
I think that one's occupied!

411
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,125
Didn't anyone tell you?

412
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:56,125
Living with your Covenanter
is mandatory around here.

413
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:58,833
It's proven quite effective
at improving our bonds.

414
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:04,291
I'm looking forward to it.
It should be fun!

415
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:11,625
[OLGA] You chose the wrong path,
didn't you, Yoshichika Tsurugi.

416
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:14,250
I can hear my
Logic loud and clear.

417
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,166
It tells me the odds
you'll meet the same fate

418
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,750
you did in Hong Kong are...

419
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:20,541
One hundred percent.
