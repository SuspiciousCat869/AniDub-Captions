[CHLOE, TAMAKI]
Missing?!

2
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,041
Well they're not here,
and it's past curfew.

3
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:52,125
We lost Asuha and Artemis?

4
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:54,041
I hope they aren't
in any danger.

5
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:55,958
There's really nothing
to worry about.

6
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:58,291
[YOSHICHIKA] You seem
awfully sure about that.

7
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:00,625
No, she's right.
They'll be fine.

[MOTHER 5A]
That was yummy, wasn't it?

10
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:09,458
[CHILD 5A]
Uh-huh!

[MANA sighs]

12
00:01:20,958 --> 00:01:22,791
Why don't we head home?

13
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:25,291
We don't want everyone
to worry about us.

14
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:03,833
[YOSHICHIKA]
Looking for her parents?

15
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:05,708
[TAMAKI]
It's pretty rough stuff.

16
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:08,833
When Mana was still
a baby, she was--

17
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:10,416
What happened to her?

18
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:14,458
She was abandoned.

19
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,625
Inside a coin locker.

[BABY MANA crying]

21
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,958
[TAMAKI] Eventually she
was taken to an orphanage.

[CHILDREN yelling, chattering]

23
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:27,375
[TAMAKI] But she didn't fit in
with the other children.

00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:35,916
[locker opens]

25
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,041
[MALE RESIDENT 5A]
Geez.

26
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,916
[TAMAKI] She leaves a
letter inside the locker

27
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,458
for her parents to find.

28
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,791
But every time she checks,
it's still there.

29
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:35,083
[TAMAKI] This continued even
after she joined up with ALCA.

30
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,375
She stays out way past curfew.

31
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:38,583
Artemis tags along,

32
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,875
but it's still hard
not to worry about her.

33
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,791
Does the Chief know about this?

34
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:45,666
She turns a blind eye to it,
just for Mana.

35
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,625
Lovely. Veronica does
have a soft spot.

36
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:52,000
We've been reaching out
to Mana for over a year now,

37
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,791
but nothing seems to work.

38
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,125
I still don't think
I've seen her smile.

39
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:58,625
Not in all this time.

40
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,375
She's still that guarded?

41
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,000
Poor Mana.

42
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,291
[SHIORI]
No fair, Dad!

43
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,000
When do I get to talk to him?

00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:08,750
[RENTARO]
Shh!

45
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,000
[SHIORI groans]

46
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:13,708
Mom would have handed
me the phone ages ago.

47
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:17,666
[RENTARO] So this girl is
all alone in the world, huh?

48
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,708
Hm?

49
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,333
Ah! Your timing
couldn't be better.

50
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,458
I was just reading
about this very thing!

51
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,375
[YOSHICHIKA]
Yeah? Tell me!

52
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:29,416
All you need are some
tasty treats to melt her heart.

53
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,458
[YOSHICHIKA]
Huh...

54
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,458
This should warm you right up.

00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:35,666
It's all yours.

56
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,791
Yoshichika made this
sweet bean pumpkin soup

57

especially for you, Mana.

this crap with her!

You suck!

Try this again and
I'll turn you into soup.

I wonder if big brother
is actually working over there.

70
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,333
I shouldn't have let
Dad talk me into

00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,583
Only option I've got left
is damage control.

[ATHENA]
What do you mean?

I'll just let my
feelings do the talking.

00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,375
Like I should've from the start!

Sorry about this morning.

The only thing I want from
you is friendship, I swear.

I wasn't angry. It's fine.

Just one more thing.

I'm happy I can fight
as a Logicalist

with you and the others.

I never thought I'd get to.

Ever since I Over Tranced
and lost my Logic card

85
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,708
back in Hong Kong, it's felt
like a big part of me

86
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:52,791
was missing!

[MANA]
What was it like?

00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,541
[YOSHICHIKA]
What do you mean?

89
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:05,291
The Over Trance.
How did it feel?

90
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,291
Oh... Well, uh...

91
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:11,250
It wasn't a day at the beach,
if that's what you're asking.

92
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:14,000
I wanted to preserve the
Foreigner's life, but...

93
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:44,041
Yeah, I don't think I should
try pulling that stunt again

94

any time soon.

95
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:48,083
Because it's supposedly
so dangerous, right?

96
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,666
Yeah.

97
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,208
Honestly, I was lucky that all I
ended up losing were my powers.

98

shall I lay myself to rest?

[CHLOE] I'll take point
on this one, Princess.

00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:06,833
[TAMAKI]
All right.

That's strange.

That was way too fast.
What happened?

125
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:50,333
[VALKYRIE] I think it was
cause of the Paradox Zone.

What about Mana-Mana?

Still inside.

00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:55,458
I found it.

129
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,916
Seems The Paradox
Zone was responsible.

130
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,791
It secretes a kind of venom.

131
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,500
That's what caused
their Logic and strength

132
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:02,875
to be so rapidly drained.

133
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:04,500
Are you sure?

134
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:07,416
Looks like you can withstand it
for about five seconds.

135
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,708
[YUKARI] If that's true, there's
no way they'll reach the goal!

136
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:12,666
That rules out close-combat.

137
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,250
We'll have to try
a long range attack.

Into a "time of silence."

Annoying pest.

[QUETZIE]
I see you!

142
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:41,833
[YOSHICHIKA]
Get out of there!

143
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:46,958
[ARTEMIS]
No, don't!

00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:48,958
Follow Yoshichika's
instructions!

Now revert!

You two okay?

00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,000
Not quite.

149
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:26,250
[CHLOE]
What happened to her?

150
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,916
She was bitten a few times.

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,958
[ARTEMIS] We have to
do something, quickly.

Tsurugi, stand down for now.

153
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:52,958
How is she? Better?

154
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:55,500
Think so.
What about the Foreigner?

155
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,875
[TAMAKI]
I think it's napping.

156
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,458
[YOSHICHIKA]
Why would she take such a risk?

157
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:09,708
What happened in there?

[MANA]
Please leave.

Come on.
Let's call it a night.

160
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Sorry, but I need to be
by myself right now.

161
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,375
How spooky.
