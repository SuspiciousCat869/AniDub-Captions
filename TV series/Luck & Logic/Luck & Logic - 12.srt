Tell me, Tsurugi.

17
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:39,208
[OLGA, LUCIFER]
What is paradise?

18
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:41,333
It's when a person
is purged of Logic

19
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:42,916
that doesn't fit their soul.

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,166
And in its place,

21
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,541
they are granted what
is truly ideal for them.

22
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:48,416
[LUCIFER] It is a world
where everyone is given

23
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,708
equal potential,

24
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:53,416
and their reputation
is never undeserved.

25
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,375
Such an existence
would allow everyone

26
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:57,416
to live in perpetual hope.

27
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,208
A false hope.

28
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:01,458
Your paradise is
a hollow illusion.

29
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:05,625
[YOSHICHIKA] We should learn to
accept the Logic we were given.

30
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,250
Forge your own path.

31
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:10,125
Live the way you want
with what you have.

32
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:12,041
Yes, you will suffer sometimes.

33
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:13,583
But that's a part of life.

34
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:17,375
If you really want hope,

35
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:20,708
you've gotta fight for it
with everything you've got.

36
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:23,125
No one can just give it to you.

37
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:26,333
[ATHENA] I felt alone and
lost for a very long time.

38
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:27,708
It was painful.

39
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:30,416
But then I learned it
didn't have to be that way.

40
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,041
The people of Septpia
taught me that.

41
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:34,333
We've walked hand-in-hand

42
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:37,083
and worked to improve
the world around us.

43
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,500
We've laughed
during the good times,

44
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:43,291
and we've shed tears
during the bad ones.

45
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:46,291
When you can do that,
despite your differences,

46
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,208
that's when you find hope.

47
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:50,041
Exactly.

48
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:53,375
Paradise is a place you share
with people you truly cherish.

49
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:56,416
You build it together,
no matter the hardships.

50
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:02,875
And you protect it!

51
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:11,375
[YOSHICHIKA] That's why I can't
let you succeed here today.

You're hoping a cliché

58
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:44,208
I never rely on miracles.

I have my Logic, and it
hasn't let me down before.

[LUCIFER]
What do you think you're doing?

172
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:08,250
This fight is mine
and Tsurugi's. Understand?

173
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,541
[LUCIFER] I was about
to hand you a victory!

174
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,208
Shut up.

175
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:16,208
I'll beat him with my own Logic.
Sit back and watch.

176
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:18,750
Listen.

177
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:20,208
I've always admired you,

178
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:23,125
and thought the way you used
your Logic was incredible.

179
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,458
In fact, I was
hoping that one day,

180
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,583
you and I would fight
alongside each other.

181
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,291
You're too late now!

182
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,708
The whole reason we
got to know each other

183
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,833
was so we could
change the world together!

184
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,250
I wanted the same thing too.

185
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,000
But that's never gonna happen!

[OLGA groans]

189
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:13,166
Look, I remember
something you said to me.

190
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,958
You told me that gods
and humans could coexist.

191
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:18,833
So we should be able
to do the same!

192
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:20,791
I'm willing. Are you?

193
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:23,250
Can you put your vanity aside?

Shut your mouth.

Some clichéd words aren't going
to settle things between us.

198
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:34,291
This fight is the only
thing that matters now.

199
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,250
The outcome will
prove who is right,

200
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,041
whose Logic is strongest.

201

Hey, there.

Hi, sleepy head.

00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,083
You've been out
for an entire week.

236
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:35,791
Feel good?

237
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:37,000
You were so peaceful.

I wish I looked
that lovely when I slept!

So much has happened.

240
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:43,958
Every last Foreigner was put
down by the other branches,

241
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:45,458
and the gate was sealed tight.

242
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,708
And my Logic?

[NEMESIS]
We recovered most of the Cards

244

that got away from you two.

well again in no time.

the hardest out of all of us.

Kidding, of course.

As you can see,
if I get cocky like before,

257
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:33,083
they'll make sure
I'm punished severely.

258
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:36,208
I can't willingly take
the path that Lucifer chose.

259
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:39,500
What are you saying?

00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:49,791

Why are you here?

261
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:54,791
For this.

262
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,500
We found one of
your Logic Cards.

263
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:01,833
Within it is your idea that
men and gods should coexist.

264
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:04,000
I believe it's worth preserving.

265
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,875
ALCA's given me permission
to return it to you.

266
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:08,541
We believe it's the right thing.

267
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:12,458
Are you trying
to be compassionate?

268
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,666
Well, that all depends
on whether or not

269
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,625
you want to reform your ways.

270
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:22,875
I've no intention
of begging for it.

271
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm aware I've been beaten.

272
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:28,541
But if that means I must live in
disgrace and solitude again,

273
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,000
I'd rather die.

274
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,750
Then I won't stop you.

275
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:32,875
[LUCIFER]
I'm grateful.

276
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:35,916
[OLGA]
I'm the one who's grateful.

277
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:39,250
[OLGA]
Thanks to you,

278
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:42,583
I realized just how
arrogant I had been.

279
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:45,958
Now I'm on the path
to true strength.

280
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,375
I'll keep this
as a reminder.

281
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:50,500
[LUCIFER]
What are you going to do?

282
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:54,500
Well, since this was the Card
that wished for coexistence...

283
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:56,833
I'm going to keep
that idea alive.

284
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:09,625
I hate to tell you,

285
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,416
but there's still one Card
missing from each of you.

286
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,541
We haven't been able
to locate them yet.

287
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:16,541
Okay.

288
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:19,875
But Yoshichika's here.
Isn't he?

[TAMAKI groans]
No joke.

292
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:26,458
I'm not sure how to handle it.

293
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:30,208
[ATHENA]
Hey, Yoshichika.

294
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:34,791
That's Athena.
Do you remember her?

295
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:41,541
Sorry. I don't know you.

296
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:44,125
Apparently, the one Logic Card
they're not able to find

297
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:45,708
kept all his memories intact.

298
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:48,125
[SHIORI]
He's so high maintenance.

299
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,250
We've told him
he needs to stay put,

300
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,541
but he still keeps trying
to escape the building.

301
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:53,708
Don't you?

302
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,000
[YOSHICHIKA]
Sorry.

303
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:58,291
[chuckles]

304
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:04,208
Yoshichika is suffering
right before my eyes.

305
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:07,083
But for some reason,
I don't feel sad.

306
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,625
Athena.

307
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:12,375
You think I would at least
feel something, right?

308
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,250
Please don't be
so hard on yourself.

309
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:17,208
The Logic Card you lost is
in charge of your emotions.

310
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:18,375
Don't worry!

311
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:20,291
We're gonna find it soon enough.

312
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:21,541
We promise.

313
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,666
Just try to relax and
leave everything to us.

314
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:27,958
I made my own promise as well.

315
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,708
Just before the fight began.

316
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:32,541
[ATHENA]
Then let's do it.

317
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,458
You'll be at risk as well.

318
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:35,750
You know that.

319
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:39,125
Our Logic Cards will
scatter across the world.

320
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,833
Worst case scenario,

321
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,291
the people we are now
will be lost forever.

322
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,750
But I don't see
any other option.

323
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,000
[ATHENA]
I will take the risk.

324
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:51,291
You sure?

325
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:52,916
Yes, absolutely.

326
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,291
And once the battle is over,

327
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:57,125
I promise I'll find
your Logic Cards again.

328
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:59,000
I won't stop until I do.

329
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:01,291
[YOSHICHIKA]
That isn't fair.

330
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:02,375
You had your turn.

331
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,166
So I'm gonna find
your Cards, okay?

332
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,125
[ATHENA]
Not if I find yours first!

333
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,666
[YOSHICHIKA]
Let's see you try it!

334
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,250
[laughs]

335
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:11,375
Okay, let's do this instead.

336
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:13,416
Whoever has their
Logic Cards found first

337
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,333
has to grant the
other person one wish.

338
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:17,375
Athena.

339
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:21,500
[YOSHICHIKA]
Thanks.

340
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,833
I'm keeping that promise.

341
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:29,833
No matter what it takes,
I will find his Card.

342
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:32,625
So please, try not
to worry about him.

343
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:34,291
Cliché overload.

344
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,791
That girl really is
a match for your brother.

345
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:39,625
I have a feeling your mother
would think the same thing.

346
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:46,500
[ATHENA] And so, the hostilities
between Tetra-Heaven and Septpia

347
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:48,833
finally came to end.

348
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:51,583
But the fighting had
claimed many victims.

349
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,125
For our part in that,

350
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:57,208
we goddesses will never
forget this tragedy.

351
00:17:57,291 --> 00:18:00,083
We also continue
to pray that someday

352
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,500
a true and lasting
peace will come,

353
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,750
and happiness
will reign in Septpia.

354
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,208
Excellent work.

355
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:10,375
I truly can't thank you enough.

356
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:12,333
Without your
countless sacrifices,

357
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:14,875
we wouldn't have
survived these trials.

358
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:15,958
Please.

359
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,625
It was both a
privilege and an honor.

360
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,208
And we'll do
everything in our power

361
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:20,916
to ensure it
doesn't happen again.

362
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,333
I don't want you to go!

363
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:23,916
Hey. Come on, Chloe.

364
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,750
You knew this would happen.

365
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,250
Yeah, but it still sucks.

366
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:28,958
[ATHENA]
I'll miss all of you.

367
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,333
But I'm staying here.

368
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:32,958
Yoshichika's Logic Card
isn't going to find itself.

369
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:36,458
We never said we
were going back, silly.

370
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:37,708
I mean, come on.

371
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:39,875
I've barely had a chance
to see all the fine men

372
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:41,291
this world has to offer.

373
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,416
And it'd be a waste
to go home now!

374
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,333
ALCA can use all
the help they can get

375
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,875
refining Tsurugi's
Logicalist skills.

376
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:48,708
Mana.

377
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:49,833
If it's all right with you,

378
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,958
I'd like to become
your legal guardian.

379
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:53,250
Whoa!

380
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,708
You mean like a parent?

381
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:56,208
Yes.

382
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:57,958
At least till you're old enough
to take care of yourself.

383
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:00,000
So you're gonna be
Mana-Mana's mama?

384
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:00,875
Yes.

385
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:02,166
Well, that's one for the books.

386
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,625
The very first Goddess
to ever raise a human.

387
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,125
[VERONICA]
Nemesis.

388
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:07,500
Are you going home?

389
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:08,875
Duh, of course.

390
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:11,125
I don't have any more
business in this dumb world.

391
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,958
Though, Tetra-Heaven
has a severe lack

392
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:14,916
of zombies and goblins.

393
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,166
You're welcome to stay.

394
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,416
As roomies?

395
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,500
I'd like that.

396
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:20,875
Jeez, you guys
are all so fussy.

397
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:23,666
Welp. Guess I'm
going back by myself.

398
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,833
I'll miss you...

399
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,458
Now that I think about it,

400
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:31,541
this world still has a plethora
of tasty morsels I need to try.

401
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:32,750
I can't leave yet!

402
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:33,791
Really?

403
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:41,208
You have some amazing friends.

404
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:42,916
They're willing to
postpone their journey home

405
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,166
just to help you.

406
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:48,000
Leave the defense
of Naien to me.

407
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:51,041
I'll be sure to keep the leader
spot warm for Yoshichika.

408
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:59,166
[ATHENA] And so,
our next adventure began.

409
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:41,416
My Logic speaks clearly.

410
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,625
The group has recognized me
as their true leader!

411
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:46,625
And yet, the likelihood
that everything

412
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:49,458
is just the same as before is...

413
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:50,750
...a hundred percent.

414
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,291
Does it matter?
We're at peace now.

415
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,833
Still, he makes me nervous.

416
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:56,250
Let's find Tsurugi's Card.

417
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,416
[radar beeping]

418
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,666
Leader Olga,
there's one small problem.

419
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,000
There's no sign
of Tsurugi on base.

420
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:04,041
That jerk.

421
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:05,833
Why can't he just stay put?

422
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:08,708
[phone beeping]

423
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:10,125
He got out again?

424
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:11,375
[OLGA]
Yeah.

425
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:13,250
I sent staff to check
all the usual places,

426
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:14,666
but they haven't found him.

427
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,250
Uh... Hey there.

428
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:37,125
It's you again.

429
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,291
[ATHENA]
Why did you come out here?

430
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:43,041
[YOSHICHIKA]
To be honest, I just did.

431
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,750
I hadn't planned on it.

432
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:47,041
They told me that everyone else

433
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:50,166
is still out looking for
our missing Logic Cards.

434
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:53,250
So I thought I should
be looking, too.

435
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:56,333
Is that the reason you're always
trying to get out the base?

436
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,000
[YOSHICHIKA]
I found this.

437
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:05,125
Here. Please, take it.

438
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:10,333
[CHLOE]
They're over here!

439
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:38,875
[ATHENA crying]

440
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:40,625
Thank you, Yoshichika.

441
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:44,250
I may be crying,
but I feel close to you again.

442
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:46,958
[ATHENA crying]

443
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:52,500
I made a promise to you
before this started.

444
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:54,916
Whoever had all of
their Cards found first

445
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,666
would grant the other person
any wish they wanted.

446
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,291
We actually promised that?

447
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:00,333
Yes.

448
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:03,958
All right.

449
00:23:04,041 --> 00:23:05,291
Since you mention it,

450
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:08,333
there is something I've
kinda been meaning to ask.

451
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:11,291
Could we stop being so formal?

452
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:13,541
I mean, we're
Covenanters, right?

453
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:16,833
It feels weird being so
aloof around each other.

454
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:18,208
The hell?

455
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:20,708
That's really all you wanted?

456
00:23:25,291 --> 00:23:26,875
Sounds good to me.

457
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:29,208
I'll fulfill my
other promise, too.

458
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:31,125
I'll make you whole again.

459
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:32,458
For both of us.

460
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:38,791
[YOSHICHIKA]
Okay.
