00:00:17.184 --> 00:00:18.418 position:44% line:89% align:start
Um...

00:00:18.553 --> 00:00:20.420 position:19% line:83% align:start
Excuse me, could I ask
what your name is?

00:00:20.555 --> 00:00:22.724 position:13% line:89% align:start
Uh, it's Hiroto Shinohara.

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:24.726 position:27% line:89% align:start
Master Shinohara?

00:00:27.562 --> 00:00:29.429 position:27% line:83% align:start
I beg your pardon
for my lapse in decorum,

00:00:29.564 --> 00:00:32.032 position:21% line:83% align:start
I imagine I appeared
quite foolish hiding as I did.

00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:33.233 position:24% line:89% align:start
Please, forgive me.

00:00:33.367 --> 00:00:34.936 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Silky white hair!

00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:38.405 position:7% line:83% align:start
Small face! Big eyes! Oh, man!
Even her voice is adorable!

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.208 position:10% line:83% align:start
Um, why exactly did you hide,
Miss?

00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:43.243 position:16% line:89% align:start
No need to be so formal.

00:00:43.377 --> 00:00:44.746 position:35% line:83% align:start
It's simply
that I wasn't informed

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.915 position:24% line:83% align:start
you would be male,
Master Shinohara.

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:49.784 position:35% line:83% align:start
But still,
the fact is immaterial

00:00:49.918 --> 00:00:51.151 position:19% line:89% align:start
to my responsibilities.

00:00:51.285 --> 00:00:52.754 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm Shirayuki Himeji,

00:00:52.887 --> 00:00:55.523 position:21% line:83% align:start
a student enrolled in
District Three's Ouka Academy

00:00:55.657 --> 00:00:58.492 position:10% line:83% align:start
on request of District Four's
Headmistress Ichinose.

00:00:58.626 --> 00:01:00.193 position:27% line:83% align:start
I will be serving
in the capacity

00:01:00.327 --> 00:01:02.730 position:13% line:83% align:start
of your live-in assistant,
starting from today.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.732 position:35% line:89% align:start
Come again?

00:01:05.667 --> 00:01:08.836 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:02:35.556 --> 00:02:36.758 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
Some tea.

00:02:36.891 --> 00:02:38.559 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
What did you mean by "live-in"?

00:02:38.693 --> 00:02:40.028 position:10% line:89% align:start
I don't believe it to be far

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.562 position:44% line:83% align:start
from
the conventional definition.

00:02:41.696 --> 00:02:43.230 position:13% line:89% align:start
I will live and sleep here,

00:02:43.363 --> 00:02:46.000 position:10% line:83% align:start
aiding you in whatever manner
I'm able, sir.

00:02:46.134 --> 00:02:47.502 position:35% line:89% align:start
Sleep here?

00:02:47.635 --> 00:02:49.504 position:19% line:83% align:start
I apologize in advance
for any disappointment,

00:02:49.637 --> 00:02:51.639 position:27% line:83% align:start
but we will have
separate bedrooms.

00:02:51.773 --> 00:02:54.742 position:13% line:83% align:start
Disappointment? That's not
really the issue here.

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:57.779 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Never mind, forget about it.

00:02:57.912 --> 00:02:59.647 position:24% line:83% align:start
I just didn't think
that you'd like.

00:02:59.781 --> 00:03:03.084 position:13% line:83% align:start
-I don't, not in the least.
-You're giving me mixed signals!

00:03:03.216 --> 00:03:04.686 position:5% line:89% align:start
My reservations aren't personal,

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:06.954 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm merely unaccustomed
to the male presence.

00:03:07.088 --> 00:03:10.223 position:24% line:83% align:start
My ire is entirely
for Headmistress Ichinose.

00:03:11.125 --> 00:03:13.360 position:13% line:83% align:start
Huh, I don't know what beef
you have with her,

00:03:13.493 --> 00:03:15.563 position:13% line:89% align:start
but trust me, I can relate.

00:03:15.697 --> 00:03:17.364 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
Then we have common ground,

00:03:17.497 --> 00:03:19.266 position:21% line:83% align:start
as good a sign as any
for the prospect

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:20.902 position:16% line:83% align:start
of peaceful coexistence,
say Master?

00:03:21.035 --> 00:03:22.670 position:24% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] You know,
you can sit down if you want.

00:03:22.804 --> 00:03:25.039 position:21% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI] I'm fine.
Please don't worry about me.

00:03:25.173 --> 00:03:27.642 position:24% line:83% align:start
A maid does not sit
in the presence of her betters.

00:03:27.775 --> 00:03:29.409 position:7% line:83% align:start
Look, you're making me nervous,
you know?

00:03:29.544 --> 00:03:31.546 position:10% line:83% align:start
We're both here at the whims
of the Headmistress.

00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:33.748 position:5% line:89% align:start
No need to put me on a pedestal.

00:03:34.281 --> 00:03:36.684 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh, well. If you insist.

00:03:36.818 --> 00:03:39.252 position:10% line:83% align:start
I would hate for you to feel
uncomfortable, Master.

00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:41.155 position:24% line:83% align:start
You called yourself
an "assistant",

00:03:41.288 --> 00:03:43.658 position:7% line:83% align:start
so I'm guessing you're not just
a regular housemaid.

00:03:43.791 --> 00:03:48.395 position:13% line:83% align:start
Observant. Tell me, Master,
when was it you last ate?

00:03:49.362 --> 00:03:50.497 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Huh?

00:03:51.933 --> 00:03:52.900 position:41% line:89% align:start
Dig in.

00:03:53.034 --> 00:03:55.402 position:13% line:89% align:start
No way! Is this all for me?

00:03:55.536 --> 00:03:58.072 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yes, perhaps I made
a little more than necessary.

00:03:58.206 --> 00:04:00.675 position:30% line:83% align:start
"A little more"
is kind of underselling it.

00:04:00.808 --> 00:04:02.677 position:13% line:83% align:start
You're gonna have some too,
right?

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.078 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
I'll wait until after

00:04:04.212 --> 00:04:05.445 position:16% line:89% align:start
you're finished, Master.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.014 position:41% line:83% align:start
No, no!
It'll have gone cold by then,

00:04:07.148 --> 00:04:08.516 position:13% line:89% align:start
you can help me eat it now.

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:11.318 position:35% line:83% align:start
Very well,
if you wish for me to do so.

00:04:11.451 --> 00:04:13.121 position:13% line:89% align:start
Right, I guess I'll dig in.

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:14.689 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chomping]

00:04:14.822 --> 00:04:17.925 position:24% line:83% align:start
This is delicious!
Such succulent, divine flavors.

00:04:18.059 --> 00:04:19.259 position:19% line:89% align:start
Could this perfect meal

00:04:19.392 --> 00:04:20.928 position:21% line:83% align:start
truly have been made
by human hands?

00:04:21.062 --> 00:04:22.262 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm not entirely sure

00:04:22.395 --> 00:04:23.731 position:16% line:83% align:start
whether that's flattering
or belittling.

00:04:23.865 --> 00:04:25.465 position:35% line:83% align:start
Words fail,
and praise is not enough,

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.968 position:24% line:89% align:start
this is everything!

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:28.636 position:24% line:89% align:start
My, how unexpected.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.370 position:13% line:83% align:start
You certainly are effusive
with your feelings,

00:04:30.505 --> 00:04:31.572 position:27% line:89% align:start
Master Shinohara.

00:04:31.706 --> 00:04:33.975 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Huh? Yeah, I guess I am.

00:04:34.108 --> 00:04:36.110 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'd actually heard
that you were exceedingly adept

00:04:36.244 --> 00:04:37.612 position:16% line:89% align:start
at hiding what you felt.

00:04:37.745 --> 00:04:40.581 position:16% line:83% align:start
Hm, yeah, but I can swing
to the other extreme

00:04:40.715 --> 00:04:41.916 position:16% line:89% align:start
when I let my guard down.

00:04:42.049 --> 00:04:43.316 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chomping]

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:44.952 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
And your guard is down now?

00:04:45.086 --> 00:04:46.587 position:19% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Yeah. I mean,
it's not like you've given me

00:04:46.721 --> 00:04:48.556 position:16% line:83% align:start
any reason to be on edge
or anything.

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:53.594 position:10% line:83% align:start
Oh. I see. Any food aversions
I should know about?

00:04:53.728 --> 00:04:55.395 position:33% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Nah,
I'll eat just about anything!

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.297 position:10% line:89% align:start
Especially if it's this good.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.600 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.107 position:21% line:83% align:start
Alright, we'll start
with a detailed overview.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.909 position:5% line:89% align:start
To prevent unauthorized access,

00:05:08.042 --> 00:05:10.410 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll be displaying
this content offline.

00:05:10.545 --> 00:05:12.213 position:10% line:89% align:start
If anyone were to spy on us,

00:05:12.345 --> 00:05:14.215 position:21% line:83% align:start
it would spell an end
to all this.

00:05:14.347 --> 00:05:15.783 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
She's not wrong.

00:05:15.917 --> 00:05:17.919 position:21% line:83% align:start
By using the Red Star
to become a fake Seven Star,

00:05:18.052 --> 00:05:20.453 position:13% line:83% align:start
we're basically pulling off
one huge scam.

00:05:20.588 --> 00:05:23.291 position:16% line:83% align:start
This isn't morally gray,
it's black as sin

00:05:23.423 --> 00:05:24.992 position:24% line:83% align:start
and if it gets out,
I'm done for.

00:05:25.126 --> 00:05:29.297 position:7% line:83% align:start
Academy Island. Save for Zero,
each district has one.

00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:31.732 position:38% line:83% align:start
Resulting
in a grand total of twenty.

00:05:31.866 --> 00:05:35.303 position:13% line:83% align:start
These academies are ranked
and scored on a yearly basis.

00:05:35.703 --> 00:05:37.437 position:33% line:83% align:start
In accordance
with their rank placement

00:05:37.572 --> 00:05:40.208 position:19% line:83% align:start
each academy is granted
certain privileges.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.543 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Uh, do the students' Stars

00:05:42.677 --> 00:05:43.878 position:10% line:89% align:start
have anything to do with it?

00:05:44.011 --> 00:05:45.445 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
Indeed they do.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.380 position:24% line:83% align:start
Students possessing
five or more Stars

00:05:47.515 --> 00:05:48.783 position:7% line:89% align:start
are considered to be advanced.

00:05:48.916 --> 00:05:50.585 position:27% line:83% align:start
The more of those
an academy has,

00:05:50.718 --> 00:05:52.153 position:5% line:89% align:start
the higher its ranking will be,

00:05:52.286 --> 00:05:54.222 position:10% line:83% align:start
and should one have a student
with Seven Stars?

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:55.422 position:19% line:89% align:start
It'll usually rank top.

00:05:55.556 --> 00:05:56.791 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Well, that explains

00:05:56.924 --> 00:05:59.126 position:21% line:83% align:start
why the headmistress
was so on-to-con.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:00.995 position:7% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI] And this tremendous
systemic value

00:06:01.128 --> 00:06:04.165 position:13% line:83% align:start
is also why the Seven Stars
are so thoroughly targeted.

00:06:04.298 --> 00:06:05.833 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
That makes sense.

00:06:05.967 --> 00:06:09.103 position:5% line:83% align:start
If a Six Star beats me, they can
take my position at the top.

00:06:09.237 --> 00:06:10.771 position:35% line:89% align:start
But still,

00:06:10.905 --> 00:06:12.372 position:7% line:83% align:start
they're putting their own Stars
on-the-line too, right?

00:06:12.506 --> 00:06:13.875 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
Yes. However,

00:06:14.008 --> 00:06:15.943 position:10% line:83% align:start
the reward outweighs the risk
for lower ranks.

00:06:16.077 --> 00:06:17.712 position:19% line:83% align:start
So, even a small chance
of winning

00:06:17.845 --> 00:06:19.580 position:19% line:83% align:start
is statistically worth
the gamble.

00:06:19.714 --> 00:06:21.849 position:24% line:83% align:start
Also, the abilities
of a Seven Star typically help

00:06:21.983 --> 00:06:24.619 position:13% line:83% align:start
mitigate the threats posed
to them. Case in point.

00:06:24.752 --> 00:06:27.054 position:13% line:83% align:start
These are the game results
over the past year

00:06:27.188 --> 00:06:28.789 position:16% line:89% align:start
for The Empress, Saionji.

00:06:28.923 --> 00:06:32.226 position:10% line:83% align:start
Sadly, her defensive arsenal
isn't available to you, Master.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.594 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Huh? Why not?

00:06:33.728 --> 00:06:35.029 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
Because of your score

00:06:35.162 --> 00:06:36.197 position:21% line:89% align:start
on the transfer exam.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:37.698 position:38% line:89% align:start
[groans]

00:06:37.832 --> 00:06:39.000 position:24% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI] A score
so outstandingly pathetic,

00:06:39.133 --> 00:06:40.935 position:19% line:83% align:start
it's almost unbearable
to look at.

00:06:41.068 --> 00:06:42.937 position:24% line:83% align:start
I fear most schools
would have laughed you out.

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:44.171 position:38% line:89% align:start
[groans]

00:06:44.305 --> 00:06:45.806 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
Pardon my candor.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.576 position:13% line:83% align:start
At any rate, your true rank
is still One Star, Master.

00:06:48.709 --> 00:06:50.278 position:5% line:89% align:start
Meaning that, in upcoming games,

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.648 position:10% line:83% align:start
you will only be able to use
abilities at a One Star level.

00:06:53.781 --> 00:06:55.549 position:24% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Those are
the weakest ones, aren't they?

00:06:55.683 --> 00:06:56.984 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
Yes.

00:06:57.118 --> 00:06:58.219 position:7% line:83% align:start
You'll essentially be fighting
boss battles

00:06:58.352 --> 00:06:59.887 position:19% line:89% align:start
as a level one player.

00:07:00.021 --> 00:07:01.956 position:16% line:83% align:start
That doesn't sound good,
but I'm guessing

00:07:02.089 --> 00:07:04.325 position:16% line:83% align:start
that's kind of the reason
you were sent here, wasn't it?

00:07:04.457 --> 00:07:07.094 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI] That is correct.
Now listen carefully.

00:07:07.228 --> 00:07:09.330 position:19% line:83% align:start
For the next two years,
we in the Company will do

00:07:09.462 --> 00:07:12.199 position:13% line:83% align:start
everything we possibly can
to assist you, Master.

00:07:12.333 --> 00:07:15.569 position:19% line:83% align:start
Not only in your games,
but also in your daily life.

00:07:15.703 --> 00:07:17.470 position:5% line:83% align:start
As long as you're able to uphold
the act,

00:07:17.605 --> 00:07:19.340 position:19% line:83% align:start
and maintain your rank
as Seven Star.

00:07:19.472 --> 00:07:23.144 position:16% line:83% align:start
Then we will be complicit
in your lie, Master Shinohara.

00:07:23.277 --> 00:07:24.879 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Sweet salvation!

00:07:25.012 --> 00:07:27.848 position:7% line:83% align:start
Oh! Games are all one-one-ones,
though, aren't they?

00:07:27.982 --> 00:07:30.483 position:21% line:83% align:start
If someone helps me,
it'll be obvious.

00:07:33.154 --> 00:07:35.323 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI] Do you see
the game icon in the center?

00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:36.724 position:19% line:89% align:start
You've likely received

00:07:36.857 --> 00:07:38.426 position:21% line:83% align:start
a substantial number
of game requests by now.

00:07:38.559 --> 00:07:40.828 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
What? Forty-two already?

00:07:40.962 --> 00:07:43.496 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Scroll down a bit, please.
-Huh?

00:07:43.631 --> 00:07:45.132 position:13% line:89% align:start
Right, you can stop there.

00:07:45.266 --> 00:07:47.401 position:21% line:83% align:start
We'll choose that one
for your first match,

00:07:47.535 --> 00:07:49.236 position:13% line:89% align:start
scheduled tomorrow morning.

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:51.639 position:19% line:89% align:start
Uh, that's really soon.

00:07:51.772 --> 00:07:53.307 position:13% line:89% align:start
Which will make an impact.

00:07:53.441 --> 00:07:55.743 position:7% line:83% align:start
You received a lot of attention
for beating the Empress

00:07:55.876 --> 00:07:57.945 position:10% line:83% align:start
on your first day of school,
Master.

00:07:58.713 --> 00:08:00.247 position:33% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAKYUKI]
But at this stage,

00:08:00.381 --> 00:08:02.083 position:16% line:83% align:start
there will still be those
second-guessing your strength.

00:08:02.216 --> 00:08:05.853 position:41% line:83% align:start
And so,
a further example must be made.

00:08:05.987 --> 00:08:08.589 position:7% line:83% align:start
In addition to that, we can use
this game to demonstrate

00:08:08.723 --> 00:08:10.324 position:10% line:89% align:start
how our assistance will work.

00:08:10.458 --> 00:08:13.995 position:7% line:83% align:start
And you're sure I'm gonna win?
I'm just a One Star, remember?

00:08:14.128 --> 00:08:14.929 position:41% line:89% align:start
So how?

00:08:15.396 --> 00:08:17.598 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
That should be obvious by now.

00:08:17.732 --> 00:08:20.101 position:10% line:89% align:start
If you wanna win, you cheat.

00:08:20.935 --> 00:08:23.104 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
What do you mean by "cheat?"

00:08:23.771 --> 00:08:24.872 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hacking, of course.

00:08:25.406 --> 00:08:27.041 position:33% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] And
how're we supposed to do that?

00:08:27.508 --> 00:08:29.810 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI] Could you put
this earbud in, please?

00:08:29.944 --> 00:08:31.445 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Uh, right now?

00:08:31.579 --> 00:08:34.615 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI] The Company's
Head of Electronics, Kagaya.

00:08:34.749 --> 00:08:36.951 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KAGAYA]
Hey, bro! How's it going?

00:08:37.084 --> 00:08:39.453 position:35% line:83% align:start
I'm Kagaya,
the 'big sis' around here.

00:08:39.587 --> 00:08:40.755 position:27% line:89% align:start
Nice to meet you.

00:08:40.888 --> 00:08:42.523 position:19% line:89% align:start
Uh, sure, good evening.

00:08:42.656 --> 00:08:43.958 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KAGAYA]
Nah, that's way too stiff!

00:08:44.091 --> 00:08:46.861 position:5% line:83% align:start
Let's try something more snappy,
like, Hiro?

00:08:46.994 --> 00:08:48.696 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[sighs]
-[KAGAYA] Alright!

00:08:48.829 --> 00:08:50.131 position:24% line:89% align:start
He's cool with it!

00:08:50.264 --> 00:08:51.966 position:21% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] This girl's
in a world of her own.

00:08:52.099 --> 00:08:53.267 position:27% line:89% align:start
As you can tell,

00:08:53.401 --> 00:08:54.869 position:16% line:83% align:start
Kagaya's social etiquette
is somewhat lacking,

00:08:55.002 --> 00:08:56.871 position:30% line:83% align:start
but her skills
more than make up for it.

00:08:57.438 --> 00:08:59.540 position:24% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI] Kagaya
will be able to hack her way

00:08:59.673 --> 00:09:01.008 position:10% line:89% align:start
into your opponent's Device.

00:09:01.142 --> 00:09:03.377 position:30% line:83% align:start
Manipulating it
to our advantage.

00:09:03.844 --> 00:09:05.179 position:19% line:89% align:start
So, it's quite simple.

00:09:05.312 --> 00:09:06.914 position:13% line:83% align:start
If you don't draw attention
to the hacking,

00:09:07.048 --> 00:09:09.984 position:16% line:83% align:start
victory is just a matter
of keeping up appearances.

00:09:10.519 --> 00:09:12.119 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Just like that?

00:09:12.253 --> 00:09:13.821 position:30% line:83% align:start
I mean, I know
I'm not directly involved

00:09:13.954 --> 00:09:15.423 position:10% line:89% align:start
but isn't this sort of wrong?

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:17.224 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
Well, of course it's wrong.

00:09:17.358 --> 00:09:19.126 position:33% line:83% align:start
Third parties
interfering with a game

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:20.294 position:21% line:89% align:start
is against the rules.

00:09:20.428 --> 00:09:22.596 position:30% line:83% align:start
So is accessing
someone else's Device.

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:24.065 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's an instant-ban offense,

00:09:24.198 --> 00:09:26.434 position:38% line:83% align:start
in fact,
but that works to our favor.

00:09:26.901 --> 00:09:29.336 position:19% line:83% align:start
The Company would never
botch a task this delicate.

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:31.639 position:13% line:89% align:start
Amazing, if not terrifying.

00:09:32.473 --> 00:09:34.909 position:10% line:83% align:start
[ICHINOSE] But do you really
want it to end like that?

00:09:35.042 --> 00:09:38.579 position:16% line:83% align:start
Didn't you have a reason
for coming here? A goal?

00:09:39.447 --> 00:09:41.315 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
That's right. I do.

00:09:42.249 --> 00:09:43.150 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:09:43.717 --> 00:09:45.554 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'll do whatever
it takes to win!

00:09:45.686 --> 00:09:47.788 position:16% line:89% align:start
I will be the strongest.

00:09:48.589 --> 00:09:50.091 position:41% line:89% align:start
[ding]

00:09:51.392 --> 00:09:52.726 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KAGAYA]
Way to go, Hiro!

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.361 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[giggles]
-[chuckles]

00:09:54.495 --> 00:09:56.330 position:19% line:83% align:start
[KAGAYA] When I hack in
and seize control of the game

00:09:56.464 --> 00:09:58.999 position:33% line:83% align:start
your victory
is pretty much inevitable.

00:10:00.101 --> 00:10:01.268 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:10:01.402 --> 00:10:05.072 position:30% line:89% align:start
I-I won. I won!

00:10:05.206 --> 00:10:06.607 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
Was that alright, Mast--

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:08.476 position:38% line:83% align:start
Alright?
That was unbelievable!

00:10:08.609 --> 00:10:12.346 position:19% line:83% align:start
You said it'd be easy,
but, man, that was effortless.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.281 position:13% line:89% align:start
Seriously, you're the best!

00:10:14.415 --> 00:10:16.050 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
Then you acknowledge our skills?

00:10:16.183 --> 00:10:18.052 position:5% line:89% align:start
I sure do! I've got total faith!

00:10:18.185 --> 00:10:19.887 position:33% line:83% align:start
From here on,
I'm counting on you!

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:21.556 position:13% line:89% align:start
Let's make this thing work!

00:10:21.689 --> 00:10:23.224 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
Understood.

00:10:23.357 --> 00:10:25.759 position:5% line:83% align:start
And if you don't mind me saying,
your performance was exquisite.

00:10:25.893 --> 00:10:27.194 position:24% line:89% align:start
Well done, Master.

00:10:27.328 --> 00:10:29.564 position:21% line:83% align:start
Now, it's about time
you headed to campus.

00:10:29.697 --> 00:10:30.931 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right.

00:10:32.266 --> 00:10:34.268 position:27% line:83% align:start
[TATARA] You mind
if I call you Shinohara?

00:10:34.401 --> 00:10:35.604 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm Fuuka Tatara.

00:10:35.736 --> 00:10:37.037 position:19% line:89% align:start
2-A's class president.

00:10:37.506 --> 00:10:39.807 position:13% line:83% align:start
I can answer any questions
you have, Shinohara.

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:41.976 position:19% line:83% align:start
Like what's best to eat
in the cafeteria.

00:10:42.109 --> 00:10:44.979 position:10% line:83% align:start
I don't think that'll be high
on the priority list, Tatara.

00:10:45.112 --> 00:10:46.747 position:16% line:89% align:start
What? Why wouldn't it be?

00:10:46.881 --> 00:10:49.083 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm Yuuki Tsuji. Pleasure.

00:10:49.216 --> 00:10:50.151 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:10:50.784 --> 00:10:52.086 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
I was a little surprised

00:10:52.219 --> 00:10:53.687 position:30% line:83% align:start
when I learned
the class had a tournament

00:10:53.821 --> 00:10:55.422 position:30% line:83% align:start
just to decide
who'd get to show me around.

00:10:56.457 --> 00:10:58.425 position:33% line:83% align:start
So, are games
actually pushed here

00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.994 position:5% line:89% align:start
as much as I've heard they are?

00:11:00.127 --> 00:11:02.663 position:13% line:83% align:start
[TSUJI] Yeah, it's a thing.
Headmistress' policy.

00:11:02.796 --> 00:11:04.533 position:27% line:83% align:start
Eimei has ranked
in the top five academies

00:11:04.665 --> 00:11:08.002 position:7% line:83% align:start
for the last few years running,
it's really competitive.

00:11:08.135 --> 00:11:10.070 position:27% line:83% align:start
But the students
like the games too.

00:11:10.204 --> 00:11:13.307 position:5% line:83% align:start
More importantly, snack shopping
at lunch gets crazy!

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.909 position:30% line:89% align:start
So, if you want

00:11:15.042 --> 00:11:16.076 position:19% line:83% align:start
any chance of snagging
the popular chocolate cornet.

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:17.579 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
Please forgive

00:11:17.711 --> 00:11:19.113 position:13% line:83% align:start
the untimely interruption,
Master.

00:11:19.648 --> 00:11:22.082 position:7% line:83% align:start
We've received a very favorable
game request.

00:11:22.216 --> 00:11:24.885 position:21% line:83% align:start
The challenger's name
is Haru Urasaka.

00:11:25.019 --> 00:11:27.721 position:13% line:83% align:start
She's a third-year student
from District Eleven.

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:32.426 position:30% line:83% align:start
Man. Looks like
life's about to get real busy

00:11:32.561 --> 00:11:33.894 position:27% line:89% align:start
from here on out.

00:11:35.963 --> 00:11:38.832 position:30% line:83% align:start
Alright, folks!
The wait is meow over!

00:11:38.966 --> 00:11:42.036 position:5% line:83% align:start
Today's highly anticipated event
is about to begin!

00:11:42.169 --> 00:11:45.640 position:35% line:83% align:start
But first,
meow about I introduce myself?

00:11:46.173 --> 00:11:48.242 position:30% line:83% align:start
Coming straight
meowta Ouka Academy,

00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:51.845 position:10% line:83% align:start
repping Libra, I'm your host,
second-year Suzuran Kazami!

00:11:51.979 --> 00:11:53.447 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
Libra's the Island media group

00:11:53.582 --> 00:11:54.949 position:16% line:89% align:start
behind the news app LNN.

00:11:55.082 --> 00:11:57.451 position:27% line:83% align:start
They also manage
the streaming platform ITube.

00:11:57.586 --> 00:11:58.886 position:24% line:89% align:start
And are responsible

00:11:59.019 --> 00:12:00.421 position:33% line:83% align:start
for arranging
high-profile game events.

00:12:00.555 --> 00:12:03.924 position:24% line:83% align:start
[SUZURAN] First up,
our challenger, Haru Urasaka!

00:12:04.058 --> 00:12:05.426 position:24% line:89% align:start
Ranked Three Stars,

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.596 position:7% line:83% align:start
her hobbies include road trips
and Visual Kei!

00:12:07.728 --> 00:12:08.563 position:44% line:89% align:start
'Sup?

00:12:08.697 --> 00:12:09.964 position:35% line:89% align:start
[cheering]

00:12:10.097 --> 00:12:11.465 position:24% line:83% align:start
And the one meeting
her challenge

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.000 position:10% line:89% align:start
is the blood-soaked overlord

00:12:13.133 --> 00:12:15.369 position:13% line:83% align:start
who's rocked Academy Island
like an earthquake.

00:12:15.503 --> 00:12:17.071 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Who's she even talking about?

00:12:17.204 --> 00:12:18.939 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SUZURAN] You all know him
as the fastest ever

00:12:19.073 --> 00:12:20.441 position:21% line:89% align:start
to reach Seven Stars.

00:12:20.575 --> 00:12:22.711 position:19% line:83% align:start
The ruthlessly cunning,
fearlessly outrageous,

00:12:22.843 --> 00:12:26.046 position:27% line:83% align:start
proudly arrogant,
Hiroto Shinohara!

00:12:26.814 --> 00:12:29.350 position:10% line:83% align:start
So how you feline, Shinohara?
Pumped up and ready?

00:12:29.483 --> 00:12:32.186 position:35% line:83% align:start
Pumped up?
I don't see why I should be.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.589 position:27% line:83% align:start
My victory is all
but inevitable.

00:12:34.723 --> 00:12:35.856 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:37.592 position:27% line:83% align:start
He's cool, calm,
and confident, isn't he?

00:12:37.726 --> 00:12:39.126 position:38% line:89% align:start
[screams]

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:40.662 position:24% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] That line
is so coming back to haunt me!

00:12:40.794 --> 00:12:43.598 position:16% line:83% align:start
Why do I keep coming off
like an egotistical monster?

00:12:43.732 --> 00:12:44.865 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SUZURAN]
And meow,

00:12:44.999 --> 00:12:46.668 position:30% line:83% align:start
please welcome
our special guest!

00:12:47.535 --> 00:12:49.436 position:24% line:83% align:start
[SARASA] Thank you!
It's a pleasure to be here!

00:12:49.571 --> 00:12:51.071 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm Sarasa Saionji.

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:53.274 position:38% line:89% align:start
[giggles]

00:12:53.407 --> 00:12:55.909 position:5% line:83% align:start
That certainly was some amusing,
if not indulgent preamble, huh?

00:12:56.043 --> 00:12:57.211 position:10% line:89% align:start
Now who else is ready to see

00:12:57.344 --> 00:12:59.280 position:30% line:83% align:start
what these two
are actually capable of?

00:12:59.413 --> 00:13:00.881 position:35% line:89% align:start
[cheering]

00:13:01.282 --> 00:13:02.483 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SUZURAN]
There you have it!

00:13:02.617 --> 00:13:05.019 position:24% line:83% align:start
I, Suzuran Kazami,
and my classmate,

00:13:05.152 --> 00:13:06.721 position:13% line:89% align:start
Ouka's ace, Sarasa Saionji,

00:13:06.854 --> 00:13:10.190 position:5% line:83% align:start
will be providin' live breakdown
and analysis fur ya!

00:13:10.324 --> 00:13:14.495 position:13% line:83% align:start
Okay, Urasaka, go on ahead
and name your game, right meow!

00:13:14.895 --> 00:13:17.498 position:38% line:83% align:start
[URASAKA]
Right. The game I choose is.

00:13:18.032 --> 00:13:20.502 position:24% line:83% align:start
The "anything goes"
one-hundred-meter race.

00:13:22.403 --> 00:13:23.705 position:27% line:89% align:start
Sturm und Drang!

00:13:23.837 --> 00:13:25.272 position:16% line:89% align:start
So, from start to finish,

00:13:25.406 --> 00:13:28.108 position:16% line:83% align:start
no mode of transportation
is off-limits, huh? Fun.

00:13:28.242 --> 00:13:29.977 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm pretty confident
that you'll never beat me

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:32.112 position:10% line:89% align:start
in a game of pure, raw speed.

00:13:32.246 --> 00:13:34.516 position:13% line:83% align:start
Well, that's a coincidence,
'cause I'm pretty confident

00:13:34.649 --> 00:13:36.518 position:21% line:83% align:start
you'll never beat me
in a game of anything.

00:13:36.651 --> 00:13:39.153 position:13% line:83% align:start
And it looks like the claws
are coming meowt!

00:13:39.286 --> 00:13:41.021 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Man, what am I even saying

00:13:41.155 --> 00:13:42.289 position:30% line:89% align:start
at this point?

00:13:42.423 --> 00:13:44.124 position:38% line:83% align:start
[URASAKA]
Uh, hey, fair warning.

00:13:44.258 --> 00:13:47.294 position:13% line:83% align:start
I don't just ride my bikes,
I like to work on 'em too.

00:13:47.428 --> 00:13:50.699 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:13:50.831 --> 00:13:52.132 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SUZURAN]
Woah!

00:13:52.266 --> 00:13:54.034 position:24% line:83% align:start
She's bringing out
the big guns this time!

00:13:54.168 --> 00:13:56.136 position:27% line:83% align:start
No bike like this
has ever been recorded

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:57.838 position:10% line:89% align:start
in Urasaka's battle history!

00:13:57.971 --> 00:13:59.507 position:24% line:83% align:start
[SARASA] Definitely
Urasaka's secret weapon.

00:13:59.641 --> 00:14:02.510 position:7% line:83% align:start
After all, vehicle performance
is the key to this game.

00:14:02.644 --> 00:14:05.145 position:7% line:83% align:start
A performance-boosting ability
alone won't be enough

00:14:05.279 --> 00:14:06.581 position:21% line:89% align:start
to take that bike on.

00:14:06.715 --> 00:14:08.817 position:7% line:83% align:start
Any sensible player would look
to abilities

00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:10.819 position:13% line:89% align:start
that focus on obstruction.

00:14:10.951 --> 00:14:13.320 position:5% line:89% align:start
Whatever vehicle Shinohara uses.

00:14:13.954 --> 00:14:15.022 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:14:15.155 --> 00:14:16.591 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SUZURAN]
Shinohara!

00:14:16.725 --> 00:14:19.093 position:10% line:83% align:start
Are you seriously gonna race
a motorcycle on foot?

00:14:19.226 --> 00:14:20.961 position:30% line:83% align:start
I know this is
an "anything goes" speed race,

00:14:21.095 --> 00:14:22.863 position:13% line:89% align:start
but what are you thinking?

00:14:22.996 --> 00:14:24.766 position:16% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] My heart's gonna
explode for sure!

00:14:24.898 --> 00:14:27.502 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI] Our data shows
Urasaka's main ability

00:14:27.635 --> 00:14:28.936 position:16% line:89% align:start
is "remove speed limit."

00:14:29.069 --> 00:14:30.170 position:7% line:89% align:start
The effect of which allows her

00:14:30.304 --> 00:14:31.972 position:38% line:83% align:start
to exceed
her vehicle's top speed.

00:14:32.106 --> 00:14:34.576 position:27% line:83% align:start
Augmenting this,
is her second ability,

00:14:34.709 --> 00:14:35.943 position:30% line:89% align:start
"Acceleration".

00:14:36.076 --> 00:14:37.444 position:27% line:83% align:start
Third in sequence
is "Safety Device",

00:14:37.579 --> 00:14:40.481 position:16% line:83% align:start
an ability that protects
both user and systems.

00:14:40.948 --> 00:14:42.149 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
If this goes as expected,

00:14:42.282 --> 00:14:43.984 position:33% line:83% align:start
she won't use
her defensive ability,

00:14:44.118 --> 00:14:45.820 position:24% line:83% align:start
so my interference
shouldn't be blocked.

00:14:45.986 --> 00:14:47.388 position:38% line:83% align:start
[URASAKA]
It's too late to change 'em now,

00:14:47.522 --> 00:14:49.323 position:19% line:83% align:start
so there's no real harm
in telling you.

00:14:49.758 --> 00:14:52.192 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm using the Nullify
Interference ability.

00:14:52.326 --> 00:14:54.094 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's a defensive utility
that cancels out

00:14:54.228 --> 00:14:56.330 position:16% line:83% align:start
your opponent's attempts
to impede you.

00:14:56.463 --> 00:14:58.065 position:21% line:83% align:start
I bet that you picked
obstructive abilities

00:14:58.198 --> 00:14:59.734 position:33% line:83% align:start
in all three
of your active slots,

00:14:59.868 --> 00:15:01.201 position:35% line:89% align:start
didn't you?

00:15:01.335 --> 00:15:03.337 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's really too bad.
They're worthless now.

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:04.438 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:15:04.572 --> 00:15:07.241 position:19% line:83% align:start
Let's get this moving,
Speed Girl.

00:15:07.374 --> 00:15:08.442 position:41% line:89% align:start
[humph]

00:15:08.877 --> 00:15:11.945 position:13% line:83% align:start
Here we go! We've kept you
in suspense long enough!

00:15:12.079 --> 00:15:13.280 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SUZURAN]
Meow'all ready for this?

00:15:13.414 --> 00:15:15.349 position:30% line:83% align:start
Who will reach
the finish line first?

00:15:15.482 --> 00:15:18.318 position:33% line:83% align:start
Don't blink!
It'll be over in an instant!

00:15:18.952 --> 00:15:21.790 position:27% line:89% align:start
Three. Two. One.

00:15:21.922 --> 00:15:22.891 position:44% line:89% align:start
Boom!

00:15:23.023 --> 00:15:24.992 position:38% line:89% align:start
[whoosh]

00:15:27.729 --> 00:15:29.463 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:15:29.597 --> 00:15:31.633 position:27% line:89% align:start
[whoosh, crashes]

00:15:31.766 --> 00:15:33.000 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:15:34.569 --> 00:15:35.537 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:15:43.143 --> 00:15:44.546 position:41% line:89% align:start
[thud]

00:15:45.847 --> 00:15:47.214 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Seriously, people.

00:15:47.347 --> 00:15:48.883 position:21% line:89% align:start
Give me some credit.

00:15:49.016 --> 00:15:51.820 position:7% line:83% align:start
You think a Seven Star like me
wouldn't see through that?

00:15:51.985 --> 00:15:53.922 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SUZURAN]
What just happened?

00:15:54.455 --> 00:15:57.157 position:5% line:83% align:start
For all three of your abilities,
we'll use "Completely Disable".

00:15:57.291 --> 00:15:58.459 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Huh?

00:15:58.593 --> 00:16:00.260 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
It's an assist ability

00:16:00.394 --> 00:16:01.930 position:16% line:83% align:start
that temporarily disables
your opponent's defenses.

00:16:02.062 --> 00:16:04.231 position:33% line:83% align:start
It's utility
is context specific,

00:16:04.364 --> 00:16:05.900 position:19% line:89% align:start
so it rarely gets used,

00:16:06.033 --> 00:16:07.735 position:27% line:83% align:start
but it's perfect
against Nullify.

00:16:07.869 --> 00:16:10.304 position:30% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Okay,
but why use it for all three?

00:16:10.437 --> 00:16:12.039 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
At your true level, Master,

00:16:12.172 --> 00:16:14.642 position:13% line:83% align:start
one Level Three obstructive
ability will not be sufficient.

00:16:14.776 --> 00:16:18.145 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hence the redundancies.
The aggregation will compensate.

00:16:18.278 --> 00:16:19.848 position:30% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Yeah,
but what about the rest of it?

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:22.416 position:13% line:83% align:start
Won't I need some abilities
on hand to balance out?

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:25.185 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Oh, wait.
-[SHIRAYUKI] Now you get it.

00:16:25.687 --> 00:16:27.922 position:7% line:83% align:start
With the Company on your side,
you don't need to worry

00:16:28.055 --> 00:16:29.524 position:33% line:83% align:start
about things
like fair balancing.

00:16:29.657 --> 00:16:31.860 position:19% line:83% align:start
As long as our external
interference is unchecked,

00:16:31.992 --> 00:16:34.261 position:13% line:83% align:start
we can accomplish whatever
we need through hacking.

00:16:34.394 --> 00:16:35.630 position:19% line:89% align:start
So ultimately, Master,

00:16:35.763 --> 00:16:37.331 position:21% line:83% align:start
/the only real threat
you were facing

00:16:37.464 --> 00:16:39.233 position:13% line:89% align:start
/was Nullify Interference.

00:16:39.466 --> 00:16:42.937 position:10% line:83% align:start
The first ability I chose was
Completely Disable, Level Seven.

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:45.305 position:24% line:83% align:start
That made sure that
my second ability, Force Stop,

00:16:45.439 --> 00:16:46.941 position:16% line:89% align:start
was entirely unhindered.

00:16:47.474 --> 00:16:49.309 position:30% line:83% align:start
But in reality,
it was Kagaya's hacking

00:16:49.443 --> 00:16:52.145 position:16% line:83% align:start
that made the bike stop,
after I restored her access.

00:16:52.279 --> 00:16:55.550 position:16% line:83% align:start
Oh, and for the last one,
my third choice,

00:16:55.683 --> 00:16:57.719 position:19% line:83% align:start
that we also activated
by hacking,

00:16:57.852 --> 00:17:00.722 position:24% line:83% align:start

I can't believe that worked!

The Company is amazing!

While seeing you embarrassed
in public

00:17:25.112 --> 00:17:26.346 position:5% line:89% align:start
would bring me nothing but joy,

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:28.115 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm at least glad
you didn't lose to her.

00:17:28.248 --> 00:17:30.217 position:16% line:83% align:start
That honor's mine alone,
you hear?

00:17:30.652 --> 00:17:33.721 position:10% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Hey, are you trying
to tear off my tie, or my head?

00:17:33.855 --> 00:17:34.789 position:38% line:89% align:start
[scoffs]

00:17:36.089 --> 00:17:37.559 position:27% line:89% align:start
She's so violent.

00:17:40.862 --> 00:17:42.329 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Hey, Miss Himeji?

00:17:42.462 --> 00:17:44.498 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI] There's no need
for the "Miss", Master.

00:17:44.632 --> 00:17:47.467 position:7% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] My bad. Could you stop
listening in for a while?

00:17:47.602 --> 00:17:49.037 position:5% line:89% align:start
There's something I've gotta do,

00:17:49.169 --> 00:17:51.071 position:30% line:83% align:start
and I, uh kinda
wanna keep it private.

00:17:51.204 --> 00:17:53.340 position:16% line:89% align:start
I see. Is that an order?

00:17:53.808 --> 00:17:55.475 position:21% line:89% align:start
A request. So please.

00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:58.245 position:35% line:83% align:start
Very well,
if that's what you want, Master.

00:17:58.378 --> 00:17:59.781 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
It is, thank you.

00:18:00.113 --> 00:18:01.448 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
Right, but do you know

00:18:01.583 --> 00:18:03.216 position:38% line:83% align:start
I'm quite
the perceptive maid, Master.

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:05.553 position:21% line:83% align:start
If you're to exploit
your popularity to pick up girls

00:18:05.687 --> 00:18:07.922 position:33% line:83% align:start
then I trust
you'll exercise discretion.

00:18:08.056 --> 00:18:09.591 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Like I'd even do that!

00:18:09.724 --> 00:18:11.224 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
I'm kidding. Anyway.

00:18:11.358 --> 00:18:13.260 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'll disable the monitoring
for now.

00:18:13.761 --> 00:18:15.930 position:10% line:83% align:start
Please proceed with caution,
Master.

00:18:19.232 --> 00:18:20.902 position:16% line:89% align:start
You're ridiculously late.

00:18:21.035 --> 00:18:22.704 position:21% line:83% align:start
Come on, do you know
how hard this place is

00:18:22.837 --> 00:18:25.506 position:21% line:83% align:start
to find for newbies?
It's like a gangster hideout.

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:27.474 position:24% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Honestly,
it's a miracle I found it all.

00:18:27.609 --> 00:18:29.611 position:16% line:83% align:start
And I came straight away
like you asked, didn't I?

00:18:29.744 --> 00:18:32.647 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SARASA] Oh, it's excuse
after excuse with you, isn't it?

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:35.683 position:7% line:83% align:start
Your mouth opens and out pours
an endless stream of nonsense.

00:18:35.817 --> 00:18:37.785 position:33% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Hey,
you have no business talking!

00:18:37.919 --> 00:18:40.420 position:13% line:83% align:start
What happened to that cute,
well-mannered princess I met?

00:18:40.555 --> 00:18:43.858 position:7% line:83% align:start
Uh? Cute? Well, I can't afford
to leave the real Sarasa

00:18:43.992 --> 00:18:46.027 position:7% line:83% align:start
a less-than-perfect reputation,
right?

00:18:46.561 --> 00:18:48.228 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
So, what's all this

00:18:48.362 --> 00:18:51.032 position:13% line:83% align:start
"Sarasa-body-double" stuff
about, anyway?

00:18:51.164 --> 00:18:53.166 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SARASA]
Alright. I'll tell you.

00:18:53.601 --> 00:18:55.302 position:5% line:89% align:start
But this stays between us, okay?

00:18:55.435 --> 00:18:57.005 position:21% line:83% align:start
Just like the secret
you told me.

00:18:57.137 --> 00:18:58.238 position:24% line:89% align:start
My lips are sealed.

00:18:58.539 --> 00:19:01.042 position:30% line:83% align:start
The real Sarasa
was actually kidnapped.

00:19:01.174 --> 00:19:02.342 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Kidnapped?

00:19:03.578 --> 00:19:05.445 position:10% line:89% align:start
It was just over a year ago,

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:07.715 position:16% line:83% align:start
shortly before I entered
Ouka Academy.

00:19:07.849 --> 00:19:10.652 position:16% line:83% align:start
But whoever kidnapped her
didn't issue any demands.

00:19:10.785 --> 00:19:12.720 position:21% line:83% align:start
[SARASA] I was a part
of Sarasa's friend group,

00:19:12.854 --> 00:19:15.355 position:13% line:83% align:start
so while her family waited
for leads on the kidnapper,

00:19:15.489 --> 00:19:17.091 position:7% line:89% align:start
I was asked to take her place.

00:19:17.224 --> 00:19:18.993 position:16% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] What do you mean
when you say, "Friend group"?

00:19:19.127 --> 00:19:22.030 position:5% line:83% align:start
[SARASA] Children of the Saionji
family almost never go outside

00:19:22.162 --> 00:19:23.631 position:5% line:89% align:start
until they get into high school.

00:19:23.765 --> 00:19:26.067 position:19% line:83% align:start
Teachers and companions
are provided for them.

00:19:26.199 --> 00:19:27.535 position:35% line:89% align:start
Naturally,

00:19:27.669 --> 00:19:28.870 position:13% line:83% align:start
as a fantastically talented
and sweet girl,

00:19:29.003 --> 00:19:29.937 position:33% line:89% align:start
I was chosen.

00:19:30.071 --> 00:19:31.973 position:5% line:89% align:start
Better just let that one slide.

00:19:32.472 --> 00:19:34.776 position:35% line:83% align:start
Nobody knew
what her real face looked like.

00:19:34.909 --> 00:19:38.345 position:10% line:83% align:start
The Saionjis needed someone,
and I was happy to help them.

00:19:38.478 --> 00:19:40.882 position:33% line:83% align:start
I don't know
when she'll be returned to us,

00:19:41.015 --> 00:19:43.283 position:16% line:83% align:start
but until that day comes,
I have to protect

00:19:43.417 --> 00:19:45.720 position:27% line:83% align:start
Sarasa Saionji's
flawless reputation.

00:19:45.853 --> 00:19:48.422 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna need your help
with doing that, though.

00:19:48.556 --> 00:19:50.290 position:16% line:83% align:start
Because if words gets out
that I'm a fake,

00:19:50.424 --> 00:19:52.325 position:24% line:83% align:start
then what'll become
of the real Sarasa?

00:19:52.459 --> 00:19:53.695 position:33% line:89% align:start
The situation

00:19:53.828 --> 00:19:55.195 position:19% line:83% align:start
is significantly worse
than I thought.

00:19:55.328 --> 00:19:56.731 position:24% line:83% align:start
I can see the bind
that you're in.

00:19:56.864 --> 00:19:58.800 position:10% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] You were able to lie
about who you were

00:19:58.933 --> 00:20:00.300 position:16% line:89% align:start
because of the Red Star.

00:20:00.434 --> 00:20:02.335 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SARASA] That's right,
and should you lose,

00:20:02.469 --> 00:20:03.604 position:24% line:89% align:start
my secret gets out.

00:20:03.738 --> 00:20:05.640 position:13% line:89% align:start
Whoever holds the Red Star,

00:20:05.773 --> 00:20:08.341 position:16% line:83% align:start
can see the entire record
of lies told with it.

00:20:08.743 --> 00:20:10.243 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
So then, if I ever lose,

00:20:10.377 --> 00:20:11.879 position:16% line:83% align:start
your lies will be exposed
as well as mine.

00:20:12.013 --> 00:20:14.048 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SARASA] If it gets out
that I'm not the true daughter

00:20:14.182 --> 00:20:15.783 position:19% line:89% align:start
of the Saionji family,

00:20:15.917 --> 00:20:18.586 position:7% line:83% align:start
then Eimei's Headmistress will
have no reason to protect you.

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:22.222 position:5% line:83% align:start
She thinks you beat the Empress,
but I'm just Rina Akabane.

00:20:22.523 --> 00:20:25.526 position:21% line:83% align:start
And then, of course.
I'd have to leave the island.

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:28.129 position:33% line:83% align:start
Hm? Why would
you be worried about leaving?

00:20:28.261 --> 00:20:29.831 position:13% line:89% align:start
Is staying that important?

00:20:29.964 --> 00:20:31.264 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Yeah, it is.

00:20:31.398 --> 00:20:32.867 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SARASA]
Why?

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.036 position:19% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Well, you see.
There's someone I'm looking for.

00:20:35.169 --> 00:20:37.672 position:13% line:83% align:start
A childhood friend of mine
I haven't seen in years,

00:20:37.805 --> 00:20:40.007 position:33% line:83% align:start
but I'm sure
she's here on the island.

00:20:40.141 --> 00:20:41.843 position:16% line:89% align:start
And so, until I find her,

00:20:41.976 --> 00:20:44.645 position:24% line:83% align:start
getting kicked out
is just not an option for me.

00:20:45.747 --> 00:20:47.115 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SARASA]
That means...

00:20:47.247 --> 00:20:49.217 position:19% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] My only option
is to maintain the lie

00:20:49.349 --> 00:20:51.152 position:5% line:89% align:start
that I'm the strongest there is.

00:20:51.284 --> 00:20:52.920 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SARASA]
You know, I hate to admit it,

00:20:53.054 --> 00:20:55.056 position:5% line:89% align:start
but as long you continue to win.

00:20:55.189 --> 00:20:57.925 position:10% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] My lie and your lie
will be protected.

00:20:58.391 --> 00:21:00.427 position:5% line:89% align:start
Guess we've formed an alliance.

00:21:01.095 --> 00:21:02.530 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:21:02.663 --> 00:21:04.766 position:21% line:83% align:start
Shall we exchange IDs
so we can stay in contact, then?

00:21:04.899 --> 00:21:08.401 position:19% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Yeah, I guess.
Wait. My name's top trending?

00:21:08.536 --> 00:21:09.804 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SARASA]
What are you talking about?

00:21:09.937 --> 00:21:11.572 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's been like that
since you got here.

00:21:11.706 --> 00:21:13.440 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Ew, what's with this guy?

00:21:13.574 --> 00:21:14.876 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's all "my goddess"

00:21:15.009 --> 00:21:16.644 position:7% line:83% align:start
and "she isn't made for losing"
and stuff.

00:21:16.778 --> 00:21:18.880 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are all your fans this zealous?

00:21:19.013 --> 00:21:21.182 position:13% line:83% align:start
I attract a whole spectrum
of them,

00:21:21.314 --> 00:21:22.884 position:38% line:83% align:start
but when
you're as talented as I am,

00:21:23.017 --> 00:21:25.153 position:21% line:83% align:start
some people are bound
to be mesmerized.

00:21:25.285 --> 00:21:27.054 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm calling you out on that one.

00:21:27.955 --> 00:21:31.458 position:19% line:83% align:start
Look, it might be best
if we act friendly.

00:21:31.893 --> 00:21:35.029 position:19% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] You're right.
I mean, after all, we're allies.

00:21:39.233 --> 00:21:40.367 position:33% line:89% align:start
[door opens]

[gasps]

00:21:42.402 --> 00:21:44.471 position:21% line:83% align:start
Good evening, Master,
welcome home.

00:21:44.605 --> 00:21:46.439 position:13% line:89% align:start
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:21:48.709 --> 00:21:49.610 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh?

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:52.713 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ah-ha! So he's alive after all.

00:21:52.847 --> 00:21:54.882 position:5% line:83% align:start
[SARASA] Why the heck didn't you
send me a text last night,

00:21:55.016 --> 00:21:56.284 position:24% line:89% align:start
you arrogant jerk?

00:21:56.416 --> 00:21:59.253 position:30% line:83% align:start
Sorry, my bad.
Busy schedule, you know?

00:21:59.419 --> 00:22:00.955 position:10% line:89% align:start
Life of a Seven Star and all.

00:22:01.088 --> 00:22:03.356 position:33% line:83% align:start
That's a lie.
I was totally passed out.

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:05.059 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh, stop showing off.

00:22:05.193 --> 00:22:08.196 position:13% line:83% align:start
I just swung by to show you
that you hadn't broken me yet.

00:22:08.328 --> 00:22:09.764 position:41% line:89% align:start
Humph!

00:22:09.897 --> 00:22:11.498 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]
