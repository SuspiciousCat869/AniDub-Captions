[laughs]

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:19.888 position:24% line:83% align:start
Greetings, goddess.
It's an honor.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.154 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:00:21.288 --> 00:00:23.858 position:10% line:83% align:start
Ah, the infamous Seven Star,
himself.

00:00:23.992 --> 00:00:25.425 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm Seiran Kugasaki,

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.461 position:13% line:83% align:start
the man who will bring you
crashing to your knees.

00:00:27.595 --> 00:00:30.532 position:24% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Ah! Well,
you need something, or?

00:00:30.665 --> 00:00:32.432 position:19% line:83% align:start
You usurped the throne
of a goddess,

00:00:32.567 --> 00:00:35.737 position:24% line:83% align:start
and decency demands
satisfaction, sir!

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.204 position:21% line:89% align:start
[chuckles] Oh, yeah?

00:00:37.337 --> 00:00:38.840 position:13% line:83% align:start
You're here to challenge me
to a game, then?

00:00:38.973 --> 00:00:40.474 position:35% line:89% align:start
Not quite.

00:00:40.608 --> 00:00:43.845 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm simply here to demonstrate
how far above you I am.

00:00:43.978 --> 00:00:47.314 position:7% line:83% align:start
If that's your idea of a joke,
you need better material.

00:00:47.447 --> 00:00:49.851 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'll take you on under
one condition.

00:00:49.984 --> 00:00:51.351 position:35% line:89% align:start
Shinohara?

00:00:51.485 --> 00:00:52.787 position:19% line:89% align:start
Whoever loses the game,

00:00:52.921 --> 00:00:54.454 position:7% line:83% align:start
forfeits the right to challenge
the Empress,

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:57.391 position:13% line:89% align:start
Sarasa Saionji, ever again.

00:00:57.525 --> 00:00:59.027 position:35% line:83% align:start
[KUGASAKI]
How dare you.

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:02.396 position:13% line:83% align:start
My virtuous goddess is not
fodder for some asinine bet!

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.866 position:30% line:83% align:start
Don't like it?
Fight someone else.

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:07.200 position:19% line:83% align:start
Nobody would blame you
for chickening out.

00:01:07.334 --> 00:01:10.038 position:13% line:83% align:start
"Chickening out," you say?
Seiran Kugasaki?

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.776 position:13% line:83% align:start
The five-star leader of the
Self-Made Holy Knight Brigade?

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.343 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hiroto Shinohara!

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:19.212 position:19% line:83% align:start
I hereby challenge you
to a game two days from now.

00:01:19.346 --> 00:01:21.516 position:35% line:83% align:start
[chuckles]
Have it your way. This Sunday,

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:25.252 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'll teach you exactly what
level you're at, Count Dorkula.

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:27.454 position:33% line:89% align:start
[both growls]

00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:30.157 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.959 position:24% line:83% align:start
[SARASA] Ah, good.
It is you, Shinohara.

00:03:12.093 --> 00:03:14.962 position:7% line:83% align:start
I thought you were someone else
for a second there.

00:03:15.096 --> 00:03:16.363 position:5% line:89% align:start
You say that, but you're the one

00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:18.533 position:10% line:83% align:start
that looks totally different
from normal.

00:03:18.666 --> 00:03:21.736 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Oh? Yeah?
-Yeah, like super sketchy.

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:22.904 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:03:25.106 --> 00:03:28.776 position:13% line:83% align:start
Hey, you didn't accept that
challenge for my sake, did you?

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.411 position:24% line:89% align:start
No, of course not.

00:03:31.546 --> 00:03:33.681 position:10% line:83% align:start
I was just trying to protect
my lie is all.

00:03:33.815 --> 00:03:35.183 position:35% line:89% align:start
You dummy,

00:03:35.315 --> 00:03:37.852 position:13% line:83% align:start
you don't always have to be
so brutally honest, you know?

00:03:37.985 --> 00:03:39.887 position:21% line:89% align:start
But still, thank you.

00:03:40.021 --> 00:03:41.155 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:03:41.288 --> 00:03:43.124 position:5% line:89% align:start
Anyway! You know the situation.

00:03:43.256 --> 00:03:45.560 position:21% line:83% align:start
For better or worse,
our lies are linked together.

00:03:45.693 --> 00:03:48.796 position:13% line:83% align:start
Let's hurry up and get this
strategy meeting over with.

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:55.169 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI] Welcome home,
Master Shinohara.

00:03:55.302 --> 00:03:56.904 position:10% line:89% align:start
And welcome to you too, Miss.

00:03:57.038 --> 00:04:01.876 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Thank you. What the--
-What's she doing here?

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:05.079 position:24% line:83% align:start
Himeji, do you know
who this really is?

00:04:05.213 --> 00:04:07.181 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yes. Quite intimately.

00:04:07.314 --> 00:04:09.416 position:30% line:83% align:start
I used to serve
the Saionji family.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.052 position:30% line:89% align:start
Does that mean.

00:04:11.185 --> 00:04:14.889 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yes, I'm one of the select
few privy to Miss Rina's secret.

00:04:15.623 --> 00:04:20.695 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ah, well. Nice to see you, Yuki.

00:04:20.828 --> 00:04:21.963 position:41% line:89% align:start
Indeed.

00:04:22.096 --> 00:04:23.898 position:13% line:83% align:start
I believe it's been a year
since we last met.

00:04:24.031 --> 00:04:25.867 position:13% line:89% align:start
A year, huh? So what's up?

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.268 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Have you been good?
-I suppose.

00:04:28.401 --> 00:04:31.773 position:7% line:83% align:start
Although I did endure a period
of psychological distress.

00:04:31.906 --> 00:04:35.843 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Come this way, please.
-Yeah, that's right.

00:04:35.977 --> 00:04:39.147 position:10% line:83% align:start
The real Sarasa was kidnapped
a year ago, wasn't she?

00:04:39.847 --> 00:04:41.816 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI] This is the game
that Mister Kugasaki

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:43.117 position:30% line:89% align:start
has requested.

00:04:43.251 --> 00:04:45.653 position:13% line:89% align:start
The Self-Made 27-Form Game

00:04:45.787 --> 00:04:49.257 position:7% line:83% align:start
Essentially, you collect cards
and compete numerically.

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:51.526 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Compete numerically?
-[SHIRAYUKI] Yes.

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:54.662 position:13% line:83% align:start
The game itself is divided
into two distinct phases.

00:04:54.796 --> 00:04:57.364 position:33% line:83% align:start
The first is
the collection phase.

00:04:57.999 --> 00:05:00.501 position:7% line:83% align:start
Players hunt for cards numbered
zero-to-nineteen,

00:05:00.635 --> 00:05:02.203 position:5% line:89% align:start
scattered around District Four.

00:05:02.335 --> 00:05:04.539 position:16% line:83% align:start
Building a hand of five,
from those found.

00:05:04.672 --> 00:05:07.074 position:7% line:83% align:start
So then, we basically just walk
around looking for cards?

00:05:07.208 --> 00:05:10.745 position:19% line:83% align:start
No, you can use public
transportation as well.

00:05:10.878 --> 00:05:12.613 position:16% line:83% align:start
Five cards will be placed
at random,

00:05:12.747 --> 00:05:13.981 position:10% line:5% align:start
and then every five minutes,

00:05:14.115 --> 00:05:16.584 position:13% line:83% align:start
the location of a new card
is unveiled.

00:05:17.384 --> 00:05:20.521 position:16% line:5% align:start
Lemme guess, if you go to
one of the revealed locations,

00:05:20.655 --> 00:05:22.657 position:16% line:83% align:start
your Device will collect
the corresponding card, right?

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:24.659 position:13% line:89% align:start
That is correct, Miss Rina.

00:05:24.792 --> 00:05:26.794 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay, what happens in Phase Two?

00:05:26.928 --> 00:05:28.461 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
Direct confrontation.

00:05:28.596 --> 00:05:30.064 position:27% line:89% align:start
The reveal phase.

00:05:30.765 --> 00:05:32.867 position:24% line:83% align:start
Each player selects
one card from their hand,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.802 position:27% line:83% align:start
and the card with
the higher number wins.

00:05:34.936 --> 00:05:38.272 position:10% line:83% align:start
This occurs again until both
hands have been exhausted.

00:05:38.405 --> 00:05:39.774 position:27% line:89% align:start
If I understand,

00:05:39.907 --> 00:05:41.609 position:24% line:83% align:start
the first to claim
three points is the winner.

00:05:41.742 --> 00:05:44.344 position:13% line:83% align:start
True, but before we move on
to strategy,

00:05:44.477 --> 00:05:46.214 position:27% line:83% align:start
there's something
you need to know.

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:48.816 position:10% line:83% align:start
There've been many instances
of games with a level gap

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.619 position:10% line:83% align:start
akin to this Five Star versus
One Star match.

00:05:51.752 --> 00:05:54.421 position:21% line:83% align:start
But there's no record
of a One Star ever winning.

00:05:54.555 --> 00:05:55.523 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:05:55.656 --> 00:05:57.091 position:33% line:89% align:start
Not even one?

00:05:57.225 --> 00:05:59.694 position:16% line:83% align:start
But Academy Island's been
around for twenty years!

00:05:59.827 --> 00:06:01.596 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's just like Yuki said.

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:03.764 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SARASA] Do you remember
'Numerical Adjustment',

00:06:03.898 --> 00:06:04.999 position:35% line:89% align:start
Shinohara?

00:06:05.132 --> 00:06:06.901 position:24% line:83% align:start
That ability I used
during our first game?

00:06:07.034 --> 00:06:08.435 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Yeah.

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:10.403 position:10% line:83% align:start
The one that reduced my turn
to one-tenth of the time-limit.

00:06:10.538 --> 00:06:13.406 position:7% line:83% align:start
[SARASA] With it, you can mess
with numerical values in a game.

00:06:13.541 --> 00:06:16.277 position:13% line:83% align:start
So, even though the largest
value possible is nineteen,

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:19.313 position:10% line:83% align:start
with Kugasaki's rank he could
increase that to thirty.

00:06:19.446 --> 00:06:20.480 position:33% line:89% align:start
Whoa? Thirty?

00:06:20.615 --> 00:06:22.283 position:7% line:89% align:start
It's a rather steep advantage,

00:06:22.415 --> 00:06:25.820 position:10% line:83% align:start
hence lower-ranks can dictate
the rules to offset it.

00:06:25.953 --> 00:06:28.356 position:19% line:83% align:start
But because of my lie,
I don't have that option.

00:06:28.488 --> 00:06:29.790 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's bleak, indeed.

00:06:29.924 --> 00:06:32.492 position:7% line:83% align:start
Less than a one-percent chance
of winning.

00:06:32.627 --> 00:06:34.729 position:10% line:89% align:start
And a 100% chance I'll lose?

00:06:34.862 --> 00:06:37.064 position:13% line:83% align:start
-But we can fix that, yeah?
-Right.

00:06:37.198 --> 00:06:40.134 position:16% line:83% align:start
The trick to winning lies
within the collection phase.

00:06:41.202 --> 00:06:43.004 position:33% line:83% align:start
Obstruct your
opponent's movements,

00:06:43.137 --> 00:06:45.339 position:10% line:83% align:start
and you can buy yourself time
to build a hand that will win

00:06:45.472 --> 00:06:47.708 position:7% line:83% align:start
even if 'Numerical Adjustment'
is used.

00:06:47.842 --> 00:06:49.343 position:35% line:83% align:start
If he comes
into the reveal phase

00:06:49.476 --> 00:06:50.878 position:10% line:89% align:start
having amassed a strong hand

00:06:51.012 --> 00:06:53.714 position:19% line:83% align:start
then the game's as good
as over for you.

00:06:53.848 --> 00:06:55.116 position:21% line:89% align:start
Kugasaki always uses

00:06:55.249 --> 00:06:57.752 position:13% line:83% align:start
the Emergency Mobilization
ability as well.

00:06:57.885 --> 00:07:00.388 position:16% line:83% align:start
'Emergency Mobilization'
circumvents the rule

00:07:00.521 --> 00:07:01.989 position:13% line:89% align:start
on third-party involvement,

00:07:02.123 --> 00:07:04.725 position:10% line:83% align:start
as those the ability summons
also count as a player.

00:07:04.859 --> 00:07:07.862 position:33% line:83% align:start
Each of them,
permitted one ability.

00:07:07.995 --> 00:07:10.698 position:19% line:83% align:start
And Kugasaki leads the
Self-Made Holy Knight Brigade

00:07:10.831 --> 00:07:12.233 position:19% line:89% align:start
that's over 300 strong.

00:07:12.366 --> 00:07:13.668 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
You're telling me

00:07:13.801 --> 00:07:15.468 position:5% line:83% align:start
he can bring a legion of fanboys
into the game?

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:18.039 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SARASA] Well, at least you
don't have to worry about his

00:07:18.172 --> 00:07:19.173 position:30% line:89% align:start
third ability.

00:07:19.307 --> 00:07:20.841 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
And why is that exactly?

00:07:20.975 --> 00:07:24.111 position:5% line:83% align:start
You remember that "Indigo Star"
ability that he used, don't you?

00:07:24.245 --> 00:07:25.713 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:07:25.846 --> 00:07:28.716 position:7% line:83% align:start
Yeah. That flashy move with all
the smoke and lightning.

00:07:30.751 --> 00:07:33.120 position:19% line:83% align:start
Is that the one called
"Black Wings"?

00:07:33.254 --> 00:07:35.056 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yeah, it must really jive
with his style,

00:07:35.189 --> 00:07:37.858 position:13% line:83% align:start
because he's never disabled
the effect since he acquired it.

00:07:37.992 --> 00:07:39.927 position:24% line:83% align:start
Meaning, Kugasaki's
ability selection

00:07:40.061 --> 00:07:41.929 position:30% line:83% align:start
will likely be
Numerical Adjustment,

00:07:42.063 --> 00:07:45.433 position:19% line:83% align:start
as well as Black Wings
and Emergency Mobilization.

00:07:46.133 --> 00:07:48.703 position:10% line:83% align:start
So, how would you play this,
Saionji?

00:07:48.836 --> 00:07:50.838 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'd probably rewrite my position

00:07:50.972 --> 00:07:53.107 position:27% line:83% align:start
using 'Manipulate
Location Coordinates'.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.675 position:19% line:89% align:start
Tell me about that one.

00:07:54.976 --> 00:07:56.277 position:38% line:5% align:start
[SARASA]
It tricks the Device

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:58.012 position:21% line:5% align:start
into thinking you're
at a card's location,

00:07:58.145 --> 00:07:59.914 position:13% line:5% align:start
letting you pick up numbers
without even moving.

00:08:00.047 --> 00:08:01.816 position:38% line:5% align:start
[HIROTO]
That's an actual ability?

00:08:01.949 --> 00:08:03.184 position:38% line:5% align:start
[SARASA]
You can only install it

00:08:03.317 --> 00:08:05.519 position:7% line:5% align:start
if you're Five Stars or above,
though.

00:08:05.653 --> 00:08:08.756 position:7% line:5% align:start
Another possible strategy would
be using the Explore ability

00:08:08.889 --> 00:08:12.193 position:19% line:5% align:start
to look up all the card
locations right from the start.

00:08:12.326 --> 00:08:13.728 position:19% line:89% align:start
District four's so big,

00:08:13.861 --> 00:08:16.063 position:13% line:83% align:start
that might actually do more
to hinder than help.

00:08:16.197 --> 00:08:17.298 position:35% line:89% align:start
So, Himeji.

00:08:17.431 --> 00:08:19.600 position:19% line:83% align:start
Are there any One Star
abilities available

00:08:19.734 --> 00:08:21.936 position:13% line:83% align:start
that could be useful to me
in this situation?

00:08:22.069 --> 00:08:23.504 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
For this game, 'Display Bug'

00:08:23.637 --> 00:08:25.406 position:21% line:89% align:start
might be appropriate.

00:08:25.539 --> 00:08:29.310 position:13% line:83% align:start
I see. Make the opponent's
Device screen glitch out, huh?

00:08:29.443 --> 00:08:33.781 position:7% line:83% align:start
For slot two, the Luck ability
might serve to even the odds.

00:08:33.914 --> 00:08:36.250 position:16% line:83% align:start
The more high-value cards
appear near you,

00:08:36.384 --> 00:08:38.119 position:5% line:89% align:start
the less work you'll have to do.

00:08:38.252 --> 00:08:41.155 position:7% line:83% align:start
Right and numerical adjustment
in the third.

00:08:41.288 --> 00:08:42.590 position:27% line:89% align:start
Actually, Master,

00:08:42.723 --> 00:08:44.492 position:21% line:83% align:start
since the real battle
is the collection phase,

00:08:44.625 --> 00:08:46.961 position:10% line:89% align:start
that might not be necessary.

00:08:47.094 --> 00:08:50.264 position:16% line:83% align:start
True, but it never hurts
to have a backup plan.

00:08:50.398 --> 00:08:51.866 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
Very well, then.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.336 position:21% line:83% align:start
So, Numerical, Luck,
and Display Bug.

00:08:55.469 --> 00:08:56.570 position:16% line:89% align:start
With what I can use now,

00:08:56.704 --> 00:08:59.306 position:30% line:83% align:start
that's probably
my best strategy.

00:09:04.745 --> 00:09:07.381 position:21% line:83% align:start
Will you tell me why
you've been avoiding her?

00:09:07.516 --> 00:09:08.883 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
I haven't.

00:09:09.016 --> 00:09:11.085 position:19% line:83% align:start
In fact Rina's the one
who's been avoiding me.

00:09:11.218 --> 00:09:13.421 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh, "Rina", huh?

00:09:14.055 --> 00:09:16.490 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI] Our history
kind of trivializes formality.

00:09:16.624 --> 00:09:18.527 position:24% line:83% align:start
For a time she was
my closest friend.

00:09:18.659 --> 00:09:20.261 position:19% line:89% align:start
Why the distance, then?

00:09:20.394 --> 00:09:22.830 position:10% line:83% align:start
I think Rina's trying to hide
something from me

00:09:22.963 --> 00:09:25.933 position:19% line:83% align:start
and the Saionji family,
but I don't know what it is.

00:09:26.067 --> 00:09:29.670 position:10% line:83% align:start
My only wish is that you do
what you can to protect her.

00:09:29.804 --> 00:09:32.306 position:16% line:83% align:start
She's a lot more fragile
than she seems.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.041 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:09:35.443 --> 00:09:36.410 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SUZURAN]
All righty!

00:09:36.545 --> 00:09:37.978 position:19% line:89% align:start
The collection phase of

00:09:38.112 --> 00:09:41.182 position:5% line:83% align:start
the Self-Made twenty-seven-point
game start right meow!

00:09:41.315 --> 00:09:43.084 position:41% line:89% align:start
[cheer]

00:09:43.217 --> 00:09:45.853 position:10% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Why are these things
always so intense?

00:09:45.986 --> 00:09:47.788 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
Connection established.

00:09:47.922 --> 00:09:49.156 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Cool.

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:51.358 position:16% line:89% align:start
Display Bug is activated.

00:09:51.492 --> 00:09:52.827 position:10% line:89% align:start
And thanks to "Luck" ability,

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.495 position:16% line:83% align:start
the higher-numbered cards
seem to be nearby.

00:09:54.628 --> 00:09:57.798 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI] Good. Proceed
to fourteen, it's the closest.

00:09:57.932 --> 00:09:59.266 position:13% line:89% align:start
Once the next card appears,

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.901 position:19% line:83% align:start
we'll weigh its value
against the seventeen,

00:10:01.035 --> 00:10:02.937 position:19% line:89% align:start
to optimize your route.

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:05.406 position:21% line:89% align:start
Roger that. Let's go!

00:10:06.273 --> 00:10:09.677 position:16% line:83% align:start
You know, that seventeen
isn't exactly close by, right?

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:11.045 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
Not a problem.

00:10:11.178 --> 00:10:13.447 position:24% line:83% align:start
I've established a
nearby bus service.

00:10:13.582 --> 00:10:15.950 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
The Company to the rescue!

00:10:16.083 --> 00:10:19.386 position:5% line:83% align:start
[sighs] It looks like Kugasaki's
already collected the five.

00:10:19.521 --> 00:10:21.590 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI] It's possible
he simply had the good fortune

00:10:21.722 --> 00:10:23.090 position:21% line:89% align:start
of starting near it,

00:10:23.224 --> 00:10:24.925 position:16% line:83% align:start
but he likely knows about
the Display Bug by now.

00:10:25.059 --> 00:10:28.195 position:16% line:83% align:start
I wonder how he'll choose
to proceed. [gasps]

00:10:28.329 --> 00:10:30.698 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hey, what's wrong?

00:10:30.831 --> 00:10:32.266 position:38% line:89% align:start
Well, um.

00:10:32.399 --> 00:10:33.801 position:21% line:83% align:start
It would appear that
Mister Kugasaki just picked up

00:10:33.934 --> 00:10:35.202 position:27% line:89% align:start
his second card.

00:10:35.336 --> 00:10:36.403 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
[sighs]

00:10:36.538 --> 00:10:37.938 position:13% line:83% align:start
That's weird, the number of
active cards

00:10:38.072 --> 00:10:39.974 position:10% line:83% align:start
is still displaying the same
for me.

00:10:40.107 --> 00:10:42.409 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI] Interesting,
he must have picked up one

00:10:42.544 --> 00:10:44.513 position:10% line:83% align:start
who's number and coordinates
hadn't been revealed yet.

00:10:44.645 --> 00:10:48.315 position:7% line:83% align:start
Wait. Does that mean he's using
the Explore ability?

00:10:48.449 --> 00:10:50.184 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI] If he knew
the locations from the start,

00:10:50.317 --> 00:10:52.920 position:13% line:83% align:start
then logically he can snag
unrevealed cards,

00:10:53.053 --> 00:10:54.989 position:10% line:83% align:start
but why would he risk wasting
precious time

00:10:55.122 --> 00:10:57.091 position:13% line:89% align:start
going after unknown values?

00:10:57.224 --> 00:10:58.192 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:10:58.325 --> 00:11:00.194 position:33% line:83% align:start
Did he ditch
Numerical Adjustment?

00:11:00.327 --> 00:11:02.897 position:19% line:83% align:start
[KUGASAKI] Oh? You have
some game sense, after all.

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:04.932 position:13% line:89% align:start
Kugasaki? You can hear me?

00:11:05.065 --> 00:11:07.735 position:16% line:83% align:start
How the heck did you get
my device ID?

00:11:07.868 --> 00:11:09.803 position:13% line:83% align:start
[KUGASAKI] The Black Wings
ability is useful

00:11:09.937 --> 00:11:12.139 position:33% line:83% align:start
for more than
just stage effects.

00:11:12.273 --> 00:11:16.310 position:16% line:83% align:start
I can use it to transmit
my voice over vast distances.

00:11:16.443 --> 00:11:17.612 position:38% line:89% align:start
[groans]

00:11:17.745 --> 00:11:18.679 position:19% line:83% align:start
If you're just calling
to show off,

00:11:18.812 --> 00:11:20.114 position:21% line:89% align:start
then I'm hanging up.

00:11:20.247 --> 00:11:22.116 position:16% line:83% align:start
[KUGASAKI] Consider this
a gentleman's warning,

00:11:22.249 --> 00:11:24.485 position:30% line:83% align:start
your playstyle
is woefully shortsighted.

00:11:24.619 --> 00:11:25.920 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:11:26.053 --> 00:11:27.589 position:16% line:83% align:start
[KUGASAKI] At this rate,
my absolute victory

00:11:27.721 --> 00:11:29.190 position:19% line:89% align:start
is all but inevitable.

00:11:29.323 --> 00:11:30.391 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:11:30.525 --> 00:11:32.860 position:21% line:83% align:start
Tick-tock, Shinohara.
Two seconds left.

00:11:32.993 --> 00:11:35.162 position:21% line:89% align:start
Two seconds? [sighs]

00:11:35.296 --> 00:11:38.098 position:7% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] The game's only been
going for five minutes, right?

00:11:38.232 --> 00:11:40.868 position:10% line:89% align:start
Wait. Five minutes? Hang on.

00:11:41.001 --> 00:11:43.137 position:19% line:83% align:start
Shouldn't another card
have been revealed by now?

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:45.940 position:10% line:83% align:start
Why isn't any new information
showing up yet?

00:11:46.073 --> 00:11:47.609 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
I don't understand this.

00:11:47.741 --> 00:11:48.976 position:5% line:89% align:start
There's been nothing to indicate

00:11:49.109 --> 00:11:50.744 position:21% line:83% align:start
that Mister Kugasaki
picked up the ten,

00:11:50.878 --> 00:11:52.146 position:13% line:89% align:start
so why is it showing here?

00:11:52.279 --> 00:11:53.814 position:35% line:83% align:start
And why has
the unvalued second card

00:11:53.948 --> 00:11:55.282 position:16% line:89% align:start
he acquired disappeared?

00:11:55.416 --> 00:11:59.220 position:13% line:83% align:start
[gasps] No, that's not it,
not disappeared.

00:11:59.353 --> 00:12:01.722 position:33% line:83% align:start
It's just had
its information revealed.

00:12:01.855 --> 00:12:03.558 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
The second card was the ten?

00:12:03.692 --> 00:12:05.059 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Damn it!

00:12:05.192 --> 00:12:06.794 position:13% line:83% align:start
There wasn't any new info,
because that was it!

00:12:06.927 --> 00:12:09.096 position:16% line:89% align:start
That was the new reveal!

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:11.131 position:16% line:83% align:start
He's planning to look up
the card locations

00:12:11.265 --> 00:12:13.334 position:30% line:83% align:start
to collect them
before they're even displayed.

00:12:13.467 --> 00:12:14.935 position:27% line:89% align:start
If this keeps up,

00:12:15.069 --> 00:12:16.705 position:13% line:83% align:start
he'll shut-down my ability
to gather cards entirely!

00:12:16.837 --> 00:12:18.339 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
[gasps] But that means!

00:12:18.472 --> 00:12:19.873 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Yeah.

00:12:20.007 --> 00:12:21.375 position:13% line:83% align:start
He's trying to get eighteen
of the twenty cards

00:12:21.509 --> 00:12:23.310 position:19% line:83% align:start
in the collection phase
to guarantee victory.

00:12:25.145 --> 00:12:26.615 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
Master, we have a problem.

00:12:26.747 --> 00:12:29.183 position:16% line:83% align:start
The bus Kagaya's driving
isn't going to make it in time.

00:12:29.316 --> 00:12:30.585 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:12:30.719 --> 00:12:32.219 position:7% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Hot-rods with markings
of the Self-Made Knights

00:12:32.353 --> 00:12:33.988 position:27% line:83% align:start
have been racing
around District Four.

00:12:34.121 --> 00:12:35.990 position:7% line:83% align:start
The police have been called in
to stop them.

00:12:36.123 --> 00:12:39.326 position:41% line:83% align:start
[sighs]
Gotta be Emergency Mobilization.

00:12:40.261 --> 00:12:41.895 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
It's all ruined,

00:12:42.029 --> 00:12:43.897 position:16% line:83% align:start
this completely unravels
everything I had planned.

00:12:44.031 --> 00:12:46.200 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm afraid we've been
outmaneuvered!

00:12:46.834 --> 00:12:49.571 position:7% line:89% align:start
No, no way, it's not over yet!

00:12:49.704 --> 00:12:52.106 position:30% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI] But
what are you going to do now?

00:12:52.973 --> 00:12:56.678 position:41% line:89% align:start
[pants]

00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:58.513 position:44% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:12:58.647 --> 00:13:00.447 position:21% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Himeji's got
every right to be worried.

00:13:00.582 --> 00:13:03.050 position:16% line:83% align:start
Even if I take the train
to the seventeen.

00:13:03.183 --> 00:13:06.086 position:7% line:83% align:start
Kugasaki'll probably still get
there before me.

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:08.956 position:35% line:83% align:start
-What now?

[URASAKA]
Oh, Shinohara. 'Sup?

00:13:14.596 --> 00:13:15.963 position:38% line:89% align:start
Urasaka?

00:13:25.239 --> 00:13:27.841 position:10% line:83% align:start
[URASAKA] FYI, you can thank
Headmistress Ichinose,

00:13:27.975 --> 00:13:30.645 position:7% line:83% align:start
or whoever it was that secured
the business permit for me.

00:13:30.779 --> 00:13:32.846 position:13% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Fixing it so that
a motorcycle ride counts

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:34.048 position:16% line:89% align:start
as public transportation?

00:13:34.181 --> 00:13:35.784 position:21% line:89% align:start
That woman is shrewd.

00:13:35.916 --> 00:13:37.985 position:27% line:83% align:start
Anyway, I'm out.
Good luck, Shinohara.

00:13:38.118 --> 00:13:43.357 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Right, thank you very much.
-[engine revs]

00:13:45.527 --> 00:13:47.995 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI] Best estimates
would place the seventeen card

00:13:48.128 --> 00:13:49.830 position:10% line:89% align:start
on the second or third floor.

00:13:49.963 --> 00:13:52.032 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Got it. [gasps]

00:13:52.166 --> 00:13:54.368 position:24% line:89% align:start
Are you kidding me?

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:57.905 position:10% line:89% align:start
There's no way that's legal!

00:13:58.038 --> 00:14:00.508 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:14:00.642 --> 00:14:02.811 position:13% line:89% align:start
Just a little bit. Further.

00:14:02.943 --> 00:14:07.481 position:27% line:89% align:start
[screams] Got it!

[SUZURAN]
Me-ow-wow!

00:14:18.492 --> 00:14:21.462 position:13% line:83% align:start
Kugasaki takes another card
and is dominating right meow!

00:14:21.596 --> 00:14:23.330 position:13% line:83% align:start
Things aren't looking good
for Shinohara,

00:14:23.464 --> 00:14:27.968 position:5% line:83% align:start
who, with no mew cards, is just
a whisker away from catastrophe!

[gasps]

00:14:32.774 --> 00:14:33.974 position:41% line:89% align:start
Himeji?

00:14:36.276 --> 00:14:37.911 position:24% line:89% align:start
How long was I out?

00:14:38.045 --> 00:14:39.714 position:16% line:83% align:start
If he's already collected
eighteen cards,

00:14:39.848 --> 00:14:41.716 position:16% line:83% align:start
then this game's as good
as lost.

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:43.217 position:38% line:89% align:start
[groans]

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:45.185 position:10% line:89% align:start
No, it's too soon to give up.

00:14:45.319 --> 00:14:47.655 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm the only player using
Numerical Adjustment here.

00:14:47.789 --> 00:14:50.190 position:16% line:83% align:start
I just need a third card
to turn this around.

00:14:50.324 --> 00:14:52.393 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SARASA]
Not gonna happen, dummy.

00:14:53.595 --> 00:14:55.830 position:19% line:83% align:start
The only thing you need
right now is a trip

00:14:55.963 --> 00:14:57.665 position:19% line:89% align:start
to the Emergency Room.

00:14:59.066 --> 00:15:00.300 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:15:00.434 --> 00:15:02.570 position:7% line:89% align:start
You really think I'd stop now?

00:15:04.304 --> 00:15:06.006 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Not until I've found her.

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:09.778 position:24% line:83% align:start
She always came up
with ways of sneaking me out,

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:12.179 position:35% line:83% align:start
to show me
some bright new place.

00:15:12.312 --> 00:15:16.316 position:13% line:83% align:start
And until I see her again.
Defeat is not an option.

00:15:17.251 --> 00:15:19.987 position:16% line:83% align:start
Besides, this isn't just
about me, is it?

00:15:22.222 --> 00:15:24.191 position:21% line:83% align:start
If I lose, your cover
as the kidnapped Heiress

00:15:24.324 --> 00:15:25.827 position:24% line:89% align:start
is blown wide open.

00:15:25.959 --> 00:15:29.363 position:7% line:83% align:start
You and I are in this together,
Saionji. Accomplices.

00:15:29.496 --> 00:15:31.298 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:15:31.432 --> 00:15:35.335 position:16% line:83% align:start
No matter what it takes,
I'll protect your lie.

00:15:35.469 --> 00:15:37.639 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:15:40.974 --> 00:15:42.409 position:24% line:89% align:start
That was not true.

00:15:42.544 --> 00:15:43.645 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:15:43.778 --> 00:15:45.680 position:19% line:83% align:start
That stuff about Sarasa
getting kidnapped?

00:15:45.814 --> 00:15:49.983 position:21% line:83% align:start
-I made all of it up!
-Wait? What're you saying?

00:15:50.819 --> 00:15:53.287 position:24% line:83% align:start
"I just want to go
to a normal school."

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:55.824 position:10% line:89% align:start
That was Sarasa's only wish.

00:15:56.624 --> 00:15:58.893 position:19% line:83% align:start
So, I made it look like
she was kidnapped,

00:15:59.026 --> 00:16:00.662 position:10% line:89% align:start
and took her to the mainland.

00:16:00.795 --> 00:16:03.430 position:19% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] You fooled the
Saionji's? All on your own?

00:16:03.565 --> 00:16:06.366 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SARASA] That's right.
I am a genius, you know.

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:07.635 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Yeah but, shouldn't you have

00:16:07.769 --> 00:16:08.870 position:10% line:89% align:start
at least brought Himeji in--

00:16:09.002 --> 00:16:11.238 position:38% line:83% align:start
You think
I didn't consider that?

00:16:11.371 --> 00:16:13.708 position:24% line:83% align:start
Two years from now,
when Sarasa graduates,

00:16:13.842 --> 00:16:15.309 position:10% line:89% align:start
the secret's gonna come out.

00:16:15.442 --> 00:16:18.680 position:7% line:83% align:start
The least I could do was spare
Yuki from that mess.

00:16:18.813 --> 00:16:20.615 position:10% line:89% align:start
You don't have to defend me!

00:16:20.748 --> 00:16:22.917 position:21% line:83% align:start
You can just say this
entire thing was my fault,

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:25.118 position:35% line:83% align:start
and give up
before it's too late.

00:16:25.252 --> 00:16:27.622 position:33% line:83% align:start
It was my lie
that got you into this.

00:16:27.755 --> 00:16:29.591 position:21% line:89% align:start
You're just a victim.

00:16:29.724 --> 00:16:32.727 position:19% line:83% align:start
Ah, now it all finally
makes sense.

00:16:32.861 --> 00:16:34.261 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:16:34.394 --> 00:16:35.996 position:24% line:83% align:start
You wanted to make
your friend's dream come true,

00:16:36.129 --> 00:16:39.132 position:5% line:83% align:start
and you went against the Academy
and the Saionji's to do it.

00:16:39.266 --> 00:16:41.636 position:24% line:83% align:start
Which is, at once,
both absolutely insane,

00:16:41.769 --> 00:16:43.938 position:19% line:89% align:start
and extremely awesome.

00:16:44.071 --> 00:16:45.607 position:27% line:89% align:start
Totally my type.

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:47.976 position:38% line:89% align:start
[shocks]

00:16:48.108 --> 00:16:49.711 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SARASA]
What did you say?

00:16:49.844 --> 00:16:52.614 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:16:52.747 --> 00:16:55.683 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm saying, let's keep this act
up for a little while longer,

00:16:55.817 --> 00:16:57.084 position:44% line:89% align:start
okay?

00:16:58.018 --> 00:16:59.854 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Shinohara.
-[SHIRAYUKI] Master!

00:16:59.988 --> 00:17:01.956 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:17:02.089 --> 00:17:03.558 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
Are you hurt?

00:17:03.691 --> 00:17:06.794 position:27% line:83% align:start
Himeji, bring me
up to speed, quick.

00:17:06.928 --> 00:17:08.328 position:35% line:89% align:start
Of course.

00:17:08.462 --> 00:17:11.031 position:16% line:83% align:start
Thus far Mister Kugasaki
has collected sixteen cards.

00:17:11.164 --> 00:17:12.567 position:13% line:89% align:start
Only two remain unclaimed,

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:14.836 position:16% line:83% align:start
but their location is yet
to be revealed.

00:17:14.969 --> 00:17:17.972 position:13% line:83% align:start
In that case, it's all but
certain I'll end up with two.

00:17:18.105 --> 00:17:19.874 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Right.
-Hmm

00:17:20.008 --> 00:17:22.610 position:13% line:83% align:start
Then we need to find a way
to turn this game around.

00:17:22.744 --> 00:17:26.246 position:10% line:83% align:start
Wait, hold on, does that mean
you're not giving up?

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:27.715 position:19% line:89% align:start
Each and every attempt

00:17:27.849 --> 00:17:29.651 position:21% line:83% align:start
the Company has made
to help you has failed,

00:17:29.784 --> 00:17:32.854 position:7% line:83% align:start
do you really still think you
have a chance of winning this?

00:17:32.987 --> 00:17:34.488 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Both] Of course.

00:17:36.423 --> 00:17:37.992 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
Master Shinohara.

00:17:38.125 --> 00:17:40.595 position:16% line:83% align:start
Thank you for respecting
my wish.

00:17:40.728 --> 00:17:41.996 position:16% line:89% align:start
I greatly appreciate it.

00:17:42.129 --> 00:17:44.197 position:27% line:83% align:start
What do you mean
by "your wish," Yuki?

00:17:44.799 --> 00:17:47.835 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, it's nothing to worry about,
Rina.

00:17:47.969 --> 00:17:51.104 position:16% line:83% align:start
All right, I should start
brainstorming as well.

00:17:51.238 --> 00:17:52.974 position:16% line:83% align:start
My master and best friend
want to win,

00:17:53.106 --> 00:17:56.276 position:5% line:83% align:start
and what kind of maid would I be
if I didn't help them?

00:17:56.410 --> 00:18:00.515 position:27% line:83% align:start
Your best friend?
I mean, shucks, Yuki.

00:18:00.648 --> 00:18:03.116 position:19% line:83% align:start
-[HIROTO] Hey, Saionji.
-[SARASA] Huh?

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:04.586 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Is there an ability

00:18:04.719 --> 00:18:06.453 position:33% line:83% align:start
that lets you
change the rules of the game?

00:18:06.588 --> 00:18:09.657 position:7% line:83% align:start
[SARASA] Sure. The most famous
example is Rule Breaker,

00:18:09.791 --> 00:18:13.027 position:16% line:83% align:start
but it's only for people
ranked Six Stars or above.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.629 position:13% line:89% align:start
Availability's irrelevant,

00:18:14.762 --> 00:18:17.431 position:19% line:83% align:start
all that really matters
is that the ability exists.

00:18:17.565 --> 00:18:18.833 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:18:18.967 --> 00:18:21.603 position:19% line:83% align:start
Oh, my, you've come up
with something super devious,

00:18:21.736 --> 00:18:23.170 position:33% line:89% align:start
haven't you?

00:18:23.303 --> 00:18:25.238 position:16% line:83% align:start
Maybe, but to pull it off
I'm gonna need to update

00:18:25.372 --> 00:18:26.874 position:13% line:89% align:start
the effects of Display Bug.

00:18:27.008 --> 00:18:30.444 position:16% line:83% align:start
It might take all Company
resources to do that.

00:18:30.578 --> 00:18:34.582 position:24% line:83% align:start
But. I'll make sure
it's taken care of.

00:18:34.716 --> 00:18:37.317 position:35% line:83% align:start
In the end,
he's just a Five Star.

00:18:37.451 --> 00:18:40.655 position:21% line:83% align:start
If I can't trick him,
I've got no business being here.

00:18:41.388 --> 00:18:42.890 position:27% line:83% align:start
-[STUDENT 1] Wow!
-[STUDENT 2] Come on, boss!

00:18:43.024 --> 00:18:44.959 position:13% line:83% align:start
-[STUDENT 3] You got this!
-[STUDENT 4] Finish him off!

00:18:45.093 --> 00:18:47.795 position:38% line:89% align:start
[cheers]

00:18:47.929 --> 00:18:50.397 position:16% line:83% align:start
You were able to dethrone
my beloved goddess,

00:18:50.531 --> 00:18:53.635 position:7% line:83% align:start
so, naturally, I was expecting
great things from you.

00:18:53.768 --> 00:18:56.070 position:13% line:83% align:start
But no amount of greatness
can help a two-card hand

00:18:56.203 --> 00:18:58.372 position:19% line:89% align:start
win a three-point game.

00:18:58.506 --> 00:19:00.775 position:10% line:89% align:start
What shall it be, Shinohara?

00:19:00.908 --> 00:19:03.811 position:13% line:83% align:start
We can laboriously play out
this obvious defeat,

00:19:03.945 --> 00:19:06.080 position:16% line:89% align:start
or you can simply yield.

00:19:06.213 --> 00:19:08.215 position:38% line:23% align:start
[HIROTO]
Guess I have no choice.

00:19:09.349 --> 00:19:11.184 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:19:14.354 --> 00:19:16.456 position:19% line:89% align:start
And so, victory's mine!

00:19:16.591 --> 00:19:18.626 position:7% line:83% align:start
[SUZURAN] Well! It would appear
there's nothing left

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.494 position:19% line:83% align:start
but for me to announce
the winner!

00:19:20.628 --> 00:19:22.130 position:16% line:89% align:start
There you have it, folks!

00:19:22.262 --> 00:19:25.600 position:13% line:83% align:start
The winner of the Self-Made
Twenty-Seven-Form Game is.

00:19:25.733 --> 00:19:27.135 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
Time's up.

00:19:27.267 --> 00:19:29.369 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Kugasa--
-Just a second, ref.

00:19:30.705 --> 00:19:32.507 position:38% line:89% align:start
[chatter]

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.341 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Hey, Kugasaki, do you know

00:19:34.474 --> 00:19:36.744 position:7% line:83% align:start
what condition needs to be met
to end the game?

00:19:36.878 --> 00:19:38.780 position:24% line:83% align:start
Are you mocking me
with that question?

00:19:38.913 --> 00:19:41.683 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's quite clearly to win
during the reveal phase.

00:19:41.816 --> 00:19:44.752 position:35% line:83% align:start
[chuckles]
That's the condition to win.

00:19:44.886 --> 00:19:46.087 position:19% line:89% align:start
What I'm talking about

00:19:46.253 --> 00:19:48.022 position:27% line:83% align:start
is the condition
that ends the game.

00:19:48.156 --> 00:19:50.424 position:10% line:83% align:start
Well, if it's merely to bring
the game to an end.

00:19:50.558 --> 00:19:52.860 position:24% line:83% align:start
Either both players
must run out of cards.

00:19:52.994 --> 00:19:54.529 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Please work.

00:19:54.662 --> 00:19:56.798 position:10% line:83% align:start
[KUGASAKI] Or one side claims
more rounds and then wins.

00:19:56.931 --> 00:20:00.500 position:16% line:83% align:start
Really now, stalling the
inevitable is so unbecoming.

00:20:00.635 --> 00:20:03.403 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[beeps]
-[KAGAYA] Deus ex Kagaya!

00:20:04.739 --> 00:20:07.842 position:7% line:83% align:start
Dude, you're seriously missing
my implication.

00:20:07.975 --> 00:20:10.078 position:33% line:89% align:start
[sighs] I am?

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:11.679 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:20:13.181 --> 00:20:14.882 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hey! What's going on?

00:20:15.016 --> 00:20:16.483 position:24% line:83% align:start
The rule condition
is supposed to be

00:20:16.617 --> 00:20:18.653 position:24% line:83% align:start
"if both sides run
out of their cards"!

00:20:18.786 --> 00:20:21.589 position:19% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Maybe it was,
but that's not what it says now.

00:20:21.723 --> 00:20:23.791 position:10% line:83% align:start
Either your memory's playing
tricks on you.

00:20:23.925 --> 00:20:26.094 position:10% line:83% align:start
Or somebody's tweaked things
a little.

00:20:26.226 --> 00:20:27.762 position:35% line:83% align:start
[KUGASAKI]
You duplicitous scumbag!

00:20:27.895 --> 00:20:31.331 position:16% line:83% align:start
You used the Rule Breaker
ability, didn't you?

00:20:32.567 --> 00:20:34.102 position:5% line:89% align:start
According to the current rules,

00:20:34.234 --> 00:20:36.704 position:16% line:83% align:start
since I ran out of cards,
the reveal phase is now over.

00:20:36.838 --> 00:20:39.406 position:7% line:5% align:start
The score's an even zero-zero.

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:42.009 position:24% line:83% align:start
Don't look so smug
you piece of trash!

00:20:42.143 --> 00:20:44.979 position:13% line:83% align:start
All right! Let's start this
over again, shall we?

00:20:45.113 --> 00:20:46.748 position:10% line:89% align:start
All right then, fresh start!

00:20:46.881 --> 00:20:49.382 position:7% line:83% align:start
But with Emergency Mobilization
giving me an army,

00:20:49.517 --> 00:20:51.819 position:5% line:89% align:start
the end result will be the same.

00:20:51.953 --> 00:20:54.822 position:38% line:83% align:start
Oh, man,
you've really done it now.

00:20:54.956 --> 00:20:59.761 position:10% line:83% align:start
-What are you talking about?
-Sorry, pal. I just won.

00:20:59.894 --> 00:21:01.461 position:38% line:89% align:start
You what?

00:21:03.698 --> 00:21:05.365 position:35% line:83% align:start
[KUGASAKI]
So, you still have a card left.

00:21:05.499 --> 00:21:07.367 position:33% line:83% align:start
Too bad that
since I cast away mine,

00:21:07.502 --> 00:21:09.469 position:19% line:83% align:start
it'll have zero bearing
on the score.

00:21:09.604 --> 00:21:12.472 position:7% line:83% align:start
You used Rule Breaker to change
the rules, remember?

00:21:12.607 --> 00:21:15.076 position:13% line:83% align:start
You really think I changed
the rules, huh?

00:21:15.209 --> 00:21:18.146 position:10% line:83% align:start
-You must have imagined that.
-What do you mean, imagined it?

00:21:18.278 --> 00:21:21.182 position:10% line:83% align:start
The only thing I changed was
the text that appears on screen

00:21:21.314 --> 00:21:23.084 position:30% line:83% align:start
when you check
the end condition.

00:21:23.217 --> 00:21:24.652 position:38% line:89% align:start
[groans]

00:21:24.786 --> 00:21:27.487 position:5% line:89% align:start
No way! Then, the reveal phase.

00:21:27.622 --> 00:21:31.526 position:16% line:83% align:start
Is actually not over yet.
So then, I choose.

00:21:33.961 --> 00:21:35.495 position:27% line:89% align:start
Right, your turn.

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:38.065 position:38% line:83% align:start
Oh, wait,
you don't have any cards left.

00:21:38.199 --> 00:21:39.934 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:21:40.067 --> 00:21:43.271 position:35% line:83% align:start
There, see?
Exactly like I told you.

00:21:43.403 --> 00:21:44.539 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sobs]

00:21:44.672 --> 00:21:48.009 position:10% line:83% align:start
With that, the game is mine.
Dorkula.

00:21:48.142 --> 00:21:51.712 position:38% line:89% align:start
[cheers]

00:21:54.782 --> 00:21:56.651 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[sighs]
-[clears throat]

00:21:57.384 --> 00:21:59.821 position:21% line:83% align:start
Outstanding victory,
Master Shinohara.

00:22:00.621 --> 00:22:02.790 position:13% line:89% align:start
You were incredible. Truly.

00:22:03.423 --> 00:22:05.860 position:38% line:89% align:start
[cheers]

00:22:12.733 --> 00:22:15.036 position:38% line:5% align:start
[SARASA]
Shinohara! Idiot.

00:22:15.169 --> 00:22:17.505 position:5% line:17% align:start
You're not supposed to sneak out
of your hospital room.

00:22:17.638 --> 00:22:20.508 position:16% line:23% align:start
-Aw, come to check on me?
-As if!

00:22:20.641 --> 00:22:22.677 position:16% line:23% align:start
That thick skull of yours
is gonna be fine.

00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:24.145 position:21% line:5% align:start
I was just passing by

00:22:24.278 --> 00:22:26.047 position:7% line:5% align:start
and remembered I had something
to say to you.

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:29.517 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Go on and say it.
-First of all, about your skill.

00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:31.919 position:19% line:83% align:start
You've been downplaying
your capabilities.

00:22:32.053 --> 00:22:33.888 position:24% line:83% align:start
I mean, just look
at your last game.

00:22:34.021 --> 00:22:36.724 position:13% line:83% align:start
I honestly don't even know
if I could have won that.

00:22:36.858 --> 00:22:38.326 position:35% line:83% align:start
-What else?
-[sighs]

00:22:38.458 --> 00:22:41.128 position:7% line:83% align:start
"First of all" implies there's
something else, right?

00:22:41.262 --> 00:22:42.763 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:22:42.897 --> 00:22:45.600 position:16% line:83% align:start
The other thing is, like,
after I told you the real Sarasa

00:22:45.733 --> 00:22:47.702 position:16% line:5% align:start
hadn't been kidnapped you
sorta changed.

00:22:47.835 --> 00:22:49.937 position:24% line:83% align:start
You suddenly became
all motivated.

00:22:50.071 --> 00:22:54.508 position:7% line:5% align:start
-Yeah, I guess I did, didn't I?
-So, um.

00:22:54.642 --> 00:22:56.711 position:19% line:83% align:start
What was the meaning of
all that, anyway?

00:22:56.844 --> 00:23:00.681 position:13% line:83% align:start
-All that "my type" stuff.
-Yeah, okay, got it.

00:23:00.815 --> 00:23:02.617 position:21% line:5% align:start
Himeji says I'm good
to head home.

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:04.986 position:35% line:83% align:start
Oh, my bad.
Did you say something?

00:23:05.119 --> 00:23:07.420 position:19% line:89% align:start
You know what? Nothing.

00:23:09.056 --> 00:23:10.191 position:33% line:5% align:start
[both gasps]

00:23:10.324 --> 00:23:13.094 position:16% line:17% align:start
-Hey, I'm still wounded.
-[SARASA] Yeah, right.

00:23:13.227 --> 00:23:15.963 position:16% line:23% align:start
A wounded person lounging
around on the roof?

00:23:16.097 --> 00:23:19.367 position:13% line:23% align:start
You have the devil's luck,
you know?

00:23:19.499 --> 00:23:21.769 position:24% line:83% align:start
Seriously, your lie
didn't get out,

00:23:21.903 --> 00:23:23.838 position:13% line:5% align:start
and you weren't kicked off
the island either.

00:23:23.971 --> 00:23:26.274 position:13% line:5% align:start
I'm glad it all worked out.

00:23:26.406 --> 00:23:29.577 position:16% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] [chuckles] Hey,
luck has nothing to do with it.

00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:32.079 position:21% line:83% align:start
I am the Seven Star,
don't forget.

00:23:33.147 --> 00:23:34.515 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:23:36.017 --> 00:23:39.419 position:7% line:53% align:start
Come on, a situation like that
was nothing for me.

00:23:43.423 --> 00:23:45.960 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, right. You big, fat liar.
