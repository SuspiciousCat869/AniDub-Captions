[HIROTO] 30 minutes
since I accepted the game.

00:00:13.347 --> 00:00:14.682 position:30% line:89% align:start
While not long,

00:00:14.816 --> 00:00:16.283 position:21% line:83% align:start
it's been time enough
to call someone over,

00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:17.652 position:13% line:83% align:start
and to secure my connection
with Kagaya

00:00:17.785 --> 00:00:19.052 position:16% line:89% align:start
against nasty surprises.

00:00:19.186 --> 00:00:21.623 position:27% line:83% align:start
-[phone ringing]
-Hm?

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.896 position:16% line:89% align:start
 <i>Yoo-hoo! Can you see me?</i>

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:29.831 position:27% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] The game
Akizuki challenged me to

00:00:29.964 --> 00:00:31.431 position:13% line:89% align:start
is Tabletop Treasure Hunt.

00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:33.066 position:44% line:83% align:start
[NOA]
 <i>It's your cute friend, Noa.</i>

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.168 position:13% line:89% align:start
 <i>Did you miss me?</i> [giggles]

00:00:35.302 --> 00:00:37.271 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
I can't win. I can't lose.

00:00:37.404 --> 00:00:39.941 position:19% line:83% align:start
And this time, a draw's
clearly not in the cards.

00:00:40.474 --> 00:00:42.142 position:7% line:89% align:start
I've been backed into a corner.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.212 position:10% line:83% align:start
What's worse is I don't even
understand the rules.

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:47.281 position:19% line:89% align:start
 <i>Oh? Ignoring me, huh?</i>

00:00:47.414 --> 00:00:48.550 position:16% line:89% align:start
 <i>Well, have it your way.</i>

00:00:48.683 --> 00:00:50.484 position:10% line:89% align:start
 <i>I'll ask a "Question" then.</i>

00:00:50.618 --> 00:00:53.353 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>Is your partner hiding somewhere</i>
 <i>on or below the third floor?</i>

00:00:53.487 --> 00:00:54.488 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
A question?

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.659 position:16% line:83% align:start
[scoffs] <i>Yeah, you know,</i>
 <i>Hiro, a question.</i>

00:00:57.792 --> 00:00:59.861 position:30% line:83% align:start
 <i>It's a command</i>
 <i>you can use once per turn.</i>

00:00:59.994 --> 00:01:02.997 position:10% line:83% align:start
 <i>You get to ask your opponent</i>
 <i>a simple yes-or-no question.</i>

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.098 position:30% line:83% align:start
Word of advice,
you better not lie.

00:01:05.232 --> 00:01:07.902 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's an instant forfeit,
so be honest.

00:01:08.036 --> 00:01:09.336 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
In that case,

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:11.238 position:27% line:83% align:start
since my partner
isn't on any of those floors,

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:12.707 position:27% line:89% align:start
the answer is no.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.975 position:44% line:89% align:start
Okay!

00:01:14.107 --> 00:01:15.777 position:24% line:83% align:start
Then, now we enter
the "Move" phase.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.211 position:19% line:83% align:start
This is another command
you can use once every turn.

00:01:18.345 --> 00:01:20.748 position:27% line:83% align:start
It lets you move
up to three spaces.

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:22.316 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Spaces?

00:01:22.617 --> 00:01:23.785 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:01:23.918 --> 00:01:26.119 position:10% line:83% align:start
So each room in the building
counts as a space.

00:01:26.253 --> 00:01:27.655 position:44% line:83% align:start
[NOA]
 <i>You can change floors</i>

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:29.222 position:21% line:83% align:start
 <i>by taking the stairs</i>
 <i>on either side, too.</i>

00:01:29.991 --> 00:01:32.827 position:7% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] So, Akizuki and I are
in the hall by Home Economics,

00:01:32.961 --> 00:01:34.896 position:13% line:83% align:start
and our respective partners
have been concealed

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:36.396 position:13% line:89% align:start
in rooms unbeknownst to us.

00:01:36.531 --> 00:01:38.600 position:13% line:83% align:start
What's more, each room has
an electronic lock,

00:01:38.733 --> 00:01:40.969 position:7% line:83% align:start
requiring some kind of command
to open.

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:43.170 position:10% line:89% align:start
Because, of course, they do.

00:01:43.303 --> 00:01:44.639 position:44% line:83% align:start
[NOA]
Since you're new to this,

00:01:44.772 --> 00:01:46.574 position:13% line:83% align:start
I think I'll go easy on you
just this once.

00:01:46.708 --> 00:01:48.810 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll move one space
over to the right,

00:01:48.943 --> 00:01:50.177 position:19% line:89% align:start
and end my turn there.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.779 position:33% line:89% align:start
Okay, I'm up.

00:01:51.913 --> 00:01:53.681 position:44% line:83% align:start
[NOA]
You seriously fell for that?

00:01:53.815 --> 00:01:55.248 position:30% line:83% align:start
-[Noa giggles]
-[HIROTO] Huh?

00:01:55.382 --> 00:01:57.417 position:7% line:83% align:start
Sorry. Girls and their secrets,
you know?

00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:59.921 position:27% line:83% align:start
My first ability
is actually "Double Action",

00:02:00.054 --> 00:02:02.557 position:19% line:83% align:start
which allows me to take
two whole turns in a row.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.191 position:10% line:83% align:start
-So here's another question.
-[phone pings]

00:02:04.324 --> 00:02:06.159 position:27% line:83% align:start
 <i>Is your partner</i>
 <i>instead hiding somewhere</i>

00:02:06.293 --> 00:02:07.795 position:10% line:89% align:start
 <i>on or above the fifth floor?</i>

00:02:08.295 --> 00:02:10.330 position:10% line:83% align:start
What kind of ass-pull ability
is that?

00:02:10.464 --> 00:02:12.533 position:44% line:83% align:start
Hey,
this is totally on the level.

00:02:12.667 --> 00:02:14.936 position:30% line:83% align:start
I just tweaked
a couple conditions is all.

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:16.738 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Uh. No.

00:02:16.871 --> 00:02:18.305 position:44% line:83% align:start
[NOA]
Hurray.

00:02:18.438 --> 00:02:19.841 position:24% line:83% align:start
Now I know she's up
on the fourth floor, don't I?

00:02:19.974 --> 00:02:21.709 position:41% line:83% align:start
I think
I'll shuffle one space right

00:02:21.843 --> 00:02:22.810 position:27% line:89% align:start
and call it good.

00:02:23.544 --> 00:02:25.479 position:5% line:83% align:start
I really want to see you squirm,
Hiroto,

00:02:25.613 --> 00:02:28.215 position:16% line:83% align:start
so I'm going to take this
nice and slow.

00:02:28.348 --> 00:02:29.483 position:38% line:89% align:start
[giggles]

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.485 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Hiroto sighs]

00:02:32.386 --> 00:02:33.688 position:30% line:89% align:start
[horn blaring]

00:02:33.821 --> 00:02:35.188 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh, that's right.

00:02:39.661 --> 00:02:40.762 position:44% line:89% align:start
Good.

00:02:41.896 --> 00:02:43.097 position:30% line:89% align:start
 <i>Hey, it's me.</i>

00:02:43.497 --> 00:02:44.599 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Hiroto chuckles]

00:02:44.732 --> 00:02:46.299 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
 <i>Looking fly, Saionji.</i>

00:02:46.433 --> 00:02:48.703 position:7% line:89% align:start
[laughs] Perfect disguise, huh?

00:02:49.103 --> 00:02:50.303 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Thanks for this.

00:02:50.437 --> 00:02:51.939 position:7% line:89% align:start
If you hadn't come to help out,

00:02:52.073 --> 00:02:54.509 position:10% line:83% align:start
this game would've been over
before I even accepted it.

00:02:54.642 --> 00:02:56.410 position:19% line:89% align:start
Hey, it's no big deal.

00:02:56.544 --> 00:02:59.113 position:13% line:83% align:start
After all, if you go down,
I go down with you.

00:02:59.246 --> 00:03:00.748 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Hope you're comfy.

00:03:00.882 --> 00:03:02.416 position:13% line:83% align:start
I think you're going to be
locked in there for a while.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.217 position:24% line:89% align:start
 <i>That's fine by me.</i>

00:03:04.351 --> 00:03:06.688 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>But I certainly wouldn't say no</i>
 <i>to a little more wiggle room,</i>

00:03:06.821 --> 00:03:08.422 position:10% line:89% align:start
 <i>or a nice warm cozy blanket.</i>

00:03:08.556 --> 00:03:10.490 position:30% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Yeah,
these cold April nights, huh?

00:03:10.625 --> 00:03:12.426 position:10% line:89% align:start
Sorry, try to hang in there.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.629 position:33% line:83% align:start
I'll be fine,
just hurry up and win this.

00:03:14.762 --> 00:03:16.531 position:13% line:83% align:start
Let's get Yuki out of here,
quick.

00:03:16.664 --> 00:03:18.800 position:41% line:83% align:start
Right,
then let's recap the rules.

00:03:18.933 --> 00:03:20.267 position:16% line:83% align:start
To win, you have to find
the "treasure"

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.170 position:24% line:83% align:start
that's been hidden
by your opponent.

00:03:22.904 --> 00:03:24.304 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SARASA]
 <i>The "treasure" is your partner.</i>

00:03:24.438 --> 00:03:26.406 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>So naturally for you, that's me,</i>

00:03:26.541 --> 00:03:28.543 position:16% line:83% align:start
 <i>and for the Devil Girl,</i>
 <i>it's Yuki.</i>

00:03:28.676 --> 00:03:29.944 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
The field of play for this game

00:03:30.078 --> 00:03:31.311 position:10% line:89% align:start
is Eimei's largest building.

00:03:31.445 --> 00:03:32.345 position:35% line:89% align:start
Building A.

00:03:33.181 --> 00:03:35.049 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SARASA] <i>Spaces correspond</i>
 <i>to rooms on each floor,</i>

00:03:35.183 --> 00:03:37.985 position:30% line:83% align:start
 <i>as represented</i>
 <i>by this six-by-eight grid map.</i>

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:40.655 position:16% line:83% align:start
 <i>There are four commands</i>
 <i>you can use during your turn.</i>

00:03:40.788 --> 00:03:43.290 position:13% line:83% align:start
 <i>The first two are the ones</i>
 <i>the Devil Girl showed off.</i>

00:03:43.423 --> 00:03:45.193 position:19% line:89% align:start
 <i>"Question" and "Move".</i>

00:03:45.325 --> 00:03:46.861 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
The third is "Answer",

00:03:46.994 --> 00:03:49.063 position:13% line:83% align:start
which you use when you know
where the opponent's partner is.

00:03:49.197 --> 00:03:51.833 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SARASA] <i>If you're right,</i>
 <i>the game ends then and there.</i>

00:03:51.966 --> 00:03:53.701 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
But, in order to use "Answer",

00:03:53.835 --> 00:03:56.269 position:10% line:83% align:start
the player has to be standing
in front of the classroom.

00:03:56.403 --> 00:03:58.673 position:27% line:83% align:start
Also, each player
has three Answer Points.

00:03:58.806 --> 00:04:00.541 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SARASA]
 <i>Which, of course,</i>

00:04:00.675 --> 00:04:02.342 position:13% line:83% align:start
 <i>means you can only afford</i>
 <i>to get it wrong twice.</i>

00:04:02.476 --> 00:04:04.377 position:35% line:83% align:start
 <i>"Retreat"</i>
 <i>is the tricky one of the bunch.</i>

00:04:04.512 --> 00:04:07.915 position:7% line:83% align:start
 <i>It's the command that lets you</i>
 <i>move your partner around freely.</i>

00:04:08.381 --> 00:04:09.217 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Yeah.

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:10.551 position:16% line:89% align:start
It resets their position,

00:04:10.685 --> 00:04:12.252 position:16% line:83% align:start
allowing them to relocate
to a new space

00:04:12.385 --> 00:04:13.654 position:21% line:89% align:start
on the playing grid.

00:04:13.788 --> 00:04:15.857 position:27% line:83% align:start
But, it burns up
one Answer Point to use it.

00:04:16.423 --> 00:04:18.559 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SARASA] <i>So basically,</i>
 <i>those three Answer Points</i>

00:04:18.693 --> 00:04:21.562 position:16% line:83% align:start
 <i>are the currency of both</i>
 <i>your offense and defense.</i>

00:04:21.696 --> 00:04:22.997 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Speaking of defense,

00:04:23.131 --> 00:04:24.732 position:16% line:83% align:start
you can move your partner
even if they're located,

00:04:24.866 --> 00:04:27.969 position:21% line:83% align:start
but if you do, that's
another Answer Point gone.

00:04:28.102 --> 00:04:29.469 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SARASA]
It's no wonder

00:04:29.604 --> 00:04:31.371 position:13% line:83% align:start
the Little Devil activated
Double Action on us.

00:04:31.506 --> 00:04:32.874 position:10% line:89% align:start
Getting to go twice as fast?

00:04:33.007 --> 00:04:34.776 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's a big edge
in a game like this.

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:37.578 position:24% line:83% align:start
She can pressure me
into using my answers up.

00:04:37.712 --> 00:04:39.781 position:19% line:83% align:start
Make me waste them all
trying to protect myself.

00:04:39.914 --> 00:04:41.649 position:10% line:83% align:start
That "Double Action" ability
of hers

00:04:41.783 --> 00:04:44.317 position:16% line:83% align:start
-is way too overpowered!
-[SARASA] <i>Yeah.</i>

00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:46.053 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>I bet it's some illegal exploit</i>
 <i>she got</i>

00:04:46.187 --> 00:04:47.454 position:5% line:89% align:start

00:09:10.851 --> 00:09:12.553 position:30% line:83% align:start
I've been given
a frustratingly convoluted route

00:09:12.686 --> 00:09:13.888 position:27% line:89% align:start
to throw you off.

00:09:14.021 --> 00:09:15.990 position:38% line:83% align:start
Traipsing
up and down all these stairs,

00:09:16.123 --> 00:09:17.258 position:27% line:89% align:start
it's tiring work.

00:09:17.658 --> 00:09:19.860 position:10% line:83% align:start
Just try not to push yourself
too hard.

00:09:21.262 --> 00:09:22.730 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ah...

00:09:22.863 --> 00:09:25.499 position:7% line:83% align:start

real cold tonight after 10 p.m.

00:09:25.633 --> 00:09:26.767 position:35% line:83% align:start
Might want
to keep the room warm,

00:09:26.901 --> 00:09:28.503 position:13% line:89% align:start
so you don't catch a cold.

00:09:28.636 --> 00:09:30.271 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's very considerate, Master.

00:09:30.404 --> 00:09:31.605 position:35% line:89% align:start
Thank you.

00:09:32.106 --> 00:09:33.140 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:09:33.808 --> 00:09:35.976 position:13% line:89% align:start
Excuse me, I must be going.

00:09:40.114 --> 00:09:41.582 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Already past 8:00, huh?

00:09:41.916 --> 00:09:43.284 position:10% line:89% align:start
Himeji's not done moving yet,

00:09:43.417 --> 00:09:46.053 position:21% line:83% align:start
which means Akizuki's
still on her third turn,

00:09:46.187 --> 00:09:48.355 position:10% line:83% align:start
so I guess we're going to be
stuck on hold a while.

00:09:48.856 --> 00:09:50.591 position:21% line:83% align:start
The Devil Girl's lost
one Answer Point,

00:09:50.724 --> 00:09:52.059 position:10% line:89% align:start
but she's still got two left.

00:09:52.193 --> 00:09:54.028 position:7% line:89% align:start
We just lost our Device sensor,

00:09:54.161 --> 00:09:56.597 position:7% line:83% align:start
and we can't rely on questions
to narrow it down.

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:58.232 position:10% line:89% align:start
It'd take way too much time.

00:09:58.699 --> 00:09:59.534 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yeah, right.

00:09:59.667 --> 00:10:01.001 position:16% line:89% align:start
In a situation like this,

00:10:01.135 --> 00:10:02.870 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'd normally bank on outwitting
my opponent

00:10:03.003 --> 00:10:05.005 position:5% line:89% align:start
with misdirection and deduction.

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.208 position:5% line:89% align:start
Any reason we can't do that now?

The first was in my Trial

00:10:31.832 --> 00:10:33.767 position:30% line:83% align:start
and the second
actually happened just now,

00:10:39.039 --> 00:10:40.808 position:5% line:89% align:start
about those ploys in particular.

00:10:41.242 --> 00:10:43.878 position:21% line:83% align:start

-[SARASA] So what?

00:10:46.413 --> 00:10:47.882 position:38% line:83% align:start
You think
the Little Devil's restricted

00:10:48.015 --> 00:10:49.518 position:7% line:83% align:start
to only reading your thoughts,
Shinohara?

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:52.486 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm saying that if she is,
then it's something to use.

00:10:52.621 --> 00:10:54.488 position:24% line:83% align:start
I mean, it follows
that she'd place Himeji

00:10:54.623 --> 00:10:57.291 position:19% line:83% align:start
somewhere she believes
I wouldn't think to look,

00:10:57.424 --> 00:10:58.726 position:35% line:89% align:start
but then...

00:10:58.859 --> 00:11:00.961 position:33% line:83% align:start
She's failing
to account for what I think.

00:11:06.535 --> 00:11:07.868 position:19% line:89% align:start

Is Himeji

Yes.

How'd you know?

00:11:25.853 --> 00:11:26.954 position:7% line:89% align:start

00:11:27.087 --> 00:11:28.889 position:16% line:83% align:start
any outside interference
or tricks.

00:11:29.023 --> 00:11:31.425 position:10% line:83% align:start

She's got a point.

 <i>the second floor,</i>

Huh? Why the first floor?

00:11:45.339 --> 00:11:46.473 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's a bad move.

00:11:46.608 --> 00:11:47.808 position:7% line:89% align:start
If she was on the first floor,

00:11:47.942 --> 00:11:49.410 position:24% line:83% align:start
you could find her
with one question.

00:11:49.544 --> 00:11:51.879 position:10% line:83% align:start
The Little Devil's not going
to take a risk like that,

00:11:52.012 --> 00:11:54.281 position:24% line:83% align:start
so we can eliminate
the fourth floor too.

00:11:54.415 --> 00:11:56.317 position:24% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Ah, I see,

[SARASA] <i>You've seen</i>

 <i>when it comes to details.</i>

00:11:59.621 --> 00:12:00.788 position:19% line:89% align:start
No doubt she considered

00:12:00.921 --> 00:12:02.189 position:16% line:83% align:start
that if she moved Himeji
to this floor,

00:12:02.323 --> 00:12:04.491 position:27% line:83% align:start
I would hear it,
and pass the info on to you.

00:12:04.626 --> 00:12:06.293 position:33% line:89% align:start
In that case,

00:12:06.427 --> 00:12:08.663 position:7% line:83% align:start
we can discount the third floor
and the left side of the fifth.

00:12:08.796 --> 00:12:10.197 position:33% line:89% align:start
Huh. Correct.

00:12:10.331 --> 00:12:12.833 position:24% line:83% align:start
The right-hand side
of the third floor is above you,

00:12:12.967 --> 00:12:14.435 position:7% line:89% align:start
while the left side's below me,

00:12:14.569 --> 00:12:16.337 position:13% line:83% align:start
and I've got the left side
of the fifth floor

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:17.505 position:30% line:89% align:start
just overhead.

00:12:17.938 --> 00:12:19.206 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
All right.

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:20.474 position:16% line:83% align:start
So with the spaces still
on the fifth floor,

00:12:20.609 --> 00:12:21.475 position:21% line:89% align:start
and all of the sixth.

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:22.910 position:33% line:89% align:start
Twelve left.

00:12:23.043 --> 00:12:24.745 position:13% line:83% align:start
Nope. We can narrow it down
even further.

00:12:24.878 --> 00:12:25.879 position:16% line:89% align:start
In a game like this one,

00:12:26.013 --> 00:12:27.214 position:7% line:89% align:start
it's good strategy to make sure

00:12:27.348 --> 00:12:28.949 position:30% line:83% align:start
your opponent's
always one space shy

00:12:29.083 --> 00:12:30.384 position:24% line:89% align:start
of their objective.

00:12:30.518 --> 00:12:32.820 position:10% line:83% align:start
Meaning, she's likely hidden
in a classroom

00:12:32.953 --> 00:12:35.222 position:10% line:83% align:start
that's three plus one spaces
away from you.

00:12:35.356 --> 00:12:37.525 position:30% line:83% align:start
The music room
on the fifth floor is too close,

00:12:37.659 --> 00:12:38.627 position:30% line:89% align:start
so that's out.

00:12:38.759 --> 00:12:40.327 position:7% line:89% align:start

[SARASA]
Huh?

00:14:17.057 --> 00:14:18.926 position:7% line:89% align:start
Looks like it's currently 8:52,

00:14:19.059 --> 00:14:20.227 position:41% line:83% align:start
though
wouldn't it have been quicker

00:14:20.361 --> 00:14:21.862 position:33% line:83% align:start
to check that
on your own Device?

00:14:21.995 --> 00:14:23.897 position:44% line:83% align:start
Yeah,
but I wanted you to see it, too.

00:14:24.031 --> 00:14:25.132 position:19% line:89% align:start
Time will be a factor.

00:14:25.265 --> 00:14:26.634 position:19% line:89% align:start
For the next few turns,

00:14:26.768 --> 00:14:28.335 position:13% line:83% align:start
I intend to stretch things
out as much as I can

00:14:28.469 --> 00:14:30.805 position:19% line:83% align:start
until Akizuki and I use
our second Answer Points

00:14:30.938 --> 00:14:32.072 position:21% line:89% align:start
and the data resets.

00:14:32.206 --> 00:14:33.874 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SARASA]
And that'll achieve what?

00:14:34.007 --> 00:14:36.076 position:38% line:83% align:start
Actually,
if I can pull that off,

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:37.378 position:13% line:89% align:start
we should instantly be able

00:14:37.512 --> 00:14:39.346 position:35% line:83% align:start
to find out
where Himeji's hiding.

[phone pings]

00:14:41.014 --> 00:14:42.182 position:38% line:83% align:start

So I carried on,

00:14:42.316 --> 00:14:43.884 position:21% line:89% align:start
dragging things out,

00:14:44.017 --> 00:14:45.620 position:41% line:83% align:start
waiting
until the very last second

00:14:45.754 --> 00:14:46.954 position:27% line:89% align:start
to end my turns.

00:14:47.087 --> 00:14:48.389 position:21% line:89% align:start
When Akizuki was up,

00:14:48.523 --> 00:14:50.958 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'd make small talk
to prolong hers, as well.

[HIROTO]
We called "check" on each other,

00:15:00.934 --> 00:15:02.236 position:19% line:89% align:start
and by the fifth turn,

00:15:02.369 --> 00:15:03.971 position:24% line:83% align:start
both of us had used
our second "Retreat".

00:15:04.304 --> 00:15:07.141 position:27% line:83% align:start
Now, we each had
one Answer Point left.

I never thought
that you'd be such a match

00:15:11.646 --> 00:15:12.847 position:21% line:89% align:start
for me on my A-Game.

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:14.348 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm all giddy,

00:15:14.481 --> 00:15:16.183 position:19% line:83% align:start

for each other after all.

00:15:16.316 --> 00:15:18.051 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's been a while
since I received a compliment

that isn't a "Question",

because I already know
the answer is yes.

And since I'm close,

this turn.

Oh, I definitely did.

00:16:34.361 --> 00:16:35.930 position:13% line:83% align:start

00:18:34.983 --> 00:18:36.183 position:41% line:89% align:start
Bingo.

00:18:36.316 --> 00:18:37.150 position:30% line:83% align:start
You and I have
actually crossed paths

00:18:37.284 --> 00:18:38.485 position:27% line:89% align:start
a bunch of times.

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:40.187 position:41% line:83% align:start
Though,
if you don't mind me saying,

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:41.488 position:19% line:89% align:start
I never really took you

00:18:41.623 --> 00:18:42.824 position:27% line:83% align:start
for the reckless,
foaming-at-the-mouth

00:18:42.957 --> 00:18:43.825 position:33% line:89% align:start
revenge type.

00:18:43.958 --> 00:18:44.859 position:44% line:83% align:start
[NOA]
Why you...

00:18:44.993 --> 00:18:46.094 position:33% line:89% align:start
[grunts] Huh?

00:18:46.828 --> 00:18:49.496 position:30% line:83% align:start
So, is my face
ringing any bells now?

00:18:49.631 --> 00:18:52.033 position:44% line:83% align:start
[NOA]
The Empress, Sarasa Saionji?

00:18:52.165 --> 00:18:54.035 position:21% line:89% align:start
But why are you here?

00:18:54.167 --> 00:18:55.737 position:33% line:83% align:start
Let's call it
academic curiosity.

00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:59.239 position:7% line:83% align:start
This sounded fun, so I figured
I should have a look-see.

00:18:59.373 --> 00:19:00.975 position:10% line:89% align:start
But I needn't have bothered.

00:19:01.109 --> 00:19:02.242 position:5% line:89% align:start
Turns out that you were too weak

00:19:02.376 --> 00:19:04.144 position:19% line:83% align:start
to beat that smug jerk
after all.

00:19:04.277 --> 00:19:05.546 position:21% line:89% align:start
What are you saying?

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.414 position:21% line:83% align:start
Do you have any idea
what just happened here?

00:19:07.548 --> 00:19:08.850 position:10% line:89% align:start
I made a deal with the Devil,

00:19:08.983 --> 00:19:10.652 position:21% line:83% align:start
stole the Green Star,
beat the Seven Star,

00:19:10.785 --> 00:19:12.553 position:21% line:83% align:start
subverted the system
of this institution,

00:19:12.687 --> 00:19:14.388 position:13% line:83% align:start
became the strongest person
on the island,

00:19:14.522 --> 00:19:15.623 position:21% line:89% align:start
and you call me weak?

00:19:15.757 --> 00:19:17.224 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SARASA]
Nobody's denying the fact

00:19:17.357 --> 00:19:19.060 position:33% line:83% align:start
that you won
the Tabletop Treasure Hunt.

00:19:19.192 --> 00:19:20.528 position:13% line:89% align:start
But I think you might want

00:19:20.662 --> 00:19:22.764 position:16% line:83% align:start
to double-check who it is
you actually defeated.

00:19:23.698 --> 00:19:26.299 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Yup, that's how it is, Akizuki.

00:19:27.267 --> 00:19:30.370 position:19% line:83% align:start
Unfortunately for you,
it wasn't me who lost the game.

00:19:30.505 --> 00:19:32.339 position:44% line:83% align:start
[NOA]
But that's not possible!

00:19:32.472 --> 00:19:33.574 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Oh, it is.

00:19:33.708 --> 00:19:35.543 position:16% line:83% align:start
I had a surprise ability
of my own.

00:19:35.677 --> 00:19:37.545 position:5% line:89% align:start
Goes by the name "Pinch Hitter".

00:19:37.679 --> 00:19:39.379 position:44% line:83% align:start
[NOA]
"Pinch Hitter"?

00:19:39.681 --> 00:19:41.381 position:33% line:83% align:start
You probably
haven't heard of it.

00:19:41.516 --> 00:19:44.118 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's a special ability
that rarely sees much use.

00:19:44.251 --> 00:19:45.520 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SARASA]
Pinch Hitter can be executed

00:19:45.653 --> 00:19:48.321 position:16% line:83% align:start
from outside the confines
of an active game.

00:19:48.856 --> 00:19:50.024 position:16% line:89% align:start
And if it gets approval,

00:19:50.158 --> 00:19:51.358 position:7% line:89% align:start
the user is permitted to sub in

00:19:51.491 --> 00:19:53.360 position:30% line:83% align:start
for the player
of their choosing.

00:19:53.493 --> 00:19:55.495 position:16% line:83% align:start
So, while you were making
your way down here,

00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:57.932 position:38% line:83% align:start
I used it
to take my Master's place.

00:19:58.066 --> 00:19:59.167 position:35% line:89% align:start
There, see?

00:19:59.299 --> 00:20:01.102 position:16% line:83% align:start
The player you just beat
wasn't me,

00:20:01.234 --> 00:20:02.202 position:30% line:89% align:start
it was Himeji.

00:20:02.335 --> 00:20:03.604 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'll say that again.

00:20:04.072 --> 00:20:05.673 position:21% line:89% align:start
You took out Himeji.

00:20:05.807 --> 00:20:08.176 position:21% line:83% align:start
Which wasn't exactly
a wise thing to do.

00:20:08.308 --> 00:20:09.342 position:44% line:83% align:start
[NOA]
Huh?

00:20:09.476 --> 00:20:11.079 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
[laughs] Catching on yet?

00:20:11.445 --> 00:20:13.581 position:19% line:83% align:start
Remember the abilities
you activated?

00:20:13.715 --> 00:20:15.850 position:35% line:83% align:start
Your Spying
and Destructive Impulse?

00:20:16.551 --> 00:20:18.119 position:10% line:89% align:start
Like a parasite jumping host,

00:20:18.251 --> 00:20:20.420 position:7% line:83% align:start
they were designed to transfer
over to the winner's Device

00:20:20.555 --> 00:20:22.322 position:33% line:83% align:start
in the event
that I ever lost a game.

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:24.391 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Naturally, with this result,

00:20:24.525 --> 00:20:26.861 position:27% line:83% align:start
they transferred
from Himeji's Device to yours.

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:30.497 position:10% line:83% align:start
And so any hold you still had
over her has been severed.

00:20:31.431 --> 00:20:32.232 position:33% line:89% align:start
[strap rips]

00:20:32.365 --> 00:20:33.500 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:20:34.936 --> 00:20:35.837 position:41% line:89% align:start
[thuds]

00:20:36.303 --> 00:20:38.238 position:35% line:83% align:start
In the end,
I didn't lose the game.

00:20:38.706 --> 00:20:41.075 position:16% line:83% align:start
And your cursed abilities
have infected you instead.

00:20:41.341 --> 00:20:43.845 position:7% line:83% align:start
There really couldn't have been
a more perfect outcome,

00:20:43.978 --> 00:20:44.879 position:33% line:89% align:start
could there?

00:20:46.681 --> 00:20:48.082 position:44% line:89% align:start
Well?

00:20:48.216 --> 00:20:49.851 position:5% line:83% align:start
Are you finally ready to tell us
how this whole mess came about,

00:20:49.984 --> 00:20:50.952 position:38% line:89% align:start
Akizuki?

00:20:51.351 --> 00:20:53.386 position:35% line:83% align:start
[NOA] This
was the most important thing

00:20:53.521 --> 00:20:54.922 position:24% line:89% align:start
in the world to me.

00:20:55.056 --> 00:20:56.356 position:38% line:89% align:start
Precious.

00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:58.025 position:7% line:83% align:start
I haven't breathed a word of it
to anyone.

00:20:58.159 --> 00:21:00.460 position:13% line:83% align:start
[NOA] But there's no sense
holding back now.

00:21:00.595 --> 00:21:03.330 position:19% line:83% align:start
After all, this may be
the last chance I get.

00:21:03.463 --> 00:21:04.732 position:33% line:89% align:start
Last chance?

00:21:04.866 --> 00:21:07.034 position:10% line:83% align:start
I actually am kind of smart,
you know.

00:21:07.168 --> 00:21:08.335 position:16% line:89% align:start
I got an incredible score

00:21:08.468 --> 00:21:10.571 position:16% line:83% align:start
on my first intellectual
development test.

00:21:10.705 --> 00:21:12.507 position:5% line:89% align:start
One of the best ever, they said.

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:14.441 position:21% line:83% align:start
I was even headhunted
for grade school

00:21:14.575 --> 00:21:16.043 position:24% line:89% align:start
here on the island.

00:21:16.177 --> 00:21:18.746 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'd say that qualifies
as more than "kind of smart".

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:21.682 position:13% line:83% align:start
Although, it's pretty much
only the most elite candidates

00:21:21.816 --> 00:21:23.851 position:27% line:83% align:start
that get accepted
into grade school here.

00:21:23.985 --> 00:21:26.921 position:5% line:83% align:start
You see, intelligence and talent
aren't enough.

00:21:27.054 --> 00:21:29.624 position:30% line:83% align:start
You need to be
from a good family lineage.

00:21:29.757 --> 00:21:31.592 position:21% line:83% align:start
There was zero chance
a normal girl like me

00:21:31.726 --> 00:21:34.461 position:21% line:83% align:start
was ever going to fit
into a pack that pedigreed.

00:21:34.595 --> 00:21:36.063 position:21% line:89% align:start
Even though I tried,

00:21:36.197 --> 00:21:38.533 position:19% line:83% align:start
I could never stave off
the feelings of inadequacy.

00:21:38.666 --> 00:21:40.902 position:16% line:83% align:start
I thought that if I could
just stop being normal,

00:21:41.035 --> 00:21:43.271 position:13% line:83% align:start
that if I could be someone
exceptional instead,

00:21:43.403 --> 00:21:44.404 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'd belong.

00:21:45.006 --> 00:21:47.041 position:21% line:83% align:start
So, I worked as hard
as I possibly could.

00:21:47.175 --> 00:21:49.677 position:10% line:83% align:start
I made it into the top class
in my first year.

00:21:49.811 --> 00:21:52.246 position:27% line:83% align:start
And in my second,
I became a Five Star.

00:21:52.379 --> 00:21:53.815 position:38% line:83% align:start
Suddenly,
they were saying it'd be me

00:21:53.948 --> 00:21:56.117 position:16% line:83% align:start
who'd win the All-Campus
Elimination Battle,

00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:57.685 position:19% line:89% align:start
and become Eimei's ace!

00:21:57.819 --> 00:21:58.753 position:47% line:89% align:start
Me!

00:21:58.886 --> 00:22:00.955 position:16% line:83% align:start
And I wanted it so badly
I could cry.

00:22:01.088 --> 00:22:03.758 position:13% line:83% align:start
At last, something to show
for all the effort I'd put in.

00:22:03.891 --> 00:22:06.326 position:27% line:83% align:start
Something to show
that I was special.

00:22:07.228 --> 00:22:10.198 position:7% line:83% align:start
But you took that away from me,
Hiroto.

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:11.331 position:35% line:89% align:start
All of it.

00:22:11.464 --> 00:22:13.333 position:7% line:89% align:start
You destroyed me in an instant.

00:22:13.835 --> 00:22:15.435 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
So then, is that why you went

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:17.238 position:30% line:83% align:start
and made a deal
with this "devil" guy?

00:22:17.939 --> 00:22:20.440 position:19% line:83% align:start
[NOA] The Devil's name
is Mikado Kurahashi.

00:22:20.575 --> 00:22:23.410 position:7% line:83% align:start
Headmaster of District Twelve's
Seiji Academy.

00:22:23.544 --> 00:22:24.912 position:21% line:89% align:start
He told me to cheat.

00:22:25.046 --> 00:22:27.548 position:19% line:83% align:start
To do whatever I could
to steal Stars from you.

00:22:27.682 --> 00:22:28.950 position:13% line:89% align:start
He said if I pulled it off,

00:22:29.083 --> 00:22:31.384 position:13% line:83% align:start
he'd make all of my dreams
come true!

00:22:31.519 --> 00:22:33.120 position:21% line:89% align:start
I was so, so scared.

00:22:33.254 --> 00:22:35.556 position:21% line:83% align:start
[sniffles] Everything
was falling apart on me

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:37.725 position:7% line:83% align:start
right when it should have been
coming together.

00:22:37.859 --> 00:22:40.228 position:21% line:83% align:start
Didn't you ever think
of standing up to him?

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:41.796 position:24% line:89% align:start
This Kurahashi guy.

00:22:41.929 --> 00:22:43.297 position:44% line:83% align:start
[NOA]
How could I do that?

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:45.833 position:27% line:83% align:start
I can't stand up
to a monster like him!

00:22:46.167 --> 00:22:47.500 position:21% line:89% align:start
I can't do anything.

00:22:47.635 --> 00:22:49.804 position:27% line:83% align:start
You'd be best off
just forgetting about me.

00:22:49.937 --> 00:22:51.339 position:10% line:89% align:start
This is probably the last day

00:22:51.471 --> 00:22:53.140 position:33% line:83% align:start
I'll ever get
to go to school here,

00:22:53.274 --> 00:22:55.042 position:5% line:89% align:start
the last time I'll ever see you.

00:22:56.143 --> 00:22:57.612 position:21% line:89% align:start
I know it's not much,

00:22:57.745 --> 00:23:00.114 position:24% line:83% align:start
but I'm truly sorry
for everything I've done to you,

00:23:00.248 --> 00:23:01.148 position:35% line:89% align:start
all of it.

00:23:01.481 --> 00:23:03.483 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
No way, not like this!

00:23:03.985 --> 00:23:06.587 position:27% line:83% align:start
And just who said
you could give up, Akizuki?

00:23:06.721 --> 00:23:08.256 position:33% line:89% align:start
But I can't.

00:23:08.388 --> 00:23:10.224 position:16% line:83% align:start
There's nothing I can do
to fix it!

00:23:10.358 --> 00:23:13.761 position:7% line:83% align:start
I mean who in their right mind
could have taken on that devil?

00:23:13.895 --> 00:23:16.130 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Heh. Yeah, that's your problem.

00:23:16.264 --> 00:23:17.464 position:21% line:89% align:start
Too busy looking down

00:23:17.598 --> 00:23:18.933 position:27% line:83% align:start
to see the answer
right in front of you.

00:23:19.333 --> 00:23:20.467 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª
