[HIROTO] Races that start
with a "Ready, set, go."

00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:14.682 position:33% line:89% align:start
Exam scores.

00:00:14.816 --> 00:00:16.116 position:27% line:89% align:start
Follower counts.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.385 position:5% line:89% align:start
Restaurants chasing their stars.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.656 position:21% line:83% align:start
Society is predicated
on hierarchies.

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:24.391 position:7% line:83% align:start
If every person on this planet
were to be given

00:00:24.526 --> 00:00:26.861 position:5% line:89% align:start
a single all-encompassing rank,

00:00:26.995 --> 00:00:28.830 position:10% line:89% align:start
I wonder where I would place.

00:00:29.664 --> 00:00:31.566 position:19% line:83% align:start
I probably wouldn't be
at the bottom,

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.201 position:10% line:83% align:start
but I definitely wouldn't be
at the top.

00:00:34.334 --> 00:00:35.803 position:16% line:89% align:start
Out of a hundred million,

00:00:35.937 --> 00:00:38.438 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm betting I'd stand
around ninety-millionth place.

[ICHINOSE]
Next up.

00:00:40.274 --> 00:00:42.142 position:27% line:83% align:start
Transfer student
turned Academy Representative.

00:00:42.276 --> 00:00:44.846 position:27% line:83% align:start
Hiroto Shinohara
will now address you.

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:46.581 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
But if I've learned anything?

00:00:46.714 --> 00:00:49.784 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's not to take rankings
at face value.

00:00:49.918 --> 00:00:51.151 position:19% line:89% align:start
What you see before you

00:00:51.285 --> 00:00:53.153 position:33% line:83% align:start
isn't always
what it appears to be.

00:00:53.287 --> 00:00:56.658 position:38% line:83% align:start
You see,
the world is full of lies.

00:00:56.791 --> 00:00:58.292 position:30% line:89% align:start
How's it going?

00:00:58.425 --> 00:01:02.062 position:13% line:83% align:start
My name's Hiroto Shinohara,
your new Seven Star.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.533 position:19% line:83% align:start
For the next two years,
one person and one person alone

00:01:05.667 --> 00:01:09.369 position:5% line:83% align:start
will reign over you as your lord
and master, and that's me.

00:01:09.504 --> 00:01:11.940 position:19% line:83% align:start
You could be an empress
or an extra.

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:13.173 position:30% line:89% align:start
Doesn't matter.

00:01:13.307 --> 00:01:15.043 position:38% line:83% align:start
You plebs
aren't getting my Stars.

00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:17.845 position:10% line:83% align:start
If you aren't cool with that,
then come at me any time.

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.347 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'll take your game requests
whenever you'd like.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.350 position:7% line:83% align:start
That is, as long you don't mind
being absolutely crushed

00:01:23.483 --> 00:01:26.320 position:19% line:83% align:start
and humiliated in front
of the entire student body.

00:01:26.453 --> 00:01:28.255 position:35% line:83% align:start
Try as you
pathetic losers might.

00:01:28.388 --> 00:01:30.123 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's all in vain.

00:01:30.257 --> 00:01:33.193 position:16% line:83% align:start
Because Academy Island's
top rank position...

00:01:33.695 --> 00:01:35.495 position:30% line:89% align:start
Belongs to me.

00:01:36.296 --> 00:01:39.667 position:24% line:83% align:start
Ah, but of course,
that was all a lie.

00:03:14.996 --> 00:03:17.832 position:10% line:83% align:start
How am I supposed to live up
to a speech like that?

[NARRATOR]
Hello, newcomers.

00:03:31.244 --> 00:03:33.748 position:13% line:89% align:start
Welcome to Academy Island!

00:03:33.881 --> 00:03:36.050 position:33% line:83% align:start
Student life
in this scholastic paradise

00:03:36.184 --> 00:03:39.453 position:7% line:83% align:start
is supported by the very latest
in technological advancement.

00:03:39.587 --> 00:03:41.455 position:24% line:83% align:start
Provided by Japan's
leading company,

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:42.957 position:16% line:89% align:start
the Saionji Corporation.

00:03:43.256 --> 00:03:45.425 position:10% line:83% align:start
Your rank in this institution
will be determined

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.361 position:7% line:83% align:start
by the number of Stars you have
to your name.

00:03:48.495 --> 00:03:50.765 position:13% line:83% align:start
"But how do I gain stars?"
I hear you ask?

00:03:50.898 --> 00:03:52.767 position:24% line:83% align:start
Well, the quickest
and most convenient method

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.002 position:30% line:83% align:start
is to earn them
by competing in games

00:03:55.136 --> 00:03:56.571 position:13% line:89% align:start
with your fellow students.

00:03:56.704 --> 00:03:58.472 position:13% line:89% align:start
So, play games, win stars,

00:03:58.606 --> 00:04:00.808 position:16% line:83% align:start
and aim for the singular
Seven Star title,

00:04:00.942 --> 00:04:02.977 position:27% line:83% align:start
the highest rank
a student can achieve!

00:04:03.111 --> 00:04:06.147 position:13% line:83% align:start
Your new life as a student,
and your path to a better,

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:08.415 position:7% line:89% align:start
brighter future, starts today!

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:10.952 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
I never even wanted

00:04:11.085 --> 00:04:13.087 position:19% line:83% align:start
to become a Seven Star
in the first place!

00:04:13.221 --> 00:04:14.488 position:38% line:89% align:start
So why...

00:04:14.622 --> 00:04:16.891 position:16% line:89% align:start
Is this happening to me?

00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:20.228 position:44% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.429 position:21% line:89% align:start
If that's me, then...

00:04:22.797 --> 00:04:23.965 position:38% line:89% align:start
I'm lost.

00:04:32.874 --> 00:04:33.975 position:44% line:89% align:start
Um...

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:37.678 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SARASA]
Yes?

00:04:37.812 --> 00:04:39.147 position:35% line:89% align:start
What is it?

00:04:39.947 --> 00:04:42.850 position:27% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Oh, wow.
This girl is like super cute!

00:04:42.984 --> 00:04:45.853 position:19% line:83% align:start
No, wait, scratch that.
She's more pretty than cute.

00:04:45.987 --> 00:04:48.723 position:27% line:83% align:start
Those ruby eyes!
She looks familiar, though.

00:04:48.856 --> 00:04:50.658 position:16% line:83% align:start
Have I seen her somewhere
before?

00:04:50.792 --> 00:04:51.692 position:38% line:89% align:start
An idol?

00:04:51.826 --> 00:04:52.660 position:38% line:89% align:start
A model?

00:04:52.794 --> 00:04:54.061 position:41% line:89% align:start
So, um.

00:04:54.195 --> 00:04:55.563 position:5% line:89% align:start
Did you have a question or not?

00:04:55.696 --> 00:04:57.732 position:16% line:83% align:start
I don't really have a lot
of time to hang around.

00:04:58.199 --> 00:04:59.667 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, my bad.

00:04:59.801 --> 00:05:02.570 position:19% line:83% align:start
That is to say, sorry.
I do have a question.

00:05:02.937 --> 00:05:06.174 position:10% line:83% align:start
You see. I only just arrived
on the Island yesterday,

00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:08.375 position:27% line:83% align:start
and well, I think
I might be lost.

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.478 position:19% line:83% align:start
Do you know how to get
to Eimei Academy from here?

00:05:11.612 --> 00:05:14.182 position:33% line:83% align:start
Eimei Academy
is in District Four, right?

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:15.783 position:19% line:89% align:start
This is District Three.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.788 position:13% line:83% align:start
Eimei Academy, right here.
Not too good with maps, huh?

00:05:20.922 --> 00:05:23.558 position:35% line:83% align:start
-I'm sorry.
-No need to apologize.

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:26.861 position:24% line:83% align:start
And you don't need
to be so formal, either.

00:05:26.994 --> 00:05:28.563 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're a second-year,
aren't you?

00:05:28.996 --> 00:05:31.165 position:10% line:83% align:start
That means we're the same age
as each other.

00:05:31.566 --> 00:05:34.769 position:5% line:83% align:start
I guess you're right about that.
Wait, what?

00:05:34.902 --> 00:05:36.436 position:5% line:89% align:start
How'd you know what year I'm in?

00:05:37.004 --> 00:05:38.873 position:24% line:83% align:start
Using your Device,
you can easily access

00:05:39.006 --> 00:05:40.842 position:27% line:83% align:start
basic information
about the people around you,

00:05:40.975 --> 00:05:42.710 position:27% line:83% align:start
like their name,
and academic details.

00:05:42.844 --> 00:05:44.312 position:10% line:89% align:start
Of course, that only applies

00:05:44.444 --> 00:05:46.781 position:7% line:83% align:start
if the person is lower in rank
than you.

00:05:46.914 --> 00:05:49.650 position:19% line:83% align:start
Honestly, I'm surprised
you didn't already know that!

00:05:49.784 --> 00:05:51.085 position:7% line:89% align:start
Aren't device overviews a part

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:53.554 position:19% line:83% align:start
of the standard student
induction process?

00:05:53.688 --> 00:05:55.289 position:38% line:83% align:start
Ah, well,
I'm kind of in the habit

00:05:55.422 --> 00:05:57.158 position:19% line:89% align:start
of skipping tutorials.

00:05:57.291 --> 00:05:59.492 position:24% line:89% align:start
[giggle] Seriously?

00:05:59.627 --> 00:06:01.329 position:21% line:83% align:start
Are you in the habit
of asking strangers

00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:02.864 position:30% line:83% align:start
to catch you up
on things instead?

00:06:02.997 --> 00:06:06.100 position:21% line:83% align:start
All right, let me see
your Device for a second.

00:06:06.234 --> 00:06:08.903 position:7% line:83% align:start
The Device is an essential tool
for life on the Island.

00:06:09.036 --> 00:06:11.539 position:10% line:83% align:start
Not only is it the one place
you'll find a workable map,

00:06:11.672 --> 00:06:13.274 position:27% line:83% align:start
but its built-in
social media app "Stoc"

00:06:13.406 --> 00:06:15.810 position:13% line:83% align:start
is pretty vital if you want
to keep up-to-date with things.

00:06:15.943 --> 00:06:18.212 position:16% line:83% align:start
You can send and receive
messages through it, too.

00:06:18.346 --> 00:06:21.749 position:7% line:83% align:start
Also, this app is how you send
game requests.

00:06:21.883 --> 00:06:23.084 position:27% line:83% align:start
If you wanna take
someone's Stars,

00:06:23.217 --> 00:06:26.020 position:21% line:83% align:start
then just load it up
and play, 'kay?

00:06:28.055 --> 00:06:29.123 position:30% line:89% align:start
Uh, thank you.

00:06:29.257 --> 00:06:30.490 position:38% line:89% align:start
[giggle]

00:06:30.625 --> 00:06:31.959 position:24% line:83% align:start
[SARASA] That said,
technology is only

00:06:32.093 --> 00:06:33.060 position:21% line:89% align:start
as good as the user.

00:06:33.194 --> 00:06:34.595 position:19% line:83% align:start
The Device isn't gonna
be much help

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:36.931 position:19% line:83% align:start
if you can't make sense
of the map.

00:06:37.198 --> 00:06:38.666 position:16% line:89% align:start
District four is nearby.

00:06:38.799 --> 00:06:40.501 position:30% line:83% align:start
I can take you
as far as the entrance

00:06:40.635 --> 00:06:43.070 position:16% line:83% align:start
to the major plaza there,
so stay close.

00:06:43.204 --> 00:06:44.437 position:30% line:89% align:start
Oh, sure thing.

00:06:44.572 --> 00:06:48.009 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Man, she has a cute smile.

00:06:48.142 --> 00:06:50.011 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SARASA]
So if you only got in yesterday,

00:06:50.144 --> 00:06:51.612 position:30% line:83% align:start
does that mean
you're a transfer student?

00:06:51.746 --> 00:06:52.947 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Yeah.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.447 position:30% line:83% align:start
Would have been
a pretty lousy first day

00:06:54.582 --> 00:06:56.817 position:35% line:83% align:start
if I missed
the orientation ceremony.

00:06:57.518 --> 00:06:58.786 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh, that's right!

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.955 position:27% line:83% align:start
Our orientation's
this afternoon, too!

00:07:01.088 --> 00:07:03.624 position:35% line:83% align:start
I gotta go!
This is District Four.

00:07:03.758 --> 00:07:06.560 position:5% line:83% align:start
-Think you can manage from here?
-Ah, yeah. Thank you!

00:07:06.694 --> 00:07:07.862 position:30% line:89% align:start
Right! See ya!

00:07:17.705 --> 00:07:19.874 position:33% line:89% align:start
Are you okay?

00:07:24.845 --> 00:07:27.682 position:19% line:89% align:start
Tell me, and be honest,

00:07:27.815 --> 00:07:30.384 position:7% line:83% align:start
is this what you were planning
the whole time?

00:07:30.518 --> 00:07:32.820 position:19% line:83% align:start
Huh? What do you mean,
planning?

00:07:32.954 --> 00:07:35.256 position:24% line:83% align:start
This was obviously
just a coincidence.

00:07:35.389 --> 00:07:36.791 position:33% line:89% align:start
"Obviously"?

00:07:37.258 --> 00:07:38.592 position:21% line:89% align:start
I wonder about that.

00:07:38.726 --> 00:07:40.928 position:19% line:83% align:start
I mean, you don't look
very surprised to me,

00:07:41.062 --> 00:07:43.764 position:21% line:83% align:start
and this whole thing
has been off from the start.

00:07:43.898 --> 00:07:46.701 position:19% line:83% align:start

Wandering haplessly
around District Three,

00:07:48.703 --> 00:07:50.137 position:13% line:89% align:start
asking directions to Four?

00:07:50.271 --> 00:07:52.740 position:5% line:83% align:start
This plaza was the closest route
between the two.

00:07:52.873 --> 00:07:54.175 position:7% line:89% align:start
You weaponized your ignorance,

00:07:54.308 --> 00:07:56.844 position:10% line:83% align:start
knowing I'd have to lead you
this way myself.

00:07:57.244 --> 00:07:58.546 position:21% line:89% align:start
No, that's not what--

00:07:58.679 --> 00:08:00.748 position:13% line:83% align:start
Quiet! I don't want to hear
your excuses.

00:08:00.881 --> 00:08:03.417 position:19% line:89% align:start
I bet you wanted this.

00:08:03.551 --> 00:08:05.419 position:33% line:83% align:start
Embarrass me,
douse me like a fool

00:08:05.553 --> 00:08:07.221 position:24% line:83% align:start
then take advantage
in the aftermath!

00:08:07.355 --> 00:08:09.857 position:13% line:89% align:start
But it's not gonna happen!

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.033 position:33% line:83% align:start
That does it!
You want a game so bad?

00:08:19.166 --> 00:08:20.067 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'll give you one!

00:08:20.201 --> 00:08:21.702 position:27% line:83% align:start
You're a student
of Academy Island.

00:08:21.836 --> 00:08:23.838 position:5% line:89% align:start
So face me head-on, you coward!

If that's what it takes.

All I ask I is that
when the game's over,

00:08:27.808 --> 00:08:29.210 position:16% line:89% align:start
you hear me out, alright?

00:08:29.343 --> 00:08:33.147 position:21% line:83% align:start
Oh? Come up with some
clever excuse, did you?

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.749 position:35% line:89% align:start
Fine, then.

00:08:34.882 --> 00:08:36.050 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'll listen to what you have
to say, but that's all.

00:08:36.183 --> 00:08:37.952 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
[sigh] I guess it's a start.

00:08:38.085 --> 00:08:40.221 position:7% line:83% align:start
Hurry up and make the request,
already!

00:08:41.055 --> 00:08:42.623 position:21% line:83% align:start
Are you still playing
the newbie?

00:08:42.757 --> 00:08:44.325 position:16% line:83% align:start
You know as well as I do
that the game request

00:08:44.458 --> 00:08:46.927 position:35% line:83% align:start
has to come
from the lower-ranked player.

00:08:47.328 --> 00:08:50.131 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh. Sending request now.

00:08:51.532 --> 00:08:53.000 position:13% line:89% align:start
Alright. I've received it.

00:08:53.134 --> 00:08:56.037 position:30% line:83% align:start
So, the details
of the game are...

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:58.873 position:24% line:83% align:start
Jeez. The requester
has to set parameters

00:08:59.006 --> 00:09:00.941 position:10% line:83% align:start
for the game that the players
can follow.

00:09:01.075 --> 00:09:02.843 position:13% line:83% align:start
If the higher-ranked person
picked the game,

00:09:02.977 --> 00:09:05.012 position:7% line:83% align:start
they could just stack the odds
in their favor and win.

00:09:05.146 --> 00:09:08.015 position:30% line:83% align:start
So, to be fair,
the requester gets to decide.

00:09:08.517 --> 00:09:09.784 position:27% line:89% align:start
But not you, huh?

00:09:09.917 --> 00:09:12.353 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm just one big joke to you,
aren't I?

00:09:12.486 --> 00:09:14.155 position:30% line:89% align:start
I don't follow.

00:09:14.288 --> 00:09:16.657 position:16% line:83% align:start
The game request you sent
is totally blank!

00:09:16.791 --> 00:09:18.459 position:30% line:83% align:start
You haven't set
any conditions at all!

00:09:18.592 --> 00:09:19.994 position:33% line:89% align:start
Oh, I get it.

00:09:20.127 --> 00:09:21.862 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're so confident
you can beat me at anything

00:09:21.996 --> 00:09:23.764 position:21% line:83% align:start
that you're giving me
free rein to decide?

00:09:23.898 --> 00:09:25.499 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
No, that's not it at all!

00:09:25.633 --> 00:09:26.801 position:16% line:83% align:start
I was just pushing random
buttons!

00:09:26.934 --> 00:09:28.369 position:7% line:89% align:start
I didn't know what they meant!

[SARASA]
You know?

00:09:30.071 --> 00:09:31.506 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's been a long time
since anyone's made me feel

00:09:31.639 --> 00:09:33.140 position:13% line:89% align:start
an ice-cold fury like this.

00:09:33.274 --> 00:09:35.810 position:5% line:83% align:start
If that's what you want to think
about me, then fine.

00:09:35.943 --> 00:09:38.446 position:13% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] So? Are you gonna
choose a game, or what?

00:09:38.579 --> 00:09:40.648 position:16% line:89% align:start
You're mocking me! Okay.

00:09:40.781 --> 00:09:43.217 position:27% line:83% align:start
Stay right there
while I get this game set up!

A "turn-based staring contest"
on hard mode?

00:09:59.467 --> 00:10:01.869 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SARASA] Ready? Like the name
suggests, this game

00:10:02.002 --> 00:10:04.271 position:24% line:83% align:start
is a harder version
of a staring contest.

00:10:04.405 --> 00:10:07.074 position:10% line:83% align:start
In a normal staring contest,
you laugh, you lose.

00:10:07.208 --> 00:10:10.077 position:27% line:83% align:start
But in this one,
any reaction's a loss.

00:10:10.211 --> 00:10:11.011 position:30% line:89% align:start
Those sensors?

00:10:11.145 --> 00:10:12.847 position:27% line:83% align:start
They're watching
your every move.

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:16.117 position:16% line:83% align:start
Show the slightest twitch
of emotion, and it's game over.

00:10:16.717 --> 00:10:18.352 position:16% line:89% align:start
And the turn-based part?

00:10:18.486 --> 00:10:19.753 position:16% line:89% align:start
Just what it sounds like,

00:10:19.887 --> 00:10:21.689 position:16% line:83% align:start
you and I will trade off
taking turns throughout.

00:10:21.822 --> 00:10:23.257 position:16% line:89% align:start
Now, when it's your turn,

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:25.426 position:10% line:83% align:start
you're free to make whatever
expression you want,

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:26.760 position:21% line:89% align:start
free of any penalty.

00:10:26.894 --> 00:10:28.229 position:33% line:83% align:start
Pull a face,
make an impression,

00:10:28.362 --> 00:10:30.331 position:24% line:83% align:start
do whatever you can
to make me react.

00:10:30.464 --> 00:10:32.867 position:21% line:83% align:start
While it's your turn,
you're the attacker.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.302 position:21% line:83% align:start
You get sixty seconds
and then we switch.

00:10:35.436 --> 00:10:36.804 position:33% line:89% align:start
Makes sense.

00:10:36.937 --> 00:10:38.239 position:27% line:83% align:start
Why don't we get
this game started, then, huh?

00:10:38.372 --> 00:10:39.608 position:38% line:89% align:start
You sure?

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:41.308 position:16% line:83% align:start
You haven't even selected
an ability yet.

00:10:41.442 --> 00:10:42.776 position:38% line:89% align:start
Ability?

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:44.411 position:10% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] I really should read
the tutorials.

00:10:45.679 --> 00:10:46.981 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll just go ahead
and skip mine.

00:10:47.114 --> 00:10:48.617 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'll be fine without one.

00:10:48.749 --> 00:10:51.418 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SARSA] Fine without one?
Who is this guy?

00:10:53.454 --> 00:10:54.822 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yeah, abilities.

00:10:55.222 --> 00:10:57.725 position:19% line:83% align:start
Even having one of them
restricted in the application

00:10:57.858 --> 00:11:00.194 position:16% line:83% align:start
can be a massive handicap
to a seasoned combatant,

00:11:00.327 --> 00:11:02.597 position:10% line:83% align:start
and you're gonna stand there
and tell me you can win

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:04.633 position:13% line:83% align:start
without using any abilities
at all?

00:11:04.765 --> 00:11:06.100 position:33% line:89% align:start
What a joke!

00:11:06.233 --> 00:11:07.935 position:33% line:89% align:start
I screwed up.

00:11:09.504 --> 00:11:11.172 position:5% line:89% align:start
[chuckle] I get it. That's fine.

00:11:11.305 --> 00:11:13.207 position:33% line:83% align:start
Totally fine,
if that's the way you want it,

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:15.644 position:24% line:83% align:start
then that's the way
we're gonna do it.

00:11:15.776 --> 00:11:17.444 position:13% line:89% align:start
Let's just begin, shall we?

00:11:17.579 --> 00:11:20.147 position:13% line:83% align:start

with you going first.

00:11:26.253 --> 00:11:28.389 position:10% line:83% align:start
From there, turns will change
every sixty seconds

00:11:28.523 --> 00:11:29.624 position:27% line:89% align:start
without warning.

00:11:29.757 --> 00:11:31.258 position:27% line:89% align:start
For me at least,

Numeric Adjustment Level Seven.

Huh? Hey, come on,
that's cheating!

What are you talking about?

00:12:02.591 --> 00:12:05.660 position:10% line:83% align:start

It's an ability. D'uh.

00:12:05.793 --> 00:12:07.529 position:44% line:83% align:start
Well?
Aren't you gonna run away?

00:12:07.662 --> 00:12:09.096 position:38% line:89% align:start
Run away?

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:12.466 position:21% line:83% align:start
Of course. After all,
I did just create a weapon.

A razor-edged sword
arcing his way

00:12:17.606 --> 00:12:19.139 position:10% line:89% align:start

But fatigue's a blade
that cuts both ways.

I bet he thinks
if he keeps dodging,

The reaction he wanted from me
wasn't exhaustion, was it?

00:13:21.835 --> 00:13:24.004 position:21% line:89% align:start
It was embarrassment!

00:13:24.838 --> 00:13:27.642 position:27% line:89% align:start
Don't look at me!

00:13:28.576 --> 00:13:31.945 position:16% line:83% align:start
[WOMAN 1] Sarasa Saionji,
expression change confirmed.

00:13:34.048 --> 00:13:35.215 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Ichinose sighs]

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:39.186 position:19% line:83% align:start
Game-winning condition
achieved. Result.

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:42.089 position:10% line:83% align:start
Star Ownership is transferred
from Sarasa Saionji

00:13:42.222 --> 00:13:43.891 position:21% line:89% align:start
to Hiroto Shinohara.

00:13:44.024 --> 00:13:45.727 position:7% line:83% align:start
-Did Sarasa Saionji just lose?
-The Empress?

00:13:45.859 --> 00:13:47.328 position:41% line:89% align:start
No way!

00:13:47.461 --> 00:13:49.430 position:30% line:83% align:start
-[HIROTO] Hey.
-[SARASA] Leave me alone.

00:13:52.266 --> 00:13:54.835 position:35% line:83% align:start
[ASSISTANT]
Hiroto Shinohara, yes?

00:13:55.503 --> 00:13:57.004 position:30% line:89% align:start
Good day, sir.

00:13:58.072 --> 00:14:01.141 position:27% line:83% align:start
The headmistress
requests your presence.

00:14:02.677 --> 00:14:06.113 position:35% line:83% align:start
[ICHINOSE]
Oh, dear. Oh, dear, oh, dear.

00:14:06.246 --> 00:14:07.981 position:21% line:83% align:start
Only your first day,
transfer student,

00:14:08.115 --> 00:14:09.584 position:21% line:83% align:start
and look at the mess
you've wrought.

00:14:09.718 --> 00:14:12.186 position:7% line:83% align:start
Are you talking about that game
out in the plaza?

00:14:12.319 --> 00:14:13.987 position:35% line:83% align:start
[ICHINOSE]
Yes.

00:14:15.289 --> 00:14:16.758 position:13% line:89% align:start
At least you're observant.

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:18.959 position:38% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry
but what's the problem?

00:14:19.093 --> 00:14:20.961 position:19% line:83% align:start
Aren't games like that
an everyday thing here?

00:14:21.095 --> 00:14:23.464 position:38% line:83% align:start
They are.
Regular games, that is.

00:14:23.598 --> 00:14:27.034 position:13% line:83% align:start
But unfortunately for you,
this one was different.

00:14:27.868 --> 00:14:28.837 position:41% line:89% align:start
Indeed.

00:14:28.969 --> 00:14:30.104 position:16% line:89% align:start
You've unwittingly broken

00:14:30.237 --> 00:14:32.139 position:13% line:83% align:start
a rather precarious taboo,
champ.

00:14:32.272 --> 00:14:34.274 position:13% line:89% align:start
Let's review the situation.

00:14:34.408 --> 00:14:36.944 position:16% line:83% align:start
This morning, on your way
to the Orientation Ceremony,

00:14:37.077 --> 00:14:38.747 position:10% line:89% align:start
you got lost and met a girl.

00:14:38.879 --> 00:14:40.447 position:5% line:89% align:start
You were so taken by her beauty,

00:14:40.582 --> 00:14:43.117 position:7% line:83% align:start
that you devised a wicked plan
to isolate, sexually harass,

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:44.619 position:13% line:89% align:start
and coerce her into a game

00:14:44.753 --> 00:14:46.987 position:24% line:83% align:start
which you then won
by publicly humiliating her.

00:14:47.121 --> 00:14:50.558 position:7% line:83% align:start
I guess that's right, but I was
just asking for directions.

00:14:50.692 --> 00:14:52.459 position:30% line:83% align:start
The harassment
is the only real problem.

00:14:52.594 --> 00:14:54.696 position:16% line:83% align:start
The taking of the stars,
not so much.

00:14:54.829 --> 00:14:57.498 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's actually normal
for students of Eimei Academy.

00:14:57.632 --> 00:14:59.567 position:7% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Look, the whole thing
was a misunderstanding!

00:14:59.701 --> 00:15:02.469 position:30% line:83% align:start
[ICHINOSE] But,
a misunderstanding with her.

00:15:03.303 --> 00:15:04.506 position:33% line:83% align:start
A second-year
high school student

00:15:04.639 --> 00:15:06.407 position:24% line:83% align:start
from Ouka Academy
in District three,

00:15:06.541 --> 00:15:08.142 position:16% line:83% align:start
she achieved the highest
entrance exam score

00:15:08.275 --> 00:15:09.443 position:30% line:89% align:start
in our history,

00:15:09.577 --> 00:15:10.712 position:27% line:83% align:start
going on to claim
the top position

00:15:10.845 --> 00:15:12.680 position:5% line:89% align:start
as the Island's only Seven Star.

00:15:12.814 --> 00:15:15.550 position:33% line:83% align:start
Until today,
her loss column stood at zero.

00:15:15.683 --> 00:15:17.552 position:19% line:83% align:start
That captivating beauty
you stumbled across

00:15:17.685 --> 00:15:20.722 position:27% line:83% align:start
is known to many
as the "Empress" Sarasa Saionji.

00:15:21.623 --> 00:15:24.992 position:16% line:83% align:start
[HORITO] Saionji? I think
I've heard that name before.

00:15:25.125 --> 00:15:26.628 position:35% line:83% align:start
[ICHINOSE]
You probably have.

00:15:26.761 --> 00:15:29.430 position:19% line:83% align:start
The Saionji family are
the founders of Academy Island.

00:15:29.564 --> 00:15:31.198 position:16% line:83% align:start
The current Head Director
of the island

00:15:31.331 --> 00:15:32.634 position:21% line:89% align:start
is Masamune Saionji.

00:15:32.767 --> 00:15:35.804 position:10% line:83% align:start
Sarasa is Masamune Saionji's
granddaughter.

00:15:35.936 --> 00:15:37.605 position:19% line:89% align:start
She's a VIP among VIPs.

00:15:37.739 --> 00:15:40.608 position:30% line:83% align:start
You mean to say
I beat the Empress.

00:15:40.742 --> 00:15:43.611 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yes. An unimportant
little worm like you.

00:15:43.745 --> 00:15:46.681 position:7% line:83% align:start
A boy with the lowest transfer
exam score in our history,

00:15:46.815 --> 00:15:48.015 position:24% line:89% align:start
barely scraping in.

00:15:48.148 --> 00:15:50.785 position:30% line:83% align:start
Someone of such
refreshingly low status.

00:15:50.919 --> 00:15:52.453 position:27% line:89% align:start
A grunt. An NPC.

00:15:52.587 --> 00:15:54.789 position:27% line:83% align:start
Alright, alright,
I get it already.

00:15:54.923 --> 00:15:56.390 position:30% line:89% align:start
Do you really?

00:15:56.524 --> 00:15:59.326 position:16% line:83% align:start
A boy like you dominating
Masamune's granddaughter?

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:01.896 position:16% line:83% align:start
That man's a tremendously
staunch, prideful,

00:16:02.029 --> 00:16:03.230 position:16% line:89% align:start
and merciless individual.

00:16:03.363 --> 00:16:06.868 position:24% line:83% align:start
And he's very scary
when he's angry.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.903 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
So then, am I expelled?

00:16:09.036 --> 00:16:12.206 position:16% line:83% align:start
If that would fix things,
it would've already happened.

00:16:12.339 --> 00:16:14.041 position:27% line:83% align:start
The Head Director
would do anything

00:16:14.174 --> 00:16:16.410 position:35% line:83% align:start
to protect
the Saionji family reputation.

00:16:16.544 --> 00:16:17.812 position:38% line:89% align:start
Anything.

00:16:17.946 --> 00:16:19.179 position:44% line:89% align:start
But!

00:16:19.313 --> 00:16:20.582 position:21% line:83% align:start
There is still a way
to snatch you back

00:16:20.715 --> 00:16:21.883 position:19% line:89% align:start
from the jaws of doom.

00:16:22.684 --> 00:16:26.119 position:38% line:83% align:start
And that,
is to make you a Seven Star.

00:16:28.623 --> 00:16:31.358 position:7% line:83% align:start
What is the most troubling part
of this situation?

00:16:31.492 --> 00:16:34.194 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's the fact that the Empress,
Sarasa Saionji.

00:16:34.328 --> 00:16:36.196 position:10% line:89% align:start
Was defeated by a troglodyte.

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:38.733 position:24% line:83% align:start
If she was defeated
by a comparative equal,

00:16:38.867 --> 00:16:42.202 position:27% line:83% align:start
Masamune Saionji
likely wouldn't be so upset.

00:16:42.336 --> 00:16:44.806 position:5% line:83% align:start
So, we'll just make you the same
level as her.

00:16:44.939 --> 00:16:46.106 position:13% line:89% align:start
You'll become a Seven Star.

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.475 position:16% line:89% align:start
Woah, hold on! I'm a One.

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:50.410 position:13% line:83% align:start
I couldn't make it to Seven
if it killed me!

00:16:50.545 --> 00:16:52.680 position:19% line:83% align:start
Right? Someone like you
could never dream

00:16:52.814 --> 00:16:54.214 position:13% line:89% align:start
of such an accomplishment,

00:16:54.348 --> 00:16:56.049 position:30% line:83% align:start
what with being
the insignificant little nobody

00:16:56.183 --> 00:16:57.484 position:13% line:89% align:start
that you so painfully are!

00:16:57.619 --> 00:16:59.521 position:30% line:83% align:start
Come on, I said
I get the picture already.

00:16:59.654 --> 00:17:02.891 position:16% line:83% align:start
But luck is on your side.
Check out your Device.

00:17:03.525 --> 00:17:06.193 position:24% line:83% align:start
You just won a game
against the Empress, didn't you?

00:17:06.326 --> 00:17:08.630 position:10% line:83% align:start
Look at the color of the Star
you stole from her.

00:17:08.763 --> 00:17:10.765 position:13% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Wait. Aren't Stars
supposed to be white?

00:17:10.899 --> 00:17:13.300 position:35% line:83% align:start
[ICHINOSE]
Yes, but that's no normal Star.

00:17:13.433 --> 00:17:16.036 position:10% line:83% align:start
Only ten or 15 special Stars
like that one

00:17:16.169 --> 00:17:17.839 position:24% line:83% align:start
have been confirmed
on the island.

00:17:17.972 --> 00:17:21.208 position:10% line:83% align:start
The Red Star carries with it
a special effect, you see.

00:17:21.341 --> 00:17:23.978 position:5% line:83% align:start
When you think of the color red,
what comes to mind?

00:17:24.111 --> 00:17:25.580 position:33% line:89% align:start
Uh, ketchup?

00:17:25.713 --> 00:17:28.415 position:7% line:83% align:start
Thank you for the surprisingly
cute answer.

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:29.651 position:38% line:89% align:start
But, no.

00:17:29.784 --> 00:17:33.086 position:19% line:83% align:start
That devilish Red Star
confers to you.

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:36.056 position:24% line:83% align:start
The ability to lie!
One time about anything.

00:17:36.189 --> 00:17:37.592 position:35% line:89% align:start
That's all.

00:17:39.493 --> 00:17:42.462 position:24% line:83% align:start
Get it? Aren't lies
red by their very definition?

00:17:42.597 --> 00:17:44.431 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
A lie? No way.

00:17:44.566 --> 00:17:45.900 position:35% line:83% align:start
[ICHINOSE]
The only way.

00:17:46.034 --> 00:17:48.168 position:19% line:83% align:start
Use the lie to augment
your Star classification,

00:17:48.302 --> 00:17:50.203 position:16% line:89% align:start
and become a Seven Star.

00:17:50.337 --> 00:17:53.340 position:10% line:83% align:start
-But, is that even possible?
-It is.

00:17:53.473 --> 00:17:55.142 position:13% line:83% align:start
Before the Empress held it,
that Red Star

00:17:55.275 --> 00:17:56.811 position:19% line:83% align:start
was in the possession
of the Saionji family,

00:17:56.945 --> 00:17:59.479 position:19% line:83% align:start
remaining in their care
for quite some time.

00:17:59.614 --> 00:18:02.349 position:5% line:83% align:start
Not many people around today are
aware of its effect.

00:18:02.482 --> 00:18:03.885 position:5% line:89% align:start
Then, how do you know about it?

00:18:04.018 --> 00:18:07.755 position:24% line:83% align:start
Because I, myself,
am a previous Red Star holder.

00:18:08.823 --> 00:18:12.426 position:7% line:83% align:start
So what you're saying is I have
to become a fake Seven Star?

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:13.995 position:35% line:83% align:start
[ICHINOSE]
Yes. We'll sell it like,

00:18:14.127 --> 00:18:16.296 position:19% line:83% align:start
"Transfer student gets
record-breaking test scores,

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:17.999 position:10% line:89% align:start
surpassing even the Empress."

00:18:18.131 --> 00:18:19.968 position:35% line:83% align:start
Or perhaps
"A new genius appears,

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:23.270 position:19% line:83% align:start
making it to Seven Star
on his very first day!"

00:18:24.839 --> 00:18:26.608 position:35% line:83% align:start
Of course,
you don't have to do this.

00:18:26.741 --> 00:18:30.444 position:27% line:83% align:start
You can decline.
The choice is entirely yours.

00:18:30.578 --> 00:18:31.879 position:10% line:89% align:start
If red's just not your color,

00:18:32.013 --> 00:18:34.414 position:16% line:83% align:start
then pack up your things
and leave the island.

00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:37.150 position:19% line:83% align:start
We'll say you leveraged
an illegal ability

00:18:37.284 --> 00:18:39.453 position:21% line:83% align:start
against the Empress,
nullifying the match.

00:18:39.587 --> 00:18:42.222 position:16% line:83% align:start
But do you really want it
to end like that?

00:18:42.356 --> 00:18:44.191 position:16% line:83% align:start
Didn't you have a reason
for coming here?

00:18:44.324 --> 00:18:47.160 position:38% line:83% align:start
-A goal?
-[HIROTO] Yes.

00:18:47.294 --> 00:18:48.563 position:27% line:89% align:start
I do have a goal.

00:18:49.429 --> 00:18:51.365 position:5% line:89% align:start
There's someone I have to find.

00:18:52.232 --> 00:18:54.334 position:10% line:89% align:start
I can't accept a bad ending.

00:18:54.468 --> 00:18:55.903 position:7% line:89% align:start
If you give up now, it's over.

00:18:56.037 --> 00:18:58.573 position:16% line:83% align:start
In fact, you'll probably
never see her again.

00:18:58.706 --> 00:19:00.374 position:16% line:83% align:start
Sounds like you've really
thought this all through.

00:19:00.508 --> 00:19:01.876 position:35% line:83% align:start
[ICHINOSE]
No.

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:04.646 position:13% line:83% align:start
This is as much a surprise
to me as to anyone else.

00:19:04.779 --> 00:19:07.515 position:27% line:83% align:start
But I'm quite the
ambitious woman at my core.

00:19:07.649 --> 00:19:09.416 position:19% line:83% align:start
If an opportunity falls
into my lap,

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:11.753 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm hardly going to pass it up.

00:19:12.419 --> 00:19:14.287 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Play the part, huh?

00:19:16.189 --> 00:19:18.726 position:16% line:83% align:start
If that's what it takes.
I'll do it.

00:19:20.193 --> 00:19:22.096 position:38% line:89% align:start
[groans]

00:19:22.964 --> 00:19:25.833 position:10% line:83% align:start
[laugh] That was incredible!
The sheer audacity!

00:19:25.967 --> 00:19:27.835 position:35% line:83% align:start
I don't see
what's so funny about it.

00:19:27.969 --> 00:19:30.104 position:10% line:83% align:start
"As long you don't mind being
absolutely crushed

00:19:30.237 --> 00:19:32.740 position:19% line:83% align:start
and humiliated in front
of the entire student body."

00:19:32.874 --> 00:19:35.109 position:16% line:83% align:start
-You're making fun of me.
-No, not at all!

00:19:35.242 --> 00:19:37.344 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm cheering for you. [laughs]

00:19:37.477 --> 00:19:39.881 position:19% line:83% align:start
But in all seriousness,
that was a master-class

00:19:40.014 --> 00:19:41.348 position:10% line:89% align:start
in psychological subversion.

00:19:41.481 --> 00:19:42.684 position:27% line:89% align:start
You're a natural

00:19:42.817 --> 00:19:44.152 position:27% line:83% align:start
at disconnecting
your inner feelings

00:19:44.284 --> 00:19:45.920 position:19% line:89% align:start
and outward appearance.

00:19:46.054 --> 00:19:49.023 position:10% line:83% align:start
Scouting you for this academy
was clearly a stroke of genius.

00:19:49.157 --> 00:19:50.190 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:19:50.323 --> 00:19:51.592 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
So, um, question.

00:19:51.726 --> 00:19:53.260 position:13% line:83% align:start
Where am I supposed to live
from now on?

00:19:53.393 --> 00:19:54.629 position:30% line:83% align:start
[ICHINOSE] Oh,
I've arranged a dorm for you.

00:19:54.762 --> 00:19:56.396 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll send the coordinates
to your Device.

00:19:56.531 --> 00:19:57.397 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Appreciate it.

00:19:57.532 --> 00:19:58.900 position:33% line:89% align:start
See you soon.

00:19:59.033 --> 00:20:00.668 position:10% line:83% align:start
Looking forward to your next
great performance!

00:20:00.802 --> 00:20:02.670 position:24% line:83% align:start
"If you don't mind
being absolutely crushed

00:20:02.804 --> 00:20:03.705 position:27% line:89% align:start
and humiliated."

00:20:07.942 --> 00:20:10.210 position:24% line:89% align:start
A red lie. [sighs]

00:20:12.613 --> 00:20:15.583 position:30% line:83% align:start
Hey. You know,
that was a wonderful speech

00:20:15.717 --> 00:20:17.217 position:5% line:89% align:start
you gave at the ceremony today.

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:18.586 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
How did you?

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.621 position:41% line:83% align:start
[SARSA]
It's plastered all over Stoc.

00:20:20.755 --> 00:20:23.256 position:5% line:89% align:start
So, what is it you want exactly?

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:24.659 position:21% line:89% align:start
You found my weakness

00:20:24.792 --> 00:20:26.326 position:24% line:83% align:start
and thrust yourself
into the spotlight.

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:28.261 position:16% line:83% align:start
And yet you still haven't
exposed my secret?

00:20:28.395 --> 00:20:29.864 position:24% line:89% align:start
What're you doing?

00:20:29.997 --> 00:20:32.533 position:16% line:83% align:start
Gathering more attention
before you absolutely crush me?

00:20:32.667 --> 00:20:36.637 position:41% line:83% align:start
Please.
I'm begging you. Don't.

00:20:37.337 --> 00:20:40.875 position:7% line:83% align:start
I know I have no right to ask.
I know I'm being selfish,

00:20:41.008 --> 00:20:43.410 position:21% line:83% align:start
but I have my reasons
for doing this.

00:20:43.544 --> 00:20:47.014 position:5% line:83% align:start
Reasons for keeping up this lie.
Whatever the cost.

00:20:47.148 --> 00:20:49.684 position:13% line:89% align:start
So I'm begging you. Please.

00:20:49.817 --> 00:20:53.087 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll do anything you ask,
just don't tell anyone, okay?

00:20:53.221 --> 00:20:54.555 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Look, I'm sorry.

00:20:54.689 --> 00:20:56.991 position:24% line:83% align:start
But I have no idea
what you're talking about.

00:20:57.125 --> 00:20:58.391 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SARASA]
Quit playing dumb!

00:20:58.526 --> 00:21:01.095 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm not messing around here,
this is serious!

00:21:01.229 --> 00:21:02.262 position:27% line:89% align:start
I know you know.

00:21:02.864 --> 00:21:05.133 position:16% line:83% align:start
You wanna make me say it?
Fine.

00:21:05.265 --> 00:21:07.101 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm not Sarasa Saionji!

00:21:07.235 --> 00:21:08.803 position:38% line:89% align:start
Say what?

00:21:11.239 --> 00:21:12.507 position:24% line:89% align:start
Are you satisfied?

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:16.511 position:27% line:83% align:start
There. I said it.
I'm not Sarasa.

00:21:16.644 --> 00:21:18.646 position:19% line:83% align:start
I've been acting as her
double here for the past year,

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:21.215 position:27% line:83% align:start
but my real name
is Rina Akabane.

00:21:21.348 --> 00:21:22.650 position:7% line:89% align:start
A whole year of winning games,

00:21:22.784 --> 00:21:25.186 position:19% line:83% align:start
knowing that if I lost,
my secret was out.

00:21:25.318 --> 00:21:27.420 position:16% line:89% align:start
And today, I lost to you.

00:21:28.222 --> 00:21:30.958 position:10% line:83% align:start
You took the Red Star from me
when you won the game.

00:21:31.092 --> 00:21:33.694 position:7% line:83% align:start
Which means you know the truth
that I was hiding.

00:21:33.828 --> 00:21:36.564 position:13% line:83% align:start
Are you saying the Red Star
comes with some kind of penalty?

00:21:36.697 --> 00:21:38.933 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SARASA]
Are you still playing dumb?

00:21:39.066 --> 00:21:41.536 position:24% line:83% align:start
The Red Star holder
gets to tell a lie, right?

00:21:41.669 --> 00:21:43.070 position:5% line:89% align:start
But if they lose it to someone,

00:21:43.204 --> 00:21:45.106 position:10% line:83% align:start
that person gets to find out
what lie they told!

00:21:45.239 --> 00:21:46.439 position:24% line:89% align:start
You must know that!

00:21:47.241 --> 00:21:50.044 position:10% line:83% align:start
After all, you're the holder
of the Red Star now.

00:21:51.212 --> 00:21:53.815 position:27% line:83% align:start
Listen, Akabane--
I mean, Saionji.

00:21:53.948 --> 00:21:56.617 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm afraid you've got
this whole thing wrong.

00:21:57.417 --> 00:21:58.719 position:13% line:89% align:start
Until you told me just now,

00:21:58.853 --> 00:22:00.688 position:19% line:83% align:start
I honestly had no idea
about your lie.

00:22:00.822 --> 00:22:02.723 position:5% line:89% align:start
I really did get here yesterday,

00:22:02.857 --> 00:22:05.726 position:5% line:83% align:start
and I really am still that inept
at using my Device.

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:08.196 position:10% line:83% align:start
Also, this is the first time
I'm hearing of the Red Star

00:22:08.328 --> 00:22:09.764 position:19% line:89% align:start
having a disadvantage.

00:22:09.897 --> 00:22:12.567 position:13% line:83% align:start
No way! That can't be true!
You beat me so easily,

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:14.702 position:19% line:83% align:start
and became a Seven Star
on your very first day!

00:22:14.836 --> 00:22:17.437 position:7% line:83% align:start
I guess it does look like that
on the surface, huh?

00:22:17.572 --> 00:22:20.107 position:27% line:83% align:start
But the truth is
I'm not a Seven Star at all.

00:22:21.441 --> 00:22:23.811 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's actually the lie
I'm telling.

00:22:23.945 --> 00:22:26.446 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm using the Red Star's effect
to boost my status.

00:22:26.581 --> 00:22:29.750 position:24% line:83% align:start
My legitimate rank
is only One-lousy-Star.

00:22:29.884 --> 00:22:32.253 position:13% line:83% align:start
All I've got is the red one
I took from you.

00:22:32.385 --> 00:22:33.821 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm as low rank as they come.

00:22:33.955 --> 00:22:35.723 position:27% line:83% align:start
I have my reasons
the same as you,

00:22:35.857 --> 00:22:38.092 position:21% line:83% align:start
so I'm having to lie
about my ranking.

00:22:40.528 --> 00:22:41.963 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SARASA]
Stop. Hang on.

00:22:42.096 --> 00:22:43.664 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hold up a second.

00:22:44.632 --> 00:22:46.067 position:16% line:89% align:start
Lemme get this straight.

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:48.269 position:7% line:83% align:start
You're not the strongest person
on Academy Island,

00:22:48.401 --> 00:22:49.971 position:10% line:89% align:start
you won our game by accident,

00:22:50.104 --> 00:22:52.405 position:27% line:83% align:start
and you seriously
didn't know my secret?

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:54.775 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yeah, that's more or less
the gist of it.

00:22:54.909 --> 00:22:57.745 position:13% line:89% align:start
But, then that would mean,

00:22:57.879 --> 00:22:59.981 position:10% line:89% align:start
I did all of this to myself?

00:23:00.514 --> 00:23:02.049 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Woah, wait a minute.

00:23:02.183 --> 00:23:05.385 position:30% line:83% align:start
She's a double,
ergo she's not the real Empress.

00:23:05.519 --> 00:23:07.521 position:30% line:83% align:start
So, it follows
that she's not a daughter

00:23:07.655 --> 00:23:08.856 position:19% line:89% align:start
of the Saionji family.

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:10.390 position:33% line:83% align:start
Which means,
even though I beat her,

00:23:10.524 --> 00:23:11.525 position:33% line:83% align:start
the director
would have no reason

00:23:11.659 --> 00:23:13.261 position:13% line:89% align:start
to be angry with me, right?

00:23:13.393 --> 00:23:14.695 position:5% line:89% align:start
So, why the heck did I even need

00:23:14.829 --> 00:23:17.131 position:19% line:83% align:start
to become a Seven Star
in the first place?

00:23:21.535 --> 00:23:25.072 position:13% line:89% align:start
/Eh. That's a dorm? Really?

00:23:25.472 --> 00:23:27.074 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's one thing after another.

00:23:27.375 --> 00:23:29.010 position:27% line:89% align:start
I mean, come on!

00:23:32.079 --> 00:23:33.848 position:35% line:89% align:start
'Scuse me.

00:23:34.749 --> 00:23:37.652 position:13% line:89% align:start
I welcome you home, Master.

00:23:40.154 --> 00:23:41.722 position:44% line:89% align:start
Woah.

00:23:42.823 --> 00:23:44.859 position:38% line:83% align:start
/[HIROTO]
Major cutie.
