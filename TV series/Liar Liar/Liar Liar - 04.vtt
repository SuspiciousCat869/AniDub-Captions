00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:10.879 position:5% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI] How nice to see you,
Miss Sly Fox.

00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:13.380 position:21% line:83% align:start
[ICHINOSE] Come now,
slapping honorifics on a slight

00:00:13.515 --> 00:00:15.517 position:21% line:83% align:start
doesn't make it sound
any less petty, you know?

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.118 position:7% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI] Is there something
I can help you with today?

00:00:18.252 --> 00:00:20.053 position:35% line:83% align:start
[ICHINOSE]
Still frosty, I see.

00:00:20.187 --> 00:00:22.055 position:21% line:83% align:start
As a matter of fact,
yes, there is.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.058 position:13% line:83% align:start
I have a question for you,
Shirayuki.

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:27.595 position:7% line:89% align:start
Your master, Hiroto Shinohara,

00:00:27.729 --> 00:00:30.464 position:16% line:83% align:start
has secured a respectable
four victories thus far.

00:00:30.598 --> 00:00:32.734 position:19% line:83% align:start
What rank do you think
he's achieved from this?

00:00:32.867 --> 00:00:35.168 position:7% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI] Since his position
as a faux-Seven Star

00:00:35.302 --> 00:00:36.938 position:33% line:83% align:start
prohibits him
from accruing more,

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.506 position:5% line:89% align:start
I imagine he's still only a One.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.742 position:35% line:83% align:start
[ICHINOSE]
[snicker] Wrong.

00:00:40.875 --> 00:00:44.478 position:7% line:83% align:start
Hiroto Shinohara's actual rank
is now that of a Two Star.

00:00:45.513 --> 00:00:47.414 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Why is that?
-You remember

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:49.551 position:7% line:83% align:start
how the Unique Stars function,
right?

00:00:49.684 --> 00:00:51.753 position:5% line:83% align:start
When the holder of a Unique Star
loses a game,

00:00:51.886 --> 00:00:55.023 position:16% line:83% align:start
that star is, invariably,
stripped away from them.

00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:56.456 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
Yes.

00:00:56.591 --> 00:00:58.191 position:35% line:83% align:start
[ICHINOSE]
Flashing back to his last game,

00:00:58.325 --> 00:01:00.595 position:24% line:83% align:start
Shinohara defeated
the holder of the Indigo Star,

00:01:00.728 --> 00:01:03.397 position:16% line:83% align:start
the so-called "Phoenix",
Seiran Kugasaki.

00:01:03.531 --> 00:01:07.001 position:16% line:83% align:start
As a supposed Seven Star,
Shinohara's already maxed out.

00:01:07.134 --> 00:01:10.370 position:7% line:83% align:start
And yet, the rules mandate that
the Indigo Star Kugasaki held

00:01:10.505 --> 00:01:12.272 position:5% line:89% align:start
go to the one who defeated him.

00:01:12.406 --> 00:01:13.440 position:19% line:89% align:start
The standard solution?

00:01:13.575 --> 00:01:15.142 position:5% line:89% align:start
One of the winner's normal stars

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:16.911 position:35% line:83% align:start
is replaced
with the unique star.

00:01:17.477 --> 00:01:19.279 position:10% line:89% align:start
Wait a second, but that's...

00:01:19.413 --> 00:01:23.017 position:7% line:83% align:start
Indeed, it's just not possible
in Shinohara's case.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.285 position:10% line:89% align:start
He only holds a colored Star.

00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:27.487 position:5% line:89% align:start
He doesn't have any normal ones.

00:01:28.022 --> 00:01:29.791 position:10% line:89% align:start
In this unlikely eventuality,

00:01:29.924 --> 00:01:33.393 position:13% line:83% align:start
the winner is simply given
the Unique Star as supplemental.

00:01:33.528 --> 00:01:35.663 position:33% line:83% align:start
So Shinohara
is now "double-colored".

00:01:35.797 --> 00:01:37.966 position:33% line:83% align:start
Holding stars
both Red and Indigo.

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:39.366 position:10% line:89% align:start
Should he carry on as he has,

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:41.468 position:24% line:83% align:start
defeating players
with Unique Stars,

00:01:41.603 --> 00:01:45.573 position:7% line:83% align:start
he could become an unparalleled
"all-colored" Seven Star.

00:01:45.707 --> 00:01:47.809 position:7% line:83% align:start
He's won all four of the games
he's played so far,

00:01:47.942 --> 00:01:50.177 position:27% line:83% align:start
two of them being
against the Empress and Phoenix,

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.579 position:21% line:83% align:start
with the latter being
on the merit

00:01:51.713 --> 00:01:53.081 position:10% line:89% align:start
of his own personal aptitude.

00:01:53.213 --> 00:01:54.448 position:24% line:89% align:start
And through it all,

00:01:54.582 --> 00:01:56.283 position:27% line:83% align:start
he's demonstrated
exceptional versatility,

00:01:56.416 --> 00:01:58.019 position:21% line:89% align:start
wit, and imagination.

00:01:58.418 --> 00:01:59.787 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
Tell me,

00:01:59.921 --> 00:02:01.522 position:30% line:83% align:start
were you aware
my master had such capabilities

00:02:01.656 --> 00:02:03.357 position:13% line:83% align:start
when you first brought him
to the island?

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:04.792 position:35% line:83% align:start
[ICHINOSE]
Who knows?

00:02:04.926 --> 00:02:06.594 position:30% line:83% align:start
Let's just say
it was obvious he was worth more

00:02:06.728 --> 00:02:08.830 position:19% line:83% align:start
than his transfer exams
indicated.

00:02:09.262 --> 00:02:11.431 position:33% line:83% align:start
"Worth more"?
Are you trying to use him?

00:02:11.566 --> 00:02:13.067 position:35% line:83% align:start
[ICHINOSE]
I am using him.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.203 position:13% line:83% align:start
He's a means of helping me
achieve my ambitions, after all.

00:02:16.336 --> 00:02:18.539 position:19% line:83% align:start
Shinohara must already
realize that himself.

00:02:18.673 --> 00:02:20.541 position:5% line:89% align:start
We're using each other. Simple.

00:02:20.675 --> 00:02:22.877 position:19% line:83% align:start
Shinohara has a reason
to stay on the island,

00:02:23.011 --> 00:02:25.813 position:10% line:83% align:start
and joyously, I have a reason
to keep him here.

00:02:25.947 --> 00:02:27.982 position:13% line:89% align:start
See? Our interests overlap.

00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:30.417 position:16% line:89% align:start
You're using each other?

00:02:30.551 --> 00:02:31.853 position:35% line:83% align:start
[ICHINOSE]
Still,

00:02:31.986 --> 00:02:33.420 position:27% line:83% align:start
things may not go
this smoothly forever.

00:02:33.554 --> 00:02:34.856 position:13% line:89% align:start
If he keeps gaining stars,

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.891 position:35% line:83% align:start
he'll face
greater and greater opposition.

00:02:37.424 --> 00:02:39.927 position:38% line:83% align:start
And then?
Just where will you be?

00:02:41.095 --> 00:02:42.964 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
You needn't worry about that.

00:02:43.097 --> 00:02:47.467 position:19% line:83% align:start
No matter what happens,
I will stay at my master's side.

00:04:23.164 --> 00:04:25.432 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
My name is Himeji Shirayuki.

00:04:25.566 --> 00:04:26.968 position:21% line:89% align:start
Until very recently,

00:04:27.101 --> 00:04:29.436 position:7% line:83% align:start
I was enrolled in Ouka Academy
in District Three,

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.506 position:41% line:83% align:start
but due
to unforeseen circumstances,

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:33.708 position:21% line:83% align:start
I've been transferred
to Eimei Academy.

00:04:34.108 --> 00:04:35.610 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:04:35.977 --> 00:04:37.979 position:19% line:83% align:start
I tend to be quite shy
around new people,

00:04:38.112 --> 00:04:40.081 position:16% line:83% align:start
and find talking to boys
somewhat difficult,

00:04:40.214 --> 00:04:43.117 position:5% line:83% align:start
so I apologize if I can come off
as rude at times.

00:04:43.251 --> 00:04:46.254 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI] Rest assured,
it does not mean I dislike you.

00:04:46.386 --> 00:04:49.489 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI] I'd be grateful
if you could show me patience.

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:52.459 position:24% line:89% align:start
[students exclaim]

00:04:52.593 --> 00:04:54.195 position:27% line:83% align:start
[FEMALE STUDENT]
Ooh, she's so cute!

00:04:54.327 --> 00:04:56.030 position:41% line:83% align:start
[NANA]
All right, settle down.

00:04:57.265 --> 00:04:58.398 position:21% line:89% align:start
Before we get to it,

00:04:58.533 --> 00:05:00.034 position:10% line:83% align:start
I have one more announcement
to make.

00:05:00.168 --> 00:05:03.504 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's about Eimei Academy's
traditional campus free-for-all.

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:05.907 position:30% line:83% align:start
The All-Campus
Elimination Battle

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.340 position:27% line:89% align:start
begins next week.

00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:09.577 position:24% line:83% align:start
Your participation
is compulsory.

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.579 position:7% line:83% align:start
You will be expected to engage
in mock-games

00:05:11.712 --> 00:05:13.614 position:44% line:83% align:start
using
the special "Trial Command".

00:05:13.748 --> 00:05:17.417 position:13% line:83% align:start
Remember, in Trial Games,
Stars cannot be exchanged.

00:05:17.552 --> 00:05:20.087 position:7% line:83% align:start
Also, you're free to challenge
whoever you want.

00:05:20.221 --> 00:05:21.823 position:5% line:89% align:start
Rank restrictions do not apply.

00:05:21.956 --> 00:05:23.925 position:10% line:83% align:start
However, if you're defeated,
you're out.

00:05:24.058 --> 00:05:27.728 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's a last-student standing,
survival-of-the-fittest contest.

00:05:27.862 --> 00:05:29.297 position:13% line:89% align:start
The event will be critical

00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:30.798 position:16% line:83% align:start
in deciding who among you
gets to compete

00:05:30.932 --> 00:05:33.366 position:5% line:83% align:start
in the inter-academy competition
next month.

00:05:33.501 --> 00:05:35.002 position:5% line:89% align:start
Those who place in the top five

00:05:35.136 --> 00:05:37.805 position:19% line:83% align:start
will have the privilege
of representing Eimei Academy.

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:39.307 position:10% line:89% align:start
And whoever lasts the longest

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:41.374 position:27% line:83% align:start
will also receive
a special prize!

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:43.044 position:21% line:89% align:start
So give it your best!

00:05:44.377 --> 00:05:46.379 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Here. This is for you, Himeji.

00:05:46.848 --> 00:05:49.150 position:27% line:83% align:start
Is it okay for me
to accept this?

00:05:49.283 --> 00:05:50.518 position:16% line:89% align:start
After you worked so hard

00:05:50.651 --> 00:05:52.019 position:27% line:83% align:start
to finally obtain
a chocolate cornet?

00:05:52.153 --> 00:05:53.386 position:33% line:89% align:start
Just take it.

00:05:53.521 --> 00:05:55.022 position:35% line:83% align:start
Consider it
a saccharine way of saying

00:05:55.156 --> 00:05:57.558 position:10% line:83% align:start
thank you for coming through
for me in that last match.

00:05:57.692 --> 00:06:01.662 position:30% line:89% align:start
[chowing down]

00:06:01.796 --> 00:06:03.231 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hey, slow down, will you?

00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:05.465 position:21% line:83% align:start
You'll give yourself
a stomachache going like that.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.968 position:30% line:89% align:start
Ah! Excuse me!

00:06:07.101 --> 00:06:09.904 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's so good I could scarcely
restrain myself.

00:06:11.272 --> 00:06:12.506 position:19% line:89% align:start
So, I've been thinking.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.374 position:19% line:83% align:start
The Elimination Battle,
it represents

00:06:14.508 --> 00:06:16.476 position:7% line:83% align:start
a rather unique and challenging
situation

00:06:16.611 --> 00:06:18.145 position:41% line:89% align:start
for us.

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:21.048 position:5% line:83% align:start
This event works on a principle
aptly named "State of Conflict."

00:06:21.182 --> 00:06:23.317 position:16% line:83% align:start
You approach the opponent
you want to challenge

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.186 position:16% line:89% align:start
and make a Trial request.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.822 position:35% line:83% align:start
The request
is automatically accepted,

00:06:27.955 --> 00:06:29.624 position:35% line:83% align:start
locking off
both players' capacity

00:06:29.757 --> 00:06:32.459 position:19% line:83% align:start
to send or receive more
until a winner is decided.

00:06:32.593 --> 00:06:34.427 position:7% line:89% align:start
That is the State of Conflict.

00:06:34.562 --> 00:06:37.064 position:21% line:83% align:start
Now do keep in mind,
this is time-constrained.

00:06:37.198 --> 00:06:38.465 position:5% line:89% align:start
If a State of Conflict persists

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:41.068 position:16% line:83% align:start
for longer than 24 hours
without a Trial,

00:06:41.202 --> 00:06:42.370 position:21% line:89% align:start
you'll be eliminated.

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.239 position:21% line:83% align:start
Even though no Stars
are exchanged in this event,

00:06:45.373 --> 00:06:47.407 position:5% line:89% align:start
your image is still on the line.

00:06:48.109 --> 00:06:49.043 position:24% line:89% align:start
With that in mind,

00:06:49.176 --> 00:06:50.344 position:16% line:89% align:start
we must devise a strategy

00:06:50.477 --> 00:06:52.046 position:21% line:83% align:start
to ensure you achieve
first place.

00:06:52.179 --> 00:06:53.781 position:24% line:83% align:start
Kind of sounds like
just running away

00:06:53.915 --> 00:06:55.249 position:19% line:83% align:start
would be the best move,
doesn't it?

00:06:55.383 --> 00:06:57.585 position:19% line:83% align:start
Indeed, if you maintain
the minimum distance

00:06:57.718 --> 00:06:58.686 position:30% line:89% align:start
as stipulated,

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:00.420 position:13% line:89% align:start
requests won't be accepted.

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:02.690 position:38% line:83% align:start

Hiro. You got company.

[NOA]
You're Hiroto.

00:07:07.895 --> 00:07:09.530 position:21% line:89% align:start
[giggles] Am I right?

00:07:11.498 --> 00:07:12.900 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Oh, man!

00:07:13.034 --> 00:07:15.536 position:27% line:83% align:start
She's giving off
serious "innocent cutie" vibes!

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:17.138 position:27% line:89% align:start
Like a baby deer!

00:07:17.271 --> 00:07:19.573 position:7% line:83% align:start
And those ponytails are just...
[Hiroto chef's kiss]

00:07:20.141 --> 00:07:22.475 position:24% line:89% align:start
Uh, hello? Hiroto?

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:23.945 position:27% line:89% align:start
You ignoring me?

00:07:24.078 --> 00:07:25.780 position:19% line:83% align:start
When a girl this cute
starts talking to you,

00:07:25.913 --> 00:07:27.214 position:10% line:89% align:start
you should listen, you know?

00:07:27.348 --> 00:07:28.448 position:21% line:89% align:start
Makes her feel good.

00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:31.118 position:21% line:83% align:start
Oh, uh, sorry there,
didn't mean to ignore you.

00:07:31.252 --> 00:07:32.653 position:44% line:83% align:start
[NOA]
You didn't?

00:07:32.787 --> 00:07:34.355 position:19% line:83% align:start
Then you must have been
mesmerized by my looks.

00:07:34.487 --> 00:07:36.489 position:7% line:89% align:start
That's totally understandable.

00:07:36.624 --> 00:07:38.893 position:5% line:89% align:start
So mind telling me who you are?

00:07:39.026 --> 00:07:39.760 position:38% line:89% align:start
Who, me?

00:07:39.894 --> 00:07:42.930 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm Noa, or Noa Akizuki in full.

00:07:43.064 --> 00:07:44.098 position:35% line:89% align:start
What's up?

00:07:44.231 --> 00:07:45.566 position:10% line:83% align:start
Don't let the dainty package
fool you,

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.268 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm actually a third year.

00:07:47.401 --> 00:07:49.303 position:10% line:89% align:start
Which means, I'm your senior.

00:07:49.804 --> 00:07:51.839 position:19% line:83% align:start
But try not to hold it
against me.

00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:53.507 position:38% line:89% align:start
[giggles]

00:07:53.975 --> 00:07:56.877 position:10% line:83% align:start
You really are oh-so strong,
Hiroto.

00:07:57.011 --> 00:08:00.448 position:19% line:83% align:start
Wait, you won a battle
for a chocolate cornet, as well?

00:08:00.581 --> 00:08:02.283 position:30% line:89% align:start
[giggles] Yup!

00:08:02.416 --> 00:08:03.551 position:24% line:89% align:start
An easy thing to do

00:08:03.684 --> 00:08:04.852 position:16% line:83% align:start
when you're mega mighty,
super smart,

00:08:04.986 --> 00:08:06.253 position:19% line:89% align:start
and drop-dead adorable.

00:08:06.387 --> 00:08:08.990 position:21% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] [splutters]
So, what do you want?

00:08:10.324 --> 00:08:12.293 position:13% line:89% align:start
Let's see. What do I want?

00:08:12.426 --> 00:08:15.896 position:19% line:83% align:start
Uh, well, I guess there
is one thing I wanted to know,

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:18.532 position:21% line:83% align:start
so spill, are you two
like boyfriend and girlfriend,

00:08:18.666 --> 00:08:19.600 position:38% line:89% align:start
or what?

00:08:19.734 --> 00:08:21.002 position:5% line:89% align:start
You referring to me and Himeji?

00:08:21.135 --> 00:08:22.937 position:41% line:83% align:start
I think
you've got the wrong idea.

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:24.638 position:10% line:89% align:start
At least for the time being,

00:08:24.772 --> 00:08:27.141 position:27% line:83% align:start
we're maintaining
a rather wholesome relationship.

00:08:27.274 --> 00:08:30.211 position:21% line:89% align:start
Huh. Okay. I get it.

00:08:30.344 --> 00:08:32.213 position:10% line:89% align:start
Well, if that's how it is...

00:08:32.346 --> 00:08:33.381 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Fair game.

You're all mine now!

Hey, come on,
get off me already!

00:08:36.784 --> 00:08:38.619 position:21% line:89% align:start
Huh? But why, though?

00:08:38.753 --> 00:08:39.820 position:10% line:89% align:start
Don't you want to snuggle up

00:08:39.954 --> 00:08:42.023 position:13% line:83% align:start
with a little cutie wootie
like me?

00:08:42.156 --> 00:08:44.358 position:38% line:83% align:start

[clears throat]

00:08:47.061 --> 00:08:48.796 position:16% line:83% align:start
Please get to the point,
Akizuki.

00:08:48.929 --> 00:08:51.065 position:38% line:83% align:start
My, what
an impatient, bullish boy

00:08:51.198 --> 00:08:52.099 position:38% line:89% align:start
you are.

00:08:52.233 --> 00:08:53.801 position:30% line:83% align:start
All right then,
have it your way.

00:08:53.934 --> 00:08:56.003 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's about the All-Campus
Elimination Battle.

00:08:56.137 --> 00:08:58.239 position:16% line:83% align:start
Libra did a survey on it,
puff-piece,

00:08:58.372 --> 00:09:01.375 position:7% line:83% align:start
"who do you want to do a Trial
with the most" kind of thing.

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:02.676 position:19% line:89% align:start
And since I'm so strong

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:04.078 position:33% line:83% align:start
and as sweet
as a strawberry tart,

00:09:04.211 --> 00:09:05.913 position:33% line:83% align:start
I'm naturally
near the top of the list,

00:09:06.047 --> 00:09:08.816 position:27% line:83% align:start
but you're by far
the most popular, Hiroto.

00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:10.184 position:24% line:89% align:start
Did you know that?

00:09:10.317 --> 00:09:11.919 position:41% line:83% align:start
Nuh-uh,
hadn't heard a thing about it.

00:09:12.319 --> 00:09:16.123 position:7% line:83% align:start
Huh, you're not too interested
in this, are you?

00:09:16.257 --> 00:09:18.059 position:16% line:89% align:start
I see, that makes sense.

00:09:19.593 --> 00:09:21.695 position:10% line:89% align:start
[giggles] Well, that was all.

00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:24.765 position:38% line:83% align:start
[giggles]
Okie-dokie, bye-bye, Hiroto.

00:09:24.899 --> 00:09:27.668 position:5% line:83% align:start
Thanks so much for chit-chatting
with little ol' me.

00:09:29.737 --> 00:09:31.472 position:21% line:89% align:start
Disarming, isn't she?

00:09:32.039 --> 00:09:35.142 position:33% line:83% align:start
Noa Akizuki,
nicknamed the Little Devil.

00:09:35.276 --> 00:09:37.678 position:38% line:83% align:start
She's one
of only three Six Star students

00:09:37.812 --> 00:09:38.846 position:30% line:89% align:start
here at Eimei.

00:09:38.979 --> 00:09:40.581 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
A Six Star? Seriously?

00:09:40.714 --> 00:09:41.949 position:24% line:89% align:start
She's that strong?

00:09:42.416 --> 00:09:43.651 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:09:43.784 --> 00:09:45.252 position:38% line:83% align:start
Although,
the bad feeling she gives me

00:09:45.386 --> 00:09:46.787 position:19% line:89% align:start
runs deeper than rank.

00:09:46.921 --> 00:09:49.356 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's something monstrous.

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:50.391 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Hiroto grunts]

00:09:50.925 --> 00:09:52.693 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
Forgive my asking, Master,

00:09:52.827 --> 00:09:55.096 position:10% line:83% align:start
but is that the type of girl
you're into?

00:09:55.229 --> 00:09:56.797 position:35% line:89% align:start
Huh? Uh...

00:09:57.198 --> 00:09:58.099 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:10:00.734 --> 00:10:01.902 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Ichinose sighs]

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:05.773 position:33% line:83% align:start
Honestly now,
talk about a nuisance.

00:10:06.207 --> 00:10:08.242 position:21% line:83% align:start
In that critical game
against Kugasaki,

00:10:08.375 --> 00:10:10.778 position:7% line:83% align:start
Shirayuki had to expose herself
to the masses,

00:10:10.911 --> 00:10:12.547 position:5% line:89% align:start
to come to your aid as she did.

00:10:12.947 --> 00:10:15.349 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yet to be supported by a student
from another District

00:10:15.483 --> 00:10:16.684 position:30% line:89% align:start
is unheard of.

00:10:16.817 --> 00:10:18.853 position:27% line:83% align:start
Transferring her
was the only real option

00:10:18.986 --> 00:10:20.589 position:10% line:89% align:start
to avoid garnering suspicion.

00:10:21.122 --> 00:10:22.923 position:35% line:83% align:start
Of course,
her ability to assist you

00:10:23.057 --> 00:10:25.359 position:30% line:83% align:start
in the upcoming
All-Campus Elimination Battle

00:10:25.493 --> 00:10:26.694 position:27% line:89% align:start
was a factor too.

00:10:27.128 --> 00:10:29.396 position:21% line:83% align:start
Do you have any idea
how much red tape's involved

00:10:29.531 --> 00:10:32.099 position:24% line:83% align:start
in pushing through
an abrupt student transfer?

00:10:32.233 --> 00:10:33.868 position:41% line:83% align:start
It came
at no small personal cost

00:10:34.001 --> 00:10:35.537 position:16% line:89% align:start
to yours truly, you know?

00:10:35.669 --> 00:10:39.306 position:10% line:83% align:start
Tit for tat, now I have to do
something for you, right?

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.641 position:27% line:89% align:start
Very perceptive,

00:10:40.774 --> 00:10:42.577 position:47% line:83% align:start
one
of your few likable qualities,

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:43.777 position:35% line:89% align:start
Shinohara.

00:10:44.311 --> 00:10:45.412 position:21% line:89% align:start
Now, listen closely.

00:10:45.547 --> 00:10:47.516 position:35% line:83% align:start
At present,
there are two vexing mysteries

00:10:47.648 --> 00:10:49.416 position:21% line:89% align:start
unfolding on campus.

00:10:49.551 --> 00:10:50.985 position:24% line:89% align:start
The first is this.

00:10:51.118 --> 00:10:52.820 position:10% line:83% align:start
Outside forces are attempting
to stick their noses

00:10:52.953 --> 00:10:54.255 position:16% line:89% align:start
into the upcoming event.

00:10:54.623 --> 00:10:57.858 position:5% line:83% align:start
They've been setting off alarms
here and there since yesterday.

00:10:58.359 --> 00:11:00.794 position:10% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Do you have any kind
of clue what they're after?

00:11:00.928 --> 00:11:02.796 position:16% line:83% align:start
[ICHINOSE] It seems you,
the Seven Star,

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:04.633 position:10% line:89% align:start
are their most likely target.

00:11:04.765 --> 00:11:07.201 position:41% line:83% align:start
You're
in a very enviable position.

00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:08.435 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's good to know.

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:10.771 position:30% line:83% align:start
All right then,
what's the second mystery?

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:12.973 position:13% line:89% align:start
That's the real issue here.

00:11:13.374 --> 00:11:15.843 position:10% line:83% align:start
It involves the Unique Stars,
you see.

00:11:16.243 --> 00:11:20.347 position:10% line:83% align:start
Each campus on Academy Island
is issued one Unique Star.

00:11:20.481 --> 00:11:21.782 position:24% line:89% align:start
Eimei had one, too.

00:11:21.916 --> 00:11:23.951 position:7% line:89% align:start
The unique Green Star in fact.

00:11:24.084 --> 00:11:25.186 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
"Had"?

00:11:25.319 --> 00:11:27.254 position:35% line:83% align:start
[ICHINOSE]
Yes. It was stolen.

00:11:27.388 --> 00:11:30.090 position:30% line:89% align:start
[alarm blaring]

00:11:30.457 --> 00:11:32.293 position:35% line:83% align:start
[ICHINOSE]
We were moving its save location

00:11:32.426 --> 00:11:34.361 position:13% line:83% align:start
with the intent of using it
as a prize

00:11:34.495 --> 00:11:35.763 position:16% line:89% align:start
in the Elimination event.

00:11:35.896 --> 00:11:38.165 position:38% line:83% align:start
However,
it was pilfered in a hack.

00:11:38.299 --> 00:11:39.366 position:30% line:89% align:start
The Green Star.

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:41.969 position:16% line:83% align:start
We know it has some sort
of effect on perception,

00:11:42.102 --> 00:11:44.138 position:13% line:83% align:start
but the abilities it grants
seem to differ greatly

00:11:44.271 --> 00:11:45.906 position:19% line:83% align:start
depending on the person
holding it.

00:11:46.273 --> 00:11:48.175 position:27% line:83% align:start
So, in the hands
of an individual endowed

00:11:48.309 --> 00:11:49.843 position:7% line:89% align:start
with enough skill to steal it,

00:11:49.977 --> 00:11:51.445 position:13% line:89% align:start
who knows what it could do?

00:11:52.012 --> 00:11:53.280 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Awfully convenient

00:11:53.414 --> 00:11:55.115 position:21% line:83% align:start
these things happened
at the same time.

00:11:55.249 --> 00:11:57.051 position:5% line:89% align:start
An overambitious student, maybe?

00:11:57.184 --> 00:11:59.420 position:10% line:83% align:start
[ICHINOSE] It isn't clear yet
if the attacks are connected,

00:11:59.554 --> 00:12:01.055 position:35% line:83% align:start
but there's
a definite possibility

00:12:01.188 --> 00:12:02.923 position:21% line:89% align:start
it's the same person.

00:12:03.357 --> 00:12:04.425 position:27% line:89% align:start
I do hate to ask,

00:12:04.559 --> 00:12:06.493 position:21% line:83% align:start
but could you help us
find this culprit?

00:12:06.628 --> 00:12:09.296 position:19% line:83% align:start
They're likely planning
to take advantage of the contest

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:10.665 position:24% line:89% align:start
to come after you.

00:12:10.798 --> 00:12:12.199 position:16% line:83% align:start
So, as long as you remain
in the game,

00:12:12.333 --> 00:12:15.002 position:13% line:83% align:start
you need only wait for them
to make their move.

00:12:15.836 --> 00:12:17.606 position:35% line:83% align:start
Of course,
there's a complication.

00:12:17.738 --> 00:12:19.240 position:27% line:89% align:start
Whoever they are,

00:12:19.373 --> 00:12:21.108 position:13% line:83% align:start
the culprit's in possession
of a coveted Unique Star.

00:12:21.242 --> 00:12:22.476 position:10% line:89% align:start
Eimei's erstwhile Green Star,

00:12:22.611 --> 00:12:24.245 position:19% line:83% align:start
which you were intended
to win as a prize

00:12:24.378 --> 00:12:26.413 position:27% line:83% align:start
in the All-Campus
Elimination Battle.

00:12:27.248 --> 00:12:28.583 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm sure you don't need me

00:12:28.717 --> 00:12:30.918 position:7% line:83% align:start
to state the obvious necessity
here, do you?

00:12:31.051 --> 00:12:33.754 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're saying I have to win it.

[ICHINOSE]
As such, during this contest,

00:12:37.057 --> 00:12:38.859 position:10% line:89% align:start
you will have three missions.

00:12:38.993 --> 00:12:40.194 position:24% line:89% align:start
The first of which,

00:12:40.327 --> 00:12:41.929 position:24% line:83% align:start
expose the identity
of the saboteur

00:12:42.062 --> 00:12:43.598 position:13% line:89% align:start
behind the recent attacks.

Hm?

00:13:09.691 --> 00:13:12.426 position:16% line:83% align:start
[ICHINOSE] And finally,
score a decisive victory

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.495 position:16% line:83% align:start
and assert your position
as the strongest

00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:15.996 position:24% line:89% align:start
on Academy Island.

[students sighing]

00:13:22.504 --> 00:13:23.571 position:30% line:89% align:start
Clear for now.

00:13:23.705 --> 00:13:25.607 position:19% line:83% align:start
This is gonna be harder
than I thought.

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:27.308 position:10% line:89% align:start
They chase me wherever I go.

00:13:27.441 --> 00:13:29.778 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI] The prospect
of a consequence-free game

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:30.878 position:21% line:89% align:start
against a Seven Star

00:13:31.011 --> 00:13:32.913 position:10% line:89% align:start
is evidently quite appealing.

00:13:33.748 --> 00:13:34.948 position:24% line:89% align:start
For the time being,

00:13:35.082 --> 00:13:36.350 position:38% line:83% align:start
I believe
the best course of action

00:13:36.483 --> 00:13:37.951 position:24% line:89% align:start
is one of inaction.

00:13:38.085 --> 00:13:39.420 position:21% line:89% align:start
Disable their ability

00:13:39.554 --> 00:13:41.388 position:24% line:83% align:start
to see the location
of other participants,

00:13:41.523 --> 00:13:43.324 position:21% line:83% align:start
and temporarily block
Trial requests

00:13:43.457 --> 00:13:45.694 position:10% line:83% align:start
with a standard Device-based
jamming program,

00:13:45.826 --> 00:13:47.194 position:27% line:89% align:start
enabling evasion.

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:52.166 position:35% line:83% align:start

In short, keep running away.

If we can get through
this final lesson,

00:13:57.572 --> 00:13:58.773 position:19% line:89% align:start
the first day is over.

she's president of 2-A,

to go first?

00:14:58.031 --> 00:14:59.199 position:35% line:89% align:start
Of course,

00:14:59.333 --> 00:15:00.702 position:19% line:83% align:start
we can't just have you
go changing back

[SHIRAYUKI]
Perhaps.

00:15:05.239 --> 00:15:07.307 position:13% line:83% align:start
However, when you compel me
to take a bath, Master,

00:15:07.441 --> 00:15:10.477 position:13% line:83% align:start
it flavors rather strongly
of seasoned perversion.

00:15:10.612 --> 00:15:12.212 position:21% line:89% align:start
Excuse my saying so.

00:15:12.346 --> 00:15:14.716 position:41% line:83% align:start

now that the first day is over,

00:15:14.849 --> 00:15:16.450 position:10% line:89% align:start
how are you feeling, Master?

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:18.485 position:38% line:83% align:start
[grunts]
Well, I'm at least relieved that

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:20.555 position:21% line:83% align:start
the location blocking
and device jamming

00:15:20.688 --> 00:15:21.790 position:27% line:89% align:start
proved effective.

00:15:21.922 --> 00:15:24.091 position:38% line:83% align:start
But this
is an elimination contest.

-[SHIRAYUKI] Yes,

a direct confrontation
with that one

00:15:29.531 --> 00:15:31.699 position:19% line:83% align:start
now seems exponentially
more likely.

why you couldn't have waited
for company.

[KAGAYA] See,
the programs we have at hand

I wrote a new Device ability,

00:17:11.465 --> 00:17:13.500 position:24% line:83% align:start

00:17:14.002 --> 00:17:16.671 position:10% line:83% align:start
Basically, she'll be tanking
your challengers for you.

00:17:16.804 --> 00:17:19.239 position:33% line:83% align:start
I call this,
the "Scapegoat Technique".

00:17:19.373 --> 00:17:20.775 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Ah...

00:17:20.909 --> 00:17:22.677 position:21% line:83% align:start
[KAGAYA] That should
at least buy you a few days

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:24.579 position:30% line:83% align:start
while the newbs
pick each other off.

00:17:24.712 --> 00:17:27.347 position:19% line:83% align:start
If it comes down to it,
there is a built-in bail too.

00:17:27.481 --> 00:17:30.117 position:21% line:83% align:start
But that's a ripcord
you can only yank once.

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:31.485 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Yeah, but are you sure

00:17:31.619 --> 00:17:33.320 position:10% line:83% align:start
you're okay with all of this,
Himeji?

00:17:33.453 --> 00:17:36.024 position:21% line:83% align:start
If this act helps you
in even the smallest of ways,

00:17:36.156 --> 00:17:38.026 position:13% line:83% align:start
I would be more than happy
to do it.

00:17:38.158 --> 00:17:39.493 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Oh. Cool.

00:17:39.627 --> 00:17:42.329 position:30% line:83% align:start
Right, I guess
there's no problem, then.

00:17:46.099 --> 00:17:47.502 position:21% line:89% align:start
[notification buzzes]

00:17:49.537 --> 00:17:51.973 position:24% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Well, that
certainly makes things easier.

00:17:52.105 --> 00:17:54.341 position:10% line:89% align:start
All right. Now to do my part.

00:17:54.976 --> 00:17:56.811 position:33% line:89% align:start
And run away!

00:17:57.645 --> 00:18:01.448 position:27% line:89% align:start

[SHIRAYUKI]
Master, we have trouble!

00:18:12.994 --> 00:18:15.295 position:7% line:83% align:start
I just received a transmission
from Kagaya.

00:18:15.429 --> 00:18:16.731 position:19% line:89% align:start
According to her data,

00:18:16.864 --> 00:18:18.533 position:30% line:83% align:start
the All-Campus
Elimination Battle survivors

00:18:18.666 --> 00:18:20.702 position:5% line:89% align:start
are closing in on your location.

00:18:20.835 --> 00:18:22.369 position:21% line:89% align:start
There's 200 of them!

00:18:22.503 --> 00:18:24.271 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Huh? How's that possible?
-[SHIRAYUKI] Your coordinates

00:18:24.404 --> 00:18:26.507 position:19% line:83% align:start
were leaked to everyone
simultaneously.

00:18:26.641 --> 00:18:28.576 position:41% line:83% align:start
Master,
you have to get out of there!

00:18:29.142 --> 00:18:30.243 position:41% line:89% align:start
Got it!

00:18:42.389 --> 00:18:44.291 position:10% line:83% align:start
There wasn't any signal there
a second ago!

00:18:44.424 --> 00:18:46.961 position:13% line:83% align:start
My, fancy seeing you here,
Hiroto.

00:18:47.461 --> 00:18:49.496 position:27% line:89% align:start
Akizuki? But how?

00:18:49.931 --> 00:18:52.265 position:38% line:89% align:start
[panting]

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:53.868 position:33% line:89% align:start
Master, run!

00:18:55.402 --> 00:18:56.738 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Noa giggles]

00:18:59.139 --> 00:19:00.240 position:44% line:83% align:start
[NOA]
You really shouldn't.

00:19:00.374 --> 00:19:01.676 position:13% line:89% align:start
I know you can hardly help

00:19:01.809 --> 00:19:03.544 position:16% line:83% align:start
wanting to have your way
with a cutie like me,

00:19:03.678 --> 00:19:06.380 position:30% line:83% align:start
but using force
is just so wrong.

00:19:06.514 --> 00:19:08.916 position:19% line:89% align:start
Akizuki. Let go of me!

00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:11.853 position:33% line:83% align:start
[NOA] Let go?
What are you talking about?

00:19:11.986 --> 00:19:14.822 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm stuck beneath you, silly.
Completely helpless.

00:19:14.956 --> 00:19:17.792 position:13% line:83% align:start
Because you pushed me down
and got on top me.

00:19:18.358 --> 00:19:21.863 position:24% line:83% align:start
Can't run away now,
can you, Mr. Big Shot?

00:19:25.465 --> 00:19:28.069 position:10% line:89% align:start
Huh! Send a request! Quickly!

00:19:28.201 --> 00:19:29.837 position:38% line:89% align:start
Ah! Okay!

00:19:29.971 --> 00:19:30.872 position:33% line:89% align:start
[phone pings]

00:19:32.874 --> 00:19:33.775 position:33% line:89% align:start
[phone pings]

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:37.779 position:38% line:83% align:start
[groans]
Now that's really too bad.

00:19:37.912 --> 00:19:39.246 position:19% line:89% align:start
Another second or two,

00:19:39.379 --> 00:19:40.915 position:16% line:83% align:start
and we could have ignited
a massive news scandal

00:19:41.049 --> 00:19:42.950 position:10% line:89% align:start
about the deviant Seven Star.

00:19:43.084 --> 00:19:44.284 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, well.

00:19:44.418 --> 00:19:46.353 position:24% line:83% align:start
At least I achieved
my primary goal.

00:19:46.486 --> 00:19:48.388 position:41% line:83% align:start
I guess
that'll have to be enough.

00:19:48.523 --> 00:19:51.491 position:38% line:83% align:start
[giggles]
I'll see you soon, Hiroto.

00:19:51.626 --> 00:19:54.629 position:30% line:83% align:start
Wait, Akizuki!
What's this primary goal?

00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:57.197 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:59.000 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm just a cute, ditzy girl,
silly.

00:19:59.133 --> 00:20:00.702 position:21% line:89% align:start
So what would I know?

00:20:01.135 --> 00:20:02.469 position:38% line:89% align:start
[giggles]

00:20:02.603 --> 00:20:04.906 position:16% line:83% align:start
Sorry I wasn't able to be
of much help.

00:20:05.272 --> 00:20:06.874 position:27% line:83% align:start
"Not much help"?
Are you kidding me?

00:20:07.008 --> 00:20:09.376 position:19% line:83% align:start
If you hadn't shown up,
I'd have been done for.

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:12.113 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're far too generous, Master,
but thank you.

00:20:12.245 --> 00:20:13.581 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Hiroto sighs]

00:20:13.715 --> 00:20:16.216 position:30% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Still,
I wonder what she was after.

00:20:19.419 --> 00:20:21.321 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh, what is this?

00:20:21.889 --> 00:20:22.990 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's a cutlet.

00:20:23.558 --> 00:20:25.760 position:19% line:83% align:start
I put my heart and soul
as a maid into it,

00:20:25.893 --> 00:20:28.295 position:16% line:83% align:start
may it help you be a cut
above the rest.

00:20:28.428 --> 00:20:30.531 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:20:31.032 --> 00:20:31.966 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Thank you.

00:20:32.533 --> 00:20:34.702 position:7% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI] Give me one moment
to prepare it.

00:20:36.537 --> 00:20:37.772 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
What's wrong?

00:20:38.405 --> 00:20:40.174 position:10% line:83% align:start
There isn't any cutlet sauce
in the fridge.

00:20:40.307 --> 00:20:42.844 position:7% line:83% align:start
Oh, yeah. I think we might have
used the last of it.

00:20:42.977 --> 00:20:44.879 position:33% line:83% align:start
There's still
some Worcester sauce in there.

00:20:45.012 --> 00:20:48.149 position:27% line:83% align:start
Sorry. You and I
are both on Team Cutlet Sauce.

00:20:48.281 --> 00:20:50.985 position:13% line:83% align:start
My pride will not allow me
to compromise on that.

00:20:51.519 --> 00:20:52.954 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'll have to go to the store.

00:20:53.087 --> 00:20:54.088 position:13% line:89% align:start
Why not let me go instead?

00:20:54.222 --> 00:20:55.489 position:35% line:89% align:start
You cannot.

00:20:55.623 --> 00:20:57.390 position:13% line:83% align:start
Such a thing would tarnish
my reputation.

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:05.833 position:10% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] And just like that,
Himeji went out.

are you playing at now?

00:21:23.383 --> 00:21:24.619 position:19% line:89% align:start
Huh? What do you mean?

00:21:24.752 --> 00:21:26.187 position:24% line:83% align:start
I was only calling
to say I bumped

00:21:26.353 --> 00:21:27.855 position:10% line:83% align:start
into that little maid friend
of yours.

00:21:27.989 --> 00:21:29.991 position:19% line:83% align:start
Look, if you've so much
as touched her...

00:21:30.124 --> 00:21:32.627 position:35% line:83% align:start
[NOA] Jeez,
you have such a short temper.

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:35.163 position:30% line:83% align:start
Tell you what,
why don't I stick her on?

Your precious, fragile, little

Himeji?

00:21:41.002 --> 00:21:43.838 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's me, Master.
I beg your pardon.

00:21:43.971 --> 00:21:46.874 position:19% line:83% align:start
I fear I won't be able
to return home tonight.

00:21:47.008 --> 00:21:47.975 position:21% line:89% align:start
What are you saying?

00:21:48.109 --> 00:21:49.210 position:21% line:89% align:start
Did she do something?

00:21:49.744 --> 00:21:52.079 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI] Forgive me.
I'm not able to say.

into a temporary

one we must yet resolve.

00:22:02.256 --> 00:22:03.390 position:21% line:89% align:start
Mm-hm. That's right.

00:22:03.524 --> 00:22:06.627 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yes, well, about that...
