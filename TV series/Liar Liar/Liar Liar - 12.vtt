[HIROTO]
So, even with One-Shot Kill.

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:17.652 position:19% line:83% align:start
We still couldn't beat
Miss Hundred Faces.

00:00:17.785 --> 00:00:19.954 position:44% line:83% align:start
Yeah,
I should've expected that.

00:00:20.454 --> 00:00:22.222 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SARASA] Doesn't look good
for us, does it?

00:00:22.557 --> 00:00:23.591 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:00:24.792 --> 00:00:26.059 position:38% line:89% align:start
Saionji?

00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:33.267 position:38% line:89% align:start
You know?

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.969 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm kinda surprised you're not
freaking out right now.

00:00:35.537 --> 00:00:37.070 position:10% line:89% align:start
I could say the same to you.

00:00:37.304 --> 00:00:39.941 position:38% line:83% align:start
Uh. What?
No way, not this girl.

00:00:40.207 --> 00:00:41.441 position:33% line:89% align:start
[both sighs]

00:00:42.844 --> 00:00:43.878 position:38% line:89% align:start
You know.

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:45.212 position:16% line:89% align:start
Now that you're with me,

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:46.480 position:27% line:83% align:start
there's something
that I have to say.

00:00:46.614 --> 00:00:49.249 position:44% line:83% align:start
Huh?
Why do you sound so serious?

00:00:49.884 --> 00:00:51.019 position:38% line:89% align:start
Saionji.

00:00:51.318 --> 00:00:53.688 position:24% line:83% align:start
Shinohara, please,
my heart isn't ready yet!

00:00:54.388 --> 00:00:56.524 position:24% line:83% align:start
I've got a meeting
so you'll need to hide.

00:00:57.124 --> 00:00:58.358 position:41% line:89% align:start
Pardon?

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.934 position:16% line:83% align:start
All right, team. It seems
our all-out war was a bust.

00:01:06.668 --> 00:01:09.571 position:16% line:83% align:start
As things stand, directly
defeating Tsumugi Shiina,

00:01:09.737 --> 00:01:11.773 position:24% line:83% align:start
Miss Hundred Faces,
is impossible.

00:01:12.774 --> 00:01:15.175 position:21% line:83% align:start
So what, are we like,
just supposed to give up?

00:01:15.309 --> 00:01:16.644 position:30% line:89% align:start
Absolutely not.

00:01:17.011 --> 00:01:19.747 position:7% line:83% align:start
If our enemy's willing to play
fast and loose, so will we.

00:01:20.147 --> 00:01:21.649 position:7% line:89% align:start
Whatever it takes, we'll do it.

00:01:21.916 --> 00:01:24.484 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SHINJI] You say that,
but we're still outmatched.

00:01:24.919 --> 00:01:27.055 position:13% line:83% align:start
She's got complete control
of this game.

00:01:27.321 --> 00:01:29.089 position:10% line:89% align:start
Right, so we start a new one.

00:01:29.591 --> 00:01:31.191 position:13% line:89% align:start
Set it up inside of ASTRAL.

00:01:31.325 --> 00:01:32.594 position:30% line:89% align:start
One final game.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.795 position:44% line:83% align:start
[ALL]
Huh?

00:01:34.494 --> 00:01:36.631 position:13% line:83% align:start
It would appear you've been
preparing for this,

00:01:36.764 --> 00:01:37.699 position:24% line:89% align:start
that's commendable.

00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:40.068 position:24% line:83% align:start
But we'd still have
to convince her to play.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.435 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's true.

00:01:41.636 --> 00:01:43.236 position:24% line:83% align:start
Miss Hundred Faces
holds the majority

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:44.639 position:24% line:89% align:start
of the area by far.

00:01:44.772 --> 00:01:46.608 position:30% line:83% align:start
If she can win
just by waiting it out,

00:01:46.741 --> 00:01:48.475 position:35% line:83% align:start
why bother
playing another game?

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.745 position:19% line:83% align:start
And with tomorrow being
the last day,

00:01:50.878 --> 00:01:53.113 position:27% line:83% align:start
Kurahashi'll try
to dig his heels in deep.

00:01:53.313 --> 00:01:55.783 position:44% line:83% align:start
Yeah.
He won't stay out of this,

00:01:55.984 --> 00:01:57.351 position:19% line:89% align:start
which ultimately means

00:01:57.484 --> 00:01:59.954 position:16% line:83% align:start
we're facing off against
two opponents, not one.

00:02:00.888 --> 00:02:03.891 position:33% line:83% align:start
Knowing that.
Are you willing to trust me?

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:06.060 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Yes.
-No question!

00:02:06.193 --> 00:02:07.160 position:35% line:89% align:start
Of course.

00:02:07.294 --> 00:02:08.663 position:35% line:83% align:start
[chuckles]
I guess so.

00:02:08.796 --> 00:02:10.064 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:02:10.464 --> 00:02:12.499 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hmm. I'm counting on you.

00:02:13.101 --> 00:02:14.535 position:7% line:89% align:start
We only have one shot at this.

00:02:14.702 --> 00:02:16.604 position:30% line:83% align:start
Let's show 'em
what we're made of!

00:02:17.005 --> 00:02:18.338 position:35% line:83% align:start
-All right!
-Right!

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:20.775 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Hiroto sighs]

00:02:21.843 --> 00:02:25.245 position:13% line:83% align:start
Now then, how do I convince
Shiina to play a game?

00:02:25.412 --> 00:02:27.247 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUMUGI]
Finally! There you are!

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:29.149 position:38% line:89% align:start
Big bro!

00:02:29.483 --> 00:02:30.785 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
A surprise attack?

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:32.620 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Ah.
-Hey!

00:02:32.787 --> 00:02:35.355 position:19% line:83% align:start
Let's play some games!
Wha'dya say?

00:02:35.623 --> 00:02:36.658 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:02:38.526 --> 00:02:40.227 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUMUGI]
Seriously? I lost again?

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.194 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
She's behaving as though

00:02:41.328 --> 00:02:42.897 position:16% line:89% align:start
yesterday never happened.

00:02:43.631 --> 00:02:46.901 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hey. You are genuinely
Miss Hundred Faces, aren't you?

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.670 position:30% line:89% align:start
Huh? Of course!

00:02:48.803 --> 00:02:52.073 position:7% line:83% align:start
Bona fide participating member
of Seijo Academy!

00:02:52.305 --> 00:02:53.373 position:13% line:89% align:start
How'd you wind up becoming

00:02:53.508 --> 00:02:54.976 position:16% line:83% align:start
involved in all of this,
anyway?

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:56.644 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hmm? How, you ask?

00:02:59.814 --> 00:03:01.582 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, I don't really like
going to school,

00:03:01.716 --> 00:03:03.751 position:19% line:83% align:start
so more often than not,
I just stay home playing games

00:03:03.885 --> 00:03:05.753 position:30% line:83% align:start
and doing stuff
on the computer.

00:03:06.353 --> 00:03:08.255 position:38% line:83% align:start
Oh, yeah,
you've said that before.

00:03:08.623 --> 00:03:10.058 position:16% line:89% align:start
I got into middle school

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.527 position:10% line:83% align:start
and thought I'd be done with
mandatory education soon,

00:03:12.694 --> 00:03:14.327 position:21% line:83% align:start
that I wouldn't have
to deal with dull classes

00:03:14.461 --> 00:03:16.164 position:13% line:89% align:start
and dumb teachers anymore.

00:03:16.396 --> 00:03:17.497 position:21% line:89% align:start
But then, it hit me!

00:03:17.632 --> 00:03:18.966 position:30% line:83% align:start
If I didn't get
into high school,

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.069 position:30% line:83% align:start
I couldn't play
the cool star-catching game!

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:22.870 position:44% line:83% align:start
Okay.
I guess you're right.

00:03:23.004 --> 00:03:24.872 position:10% line:83% align:start
[TSUMUGI] There was no way I
was gonna miss out on something

00:03:25.006 --> 00:03:27.075 position:21% line:83% align:start
that was actually fun
for a change.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.543 position:7% line:89% align:start
So I modded my Device a little

00:03:28.676 --> 00:03:30.410 position:24% line:83% align:start
and force-installed
a special program

00:03:30.545 --> 00:03:31.746 position:24% line:89% align:start
that'd let me play!

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.314 position:7% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] The first fake account
in Academy Island history

00:03:34.448 --> 00:03:36.150 position:7% line:89% align:start
was a boredom-alleviating whim?

00:03:36.283 --> 00:03:37.819 position:38% line:83% align:start
[giggles]
Impressed?

00:03:38.452 --> 00:03:40.555 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yeah, real impressed.

00:03:40.922 --> 00:03:42.222 position:38% line:89% align:start
[giggles]

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.358 position:24% line:83% align:start
But then, one day,
I got this weird message

00:03:45.492 --> 00:03:47.695 position:33% line:83% align:start
from a person
called Mikado-something.

00:03:47.862 --> 00:03:48.796 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.231 position:16% line:83% align:start
He wanted me to join him
and was all like

00:03:51.364 --> 00:03:53.433 position:33% line:83% align:start
"Your talents
would serve me well."

00:03:54.068 --> 00:03:55.570 position:7% line:89% align:start
It was some super shady stuff!

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.040 position:10% line:83% align:start
I mean, really! That's pretty
much evil organization 101!

00:03:59.507 --> 00:04:02.076 position:10% line:83% align:start
Anyway, that's who invited me
to join ASTRAL.

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:03.410 position:10% line:89% align:start
He then gave me this OP Star

00:04:03.544 --> 00:04:05.813 position:27% line:83% align:start
that lets me make
perfect copies of things.

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:07.682 position:33% line:83% align:start
In exchange,
all he asked me to do

00:04:07.815 --> 00:04:09.817 position:38% line:83% align:start
was issue
a proclamation of war.

00:04:10.051 --> 00:04:11.619 position:16% line:83% align:start
The one where I declared
I was gonna defeat

00:04:11.753 --> 00:04:13.788 position:7% line:89% align:start
you and the Empress, remember?

00:04:14.188 --> 00:04:15.223 position:38% line:89% align:start
Vividly.

00:04:15.455 --> 00:04:16.958 position:16% line:89% align:start
So that's what happened.

00:04:17.225 --> 00:04:18.258 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:04:18.893 --> 00:04:22.130 position:13% line:83% align:start
[sighs] Tomorrow's gonna be
ASTRAL's grand finale,

00:04:22.362 --> 00:04:23.731 position:38% line:89% align:start
isn't it?

00:04:23.998 --> 00:04:26.433 position:13% line:83% align:start
The last day I get to play
with everyone at the event.

00:04:26.901 --> 00:04:28.035 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm so excited,

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:32.372 position:24% line:83% align:start
I don't think that
I can sleep a single wink.

00:04:32.974 --> 00:04:34.542 position:24% line:89% align:start
She says, sleeping.

00:04:35.576 --> 00:04:36.811 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Sweet little Shiina.

00:04:37.044 --> 00:04:38.445 position:33% line:83% align:start
She probably
doesn't have a clue

00:04:38.579 --> 00:04:40.081 position:10% line:89% align:start
what's really at stake here.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.783 position:16% line:89% align:start
She's just playing along.

00:04:43.518 --> 00:04:46.220 position:21% line:83% align:start
Victory would be fun,
and defeat disappointing.

00:04:46.687 --> 00:04:48.856 position:35% line:83% align:start
In the end,
it's all just a game to her.

00:04:51.192 --> 00:04:52.994 position:7% line:89% align:start
Still, she's not gonna give up.

00:04:53.326 --> 00:04:56.097 position:7% line:83% align:start
She'll keep on playing the game
until somebody wins.

00:04:56.731 --> 00:04:59.499 position:7% line:83% align:start
Somehow, I have to convince her
that she's already lost.

00:04:59.734 --> 00:05:02.804 position:21% line:83% align:start
That the game's over,
and it's finally time to stop.

00:05:13.247 --> 00:05:15.716 position:21% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] And so, the
three surviving ASTRAL players

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.819 position:27% line:83% align:start
gathered together
on the game field.

00:05:18.385 --> 00:05:19.520 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh.

00:05:19.654 --> 00:05:21.789 position:44% line:83% align:start
Hey.
I've been thinking, Shiina.

00:05:22.223 --> 00:05:23.257 position:38% line:89% align:start
[giggles]

00:05:23.658 --> 00:05:25.726 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm Miss Hundred Faces
right now, silly.

00:05:26.227 --> 00:05:28.663 position:19% line:83% align:start
But wouldn't you rather
end this thing as yourself?

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.464 position:13% line:83% align:start
Show everyone who's really
been playing all this time?

00:05:31.966 --> 00:05:32.867 position:33% line:89% align:start
You think so?

00:05:33.134 --> 00:05:35.636 position:30% line:83% align:start
Fine. I suppose
the Empress act can wait.

00:05:37.038 --> 00:05:38.673 position:19% line:89% align:start
There! Happy, Big Bro?

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.174 position:35% line:89% align:start
"Big bro?"

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.577 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Oh, crap! Oh, and Shiina.

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.979 position:19% line:83% align:start
Since this is the first
we're meeting on the field,

00:05:45.246 --> 00:05:47.715 position:33% line:83% align:start
I think maybe
we should go over the rules.

00:05:47.882 --> 00:05:48.816 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:50.518 position:33% line:83% align:start
As of today,
only three academies

00:05:50.651 --> 00:05:52.220 position:33% line:83% align:start
still remain
in the competition.

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:54.989 position:19% line:83% align:start
Those are Ouka, Eimei,
and Seijo.

00:05:55.723 --> 00:05:57.191 position:7% line:89% align:start
But of the surviving finalists,

00:05:57.325 --> 00:05:58.726 position:7% line:89% align:start
I have the most captured area,

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.329 position:16% line:83% align:start
the most spells, and the
highest support rating, too!

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:02.663 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
You sure do.

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:04.665 position:16% line:83% align:start
But aren't you forgetting
something?

00:06:04.799 --> 00:06:05.533 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:06:05.666 --> 00:06:07.034 position:10% line:89% align:start
Before this contest started,

00:06:07.168 --> 00:06:09.369 position:19% line:83% align:start
you issued a challenge
to Saionji, didn't you?

00:06:10.071 --> 00:06:11.939 position:16% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] You declared war
on her through ITube

00:06:12.073 --> 00:06:14.407 position:30% line:83% align:start
with the whole
of Academy Island watching.

00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:17.678 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh. Guess I did do that.

00:06:17.945 --> 00:06:19.714 position:10% line:83% align:start
You haven't forgotten the win
condition of the game

00:06:19.847 --> 00:06:21.448 position:19% line:83% align:start
you challenged her to,
have you?

00:06:21.682 --> 00:06:23.351 position:35% line:83% align:start
It was kind
of an important point.

00:06:23.684 --> 00:06:25.586 position:24% line:83% align:start
I think it was that
whoever beats you first

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.521 position:21% line:83% align:start
-would be the winner.
-That's right.

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:30.558 position:16% line:83% align:start
So, basically that means
our ranks in ASTRAL

00:06:30.691 --> 00:06:32.226 position:10% line:89% align:start
have no real bearing at all.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.062 position:33% line:83% align:start
I recall you
saying something else, too.

00:06:35.296 --> 00:06:37.565 position:19% line:83% align:start
That if neither of you
could actually beat me,

00:06:37.698 --> 00:06:39.033 position:33% line:83% align:start
then I myself
would be considered

00:06:39.166 --> 00:06:40.935 position:35% line:83% align:start
the victor
of the Empress battle.

00:06:42.136 --> 00:06:43.204 position:16% line:89% align:start
If it came down to that,

00:06:43.337 --> 00:06:44.471 position:30% line:83% align:start
then you agreed
to let me decide

00:06:44.605 --> 00:06:45.840 position:27% line:83% align:start
what would happen
to you afterwards.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.809 position:44% line:83% align:start
Huh?
Did I actually say all of that?

00:06:49.377 --> 00:06:51.312 position:13% line:89% align:start
Ah. It does sound familiar.

00:06:51.545 --> 00:06:54.414 position:7% line:83% align:start
Yeah. Which means in the fight
for the name of "Empress",

00:06:54.649 --> 00:06:57.018 position:19% line:83% align:start
I could technically win
just by running away.

00:06:57.551 --> 00:06:58.886 position:16% line:89% align:start
Honestly, on that front,

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.554 position:16% line:83% align:start
there's no real incentive
for me to fight you.

00:07:00.755 --> 00:07:02.023 position:24% line:89% align:start
But if I did that,

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:03.791 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'd inevitably lose in ASTRAL.

00:07:04.191 --> 00:07:06.127 position:24% line:83% align:start
The same holds true
for Saionji.

00:07:06.761 --> 00:07:07.929 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm not relinquishing

00:07:08.062 --> 00:07:09.496 position:21% line:83% align:start
the throne of Empress
to you, kid.

00:07:09.664 --> 00:07:11.065 position:13% line:89% align:start
A part of me wouldn't mind

00:07:11.198 --> 00:07:13.433 position:10% line:83% align:start
Shinohara playing it evasive
while the clock ran out.

00:07:14.001 --> 00:07:15.002 position:35% line:89% align:start
That said.

00:07:15.236 --> 00:07:16.436 position:21% line:89% align:start
If you do win ASTRAL,

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:17.772 position:27% line:83% align:start
then Ouka Academy
would drop down

00:07:17.905 --> 00:07:19.607 position:41% line:83% align:start
in rank
to at least sixth place.

00:07:20.174 --> 00:07:22.076 position:21% line:83% align:start
That's not something
I can accept.

00:07:22.543 --> 00:07:23.644 position:27% line:89% align:start
So then. Shiina,

00:07:24.145 --> 00:07:26.881 position:16% line:83% align:start
what's say we settle this
with a new game instead?

00:07:27.014 --> 00:07:27.982 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:07:28.115 --> 00:07:30.051 position:30% line:83% align:start
You understand
what I just said, right?

00:07:30.584 --> 00:07:32.186 position:21% line:89% align:start
ASTRAL isn't enough.

00:07:32.687 --> 00:07:36.057 position:16% line:89% align:start
It isn't? Well, uh, okay.

00:07:36.324 --> 00:07:37.558 position:38% line:83% align:start
[smiles]
So then,

00:07:37.692 --> 00:07:39.627 position:38% line:83% align:start
how about
we play winner-take-all

00:07:40.027 --> 00:07:41.829 position:27% line:83% align:start
with another game
called "Crossboard?"

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:45.399 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's a turn-based board game
that works inside ASTRAL.

00:07:45.766 --> 00:07:47.802 position:13% line:83% align:start
If you're able to beat me,
both the competition

00:07:47.935 --> 00:07:49.837 position:16% line:83% align:start
and the title of Empress
belong to you.

00:07:50.338 --> 00:07:53.341 position:19% line:83% align:start
On our end, it gives us
a reason to stand and fight.

00:07:53.607 --> 00:07:56.043 position:13% line:83% align:start
[smiles] I can get onboard
with that.

00:07:59.046 --> 00:08:02.016 position:16% line:83% align:start
Come on, Shiina, this is
what you wanted, isn't it?

00:08:02.283 --> 00:08:03.451 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:08:03.584 --> 00:08:05.519 position:33% line:83% align:start
An invitation
to a star-catching game,

00:08:05.653 --> 00:08:06.988 position:38% line:83% align:start
the thing
that brought you here.

00:08:07.455 --> 00:08:10.524 position:21% line:83% align:start
Your opponent's being
a Six Star genius princess.

00:08:11.659 --> 00:08:13.227 position:13% line:89% align:start
And the Seven Star himself.

00:08:14.028 --> 00:08:17.431 position:7% line:83% align:start
Pass this up, and you'll never
get another chance like it.

00:08:17.665 --> 00:08:19.066 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hah! You're right!

00:08:19.467 --> 00:08:21.369 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yeah! Let's do it!
[giggles]

00:08:21.502 --> 00:08:22.803 position:33% line:83% align:start
Let's finish
this whole thing off

00:08:22.937 --> 00:08:25.172 position:19% line:83% align:start
with an all-or-nothing
game of Crossboard!

00:08:27.141 --> 00:08:29.677 position:38% line:89% align:start
Huh? Aah!

00:08:31.579 --> 00:08:33.280 position:27% line:89% align:start
So cool! So cool!

00:08:37.752 --> 00:08:39.153 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUMUGI]
I can see everything.

00:08:39.387 --> 00:08:41.555 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SARASA] This is some next
level production design.

00:08:41.922 --> 00:08:43.290 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Yeah, it's crazy.

00:08:51.065 --> 00:08:52.967 position:30% line:83% align:start
In Crossboard,
all the ASTRAL spaces

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.102 position:24% line:83% align:start
are compressed down
into just a hundred.

00:08:55.369 --> 00:08:58.005 position:7% line:83% align:start
Player positions and abilities
are all carried over.

00:08:58.606 --> 00:08:59.974 position:27% line:83% align:start
You have an area
and a core base.

00:09:00.107 --> 00:09:02.176 position:19% line:83% align:start
If you lose either one
of those, you're out.

00:09:03.778 --> 00:09:05.646 position:35% line:83% align:start
Listen up,
'cause this bit's important.

00:09:06.247 --> 00:09:08.816 position:16% line:83% align:start
Crossboard is completely
integrated with ASTRAL.

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:10.718 position:27% line:83% align:start
You make a change
on this game board,

00:09:10.851 --> 00:09:12.119 position:19% line:89% align:start
and it'll be reflected

00:09:12.253 --> 00:09:13.821 position:10% line:83% align:start
on the greater playing field
around us.

00:09:13.954 --> 00:09:16.657 position:24% line:83% align:start
Understand? Whoever
takes Eimei's spaces first,

00:09:16.791 --> 00:09:18.359 position:16% line:89% align:start
will be the real Empress.

00:09:18.759 --> 00:09:21.862 position:35% line:83% align:start
Wow, nice.
All right, I'll start, okay?

00:09:22.129 --> 00:09:24.065 position:19% line:83% align:start
[FEMALE GAME VOICE 8A]
Tsumugi Shiina's turn.

00:09:24.331 --> 00:09:25.800 position:13% line:89% align:start
First, take a main action.

00:09:26.734 --> 00:09:28.602 position:24% line:83% align:start
There are two types
of flags to choose from.

00:09:28.736 --> 00:09:30.271 position:35% line:83% align:start
Select one
and place it on the board.

00:09:30.539 --> 00:09:33.707 position:7% line:83% align:start
You can only put it on a space
adjacent to your held area.

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:38.579 position:21% line:89% align:start
Right! I'll go here.

00:09:40.081 --> 00:09:42.850 position:21% line:83% align:start
Aw. Guess that wasn't
your core base, after all.

00:09:43.184 --> 00:09:45.386 position:21% line:83% align:start
You thought you'd win
on the first turn?

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.354 position:13% line:89% align:start
Next up is the sub-action.

00:09:47.588 --> 00:09:50.024 position:10% line:83% align:start
There are three, but you can
only activate one.

00:09:50.758 --> 00:09:52.193 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUMUGI]
Choices, choices.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.663 position:24% line:83% align:start
'Kay! I'll use one
of the Empress' spaces.

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:57.932 position:21% line:89% align:start
Aw, maybe next time!

00:09:58.165 --> 00:10:00.067 position:35% line:83% align:start
All right,
it's your turn now, Big Bro.

00:10:00.502 --> 00:10:02.603 position:19% line:83% align:start
[FEMALE GAME VOICE 8A]
Hiroto Shinohara's turn.

00:10:03.037 --> 00:10:04.071 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right.

00:10:07.074 --> 00:10:09.610 position:21% line:83% align:start
You picked Encroach?
Are you crazy, Big Bro?

00:10:09.977 --> 00:10:11.312 position:7% line:89% align:start
You've only got two spaces left

00:10:11.445 --> 00:10:13.280 position:21% line:83% align:start
and you're sucking up
the turn delay?

00:10:13.414 --> 00:10:14.381 position:30% line:89% align:start
Wait, hold on.

00:10:14.516 --> 00:10:15.517 position:7% line:89% align:start
You're not just letting me win

00:10:15.649 --> 00:10:17.351 position:7% line:89% align:start
out of brotherly love, are you?

00:10:17.485 --> 00:10:18.953 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm not that generous.

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:20.788 position:16% line:83% align:start
And I'm not your brother
either.

00:10:21.489 --> 00:10:24.024 position:19% line:83% align:start
Now, for my sub-action,
I'll use Disrupt.

00:10:24.792 --> 00:10:26.160 position:21% line:89% align:start
We're in a deadlock.

00:10:26.327 --> 00:10:27.495 position:30% line:89% align:start
Ah? A deadlock?

00:10:27.695 --> 00:10:29.196 position:13% line:89% align:start
What are you talking about?

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:30.664 position:30% line:89% align:start
Can't you see?

00:10:30.865 --> 00:10:32.534 position:19% line:83% align:start
Because of Shinohara's
current predicament,

00:10:32.666 --> 00:10:34.135 position:13% line:89% align:start
he's all but attack proof.

00:10:34.435 --> 00:10:36.103 position:13% line:89% align:start
Eimei has two spaces left.

00:10:36.403 --> 00:10:37.838 position:24% line:83% align:start
Since I don't know
which is the core,

00:10:37.972 --> 00:10:39.206 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'd have to weed one out,

00:10:39.373 --> 00:10:41.909 position:27% line:83% align:start
but if I do that
and you take your next turn.

00:10:42.409 --> 00:10:43.477 position:19% line:89% align:start
See the problem, here?

00:10:43.811 --> 00:10:45.012 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:10:45.412 --> 00:10:46.647 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hah, right.

00:10:46.981 --> 00:10:49.483 position:10% line:83% align:start
To secure definitive victory,
you have to beat me.

00:10:49.783 --> 00:10:51.719 position:16% line:83% align:start
But because Crossboard's
turn-based,

00:10:52.119 --> 00:10:54.321 position:21% line:83% align:start
if you get Eimei down
to one space on your move,

00:10:54.488 --> 00:10:56.757 position:24% line:83% align:start
then the other team
will win on theirs.

00:10:57.224 --> 00:10:58.025 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah.

00:10:58.459 --> 00:11:00.427 position:16% line:83% align:start
Basically, neither of you
can attack me

00:11:00.562 --> 00:11:01.662 position:10% line:89% align:start
without handing over the win,

00:11:01.795 --> 00:11:02.997 position:10% line:89% align:start
and your only real option is

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:04.765 position:33% line:83% align:start
to protect me
from the other player.

00:11:04.932 --> 00:11:06.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
Wait, were you planning
to put yourself

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:08.335 position:27% line:83% align:start
in this position
right from the start?

00:11:08.469 --> 00:11:10.271 position:10% line:89% align:start
Well, yeah, of course I was.

00:11:10.572 --> 00:11:12.641 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[chuckles]
-Fine, whatever.

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.776 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'll happily play the long game
if it means Ouka winning.

00:11:16.343 --> 00:11:18.212 position:19% line:83% align:start
[FEMALE GAME VOICE 8A]
Sarasa Saionji's turn.

00:11:21.815 --> 00:11:23.652 position:7% line:89% align:start
I use Disrupt as my sub-action.

00:11:24.151 --> 00:11:25.419 position:19% line:83% align:start
[FEMALE GAME VOICE 8A]
Tsumugi Shiina's turn.

00:11:25.554 --> 00:11:28.822 position:24% line:83% align:start
Now, let me think.
What do I wanna do next?

00:11:28.989 --> 00:11:30.858 position:16% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Looking at her,
Shiina really does strike me

00:11:30.991 --> 00:11:32.527 position:35% line:83% align:start
as someone
who just loves to play.

00:11:32.661 --> 00:11:35.229 position:13% line:83% align:start
She's not the type to cheat
for the sake of winning.

00:11:35.429 --> 00:11:36.730 position:21% line:89% align:start
Uh. What's going on?

00:11:36.864 --> 00:11:38.999 position:27% line:83% align:start
How come Seijo's
taking over my spaces?

00:11:39.133 --> 00:11:40.502 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Both] Huh?
[giggles]

00:11:40.635 --> 00:11:42.870 position:16% line:83% align:start
[TSUMUGI] Why's the color
changing to match mine?

00:11:43.103 --> 00:11:44.972 position:30% line:83% align:start
This isn't one
of your abilities, then?

00:11:45.105 --> 00:11:48.742 position:19% line:89% align:start
Huh? I don't think so.

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:52.346 position:10% line:83% align:start
Wait! Maybe my wicked powers
are so insanely strong

00:11:52.479 --> 00:11:54.348 position:13% line:83% align:start
that they're spilling over
onto the board?

00:11:54.516 --> 00:11:56.585 position:21% line:89% align:start
Ah. Yeah, definitely.

00:11:57.718 --> 00:12:00.689 position:7% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] No way. Shiina hasn't
even taken her action yet.

00:12:00.821 --> 00:12:02.489 position:19% line:83% align:start
There's only one thing
this could be.

00:12:03.123 --> 00:12:05.627 position:44% line:83% align:start
Huh?
What's happening?

00:12:05.826 --> 00:12:07.394 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:12:12.233 --> 00:12:14.502 position:19% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] They're fakes.
Corrupted copies.

00:12:15.069 --> 00:12:16.804 position:27% line:83% align:start
They're the same
as Miss Hundred Faces.

00:12:16.937 --> 00:12:18.806 position:35% line:83% align:start
Wait, what?
They're all just like me?

00:12:18.939 --> 00:12:20.307 position:19% line:83% align:start
You think they're using
the same kind of

00:12:20.441 --> 00:12:22.711 position:21% line:83% align:start
mimicking technology
they used to ape me?

00:12:22.943 --> 00:12:24.345 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh, yeah.

00:12:24.512 --> 00:12:27.281 position:16% line:83% align:start
Some sort of cloned army
brought in to expand his area.

00:12:28.349 --> 00:12:29.718 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's right!

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:31.720 position:10% line:83% align:start
That's totally what I must've
done with my latent powers!

00:12:31.885 --> 00:12:33.487 position:13% line:89% align:start
Pretty cool, huh, Big Bro?

00:12:33.988 --> 00:12:35.389 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Kurahashi's the only one

00:12:35.523 --> 00:12:37.525 position:24% line:83% align:start
who could be making
these corrupt copies appear.

00:12:37.858 --> 00:12:39.226 position:38% line:89% align:start
Damn it.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.061 position:13% line:83% align:start
He's trying to shamelessly
force-win the game.

00:12:41.529 --> 00:12:44.331 position:44% line:83% align:start
Now!
Let's keep up the momentum!

00:12:44.666 --> 00:12:45.899 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hah.

00:12:48.802 --> 00:12:50.505 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
If I lose one more space,

00:12:50.771 --> 00:12:52.873 position:30% line:83% align:start
-I'm done for.
-Shinohara?

00:12:53.007 --> 00:12:54.341 position:24% line:83% align:start
Since the two games
are connected,

00:12:54.475 --> 00:12:56.310 position:27% line:83% align:start
manipulating one
to affect the other

00:12:56.443 --> 00:12:57.545 position:16% line:89% align:start
is a simple undertaking.

00:12:57.679 --> 00:12:59.913 position:16% line:83% align:start
Why even make that a rule
in the first place?

00:13:00.649 --> 00:13:01.683 position:27% line:89% align:start
Isn't it obvious?

00:13:02.216 --> 00:13:04.018 position:27% line:83% align:start
It all comes down
to the basic balance

00:13:04.151 --> 00:13:05.520 position:19% line:89% align:start
of risk versus reward.

00:13:05.819 --> 00:13:07.821 position:35% line:83% align:start
That said.
With teammates like mine,

00:13:07.955 --> 00:13:09.323 position:16% line:89% align:start
risk just isn't a thing.

00:13:09.658 --> 00:13:11.526 position:19% line:83% align:start
[FEMALE GAME VOICE 8A]
Hiroto Shinohara's turn.

00:13:12.059 --> 00:13:13.628 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Hmm. Ah.
-Hmm. Ah.

00:13:13.794 --> 00:13:15.129 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Ah?
-Ah?

00:13:17.732 --> 00:13:19.967 position:19% line:83% align:start
Nanase, you're flanked
to your left and right!

00:13:20.434 --> 00:13:22.771 position:10% line:83% align:start
Create some aerial distance,
then shoot!

00:13:23.237 --> 00:13:24.838 position:16% line:83% align:start
Follow up with a Barrier
to the left,

00:13:25.139 --> 00:13:27.341 position:27% line:83% align:start
then back on up,
and let 'em have it!

00:13:28.008 --> 00:13:29.910 position:7% line:89% align:start
That's too many orders, Shinji!

00:13:30.944 --> 00:13:32.446 position:44% line:89% align:start
Aah!

00:13:34.014 --> 00:13:35.849 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hah! Easy as pie!

00:13:36.718 --> 00:13:37.951 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHINJI]
Yeah, thanks to me.

00:13:38.085 --> 00:13:39.554 position:35% line:83% align:start
Next time,
just skip the grumbling

00:13:39.688 --> 00:13:41.121 position:10% line:89% align:start
and do what I tell you, okay?

00:13:41.589 --> 00:13:43.123 position:10% line:83% align:start
You're not even gonna give me
some credit

00:13:43.257 --> 00:13:44.491 position:19% line:89% align:start
after that performance?

00:13:44.626 --> 00:13:45.826 position:16% line:89% align:start
Honestly, am I just your

00:13:45.959 --> 00:13:47.861 position:21% line:83% align:start

or something?

-Yeah.
-[SHINJI] Of course you are.

trust to follow my instructions

with absolute
unerring devotion.

00:13:55.135 --> 00:13:56.738 position:7% line:89% align:start
Naturally, that's you, Nanase.

Hah?
Hey, you make it out like

00:13:59.373 --> 00:14:00.974 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm some googly-eyed whack-job

00:14:01.108 --> 00:14:02.644 position:27% line:83% align:start
that has nothing
but total faith in you

00:14:02.777 --> 00:14:03.812 position:16% line:89% align:start
and your decision-making.

[SHINJI]
You don't?

00:14:05.647 --> 00:14:07.649 position:10% line:83% align:start
You're not honestly asking me
to say it, are you?

00:14:07.782 --> 00:14:09.617 position:19% line:83% align:start
Isn't it telling enough
that I keep letting you

00:14:09.751 --> 00:14:11.318 position:16% line:89% align:start
watch my back like this?

00:14:12.486 --> 00:14:13.621 position:35% line:89% align:start
I suppose.

00:14:14.488 --> 00:14:15.790 position:33% line:89% align:start
But, Nanase,

00:14:16.023 --> 00:14:18.359 position:7% line:83% align:start
can we truly describe the part
I play as watching your back,

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:21.261 position:7% line:83% align:start
when all I do is bark commands
from a good, safe, distance?

Really? Don't be so literal,
you idiot!

[KURAHASHI] Nanase Asamiya
and Shinji Enomoto?

Hmm. How are those
two brats still alive?

00:14:31.372 --> 00:14:34.241 position:16% line:83% align:start
Wasn't Kirigaya supposed
to have taken care of them?

00:14:36.544 --> 00:14:37.612 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:41.683 position:16% line:89% align:start

Damn it!

00:14:43.551 --> 00:14:45.754 position:21% line:83% align:start
Even the server logs
have been falsified!

Libra must be in on it, too!

Hiroto Shinohara?

00:14:53.127 --> 00:14:55.062 position:16% line:83% align:start

didn't you?

00:14:55.764 --> 00:14:57.632 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah.

[inhales]

00:15:00.635 --> 00:15:03.337 position:10% line:83% align:start
Ahh, I'll just have to resort
to my old fail-safe.

00:15:03.605 --> 00:15:06.373 position:10% line:83% align:start
If the board's looking bare,
then add a new piece.

00:15:06.508 --> 00:15:08.610 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'll be back in control
in no time.

00:15:08.942 --> 00:15:11.044 position:44% line:83% align:start
Hah.
He's already on my payroll,

00:15:11.245 --> 00:15:13.581 position:19% line:83% align:start
so the least he can do
is make himself useful.

[KURAHASHI]
You know what to do, Kirigaya.

00:15:18.952 --> 00:15:21.756 position:10% line:83% align:start
Go and show those fools that
we're not to be trifled with.

00:15:22.456 --> 00:15:23.858 position:13% line:89% align:start
Nah, that ain't happening,

00:15:23.991 --> 00:15:25.760 position:27% line:83% align:start
and you can drop
this 'we' stuff too.

through your crappy
