00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.280 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Kurahashi chuckling]

00:00:15.884 --> 00:00:17.919 position:21% line:89% align:start
[chuckling continues]

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:20.187 position:19% line:89% align:start
All according to plan.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.056 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm so damn good,
it's almost frightening.

00:00:24.458 --> 00:00:27.127 position:13% line:83% align:start
[KURAHASHI] Just keep doing
what you're doing, my dear.

00:00:27.562 --> 00:00:29.531 position:10% line:89% align:start
You're my ticket to victory.

00:00:30.932 --> 00:00:33.400 position:35% line:89% align:start
[laughing]

00:02:03.791 --> 00:02:04.726 position:38% line:89% align:start
[inhales]

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:05.893 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sigh]

00:02:09.262 --> 00:02:10.932 position:10% line:89% align:start
There you are! Thanks for...

00:02:11.065 --> 00:02:12.499 position:44% line:89% align:start
Myah?

00:02:12.634 --> 00:02:14.035 position:38% line:89% align:start
S-Sarasa?

00:02:14.602 --> 00:02:17.337 position:16% line:83% align:start
But aren't the two of you
meant to be fighting?

00:02:17.805 --> 00:02:18.940 position:35% line:89% align:start
[footsteps]

00:02:19.574 --> 00:02:21.241 position:7% line:89% align:start
That is what the imposter wants

00:02:21.375 --> 00:02:22.510 position:19% line:89% align:start
but since neither of us

00:02:22.644 --> 00:02:24.478 position:21% line:83% align:start
much like being told
what to do.

00:02:25.245 --> 00:02:27.015 position:33% line:83% align:start
We've decided
to team up instead.

00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:27.949 position:41% line:89% align:start
[smugs]

00:02:28.082 --> 00:02:29.416 position:21% line:89% align:start
It was all his idea.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.919 position:5% line:89% align:start
[HIROTO] Hey, Kazami. Be honest.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.055 position:10% line:89% align:start
That video of Tokyo Academy.

00:02:34.388 --> 00:02:36.057 position:19% line:83% align:start
I could tell it really
disturbed you.

00:02:36.824 --> 00:02:38.893 position:13% line:83% align:start
But when the footage aired
the commentary was nothing

00:02:39.027 --> 00:02:41.129 position:30% line:83% align:start
but pure praise
for Ms. Hundred Faces.

00:02:41.328 --> 00:02:44.599 position:10% line:83% align:start
Why would Libra endorse that
kind of senseless violence?

00:02:45.133 --> 00:02:46.801 position:27% line:89% align:start
You can tell me.

00:02:46.934 --> 00:02:48.036 position:41% line:89% align:start
Myaah.

00:02:48.536 --> 00:02:49.771 position:7% line:89% align:start
If we're gonna stand up to her

00:02:49.904 --> 00:02:52.305 position:30% line:83% align:start
then we'll need
Libra's help to do it.

00:02:53.908 --> 00:02:55.275 position:35% line:89% align:start
Forget it!

00:02:55.442 --> 00:02:57.578 position:10% line:83% align:start
You don't want to be dragged
into this non-sense!

00:02:57.745 --> 00:02:58.746 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:02.083 position:38% line:89% align:start
[smiles]

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.451 position:19% line:83% align:start
Don't underestimate us.
Remember.

00:03:04.585 --> 00:03:07.955 position:21% line:83% align:start
We're the Seven Star,
and the rightful Empress.

00:03:08.122 --> 00:03:08.923 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:03:09.057 --> 00:03:09.991 position:38% line:89% align:start
But I...

00:03:10.825 --> 00:03:14.028 position:13% line:83% align:start
Fine, have it your way, but
don't say I didn't warn you.

00:03:14.862 --> 00:03:17.131 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SUZURAN] Ms. Hundred Faces
is an illegal player.

00:03:17.264 --> 00:03:19.433 position:21% line:83% align:start
She isn't affiliated
with any academy

00:03:19.567 --> 00:03:21.135 position:7% line:89% align:start
and so has no right to compete.

00:03:21.268 --> 00:03:24.005 position:16% line:83% align:start
Her account is completely
fabricated, too.

00:03:24.271 --> 00:03:25.840 position:16% line:89% align:start
However, the ally she has

00:03:25.973 --> 00:03:28.743 position:16% line:83% align:start
on the ASTRAL management
committee is very real.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.278 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
That must be Kurahashi.

00:03:31.713 --> 00:03:34.448 position:21% line:83% align:start
Whoever she might be,
her data's all over the place!

00:03:34.582 --> 00:03:36.316 position:30% line:83% align:start
Entire settings
and command structures

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.985 position:24% line:83% align:start
have been rewritten
to help her.

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:40.722 position:5% line:83% align:start
She's a cheating phoney with the
deck stacked in her favor!

00:03:41.155 --> 00:03:42.724 position:10% line:89% align:start
And when I realized the truth

00:03:42.857 --> 00:03:45.793 position:13% line:83% align:start
reality came crashing down
on me like a ton of bricks.

00:03:46.293 --> 00:03:48.096 position:21% line:83% align:start
If Ms. Hundred Faces
manages to win

00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:51.566 position:10% line:83% align:start
it'll be the biggest disaster
in Academy Island's history.

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:53.201 position:10% line:89% align:start
And Libra will take the fall

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:55.335 position:19% line:83% align:start
for being forced to go
along with it.

00:03:55.703 --> 00:03:57.171 position:38% line:89% align:start
[sobbing]

00:03:57.304 --> 00:03:58.806 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SUZURAN]
ASTRAL is supposed to be a fun

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.475 position:13% line:83% align:start
pawsitive thing that brings
the island together.

00:04:01.943 --> 00:04:05.179 position:19% line:83% align:start
I just wanted to put on
an exciting show for everyone.

00:04:05.445 --> 00:04:07.481 position:7% line:89% align:start
All that time planning at Libra

00:04:07.615 --> 00:04:10.450 position:27% line:83% align:start
I put everything
I had into this contest.

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:13.353 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:04:13.487 --> 00:04:15.890 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hey, it's all right.

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:17.290 position:41% line:89% align:start
Sarasa.

00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:18.926 position:35% line:89% align:start
I don't...

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.393 position:30% line:89% align:start
I don't want...

00:04:20.528 --> 00:04:22.897 position:7% line:83% align:start
I don't want Libra to be ruined
by something

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.464 position:21% line:89% align:start
this stupidly unfair!

00:04:24.665 --> 00:04:26.667 position:19% line:83% align:start
I don't want the place
I call home to be destroyed

00:04:26.801 --> 00:04:28.603 position:10% line:89% align:start
by some pointless power grab.

00:04:28.736 --> 00:04:32.372 position:7% line:83% align:start
So, Shinohara, Sarasa, please!
I'm begging you.

00:04:32.907 --> 00:04:35.943 position:16% line:83% align:start
Please save Libra for me
and win this thing!

00:04:36.077 --> 00:04:37.011 position:44% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:04:37.578 --> 00:04:39.346 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm the strongest person
on the island

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:41.281 position:16% line:89% align:start
and she's a close second.

00:04:41.916 --> 00:04:45.887 position:27% line:83% align:start
Ms. Hundred Faces
is nothing compared to us.

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:47.454 position:38% line:89% align:start
[sobbing]

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:49.389 position:38% line:89% align:start
[smiles]

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.896 position:7% line:83% align:start
[SARASA] And why're we sneaking
around squashed together

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:56.264 position:16% line:89% align:start
like packaged meat again?

00:04:56.396 --> 00:04:57.698 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Look, I've told you already!

00:04:57.832 --> 00:04:59.734 position:7% line:89% align:start
ASTRAL rules are clear on this.

00:04:59.867 --> 00:05:01.569 position:16% line:83% align:start
We can't be seen to have
any contact

00:05:01.702 --> 00:05:03.004 position:19% line:89% align:start
with people from Libra!

00:05:03.604 --> 00:05:05.139 position:30% line:89% align:start
[uncomfortable]

00:05:05.273 --> 00:05:06.240 position:24% line:89% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI] Master?

00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:07.340 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hey, watch it!

00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:08.609 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hands off the merch!

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.579 position:24% line:83% align:start
What the, My hand's
not touching anything.

00:05:11.712 --> 00:05:13.681 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yeah, then what did
I just feel?

00:05:14.248 --> 00:05:15.415 position:30% line:89% align:start
[both gasping]

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.885 position:10% line:89% align:start
Okay, now you're pushing it.

00:05:18.019 --> 00:05:19.153 position:16% line:89% align:start
[HIROTO] It's wasn't me!

00:05:19.287 --> 00:05:20.453 position:21% line:89% align:start
Maybe it was Himeji.

00:05:20.922 --> 00:05:23.191 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SARASA] There's no way
Yuki would.

00:05:23.591 --> 00:05:25.626 position:21% line:83% align:start
My actions are beyond
my control.

00:05:26.127 --> 00:05:27.028 position:24% line:89% align:start
[SARASA] Watch it!

00:05:27.161 --> 00:05:29.797 position:35% line:89% align:start
[both yelp]

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:38.072 position:21% line:83% align:start
[SARASA] This is the
United Army ability

00:05:38.206 --> 00:05:39.674 position:13% line:89% align:start
Ms. Hundred Faces is using.

00:05:40.007 --> 00:05:41.776 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
It's worse than I thought.

00:05:42.475 --> 00:05:44.444 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
So this is her umbrella, huh?

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.248 position:7% line:89% align:start
If the description is accurate

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.417 position:7% line:83% align:start
then all academies in her army
will tie for second place

00:05:50.551 --> 00:05:51.919 position:24% line:89% align:start
if she gets first.

00:05:52.053 --> 00:05:53.120 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's a good incentive.

00:05:53.254 --> 00:05:56.023 position:21% line:83% align:start
I can see why people
are so eager to sign up.

00:05:56.456 --> 00:05:57.558 position:21% line:89% align:start
Sure, explains a lot.

00:05:58.292 --> 00:06:01.095 position:13% line:83% align:start
There's already seven teams
sworn to Ms. Hundred Faces,

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:02.597 position:33% line:89% align:start
right, meow?

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.432 position:10% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Well, that certainly
reframes Kururugi's retreat.

00:06:05.633 --> 00:06:07.568 position:10% line:83% align:start
Even solo, she could leverage
the alliance

00:06:07.702 --> 00:06:08.870 position:24% line:89% align:start
and tie for second.

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.106 position:10% line:89% align:start
Ew. Oh, great, he's with her?

00:06:13.473 --> 00:06:16.476 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SARASA] The holder of
the Black Star, Kirigaya Touya.

00:06:16.944 --> 00:06:19.379 position:10% line:83% align:start
He might be even more trouble
than the Demon Maiden.

00:06:19.814 --> 00:06:21.015 position:24% line:89% align:start
[HIROTO] Seriously?

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:26.821 position:19% line:89% align:start
Our position is tenuous

00:06:26.954 --> 00:06:29.257 position:24% line:83% align:start
but if we can unite
the other teams through Libra

00:06:29.557 --> 00:06:30.958 position:10% line:89% align:start
we might still have a chance.

00:06:31.424 --> 00:06:34.095 position:7% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Ms. Hundred Faces has
less than half the total area.

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:37.531 position:7% line:83% align:start
So, if the remaining academies
put their differences aside

00:06:37.665 --> 00:06:39.133 position:13% line:89% align:start
we could turn this around.

00:06:39.466 --> 00:06:42.370 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SARASA] Yeah, but how do we
get them to cooperate with us?

00:06:42.637 --> 00:06:43.971 position:16% line:89% align:start
They have no other choice

00:06:44.138 --> 00:06:46.240 position:30% line:83% align:start
if the alliance
of Ms. Hundred Faces wins

00:06:46.374 --> 00:06:48.209 position:13% line:89% align:start
everyone else loses a star.

00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:49.911 position:30% line:89% align:start
Oh yeah! Right!

00:06:50.044 --> 00:06:52.213 position:24% line:83% align:start
Folks'd do anything
they could to avoid that.

00:06:52.346 --> 00:06:55.116 position:19% line:83% align:start
Like going head-to-head
with Ms. Hundred Faces!

00:06:55.583 --> 00:06:57.585 position:33% line:83% align:start
In that case,
it's time for this phoenix

00:06:57.718 --> 00:06:59.921 position:16% line:83% align:start
to rise up from the ashes
of elimination.

00:07:00.054 --> 00:07:01.956 position:16% line:83% align:start
That should light a fire
under everyone, right?

00:07:02.089 --> 00:07:03.658 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SARASA]
You bet your ass it will.

00:07:03.791 --> 00:07:05.793 position:24% line:83% align:start
The crowd-pleasing
comeback story of the year!

00:07:05.927 --> 00:07:07.895 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI] It's an excellent
idea, Master.

00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:11.232 position:7% line:89% align:start
It looks like I'm off to MTCG.

00:07:11.365 --> 00:07:14.467 position:13% line:83% align:start
If you can manage to clear
the MTCG's hardest route

00:07:14.602 --> 00:07:15.770 position:16% line:89% align:start
you can get the wild card

00:07:15.903 --> 00:07:18.172 position:16% line:83% align:start
that lets you pawticipate
in ASTRAL again.

00:07:18.306 --> 00:07:19.707 position:13% line:89% align:start
Time won't be on your side.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.342 position:27% line:83% align:start
You'll only have
tomorrow morning

00:07:21.474 --> 00:07:22.510 position:16% line:89% align:start
left to clear that route.

00:07:22.643 --> 00:07:24.745 position:19% line:89% align:start
We're cutting it close.

00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:27.982 position:13% line:83% align:start
Kazami, tell me, what's the
quickest possible scenario

00:07:28.115 --> 00:07:30.450 position:16% line:83% align:start
for a participant to win
the wild card?

00:07:30.584 --> 00:07:32.119 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hidden quest, maybe?

00:07:32.253 --> 00:07:34.789 position:10% line:83% align:start
You'd have to beat the sixth
assassin at the end of it.

00:07:34.922 --> 00:07:36.157 position:10% line:89% align:start
[HIROTO] The sixth assassin?

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:37.692 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SUZURAN] They're an outside
competitor

00:07:37.825 --> 00:07:39.360 position:19% line:89% align:start
who's in middle school.

00:07:39.492 --> 00:07:42.196 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Middle school? Wait a sec.

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:43.831 position:13% line:89% align:start
Do you mean Tsumugi Shiina?

00:07:43.965 --> 00:07:46.267 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SUZURAN] Woah! Meow the heck
did you know that?

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.601 position:10% line:89% align:start
[HIROTO] Oh! Well, because...

00:07:47.735 --> 00:07:49.469 position:16% line:89% align:start
How best to explain this.

00:07:50.938 --> 00:07:53.941 position:13% line:83% align:start
So you casually picked up a
middle-school girl in the lobby

00:07:54.075 --> 00:07:56.077 position:19% line:83% align:start
and then took her back
to her room?

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:57.278 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ah-huh.

00:07:57.645 --> 00:07:59.780 position:27% line:83% align:start
You certainly are
a fast worker, aren't you?

00:07:59.914 --> 00:08:01.182 position:19% line:89% align:start
Who would have thought?

00:08:01.315 --> 00:08:03.483 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's all innocent,
I tell you! Innocent!

00:08:03.617 --> 00:08:08.289 position:10% line:83% align:start
Crimes aside, Tsumugi Shiina
is the final boss in the MTCG!

00:08:08.422 --> 00:08:12.059 position:5% line:83% align:start
All right. So tomorrow I need to
enter the MTCG.

00:08:12.193 --> 00:08:15.162 position:16% line:83% align:start
Defeat Shiina in battle,
get my hands on the wild card

00:08:15.296 --> 00:08:17.231 position:13% line:89% align:start
and then return to ASTRAL.

00:08:17.365 --> 00:08:18.299 position:38% line:89% align:start
[sighing]

00:08:18.532 --> 00:08:20.101 position:5% line:89% align:start
Can you guys hold out that long?

00:08:20.868 --> 00:08:22.703 position:19% line:83% align:start
You don't have to worry
about us.

00:08:22.837 --> 00:08:25.072 position:13% line:83% align:start
You're not suddenly getting
cold feet, are you?

00:08:25.206 --> 00:08:26.173 position:35% line:89% align:start
We're fine.

00:08:26.574 --> 00:08:27.742 position:30% line:83% align:start
Eimei and Ouka
can hold their own

00:08:27.875 --> 00:08:29.276 position:19% line:83% align:start
while you're off doing
your thing.

00:08:30.144 --> 00:08:32.446 position:21% line:83% align:start
So you can just focus
your attention

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:36.250 position:5% line:83% align:start
on getting back to us as soon as
you can, you big dummy.

00:08:36.384 --> 00:08:38.085 position:21% line:89% align:start
You're incorrigible.

00:08:39.587 --> 00:08:40.988 position:35% line:89% align:start
[giggling]

00:08:42.823 --> 00:08:44.959 position:30% line:89% align:start
[all chuckling]

00:08:45.092 --> 00:08:47.928 position:35% line:83% align:start
Okay, then,
let's do this thing!

00:08:58.305 --> 00:09:02.309 position:27% line:83% align:start
And here we are!
The site of the annual MTCG.

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:04.245 position:35% line:89% align:start
[surprised]

00:09:10.284 --> 00:09:13.320 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'll be right here to supawt you
just like we discussed.

00:09:13.454 --> 00:09:15.089 position:19% line:89% align:start
Right. Thanks, Kazami.

00:09:15.322 --> 00:09:17.324 position:13% line:83% align:start
Take a look at your device
right meow.

00:09:18.659 --> 00:09:19.994 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SUZURAN]
The most important concepts

00:09:20.127 --> 00:09:21.996 position:7% line:89% align:start
you need to be aware of in MTCG

00:09:22.129 --> 00:09:24.031 position:10% line:89% align:start
are cards, quests, and coins.

00:09:24.165 --> 00:09:25.866 position:19% line:83% align:start
The cards are numbered,
one through nine.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.302 position:16% line:83% align:start
Meow, pay close attention
to these values

00:09:28.436 --> 00:09:29.804 position:7% line:89% align:start
because only by adding them up

00:09:29.937 --> 00:09:31.405 position:35% line:83% align:start
can you get
your furmiliar's level.

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:34.509 position:13% line:83% align:start
There're five quest stages
all sharing the same goal.

00:09:34.642 --> 00:09:36.577 position:27% line:83% align:start
Vanquishing your
opponent's familiar!

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:38.612 position:30% line:83% align:start
Meow, in order
to accomplish this

00:09:38.746 --> 00:09:40.347 position:27% line:83% align:start
you have to raise
your familiar's level

00:09:40.481 --> 00:09:42.383 position:35% line:83% align:start
to be equal
to that of your opponent's.

00:09:42.551 --> 00:09:45.019 position:16% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] I see, so it's a
number-matching game.

00:09:45.419 --> 00:09:46.754 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SUZURAN]
Purrcisely!

00:09:46.887 --> 00:09:48.557 position:21% line:83% align:start
The way you level up,
is by using strengthen

00:09:48.689 --> 00:09:50.291 position:13% line:89% align:start
and exchange on your cards.

00:09:51.225 --> 00:09:52.561 position:24% line:83% align:start
Strengthening takes
time, though

00:09:52.693 --> 00:09:54.595 position:7% line:89% align:start
so try to be conscious of that.

00:09:55.029 --> 00:09:56.197 position:5% line:89% align:start
[HIROTO] Interesting. Looks like

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.099 position:35% line:83% align:start
you have to
pay for the upgrades.

00:09:58.232 --> 00:10:00.734 position:10% line:83% align:start
Which means it's not exactly
the quickest way to level up.

00:10:00.868 --> 00:10:03.337 position:35% line:83% align:start
Not at all.
That's what exchange is for.

00:10:03.471 --> 00:10:05.873 position:7% line:89% align:start
Number augmentation on the fly!

00:10:06.006 --> 00:10:07.675 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SUZURAN] If you're willing
to sweeten the deal

00:10:07.808 --> 00:10:09.143 position:21% line:89% align:start
with some extra coin

00:10:09.276 --> 00:10:10.978 position:13% line:83% align:start
you can use it to trade up
for a better card.

00:10:11.112 --> 00:10:13.981 position:10% line:83% align:start
The exchange rates depend on
comparative value.

00:10:14.115 --> 00:10:17.519 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hm. That makes sense,
the coins bridge the gap.

00:10:17.852 --> 00:10:20.621 position:24% line:83% align:start
Coins are also used
to purrchase skills cards.

00:10:20.754 --> 00:10:22.890 position:27% line:83% align:start
You can nab those
on your device for a fee.

00:10:24.425 --> 00:10:26.528 position:16% line:83% align:start
Your card-carry limit is
hard-capped to five.

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:29.630 position:13% line:83% align:start
Three number cards and two
skills cards. So choose wisely!

so soon, did ya?

you kicked out of ASTRAL!

You come to relegation-land

00:10:53.187 --> 00:10:55.322 position:10% line:83% align:start
looking for a second chance,
too, then?

00:10:55.823 --> 00:10:56.790 position:33% line:89% align:start
Don't bother.

00:10:56.924 --> 00:10:58.527 position:7% line:89% align:start
I made it to quest stage five.

00:10:58.792 --> 00:11:00.961 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm about to clear
this whole thing.

00:11:02.029 --> 00:11:04.932 position:16% line:83% align:start
There's no way you could
catch up at this point.

00:11:05.399 --> 00:11:06.667 position:21% line:89% align:start
[FEMALE STUDENT] Hey.

00:11:08.068 --> 00:11:09.970 position:21% line:83% align:start
Which one of my cards
would you like to trade?

00:11:10.137 --> 00:11:13.073 position:13% line:89% align:start
Uh... Have you got a four?

00:11:13.207 --> 00:11:14.241 position:44% line:89% align:start
One.

00:11:14.408 --> 00:11:15.544 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'd be happy to trade it.

00:11:15.976 --> 00:11:18.647 position:13% line:83% align:start
How does your lowest number
and a 100 coins sound?

00:11:18.979 --> 00:11:20.281 position:30% line:89% align:start
[YUIKAWA] Hey!

00:11:20.447 --> 00:11:22.416 position:13% line:83% align:start
Don't start talking to him
like I'm not here!

00:11:22.584 --> 00:11:24.018 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:11:25.019 --> 00:11:27.855 position:13% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Just a 100 coins?
That'd sure help me out.

00:11:28.322 --> 00:11:29.957 position:7% line:83% align:start
[FEMALE STUDENT] You're trying
to beat her, right?

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:31.560 position:24% line:89% align:start
Ms. Hundred Faces?

00:11:31.892 --> 00:11:33.327 position:13% line:89% align:start
[HIROTO] And what if I am?

00:11:33.994 --> 00:11:37.364 position:21% line:83% align:start
Our academy's leader
Ms. Kururugi,

00:11:37.498 --> 00:11:38.832 position:16% line:89% align:start
is dependable to a fault.

00:11:38.966 --> 00:11:40.868 position:10% line:83% align:start
A trait that surely drove her
to join forces

00:11:41.001 --> 00:11:42.369 position:19% line:89% align:start
with Ms. Hundred Faces.

00:11:43.204 --> 00:11:46.207 position:10% line:83% align:start
[FEMALE STUDENT] She had to,
because we were too weak.

00:11:47.808 --> 00:11:49.276 position:30% line:89% align:start
We failed her.

00:11:50.277 --> 00:11:51.345 position:35% line:89% align:start
That's why.

00:11:51.946 --> 00:11:52.947 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm asking you.

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:55.049 position:10% line:89% align:start
Make your way back to ASTRAL.

00:11:55.849 --> 00:11:58.352 position:13% line:89% align:start
And please, set Senri free.

00:11:59.353 --> 00:12:01.755 position:7% line:89% align:start
We all just wanna get stronger.

00:12:01.889 --> 00:12:04.225 position:24% line:89% align:start
But do it together.

00:12:04.491 --> 00:12:05.426 position:33% line:89% align:start
[phone rings]

00:12:05.859 --> 00:12:06.961 position:41% line:89% align:start

00:12:07.261 --> 00:12:09.897 position:7% line:83% align:start
Thanks for the generous trade.
Seriously.

00:12:10.998 --> 00:12:13.867 position:21% line:83% align:start
And while I can't say
I'm doing it for Tsuyuri

00:12:14.001 --> 00:12:16.470 position:33% line:83% align:start
I will defeat
Ms. Hundred Faces.

00:12:18.005 --> 00:12:20.241 position:21% line:89% align:start
Thank you. Good luck.

00:12:23.043 --> 00:12:24.278 position:27% line:89% align:start

Anticipate it!

00:13:11.492 --> 00:13:13.394 position:21% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] First move.
Reward Up.

00:13:15.062 --> 00:13:16.964 position:27% line:83% align:start
[MTCG GAME VOICE]
Opponent's turn.

00:13:17.097 --> 00:13:18.633 position:10% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] He'll probably open
with level up

00:13:18.767 --> 00:13:20.000 position:21% line:89% align:start
to bolster his value.

00:13:21.435 --> 00:13:22.903 position:27% line:83% align:start
[MTCG GAME VOICE]
It is now your turn.

00:13:23.772 --> 00:13:26.508 position:7% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Now, I'll use level up
to boost my numbers, too.

00:13:28.677 --> 00:13:29.843 position:7% line:89% align:start
[MTCG GAME VOICE] Reveal phase.

00:13:29.977 --> 00:13:32.813 position:33% line:89% align:start
[game sounds]

00:13:36.751 --> 00:13:38.152 position:21% line:89% align:start
We're the same level.

00:13:38.653 --> 00:13:40.187 position:24% line:89% align:start
Which means I win.

00:13:40.421 --> 00:13:41.855 position:38% line:89% align:start
What the!

00:13:45.826 --> 00:13:48.395 position:10% line:83% align:start
[MTCG GAME VOICE] Game over.
The challenger wins.

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:52.900 position:24% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] All right.
If I'm speedrunning this thing

00:13:53.033 --> 00:13:54.435 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm gonna need coins.

00:13:54.968 --> 00:13:57.171 position:30% line:83% align:start
Guess it's time
to make some waves.

00:14:04.378 --> 00:14:06.880 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SUZURAN] The guy rockin' the
polka-dot apron is an adjuster.

00:14:07.014 --> 00:14:09.383 position:21% line:83% align:start
He can exchange cards
and coins for ya.

00:14:10.217 --> 00:14:12.119 position:16% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] I'd like to make
an exchange.

00:14:12.953 --> 00:14:16.890 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'll hand over my one card and
take a reward up card instead.

00:14:19.426 --> 00:14:20.695 position:38% line:89% align:start
[baffled]

00:14:20.829 --> 00:14:22.530 position:7% line:83% align:start
[MALE PLAYER 10A] He's getting
rid of a number card?

00:14:22.664 --> 00:14:24.365 position:13% line:83% align:start
[MALE PLAYER 10B] How does
he expect to clear the game

00:14:24.498 --> 00:14:27.301 position:30% line:83% align:start
if he only has
two number cards?

00:14:27.434 --> 00:14:29.236 position:27% line:89% align:start
Are you certain?

00:14:29.903 --> 00:14:31.639 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
I am. Do it.

00:14:33.173 --> 00:14:34.542 position:27% line:89% align:start
Very well, then.

00:14:35.075 --> 00:14:36.343 position:16% line:89% align:start
The current exchange rate

00:14:36.477 --> 00:14:39.179 position:13% line:83% align:start
between the number one card
and skill up

00:14:39.313 --> 00:14:42.584 position:7% line:89% align:start
is approximately 99,000 coins.

00:14:42.717 --> 00:14:44.017 position:13% line:89% align:start
[FEMALE PLAYER 10A] 99,000?

00:14:44.151 --> 00:14:45.754 position:27% line:83% align:start
[MALE PLAYER 10B]
That's a ridiculous amount!

00:14:45.919 --> 00:14:47.154 position:27% line:83% align:start
[MALE PLAYER 10C]
Seriously?

00:14:47.287 --> 00:14:49.056 position:33% line:83% align:start
Sounds good.
I accept the trade.

00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:50.658 position:35% line:89% align:start
Meow-sands!

00:14:50.891 --> 00:14:52.527 position:33% line:89% align:start
[game sound]

00:14:53.528 --> 00:14:54.928 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Nice.

00:14:55.062 --> 00:14:56.765 position:10% line:83% align:start
[MALE PLAYER 10C] That's days
worth of coins in an instant.

00:14:56.897 --> 00:14:59.534 position:7% line:83% align:start
[MALE PLAYER 10B] Just what the
heck is he gonna do next?

00:14:59.801 --> 00:15:01.902 position:7% line:89% align:start
That was furnominal, Shinohara!

00:15:02.035 --> 00:15:04.938 position:5% line:83% align:start
Nobody else would have ever even
thought of attempting that!

00:15:05.072 --> 00:15:06.240 position:7% line:89% align:start
I suppose now you can exchange

00:15:06.373 --> 00:15:08.342 position:13% line:83% align:start
however many trading cards
you want!

00:15:10.645 --> 00:15:12.479 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Things progressed swiftly.

00:15:14.314 --> 00:15:16.350 position:10% line:89% align:start
Quest after quest giving way.

00:15:18.853 --> 00:15:20.220 position:19% line:89% align:start
Soon, with Libra's help

00:15:20.354 --> 00:15:22.423 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'd even manage to reclaim
a third number card.

00:15:22.557 --> 00:15:24.291 position:10% line:83% align:start
From there, all that was left
for me to do

00:15:24.425 --> 00:15:26.460 position:13% line:83% align:start
was finish getting them up
to nine.

00:15:27.796 --> 00:15:29.531 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TATARA]
Hey, Shinohara!

00:15:29.664 --> 00:15:30.698 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:33.668 position:35% line:89% align:start
[giggling]

00:15:33.802 --> 00:15:35.737 position:13% line:83% align:start
We figured you'd be needing
these about now.

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:36.704 position:38% line:89% align:start
[smiling]

00:15:36.838 --> 00:15:38.138 position:44% line:89% align:start
Tada!

00:15:38.272 --> 00:15:39.808 position:21% line:83% align:start
We've been pumping up
our numbers all day.

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:41.208 position:21% line:89% align:start
Between me and Tatara

00:15:41.341 --> 00:15:43.778 position:19% line:83% align:start
we've managed to secure
two nine cards.

00:15:43.912 --> 00:15:44.945 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, wow.

00:15:45.245 --> 00:15:47.114 position:16% line:83% align:start
And are you guys wanting
to trade them?

00:15:47.247 --> 00:15:48.482 position:24% line:89% align:start
[TATARA] Of course!

00:15:49.283 --> 00:15:50.984 position:19% line:89% align:start
And no exchange rates.

00:15:51.151 --> 00:15:52.953 position:16% line:89% align:start
Eimei, ride or die, baby.

00:15:53.086 --> 00:15:55.055 position:7% line:89% align:start
If you can win here, Shinohara

00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:57.257 position:24% line:83% align:start
Eimei might be able
to turn things around.

00:15:58.091 --> 00:15:59.828 position:13% line:89% align:start
I want to see that happen.

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.629 position:21% line:89% align:start
So, here, take them.

00:16:01.763 --> 00:16:03.096 position:13% line:89% align:start
Our future's in your hands.

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:06.133 position:10% line:83% align:start
So go back to ASTRAL and win.
Got it?

00:16:06.266 --> 00:16:08.302 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yeah. Got it.

00:16:08.703 --> 00:16:09.970 position:27% line:89% align:start
You have my word.

00:16:10.471 --> 00:16:12.372 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'll make your dream come true.

00:16:12.574 --> 00:16:13.675 position:33% line:89% align:start
[game sound]

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:18.178 position:16% line:89% align:start
Tatara. Tsuji. Thank you.

00:16:18.312 --> 00:16:21.415 position:27% line:83% align:start
Don't mention it!
Kick some butt.

00:16:22.483 --> 00:16:24.819 position:35% line:89% align:start
Good luck!

[KAGAYA]
Hey-yo! Hiro!

00:16:27.387 --> 00:16:29.456 position:24% line:89% align:start
You got a sec, man?

00:16:29.591 --> 00:16:31.158 position:19% line:83% align:start
I've been hacking away
at Tsumu-Tsumu's

00:16:31.291 --> 00:16:32.660 position:19% line:89% align:start
data like a lumberjack.

00:16:32.927 --> 00:16:34.161 position:7% line:89% align:start
But security's being obnoxious

00:16:34.294 --> 00:16:36.129 position:33% line:83% align:start
and I'm stuck
on the last password.

00:16:36.263 --> 00:16:39.934 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's typically a numeric value
derived from the player's level

00:16:40.067 --> 00:16:42.169 position:21% line:83% align:start
but deciphering that
could take ages.

00:16:42.302 --> 00:16:44.873 position:27% line:83% align:start
Could you, like,
social-engineer it out of her?

00:16:45.272 --> 00:16:47.007 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yeah. Leave it to me.

00:16:48.342 --> 00:16:50.377 position:38% line:83% align:start

So, Shiina's level, huh?

Shinohara.
You got pretty close there.

00:17:01.823 --> 00:17:04.391 position:33% line:83% align:start
But now stand
and watch in shame!

I'd see you in the MTCG.

you to be the final boss.

[YUIKAWA]
Question.

00:17:34.756 --> 00:17:36.758 position:7% line:83% align:start
What level do you get when you
use a double application

00:17:36.891 --> 00:17:38.793 position:13% line:89% align:start

The answer is a mic-dropping 33!

00:17:46.099 --> 00:17:48.435 position:30% line:89% align:start
[dragon roars]

00:17:49.269 --> 00:17:51.573 position:16% line:89% align:start
33? After all that talk?

00:17:52.006 --> 00:17:54.441 position:24% line:83% align:start
You really thought
that'd be enough to beat me?

totally gonna win, though!

[HIROTO] "Totally?"
You're that certain?

[humming and giggling]

00:18:56.037 --> 00:18:58.673 position:21% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] This game is
just about matching numbers.

00:18:59.473 --> 00:19:02.644 position:21% line:83% align:start
If you only focus on
going high, you'll never win.

00:19:02.777 --> 00:19:04.244 position:33% line:89% align:start
Which means.

00:19:04.378 --> 00:19:06.948 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's low, isn't it?

00:19:07.081 --> 00:19:08.850 position:21% line:89% align:start
That level of yours.

00:19:08.983 --> 00:19:10.250 position:33% line:89% align:start
Is negative!

00:19:11.753 --> 00:19:16.189 position:35% line:83% align:start
Incredible.
You're 100% correct!

00:19:16.758 --> 00:19:19.894 position:30% line:83% align:start
My sum level is
negative 99, in fact.

00:19:20.028 --> 00:19:21.495 position:10% line:89% align:start
Lloyd's a guard dog from hell

00:19:21.629 --> 00:19:23.665 position:21% line:83% align:start
so it only made sense
to invert my level.

00:19:23.831 --> 00:19:27.035 position:7% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Oh, yeah? Sounds like
something you'd think of.

[MTCG GAME VOICE]
It is now your turn.

00:19:50.525 --> 00:19:53.226 position:13% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] I use exceed limit
on all my numbers cards.

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.295 position:13% line:89% align:start
Raising their value by one.

Reveal phase.

00:19:58.198 --> 00:19:59.734 position:30% line:89% align:start
Following that.

00:19:59.867 --> 00:20:01.268 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm at Level 30!

00:20:03.571 --> 00:20:04.839 position:24% line:89% align:start
Why'd you do that?

00:20:05.039 --> 00:20:07.642 position:16% line:83% align:start
You already know my level
is negative 99, right?

00:20:07.775 --> 00:20:09.610 position:27% line:83% align:start
I mean, it's not
like you could have gotten

00:20:09.744 --> 00:20:11.546 position:13% line:89% align:start
that number anyway, but...

Why did Lloyd shoot up
to level 30 all of a sudden?

00:20:17.185 --> 00:20:18.619 position:30% line:89% align:start
[both confused]

00:20:18.753 --> 00:20:20.588 position:5% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Because nimble-fingered
Kagaya hacked your device

00:20:20.722 --> 00:20:22.757 position:35% line:83% align:start
and changed

Just go for it.

Hey, Shiina. Are you her?

[TSUMUGI]
Yup, I am.

00:21:18.846 --> 00:21:21.516 position:30% line:83% align:start
Though I think
Ms. Hundred Faces sounds nicer.

00:21:22.016 --> 00:21:24.619 position:16% line:83% align:start
Next time, let's compete
in ASTRAL, okay?

00:21:24.752 --> 00:21:26.521 position:16% line:83% align:start
We can play a whole bunch
of games together

00:21:26.654 --> 00:21:28.756 position:16% line:83% align:start
and really finish it off

Kurahashi behind all of this!

I've gotta get back
to ASTRAL, quick!

Ah! Yes! Made it!

Yo! Guys!

00:21:57.185 --> 00:21:58.586 position:30% line:89% align:start
This thing on?

00:21:59.452 --> 00:22:00.655 position:38% line:89% align:start
It's me.

00:22:01.421 --> 00:22:03.891 position:7% line:89% align:start
The record-setting seven star.

Is he making a comeback?

00:22:13.234 --> 00:22:17.905 position:10% line:83% align:start
I dropped in on the MTCG and
snagged myself the wild card.

That's right, folks. Yours truly
is back from the dead.

While gone, I learned
something interesting.

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:28.415 position:27% line:83% align:start
Ms. Hundred Faces
isn't even a player.

00:22:29.584 --> 00:22:31.052 position:19% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] She's just an
enemy character

00:22:31.185 --> 00:22:32.854 position:7% line:89% align:start
the admins threw in for kicks.

00:22:32.987 --> 00:22:37.124 position:7% line:83% align:start
A glorified gimmick to make the
contest a little more exciting.

00:22:37.758 --> 00:22:40.728 position:7% line:83% align:start
All of you are the top players
from your academies.

00:22:41.361 --> 00:22:43.531 position:38% line:83% align:start
The cream
of the high-ranking crop.

00:22:44.932 --> 00:22:47.500 position:21% line:83% align:start
So are you gonna let
some sideshow act beat you?

00:22:47.635 --> 00:22:49.804 position:21% line:89% align:start
And steal your stars?

00:22:49.937 --> 00:22:52.773 position:19% line:83% align:start
I realize the situation
we're facing is desperate.

00:22:53.841 --> 00:22:56.277 position:19% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Victory feels
a million miles away.

00:22:57.178 --> 00:23:00.081 position:27% line:83% align:start
But we can choose
not to fall down alone.

00:23:01.249 --> 00:23:03.284 position:10% line:89% align:start
And rise up strong together.

00:23:04.384 --> 00:23:07.054 position:19% line:83% align:start
If we form an alliance,
we could turn the tide

00:23:07.188 --> 00:23:09.489 position:21% line:83% align:start
and push back against
Ms. Hundred Faces.

00:23:10.091 --> 00:23:14.262 position:7% line:83% align:start
Leading from the front will be
the resurrected Seven Star.

00:23:14.394 --> 00:23:17.497 position:7% line:89% align:start
Academy Island's strongest. Me.

00:23:18.666 --> 00:23:20.835 position:24% line:83% align:start
Any team who wants
to join the alliance

00:23:20.968 --> 00:23:24.471 position:10% line:83% align:start
simply make a truce agreement
with Eimei Academy.

We can't give up now!

00:23:28.342 --> 00:23:29.810 position:19% line:83% align:start
[MALE STUDENT 10B] With
the Seven Star on our side.

00:23:32.213 --> 00:23:33.214 position:30% line:89% align:start
[both giggling]

00:23:33.347 --> 00:23:35.149 position:19% line:89% align:start
The enemy of my enemy.

00:23:41.222 --> 00:23:43.090 position:24% line:89% align:start
All right. As one.

00:23:44.091 --> 00:23:46.459 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's time we take
the fight to them.
