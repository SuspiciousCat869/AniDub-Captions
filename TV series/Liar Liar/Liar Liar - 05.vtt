I regret to say I won't be able
to lose that game tomorrow.

00:00:13.815 --> 00:00:15.249 position:21% line:89% align:start
My deepest apologies.

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:18.118 position:16% line:83% align:start
You can punish me any way
you wish, afterwards.

00:00:18.252 --> 00:00:19.554 position:19% line:89% align:start
But until then, please,

00:00:19.687 --> 00:00:21.789 position:13% line:83% align:start
don't try to win this one,
master.

00:00:21.923 --> 00:00:22.757 position:38% line:89% align:start
[giggles]

00:00:22.891 --> 00:00:24.559 position:16% line:89% align:start
Perfectly safe, you see?

00:00:24.692 --> 00:00:25.793 position:24% line:89% align:start
And you doubted me.

00:00:25.927 --> 00:00:27.361 position:24% line:89% align:start
Anyways, gotta go!

00:00:27.494 --> 00:00:28.495 position:38% line:89% align:start
Bye-Bye!

00:00:30.297 --> 00:00:31.866 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SARASA]
So that's how it is.

00:00:32.734 --> 00:00:35.570 position:21% line:83% align:start
The Little Devil was
behind everything.

00:00:36.336 --> 00:00:37.805 position:21% line:89% align:start
You've heard of her?

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:39.339 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SARASA]
Who hasn't?

00:00:39.473 --> 00:00:41.009 position:24% line:83% align:start
I mean, a Six Star
with that personality?

00:00:41.141 --> 00:00:43.711 position:7% line:83% align:start
She's probably one of the most
famous people at Eimei.

00:00:43.845 --> 00:00:44.779 position:38% line:89% align:start
[giggles]

00:00:44.913 --> 00:00:46.948 position:10% line:89% align:start
But doing this? Taking Yuki?

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.282 position:19% line:89% align:start
That's not cute at all.

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:50.852 position:5% line:89% align:start
Still, it was all well executed.

00:00:51.853 --> 00:00:54.989 position:19% line:83% align:start
Although, who's to say
she's the mastermind?

00:00:55.122 --> 00:00:56.524 position:10% line:89% align:start
There could be someone else.

00:00:56.658 --> 00:00:58.760 position:21% line:83% align:start
Subversion does seem
to be her thing.

00:00:58.893 --> 00:01:00.060 position:41% line:89% align:start
[mocks]

00:01:00.193 --> 00:01:01.863 position:33% line:83% align:start
She's careful
with what she says.

00:01:01.996 --> 00:01:03.263 position:19% line:89% align:start
Makes her hard to read.

00:01:03.531 --> 00:01:06.066 position:16% line:83% align:start
Obfuscating the truth is
the Little Devil's specialty

00:01:06.199 --> 00:01:07.569 position:21% line:89% align:start
but, all that aside,

00:01:07.702 --> 00:01:10.038 position:21% line:83% align:start
I don't see how we're
gonna win without Yuki.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.640 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm not exactly well-versed
at cheating.

00:01:13.007 --> 00:01:14.374 position:24% line:89% align:start
You're telling me.

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:16.511 position:27% line:83% align:start
I don't even know
how to contact the Company.

00:01:16.644 --> 00:01:18.580 position:35% line:83% align:start
-So what--
-[KAGAYA] I'm home!

00:01:18.713 --> 00:01:20.014 position:27% line:89% align:start
[both surprised]

00:01:20.247 --> 00:01:21.783 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Kagaya?

00:01:22.984 --> 00:01:24.886 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yup, Kagaya is my name.

00:01:25.019 --> 00:01:26.821 position:30% line:89% align:start
Probs. Maybies.

00:01:26.955 --> 00:01:28.288 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:01:28.422 --> 00:01:30.792 position:21% line:83% align:start
What's Hiro-bro doin'
chillin' at my place?

00:01:30.925 --> 00:01:31.826 position:41% line:89% align:start
[thud]

00:01:33.226 --> 00:01:34.762 position:33% line:59% align:start
Nice timing.

00:01:37.699 --> 00:01:40.434 position:21% line:83% align:start
Sh-Sh-Sh-Shirayuki's
gone missing?

00:01:40.568 --> 00:01:43.303 position:27% line:65% align:start
Hiro, did you try
to force yourself on her?

00:01:43.437 --> 00:01:45.272 position:5% line:71% align:start
I'd never! She didn't run away!

00:01:45.405 --> 00:01:47.341 position:7% line:71% align:start
Akizuki probably ambushed her.

00:01:47.474 --> 00:01:48.810 position:24% line:89% align:start
She was kidnapped.

00:01:48.943 --> 00:01:51.045 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KAGAYA]
Oh, the humanity!

00:01:51.178 --> 00:01:52.947 position:10% line:89% align:start
And, who's she? Looks shady.

00:01:53.081 --> 00:01:56.017 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh, well, I'm Shinohara's ally.

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:57.284 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Hm.
-Yeah.

00:01:57.417 --> 00:01:59.119 position:13% line:89% align:start
She's a friend I can trust.

00:01:59.654 --> 00:02:01.254 position:7% line:89% align:start
The interrogation stops there.

00:02:01.388 --> 00:02:02.957 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's real nice to meet you.

00:02:03.091 --> 00:02:04.257 position:24% line:89% align:start
Okay, Hoodie Girl.

00:02:04.391 --> 00:02:07.028 position:35% line:83% align:start
Um, I guess
you can call me that.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.463 position:21% line:89% align:start
All right, moving on.

00:02:09.597 --> 00:02:12.533 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's time for a plan
to rescue Himeji.

00:02:12.667 --> 00:02:14.736 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:18.338 position:7% line:83% align:start
Here's the details on the game
Shirayuki requested.

00:02:18.472 --> 00:02:20.374 position:13% line:89% align:start
The Scalene Love Triangle.

00:02:20.508 --> 00:02:22.777 position:35% line:83% align:start
Basically,
it's a kind of card game.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.646 position:21% line:83% align:start
Contestants start off
with ten cards,

00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:26.648 position:16% line:83% align:start
which they then play one
at a time.

00:02:27.081 --> 00:02:28.549 position:5% line:89% align:start
Each card has a relative value,

00:02:28.683 --> 00:02:30.051 position:27% line:83% align:start
and whoever plays
the higher one,

00:02:30.183 --> 00:02:31.586 position:13% line:89% align:start
wins 'em both as a reward.

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:33.521 position:13% line:83% align:start
Once all the starting cards
have been played,

00:02:33.655 --> 00:02:35.523 position:27% line:83% align:start
whoever's managed
to claim the most, wins.

00:02:35.657 --> 00:02:38.358 position:21% line:83% align:start
TLDR, get more cards
than your opponent.

00:02:38.492 --> 00:02:40.528 position:30% line:83% align:start
If it's a draw,
the cards stay on the board

00:02:40.662 --> 00:02:42.830 position:7% line:83% align:start
and whoever wins the next round
gets to take the lot.

00:02:42.964 --> 00:02:45.198 position:21% line:83% align:start
So with both players
having ten cards apiece,

00:02:45.332 --> 00:02:47.101 position:19% line:83% align:start
and with one bonus card
set aside,

00:02:47.234 --> 00:02:49.003 position:33% line:83% align:start
that amounts
to 21 cards in total,

00:02:49.137 --> 00:02:51.673 position:10% line:89% align:start
and 21 does not split evenly.

00:02:51.906 --> 00:02:53.741 position:33% line:83% align:start
Which means,
you need the bigger half.

00:02:53.875 --> 00:02:55.877 position:24% line:83% align:start
If you end the game
with at least eleven cards,

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.177 position:38% line:89% align:start
you win.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.478 position:24% line:83% align:start
Now, lemme give you
a breakdown--

00:02:58.613 --> 00:03:00.280 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
She put this together already?

00:03:00.414 --> 00:03:01.749 position:27% line:89% align:start
How smart is she?

00:03:01.883 --> 00:03:04.952 position:19% line:83% align:start
So, uh, what values do
the cards have anyway?

00:03:05.086 --> 00:03:06.453 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chortles]

00:03:06.587 --> 00:03:08.656 position:16% line:83% align:start
I actually just finished
compiling that.

00:03:09.023 --> 00:03:10.257 position:35% line:89% align:start
And, boom!

00:03:11.626 --> 00:03:13.528 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
[exhales] I get it.

00:03:14.062 --> 00:03:17.364 position:10% line:83% align:start
Wait, why's the Commoner card
so underpowered?

00:03:17.497 --> 00:03:18.666 position:30% line:89% align:start
The Commoners.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.501 position:38% line:83% align:start
They have
some cool utility skills

00:03:20.635 --> 00:03:22.970 position:5% line:83% align:start
the others don't have to make up
for their value-weakness.

00:03:23.104 --> 00:03:24.172 position:33% line:89% align:start
Look at this.

00:03:24.304 --> 00:03:25.840 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Are those the sets?

00:03:25.973 --> 00:03:28.208 position:10% line:83% align:start
[KAGAYA] Yup, but which one
you get given is randomized.

00:03:28.341 --> 00:03:30.044 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SARASA]
Set A looks like it's stronger.

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.378 position:41% line:89% align:start
It is.

00:03:31.512 --> 00:03:32.747 position:10% line:89% align:start
Whoever starts off with Set B

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.849 position:24% line:83% align:start
has a huge handicap
right off the bat.

00:03:34.982 --> 00:03:35.950 position:24% line:89% align:start
[cell phone rings]

00:03:37.284 --> 00:03:38.553 position:35% line:89% align:start
What is it?

00:03:38.686 --> 00:03:41.221 position:24% line:83% align:start
A message just sent
from Himeji's Device.

00:03:41.956 --> 00:03:44.158 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SARASA]
A list of her chosen abilities?

00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:46.194 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why's she sharing those with us?

00:03:46.326 --> 00:03:47.461 position:13% line:89% align:start
Well, whatever the reason,

00:03:47.595 --> 00:03:49.731 position:24% line:83% align:start
it certainly makes
planning easier.

00:03:49.864 --> 00:03:52.834 position:13% line:83% align:start
She'll definitely get Set A
with Probability Fluctuation,

00:03:52.967 --> 00:03:55.203 position:13% line:83% align:start
eliminating the randomness
in her favor.

00:03:55.335 --> 00:03:57.237 position:27% line:83% align:start
Sadly, that means
the possibility of you

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.439 position:30% line:83% align:start
getting Set B,
is now a certainty.

00:03:59.807 --> 00:04:02.176 position:30% line:83% align:start
Forced Control?
What's that one about?

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:03.778 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's an insidious ability

00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:06.080 position:13% line:83% align:start
that lets you take control
of your opponent's moves.

00:04:06.214 --> 00:04:07.247 position:38% line:89% align:start
[shocked]

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.482 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SARASA]
Yuki will be able

00:04:08.616 --> 00:04:09.951 position:38% line:83% align:start
to hijack
your first three turns,

00:04:10.084 --> 00:04:12.520 position:19% line:83% align:start
to completely demolish
your opening strategy.

00:04:12.653 --> 00:04:14.254 position:21% line:83% align:start
Your strongest cards
will be wasted

00:04:14.387 --> 00:04:15.690 position:10% line:89% align:start
before you can even use them,

00:04:15.823 --> 00:04:17.725 position:30% line:83% align:start
and she'll gain
a significant early lead.

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.260 position:35% line:83% align:start
After that,
the real game begins.

00:04:20.393 --> 00:04:22.730 position:27% line:83% align:start
Man, this sounds
like an absolute nightmare.

00:04:22.864 --> 00:04:26.200 position:5% line:83% align:start
For real. Yuki's seriously going
for the win here.

00:04:26.333 --> 00:04:27.668 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:04:27.802 --> 00:04:29.871 position:27% line:83% align:start
That, my friends,
is where we come in.

00:04:30.004 --> 00:04:32.339 position:19% line:83% align:start
If you can't win alone,
then don't.

00:04:32.472 --> 00:04:34.509 position:10% line:89% align:start
That is our brand of justice.

00:04:34.642 --> 00:04:36.711 position:27% line:83% align:start
First, as a woman
blessed by electronics,

00:04:36.844 --> 00:04:39.046 position:16% line:83% align:start
your big sis Kagaya here
will hack into the system,

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.348 position:24% line:83% align:start
then our flawless,
magnanimous leader Shirayuki

00:04:41.481 --> 00:04:43.017 position:19% line:89% align:start
will think up a plan--

00:04:43.151 --> 00:04:45.820 position:13% line:83% align:start
Or at least she would have
if she hadn't been kidnapped!

00:04:45.953 --> 00:04:47.121 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's hopeless.

00:04:47.255 --> 00:04:49.456 position:13% line:83% align:start
Shirayuki's always the one
with the strategies.

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.226 position:27% line:83% align:start
A body can't move
without a brain to guide it.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:53.928 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SARASA]
We've got one.

00:04:54.061 --> 00:04:55.428 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Right here.
-Huh?

00:04:55.563 --> 00:04:56.531 position:33% line:89% align:start
I can do it.

00:04:56.664 --> 00:04:58.199 position:7% line:89% align:start
When it comes to strategizing,

00:04:58.331 --> 00:05:00.735 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm at least as experienced
as Yuki.

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:02.770 position:16% line:89% align:start
You would do that for us?

00:05:02.904 --> 00:05:04.371 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yeah, of course.

00:05:04.505 --> 00:05:05.673 position:19% line:89% align:start
But first, I wanna hear

00:05:05.807 --> 00:05:07.008 position:27% line:83% align:start
about the skills
of the Commoner cards.

00:05:07.141 --> 00:05:09.544 position:7% line:83% align:start
Oh, yeah, right, right, right,
on it!

00:05:10.011 --> 00:05:11.646 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KAGAYA]
For a card skill to activate,

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:14.015 position:10% line:83% align:start
it has to remain on the board
when a turn ends.

00:05:14.148 --> 00:05:17.118 position:7% line:83% align:start
So essentially, the skills only
activate when there's a draw.

00:05:17.251 --> 00:05:19.754 position:16% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Woah, those are
some pretty powerful effects.

00:05:19.887 --> 00:05:21.622 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yeah, but they're all
pretty much useless

00:05:21.756 --> 00:05:24.058 position:13% line:83% align:start
unless your opponent plays
a Commoner or an Assassin.

00:05:24.192 --> 00:05:26.426 position:35% line:83% align:start
Yeah, well,
with skills or without them,

00:05:26.561 --> 00:05:28.830 position:10% line:83% align:start
we're still gonna get crushed
at the start.

00:05:28.963 --> 00:05:31.299 position:13% line:83% align:start
Those first three turns are
an unnegotiable mess

00:05:31.431 --> 00:05:32.967 position:13% line:83% align:start
that'll screw everything up
for us.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.670 position:21% line:83% align:start
But they also clue us
into what's gonna happen.

00:05:35.803 --> 00:05:37.238 position:19% line:89% align:start
"What's gonna happen"?

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:38.706 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SARASA]
There are two Commoner skills

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.741 position:30% line:83% align:start
that Yuki will
definitely want rid of first.

00:05:40.875 --> 00:05:43.277 position:27% line:83% align:start
Explosive Growth,
which awards you cards

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:44.745 position:16% line:89% align:start
equal to the turn number,

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:47.181 position:27% line:83% align:start
and Trojan Horse,
which can upend the game.

00:05:47.315 --> 00:05:48.683 position:24% line:89% align:start
Right, makes sense,

00:05:48.816 --> 00:05:50.651 position:16% line:83% align:start
but Forced Control lasts
for three turns.

00:05:50.785 --> 00:05:52.854 position:33% line:83% align:start
Won't she go
after Great Revolution, too?

00:05:52.987 --> 00:05:55.990 position:27% line:83% align:start
Simple Extraction
will allow her to destroy it.

00:05:56.123 --> 00:05:57.625 position:19% line:89% align:start
Ah, if that's the case,

00:05:57.758 --> 00:06:00.761 position:5% line:83% align:start
opening turn, Himeji will play
her Simple Extraction Commoner,

00:06:00.895 --> 00:06:04.031 position:7% line:83% align:start
then make me play my Assassin,
leading to a draw.

00:06:04.165 --> 00:06:06.801 position:10% line:83% align:start
Skill activated, she removes
my Trojan Horse card.

00:06:06.934 --> 00:06:08.468 position:30% line:83% align:start
The next turn,
she'll play a Knight

00:06:08.603 --> 00:06:10.571 position:13% line:83% align:start
to get rid of the Explosive
Growth Commoner,

00:06:10.705 --> 00:06:13.174 position:24% line:83% align:start
then a Royalty card
to take my Knight.

00:06:13.307 --> 00:06:15.877 position:21% line:83% align:start
Not good, by the time
those three turns are up,

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.579 position:30% line:83% align:start
she'll have all
but eviscerated you.

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:20.514 position:16% line:89% align:start
Counting the bonus card,

00:06:20.648 --> 00:06:22.116 position:27% line:83% align:start
we'll already be
seven cards behind

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.085 position:24% line:83% align:start
before we can make
our first real move.

00:06:24.218 --> 00:06:27.154 position:7% line:83% align:start
By which point, she'll only be
four cards away from victory.

00:06:27.288 --> 00:06:29.523 position:7% line:83% align:start
And the cards I would have left
by turn four

00:06:29.657 --> 00:06:31.391 position:21% line:83% align:start
will be way too weak
to catch up.

00:06:31.525 --> 00:06:32.860 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SARASA]
You're not wrong there,

00:06:32.994 --> 00:06:34.996 position:24% line:83% align:start
so if we can't win
by closing the gap,

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:36.964 position:21% line:83% align:start
then maybe we can win
by reversing it.

00:06:37.098 --> 00:06:38.332 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:06:38.465 --> 00:06:39.867 position:27% line:83% align:start
In the abilities
for Six Stars and up,

00:06:40.001 --> 00:06:41.903 position:35% line:83% align:start
there's one
with the name 'Enchant'.

00:06:42.036 --> 00:06:44.605 position:16% line:83% align:start
It lets you imbue an item
with a bonus effect.

00:06:44.739 --> 00:06:46.807 position:16% line:83% align:start
In theory, you could take
a regular Commoner

00:06:46.941 --> 00:06:49.010 position:30% line:83% align:start
from your hand,
and give it a brand-new skill

00:06:49.143 --> 00:06:51.545 position:44% line:83% align:start
like
"Exchange All Collected Cards."

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:54.348 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Huh. Tell me, Kagaya.
-Huh?

00:06:54.481 --> 00:06:57.051 position:19% line:83% align:start
Can you make an ability
like the one she just said?

00:06:57.184 --> 00:06:58.686 position:19% line:89% align:start
One I can actually use?

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:00.221 position:27% line:83% align:start
Some cheat-skill
that would make it look

00:07:00.354 --> 00:07:02.323 position:24% line:83% align:start
like I used Enchant
to turn the tide of the game?

00:07:02.455 --> 00:07:03.858 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's a tough one.

00:07:03.991 --> 00:07:06.260 position:21% line:83% align:start
Maybe I could ask one
of the other members to--

00:07:06.394 --> 00:07:09.462 position:13% line:83% align:start
No, I can't, they might be
monitoring communications.

00:07:09.597 --> 00:07:10.798 position:24% line:83% align:start
Look, you wandering
in here tonight

00:07:10.932 --> 00:07:12.366 position:10% line:89% align:start
was a massive stroke of luck.

00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:13.801 position:24% line:89% align:start
I need you, Kagaya.

00:07:14.135 --> 00:07:14.869 position:27% line:89% align:start
All right, fine.

00:07:15.002 --> 00:07:16.737 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm not sure how I'll do it,

00:07:16.871 --> 00:07:18.471 position:16% line:83% align:start
but as the Company's Head
of Electronics,

00:07:18.606 --> 00:07:19.907 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'll figure something out.

00:07:20.041 --> 00:07:21.542 position:10% line:89% align:start
It'll be the cheapest exploit

00:07:21.676 --> 00:07:23.177 position:24% line:83% align:start
a cheater like you
could ask for!

00:07:23.311 --> 00:07:24.545 position:24% line:89% align:start
I owe you big time!

00:07:24.679 --> 00:07:27.181 position:21% line:83% align:start
Take care of our girl
and we're good.

00:07:27.648 --> 00:07:29.517 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm borrowing the server room.

[chortles]

00:07:32.053 --> 00:07:33.988 position:10% line:89% align:start
I hope she finishes in time.

00:07:34.121 --> 00:07:35.890 position:33% line:83% align:start
Don't worry,
she may appear ditzy,

00:07:36.023 --> 00:07:37.858 position:13% line:89% align:start
but she's a Grade A genius.

00:07:37.992 --> 00:07:39.026 position:35% line:89% align:start
Duly noted,

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.294 position:33% line:83% align:start
now make sure
you load your abilities

00:07:40.428 --> 00:07:41.896 position:5% line:89% align:start
before the game tomorrow, okay?

00:07:42.029 --> 00:07:43.463 position:10% line:89% align:start
The go-to's not certain yet.

00:07:43.597 --> 00:07:45.465 position:21% line:83% align:start
So for now just equip
as best you can.

00:07:45.599 --> 00:07:48.102 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Hmm.
-Hey, what's wrong?

00:07:48.235 --> 00:07:49.469 position:30% line:89% align:start
Himeji told me

00:07:49.603 --> 00:07:51.605 position:21% line:83% align:start
that I shouldn't try
to win this game.

00:07:51.872 --> 00:07:53.274 position:16% line:89% align:start
I know I can't just lose,

00:07:53.407 --> 00:07:55.710 position:13% line:83% align:start
but something about this is
really bothering me.

âª

00:08:07.788 --> 00:08:10.157 position:16% line:83% align:start
Th-Thanks for waiting up,
Shinohara.

00:08:17.898 --> 00:08:20.067 position:10% line:89% align:start
Okay, just to reiterate this.

00:08:20.201 --> 00:08:22.770 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's late, and the only reason
I'm staying here

00:08:22.903 --> 00:08:24.672 position:24% line:83% align:start
is because it's way
past my curfew.

00:08:24.939 --> 00:08:26.407 position:10% line:89% align:start
If I went back at this hour,

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:27.842 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'd get into a whole heap
of trouble,

00:08:27.975 --> 00:08:29.877 position:7% line:83% align:start
resulting in more surveillance
on me,

00:08:30.011 --> 00:08:31.612 position:10% line:83% align:start
and then I couldn't help you
tomorrow.

00:08:31.746 --> 00:08:33.981 position:10% line:89% align:start
All right! I get it already.

00:08:34.281 --> 00:08:35.649 position:33% line:83% align:start
It's not like
I'd kick someone out

00:08:35.783 --> 00:08:37.585 position:13% line:83% align:start
in the middle of the night
anyway.

00:08:37.818 --> 00:08:39.587 position:10% line:89% align:start
Until Yuki gets back safely,

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.255 position:19% line:83% align:start
I can't take any risks
that would--

00:08:41.389 --> 00:08:42.990 position:27% line:89% align:start
I said I get it!

00:08:43.124 --> 00:08:45.626 position:10% line:83% align:start
Geez, if you're that nervous,
go sleep in a different room.

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.162 position:30% line:83% align:start
Look, it's not
like I'm thrilled about this.

00:08:48.295 --> 00:08:51.565 position:10% line:83% align:start
I just really don't wanna be
alone tonight, okay?

00:08:58.539 --> 00:09:00.608 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'll turn off the lights.

00:09:00.741 --> 00:09:02.943 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SARASA]
Yeah, okay.

00:09:10.484 --> 00:09:12.286 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hey, you still awake?

00:09:13.187 --> 00:09:15.156 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SARASA]
You can't get to sleep either?

00:09:15.289 --> 00:09:18.459 position:24% line:83% align:start
-[sighs] Guess not.
-[sighs] I'm glad.

00:09:18.592 --> 00:09:21.996 position:10% line:83% align:start
Honestly, I don't usually go
to bed as early as this,

00:09:22.129 --> 00:09:24.365 position:5% line:89% align:start
and I keep worrying about Yuki.

00:09:24.965 --> 00:09:27.268 position:27% line:83% align:start
Do you wanna chat
until you get tired?

00:09:27.401 --> 00:09:28.736 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SARASA]
I guess.

00:09:28.869 --> 00:09:30.337 position:27% line:89% align:start
How about a quiz?

00:09:30.471 --> 00:09:33.441 position:19% line:83% align:start
Like, fill in the stuff
you don't know about the island.

00:09:33.574 --> 00:09:35.676 position:13% line:83% align:start
The system, and abilities,
and such.

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:37.078 position:41% line:89% align:start
Oh, uh.

00:09:37.211 --> 00:09:38.779 position:13% line:83% align:start
Himeji kind of caught me up
on all that.

00:09:38.913 --> 00:09:40.381 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SARASA]
That sounds like her.

00:09:41.182 --> 00:09:43.552 position:19% line:83% align:start
I could test you to see
how much you've retained?

00:09:43.684 --> 00:09:46.220 position:38% line:83% align:start
No need.
Kagaya can dig it up for me.

00:09:46.353 --> 00:09:48.389 position:5% line:83% align:start
[SARASA] You can't always just
rely on other people, you know?

00:09:48.523 --> 00:09:50.791 position:21% line:83% align:start
With what's going on,
you have to see that.

00:09:51.158 --> 00:09:53.761 position:7% line:83% align:start
It never hurts to be prepared,
after all.

00:09:53.894 --> 00:09:55.930 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh, yeah, right.

00:09:57.765 --> 00:09:59.900 position:7% line:89% align:start
Shinohara, hold out your hand.

00:10:00.034 --> 00:10:01.001 position:44% line:89% align:start
Here.

[HIROTO]
What is this?

00:10:03.971 --> 00:10:05.439 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's a present,

00:10:05.574 --> 00:10:08.642 position:13% line:83% align:start
or a card that allows you
to install a rare ability.

you could buy them.

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.415 position:10% line:89% align:start
Not all of them are official.

00:10:14.549 --> 00:10:17.552 position:13% line:83% align:start
Just consider it a sort of
good luck charm, all right?

00:10:17.685 --> 00:10:19.420 position:19% line:89% align:start
A good luck charm, huh?

-Thank you.
-Yeah.

you better not hesitate.

[HIROTO]
How's it going?

00:10:57.324 --> 00:11:00.995 position:13% line:83% align:start
My name's Hiroto Shinohara,
your new Seven Star.

00:11:01.128 --> 00:11:03.998 position:19% line:83% align:start
For the next two years,
one person and one person alone

00:11:04.131 --> 00:11:06.467 position:24% line:83% align:start
will reign over you
as your lord and master,

00:11:06.601 --> 00:11:08.235 position:30% line:89% align:start
and that's me.

00:11:09.803 --> 00:11:12.173 position:44% line:83% align:start
[NOA]
It's okay. You can do this.

00:11:12.306 --> 00:11:14.241 position:13% line:83% align:start
You're so cute and clever,
remember?

00:11:14.375 --> 00:11:17.912 position:10% line:83% align:start
There's no way you could lose
to a lying impostor like him.

00:11:18.547 --> 00:11:20.214 position:41% line:89% align:start
Never.

Class is over at Ouka, too.

00:11:36.897 --> 00:11:38.299 position:21% line:83% align:start
the program's passed
its final checks

00:11:38.432 --> 00:11:39.333 position:21% line:89% align:start
and is ready to use.

00:11:39.466 --> 00:11:40.434 position:38% line:89% align:start
Go nuts.

00:11:40.569 --> 00:11:41.902 position:24% line:89% align:start
Thank you, Kagaya!

00:11:42.036 --> 00:11:43.505 position:44% line:83% align:start

Could it be?

00:11:43.638 --> 00:11:45.472 position:38% line:83% align:start
[giggles]
What a coinky-dink.

00:11:45.607 --> 00:11:47.441 position:13% line:89% align:start
Fancy seeing you two here.

00:11:47.942 --> 00:11:49.810 position:30% line:83% align:start
"Coinky-dink"?
You have no shame.

00:11:49.944 --> 00:11:52.846 position:10% line:89% align:start
Huh? Don't be such a meanie!

00:11:54.248 --> 00:11:56.717 position:41% line:83% align:start
Anyway,
you're about to play a Trial

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:58.018 position:19% line:83% align:start
with your maid friend,
aren't you?

00:11:58.152 --> 00:12:00.421 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'd love to sit in and watch.

00:12:00.689 --> 00:12:01.822 position:30% line:89% align:start
Suit yourself.

00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:05.159 position:19% line:83% align:start
I was hoping we'd have
some kind of audience.

00:12:05.292 --> 00:12:06.727 position:38% line:89% align:start
[giggles]

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:11.865 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Everything's ready to go.

00:12:11.999 --> 00:12:14.201 position:27% line:83% align:start
Before we start,
I'd like to thank you

00:12:14.335 --> 00:12:17.338 position:7% line:83% align:start
for accommodating such a sudden
and selfish request.

00:12:17.771 --> 00:12:19.541 position:16% line:89% align:start
As I explained yesterday.

00:12:19.674 --> 00:12:21.475 position:38% line:83% align:start
I cannot,
under any circumstances,

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:24.812 position:30% line:83% align:start
lose this Trial
even if you're my opponent.

00:12:25.479 --> 00:12:28.550 position:35% line:83% align:start
No, rather,
it's because you're my opponent,

00:12:28.683 --> 00:12:30.417 position:16% line:89% align:start
that I mustn't lose here.

00:12:31.118 --> 00:12:33.787 position:10% line:89% align:start
As such, I'll give it my all.

00:12:34.188 --> 00:12:36.257 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:12:39.493 --> 00:12:42.796 position:33% line:83% align:start
First of all,
I use Probability Fluctuation.

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:45.132 position:21% line:83% align:start
This lets me bypass
the randomized draw,

00:12:45.266 --> 00:12:47.502 position:13% line:89% align:start
and take Set A for myself.

00:12:47.636 --> 00:12:48.869 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Right.

00:12:49.003 --> 00:12:50.237 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
And, apologies in advance,

00:12:50.371 --> 00:12:52.906 position:16% line:83% align:start
this next part may prove
a little galling.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.409 position:5% line:89% align:start
I have activated Forced Control.

00:12:55.809 --> 00:12:59.446 position:7% line:83% align:start
Oh! Hiroto, your maid-friend's
gonna have her way with you

00:12:59.581 --> 00:13:00.781 position:19% line:89% align:start
for three whole turns.

00:13:00.914 --> 00:13:02.517 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Just as I expected.

00:13:02.651 --> 00:13:03.851 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'll start with my exploits

00:13:03.984 --> 00:13:05.986 position:41% line:83% align:start
as soon
as Forced Control runs out.

00:13:13.127 --> 00:13:15.062 position:27% line:89% align:start
Great Revolution?

00:13:20.568 --> 00:13:22.570 position:21% line:89% align:start
Now then, next turn.

00:13:37.384 --> 00:13:38.419 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:13:38.553 --> 00:13:40.254 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
And now for my third turn.

00:13:40.387 --> 00:13:41.422 position:38% line:89% align:start
[giggles]

00:13:53.635 --> 00:13:54.868 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
That's weird.

00:13:55.002 --> 00:13:56.837 position:33% line:83% align:start
I still have
the Trojan Horse Commoner,

00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:59.840 position:10% line:83% align:start
the Knight, and the Assassin
left in my hand.

00:14:00.107 --> 00:14:01.442 position:13% line:89% align:start
And the way she just wasted

00:14:01.576 --> 00:14:04.211 position:33% line:83% align:start
the powerful
Undefeated Hero card like that.

00:14:04.345 --> 00:14:06.847 position:5% line:89% align:start
She's going way too easy on me.

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:08.115 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Carelessness?

00:14:08.248 --> 00:14:11.018 position:13% line:89% align:start
No, it's more like baiting.

00:14:11.151 --> 00:14:14.922 position:7% line:83% align:start
Hang on, could this whole Trial
be one big trap?

00:14:15.623 --> 00:14:16.524 position:38% line:89% align:start
So what?

00:14:16.658 --> 00:14:18.125 position:16% line:89% align:start
Defeat by way of victory?

00:14:18.258 --> 00:14:20.894 position:19% line:83% align:start
I win and something bad
happens to me?

00:14:21.161 --> 00:14:22.630 position:33% line:89% align:start
It can't be,

00:14:22.764 --> 00:14:25.099 position:13% line:83% align:start
Himeji would never throw me
to the wolves like that.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:26.867 position:41% line:89% align:start
Think.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.503 position:19% line:83% align:start
She must have given me
some kind of sign.

00:14:28.636 --> 00:14:31.405 position:13% line:83% align:start
Something that would escape
anyone's notice but mine.

00:14:31.806 --> 00:14:34.408 position:21% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI] Don't try
to win this one, master.

00:14:35.409 --> 00:14:37.878 position:10% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] She explicitly said
she can't lose,

00:14:38.011 --> 00:14:40.147 position:24% line:83% align:start
but she's obviously
not trying to win.

00:14:40.815 --> 00:14:42.416 position:10% line:89% align:start
There are 21 cards in total.

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:44.519 position:33% line:83% align:start
The ten cards
in each player's hand,

00:14:44.652 --> 00:14:46.186 position:21% line:89% align:start
plus one bonus card.

00:14:46.688 --> 00:14:49.156 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's an odd number
as to prevent a draw.

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:50.958 position:44% line:89% align:start
Odd?

00:14:51.091 --> 00:14:52.092 position:24% line:89% align:start
[gasps] That's it!

00:14:52.226 --> 00:14:54.529 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's what you were going for!

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:58.432 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KAGAYA]
Huh? Abort the operation?

00:14:58.566 --> 00:15:00.568 position:10% line:83% align:start
But I pulled an all-nighter,
man!

00:15:01.301 --> 00:15:02.903 position:13% line:89% align:start
Thanks for waiting, Himeji.

00:15:03.036 --> 00:15:04.672 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'll take my fourth turn now.

00:15:04.806 --> 00:15:08.041 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll start by activating
the Afterthought ability.

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:11.478 position:13% line:89% align:start
Right, then I'll play this.

I knew it!

00:15:22.891 --> 00:15:24.158 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:15:25.959 --> 00:15:27.494 position:5% line:89% align:start
Apologies, I was just surprised

00:15:27.629 --> 00:15:30.063 position:30% line:83% align:start
that you'd make
a silly mistake like that.

00:15:30.197 --> 00:15:33.066 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well then, I'm about
to shock you even more.

âª

00:15:52.286 --> 00:15:53.788 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hey, what are you doing?

00:15:53.922 --> 00:15:55.590 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are you playing bad on purpose?

00:15:55.723 --> 00:15:57.224 position:30% line:89% align:start
Knock that off.

00:15:57.357 --> 00:15:59.727 position:10% line:83% align:start
Simmer down, if you shut up,
you might learn something.

00:15:59.861 --> 00:16:01.028 position:41% line:89% align:start
[angry]

00:16:19.948 --> 00:16:22.049 position:24% line:89% align:start
This is end, right?

00:16:22.182 --> 00:16:23.751 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's right.

00:16:24.051 --> 00:16:25.820 position:10% line:89% align:start
Himeji's collected 15 cards.

00:16:25.954 --> 00:16:29.122 position:7% line:83% align:start
She has a Queen and an Assassin
left in her hand.

00:16:29.456 --> 00:16:31.191 position:7% line:89% align:start
All I'm holding is a Commoner.

00:16:31.325 --> 00:16:33.795 position:16% line:83% align:start
If you play the Assassin,
you win the game.

00:16:34.461 --> 00:16:36.230 position:33% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
It seems so.

00:16:37.866 --> 00:16:40.969 position:10% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] If that's Assassin,
it'll mean utter defeat for me.

00:16:41.101 --> 00:16:43.938 position:7% line:83% align:start
All of Sarasa and Kagaya's help
will have been wasted,

00:16:44.071 --> 00:16:45.439 position:16% line:89% align:start
and I'll lose everything.

00:16:45.673 --> 00:16:48.576 position:19% line:83% align:start
But, my trust in Himeji
is absolute!

00:16:49.243 --> 00:16:50.845 position:21% line:89% align:start
This isn't a battle.

00:16:50.979 --> 00:16:52.346 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's a performance

00:16:52.479 --> 00:16:55.015 position:27% line:83% align:start
designed to trick
a facetious audience of one.

00:16:55.449 --> 00:16:56.350 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right?

00:16:56.818 --> 00:16:59.152 position:21% line:83% align:start
Before the All-Campus
Elimination Battle,

00:16:59.286 --> 00:17:01.990 position:35% line:83% align:start
we came up
with our own secret phrase.

00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:05.593 position:24% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI, HIROTO]
"Yes, my Master."

00:17:06.026 --> 00:17:08.095 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
I know that's the Queen, Himeji.

00:17:08.228 --> 00:17:09.864 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
Are you certain of that?

00:17:09.998 --> 00:17:11.566 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Tell you what.

00:17:11.699 --> 00:17:14.201 position:7% line:83% align:start
If it's not, I'll share dozens
of humiliating secrets with you.

00:17:14.334 --> 00:17:15.670 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
That's unfortunate, then.

00:17:15.803 --> 00:17:18.272 position:10% line:83% align:start
I sincerely would have liked
to hear them.

00:17:18.405 --> 00:17:20.608 position:35% line:83% align:start
All of your
embarrassing secrets.

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:23.645 position:41% line:89% align:start
[angry]

00:17:23.778 --> 00:17:26.781 position:10% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] When it's a Commoner
versus a Queen, the Queen wins.

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:29.717 position:38% line:89% align:start
However,

00:17:29.851 --> 00:17:32.419 position:10% line:83% align:start
this is where my Trojan Horse
comes into play.

00:17:35.222 --> 00:17:37.057 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
Yes. As per the effect,

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:38.458 position:27% line:83% align:start
half of the cards
I have collected

00:17:38.593 --> 00:17:40.494 position:10% line:89% align:start
transfer over to you, Master.

00:17:40.628 --> 00:17:42.730 position:19% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] And now I have
collected a total of ten,

00:17:42.864 --> 00:17:44.431 position:13% line:89% align:start
with none left in my hand.

00:17:44.732 --> 00:17:47.200 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI] My final card
goes into my collection.

00:17:47.334 --> 00:17:50.004 position:19% line:83% align:start
Which means I also have
a total of ten.

00:17:50.337 --> 00:17:51.839 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
When you told me not to win,

00:17:51.973 --> 00:17:53.741 position:5% line:89% align:start
you weren't telling me to lose.

00:17:53.875 --> 00:17:56.578 position:13% line:83% align:start
You were asking me to force
a draw, right?

00:18:09.122 --> 00:18:10.490 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Noa chuckles]

00:18:11.659 --> 00:18:13.260 position:33% line:89% align:start
A draw, huh?

00:18:13.393 --> 00:18:14.562 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
Indeed.

00:18:14.696 --> 00:18:15.997 position:21% line:83% align:start
The State of Conflict
is resolved,

00:18:16.129 --> 00:18:17.331 position:27% line:83% align:start
but neither of us
lost the Trial.

00:18:17.464 --> 00:18:18.967 position:16% line:89% align:start
So, as the rules dictate,

00:18:19.099 --> 00:18:20.969 position:27% line:83% align:start
both of us remain
in the contest.

00:18:21.401 --> 00:18:22.604 position:41% line:83% align:start
[NOA]
I see.

00:18:23.337 --> 00:18:26.139 position:41% line:83% align:start
Oh, my.
Kinda tired all of a sudden.

00:18:26.273 --> 00:18:27.809 position:35% line:89% align:start
Excuse me.

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:31.378 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Wait!

00:18:31.512 --> 00:18:32.880 position:44% line:83% align:start
[NOA]
Don't you know girls hate it

00:18:33.014 --> 00:18:34.147 position:10% line:89% align:start
when you grab them like that?

00:18:34.281 --> 00:18:36.183 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
You owe me an explanation.

00:18:36.316 --> 00:18:37.585 position:44% line:83% align:start
[NOA]
About what?

00:18:37.719 --> 00:18:38.820 position:27% line:89% align:start
Don't play dumb.

00:18:38.953 --> 00:18:40.354 position:24% line:89% align:start
This wasn't random.

00:18:40.487 --> 00:18:41.856 position:21% line:83% align:start
You've been planning
to tear me down from the top

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:43.423 position:10% line:89% align:start
for a while now, haven't you?

00:18:43.558 --> 00:18:45.192 position:19% line:89% align:start
Huh? What do you mean?

00:18:45.325 --> 00:18:46.728 position:19% line:89% align:start
I was just trying to--

00:18:46.861 --> 00:18:47.895 position:21% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI] You can't
talk your way out of this.

00:18:48.261 --> 00:18:49.496 position:16% line:89% align:start
I already know, Akizuki.

00:18:49.631 --> 00:18:51.198 position:21% line:83% align:start
You installed Spying
on my Device

00:18:51.331 --> 00:18:52.834 position:10% line:89% align:start
when you found me last night.

00:18:52.967 --> 00:18:55.570 position:21% line:83% align:start
[KAGAYA] Yuck! That's
a really nasty illegal ability.

00:18:55.703 --> 00:18:57.572 position:27% line:83% align:start
All data handled
by the Device gets leaked,

00:18:57.705 --> 00:18:59.841 position:27% line:83% align:start
and it can record
and monitor stuff too.

00:18:59.974 --> 00:19:01.809 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's mega-invasive!

00:19:04.946 --> 00:19:06.047 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:19:06.547 --> 00:19:08.348 position:19% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] So that's why
you cut off all communication

00:19:08.482 --> 00:19:10.051 position:5% line:89% align:start
and said you couldn't come home.

00:19:10.183 --> 00:19:11.318 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
Yes.

00:19:11.451 --> 00:19:12.687 position:44% line:83% align:start
[NOA]
Until this time tomorrow,

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:14.088 position:30% line:83% align:start
you can't quit
the elimination battle,

00:19:14.221 --> 00:19:15.757 position:7% line:89% align:start
run away from it, or throw it.

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:17.892 position:16% line:83% align:start
And as long as you avoid
all of that,

00:19:18.026 --> 00:19:20.160 position:19% line:83% align:start
the program will delete
automatically.

00:19:20.293 --> 00:19:23.031 position:5% line:89% align:start
Do you understand, Maid-Friend?

00:19:24.098 --> 00:19:27.167 position:21% line:83% align:start
The spy program came
with a contagious subroutine.

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:28.670 position:33% line:89% align:start
It was set up

00:19:28.803 --> 00:19:30.038 position:21% line:83% align:start
so that if the owner
of the Device lost a game,

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:31.572 position:7% line:89% align:start
it would move to the winner's.

00:19:31.706 --> 00:19:33.074 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
That's horrifying!

00:19:33.206 --> 00:19:34.241 position:30% line:89% align:start
Thanks, Himeji.

00:19:34.374 --> 00:19:35.510 position:35% line:89% align:start
Nice save!

00:19:35.643 --> 00:19:37.045 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
I've had the chance

00:19:37.177 --> 00:19:38.613 position:35% line:83% align:start
to back up
last night's access logs.

00:19:38.746 --> 00:19:40.480 position:19% line:83% align:start
You incorrectly thought
Display Bug would mask it.

00:19:40.615 --> 00:19:42.884 position:27% line:83% align:start
But in the hands
of Headmistress Ichinose,

00:19:43.017 --> 00:19:45.153 position:19% line:83% align:start
the source of the hack
can be located.

00:19:45.385 --> 00:19:46.854 position:44% line:83% align:start
[NOA]
Why you?

00:19:47.789 --> 00:19:48.790 position:38% line:89% align:start
Why you?

00:19:48.923 --> 00:19:50.091 position:30% line:89% align:start
Why is it you?

00:19:50.223 --> 00:19:52.426 position:24% line:83% align:start
[metal table slams]
Why? Why? Why?

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:53.761 position:24% line:89% align:start
It makes no sense!

00:19:53.895 --> 00:19:55.797 position:27% line:83% align:start
I worked so hard
to set all of this up!

00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:57.665 position:19% line:83% align:start
How could you possibly
still win?

00:19:57.799 --> 00:20:00.835 position:21% line:83% align:start
Where's the justice?
The fairness?

00:20:01.069 --> 00:20:02.369 position:16% line:89% align:start
You used lies and tricks

00:20:02.503 --> 00:20:04.739 position:27% line:83% align:start
to push your way
to the front of the line!

00:20:05.272 --> 00:20:06.874 position:16% line:89% align:start
What do you mean by that?

00:20:07.008 --> 00:20:09.844 position:10% line:83% align:start
Becoming a Seven Star as soon
as you got to Academy Island?

00:20:09.977 --> 00:20:11.344 position:30% line:89% align:start
There's no way!

00:20:11.478 --> 00:20:13.614 position:10% line:83% align:start
I really, really can't stand
people who cheat!

00:20:13.748 --> 00:20:15.783 position:33% line:83% align:start
You remember
what I told you before?

00:20:15.917 --> 00:20:18.218 position:27% line:83% align:start
About the survey
for the Elimination Battle?

00:20:18.351 --> 00:20:19.854 position:24% line:83% align:start
How you were listed
so much higher

00:20:19.987 --> 00:20:20.988 position:21% line:89% align:start
than the rest of us?

00:20:21.122 --> 00:20:22.623 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Uh, yeah.

00:20:23.323 --> 00:20:24.792 position:44% line:83% align:start
[NOA]
You know, there was a poll

00:20:24.926 --> 00:20:26.861 position:30% line:83% align:start
just like that
at the closing ceremony.

00:20:26.994 --> 00:20:29.964 position:10% line:83% align:start
They asked, "Who do you think
will be the school's ace?"

00:20:30.098 --> 00:20:30.965 position:30% line:89% align:start
And it was me!

00:20:31.099 --> 00:20:32.600 position:27% line:89% align:start
I was number one.

00:20:32.867 --> 00:20:34.401 position:30% line:83% align:start
But the second
you transferred in,

00:20:34.535 --> 00:20:36.037 position:27% line:89% align:start
I became nothing.

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:37.972 position:13% line:83% align:start
Everyone turned their backs
on me and flocked to you.

00:20:38.106 --> 00:20:40.240 position:21% line:89% align:start
The shiny new thing!

00:20:40.474 --> 00:20:42.543 position:5% line:83% align:start
I spent years working my fingers
to the bone,

00:20:42.677 --> 00:20:44.512 position:13% line:89% align:start
trying to build myself up.

00:20:44.946 --> 00:20:46.781 position:21% line:83% align:start
And then you show up
out of nowhere

00:20:46.914 --> 00:20:47.949 position:24% line:89% align:start
and I lose it all?

00:20:48.082 --> 00:20:49.150 position:30% line:89% align:start
Just like that?

00:20:49.282 --> 00:20:50.752 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KAGAYA]
Whew, false alarm.

00:20:50.885 --> 00:20:53.755 position:7% line:83% align:start
No evidence of our shenanigans
after all, folks.

00:20:54.287 --> 00:20:55.556 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
But, it's true.

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:58.391 position:24% line:83% align:start
She worked so hard,
and I just cheated.

00:20:58.993 --> 00:21:00.661 position:33% line:83% align:start
So I thought,
the least I could do

00:21:00.795 --> 00:21:02.530 position:13% line:89% align:start
is take something from you.

00:21:02.663 --> 00:21:04.732 position:27% line:83% align:start
And without your
indispensable Maid Friend,

00:21:04.866 --> 00:21:07.201 position:21% line:83% align:start
you wouldn't be able
to fight so well.

00:21:07.334 --> 00:21:08.736 position:16% line:89% align:start
So I came up with a plan

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:11.506 position:30% line:83% align:start
that would have
the two of you face each other.

00:21:11.873 --> 00:21:15.643 position:21% line:83% align:start
Man, and the trouble
I went through to set it up.

00:21:15.777 --> 00:21:17.612 position:16% line:83% align:start
I even had to make a deal
with the devi--

00:21:17.745 --> 00:21:18.713 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:21:19.547 --> 00:21:21.916 position:27% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] I think
we've discovered our mastermind.

00:21:22.049 --> 00:21:23.416 position:24% line:89% align:start
Akizuki's talented.

00:21:23.785 --> 00:21:26.053 position:10% line:83% align:start
But no student would be able
to put all this together

00:21:26.187 --> 00:21:27.420 position:13% line:89% align:start
without some serious help.

00:21:28.055 --> 00:21:29.657 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well, your plan's hit
a brick wall.

00:21:29.791 --> 00:21:31.959 position:24% line:83% align:start
So why not tell us
what you know?

00:21:32.994 --> 00:21:34.128 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:21:34.262 --> 00:21:35.462 position:13% line:89% align:start
What are you talking about?

00:21:35.596 --> 00:21:36.864 position:13% line:89% align:start
You think this is the end?

00:21:36.998 --> 00:21:39.767 position:5% line:83% align:start
That I'll just quietly roll over
and take it?

00:21:39.901 --> 00:21:41.035 position:30% line:89% align:start
[both shocked]

00:21:41.169 --> 00:21:42.837 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm way too cute and clever
to throw myself

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:45.106 position:16% line:83% align:start
into something like this
without a backup plan

00:21:45.239 --> 00:21:46.741 position:10% line:89% align:start
for when things go sideways.

00:21:46.874 --> 00:21:49.243 position:10% line:83% align:start
See, the ability I installed
on the maid's Device

00:21:49.376 --> 00:21:51.078 position:21% line:89% align:start
works in two stages.

00:21:51.344 --> 00:21:52.547 position:21% line:89% align:start
When, for any reason,

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.248 position:30% line:83% align:start
the main skill
'Spying' deactivates,

00:21:54.381 --> 00:21:57.151 position:10% line:83% align:start
another skill surreptitiously
activates in the background.

00:21:57.285 --> 00:21:58.553 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Another?

00:21:58.686 --> 00:22:00.988 position:35% line:83% align:start
[NOA] Yeah.
It's called Destructive Impulse.

00:22:01.122 --> 00:22:03.090 position:13% line:83% align:start
It smashes all of the data
on that Device

00:22:03.224 --> 00:22:05.358 position:21% line:83% align:start
into itty bitty bits
and broken little bytes.

00:22:05.492 --> 00:22:07.195 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's a real killer ability.

00:22:07.327 --> 00:22:10.231 position:16% line:23% align:start
All I have to do is push
the activation button here,

00:22:10.363 --> 00:22:11.632 position:10% line:35% align:start
and your maid friend's Device

00:22:11.766 --> 00:22:13.500 position:44% line:23% align:start
turns
into a glorified paper-weight.

your poor little Maid

00:22:56.344 --> 00:22:59.146 position:10% line:89% align:start
Now, I can't go back anymore.

[HIROTO]
"That devil"?

00:23:01.949 --> 00:23:03.618 position:13% line:89% align:start
Who the hell does she mean?

00:23:03.751 --> 00:23:05.219 position:16% line:89% align:start
No, one thing at a time.

00:23:05.353 --> 00:23:06.654 position:44% line:17% align:start
[NOA]
So, if you want me

00:23:06.787 --> 00:23:08.222 position:30% line:17% align:start
to return your
little maid friend here,

00:23:08.356 --> 00:23:10.423 position:19% line:17% align:start
then just be a good boy
and lose to me, okay?

00:23:10.558 --> 00:23:13.794 position:7% line:5% align:start
Hand over your stars right now
and throw yourself at my feet.

00:23:13.928 --> 00:23:15.863 position:30% line:5% align:start
Kneel before me
in front of everybody,

00:23:15.997 --> 00:23:18.299 position:21% line:35% align:start
declaring I'm the one
and only true Seven Star,

00:23:18.431 --> 00:23:20.234 position:21% line:35% align:start
and all of your sins
will be forgiven.

00:23:20.368 --> 00:23:21.836 position:16% line:47% align:start
Doesn't that sound right?

00:23:21.969 --> 00:23:24.572 position:7% line:83% align:start
Because I know that everything
about you is a lie.

00:23:24.705 --> 00:23:26.674 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Something's seriously wrong.

00:23:26.807 --> 00:23:28.576 position:13% line:89% align:start
She knows too much but how?

00:23:28.709 --> 00:23:30.144 position:24% line:89% align:start
All I can think of

00:23:30.278 --> 00:23:33.381 position:16% line:83% align:start
is the stolen Green Star
that enhances perception!

00:23:33.514 --> 00:23:34.782 position:38% line:89% align:start
[giggles]

00:23:34.916 --> 00:23:36.416 position:35% line:83% align:start
Don't think
I'm gonna let you cheap out

00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:38.219 position:7% line:89% align:start
with a pitiful draw this time.

00:23:38.352 --> 00:23:41.222 position:19% line:83% align:start
We'll fight one last,
decisive battle, yeah?

00:23:41.355 --> 00:23:43.357 position:16% line:83% align:start
Tabletop Treasure Hunt's
the game.

00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:44.725 position:35% line:89% align:start
Sound good?

00:23:44.859 --> 00:23:46.661 position:10% line:53% align:start
Then let's get this started,
shall we?
