00:00:10.979 --> 00:00:13.447 position:16% line:83% align:start
Are you filming something
for the others again?

00:00:13.581 --> 00:00:14.883 position:35% line:89% align:start
[ALL sigh]

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:16.450 position:24% line:83% align:start
[FEMALE STUDENT 1]
Ah, welcome back.

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:19.253 position:19% line:83% align:start
Checked out that base,
it's clear.

00:00:20.087 --> 00:00:21.956 position:10% line:83% align:start
[MALE STUDENT 1] Wanna split
up the spells that just dropped

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:23.423 position:21% line:89% align:start
before we go take it?

00:00:23.558 --> 00:00:24.191 position:33% line:89% align:start
Sounds good.

00:00:24.324 --> 00:00:25.793 position:21% line:89% align:start
Dibs on Sword flash.

00:00:25.927 --> 00:00:27.127 position:47% line:89% align:start
Uh!

00:00:27.261 --> 00:00:28.663 position:41% line:89% align:start
[beeps]

00:00:28.796 --> 00:00:31.900 position:21% line:83% align:start
-It's a battle-lock!
-But, we're not in a fight!

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:33.935 position:19% line:89% align:start
I wouldn't be so sure.

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:35.402 position:27% line:83% align:start
[MALE STUDENT 2]
Some kind of trap?

00:00:35.537 --> 00:00:38.438 position:27% line:83% align:start
[MALE STUDENT 1]
Hmm! Hey. Easy!

00:00:38.573 --> 00:00:39.674 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.475 position:27% line:83% align:start
[MALE STUDENT 2]
Why're you?

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:44.111 position:24% line:89% align:start
What the hell, man?

00:00:44.244 --> 00:00:46.413 position:38% line:89% align:start
[screams]

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.285 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hey. Are all you boys
and girls out there

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:53.320 position:5% line:89% align:start
ready for the real fun to begin?

00:02:24.812 --> 00:02:26.047 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hey, there.

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:28.382 position:19% line:83% align:start
Are you boys and girls
ready for the real fun to begin?

00:02:28.916 --> 00:02:31.019 position:33% line:83% align:start
This footage
is from the end of day two.

00:02:31.184 --> 00:02:33.888 position:7% line:83% align:start
For some reason it hasn't been
archived on Libra.

00:02:34.022 --> 00:02:36.824 position:21% line:83% align:start
But it's spread among
the students all the same.

00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:37.959 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:40.662 position:27% line:83% align:start
That does explain
the weird mood today.

00:02:40.795 --> 00:02:43.031 position:7% line:83% align:start
Guess that means Saionji isn't
the only person

00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:44.799 position:27% line:83% align:start
the doppelganger
can impersonate.

00:02:44.932 --> 00:02:46.233 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SUZURAN]
Impossible!

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:48.670 position:10% line:83% align:start
What we're seeing right meow
is unprecedented!

00:02:49.804 --> 00:02:52.940 position:13% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Wait, am I crazy,
or is that a different image?

00:02:53.074 --> 00:02:55.677 position:16% line:83% align:start
For that matter, why does
Kazami sound so out of it?

00:02:56.711 --> 00:02:57.444 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm!

00:02:57.578 --> 00:02:58.746 position:10% line:89% align:start
First, we need to figure out

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.414 position:21% line:83% align:start
how this doppelganger
thing works.

00:03:00.548 --> 00:03:03.885 position:21% line:83% align:start
Mmm-mmm! I have been
wondering, what is she?

00:03:04.552 --> 00:03:06.921 position:7% line:83% align:start
Well, she burst onto the scene,
guns blazing,

00:03:07.055 --> 00:03:08.523 position:5% line:89% align:start
claiming to be the true Empress.

00:03:08.656 --> 00:03:10.257 position:10% line:89% align:start
But it looks like in reality,

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.392 position:10% line:83% align:start
she can assume the appearance
of anyone she wants in ASTRAL.

00:03:12.527 --> 00:03:14.595 position:21% line:83% align:start
What? Then she could
just transform herself

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:16.363 position:7% line:89% align:start
into any one of us and strike?

00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:17.932 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Ha!
-Hmm!

00:03:18.066 --> 00:03:21.102 position:10% line:83% align:start
Truly. Preventative measures
will be crucial to us

00:03:21.234 --> 00:03:22.637 position:30% line:89% align:start
going forward.

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.404 position:24% line:83% align:start
So, you're saying,
don't give her the opportunity

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:25.807 position:16% line:89% align:start
to body-snatch us, right?

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.709 position:13% line:83% align:start
There's a couple of things
we can do,

00:03:27.842 --> 00:03:30.645 position:7% line:83% align:start
but the most important is that
we keep each other in sight.

00:03:30.778 --> 00:03:32.446 position:16% line:83% align:start
To that end, we should be
travelling in groups

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.281 position:21% line:89% align:start
of no fewer than two.

00:03:34.414 --> 00:03:35.215 position:35% line:89% align:start
That clear?

00:03:35.348 --> 00:03:37.552 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yes, reasonable.

00:03:37.685 --> 00:03:40.353 position:5% line:83% align:start
Providing no one goes carelessly
running off by themselves,

00:03:40.487 --> 00:03:41.823 position:21% line:89% align:start
that should work out.

00:03:41.956 --> 00:03:43.223 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:03:43.356 --> 00:03:44.859 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:03:46.928 --> 00:03:49.931 position:16% line:89% align:start
Aah! Go! Inferno Strike!

00:03:50.064 --> 00:03:53.735 position:13% line:89% align:start
What the... Aw, lost again.

00:03:53.868 --> 00:03:55.069 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hey, it's two a.m.

00:03:55.203 --> 00:03:58.238 position:16% line:83% align:start
[chuckles] But I've been
having so much fun, though!

00:03:58.371 --> 00:04:00.742 position:16% line:83% align:start
I've been bored senseless
for ages!

00:04:00.875 --> 00:04:04.377 position:13% line:83% align:start
So an all-day gaming binge
is exactly what I needed!

00:04:04.512 --> 00:04:06.013 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Hm! All day?

00:04:06.681 --> 00:04:09.050 position:7% line:83% align:start
Don't you have to go to school
in the morning or something?

00:04:09.183 --> 00:04:10.918 position:27% line:89% align:start
Ah! Why would I?

00:04:11.052 --> 00:04:13.187 position:13% line:83% align:start
If I went outside I'd have
to talk to dull strangers

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.589 position:35% line:89% align:start
and stuff.

00:04:14.722 --> 00:04:16.858 position:13% line:83% align:start
So I'd rather just stay in
and enjoy myself!

00:04:16.991 --> 00:04:19.060 position:16% line:83% align:start
You don't have a problem
talking to me.

00:04:19.193 --> 00:04:20.795 position:7% line:89% align:start
Yeah! But that isn't the same!

00:04:20.928 --> 00:04:23.363 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're special, mister,
and I like you!

00:04:23.497 --> 00:04:25.298 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.269 position:38% line:89% align:start
[snores]

00:04:30.071 --> 00:04:31.739 position:19% line:89% align:start
Hey, I'm not a pillow.

00:04:33.608 --> 00:04:35.475 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
I really should get going.

00:04:39.346 --> 00:04:40.548 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm!

00:04:40.681 --> 00:04:41.983 position:38% line:89% align:start
[knocks]

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:44.152 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SARASA]
Who is it?

00:04:44.317 --> 00:04:45.720 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's me. Your accomplice.

00:04:45.853 --> 00:04:47.822 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SARASA]
Uh! Give me ten minutes!

00:04:47.955 --> 00:04:51.192 position:24% line:83% align:start
What? Ten minutes?
That's way too long.

00:04:51.324 --> 00:04:54.962 position:21% line:83% align:start
[SARASA] Fine! Five!
Five minutes! Just, wait there!

00:04:55.096 --> 00:04:56.864 position:21% line:89% align:start
Out here in the hall?

00:04:56.998 --> 00:04:57.999 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hmm-mm!

00:05:00.501 --> 00:05:02.837 position:33% line:83% align:start
-[door opens]
-Come in.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.071 position:44% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:05:07.975 --> 00:05:09.376 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.280 position:7% line:83% align:start
[SARASA] Hey, it's just a room.
Quit looking around so much.

00:05:12.412 --> 00:05:13.848 position:35% line:89% align:start
Mm! Right.

00:05:13.981 --> 00:05:16.416 position:19% line:83% align:start
Huh! That doesn't mean
you should stare at me, instead!

00:05:16.551 --> 00:05:18.619 position:33% line:83% align:start
Then where am
I supposed to look?

00:05:18.753 --> 00:05:19.887 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SARASA]
Why not out there?

00:05:20.021 --> 00:05:21.589 position:27% line:83% align:start
At all the lovely
glittering lights!

00:05:21.722 --> 00:05:22.890 position:21% line:89% align:start
Pretty, aren't they?

00:05:23.858 --> 00:05:25.092 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Can you imagine the headlines

00:05:25.226 --> 00:05:26.326 position:19% line:89% align:start
if anyone saw me here?

00:05:26.994 --> 00:05:29.496 position:16% line:83% align:start
"Passionate Love Between
Seven Star Transfer Student

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.032 position:10% line:89% align:start
and Genius Princess exposed."

00:05:31.165 --> 00:05:34.334 position:16% line:83% align:start
Ew! "P-passionate love"?
Don't be such a dummy!

00:05:34.467 --> 00:05:37.404 position:7% line:83% align:start
Anyone with half a brain knows
that I'm way out of your league!

00:05:38.005 --> 00:05:39.640 position:35% line:83% align:start
Do you mind
if I at least sit down?

00:05:39.774 --> 00:05:41.742 position:21% line:83% align:start
I actually came here
to talk to you.

00:05:42.643 --> 00:05:44.045 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's about the doppelganger.

00:05:44.178 --> 00:05:46.647 position:13% line:83% align:start
Uh! That's not surprising,
everything

00:05:46.781 --> 00:05:48.149 position:16% line:89% align:start
is about her these days.

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:50.785 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's honestly kind
of exhausting,

00:05:50.918 --> 00:05:53.187 position:7% line:83% align:start
having to watch someone hijack
your appearance

00:05:53.321 --> 00:05:54.755 position:27% line:89% align:start
to get attention.

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:57.091 position:21% line:83% align:start
It doesn't help that
she's such a charismatic diva.

00:05:57.225 --> 00:06:00.228 position:7% line:83% align:start
You'd think there'd be more of
an outcry over identity theft.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.796 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Society's weird.

00:06:01.929 --> 00:06:04.364 position:5% line:83% align:start
They've already taken to calling
her "Miss Hundred Faces."

00:06:04.497 --> 00:06:05.533 position:38% line:89% align:start
It's bad.

00:06:05.666 --> 00:06:06.801 position:16% line:89% align:start
People are gonna develop

00:06:06.934 --> 00:06:09.136 position:33% line:83% align:start
trust issues
real fast over this.

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.973 position:21% line:83% align:start
Some teams might even
self-destruct out of suspicion.

00:06:12.106 --> 00:06:14.308 position:21% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Really wish
I could disagree with that.

00:06:14.441 --> 00:06:15.910 position:19% line:89% align:start
But I know for a fact,

00:06:16.043 --> 00:06:18.279 position:33% line:83% align:start
my own team's
a prime candidate for implosion.

00:06:18.411 --> 00:06:22.250 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's rough, but then,
so is having one day to take out

00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:23.751 position:21% line:89% align:start
two more commanders,

00:06:23.885 --> 00:06:25.452 position:7% line:83% align:start
under imminent threat of losing
my leadership.

00:06:25.586 --> 00:06:26.854 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SARASA]
Oh! You have what?

00:06:26.988 --> 00:06:29.456 position:16% line:83% align:start
How the heck are you not
freaking out about this?

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:30.925 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Hey, don't worry,

00:06:31.058 --> 00:06:32.660 position:7% line:83% align:start
it's not like I'm underprepared
or anything.

00:06:32.793 --> 00:06:35.897 position:24% line:83% align:start
So, does that mean
you've got some kind of plan?

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:37.298 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
I do.

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.966 position:21% line:83% align:start
In fact, that's kinda
the whole reason I snuck over

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:40.001 position:30% line:89% align:start
to talk to you.

00:06:40.835 --> 00:06:43.104 position:13% line:83% align:start
I've got a way to dominate
this competition,

00:06:43.237 --> 00:06:46.073 position:10% line:83% align:start
even with Miss Hundred Faces
in the way.

00:06:46.207 --> 00:06:47.909 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:06:48.843 --> 00:06:50.311 position:27% line:83% align:start
[MALE STUDENT 3]
We need to take more bases.

00:06:50.443 --> 00:06:52.046 position:19% line:83% align:start
[MALE STUDENT 4] Look,
let's just grab this one first

00:06:52.179 --> 00:06:53.281 position:16% line:89% align:start
and then we can readjust.

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:55.415 position:27% line:83% align:start
[MALE STUDENT 5]
Yeah, sure. Huh!

00:06:55.549 --> 00:06:57.417 position:38% line:89% align:start
[screams]

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:04.659 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Hey, come on, man!
-Don't do this!

00:07:05.492 --> 00:07:09.163 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:07:23.878 --> 00:07:26.414 position:35% line:83% align:start
Slow down,
Nanase, you're too far ahead.

00:07:26.547 --> 00:07:27.882 position:7% line:89% align:start
You can still see me can't you?

00:07:28.015 --> 00:07:29.817 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm just doing my job
as the team's Soldier

00:07:29.951 --> 00:07:31.252 position:7% line:89% align:start
and leading the way, all right?

00:07:31.385 --> 00:07:33.754 position:16% line:83% align:start
You not being in my line
of sight isn't the issue,

00:07:33.888 --> 00:07:35.556 position:21% line:83% align:start
it's that once again
you're being careless.

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:37.224 position:13% line:83% align:start
[NANASE] Nothing's stopping
you from walking faster y'know?

00:07:37.358 --> 00:07:38.659 position:27% line:89% align:start
How troublesome.

00:07:38.793 --> 00:07:40.561 position:21% line:83% align:start
If you wish, master,
I could try to intervene.

00:07:40.695 --> 00:07:43.331 position:7% line:89% align:start
Ah, no. I should do it myself.

00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:46.934 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[howling]
-What the...?

00:07:49.136 --> 00:07:52.740 position:27% line:89% align:start
Uh! What is this?

00:07:52.873 --> 00:07:54.275 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KAGAYA]
Watch it, Hiro!

00:07:54.408 --> 00:07:56.544 position:30% line:83% align:start
This's gotta be
that crazy ability, 'Blackout'!

00:07:56.677 --> 00:07:59.113 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Not good! I can't see a thing!

00:07:59.246 --> 00:08:00.881 position:30% line:83% align:start
How will I know
if someone got replaced?

00:08:01.015 --> 00:08:02.717 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHINJI]
Answer me quickly, Nanase!

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:05.386 position:10% line:83% align:start
What was the gift you got me
for my birthday last year?

00:08:05.987 --> 00:08:08.356 position:13% line:83% align:start
[NANASE] Huh! I don't know,
that was ages ago!

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:11.491 position:19% line:83% align:start
Why? Are you suggesting
I'm Miss Hundred Faces?

00:08:11.625 --> 00:08:13.594 position:35% line:83% align:start
Just answer
the question, would you?

00:08:13.728 --> 00:08:15.329 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's still me, you dolt!

00:08:15.463 --> 00:08:17.999 position:7% line:83% align:start
But with the way you're acting,
how can we be sure it's you?

00:08:18.132 --> 00:08:21.502 position:27% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Oh, man,
this is bad. What do I do? Huh!

00:08:21.635 --> 00:08:23.804 position:38% line:89% align:start
[beeping]

00:08:26.574 --> 00:08:27.908 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh!

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:31.045 position:21% line:83% align:start
[SHINJI] Hey, Nanase,
where are you going?

00:08:31.178 --> 00:08:31.879 position:24% line:89% align:start
We've still got...

00:08:32.013 --> 00:08:33.114 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NANASE]
No, we don't!

00:08:33.247 --> 00:08:34.615 position:38% line:83% align:start
I'm done
with your second-guessing.

00:08:34.749 --> 00:08:37.118 position:27% line:83% align:start
So, just go ahead
and play without me!

00:08:37.251 --> 00:08:39.920 position:24% line:89% align:start
What? Wait, Nanase!

00:08:40.054 --> 00:08:43.190 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:08:43.324 --> 00:08:46.861 position:35% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry.
I need to go clear my head.

00:08:46.994 --> 00:08:50.264 position:21% line:83% align:start
Nanase and I probably
shouldn't play this afternoon.

00:08:50.398 --> 00:08:54.335 position:19% line:83% align:start
No. I think we probably
shouldn't play at all.

00:08:54.468 --> 00:08:55.603 position:24% line:89% align:start
You're backing out?

00:08:55.736 --> 00:08:56.871 position:30% line:83% align:start
But what about
the leadership bet

00:08:57.004 --> 00:08:58.672 position:13% line:89% align:start
you have going with Master?

00:08:58.806 --> 00:09:00.241 position:30% line:89% align:start
Right, the bet.

00:09:00.374 --> 00:09:02.810 position:10% line:83% align:start
Look, let's just say I wasn't
cut out for the position

00:09:02.943 --> 00:09:04.812 position:33% line:83% align:start
to begin with
and leave it at that.

00:09:04.945 --> 00:09:06.680 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:09:06.814 --> 00:09:08.482 position:21% line:89% align:start
Man, so high-strung.

00:09:08.616 --> 00:09:11.285 position:10% line:83% align:start
Would it kill them both to be
a little more easy-going?

00:09:11.419 --> 00:09:13.587 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:09:16.424 --> 00:09:18.893 position:38% line:89% align:start
[beeping]

00:09:19.827 --> 00:09:21.028 position:30% line:89% align:start
No-shows, huh?

00:09:21.162 --> 00:09:22.763 position:33% line:83% align:start
Can't believe
they actually sat out.

00:09:22.897 --> 00:09:25.733 position:21% line:83% align:start
Players can't join a
game session once it's underway.

00:09:25.866 --> 00:09:29.003 position:7% line:83% align:start
The earliest they can rejoin us
will be tomorrow.

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:31.005 position:27% line:89% align:start
Well, it's done.

00:09:31.138 --> 00:09:33.240 position:13% line:83% align:start
The best we can do is carry
on as discussed

00:09:33.374 --> 00:09:35.109 position:16% line:89% align:start
and see this through. Hm!

00:09:35.242 --> 00:09:37.211 position:33% line:83% align:start
[KAGAYA] Hey,
I know you only just started,

00:09:37.344 --> 00:09:38.846 position:19% line:89% align:start
but you're surrounded!

00:09:39.847 --> 00:09:41.282 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Himeji! Akizuki!

00:09:41.415 --> 00:09:43.552 position:13% line:83% align:start
We've got two teams inbound
from the north and south!

00:09:43.684 --> 00:09:44.985 position:13% line:89% align:start
We're about to be flanked!

00:09:45.119 --> 00:09:46.387 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uh-oh.

00:09:46.521 --> 00:09:48.155 position:19% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] I'd wager that
the person who used Blackout

00:09:48.289 --> 00:09:49.457 position:16% line:89% align:start
is on one of those teams.

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:52.827 position:13% line:83% align:start
Uh-ah! Just when it starts
to feel like a date,

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.429 position:21% line:89% align:start
it gets ruined! Man.

00:09:55.564 --> 00:09:56.797 position:19% line:89% align:start
While I don't much mind

00:09:56.931 --> 00:09:58.499 position:30% line:83% align:start
the dispelling
of your delusions part,

00:09:58.632 --> 00:10:00.868 position:24% line:83% align:start
I very much do mind
being flanked.

00:10:01.001 --> 00:10:03.037 position:24% line:83% align:start
If their intention
with the ambush this morning

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:04.138 position:27% line:89% align:start
was to divide us,

00:10:04.271 --> 00:10:06.307 position:21% line:83% align:start
they'll be coming in
for the kill.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.741 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yeah, that makes sense.

00:10:07.875 --> 00:10:09.910 position:7% line:89% align:start
Huh, will our plan really work?

00:10:10.044 --> 00:10:12.146 position:10% line:83% align:start
Not that I'm at all doubting
our abilities.

00:10:12.279 --> 00:10:15.182 position:7% line:83% align:start
I mean, you and I are the most
powerful power couple out there,

00:10:15.316 --> 00:10:18.319 position:10% line:83% align:start
and as third wheels go, your
maid friend is kinda useful.

00:10:18.819 --> 00:10:20.421 position:16% line:89% align:start
But maybe we should run.

00:10:20.555 --> 00:10:23.090 position:7% line:83% align:start
Her attribution of third-wheel
status is clearly mis-assigned,

00:10:23.224 --> 00:10:25.259 position:24% line:83% align:start
though her concerns
are not unfounded.

00:10:25.392 --> 00:10:27.862 position:35% line:83% align:start
It's true,
the odds are against us here

00:10:27.995 --> 00:10:30.064 position:5% line:89% align:start
but I think I've got the answer.

00:10:30.599 --> 00:10:33.400 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:10:37.438 --> 00:10:40.407 position:16% line:83% align:start
[KURURUGI] Hmm! So, fate
brings us together again.

00:10:40.542 --> 00:10:41.909 position:24% line:89% align:start
Mister Seven Star.

00:10:42.042 --> 00:10:44.211 position:19% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Why'd it have
to be the Demon Maiden?

00:10:44.345 --> 00:10:46.180 position:41% line:83% align:start
Sorry,
that we're a couple of short.

00:10:46.313 --> 00:10:48.649 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'd been hoping to face you
with a full team.

00:10:48.782 --> 00:10:50.084 position:21% line:89% align:start
No need to apologize.

00:10:50.217 --> 00:10:52.486 position:19% line:83% align:start
After all, I'm the one
who set the stage

00:10:52.621 --> 00:10:53.988 position:7% line:89% align:start
for that dramatic spat earlier.

00:10:54.121 --> 00:10:56.824 position:44% line:83% align:start
Huh!
You're just freely admitting it?

00:10:56.957 --> 00:10:58.926 position:24% line:83% align:start
Not as strait-laced
as you seem, huh?

00:10:59.059 --> 00:11:01.095 position:7% line:89% align:start
The time's come to say goodbye.

00:11:01.228 --> 00:11:04.098 position:41% line:83% align:start
Master.
We'll leave the Demon to you.

00:11:04.231 --> 00:11:05.634 position:35% line:89% align:start
[BOTH gasp]

00:11:05.766 --> 00:11:09.336 position:7% line:83% align:start
-Ah! Why're they coming at us?
-Um! Maybe we should split up!

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:10.938 position:38% line:89% align:start
[panting]

00:11:11.071 --> 00:11:13.040 position:35% line:83% align:start
[KURURUGI]
You must have a death wish.

00:11:13.174 --> 00:11:15.843 position:24% line:83% align:start
Do you really think
you can face me on your own?

00:11:16.477 --> 00:11:17.745 position:33% line:89% align:start
Just hold it!

00:11:17.878 --> 00:11:20.014 position:24% line:83% align:start
There's one of you,
and five of us.

00:11:20.147 --> 00:11:22.850 position:13% line:83% align:start
You're outnumbered by both
bodies and spells.

00:11:22.983 --> 00:11:24.451 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's hopeless,

00:11:24.586 --> 00:11:27.021 position:10% line:83% align:start
even if you are the strongest
player on the island.

00:11:28.189 --> 00:11:29.757 position:7% line:89% align:start
You've got numbers, all right.

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:33.628 position:13% line:83% align:start
But quantity will always be
a poor substitute for quality.

00:11:33.761 --> 00:11:35.829 position:38% line:89% align:start
[screams]

00:11:36.697 --> 00:11:38.365 position:35% line:83% align:start
[KURURUGI]
What? But how did he?

00:11:38.499 --> 00:11:40.067 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm!

00:11:40.201 --> 00:11:41.536 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uh-ah!

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:44.205 position:38% line:89% align:start
[screams]

00:11:50.044 --> 00:11:51.478 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Well, that's one down.

00:11:51.613 --> 00:11:54.882 position:13% line:83% align:start
Magic Blast's no joke, huh?
That was your Spy, right?

00:11:55.015 --> 00:11:58.185 position:41% line:83% align:start
[gasps]
You're gonna pay for that!

00:11:59.621 --> 00:12:02.022 position:13% line:83% align:start
At your service as always,
Master Shinohara.

00:12:02.156 --> 00:12:04.291 position:35% line:83% align:start
Good work,
that was perfect, Himeji.

00:12:04.425 --> 00:12:05.726 position:38% line:89% align:start
[giggles]

00:12:05.859 --> 00:12:07.294 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KAGAYA]
Good old misdirection!

00:12:07.428 --> 00:12:09.797 position:19% line:83% align:start
They think Shirayuki's
gone off with Noa, and then bam!

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:11.098 position:27% line:89% align:start
Surprise attack!

00:12:11.232 --> 00:12:12.601 position:44% line:89% align:start
Argh!

00:12:12.733 --> 00:12:14.703 position:7% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Question is, was that
enough to disrupt the conditions

00:12:14.835 --> 00:12:16.470 position:19% line:89% align:start
for her One-Shot Kill?

00:12:16.605 --> 00:12:17.838 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah!

00:12:17.972 --> 00:12:19.574 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
Master, look out!

00:12:19.708 --> 00:12:21.108 position:35% line:89% align:start
[shatters]

00:12:21.242 --> 00:12:24.111 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Aah!
-[shatters]

00:12:24.245 --> 00:12:27.214 position:7% line:83% align:start
That paltry barrier's the only
reason you're still here.

00:12:27.781 --> 00:12:30.284 position:13% line:83% align:start
Even with it that took off
most of your life points!

00:12:30.417 --> 00:12:33.120 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Come on. Retreat!
-Right!

00:12:33.254 --> 00:12:35.089 position:38% line:89% align:start
[panting]

00:12:35.222 --> 00:12:37.157 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:12:37.891 --> 00:12:39.460 position:35% line:83% align:start
[KURURUGI]
What is this?

00:12:39.594 --> 00:12:40.695 position:35% line:89% align:start
[BOTH sigh]

00:12:40.828 --> 00:12:42.029 position:35% line:83% align:start
[KURURUGI]
The audacity!

00:12:42.162 --> 00:12:43.430 position:24% line:89% align:start
A counteract spell?

00:12:43.565 --> 00:12:46.601 position:16% line:83% align:start
What? Trying to leverage
the playing field bonus?

00:12:46.735 --> 00:12:48.536 position:10% line:89% align:start
Yeah? Is that what you think?

00:12:49.036 --> 00:12:50.437 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
The distraction's working,

00:12:50.871 --> 00:12:52.239 position:10% line:89% align:start
but we can't get complacent.

00:12:52.373 --> 00:12:55.042 position:13% line:83% align:start
The Maiden's One-Shot Kill
isn't disarmed yet.

00:12:55.677 --> 00:12:57.011 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
I've got an idea!

00:12:57.144 --> 00:12:59.413 position:16% line:83% align:start
I might have a way for us
to even things out.

00:12:59.547 --> 00:13:02.783 position:7% line:83% align:start
If we can make it work, it may
eliminate one of their members.

00:13:03.551 --> 00:13:05.687 position:13% line:83% align:start
It'll take risking my life
to do it, though.

00:13:05.853 --> 00:13:09.189 position:13% line:83% align:start
Knowing that, would you be
willing to put your trust in me?

00:13:09.323 --> 00:13:10.324 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yeah, of course.

00:13:10.457 --> 00:13:12.026 position:16% line:83% align:start
You've had nothing but my
complete faith

00:13:12.159 --> 00:13:13.394 position:13% line:89% align:start
since the moment I met you.

00:13:13.528 --> 00:13:16.531 position:41% line:83% align:start
[gasps]
All right. Thank you, Master.

00:13:16.665 --> 00:13:18.465 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Ah!
-Argh!

00:13:19.133 --> 00:13:21.569 position:27% line:83% align:start
I can't allow you
to go any further.

00:13:21.703 --> 00:13:23.270 position:33% line:89% align:start
Himeji? Huh!

00:13:24.138 --> 00:13:27.609 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh? Angling to use
the same trick twice, are we?

00:13:27.742 --> 00:13:29.209 position:33% line:89% align:start
Who can say?

00:13:29.343 --> 00:13:31.011 position:10% line:83% align:start
If you think you can stop me,
you're welcome to try.

00:13:31.145 --> 00:13:33.914 position:30% line:83% align:start
All right then,
you asked for it.

00:13:40.854 --> 00:13:42.489 position:38% line:89% align:start
[screams]

00:13:42.624 --> 00:13:44.091 position:19% line:89% align:start
Damn it! What was that?

00:13:44.224 --> 00:13:46.093 position:13% line:89% align:start
Just Numerical Adjustment.

00:13:46.226 --> 00:13:47.696 position:41% line:83% align:start
[gasps]
Absurd!

00:13:47.828 --> 00:13:49.664 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI] Attack spells are
programmed to deal damage

00:13:49.798 --> 00:13:52.634 position:21% line:83% align:start
to a targeted player,
based on various numeric values.

00:13:52.767 --> 00:13:55.035 position:13% line:83% align:start
By recalculating the timing
and trajectory,

00:13:55.169 --> 00:13:58.172 position:16% line:83% align:start
it's possible to redirect
the very attack itself.

00:13:58.305 --> 00:14:00.941 position:19% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] She calculated
all of that in a few seconds?

00:14:01.075 --> 00:14:02.476 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's unbelievable!

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:04.244 position:30% line:83% align:start
Guess she's not
the Company's lead for nothing.

00:14:04.378 --> 00:14:07.549 position:10% line:89% align:start
Huh! What are you? A monster?

00:14:08.282 --> 00:14:09.483 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
I'm simply a maid.

00:14:09.617 --> 00:14:12.019 position:19% line:83% align:start
Loyally in the service
of my Master.

00:14:12.587 --> 00:14:17.391 position:27% line:83% align:start
Hiroto Shinohara.
Is that answer enough, Demon?

00:14:21.962 --> 00:14:23.063 position:35% line:83% align:start
[KURURUGI]
This fight's more difficult

00:14:23.197 --> 00:14:24.532 position:19% line:89% align:start
than I thought it'd be.

00:14:24.666 --> 00:14:25.933 position:21% line:89% align:start
But I'm not worried.

00:14:26.066 --> 00:14:27.901 position:33% line:83% align:start
Their spells
have to run out eventually.

00:14:28.035 --> 00:14:29.537 position:38% line:89% align:start
[clicks]

00:14:29.671 --> 00:14:31.372 position:38% line:89% align:start
[screams]

00:14:32.306 --> 00:14:33.207 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm!

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:36.076 position:27% line:83% align:start
No way. I didn't
see them use Trap!

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:37.812 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
And that's three down.

00:14:37.945 --> 00:14:39.480 position:16% line:89% align:start
Don't look so surprised.

00:14:39.614 --> 00:14:42.883 position:5% line:83% align:start
Our Little Devil has a knack for
anticipating people's movements.

00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:45.085 position:24% line:83% align:start
She's been dropping
her beloved Traps

00:14:45.219 --> 00:14:47.087 position:5% line:89% align:start
all over while we've been at it.

00:14:47.921 --> 00:14:49.022 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:14:49.824 --> 00:14:51.291 position:24% line:89% align:start
So that's it, huh?

00:14:51.425 --> 00:14:54.228 position:7% line:83% align:start
Her going after the Kagurazuki
pair was just a ploy.

00:14:54.361 --> 00:14:56.497 position:41% line:83% align:start
Academy
Island's strongest indeed.

00:14:56.631 --> 00:15:00.434 position:13% line:83% align:start
However, this plan of yours
has one vital flaw.

00:15:00.568 --> 00:15:02.035 position:38% line:89% align:start
Which is?

00:15:02.169 --> 00:15:05.339 position:7% line:83% align:start
In your bid for defense, you've
overdone the Counteract spells.

00:15:05.807 --> 00:15:08.543 position:5% line:83% align:start
You haven't really left yourself
much scope for attack.

00:15:08.676 --> 00:15:11.011 position:30% line:83% align:start
Yeah? How would
you know how many...

00:15:11.145 --> 00:15:12.847 position:35% line:83% align:start
[KURURUGI]
Thirty-five times!

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:15.482 position:19% line:83% align:start
You've used Counteract
thirty-five times

00:15:15.617 --> 00:15:16.818 position:27% line:89% align:start
since we started.

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:18.385 position:19% line:83% align:start
Accounting for the one
Magic Blast you fired off,

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:20.020 position:24% line:83% align:start
there shouldn't be
a single spell left

00:15:20.154 --> 00:15:21.756 position:19% line:89% align:start
in your personal slots.

00:15:22.222 --> 00:15:23.658 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Seriously?

00:15:23.792 --> 00:15:25.959 position:7% line:83% align:start
How was she able to keep count
during all of that?

00:15:26.895 --> 00:15:28.195 position:33% line:89% align:start
Not so fast.

00:15:28.328 --> 00:15:30.765 position:5% line:83% align:start
Master still has me by his side,
don't forget.

00:15:30.899 --> 00:15:32.366 position:16% line:89% align:start
If you wanna get at him,

00:15:32.499 --> 00:15:33.868 position:7% line:83% align:start
then you'll have to go through
his maid before that.

00:15:34.001 --> 00:15:36.370 position:38% line:89% align:start
[scoffs]

00:15:36.504 --> 00:15:37.705 position:41% line:89% align:start

[screams]

00:15:40.974 --> 00:15:42.409 position:41% line:89% align:start
Himeji!

00:15:42.976 --> 00:15:45.212 position:35% line:83% align:start
[KURURUGI]
Medusa's Magic Eye

00:15:45.345 --> 00:15:47.649 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's an ability that stops
an opponent's movement

00:15:47.782 --> 00:15:48.650 position:30% line:89% align:start
for one minute.

00:15:48.783 --> 00:15:50.250 position:19% line:89% align:start
That sure sounds handy.

00:15:50.384 --> 00:15:53.454 position:19% line:83% align:start
With this, our victory
is all but guaranteed.

00:15:53.588 --> 00:15:54.622 position:41% line:89% align:start
Is it?

00:15:54.756 --> 00:15:56.390 position:30% line:83% align:start
What about your
One-Shot kill, though?

00:15:56.524 --> 00:15:59.059 position:30% line:83% align:start
Don't you need
your teammate's help to use it?

00:15:59.193 --> 00:16:01.028 position:35% line:83% align:start
[KURURUGI]
Hmm! On the contrary.

00:16:01.161 --> 00:16:03.932 position:27% line:83% align:start
One-Shot Kill is,
by nature, at its most lethal

00:16:04.064 --> 00:16:05.800 position:7% line:89% align:start
when its user's fighting solo.

00:16:06.534 --> 00:16:08.903 position:27% line:83% align:start
But this contest
is a team-battle.

00:16:09.036 --> 00:16:10.839 position:10% line:89% align:start
So, in a show of solidarity,

00:16:10.971 --> 00:16:14.074 position:19% line:83% align:start
I overwrote its primary
condition for activation.

00:16:14.208 --> 00:16:17.311 position:13% line:83% align:start
Necessitating the presence
of allies to use it.

00:16:18.613 --> 00:16:21.114 position:30% line:83% align:start
Now I must undo
that restriction.

00:16:22.316 --> 00:16:25.052 position:27% line:83% align:start
Please forgive me
for this act of cowardice.

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.522 position:35% line:89% align:start
[BOTH gasp]

00:16:27.655 --> 00:16:30.658 position:7% line:83% align:start
The harsh truth is, I've always
been strongest alone.

00:16:30.792 --> 00:16:33.260 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll make you regret
belittling us.

00:16:33.393 --> 00:16:35.262 position:21% line:89% align:start
Now prepare yourself.

00:16:35.395 --> 00:16:36.631 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm!

00:16:38.165 --> 00:16:40.467 position:21% line:89% align:start
Argh! One-Shot Kill!

00:16:41.536 --> 00:16:43.638 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:16:50.143 --> 00:16:51.880 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:16:52.012 --> 00:16:53.280 position:13% line:89% align:start
That shouldn't be possible!

00:16:53.413 --> 00:16:55.650 position:16% line:83% align:start
All your slots should be
empty by now!

00:16:55.783 --> 00:16:58.686 position:10% line:83% align:start
A-ha! Yeah, it's true that a
bunch of spaces

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:01.923 position:21% line:83% align:start
got turned to green,
but in thinking I took 'em.

00:17:02.055 --> 00:17:04.124 position:19% line:89% align:start
You fell right for it!

00:17:04.626 --> 00:17:05.894 position:30% line:89% align:start
Fell for what?

00:17:06.026 --> 00:17:07.494 position:13% line:89% align:start
My Black Wings, of course.

00:17:07.629 --> 00:17:10.765 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's an ability that lets me
control visual effects,

00:17:10.899 --> 00:17:12.466 position:10% line:89% align:start
so I just tweaked the color.

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:16.336 position:5% line:83% align:start
In actuality, I've barely dipped
into my personal slots at all.

00:17:18.205 --> 00:17:19.541 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:17:20.975 --> 00:17:24.278 position:10% line:89% align:start
Urgh! Wait! What's going on?

00:17:24.779 --> 00:17:26.648 position:35% line:83% align:start
[KURURUGI]
Electronic Interference.

00:17:26.781 --> 00:17:27.849 position:30% line:89% align:start
My trump card.

00:17:27.982 --> 00:17:29.918 position:7% line:89% align:start
For Tsuyuri's honor and my own,

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:33.588 position:21% line:83% align:start
I can't allow myself
the luxury of falling here.

00:17:33.721 --> 00:17:35.422 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Ah! Hey!

00:17:35.557 --> 00:17:36.991 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:17:37.124 --> 00:17:39.393 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:17:39.527 --> 00:17:42.396 position:13% line:83% align:start
That was expertly handled,
Master.

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:43.497 position:41% line:89% align:start
Himeji.

00:17:43.631 --> 00:17:44.666 position:27% line:89% align:start
The Demon Maiden,

00:17:44.799 --> 00:17:46.801 position:10% line:83% align:start
she's quite adept in battle,
isn't she?

00:17:46.935 --> 00:17:48.101 position:33% line:89% align:start
Her intuition

00:17:48.235 --> 00:17:49.704 position:24% line:83% align:start
and resourcefulness
are peerless.

00:17:49.837 --> 00:17:53.073 position:10% line:83% align:start
But, wasn't that kind of odd?
Why didn't she finish me?

00:17:53.206 --> 00:17:55.977 position:7% line:83% align:start
All she had to do was throw out
one more attack spell.

00:17:56.109 --> 00:17:57.277 position:30% line:89% align:start
I was helpless.

00:17:57.411 --> 00:17:58.980 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
It does seem strange.

00:17:59.112 --> 00:18:00.915 position:5% line:89% align:start
Perhaps she had a reason not to.

00:18:01.049 --> 00:18:03.017 position:44% line:83% align:start
[NOA]
Hiroto!

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:05.319 position:38% line:89% align:start
[giggles]

00:18:05.452 --> 00:18:07.689 position:5% line:83% align:start
I hunted those two skittish guys
down like dogs

00:18:07.822 --> 00:18:08.690 position:30% line:89% align:start
and ended them.

00:18:08.823 --> 00:18:10.157 position:21% line:89% align:start
So, didn't I do good?

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:11.559 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Uh. Yeah.

00:18:12.292 --> 00:18:13.493 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yeah, you did.

00:18:13.628 --> 00:18:15.530 position:21% line:83% align:start
I wouldn't have made
it without you.

00:18:15.663 --> 00:18:16.798 position:35% line:89% align:start
All right!

00:18:16.931 --> 00:18:19.466 position:21% line:83% align:start
But wait, something's
not quite adding up.

00:18:19.601 --> 00:18:22.003 position:24% line:83% align:start
We just eliminated
Kagurazuki, didn't we?

00:18:22.135 --> 00:18:25.673 position:24% line:83% align:start
So then, why hasn't
Eimei's area increased any?

00:18:27.709 --> 00:18:29.877 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
You're right. It hasn't.

00:18:30.011 --> 00:18:31.079 position:44% line:83% align:start
[NOA]
Wait a sec.

00:18:31.211 --> 00:18:32.446 position:21% line:89% align:start
I remember something,

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:34.414 position:27% line:83% align:start
before I took out
those two guys.

00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:37.852 position:16% line:83% align:start
They said they were under
Miss Hundred Faces' umbrella.

00:18:38.686 --> 00:18:40.420 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
What could that mean?

00:18:40.555 --> 00:18:43.190 position:13% line:83% align:start
Either way, I can't imagine
all this weirdness is unrelated.

00:18:43.323 --> 00:18:46.226 position:27% line:83% align:start
Could it be him?
Up to his old tricks again?

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:47.629 position:19% line:89% align:start
Gotta play this right.

00:18:47.762 --> 00:18:49.897 position:33% line:83% align:start
From here on,
it's all or nothing.

00:18:50.031 --> 00:18:54.035 position:13% line:83% align:start
All right, look. I need you
to trust me and listen closely.

00:18:54.167 --> 00:18:55.536 position:35% line:89% align:start
[BOTH sigh]

00:18:57.005 --> 00:18:59.073 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SHINJI] Please accept
my deepest apologies.

00:18:59.206 --> 00:19:02.476 position:16% line:83% align:start
I saw the live broadcast.
Nanase, too.

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:04.211 position:7% line:89% align:start
Thanks to my profound arrogance

00:19:04.344 --> 00:19:06.714 position:10% line:83% align:start
you were put into a situation
you never should have been in.

00:19:07.882 --> 00:19:08.916 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Enomoto.

00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:10.283 position:19% line:89% align:start
Tell me, and be honest.

00:19:10.417 --> 00:19:11.753 position:10% line:89% align:start
Did you ever actually suspect

00:19:11.886 --> 00:19:13.921 position:19% line:83% align:start
that Asamiya was really
Miss Hundred Faces?

00:19:15.188 --> 00:19:16.991 position:21% line:89% align:start
No. I only said that

00:19:17.125 --> 00:19:18.526 position:27% line:83% align:start
because I wanted
to make her mad.

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:21.328 position:30% line:83% align:start
She's foolish,
but she's honest and pure.

00:19:21.461 --> 00:19:23.031 position:21% line:89% align:start
No one can fake that.

00:19:23.163 --> 00:19:26.534 position:5% line:83% align:start
She was putting on a brave face,
but I could tell she was off.

00:19:26.668 --> 00:19:28.435 position:16% line:83% align:start
I thought if she was out
of the game-

00:19:28.569 --> 00:19:30.437 position:16% line:83% align:start
Why are you looking at me
like that?

00:19:30.571 --> 00:19:33.373 position:21% line:83% align:start
Oh, uh. I'm just kind
of surprised

00:19:33.508 --> 00:19:34.776 position:16% line:89% align:start
you're opening up to me.

00:19:34.909 --> 00:19:37.845 position:24% line:83% align:start
Um! It's something
that's always on my mind,

00:19:37.979 --> 00:19:40.447 position:16% line:83% align:start
But it's not always easy
to say, you know?

00:19:40.581 --> 00:19:41.749 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:19:41.883 --> 00:19:43.718 position:41% line:89% align:start
Um! Ha!

00:19:43.851 --> 00:19:45.252 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:19:45.385 --> 00:19:47.354 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry, Shino!

00:19:47.487 --> 00:19:49.657 position:10% line:83% align:start
I wasn't trying to eavesdrop
on you, I promise!

00:19:49.791 --> 00:19:51.659 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SHINJI] How much of that
did you hear, Nanase?

00:19:51.793 --> 00:19:54.662 position:19% line:83% align:start
Answer, or so help me,
I will wipe your memory clean.

00:19:54.796 --> 00:19:56.731 position:21% line:83% align:start
I, uh, came in around
when you were saying.

00:19:56.864 --> 00:20:00.168 position:10% line:83% align:start
"I totally have the hots for
Nanase." So like, the tail-end.

00:20:00.635 --> 00:20:02.770 position:33% line:83% align:start
I didn't say
anything of the sort!

00:20:02.904 --> 00:20:04.872 position:19% line:83% align:start
That doesn't even sound
remotely like me!

00:20:05.006 --> 00:20:07.975 position:19% line:83% align:start
[NANASE] Hey, you said,
"She's always on my mind."

00:20:08.109 --> 00:20:09.409 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHINJI]
No I didn't!

00:20:09.544 --> 00:20:11.779 position:21% line:83% align:start
What? You practically
said that verbatim!

00:20:12.446 --> 00:20:13.614 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
I noticed something

00:20:13.748 --> 00:20:15.183 position:30% line:83% align:start
when I watched
the video on Libra.

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:18.385 position:16% line:83% align:start
While we were negotiating
with the Ibara Academy guys,

00:20:18.519 --> 00:20:20.922 position:16% line:83% align:start
one of them was preparing
a Magic Blast spell.

00:20:21.055 --> 00:20:23.925 position:7% line:83% align:start
I noticed when I slowed it down
to one-tenth speed.

00:20:25.026 --> 00:20:26.761 position:5% line:89% align:start
It was the guy Asamiya attacked.

00:20:27.294 --> 00:20:28.563 position:30% line:89% align:start
So that was it.

00:20:28.696 --> 00:20:30.665 position:10% line:83% align:start
You weren't being impulsive,
were you?

00:20:30.798 --> 00:20:32.600 position:5% line:89% align:start
You did what you did to help us.

00:20:32.734 --> 00:20:35.536 position:10% line:83% align:start
I just want to do my part for
the team, like everyone else.

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:38.238 position:33% line:83% align:start
Shino's tough
and seriously resourceful.

00:20:38.371 --> 00:20:39.841 position:10% line:89% align:start
Noa's cute and super clever.

00:20:39.974 --> 00:20:43.044 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yuki's just as cute
and has brains for days.

00:20:43.177 --> 00:20:44.344 position:27% line:89% align:start
Then there's you.

00:20:44.478 --> 00:20:46.480 position:16% line:83% align:start
While I wouldn't exactly
call you cute,

00:20:46.614 --> 00:20:49.316 position:21% line:83% align:start
you have a grounding
presence people can count on.

00:20:49.784 --> 00:20:52.086 position:30% line:83% align:start
The only thing
I can do is sling a sword.

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:54.989 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's why you reacted
so abnormally quickly?

00:20:55.123 --> 00:20:57.658 position:21% line:83% align:start
What else could I do?
I saw it going down.

00:20:57.792 --> 00:20:59.627 position:38% line:83% align:start
Not that
any of that matters now.

00:20:59.761 --> 00:21:01.195 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's pretty much over, right?

00:21:01.328 --> 00:21:02.663 position:10% line:89% align:start
We've got no area, no spells,

00:21:02.797 --> 00:21:05.332 position:10% line:83% align:start
our popularity's on the wane
and Shinohara,

00:21:05.465 --> 00:21:07.068 position:35% line:83% align:start
our premier
player's been eliminated.

00:21:07.201 --> 00:21:11.606 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hold up, did you say,
he's been eliminated?

00:21:11.739 --> 00:21:12.974 position:41% line:89% align:start
He was.

00:21:13.107 --> 00:21:15.475 position:5% line:83% align:start
Shino got eliminated from ASTRAL
at the end of the day.

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:17.277 position:19% line:89% align:start
He. did it to himself.

00:21:18.278 --> 00:21:22.049 position:13% line:83% align:start
All right, look. I need you
to trust me and listen closely.

00:21:25.019 --> 00:21:26.319 position:35% line:89% align:start
[BOTH sigh]

00:21:26.453 --> 00:21:27.655 position:41% line:89% align:start
[beeps]

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:32.560 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gunshot]

00:21:32.693 --> 00:21:34.862 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHINJI]
Why would you do that?

00:21:34.996 --> 00:21:38.365 position:16% line:83% align:start
Hang on, was this just so
you wouldn't lose our bet?

00:21:39.133 --> 00:21:40.300 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
I'm not gonna lie,

00:21:40.433 --> 00:21:42.136 position:24% line:83% align:start
satisfying the bet
was one reason.

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:43.671 position:13% line:89% align:start
But it wasn't the only one.

00:21:43.805 --> 00:21:45.740 position:21% line:83% align:start
Are you trying to say
that you being eliminated

00:21:45.873 --> 00:21:47.708 position:10% line:89% align:start
will somehow help Eimei win?

00:21:48.843 --> 00:21:51.913 position:7% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Miss Hundred Faces has
turned ASTRAL upside-down.

00:21:52.046 --> 00:21:55.382 position:19% line:83% align:start
She now has whole teams
working under her "umbrella."

00:21:55.516 --> 00:21:58.286 position:16% line:83% align:start
And among her opponents,
we're bottom of the pile.

00:21:58.418 --> 00:22:00.721 position:33% line:83% align:start
We can't win
playing by the book.

00:22:01.823 --> 00:22:05.293 position:5% line:89% align:start
But I wouldn't worry. After all.

00:22:05.425 --> 00:22:08.428 position:24% line:83% align:start
Everything's going
according to plan.
