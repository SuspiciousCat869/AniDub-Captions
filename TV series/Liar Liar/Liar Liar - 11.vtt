00:00:20.922 --> 00:00:21.956 position:27% line:89% align:start
Did you miss me?

00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:24.759 position:44% line:83% align:start
[NOA]
Yes! The wait was agony!

00:00:24.893 --> 00:00:26.026 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hey, hey, Shino!

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.563 position:27% line:83% align:start
I had every faith
you'd make it back to us.

00:00:28.796 --> 00:00:30.698 position:35% line:83% align:start
[chuckles]
You really are a tough one

00:00:30.832 --> 00:00:31.933 position:16% line:89% align:start
to keep down, aren't you?

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:33.701 position:13% line:89% align:start
Even if you are a slowpoke.

00:00:33.835 --> 00:00:35.770 position:35% line:83% align:start
[chuckles]
You can say that again.

00:00:39.106 --> 00:00:40.274 position:38% line:89% align:start
[annoyed]

00:00:40.708 --> 00:00:42.677 position:35% line:83% align:start
[KURAHASHI]
Oh, that sneaky little brat.

00:00:43.611 --> 00:00:44.546 position:38% line:89% align:start
So, what?

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:47.347 position:13% line:83% align:start
The board is still stacked
in my favor.

00:00:47.615 --> 00:00:48.583 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:00:48.883 --> 00:00:51.385 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'll just keep crushing you
until it takes.

00:00:57.457 --> 00:00:59.994 position:10% line:83% align:start
All right then, let's quickly
review the situation.

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:02.530 position:30% line:83% align:start
Before the end
of day four's first period,

00:01:02.664 --> 00:01:04.632 position:24% line:83% align:start
I was able to unify
the hold-out teams

00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:05.833 position:16% line:89% align:start
against our common enemy.

00:01:06.768 --> 00:01:09.037 position:24% line:89% align:start
Suisei. Ouka. Oumi.

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:12.339 position:38% line:83% align:start
Murakumo.
And Souken, all stand with us.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.741 position:27% line:89% align:start
Including Eimei,

00:01:14.042 --> 00:01:16.978 position:7% line:83% align:start
our Allied Army has a total of
twenty active players,

00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:19.279 position:21% line:83% align:start
whereas the coalition
we're up against

00:01:19.413 --> 00:01:20.782 position:27% line:89% align:start
has but fourteen.

00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:22.884 position:33% line:83% align:start
The academies
we're facing

00:01:23.051 --> 00:01:25.520 position:16% line:89% align:start
are Seijo, Shinra, Otowa.

00:01:25.753 --> 00:01:28.088 position:30% line:83% align:start
Saint Rosalia,
and Tsuyuri.

00:01:28.623 --> 00:01:30.825 position:7% line:83% align:start
You're saying we outnumber them
by six?

00:01:30.992 --> 00:01:33.061 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yeah, but they've got
some really heavy hitters

00:01:33.193 --> 00:01:34.261 position:24% line:89% align:start
in their fourteen.

00:01:34.428 --> 00:01:35.697 position:13% line:89% align:start
The Phoenix and the Demon.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.231 position:30% line:83% align:start
Those two alone
are enough of a handful.

00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:39.734 position:24% line:89% align:start
And the ringleader,

00:01:39.867 --> 00:01:41.603 position:38% line:83% align:start
a player
who shouldn't legally be here,

00:01:41.769 --> 00:01:44.404 position:35% line:83% align:start
propped up
by Seijo's former headmaster.

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:46.306 position:27% line:83% align:start
She's been using
illegal exploits

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.375 position:21% line:83% align:start
to adjust any setting
she wants.

00:01:49.142 --> 00:01:50.912 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Movement Value set to max.

00:01:51.045 --> 00:01:52.112 position:27% line:89% align:start
Unlimited spells.

00:01:52.346 --> 00:01:54.348 position:27% line:83% align:start
Combined benefits
from multiple roles.

00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:56.851 position:24% line:83% align:start
Unrestricted access
to the map from the start.

00:01:57.184 --> 00:01:58.418 position:13% line:89% align:start
And the icing on the cake?

00:01:58.553 --> 00:02:00.588 position:10% line:83% align:start
Nine-hundred-and-ninety-nine
life-points.

00:02:00.855 --> 00:02:02.957 position:44% line:83% align:start
Wait,
nine-hundred-and-ninety-nine?

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.559 position:24% line:89% align:start
We can't beat that!

00:02:04.826 --> 00:02:07.629 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're right, we can't.
But there is someone who can.

00:02:09.097 --> 00:02:10.330 position:27% line:89% align:start
The Demon Maiden.

00:02:10.832 --> 00:02:11.966 position:35% line:89% align:start
[all gasp]

00:02:12.432 --> 00:02:14.502 position:16% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Even with close
to a thousand life-points,

00:02:14.636 --> 00:02:18.006 position:7% line:83% align:start
Senri Kururugi's One-Shot kill
could still take her down.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.708 position:30% line:83% align:start
Yeah, but like,
isn't she all buddy-buddy

00:02:20.842 --> 00:02:22.209 position:16% line:89% align:start
with Miss Hundred Faces?

00:02:22.744 --> 00:02:24.812 position:13% line:83% align:start
That's why we're just gonna
have to convince her

00:02:24.946 --> 00:02:26.313 position:35% line:89% align:start
to help us.

00:02:26.446 --> 00:02:28.248 position:24% line:83% align:start
Even if that means
having to defeat her first.

00:02:28.382 --> 00:02:30.084 position:10% line:89% align:start
She's indeed no standard foe.

00:02:30.384 --> 00:02:32.620 position:19% line:83% align:start
If we're to fight her,
then we'll need an edge.

00:02:33.087 --> 00:02:34.956 position:13% line:89% align:start
Yeah, let's go take a base.

00:02:35.123 --> 00:02:36.156 position:35% line:89% align:start
[all gasp]

00:02:36.456 --> 00:02:37.825 position:10% line:89% align:start
Oumi's got one we can borrow,

00:02:38.092 --> 00:02:40.427 position:24% line:83% align:start
and it's only a hop
and a skip over there.

00:02:41.763 --> 00:02:43.865 position:19% line:83% align:start
All we have to do is go
and ask them for it.

00:02:45.066 --> 00:02:46.233 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NANASE]
That's right!

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:47.835 position:33% line:83% align:start
Then all this
will become Eimei's!

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:49.537 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SHINJI] That additional area
would indeed

00:02:49.671 --> 00:02:51.338 position:13% line:89% align:start
be a significant advantage.

00:02:52.472 --> 00:02:54.575 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll act as a decoy
and draw the enemy off.

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:57.444 position:24% line:83% align:start
Enomoto and Akizuki
will meet up with Oumi,

00:02:57.712 --> 00:02:59.814 position:21% line:83% align:start
then sweet-talk them
into giving us a base.

00:03:00.014 --> 00:03:02.617 position:35% line:83% align:start
[chuckles]
Being sweet is my specialty.

00:03:02.917 --> 00:03:05.887 position:10% line:83% align:start
You know it wouldn't kill you
to say please, Shinohara.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.188 position:13% line:83% align:start
Oh, quit being such a stick
in the mud!

00:03:08.422 --> 00:03:10.024 position:19% line:83% align:start
We don't have any time
to waste.

00:03:10.323 --> 00:03:12.527 position:24% line:83% align:start
Right! You all know
what you have to do!

00:03:12.794 --> 00:03:14.662 position:27% line:83% align:start
Don't even think
about holding back!

00:03:15.262 --> 00:03:16.664 position:24% line:89% align:start
We're going to war!

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:21.069 position:13% line:83% align:start
Oh, yeah! It's about to get
feral up in here!

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:23.838 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SUZURAN] The Allied Army
Eimei's cobbled together

00:03:23.971 --> 00:03:25.272 position:13% line:89% align:start
from the defiant hold-outs

00:03:25.405 --> 00:03:27.041 position:24% line:83% align:start
is taking the fight
to Miss Hundred Face's

00:03:27.175 --> 00:03:28.308 position:27% line:89% align:start
own United Army!

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:30.477 position:35% line:83% align:start
Right now,
the center is a sea of black,

00:03:30.611 --> 00:03:31.846 position:21% line:83% align:start
but the Allied Army's
gearing up

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:34.481 position:27% line:83% align:start
for a two-bodied
North-South pounce!

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:36.818 position:24% line:83% align:start
The first cat-fight
is on the right!

00:03:36.951 --> 00:03:38.686 position:24% line:83% align:start
With the main body
of Miss Hundred Face's

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.155 position:21% line:83% align:start
United Army clashing
with the Allied Empress,

00:03:41.288 --> 00:03:42.657 position:30% line:89% align:start
Sarasa Saionji!

00:03:43.057 --> 00:03:44.357 position:10% line:89% align:start
Claws are out in the middle,

00:03:44.491 --> 00:03:46.728 position:24% line:83% align:start
with Touya Kirigaya
and Seiran Kugasaki's

00:03:46.861 --> 00:03:49.063 position:10% line:83% align:start
United Absolute Monarchy team
about to battle

00:03:49.197 --> 00:03:52.299 position:16% line:83% align:start
the combined strength of
Suisei and Souken Academy!

00:03:53.467 --> 00:03:56.104 position:24% line:83% align:start
Left but not least,
we've got Senri Kururugi's

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:57.672 position:10% line:89% align:start
diabolical Demon Maiden team

00:03:57.805 --> 00:03:59.339 position:24% line:83% align:start
facing off against
the Allied Army's

00:03:59.473 --> 00:04:02.610 position:19% line:83% align:start
indomitable right-hook,
Eimei and Oumi!

00:04:03.544 --> 00:04:04.979 position:24% line:83% align:start
The odds are tough,
but if there's anybody

00:04:05.113 --> 00:04:07.380 position:19% line:83% align:start
who can fight their way
through this, it's him!

00:04:07.515 --> 00:04:09.483 position:13% line:83% align:start
Coming back from the dead,
it's the nine-lived,

00:04:09.617 --> 00:04:12.687 position:10% line:83% align:start
seven-starred, one-and-only,
Hiroto Shinohara himself!

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.724 position:10% line:83% align:start
And he's about to turn ASTRAL
into all-out Armageddon!

00:04:17.992 --> 00:04:20.828 position:21% line:83% align:start
All right, Shinohara.
The rest is up to you.

00:04:21.662 --> 00:04:22.429 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:04:22.563 --> 00:04:24.364 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Hmm.
-You came.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.135 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh.

00:04:27.568 --> 00:04:28.903 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Doesn't she want to fight?

00:04:29.504 --> 00:04:31.205 position:16% line:89% align:start
Or is it that she can't?

00:04:31.773 --> 00:04:33.541 position:7% line:89% align:start
You're out of luck Seven Star,

00:04:33.841 --> 00:04:36.611 position:10% line:83% align:start
'cause this here team of ours
excels in interception.

00:04:37.011 --> 00:04:38.045 position:38% line:89% align:start
Be good.

00:04:38.311 --> 00:04:39.847 position:21% line:89% align:start
And just die quietly!

00:04:40.248 --> 00:04:41.481 position:30% line:89% align:start

00:04:43.383 --> 00:04:44.852 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-No way!

00:04:47.989 --> 00:04:50.725 position:33% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Hmm.
Impeccable timing, Prez.

00:04:50.858 --> 00:04:52.827 position:35% line:89% align:start
Now! Yeah!

00:04:52.994 --> 00:04:55.530 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Look out!
-You gotta be kidding!

Cowards.

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:57.158 position:27% line:83% align:start
Your dishonorable
surprise tactics

00:05:57.291 --> 00:05:59.160 position:10% line:89% align:start
can merit only one response.

00:05:59.527 --> 00:06:00.561 position:38% line:89% align:start
Judgment!

00:06:00.761 --> 00:06:02.196 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Ha!
-Huh.

We lost Oumi?

00:06:07.034 --> 00:06:09.170 position:10% line:83% align:start
Guess she was being held back
after all.

[KURURUGI]
Hiroto Shinohara.

00:06:11.438 --> 00:06:13.140 position:27% line:83% align:start
Before this ends
I will bury you

00:06:13.274 --> 00:06:14.642 position:19% line:89% align:start
with my own two hands.

00:06:14.842 --> 00:06:17.545 position:24% line:83% align:start
But the rest of you
aren't even worth the energy.

00:06:17.712 --> 00:06:19.013 position:33% line:89% align:start
Say what now?

00:06:19.412 --> 00:06:20.715 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NANASE]
Shinji, advanced warning,

00:06:20.848 --> 00:06:23.284 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm about to do something
real impulsive here!

00:06:23.784 --> 00:06:26.153 position:41% line:83% align:start
[smug]
Unreasonable as always.

00:06:26.754 --> 00:06:28.022 position:19% line:89% align:start
But I've got your back,

00:06:28.256 --> 00:06:29.991 position:7% line:89% align:start
let's try it your way, Nanase.

00:06:30.157 --> 00:06:32.693 position:44% line:83% align:start
Hmm.
About time!

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:35.129 position:10% line:89% align:start
Why don't you just disappear?

00:06:36.931 --> 00:06:39.133 position:13% line:89% align:start
Sorry! Dodging's not in me!

00:06:41.369 --> 00:06:42.603 position:41% line:89% align:start
No way!

00:06:43.571 --> 00:06:45.039 position:41% line:83% align:start
[gasps]
What was that?

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:46.641 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmph?

00:06:47.608 --> 00:06:50.645 position:44% line:83% align:start
Huh.
Support skill. Lightning Rod.

00:06:51.045 --> 00:06:53.347 position:16% line:83% align:start
It drew off your ability
towards me instead.

00:06:53.581 --> 00:06:54.715 position:10% line:89% align:start
But since I was out of range,

00:06:54.849 --> 00:06:56.416 position:21% line:83% align:start
the attack harmlessly
dissipated

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:57.585 position:16% line:89% align:start
before it could connect.

00:06:57.852 --> 00:06:59.987 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Nice one!
-That was outstanding.

00:07:00.388 --> 00:07:01.656 position:35% line:83% align:start
[KURURUGI]
Oh, yeah?

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:03.224 position:13% line:89% align:start
Don't even think about it!

00:07:03.591 --> 00:07:06.093 position:21% line:83% align:start
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon,
c'mon, c'mon!

00:07:06.727 --> 00:07:09.030 position:16% line:89% align:start
Damn. Keep your distance!

Aah!

00:07:17.405 --> 00:07:19.439 position:13% line:89% align:start
You hit me? But you were...

00:07:20.174 --> 00:07:22.410 position:19% line:83% align:start
What you just witnessed
was called "Cornered."

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:24.979 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's an ability that increases
basic attack range

00:07:25.112 --> 00:07:28.249 position:16% line:83% align:start
and buffs various skills
when my partner's under threat.

00:07:28.549 --> 00:07:30.952 position:13% line:89% align:start
An ability to help Enomoto?

00:07:31.652 --> 00:07:32.820 position:30% line:89% align:start
Such devotion.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.923 position:10% line:83% align:start
I didn't realize how intimate
your relationship was.

00:07:36.324 --> 00:07:39.760 position:24% line:83% align:start
Huh? Hey, he and I
aren't intimate at all.

00:07:50.338 --> 00:07:52.773 position:7% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Well, Kururugi, seems
like you've lost this one.

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:54.241 position:30% line:83% align:start
I know you gave
that whole speech

00:07:54.375 --> 00:07:55.910 position:13% line:89% align:start
about being stronger alone.

00:07:56.644 --> 00:07:58.579 position:24% line:83% align:start
But that's clearly
not the case.

00:07:58.946 --> 00:07:59.780 position:41% line:89% align:start
Funny.

00:07:59.981 --> 00:08:01.315 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Back in the MTCG,

00:08:01.449 --> 00:08:03.451 position:33% line:83% align:start
I bumped into
one of your fellow classmates.

00:08:03.617 --> 00:08:04.685 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:08:04.819 --> 00:08:06.120 position:19% line:89% align:start
She was kind of upset.

00:08:06.554 --> 00:08:08.322 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Upset?
-Yeah,

00:08:08.789 --> 00:08:10.191 position:10% line:89% align:start
because you gave yourself up,

00:08:10.691 --> 00:08:12.492 position:35% line:83% align:start
falling in
with Miss Hundred Faces.

00:08:12.927 --> 00:08:15.863 position:13% line:83% align:start
But, it's more fair to say
they're upset with themselves

00:08:15.997 --> 00:08:17.798 position:27% line:83% align:start
for being so weak
that you had to.

00:08:18.766 --> 00:08:21.602 position:21% line:83% align:start
So, instead of always
just depending on you,

00:08:21.936 --> 00:08:24.005 position:13% line:83% align:start
they wanna be strong enough
to fight with you.

00:08:24.572 --> 00:08:25.873 position:30% line:89% align:start
Fight with me?

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:27.641 position:38% line:83% align:start
[smiles]
I see.

00:08:28.309 --> 00:08:29.710 position:19% line:89% align:start
If it weren't for them,

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:32.046 position:7% line:83% align:start
I wouldn't even be Demon Maiden
in the first place.

00:08:32.913 --> 00:08:35.116 position:21% line:89% align:start
All right. I'm ready.

00:08:35.416 --> 00:08:36.784 position:13% line:89% align:start
Finish me off, Seven Star.

00:08:37.184 --> 00:08:39.854 position:30% line:83% align:start
[smiles] Sorry,
your execution's been cancelled

00:08:40.488 --> 00:08:43.224 position:16% line:83% align:start

a redemption arc instead.

[exhales]

00:08:50.231 --> 00:08:52.500 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SARASA] She wiped out
my unit like we were nothing.

00:08:52.733 --> 00:08:54.301 position:13% line:89% align:start
How did she get so strong?

00:08:54.802 --> 00:08:57.538 position:13% line:83% align:start
Our only hope is to regroup
and attack as one.

00:08:58.039 --> 00:08:59.273 position:35% line:89% align:start
It's okay.

00:08:59.407 --> 00:09:01.842 position:24% line:83% align:start
He'll be here with
reinforcements soon, I know it.

00:09:05.413 --> 00:09:06.847 position:35% line:83% align:start
[KIRIGAYA]
Aw, man.

00:09:06.981 --> 00:09:09.583 position:13% line:83% align:start
This Allied Army of theirs
is a total snooze-fest.

00:09:09.784 --> 00:09:11.218 position:30% line:89% align:start
Touya Kirigaya.

00:09:11.619 --> 00:09:13.020 position:10% line:89% align:start
Just who could have imagined

00:09:13.154 --> 00:09:14.688 position:19% line:83% align:start
you'd be able to repel
a well-planned flank attack

00:09:14.822 --> 00:09:15.990 position:27% line:89% align:start
all by yourself?

00:09:16.357 --> 00:09:17.992 position:16% line:83% align:start
Ain't nothing impressive
about beating

00:09:18.125 --> 00:09:20.127 position:13% line:83% align:start
a bunch of weak-ass losers,
man.

00:09:20.261 --> 00:09:22.863 position:27% line:83% align:start
Yet, of our unit,
only we three remain.

00:09:22.997 --> 00:09:26.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
This sucks. I only wanted
a good seat to watch the show.

00:09:26.233 --> 00:09:28.169 position:41% line:83% align:start
and now
I'm like a main character.

00:09:28.302 --> 00:09:29.437 position:33% line:89% align:start
Just kill me.

00:09:30.004 --> 00:09:31.572 position:19% line:89% align:start
My, how dispassionate.

00:09:31.705 --> 00:09:34.775 position:7% line:89% align:start
Rosalia. Shizuku Minami, right?

00:09:35.042 --> 00:09:36.744 position:38% line:83% align:start
Judgement
from the vampire lord?

00:09:36.911 --> 00:09:38.079 position:30% line:89% align:start
How terrifying.

00:09:38.212 --> 00:09:40.347 position:16% line:83% align:start
-My blood's running cold.
-Watch it.

00:09:40.481 --> 00:09:42.917 position:13% line:83% align:start
You know, you were actually
pretty good back there.

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:46.287 position:16% line:83% align:start
You pack a big punch for
such a small unassuming thing.

00:09:47.321 --> 00:09:50.091 position:27% line:83% align:start
You keep that up
and I might just fall for ya.

00:09:50.224 --> 00:09:51.358 position:38% line:89% align:start
Yeah, no.

00:09:52.159 --> 00:09:54.061 position:33% line:83% align:start
Oh, come on!
Once ASTRAL's done,

00:09:54.195 --> 00:09:56.730 position:10% line:83% align:start
this whole island's gonna be
thirsty for Touya!

00:09:57.164 --> 00:09:59.433 position:41% line:83% align:start
Really.
As ambitious as ever.

00:09:59.667 --> 00:10:02.903 position:10% line:83% align:start
Well then, perhaps you could
start with conquering them.

00:10:03.104 --> 00:10:05.973 position:16% line:83% align:start
[KIRIGAYA] Oh, yeah. I've
been waiting for these guys.

00:10:07.408 --> 00:10:08.642 position:16% line:89% align:start
Word is you Allied stiffs

00:10:08.776 --> 00:10:10.244 position:30% line:83% align:start
showed our boys
one helluva time.

00:10:10.478 --> 00:10:13.481 position:13% line:83% align:start
That so? They lost too fast
for me to notice.

00:10:14.081 --> 00:10:15.584 position:38% line:83% align:start
[laughs]
Man, I hope

00:10:15.716 --> 00:10:17.251 position:19% line:83% align:start
that your Empress'll be
just as mouthy

00:10:17.384 --> 00:10:19.653 position:27% line:83% align:start
when we make good
on our orders to break her.

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:21.122 position:24% line:89% align:start
Did you hear that?

00:10:21.422 --> 00:10:22.656 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yeah, there's no doubt.

00:10:22.957 --> 00:10:25.126 position:13% line:83% align:start
Touya Kirigaya's thrown in
with him.

00:10:25.693 --> 00:10:26.894 position:35% line:89% align:start
Kurahashi.

00:10:27.728 --> 00:10:30.097 position:27% line:83% align:start
Enough chitchat!
Let's do this thing!

00:10:33.602 --> 00:10:35.336 position:13% line:89% align:start
How'd she react so quickly?

00:10:39.306 --> 00:10:41.275 position:38% line:83% align:start
[grunts]
Hm.

00:10:41.809 --> 00:10:44.378 position:16% line:83% align:start
Bear witness to the might
of the Phoenix!

00:10:46.213 --> 00:10:47.248 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:10:48.682 --> 00:10:49.917 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmph!

00:10:52.319 --> 00:10:53.354 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:10:56.558 --> 00:10:59.693 position:16% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Nice side-acts,
now let's see the headliner.

00:11:01.061 --> 00:11:02.096 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:11:02.496 --> 00:11:04.865 position:21% line:89% align:start
Compound my Upgrade.

00:11:05.499 --> 00:11:06.667 position:27% line:89% align:start
Compound Upgrade?

00:11:06.934 --> 00:11:08.537 position:35% line:83% align:start
[KIRIGAYA]
Cool, huh?

00:11:08.669 --> 00:11:10.771 position:10% line:83% align:start
Stacking two like spells for
additional use was sick enough,

00:11:10.905 --> 00:11:12.072 position:19% line:89% align:start
but with my Black Star,

00:11:12.206 --> 00:11:14.408 position:21% line:83% align:start
I can double-on-down
and hybridize.

00:11:14.742 --> 00:11:16.076 position:10% line:89% align:start
Meaning I can combine as many

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:18.145 position:24% line:83% align:start
flashy separate-use
attack-spells as I want

00:11:18.279 --> 00:11:20.014 position:21% line:83% align:start
into one big-old ball
of suck-it.

00:11:20.314 --> 00:11:22.249 position:24% line:83% align:start
But you know what?
It'd be better

00:11:22.383 --> 00:11:23.417 position:21% line:89% align:start
if I just showed you.

00:11:23.951 --> 00:11:25.886 position:13% line:89% align:start
Magic Blast and Swordflash.

00:11:26.187 --> 00:11:28.822 position:7% line:83% align:start
Mix 'em together, and they make
a whole new kind of spell.

00:11:28.956 --> 00:11:30.424 position:24% line:89% align:start
One I like to call.

00:11:30.691 --> 00:11:33.060 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-The Magic Blade!

00:11:33.562 --> 00:11:36.030 position:38% line:89% align:start
[growls]

00:11:37.731 --> 00:11:39.233 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Uh--
-Master, look out!

00:11:41.936 --> 00:11:43.971 position:41% line:83% align:start
Himeji!
[HIROTO] A combined spell?

That's awesome!
No, wait. Awful!

00:11:46.608 --> 00:11:47.609 position:35% line:89% align:start
It's awful.

-Enomoto?
-Shinohara.

00:11:57.519 --> 00:11:58.953 position:24% line:83% align:start
[SHINJI] We need to
buy some time to think

00:11:59.086 --> 00:11:59.987 position:21% line:89% align:start
through this, right?

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.223 position:16% line:89% align:start
Uh, yeah, all we can get.

00:12:02.624 --> 00:12:03.824 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:12:04.325 --> 00:12:05.159 position:27% line:89% align:start
Consider it done.

00:12:05.492 --> 00:12:07.328 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll keep 'em busy
as long as I can.

00:12:07.529 --> 00:12:09.863 position:21% line:83% align:start
Just work your magic

Right, take care of this guy,
would ya, Prez?

One day, you really must start

Hmph.

00:12:38.892 --> 00:12:41.195 position:13% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] I need to come up
with a plan. Now.

00:12:42.229 --> 00:12:44.465 position:13% line:89% align:start
Ah! Himeji, do your thing.

00:12:44.599 --> 00:12:46.500 position:41% line:83% align:start

My thing?

00:12:46.934 --> 00:12:48.302 position:30% line:89% align:start
Ah. Of course!

00:12:51.472 --> 00:12:53.073 position:27% line:89% align:start
Play time's over.

00:12:54.709 --> 00:12:55.744 position:38% line:89% align:start
What the?

00:12:55.943 --> 00:12:58.379 position:38% line:83% align:start

It worked like a charm.

00:12:58.812 --> 00:13:01.248 position:38% line:83% align:start
Damn you!
What did you do to me?

[chuckles]

00:13:03.484 --> 00:13:06.153 position:27% line:83% align:start
That right there
was the Replacement ability.

Sorry, but no.

00:13:20.167 --> 00:13:22.403 position:27% line:83% align:start
I've already seen
how that attack works.

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:24.204 position:38% line:89% align:start
And this?

00:13:27.374 --> 00:13:29.476 position:16% line:83% align:start
You haven't got a chance
at beating me.

00:13:30.311 --> 00:13:32.479 position:24% line:83% align:start
And you don't know
what you're talking about.

00:13:33.247 --> 00:13:35.517 position:35% line:83% align:start
Hmm. Well,
you are annoyingly fast,

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:36.850 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'll give you that much.

00:13:36.984 --> 00:13:39.688 position:27% line:83% align:start
Sexy thighs, too,
that's always a plus.

Quit looking down there!

00:13:42.489 --> 00:13:44.058 position:24% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Just now,
you said it was pointless

00:13:44.191 --> 00:13:45.426 position:19% line:89% align:start
using Compound Upgrade

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:47.061 position:30% line:83% align:start
because you've
already seen it, right?

00:13:47.394 --> 00:13:49.997 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's right. I can evade
attacks that I know.

00:13:50.364 --> 00:13:53.467 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yeah, but you're forgetting
one very important thing.

00:13:53.735 --> 00:13:55.235 position:16% line:89% align:start
The same ability or not,

00:13:55.369 --> 00:13:57.438 position:16% line:83% align:start
with the power difference
between a Six Star and a Seven,

00:13:57.572 --> 00:13:59.873 position:24% line:83% align:start
it might as well be
a new move entirely.

00:14:00.174 --> 00:14:01.442 position:44% line:83% align:start
[ALL]
New move?

00:14:01.643 --> 00:14:03.344 position:24% line:89% align:start

-Damn it!
-Oh my.

00:14:12.386 --> 00:14:14.121 position:19% line:83% align:start
Given the understanding
that Compound Upgrade

00:14:14.254 --> 00:14:16.825 position:27% line:83% align:start
has the capacity
to fuse together any spell,

00:14:17.424 --> 00:14:19.126 position:7% line:89% align:start
why limit that to just attack?

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:21.862 position:19% line:83% align:start
I figured, why not add
Conceal into the mix?

00:14:22.363 --> 00:14:24.365 position:33% line:83% align:start
What came out
was a Magic Blade

00:14:24.498 --> 00:14:27.034 position:24% line:83% align:start
more powerful than
anything ever seen before.

a lateral thinker here.

I just totally made that up.

00:14:38.245 --> 00:14:40.682 position:19% line:83% align:start
Reality is, the Company
juiced-up the effect.

00:14:41.248 --> 00:14:42.784 position:21% line:83% align:start
[smug] Never thought
the day would come

00:14:42.916 --> 00:14:45.052 position:16% line:83% align:start

my big guns!

It's time to say goodnight!

is good in principle.

00:15:23.357 --> 00:15:25.560 position:24% line:83% align:start
But that was barely
worth the calories.

his Compound Upgrade?

00:15:29.664 --> 00:15:32.166 position:24% line:83% align:start
You got all excited
and wasted it early.

your entire spell

Now watch closely, Shirayuki.

00:16:16.143 --> 00:16:17.478 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hey, Hiroto,

00:16:17.612 --> 00:16:20.314 position:30% line:83% align:start
did I at least
do something good in the end?

00:16:20.682 --> 00:16:21.749 position:24% line:89% align:start
Of course, you did!

00:16:22.684 --> 00:16:24.919 position:24% line:89% align:start
I did? That's good.

00:16:25.319 --> 00:16:28.590 position:24% line:83% align:start
Then, maybe one day
I can finally become your Ace.

-Aw, man,

00:16:37.765 --> 00:16:39.567 position:19% line:83% align:start
that's a real let-down.
I had higher hopes

00:16:39.701 --> 00:16:43.170 position:16% line:83% align:start
for Eimei's Little Devil.
But a loser is still a loser.

00:16:43.671 --> 00:16:44.706 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

Movement restriction!

It's the same
kind of thing Shirayuki

00:16:51.345 --> 00:16:52.647 position:19% line:89% align:start
got hit with yesterday!

00:16:52.881 --> 00:16:54.414 position:19% line:89% align:start
So did Akizuki do this?

00:16:54.649 --> 00:16:56.216 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KAGAYA]
Yeah, this is her all over!

00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:58.051 position:24% line:83% align:start
"Hell hath no fury"
type of stuff!

00:16:58.352 --> 00:16:59.921 position:16% line:83% align:start
Looks like she initiated
a comeuppance trap

00:17:00.053 --> 00:17:02.155 position:13% line:83% align:start
that'd spring in the event
of her elimination!

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:04.258 position:38% line:83% align:start
[scoffs]
Honestly,

00:17:04.391 --> 00:17:06.093 position:21% line:83% align:start
just what do you guys
take me for?

00:17:06.393 --> 00:17:08.796 position:13% line:83% align:start
You really think this'd be
enough to stop me?

00:17:09.096 --> 00:17:10.030 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
What?

00:17:10.163 --> 00:17:12.534 position:35% line:89% align:start
[screaming]

00:17:15.035 --> 00:17:17.005 position:13% line:89% align:start
Inability Barrier Upgrade.

00:17:17.237 --> 00:17:19.439 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's my thick invincible
wall of a spell,

00:17:19.574 --> 00:17:21.408 position:13% line:83% align:start
automatically shutting down
anything

00:17:21.543 --> 00:17:22.844 position:19% line:89% align:start
you could throw my way.

00:17:22.977 --> 00:17:24.211 position:38% line:89% align:start
[exhales]

00:17:25.914 --> 00:17:27.649 position:7% line:89% align:start
That's strike three, Kirigaya.

00:17:28.516 --> 00:17:30.083 position:13% line:89% align:start
First was Compound Upgrade,

00:17:30.484 --> 00:17:32.386 position:7% line:89% align:start
then Dual Wield, and now this.

00:17:32.587 --> 00:17:34.221 position:19% line:83% align:start
You've played your hand
entirely.

00:17:34.354 --> 00:17:36.189 position:38% line:83% align:start
Oh, yeah?
What does that matter?

00:17:36.658 --> 00:17:39.727 position:19% line:83% align:start
As long as my Inability
Barrier Upgrade stays active,

00:17:39.861 --> 00:17:41.061 position:16% line:89% align:start
you can't even touch me.

00:17:41.295 --> 00:17:42.564 position:13% line:89% align:start
But I can still raise hell

00:17:42.697 --> 00:17:44.298 position:21% line:83% align:start
to my heart's content
from inside of it.

00:17:44.866 --> 00:17:47.334 position:13% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] So then we'll just
have to attack from within.

00:17:47.769 --> 00:17:48.803 position:38% line:89% align:start
Won't we?

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:50.004 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

-[laughter]
-What?

00:17:57.444 --> 00:17:59.514 position:35% line:83% align:start
Surprised?
My remotely cast spells

00:17:59.647 --> 00:18:01.950 position:27% line:83% align:start
render your banal
little fortress' defenses

00:18:02.082 --> 00:18:03.483 position:27% line:89% align:start
all but obsolete.

00:18:03.651 --> 00:18:04.619 position:33% line:89% align:start
You asshole.

00:18:05.019 --> 00:18:07.421 position:19% line:83% align:start
Think you can betray me
and just get away with it?

-[smiles]
-[KUGASAKI] Betrayal?

00:18:10.758 --> 00:18:12.894 position:30% line:83% align:start
Did you forget
how I got my name?

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:14.862 position:13% line:89% align:start
I, the blazing Phoenix burn

00:18:14.996 --> 00:18:19.399 position:10% line:83% align:start
for Sarasa Saionji with every
searing cinder of my soul!

00:18:19.901 --> 00:18:21.335 position:27% line:89% align:start
Now, and forever.

00:18:21.569 --> 00:18:24.639 position:13% line:83% align:start
You think I would tolerate
a filthy fake Empress?

00:18:25.907 --> 00:18:27.441 position:16% line:89% align:start
Completely unacceptable!

00:18:27.709 --> 00:18:30.110 position:7% line:83% align:start
Are you telling me you planned
all this from the start?

00:18:30.243 --> 00:18:31.646 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Bingo.
-Huh?

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:34.582 position:30% line:83% align:start
While it's just
a temporary truce for ASTRAL.

00:18:35.349 --> 00:18:36.383 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Hey.

00:18:36.751 --> 00:18:38.318 position:35% line:83% align:start
[KUGASAKI]
Hiroto Shinohara?

00:18:38.853 --> 00:18:40.955 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Me and Kugasaki teamed up.

00:18:41.188 --> 00:18:43.156 position:38% line:83% align:start
[scoffs]
Well, guess you got me.

00:18:45.392 --> 00:18:46.493 position:30% line:89% align:start
[KUGASAKI smug]

00:18:46.861 --> 00:18:49.564 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm man enough to know
when I've been beat.

00:18:51.566 --> 00:18:53.400 position:27% line:83% align:start
But going quietly
into the night?

00:18:53.835 --> 00:18:56.169 position:24% line:83% align:start
Afraid that's just
not my style!

00:18:57.839 --> 00:18:58.873 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:18:59.874 --> 00:19:02.409 position:41% line:83% align:start
[gasps]
Aah!

00:19:03.343 --> 00:19:04.545 position:41% line:89% align:start

00:19:13.253 --> 00:19:15.089 position:10% line:89% align:start
My deepest apologies, Master.

00:19:15.623 --> 00:19:17.892 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'd hoped to attend you
until the very end.

00:19:18.092 --> 00:19:19.127 position:24% line:89% align:start
Please forgive me.

00:19:19.326 --> 00:19:20.595 position:13% line:89% align:start
What are you talking about?

00:19:21.029 --> 00:19:22.396 position:13% line:89% align:start
Why did you go and do that?

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:23.631 position:27% line:89% align:start
Because, Master,

00:19:23.965 --> 00:19:25.833 position:30% line:83% align:start
this plan could
only ever have worked

00:19:25.967 --> 00:19:27.267 position:16% line:89% align:start
if you were a part of it.

00:19:28.402 --> 00:19:31.606 position:16% line:83% align:start
Besides, even if I'm not
actively competing.

00:19:32.406 --> 00:19:33.741 position:10% line:89% align:start
It doesn't mean I'll stop...

-[scoffs]
-...being useful...

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:40.213 position:41% line:89% align:start
to you.

00:19:43.918 --> 00:19:44.952 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:19:45.252 --> 00:19:47.622 position:38% line:89% align:start
[sobbing]

00:19:50.725 --> 00:19:52.359 position:13% line:83% align:start
[KUGASAKI] It would appear
you're the only one

00:19:52.492 --> 00:19:53.961 position:24% line:89% align:start
on your team left.

00:19:54.929 --> 00:19:56.463 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yeah. All I can do now

00:19:56.597 --> 00:19:59.567 position:16% line:83% align:start
is hope Saionji holds out
until Kururugi gets there.

00:19:59.901 --> 00:20:01.368 position:27% line:89% align:start
Ah. So that's it.

00:20:01.736 --> 00:20:04.739 position:13% line:83% align:start
Your final end-game gambit
is the Demon Maiden.

00:20:05.606 --> 00:20:08.042 position:13% line:83% align:start
[KUGASAKI] Kirigaya figured
Seijo's indiscretion

00:20:08.176 --> 00:20:09.409 position:27% line:89% align:start
would be exposed,

00:20:09.544 --> 00:20:11.445 position:24% line:83% align:start
and so he withdrew
from the United Army

00:20:11.579 --> 00:20:13.047 position:24% line:89% align:start
before his demise.

00:20:13.181 --> 00:20:14.481 position:10% line:89% align:start
If he hadn't, his complicity

00:20:14.615 --> 00:20:16.383 position:21% line:83% align:start
would have earned him
a disqualification.

00:20:16.584 --> 00:20:17.885 position:16% line:89% align:start
He sure is a crafty one.

00:20:18.019 --> 00:20:19.954 position:24% line:83% align:start
Since my betrayal's
been exposed,

00:20:20.088 --> 00:20:21.889 position:7% line:89% align:start
I've also withdrawn from them.

00:20:22.422 --> 00:20:24.224 position:38% line:83% align:start
I believe
I'll follow Kirigaya's lead

00:20:24.357 --> 00:20:25.660 position:19% line:89% align:start
and secure my own rank.

00:20:26.127 --> 00:20:30.098 position:16% line:83% align:start
And please. Do me a favor
and hold off on the eulogizing.

00:20:30.497 --> 00:20:32.332 position:13% line:89% align:start
Until next time, my rival.

00:20:32.834 --> 00:20:35.268 position:13% line:83% align:start
Protect the Empress' honor
in my place.

00:20:35.402 --> 00:20:36.704 position:24% line:89% align:start
That is all I ask.

[HIROTO]
End this, Kururugi.

00:20:43.144 --> 00:20:44.846 position:10% line:89% align:start
Put Miss Hundred Faces down.

Do it!

-You're through!
-Huh?

00:21:03.631 --> 00:21:06.667 position:21% line:89% align:start

[SARASA DOPPEL giggle]

00:21:25.686 --> 00:21:27.855 position:7% line:83% align:start
Cheap trick having her stab me
in the back like that.

00:21:28.222 --> 00:21:30.290 position:16% line:89% align:start
No way, it's impossible.

00:21:30.792 --> 00:21:32.226 position:10% line:89% align:start
We put everything we had left

00:21:32.359 --> 00:21:33.795 position:21% line:83% align:start
to give into creating
that opening.

00:21:34.095 --> 00:21:35.997 position:21% line:83% align:start
[SARASA DOPPEL] Well,
I guess it's to be expected.

00:21:36.296 --> 00:21:40.034 position:10% line:83% align:start
If One-Shot Kill isn't enough
to stop you, what is?

00:21:41.002 --> 00:21:43.805 position:7% line:83% align:start
I think it's obvious which one
of us is the winner here.

Aren't you lucky?

00:21:55.482 --> 00:21:56.617 position:24% line:83% align:start
You get to cling to
the title of "Empress"

00:21:56.751 --> 00:21:58.619 position:16% line:89% align:start
until the very last day.
