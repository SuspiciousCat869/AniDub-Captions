You disappoint me, Little Devil.

Even
with all the illegal abilities

You know, something wonderful
happened yesterday.

An incompetent dictator

was finally exposed
as the scumbag he is.

00:01:49.142 --> 00:01:50.545 position:41% line:83% align:start
Despite
his distinguished bearing,

00:01:50.678 --> 00:01:52.212 position:7% line:89% align:start
he was a manipulative con man,

00:01:52.346 --> 00:01:55.248 position:19% line:83% align:start
whose empire collapsed
in a single evening.

00:01:55.382 --> 00:01:56.718 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm actually still
a little groggy

00:01:56.851 --> 00:01:59.087 position:33% line:83% align:start
from a night
of celebratory drinking.

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.387 position:30% line:89% align:start

is a bit shaky.

allow me to present to you
our two remaining survivors.

00:02:09.296 --> 00:02:12.734 position:16% line:83% align:start
First up, the Seven Star,
Hiroto Shinohara.

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:14.334 position:5% line:89% align:start
Although, that's kind of a given

00:02:14.468 --> 00:02:15.670 position:13% line:89% align:start
seeing as how anything less

00:02:15.803 --> 00:02:17.538 position:30% line:83% align:start
would make him
a total laughingstock.

00:02:18.305 --> 00:02:20.407 position:10% line:83% align:start
Weirdly threatening addendum,
but okay.

00:02:20.808 --> 00:02:22.844 position:35% line:83% align:start
[ICHINOSE]
Next is the Little Devil,

00:02:22.977 --> 00:02:25.013 position:13% line:89% align:start
the Six Star, Noa Akizuki.

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:26.114 position:41% line:89% align:start

00:02:26.246 --> 00:02:27.347 position:44% line:89% align:start

for the district
elimination team,

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.186 position:21% line:83% align:start
but only one of them
can be titled Eimei's Ace.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.488 position:21% line:89% align:start
A final confrontation

00:02:34.622 --> 00:02:36.189 position:21% line:83% align:start
between the Six Star
and the Seven.

Um, Headmistress?

00:02:38.593 --> 00:02:40.662 position:13% line:89% align:start
May I please say something?

00:02:41.062 --> 00:02:42.664 position:38% line:89% align:start
I, uh...

00:02:43.064 --> 00:02:44.197 position:24% line:89% align:start
I don't want to...

00:02:44.565 --> 00:02:46.567 position:10% line:83% align:start
[sighs] I don't want to fight
against Hiroto.

-Mm...
-And would you care to tell us

00:02:48.936 --> 00:02:50.404 position:27% line:89% align:start
why exactly not?

00:02:50.538 --> 00:02:52.740 position:24% line:83% align:start
I think most people
have already heard this by now,

00:02:52.874 --> 00:02:55.308 position:27% line:83% align:start
but in my desire
to escape feeling less than,

00:02:55.442 --> 00:02:57.779 position:41% line:83% align:start
I made
some reprehensible choices.

00:02:57.912 --> 00:02:59.346 position:19% line:89% align:start
I used illegal methods,

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:01.749 position:13% line:83% align:start
and I tried to steal Stars
from Hiroto.

00:03:01.883 --> 00:03:03.450 position:21% line:89% align:start
For that, I'm sorry.

00:03:03.584 --> 00:03:05.853 position:19% line:83% align:start
Ultimately, my attempts
came to nothing anyway,

00:03:05.987 --> 00:03:08.723 position:19% line:83% align:start
but while everyone else
was competing in good faith,

00:03:08.856 --> 00:03:11.425 position:35% line:83% align:start
my conduct
was wholly unacceptable.

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:13.995 position:19% line:83% align:start
So, it only makes sense
that I withdraw--

Uh? Is something wrong, Hiroto?

00:03:17.732 --> 00:03:19.199 position:7% line:89% align:start
You've got absolutely no reason

-Huh?

00:03:21.035 --> 00:03:23.604 position:16% line:83% align:start

Kurahashi's fault.

00:03:23.738 --> 00:03:25.673 position:19% line:83% align:start

in the end.

Well, yeah,
but nobody's going to forgive me

00:03:28.142 --> 00:03:29.177 position:24% line:89% align:start

right after the stream ended.

of the students here

actually took your side,

00:03:46.861 --> 00:03:48.830 position:16% line:83% align:start

of Eimei Academy

00:05:24.457 --> 00:05:26.426 position:24% line:83% align:start
Next, the Six Star
student council president

00:05:26.561 --> 00:05:27.829 position:24% line:89% align:start
with second sight,

00:05:27.962 --> 00:05:29.329 position:30% line:89% align:start
Shinji Enomoto!

00:05:29.462 --> 00:05:30.932 position:33% line:83% align:start
You know him
as the highest-ranked

00:05:31.065 --> 00:05:32.332 position:24% line:89% align:start
on Academy Island,

00:05:32.465 --> 00:05:34.635 position:10% line:89% align:start
Seven Star, Hiroto Shinohara!

00:05:34.769 --> 00:05:38.239 position:10% line:83% align:start
And finally, Eimei's new ace,
the Little Devil,

00:05:38.371 --> 00:05:40.007 position:19% line:89% align:start
Six Star, Noa Akizuki!

00:05:40.575 --> 00:05:42.310 position:24% line:83% align:start
These are the five
who will represent us

00:05:42.442 --> 00:05:45.012 position:5% line:89% align:start
in the May Inter-Academy Battle!

00:05:45.445 --> 00:05:46.614 position:27% line:83% align:start
[MALE STUDENT 7D]
You got this!

00:05:46.747 --> 00:05:48.182 position:27% line:83% align:start
[MALE STUDENT 7E]
Put on a good show!

00:05:48.316 --> 00:05:51.152 position:13% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Not a bad outcome,
all things considered.

00:05:51.285 --> 00:05:52.320 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SARASA]
You can say that again.

00:05:52.452 --> 00:05:53.554 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm just glad the Little Devil

00:05:53.688 --> 00:05:54.989 position:27% line:83% align:start
didn't get kicked
off the island.

00:05:55.656 --> 00:05:57.291 position:30% line:83% align:start
Still, though,
as an Ouka student,

00:05:57.424 --> 00:05:58.926 position:7% line:89% align:start
I can't be too happy about it.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.161 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:06:00.294 --> 00:06:02.063 position:35% line:83% align:start
Yeah, well,
it's not like she was let off

00:06:02.196 --> 00:06:03.598 position:19% line:89% align:start
without any penalties.

00:06:03.731 --> 00:06:05.365 position:30% line:83% align:start
As compensation
for all the trouble she caused,

00:06:05.498 --> 00:06:06.834 position:7% line:89% align:start
she forked over the Green Star.

00:06:06.968 --> 00:06:08.401 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SARASA]
You got the green, too?

00:06:08.536 --> 00:06:10.304 position:19% line:83% align:start
So, that makes you what
in reality?

00:06:10.437 --> 00:06:11.973 position:10% line:89% align:start
A triple-colored three star?

00:06:12.106 --> 00:06:13.373 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Yup, bingo.

00:06:13.841 --> 00:06:16.409 position:10% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] I'm still a ways off
from being a real Seven Star,

00:06:16.544 --> 00:06:18.411 position:19% line:83% align:start
but if I keep on moving
towards that goal,

00:06:18.546 --> 00:06:19.847 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'll find her.

00:06:19.981 --> 00:06:22.183 position:16% line:83% align:start
So, when do I get to know
where you're dragging me

00:06:22.316 --> 00:06:23.751 position:19% line:89% align:start
on my precious day off?

00:06:23.885 --> 00:06:24.785 position:35% line:89% align:start
Right now.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.954 position:35% line:89% align:start
We're here.

00:06:27.088 --> 00:06:28.455 position:38% line:89% align:start
Mm! Ah...

00:06:28.923 --> 00:06:30.390 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
What's this all about, Saionji?

00:06:30.524 --> 00:06:31.826 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SARASA]
Huh? What do you mean?

00:06:31.959 --> 00:06:33.561 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's exactly what it looks like.

00:06:33.694 --> 00:06:36.429 position:16% line:83% align:start
Listen, this store sells
some awesome stuff,

00:06:36.564 --> 00:06:38.633 position:16% line:83% align:start
like the card I gave you
the other night.

00:06:39.432 --> 00:06:40.768 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
No kidding.

00:06:40.902 --> 00:06:42.469 position:16% line:83% align:start
So this is where you got
that Pinch Hitter, huh?

00:06:42.603 --> 00:06:44.338 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SARASA] This is the place,
all right, but to get you in,

00:06:44.471 --> 00:06:47.341 position:24% line:83% align:start
you have to satisfy
their weird entry requirement.

00:06:47.708 --> 00:06:49.476 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Yeah, but this?

00:06:50.044 --> 00:06:51.913 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SARASA]
Look, I mentioned it, didn't I?

00:06:52.046 --> 00:06:53.981 position:19% line:83% align:start
That I needed your help
getting in somewhere?

00:06:54.115 --> 00:06:56.317 position:33% line:83% align:start
If anything,
you should consider it an honor.

00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:57.952 position:7% line:89% align:start
Even if it's just for a while,

00:06:58.085 --> 00:07:01.122 position:19% line:83% align:start
you get to be my lover,
or whatever you would call it.

00:07:02.723 --> 00:07:04.025 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Whoa.

00:07:04.825 --> 00:07:06.060 position:16% line:89% align:start
I did give her a heads-up

00:07:06.193 --> 00:07:08.095 position:21% line:83% align:start
that I'd swinging by
with some company.

00:07:09.163 --> 00:07:10.631 position:24% line:89% align:start
Anyone back there?

00:07:11.065 --> 00:07:12.033 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hey! Welcome!

00:07:12.166 --> 00:07:14.902 position:35% line:83% align:start
Wait, Lily?
What are you doing here?

00:07:15.403 --> 00:07:17.271 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
"Lily"? Oh, yeah.

00:07:17.405 --> 00:07:19.240 position:7% line:89% align:start
She can't use her other names.

00:07:19.373 --> 00:07:20.608 position:24% line:89% align:start
So, hey, Lily-bud.

00:07:20.741 --> 00:07:22.710 position:10% line:83% align:start
I hope you haven't forgotten
my policy,

00:07:22.843 --> 00:07:24.211 position:24% line:89% align:start
the one stipulating

00:07:24.345 --> 00:07:26.247 position:13% line:83% align:start
that I'll only do business
with people I like?

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:27.548 position:24% line:89% align:start
No, of course not.

00:07:27.915 --> 00:07:29.216 position:21% line:83% align:start
[ABILITY SHOP OWNER]
And since you also know

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:30.584 position:24% line:89% align:start
I choose who I like

00:07:30.718 --> 00:07:32.119 position:10% line:83% align:start
based on whether they follow
the rules,

00:07:32.253 --> 00:07:34.522 position:19% line:83% align:start
that must mean this guy
is your boyfriend, right?

00:07:35.556 --> 00:07:36.590 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yup, that's right!

00:07:36.724 --> 00:07:38.726 position:7% line:89% align:start
His name is Sh-- I mean, Hiro.

00:07:38.859 --> 00:07:40.460 position:19% line:89% align:start
Looks cool, doesn't he?

00:07:40.594 --> 00:07:41.829 position:21% line:89% align:start
Please don't mind me.

00:07:41.963 --> 00:07:43.230 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm really just tagging along
is all.

00:07:43.364 --> 00:07:44.832 position:21% line:83% align:start
[ABILITY SHOP OWNER]
Oh, I'll mind, bub.

00:07:44.966 --> 00:07:46.499 position:10% line:83% align:start
My Lily-bud's been out there
riding solo

00:07:46.634 --> 00:07:47.768 position:7% line:89% align:start
for as long as I've known her.

00:07:47.902 --> 00:07:49.070 position:16% line:89% align:start
And now she struts on in

00:07:49.203 --> 00:07:51.372 position:35% line:83% align:start
to show me
her "cool" new boyfriend?

00:07:51.505 --> 00:07:52.940 position:27% line:89% align:start
I know the game.

00:07:53.074 --> 00:07:55.376 position:21% line:83% align:start
You must be one heck
of a wild young hot rod, huh?

00:07:55.509 --> 00:07:57.411 position:10% line:89% align:start
I might just die of jealousy.

00:07:57.545 --> 00:08:00.281 position:38% line:83% align:start
Although,
not much spark in the plug.

00:08:00.948 --> 00:08:02.917 position:35% line:83% align:start
Are you two
even really going out?

00:08:03.317 --> 00:08:05.386 position:19% line:83% align:start
-[HIROTO, SARASA] Huh?
-I mean, if you are,

00:08:05.519 --> 00:08:06.988 position:16% line:83% align:start
then you should at least
be holding hands.

00:08:07.121 --> 00:08:08.556 position:27% line:83% align:start
-In front of you?
-[OWNER] It's not like

00:08:08.689 --> 00:08:09.991 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm asking you to kiss
on the spot,

00:08:10.124 --> 00:08:11.759 position:21% line:83% align:start
-or do anything sus.
-Uh...

00:08:11.892 --> 00:08:13.961 position:16% line:83% align:start
You think I could do that
with someone there watching,

00:08:14.095 --> 00:08:15.096 position:35% line:89% align:start
you dummy?

00:08:15.229 --> 00:08:16.397 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hey, come on, Lily!

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:18.399 position:24% line:83% align:start
-[grunts] Saionji.
-Ah!

00:08:18.532 --> 00:08:20.101 position:19% line:83% align:start
Wha, what do you want,
Shinohara?

00:08:20.234 --> 00:08:22.403 position:24% line:83% align:start
You going to start
teasing me, too?

00:08:22.536 --> 00:08:23.738 position:21% line:89% align:start
Would you calm down?

00:08:23.871 --> 00:08:25.840 position:16% line:83% align:start
All she's asking us to do
is hold hands.

00:08:25.973 --> 00:08:28.175 position:7% line:83% align:start
So let's just get it over with,
already.

00:08:28.309 --> 00:08:29.677 position:30% line:89% align:start
You seem eager.

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:31.712 position:13% line:83% align:start
Almost like you can't wait
to get your mitts on me.

00:08:31.846 --> 00:08:33.347 position:27% line:89% align:start
Don't start that!

00:08:33.481 --> 00:08:35.883 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's only embarrassing
because you're overthinking it.

00:08:37.251 --> 00:08:38.152 position:30% line:89% align:start
[SARASA sighs]

00:08:38.686 --> 00:08:39.553 position:35% line:89% align:start
[whimpers]

00:08:40.121 --> 00:08:41.756 position:24% line:83% align:start
-[HIROTO] Uh, Lily?
-Uh...

00:08:42.923 --> 00:08:44.558 position:16% line:89% align:start
This is just a handshake.

00:08:44.692 --> 00:08:45.626 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SARASA]
Huh? No!

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.261 position:5% line:89% align:start
Our hands were totally touching!

00:08:47.395 --> 00:08:49.296 position:7% line:89% align:start
That counts. How could it not?

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:50.698 position:10% line:89% align:start
[ABILITY SHOP OWNER chuckles]

00:08:50.831 --> 00:08:52.233 position:21% line:83% align:start
[ABILITY SHOP OWNER]
All right, I buy it.

00:08:52.366 --> 00:08:53.667 position:27% line:83% align:start
[SARASA, HIROTO]
Huh?

00:08:53.801 --> 00:08:55.002 position:13% line:83% align:start
What you two obviously lack
in confidence,

00:08:55.136 --> 00:08:57.038 position:16% line:83% align:start
you more than make up for
in chemistry.

00:08:57.171 --> 00:08:59.707 position:19% line:83% align:start
I hereby recognize you
as a couple.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.075 position:33% line:89% align:start
What? Really?

00:09:01.208 --> 00:09:02.009 position:41% line:89% align:start
You do?

00:09:02.143 --> 00:09:03.512 position:7% line:89% align:start
You sure you're okay with that?

00:09:03.644 --> 00:09:05.146 position:13% line:83% align:start
All we did was shake hands,
you know?

00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:06.647 position:30% line:89% align:start
Shut up, Hiro.

00:09:07.048 --> 00:09:08.182 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:09:08.315 --> 00:09:09.483 position:35% line:89% align:start
Of course.

00:09:09.617 --> 00:09:10.751 position:13% line:83% align:start
I've always had a soft spot
for Lily,

00:09:10.885 --> 00:09:12.119 position:27% line:89% align:start
and get-up aside,

00:09:12.253 --> 00:09:13.522 position:19% line:83% align:start
you're really starting
to grow on me,

00:09:13.654 --> 00:09:15.156 position:30% line:89% align:start
so we're good.

00:09:15.289 --> 00:09:17.358 position:19% line:83% align:start
You pass. I'll sell you
whatever ability you're after.

00:09:18.159 --> 00:09:20.561 position:13% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] I wasn't expecting
to see so many rare abilities

00:09:20.694 --> 00:09:21.629 position:33% line:89% align:start
in one place.

00:09:21.762 --> 00:09:23.130 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SARASA]
Oh, come on,

00:09:23.264 --> 00:09:25.032 position:19% line:83% align:start
you can't seriously be
that doe-eyed, can you?

00:09:25.166 --> 00:09:26.834 position:27% line:83% align:start
These are things
you need to know.

00:09:26.967 --> 00:09:29.270 position:19% line:83% align:start
I guess it's lucky that
I'm around to show you, huh?

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:31.372 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
Welcome home, Master,

00:09:31.506 --> 00:09:33.240 position:16% line:89% align:start
and welcome again, Rina.

00:09:33.374 --> 00:09:34.543 position:30% line:89% align:start
Oh, hey there.

00:09:34.675 --> 00:09:36.644 position:41% line:83% align:start
I trust
you had an enjoyable date?

00:09:36.777 --> 00:09:38.212 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SARASA]
Date? It wasn't a date!

00:09:38.345 --> 00:09:39.780 position:27% line:83% align:start
I just asked him
to come shopping with me,

00:09:39.914 --> 00:09:41.248 position:33% line:83% align:start
-that's all!
-And yet,

00:09:41.382 --> 00:09:44.151 position:19% line:83% align:start
you shopped at a store
that only admits couples.

00:09:44.285 --> 00:09:46.387 position:21% line:83% align:start
Wait, how do you know
about that?

00:09:46.521 --> 00:09:47.721 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Well, they don't call her

00:09:47.855 --> 00:09:49.457 position:10% line:89% align:start
a high-spec maid for nothing.

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:51.892 position:7% line:83% align:start
I've been wanting to thank you,
for your help

00:09:52.026 --> 00:09:54.328 position:21% line:83% align:start
during the All-Campus
Elimination Battle.

00:09:54.462 --> 00:09:57.498 position:5% line:83% align:start
To that end, I will do my utmost
to serve you today.

00:09:57.631 --> 00:10:00.701 position:7% line:83% align:start
Hey, you do your best every day
and we appreciate it.

00:10:00.835 --> 00:10:02.571 position:24% line:83% align:start
You've got nothing
to make up to us.

00:10:02.703 --> 00:10:04.605 position:27% line:83% align:start
But, if it helps,
I wouldn't say no

00:10:04.738 --> 00:10:06.607 position:16% line:83% align:start
to one of your delicious
home-cooked meals.

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:08.409 position:21% line:89% align:start
Mm. Consider it done.

00:10:08.543 --> 00:10:10.978 position:30% line:83% align:start
Dinner is ready
whenever your appetite permits.

00:10:11.112 --> 00:10:13.515 position:24% line:83% align:start
Or would you prefer
a soothing bath, first?

00:10:13.647 --> 00:10:15.349 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh yeah, there's an idea.

00:10:15.483 --> 00:10:16.617 position:19% line:89% align:start
After all that walking,

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:18.152 position:21% line:83% align:start
we could probably do
with a wash.

00:10:18.285 --> 00:10:20.421 position:16% line:83% align:start
Now that you mention it,
I am feeling a little grody.

00:10:20.555 --> 00:10:22.923 position:10% line:83% align:start
Splendid, and I would be more
than happy to help,

00:10:23.057 --> 00:10:25.126 position:19% line:83% align:start
by scrubbing your backs
at the same time.

00:10:25.259 --> 00:10:27.529 position:27% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO, SARASA]
Huh? The same time?

00:10:27.661 --> 00:10:28.729 position:24% line:89% align:start
Whoa, now, back up.

00:10:28.863 --> 00:10:30.097 position:30% line:89% align:start
The same time?

00:10:30.231 --> 00:10:31.699 position:24% line:83% align:start
Wouldn't that mean
he'd see me in the buff?

00:10:31.832 --> 00:10:33.267 position:21% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI] You'd be
in swimsuits, naturally.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.169 position:44% line:83% align:start
Given
your pathological proclivity

00:10:35.302 --> 00:10:37.071 position:33% line:83% align:start
for flaunting
daring, beachside bikinis

00:10:37.204 --> 00:10:38.439 position:33% line:89% align:start
every summer,

00:10:38.573 --> 00:10:40.141 position:10% line:83% align:start
I don't imagine that will be
too much of a problem.

00:10:40.274 --> 00:10:42.544 position:33% line:83% align:start
Wow, that was
some ice-cold shade right there.

00:10:42.943 --> 00:10:44.513 position:21% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI] Besides,
the mansion comes equipped

00:10:44.645 --> 00:10:47.181 position:7% line:83% align:start
with a custom extra-large bath
for the Seven Star.

00:10:47.314 --> 00:10:50.384 position:30% line:83% align:start
Yeah, but like,
wearing a swimsuit in the bath?

00:10:50.519 --> 00:10:52.653 position:13% line:89% align:start
Isn't that even more kinky?

-If that's the case,

would you prefer to be nude?

00:10:55.923 --> 00:10:57.358 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm sure I could accommodate
that if necessary.

00:10:57.491 --> 00:11:00.361 position:24% line:83% align:start
Come on! That's not
what I meant, and you know it!

00:11:00.494 --> 00:11:02.062 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Wait a minute,

00:11:02.196 --> 00:11:04.566 position:13% line:83% align:start
are you secretly mad at us
for going shopping without you?

00:11:04.698 --> 00:11:06.066 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SARASA]
No way.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.235 position:13% line:83% align:start
Himeji always gets hung up
on stuff like this,

00:11:08.369 --> 00:11:09.436 position:30% line:89% align:start
it's a pattern.

00:11:09.571 --> 00:11:11.772 position:10% line:83% align:start

Hm.

Very good.

Apologies for the delay, Master.

00:11:39.266 --> 00:11:40.801 position:7% line:89% align:start
Please, just hold on a moment.

What, what's happening to me?

00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:50.010 position:13% line:83% align:start
All I can hear is the sound
of the shower pattering.

00:11:50.144 --> 00:11:51.812 position:27% line:83% align:start
And all I can see
is the painting of Mount Fuji

on the wall,

00:11:53.214 --> 00:11:55.149 position:16% line:83% align:start

Well, then, I think it's time.

How's the temperature?

flirting with Master?

we're running into each other.

Does it count as destiny

I know you have exchanged
Device IDs,

but a software connection
is not nearly the same

00:12:59.179 --> 00:13:00.948 position:16% line:89% align:start
as a preordained kinship.

Man, frock-blocked by Shirayuki.
But you know what?

Your tacit territoriality

Yup, I know them both.

[HIROTO]
Yeah, seems like it.

00:13:30.645 --> 00:13:32.479 position:24% line:83% align:start
With their instant
memorization skills

00:13:32.614 --> 00:13:34.181 position:10% line:89% align:start

Sounds good.
I can get on board with that.

00:14:49.423 --> 00:14:51.860 position:7% line:83% align:start
Though your language could use
some work, Transfer.

00:14:51.992 --> 00:14:53.227 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
I have a lot of respect for you,

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.829 position:19% line:89% align:start
so let's keep it civil.

00:14:54.962 --> 00:14:56.397 position:33% line:89% align:start
Say, Himeji.

00:14:56.531 --> 00:14:58.633 position:16% line:83% align:start
They've already released
the basic rules, haven't they?

00:14:58.767 --> 00:15:00.300 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:15:00.434 --> 00:15:02.604 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's a large-scale game adhering
to operational regulations,

00:15:02.737 --> 00:15:05.439 position:33% line:83% align:start
and it allows
for up to 100 players.

00:15:05.973 --> 00:15:09.042 position:35% line:83% align:start
"Area Steal
To Reconquer All Lost."

00:15:09.176 --> 00:15:11.679 position:7% line:83% align:start
Going by the initialism ASTRAL,
for short.

00:15:12.279 --> 00:15:13.882 position:24% line:83% align:start
The game will last
from Monday, May 9th

00:15:14.014 --> 00:15:15.482 position:19% line:89% align:start
until Friday, May 13th.

00:15:15.884 --> 00:15:18.586 position:19% line:83% align:start
Each day has one period
from 9:00 until noon,

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.054 position:24% line:83% align:start
and a second period
from 2:00 until 5:00.

00:15:21.188 --> 00:15:22.791 position:35% line:83% align:start
That's ten,
split over five days.

00:15:22.923 --> 00:15:25.459 position:7% line:83% align:start
The competition will take place
in District Zero,

00:15:25.593 --> 00:15:26.994 position:19% line:83% align:start
the Special Development
District,

00:15:27.127 --> 00:15:28.429 position:10% line:89% align:start
at the center of the island.

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:31.900 position:7% line:83% align:start
Our game field will be divided
into one million spaces.

00:15:32.032 --> 00:15:34.903 position:13% line:83% align:start
Key points known as "Bases"
will be scattered randomly.

00:15:35.302 --> 00:15:37.639 position:27% line:83% align:start
These bases will,
of course, be capturable.

00:15:38.338 --> 00:15:39.741 position:16% line:89% align:start
Two captures make a line.

00:15:39.874 --> 00:15:40.909 position:21% line:89% align:start
Three make a polygon.

00:15:41.408 --> 00:15:43.343 position:30% line:83% align:start
All the spaces
within these connected points

00:15:43.477 --> 00:15:45.412 position:33% line:83% align:start
become a part
of the owner's team's area,

00:15:45.547 --> 00:15:47.882 position:30% line:83% align:start
and will change
to the associated color.

00:15:48.015 --> 00:15:49.349 position:35% line:89% align:start
Every hour,

00:15:49.483 --> 00:15:50.885 position:19% line:83% align:start
the bases will release
special usable skills,

00:15:51.018 --> 00:15:53.153 position:24% line:83% align:start
hereafter referred
to as "spells."

00:15:53.555 --> 00:15:56.724 position:5% line:83% align:start
The game also uses what is known
as a "Freeze Time" system.

00:15:56.858 --> 00:15:59.193 position:21% line:83% align:start
Meaning, essentially,
that after you use a spell,

00:15:59.326 --> 00:16:00.895 position:24% line:83% align:start
you cannot perform
another action

00:16:01.028 --> 00:16:02.095 position:21% line:89% align:start
for a short duration.

00:16:02.229 --> 00:16:03.464 position:16% line:89% align:start
The length of Freeze Time

00:16:03.598 --> 00:16:05.065 position:33% line:83% align:start
is calculated
from the movement value

00:16:05.199 --> 00:16:07.234 position:19% line:83% align:start
specifically attributed
to each player.

00:16:07.367 --> 00:16:09.904 position:7% line:83% align:start
There are five player positions
you can assume in ASTRAL,

00:16:10.037 --> 00:16:13.140 position:19% line:83% align:start
but no overlap of roles
is permitted within a team.

00:16:13.273 --> 00:16:15.342 position:5% line:83% align:start
To win, you must either dominate
all the areas

00:16:15.476 --> 00:16:17.344 position:7% line:89% align:start
or destroy all the other teams.

00:16:17.879 --> 00:16:20.748 position:24% line:83% align:start
However, if neither
of these conditions is met,

00:16:20.882 --> 00:16:23.718 position:16% line:83% align:start
victory goes to the team
with the largest occupied area

00:16:23.852 --> 00:16:25.085 position:19% line:89% align:start
when the time runs out.

00:16:25.219 --> 00:16:27.187 position:30% line:83% align:start
Now, moving on
to the loss conditions.

00:16:27.589 --> 00:16:29.356 position:21% line:83% align:start
Each player possesses
life points,

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:32.459 position:10% line:83% align:start
and if all of those are lost,
the player is eliminated.

00:16:32.594 --> 00:16:35.462 position:13% line:83% align:start
Players can have a maximum
of five life points.

00:16:35.597 --> 00:16:37.665 position:35% line:83% align:start
These reset
at the end of each period.

00:16:38.265 --> 00:16:40.133 position:24% line:83% align:start
If all team members
are eliminated,

00:16:40.267 --> 00:16:42.570 position:24% line:83% align:start
or if a team loses
all of their spaces,

00:16:42.704 --> 00:16:44.371 position:16% line:89% align:start
that team is eliminated.

00:16:44.806 --> 00:16:46.306 position:5% line:89% align:start
During the Inter-Academy Battle,

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:50.110 position:13% line:83% align:start
another game entitled MTCG
will be held simultaneously.

00:16:50.612 --> 00:16:52.246 position:7% line:89% align:start
The top prize is a "Wild Card",

00:16:52.379 --> 00:16:54.916 position:33% line:83% align:start
which serves
as an invitation to ASTRAL.

00:16:55.048 --> 00:16:56.350 position:13% line:89% align:start
The player who secures this

00:16:56.483 --> 00:16:58.118 position:30% line:83% align:start
is able to join
any team of their choosing

00:16:58.252 --> 00:16:59.621 position:24% line:89% align:start
as a sixth member,

00:16:59.754 --> 00:17:02.155 position:19% line:83% align:start
allowing for an element
of unpredictability.

00:17:02.289 --> 00:17:04.726 position:7% line:83% align:start
The three most valuable pieces
of information

00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:06.260 position:16% line:89% align:start
we should be focusing on

00:17:06.393 --> 00:17:09.664 position:10% line:83% align:start
are areas, player positions,
and movement values.

00:17:09.797 --> 00:17:10.798 position:33% line:89% align:start
Interesting.

00:17:10.932 --> 00:17:12.534 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hey, Shirayuki,

00:17:12.667 --> 00:17:14.434 position:7% line:83% align:start
is there any way for us to see
what the movement values are?

00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:16.169 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI] If you open
the purpose-made app

00:17:16.303 --> 00:17:17.437 position:16% line:89% align:start
released a few days ago,

00:17:17.572 --> 00:17:19.273 position:24% line:83% align:start
it should be listed
on your profile.

00:17:19.406 --> 00:17:20.808 position:10% line:89% align:start
There are 25 levels overall,

00:17:20.942 --> 00:17:23.076 position:10% line:83% align:start
and the smaller your number,
the better.

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:24.311 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Movement values

00:17:24.444 --> 00:17:26.014 position:38% line:83% align:start
are like
a player's general rating.

00:17:26.146 --> 00:17:29.149 position:7% line:83% align:start
They're calculated using stuff
like game and trial records.

00:17:29.283 --> 00:17:30.885 position:5% line:89% align:start
Of course, for me, that means...

00:17:31.019 --> 00:17:32.754 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NANASE]
Three? That's crazy!

00:17:32.887 --> 00:17:34.689 position:10% line:83% align:start
Talk about a top-tier rating,
Shino!

00:17:34.822 --> 00:17:37.057 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Good job, Seven Star!
-Yeah, thank you.

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:38.760 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Hang on, "Shino"?
-[NANASE] Hm.

00:17:38.893 --> 00:17:41.194 position:7% line:83% align:start
Just a little nickname for you.
No good?

00:17:41.328 --> 00:17:42.630 position:27% line:83% align:start
After the things
I've been called,

00:17:42.764 --> 00:17:43.898 position:24% line:89% align:start
that's pretty tame.

00:17:44.032 --> 00:17:44.933 position:27% line:89% align:start
Then "yes" good.

00:17:45.733 --> 00:17:47.802 position:24% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Naturally,
my movement value is a lie.

00:17:47.936 --> 00:17:50.872 position:13% line:83% align:start
My real number's not three,
it's nineteen.

00:17:51.005 --> 00:17:52.306 position:16% line:89% align:start
Kagaya bugged the screen

00:17:52.439 --> 00:17:53.942 position:21% line:83% align:start
to display something
a little more fitting.

00:17:54.074 --> 00:17:57.477 position:13% line:83% align:start
Now, I'd like us to decide
on a general plan of action.

00:17:57.845 --> 00:18:00.648 position:16% line:83% align:start
There are two key avenues
of strategy in ASTRAL.

00:18:00.782 --> 00:18:03.051 position:30% line:83% align:start
You either win
by expanding your area

00:18:03.183 --> 00:18:04.919 position:35% line:83% align:start
or you make
the other teams lose.

00:18:05.053 --> 00:18:06.788 position:21% line:83% align:start
However, since spells
are required to fight,

00:18:06.921 --> 00:18:08.823 position:24% line:83% align:start
you have to expand
your region of control,

00:18:08.957 --> 00:18:10.592 position:35% line:89% align:start
regardless.

00:18:10.725 --> 00:18:13.360 position:7% line:83% align:start
Plainly stated, both objectives
are inextricably intertwined.

00:18:13.895 --> 00:18:15.362 position:5% line:89% align:start
That leads us to the next topic.

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:19.099 position:16% line:83% align:start
Team makeup, and deciding
who takes what position.

00:18:19.767 --> 00:18:21.636 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
Here's the role breakdowns.

00:18:22.804 --> 00:18:24.572 position:16% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Getting assigned
the right position here

00:18:24.706 --> 00:18:26.007 position:30% line:89% align:start
is everything.

00:18:26.139 --> 00:18:28.076 position:21% line:83% align:start
The wrong designation
could expose me in a heartbeat.

00:18:28.208 --> 00:18:30.078 position:35% line:83% align:start
Basically,
if I don't get commander,

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:31.012 position:30% line:89% align:start
it's all over.

00:18:31.144 --> 00:18:32.279 position:24% line:89% align:start
For everyone else,

00:18:32.412 --> 00:18:33.681 position:33% line:83% align:start
that massive
movement restriction

00:18:33.815 --> 00:18:34.882 position:24% line:89% align:start
could be crippling.

00:18:35.016 --> 00:18:36.350 position:19% line:89% align:start
But for me, it's a role

00:18:36.483 --> 00:18:38.251 position:16% line:83% align:start
that conveniently renders
my base rank redundant

00:18:38.385 --> 00:18:39.821 position:10% line:89% align:start
for the purpose of mobility.

00:18:39.954 --> 00:18:41.288 position:13% line:89% align:start
Helping me avoid suspicion.

00:18:41.421 --> 00:18:43.323 position:35% line:83% align:start
I can hide
my own low movement value

00:18:43.457 --> 00:18:45.093 position:19% line:83% align:start
behind the commander's
worse one.

00:18:45.459 --> 00:18:47.962 position:30% line:83% align:start
Any other role
would be catastrophic for me.

00:18:48.096 --> 00:18:51.164 position:10% line:83% align:start
It'd be obvious that my stats
aren't what I say they are.

00:18:51.966 --> 00:18:53.266 position:10% line:89% align:start
Plus if I get the commander,

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.435 position:10% line:83% align:start
I can use its info abilities
as a smoke screen

00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:57.204 position:10% line:89% align:start
for Company-fed information.

00:18:57.337 --> 00:18:59.406 position:30% line:83% align:start
That'd give me
a considerable advantage.

00:18:59.941 --> 00:19:03.711 position:19% line:83% align:start
Let's see, I'm thinking
soldier's probably my best fit.

00:19:04.144 --> 00:19:06.714 position:7% line:83% align:start
I've got great natural reflexes
and visual acuity,

00:19:06.848 --> 00:19:08.783 position:38% line:83% align:start
so acting
as our offensive vanguard

00:19:08.916 --> 00:19:09.884 position:33% line:89% align:start
works for me.

00:19:10.018 --> 00:19:11.786 position:10% line:89% align:start
Then I think I'll be the spy.

00:19:11.919 --> 00:19:13.320 position:13% line:89% align:start
That one's perfect for me.

00:19:13.453 --> 00:19:15.657 position:30% line:83% align:start
Sneaking around
and secretly setting up traps

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:16.758 position:27% line:89% align:start
is my specialty.

00:19:16.891 --> 00:19:18.826 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
All right, it's looking good.

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:20.427 position:13% line:89% align:start
We're almost in the clear.

00:19:20.561 --> 00:19:22.396 position:44% line:83% align:start
Next,
I'll nab the commander position,

00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:24.565 position:30% line:83% align:start
and then Himeji
can take the guardian one.

00:19:25.265 --> 00:19:26.567 position:30% line:89% align:start
So I'll take--

00:19:26.701 --> 00:19:27.735 position:21% line:83% align:start
-[SHINJI] Commander.
-[HIROTO, SHIRAYUKI] Huh?

00:19:28.402 --> 00:19:29.904 position:13% line:89% align:start
I wish to be the commander.

00:19:30.538 --> 00:19:32.840 position:19% line:83% align:start
You want it too, right,
Shinohara?

00:19:33.775 --> 00:19:36.944 position:44% line:83% align:start
I do.
But just why are you after it?

00:19:37.078 --> 00:19:38.211 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's obvious.

00:19:38.345 --> 00:19:40.114 position:35% line:83% align:start
If we lack
a competent commander,

00:19:40.247 --> 00:19:42.449 position:27% line:83% align:start
victory in ASTRAL
is an impossibility.

00:19:42.583 --> 00:19:45.352 position:16% line:83% align:start
If that's your reasoning,
then I'm the clear choice here.

00:19:45.485 --> 00:19:46.954 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHINJI]
No, you aren't.

00:19:47.088 --> 00:19:50.124 position:21% line:83% align:start
See, the commander's
movement value is fixed at 25.

00:19:50.257 --> 00:19:51.626 position:19% line:83% align:start
You have a lower value
than I do,

00:19:51.759 --> 00:19:53.193 position:30% line:83% align:start
so you would be
more disadvantaged

00:19:53.326 --> 00:19:54.762 position:27% line:89% align:start
by the handicap.

00:19:54.896 --> 00:19:57.364 position:10% line:83% align:start
Also, duties of the commander
involve intel gathering,

00:19:57.497 --> 00:19:59.366 position:13% line:89% align:start
analysis, and coordination.

00:19:59.499 --> 00:20:01.069 position:16% line:83% align:start
These are all specialties
of mine.

00:20:01.201 --> 00:20:02.970 position:27% line:83% align:start
Do you get that,
transfer student?

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:06.140 position:13% line:83% align:start
The only clear choice here
is me. Not you.

00:20:06.273 --> 00:20:07.909 position:7% line:89% align:start
Stop being so stubborn, Shinji.

00:20:08.042 --> 00:20:10.945 position:21% line:83% align:start
Shino can use insane
Unique Star abilities you can't.

00:20:11.079 --> 00:20:13.181 position:7% line:83% align:start
He's the highest-ranked player
on the island.

00:20:13.313 --> 00:20:14.849 position:33% line:89% align:start
And honestly,

00:20:14.982 --> 00:20:16.584 position:7% line:83% align:start
I really don't want to be stuck
taking orders from you.

00:20:16.718 --> 00:20:18.485 position:21% line:83% align:start
Personal preferences
have nothing to do with it,

00:20:18.619 --> 00:20:20.955 position:33% line:83% align:start
this is just
about what's most appropriate.

00:20:21.589 --> 00:20:22.857 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Think!

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:25.258 position:5% line:83% align:start
You have to deceive your enemies
and your allies.

00:20:25.392 --> 00:20:26.761 position:27% line:83% align:start
You have to make
every last one of them

00:20:26.894 --> 00:20:29.063 position:16% line:83% align:start
believe in the reputation
you've created.

00:20:29.197 --> 00:20:30.397 position:33% line:89% align:start
If you don't,

00:20:30.531 --> 00:20:31.733 position:21% line:83% align:start
this team falls apart
at the seams,

00:20:31.866 --> 00:20:33.868 position:27% line:83% align:start
and all your lies
will be laid bare.

00:20:35.036 --> 00:20:36.403 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Yo, Enomoto.

00:20:36.537 --> 00:20:38.238 position:24% line:83% align:start
Quite a forward way
of addressing your senior,

00:20:38.371 --> 00:20:39.372 position:30% line:89% align:start
but what is it?

00:20:39.907 --> 00:20:41.676 position:24% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Commander
can trade places with someone

00:20:41.809 --> 00:20:42.510 position:30% line:89% align:start
once per game.

00:20:42.944 --> 00:20:44.746 position:16% line:83% align:start
So, how about you let me
take it first?

00:20:45.345 --> 00:20:47.749 position:10% line:83% align:start
And, if my performance fails
to meet your standards,

00:20:47.882 --> 00:20:50.585 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'll surrender the position
to you without complaint.

00:20:51.652 --> 00:20:52.887 position:38% line:89% align:start
Curious.

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:55.056 position:13% line:83% align:start
I could counter by offering
the same deal in reverse,

00:20:55.189 --> 00:20:57.125 position:27% line:89% align:start
but I'll accept,

00:20:57.257 --> 00:20:58.458 position:27% line:89% align:start
on the condition

00:20:58.593 --> 00:20:59.560 position:27% line:83% align:start
that you take out
three enemy commanders

00:20:59.694 --> 00:21:01.229 position:10% line:89% align:start
by the end of the third day.

00:21:01.361 --> 00:21:02.630 position:24% line:89% align:start
Fail in that task,

00:21:02.764 --> 00:21:04.832 position:21% line:83% align:start
and you'll hand over
the position to me.

00:21:04.966 --> 00:21:06.366 position:21% line:89% align:start
Wait, Mister Enomoto.

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:09.003 position:7% line:83% align:start
Don't you think that condition
would be somewhat exploitable?

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:11.506 position:16% line:83% align:start
You could easily sabotage
his progress

00:21:11.639 --> 00:21:13.641 position:27% line:83% align:start
just by refusing
to cooperate with him.

00:21:13.775 --> 00:21:16.110 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's Shirayuki Himeji, right?

00:21:16.244 --> 00:21:17.645 position:7% line:89% align:start
Your foresight is commendable,

00:21:17.779 --> 00:21:19.514 position:24% line:83% align:start
but it appears that
you're forgetting something.

00:21:19.647 --> 00:21:21.949 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh, forgetting something?

00:21:22.382 --> 00:21:23.718 position:35% line:89% align:start
My motive.

00:21:23.851 --> 00:21:25.452 position:24% line:83% align:start
As Eimei Academy's
student council president,

00:21:25.586 --> 00:21:27.655 position:13% line:83% align:start
my only real ambition here
is to win.

00:21:27.789 --> 00:21:30.357 position:44% line:83% align:start
See,
in the annual academy rankings,

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:32.927 position:24% line:83% align:start
Eimei's been stuck
in fifth place for years.

00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:35.395 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'd like to see
our status elevated.

00:21:35.897 --> 00:21:37.632 position:7% line:89% align:start
With Seven Star Shinohara here,

00:21:37.765 --> 00:21:39.834 position:21% line:83% align:start
we have a good chance
of doing that this year.

00:21:39.967 --> 00:21:42.069 position:38% line:83% align:start
As such,
I would do absolutely nothing

00:21:42.203 --> 00:21:43.237 position:30% line:89% align:start
to hinder him.

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:44.972 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Okay. Good enough for me.

00:21:45.106 --> 00:21:47.374 position:27% line:83% align:start
You have my word,
if I can't pull this off,

00:21:47.508 --> 00:21:49.143 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'll give the commander's role
to you.

00:21:50.244 --> 00:21:53.313 position:19% line:83% align:start
And I'll talk properly
for the rest of my life.

00:21:54.282 --> 00:21:55.482 position:30% line:89% align:start
[phone ringing]

00:21:56.017 --> 00:21:57.084 position:27% line:83% align:start
-[HIROTO] Hello?
-[SARASA] <i>Uh...</i>

00:21:57.218 --> 00:21:58.485 position:21% line:89% align:start
 <i>Shinohara? Oh, good.</i>

00:21:58.619 --> 00:22:00.021 position:16% line:83% align:start
 <i>If you hadn't answered,</i>
 <i>I don't know</i>

00:22:00.154 --> 00:22:01.155 position:19% line:83% align:start
 <i>-what I would've done.</i>
-[HIROTO] What's up?

00:22:01.289 --> 00:22:02.223 position:16% line:89% align:start
You sound kind of upset.

00:22:02.355 --> 00:22:03.356 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SARASA]
 <i>Of course I am!</i>

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:05.159 position:13% line:89% align:start
 <i>We're in serious trouble!</i>

00:22:05.293 --> 00:22:07.228 position:27% line:89% align:start
Trouble? How so?

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:08.763 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SARASA]
 <i>It's Sarasa!</i>

00:22:08.896 --> 00:22:10.598 position:10% line:83% align:start
 <i>And I'm not talking about me</i>
 <i>or the original.</i>

00:22:10.731 --> 00:22:13.701 position:16% line:83% align:start
 <i>A third Sarasa Saionji's</i>
 <i>just revealed herself!</i>

00:22:13.835 --> 00:22:15.603 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh... Ah?
