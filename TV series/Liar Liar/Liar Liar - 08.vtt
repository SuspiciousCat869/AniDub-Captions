[SARASA]
How are you all doing?

00:00:10.945 --> 00:00:12.312 position:10% line:89% align:start
This is the Empress speaking.

00:00:12.446 --> 00:00:14.949 position:27% line:83% align:start
What do you think
she's trying to pull with this?

00:00:15.082 --> 00:00:17.384 position:27% line:83% align:start
Dunno, but I get
the buzz around her.

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:18.887 position:19% line:89% align:start
She could be your twin.

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.655 position:21% line:83% align:start
[SARASA] Apparently,
they've taken to calling her

00:00:20.788 --> 00:00:21.623 position:30% line:89% align:start
a doppelganger.

00:00:21.756 --> 00:00:23.357 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.193 position:5% line:83% align:start
I hope you're watching, fake me,
'cause this message is for you.

00:00:26.326 --> 00:00:29.029 position:10% line:83% align:start
You know that name you stole
from me? Sarasa Saionji?

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:30.330 position:30% line:89% align:start
I want it back.

00:00:30.464 --> 00:00:33.735 position:10% line:89% align:start
So how about we play a game.

00:00:33.868 --> 00:00:35.335 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Uh!
-A game?

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:39.641 position:24% line:83% align:start
The setting will be
the upcoming contest in ASTRAL.

00:00:39.774 --> 00:00:43.243 position:16% line:83% align:start
And the condition to win?
Defeat Hiroto Shinohara.

00:00:43.377 --> 00:00:44.646 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:46.413 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:00:46.548 --> 00:00:48.683 position:7% line:83% align:start
[SARASA] Whoever beats him gets
to be the real Sarasa Saionji

00:00:48.816 --> 00:00:50.384 position:30% line:89% align:start
going forward.

00:00:50.518 --> 00:00:53.353 position:10% line:83% align:start
If I win, you surrender your
Sarasa Saionji account to me,

00:00:53.487 --> 00:00:54.989 position:24% line:89% align:start
no questions asked.

00:00:55.122 --> 00:00:57.057 position:7% line:83% align:start
If you win, you get to carry on
being the much-loved,

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.325 position:21% line:89% align:start
much-adored Empress.

00:00:58.458 --> 00:00:59.894 position:16% line:89% align:start
And should Shinohara win,

00:01:00.028 --> 00:01:02.462 position:10% line:83% align:start
then I'll submit to whatever
justice he feels is fair.

00:01:02.597 --> 00:01:04.666 position:30% line:83% align:start
I would suggest
you also consider that

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.968 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm pretty much repping
your skin right now.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.736 position:24% line:89% align:start
And if you refuse,

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.371 position:10% line:83% align:start
these clothes are gonna start
to feel unbearably restrictive.

00:01:11.506 --> 00:01:12.574 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Aah!
-Aah!

00:01:12.707 --> 00:01:14.474 position:27% line:83% align:start
Who could resist
a show like that?

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:16.778 position:5% line:89% align:start
Their Empress, being so naughty.

00:01:16.911 --> 00:01:19.681 position:16% line:83% align:start
And who could really say
if it's me or you?

00:01:19.814 --> 00:01:21.481 position:38% line:89% align:start
[cooing]

00:01:21.616 --> 00:01:24.284 position:27% line:83% align:start
I sincerely hope
you make the right choice.

00:01:26.854 --> 00:01:31.059 position:33% line:89% align:start
[BOTH shout]

00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:33.260 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SARASA]
I'm gonna rip her head off!

00:01:33.393 --> 00:01:35.228 position:38% line:83% align:start
Hey now,
let's just take it easy.

00:01:35.362 --> 00:01:38.365 position:33% line:89% align:start
[sighs] Good.

00:01:38.498 --> 00:01:41.970 position:10% line:83% align:start
Uh! All right. Kurahashi has
something to do with this.

00:01:42.102 --> 00:01:43.437 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yeah, right.

00:01:43.571 --> 00:01:45.506 position:13% line:83% align:start
Kurahashi has to know that
I helped you fight

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.676 position:19% line:83% align:start
against Akizuki in the
All-Campus Elimination Battle.

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.779 position:16% line:83% align:start
He could have figured out
that we're on the same side,

00:01:51.913 --> 00:01:53.447 position:19% line:89% align:start
it wouldn't take much.

00:01:53.581 --> 00:01:56.884 position:13% line:83% align:start
Then, I guess. he's coming
after us both this time. Huh?

00:01:57.018 --> 00:01:58.485 position:35% line:89% align:start
Good grief.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.355 position:21% line:83% align:start
Rotten scumbag. Seems
he doesn't know when to quit.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.817 position:16% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Please help us,
Kagaya! I'm begging you!

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.318 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KAGAYA]
So. lemme get this straight.

00:03:38.452 --> 00:03:39.887 position:21% line:83% align:start
You need to crush it
as the commander

00:03:40.021 --> 00:03:42.289 position:7% line:83% align:start
so your comrades won't realize
you're a complete fraud,

00:03:42.422 --> 00:03:43.991 position:27% line:83% align:start
while bumping off
three team leaders

00:03:44.125 --> 00:03:45.425 position:7% line:89% align:start
and preparing to go toe-to-toe

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.227 position:21% line:83% align:start
with a mega-dangerous
doppelganger, right?

00:03:47.695 --> 00:03:49.063 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Pretty much.

00:03:49.197 --> 00:03:51.199 position:24% line:83% align:start
You ever been told
that you're a drama magnet?

00:03:51.331 --> 00:03:54.535 position:27% line:83% align:start
Also, he must be
victorious in ASTRAL.

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:56.738 position:27% line:83% align:start
Members of teams
who place sixth or lower

00:03:56.871 --> 00:03:59.372 position:10% line:83% align:start
all have one Star taken away
from them.

00:03:59.507 --> 00:04:02.342 position:10% line:89% align:start
If I lose one star, I'm done.

00:04:02.844 --> 00:04:04.011 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm!

00:04:04.812 --> 00:04:08.683 position:7% line:83% align:start
What's more, a new rule's just
been announced by way of Libra.

00:04:08.816 --> 00:04:09.884 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm!

00:04:10.017 --> 00:04:11.753 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
It involves a voting system.

00:04:11.886 --> 00:04:13.821 position:13% line:83% align:start
All students on the island
will be tasked

00:04:13.955 --> 00:04:16.824 position:13% line:83% align:start
with voting for the academy
they believe will win.

00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:19.193 position:7% line:83% align:start
And those support ratings will
have some kind of effect

00:04:19.326 --> 00:04:20.795 position:5% line:89% align:start
on the players' movement values?

00:04:20.928 --> 00:04:23.531 position:19% line:83% align:start
It does, but that only
takes effect in the last half.

00:04:23.664 --> 00:04:25.133 position:24% line:83% align:start
In the first half,
it's positions

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:27.535 position:13% line:89% align:start
and abilities that matter.

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:29.436 position:13% line:89% align:start
Well, the Company can defo

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.271 position:7% line:83% align:start
take care of the position side
of things,

00:04:31.404 --> 00:04:33.007 position:30% line:83% align:start
and I can patch
the retrieved data

00:04:33.141 --> 00:04:34.242 position:10% line:89% align:start
through to you in real time.

00:04:34.374 --> 00:04:35.643 position:19% line:89% align:start
How's that sound, dude?

00:04:35.777 --> 00:04:36.711 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah!

00:04:36.844 --> 00:04:37.945 position:30% line:89% align:start
As to the rest

00:04:38.079 --> 00:04:39.847 position:21% line:83% align:start
we ought to consider
which abilities to equip.

00:04:39.981 --> 00:04:41.448 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right.

00:04:41.582 --> 00:04:43.885 position:7% line:83% align:start
In my first slot, I'll be going
with the Indigo Star's ability,

00:04:44.018 --> 00:04:44.852 position:33% line:89% align:start
Black Wings.

00:04:44.986 --> 00:04:45.987 position:30% line:89% align:start
In the second,

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.722 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll use the Green Star's
Predict Movement.

00:04:47.855 --> 00:04:48.689 position:27% line:89% align:start
And for my third.

00:04:48.823 --> 00:04:51.592 position:13% line:89% align:start
[gasps] I'm still thinking.

00:04:51.726 --> 00:04:53.161 position:19% line:89% align:start
What about you Himeji?

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:57.064 position:16% line:83% align:start
Huh! Something I've been
saving for a special occasion.

00:04:57.198 --> 00:04:58.498 position:33% line:89% align:start
Special, huh?

00:04:58.633 --> 00:05:01.502 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yes. An assistant utility
that allows players

00:05:01.636 --> 00:05:03.871 position:24% line:83% align:start
to swap an ability
with each other.

00:05:04.005 --> 00:05:05.338 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's called Replacement.

00:05:05.472 --> 00:05:06.808 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'll need to have
the company procure it

00:05:06.941 --> 00:05:08.876 position:33% line:83% align:start
for me given
it's exorbitant price tag.

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.879 position:16% line:83% align:start
Though I'm sure we'll get
our money's worth out of it.

00:05:12.013 --> 00:05:13.981 position:33% line:89% align:start
[BOTH laugh]

00:05:16.617 --> 00:05:18.318 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SARASA]
 <i>Gotcha.</i>

Hm, nothing to do now but wait.

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.927 position:5% line:83% align:start
[SARASA] <i>Still, this whole thing</i>
 <i>is kinda depressing.</i>

00:05:26.694 --> 00:05:28.129 position:21% line:89% align:start
The whole Ouka team,

00:05:28.262 --> 00:05:30.565 position:10% line:83% align:start
they just keep staring at me
with stars in their eyes.

00:05:30.698 --> 00:05:32.767 position:16% line:83% align:start
Thought you would be used
to that by now.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.102 position:5% line:83% align:start
But I'll be around them non-stop
during the event,

00:05:35.236 --> 00:05:37.605 position:27% line:83% align:start

I'll get is when I'm asleep.

00:05:38.105 --> 00:05:40.440 position:30% line:83% align:start
And I won't get
to talk to you 'til it's done.

00:05:41.175 --> 00:05:42.610 position:47% line:89% align:start

00:07:08.262 --> 00:07:10.031 position:16% line:89% align:start
Teams from all academies.

00:07:10.164 --> 00:07:12.633 position:16% line:83% align:start
Stand by your designated
starting points.

00:07:14.502 --> 00:07:16.938 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
All right. Game on.

00:07:17.071 --> 00:07:19.106 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHINJI]
See that? Right there?

00:07:19.874 --> 00:07:21.976 position:27% line:83% align:start
That emblem marks
our preliminary base.

00:07:22.109 --> 00:07:24.278 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:07:24.412 --> 00:07:25.713 position:30% line:89% align:start
[NANASE laughs]

00:07:25.846 --> 00:07:28.849 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SHINJI] Now, to the left.
A neutral base.

00:07:29.884 --> 00:07:31.185 position:24% line:83% align:start
We'll have to seize
control of it

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:32.620 position:24% line:89% align:start
to expand our area.

00:07:32.753 --> 00:07:34.956 position:7% line:89% align:start
Shall we go take it, Commander?

00:07:35.089 --> 00:07:36.424 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:07:36.557 --> 00:07:38.458 position:10% line:83% align:start
Ha, ha, ha! It almost sounds
like we're about to do something

00:07:38.592 --> 00:07:40.561 position:13% line:89% align:start
reprehensible, doesn't it?

00:07:40.695 --> 00:07:43.297 position:41% line:83% align:start
-What?
-No, it's only a base.

00:07:43.431 --> 00:07:45.333 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:48.302 position:16% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] All right, we're
in range of the neutral base.

00:07:48.436 --> 00:07:51.005 position:19% line:89% align:start
Understood, proceeding.

00:07:52.206 --> 00:07:53.473 position:41% line:89% align:start
Occupy.

00:07:53.607 --> 00:07:55.509 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:07:55.643 --> 00:07:57.244 position:21% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Once you use
the Occupy command,

00:07:57.378 --> 00:07:58.612 position:16% line:89% align:start
Freeze Time takes effect,

00:07:58.746 --> 00:08:00.948 position:5% line:83% align:start
rendering all your other actions
unusable.

00:08:01.449 --> 00:08:02.583 position:38% line:89% align:start
[beeping]

00:08:03.217 --> 00:08:06.187 position:7% line:83% align:start
Then, when the timer runs out,
the space is occupied.

00:08:10.157 --> 00:08:11.959 position:30% line:89% align:start
[ALL exclaims]

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:16.230 position:35% line:83% align:start
So. Himeji,
your movement is a nine, right?

00:08:16.364 --> 00:08:18.966 position:7% line:83% align:start
Yes, and since the Freeze Time
counter displayed

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.002 position:10% line:89% align:start
ninety seconds on activation,

00:08:21.135 --> 00:08:24.372 position:5% line:83% align:start
occupying must require ten times
your movement value.

00:08:24.505 --> 00:08:26.474 position:27% line:83% align:start
That could hinder
rate of expansion.

00:08:27.141 --> 00:08:30.044 position:21% line:83% align:start
No, the capture-delay
is the least of it.

00:08:30.177 --> 00:08:32.313 position:27% line:83% align:start
Losing abilities
is the real problem.

00:08:32.446 --> 00:08:34.849 position:30% line:83% align:start
Think about it,
if you're attacked in battle

00:08:34.982 --> 00:08:38.052 position:21% line:83% align:start
whilst on cool-down,
you're essentially helpless.

00:08:38.185 --> 00:08:40.688 position:16% line:83% align:start
Then, we should test out
the standard Freeze Time.

00:08:41.222 --> 00:08:45.126 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh, me! I'd be more
than happy to try it out.

00:08:45.259 --> 00:08:46.527 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm!

00:08:46.994 --> 00:08:48.963 position:44% line:83% align:start
[NOA]
How about Numerical Adjustment.

00:08:49.096 --> 00:08:52.700 position:10% line:83% align:start
I can increase your interest
in me by a factor of a trillion.

00:08:52.833 --> 00:08:55.403 position:10% line:83% align:start
I imagine that falls outside
of Device scope.

00:08:55.536 --> 00:08:56.904 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:08:57.038 --> 00:08:59.340 position:7% line:83% align:start
[NOA] Okay, so the Freeze Time
is six seconds,

00:08:59.473 --> 00:09:01.942 position:5% line:83% align:start
and given that my movement value
is also a six,

00:09:02.076 --> 00:09:04.879 position:13% line:83% align:start
I think it's safe to assume
that they're correlated.

00:09:05.012 --> 00:09:06.347 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Even that modest of a number

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.816 position:16% line:83% align:start
would be a major handicap
in the middle of a fight.

00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:11.318 position:30% line:83% align:start
Yeah, but then
Hiroto would, like,

00:09:11.452 --> 00:09:13.487 position:7% line:89% align:start
totally have to come rescue me.

00:09:13.621 --> 00:09:16.023 position:19% line:83% align:start
There's one more thing
you should all be aware of.

00:09:16.157 --> 00:09:17.358 position:38% line:89% align:start
[beeping]

00:09:17.491 --> 00:09:18.926 position:5% line:89% align:start
When you're in your team's area,

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:21.729 position:10% line:83% align:start
looks like your base movement
value drops by two.

00:09:22.696 --> 00:09:24.799 position:30% line:83% align:start
So, the greater
our occupied area,

00:09:24.932 --> 00:09:26.567 position:21% line:83% align:start
the greater our range
of optimal mobility.

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:28.636 position:10% line:89% align:start
Hmm! That sounds right to me.

00:09:28.769 --> 00:09:30.905 position:13% line:83% align:start
Uh! There might actually be
more to him

00:09:31.038 --> 00:09:33.274 position:30% line:83% align:start
than just hype
and hot air, after all.

00:09:33.407 --> 00:09:36.377 position:10% line:83% align:start
All right. I've ran a search
on the space around us.

00:09:37.011 --> 00:09:39.146 position:13% line:83% align:start
Knowing where the bases are
should make strategizing

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:40.648 position:27% line:89% align:start
a little easier.

00:09:40.781 --> 00:09:43.184 position:13% line:83% align:start
Then I think it's high-time
we got this show on the road.

00:09:43.317 --> 00:09:46.887 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yeah. Our nearest targets
are to the north and the east.

00:09:47.021 --> 00:09:49.323 position:7% line:89% align:start
East would be our best option.

00:09:49.457 --> 00:09:52.326 position:33% line:83% align:start
As I see it,
base placement isn't random.

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:55.663 position:19% line:83% align:start
Logic dictates they be
spaced out equidistantly

00:09:55.796 --> 00:09:57.264 position:10% line:89% align:start
for the entertainment factor.

00:09:57.965 --> 00:10:00.569 position:24% line:83% align:start
We can extrapolate
from the positions we know of.

00:10:01.168 --> 00:10:02.937 position:27% line:83% align:start
Given our western
starting point,

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:05.507 position:10% line:83% align:start
it stands to reason that east
would be the most efficient path

00:10:05.639 --> 00:10:07.108 position:24% line:89% align:start
of area expansion.

00:10:07.241 --> 00:10:08.442 position:38% line:89% align:start
Seems so.

00:10:08.577 --> 00:10:11.078 position:13% line:83% align:start
Now, we should keep in mind
the spells bases release

00:10:11.212 --> 00:10:12.613 position:27% line:89% align:start
in set intervals.

00:10:12.746 --> 00:10:15.382 position:21% line:83% align:start
See, there's a bit of
a fuss with them.

00:10:16.217 --> 00:10:19.019 position:21% line:83% align:start
Spells first go into
the 'Team Slot' sub menu.

00:10:19.153 --> 00:10:22.524 position:7% line:83% align:start
To use one, you have to move it
to a personal ability slot.

00:10:23.023 --> 00:10:25.259 position:21% line:83% align:start
So, try to keep track
of what you're using.

00:10:25.392 --> 00:10:26.794 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uh-huh!

00:10:26.927 --> 00:10:28.963 position:16% line:83% align:start
But we can probably just
pick whatever to start off.

00:10:29.096 --> 00:10:31.732 position:27% line:83% align:start
So better hurry,
'cause I'm picking now.

00:10:31.866 --> 00:10:33.602 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NANASE]
Hey, come on, that's no fair!

00:10:33.734 --> 00:10:34.969 position:24% line:89% align:start
Leave some for me.

00:10:35.669 --> 00:10:38.839 position:10% line:83% align:start
Hey, how long do you suppose
Freeze Time lasts for spells?

00:10:38.973 --> 00:10:40.641 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm about to find that out!

00:10:41.175 --> 00:10:42.910 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'll try taking a swipe at you,
Shinji.

00:10:43.043 --> 00:10:46.147 position:21% line:83% align:start
Whoa, Nanase, you are
not swinging a blade at me.

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:47.549 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, yeah?

00:10:47.681 --> 00:10:48.816 position:10% line:83% align:start
'Cause I'd bet you'd actually
love getting murdered

00:10:48.949 --> 00:10:50.317 position:30% line:89% align:start
by a cute girl.

00:10:50.451 --> 00:10:52.621 position:13% line:83% align:start
While I can't quite dispute
your basic thesis,

00:10:52.753 --> 00:10:54.556 position:16% line:83% align:start
your vector leaves a lot
to be desired.

00:10:54.688 --> 00:10:56.023 position:16% line:89% align:start
Now I am gonna kill you.

00:10:56.157 --> 00:10:58.259 position:33% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Huh?
Hey, Akizuki. Where's Himeji?

00:10:59.326 --> 00:11:00.127 position:44% line:83% align:start
[NOA]
What?

00:11:00.261 --> 00:11:02.229 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Uh!
-Uh!

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.032 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hi. Guess who?

00:11:05.166 --> 00:11:07.334 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Himeji. That you?

00:11:07.468 --> 00:11:08.537 position:35% line:89% align:start
[BOTH Gasp]

00:11:08.669 --> 00:11:11.005 position:7% line:89% align:start
Yes. I was trying out a spell,

00:11:11.138 --> 00:11:12.973 position:13% line:83% align:start
one rather fittingly named
"Conceal".

00:11:13.107 --> 00:11:15.843 position:7% line:83% align:start
The Freeze Time it's displaying
is eighteen seconds.

00:11:15.976 --> 00:11:17.546 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's twice my movement.

00:11:17.678 --> 00:11:19.847 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh, wow, no kidding.

00:11:20.481 --> 00:11:22.082 position:21% line:89% align:start
Master? Are you okay?

00:11:22.216 --> 00:11:24.285 position:24% line:83% align:start
Sorry. Have I done
something wrong?

00:11:25.052 --> 00:11:26.854 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
No, I'm the one in the wrong.

00:11:26.987 --> 00:11:29.123 position:16% line:83% align:start
What part of 'bad vector'
don't you get?

00:11:29.256 --> 00:11:31.058 position:21% line:83% align:start
Do I need to grab you
a dictionary?

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:46.440 position:35% line:83% align:start
[KUGASAKI]
Well, well. Hiroto Shinohara.

00:11:47.141 --> 00:11:48.242 position:38% line:89% align:start
Curious.

00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:50.911 position:13% line:83% align:start
You're an obliging nemesis,
I must say,

00:11:51.045 --> 00:11:53.847 position:27% line:83% align:start
slithering on out
in front of the waiting axe.

00:11:53.981 --> 00:11:56.717 position:13% line:83% align:start
Look, I'm not here for you,
ya vampire wannabe.

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:59.086 position:16% line:83% align:start
Grandstand all you want,
Seven Star.

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:02.089 position:24% line:83% align:start
My team from Otowa
will humble you soon enough.

00:12:02.223 --> 00:12:04.593 position:19% line:89% align:start
Retribution is at hand.

00:12:04.725 --> 00:12:08.162 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:12:08.295 --> 00:12:09.964 position:7% line:89% align:start
Otowa's over in District Eight.

00:12:10.097 --> 00:12:11.832 position:21% line:83% align:start
Mister Kugasaki leads
their team,

00:12:11.966 --> 00:12:15.503 position:7% line:83% align:start
it's made up of members of his
Self-Made Holy Knight Brigade.

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:20.140 position:10% line:83% align:start
The zealotry Mister Kugasaki
inspires is impressive.

00:12:20.274 --> 00:12:23.811 position:7% line:83% align:start
I believe his team will be one
of our greatest threats.

00:12:23.944 --> 00:12:25.379 position:19% line:89% align:start
And who are the others?

00:12:25.513 --> 00:12:28.882 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well. District Seven,
there's Shinra High School.

00:12:29.016 --> 00:12:31.720 position:16% line:83% align:start
They have a particularly
hostile school culture.

00:12:31.885 --> 00:12:33.688 position:5% line:89% align:start
Last year, they placed in third.

00:12:33.821 --> 00:12:36.156 position:27% line:83% align:start
Their star player
is Mister Touya Kirigaya.

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:38.459 position:13% line:83% align:start
He's a Six Star embodiment
of the maxim,

00:12:38.593 --> 00:12:40.194 position:10% line:89% align:start
'the ends justify the means'.

00:12:40.327 --> 00:12:42.363 position:13% line:89% align:start
Goes by "Absolute Monarch".

00:12:42.496 --> 00:12:44.431 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHINJI]
He's a special breed, that one.

00:12:45.132 --> 00:12:47.736 position:24% line:83% align:start
His modus operandi
is to pulverize his foe

00:12:47.868 --> 00:12:49.738 position:27% line:83% align:start
with an onslaught
of violent tactics.

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:51.472 position:16% line:83% align:start
I know of several people
who simply quit

00:12:51.606 --> 00:12:54.108 position:24% line:83% align:start
and left the island
after they played him.

00:12:54.241 --> 00:12:55.677 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Seriously?

00:12:55.809 --> 00:12:59.079 position:13% line:83% align:start
Speaking of. That girl over
there is trouble, too.

00:13:00.447 --> 00:13:03.017 position:30% line:83% align:start
Senri Kururugi,
from District Sixteen.

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:05.119 position:35% line:83% align:start
The leader
of Tsuyuri Girl's Academy.

00:13:05.252 --> 00:13:07.388 position:13% line:89% align:start
She's an absolute monster.

00:13:07.522 --> 00:13:09.423 position:13% line:83% align:start
Should you ever cross paths
with her,

00:13:09.557 --> 00:13:10.924 position:16% line:89% align:start
just turn around and run.

00:13:11.058 --> 00:13:12.793 position:30% line:89% align:start
Okay, what for?

00:13:12.926 --> 00:13:16.230 position:24% line:83% align:start
Her special ability
is beyond nefarious.

00:13:16.731 --> 00:13:18.600 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's called One-Shot Kill.

00:13:18.733 --> 00:13:19.967 position:13% line:89% align:start
If the conditions are met,

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.902 position:21% line:83% align:start
the ability can fell
any opponent

00:13:22.036 --> 00:13:23.337 position:19% line:89% align:start
in but a single sweep.

00:13:24.639 --> 00:13:26.641 position:16% line:89% align:start
With her hellish nature,

00:13:26.775 --> 00:13:30.978 position:16% line:83% align:start
she's earned the infernal
moniker of 'Demon Maiden'.

00:13:31.579 --> 00:13:32.980 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:13:33.113 --> 00:13:34.448 position:13% line:83% align:start
[KURURUGI] Thank you kindly
for the compliment.

00:13:34.582 --> 00:13:36.050 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hmm! Oh!

00:13:36.183 --> 00:13:38.553 position:16% line:83% align:start
Although, don't you think
your delivery's a little off?

00:13:38.687 --> 00:13:41.388 position:16% line:83% align:start
Words get awfully muffled
behind one's back.

00:13:41.523 --> 00:13:44.726 position:13% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] Crap! Crap! Crap!
Why's this chick got a sword?

00:13:44.858 --> 00:13:46.628 position:16% line:89% align:start
I've heard about you too.

00:13:46.761 --> 00:13:48.128 position:16% line:89% align:start
The up-jumped Seven Star

00:13:48.262 --> 00:13:50.331 position:13% line:83% align:start
with a reality-transcending
ability.

00:13:50.464 --> 00:13:53.601 position:7% line:83% align:start
Granting you a winning strategy
against any opponent.

00:13:53.735 --> 00:13:56.003 position:24% line:83% align:start
You graduated from
an American college at five,

00:13:56.136 --> 00:13:57.505 position:10% line:89% align:start
and endured inhumane training

00:13:57.639 --> 00:14:02.176 position:27% line:83% align:start
to imbue you with
superhuman skill or so they say.

00:14:02.309 --> 00:14:03.310 position:41% line:89% align:start
I what?

00:14:03.444 --> 00:14:05.346 position:16% line:83% align:start
Where's that information
coming from?

00:14:05.479 --> 00:14:07.848 position:19% line:83% align:start
A Libra media article,
where else?

00:14:07.981 --> 00:14:09.584 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Damn it, Kazami.

00:14:09.718 --> 00:14:13.387 position:10% line:83% align:start
Know this. It doesn't matter
how strong you are.

00:14:13.521 --> 00:14:15.055 position:27% line:89% align:start
Tsuyuri will win.

00:14:17.625 --> 00:14:20.662 position:19% line:83% align:start
Talk about a collection
of second-rate players.

00:14:20.795 --> 00:14:21.895 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:14:22.429 --> 00:14:23.997 position:38% line:89% align:start
[huffing]

00:14:25.533 --> 00:14:26.701 position:24% line:89% align:start
Those three aside,

00:14:26.835 --> 00:14:29.002 position:24% line:83% align:start
the player we have
to be most on-guard against

00:14:29.136 --> 00:14:31.438 position:7% line:89% align:start
is obviously that doppelganger.

00:14:32.741 --> 00:14:33.907 position:21% line:89% align:start
Owing to the scandal

00:14:34.041 --> 00:14:36.143 position:16% line:83% align:start
with the recently ousted
Mikado Kurahashi,

00:14:36.276 --> 00:14:38.379 position:19% line:83% align:start
Seijo's been prevented
from participating.

00:14:38.513 --> 00:14:41.148 position:33% line:83% align:start
Allowing her
to somehow snatch their spot.

00:14:41.281 --> 00:14:43.518 position:30% line:83% align:start
Whoever she is,
she's clearly unhinged.

00:14:43.651 --> 00:14:45.854 position:5% line:83% align:start
Picking a fight with the Empress
and roping you in.

00:14:46.019 --> 00:14:47.488 position:16% line:89% align:start
We'd do well to be wary.

00:14:47.622 --> 00:14:48.623 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:14:51.392 --> 00:14:52.694 position:44% line:83% align:start
[ALL]
Thank you for the meal.

00:14:53.528 --> 00:14:55.929 position:30% line:83% align:start
Now, let's talk
who's roomin' with who.

00:14:56.063 --> 00:14:58.633 position:27% line:83% align:start
I mean, obviously
me and Hiroto's a given.

00:14:58.767 --> 00:15:00.234 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hmm-mm!

00:15:00.367 --> 00:15:01.368 position:38% line:89% align:start
Whatever.

00:15:01.503 --> 00:15:03.838 position:19% line:83% align:start
Except for not sharing
with Nanase.

00:15:03.971 --> 00:15:05.439 position:27% line:83% align:start
I don't have much
of a preference.

00:15:05.573 --> 00:15:07.941 position:27% line:83% align:start
Sure sounds like
a preference to me.

00:15:08.075 --> 00:15:09.577 position:13% line:89% align:start
What? I'm not good enough?

00:15:09.711 --> 00:15:12.379 position:13% line:83% align:start
Blondes don't do it for ya
the same as silvers or reds,

00:15:12.514 --> 00:15:13.447 position:35% line:89% align:start
jerk face?

00:15:13.581 --> 00:15:14.982 position:27% line:83% align:start
Exactly what are
you trying to imply?

00:15:15.115 --> 00:15:17.317 position:27% line:83% align:start
I see, but I fear
it's already been decided

00:15:17.451 --> 00:15:19.554 position:5% line:83% align:start
that Master and I are staying in
the same room,

00:15:19.687 --> 00:15:21.723 position:19% line:83% align:start
and if Akizuki insists
on joining us,

00:15:21.856 --> 00:15:24.458 position:30% line:83% align:start
would that not
then leave you two together?

00:15:24.592 --> 00:15:25.693 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hang on. What?

00:15:25.827 --> 00:15:27.494 position:33% line:83% align:start
If you think
I'm gonna bunk-up with Shinji,

00:15:27.629 --> 00:15:28.663 position:16% line:89% align:start
you're out of your mind!

00:15:28.797 --> 00:15:30.297 position:30% line:89% align:start
Got that right.

00:15:30.431 --> 00:15:32.366 position:10% line:83% align:start
The way she tosses and turns,
I'd never get to sleep.

00:15:32.499 --> 00:15:34.368 position:13% line:83% align:start
Hey! That was like way back
in grade school!

00:15:34.502 --> 00:15:37.605 position:7% line:83% align:start
You guys shared a room together
when you were in grade school?

00:15:37.739 --> 00:15:39.139 position:35% line:89% align:start
Scandalous.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.743 position:27% line:89% align:start
Come on, Hiroto!

00:15:41.876 --> 00:15:44.879 position:21% line:83% align:start
Let's get you in bed
with your Noa-sized body-pillow.

00:15:45.012 --> 00:15:47.649 position:7% line:83% align:start
Hey, if anyone's providing him
turndown service tonight,

00:15:47.782 --> 00:15:49.416 position:24% line:89% align:start
it'll be his Maid.

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:52.953 position:7% line:83% align:start
[SARASA] Let me set the record
straight for you idiots.

00:15:53.555 --> 00:15:56.056 position:30% line:83% align:start
The only option
for boys and girls.

00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:57.759 position:24% line:89% align:start
Is separate rooms!

00:15:57.892 --> 00:15:59.460 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh!

00:15:59.594 --> 00:16:01.696 position:38% line:89% align:start
[snores]

00:16:03.565 --> 00:16:05.966 position:7% line:89% align:start
Aw, damn, must have dozed off.

00:16:06.534 --> 00:16:08.168 position:30% line:89% align:start
Uh? A blanket?

00:16:12.874 --> 00:16:15.042 position:16% line:83% align:start
You actually a nice guy,
Enomoto?

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:17.311 position:16% line:89% align:start
Uh! I should take a bath.

00:16:20.949 --> 00:16:22.483 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uh-hmm!

00:16:22.617 --> 00:16:23.984 position:47% line:89% align:start
Uh!

00:16:27.454 --> 00:16:28.590 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uh-ah!

00:16:29.223 --> 00:16:30.925 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUMUGI]
Almost.

00:16:31.058 --> 00:16:32.627 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.630 position:7% line:83% align:start
If that's how it is, then I'll
have to use my secret power.

00:16:35.763 --> 00:16:37.397 position:38% line:89% align:start
[yelling]

00:16:37.532 --> 00:16:38.900 position:30% line:83% align:start
-[HIROTO] Here.
-Uh!

00:16:39.032 --> 00:16:43.505 position:38% line:83% align:start
Take it,
just don't go jumping. See ya.

00:16:44.037 --> 00:16:46.240 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Um!
-Um.

00:16:46.373 --> 00:16:49.911 position:30% line:83% align:start
Shouldn't I say
thank you very much?

00:16:50.043 --> 00:16:51.713 position:10% line:89% align:start
Guess you could if you want.

00:16:51.846 --> 00:16:55.315 position:13% line:83% align:start
Um. Sorry if that was a bit
of a weird question to ask.

00:16:55.449 --> 00:16:57.050 position:19% line:83% align:start
I just don't wanna risk
offending anybody

00:16:57.184 --> 00:16:58.352 position:27% line:89% align:start
on my first day.

00:16:58.485 --> 00:17:00.087 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're a cautious one,
aren't you?

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:02.122 position:21% line:83% align:start
Do you mind if I ask
what you're doing here?

00:17:02.624 --> 00:17:06.126 position:16% line:83% align:start
Doing? What? Do you mean,
like, my raison d'Ãªtre?

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:07.294 position:41% line:89% align:start
Raison.

00:17:07.427 --> 00:17:09.864 position:13% line:89% align:start
Maybe not quite that deep.

00:17:09.998 --> 00:17:12.667 position:5% line:83% align:start
Look, this place has been booked
for a private event.

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.836 position:35% line:83% align:start
You must be
a middle schooler, right?

00:17:14.969 --> 00:17:16.236 position:7% line:89% align:start
You're a bit too young to play.

00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:18.071 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh, um, you know.

00:17:18.205 --> 00:17:19.774 position:10% line:89% align:start
I kind of already am playing.

00:17:19.908 --> 00:17:21.543 position:5% line:89% align:start
My sister works for Libra media,

00:17:21.676 --> 00:17:24.044 position:13% line:83% align:start
and she thought it would be
good for me if I participated

00:17:24.177 --> 00:17:27.180 position:27% line:89% align:start
in the MTCG. See?

00:17:27.314 --> 00:17:28.850 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
A room key?

00:17:28.983 --> 00:17:30.718 position:44% line:89% align:start
MTCG.

00:17:30.852 --> 00:17:32.119 position:10% line:89% align:start
Isn't that the optional game

00:17:32.252 --> 00:17:34.522 position:21% line:83% align:start
that's being held at
the same time as ASTRAL?

00:17:35.122 --> 00:17:37.692 position:27% line:83% align:start
You okay getting
back to your room alone?

00:17:37.825 --> 00:17:39.359 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Yeah, but.
-Uh!

00:17:39.493 --> 00:17:41.963 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh, hey, your eye's red.

00:17:42.095 --> 00:17:44.866 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hmm! It's a colored co...

00:17:44.999 --> 00:17:48.435 position:30% line:83% align:start
That is to say,
it's the mark of the chosen one.

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:51.039 position:38% line:83% align:start
Just some
cool destiny stuff, you know?

00:17:51.171 --> 00:17:54.509 position:30% line:83% align:start
There, you see?
Heterochromia. Impressed?

00:17:54.642 --> 00:17:57.110 position:10% line:89% align:start
[laughs] Yeah. I'm impressed.

00:17:57.244 --> 00:18:00.147 position:10% line:89% align:start
Really? You are? Yeah! Sweet!

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:02.016 position:27% line:83% align:start
Did I mention my
right eye's also magical?

00:18:02.149 --> 00:18:05.152 position:10% line:83% align:start
It has the power to see into
both the past and the future!

00:18:05.285 --> 00:18:06.588 position:33% line:83% align:start
And right now
it's letting me see that

00:18:06.721 --> 00:18:09.122 position:10% line:83% align:start
you're a real special person
too, mister!

[giggles]

00:18:10.858 --> 00:18:14.829 position:16% line:83% align:start
Huh! Sounds like a pretty
overactive eye. See you later.

00:18:14.963 --> 00:18:16.363 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hey, hang on.

00:18:17.364 --> 00:18:18.700 position:30% line:89% align:start
Please, mister,

00:18:18.833 --> 00:18:20.568 position:21% line:83% align:start
can you come and play
with me for a little bit?

00:18:20.702 --> 00:18:22.235 position:47% line:89% align:start
Uh!

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:25.105 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUMUGI]
Whoa, you're so strong!

00:18:25.238 --> 00:18:27.140 position:16% line:89% align:start
Whoa, you're so skilled!

00:18:27.274 --> 00:18:29.309 position:21% line:89% align:start
Whoa, you're so fast!

00:18:29.443 --> 00:18:31.713 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:18:31.846 --> 00:18:33.781 position:13% line:83% align:start
This little one would make
a perfect familiar

00:18:33.915 --> 00:18:35.883 position:35% line:83% align:start
for someone
with power like mine, right?

00:18:36.017 --> 00:18:40.487 position:7% line:83% align:start
All right, Lloyd. look this way
and gaze deep into my right eye.

00:18:40.622 --> 00:18:42.155 position:7% line:89% align:start
You are now bound to my service

00:18:42.289 --> 00:18:44.358 position:21% line:83% align:start
until such a time as
I release you.

00:18:44.491 --> 00:18:45.994 position:13% line:89% align:start
You already gave it a name?

Aw! Yes! Yes! Yes!
You're like seriously the best!

00:18:54.201 --> 00:18:55.670 position:35% line:89% align:start
You think?

00:18:56.871 --> 00:19:00.207 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Voila, your loyal familiar.
-I can have it?

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:02.010 position:13% line:89% align:start
Thank you so much, mister!

[exclaims]

00:19:06.146 --> 00:19:08.315 position:33% line:89% align:start
Oof, sleepy.

00:19:08.448 --> 00:19:10.618 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Uh!
-Hey, easy.

00:19:10.752 --> 00:19:12.553 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:19:16.456 --> 00:19:20.227 position:19% line:83% align:start
Come on four-one-five.
Four-one-five. Huh?

00:19:24.866 --> 00:19:26.000 position:33% line:89% align:start
There you go.

00:19:26.134 --> 00:19:28.036 position:33% line:89% align:start
[gasps] Huh?

00:19:29.103 --> 00:19:32.607 position:19% line:83% align:start
Uh! You have seriously
got to eat better than this.

00:19:34.374 --> 00:19:35.943 position:13% line:89% align:start
There is a buffet you know.

00:19:36.077 --> 00:19:37.310 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUMUGI]
I wanna try it.

00:19:37.444 --> 00:19:38.880 position:19% line:89% align:start
All right, then try it.

00:19:39.013 --> 00:19:40.347 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUMUGI]
But I'm comfy.

00:19:41.381 --> 00:19:44.819 position:10% line:83% align:start
Hey, mister, can you go down
and get me some dinner, please?

00:19:44.952 --> 00:19:47.555 position:38% line:83% align:start
Oh, well,
I guess I've come this far.

00:19:47.689 --> 00:19:52.292 position:19% line:89% align:start
[sighs] I'll wait here.

00:19:53.995 --> 00:19:55.328 position:41% line:89% align:start

00:20:01.002 --> 00:20:02.837 position:13% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO] On the second day
of the competition,

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:06.007 position:5% line:83% align:start
we finally ran into another team
as we made our way east.

00:20:06.908 --> 00:20:10.611 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm the Ibara Academy lead,
Kanade Yuikawa.

00:20:10.745 --> 00:20:12.847 position:30% line:83% align:start
How's about you
and I form an Alliance?

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:14.247 position:41% line:89% align:start
A what?

00:20:14.381 --> 00:20:15.983 position:19% line:89% align:start
Look friend, truth is.

00:20:16.117 --> 00:20:18.953 position:13% line:83% align:start
We'd be perfectly satisfied
just making it to the top five,

00:20:19.087 --> 00:20:21.923 position:19% line:83% align:start
the easier time we have
of doing that the better.

00:20:22.056 --> 00:20:24.592 position:7% line:83% align:start
You saw the Temporary Alliance
command, right?

00:20:24.726 --> 00:20:27.195 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's a mutual non-hostility
agreement.

00:20:27.327 --> 00:20:28.896 position:7% line:89% align:start
No invading each other's areas.

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:32.066 position:10% line:83% align:start
You can set a penalty for if
anyone breaks it.

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:33.634 position:50% line:89% align:start

00:20:33.768 --> 00:20:35.970 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
This guy, what's his game?

00:20:36.104 --> 00:20:37.370 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh!

00:20:37.505 --> 00:20:39.372 position:35% line:89% align:start
[ALL sigh]

00:20:39.507 --> 00:20:40.775 position:44% line:83% align:start
[NOA]
Mya?

00:20:40.908 --> 00:20:42.375 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
Miss Asamiya?

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:44.645 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHINJI]
Nanase! Why?

00:20:44.779 --> 00:20:48.315 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well, uh, that's 'cause, he, uh.

00:20:48.448 --> 00:20:50.283 position:16% line:89% align:start
Look! I'll explain later!

00:20:51.284 --> 00:20:52.720 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hey! Wait!

00:20:52.854 --> 00:20:56.389 position:19% line:83% align:start
Oh dear, what a shame.
Negotiations are over. Ah, well.

00:20:56.524 --> 00:21:00.561 position:13% line:83% align:start
Huh! I can't believe this.
I better go help her out.

00:21:00.695 --> 00:21:03.064 position:5% line:89% align:start
Nanase! Don't just swing at him!

00:21:03.197 --> 00:21:04.532 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NANASE]
I know what I'm doing!

00:21:04.665 --> 00:21:06.134 position:24% line:83% align:start
[SHINJI] Then stop
blocking my line of sight!

00:21:06.266 --> 00:21:08.136 position:13% line:83% align:start
[NANASE] Or you could like,
you know, aim properly!

00:21:08.268 --> 00:21:09.837 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.442 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SHINJI] Why did you open
fire on them, Nanase?

00:21:15.576 --> 00:21:18.746 position:7% line:83% align:start
-Because, that guy back there.
-Save it.

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:20.347 position:33% line:83% align:start
Do you think
you get some kind of pass

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.783 position:13% line:89% align:start
just because we beat them?

00:21:21.916 --> 00:21:23.450 position:7% line:89% align:start
Did you even weigh up the odds?

00:21:23.584 --> 00:21:24.852 position:24% line:83% align:start
Consider what might
have happened to you

00:21:24.986 --> 00:21:26.687 position:24% line:83% align:start
before you charged
into an enemy area?

00:21:26.821 --> 00:21:29.257 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, come on man. That's enough.

00:21:29.389 --> 00:21:30.992 position:13% line:89% align:start
It was the same last year.

00:21:31.125 --> 00:21:35.328 position:7% line:83% align:start
Uncoordinated nonsense makes us
easy pickings for a lesser team.

00:21:35.462 --> 00:21:36.998 position:19% line:89% align:start
We aren't here for fun!

00:21:37.131 --> 00:21:40.367 position:5% line:83% align:start
And I refuse to let your blatant
stupidity drag us all down.

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:43.470 position:13% line:89% align:start
Why? I-I thought you would.

00:21:43.604 --> 00:21:45.239 position:16% line:89% align:start
Huh? Speak up, will you?

00:21:45.372 --> 00:21:49.577 position:13% line:83% align:start
Shut up! You stupid idiot!
Don't ever talk to me again!

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:51.045 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey!

00:21:51.179 --> 00:21:52.246 position:44% line:83% align:start
[NOA]
Mya, wait!

00:21:52.379 --> 00:21:53.681 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHIRAYUKI]
Miss Asamiya!

[SHINJI]
Shinohara.

00:21:56.884 --> 00:21:58.753 position:19% line:83% align:start
Give it to me straight,
am I the bad guy here?

00:21:58.886 --> 00:22:00.922 position:13% line:89% align:start
What you said wasn't wrong.

00:22:01.055 --> 00:22:04.357 position:38% line:83% align:start
Although,
that was not the way to say it.

00:22:04.992 --> 00:22:06.160 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:22:06.661 --> 00:22:09.030 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIROTO]
Our teamwork's a total mess.

00:22:09.163 --> 00:22:10.765 position:24% line:89% align:start
What am I gonna do?
