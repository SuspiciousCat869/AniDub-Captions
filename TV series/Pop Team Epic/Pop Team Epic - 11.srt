As I searched for my true self,

180
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:33,500
I discovered a memory:

181
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:37,125
Five years ago, Sosogu gave
her life and died in my place,

182
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,833
becoming the star I
always knew she was.

183
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:41,541
But thanks to Gaia's power,

184
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:44,208
I gave up all my
memories of Sosogu,

185
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:46,875
and in return, Gaia
brought her back to life.

186
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:48,916
Now, she's about to make
the ultimate sacrifice

187
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,791
and give her life for me again.

188

honor the sacred promise

As I searched for my true self,

I discovered a memory:

395
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:27,458
Five years ago, Sosogu gave
her life and died in my place,

396

becoming the star I
always knew she was.

But thanks to Gaia's power,

398
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:34,541
I gave up all my
memories of Sosogu,

399
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:37,208
and in return, Gaia
brought her back to life.

400
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:39,208
Now, she's about to make
the ultimate sacrifice

401
00:23:39,291 --> 00:23:41,125
and give her life for me again.

402
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:45,750
This time, I want to honor the
sacred promise I made to you.
