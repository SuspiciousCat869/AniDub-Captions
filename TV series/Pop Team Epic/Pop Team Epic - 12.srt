brought such dishonor upon us.

217
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,291
[KING A] I wonder,
back at the very beginning,

218
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,583
how were they able to
execute Infinite Break

impossible to stop them,

[KING C]
Yes.

223
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:17,958

to successfully use

224
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:21,041

on their story arc.

225
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,125
[KING A]
By all rights,

226
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:27,125

and be able to control them.

abnormal expansion.

230
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:35,958

And the Decoherence Xanadu

it happened in our reality.

[KING C] Yes, and not just
once, but continuously.

it was unthinkable.
