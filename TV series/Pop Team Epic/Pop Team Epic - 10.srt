00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,583
They've got some balls.

318
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:04,625
[POPUKO]
Oh, yeah.

319
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:05,875
I can't believe such
a horrible thing

320
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:08,250
could ever happen at our
quiet little inn, sir!

321
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:10,208
[TANAKA grunts]

322
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,208
Everyone just remain calm.

323
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,875
I'd like to start by
taking a statement

324
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,083
from each of you, please.

325
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:17,250
Hm? Who do you think you are?

326
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:18,833
Damn!

327
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:21,375
Looks like Mama's about to be
all up in everyone's business!

328
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:22,833
Uh. I know!

329
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:23,916
You're the killer, sir!

330
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,875
[TANAKA]
No! You've got it all wrong!

331
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:28,166
Popuko, don't be so
rude to the guests!

332
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,500
Ah!

333
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:35,416
Are you on your way
home from work?

334
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,458
[TANAKA]
Oh. Uh. Yes.

335
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:38,416
Or on your way home
from a murder?

336
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,833
Hey, don't interfere with
my investigation, lady!

337
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:43,666
On the rocks? Splash of water?

338
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,125
Or a splash of murder?

339
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,208
You moron!

340
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:56,458
Okay, what have you got to
share with me, forensics? Huh?

341
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:59,083
[PIPIMI] So tell me, what was
the murder weapon, babe?

342
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:01,208
Well, uh, some kinda
blunt object.

343
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:03,208
It only took one blow.

344
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:07,375
Get these two dummies
outta my crime scene!

345
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,250
I guess that's as
far as we'll get.

346
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:12,791
We're amateurs in their eyes.

347
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,625
I'll still tag
along and help you.

348
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:15,625
[PIPIMI]
Oh?

349
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,083
After all, Mama Pipi,

350
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:20,416
you are Kinshicho's
worst-nightmare busybody!

351
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,000
[chuckles]

352
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:26,125
Sure am. Thanks for the
compliment, Popuko.

353
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:29,083
Well, let's get to work
and solve this mother!

354
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,208
Roger that!

355
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:33,083
[PIPIMI] The killer is
still at large in the inn.

356
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:34,958
We've got to gather evidence.

357
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:39,000
[POPUKO] Sleuth Rule Number
One: Talk to a buncha people!

358
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:41,291
I recall that my late
husband used to get up

359
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:44,625
so many damn times in the middle
of the night because he...

360
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,500
You're getting killed next.

361
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:48,000
Oh!

362
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:50,000
Popuko, assemble
everyone at the inn.

363
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,375
I've figured it out!

364
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,208
I've solved the crime,
so get everyone together

365
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:55,083
so I can trick the killer
into confessing.

366
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:58,083
Ah! I totally get it!
You've solved the crime!

367
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:00,583
Hey, you coppers!
We've got an announcement!

368
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,750
[PIPIMI]
You look like Detective Moore.

369
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:06,875
Mama! Everyone's arrived.

370
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:09,250
Thank you. Popuko, love.

371
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,833
So, um, why did you
bring us here?

372
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:14,708
Don't tell me. You know who
the killer is? Tell me!

373
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:17,250
Uh, I didn't do it. I swear!

374
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:21,333
Now, now, quiet down.
Nobody needs to get too excited.

375
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:27,708
I started working in Ginza
a very long time ago,

376
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:30,958
back when this floundering
nation was still full of life.

377
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,416
Everywhere I looked
in those days,

378
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,708
the world seemed so
fresh and dazzling,

379
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:36,458
a feast for my senses.

380
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:38,625
I accepted Ginza at face value,

381
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:42,458
and Ginza accepted me in return,
without question or expectation.

382
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,083
[WOMAN B]
Ready?

383
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:47,625
[WOMEN] Congratulations on your
25th anniversary, Mama Pipimi!

384
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:48,333
This is for you.

385
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:49,458
Goodness gracious!

386
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,541
A little something
from all of us!

387
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,375
Mama, go take a load
off for a change.

388
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:57,291
Everyone, thank you so much!

389
00:20:57,375 --> 00:21:00,208
Mama, we're sending
Popuko to accompany you.

390
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:01,625
Huh? Me? For real?

391
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:02,875
You deserve it.

392
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,875
After all, you did make
top sales last month,

393
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,041
even as a rookie.

394
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:07,708
[WOMEN]
Have fun!

395
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,583
This trip was a gift
from my girls,

396
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:17,958
who are all like my daughters.

397
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:20,833
It's been spoiled by
a killer. What a drag.

398
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:24,250
Seriously? So you're saying
that this is all my fault?

399
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,291
[OTHERS gasp]

400
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:30,333
But how--? How was I supposed
to know who you really were?

401
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:34,125
That we had such
a legendary guest?

402
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,208
[PIPIMI] You're the murderer,
then, aren't you?

403
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:37,916
[HITOMI]
I couldn't forgive him!

404
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,208
Because of that man,
15 years ago, my father died.

405
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:45,750
I'm coming, Pop.
I'll be joining you very soon.

406
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:50,333
But Ginza is a mirror that
reflects the human soul.

407
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:53,375
Your death wouldn't do
anything to appease any soul.

408
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:56,083
Mama! I'm a terrible
woman who's taken a life!

409
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:57,583
I don't deserve to exist!

410
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:58,708
[PIPIMI]
Fool!

411
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:00,041
You know what you're called?

412
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:02,375
In Ginza, women like you
are called Damned Idiots!

413
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:05,083
[HIROMI]
I'm sorry.

414
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:06,375
I'm so sorry!

415
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:07,791
After you've done your time,

416
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:10,250
come by my place
for a stiff drink.

417
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:11,500
[HIROMI]
Huh?

418
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:13,875
One truth prevails, probably.

419
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:17,375
You'll find us in Kinshichou,
waiting to get drunk with you.

420

[PIPIMI]
Kinshichou Station.

422
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,166
Kinshichou. Doors are closing.

423
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,458
[POPUKO]
Damn it, I overslept!

424
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:27,708
[PIPIMI] Ha-ha! Too bad,
that was the last train!

425
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:40,125
[SOSOGU]
It's me, Sosogu Hoshifuri!

426
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:41,166
Oh, no!

427
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,041
Daichi wants to
find his true self,

428
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:45,541
so he's planning to
study abroad for a while.

429
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:47,041
We're going to have to be apart!
