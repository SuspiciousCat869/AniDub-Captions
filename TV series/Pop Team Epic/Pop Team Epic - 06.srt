playing it by the book.

the rear guard.

48

Expertly in attempt to
topple the rear guard?

49

As far as positional advantage,

the Queen is in quite
the jam at the present.

I'm the underdog.

And after just 73 moves,

00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:28,166
the winner this round
is Challenger Popuko.

55

Well, the Challenger, Popuko,
certainly was strong.

a worthy adversary.

Oh, wow, Sir Billion
Quadrillion has just shown up.

65
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,916
He's Number Two of
the Big Four of Shogi.

66
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,916
Yes, he's the current

68

This should be
interesting, indeed.

69
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,333
If he chooses the
static rook tactic,

70
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:11,500
then he'll open with a side
pawn capture, which--

Oh yeah, thanks for reminding
me about my new double eyelids.

of the Divine... Move.

91
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:22,458
The players you faced up
to this point were not real.

92
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:24,750
They were naught but holograms.

93
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:27,375
To create top players
made of flesh and blood,

94
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,708
then defeat them to
prove her supremacy.

That was Mother AI PP

I didn't know it
had come so far.

102
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,166
It seems that the AI
strategy depends largely

103
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,916
on controlling the
players themselves

104
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,583
to improve the game
of Shogi as a whole.

If he chooses the
