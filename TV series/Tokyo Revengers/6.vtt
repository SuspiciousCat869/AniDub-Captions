00:00:09.978 --> 00:00:12.045 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Draken] Wake up,
Mikey. We're here.

00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:15.148 position:27% line:83% align:start
What the hell are
you doing here?

00:00:15.182 --> 00:00:18.051 position:19% line:83% align:start
How dare you show your
faces here! Get out!

00:00:19.554 --> 00:00:22.155 position:19% line:83% align:start
Who do you think you're
talking to, old man?

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:23.825 position:10% line:89% align:start
(grunts) What are you doing?

00:00:23.858 --> 00:00:26.628 position:24% line:83% align:start
Chill out. We're
in the wrong here.

00:00:26.661 --> 00:00:29.363 position:27% line:89% align:start
(father sobbing)

00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:32.399 position:13% line:83% align:start
What did she ever do to you
to deserve such cruel abuse?

00:00:34.602 --> 00:00:37.070 position:30% line:89% align:start
(both sobbing)

00:00:39.473 --> 00:00:42.042 position:7% line:89% align:start
Soon we'll be fighting Moebius.

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:44.211 position:27% line:83% align:start
We'll deal with
our own problems,

00:00:44.244 --> 00:00:46.146 position:5% line:89% align:start
but it will be in our own world.

00:00:47.247 --> 00:00:49.383 position:19% line:83% align:start
All of our crew have
families and relatives

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:51.285 position:24% line:83% align:start
and people who are
important to them.

00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:54.589 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's not that you
have to bow your head.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.291 position:10% line:89% align:start
Just have a heart that cares.

00:00:58.826 --> 00:01:01.495 position:13% line:89% align:start
You're right. I apologize.

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:02.329 position:35% line:89% align:start
And, uh...

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:05.098 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm glad to have you by my side.

00:01:18.713 --> 00:01:22.149 position:19% line:89% align:start
(motor engine revving)

00:01:34.762 --> 00:01:36.263 position:19% line:89% align:start
Get Pah there tomorrow.

00:01:36.296 --> 00:01:39.166 position:7% line:89% align:start
No sweat. And I'll get Peh too.

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:41.201 position:24% line:83% align:start
The warehouse near
Second MS work?

00:01:42.537 --> 00:01:43.504 position:35% line:89% align:start
All right.

00:01:43.538 --> 00:01:44.539 position:47% line:89% align:start
Mm.

00:01:45.873 --> 00:01:49.242 position:19% line:89% align:start
(motor engine revving)

00:01:50.712 --> 00:01:51.713 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Mikey] See ya!

00:02:00.187 --> 00:02:03.490 position:19% line:89% align:start
(tense dramatic music)

00:02:07.327 --> 00:02:08.796 position:7% line:89% align:start
There's no way Mikey and Draken

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.099 position:10% line:89% align:start
would ever fight each other.

00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:14.301 position:24% line:83% align:start
But somehow, Draken
dies on August 3rd.

00:02:14.334 --> 00:02:16.236 position:24% line:83% align:start
I need to find out
everything I can

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:17.805 position:13% line:89% align:start
about Moebius before then.

00:02:20.808 --> 00:02:23.778 position:21% line:89% align:start
(opening theme music)

00:03:50.098 --> 00:03:52.600 position:24% line:89% align:start
(people chattering)

00:03:52.633 --> 00:03:55.335 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Draken] I was born in
Shibuya's red-light district.

00:03:56.504 --> 00:04:01.075 position:19% line:83% align:start
No idea who my dad was.
My mom was a prostitute.

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:03.010 position:7% line:89% align:start
She up and left when I was two.

00:04:03.978 --> 00:04:06.413 position:10% line:89% align:start
Home (scoffs) was a brothel.

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:10.051 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Deliveryman] Sign for
the towels, please.

00:04:10.084 --> 00:04:11.284 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Young Draken] Sure.

00:04:12.086 --> 00:04:14.387 position:7% line:89% align:start
You're getting tall, Kenny Boy.

00:04:14.421 --> 00:04:16.289 position:10% line:89% align:start
Well, I drink milk every day.

00:04:17.457 --> 00:04:19.694 position:16% line:89% align:start
Mhmm. See you next time.

00:04:19.727 --> 00:04:20.728 position:44% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:23.097 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Parlor Worker 1] Morning.

00:04:23.131 --> 00:04:24.098 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Deliveryman] Hi, girls.

00:04:24.132 --> 00:04:26.067 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Parlor Worker 2] Hi, mister.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.301 position:7% line:89% align:start
Off to school, huh, Kenny Boy?

00:04:28.335 --> 00:04:30.138 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Parlor Worker 1] Need a
quick tug before class?

00:04:30.171 --> 00:04:31.271 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Young Draken] Yeah, no thanks.

00:04:31.304 --> 00:04:32.940 position:33% line:89% align:start
See ya later!

00:04:32.974 --> 00:04:34.441 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Young Draken] Yeah.

00:04:34.474 --> 00:04:36.611 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Draken] That was my
fifth grade experience.

00:04:36.644 --> 00:04:39.379 position:10% line:83% align:start
I grew up around pink towels
and the smell of lube.

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.785 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Hi, Ken!
-Yeah, good morning!

00:04:43.818 --> 00:04:46.353 position:19% line:83% align:start
Good morning, Ken. It's
good to see you, sir!

00:04:50.558 --> 00:04:53.326 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's not Ken. My name is Draken.

00:04:55.163 --> 00:04:57.165 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Tattoo Artist] You
sure about this?

00:04:57.198 --> 00:04:58.966 position:19% line:89% align:start
You're damn right I am.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.368 position:13% line:89% align:start
Temples are pretty painful.

00:05:01.401 --> 00:05:02.904 position:10% line:89% align:start
Come on. Just do it already.

00:05:04.172 --> 00:05:05.873 position:21% line:89% align:start
All right. No cryin'.

00:05:07.108 --> 00:05:09.977 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Young Draken grunts)

00:05:10.011 --> 00:05:10.845 position:21% line:89% align:start
Let's get this goin'.

00:05:16.651 --> 00:05:18.318 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Young Draken] Ow ow ow ow ow!

00:05:18.351 --> 00:05:19.319 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Tattoo Artist] Oh,
quit your fussin'.

00:05:19.352 --> 00:05:21.923 position:19% line:89% align:start
You're a man, ain't ya?

00:05:21.956 --> 00:05:25.358 position:19% line:89% align:start
(Young Draken screams)

00:05:27.528 --> 00:05:29.831 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tattoo Artist] There, all done.

00:05:29.864 --> 00:05:32.967 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Young Draken gasps)

00:05:34.367 --> 00:05:37.071 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Young Draken sighs)

00:05:37.104 --> 00:05:40.942 position:13% line:89% align:start
All right! That is awesome!

00:05:40.975 --> 00:05:42.243 position:13% line:89% align:start
Tatted in the fifth grade.

00:05:42.276 --> 00:05:44.344 position:21% line:83% align:start
Damn you're gonna
be one rotten adult.

00:05:44.377 --> 00:05:46.948 position:19% line:83% align:start
Thank you, man. I gotta
go show this shit off!

00:05:48.783 --> 00:05:52.053 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's gonna take a while for
the swelling to go down.

00:05:52.086 --> 00:05:53.120 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yeah, okay. I got it.

00:05:55.056 --> 00:05:56.257 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Draken] I was taller than

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:57.725 position:24% line:83% align:start
most of the other
middle school kids.

00:05:59.994 --> 00:06:01.963 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Young Draken growls)

00:06:01.996 --> 00:06:03.463 position:24% line:89% align:start
(school boy grunts)

00:06:03.496 --> 00:06:06.100 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm Ken Ryuguji from
the Fourth Elementary.

00:06:06.133 --> 00:06:07.501 position:30% line:89% align:start
Call me Draken.

00:06:07.535 --> 00:06:10.538 position:13% line:83% align:start
You better hide whenever
you see this dragon coming.

00:06:12.573 --> 00:06:15.176 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Draken] I got a dragon
tattoo in the fifth grade.

00:06:15.209 --> 00:06:16.711 position:24% line:83% align:start
Even most of the
middle school kids

00:06:16.744 --> 00:06:18.411 position:24% line:83% align:start
wouldn't mess with
me after that.

00:06:21.616 --> 00:06:22.650 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ken.

00:06:22.683 --> 00:06:26.020 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're getting a bit too
cocky for me these days.

00:06:26.053 --> 00:06:28.522 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Gang Member 1] You need to
lay off the middle schoolers.

00:06:28.556 --> 00:06:30.490 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Gang Member 2] Don't make
us have to kick your ass.

00:06:30.524 --> 00:06:32.059 position:27% line:89% align:start
'Kay. Sorry, man.

00:06:32.093 --> 00:06:33.393 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Draken] The Sameyama Crew

00:06:33.426 --> 00:06:35.529 position:19% line:83% align:start
dominated this
neighborhood back then.

00:06:35.563 --> 00:06:38.431 position:19% line:83% align:start
They had literally beat
the pants off me before,

00:06:38.465 --> 00:06:40.568 position:16% line:89% align:start
so I couldn't defy them.

00:06:40.601 --> 00:06:43.070 position:21% line:83% align:start
(breathes sharply)
And you know who else

00:06:43.104 --> 00:06:44.605 position:19% line:89% align:start
is a cocky little shit?

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:46.974 position:16% line:89% align:start
That Seventh school punk.

00:06:47.008 --> 00:06:49.510 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Gang Member 3] Oh, Mikey.

00:06:49.543 --> 00:06:50.811 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Gang Member 2] The kid
who made a name for himself

00:06:50.845 --> 00:06:53.147 position:21% line:83% align:start
putting the beatdown
Vatican's boss?

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.183 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Sameyama grumbles)

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.422 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ken, drag Mikey's ass over here.

00:07:02.455 --> 00:07:05.693 position:19% line:83% align:start
(Young Draken panting)
Who is this kid?

00:07:05.726 --> 00:07:08.095 position:13% line:83% align:start
Even I don't think I could
take down a high schooler,

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:09.597 position:16% line:89% align:start
especially a strong one.

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:13.433 position:19% line:83% align:start
As soon as I take him
over there to Sameyama,

00:07:13.466 --> 00:07:14.535 position:33% line:89% align:start
he's a goner!

00:07:14.568 --> 00:07:15.770 position:16% line:89% align:start
But before that happens,

00:07:15.803 --> 00:07:18.105 position:24% line:83% align:start
I wanna throw hands
with Mikey myself!

00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:21.776 position:19% line:89% align:start
(Young Draken panting)

00:07:21.809 --> 00:07:22.810 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:07:25.478 --> 00:07:28.916 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hey, you! You from
Seventh Elementary?

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:30.418 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I am.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.153 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm looking for some
kid called Mikey.

00:07:32.186 --> 00:07:33.387 position:21% line:89% align:start
You know where he is?

00:07:33.421 --> 00:07:34.755 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I just saw him.

00:07:35.957 --> 00:07:37.490 position:30% line:89% align:start
Oh. Hey, Mikey!

00:07:41.062 --> 00:07:44.198 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Young Draken gulps)

00:07:47.935 --> 00:07:50.504 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yeah? What's up?

00:07:50.538 --> 00:07:53.708 position:21% line:83% align:start
Ah! That's not what I
was expecting at all!

00:07:53.741 --> 00:07:55.475 position:24% line:83% align:start
I figured he was a
buffed-out beast,

00:07:55.509 --> 00:07:56.811 position:24% line:89% align:start
way bigger than me.

00:07:56.844 --> 00:08:00.081 position:24% line:83% align:start
This dude's a runt!
He's just a kid!

00:08:00.114 --> 00:08:01.916 position:13% line:89% align:start
And he's coming over. Shit!

00:08:01.949 --> 00:08:02.750 position:24% line:89% align:start
Should I fight him?

00:08:05.252 --> 00:08:06.454 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey.

00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:08.089 position:24% line:83% align:start
There's a bunch of
the 48 positions

00:08:08.122 --> 00:08:09.557 position:16% line:89% align:start
that overlap, don't they?

00:08:10.191 --> 00:08:11.192 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uh...

00:08:14.695 --> 00:08:15.863 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:08:15.896 --> 00:08:18.933 position:13% line:83% align:start
I keep trying to count them
and I never even get to 40.

00:08:18.966 --> 00:08:20.334 position:30% line:89% align:start
Your thoughts?

00:08:20.368 --> 00:08:22.570 position:24% line:83% align:start
What? What are you
even talking about?

00:08:23.871 --> 00:08:25.439 position:33% line:89% align:start
Uh, anyway...

00:08:25.473 --> 00:08:27.208 position:21% line:89% align:start
You're Mikey, right?

00:08:28.309 --> 00:08:30.644 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I am. What's up?

00:08:30.678 --> 00:08:33.314 position:10% line:83% align:start
Some middle schoolers I know
wanted me to come find you

00:08:33.347 --> 00:08:34.815 position:21% line:89% align:start
and take you to 'em.

00:08:34.849 --> 00:08:35.616 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, yeah?

00:08:35.649 --> 00:08:38.185 position:7% line:89% align:start
I won't, um, force you though.

00:08:38.219 --> 00:08:39.286 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yeah, sure.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.521 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:08:40.554 --> 00:08:42.723 position:21% line:83% align:start
Since it's you that's
asking, sure, I'll go.

00:08:44.859 --> 00:08:46.560 position:24% line:83% align:start
Lemme stick my
stuff in my locker.

00:08:53.334 --> 00:08:54.835 position:19% line:89% align:start
What a frickin' weirdo.

00:08:54.869 --> 00:08:57.004 position:7% line:89% align:start
I don't even know how to react.

00:08:57.038 --> 00:08:59.373 position:19% line:83% align:start
I bet this pipsqueak is
gonna get the stuffing

00:08:59.407 --> 00:09:01.609 position:7% line:89% align:start
kicked out of him in a second.

00:09:06.013 --> 00:09:06.981 position:38% line:89% align:start
Yo, guys.

00:09:07.014 --> 00:09:08.015 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Hm?
-Huh?

00:09:09.383 --> 00:09:11.185 position:5% line:89% align:start
I brought the kid like you said.

00:09:11.218 --> 00:09:12.453 position:13% line:89% align:start
This is Mikey and he said-

00:09:12.486 --> 00:09:15.089 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Mikey whooshes)

00:09:15.122 --> 00:09:16.490 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Draken] At that moment,

00:09:16.525 --> 00:09:18.726 position:21% line:83% align:start
Mikey made a beeline
for Sameyama...

00:09:22.897 --> 00:09:23.697 position:35% line:89% align:start
And jumped.

00:09:25.032 --> 00:09:27.868 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Sameyama groans)

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:31.705 position:27% line:89% align:start
(everyone gasps)

00:09:38.379 --> 00:09:41.582 position:24% line:89% align:start
(upbeat rock music)

00:09:42.783 --> 00:09:47.054 position:13% line:83% align:start
So what do some mama's boys
who like to gang up on kids

00:09:47.088 --> 00:09:48.523 position:33% line:89% align:start
want with me?

00:09:48.557 --> 00:09:52.760 position:16% line:89% align:start
(gang members trembling)

00:09:52.793 --> 00:09:54.728 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Sameyama gurgling)

00:09:54.762 --> 00:09:57.131 position:21% line:83% align:start
My name's Mikey from
Seventh Elementary.

00:09:58.299 --> 00:09:59.667 position:35% line:89% align:start
Holy shit!

00:10:01.235 --> 00:10:03.671 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're Draken from
Fourth Elementary, right?

00:10:04.573 --> 00:10:06.874 position:7% line:89% align:start
So why would a badass like you

00:10:06.907 --> 00:10:09.110 position:21% line:83% align:start
wanna hang out with
those pieces of shit?

00:10:11.912 --> 00:10:14.115 position:13% line:89% align:start
So let's be friends, Kenny!

00:10:14.148 --> 00:10:15.149 position:30% line:89% align:start
What do ya say?

00:10:17.418 --> 00:10:20.688 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Young Draken sighs)

00:10:37.838 --> 00:10:40.474 position:16% line:83% align:start
Do you really think we're
going to find Osanai here?

00:10:40.509 --> 00:10:41.709 position:35% line:89% align:start
Seriously?

00:10:41.742 --> 00:10:44.345 position:19% line:83% align:start
Like I had the time
to do decent research.

00:10:44.378 --> 00:10:46.581 position:7% line:89% align:start
You showed up without warning.

00:10:46.615 --> 00:10:48.883 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yeah, my bad. But
this was an emergency.

00:10:48.916 --> 00:10:50.050 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:10:50.084 --> 00:10:51.185 position:33% line:89% align:start
Just listen.

00:10:51.218 --> 00:10:53.487 position:13% line:83% align:start
You gave me some bad intel
about Mikey and Draken

00:10:53.522 --> 00:10:55.389 position:7% line:89% align:start
being pissed off at each other.

00:10:55.422 --> 00:10:56.591 position:19% line:89% align:start
Those two are so tight,

00:10:56.625 --> 00:10:58.192 position:24% line:83% align:start
there's no way they
could be enemies!

00:10:59.594 --> 00:11:01.162 position:27% line:89% align:start
Back in the past,

00:11:01.195 --> 00:11:04.365 position:10% line:83% align:start
a battle between Moebius
and Toman is about to start.

00:11:05.534 --> 00:11:08.035 position:27% line:83% align:start
And in it, Draken
is going to die.

00:11:08.068 --> 00:11:09.170 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:11:09.203 --> 00:11:11.772 position:10% line:83% align:start
But if we can just find
this Osanai guy from Moebius

00:11:11.805 --> 00:11:12.973 position:10% line:89% align:start
and we get some information,

00:11:13.007 --> 00:11:15.342 position:21% line:83% align:start
we might figure out a
way to stop the battle

00:11:15.376 --> 00:11:16.443 position:24% line:89% align:start
and keep him alive.

00:11:16.477 --> 00:11:18.179 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Osanai] Ah, pardon me.

00:11:18.212 --> 00:11:19.213 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:11:20.381 --> 00:11:22.349 position:10% line:89% align:start
Could I get past you fellas?

00:11:22.383 --> 00:11:24.451 position:21% line:89% align:start
Ah, of course. Sorry.

00:11:24.485 --> 00:11:26.287 position:30% line:89% align:start
Thanks. See ya.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.023 position:13% line:83% align:start
I thought it'd be good to
have a cop like you around.

00:11:29.056 --> 00:11:29.890 position:33% line:89% align:start
I was right.

00:11:29.924 --> 00:11:31.560 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well, just don't
let your guard down.

00:11:31.593 --> 00:11:32.627 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Boss] What's the
holdup, Osanai?

00:11:32.661 --> 00:11:33.628 position:33% line:89% align:start
(both wince)

00:11:33.662 --> 00:11:35.229 position:21% line:89% align:start
Huh? He said Osanai?

00:11:36.697 --> 00:11:39.099 position:21% line:83% align:start
How long does it take
you to eat your lunch?

00:11:39.133 --> 00:11:41.101 position:24% line:83% align:start
Uh, but I was back
right on time.

00:11:41.135 --> 00:11:42.770 position:24% line:83% align:start
If you don't wanna
be out on your ass,

00:11:42.803 --> 00:11:44.772 position:21% line:83% align:start
you better start
pullin' your weight!

00:11:44.805 --> 00:11:46.040 position:24% line:89% align:start
That guy is Osanai?

00:11:46.073 --> 00:11:47.441 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Boss] I'm sick of
seeing your ugly mug...

00:11:47.474 --> 00:11:48.943 position:21% line:89% align:start
Former Moebius boss?!

00:11:48.976 --> 00:11:51.445 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Boss] Damn work done.
You brain-dead or what?

00:11:51.478 --> 00:11:52.713 position:24% line:89% align:start
Don't stand there!

00:11:52.746 --> 00:11:54.748 position:21% line:83% align:start
Maybe he's not the
right guy after all.

00:11:56.618 --> 00:11:58.385 position:13% line:89% align:start
Let's at least talk to him.

00:11:58.419 --> 00:11:59.420 position:47% line:89% align:start
Mm.

00:12:02.423 --> 00:12:05.759 position:10% line:89% align:start
Um, did I do something wrong?

00:12:05.793 --> 00:12:06.927 position:35% line:89% align:start
Not at all.

00:12:06.961 --> 00:12:08.862 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm looking into the
Tokyo Manji Gang,

00:12:08.896 --> 00:12:11.700 position:19% line:83% align:start
the guys that caused an
incident the other day.

00:12:11.732 --> 00:12:13.867 position:21% line:83% align:start
Back 12 years ago,
you were in a battle

00:12:13.901 --> 00:12:15.903 position:10% line:89% align:start
against the Tokyo Manji Gang

00:12:15.936 --> 00:12:18.272 position:16% line:83% align:start
as the leader of Moebius,
isn't that right?

00:12:21.543 --> 00:12:22.743 position:13% line:89% align:start
I have some questions I'd-

00:12:22.776 --> 00:12:25.779 position:27% line:89% align:start
(bangs on table)

00:12:26.715 --> 00:12:31.018 position:19% line:83% align:start
(stammers) I have
nothing to say to you.

00:12:31.051 --> 00:12:34.723 position:16% line:83% align:start
Were you not involved in
the death of Ken Ryuguji?

00:12:34.755 --> 00:12:38.158 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Osanai] No. No, I wasn't. I...

00:12:38.192 --> 00:12:40.494 position:16% line:83% align:start
It was a member of
Moebius who stabbed him.

00:12:42.162 --> 00:12:43.430 position:33% line:89% align:start
Please stop.

00:12:43.464 --> 00:12:46.100 position:13% line:83% align:start
You gave the order for them
to kill him, didn't you?

00:12:46.133 --> 00:12:47.134 position:47% line:89% align:start
No!

00:12:48.802 --> 00:12:51.539 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Osanai sobbing)

00:13:06.253 --> 00:13:08.889 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yes, it's true that
we fought with Toman.

00:13:08.922 --> 00:13:10.991 position:19% line:83% align:start
But we weren't the
ones who killed Draken.

00:13:12.826 --> 00:13:15.396 position:21% line:83% align:start
The battle that day
was just the trigger.

00:13:15.429 --> 00:13:19.099 position:16% line:83% align:start
After that, Toman started
having internal trouble.

00:13:19.133 --> 00:13:20.301 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:13:20.334 --> 00:13:21.302 position:24% line:89% align:start
And on August 3rd,

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:24.171 position:33% line:89% align:start
Draken died.

00:13:25.172 --> 00:13:30.144 position:19% line:83% align:start
It was all just a part
of his big plan. (sobs)

00:13:30.679 --> 00:13:31.646 position:33% line:89% align:start
Part of what?

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:34.281 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Osanai sobbing)

00:13:34.315 --> 00:13:35.750 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry.

00:13:35.784 --> 00:13:37.051 position:16% line:89% align:start
I can't tell you anymore.

00:13:38.419 --> 00:13:41.188 position:13% line:83% align:start
Toman and all that? I want
nothing to do with it.

00:13:42.557 --> 00:13:45.192 position:30% line:89% align:start
(phone ringing)

00:13:46.393 --> 00:13:49.496 position:16% line:83% align:start
I have to go. My boss
is pissed at me already.

00:13:49.531 --> 00:13:51.031 position:13% line:89% align:start
Sorry I couldn't help you.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.704 position:19% line:83% align:start
I hope we didn't cause
you any inconvenience.

00:13:55.737 --> 00:13:57.271 position:16% line:89% align:start
Uh, thanks of your time.

00:13:59.708 --> 00:14:02.409 position:7% line:89% align:start
If Draken hadn't died that day,

00:14:02.443 --> 00:14:03.444 position:38% line:89% align:start
then I...

00:14:06.947 --> 00:14:09.350 position:30% line:89% align:start
(bells ringing)

00:14:09.383 --> 00:14:12.219 position:33% line:89% align:start
(door thuds)

00:14:12.252 --> 00:14:14.121 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] So,
what do you think?

00:14:14.154 --> 00:14:16.457 position:10% line:89% align:start
Osanai was obviously shaken.

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:18.626 position:13% line:89% align:start
I doubt that he was lying.

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:21.028 position:27% line:83% align:start
And if everything
he said was true,

00:14:21.061 --> 00:14:24.865 position:13% line:83% align:start
then the fight with Moebius
was only a catalyst.

00:14:24.898 --> 00:14:26.367 position:10% line:89% align:start
Whoever he was talking about

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.637 position:13% line:83% align:start
was apparently plotting to
set Toman against itself.

00:14:29.671 --> 00:14:31.506 position:16% line:89% align:start
And Osanai just got used.

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:36.009 position:7% line:83% align:start
Which means someone was
trying to get Draken and Mikey

00:14:36.043 --> 00:14:37.911 position:13% line:89% align:start
to turn against each other?

00:14:37.945 --> 00:14:39.947 position:13% line:89% align:start
Why would someone do that?

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:43.417 position:13% line:83% align:start
Point is the conflict with
Moebius sets it all off.

00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:46.887 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yeah. And so Toman and
Moebius can't fight.

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:48.422 position:21% line:89% align:start
I have to stop them.

00:14:48.455 --> 00:14:49.456 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:14:50.124 --> 00:14:52.126 position:10% line:89% align:start
Please explain that to Mikey.

00:14:52.159 --> 00:14:54.562 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] Got it.
I'll convince him.

00:14:54.596 --> 00:14:57.965 position:21% line:89% align:start
(electricity buzzing)

00:15:01.335 --> 00:15:03.470 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yeah, what the hell's
up with Yamagishi?

00:15:03.505 --> 00:15:06.306 position:16% line:83% align:start
He always has to fart at
the worst possible time.

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:09.611 position:19% line:83% align:start
He's always causing
trouble, huh? (laughs)

00:15:09.644 --> 00:15:12.112 position:10% line:89% align:start
Hm? What's wrong, Takemichi?

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:14.281 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:15:15.315 --> 00:15:16.116 position:41% line:89% align:start
Akkun?

00:15:17.951 --> 00:15:21.455 position:21% line:83% align:start
Please save everyone,
our crybaby hero.

00:15:22.624 --> 00:15:24.057 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hey, dude. You fall asleep?

00:15:24.091 --> 00:15:26.360 position:7% line:89% align:start
Oh, sorry. I wasn't listening.

00:15:26.393 --> 00:15:28.295 position:33% line:89% align:start
Huh? (groans)

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:30.899 position:24% line:89% align:start
Argh. Thanks a lot.

00:15:30.931 --> 00:15:32.099 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi laughs)

00:15:32.132 --> 00:15:35.202 position:16% line:83% align:start
Hey! What the hell are
you laughing about, huh?

00:15:35.235 --> 00:15:37.404 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's right. He's alive.

00:15:37.438 --> 00:15:39.841 position:19% line:83% align:start
Damn it. You're still
not listening, are you?

00:15:39.874 --> 00:15:41.475 position:7% line:89% align:start
Hey, watch where you're going!

00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:43.477 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-(Akkun screams)

00:15:43.511 --> 00:15:44.278 position:30% line:89% align:start
(both laughing)

00:15:44.311 --> 00:15:46.380 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Yeah! Woo!
-Yeah, baby!

00:15:50.017 --> 00:15:53.521 position:24% line:89% align:start
(melancholic music)

00:15:53.555 --> 00:15:54.856 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hey, Akkun.

00:15:54.889 --> 00:15:55.857 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Akkun] Yeah?

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:58.025 position:10% line:89% align:start
Do you have any life dreams?

00:15:58.058 --> 00:15:59.694 position:19% line:89% align:start
Say what? Why the heck

00:15:59.727 --> 00:16:01.962 position:10% line:83% align:start
are you getting all
sentimental all of a sudden?

00:16:01.995 --> 00:16:04.031 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Just tell me.

00:16:04.064 --> 00:16:06.901 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Akkun] Hm. Any dreams, huh?

00:16:06.935 --> 00:16:09.838 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well, I might wanna
become a hairstylist.

00:16:09.871 --> 00:16:11.138 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] You
better make it happen.

00:16:11.171 --> 00:16:13.240 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Akkun] Huh? The hell
are you talking about?

00:16:13.273 --> 00:16:14.909 position:19% line:83% align:start
How am I supposed to
know if that'll happen?

00:16:14.943 --> 00:16:17.244 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi sighs)

00:16:17.277 --> 00:16:20.080 position:19% line:83% align:start
(inhales deeply) Well,
I believe in you!

00:16:20.113 --> 00:16:21.148 position:27% line:89% align:start
Whoa, man, chill!

00:16:21.181 --> 00:16:22.650 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi grunts)

00:16:22.684 --> 00:16:25.285 position:13% line:83% align:start
Dude, what is wrong with
you? You're sounding crazy.

00:16:26.386 --> 00:16:29.122 position:19% line:83% align:start
I just want you to know
I've got your back.

00:16:30.825 --> 00:16:32.527 position:7% line:89% align:start
And I just know you can do it!

00:16:34.495 --> 00:16:36.029 position:30% line:89% align:start
Oh. Yeah, sure.

00:16:37.164 --> 00:16:39.166 position:21% line:89% align:start
Akkun, I've gotta go.

00:16:39.199 --> 00:16:41.569 position:16% line:89% align:start
Huh? Where are you going?

00:16:41.603 --> 00:16:42.436 position:24% line:89% align:start
Something came up.

00:16:43.738 --> 00:16:45.573 position:7% line:89% align:start
Let me be your first customer.

00:16:45.607 --> 00:16:47.775 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh, okay?

00:16:47.809 --> 00:16:51.111 position:24% line:83% align:start
Awesome! I'm gonna
hold you to that!

00:16:51.144 --> 00:16:53.280 position:19% line:83% align:start
All righty then, dude.
I'll see you tomorrow.

00:16:55.617 --> 00:16:56.618 position:21% line:89% align:start
I want to save Akkun.

00:16:58.118 --> 00:17:00.020 position:13% line:89% align:start
And I want to save Draken.

00:17:00.053 --> 00:17:03.023 position:5% line:89% align:start
(pants) And I want to save Hina!

00:17:05.259 --> 00:17:08.195 position:5% line:83% align:start
So I have to stop this conflict
with Moebius from happening.

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:15.035 position:30% line:89% align:start
(pants) Mikey!

00:17:16.403 --> 00:17:17.204 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Mm?
-Huh?

00:17:18.006 --> 00:17:21.208 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi panting)

00:17:24.512 --> 00:17:26.814 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna make sure this
fight never happens!

00:17:26.848 --> 00:17:29.817 position:21% line:89% align:start
Takemichi, what's up?

00:17:29.851 --> 00:17:31.719 position:27% line:83% align:start
What the hell are
you doing here?

00:17:31.753 --> 00:17:34.022 position:16% line:89% align:start
You got no business here.

00:17:34.054 --> 00:17:35.523 position:19% line:89% align:start
Get lost, you shithead!

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:43.096 position:21% line:83% align:start
No offense, but this
is a heavy meeting.

00:17:48.135 --> 00:17:51.639 position:16% line:83% align:start
This fight with Moebius.
It can't happen.

00:17:54.008 --> 00:17:55.442 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:17:55.475 --> 00:17:58.245 position:10% line:83% align:start
I can't say how, but there's
something that I know!

00:17:58.278 --> 00:18:00.682 position:13% line:83% align:start
There's someone else who's
pulling the strings here.

00:18:00.715 --> 00:18:02.482 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi groans)

00:18:02.517 --> 00:18:05.185 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi grunts)

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.856 position:16% line:83% align:start
Who do you think you are
telling us what to do?

00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:11.391 position:24% line:89% align:start
You tell him, Pah.

00:18:11.425 --> 00:18:14.127 position:13% line:83% align:start
One more word and I'll kill
you, you piece of shit.

00:18:15.897 --> 00:18:19.067 position:10% line:83% align:start
I heard you, Draken. I won't
rush you into anything.

00:18:19.099 --> 00:18:21.435 position:13% line:83% align:start
Just tell me though,
what's our plan of attack?

00:18:21.468 --> 00:18:23.370 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] You can't do that!

00:18:23.403 --> 00:18:25.205 position:10% line:89% align:start
You can't fight with Moebius.

00:18:25.238 --> 00:18:28.141 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's nothing but a trap
for Toman to walk into!

00:18:31.478 --> 00:18:32.279 position:38% line:89% align:start
Stand up.

00:18:36.149 --> 00:18:39.087 position:16% line:83% align:start
We can't fight them, and
you can't tell us why?!

00:18:39.152 --> 00:18:40.989 position:21% line:83% align:start
Then who beat the
shit outta my friend?

00:18:41.022 --> 00:18:42.924 position:21% line:83% align:start
And who put his girl
in the hospital?!

00:18:42.957 --> 00:18:44.826 position:5% line:89% align:start
I don't know all that! But I do-

00:18:44.859 --> 00:18:47.762 position:16% line:89% align:start
Okay, Takemichi, enough.

00:18:47.795 --> 00:18:49.129 position:19% line:89% align:start
You've made your case.

00:18:52.767 --> 00:18:54.134 position:16% line:89% align:start
But the fight's still on.

00:18:56.638 --> 00:18:58.673 position:19% line:83% align:start
You don't know anything
about this, pal.

00:19:01.009 --> 00:19:03.443 position:27% line:83% align:start
Once I've made up
my mind to fight,

00:19:03.477 --> 00:19:05.847 position:19% line:83% align:start
then Toman and Moebius
are gonna fight.

00:19:17.892 --> 00:19:18.893 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:19:21.763 --> 00:19:23.230 position:24% line:89% align:start
I can't back down.

00:19:23.263 --> 00:19:26.400 position:13% line:83% align:start
If you guys fight Moebius,
then Toman's finished!

00:19:26.433 --> 00:19:28.402 position:21% line:83% align:start
I just got to be
friends with you two

00:19:28.435 --> 00:19:30.370 position:27% line:83% align:start
and I don't wanna
lose you to this!

00:19:30.404 --> 00:19:33.908 position:24% line:83% align:start
I refuse to accept
that Toman is over!

00:19:35.475 --> 00:19:38.813 position:13% line:83% align:start
I've had all I can stand
of your goddamn blubbering-

00:19:38.846 --> 00:19:40.180 position:7% line:89% align:start
The hell are you doing, Draken?

00:19:41.983 --> 00:19:44.351 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Pah grunts)

00:19:44.384 --> 00:19:47.187 position:19% line:83% align:start
Takemichi said he's
not going to back down.

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:48.623 position:7% line:89% align:start
Maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea

00:19:48.656 --> 00:19:51.191 position:21% line:83% align:start
to look into Moebius
a bit more, Mikey.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.829 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Mikey] Huh? Ken, are
you going against Toman?

00:19:56.363 --> 00:19:59.000 position:24% line:83% align:start
What? That isn't
what I said at all.

00:19:59.033 --> 00:20:00.668 position:13% line:89% align:start
Funny, that's what I heard.

00:20:11.746 --> 00:20:14.381 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi panting)

00:20:14.414 --> 00:20:15.382 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Osanai] Sorry to interrupt

00:20:15.415 --> 00:20:17.585 position:7% line:89% align:start
your little catfight, children.

00:20:17.618 --> 00:20:18.418 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:20:19.453 --> 00:20:21.823 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Osanai] Moebius
this, Moebius that...

00:20:21.856 --> 00:20:23.256 position:16% line:89% align:start
Personally, I'd prefer it

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:25.593 position:19% line:83% align:start
if you'd keep our name
outta your mouths.

00:20:28.196 --> 00:20:32.100 position:21% line:83% align:start
(exhales) You middle
school cretins.

00:20:32.133 --> 00:20:34.401 position:24% line:83% align:start
(gulps) Holy crap,
you're Osanai!

00:20:36.137 --> 00:20:38.573 position:24% line:83% align:start
Shut your filthy
mouth, dick cheese.

00:20:38.606 --> 00:20:39.607 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:20:40.775 --> 00:20:41.776 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's Osanai?

00:20:46.514 --> 00:20:48.649 position:21% line:89% align:start
You son of a whore...

00:20:48.683 --> 00:20:51.586 position:21% line:83% align:start
Careful, now. I'm two
years older than you.

00:20:51.619 --> 00:20:53.921 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's Mister Son-of-a-Whore.

00:20:53.955 --> 00:20:55.656 position:33% line:89% align:start
Now, you die!

00:20:56.958 --> 00:20:59.359 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Pah grunts)

00:21:00.862 --> 00:21:04.431 position:16% line:83% align:start
Thanks for proving you're
just middle school punks.

00:21:04.464 --> 00:21:08.102 position:16% line:83% align:start
The Tokyo Manji Gang?
Change your stupid name.

00:21:08.136 --> 00:21:10.337 position:5% line:89% align:start
Maybe to The Playground Kiddies.

00:21:14.809 --> 00:21:16.944 position:21% line:83% align:start
You see, I heard you
fellas were gonna try

00:21:16.978 --> 00:21:19.981 position:27% line:83% align:start
and pick a fight
with us. (snaps)

00:21:21.082 --> 00:21:24.484 position:16% line:89% align:start
(Moebius Gang muttering)

00:21:32.927 --> 00:21:35.963 position:10% line:83% align:start
So I thought we'd generously
bring the fight to you.

00:21:35.997 --> 00:21:37.098 position:21% line:89% align:start
Look at these punks.

00:21:37.131 --> 00:21:38.833 position:5% line:89% align:start
This isn't gonna take very long.

00:21:38.866 --> 00:21:39.734 position:21% line:89% align:start
They're all so puny!

00:21:40.868 --> 00:21:42.402 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Osanai] So, Mikey!

00:21:43.571 --> 00:21:44.739 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] We're surrounded!

00:21:46.707 --> 00:21:48.042 position:33% line:89% align:start
This is war!

00:21:48.075 --> 00:21:51.746 position:10% line:89% align:start
(gang muttering and yelling)

00:22:01.889 --> 00:22:05.893 position:13% line:83% align:start
Point is the conflict with
Moebius sets it all off.

00:22:05.927 --> 00:22:08.930 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] And so Toman
and Moebius can't fight.

00:22:08.963 --> 00:22:10.363 position:21% line:89% align:start
I have to stop them.

00:22:12.166 --> 00:22:14.969 position:21% line:83% align:start
Shit! How am I
supposed to do that?

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:20.541 position:21% line:89% align:start
(closing theme music)
