00:00:08.676 --> 00:00:12.079 position:16% line:89% align:start
(Baji breathing shakily)

00:00:16.985 --> 00:00:18.185 position:38% line:89% align:start
Damn it.

00:00:19.721 --> 00:00:23.558 position:16% line:89% align:start
(Baji breathing heavily)

00:00:23.591 --> 00:00:24.391 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Baji exhales)

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:28.830 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] Huh?
What is going on?

00:00:28.863 --> 00:00:31.533 position:27% line:83% align:start
Why did Baji just
go down like that?

00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:32.967 position:24% line:89% align:start
We're almost there.

00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:35.703 position:16% line:83% align:start
We're just one step away
from defeating Kisaki.

00:00:35.737 --> 00:00:38.372 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Chifuyu panting)

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:39.807 position:38% line:89% align:start
Baji, no!

00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:42.442 position:41% line:89% align:start
Kisaki!

00:00:42.476 --> 00:00:45.412 position:21% line:83% align:start
What the hell did you
do to Baji? (panting)

00:00:47.515 --> 00:00:49.116 position:24% line:89% align:start
You saw everything.

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:51.084 position:21% line:83% align:start
I didn't do anything
to him at all.

00:00:53.922 --> 00:00:56.223 position:33% line:89% align:start
Baji! (gasps)

00:00:56.256 --> 00:00:59.059 position:24% line:89% align:start
(foreboding music)

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:00.127 position:27% line:89% align:start
You were stabbed?

00:01:01.328 --> 00:01:02.730 position:38% line:89% align:start
But when?

00:01:02.764 --> 00:01:05.600 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasps)

00:01:09.637 --> 00:01:11.606 position:30% line:89% align:start
(pensive music)

00:01:13.641 --> 00:01:14.709 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's just a scratch.

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:17.344 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Wait.

00:01:17.377 --> 00:01:20.147 position:19% line:83% align:start
So that actually was a
serious injury, then?

00:01:20.882 --> 00:01:22.717 position:7% line:89% align:start
Hurry up and call an ambulance!

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.052 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Toman Member] Uh, right!

00:01:25.653 --> 00:01:28.756 position:24% line:89% align:start
Kazutora. (growls)

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.062 position:38% line:89% align:start
Kazutora!

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:36.598 position:21% line:83% align:start
But it's not, I mean,
it's not like I...

00:01:36.631 --> 00:01:37.765 position:33% line:89% align:start
No, damn it.

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:38.833 position:33% line:89% align:start
No, it's not.

00:01:39.801 --> 00:01:42.537 position:13% line:89% align:start
No, I, no, I just couldn't.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.838 position:24% line:89% align:start
I, no, this, it...

00:01:44.839 --> 00:01:46.306 position:24% line:89% align:start
No, it just can't.

00:01:52.547 --> 00:01:57.552 position:19% line:83% align:start
-(singing in Japanese)
-(opening theme music)

00:03:23.004 --> 00:03:24.138 position:27% line:5% align:start
[Takemichi] Crap!

00:03:24.172 --> 00:03:26.306 position:7% line:5% align:start
This is just like Draken said.

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:30.277 position:13% line:5% align:start
If Baji does die, it'll
be just what Kisaki wants.

00:03:32.547 --> 00:03:35.583 position:21% line:83% align:start
Kazutora's definitely
got some screws loose.

00:03:35.616 --> 00:03:36.784 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:03:36.818 --> 00:03:38.553 position:33% line:89% align:start
Oh, I get it.

00:03:38.586 --> 00:03:40.555 position:24% line:83% align:start
He must've brought
Baji into Valhalla

00:03:40.588 --> 00:03:42.957 position:19% line:83% align:start
so that he could just
finish him off himself.

00:03:44.491 --> 00:03:47.260 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] What the hell is
he even talking about now?

00:03:48.162 --> 00:03:50.497 position:19% line:89% align:start
That right, Commander?

00:03:53.935 --> 00:03:54.936 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mikey.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.840 position:21% line:89% align:start
Kisaki, that bastard!

00:03:58.873 --> 00:04:01.142 position:10% line:89% align:start
He's trying to provoke Mikey.

00:04:01.175 --> 00:04:03.511 position:10% line:89% align:start
No, Mikey, Kazutora didn't...

00:04:04.444 --> 00:04:07.247 position:5% line:89% align:start
Come on, don't listen to Kisaki!

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.187 position:19% line:83% align:start
-I wanted to kill you.
-(Takemichi gasps)

00:04:13.221 --> 00:04:14.421 position:30% line:89% align:start
Even back then.

00:04:15.556 --> 00:04:18.226 position:19% line:83% align:start
As soon as you had
been let out of juvie,

00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:20.360 position:24% line:83% align:start
I started thinking
about killing you.

00:04:20.393 --> 00:04:21.562 position:27% line:89% align:start
It was my fault.

00:04:21.596 --> 00:04:22.395 position:33% line:89% align:start
It wasn't...

00:04:23.731 --> 00:04:27.602 position:7% line:83% align:start
And the one who always kept
talking me out of it was Baji.

00:04:30.638 --> 00:04:33.641 position:24% line:83% align:start
He always said that
all you wanted to do

00:04:34.474 --> 00:04:36.443 position:21% line:89% align:start
was to make me happy,

00:04:36.476 --> 00:04:38.880 position:13% line:83% align:start
and that's why you
couldn't accept the blame,

00:04:41.516 --> 00:04:45.219 position:10% line:83% align:start
even though you were the one
who had killed my brother.

00:04:45.253 --> 00:04:47.487 position:21% line:83% align:start
In order for things
to make sense to you,

00:04:48.656 --> 00:04:50.558 position:24% line:83% align:start
you had to make
me into the enemy.

00:04:53.194 --> 00:04:56.329 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Isn't that right?
-(ominous music)

00:04:58.365 --> 00:04:59.366 position:35% line:89% align:start
Mikey, no.

00:05:00.535 --> 00:05:03.204 position:21% line:83% align:start
He should be super
pissed off right now,

00:05:03.237 --> 00:05:04.572 position:21% line:89% align:start
but he's emotionless.

00:05:05.873 --> 00:05:08.943 position:27% line:89% align:start
(crowd murmuring)

00:05:08.976 --> 00:05:11.679 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Draken panting)

00:05:15.616 --> 00:05:16.617 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mikey.

00:05:17.952 --> 00:05:18.953 position:27% line:89% align:start
You know, Kenny,

00:05:21.989 --> 00:05:24.158 position:13% line:89% align:start
this fight's already over.

00:05:24.192 --> 00:05:25.960 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:05:25.993 --> 00:05:27.494 position:13% line:89% align:start
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up.

00:05:27.528 --> 00:05:29.496 position:27% line:83% align:start
What do you mean,
the fight's over?

00:05:30.463 --> 00:05:33.134 position:21% line:83% align:start
Where the hell do you
think we are, Mikey?

00:05:33.167 --> 00:05:34.635 position:7% line:89% align:start
You must be crazy if you think

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:36.771 position:24% line:83% align:start
you get to decide
shit like that now!

00:05:38.438 --> 00:05:41.474 position:30% line:83% align:start
-(Hanma laughs)
-Oh!

00:05:42.375 --> 00:05:44.846 position:13% line:89% align:start
There, then. Now it's over.

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:47.248 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Hanma straining)

00:05:47.281 --> 00:05:50.117 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasps)

00:05:53.087 --> 00:05:55.756 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Hanma gasping)

00:05:59.126 --> 00:06:00.127 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hanma?

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:03.931 position:13% line:83% align:start
-No way.
-This is some kinda trick.

00:06:03.965 --> 00:06:06.433 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Valhalla Member] He took
out Hanma with one blow?

00:06:06.466 --> 00:06:08.368 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Valhalla Member]
Dude, there's no way.

00:06:08.401 --> 00:06:11.438 position:27% line:89% align:start
(crowd clamoring)

00:06:13.674 --> 00:06:15.910 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Run!
-He'll kill us!

00:06:16.744 --> 00:06:19.379 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Aw, hell, no!
-This wasn't the deal!

00:06:21.582 --> 00:06:26.587 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(crowd clamoring)
-(intense music)

00:06:32.093 --> 00:06:34.595 position:27% line:83% align:start
Betrayal is human
nature, I guess.

00:06:36.429 --> 00:06:38.766 position:19% line:89% align:start
All right, then, Mikey.

00:06:38.799 --> 00:06:40.467 position:30% line:89% align:start
Let's end this.

00:06:40.501 --> 00:06:41.936 position:16% line:89% align:start
Either you're gonna die,

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:44.238 position:19% line:89% align:start
or I'm gonna die today-

00:06:44.272 --> 00:06:47.008 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Kazutora shouts)

00:06:49.176 --> 00:06:53.781 position:33% line:83% align:start
-(body thuds)
-(crowd gasps)

00:06:53.814 --> 00:06:56.851 position:10% line:83% align:start
If all that's in your head is
destroying important things,

00:06:58.052 --> 00:06:59.620 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'll destroy you right now.

00:07:02.957 --> 00:07:05.793 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Kazutora groans)

00:07:08.262 --> 00:07:13.466 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(Kazutora grunts)
-(grim music)

00:07:18.606 --> 00:07:19.774 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasps)

00:07:19.807 --> 00:07:22.243 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(blows thumping)
-(flesh squelching)

00:07:22.276 --> 00:07:24.612 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(crowd murmuring)
-Mikey.

00:07:24.645 --> 00:07:28.716 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(blows thumping)
-(flesh squelching)

00:07:28.749 --> 00:07:30.518 position:13% line:89% align:start
Mikey's gonna kill the guy.

00:07:31.652 --> 00:07:33.486 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Mitsuya] No one
can stop Mikey now.

00:07:37.158 --> 00:07:38.559 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi exhales)

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.996 position:19% line:83% align:start
I wonder why I didn't
realize it at the time.

00:07:43.698 --> 00:07:47.001 position:7% line:83% align:start
The heavy cross that he
carried with him all the time,

00:07:48.069 --> 00:07:50.504 position:19% line:83% align:start
even though he was
just a 15-year-old kid.

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:54.976 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] That's
where we're heading now,

00:07:55.009 --> 00:07:57.244 position:19% line:83% align:start
right toward the future
I came here from.

00:07:59.547 --> 00:08:02.850 position:21% line:83% align:start
On that day, Mikey
went after Kazutora.

00:08:04.185 --> 00:08:05.186 position:24% line:89% align:start
And he killed him.

00:08:07.989 --> 00:08:08.789 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Mikey.

00:08:11.792 --> 00:08:16.797 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(blows thumping)
-(flesh squelching)

00:08:20.067 --> 00:08:21.535 position:35% line:89% align:start
In the end,

00:08:21.569 --> 00:08:24.672 position:16% line:83% align:start
I couldn't do a goddamn
thing to change anything!

00:08:33.514 --> 00:08:35.449 position:27% line:83% align:start
-(crowd shouting)
-Hmm.

00:08:35.483 --> 00:08:38.152 position:24% line:83% align:start
So Baji actually is
a traitor after all.

00:08:38.986 --> 00:08:40.354 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hanma!

00:08:40.388 --> 00:08:41.989 position:24% line:89% align:start
You little bastard!

00:08:42.023 --> 00:08:43.657 position:16% line:89% align:start
The hell are you doing?!

00:08:43.691 --> 00:08:48.662 position:27% line:83% align:start
-(Draken yelling)
-(crowd clamoring)

00:08:51.399 --> 00:08:52.533 position:33% line:89% align:start
So what now?

00:08:52.566 --> 00:08:55.569 position:19% line:83% align:start
Are you going to
abandon me, too, Baji?

00:08:57.071 --> 00:09:02.076 position:16% line:83% align:start
-(tense music)
-(metal clanking softly)

00:09:05.046 --> 00:09:07.815 position:27% line:89% align:start
(flesh squelches)

00:09:09.984 --> 00:09:10.785 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:09:13.621 --> 00:09:16.323 position:10% line:89% align:start
I don't, I don't understand.

00:09:19.193 --> 00:09:21.662 position:16% line:83% align:start
I only wanted to do
something nice for Mikey.

00:09:25.299 --> 00:09:27.301 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's not my fault.

00:09:27.334 --> 00:09:28.969 position:5% line:89% align:start
This is Mikey's fault, isn't it?

00:09:30.638 --> 00:09:32.507 position:21% line:89% align:start
So that's the answer.

00:09:32.541 --> 00:09:36.610 position:21% line:83% align:start
I have to kill Mikey.
(exhales shakily)

00:09:36.644 --> 00:09:38.946 position:24% line:83% align:start
Come on, now, don't
talk like that.

00:09:38.979 --> 00:09:39.947 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's awful.

00:09:41.382 --> 00:09:45.086 position:13% line:83% align:start
It doesn't matter what kind
of hell is waiting for us.

00:09:45.119 --> 00:09:47.254 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'll be with you right
until the very end!

00:09:48.989 --> 00:09:50.958 position:30% line:89% align:start
(gentle music)

00:09:54.595 --> 00:09:57.765 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Kazutora] That's
how it always was.

00:09:57.798 --> 00:10:02.069 position:10% line:83% align:start
Baji was always there for
me, no matter what happened.

00:10:03.572 --> 00:10:05.773 position:21% line:83% align:start
I guess I did end up
destroying the thing

00:10:07.908 --> 00:10:09.643 position:7% line:89% align:start
that was most important to me.

00:10:12.079 --> 00:10:13.314 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry, Baji.

00:10:14.248 --> 00:10:16.150 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'll be joining you soon.

00:10:16.183 --> 00:10:18.385 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Baji straining)

00:10:18.419 --> 00:10:21.088 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Chifuyu gasps)

00:10:22.456 --> 00:10:23.657 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Baji] Mikey.

00:10:24.492 --> 00:10:25.926 position:30% line:89% align:start
Baji. You're...

00:10:27.094 --> 00:10:31.332 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(blows thumping)
-(flesh squelching)

00:10:31.365 --> 00:10:34.702 position:16% line:89% align:start
(Baji breathing shakily)

00:10:35.636 --> 00:10:36.904 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mikey!

00:10:39.106 --> 00:10:41.709 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Baji hacking)

00:10:42.676 --> 00:10:45.346 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Mikey exhales)

00:10:52.052 --> 00:10:55.856 position:24% line:83% align:start
You got really mad,
all because of me.

00:10:58.392 --> 00:10:59.727 position:27% line:89% align:start
Thanks for that.

00:11:03.931 --> 00:11:06.033 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hey, stop moving
around so much, Baji.

00:11:10.539 --> 00:11:13.974 position:16% line:89% align:start
(Baji breathing roughly)

00:11:21.215 --> 00:11:22.216 position:44% line:89% align:start
Baji.

00:11:24.051 --> 00:11:25.286 position:44% line:89% align:start
Wha?

00:11:25.319 --> 00:11:27.688 position:21% line:89% align:start
Baji is still alive?

00:11:29.323 --> 00:11:30.324 position:41% line:89% align:start
But...

00:11:37.031 --> 00:11:37.898 position:44% line:89% align:start
Baji.

00:11:40.801 --> 00:11:43.437 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Kisaki scoffs)

00:11:45.574 --> 00:11:46.840 position:41% line:89% align:start
I won't

00:11:48.309 --> 00:11:49.310 position:44% line:89% align:start
die.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.049 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Kazutora gasps)

00:11:55.082 --> 00:11:58.786 position:24% line:83% align:start
This is nowhere
enough to kill me.

00:12:01.656 --> 00:12:02.856 position:30% line:89% align:start
There's no way.

00:12:03.824 --> 00:12:06.794 position:24% line:83% align:start
That is definitely
a mortal wound.

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:13.434 position:7% line:89% align:start
Don't worry about it, Kazutora.

00:12:17.539 --> 00:12:19.173 position:30% line:89% align:start
(knife snicks)

00:12:19.873 --> 00:12:21.909 position:21% line:89% align:start
I swear that I won't

00:12:24.411 --> 00:12:25.879 position:24% line:89% align:start
die at your hands!

00:12:25.913 --> 00:12:28.749 position:27% line:89% align:start
(flesh squelches)

00:12:30.784 --> 00:12:32.953 position:24% line:89% align:start
(suspenseful music)

00:12:35.624 --> 00:12:37.958 position:35% line:89% align:start
(all gasp)

00:12:43.864 --> 00:12:47.301 position:16% line:89% align:start
(Baji breathing raggedly)

00:12:58.879 --> 00:13:00.814 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(body thuds)
-(Chifuyu gasping)

00:13:00.848 --> 00:13:05.386 position:30% line:89% align:start
Baji! (panting)

00:13:11.925 --> 00:13:13.093 position:30% line:89% align:start
But why, Baji?

00:13:14.295 --> 00:13:15.129 position:27% line:89% align:start
Why would you...?

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:23.638 position:10% line:89% align:start
(Kazutora breathing heavily)

00:13:23.672 --> 00:13:24.872 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mikey.

00:13:25.774 --> 00:13:28.809 position:16% line:89% align:start
You're up next. (inhales)

00:13:28.842 --> 00:13:31.445 position:21% line:83% align:start
The two of you can
go to hell together!

00:13:31.478 --> 00:13:32.479 position:38% line:89% align:start
Shut up.

00:13:33.515 --> 00:13:35.282 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'll punch you 'til you die.

00:13:38.385 --> 00:13:39.587 position:35% line:89% align:start
Can't be...

00:13:40.254 --> 00:13:41.322 position:41% line:89% align:start
No way.

00:13:41.355 --> 00:13:42.356 position:38% line:89% align:start
Baji, no.

00:13:43.257 --> 00:13:44.491 position:44% line:89% align:start
Why?

00:13:44.526 --> 00:13:45.527 position:30% line:89% align:start
I don't get it.

00:13:47.394 --> 00:13:48.862 position:21% line:89% align:start
I mean, why the hell

00:13:48.896 --> 00:13:50.898 position:21% line:83% align:start
would you ever wanna
stab yourself, huh?

00:13:52.199 --> 00:13:54.935 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Come here, Takemichi.
-(Takemichi gasps)

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:57.271 position:38% line:89% align:start
Come on.

00:13:57.304 --> 00:13:58.405 position:33% line:89% align:start
Come closer.

00:14:00.608 --> 00:14:03.911 position:16% line:89% align:start
(Baji breathing raggedly)

00:14:06.581 --> 00:14:08.683 position:21% line:89% align:start
Kisaki is the enemy.

00:14:08.717 --> 00:14:11.519 position:21% line:83% align:start
-(Takemichi gasps)
-(Takemichi whimpers)

00:14:11.553 --> 00:14:13.187 position:10% line:89% align:start
After the fight with Moebius,

00:14:14.321 --> 00:14:17.391 position:19% line:83% align:start
you know when Pah ended
up stabbing Osanai?

00:14:19.326 --> 00:14:23.897 position:10% line:83% align:start
He asked Mikey to let him be
the 3rd Division's captain

00:14:23.931 --> 00:14:27.935 position:13% line:83% align:start
in exchange for getting
Pah out of jail. (wheezes)

00:14:28.837 --> 00:14:31.506 position:21% line:89% align:start
I saw it for myself.

00:14:31.539 --> 00:14:34.041 position:10% line:89% align:start
He brought the deal to Mikey.

00:14:38.312 --> 00:14:41.649 position:21% line:83% align:start
The 3rd Division's
captain isn't Kisaki.

00:14:46.621 --> 00:14:50.491 position:27% line:83% align:start
Toman was created
by the six of us.

00:14:54.962 --> 00:14:58.065 position:19% line:83% align:start
No matter what happens
from here on out,

00:14:58.098 --> 00:15:02.002 position:13% line:83% align:start
the 3rd Division's captain
is Pah and only Pah.

00:15:04.104 --> 00:15:07.274 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Baji, don't...
-(somber music)

00:15:09.611 --> 00:15:10.944 position:35% line:89% align:start
[Baji] Pah,

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.013 position:38% line:89% align:start
Mitsuya,

00:15:14.281 --> 00:15:15.282 position:41% line:89% align:start
Draken,

00:15:16.718 --> 00:15:17.918 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mikey,

00:15:19.621 --> 00:15:20.622 position:38% line:89% align:start
Kazutora.

00:15:22.456 --> 00:15:27.461 position:24% line:83% align:start
All of them are
my true treasures.

00:15:31.633 --> 00:15:34.935 position:16% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi crying softly)

00:15:36.905 --> 00:15:39.674 position:24% line:83% align:start
I wanted to figure
something out.

00:15:43.645 --> 00:15:45.547 position:19% line:89% align:start
But I guess I couldn't.

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:54.622 position:24% line:83% align:start
And so, I just died
by my own hand.

00:15:57.892 --> 00:16:02.095 position:19% line:83% align:start
Now Mikey has no reason
to kill Kazutora.

00:16:06.668 --> 00:16:09.269 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Baji wheezing)

00:16:11.104 --> 00:16:12.507 position:19% line:89% align:start
Guess it's about time.

00:16:13.942 --> 00:16:16.477 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm starting to
hallucinate shit now.

00:16:16.511 --> 00:16:17.512 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:16:20.949 --> 00:16:22.015 position:35% line:89% align:start
Takemichi.

00:16:23.651 --> 00:16:27.454 position:10% line:83% align:start
You know, in some ways,
you're a lot like Shinichiro.

00:16:30.959 --> 00:16:34.161 position:16% line:89% align:start
So Mikey and Toman, too,

00:16:39.032 --> 00:16:41.368 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm leaving them to you.

00:16:42.604 --> 00:16:47.542 position:21% line:83% align:start
-(Takemichi weeping)
-(mournful music)

00:16:48.475 --> 00:16:50.244 position:35% line:89% align:start
No, no way.

00:16:50.277 --> 00:16:51.746 position:44% line:89% align:start
Baji.

00:16:51.779 --> 00:16:54.081 position:7% line:89% align:start
No, don't say that kinda stuff!

00:16:55.917 --> 00:16:58.586 position:30% line:89% align:start
You can't die.

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:02.055 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Baji chuckles)

00:17:02.089 --> 00:17:03.457 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Baji] Chifuyu.

00:17:04.893 --> 00:17:06.126 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Chifuyu] Yes, sir?

00:17:07.261 --> 00:17:10.698 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Baji] I could sure go for
some Peyang yakisoba about now.

00:17:14.002 --> 00:17:15.202 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'll go buy some.

00:17:17.070 --> 00:17:20.207 position:21% line:89% align:start
Let's split it, 'kay?

00:17:21.208 --> 00:17:24.546 position:19% line:89% align:start
(Chifuyu crying softly)

00:17:29.551 --> 00:17:31.351 position:30% line:89% align:start
Thanks so much,

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:33.220 position:38% line:89% align:start
Chifuyu.

00:17:39.861 --> 00:17:44.666 position:13% line:89% align:start
Baji? (breathing tearfully)

00:17:57.545 --> 00:17:58.345 position:41% line:89% align:start
No way.

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:07.287 position:38% line:89% align:start
Baji, no!

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:16.764 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(Mikey grunts)
-(Kazutora shouts)

00:18:17.632 --> 00:18:18.800 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'll kill you!

00:18:18.833 --> 00:18:20.467 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'll kill you!

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:21.468 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'll kill you!

00:18:24.137 --> 00:18:27.207 position:21% line:83% align:start
-(Mikey grunting)
-(Kazutora grunting)

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:30.243 position:19% line:83% align:start
I always knew that you
would never betray us.

00:18:33.648 --> 00:18:36.183 position:16% line:83% align:start
Baji was out there,
fighting all on his own.

00:18:37.785 --> 00:18:39.286 position:7% line:89% align:start
I knew it right from the start.

00:18:42.255 --> 00:18:43.591 position:27% line:89% align:start
I knew it, but...

00:18:45.627 --> 00:18:47.427 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Damn it!

00:18:48.295 --> 00:18:49.897 position:19% line:89% align:start
I couldn't protect him!

00:18:49.931 --> 00:18:51.264 position:21% line:89% align:start
I couldn't save him!

00:18:52.499 --> 00:18:53.300 position:38% line:89% align:start
Damn it!

00:18:53.768 --> 00:18:55.135 position:38% line:89% align:start
Damn it.

00:18:55.168 --> 00:18:57.105 position:19% line:89% align:start
I couldn't do anything.

00:18:57.137 --> 00:18:58.138 position:33% line:89% align:start
I'm an idiot.

00:18:59.107 --> 00:19:00.642 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm a useless good-for-nothing.

00:19:03.645 --> 00:19:05.445 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry, Baji.

00:19:06.114 --> 00:19:09.017 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi wailing)

00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:12.185 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Baji] I'm leaving them to you.

00:19:12.219 --> 00:19:14.388 position:30% line:89% align:start
(rueful music)

00:19:20.962 --> 00:19:24.164 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi screams)

00:19:26.901 --> 00:19:30.738 position:10% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi breathing heavily)

00:19:32.406 --> 00:19:35.777 position:24% line:83% align:start
Move aside, or I'll
kill you as well.

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:37.210 position:16% line:89% align:start
Come on, let's stop this!

00:19:37.244 --> 00:19:39.547 position:30% line:89% align:start
Mikey! (grunts)

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:45.352 position:19% line:89% align:start
This isn't... (panting)

00:19:47.522 --> 00:19:49.991 position:10% line:83% align:start
This isn't what Baji would've
wanted to happen at all!

00:19:50.024 --> 00:19:52.192 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi grunts)

00:19:52.225 --> 00:19:54.996 position:16% line:83% align:start
Don't you dare think that
you get to speak for Baji.

00:19:55.029 --> 00:19:58.231 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi panting)

00:20:01.035 --> 00:20:02.235 position:19% line:89% align:start
I can't speak for Baji?

00:20:04.572 --> 00:20:06.674 position:16% line:83% align:start
What are you even
talking about right now?

00:20:06.708 --> 00:20:07.709 position:33% line:89% align:start
Baji is dead!

00:20:10.343 --> 00:20:11.311 position:27% line:89% align:start
What's your deal?

00:20:11.344 --> 00:20:12.547 position:19% line:89% align:start
Why don't you get that?

00:20:17.151 --> 00:20:19.252 position:27% line:83% align:start
I mean, why the
hell do you think

00:20:19.286 --> 00:20:21.421 position:16% line:83% align:start
that Baji risked his own
life like that, anyway?

00:20:23.091 --> 00:20:26.861 position:24% line:83% align:start
For Toman, and for
the both of you!

00:20:26.894 --> 00:20:30.230 position:13% line:83% align:start
Baji refused to let himself
be killed by Kazutora,

00:20:30.263 --> 00:20:32.867 position:21% line:83% align:start
and instead he chose
to take his own life

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:34.234 position:7% line:89% align:start
because he didn't want Kazutora

00:20:34.267 --> 00:20:36.170 position:24% line:83% align:start
to feel responsible
for his fate.

00:20:36.204 --> 00:20:39.607 position:27% line:83% align:start
-(Kazutora gasps)
-(dramatic music)

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.776 position:21% line:83% align:start
Also, he did it
because he wanted you

00:20:41.809 --> 00:20:42.610 position:21% line:89% align:start
to forgive Kazutora!

00:20:44.145 --> 00:20:46.013 position:21% line:83% align:start
Because all he loved
all of you guys!

00:20:46.047 --> 00:20:47.815 position:24% line:83% align:start
That's why he made
the choice he did.

00:20:47.849 --> 00:20:50.450 position:21% line:83% align:start
Why the hell don't
you understand that?

00:20:51.619 --> 00:20:52.620 position:35% line:89% align:start
Takemichi.

00:20:57.024 --> 00:20:59.794 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Mitsuya exhales)

00:20:59.827 --> 00:21:01.662 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Damn it.

00:21:09.904 --> 00:21:10.905 position:35% line:89% align:start
Takemichi.

00:21:12.472 --> 00:21:14.274 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi sniffles)

00:21:14.307 --> 00:21:17.078 position:10% line:89% align:start
Where did you get this charm?

00:21:17.111 --> 00:21:18.311 position:38% line:89% align:start
Tell me.

00:21:20.014 --> 00:21:21.448 position:16% line:89% align:start
Well, I just picked it up

00:21:21.481 --> 00:21:23.751 position:16% line:83% align:start
after our last gathering
over at the shrine.

00:21:24.786 --> 00:21:25.787 position:35% line:89% align:start
What charm?

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:28.321 position:30% line:89% align:start
Wait, that's...

00:21:31.092 --> 00:21:34.662 position:27% line:83% align:start
Baji held onto it
this whole time?

00:21:36.964 --> 00:21:38.498 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's the charm from that day.

00:21:46.607 --> 00:21:47.407 position:44% line:89% align:start
Baji.

00:21:50.878 --> 00:21:53.047 position:30% line:89% align:start
(rousing music)

00:21:56.517 --> 00:21:59.053 position:16% line:83% align:start
We're willing to give
you everything we've got.

00:22:00.588 --> 00:22:03.591 position:24% line:83% align:start
Create this new
age for us, Mikey.

00:22:17.972 --> 00:22:22.977 position:21% line:89% align:start
(closing theme music)

00:22:25.079 --> 00:22:29.884 position:21% line:89% align:start
(singing in Japanese)
