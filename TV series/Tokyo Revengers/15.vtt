00:00:07.642 --> 00:00:10.010 position:21% line:89% align:start
(intense rock music)

00:00:16.885 --> 00:00:18.318 position:27% line:83% align:start
All right, listen
up, you grunts!

00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:21.890 position:21% line:83% align:start
Toman's new captain
of the third division

00:00:21.923 --> 00:00:25.058 position:16% line:83% align:start
is sitting here right
behind me: Tetta Kisaki!

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:28.696 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi inhales)

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.799 position:27% line:83% align:start
-(blow thumps)
-(Kisaki grunts)

00:00:31.833 --> 00:00:34.502 position:10% line:89% align:start
Hey, so what's goin' on here?

00:00:34.536 --> 00:00:35.503 position:35% line:89% align:start
[All] Huh?

00:00:35.537 --> 00:00:38.940 position:16% line:83% align:start
Looks like I nearly
missed the fun! (grunts)

00:00:38.973 --> 00:00:41.108 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi grunting)

00:00:41.141 --> 00:00:43.076 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Baji snickers)

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.946 position:19% line:89% align:start
Why are you here, Baji?

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:46.014 position:19% line:89% align:start
You've been banned from

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:48.248 position:24% line:83% align:start
attending our
meetings, remember?

00:00:48.282 --> 00:00:52.252 position:13% line:83% align:start
So what, does that mean
I'm finally gonna be fired?

00:00:52.286 --> 00:00:54.087 position:27% line:83% align:start
For ruining your
precious meeting?

00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:57.124 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] What the hell
is this guy talking about?

00:00:58.593 --> 00:01:01.596 position:10% line:83% align:start
You don't want any
troublemakers, do you, Mikey?

00:01:02.496 --> 00:01:03.497 position:44% line:89% align:start
Baji!

00:01:04.832 --> 00:01:07.067 position:7% line:89% align:start
So your first division captain

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.202 position:7% line:89% align:start
will just go ahead and resign.

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:11.071 position:19% line:89% align:start
And starting right now,

00:01:11.104 --> 00:01:13.575 position:19% line:83% align:start
Toman's former captain
becomes its enemy.

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:18.746 position:27% line:89% align:start
I need something.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:19.747 position:38% line:89% align:start
A favor.

00:01:19.781 --> 00:01:22.951 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh, sure.

00:01:22.984 --> 00:01:25.085 position:16% line:83% align:start
I want you to bring
Baji back from Valhalla.

00:01:26.588 --> 00:01:27.622 position:19% line:89% align:start
Think you can do that?

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.024 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah!

00:01:30.058 --> 00:01:32.527 position:16% line:83% align:start
If that's what you
want, Mikey, you got it!

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.464 position:10% line:83% align:start
But, uh, do you think I could
ask for one thing in return?

00:01:39.366 --> 00:01:43.303 position:21% line:83% align:start
You've gotta kick
Kisaki out of Toman.

00:01:44.572 --> 00:01:45.372 position:44% line:89% align:start
Fine.

00:01:46.273 --> 00:01:47.942 position:24% line:83% align:start
We're going to end
up butting heads

00:01:47.976 --> 00:01:49.978 position:13% line:89% align:start
with Valhalla pretty soon.

00:01:50.011 --> 00:01:52.145 position:27% line:83% align:start
Just bring Baji
back before then.

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:54.882 position:13% line:83% align:start
Prove you can be even more
useful to me than Kisaki.

00:01:56.517 --> 00:01:59.152 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gulps)

00:02:04.224 --> 00:02:09.162 position:21% line:83% align:start
-(traffic whooshing)
-(footsteps thumping)

00:02:22.677 --> 00:02:24.846 position:30% line:89% align:start
(school chimes)

00:02:35.288 --> 00:02:40.061 position:27% line:83% align:start
-(student laughs)
-(cheerful music)

00:02:40.094 --> 00:02:41.729 position:24% line:89% align:start
(students giggling)

00:02:41.763 --> 00:02:43.296 position:19% line:89% align:start
Hey, girls, slow down!

00:02:45.867 --> 00:02:46.834 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh, yeah, that's right.

00:02:46.868 --> 00:02:49.302 position:13% line:89% align:start
I couldn't even believe it.

00:02:50.872 --> 00:02:53.708 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi sighs)

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.081 position:16% line:83% align:start
I want you to bring
Baji back from Valhalla.

00:03:00.114 --> 00:03:02.182 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(Takemichi gulps)
-But if you fail,

00:03:02.215 --> 00:03:04.052 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'll kill you.

00:03:04.085 --> 00:03:06.821 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] (exhales)
What am I gonna do?

00:03:06.854 --> 00:03:07.855 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Akkun] Takemichi!

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:09.023 position:38% line:89% align:start
Now what?

00:03:09.057 --> 00:03:10.525 position:19% line:89% align:start
Hey, we heard the news!

00:03:10.558 --> 00:03:13.561 position:10% line:83% align:start
So I guess you're officially
part of Toman now, huh?

00:03:13.594 --> 00:03:14.394 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yeah, well...

00:03:18.766 --> 00:03:20.134 position:19% line:89% align:start
Hey, what's the matter?

00:03:20.168 --> 00:03:21.636 position:24% line:89% align:start
Why so bummed out?

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:22.637 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:23.838 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh!

00:03:23.871 --> 00:03:25.540 position:10% line:89% align:start
Ah, it's nothing. (chuckles)

00:03:25.573 --> 00:03:27.642 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm not really sure
how it happened.

00:03:27.675 --> 00:03:28.876 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's kinda weird.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.978 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hey, tell us all about it!

00:03:31.012 --> 00:03:34.515 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] Ah, I can't
even look Akkun in the eye!

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.418 position:24% line:83% align:start
I can't believe our
Crybaby is in Toman.

00:03:38.452 --> 00:03:40.888 position:19% line:83% align:start
Man, if you're in, then
I wanna join up, too.

00:03:40.922 --> 00:03:42.557 position:24% line:89% align:start
(sighs) Yeah, well,

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.492 position:16% line:83% align:start
it's really not as great
as you guys are thinking.

00:03:45.526 --> 00:03:46.894 position:35% line:89% align:start
[All] Huh?

00:03:46.928 --> 00:03:47.929 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:03:50.497 --> 00:03:55.503 position:5% line:83% align:start
-(vocalist singing in Japanese)
-(opening theme music)

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:23.490 position:38% line:5% align:start
I get it.

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:27.195 position:13% line:5% align:start
So if you don't get former
first division captain Baji

00:05:27.228 --> 00:05:29.764 position:19% line:5% align:start
to switch from
Valhalla back to Toman,

00:05:29.797 --> 00:05:32.266 position:24% line:83% align:start
then Mikey told you
he's gonna kill you.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.433 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Yeah.

00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:35.169 position:21% line:83% align:start
And I only have until
Toman's showdown

00:05:35.203 --> 00:05:36.838 position:7% line:89% align:start
with Valhalla starts to do it.

00:05:36.871 --> 00:05:39.907 position:13% line:83% align:start
And who the hell even knows
when that might happen?

00:05:39.941 --> 00:05:41.108 position:30% line:89% align:start
If it's today-

00:05:41.142 --> 00:05:43.077 position:21% line:83% align:start
(gasps) Then I guess
this is goodbye.

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.846 position:10% line:89% align:start
But we'll all mourn for you.

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:46.080 position:30% line:89% align:start
Not to mention,

00:05:46.113 --> 00:05:47.248 position:16% line:89% align:start
I have no way of knowing

00:05:47.281 --> 00:05:49.584 position:19% line:83% align:start
what's going on
internally with Toman.

00:05:49.617 --> 00:05:52.787 position:13% line:83% align:start
And I barely even know
what this Valhalla gang is.

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.722 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hey, Gang-o-pedia.

00:05:54.755 --> 00:05:55.857 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:57.692 position:24% line:89% align:start
Okay, I'll explain.

00:05:57.725 --> 00:05:59.426 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'll try to use small words.

00:06:00.628 --> 00:06:01.929 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(chalk scratching)
-(mysterious music)

00:06:01.963 --> 00:06:05.199 position:16% line:83% align:start
The Tokyo Mangi Gang,
or just Toman for short.

00:06:05.233 --> 00:06:06.834 position:27% line:83% align:start
The commander, of
course, is Mikey,

00:06:06.868 --> 00:06:08.636 position:21% line:83% align:start
and the vice
commander is Draken.

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:10.370 position:10% line:89% align:start
Under them are five divisions

00:06:10.403 --> 00:06:12.540 position:21% line:83% align:start
with about 20 members
in each division,

00:06:12.573 --> 00:06:15.009 position:27% line:83% align:start
which makes Toman
a huge biker gang

00:06:15.042 --> 00:06:17.712 position:7% line:89% align:start
with about 100 active members.

00:06:17.745 --> 00:06:19.881 position:24% line:83% align:start
Everyone following
all this so far?

00:06:19.914 --> 00:06:22.149 position:21% line:89% align:start
Whoa, I had no idea.

00:06:22.183 --> 00:06:23.317 position:24% line:89% align:start
Are you kidding me?

00:06:23.351 --> 00:06:25.485 position:21% line:83% align:start
And you call yourself
a delinquent?!

00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:26.554 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Sorry.

00:06:26.587 --> 00:06:28.155 position:24% line:83% align:start
You'd better start
taking some notes.

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:30.057 position:27% line:83% align:start
This is all gonna
be on the test.

00:06:30.091 --> 00:06:31.092 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(boys snickering)
-Huh?

00:06:31.125 --> 00:06:32.894 position:10% line:89% align:start
You three, quit goofing off!

00:06:32.927 --> 00:06:35.696 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Takuya] (snickers) Talk
about overplaying the part.

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.464 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Kazushi] From what
I had heard recently,

00:06:37.497 --> 00:06:39.166 position:19% line:83% align:start
the former third
division captain, Pah,

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.269 position:13% line:89% align:start
was arrested by the police,

00:06:41.302 --> 00:06:43.170 position:27% line:83% align:start
and so his former
vice captain, Peh,

00:06:43.204 --> 00:06:45.139 position:27% line:83% align:start
was moved to the
second division.

00:06:45.172 --> 00:06:46.140 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:06:46.173 --> 00:06:47.440 position:24% line:89% align:start
I didn't know that!

00:06:47.474 --> 00:06:49.409 position:19% line:83% align:start
So they put Peh in the
division under Mitsuya?

00:06:49.442 --> 00:06:50.845 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Kazushi] Yes.

00:06:50.878 --> 00:06:52.747 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] That means I'm in
the same division with Peh!

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.782 position:19% line:83% align:start
That guy's had it in
for me from the start!

00:06:54.815 --> 00:06:55.783 position:35% line:89% align:start
Takemitchy!

00:06:55.816 --> 00:06:57.585 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] Even
his voice is scary.

00:06:57.618 --> 00:07:01.421 position:7% line:83% align:start
And the one who took his place
as third division captain?

00:07:01.454 --> 00:07:03.824 position:27% line:89% align:start
(grunts) Kisaki.

00:07:03.858 --> 00:07:05.026 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's right.

00:07:05.059 --> 00:07:06.627 position:16% line:89% align:start
Former leader of Moebius.

00:07:06.661 --> 00:07:08.296 position:7% line:89% align:start
Moebius was a fractured entity

00:07:08.329 --> 00:07:10.398 position:21% line:83% align:start
right from the start
of its existence.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.234 position:19% line:83% align:start
One half was born in
1988 and led by Osanai

00:07:13.267 --> 00:07:15.536 position:5% line:89% align:start
and the other in 1990 by Kisaki,

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:17.405 position:21% line:83% align:start
and they were always
butting heads.

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:18.506 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Atsushi] Hmm.

00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:20.440 position:24% line:83% align:start
So even though they
were all one gang,

00:07:20.473 --> 00:07:22.143 position:24% line:83% align:start
there was a lot of
internal conflict.

00:07:22.176 --> 00:07:24.278 position:27% line:83% align:start
After Osanai got
beaten by Mikey,

00:07:24.312 --> 00:07:26.747 position:5% line:89% align:start
Moebius was basically disbanded.

00:07:26.781 --> 00:07:30.483 position:13% line:83% align:start
And then the 1990 group
led by Kisaki joined Toman,

00:07:30.518 --> 00:07:32.452 position:19% line:83% align:start
which resulted in
Toman growing instantly

00:07:32.485 --> 00:07:35.423 position:16% line:89% align:start
from 100 members to 150.

00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:37.591 position:5% line:89% align:start
It also meant that within Toman,

00:07:37.625 --> 00:07:39.994 position:19% line:83% align:start
Kisaki's third division
ended up way bigger

00:07:40.027 --> 00:07:41.295 position:16% line:89% align:start
than any other division.

00:07:41.329 --> 00:07:43.463 position:24% line:83% align:start
Kisaki's bad news,
but he's strong.

00:07:43.496 --> 00:07:46.367 position:16% line:83% align:start
And in the future, we'll
need that strength.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.868 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi huffs)

00:07:47.902 --> 00:07:50.237 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Takuya] Then what happened
to the Moebius members

00:07:50.271 --> 00:07:51.973 position:7% line:89% align:start
that were followers of Osanai?

00:07:52.006 --> 00:07:54.675 position:13% line:83% align:start
The remaining members
from the '88 and '90 gangs

00:07:54.709 --> 00:07:58.245 position:7% line:83% align:start
joined together under a
different leader: Shuji Hanma.

00:07:59.413 --> 00:08:00.614 position:44% line:89% align:start
Him?!

00:08:02.083 --> 00:08:04.318 position:21% line:89% align:start
(gasps) That's right.

00:08:04.352 --> 00:08:06.053 position:10% line:89% align:start
At the battle on August 3rd,

00:08:06.087 --> 00:08:08.488 position:19% line:83% align:start
he said he was just the
temporary commander.

00:08:08.522 --> 00:08:11.459 position:16% line:83% align:start
So then Hanma took those
remaining Moebius members

00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:13.493 position:16% line:83% align:start
and joined them with all
the anti-Toman forces

00:08:13.527 --> 00:08:15.997 position:24% line:89% align:start
to create Valhalla.

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:19.333 position:13% line:83% align:start
Valhalla's sitting at about
300 members right now.

00:08:19.367 --> 00:08:20.868 position:13% line:89% align:start
You've gotta be kidding me!

00:08:22.003 --> 00:08:24.605 position:24% line:83% align:start
That freak is
commanding 300 men?

00:08:24.638 --> 00:08:28.509 position:19% line:83% align:start
(tuts) He's the acting
commander, remember.

00:08:28.542 --> 00:08:31.278 position:19% line:83% align:start
No one knows yet who
the real commander is.

00:08:31.312 --> 00:08:34.148 position:13% line:89% align:start
The commander has no face.

00:08:34.181 --> 00:08:36.183 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's why they call Valhalla

00:08:36.217 --> 00:08:37.718 position:24% line:89% align:start
The Headless Angel.

00:08:39.186 --> 00:08:42.189 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] So that's
the gang Baji's with now.

00:08:42.223 --> 00:08:44.859 position:16% line:83% align:start
I guess I'm gonna have to
meet with him in person

00:08:44.892 --> 00:08:47.561 position:13% line:83% align:start
and then try to convince
him to come back to Toman.

00:08:48.329 --> 00:08:49.530 position:38% line:89% align:start
But how?

00:08:52.666 --> 00:08:54.168 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Hey, there.
-Huh?

00:08:54.201 --> 00:08:56.070 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Kazutora] I'm looking
for a second-year kid

00:08:56.103 --> 00:08:57.071 position:30% line:89% align:start
named Hanagaki.

00:08:57.104 --> 00:08:59.140 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Uh...
-He's in Class 3.

00:08:59.173 --> 00:09:00.374 position:38% line:89% align:start
Ah, cool.

00:09:00.408 --> 00:09:01.609 position:27% line:89% align:start
Okay, thank you.

00:09:03.878 --> 00:09:06.580 position:35% line:89% align:start
(both sigh)

00:09:06.614 --> 00:09:09.083 position:16% line:83% align:start
Since when is there a guy
that hot at our school?

00:09:09.116 --> 00:09:11.952 position:16% line:83% align:start
With shoes like those,
he must be a third-year.

00:09:11.986 --> 00:09:13.587 position:24% line:83% align:start
The former Moebius
members are led

00:09:13.621 --> 00:09:16.457 position:21% line:83% align:start
by Valhalla's Number
Two, Shuji Hanma,

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:18.292 position:27% line:83% align:start
while the other
anti-Toman forces

00:09:18.325 --> 00:09:19.427 position:13% line:89% align:start
gather under the leadership

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:23.597 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(chalk scratching)
-(Takemichi sighs)

00:09:23.631 --> 00:09:26.600 position:19% line:83% align:start
of their Number Three,
Kazutora Hanemiya.

00:09:26.634 --> 00:09:28.102 position:30% line:89% align:start
(door rattles)

00:09:28.135 --> 00:09:29.103 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:09:29.136 --> 00:09:30.104 position:35% line:89% align:start
[Both] Huh?

00:09:30.137 --> 00:09:31.138 position:35% line:89% align:start
[Both] Huh?

00:09:35.009 --> 00:09:35.810 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hi, there.

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:47.588 position:21% line:89% align:start
Did I get here late?

00:09:47.621 --> 00:09:49.757 position:16% line:89% align:start
Are classes over already?

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:51.425 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Makoto] Who the hell are you?

00:09:51.459 --> 00:09:52.927 position:24% line:83% align:start
I've never seen you
around here before.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.096 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, that's not a very
polite thing to say!

00:09:55.129 --> 00:09:57.264 position:19% line:83% align:start
No respect for an
upperclassman, I guess.

00:09:57.298 --> 00:09:59.300 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh? What are you talking about?

00:09:59.333 --> 00:10:00.968 position:13% line:89% align:start
I've never seen you before.

00:10:01.001 --> 00:10:04.205 position:30% line:89% align:start
Uh, uh, uh-oh.

00:10:04.238 --> 00:10:05.239 position:47% line:89% align:start
Uh.

00:10:07.074 --> 00:10:09.477 position:19% line:83% align:start
Watch what the hell
you're saying, Makoto!

00:10:09.511 --> 00:10:11.546 position:24% line:83% align:start
He's got a tiger
tattoo on his neck!

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:13.214 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh, yeah? So what?

00:10:13.247 --> 00:10:16.917 position:16% line:83% align:start
Anyway, do you guys
know Takemichi Hanagaki?

00:10:16.951 --> 00:10:17.918 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, my God!

00:10:17.952 --> 00:10:18.919 position:35% line:89% align:start
Takemichi!

00:10:18.953 --> 00:10:19.753 position:38% line:89% align:start
It's him!

00:10:20.589 --> 00:10:22.089 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:10:22.123 --> 00:10:23.257 position:35% line:89% align:start
Takemichi?

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:24.792 position:13% line:89% align:start
You guys, it's really him!

00:10:24.825 --> 00:10:26.293 position:16% line:89% align:start
Valhalla's Number Three!

00:10:27.495 --> 00:10:31.465 position:24% line:5% align:start
-Kazutora Hanemiya!
-(tense music)

00:10:31.499 --> 00:10:33.801 position:35% line:89% align:start
(all gasp)

00:10:33.834 --> 00:10:35.636 position:19% line:89% align:start
(laughs) Hey, awesome!

00:10:35.669 --> 00:10:36.804 position:33% line:89% align:start
I found you!

00:10:36.837 --> 00:10:38.706 position:19% line:83% align:start
I can't believe there's
a kid at my school

00:10:38.739 --> 00:10:39.974 position:21% line:89% align:start
who belongs to Toman.

00:10:40.007 --> 00:10:42.376 position:19% line:83% align:start
-'Kay, now, Takemichi-
-Huh?

00:10:42.409 --> 00:10:44.546 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm taking you to
Valhalla's base.

00:10:44.579 --> 00:10:46.247 position:35% line:89% align:start
Huh? What?!

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.082 position:16% line:89% align:start
Boys! I found Takemichi!

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:49.817 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:52.521 position:27% line:83% align:start
-So this is him?
-Yup.

00:10:52.554 --> 00:10:54.855 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] Um, are
these guys with you?

00:10:54.889 --> 00:10:55.856 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yep.

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:57.758 position:21% line:83% align:start
These two are my most
trusted lieutenants.

00:10:58.926 --> 00:11:01.162 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] Uh, but
what happened to them?

00:11:01.195 --> 00:11:02.930 position:21% line:83% align:start
They're both walking
with crutches.

00:11:04.098 --> 00:11:06.200 position:27% line:83% align:start
Oh, I broke their
legs yesterday.

00:11:06.233 --> 00:11:07.502 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:11:07.536 --> 00:11:10.171 position:7% line:83% align:start
Why would you break the legs
of your own most-trusted guys?

00:11:10.204 --> 00:11:11.640 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Kazutora] Hmm.

00:11:11.672 --> 00:11:13.774 position:19% line:83% align:start
You got a problem with
what the boss does?

00:11:13.807 --> 00:11:16.277 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Uh, no.
-Good.

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:18.679 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] How can these
two be so calm and obedient

00:11:18.712 --> 00:11:21.382 position:16% line:83% align:start
when he's literally just
broken both their legs?

00:11:21.415 --> 00:11:22.683 position:16% line:89% align:start
And how could he do that?

00:11:22.716 --> 00:11:24.318 position:24% line:89% align:start
He must be insane!

00:11:24.351 --> 00:11:26.220 position:7% line:89% align:start
Hey, hurry up there, Takemichi!

00:11:26.253 --> 00:11:28.455 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] I can't
believe I'm with Kazutora,

00:11:28.489 --> 00:11:29.924 position:16% line:89% align:start
Valhalla's Number Three!

00:11:29.957 --> 00:11:33.027 position:7% line:83% align:start
If I go with this guy, I could
end up in serious trouble.

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:35.362 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'd be going straight
to the enemy's base.

00:11:35.396 --> 00:11:37.532 position:5% line:89% align:start
I can introduce you to everyone.

00:11:37.566 --> 00:11:39.700 position:7% line:89% align:start
You got nothing to worry about.

00:11:39.733 --> 00:11:40.935 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Everyone?

00:11:40.968 --> 00:11:43.237 position:21% line:83% align:start
Wait, then this could
be the chance I needed

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:44.305 position:27% line:89% align:start
to talk to Baji.

00:11:45.574 --> 00:11:48.075 position:24% line:83% align:start
But still, this is
some scary shit.

00:11:49.476 --> 00:11:52.479 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi exhales)

00:11:54.315 --> 00:11:56.951 position:21% line:89% align:start
(students chattering)

00:11:56.984 --> 00:11:59.420 position:16% line:83% align:start
Wow, I'm so glad school's
finally over today.

00:11:59.453 --> 00:12:01.288 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Aren't you?
-Yeah, totally!

00:12:01.322 --> 00:12:02.089 position:27% line:89% align:start
Where do you feel

00:12:02.122 --> 00:12:03.558 position:24% line:83% align:start
-like going today?
-Uh, how about

00:12:03.592 --> 00:12:05.059 position:13% line:83% align:start
-that new ice cream place?
-Hina.

00:12:05.092 --> 00:12:06.894 position:13% line:83% align:start
-I really wanna try it!
-Yeah, that's a great idea!

00:12:08.563 --> 00:12:10.064 position:16% line:89% align:start
I swore to you back then

00:12:10.898 --> 00:12:12.800 position:21% line:83% align:start
that I'd do anything
to protect you.

00:12:15.704 --> 00:12:18.038 position:19% line:89% align:start
So Valhalla's base? Ha!

00:12:19.708 --> 00:12:20.908 position:33% line:89% align:start
Bring it on.

00:12:22.409 --> 00:12:24.011 position:24% line:89% align:start
Mikey promised me.

00:12:24.044 --> 00:12:27.081 position:19% line:83% align:start
If I can just get Baji
to come back to Toman,

00:12:27.114 --> 00:12:29.216 position:10% line:89% align:start
then he'll get rid of Kisaki.

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:32.886 position:10% line:83% align:start
And if Kisaki's out of Toman,
then the future will change.

00:12:34.955 --> 00:12:37.958 position:19% line:83% align:start
I am not gonna let that
future happen again.

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:40.794 position:35% line:89% align:start
Just watch!

00:12:40.828 --> 00:12:41.996 position:27% line:89% align:start
You'll see, Hina!

00:12:47.368 --> 00:12:49.169 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:12:49.203 --> 00:12:51.372 position:33% line:89% align:start
(all exhale)

00:12:54.975 --> 00:12:58.379 position:16% line:89% align:start
(pedestrians chattering)

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:01.348 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Delinquent] Who gave you
permission to breathe,

00:13:01.382 --> 00:13:02.783 position:16% line:89% align:start
you little piece of shit?

00:13:02.816 --> 00:13:05.520 position:19% line:89% align:start
Hey, uh, Hanemiya, sir?

00:13:05.553 --> 00:13:06.521 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:13:06.554 --> 00:13:08.556 position:19% line:89% align:start
Just call me Kazutora.

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:10.924 position:30% line:89% align:start
Okay, well, um,

00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.728 position:19% line:83% align:start
at our school, you're a
third-year now, right?

00:13:13.762 --> 00:13:15.229 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Kazutora] Yes.

00:13:15.262 --> 00:13:18.465 position:13% line:83% align:start
It just seems like it would
be a lot more widely known

00:13:18.499 --> 00:13:21.902 position:16% line:83% align:start
that our school had a
student as famous as you.

00:13:21.935 --> 00:13:23.804 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Kazutora] Well, I
only went to school

00:13:23.837 --> 00:13:25.740 position:21% line:83% align:start
the first term of
my first year there.

00:13:25.774 --> 00:13:27.509 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:13:27.542 --> 00:13:29.143 position:13% line:89% align:start
After that, I was in juvie.

00:13:29.176 --> 00:13:30.177 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?!

00:13:30.844 --> 00:13:33.581 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Kazutora chuckles)

00:13:33.615 --> 00:13:34.982 position:27% line:89% align:start
You got arrested?

00:13:36.016 --> 00:13:37.851 position:16% line:89% align:start
What was that all about?

00:13:38.952 --> 00:13:40.888 position:16% line:89% align:start
That was because of him.

00:13:42.356 --> 00:13:44.358 position:24% line:83% align:start
We're almost to our
headquarters now.

00:13:44.391 --> 00:13:45.560 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Him?

00:13:45.593 --> 00:13:47.361 position:19% line:89% align:start
Who's he talking about?

00:13:47.394 --> 00:13:49.798 position:10% line:83% align:start
Well, first, I need to
worry about getting Baji out

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:52.066 position:24% line:83% align:start
without all of
Valhalla noticing.

00:13:52.099 --> 00:13:52.900 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:13:55.737 --> 00:13:57.838 position:27% line:89% align:start
Huh? This is it?

00:13:57.871 --> 00:14:00.207 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Yup.
-An arcade?

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.042 position:24% line:83% align:start
It went out of
business years ago.

00:14:06.614 --> 00:14:09.316 position:13% line:89% align:start
(gasps) The Headless Angel!

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:17.525 position:33% line:89% align:start
(doors thud)

00:14:17.559 --> 00:14:20.394 position:21% line:89% align:start
(members chattering)

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:32.873 position:13% line:83% align:start
They've definitely got a
different vibe than Toman.

00:14:32.906 --> 00:14:35.175 position:30% line:89% align:start
(ominous music)

00:14:39.413 --> 00:14:44.418 position:21% line:83% align:start
-(someone grunting)
-(something thumping)

00:14:46.353 --> 00:14:47.388 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasps)

00:14:47.421 --> 00:14:51.058 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(punches thumping)
-(victim gurgling)

00:14:51.091 --> 00:14:54.161 position:21% line:89% align:start
(gasps) That's Baji!

00:14:55.362 --> 00:14:57.064 position:30% line:89% align:start
Whoa, Kazutora!

00:14:57.097 --> 00:14:58.932 position:7% line:89% align:start
What the hell's going on here?

00:14:58.966 --> 00:14:59.967 position:33% line:89% align:start
What is this?

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.301 position:21% line:89% align:start
What's it look like?

00:15:01.335 --> 00:15:02.737 position:27% line:89% align:start
A test of faith.

00:15:02.771 --> 00:15:04.071 position:38% line:89% align:start
What for?

00:15:04.104 --> 00:15:07.207 position:19% line:83% align:start
To test Baji's
commitment to Valhalla.

00:15:07.241 --> 00:15:10.010 position:16% line:83% align:start
Going from Toman to us is
like changing religions.

00:15:10.043 --> 00:15:12.913 position:19% line:83% align:start
You have to prove to
us you really mean it.

00:15:12.946 --> 00:15:14.849 position:21% line:83% align:start
The guy Baji's
beating on right now

00:15:14.883 --> 00:15:17.384 position:19% line:83% align:start
is Toman's first
division vice captain.

00:15:17.418 --> 00:15:19.788 position:24% line:83% align:start
He was Baji's most
trusted lieutenant.

00:15:19.821 --> 00:15:21.756 position:21% line:83% align:start
The first division's
vice captain?!

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:23.991 position:13% line:89% align:start
Toman is Valhalla's enemy.

00:15:25.959 --> 00:15:28.929 position:19% line:83% align:start
If he's going to betray
his former god Mikey,

00:15:28.962 --> 00:15:30.899 position:21% line:83% align:start
he's gotta stomp
out his old beliefs.

00:15:30.931 --> 00:15:35.936 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(Baji panting)
-(foreboding music)

00:15:41.676 --> 00:15:45.946 position:16% line:83% align:start
(exhales) Well, then, was
that good enough for you?

00:15:45.979 --> 00:15:47.549 position:27% line:89% align:start
What do you say?

00:15:47.582 --> 00:15:49.149 position:21% line:89% align:start
Am I in Valhalla now,

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:56.390 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hanma?

00:15:57.659 --> 00:15:59.193 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Hanma chuckles)

00:15:59.226 --> 00:16:01.495 position:5% line:89% align:start
That was some brutal shit, dude.

00:16:01.529 --> 00:16:04.131 position:19% line:83% align:start
That guy's been by your
side, like, forever.

00:16:04.164 --> 00:16:06.333 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yeah, I'm surprised
you took it that far.

00:16:07.367 --> 00:16:08.803 position:27% line:89% align:start
(member exhales)

00:16:08.837 --> 00:16:10.404 position:38% line:89% align:start
Shut up.

00:16:10.437 --> 00:16:12.507 position:24% line:83% align:start
I don't care about
your opinions.

00:16:15.476 --> 00:16:17.444 position:38% line:89% align:start
Kazutora!

00:16:17.478 --> 00:16:18.445 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hey, boss.

00:16:19.681 --> 00:16:21.649 position:27% line:89% align:start
You all set now?

00:16:21.683 --> 00:16:22.817 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah!

00:16:22.851 --> 00:16:26.019 position:24% line:83% align:start
Let me present
Takemichi Hanagaki.

00:16:26.053 --> 00:16:27.454 position:5% line:89% align:start
He's the newest member of Toman.

00:16:27.488 --> 00:16:28.489 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Huh?!

00:16:30.324 --> 00:16:31.425 position:41% line:89% align:start
Oh, no!

00:16:31.458 --> 00:16:34.027 position:13% line:83% align:start
Don't tell me the next test
of faith victim is...?!

00:16:44.906 --> 00:16:46.406 position:21% line:89% align:start
So, you're Hanagaki?

00:16:48.442 --> 00:16:49.611 position:33% line:89% align:start
Step forward.

00:16:50.745 --> 00:16:54.381 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Go!
-(Takemichi grunts)

00:16:54.414 --> 00:16:56.083 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasps)

00:16:56.116 --> 00:16:58.318 position:24% line:89% align:start
You again. Dumbass.

00:16:58.352 --> 00:17:00.053 position:5% line:89% align:start
Did you come here to get killed?

00:17:01.121 --> 00:17:02.122 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Member] Kill him!

00:17:02.757 --> 00:17:03.725 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Members] Kill him!

00:17:03.758 --> 00:17:04.826 position:38% line:89% align:start
Kill him!

00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:05.760 position:38% line:89% align:start
Kill him!

00:17:05.793 --> 00:17:06.761 position:38% line:89% align:start
Kill him!

00:17:06.794 --> 00:17:07.695 position:38% line:89% align:start
Kill him!

00:17:07.729 --> 00:17:09.062 position:38% line:89% align:start
Kill him!

00:17:09.096 --> 00:17:10.798 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] I came
here to take Baji back,

00:17:10.832 --> 00:17:12.534 position:10% line:89% align:start
but now Baji's gonna kill me!

00:17:12.567 --> 00:17:13.333 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Members] Kill him!

00:17:13.367 --> 00:17:14.334 position:38% line:89% align:start
Kill him!

00:17:14.368 --> 00:17:15.335 position:38% line:89% align:start
Kill him!

00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:16.370 position:38% line:89% align:start
Kill him!

00:17:18.071 --> 00:17:20.340 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Hanma] One of Toman's
founding members

00:17:20.374 --> 00:17:24.077 position:19% line:83% align:start
and its first division
captain, Keisuke Baji!

00:17:24.111 --> 00:17:27.147 position:21% line:83% align:start
He now says he wants
to leave Toman behind

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:28.448 position:24% line:89% align:start
and join Valhalla.

00:17:28.482 --> 00:17:29.884 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Toman's fishy to me.
-(members murmuring)

00:17:29.918 --> 00:17:32.520 position:21% line:83% align:start
Is that a good thing
or a bad thing?

00:17:32.554 --> 00:17:33.521 position:24% line:89% align:start
A good thing, duh.

00:17:33.555 --> 00:17:35.389 position:27% line:83% align:start
Sounds too good
to be true to me.

00:17:35.422 --> 00:17:37.090 position:13% line:89% align:start
For those of you wondering,

00:17:37.124 --> 00:17:39.894 position:21% line:83% align:start
the fact is, this is
one hell of a deal.

00:17:39.928 --> 00:17:42.462 position:24% line:83% align:start
Having Baji here
will be a huge help

00:17:42.496 --> 00:17:44.464 position:21% line:83% align:start
in our plan to
finally crush Toman.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:48.002 position:19% line:83% align:start
But for right now,
there's still one thing

00:17:48.036 --> 00:17:50.605 position:24% line:83% align:start
that we need to be
absolutely sure of.

00:17:52.205 --> 00:17:56.310 position:13% line:83% align:start
Because for all we know, he
might just be a Toman spy!

00:17:56.343 --> 00:17:58.613 position:21% line:83% align:start
Which is why we took
the extra precaution

00:17:58.646 --> 00:18:01.649 position:24% line:83% align:start
of having Kazutora
bring us a witness.

00:18:01.683 --> 00:18:03.150 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasps)

00:18:03.183 --> 00:18:05.687 position:13% line:83% align:start
This court will now summon
the witness to testify!

00:18:09.791 --> 00:18:11.391 position:24% line:89% align:start
Takemichi Hanagaki.

00:18:11.425 --> 00:18:13.528 position:33% line:89% align:start
Uh, uh, yes?

00:18:13.561 --> 00:18:16.430 position:16% line:83% align:start
Will you tell this
court exactly what words

00:18:16.463 --> 00:18:20.100 position:13% line:83% align:start
you heard Baji here say
at the last Toman meeting?

00:18:20.133 --> 00:18:21.134 position:38% line:89% align:start
Well, he,

00:18:22.235 --> 00:18:25.039 position:16% line:83% align:start
he said that he quit and
that from that day on,

00:18:25.073 --> 00:18:26.741 position:16% line:89% align:start
Toman would be his enemy.

00:18:28.943 --> 00:18:31.278 position:5% line:89% align:start
And Kazutora, what do you think?

00:18:31.311 --> 00:18:34.114 position:19% line:83% align:start
We did a test of faith
and we heard a witness.

00:18:34.147 --> 00:18:36.383 position:7% line:89% align:start
So I think that's good enough.

00:18:36.416 --> 00:18:38.920 position:5% line:89% align:start
Baji could be very useful to us.

00:18:38.953 --> 00:18:41.756 position:13% line:83% align:start
He knows what's new with
Toman since I've been gone.

00:18:43.123 --> 00:18:45.492 position:21% line:83% align:start
He's definitely worth
having in Valhalla.

00:18:45.526 --> 00:18:46.326 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Hanma] Hmm.

00:18:47.829 --> 00:18:49.631 position:19% line:89% align:start
So are you sure, Baji?

00:18:49.664 --> 00:18:52.066 position:24% line:83% align:start
Because we're going
to crush Toman,

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:54.669 position:7% line:89% align:start
and in the process, of course,

00:18:54.702 --> 00:18:56.638 position:21% line:89% align:start
Mikey's going to die.

00:18:56.671 --> 00:18:59.272 position:33% line:89% align:start
(gasps) Huh?

00:19:01.174 --> 00:19:02.175 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Baji] Yeah.

00:19:03.443 --> 00:19:05.312 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll help you do that, Kazutora.

00:19:07.115 --> 00:19:08.516 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasps)

00:19:08.549 --> 00:19:10.283 position:24% line:83% align:start
Well, then, I
think it's decided.

00:19:12.419 --> 00:19:13.420 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:19:13.453 --> 00:19:14.622 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah!

00:19:14.656 --> 00:19:16.223 position:19% line:89% align:start
Then from this day on,

00:19:16.256 --> 00:19:19.861 position:13% line:83% align:start
Keisuke Baji is officially
a member of Valhalla!

00:19:19.894 --> 00:19:22.764 position:24% line:89% align:start
(members cheering)

00:19:26.067 --> 00:19:28.536 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Hanma giggles)

00:19:28.569 --> 00:19:30.104 position:41% line:89% align:start
No way!

00:19:30.138 --> 00:19:31.572 position:27% line:89% align:start
If this happens,

00:19:31.606 --> 00:19:34.241 position:10% line:83% align:start
I don't have a chance of
bringing Baji back to Toman.

00:19:34.274 --> 00:19:36.443 position:19% line:89% align:start
Hold on just a second!

00:19:36.476 --> 00:19:37.444 position:44% line:89% align:start
Baji!

00:19:37.477 --> 00:19:39.279 position:13% line:83% align:start
You're one of the
founding members of Toman,

00:19:39.312 --> 00:19:41.281 position:27% line:83% align:start
along with Mikey,
isn't that right?

00:19:41.314 --> 00:19:43.483 position:13% line:89% align:start
Why are you betraying them?

00:19:43.518 --> 00:19:45.853 position:16% line:83% align:start
What's being a founder
have to do with anything?

00:19:45.887 --> 00:19:48.321 position:16% line:89% align:start
Anyone can change sides.

00:19:48.355 --> 00:19:51.793 position:27% line:83% align:start
(scoffs) You know
nothing about it.

00:19:51.826 --> 00:19:55.195 position:13% line:83% align:start
If you did, you'd know he's
a founding member, too.

00:19:58.733 --> 00:20:00.668 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Kazutora chuckles)

00:20:00.702 --> 00:20:03.336 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasps)

00:20:04.505 --> 00:20:07.041 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] The sixth
guy in that photo I saw.

00:20:07.075 --> 00:20:08.509 position:27% line:89% align:start
It was Kazutora!

00:20:08.543 --> 00:20:11.211 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Baji] Kazutora has an
old grudge against Toman.

00:20:12.345 --> 00:20:14.148 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'll never forget it.

00:20:14.182 --> 00:20:16.316 position:24% line:89% align:start
The summer of 2003,

00:20:16.349 --> 00:20:18.886 position:19% line:83% align:start
when I was a first-year
in middle school,

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:20.353 position:21% line:89% align:start
we were running wild.

00:20:23.024 --> 00:20:25.159 position:10% line:89% align:start
It was the middle of summer,

00:20:25.193 --> 00:20:26.694 position:21% line:83% align:start
but it was a
slightly chilly day.

00:20:29.697 --> 00:20:32.567 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Kazutora] So Mikey asked
to see you too, huh?

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:33.935 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:20:33.968 --> 00:20:35.268 position:19% line:5% align:start
The usual place, right?

00:20:37.038 --> 00:20:39.006 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hand over your money, you twerp!

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:40.608 position:7% line:89% align:start
I swear I don't have any more!

00:20:40.641 --> 00:20:41.809 position:30% line:83% align:start
-(blow thumps)
-(kid whimpers)

00:20:41.843 --> 00:20:42.677 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Whoa!
-Huh?

00:20:44.311 --> 00:20:46.480 position:19% line:5% align:start
Hey, sorry we're late!

00:20:46.514 --> 00:20:48.750 position:24% line:5% align:start
Baji decided to
beat up some punks.

00:20:48.783 --> 00:20:49.584 position:35% line:5% align:start
Hey, wait!

00:20:49.617 --> 00:20:51.251 position:24% line:83% align:start
Don't blame the
whole thing on me!

00:20:51.284 --> 00:20:53.286 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Pah] Whoa, this is
so freaking cool!

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:55.322 position:27% line:89% align:start
Uh, what's that?

00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:59.493 position:13% line:5% align:start
Look, the Toman jackets
are finally here, you guys!

00:20:59.527 --> 00:21:01.796 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Kazutora] Whoa!
That is awesome!

00:21:01.829 --> 00:21:02.997 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Pah] Right?!

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:04.932 position:13% line:89% align:start
The lettering is fantastic!

00:21:04.966 --> 00:21:07.034 position:13% line:89% align:start
Don't you love it, Mitsuya?

00:21:07.068 --> 00:21:08.401 position:5% line:5% align:start
Yeah, but it's no thanks to you.

00:21:08.435 --> 00:21:11.304 position:16% line:5% align:start
Not after you left all
of the hard work for me.

00:21:12.272 --> 00:21:13.273 position:35% line:89% align:start
All right!

00:21:13.306 --> 00:21:14.909 position:24% line:5% align:start
Now, let's hurry
up and get changed

00:21:14.942 --> 00:21:16.443 position:5% line:5% align:start
so we can go take some pictures.

00:21:17.145 --> 00:21:19.213 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yo, right, Mikey?

00:21:19.247 --> 00:21:21.048 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Mikey slurping)

00:21:21.082 --> 00:21:22.449 position:33% line:5% align:start
[Mikey] Hmm?

00:21:23.416 --> 00:21:24.819 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Draken] What?! You bastard!

00:21:24.852 --> 00:21:27.588 position:10% line:83% align:start
Why the hell are you eating
all of my chocolate parfait?!

00:21:27.622 --> 00:21:28.388 position:35% line:89% align:start
[Mikey] Oh.

00:21:28.421 --> 00:21:29.624 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yeah, sorry about that.

00:21:29.657 --> 00:21:32.126 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Draken] I said you
could have one bite!

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:34.294 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Mitsuya] So just
order another one.

00:21:34.327 --> 00:21:35.630 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Draken] (growls)
That's not the point!

00:21:35.663 --> 00:21:37.330 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Kazutora] What is
the point, then?

00:21:37.364 --> 00:21:40.668 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Draken] I wanted to eat
this chocolate parfait!

00:21:40.701 --> 00:21:41.903 position:38% line:89% align:start
[Pah] Oh.

00:21:41.936 --> 00:21:42.870 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Draken] What?!

00:21:42.904 --> 00:21:44.839 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Baji] God, why are
you always like that?

00:21:44.872 --> 00:21:45.973 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Draken] What? Ugh!

00:21:46.007 --> 00:21:47.474 position:19% line:89% align:start
Get your asses outside.

00:21:47.508 --> 00:21:49.376 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Mikey] Hey, thanks
for the grub!

00:21:49.409 --> 00:21:51.846 position:30% line:89% align:start
(boys laughing)

00:21:51.879 --> 00:21:53.014 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Draken] Ugh, whatever.

00:21:53.047 --> 00:21:54.882 position:16% line:89% align:start
(pedestrians chattering)

00:21:54.916 --> 00:21:55.917 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Mikey] Hey!

00:21:56.584 --> 00:21:58.351 position:7% line:89% align:start
I, I'm gonna take the picture.

00:21:58.385 --> 00:22:00.021 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Draken] Don't talk, just do it!

00:22:00.054 --> 00:22:00.822 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Picture Taker] Okay, everyone.

00:22:00.855 --> 00:22:02.690 position:35% line:89% align:start
Say cheese.

00:22:02.723 --> 00:22:05.392 position:30% line:89% align:start
(camera clicks)

00:22:08.129 --> 00:22:11.199 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Baji] No one could've imagined
what would happen next,

00:22:11.232 --> 00:22:13.333 position:27% line:83% align:start
not even in their
wildest dreams.

00:22:17.905 --> 00:22:20.975 position:5% line:89% align:start
(closing theme music)

00:22:24.645 --> 00:22:28.549 position:7% line:89% align:start
(vocalist singing in Japanese)
