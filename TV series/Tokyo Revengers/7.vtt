Ha. You get out of my
way, you little shrimp.

00:20:41.576 --> 00:20:42.744 position:44% line:89% align:start
Stop.

00:20:42.777 --> 00:20:43.811 position:35% line:89% align:start
Stop this.

00:20:43.845 --> 00:20:45.445 position:19% line:83% align:start
Quit acting like you're
a couple of dumb punks.

00:20:45.479 --> 00:20:46.714 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Draken And Mikey] Huh?

00:20:46.748 --> 00:20:48.549 position:24% line:83% align:start
Is he actually
trying to stop 'em?

00:20:48.583 --> 00:20:51.284 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Eek.
-Does he have a death wish?

00:20:51.318 --> 00:20:53.420 position:21% line:83% align:start
The dude just got
out of the hospital.

00:20:53.453 --> 00:20:55.790 position:13% line:83% align:start
I don't know what happened
to start this between you,

00:20:55.823 --> 00:20:57.324 position:24% line:89% align:start
but this is stupid.

00:20:57.357 --> 00:20:59.627 position:24% line:83% align:start
Both of you need to
just chill out now.

00:21:01.629 --> 00:21:02.429 position:44% line:89% align:start
Whoa.

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:05.600 position:21% line:83% align:start
Just who the hell do
you think you are?

00:21:05.633 --> 00:21:06.934 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi Voiceover] Oh shit.

00:21:06.968 --> 00:21:09.336 position:19% line:83% align:start
Why did I think I could
actually stop these two

00:21:09.369 --> 00:21:11.005 position:30% line:89% align:start
from fighting?

00:21:11.038 --> 00:21:14.441 position:19% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi whimpering)

00:21:15.977 --> 00:21:16.944 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Draken And Takemichi] Huh?

00:21:16.978 --> 00:21:17.812 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi Voiceover] Wait.

00:21:17.845 --> 00:21:19.547 position:24% line:83% align:start
Maybe Mikey took
the hint after all.

00:21:20.748 --> 00:21:21.716 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasping)

00:21:21.749 --> 00:21:24.218 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hey, Mikey, that's
my precious Hayate.

00:21:24.252 --> 00:21:26.053 position:16% line:89% align:start
So be careful, would ya?

00:21:26.087 --> 00:21:27.789 position:30% line:89% align:start
(bike crashing)

00:21:27.822 --> 00:21:29.056 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi screaming)

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:30.625 position:5% line:89% align:start
My childhood memories destroyed.

00:21:32.794 --> 00:21:33.895 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh yeah?

00:21:33.928 --> 00:21:35.763 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's like that?

00:21:35.797 --> 00:21:37.064 position:30% line:89% align:start
Draken, don't.

00:21:37.098 --> 00:21:38.431 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's the golden bat I used

00:21:38.465 --> 00:21:40.802 position:16% line:83% align:start
to hit my very first
home run in fourth grade.

00:21:40.835 --> 00:21:42.937 position:19% line:83% align:start
So, you want to dance,
then we'll dance.

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:45.973 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi squealing)

00:21:46.007 --> 00:21:47.608 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Stop, Mikey.

00:21:47.642 --> 00:21:49.877 position:13% line:83% align:start
That's from when I went to
the festival with my dad.

00:21:49.911 --> 00:21:51.344 position:30% line:89% align:start
No, Draken, no.

00:21:51.378 --> 00:21:53.346 position:21% line:83% align:start
I saved up forever to
buy that skateboard.

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:58.385 position:10% line:83% align:start
-(Mikey and Draken grunting)
-(rock music)

00:21:59.854 --> 00:22:02.322 position:16% line:83% align:start
You wanna settle this
thing right here and now?

00:22:03.191 --> 00:22:04.826 position:33% line:89% align:start
Fine with me.

00:22:04.859 --> 00:22:05.827 position:33% line:89% align:start
Bring it on.

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:07.962 position:33% line:89% align:start
(rock music)

00:22:08.796 --> 00:22:11.331 position:27% line:89% align:start
You two assholes.

00:22:12.499 --> 00:22:14.467 position:21% line:89% align:start
Time to cut the shit.

00:22:17.972 --> 00:22:20.473 position:21% line:89% align:start
(closing theme music)

00:22:26.948 --> 00:22:30.785 position:21% line:89% align:start
(singing in Japanese)
