00:00:07.675 --> 00:00:10.612 position:13% line:89% align:start
(panting, slowing breaths)

00:00:10.645 --> 00:00:12.547 position:21% line:89% align:start
Draken where are you?

00:00:17.986 --> 00:00:20.220 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Gang Member] You
ready for this?

00:00:20.254 --> 00:00:21.054 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:29.496 position:10% line:83% align:start
Because of him and what he
did I lost everything I had.

00:00:29.531 --> 00:00:30.330 position:38% line:89% align:start
Kiyomasa?

00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:35.202 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna find Draken, and
then I'm gonna kill him.

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:37.772 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Akaishi] Hey, look who I found!

00:00:37.805 --> 00:00:39.607 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Let go of me!

00:00:39.641 --> 00:00:40.875 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm gonna fix it

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:43.545 position:10% line:83% align:start
so you end up taking the fall
for the whole damn thing.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.749 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh! What happened?

00:00:47.782 --> 00:00:48.917 position:21% line:89% align:start
Who did this to you?

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.150 position:21% line:89% align:start
Here let me help you.

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:56.891 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry for leaving you alone.

00:00:56.925 --> 00:00:58.125 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:01:00.662 --> 00:01:02.129 position:13% line:89% align:start
I really suck at all this.

00:01:02.997 --> 00:01:04.464 position:19% line:89% align:start
Why would you say that?

00:01:04.498 --> 00:01:06.333 position:16% line:83% align:start
I haven't really
changed anything at all!

00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:08.570 position:27% line:83% align:start
I haven't managed
to save anyone!

00:01:10.203 --> 00:01:12.072 position:27% line:89% align:start
(crazed laughter)

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:14.374 position:24% line:83% align:start
But then what else
was I expecting?

00:01:14.408 --> 00:01:16.678 position:13% line:83% align:start
How the hell was a complete
and utter failure like me

00:01:16.711 --> 00:01:18.846 position:16% line:83% align:start
ever supposed to have a
snowball's chance in hell

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.748 position:27% line:89% align:start
at saving anyone?

00:01:20.782 --> 00:01:22.617 position:21% line:89% align:start
How stupid can I be?

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.851 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's not true.

00:01:23.885 --> 00:01:25.587 position:21% line:89% align:start
Just leave me alone!

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.921 position:41% line:89% align:start
I'm...

00:01:26.955 --> 00:01:29.356 position:38% line:89% align:start
(sobbing)

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:31.759 position:10% line:89% align:start
Nothing but a total failure.

00:01:33.795 --> 00:01:35.730 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasp)

00:01:42.837 --> 00:01:44.237 position:19% line:89% align:start
That was my first kiss.

00:01:44.973 --> 00:01:46.608 position:38% line:89% align:start
But why?

00:01:46.641 --> 00:01:49.711 position:16% line:83% align:start
I gave it to you because
you're that special.

00:01:49.744 --> 00:01:50.778 position:24% line:89% align:start
You're not Draken.

00:01:50.812 --> 00:01:53.014 position:10% line:89% align:start
And you're not Mikey either.

00:01:53.047 --> 00:01:54.616 position:27% line:89% align:start
You're just you.

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:56.249 position:27% line:89% align:start
You're Takemichi.

00:01:57.685 --> 00:02:00.287 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're not afraid to
cry for others' pain.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.323 position:16% line:83% align:start
And you get so frustrated
trying to help them.

00:02:03.357 --> 00:02:04.692 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's just who you are.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.495 position:19% line:83% align:start
If you ask me, there's
no one cooler than you.

00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:11.799 position:38% line:89% align:start
(sobbing)

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.476 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hinata, thank you.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.678 position:38% line:89% align:start
What for?

00:02:23.711 --> 00:02:24.912 position:21% line:89% align:start
I didn't do anything.

00:02:24.946 --> 00:02:26.480 position:38% line:89% align:start
I, uh...

00:02:26.514 --> 00:02:28.016 position:33% line:89% align:start
Don't worry!

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:29.751 position:7% line:89% align:start
You can do what you need to do.

00:02:29.784 --> 00:02:30.785 position:33% line:89% align:start
I have faith.

00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:34.656 position:38% line:89% align:start
(chuckle)

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:36.924 position:21% line:89% align:start
But now I have to go.

00:02:38.092 --> 00:02:40.695 position:21% line:83% align:start
This time, I'm going
to stop Kiyomasa!

00:02:40.728 --> 00:02:45.232 position:10% line:83% align:start
And then I'm going to
settle the trauma in my life

00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:46.366 position:27% line:89% align:start
once and for all!

00:02:47.568 --> 00:02:49.537 position:7% line:89% align:start
We've got big trouble, Takashi!

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.039 position:7% line:89% align:start
Draken's about to be attacked!

00:02:51.072 --> 00:02:53.007 position:7% line:89% align:start
Yeah I know, I heard about it.

00:02:53.041 --> 00:02:54.542 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Yeah it's Kiyomasa!
-That damn Peh.

00:02:54.575 --> 00:02:55.543 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:02:55.576 --> 00:02:56.577 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:02:57.779 --> 00:03:00.748 position:10% line:83% align:start
She probably went home
already, with all this rain.

00:03:00.782 --> 00:03:01.749 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Peh] Draken!

00:03:01.783 --> 00:03:02.784 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Hm?

00:03:03.951 --> 00:03:04.919 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh hey Peh.

00:03:04.952 --> 00:03:05.920 position:35% line:89% align:start
What's up?

00:03:05.953 --> 00:03:07.955 position:7% line:89% align:start
What's the deal with the sash?

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.858 position:27% line:89% align:start
(murderous growl)

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.129 position:24% line:83% align:start
Peh feels like
Toman screwed Pah.

00:03:15.163 --> 00:03:17.665 position:13% line:89% align:start
And let him take the fall.

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:19.466 position:21% line:89% align:start
But that isn't true!

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:22.003 position:21% line:83% align:start
What matters now is
that Peh got together

00:03:22.036 --> 00:03:23.638 position:10% line:89% align:start
with some former Moebius guys

00:03:23.671 --> 00:03:25.807 position:19% line:83% align:start
and told them he was
gonna take Draken out.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.307 position:27% line:89% align:start
So Peh's the one?

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.376 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Takashi] He's out
to hunt down Draken!

00:03:30.878 --> 00:03:31.979 position:19% line:89% align:start
What's the matter Peh?

00:03:32.013 --> 00:03:34.247 position:10% line:83% align:start
I don't think I've ever
seen you looking so serious!

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:39.453 position:35% line:89% align:start
Here, Emma.

00:03:39.486 --> 00:03:41.421 position:13% line:89% align:start
Go wait for me by the exit.

00:03:41.455 --> 00:03:42.255 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:03:45.927 --> 00:03:50.297 position:5% line:83% align:start
Peh, I guess you're still
pissed off about what happened.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.967 position:24% line:83% align:start
And you still think
it was my fault.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.367 position:24% line:89% align:start
Wanna throw hands?

00:03:55.837 --> 00:03:56.838 position:33% line:89% align:start
Let's do it.

00:04:14.222 --> 00:04:15.723 position:27% line:89% align:start
Draken, look out!

00:04:15.757 --> 00:04:17.225 position:41% line:89% align:start
(laugh)

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:20.260 position:27% line:89% align:start
(surprised gasp)

00:04:20.928 --> 00:04:25.933 position:21% line:89% align:start
(opening theme music)

00:05:53.486 --> 00:05:55.422 position:10% line:5% align:start
[Takemichi] We've gotta find
Draken and let him know!

00:05:55.455 --> 00:05:57.758 position:24% line:5% align:start
But since we saw
Peh's ride outside,

00:05:57.792 --> 00:05:59.594 position:24% line:83% align:start
shit might already
be going down.

00:06:01.596 --> 00:06:02.964 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasp)

00:06:02.997 --> 00:06:04.699 position:21% line:89% align:start
On August 3rd, 2005,

00:06:04.732 --> 00:06:06.399 position:24% line:83% align:start
in the parking lot
of Musashi Shrine

00:06:06.433 --> 00:06:08.401 position:10% line:89% align:start
in the Shibuya Ward of Tokyo,

00:06:08.435 --> 00:06:11.539 position:13% line:83% align:start
50 members of a biker gang
were involved in a brawl.

00:06:11.572 --> 00:06:13.674 position:16% line:83% align:start
A young man in his third
year of middle school

00:06:13.708 --> 00:06:16.043 position:19% line:83% align:start
was beaten and stabbed
in the abdomen.

00:06:16.077 --> 00:06:17.078 position:30% line:89% align:start
He later died.

00:06:18.512 --> 00:06:21.048 position:21% line:83% align:start
That middle school
student was Ryuguji.

00:06:21.082 --> 00:06:23.017 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Takashi, wait!

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:24.218 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:06:24.252 --> 00:06:25.553 position:27% line:89% align:start
The parking lot!

00:06:25.586 --> 00:06:28.222 position:10% line:83% align:start
Is there another one besides
the one we were just at?

00:06:28.256 --> 00:06:29.557 position:27% line:89% align:start
Uhh, I think so.

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.893 position:13% line:83% align:start
I think there's another
parking lot out back, but--

00:06:31.926 --> 00:06:32.894 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's it, then!

00:06:32.927 --> 00:06:33.728 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hey, wait up!

00:06:34.695 --> 00:06:36.396 position:13% line:89% align:start
Please let me make it time!

00:06:45.306 --> 00:06:46.507 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:06:50.511 --> 00:06:51.846 position:19% line:89% align:start
Now where is he going?

00:06:53.014 --> 00:06:54.682 position:24% line:89% align:start
Turn right up here!

00:06:54.715 --> 00:06:55.516 position:41% line:89% align:start
Got it!

00:06:57.018 --> 00:06:58.252 position:33% line:89% align:start
(sudden gasp)

00:06:58.286 --> 00:06:59.754 position:16% line:89% align:start
Half of Moebius is here!

00:06:59.787 --> 00:07:01.088 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Gang Member] Hey, come on.

00:07:01.122 --> 00:07:02.089 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hey, get up!

00:07:02.123 --> 00:07:03.490 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:07:03.524 --> 00:07:05.458 position:21% line:89% align:start
You want to fight us?

00:07:06.661 --> 00:07:08.095 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Gang Member] Come on, come on.

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:09.130 position:35% line:89% align:start
Get up man.

00:07:10.998 --> 00:07:11.966 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Draken!

00:07:11.999 --> 00:07:15.069 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hey, Mitsuya, Takemitchy.

00:07:16.971 --> 00:07:17.939 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Emma] Draken!

00:07:17.972 --> 00:07:19.040 position:24% line:89% align:start
Are you all right?

00:07:19.073 --> 00:07:20.041 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:07:20.074 --> 00:07:21.042 position:27% line:89% align:start
Stay back, Emma!

00:07:21.075 --> 00:07:22.944 position:21% line:89% align:start
So Peh, you traitor!

00:07:22.977 --> 00:07:25.379 position:13% line:83% align:start
What the hell are you doing
teaming up with Moebius?

00:07:25.413 --> 00:07:27.114 position:16% line:89% align:start
Shut your mouth, Mitsuya.

00:07:27.148 --> 00:07:28.950 position:7% line:89% align:start
Or I'll have 'em kill you too!

00:07:28.983 --> 00:07:29.984 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ohh?

00:07:31.552 --> 00:07:33.921 position:21% line:83% align:start
That's the captain of
their Second Division.

00:07:33.955 --> 00:07:35.289 position:27% line:89% align:start
He's a tough one.

00:07:35.323 --> 00:07:37.525 position:10% line:89% align:start
Peh, you backstabbing coward!

00:07:37.558 --> 00:07:39.827 position:19% line:83% align:start
You set up this whole
sneak attack on Draken!

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.064 position:10% line:83% align:start
But you needed all these guys
to help you fight one person?

00:07:43.097 --> 00:07:45.032 position:10% line:89% align:start
And you call yourself a man?

00:07:45.066 --> 00:07:46.466 position:38% line:89% align:start
Ugghhhh.

00:07:46.499 --> 00:07:48.235 position:24% line:89% align:start
Man I am so tired.

00:07:48.269 --> 00:07:49.837 position:10% line:89% align:start
Yeah you don't look so good.

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:50.671 position:33% line:89% align:start
Are you okay?

00:07:52.506 --> 00:07:54.375 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I'll be alright.

00:07:54.408 --> 00:07:56.877 position:21% line:89% align:start
But I'm at my limit.

00:07:56.911 --> 00:08:00.314 position:24% line:83% align:start
Can you finish this
for me, Mitsuya?

00:08:00.348 --> 00:08:01.315 position:33% line:89% align:start
My pleasure.

00:08:01.349 --> 00:08:02.550 position:41% line:89% align:start
Aaaghh.

00:08:04.051 --> 00:08:05.152 position:30% line:89% align:start
My head hurts.

00:08:05.186 --> 00:08:06.387 position:10% line:89% align:start
You little shits really think

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.589 position:24% line:83% align:start
you've got a chance
against all of us?

00:08:08.622 --> 00:08:10.490 position:10% line:89% align:start
You're all about to find out!

00:08:12.793 --> 00:08:14.929 position:13% line:89% align:start
I don't see Kiyomasa here.

00:08:14.962 --> 00:08:16.097 position:44% line:89% align:start
Shit!

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:18.498 position:10% line:83% align:start
There's no way to know where
he's gonna attack from!

00:08:18.532 --> 00:08:20.434 position:24% line:83% align:start
How can we protect
Draken and Emma

00:08:20.468 --> 00:08:22.203 position:24% line:83% align:start
with all these guys
surrounding us?

00:08:22.236 --> 00:08:23.270 position:21% line:89% align:start
What are we gonna do?

00:08:24.505 --> 00:08:26.273 position:19% line:89% align:start
Kill all three of them!

00:08:26.307 --> 00:08:27.808 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Gang Members] Yeah!

00:08:28.876 --> 00:08:31.612 position:19% line:83% align:start
(gang members
speaking indistinctly)

00:08:31.645 --> 00:08:33.014 position:21% line:83% align:start
-(motorcycle revving)
-Huh?

00:08:33.047 --> 00:08:34.048 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:08:36.217 --> 00:08:38.352 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:08:38.386 --> 00:08:40.554 position:38% line:89% align:start
(chuckle)

00:08:53.367 --> 00:08:57.038 position:19% line:89% align:start
(light nervous murmur)

00:08:57.071 --> 00:08:58.472 position:16% line:89% align:start
I think company's comin'.

00:08:58.507 --> 00:09:00.708 position:13% line:89% align:start
I know that exhaust sound!

00:09:00.741 --> 00:09:02.576 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's Mikey alright.

00:09:06.747 --> 00:09:07.681 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:09:12.686 --> 00:09:15.289 position:19% line:83% align:start
(gang members
speaking indistinctly)

00:09:15.322 --> 00:09:17.158 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Gang Member] It's Mikey.

00:09:17.191 --> 00:09:18.159 position:35% line:89% align:start
[Peh] Shit!

00:09:18.192 --> 00:09:19.160 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mikey?

00:09:19.193 --> 00:09:20.194 position:33% line:89% align:start
Just in time!

00:09:25.833 --> 00:09:26.801 position:38% line:89% align:start
Alright!

00:09:26.834 --> 00:09:28.769 position:21% line:83% align:start
With Mikey here, Peh
will have to stop!

00:09:32.706 --> 00:09:33.841 position:33% line:89% align:start
I get it now.

00:09:35.142 --> 00:09:37.512 position:21% line:83% align:start
You had me called
away for one reason.

00:09:37.546 --> 00:09:39.380 position:13% line:89% align:start
So you could ambush Kenny.

00:09:39.413 --> 00:09:40.381 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:09:40.414 --> 00:09:42.183 position:13% line:89% align:start
Someone planned that, too?

00:09:42.216 --> 00:09:44.919 position:13% line:83% align:start
And then you were planning
to pin the blame on me

00:09:44.952 --> 00:09:47.221 position:24% line:83% align:start
in order to try and
split Toman in half.

00:09:47.254 --> 00:09:48.689 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm just doing this for Pah!

00:09:48.722 --> 00:09:51.192 position:24% line:83% align:start
You know this isn't
how we do shit!

00:09:51.225 --> 00:09:54.295 position:16% line:83% align:start
Tell me, who tricked you
into doing this, Peh?

00:09:58.533 --> 00:09:59.700 position:19% line:89% align:start
He must mean he thinks

00:09:59.733 --> 00:10:01.769 position:19% line:83% align:start
there's some mastermind
controlling Peh!

00:10:03.572 --> 00:10:06.941 position:21% line:83% align:start
It was all just a
part of his big plan!

00:10:08.275 --> 00:10:09.544 position:10% line:89% align:start
Whoever he was talking about

00:10:09.578 --> 00:10:11.912 position:24% line:83% align:start
wanted to set Toman
against itself.

00:10:11.946 --> 00:10:14.248 position:10% line:89% align:start
And so Osanai just got used.

00:10:14.281 --> 00:10:17.318 position:19% line:83% align:start
Wait, so is Kiyomasa
just getting used too?

00:10:18.152 --> 00:10:20.988 position:24% line:89% align:start
Wow, I'm impressed.

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:24.758 position:21% line:83% align:start
I guess you're not
just brawn after all.

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:31.966 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Mikey] Who the hell are you?

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:34.168 position:27% line:89% align:start
Who is this guy?

00:10:40.241 --> 00:10:41.242 position:41% line:89% align:start
Tired.

00:10:44.845 --> 00:10:47.014 position:21% line:83% align:start
But it really doesn't
matter much who I am.

00:10:48.517 --> 00:10:51.520 position:13% line:83% align:start
All that matters is for now
I'm in charge of Moebius.

00:10:51.553 --> 00:10:52.753 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm Hanma.

00:10:55.422 --> 00:10:56.657 position:21% line:89% align:start
So you're the creeper

00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:58.225 position:24% line:83% align:start
who's been pulling
the strings lately.

00:11:01.195 --> 00:11:03.797 position:16% line:83% align:start
You really are a
serious smartass, Mikey.

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:08.836 position:30% line:89% align:start
(stunned gasp)

00:11:10.704 --> 00:11:12.806 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh damn, you see that?

00:11:15.042 --> 00:11:17.044 position:7% line:89% align:start
No one ever stops Mikey's kick!

00:11:18.212 --> 00:11:20.848 position:21% line:83% align:start
No need to be in such
a damn hurry, Mikey.

00:11:21.715 --> 00:11:23.817 position:24% line:83% align:start
Crushing Toman is
our long-term goal.

00:11:24.718 --> 00:11:26.220 position:19% line:89% align:start
But it's so much work.

00:11:26.253 --> 00:11:28.657 position:13% line:83% align:start
We thought we'd try to get
you to fight yourselves.

00:11:28.689 --> 00:11:31.526 position:21% line:83% align:start
I mean, it works out
the same in the end.

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.894 position:27% line:83% align:start
This way just has
an added benefit:

00:11:33.928 --> 00:11:37.431 position:10% line:83% align:start
I get to kill the invincible
Mikey with my own two hands!

00:11:39.066 --> 00:11:42.036 position:16% line:83% align:start
So this is the guy
who's behind everything?

00:11:42.069 --> 00:11:44.705 position:7% line:89% align:start
Moebius has a hundred men here!

00:11:44.738 --> 00:11:47.642 position:24% line:83% align:start
While pitiful Toman
has a measly four!

00:11:47.676 --> 00:11:50.377 position:19% line:83% align:start
And don't you dare wuss
out this time, assholes!

00:11:50.411 --> 00:11:51.879 position:5% line:89% align:start
'Cause if you do you'll find out

00:11:51.912 --> 00:11:54.315 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm not a softie like Osanai!

00:11:54.348 --> 00:11:55.584 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Gang Members] Yes sir!

00:11:55.617 --> 00:11:57.552 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Hanma] And if any
of you dare run away,

00:11:57.586 --> 00:12:00.487 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'll hunt you down and smash
your teeth down your throat!

00:12:01.422 --> 00:12:02.890 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Gang Members] Yes sir!

00:12:02.923 --> 00:12:07.261 position:21% line:83% align:start
Mikey and Draken,
my little friends...

00:12:07.294 --> 00:12:08.862 position:19% line:89% align:start
You're as good as dead!

00:12:11.566 --> 00:12:13.834 position:7% line:89% align:start
What the hell's going on here?

00:12:13.867 --> 00:12:16.003 position:21% line:83% align:start
Naoto didn't
mention any of this!

00:12:16.036 --> 00:12:17.905 position:16% line:83% align:start
The internal conflict
should've been resolved!

00:12:17.938 --> 00:12:20.908 position:21% line:83% align:start
But now a different
conflict's happening!

00:12:22.876 --> 00:12:26.013 position:19% line:89% align:start
Wait, is this my fault?

00:12:26.046 --> 00:12:29.718 position:13% line:83% align:start
Is history heading in
some new, weird direction?

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:32.687 position:21% line:83% align:start
Now stopping Kiyomasa
won't be enough!

00:12:32.721 --> 00:12:34.755 position:16% line:89% align:start
What am I supposed to do?

00:12:38.025 --> 00:12:38.826 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:12:39.126 --> 00:12:40.127 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh.

00:12:41.395 --> 00:12:42.463 position:30% line:89% align:start
(relieved sigh)

00:12:42.496 --> 00:12:43.632 position:24% line:89% align:start
They just made it.

00:12:43.665 --> 00:12:45.366 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:12:45.399 --> 00:12:48.168 position:21% line:89% align:start
(motorbikes revving)

00:13:20.801 --> 00:13:21.770 position:35% line:89% align:start
Well well!

00:13:21.802 --> 00:13:22.771 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:13:22.803 --> 00:13:24.872 position:13% line:89% align:start
Would ya look at this mess.

00:13:28.543 --> 00:13:29.644 position:13% line:89% align:start
Fighting amongst ourselves

00:13:29.678 --> 00:13:31.879 position:21% line:83% align:start
has never really
been my kinda thing.

00:13:33.013 --> 00:13:34.783 position:5% line:89% align:start
But since we're fighting Moebius

00:13:34.815 --> 00:13:37.251 position:19% line:83% align:start
we can go all out 'n
give 'em both barrels!

00:13:38.252 --> 00:13:39.887 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's about time.

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:42.056 position:16% line:83% align:start
I've been waiting for
the big showdown forever.

00:13:43.023 --> 00:13:44.058 position:24% line:89% align:start
Of course you came.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:47.595 position:13% line:89% align:start
Alright all you jackasses!

00:13:47.629 --> 00:13:50.598 position:27% line:83% align:start
The Tokyo Manji
Gang is here now!

00:13:50.632 --> 00:13:52.333 position:13% line:89% align:start
So who wants to die first?

00:13:52.366 --> 00:13:53.535 position:44% line:89% align:start
Peh!

00:13:53.568 --> 00:13:55.704 position:10% line:89% align:start
You're the one I wanna kill!

00:13:55.737 --> 00:13:57.905 position:33% line:89% align:start
(fright gasp)

00:13:57.938 --> 00:14:00.441 position:16% line:83% align:start
Looks like the party's
about to get started now!

00:14:09.249 --> 00:14:10.518 position:44% line:89% align:start
Shit!

00:14:10.552 --> 00:14:13.187 position:19% line:83% align:start
I have no idea how many
people are here now!

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:14.689 position:5% line:89% align:start
So we're gettin' a big-ass brawl

00:14:14.723 --> 00:14:16.190 position:13% line:89% align:start
on the day of the festival.

00:14:16.223 --> 00:14:18.359 position:24% line:83% align:start
I can feel my blood
pumping already!

00:14:19.728 --> 00:14:22.162 position:27% line:83% align:start
You ready to rock
and roll Mikey?

00:14:22.196 --> 00:14:24.498 position:38% line:89% align:start
(chuckle)

00:14:24.532 --> 00:14:26.033 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh, you know it, Kenny.

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:30.337 position:41% line:89% align:start
Draken!

00:14:30.371 --> 00:14:31.205 position:27% line:89% align:start
Please don't die!

00:14:35.275 --> 00:14:36.644 position:38% line:89% align:start
Let's go!

00:14:36.678 --> 00:14:39.614 position:19% line:89% align:start
(attack roar, yelling)

00:14:39.647 --> 00:14:40.948 position:33% line:89% align:start
Kill 'em all!

00:14:42.483 --> 00:14:45.419 position:30% line:89% align:start
(gleeful laugh)

00:14:45.452 --> 00:14:48.255 position:27% line:89% align:start
(confident laugh)

00:14:52.493 --> 00:14:55.162 position:30% line:89% align:start
(fight yelling)

00:14:57.998 --> 00:14:59.433 position:19% line:89% align:start
(fight yelling, grunts)

00:14:59.466 --> 00:15:01.669 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Gang Member] Like that?

00:15:09.443 --> 00:15:10.512 position:44% line:89% align:start
Shit!

00:15:10.545 --> 00:15:12.045 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's started for real now!

00:15:12.079 --> 00:15:14.749 position:19% line:83% align:start
But somehow, I still
have to protect Draken!

00:15:14.783 --> 00:15:19.987 position:19% line:89% align:start
Where are you, Draken?

00:15:23.591 --> 00:15:25.392 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Gang Member] Come on!

00:15:27.562 --> 00:15:28.863 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Gang Member] You bastard!

00:15:28.897 --> 00:15:29.864 position:38% line:89% align:start
(giggle)

00:15:29.898 --> 00:15:31.265 position:44% line:89% align:start
Die!

00:15:31.298 --> 00:15:32.099 position:44% line:89% align:start
Die!

00:15:35.135 --> 00:15:37.639 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Yasuhiro] Up we go!

00:15:37.672 --> 00:15:38.673 position:41% line:89% align:start
Aaghh!

00:15:40.875 --> 00:15:42.943 position:24% line:83% align:start
Who else wants to
take a little trip?

00:15:42.976 --> 00:15:46.046 position:21% line:89% align:start
(crazed charge yell)

00:15:52.854 --> 00:15:55.355 position:33% line:89% align:start
(horror gasp)

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.327 position:41% line:89% align:start
Draken?

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.161 position:41% line:89% align:start
Draken!

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:05.667 position:19% line:83% align:start
The hell are you doing
just wandering around?

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:08.135 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yeah, sorry about that!

00:16:12.841 --> 00:16:14.509 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ugh!

00:16:14.542 --> 00:16:15.677 position:30% line:89% align:start
You like that?

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:26.987 position:38% line:89% align:start
Damn it!

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:29.624 position:19% line:83% align:start
Everything I've done,
it was all for nothing!

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:33.795 position:13% line:89% align:start
By the end of this battle,

00:16:33.828 --> 00:16:37.064 position:10% line:83% align:start
Draken is still probably
gonna be killed by Kiyomasa!

00:16:38.098 --> 00:16:39.567 position:21% line:89% align:start
But I've got to try,

00:16:39.601 --> 00:16:42.202 position:10% line:83% align:start
I've gotta protect Draken
in this version of the past!

00:16:44.071 --> 00:16:46.875 position:21% line:83% align:start
I can't ever stand to
see Akkun die again!

00:16:46.908 --> 00:16:48.375 position:38% line:89% align:start
I can't!

00:16:48.408 --> 00:16:49.209 position:27% line:89% align:start
Or Hina, either!

00:16:53.548 --> 00:16:56.216 position:30% line:89% align:start
(fight yelling)

00:17:00.254 --> 00:17:03.791 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm going to stop Kiyomasa!

00:17:03.825 --> 00:17:06.126 position:24% line:83% align:start
And I'm going to
change the future!

00:17:12.232 --> 00:17:15.068 position:5% line:89% align:start
Not so tough now are ya asshole?

00:17:28.516 --> 00:17:29.684 position:33% line:89% align:start
Die already!

00:17:41.461 --> 00:17:42.396 position:41% line:89% align:start
(laugh)

00:17:42.429 --> 00:17:43.430 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:17:49.369 --> 00:17:50.170 position:38% line:89% align:start
Asshole!

00:17:56.476 --> 00:17:58.613 position:21% line:83% align:start
What're you doing
just standing there?

00:17:58.646 --> 00:18:00.347 position:16% line:89% align:start
You wussing out already?

00:18:03.317 --> 00:18:05.118 position:44% line:89% align:start
Peh!

00:18:07.722 --> 00:18:08.690 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Gang Member] What the hell?

00:18:08.723 --> 00:18:09.724 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mikey?

00:18:11.659 --> 00:18:12.594 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hey, it's Toman's leader!

00:18:12.627 --> 00:18:13.595 position:38% line:89% align:start
Perfect!

00:18:13.628 --> 00:18:14.596 position:24% line:89% align:start
Let's take him out!

00:18:14.629 --> 00:18:15.797 position:35% line:89% align:start
Good idea!

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:17.599 position:13% line:89% align:start
"Invincible Mikey" my ass!

00:18:21.936 --> 00:18:22.904 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Mikey] Peh!

00:18:22.937 --> 00:18:24.404 position:19% line:89% align:start
Why'd you attack Kenny?

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:26.808 position:21% line:89% align:start
Shut up, you bastard!

00:18:29.343 --> 00:18:31.946 position:10% line:83% align:start
You knew that Kenny and I had
worked everything out again!

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:35.115 position:30% line:89% align:start
(charge growl)

00:18:35.148 --> 00:18:37.085 position:13% line:89% align:start
And you brought Moebius in?

00:18:37.117 --> 00:18:39.319 position:24% line:83% align:start
Since when are you
such a damn coward?

00:18:41.321 --> 00:18:44.092 position:19% line:83% align:start
I don't give a rat's
ass if you two made up!

00:18:44.124 --> 00:18:46.828 position:19% line:83% align:start
That shit's got
nothing to do with Pah!

00:18:46.861 --> 00:18:48.730 position:10% line:89% align:start
We're done talking about Pah!

00:18:48.763 --> 00:18:50.732 position:27% line:89% align:start
The hell we are!

00:18:50.765 --> 00:18:53.601 position:27% line:89% align:start
(heaving breaths)

00:18:59.507 --> 00:19:02.309 position:10% line:83% align:start
How do you figure we're done
with it, when Pah got caught,

00:19:02.342 --> 00:19:04.646 position:21% line:83% align:start
and we didn't do a
damn thing about it?

00:19:04.679 --> 00:19:05.747 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:07.280 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's bullshit!

00:19:07.314 --> 00:19:09.584 position:10% line:89% align:start
How am I supposed to be done?

00:19:09.617 --> 00:19:10.752 position:27% line:89% align:start
Don't you get it?

00:19:10.785 --> 00:19:12.553 position:16% line:89% align:start
Pah was everything to me!

00:19:15.222 --> 00:19:16.691 position:10% line:89% align:start
If Toman's gonna abandon Pah,

00:19:16.724 --> 00:19:19.727 position:13% line:83% align:start
then what choice do I
have but to be your enemy?

00:19:21.129 --> 00:19:22.329 position:24% line:89% align:start
Come at me, Mikey!

00:19:24.098 --> 00:19:26.634 position:24% line:83% align:start
Why the hell won't
you fight back?

00:19:26.668 --> 00:19:28.335 position:16% line:89% align:start
You'd only need one hit!

00:19:33.975 --> 00:19:35.275 position:30% line:89% align:start
Look at me Peh.

00:19:40.014 --> 00:19:41.181 position:33% line:89% align:start
Am I smiling?

00:19:43.216 --> 00:19:46.219 position:16% line:83% align:start
And after Pah got
caught, did I ever smile?

00:19:47.822 --> 00:19:49.189 position:30% line:89% align:start
It hurts, man.

00:19:51.559 --> 00:19:55.395 position:13% line:83% align:start
I remember when Takemitchy
said how sad it would be,

00:19:55.429 --> 00:19:58.733 position:7% line:83% align:start
if Toman broke apart just
because Ken and I had a fight.

00:20:00.101 --> 00:20:03.203 position:16% line:83% align:start
But I never thought
that something like that

00:20:03.236 --> 00:20:05.238 position:19% line:83% align:start
would ever end up with
all of us fighting.

00:20:08.208 --> 00:20:10.511 position:19% line:83% align:start
So, hit me until
you're satisfied, Peh.

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:13.681 position:35% line:89% align:start
Mikey I...

00:20:15.282 --> 00:20:18.886 position:21% line:83% align:start
I don't want to fight
with my own family.

00:20:21.956 --> 00:20:24.357 position:7% line:89% align:start
So, let's start all over again.

00:20:24.391 --> 00:20:26.861 position:21% line:89% align:start
Come back to us, Peh!

00:20:31.833 --> 00:20:34.602 position:38% line:89% align:start
(crying)

00:20:36.871 --> 00:20:39.674 position:27% line:89% align:start
(grunts, groans)

00:20:43.811 --> 00:20:44.812 position:41% line:89% align:start
Draken!

00:20:45.813 --> 00:20:47.280 position:21% line:89% align:start
Draken where are you?

00:20:48.116 --> 00:20:49.851 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ungh!

00:20:49.884 --> 00:20:54.021 position:10% line:89% align:start
Aaagh, get off of me dammit!

00:21:01.996 --> 00:21:04.999 position:24% line:89% align:start
(frustrated scream)

00:21:06.801 --> 00:21:10.104 position:7% line:83% align:start
They have to be here, but I
can't find Draken or Kiyomasa!

00:21:10.138 --> 00:21:11.639 position:13% line:89% align:start
Where the hell did they go?

00:21:23.251 --> 00:21:25.887 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasp)

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.889 position:33% line:89% align:start
There he is!

00:21:27.922 --> 00:21:29.891 position:19% line:89% align:start
I found you, Kiyomasa!

00:21:32.359 --> 00:21:35.462 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna find Draken and
then I'm gonna kill him.

00:21:36.664 --> 00:21:38.699 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna stop you
no matter what!

00:21:40.701 --> 00:21:42.203 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:21:42.236 --> 00:21:45.807 position:27% line:89% align:start
(horrified gasp)

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:46.841 position:47% line:89% align:start
No!

00:21:48.176 --> 00:21:49.744 position:24% line:89% align:start
I did it this time!

00:21:49.777 --> 00:21:50.578 position:24% line:89% align:start
I actually did it!

00:22:01.189 --> 00:22:03.691 position:33% line:89% align:start
(horror gasp)

00:22:05.059 --> 00:22:06.359 position:35% line:89% align:start
Draken, no!

00:22:06.393 --> 00:22:07.862 position:35% line:89% align:start
Draken, no!

00:22:08.196 --> 00:22:09.396 position:41% line:89% align:start
Draken!

00:22:12.733 --> 00:22:15.536 position:41% line:89% align:start
Draken!

00:22:17.905 --> 00:22:21.341 position:21% line:89% align:start
(closing theme music)
