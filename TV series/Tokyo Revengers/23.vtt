00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:10.645 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Chifuyu sobbing)

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:13.480 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh Baji!

00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:15.249 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Chifuyu sobbing)

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:16.684 position:13% line:89% align:start
How the hell am I supposed

00:00:16.718 --> 00:00:18.185 position:16% line:89% align:start
to go on now without you?

00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:21.823 position:21% line:89% align:start
(footsteps thudding)

00:00:21.856 --> 00:00:22.824 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:00:22.857 --> 00:00:25.660 position:30% line:89% align:start
(wind rustling)

00:00:25.693 --> 00:00:29.096 position:16% line:89% align:start
(soft instrumental music)

00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:37.739 position:27% line:89% align:start
(birds chirping)

00:00:37.772 --> 00:00:41.074 position:16% line:89% align:start
(soft instrumental music)

00:00:43.176 --> 00:00:45.580 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Kazutora] I was told
to expect to be in here

00:00:45.613 --> 00:00:46.648 position:24% line:89% align:start
at least 10 years.

00:00:48.315 --> 00:00:49.817 position:16% line:89% align:start
But is even that enough?

00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:52.887 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm not running away.

00:00:52.921 --> 00:00:55.455 position:5% line:89% align:start
I need to face up to what I did.

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.659 position:19% line:83% align:start
And at least I learned
that much from him.

00:00:58.492 --> 00:00:59.493 position:41% line:89% align:start
And...

00:01:00.762 --> 00:01:02.462 position:33% line:89% align:start
So this time,

00:01:02.496 --> 00:01:04.599 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm going to actually
do the right thing.

00:01:06.701 --> 00:01:09.069 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Draken] Don't kill
yourself, Kazutora.

00:01:09.704 --> 00:01:10.672 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:01:10.705 --> 00:01:13.007 position:16% line:89% align:start
(soft instrumental music)

00:01:13.041 --> 00:01:14.241 position:33% line:89% align:start
How did you?

00:01:14.776 --> 00:01:16.544 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Draken sighs)

00:01:16.578 --> 00:01:17.679 position:21% line:89% align:start
I know what you meant

00:01:17.712 --> 00:01:19.581 position:13% line:83% align:start
because I know what
you're thinking right now.

00:01:19.614 --> 00:01:20.782 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Kazutora gasps)

00:01:20.815 --> 00:01:21.983 position:13% line:89% align:start
And I'll never forgive you

00:01:22.016 --> 00:01:24.217 position:16% line:83% align:start
if you take your own life
to try to make amends.

00:01:24.251 --> 00:01:25.185 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Kazutora sniffling)

00:01:25.218 --> 00:01:26.186 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Hm.

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:28.022 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Kazutora sniffling)

00:01:28.056 --> 00:01:29.356 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Kazutora] But I just...

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:31.759 position:5% line:89% align:start
I don't know what else there is.

00:01:31.793 --> 00:01:33.795 position:24% line:89% align:start
What else can I do?

00:01:33.828 --> 00:01:36.898 position:16% line:89% align:start
(soft instrumental music)

00:01:36.931 --> 00:01:39.099 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Draken] I have a
message from Mikey.

00:01:39.132 --> 00:01:41.268 position:10% line:89% align:start
He told me to tell you this,

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:43.671 position:7% line:89% align:start
"You're still a part of Toman."

00:01:43.705 --> 00:01:46.975 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Kazutora gasping)

00:01:47.008 --> 00:01:48.375 position:21% line:89% align:start
"And I forgive you."

00:01:49.744 --> 00:01:50.945 position:24% line:89% align:start
(soft piano music)

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.881 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Kazutora sobbing)

00:02:02.557 --> 00:02:06.661 position:24% line:83% align:start
(inspirational
instrumental music)

00:02:06.694 --> 00:02:09.631 position:27% line:89% align:start
(winds rustling)

00:02:09.664 --> 00:02:12.332 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Mikey] This is what you
wanted me to do, isn't it?

00:02:12.934 --> 00:02:14.068 position:35% line:89% align:start
Huh, Baji?

00:02:14.102 --> 00:02:16.236 position:16% line:89% align:start
(soft instrumental music)

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:17.972 position:24% line:5% align:start
(Draken shivering)

00:02:18.006 --> 00:02:19.674 position:24% line:5% align:start
[Draken] Man, it's
cold out here.

00:02:19.707 --> 00:02:21.141 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yep. Winter's here.

00:02:21.174 --> 00:02:23.111 position:21% line:89% align:start
(footsteps thudding)

00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:26.246 position:16% line:89% align:start
(soft instrumental music)

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:30.652 position:24% line:83% align:start
Please take care of
yourself, Kazutora.

00:02:30.685 --> 00:02:32.285 position:21% line:89% align:start
(footsteps thudding)

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.823 position:16% line:89% align:start
(soft instrumental music)

00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:39.493 position:21% line:89% align:start
(footsteps thudding)

00:02:39.527 --> 00:02:40.293 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, yeah.

00:02:40.327 --> 00:02:41.996 position:24% line:83% align:start
And I've got a
message from Mikey

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.998 position:19% line:89% align:start
for you too, Takemichi.

00:02:44.032 --> 00:02:45.232 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:46.901 position:13% line:89% align:start
What did Mikey have to say?

00:02:46.934 --> 00:02:49.236 position:7% line:89% align:start
Well, he wanted me to tell you

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.739 position:21% line:83% align:start
to be sure to show up
at our next meeting.

00:02:51.773 --> 00:02:54.776 position:19% line:83% align:start
He's got something
important to tell you.

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:55.743 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasps)

00:02:55.777 --> 00:02:57.177 position:21% line:89% align:start
(footsteps thudding)

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.048 position:30% line:89% align:start
(train revving)

00:03:00.081 --> 00:03:03.250 position:27% line:89% align:start
(train chuffing)

00:03:03.283 --> 00:03:04.619 position:21% line:89% align:start
Something important?

00:03:06.253 --> 00:03:08.156 position:21% line:89% align:start
I wonder what it is?

00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:10.223 position:24% line:83% align:start
It sounds a little
scary to be honest.

00:03:11.693 --> 00:03:14.796 position:27% line:89% align:start
(train chuffing)

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:19.834 position:21% line:83% align:start
(opening theme music)

00:04:44.852 --> 00:04:46.721 position:21% line:89% align:start
(footsteps thudding)

00:04:46.754 --> 00:04:47.955 position:30% line:89% align:start
(horn honking)

00:04:47.989 --> 00:04:49.791 position:24% line:89% align:start
(crowd chattering)

00:04:49.824 --> 00:04:51.125 position:35% line:89% align:start
In the end,

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:52.627 position:19% line:83% align:start
I couldn't do
anything useful at all

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.796 position:7% line:89% align:start
in the Bloody Halloween battle,

00:04:54.829 --> 00:04:57.698 position:19% line:83% align:start
Baji died and
Kazutora was arrested.

00:04:58.699 --> 00:04:59.700 position:41% line:89% align:start
But...

00:05:01.401 --> 00:05:04.005 position:5% line:89% align:start
Kazutora wasn't killed by Mikey,

00:05:04.038 --> 00:05:06.174 position:13% line:89% align:start
which means that just maybe

00:05:06.207 --> 00:05:08.009 position:24% line:83% align:start
we were able to
prevent the future

00:05:08.042 --> 00:05:10.343 position:7% line:89% align:start
where Kisaki takes over Toman.

00:05:10.377 --> 00:05:12.847 position:16% line:83% align:start
I guess that'll be clear
at our next meeting.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:13.815 position:24% line:89% align:start
(crowd chattering)

00:05:13.848 --> 00:05:15.917 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hm? Shibuya?

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:17.618 position:24% line:89% align:start
Where are we going?

00:05:17.652 --> 00:05:18.653 position:38% line:89% align:start
My place.

00:05:18.686 --> 00:05:20.988 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's around the corner
so we're stopping by.

00:05:21.022 --> 00:05:22.824 position:10% line:89% align:start
Around the corner from what?

00:05:22.857 --> 00:05:24.324 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gawking)

00:05:24.357 --> 00:05:25.492 position:41% line:89% align:start
I mean,

00:05:25.526 --> 00:05:27.427 position:19% line:83% align:start
we're right in the
middle of Shibuya here!

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.164 position:13% line:89% align:start
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:05:30.198 --> 00:05:31.364 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:05:31.398 --> 00:05:33.333 position:24% line:83% align:start
Are you telling me
this is your place?

00:05:33.366 --> 00:05:34.334 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Draken] Jeez.

00:05:34.367 --> 00:05:36.003 position:21% line:89% align:start
Do you ever shut up?

00:05:36.037 --> 00:05:37.071 position:27% line:89% align:start
Man, you scored!

00:05:37.104 --> 00:05:38.072 position:27% line:89% align:start
Are you jealous?

00:05:38.105 --> 00:05:40.373 position:10% line:89% align:start
Wow! You're a total city boy!

00:05:40.407 --> 00:05:43.110 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Draken] Honestly, it's
not what you think.

00:05:43.144 --> 00:05:46.614 position:13% line:89% align:start
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:05:51.252 --> 00:05:52.452 position:33% line:89% align:start
(bell dings)

00:05:54.454 --> 00:05:58.425 position:19% line:89% align:start
(musical notes chimes)

00:05:58.458 --> 00:06:00.761 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasping)

00:06:00.795 --> 00:06:02.429 position:27% line:89% align:start
Come on in guys.

00:06:02.462 --> 00:06:05.199 position:16% line:83% align:start
Sorry. I think we came in
the wrong door somehow.

00:06:05.233 --> 00:06:06.567 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Draken] I'm home.

00:06:06.601 --> 00:06:07.301 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:06:07.335 --> 00:06:08.302 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, sorry.

00:06:08.336 --> 00:06:09.503 position:19% line:89% align:start
I didn't notice it you.

00:06:09.537 --> 00:06:11.706 position:19% line:83% align:start
What are you doing home
so early Kenny boy?

00:06:11.739 --> 00:06:14.175 position:19% line:83% align:start
what kind of delinquent
acts like that?

00:06:14.208 --> 00:06:15.375 position:19% line:89% align:start
As long as you're here,

00:06:15.408 --> 00:06:17.345 position:24% line:83% align:start
take out that load
of dirty towels.

00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:19.146 position:16% line:83% align:start
Oh, yeah. And you need
to change the light bulb

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.147 position:24% line:89% align:start
in the break room.

00:06:20.181 --> 00:06:21.349 position:13% line:89% align:start
Wouldn't kill either of you

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:23.517 position:7% line:89% align:start
to say please once in a while.

00:06:23.551 --> 00:06:24.919 position:27% line:89% align:start
Sorry about this.

00:06:24.952 --> 00:06:26.988 position:10% line:83% align:start
Just wait for me in the lobby
for a little while okay?

00:06:27.021 --> 00:06:28.222 position:21% line:89% align:start
(footsteps thudding)

00:06:28.256 --> 00:06:31.458 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gawking)

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.096 position:27% line:89% align:start
(nails clipping)

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:40.134 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ugh.

00:06:40.167 --> 00:06:42.136 position:13% line:89% align:start
Draken lives in a brothel.

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:43.804 position:27% line:83% align:start
How the hell did
that ever happen?

00:06:43.838 --> 00:06:46.007 position:7% line:89% align:start
And how was that even possible?

00:06:47.474 --> 00:06:51.145 position:16% line:83% align:start
And why does this guy
keep clipping his nails?

00:06:51.178 --> 00:06:52.680 position:30% line:89% align:start
(nail blowing)

00:06:52.713 --> 00:06:53.748 position:35% line:89% align:start
All right.

00:06:53.781 --> 00:06:55.616 position:27% line:83% align:start
Now just a little
bathroom break.

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:57.450 position:21% line:89% align:start
(footsteps thudding)

00:06:57.484 --> 00:06:59.320 position:7% line:83% align:start
-Thank you for waiting for me.
-(Takemichi gasping)

00:06:59.353 --> 00:07:00.621 position:24% line:89% align:start
(curtain rattling)

00:07:00.655 --> 00:07:03.257 position:27% line:83% align:start
Thank you so much
for requesting me.

00:07:03.291 --> 00:07:04.592 position:38% line:89% align:start
I'm Remi.

00:07:04.625 --> 00:07:07.795 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasping)

00:07:07.828 --> 00:07:09.030 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Remi laughs)

00:07:09.063 --> 00:07:10.932 position:19% line:89% align:start
Just come with me okay?

00:07:10.965 --> 00:07:11.933 position:44% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:07:11.966 --> 00:07:15.069 position:21% line:89% align:start
(footsteps thudding)

00:07:15.102 --> 00:07:16.103 position:33% line:89% align:start
You're young.

00:07:16.137 --> 00:07:18.606 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi blushing)

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:20.908 position:27% line:83% align:start
Let's get you in
the shower first.

00:07:20.942 --> 00:07:23.577 position:27% line:89% align:start
(water splashing)

00:07:24.645 --> 00:07:27.615 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm so glad you
chose me, Takemichi.

00:07:27.648 --> 00:07:29.116 position:19% line:89% align:start
You're totally my type.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:31.919 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasping)

00:07:31.953 --> 00:07:33.154 position:44% line:89% align:start
Wait.

00:07:33.187 --> 00:07:34.422 position:13% line:89% align:start
Is Draken trying to give me

00:07:34.454 --> 00:07:36.223 position:16% line:89% align:start
a surprise present here?

00:07:36.257 --> 00:07:37.992 position:10% line:89% align:start
So I can finally say goodbye

00:07:38.025 --> 00:07:39.360 position:27% line:89% align:start
to my virginity?

00:07:39.393 --> 00:07:41.028 position:10% line:89% align:start
Are you telling me it's time

00:07:41.062 --> 00:07:42.495 position:16% line:89% align:start
to become a man, Draken?

00:07:44.065 --> 00:07:45.032 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Remi] Takemichi?

00:07:45.066 --> 00:07:46.466 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasping)

00:07:46.499 --> 00:07:47.902 position:33% line:89% align:start
Is it okay if

00:07:48.402 --> 00:07:49.837 position:35% line:89% align:start
I come in?

00:07:51.372 --> 00:07:52.340 position:44% line:89% align:start
Agh!

00:07:52.373 --> 00:07:54.542 position:27% line:89% align:start
Is this okay, me?

00:07:54.575 --> 00:07:57.511 position:19% line:83% align:start
Are you really going
to do this, Takemichi?

00:07:59.847 --> 00:08:01.015 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:08:01.048 --> 00:08:02.550 position:24% line:89% align:start
Thank you, Draken.

00:08:03.951 --> 00:08:05.419 position:30% line:89% align:start
(door opening)

00:08:05.453 --> 00:08:07.421 position:19% line:83% align:start
Now what the hell do
you think you're doing?

00:08:07.455 --> 00:08:08.723 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasping)

00:08:08.756 --> 00:08:09.924 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh, you gotta be kidding.

00:08:09.957 --> 00:08:12.026 position:21% line:83% align:start
This guy is just
one of your friends?

00:08:12.059 --> 00:08:13.294 position:19% line:89% align:start
Remi, you can't assume

00:08:13.327 --> 00:08:15.162 position:24% line:83% align:start
every man you run
into is a customer.

00:08:15.196 --> 00:08:16.430 position:19% line:89% align:start
Well keep your friends

00:08:16.464 --> 00:08:18.498 position:24% line:83% align:start
out of the damn
lobby then dumbass.

00:08:18.532 --> 00:08:20.067 position:19% line:89% align:start
(Draken laughs) Idiot.

00:08:20.101 --> 00:08:22.470 position:21% line:83% align:start
I have no idea what's
going on anymore.

00:08:22.503 --> 00:08:24.405 position:7% line:89% align:start
I grew up without any parents.

00:08:24.438 --> 00:08:26.574 position:21% line:83% align:start
So I guess you
could say I ended up

00:08:26.607 --> 00:08:28.342 position:5% line:89% align:start
getting raised by everyone here.

00:08:28.376 --> 00:08:29.677 position:24% line:83% align:start
You just casually
dropped a bombshell

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:30.878 position:21% line:89% align:start
like it was nothing.

00:08:30.911 --> 00:08:31.679 position:38% line:89% align:start
Come on.

00:08:31.712 --> 00:08:32.713 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi grunts)

00:08:34.215 --> 00:08:37.685 position:13% line:89% align:start
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:08:39.186 --> 00:08:40.154 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Draken laughs)

00:08:40.187 --> 00:08:41.622 position:24% line:89% align:start
This is hilarious.

00:08:41.655 --> 00:08:42.790 position:16% line:89% align:start
'Cause other than Mikey,

00:08:42.823 --> 00:08:44.692 position:19% line:83% align:start
you're the first person
I've had in here.

00:08:44.725 --> 00:08:46.861 position:19% line:83% align:start
This has been your room
for your whole life?

00:08:46.894 --> 00:08:47.862 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:08:47.895 --> 00:08:50.031 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's not big, but it's
got everything I need.

00:08:50.064 --> 00:08:50.865 position:33% line:89% align:start
Have a seat.

00:08:51.632 --> 00:08:53.502 position:7% line:89% align:start
I think I'm starting to see why

00:08:53.534 --> 00:08:56.170 position:24% line:83% align:start
Draken always
seemed so grown up.

00:08:56.203 --> 00:08:57.905 position:44% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:08:57.938 --> 00:08:59.040 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:08:59.073 --> 00:09:01.409 position:44% line:89% align:start
Whoa!

00:09:01.442 --> 00:09:03.644 position:27% line:83% align:start
Look at all these
pictures you have.

00:09:03.677 --> 00:09:05.312 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's a great one of Mikey.

00:09:05.346 --> 00:09:06.914 position:21% line:89% align:start
And here's Emma too.

00:09:06.947 --> 00:09:08.816 position:21% line:83% align:start
I guess you actually
do care about her.

00:09:08.849 --> 00:09:09.817 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:10.851 position:38% line:89% align:start
Shut up.

00:09:11.986 --> 00:09:13.988 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasp)

00:09:14.021 --> 00:09:16.023 position:33% line:89% align:start
There's Baji.

00:09:16.057 --> 00:09:16.824 position:21% line:89% align:start
(footsteps thudding)

00:09:16.857 --> 00:09:18.292 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Draken] These
are all the people

00:09:18.325 --> 00:09:19.827 position:10% line:89% align:start
who are most important to me.

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.429 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:09:21.462 --> 00:09:24.498 position:16% line:83% align:start
I can never let
anything happen to them.

00:09:24.533 --> 00:09:27.802 position:19% line:83% align:start
And that's why I wanted
to kill Kazutora.

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:33.140 position:19% line:83% align:start
I know that would have
been wrong, but still.

00:09:34.241 --> 00:09:35.276 position:16% line:89% align:start
(soft instrumental music)

00:09:35.309 --> 00:09:37.278 position:5% line:89% align:start
So thank you for stopping Mikey.

00:09:38.979 --> 00:09:40.414 position:33% line:89% align:start
I wanted to,

00:09:40.448 --> 00:09:41.649 position:30% line:89% align:start
but I couldn't.

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:47.088 position:24% line:89% align:start
(crowd chattering)

00:09:47.121 --> 00:09:49.690 position:16% line:89% align:start
(soft instrumental music)

00:09:49.723 --> 00:09:51.425 position:21% line:89% align:start
(footsteps thudding)

00:09:51.459 --> 00:09:53.260 position:21% line:83% align:start
I think I understand
how Draken feels.

00:09:54.395 --> 00:09:56.097 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm trying to do my best too,

00:09:57.231 --> 00:09:59.600 position:16% line:83% align:start
for all the people who
are most important to me.

00:09:59.633 --> 00:10:02.703 position:16% line:89% align:start
(soft instrumental music)

00:10:02.736 --> 00:10:05.806 position:21% line:89% align:start
(footsteps thudding)

00:10:06.774 --> 00:10:08.309 position:21% line:89% align:start
But it's nice to know

00:10:08.342 --> 00:10:09.877 position:10% line:89% align:start
Draken really does like Emma,

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:12.446 position:21% line:83% align:start
despite the tough guy
routine he puts on.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.281 position:21% line:89% align:start
You've got this Emma!

00:10:14.315 --> 00:10:17.552 position:13% line:83% align:start
Keep after him and he
might come around someday.

00:10:17.586 --> 00:10:18.953 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh, what?

00:10:18.986 --> 00:10:19.753 position:44% line:89% align:start
Emma?

00:10:19.787 --> 00:10:21.722 position:16% line:89% align:start
Wow. Speak of the devil.

00:10:23.023 --> 00:10:23.991 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey!

00:10:24.024 --> 00:10:25.126 position:44% line:89% align:start
Emma!

00:10:25.159 --> 00:10:26.127 position:38% line:89% align:start
Wait up!

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.295 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasps)

00:10:28.329 --> 00:10:30.397 position:19% line:89% align:start
(soft percussion music)

00:10:30.431 --> 00:10:32.567 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Emma laughs)

00:10:32.601 --> 00:10:33.901 position:38% line:89% align:start
Love you.

00:10:33.934 --> 00:10:34.935 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mikey.

00:10:36.003 --> 00:10:37.371 position:30% line:89% align:start
(head patting)

00:10:37.404 --> 00:10:39.874 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gawking)

00:10:39.907 --> 00:10:42.511 position:10% line:89% align:start
You've gotta be shittin' me!

00:10:42.544 --> 00:10:44.345 position:13% line:89% align:start
You're kidding right, Emma?

00:10:44.378 --> 00:10:45.146 position:19% line:89% align:start
Cheating's bad enough.

00:10:45.179 --> 00:10:46.347 position:27% line:89% align:start
But of all people

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:47.848 position:16% line:89% align:start
it had to be with Mikey?

00:10:47.882 --> 00:10:49.683 position:24% line:83% align:start
That's hitting way
too close to home!

00:10:49.717 --> 00:10:50.885 position:30% line:89% align:start
Don't you know

00:10:50.918 --> 00:10:52.987 position:24% line:83% align:start
what would happen
if Draken saw this?

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:56.690 position:13% line:89% align:start
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:10:58.826 --> 00:11:00.227 position:27% line:83% align:start
You've got some
explaining to do.

00:11:00.261 --> 00:11:02.696 position:13% line:83% align:start
What the hell do you think
you're doing with Emma?

00:11:03.097 --> 00:11:04.265 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:11:04.298 --> 00:11:06.233 position:16% line:89% align:start
This girl belongs to me.

00:11:06.267 --> 00:11:07.201 position:33% line:89% align:start
That does it!

00:11:07.234 --> 00:11:08.969 position:21% line:83% align:start
From now on you're my
blood enemy jackass.

00:11:09.003 --> 00:11:09.970 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah?

00:11:10.004 --> 00:11:12.106 position:21% line:83% align:start
Then bring it on pal.
I'll murder you!

00:11:12.139 --> 00:11:13.307 position:27% line:89% align:start
(fire exploding)

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:14.975 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi trembling)

00:11:15.009 --> 00:11:17.178 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh, it's all over
for sure this time.

00:11:17.211 --> 00:11:19.614 position:24% line:83% align:start
Toman final battle
is about to begin.

00:11:19.648 --> 00:11:21.182 position:24% line:89% align:start
This is Armageddon.

00:11:21.215 --> 00:11:22.783 position:41% line:89% align:start
Indeed.

00:11:22.816 --> 00:11:26.887 position:16% line:83% align:start
I do smell an intriguing
mystery my dear Watson.

00:11:26.921 --> 00:11:27.988 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:11:28.022 --> 00:11:28.789 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hina?

00:11:28.822 --> 00:11:30.324 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hi, Takemichi.

00:11:30.357 --> 00:11:31.526 position:21% line:89% align:start
And you're here too?

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.327 position:10% line:89% align:start
Sorry for sneaking up on you.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.195 position:21% line:89% align:start
We were out shopping,

00:11:34.228 --> 00:11:35.664 position:21% line:83% align:start
and we just happened
to see you here.

00:11:35.696 --> 00:11:37.831 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh well, good to see you, Naoto.

00:11:38.766 --> 00:11:40.367 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Mikey] Quit hanging onto me.

00:11:40.401 --> 00:11:41.402 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Emma] Nope!

00:11:42.136 --> 00:11:44.238 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Emma laughs)

00:11:44.271 --> 00:11:45.406 position:27% line:89% align:start
This is strange.

00:11:45.439 --> 00:11:46.774 position:7% line:89% align:start
Emma lives and breathes Draken

00:11:46.807 --> 00:11:48.742 position:16% line:83% align:start
so what we're seeing
just can't be happening.

00:11:48.776 --> 00:11:50.878 position:19% line:83% align:start
There's something quite
suspicious going on.

00:11:50.911 --> 00:11:53.247 position:24% line:83% align:start
Don't you agree
with me, Takemichi?

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:54.281 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uh-huh.

00:11:55.282 --> 00:11:58.587 position:24% line:83% align:start
Well, I intend to
solve this mystery.

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:01.388 position:24% line:83% align:start
Solve it in the
name of my grandpa!

00:12:01.422 --> 00:12:02.756 position:47% line:89% align:start
Uh?

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:05.326 position:21% line:83% align:start
Oughta just go along
with it, Takemichi.

00:12:05.359 --> 00:12:06.595 position:24% line:89% align:start
She watched so many

00:12:06.628 --> 00:12:07.696 position:24% line:83% align:start
of these detective
series lately,

00:12:07.728 --> 00:12:08.729 position:27% line:89% align:start
she's kinda nuts.

00:12:08.762 --> 00:12:10.699 position:5% line:89% align:start
Come on, get over here you guys!

00:12:10.731 --> 00:12:12.499 position:24% line:83% align:start
We don't want to
lose sight of 'em.

00:12:12.534 --> 00:12:13.734 position:47% line:89% align:start
Uh.

00:12:15.269 --> 00:12:17.204 position:24% line:89% align:start
(crowd chattering)

00:12:17.238 --> 00:12:18.707 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Emma] Say, "Ahh".

00:12:18.739 --> 00:12:20.407 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Mikey gulps)

00:12:20.441 --> 00:12:21.610 position:41% line:89% align:start
Thanks.

00:12:21.643 --> 00:12:23.578 position:24% line:83% align:start
You see, I still
know what you like.

00:12:23.612 --> 00:12:25.580 position:13% line:89% align:start
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:12:25.614 --> 00:12:27.515 position:24% line:83% align:start
So where'd you get
that pipe, Hina?

00:12:27.549 --> 00:12:29.450 position:13% line:89% align:start
Pay attention dear Watson.

00:12:29.483 --> 00:12:31.185 position:21% line:89% align:start
Focus on Emma's eyes.

00:12:31.218 --> 00:12:32.419 position:38% line:89% align:start
Her eyes?

00:12:32.453 --> 00:12:33.420 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Hina] Those are definitely

00:12:33.454 --> 00:12:35.422 position:13% line:89% align:start
the eyes of a girl in love.

00:12:35.456 --> 00:12:36.257 position:24% line:89% align:start
The women can tell.

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:38.259 position:27% line:89% align:start
Is it that clear?

00:12:38.292 --> 00:12:39.460 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:12:39.493 --> 00:12:41.128 position:13% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I see what you mean.

00:12:42.496 --> 00:12:44.164 position:24% line:83% align:start
She does look like
she's in love.

00:12:44.198 --> 00:12:45.065 position:30% line:89% align:start
(face smacking)

00:12:45.099 --> 00:12:47.502 position:21% line:83% align:start
Creep. I told you to
look at her eyes.

00:12:47.535 --> 00:12:48.836 position:33% line:89% align:start
There it is.

00:12:48.869 --> 00:12:51.438 position:10% line:89% align:start
Hinata's Detective Punch-Out.

00:12:51.472 --> 00:12:52.439 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Hina laughing)

00:12:52.473 --> 00:12:53.608 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Kazushi] Hey, Takemichi!

00:12:53.642 --> 00:12:54.609 position:33% line:89% align:start
Is that you?

00:12:54.643 --> 00:12:56.010 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:12:56.043 --> 00:12:57.545 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Whoa, Yamagishi?

00:13:00.548 --> 00:13:02.684 position:24% line:89% align:start
(crowd chattering)

00:13:02.717 --> 00:13:03.984 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Kazushi] Yeah.

00:13:04.018 --> 00:13:06.153 position:10% line:83% align:start
From what you say, I
definitely smell a case here.

00:13:06.186 --> 00:13:07.054 position:38% line:89% align:start
No doubt.

00:13:07.087 --> 00:13:08.623 position:21% line:83% align:start
That's why we're
following them around

00:13:08.657 --> 00:13:10.124 position:7% line:89% align:start
to try and find out the truth.

00:13:10.157 --> 00:13:11.258 position:35% line:89% align:start
But so far

00:13:11.292 --> 00:13:13.160 position:24% line:83% align:start
we still don't have
any solid evidence.

00:13:13.193 --> 00:13:14.461 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:13:14.495 --> 00:13:15.496 position:16% line:89% align:start
I've been hearing rumors

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:17.666 position:10% line:89% align:start
about this Emma chick myself.

00:13:17.699 --> 00:13:19.634 position:21% line:83% align:start
My sources tell me
that there have been

00:13:19.668 --> 00:13:20.968 position:24% line:83% align:start
numerous sightings
of Emma recently

00:13:21.001 --> 00:13:22.903 position:21% line:83% align:start
leaving Mikey's
house along with him.

00:13:22.936 --> 00:13:25.573 position:13% line:83% align:start
And it's almost invariably
early in the morning.

00:13:25.607 --> 00:13:27.207 position:7% line:89% align:start
The obvious conclusion would be

00:13:27.241 --> 00:13:28.643 position:24% line:83% align:start
she's spending the
night with him,

00:13:28.677 --> 00:13:30.645 position:10% line:89% align:start
and going home the next day.

00:13:30.679 --> 00:13:31.646 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi sighs)

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:33.648 position:19% line:89% align:start
That's super bad news.

00:13:33.682 --> 00:13:34.915 position:24% line:89% align:start
As tragic as it is,

00:13:34.948 --> 00:13:36.685 position:19% line:83% align:start
we have to face the
fact that this mystery

00:13:36.718 --> 00:13:38.553 position:7% line:89% align:start
has now been completely solved.

00:13:38.586 --> 00:13:40.421 position:10% line:89% align:start
Emma and Mikey are positively

00:13:41.889 --> 00:13:43.257 position:21% line:89% align:start
a couple two-timers!

00:13:44.425 --> 00:13:45.893 position:41% line:89% align:start
No way!

00:13:45.926 --> 00:13:48.095 position:19% line:83% align:start
All that's left now is
to get the confessions.

00:13:48.128 --> 00:13:49.664 position:47% line:89% align:start
Uh.

00:13:49.698 --> 00:13:51.165 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're not gonna
ambush them are you?

00:13:51.198 --> 00:13:53.601 position:16% line:83% align:start
I really don't think
that's a very good idea.

00:13:53.635 --> 00:13:55.402 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's the only way
to know for sure.

00:13:55.436 --> 00:13:56.604 position:21% line:89% align:start
If this is happening,

00:13:56.638 --> 00:13:58.372 position:13% line:89% align:start
I feel terrible for Draken.

00:13:58.405 --> 00:13:59.774 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hina.

00:13:59.808 --> 00:14:01.743 position:21% line:83% align:start
But if it's true and
Draken finds out,

00:14:01.776 --> 00:14:03.377 position:5% line:89% align:start
there's gonna be blood for sure!

00:14:04.478 --> 00:14:05.680 position:21% line:89% align:start
(footsteps thudding)

00:14:05.714 --> 00:14:08.849 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasping)

00:14:08.882 --> 00:14:10.785 position:13% line:89% align:start
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:14:10.819 --> 00:14:11.786 position:33% line:89% align:start
Oh, God! No!

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:13.854 position:13% line:89% align:start
What is he doing here now?

00:14:13.887 --> 00:14:14.955 position:21% line:89% align:start
(footsteps thudding)

00:14:14.988 --> 00:14:15.956 position:19% line:89% align:start
Who did your girlfriend

00:14:15.989 --> 00:14:17.525 position:13% line:89% align:start
say she feels terrible for?

00:14:17.559 --> 00:14:18.693 position:33% line:89% align:start
(bell dings)

00:14:18.727 --> 00:14:21.295 position:19% line:89% align:start
Talk about bad timing!

00:14:21.328 --> 00:14:24.164 position:27% line:89% align:start
(table slamming)

00:14:24.198 --> 00:14:24.965 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:14:24.998 --> 00:14:26.133 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hey, what's up?

00:14:26.166 --> 00:14:28.402 position:21% line:83% align:start
Please you two don't
even try to lie!

00:14:28.435 --> 00:14:29.504 position:16% line:89% align:start
Tell me what's going on?

00:14:29.537 --> 00:14:30.538 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:14:31.438 --> 00:14:33.974 position:21% line:89% align:start
(footsteps thudding)

00:14:34.007 --> 00:14:35.510 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi trembling)

00:14:35.543 --> 00:14:36.644 position:21% line:89% align:start
(footsteps thudding)

00:14:36.678 --> 00:14:38.145 position:30% line:89% align:start
Emma and Mikey?

00:14:39.413 --> 00:14:41.583 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's not what it looks
like Draken I swear!

00:14:41.616 --> 00:14:42.584 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:14:42.617 --> 00:14:43.585 position:41% line:89% align:start
Draken?

00:14:43.618 --> 00:14:44.619 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:14:44.652 --> 00:14:48.422 position:5% line:89% align:start
(suspenseful instrumental music)

00:14:48.455 --> 00:14:49.289 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Mikey sighs)

00:14:49.323 --> 00:14:50.891 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Emma gasps)

00:14:50.924 --> 00:14:51.892 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's all over.

00:14:51.925 --> 00:14:53.628 position:27% line:89% align:start
What a disaster!

00:14:54.461 --> 00:14:55.429 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Draken laughs)

00:14:55.462 --> 00:14:56.430 position:19% line:89% align:start
(musical notes chimes)

00:14:56.463 --> 00:14:57.632 position:30% line:89% align:start
Check this out.

00:14:57.665 --> 00:14:58.899 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hanging out with
your little sister

00:14:58.932 --> 00:15:01.468 position:19% line:89% align:start
on her birthday, Mikey.

00:15:01.503 --> 00:15:03.571 position:33% line:89% align:start
Ah, shut up.

00:15:03.605 --> 00:15:04.606 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:15:05.507 --> 00:15:06.808 position:30% line:89% align:start
Little sister?

00:15:06.841 --> 00:15:07.975 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh wait,

00:15:08.008 --> 00:15:10.177 position:16% line:83% align:start
did you not already know
about that, Takemichi?

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:12.747 position:19% line:83% align:start
Mikey and Emma here
are brother and sister,

00:15:12.781 --> 00:15:14.616 position:5% line:89% align:start
though their moms are different.

00:15:14.649 --> 00:15:16.751 position:10% line:89% align:start
(Hina and Takemichi gawking)

00:15:16.785 --> 00:15:18.018 position:16% line:89% align:start
Now that you mention it,

00:15:18.051 --> 00:15:19.754 position:27% line:83% align:start
I guess they do
sorta look alike.

00:15:19.788 --> 00:15:20.755 position:33% line:89% align:start
You think so?

00:15:20.789 --> 00:15:22.624 position:13% line:89% align:start
You know I could have sworn

00:15:22.657 --> 00:15:24.358 position:13% line:89% align:start
I told you about this Hina.

00:15:24.391 --> 00:15:25.527 position:44% line:89% align:start
Damn!

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.261 position:19% line:89% align:start
Is that true detective?

00:15:27.294 --> 00:15:28.962 position:10% line:89% align:start
And how about you Yamagishi?

00:15:28.996 --> 00:15:30.832 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Hina] Wow. Doesn't this
parfait look delicious?

00:15:30.865 --> 00:15:32.032 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Kazushi] Yeah, it sure does.

00:15:32.065 --> 00:15:33.735 position:19% line:89% align:start
Hmm, it's so uh fluffy.

00:15:33.768 --> 00:15:36.571 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Yeah, she just forgot.
-Hmm, yum.

00:15:36.604 --> 00:15:37.672 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Draken] Here.

00:15:39.339 --> 00:15:40.107 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:42.309 position:10% line:89% align:start
Have a happy birthday, Emma!

00:15:42.342 --> 00:15:43.545 position:44% line:89% align:start
Whoa.

00:15:43.578 --> 00:15:44.612 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's that thing you wanted

00:15:44.646 --> 00:15:46.681 position:7% line:89% align:start
from the arcade the other day.

00:15:46.714 --> 00:15:48.817 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Emma fawning)

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:51.351 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well, then I guess
we'll see you later.

00:15:51.385 --> 00:15:52.953 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Emma fawning)

00:15:52.986 --> 00:15:54.021 position:33% line:89% align:start
(wind chimes)

00:15:54.054 --> 00:15:55.523 position:33% line:89% align:start
He's so cool.

00:15:57.725 --> 00:15:59.326 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm so happy for you, Emma.

00:16:00.562 --> 00:16:02.864 position:24% line:89% align:start
(crowd chattering)

00:16:02.897 --> 00:16:05.499 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Emma laughing)

00:16:05.533 --> 00:16:07.968 position:16% line:89% align:start
(soft instrumental music)

00:16:08.001 --> 00:16:10.738 position:21% line:83% align:start
I've never seen Emma
look so happy before.

00:16:10.772 --> 00:16:12.072 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Yeah.

00:16:12.105 --> 00:16:14.475 position:19% line:83% align:start
I hope those two get
everything worked out.

00:16:14.509 --> 00:16:16.176 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:17.010 position:38% line:89% align:start
And hey,

00:16:18.979 --> 00:16:20.981 position:16% line:83% align:start
I hope that everything's
gonna work out okay

00:16:21.014 --> 00:16:22.650 position:13% line:89% align:start
between the two of us too.

00:16:23.651 --> 00:16:26.286 position:16% line:89% align:start
(soft instrumental music)

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.321 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uh-hmm.

00:16:28.556 --> 00:16:29.323 position:30% line:89% align:start
(hands holding)

00:16:29.356 --> 00:16:31.024 position:13% line:89% align:start
I have a feeling they will.

00:16:33.862 --> 00:16:37.765 position:10% line:89% align:start
(Hina and Takemichi laughing)

00:16:39.567 --> 00:16:41.034 position:24% line:89% align:start
What just happened?

00:16:41.068 --> 00:16:43.003 position:16% line:83% align:start
Looks like you and I have
been totally forgotten.

00:16:43.036 --> 00:16:44.706 position:19% line:89% align:start
Like yesterday's paper.

00:16:46.039 --> 00:16:47.007 position:30% line:89% align:start
(door opening)

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.041 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Naoto] We're home.

00:16:49.276 --> 00:16:51.011 position:5% line:89% align:start
Thanks for walking me back home.

00:16:51.044 --> 00:16:52.012 position:35% line:89% align:start
Goodnight!

00:16:52.045 --> 00:16:53.013 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uh-hmm.

00:16:53.046 --> 00:16:55.583 position:33% line:89% align:start
(door closes)

00:16:55.617 --> 00:16:58.520 position:30% line:89% align:start
(phone chimes)

00:16:58.553 --> 00:17:00.020 position:33% line:89% align:start
It's Mitsuya.

00:17:00.053 --> 00:17:01.054 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hey, what's up?

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:05.092 position:24% line:89% align:start
(crowd chattering)

00:17:05.125 --> 00:17:07.227 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi grunting)

00:17:07.261 --> 00:17:09.196 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Peh] Hey, Takemichi!

00:17:09.229 --> 00:17:10.798 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Damn, is that Peh?

00:17:10.832 --> 00:17:12.466 position:13% line:89% align:start
Wow, he looks so unnerving!

00:17:12.499 --> 00:17:15.202 position:13% line:83% align:start
Hey man, I'm sorry to keep
you waiting for so long.

00:17:15.235 --> 00:17:16.704 position:7% line:89% align:start
I know Mitsuya called you here

00:17:16.738 --> 00:17:19.707 position:13% line:83% align:start
but he's busy right now so
I'll take you in instead.

00:17:19.741 --> 00:17:20.708 position:38% line:89% align:start
Come on.

00:17:20.742 --> 00:17:22.710 position:30% line:89% align:start
Oh yeah, sure.

00:17:22.744 --> 00:17:23.745 position:21% line:89% align:start
(footsteps thudding)

00:17:23.778 --> 00:17:26.179 position:19% line:83% align:start
So Peh, I guess you go
to the same junior high

00:17:26.213 --> 00:17:27.347 position:27% line:89% align:start
as Mitsuya right?

00:17:27.381 --> 00:17:28.415 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:17:28.448 --> 00:17:30.317 position:21% line:83% align:start
We're the same school
and the same division.

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:32.020 position:24% line:83% align:start
Why? Do you have a
problem with that?

00:17:32.052 --> 00:17:33.021 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uh no!

00:17:34.589 --> 00:17:35.723 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Peh] We're here.

00:17:35.757 --> 00:17:36.724 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Huh?

00:17:36.758 --> 00:17:38.292 position:27% line:89% align:start
The Home Ec room?

00:17:38.325 --> 00:17:40.562 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Peh] Man, I hate
dealing with her.

00:17:40.595 --> 00:17:42.664 position:30% line:89% align:start
Huh, with who?

00:17:42.697 --> 00:17:43.932 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Yasuda] Hayashi?

00:17:43.965 --> 00:17:46.233 position:19% line:83% align:start
Are you here to bother
our president again?

00:17:46.266 --> 00:17:47.234 position:24% line:89% align:start
Maybe I could uh...

00:17:47.267 --> 00:17:48.670 position:13% line:89% align:start
Well, he's busy now anyway

00:17:48.703 --> 00:17:50.070 position:27% line:89% align:start
so just get lost.

00:17:50.103 --> 00:17:51.238 position:24% line:89% align:start
But could I just...

00:17:51.271 --> 00:17:53.140 position:21% line:83% align:start
And also why are you
dressed like that?

00:17:53.173 --> 00:17:55.075 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's only because
you dress that way

00:17:55.108 --> 00:17:57.144 position:21% line:83% align:start
that the teachers are
always picking on you.

00:17:58.111 --> 00:17:59.079 position:21% line:89% align:start
(footsteps thudding)

00:17:59.112 --> 00:18:00.213 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Mitsuya] What's up?

00:18:00.247 --> 00:18:02.449 position:21% line:83% align:start
President! Hayashi's
here for you again!

00:18:02.482 --> 00:18:03.651 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:18:03.685 --> 00:18:04.686 position:38% line:89% align:start
Mitsuya?

00:18:05.653 --> 00:18:06.654 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hey, Takemichi.

00:18:06.688 --> 00:18:07.956 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hi.

00:18:07.989 --> 00:18:10.058 position:24% line:83% align:start
And Yasuda come
on, go easy on Peh.

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:11.859 position:24% line:83% align:start
I asked him to run
an errand for me,

00:18:11.893 --> 00:18:12.894 position:27% line:89% align:start
so it's all good.

00:18:12.927 --> 00:18:14.028 position:27% line:89% align:start
I can't help it!

00:18:14.062 --> 00:18:16.030 position:19% line:83% align:start
I hate all delinquents
except you.

00:18:16.064 --> 00:18:17.532 position:19% line:83% align:start
Why is she keep calling
you "President."

00:18:17.565 --> 00:18:18.700 position:38% line:89% align:start
Mitsuya?

00:18:18.733 --> 00:18:20.167 position:19% line:89% align:start
Come in an' you'll see.

00:18:21.234 --> 00:18:22.202 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Sewing Club Member]
Oh President,

00:18:22.235 --> 00:18:23.605 position:10% line:89% align:start
can you take a look at this?

00:18:23.638 --> 00:18:25.105 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Sewing Club Member] I need
you over here too president.

00:18:25.138 --> 00:18:26.373 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'll get to you all.

00:18:26.406 --> 00:18:28.108 position:27% line:83% align:start
He's president of
the sewing club?

00:18:28.141 --> 00:18:30.210 position:21% line:83% align:start
Wait right here for
just a bit Takemichi.

00:18:30.243 --> 00:18:31.311 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's almost done.

00:18:31.746 --> 00:18:32.714 position:47% line:89% align:start
Uh.

00:18:32.747 --> 00:18:33.915 position:44% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:18:33.948 --> 00:18:35.282 position:13% line:89% align:start
Yamada, let me just suggest

00:18:35.315 --> 00:18:37.051 position:16% line:83% align:start
maybe a half-stitch
would work better there.

00:18:37.085 --> 00:18:38.352 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, right.

00:18:38.385 --> 00:18:40.387 position:13% line:83% align:start
And Kawai, I think you
should try a blanket stitch

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:41.455 position:16% line:89% align:start
to close off those sides.

00:18:41.488 --> 00:18:42.690 position:44% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:18:42.724 --> 00:18:45.093 position:10% line:83% align:start
Careful not to hurt your
fingers when you're in close.

00:18:45.125 --> 00:18:46.460 position:21% line:89% align:start
He's in a biker gang,

00:18:46.493 --> 00:18:48.730 position:13% line:83% align:start
but he's still living his
school life to the fullest.

00:18:48.763 --> 00:18:50.932 position:16% line:89% align:start
Man, Mitsuya is amazing!

00:18:50.965 --> 00:18:52.934 position:24% line:89% align:start
(machine clanking)

00:18:52.967 --> 00:18:54.836 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's he mean by "Almost done?"

00:18:54.869 --> 00:18:56.403 position:13% line:89% align:start
What was he talking about?

00:18:56.436 --> 00:18:58.106 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Your jacket?
-Huh?

00:18:58.138 --> 00:18:59.306 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's really pretty impressive

00:18:59.339 --> 00:19:01.676 position:16% line:83% align:start
that Mitsuya himself
took on the job of making

00:19:01.709 --> 00:19:03.143 position:16% line:89% align:start
your new jacket for you.

00:19:03.176 --> 00:19:05.145 position:24% line:83% align:start
Whoa that's hard to
believe actually!

00:19:06.346 --> 00:19:08.950 position:19% line:83% align:start
First time since the OG
members, right Mitsuya?

00:19:08.983 --> 00:19:11.052 position:27% line:83% align:start
In Toman our only
actual formal wear

00:19:11.085 --> 00:19:12.520 position:30% line:89% align:start
is our jackets.

00:19:12.553 --> 00:19:15.455 position:16% line:83% align:start
I just wanted to show
you my thanks, Takemichi.

00:19:16.724 --> 00:19:19.794 position:19% line:83% align:start
You saved Draken at the
Battle of August 3rd.

00:19:19.827 --> 00:19:21.029 position:10% line:89% align:start
And you open everyone's eyes

00:19:21.062 --> 00:19:22.295 position:16% line:89% align:start
at the Bloody Halloween.

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:24.632 position:10% line:89% align:start
It was really pretty amazing.

00:19:26.233 --> 00:19:28.903 position:21% line:83% align:start
So I wanted to be the
one to do your jacket.

00:19:29.804 --> 00:19:32.073 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi admiring)

00:19:32.106 --> 00:19:33.608 position:24% line:89% align:start
Thank you so much.

00:19:33.641 --> 00:19:35.109 position:33% line:89% align:start
You dumbass!

00:19:35.143 --> 00:19:36.944 position:24% line:83% align:start
Doing this for you
is my pleasure.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:41.381 position:27% line:89% align:start
(birds chirping)

00:19:41.415 --> 00:19:42.182 position:41% line:89% align:start
There.

00:19:42.215 --> 00:19:43.818 position:35% line:89% align:start
It's done.

00:19:43.851 --> 00:19:45.953 position:19% line:89% align:start
Now try it on Takemichi

00:19:45.987 --> 00:19:48.122 position:13% line:89% align:start
so I can make adjustments.

00:19:48.156 --> 00:19:49.356 position:38% line:89% align:start
Glad to.

00:19:51.092 --> 00:19:53.561 position:21% line:83% align:start
Tomorrow's meeting's
gonna be a big deal!

00:19:53.594 --> 00:19:54.862 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uh-hmm.

00:19:54.896 --> 00:19:57.865 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi laughs)

00:20:01.769 --> 00:20:04.505 position:24% line:89% align:start
(crowd chattering)

00:20:15.917 --> 00:20:17.685 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hey, hurry up Takemichi.

00:20:17.719 --> 00:20:18.886 position:30% line:89% align:start
This attention.

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:20.722 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's all kinda embarrassing.

00:20:20.755 --> 00:20:21.923 position:44% line:89% align:start
Nah.

00:20:21.956 --> 00:20:22.990 position:19% line:89% align:start
We wanna show you off.

00:20:23.024 --> 00:20:24.224 position:30% line:89% align:start
All right then.

00:20:25.425 --> 00:20:28.361 position:24% line:89% align:start
(crowd chattering)

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:41.441 position:21% line:89% align:start
(footsteps thudding)

00:20:41.475 --> 00:20:42.442 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:20:42.476 --> 00:20:43.276 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:44.645 position:21% line:89% align:start
(footsteps thudding)

00:20:44.679 --> 00:20:45.479 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:20:46.614 --> 00:20:51.519 position:24% line:83% align:start
(inspirational
instrumental music)

00:20:52.153 --> 00:20:53.320 position:30% line:89% align:start

00:20:56.124 --> 00:20:58.492 position:21% line:89% align:start
(footsteps thudding)

00:20:58.526 --> 00:21:00.561 position:27% line:83% align:start
You've changed up
your look, I see.

00:21:00.595 --> 00:21:01.963 position:24% line:83% align:start
(Takemichi laughs)
Yeah.

00:21:01.996 --> 00:21:03.463 position:5% line:89% align:start
I think the jacket is wearing me

00:21:03.497 --> 00:21:04.999 position:5% line:89% align:start
instead of the other way around.

00:21:06.033 --> 00:21:07.267 position:33% line:89% align:start
At this time,

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.704 position:24% line:83% align:start
I formally welcome
you into Tomam.

00:21:09.737 --> 00:21:10.738 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right!

00:21:11.939 --> 00:21:13.207 position:21% line:89% align:start
I accept this honor!

00:21:13.241 --> 00:21:14.208 position:35% line:89% align:start
Thank you.

00:21:14.242 --> 00:21:15.777 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:16.811 position:44% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:21:19.147 --> 00:21:21.115 position:10% line:89% align:start
This meeting's now in order!

00:21:21.149 --> 00:21:22.349 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right!

00:21:23.283 --> 00:21:26.821 position:21% line:89% align:start
(footsteps thudding)

00:21:26.854 --> 00:21:29.924 position:21% line:83% align:start
This night's gonna
be important for you.

00:21:29.957 --> 00:21:30.758 position:21% line:89% align:start
I hope you're ready.

00:21:32.459 --> 00:21:34.228 position:24% line:89% align:start

(crowd chattering)

00:22:01.589 --> 00:22:05.059 position:21% line:83% align:start
Our gathering tonight
is about to get messy.

00:22:05.092 --> 00:22:06.561 position:7% line:89% align:start
We're settling things for good

00:22:06.594 --> 00:22:08.963 position:13% line:89% align:start
after the Bloody Halloween.
