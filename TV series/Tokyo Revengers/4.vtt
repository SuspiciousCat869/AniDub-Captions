00:00:08.843 --> 00:00:10.545 position:10% line:89% align:start
Can you believe this picture?

00:00:10.578 --> 00:00:13.180 position:30% line:89% align:start
(all laughing)

00:00:14.516 --> 00:00:15.984 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's hilarious!

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:17.552 position:41% line:89% align:start
I know!

00:00:17.585 --> 00:00:18.686 position:24% line:89% align:start
Damn, they're loud.

00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:23.457 position:30% line:83% align:start
-[Hinata] Hey!
-[Group] Huh?

00:00:24.893 --> 00:00:26.326 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hi-Hina?

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:29.363 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're taking up
way too much space!

00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:31.298 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's fine when it's not crowded,

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:33.968 position:21% line:83% align:start
but you're making
that old lady stand.

00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:35.168 position:24% line:89% align:start
Make her some room.

00:00:37.137 --> 00:00:39.172 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Okay.
-Hey, scooch over!

00:00:40.474 --> 00:00:41.643 position:33% line:89% align:start
Thanks, guys!

00:00:41.676 --> 00:00:42.944 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Yeah.
-Yeah, sure.

00:00:42.977 --> 00:00:44.244 position:33% line:89% align:start
You're cute.

00:00:44.278 --> 00:00:46.280 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Hinata] Ma'am, there's
an open seat right here.

00:00:46.313 --> 00:00:49.082 position:27% line:83% align:start
My! Thank you so
much, young lady.

00:00:49.951 --> 00:00:52.587 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Wow! Hina's amazing!

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:59.259 position:21% line:89% align:start
(opening theme music)

00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:27.314 position:10% line:83% align:start
Thank you for coming
shopping with me, Takemichi.

00:02:27.347 --> 00:02:29.316 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh, it's no problem.

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.351 position:10% line:89% align:start
How did your final exams go?

00:02:31.385 --> 00:02:34.555 position:5% line:83% align:start
Wow, you know, I haven't
thought about finals in forever.

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:35.556 position:27% line:89% align:start
How do you mean?

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.058 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-We just finished with them.

00:02:37.091 --> 00:02:39.159 position:13% line:89% align:start
Oh yeah, of course we did.

00:02:39.192 --> 00:02:42.162 position:21% line:83% align:start
Shit, I was thinking
out loud again!

00:02:42.195 --> 00:02:44.231 position:13% line:89% align:start
Well, make sure you study.

00:02:44.264 --> 00:02:46.534 position:16% line:89% align:start
You have a dream, right?

00:02:46.567 --> 00:02:47.835 position:38% line:89% align:start
A dream?

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:50.404 position:21% line:83% align:start
Did I have dreams and
aspirations back then?

00:02:53.107 --> 00:02:54.742 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Hinata] Well! That settles it.

00:02:54.776 --> 00:02:56.209 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Huh?

00:02:56.243 --> 00:02:58.412 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm going to help you
with your studying.

00:02:59.981 --> 00:03:02.249 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Whoa! (laughing)

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:05.419 position:33% line:89% align:start
What's wrong?

00:03:06.654 --> 00:03:09.189 position:13% line:83% align:start
I've just never been inside
a girl's room before!

00:03:10.158 --> 00:03:11.693 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh, stop gawking already.

00:03:11.726 --> 00:03:13.161 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yeah, okay.

00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:14.862 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Hinata] You could be
a bit less obvious.

00:03:14.896 --> 00:03:16.496 position:24% line:89% align:start
Sorry to interrupt,

00:03:16.531 --> 00:03:19.701 position:7% line:83% align:start
and I don't have much prepared
because this is so sudden.

00:03:19.734 --> 00:03:21.869 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's so sad because
this is the first time

00:03:21.903 --> 00:03:23.303 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hina's brought a boy home.

00:03:23.336 --> 00:03:24.304 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Hinata] Mom!

00:03:24.337 --> 00:03:26.206 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh, don't worry about me.

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.542 position:33% line:89% align:start
He's a cutie.

00:03:27.575 --> 00:03:29.711 position:13% line:83% align:start
How long have the two of
you been seeing each other?

00:03:29.744 --> 00:03:31.979 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Hinata] That's enough,
Mom. Out now, thank you!

00:03:32.013 --> 00:03:33.681 position:44% line:89% align:start
Awe.

00:03:33.715 --> 00:03:34.716 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Boyfriend?
-Mama!

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:39.453 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] Wow, I'm
not getting this at all.

00:03:39.486 --> 00:03:40.722 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Hinata] Oh, by the way,

00:03:40.755 --> 00:03:42.623 position:24% line:83% align:start
thanks for looking
out for my brother.

00:03:42.657 --> 00:03:43.457 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Hm?

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:44.992 position:10% line:89% align:start
He told me that you saved him

00:03:45.026 --> 00:03:46.460 position:27% line:83% align:start
from some bullies
the other night.

00:03:46.493 --> 00:03:47.260 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:03:47.294 --> 00:03:48.629 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Hinata] My dad's
not around much.

00:03:48.663 --> 00:03:51.298 position:19% line:83% align:start
He's so busy he rarely
has time to come home.

00:03:52.466 --> 00:03:54.902 position:13% line:83% align:start
Naoto and dad don't really
get along very well,

00:03:54.936 --> 00:03:58.438 position:5% line:83% align:start
but lately Naoto has started
saying he wants to be like him.

00:03:58.472 --> 00:03:59.272 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:04:00.842 --> 00:04:02.744 position:19% line:89% align:start
Our dad is a policeman.

00:04:02.777 --> 00:04:04.145 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:04:04.178 --> 00:04:06.480 position:16% line:83% align:start
So that's why Naoto
became a police officer!

00:04:06.514 --> 00:04:07.481 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:04:07.515 --> 00:04:09.884 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, he isn't one yet
because he's just a kid.

00:04:09.917 --> 00:04:12.186 position:13% line:83% align:start
(nervously laughing) Yeah,
of course, of course!

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.721 position:10% line:89% align:start
What am I even talking about?

00:04:14.722 --> 00:04:16.224 position:33% line:89% align:start
But honestly,

00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:19.026 position:19% line:83% align:start
you could say it was me
that was saved by him.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.260 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Hinata] Huh?

00:04:20.293 --> 00:04:22.597 position:24% line:83% align:start
I think Naoto will
make a great cop.

00:04:23.731 --> 00:04:25.900 position:21% line:83% align:start
Although, he might
turn out a bit loopy.

00:04:27.235 --> 00:04:29.369 position:13% line:89% align:start
Takemichi, you've changed.

00:04:29.402 --> 00:04:32.907 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ah, you think? Like changed how?

00:04:34.474 --> 00:04:36.711 position:10% line:83% align:start
Well, for one thing, you seem
nicer somehow these days,

00:04:36.744 --> 00:04:38.646 position:24% line:83% align:start
and maybe more
mature lately too.

00:04:38.679 --> 00:04:42.650 position:10% line:83% align:start
I feel like I'm talking to
someone much older than I am!

00:04:42.683 --> 00:04:43.851 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh!

00:04:43.885 --> 00:04:46.220 position:21% line:83% align:start
Whoa, she's sharp!
I am 12 years older!

00:04:46.254 --> 00:04:48.455 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Hinata] Or maybe I'm
just seeing a side of you

00:04:48.488 --> 00:04:50.558 position:5% line:89% align:start
that I never really knew before.

00:04:50.591 --> 00:04:51.391 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:04:52.527 --> 00:04:56.130 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'd love to know more, to
know everything about you.

00:04:56.164 --> 00:04:58.966 position:19% line:89% align:start
(fireworks discharging)

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.670 position:21% line:89% align:start
(fireworks exploding)

00:05:02.703 --> 00:05:03.704 position:35% line:89% align:start
Fireworks!

00:05:03.738 --> 00:05:06.174 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's right, tonight's
the fireworks display!

00:05:06.207 --> 00:05:07.340 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:05:10.343 --> 00:05:14.248 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hey! Let's go up to
the roof and watch!

00:05:14.282 --> 00:05:15.583 position:21% line:89% align:start
(fireworks exploding)

00:05:15.616 --> 00:05:19.319 position:21% line:83% align:start
Wow, this is awesome!
They're so pretty!

00:05:19.352 --> 00:05:21.856 position:16% line:83% align:start
Hurry up, Takemichi!
You're gonna miss it all!

00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:27.695 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] Damn,
this is really fun.

00:05:29.297 --> 00:05:31.699 position:24% line:83% align:start
This never happened
in my old life.

00:05:34.168 --> 00:05:35.636 position:33% line:89% align:start
Wow! A heart!

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:37.505 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hey, did you see that one?

00:05:37.538 --> 00:05:39.372 position:7% line:89% align:start
I just wanna stay here forever.

00:05:40.541 --> 00:05:43.110 position:24% line:83% align:start
I don't wanna go
back to the future

00:05:43.144 --> 00:05:47.414 position:21% line:83% align:start
because in the
future, Hina is gone.

00:05:47.447 --> 00:05:50.918 position:24% line:89% align:start
(soft piano music)

00:05:50.952 --> 00:05:53.054 position:21% line:83% align:start
It wouldn't hurt to
hold her hand, right?

00:06:00.427 --> 00:06:01.428 position:35% line:89% align:start
It's warm.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.434 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hina.

00:06:09.203 --> 00:06:10.403 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:06:11.404 --> 00:06:13.040 position:35% line:89% align:start
Um, oh, hi.

00:06:14.008 --> 00:06:15.009 position:41% line:89% align:start
Naoto?

00:06:16.344 --> 00:06:18.012 position:10% line:89% align:start
The handshake is the trigger.

00:06:20.715 --> 00:06:23.184 position:35% line:89% align:start
Ah! Naoto!

00:06:23.217 --> 00:06:25.019 position:27% line:83% align:start
Oh, I didn't know
you were up here.

00:06:25.052 --> 00:06:26.020 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Naoto] Yeah.

00:06:26.053 --> 00:06:30.224 position:13% line:89% align:start
You've gotta be kidding me!

00:06:30.258 --> 00:06:33.027 position:38% line:89% align:start
(crying)

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.494 position:35% line:89% align:start
Takemichi!

00:06:34.528 --> 00:06:36.230 position:21% line:89% align:start
Damn it! I came back!

00:06:36.264 --> 00:06:38.398 position:19% line:89% align:start
Huh? What's that mean?

00:06:38.431 --> 00:06:40.568 position:13% line:89% align:start
Did you return to the past?

00:06:40.601 --> 00:06:42.570 position:21% line:83% align:start
Shaking hands really
is the trigger.

00:06:42.603 --> 00:06:46.307 position:21% line:83% align:start
And you! What were
you doing there, man?

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:48.009 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Naoto] Huh? What are
you talking about?

00:06:48.042 --> 00:06:49.510 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi crying)

00:06:49.543 --> 00:06:52.146 position:10% line:83% align:start
Anyway, at least now we know
my hypothesis was correct.

00:06:52.179 --> 00:06:54.815 position:10% line:89% align:start
Yeah, hooray for you I guess.

00:06:54.849 --> 00:06:56.784 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Naoto] So, mission
accomplished?

00:06:56.817 --> 00:06:57.752 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:06:57.785 --> 00:07:00.922 position:24% line:83% align:start
Tell me everything.
How did it go?

00:07:00.955 --> 00:07:03.324 position:13% line:83% align:start
You're back, because you
must have changed something

00:07:03.357 --> 00:07:05.259 position:27% line:83% align:start
while you were in
the past, right?

00:07:05.293 --> 00:07:06.961 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yeah, well...

00:07:08.095 --> 00:07:10.598 position:10% line:89% align:start
You shook my hand by mistake?

00:07:10.631 --> 00:07:12.133 position:24% line:89% align:start
This is not a joke!

00:07:13.601 --> 00:07:16.871 position:10% line:83% align:start
Your second trip into the
past did teach us one thing.

00:07:16.904 --> 00:07:17.905 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:20.942 position:10% line:89% align:start
Your time travel capabilities

00:07:20.975 --> 00:07:24.078 position:19% line:83% align:start
dictate that you return
12 years into the past.

00:07:25.646 --> 00:07:28.282 position:13% line:83% align:start
For example, if you were to
go back into the past today,

00:07:28.316 --> 00:07:31.285 position:24% line:83% align:start
you'd go back to
today 12 years ago.

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:34.221 position:10% line:83% align:start
And if you came back here
after spending a week there,

00:07:34.255 --> 00:07:36.456 position:27% line:83% align:start
a week would've
also passed here.

00:07:36.489 --> 00:07:38.659 position:19% line:83% align:start
Meanwhile, while you
were back in the past,

00:07:38.693 --> 00:07:41.494 position:7% line:83% align:start
your body here would have been
held in suspended animation.

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:45.132 position:16% line:89% align:start
Huh? You mean I was dead?

00:07:45.166 --> 00:07:46.667 position:27% line:89% align:start
Not dead exactly.

00:07:46.701 --> 00:07:48.970 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're here but just
as an empty shell.

00:07:49.003 --> 00:07:52.039 position:21% line:83% align:start
Ah, so that's
suspended animation.

00:07:52.073 --> 00:07:54.709 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's dangerous, so
whenever you time travel,

00:07:54.742 --> 00:07:56.877 position:19% line:83% align:start
we'll make sure you're
here in my room.

00:07:56.911 --> 00:07:58.846 position:27% line:83% align:start
So, tell me how
your mission went

00:07:58.879 --> 00:08:01.382 position:19% line:83% align:start
to keep Sano and
Kisaki from meeting up.

00:08:01.415 --> 00:08:03.217 position:33% line:89% align:start
Really good.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.052 position:5% line:89% align:start
I got to know Mikey pretty well.

00:08:05.086 --> 00:08:07.755 position:27% line:89% align:start
Mikey? Oh, Sano.

00:08:07.788 --> 00:08:09.156 position:13% line:89% align:start
Check it out though, Naoto!

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:11.592 position:13% line:83% align:start
Mikey's a boss but he's
actually a really good guy!

00:08:11.625 --> 00:08:14.862 position:21% line:83% align:start
What? Why the hell
didn't you kill him?

00:08:14.895 --> 00:08:16.297 position:30% line:89% align:start
Huh? Kill him?

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.099 position:24% line:83% align:start
This is the guy who
killed my sister,

00:08:18.132 --> 00:08:20.468 position:16% line:83% align:start
and now you're trying to
tell me he's a good guy?

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.003 position:27% line:89% align:start
Has he turned you

00:08:22.036 --> 00:08:25.006 position:10% line:83% align:start
'cause your new friend Mikey
is now so deep into crime

00:08:25.039 --> 00:08:27.508 position:19% line:83% align:start
that the police can't
even touch him anymore!

00:08:27.541 --> 00:08:31.579 position:16% line:83% align:start
If I only could, I'd kill
him with my own two hands!

00:08:40.855 --> 00:08:41.655 position:41% line:89% align:start
Naoto,

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:44.525 position:19% line:89% align:start
let's go talk to Mikey.

00:08:44.558 --> 00:08:46.027 position:35% line:89% align:start
Too risky.

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:48.863 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] I wanna talk to
him in person in the present.

00:08:48.896 --> 00:08:51.165 position:7% line:89% align:start
There's no point in doing that.

00:08:51.198 --> 00:08:54.503 position:19% line:83% align:start
I think you're wrong. I
think we can trust him.

00:08:54.535 --> 00:08:56.537 position:24% line:83% align:start
I need to hear it
from Mikey himself.

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:58.572 position:27% line:83% align:start
Toman changed and
I want the reason.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.042 position:16% line:89% align:start
I need to know the answer

00:09:01.075 --> 00:09:03.244 position:21% line:83% align:start
before I go back
into the past again.

00:09:05.379 --> 00:09:09.650 position:13% line:83% align:start
I need to make contact with
Mikey and I need your help.

00:09:13.788 --> 00:09:15.990 position:24% line:83% align:start
(sighs) I don't
know what happened

00:09:16.023 --> 00:09:19.760 position:10% line:83% align:start
to you there in the past, but
you've changed, Takemichi.

00:09:19.794 --> 00:09:23.330 position:21% line:83% align:start
Huh, you really think
so? Like how, exactly?

00:09:23.364 --> 00:09:25.299 position:5% line:89% align:start
Your weak side seems to be gone.

00:09:26.333 --> 00:09:28.002 position:7% line:89% align:start
Well, at least a little of it.

00:09:28.035 --> 00:09:31.005 position:5% line:83% align:start
But that's a good thing, right?
So am I finally cool now?

00:09:31.038 --> 00:09:32.306 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Naoto] Right, so
let's figure out

00:09:32.339 --> 00:09:33.774 position:19% line:89% align:start
how to meet with Mikey.

00:09:33.808 --> 00:09:36.177 position:13% line:83% align:start
Don't stop! Are you saying
I'm super awesome now?

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:38.712 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Keep going!
-You sure get carried away.

00:09:40.047 --> 00:09:42.049 position:13% line:83% align:start
I need you to organize
these documents, Takemichi.

00:09:43.617 --> 00:09:46.754 position:16% line:83% align:start
Damn, the Tokyo Manji
gang has been going nuts.

00:09:47.888 --> 00:09:51.392 position:13% line:83% align:start
Mikey is extremely careful.
He leaves no clues.

00:09:51.425 --> 00:09:53.427 position:21% line:83% align:start
Even the police
can't track him down.

00:09:53.461 --> 00:09:54.728 position:27% line:83% align:start
His phone's also
probably a burner

00:09:54.762 --> 00:09:56.664 position:7% line:89% align:start
that he got under a fake name.

00:09:57.566 --> 00:09:58.866 position:24% line:89% align:start
Wait, who is this?

00:09:58.899 --> 00:09:59.900 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:10:02.303 --> 00:10:06.207 position:19% line:83% align:start
Atsushi Sendo, part of
Toman's upper echelon?

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.241 position:41% line:89% align:start
Akkun!

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:12.680 position:7% line:89% align:start
Akkun? As in your friend Akkun?

00:10:14.315 --> 00:10:15.850 position:19% line:89% align:start
Something's wrong here.

00:10:15.883 --> 00:10:17.552 position:7% line:89% align:start
When he was 16, he was arrested

00:10:17.586 --> 00:10:19.987 position:21% line:83% align:start
for stabbing Kiyomizu
Masataka from Toman.

00:10:20.955 --> 00:10:22.623 position:24% line:83% align:start
After his release,
he was nothing more

00:10:22.656 --> 00:10:24.258 position:19% line:89% align:start
than some no-name punk.

00:10:26.627 --> 00:10:28.662 position:21% line:83% align:start
I was on the verge
of stabbing Kiyomasa.

00:10:29.663 --> 00:10:31.999 position:13% line:89% align:start
He said that was his plan,

00:10:32.032 --> 00:10:33.267 position:27% line:89% align:start
but he didn't so

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:35.669 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Both] The past has changed?

00:10:35.703 --> 00:10:38.339 position:13% line:83% align:start
Akkun didn't follow through
on stabbing Kiyomasa,

00:10:38.372 --> 00:10:40.040 position:5% line:89% align:start
so he was never arrested for it.

00:10:40.074 --> 00:10:44.178 position:7% line:83% align:start
The fact that you and Mikey
became friendly allowed Sendo-

00:10:44.211 --> 00:10:47.181 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] To then become
part of Toman's upper echelon!

00:10:49.618 --> 00:10:52.253 position:24% line:83% align:start
Okay. Can you still
get a hold of Sendo?

00:10:53.622 --> 00:10:56.056 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yeah, as long as his
number hasn't changed.

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:58.726 position:21% line:83% align:start
Since Sendo's in the
upper echelon now,

00:10:58.759 --> 00:11:00.327 position:16% line:89% align:start
use him to get to Mikey!

00:11:00.361 --> 00:11:03.197 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasps)

00:11:04.566 --> 00:11:06.834 position:21% line:83% align:start
I should warn you my
place is a disaster.

00:11:06.867 --> 00:11:08.836 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yeah, somehow that
doesn't surprise me.

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:11.839 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh! What's that smell?

00:11:11.872 --> 00:11:13.807 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh please, I warned
you, didn't I?

00:11:13.841 --> 00:11:16.010 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Naoto] No human should
ever live like this!

00:11:16.043 --> 00:11:18.879 position:19% line:83% align:start
Just hang on a sec, let
me find my old notebook.

00:11:20.047 --> 00:11:22.651 position:21% line:83% align:start
Believe it or not, I
have a filing system.

00:11:22.683 --> 00:11:24.084 position:35% line:89% align:start
That hurt.

00:11:24.118 --> 00:11:26.521 position:10% line:83% align:start
(gags) I'm going to break out
in hives from all this dust!

00:11:26.555 --> 00:11:28.689 position:24% line:83% align:start
I have to go out
and buy some masks!

00:11:28.722 --> 00:11:30.691 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh okay, yeah, but
hurry up though!

00:11:35.696 --> 00:11:37.731 position:30% line:89% align:start
A-ha! Found it!

00:11:37.765 --> 00:11:41.636 position:19% line:83% align:start
Ha-ha! Boy, seeing this
really takes me back!

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:44.606 position:19% line:83% align:start
Talk about taking a
trip down memory lane.

00:11:44.639 --> 00:11:47.875 position:24% line:83% align:start
And oh wow, look at
this! Unbelievable!

00:11:47.908 --> 00:11:50.377 position:19% line:83% align:start
Do you mind picking up
the pace a little bit?

00:11:50.411 --> 00:11:51.378 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:11:51.412 --> 00:11:53.781 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh yeah, right. Akkun.

00:11:56.016 --> 00:11:56.817 position:38% line:89% align:start
Found it!

00:11:57.751 --> 00:11:59.253 position:10% line:89% align:start
Let's hope the number's good.

00:12:01.656 --> 00:12:04.325 position:30% line:89% align:start
(phone ringing)

00:12:06.595 --> 00:12:07.728 position:41% line:89% align:start
Akkun.

00:12:09.564 --> 00:12:11.065 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Akkun] See you tomorrow.

00:12:11.098 --> 00:12:12.099 position:41% line:89% align:start
See ya.

00:12:15.436 --> 00:12:17.738 position:10% line:89% align:start
(sighs) My whole body hurts.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.407 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hey, Akkun?

00:12:20.441 --> 00:12:21.842 position:35% line:89% align:start
[Akkun] Hm?

00:12:21.875 --> 00:12:26.413 position:10% line:83% align:start
Someday after we all graduate
and go our separate ways

00:12:26.447 --> 00:12:28.916 position:7% line:89% align:start
and we stop seeing each other,

00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:32.621 position:13% line:83% align:start
what would we talk about
after we've become adults?

00:12:32.654 --> 00:12:35.089 position:21% line:83% align:start
You dumbass, nothing
is gonna change.

00:12:35.122 --> 00:12:36.390 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:12:36.423 --> 00:12:37.491 position:27% line:89% align:start
Friends for life.

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:42.129 position:30% line:89% align:start
(phone ringing)

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.335 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Naoto] This is
really where Sendo is?

00:12:48.369 --> 00:12:49.770 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:12:49.803 --> 00:12:52.773 position:13% line:83% align:start
Apparently he runs a
high-end hostess bar here.

00:12:52.806 --> 00:12:55.677 position:21% line:83% align:start
Are you sure it's
okay, us dropping by?

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:58.445 position:16% line:83% align:start
Sendo is one of the
higher-ups at Toman now.

00:12:58.479 --> 00:13:00.848 position:16% line:83% align:start
And I can guarantee that
none of that will matter

00:13:00.881 --> 00:13:03.117 position:13% line:89% align:start
'cause Akkun's still Akkun.

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:06.854 position:10% line:83% align:start
I do have to admit he sounded
a little older on the phone,

00:13:06.887 --> 00:13:08.956 position:19% line:89% align:start
but otherwise the same.

00:13:08.989 --> 00:13:10.824 position:13% line:89% align:start
Well, I'm still concerned.

00:13:10.858 --> 00:13:13.294 position:19% line:83% align:start
You shouldn't have said
you wanted to see Mikey.

00:13:13.327 --> 00:13:14.395 position:38% line:89% align:start
Why not?

00:13:14.428 --> 00:13:16.297 position:19% line:89% align:start
You're being too open.

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:19.133 position:19% line:83% align:start
He's someone the police
can't get close to.

00:13:19.166 --> 00:13:21.569 position:24% line:83% align:start
We might be walking
into a trap here.

00:13:21.603 --> 00:13:23.638 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's dumb, Naoto!

00:13:23.672 --> 00:13:25.339 position:24% line:83% align:start
It takes more than
something like that

00:13:25.372 --> 00:13:26.741 position:19% line:89% align:start
to change a friendship!

00:13:26.775 --> 00:13:29.443 position:19% line:83% align:start
Just follow me and
we'll be totally fine!

00:13:29.476 --> 00:13:31.613 position:27% line:89% align:start
(women giggling)

00:13:31.646 --> 00:13:33.981 position:16% line:89% align:start
(smooth saxophone music)

00:13:34.014 --> 00:13:36.618 position:24% line:83% align:start
Welcome, gentlemen!
Who do you like?

00:13:36.651 --> 00:13:38.653 position:27% line:89% align:start
Huh? Um, I don't-

00:13:38.687 --> 00:13:40.187 position:21% line:89% align:start
You going to be okay?

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:43.692 position:13% line:83% align:start
Hi, I've got an appointment
here with your boss Sendo.

00:13:43.725 --> 00:13:46.393 position:27% line:83% align:start
What, seriously?
You and our boss?

00:13:46.427 --> 00:13:47.861 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mm-hmm.

00:13:47.895 --> 00:13:50.164 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hey, there's some twerp
here to see the boss.

00:13:50.197 --> 00:13:51.899 position:7% line:89% align:start
Does he have any appointments?

00:13:53.233 --> 00:13:54.335 position:33% line:89% align:start
My goodness!

00:13:54.368 --> 00:13:56.738 position:13% line:83% align:start
You should've just told me
that in the first place!

00:13:56.771 --> 00:13:57.938 position:13% line:89% align:start
I would've let you right in

00:13:57.971 --> 00:14:00.441 position:21% line:83% align:start
if I'd known you were
a friend of the boss!

00:14:00.474 --> 00:14:03.010 position:16% line:89% align:start
Two VIPs coming through!

00:14:03.043 --> 00:14:04.912 position:21% line:83% align:start
He's totally mocking
me, isn't he?

00:14:04.945 --> 00:14:06.614 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh no, of course not.

00:14:10.217 --> 00:14:12.286 position:5% line:89% align:start
Your hand is shaking, Takemichi.

00:14:12.319 --> 00:14:13.854 position:27% line:89% align:start
Are you alright?

00:14:13.887 --> 00:14:15.322 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I'm not scared.

00:14:16.725 --> 00:14:17.858 position:30% line:89% align:start
It'll be okay.

00:14:17.891 --> 00:14:19.694 position:24% line:83% align:start
No matter how
different he looks,

00:14:19.728 --> 00:14:22.496 position:21% line:83% align:start
no matter how
important he is now,

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:24.198 position:21% line:89% align:start
Akkun is still Akkun!

00:14:24.231 --> 00:14:25.232 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah?

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:27.000 position:35% line:89% align:start
Takemichi.

00:14:28.837 --> 00:14:30.337 position:24% line:89% align:start
Behind you, genius.

00:14:34.709 --> 00:14:37.044 position:24% line:83% align:start
You haven't changed
a bit, Takemichi.

00:14:39.346 --> 00:14:40.147 position:41% line:89% align:start
Akkun?

00:14:41.482 --> 00:14:44.318 position:13% line:83% align:start
What, you didn't recognize
me without my pompadour?

00:14:44.351 --> 00:14:45.953 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uh, no.

00:14:45.986 --> 00:14:47.822 position:16% line:83% align:start
I know I probably should
have said something

00:14:47.856 --> 00:14:51.024 position:19% line:83% align:start
to you earlier, but
it's been a while, huh?

00:14:52.493 --> 00:14:54.161 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] It's Akkun!

00:14:54.194 --> 00:14:56.664 position:7% line:83% align:start
He may look totally different,
but it's definitely Akkun!

00:14:58.165 --> 00:15:00.000 position:10% line:89% align:start
So you wanna see Mikey, huh?

00:15:00.968 --> 00:15:03.571 position:21% line:83% align:start
You know, I've been
waiting all this time

00:15:03.605 --> 00:15:06.574 position:7% line:89% align:start
for you to show up, Takemichi.

00:15:06.608 --> 00:15:08.610 position:19% line:89% align:start
Wait, what do you mean?

00:15:10.444 --> 00:15:11.912 position:19% line:89% align:start
Let's go talk outside.

00:15:14.616 --> 00:15:16.950 position:7% line:89% align:start
Just the two of us, all right?

00:15:18.952 --> 00:15:20.954 position:21% line:89% align:start
Okay, I'll wait here.

00:15:22.557 --> 00:15:25.259 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Be careful.
-I will.

00:15:25.292 --> 00:15:27.562 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hey, there's nothing
to worry about.

00:15:35.402 --> 00:15:36.370 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:15:36.403 --> 00:15:38.606 position:16% line:83% align:start
So how the hell have you
been doing, Takemichi?

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:41.175 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hey, take it easy! That
kinda hurts, Akkun!

00:15:41.208 --> 00:15:44.546 position:13% line:83% align:start
(laughs) I'm just so happy
to see you after so long!

00:15:44.579 --> 00:15:46.079 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's been years, buddy!

00:15:47.849 --> 00:15:50.284 position:16% line:83% align:start
And just at that crucial
moment Yamagishi-

00:15:50.317 --> 00:15:52.186 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] He farted and
ruined everything, right?

00:15:52.219 --> 00:15:55.155 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Akkun] Yeah, when I was
lookin' so awesome, too!

00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:58.325 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] (laughs)
Akkun, you were so lame!

00:15:59.661 --> 00:16:01.094 position:24% line:89% align:start
Been a while, huh?

00:16:03.096 --> 00:16:05.700 position:19% line:83% align:start
For you, I figure it's
been about 10 years.

00:16:07.635 --> 00:16:10.638 position:19% line:89% align:start
(sighs) But wow, Akkun!

00:16:10.672 --> 00:16:12.973 position:27% line:83% align:start
You own this cool
lounge up here,

00:16:13.006 --> 00:16:15.409 position:10% line:89% align:start
and you're a Toman big shot!

00:16:15.442 --> 00:16:16.611 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:16:16.644 --> 00:16:19.480 position:19% line:83% align:start
You've got a luxury
car, expensive clothes,

00:16:19.514 --> 00:16:21.649 position:19% line:83% align:start
and you're sleeping
with some fine ladies.

00:16:21.683 --> 00:16:23.952 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're basically on a
different planet than me.

00:16:23.984 --> 00:16:26.987 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Akkun] Yeah, well, money
can't buy you everything.

00:16:28.188 --> 00:16:30.592 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] I hope I can say
something like that someday!

00:16:30.625 --> 00:16:33.460 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Akkun] So that guy you came
here with is a cop, right?

00:16:33.494 --> 00:16:36.163 position:30% line:89% align:start
Ah! Um, I uh...

00:16:36.196 --> 00:16:39.099 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Akkun] You don't have to
lie. It's completely obvious.

00:16:40.367 --> 00:16:42.937 position:13% line:83% align:start
He's Hinata Tachibana's
younger brother, isn't he?

00:16:42.971 --> 00:16:45.138 position:24% line:83% align:start
I had no idea she
even had a brother.

00:16:46.774 --> 00:16:49.243 position:7% line:89% align:start
But how'd you figure that out?

00:16:51.211 --> 00:16:53.548 position:10% line:89% align:start
The Tokyo Manji organization,

00:16:53.581 --> 00:16:55.148 position:16% line:89% align:start
they have their methods.

00:16:57.384 --> 00:16:58.853 position:7% line:89% align:start
Hey, do you remember the summer

00:16:58.887 --> 00:17:00.855 position:24% line:83% align:start
of our second year
in middle school?

00:17:00.889 --> 00:17:02.624 position:5% line:89% align:start
The day you faced down Kiyomasa?

00:17:04.291 --> 00:17:07.862 position:10% line:83% align:start
After everyone went home, you
asked me this one question:

00:17:07.896 --> 00:17:10.163 position:5% line:89% align:start
what would we have to talk about

00:17:10.197 --> 00:17:12.800 position:21% line:83% align:start
after we'd all gone
off our separate ways

00:17:12.834 --> 00:17:14.536 position:5% line:89% align:start
and then met up again as adults?

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:18.205 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yeah! I remember that.

00:17:19.206 --> 00:17:21.074 position:24% line:83% align:start
Well, how about we
talk about this?

00:17:22.944 --> 00:17:25.045 position:21% line:83% align:start
The person who pushed
you onto the tracks

00:17:26.581 --> 00:17:27.582 position:41% line:89% align:start
was me.

00:17:33.922 --> 00:17:35.122 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:17:35.723 --> 00:17:37.224 position:16% line:89% align:start
It should've killed you,

00:17:38.793 --> 00:17:40.662 position:10% line:89% align:start
but someone saved your life.

00:17:41.829 --> 00:17:43.430 position:19% line:89% align:start
It was Naoto Tachibana,

00:17:44.331 --> 00:17:45.967 position:13% line:89% align:start
and it looked like he knew

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.669 position:24% line:83% align:start
you were gonna fall
onto the tracks,

00:17:47.702 --> 00:17:48.803 position:16% line:89% align:start
even before it happened!

00:17:49.771 --> 00:17:51.338 position:13% line:89% align:start
I know this sounds insane,

00:17:52.372 --> 00:17:53.808 position:38% line:89% align:start
but you,

00:17:53.841 --> 00:17:56.143 position:7% line:89% align:start
you can time travel, can't you?

00:17:57.344 --> 00:18:00.615 position:7% line:83% align:start
Didn't you ask Naoto Tachibana
from the past to help you?

00:18:00.648 --> 00:18:01.983 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's it, right?

00:18:02.016 --> 00:18:03.751 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's the only explanation
that makes sense!

00:18:03.785 --> 00:18:04.986 position:13% line:89% align:start
There's no way he saves you

00:18:05.019 --> 00:18:07.555 position:21% line:83% align:start
without knowing that
was gonna go down!

00:18:07.589 --> 00:18:10.058 position:16% line:83% align:start
But that's insane,
right? I mean, isn't it?

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:11.224 position:44% line:89% align:start
Stop!

00:18:11.258 --> 00:18:12.927 position:27% line:83% align:start
What the hell are
you talking about?

00:18:12.961 --> 00:18:14.896 position:5% line:89% align:start
Who's the crazy one here, Akkun?

00:18:14.929 --> 00:18:17.264 position:5% line:89% align:start
I don't even recognize you, man!

00:18:17.297 --> 00:18:20.300 position:16% line:83% align:start
You were always so cool,
calm and collected.

00:18:21.468 --> 00:18:23.538 position:19% line:83% align:start
You were always willing
to sacrifice yourself

00:18:23.571 --> 00:18:25.073 position:27% line:89% align:start
for your friends.

00:18:25.105 --> 00:18:28.543 position:24% line:83% align:start
You were kind. We
could count on you!

00:18:28.576 --> 00:18:31.144 position:33% line:89% align:start
(sobs) So...

00:18:32.947 --> 00:18:34.414 position:24% line:89% align:start
it has to be a lie!

00:18:35.817 --> 00:18:38.553 position:13% line:83% align:start
I can't believe you would
ever have tried to kill me!

00:18:38.586 --> 00:18:42.289 position:27% line:83% align:start
You're my friend,
Akkun! (sobbing)

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:49.831 position:35% line:89% align:start
Takemichi.

00:18:51.365 --> 00:18:55.503 position:10% line:83% align:start
I don't know how things could
have ended up like this.

00:18:55.536 --> 00:18:56.336 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Huh?

00:18:57.437 --> 00:19:00.608 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Akkun] I'm one of
Kisaki's soldiers now.

00:19:00.642 --> 00:19:03.143 position:21% line:89% align:start
Kisaki? Tetta Kisaki?

00:19:03.176 --> 00:19:05.613 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Akkun] Everyone in
Toman has to obey Kisaki.

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:09.149 position:24% line:83% align:start
I haven't even seen
Mikey in years.

00:19:11.418 --> 00:19:12.219 position:41% line:89% align:start
Akkun,

00:19:13.121 --> 00:19:15.023 position:10% line:89% align:start
it's not too late to get out.

00:19:15.056 --> 00:19:17.792 position:21% line:83% align:start
Just tell them you're
quitting Toman.

00:19:17.825 --> 00:19:19.393 position:21% line:89% align:start
(sobbing) I, I can't.

00:19:21.062 --> 00:19:22.295 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm scared.

00:19:23.296 --> 00:19:24.766 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm terrified of Kisaki!

00:19:26.601 --> 00:19:27.401 position:41% line:89% align:start
Akkun.

00:19:32.974 --> 00:19:34.174 position:35% line:89% align:start
Takemichi,

00:19:36.176 --> 00:19:39.379 position:16% line:83% align:start
Mikey was just never the
same after Draken died.

00:19:39.413 --> 00:19:40.715 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:19:40.748 --> 00:19:42.215 position:24% line:89% align:start
Draken is dead now?

00:19:43.216 --> 00:19:44.886 position:13% line:89% align:start
He wasn't supposed to die.

00:19:46.587 --> 00:19:49.524 position:10% line:83% align:start
It never should've happened,
but he bit it just the same.

00:19:49.557 --> 00:19:52.392 position:13% line:83% align:start
And now here I am, thriving
off of dirty money.

00:19:53.493 --> 00:19:56.296 position:7% line:89% align:start
Ah, I always looked up to you.

00:19:56.329 --> 00:19:58.231 position:24% line:83% align:start
You'd cry but still
hold your ground.

00:19:59.433 --> 00:20:00.233 position:41% line:89% align:start
Akkun.

00:20:01.502 --> 00:20:05.205 position:16% line:83% align:start
Is the reason that you
wanna go back to the past

00:20:05.238 --> 00:20:06.541 position:33% line:89% align:start
to save him?

00:20:06.574 --> 00:20:09.242 position:24% line:83% align:start
Come down from
there. You'll fall.

00:20:10.712 --> 00:20:14.182 position:16% line:83% align:start
Now see? That's real love
right there! (chuckling)

00:20:14.214 --> 00:20:15.850 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm rooting for you, Takemichi.

00:20:19.187 --> 00:20:21.556 position:16% line:89% align:start
Save everyone if you can.

00:20:21.589 --> 00:20:22.590 position:41% line:89% align:start
Akkun!

00:20:23.356 --> 00:20:25.026 position:27% line:89% align:start
Our crybaby hero.

00:20:25.059 --> 00:20:26.828 position:19% line:89% align:start
No, don't do it, Akkun!

00:20:26.861 --> 00:20:27.862 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:20:29.362 --> 00:20:32.066 position:27% line:89% align:start
(pavement thuds)

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:35.937 position:10% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi heavily breathing)

00:21:06.134 --> 00:21:10.270 position:7% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi screaming violently)

00:21:16.978 --> 00:21:17.979 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm.

00:21:24.786 --> 00:21:26.220 position:24% line:89% align:start
If you don't mind,

00:21:26.254 --> 00:21:29.090 position:16% line:83% align:start
could you just let him
have a little more time?

00:21:29.123 --> 00:21:30.457 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] It's fine.

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:32.794 position:13% line:83% align:start
I know they need to talk
to me about what happened.

00:21:38.566 --> 00:21:40.367 position:13% line:89% align:start
Please don't push yourself.

00:21:41.169 --> 00:21:42.402 position:16% line:89% align:start
You should take it slow.

00:21:43.871 --> 00:21:45.006 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Naoto,

00:21:45.039 --> 00:21:47.842 position:10% line:83% align:start
I need you to find out about
the day Ken Ryuguji died.

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:50.645 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:21:50.678 --> 00:21:54.749 position:16% line:83% align:start
The one who turned Toman
evil is Tetta Kisaki.
