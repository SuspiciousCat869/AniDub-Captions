(car engine roaring)

00:00:12.714 --> 00:00:14.616 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why don't we take a little walk?

00:00:14.649 --> 00:00:15.617 position:33% line:89% align:start
Is that okay?

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:16.851 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh, sure.

00:00:16.885 --> 00:00:18.553 position:35% line:89% align:start
(chuckles)

00:00:18.586 --> 00:00:20.320 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:00:20.354 --> 00:00:22.557 position:7% line:89% align:start
I haven't been here in forever.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.390 position:27% line:89% align:start
Always liked it.

00:00:24.324 --> 00:00:26.694 position:5% line:89% align:start
I came here with someone I love.

00:00:26.728 --> 00:00:28.663 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, yeah.

00:00:28.696 --> 00:00:29.998 position:27% line:89% align:start
On Christmas Eve.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.398 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gulps)

00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:33.668 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:00:36.938 --> 00:00:40.274 position:19% line:83% align:start
Even now, I still
can't forget about him.

00:00:40.307 --> 00:00:41.308 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:44.077 position:21% line:89% align:start
Why did I get dumped?

00:00:44.111 --> 00:00:46.480 position:16% line:89% align:start
I still don't understand.

00:00:46.514 --> 00:00:49.116 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:51.485 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hold on a sec! I've
gotta go the bathroom!

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:55.055 position:24% line:89% align:start
(footsteps tapping)

00:00:55.088 --> 00:00:58.058 position:27% line:89% align:start
(water splashing)

00:00:58.091 --> 00:00:59.092 position:30% line:89% align:start
I gotta change.

00:01:01.796 --> 00:01:03.565 position:13% line:89% align:start
So I'm gonna ask Hina out.

00:01:03.598 --> 00:01:05.465 position:24% line:89% align:start
(footsteps tapping)

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:06.501 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:01:06.534 --> 00:01:07.502 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:01:07.535 --> 00:01:09.671 position:21% line:83% align:start
You were supposed to
have been in the car.

00:01:09.704 --> 00:01:12.072 position:21% line:89% align:start
(car engine roaring)

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:14.676 position:41% line:89% align:start
(pants)

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:15.710 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hina no!

00:01:16.544 --> 00:01:19.914 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hina!

00:01:19.948 --> 00:01:22.717 position:19% line:89% align:start
Takemichi? Is that you?

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:23.751 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:01:25.252 --> 00:01:28.388 position:13% line:83% align:start
It ruins everything, if
you aren't inside the car.

00:01:29.891 --> 00:01:31.458 position:41% line:89% align:start
Akkun!

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:33.761 position:33% line:89% align:start
(eerie music)

00:01:33.795 --> 00:01:35.029 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hina!

00:01:35.063 --> 00:01:37.464 position:21% line:83% align:start
Come on! We've gotta
get outta here.

00:01:37.497 --> 00:01:39.934 position:21% line:83% align:start
I can't feel my legs
anymore Takemichi.

00:01:39.968 --> 00:01:42.770 position:24% line:89% align:start
I can't move them.

00:01:43.037 --> 00:01:45.006 position:41% line:89% align:start
(boom)

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:47.474 position:33% line:89% align:start
(eerie music)

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.550 position:38% line:89% align:start
(groans)

00:01:56.517 --> 00:02:00.888 position:41% line:89% align:start
(cries)

00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:09.162 position:33% line:89% align:start
(eerie music)

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.199 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm still going
to save you, Hina!

00:02:12.232 --> 00:02:14.102 position:7% line:89% align:start
No matter how many times I fail

00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:16.303 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll keep trying
over and over again.

00:02:16.336 --> 00:02:19.073 position:13% line:83% align:start
Until I reach the future
where you're finally safe.

00:02:19.107 --> 00:02:21.509 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm never going to quit trying!

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.454 position:41% line:89% align:start
(sobs)

00:02:39.627 --> 00:02:40.494 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hina.

00:02:40.528 --> 00:02:42.229 position:41% line:89% align:start
(sobs)

00:02:42.262 --> 00:02:44.899 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm so sorry for your loss.

00:02:44.932 --> 00:02:46.768 position:41% line:89% align:start
(sobs)

00:02:53.641 --> 00:02:55.576 position:38% line:89% align:start
(grunts)

00:02:56.711 --> 00:02:58.345 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hi Takemichi.

00:02:58.378 --> 00:03:01.015 position:21% line:83% align:start
Still showing up
without any warning.

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:02.249 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hina!

00:03:05.053 --> 00:03:06.654 position:24% line:89% align:start
(breathes heavily)

00:03:06.688 --> 00:03:07.955 position:35% line:89% align:start
I love you.

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.390 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:03:52.934 --> 00:03:56.137 position:24% line:89% align:start
(footsteps tapping)

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.839 position:24% line:89% align:start
Uh, you all right?

00:04:00.273 --> 00:04:02.409 position:13% line:89% align:start
I understand how you feel,

00:04:02.442 --> 00:04:05.513 position:13% line:83% align:start
but there are other people
who are, you know, waiting.

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:09.584 position:38% line:89% align:start
So, uh...

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:12.920 position:19% line:89% align:start
Hey, are you all right?

00:04:12.954 --> 00:04:14.287 position:13% line:89% align:start
Maybe you should sit down.

00:04:19.994 --> 00:04:22.563 position:13% line:89% align:start
Look, can you even hear me?

00:04:26.934 --> 00:04:28.903 position:41% line:89% align:start
(sobs)

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.942 position:41% line:89% align:start
(cries)

00:04:47.922 --> 00:04:49.489 position:19% line:89% align:start
Why is this happening?

00:04:50.658 --> 00:04:52.794 position:27% line:83% align:start
Everything should
have worked out.

00:04:52.827 --> 00:04:53.861 position:41% line:89% align:start
(sobs)

00:04:53.895 --> 00:04:54.896 position:41% line:89% align:start
Naoto.

00:04:56.764 --> 00:04:58.498 position:35% line:89% align:start
My sister.

00:04:58.533 --> 00:05:00.902 position:41% line:89% align:start
(sobs)

00:05:00.935 --> 00:05:03.738 position:24% line:89% align:start
(crickets chirping)

00:05:06.974 --> 00:05:09.143 position:24% line:89% align:start
Takemichi Hanagaki?

00:05:09.177 --> 00:05:10.812 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:05:10.845 --> 00:05:12.613 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm Hinata's mother.

00:05:13.514 --> 00:05:14.515 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's been a while.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:16.918 position:41% line:89% align:start
Naoto?

00:05:16.951 --> 00:05:18.485 position:30% line:89% align:start
He's all right.

00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:20.655 position:21% line:89% align:start
He's calmed down now.

00:05:20.688 --> 00:05:22.290 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, I see.

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:23.323 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's good.

00:05:25.193 --> 00:05:26.493 position:27% line:89% align:start
Please take this.

00:05:26.527 --> 00:05:28.830 position:24% line:89% align:start
(crickets chirping)

00:05:28.863 --> 00:05:30.298 position:33% line:89% align:start
It's for me?

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.432 position:24% line:89% align:start
(crickets chirping)

00:05:32.465 --> 00:05:33.634 position:30% line:89% align:start
Go on, open it.

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.707 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.042 position:30% line:89% align:start
But this is...

00:05:41.075 --> 00:05:43.376 position:10% line:89% align:start
She seemed to really love it.

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.215 position:16% line:83% align:start
I know she always kept it
very close to her heart.

00:05:47.248 --> 00:05:48.950 position:7% line:89% align:start
You gave it to her, didn't you?

00:05:49.884 --> 00:05:52.485 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:57.424 position:41% line:89% align:start
(sobs)

00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:06.868 position:24% line:83% align:start
She must have loved
you very much.

00:06:06.901 --> 00:06:09.537 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:06:13.608 --> 00:06:14.407 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hina.

00:06:17.211 --> 00:06:22.415 position:21% line:89% align:start
(opening theme music)

00:07:51.038 --> 00:07:53.541 position:19% line:5% align:start
I did a bit of research
on Atsushi Sendo.

00:07:54.742 --> 00:07:57.845 position:16% line:83% align:start
In this timeline, he was
married and had a child.

00:07:57.878 --> 00:07:59.513 position:10% line:89% align:start
Then that doesn't make sense!

00:08:00.681 --> 00:08:02.850 position:19% line:83% align:start
Why would someone that
has a family do that?

00:08:04.251 --> 00:08:07.254 position:13% line:83% align:start
His wife and his child,
they've both gone missing.

00:08:07.288 --> 00:08:08.589 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:08:08.622 --> 00:08:11.258 position:19% line:83% align:start
My guess is that they
took his family hostage

00:08:11.292 --> 00:08:12.492 position:24% line:89% align:start
and threatened him.

00:08:14.562 --> 00:08:17.264 position:19% line:83% align:start
Did Sendo say anything
to you, before he died?

00:08:17.298 --> 00:08:18.299 position:33% line:89% align:start
(slow music)

00:08:18.332 --> 00:08:21.535 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yeah, actually he did.

00:08:21.569 --> 00:08:24.805 position:19% line:83% align:start
He said he had to do
whatever Toman wanted.

00:08:24.839 --> 00:08:26.674 position:41% line:89% align:start
(sighs)

00:08:26.707 --> 00:08:28.976 position:13% line:89% align:start
So it's Toman, once again.

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:29.977 position:33% line:89% align:start
(slow music)

00:08:30.011 --> 00:08:31.345 position:21% line:89% align:start
Come to think of it,

00:08:31.379 --> 00:08:34.815 position:13% line:89% align:start
what was Hanma doing there?

00:08:34.849 --> 00:08:35.649 position:38% line:89% align:start
Useless!

00:08:37.018 --> 00:08:38.719 position:24% line:83% align:start
We weren't able to
change anything.

00:08:39.887 --> 00:08:41.822 position:27% line:83% align:start
Everything we did
was for nothing!

00:08:43.691 --> 00:08:45.326 position:16% line:89% align:start
We couldn't change fate.

00:08:45.359 --> 00:08:47.695 position:33% line:89% align:start
(slow music)

00:08:51.732 --> 00:08:53.567 position:19% line:89% align:start
That's not true, Naoto.

00:08:56.737 --> 00:08:59.974 position:10% line:83% align:start
The reason our saving Draken
didn't change anything,

00:09:00.007 --> 00:09:04.478 position:10% line:83% align:start
is because his death wasn't
the reason Toman became evil.

00:09:04.513 --> 00:09:07.648 position:21% line:83% align:start
When Hina died right
in front of me,

00:09:07.681 --> 00:09:10.751 position:16% line:83% align:start
I realized something as I
watched the flames rise.

00:09:10.785 --> 00:09:12.686 position:10% line:89% align:start
We have to attack the source.

00:09:13.954 --> 00:09:15.489 position:35% line:89% align:start
The source?

00:09:15.524 --> 00:09:17.925 position:27% line:89% align:start
Take down Toman!

00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:21.128 position:10% line:83% align:start
It can happen if I become the
head of Toman in the past.

00:09:22.531 --> 00:09:23.798 position:35% line:89% align:start
(chuckles)

00:09:23.831 --> 00:09:25.933 position:13% line:83% align:start
You know you really had me
going there for a second.

00:09:25.966 --> 00:09:27.435 position:33% line:89% align:start
I'm serious!

00:09:27.468 --> 00:09:29.103 position:27% line:83% align:start
Come on, you know
that's impossible.

00:09:29.136 --> 00:09:30.604 position:21% line:89% align:start
That doesn't matter!

00:09:30.638 --> 00:09:33.441 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll do the impossible if
it means I can save Hina.

00:09:33.474 --> 00:09:36.610 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:09:36.644 --> 00:09:38.279 position:35% line:89% align:start
(chuckles)

00:09:38.312 --> 00:09:40.748 position:21% line:83% align:start
That is one stupidly
insane idea.

00:09:41.615 --> 00:09:42.616 position:35% line:89% align:start
Thank you,

00:09:43.951 --> 00:09:45.052 position:35% line:89% align:start
Takemichi.

00:09:46.587 --> 00:09:48.589 position:33% line:89% align:start
(slow music)

00:09:48.622 --> 00:09:51.692 position:19% line:83% align:start
Now I feel foolish for
getting all depressed.

00:09:51.725 --> 00:09:52.927 position:21% line:89% align:start
You're such an idiot.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.628 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:09:54.662 --> 00:09:57.131 position:13% line:83% align:start
Hey, why do you always have
to add something snarky?

00:09:57.164 --> 00:09:58.599 position:33% line:89% align:start
(slow music)

00:09:58.632 --> 00:10:00.601 position:19% line:83% align:start
What I don't understand
is why this happened

00:10:00.634 --> 00:10:02.069 position:10% line:89% align:start
even though we saved Draken.

00:10:03.771 --> 00:10:06.207 position:13% line:83% align:start
I mean, if Mikey and Draken
were still working together,

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.543 position:21% line:83% align:start
Kisaki shouldn't have
been able to butt in.

00:10:08.577 --> 00:10:10.444 position:21% line:83% align:start
There's no way Toman
could become evil

00:10:10.478 --> 00:10:12.446 position:10% line:89% align:start
while Draken was still alive.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.583 position:33% line:89% align:start
(slow music)

00:10:14.615 --> 00:10:16.717 position:10% line:89% align:start
It might be worth our while,

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:18.686 position:13% line:89% align:start
to pay a visit to Ryuguji.

00:10:27.294 --> 00:10:29.830 position:30% line:89% align:start
(upbeat music)

00:11:39.099 --> 00:11:41.802 position:27% line:89% align:start
(birds chirping)

00:11:45.339 --> 00:11:46.373 position:13% line:89% align:start
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:11:46.407 --> 00:11:47.808 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ooh!

00:11:47.841 --> 00:11:50.277 position:13% line:83% align:start
I got worried when I didn't
hear anything back from you.

00:11:50.311 --> 00:11:51.879 position:33% line:89% align:start
I apologize.

00:11:51.912 --> 00:11:55.249 position:16% line:83% align:start
Anyway, is there a reason
you wanted to meet here?

00:12:01.422 --> 00:12:03.157 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Officer] Number 248!

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:05.926 position:33% line:89% align:start
(door creaks)

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.194 position:13% line:89% align:start
Someone's here to see you.

00:12:09.263 --> 00:12:10.699 position:21% line:89% align:start
I did some research.

00:12:10.731 --> 00:12:12.900 position:19% line:83% align:start
There was no record of
Ken Ryuguji's death,

00:12:12.933 --> 00:12:16.837 position:10% line:83% align:start
but I discovered he wasn't
part of Toman anymore either.

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:19.273 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's no wonder it took
a while to find him.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:21.108 position:30% line:89% align:start
(upbeat music)

00:12:21.141 --> 00:12:23.444 position:33% line:89% align:start
(door creaks)

00:12:24.945 --> 00:12:28.683 position:13% line:83% align:start
The fact is, Ken Ryuguji
is currently on death row.

00:12:28.717 --> 00:12:30.284 position:33% line:89% align:start
(door slums)

00:12:30.317 --> 00:12:32.920 position:30% line:89% align:start
(upbeat music)

00:12:37.992 --> 00:12:40.027 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's been a while, Takemichi.

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:44.164 position:21% line:89% align:start
You're looking well.

00:12:44.198 --> 00:12:45.833 position:30% line:89% align:start
(upbeat music)

00:12:45.866 --> 00:12:46.867 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh, man, Draken!

00:12:54.174 --> 00:12:58.345 position:5% line:89% align:start
So tell me Draken, are you okay?

00:12:58.379 --> 00:12:59.313 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I guess.

00:13:01.549 --> 00:13:03.384 position:27% line:89% align:start
Naoto Tachibana.

00:13:03.417 --> 00:13:04.885 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's a pleasure to meet you.

00:13:04.918 --> 00:13:07.488 position:16% line:83% align:start
Aah, he's the reason I
was able to to visit you.

00:13:12.026 --> 00:13:13.460 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:13:13.494 --> 00:13:15.462 position:21% line:89% align:start
So, what do you need?

00:13:15.496 --> 00:13:18.600 position:13% line:89% align:start
Well, I guess for starters,

00:13:18.633 --> 00:13:21.468 position:27% line:83% align:start
I had no idea you
were on death row.

00:13:21.503 --> 00:13:23.672 position:7% line:89% align:start
What the hell happened to you?

00:13:23.705 --> 00:13:25.939 position:19% line:83% align:start
Whatever could've made
you murder someone?

00:13:25.973 --> 00:13:27.341 position:13% line:89% align:start
And what happened to Toman?

00:13:28.342 --> 00:13:29.744 position:41% line:89% align:start
(sighs)

00:13:29.778 --> 00:13:34.148 position:16% line:83% align:start
Takemichi, I have no
regrets about what I did.

00:13:35.482 --> 00:13:37.418 position:16% line:89% align:start
I deserve to be in here.

00:13:39.621 --> 00:13:43.090 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's my fault that Toman
changed and ended up like this.

00:13:44.358 --> 00:13:46.860 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's my fault because
I couldn't stop him.

00:13:47.729 --> 00:13:48.929 position:27% line:89% align:start
Who do you mean?

00:13:50.364 --> 00:13:51.999 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:13:52.032 --> 00:13:55.570 position:19% line:83% align:start
Toman, it was great
back when we were kids.

00:13:57.037 --> 00:13:59.741 position:13% line:83% align:start
We did everything we could
to make our team bigger.

00:13:59.774 --> 00:14:01.710 position:13% line:89% align:start
All we ever did was fight,

00:14:01.743 --> 00:14:03.444 position:27% line:83% align:start
and it was like a
party every day.

00:14:04.646 --> 00:14:06.847 position:13% line:89% align:start
Toman was everything to me.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.949 position:24% line:83% align:start
Even if I could do
it all over again,

00:14:08.982 --> 00:14:11.385 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'd still choose to live
my life the same way.

00:14:12.721 --> 00:14:13.887 position:27% line:89% align:start
No regrets here.

00:14:14.855 --> 00:14:16.524 position:27% line:83% align:start
After everything
that's happened,

00:14:16.558 --> 00:14:18.325 position:19% line:89% align:start
Draken is still Draken.

00:14:18.359 --> 00:14:19.360 position:24% line:89% align:start
He hasn't changed.

00:14:19.393 --> 00:14:21.495 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:14:21.529 --> 00:14:22.564 position:27% line:89% align:start
But then again...

00:14:23.565 --> 00:14:24.566 position:35% line:89% align:start
What is it?

00:14:25.899 --> 00:14:29.303 position:24% line:83% align:start
If I could actually
relive my life,

00:14:29.336 --> 00:14:32.039 position:21% line:83% align:start
there is one thing I
would do differently.

00:14:35.844 --> 00:14:37.712 position:21% line:89% align:start
I would kill Kisaki!

00:14:37.746 --> 00:14:39.947 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:14:41.281 --> 00:14:43.317 position:33% line:89% align:start
Tetta Kisaki?

00:14:44.586 --> 00:14:45.553 position:16% line:89% align:start
You mean Kisaki is the--

00:14:45.587 --> 00:14:48.088 position:30% line:89% align:start
(alarm buzzes)

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:51.158 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Officer] Time's up.

00:14:53.927 --> 00:14:55.597 position:33% line:89% align:start
But Draken...

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:57.164 position:33% line:89% align:start
(slow music)

00:14:57.197 --> 00:14:57.998 position:35% line:89% align:start
Takemichi.

00:14:59.601 --> 00:15:01.301 position:13% line:89% align:start
Get yourself out of Tokyo.

00:15:01.335 --> 00:15:02.637 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:04.773 position:10% line:89% align:start
Didn't you almost get killed?

00:15:04.806 --> 00:15:06.440 position:10% line:89% align:start
Isn't that why you came here?

00:15:07.642 --> 00:15:09.243 position:16% line:89% align:start
For Kisaki, killing a man

00:15:09.276 --> 00:15:11.513 position:21% line:83% align:start
is no different than
squashing a bug.

00:15:11.546 --> 00:15:13.414 position:33% line:89% align:start
Draken, wait!

00:15:13.447 --> 00:15:15.850 position:16% line:83% align:start
Tell me, why is somebody
trying to kill me?

00:15:15.884 --> 00:15:17.418 position:41% line:89% align:start
Draken!

00:15:17.451 --> 00:15:20.053 position:33% line:89% align:start
(eerie music)

00:15:20.087 --> 00:15:23.792 position:24% line:83% align:start
At one time Kisaki
idolized Mikey,

00:15:23.825 --> 00:15:26.761 position:24% line:83% align:start
but eventually that
turned into hatred.

00:15:26.795 --> 00:15:29.229 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:15:29.263 --> 00:15:30.063 position:35% line:89% align:start
And so now,

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:34.034 position:5% line:89% align:start
he wants to take away everything

00:15:34.067 --> 00:15:36.403 position:19% line:89% align:start
that Mikey holds dear.

00:15:36.437 --> 00:15:37.404 position:41% line:89% align:start
Kisaki.

00:15:37.438 --> 00:15:39.273 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:15:39.306 --> 00:15:40.307 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mikey.

00:15:42.342 --> 00:15:44.478 position:33% line:89% align:start
(door slams)

00:15:44.512 --> 00:15:47.481 position:24% line:89% align:start
(footsteps tapping)

00:16:06.901 --> 00:16:10.037 position:24% line:89% align:start
(footsteps tapping)

00:16:20.949 --> 00:16:22.015 position:33% line:89% align:start
Well, Draken,

00:16:26.153 --> 00:16:27.354 position:24% line:89% align:start
that was good work.

00:16:29.791 --> 00:16:30.991 position:41% line:89% align:start
Kisaki.

00:16:32.392 --> 00:16:35.128 position:33% line:89% align:start
(door slams)

00:16:35.162 --> 00:16:38.098 position:30% line:89% align:start
(bird chirping)

00:16:41.201 --> 00:16:43.771 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] I can't believe
Draken's on death row.

00:16:49.878 --> 00:16:51.713 position:21% line:89% align:start
I would kill Kisaki!

00:16:53.915 --> 00:16:56.751 position:21% line:83% align:start
So Naoto, who the
hell is this Kisaki?

00:16:56.784 --> 00:16:58.252 position:13% line:89% align:start
What do you know about him?

00:16:59.486 --> 00:17:01.088 position:33% line:89% align:start
Tetta Kisaki.

00:17:01.789 --> 00:17:03.023 position:13% line:89% align:start
He's one of the key figures

00:17:03.056 --> 00:17:04.926 position:24% line:83% align:start
in the Tokyo Manji
Gang right now.

00:17:04.959 --> 00:17:07.027 position:7% line:89% align:start
He's also the acting commander.

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:09.162 position:13% line:89% align:start
I think, he must be the one

00:17:09.196 --> 00:17:11.498 position:27% line:83% align:start
who keeps having
my sister killed.

00:17:11.533 --> 00:17:13.200 position:21% line:83% align:start
The police have done
everything possible

00:17:13.233 --> 00:17:16.370 position:13% line:83% align:start
to investigate him, but we
don't have a single lead.

00:17:20.073 --> 00:17:23.076 position:19% line:83% align:start
I've still never met
him, even in the past.

00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:25.345 position:19% line:83% align:start
And you say we have no
leads in the present.

00:17:27.749 --> 00:17:32.754 position:16% line:83% align:start
Naoto, the way I see it,
there's only one option.

00:17:34.354 --> 00:17:36.558 position:10% line:89% align:start
I've got to take over Toman!

00:17:36.591 --> 00:17:37.759 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:17:37.792 --> 00:17:40.127 position:10% line:89% align:start
You were serious about that?

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.630 position:19% line:83% align:start
Of course I was! Why
the hell wouldn't I be?

00:17:42.664 --> 00:17:45.900 position:7% line:83% align:start
If I become the head of Toman,
I'll be able to stop Kisaki.

00:17:45.934 --> 00:17:49.169 position:10% line:83% align:start
Then I can protect everyone,
like Draken, Mikey and Hina.

00:17:50.337 --> 00:17:52.607 position:19% line:83% align:start
This is how we're gonna
get at the source,

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:54.676 position:27% line:89% align:start
and take it down!

00:17:54.709 --> 00:17:55.810 position:19% line:89% align:start
I've thought about it.

00:17:55.843 --> 00:17:57.979 position:10% line:89% align:start
First, I'll become a captain.

00:17:58.012 --> 00:17:59.446 position:10% line:89% align:start
With Pah out of the picture,

00:17:59.479 --> 00:18:02.650 position:13% line:83% align:start
the 3rd Division Captain's
spot is open, so...

00:18:02.684 --> 00:18:03.785 position:27% line:89% align:start
now's my chance.

00:18:03.818 --> 00:18:06.821 position:33% line:89% align:start
(slow music)

00:18:06.854 --> 00:18:08.556 position:10% line:89% align:start
You know this idea is insane.

00:18:09.624 --> 00:18:11.291 position:33% line:89% align:start
Look, Naoto,

00:18:11.325 --> 00:18:13.895 position:13% line:83% align:start
as I see it, it's the only
alternative we've got.

00:18:13.928 --> 00:18:16.064 position:30% line:89% align:start
(upbeat music)

00:18:16.096 --> 00:18:17.097 position:27% line:89% align:start
All right, then.

00:18:18.098 --> 00:18:19.767 position:19% line:83% align:start
In spite of everything
that's happened,

00:18:19.801 --> 00:18:22.469 position:13% line:83% align:start
you've somehow managed to
succeed with every mission.

00:18:23.638 --> 00:18:24.606 position:19% line:89% align:start
So I'll believe in you.

00:18:24.639 --> 00:18:25.607 position:30% line:89% align:start
(upbeat music)

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:26.608 position:38% line:89% align:start
(grunts)

00:18:26.641 --> 00:18:28.610 position:30% line:89% align:start
(upbeat music)

00:18:28.643 --> 00:18:31.411 position:19% line:83% align:start
This trip is probably
going to be a long one.

00:18:31.445 --> 00:18:32.245 position:41% line:89% align:start
I know.

00:18:36.283 --> 00:18:38.185 position:7% line:89% align:start
Why did I end up dumping Hina?

00:18:39.453 --> 00:18:42.322 position:19% line:83% align:start
Why was Hanma at the
scene where Hina died?

00:18:43.457 --> 00:18:46.060 position:21% line:83% align:start
And how did Draken
wind up on death row?

00:18:46.094 --> 00:18:48.161 position:13% line:89% align:start
And finally, who's Kisaki?

00:18:48.195 --> 00:18:50.430 position:21% line:83% align:start
And how did he end up
hating Mikey so much?

00:18:51.331 --> 00:18:52.567 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's like a puzzle.

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.102 position:24% line:83% align:start
But I'm gonna
connect the pieces,

00:18:54.134 --> 00:18:56.269 position:21% line:83% align:start
and destroy anything
that gets in my way!

00:19:01.274 --> 00:19:03.678 position:10% line:89% align:start
Huh? Why is everything white?

00:19:06.014 --> 00:19:08.883 position:24% line:89% align:start
Huh? A public bath?

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:10.718 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:19:10.752 --> 00:19:11.519 position:30% line:89% align:start
(water bubbles)

00:19:11.552 --> 00:19:12.587 position:38% line:89% align:start
(shrieks)

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:14.088 position:38% line:89% align:start
(laughs)

00:19:14.122 --> 00:19:16.024 position:33% line:89% align:start
Whoa! Mikey?

00:19:16.057 --> 00:19:17.025 position:27% line:89% align:start
Did I scare you?

00:19:17.058 --> 00:19:18.893 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Draken] Hey! Shut up!

00:19:18.926 --> 00:19:20.094 position:35% line:89% align:start
[Both] Huh?

00:19:20.128 --> 00:19:22.262 position:27% line:83% align:start
Come on, you're
not kids anymore.

00:19:22.295 --> 00:19:24.766 position:16% line:83% align:start
Public baths aren't
meant for messing around.

00:19:24.799 --> 00:19:26.233 position:21% line:89% align:start
Wait, is that Draken?

00:19:26.266 --> 00:19:28.201 position:19% line:83% align:start
Like I'm gonna listen
to a third-year student

00:19:28.235 --> 00:19:30.738 position:7% line:89% align:start
who still wears a shampoo hat.

00:19:30.772 --> 00:19:32.239 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's hilarious.

00:19:32.272 --> 00:19:34.542 position:10% line:83% align:start
The big beanpole's afraid
of getting soap in his eyes.

00:19:34.575 --> 00:19:36.443 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Draken] I told you to shut up.

00:19:36.476 --> 00:19:38.146 position:38% line:89% align:start
(laughs)

00:19:38.178 --> 00:19:40.114 position:16% line:89% align:start
What the hell's going on!

00:19:40.148 --> 00:19:42.349 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm at a public bath
with Mikey and Draken?

00:19:44.686 --> 00:19:45.687 position:27% line:89% align:start
(water splashing)

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.689 position:24% line:89% align:start
I feel alive again.

00:19:47.722 --> 00:19:50.525 position:19% line:83% align:start
So Draken, your wounds
are all healed now?

00:19:50.558 --> 00:19:51.893 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:19:51.926 --> 00:19:53.995 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh, those? No,
they weren't shit.

00:19:54.028 --> 00:19:56.196 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's 'cause I work out.

00:19:56.229 --> 00:19:57.565 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, I see.

00:19:59.033 --> 00:20:00.233 position:41% line:89% align:start
Behold!

00:20:01.201 --> 00:20:03.236 position:24% line:83% align:start
Check out these
abs and this scar.

00:20:04.572 --> 00:20:05.540 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:20:05.573 --> 00:20:07.008 position:38% line:89% align:start
(giggles)

00:20:07.041 --> 00:20:09.677 position:13% line:83% align:start
You're a lot larger than
middle school kids, really.

00:20:09.711 --> 00:20:10.678 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yeah, right?

00:20:10.712 --> 00:20:13.213 position:38% line:89% align:start
Ooh, wow!

00:20:15.248 --> 00:20:17.151 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Draken grunts)

00:20:17.185 --> 00:20:18.886 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yeah, you're still
not completely healed.

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:20.655 position:16% line:89% align:start
Better not push yourself.

00:20:20.688 --> 00:20:23.223 position:21% line:83% align:start
What the hell kind of
cheap shot was that?

00:20:23.256 --> 00:20:24.692 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Mikey laughs)

00:20:24.726 --> 00:20:26.194 position:27% line:89% align:start
You little shit!

00:20:26.226 --> 00:20:28.696 position:16% line:83% align:start
It doesn't matter whether
I'm all healed or not!

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:30.064 position:35% line:89% align:start
Take that!

00:20:30.098 --> 00:20:32.100 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Mikey] Ow! What the hell man?

00:20:32.133 --> 00:20:34.234 position:21% line:83% align:start
Okay, now you're
really gonna get it!

00:20:34.267 --> 00:20:35.368 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Draken] Hey!

00:20:35.402 --> 00:20:37.171 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's my two in one
shampoo and conditioner!

00:20:37.205 --> 00:20:38.438 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Mikey] Oooh, fancy!

00:20:38.472 --> 00:20:40.141 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Draken] Don't, watch it,
you're gonna hit someone!

00:20:40.174 --> 00:20:41.976 position:19% line:83% align:start
-I'm gonna make it fly!
-Hey!

00:20:42.009 --> 00:20:44.011 position:38% line:89% align:start
(laughs)

00:20:55.189 --> 00:20:58.458 position:33% line:89% align:start
(both laugh)

00:20:58.492 --> 00:21:01.162 position:13% line:83% align:start
Takemichi, you've always
got something on your head,

00:21:01.195 --> 00:21:02.429 position:35% line:89% align:start
don't you?

00:21:02.462 --> 00:21:04.532 position:24% line:83% align:start
I remember! You had
shit on your head!

00:21:04.565 --> 00:21:05.332 position:38% line:89% align:start
(laughs)

00:21:05.365 --> 00:21:07.769 position:21% line:89% align:start
Way to go, Takemichi.

00:21:07.802 --> 00:21:10.071 position:19% line:83% align:start
And why don't you just
drop dead for once!

00:21:10.104 --> 00:21:11.973 position:27% line:89% align:start
(water splashes)

00:21:12.006 --> 00:21:15.375 position:27% line:83% align:start
There! How do you
like that, huh?

00:21:15.408 --> 00:21:17.879 position:21% line:83% align:start
Get off of me, you
big jerk, before I--

00:21:17.912 --> 00:21:20.081 position:13% line:83% align:start
You're the one who started
this shit, remember?

00:21:20.114 --> 00:21:21.082 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:21:21.115 --> 00:21:23.283 position:7% line:89% align:start
Things were so great back then.

00:21:24.786 --> 00:21:25.553 position:35% line:89% align:start
[Mikey] Ow!

00:21:25.586 --> 00:21:26.554 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Draken] Come here you!

00:21:26.587 --> 00:21:28.055 position:38% line:89% align:start
Get off!

00:21:28.089 --> 00:21:30.792 position:13% line:83% align:start
I really hope we never stop
having days like these.

00:21:30.825 --> 00:21:32.593 position:35% line:89% align:start
[Both] Huh?

00:21:32.627 --> 00:21:34.796 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:21:37.198 --> 00:21:38.866 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] Well,
time to get out.

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:40.968 position:27% line:89% align:start
(water splashes)

00:21:41.002 --> 00:21:43.538 position:30% line:89% align:start
(gulps loudly)

00:21:45.239 --> 00:21:46.908 position:38% line:89% align:start
Ahh, yes!

00:21:46.941 --> 00:21:48.142 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Draken] Let's go Takemichi.

00:21:48.176 --> 00:21:49.877 position:41% line:89% align:start
Aargh!

00:21:49.911 --> 00:21:51.679 position:30% line:89% align:start
Huh? Go where?

00:21:57.785 --> 00:22:00.387 position:30% line:89% align:start
(upbeat music)

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:03.524 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's finally happening.

00:22:07.995 --> 00:22:09.462 position:21% line:89% align:start
Takemichi, let's go.

00:22:11.364 --> 00:22:14.367 position:19% line:83% align:start
Got a new 3rd Division
Captain to welcome.

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:16.369 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:22:17.905 --> 00:22:20.340 position:21% line:89% align:start
(closing theme music)
