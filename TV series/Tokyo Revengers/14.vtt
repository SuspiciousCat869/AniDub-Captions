00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:09.376 position:30% line:89% align:start
Draken, I had,

00:00:10.845 --> 00:00:13.715 position:27% line:83% align:start
I had no idea you
were on death row.

00:00:13.748 --> 00:00:15.449 position:7% line:89% align:start
What the hell happened to you?

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:17.652 position:19% line:83% align:start
Whatever could've made
you murder someone?

00:00:18.753 --> 00:00:20.153 position:13% line:89% align:start
If I could relive my life,

00:00:20.187 --> 00:00:22.557 position:24% line:83% align:start
there's one thing
I'd do differently.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.660 position:13% line:89% align:start
(Draken angrily breathing)

00:00:25.693 --> 00:00:27.160 position:21% line:89% align:start
I would kill Kisaki!

00:00:28.495 --> 00:00:31.699 position:21% line:83% align:start
So Naoto, who the
hell is this Kisaki?

00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:33.200 position:19% line:89% align:start
You ever heard of him?

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:35.369 position:33% line:89% align:start
Tetta Kisaki.

00:00:36.236 --> 00:00:37.939 position:13% line:89% align:start
He's one of the key figures

00:00:37.972 --> 00:00:39.774 position:24% line:83% align:start
in the Tokyo Manji
Gang right now.

00:00:39.807 --> 00:00:41.876 position:7% line:89% align:start
He's also the acting commander.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.111 position:13% line:89% align:start
I think he must be the one

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:46.548 position:27% line:83% align:start
who keeps having
my sister killed.

00:00:46.581 --> 00:00:48.215 position:21% line:83% align:start
The police have done
everything possible

00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:51.318 position:13% line:83% align:start
to investigate him, but we
don't have a single lead.

00:00:56.456 --> 00:00:57.257 position:41% line:89% align:start
Naoto,

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.663 position:16% line:83% align:start
the way I see it,
there's only one option.

00:01:02.864 --> 00:01:05.299 position:10% line:89% align:start
I've got to take over Toman!

00:01:05.332 --> 00:01:08.503 position:7% line:83% align:start
If I become the head of Toman,
I'll be able to stop Kisaki.

00:01:08.536 --> 00:01:11.739 position:10% line:83% align:start
Then, I can protect everyone,
like Draken, Mikey, and Hina.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.610 position:19% line:83% align:start
This is how we're gonna
get at the source:

00:01:15.643 --> 00:01:16.443 position:33% line:89% align:start
take it down.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.583 position:27% line:83% align:start
All right, then.
I believe in you.

00:01:24.786 --> 00:01:26.721 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Good.

00:01:26.754 --> 00:01:29.757 position:19% line:89% align:start
(energetic rock music)

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:37.364 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's finally happening.

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:41.836 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Kawata chuckles)

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:43.538 position:21% line:89% align:start
Takemitchy, let's go.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.475 position:19% line:83% align:start
Got a new 3rd Division
Captain to welcome.

00:01:49.476 --> 00:01:50.477 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:01:52.714 --> 00:01:57.184 position:21% line:89% align:start
(opening theme music)

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.338 position:21% line:5% align:start
(motorcycles revving)

00:03:39.754 --> 00:03:42.623 position:24% line:89% align:start
(foreboding music)

00:03:49.296 --> 00:03:51.833 position:13% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi lightly exhales)

00:03:51.866 --> 00:03:54.502 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Kawata chuckles)

00:03:55.837 --> 00:03:58.973 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Gang] Good evening, sir!

00:03:59.006 --> 00:04:02.610 position:10% line:89% align:start
(foreboding music continues)

00:04:18.926 --> 00:04:21.529 position:10% line:89% align:start
We're here to officially name

00:04:21.562 --> 00:04:24.799 position:24% line:83% align:start
the new captain of
the 3rd Division!

00:04:26.567 --> 00:04:29.537 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] The new
3rd Division Captain?

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.739 position:21% line:83% align:start
So who do you think's
gonna get chosen?

00:04:31.773 --> 00:04:32.540 position:35% line:89% align:start
Peh, maybe?

00:04:32.573 --> 00:04:34.041 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yeah, not gonna happen.

00:04:34.075 --> 00:04:36.644 position:13% line:83% align:start
Do you think they'd pick
the guy who attacked Draken

00:04:36.677 --> 00:04:37.678 position:27% line:89% align:start
to be a captain?

00:04:37.712 --> 00:04:38.880 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Member] No way.

00:04:38.913 --> 00:04:39.881 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Member] Then who is it?

00:04:39.914 --> 00:04:40.882 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Member] Me, maybe?

00:04:41.916 --> 00:04:43.283 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Member] Yeah, right.

00:04:43.316 --> 00:04:45.119 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Are they not here?

00:04:45.153 --> 00:04:47.454 position:24% line:89% align:start
Wait, could it be?

00:04:47.487 --> 00:04:48.556 position:24% line:89% align:start
No, of course not.

00:04:50.858 --> 00:04:53.895 position:21% line:83% align:start
3rd Division Captain,
step forward!

00:04:56.329 --> 00:04:57.532 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Huh?

00:04:57.565 --> 00:05:00.433 position:16% line:89% align:start
Is Mikey calling for me?

00:05:02.335 --> 00:05:04.972 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Well?
-Don't look at me.

00:05:05.006 --> 00:05:06.974 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Come on.
-Yes, sir!

00:05:07.008 --> 00:05:10.477 position:16% line:89% align:start
(gang members murmuring)

00:05:12.647 --> 00:05:13.446 position:35% line:89% align:start
Move aside!

00:05:14.115 --> 00:05:17.518 position:16% line:89% align:start
(gang members murmuring)

00:05:21.488 --> 00:05:24.457 position:21% line:83% align:start
So that's the new
3rd Division Captain?

00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:26.828 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Member] Which? The big
one or the small one?

00:05:30.998 --> 00:05:33.868 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] Yeah, of course
it wasn't gonna be me.

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:38.405 position:16% line:89% align:start
(gang members murmuring)

00:05:39.707 --> 00:05:40.708 position:44% line:89% align:start
Wait.

00:05:42.243 --> 00:05:44.912 position:30% line:89% align:start
(ominous music)

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.251 position:7% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi nervously breathing)

00:05:50.284 --> 00:05:53.788 position:16% line:89% align:start
(ominous music continues)

00:06:00.962 --> 00:06:02.495 position:21% line:89% align:start
I've seen him before.

00:06:03.264 --> 00:06:04.397 position:27% line:89% align:start
Who is he again?

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.036 position:16% line:89% align:start
(ominous music continues)

00:06:16.077 --> 00:06:19.580 position:16% line:89% align:start
(gang members chattering)

00:06:23.217 --> 00:06:25.853 position:27% line:83% align:start
-What's his deal?
-Is he crazy?

00:06:25.887 --> 00:06:28.990 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Member] He's sitting with
his back to the commander!

00:06:29.023 --> 00:06:30.224 position:16% line:89% align:start
Who do you think you are?

00:06:30.258 --> 00:06:31.559 position:33% line:89% align:start
You serious?

00:06:31.592 --> 00:06:33.393 position:10% line:89% align:start
What the hell's your problem?

00:06:34.427 --> 00:06:38.566 position:16% line:89% align:start
(gang members protesting)

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:40.935 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Member] What, he's not
even gonna say anything?

00:06:40.968 --> 00:06:43.304 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Member] What the hell's
wrong with this guy?

00:06:43.337 --> 00:06:45.573 position:27% line:83% align:start
All right, listen
up, you grunts!

00:06:45.606 --> 00:06:48.109 position:24% line:83% align:start
Toman's new captain
of the 3rd Division

00:06:48.142 --> 00:06:50.410 position:5% line:89% align:start
is sitting here right behind me:

00:06:50.443 --> 00:06:52.813 position:33% line:89% align:start
Tetta Kisaki!

00:06:52.847 --> 00:06:55.516 position:30% line:89% align:start
(intense music)

00:06:58.119 --> 00:07:00.621 position:16% line:89% align:start
I was scared, Takemichi.

00:07:00.655 --> 00:07:03.456 position:16% line:89% align:start
Just so scared of Kisaki.

00:07:04.625 --> 00:07:05.826 position:21% line:89% align:start
I would kill Kisaki!

00:07:07.795 --> 00:07:10.430 position:24% line:83% align:start
Kisaki's the one
behind everything.

00:07:10.463 --> 00:07:12.967 position:33% line:89% align:start
(eerie music)

00:07:14.235 --> 00:07:16.270 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] That's Kisaki?

00:07:16.304 --> 00:07:20.440 position:10% line:83% align:start
I never expected him to just
show up right in front of me!

00:07:20.473 --> 00:07:21.474 position:27% line:89% align:start
What should I do?

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:23.611 position:27% line:89% align:start
What should I do?

00:07:24.645 --> 00:07:26.580 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Member] I've seen
this guy before!

00:07:26.614 --> 00:07:28.549 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Member] He's from
Moebius, isn't he?

00:07:28.582 --> 00:07:30.450 position:16% line:89% align:start
Wait, he's from Moebius?

00:07:30.483 --> 00:07:32.887 position:24% line:83% align:start
What's someone from
Moebius doing here?

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.089 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Member] Get the
hell out, Moebius!

00:07:35.122 --> 00:07:37.124 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yeah, just piss off!

00:07:37.158 --> 00:07:38.559 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Gang] Piss off! Piss off!

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.562 position:24% line:89% align:start
Piss off! Piss off!

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:46.033 position:24% line:89% align:start
Piss off! Piss off!

00:07:46.067 --> 00:07:48.369 position:24% line:89% align:start
Piss off! Piss off!

00:07:48.402 --> 00:07:51.539 position:27% line:83% align:start
Shut up! That's
Mikey's decision!

00:07:51.572 --> 00:07:54.008 position:19% line:83% align:start
Anyone who doesn't
like it, step forward!

00:08:01.549 --> 00:08:04.752 position:21% line:83% align:start
We gotta be ready
to take on Valhalla!

00:08:04.785 --> 00:08:06.754 position:7% line:89% align:start
This new Valhalla we're facing

00:08:06.787 --> 00:08:10.458 position:13% line:83% align:start
is so huge that Moebius is
like nothing next to them!

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.794 position:19% line:83% align:start
To beat them, Toman
will need to grow too!

00:08:13.828 --> 00:08:15.930 position:5% line:89% align:start
Tetta Kisaki here did a good job

00:08:15.963 --> 00:08:17.765 position:24% line:83% align:start
of keeping our
generation in check

00:08:17.798 --> 00:08:20.001 position:13% line:89% align:start
while he was with Moebius.

00:08:20.034 --> 00:08:24.205 position:19% line:83% align:start
We'll need him on our
side to fight Valhalla!

00:08:24.238 --> 00:08:27.141 position:27% line:83% align:start
So Kisaki is now
the new captain!

00:08:28.175 --> 00:08:29.510 position:30% line:89% align:start
Remember that!

00:08:31.379 --> 00:08:33.814 position:27% line:83% align:start
This appointment
ceremony is over!

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:39.687 position:27% line:89% align:start
(menacing music)

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.523 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] Shit! This is
the worst possible outcome!

00:08:42.556 --> 00:08:44.658 position:10% line:89% align:start
Not only is Kisaki in Toman,

00:08:44.692 --> 00:08:47.828 position:13% line:83% align:start
but he's jumped straight to
being 3rd Division Captain!

00:08:47.862 --> 00:08:51.699 position:13% line:89% align:start
(menacing music continues)

00:08:53.234 --> 00:08:54.235 position:35% line:89% align:start
Commander!

00:09:05.413 --> 00:09:06.647 position:30% line:89% align:start
Thank you, sir!

00:09:07.882 --> 00:09:08.682 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right.

00:09:09.483 --> 00:09:13.020 position:13% line:89% align:start
(menacing music continues)

00:09:18.659 --> 00:09:20.561 position:10% line:89% align:start
What could Mikey be thinking?

00:09:21.328 --> 00:09:22.663 position:24% line:89% align:start
He out of his mind?

00:09:26.801 --> 00:09:28.169 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Let's go.
-Right!

00:09:32.673 --> 00:09:35.976 position:10% line:89% align:start
(nervously panting) Damn it!

00:09:37.611 --> 00:09:40.214 position:24% line:83% align:start
This means that
Hina's going to...

00:09:41.282 --> 00:09:44.618 position:13% line:89% align:start
(menacing music continues)

00:09:47.955 --> 00:09:49.524 position:10% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi heavily breathing)

00:09:49.558 --> 00:09:51.225 position:30% line:83% align:start
-(punch thuds)
-Ugh!

00:09:51.258 --> 00:09:55.129 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi grunts)

00:09:55.162 --> 00:09:58.265 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi panting)

00:09:58.299 --> 00:10:00.367 position:19% line:89% align:start
(gang members gasping)

00:10:00.401 --> 00:10:02.069 position:27% line:89% align:start
What in the hell?

00:10:02.103 --> 00:10:03.204 position:35% line:89% align:start
Takemitchy!

00:10:03.237 --> 00:10:04.238 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:10:04.271 --> 00:10:06.774 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi panting)

00:10:06.807 --> 00:10:08.543 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Member] What's that all about?

00:10:08.577 --> 00:10:09.944 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Member] Holy shit.

00:10:09.977 --> 00:10:12.446 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Member] The top brass
is gonna kill him!

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.282 position:7% line:89% align:start
What the? You out of your mind?

00:10:15.316 --> 00:10:17.785 position:10% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi nervously panting)

00:10:17.818 --> 00:10:19.920 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] Oh, shit.
Now I've done it.

00:10:19.954 --> 00:10:23.257 position:10% line:83% align:start
You ain't even in Toman,
what the hell are you doing?

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:24.792 position:21% line:89% align:start
Ruining the ceremony?

00:10:27.962 --> 00:10:28.762 position:35% line:89% align:start
Draken, I,

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:30.664 position:33% line:89% align:start
I wasn't, uh,

00:10:32.266 --> 00:10:33.234 position:38% line:89% align:start
I didn't-

00:10:33.267 --> 00:10:35.669 position:13% line:89% align:start
Takemitchy, you gone nuts?

00:10:37.705 --> 00:10:41.642 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Kawata] Hey, you
spitting in Mikey's eye?

00:10:41.675 --> 00:10:43.077 position:19% line:89% align:start
That what you're doing?

00:10:45.246 --> 00:10:50.184 position:16% line:83% align:start
No! Honest, you guys,
I... (nervously panting)

00:10:51.118 --> 00:10:52.052 position:24% line:89% align:start
I wasn't trying to-

00:10:52.086 --> 00:10:54.822 position:10% line:89% align:start
Hey, so what's going on here?

00:10:54.855 --> 00:10:57.758 position:24% line:89% align:start
(foreboding music)

00:10:59.927 --> 00:11:02.863 position:24% line:83% align:start
Looks like I nearly
missed the fun.

00:11:02.897 --> 00:11:03.697 position:44% line:89% align:start
Baji.

00:11:04.599 --> 00:11:06.867 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hey, you shouldn't be here.

00:11:06.901 --> 00:11:09.837 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] Huh,
Baji? Who's that?

00:11:11.238 --> 00:11:13.007 position:30% line:83% align:start
-(punch thuds)
-Ugh!

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.309 position:21% line:83% align:start
-(Baji grunting)
-(Takemichi groaning)

00:11:15.342 --> 00:11:16.443 position:27% line:83% align:start
-(Baji grunting)
-(punch thuds)

00:11:16.477 --> 00:11:18.513 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi groaning)

00:11:18.547 --> 00:11:21.215 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Baji laughing)

00:11:22.651 --> 00:11:25.853 position:16% line:89% align:start
All right, that's enough.

00:11:25.886 --> 00:11:28.989 position:27% line:83% align:start
Let go, Mitsuya,
or I'll kill you.

00:11:29.023 --> 00:11:31.759 position:10% line:89% align:start
What is it? Why are you here?

00:11:34.361 --> 00:11:37.264 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi groaning)

00:11:39.133 --> 00:11:40.134 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mikey!

00:11:41.936 --> 00:11:43.470 position:19% line:89% align:start
Why are you here, Baji?

00:11:45.139 --> 00:11:46.707 position:19% line:83% align:start
You've been banned from
attending our meetings,

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:47.708 position:38% line:89% align:start
remember?

00:11:47.741 --> 00:11:49.243 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I do,

00:11:49.276 --> 00:11:52.146 position:19% line:83% align:start
and I just slugged
this twerp in the face.

00:11:52.179 --> 00:11:53.648 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi groaning)

00:11:53.682 --> 00:11:57.451 position:21% line:83% align:start
So does that mean I'm
finally gonna be fired

00:11:57.484 --> 00:11:59.954 position:27% line:83% align:start
for ruining your
precious meeting?

00:11:59.987 --> 00:12:02.489 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] What the hell
is this guy talking about?

00:12:04.291 --> 00:12:05.627 position:44% line:89% align:start
Baji.

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:08.362 position:16% line:89% align:start
Fine, I'll join Valhalla.

00:12:12.099 --> 00:12:14.868 position:10% line:83% align:start
You don't want any
troublemakers, do you, Mikey?

00:12:16.136 --> 00:12:17.271 position:44% line:89% align:start
Baji!

00:12:17.304 --> 00:12:20.274 position:21% line:89% align:start
(light intense music)

00:12:23.578 --> 00:12:24.945 position:10% line:89% align:start
So your 1st Division Captain

00:12:25.879 --> 00:12:27.915 position:7% line:89% align:start
will just go ahead and resign,

00:12:27.948 --> 00:12:29.718 position:19% line:89% align:start
and starting right now,

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:32.286 position:19% line:83% align:start
Toman's former captain
becomes its enemy.

00:12:34.321 --> 00:12:38.325 position:16% line:89% align:start
(gang members chattering)

00:12:38.359 --> 00:12:41.362 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] He was
1st Division Captain,

00:12:41.395 --> 00:12:42.963 position:27% line:89% align:start
and he just quit?

00:12:42.997 --> 00:12:46.367 position:16% line:89% align:start
(gang members murmuring)

00:12:49.303 --> 00:12:54.308 position:21% line:83% align:start
(chuckles) Looks
like Toman is a mess.

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:59.046 position:16% line:89% align:start
(gang members chattering)

00:12:59.079 --> 00:12:59.880 position:44% line:89% align:start
Baji.

00:13:00.715 --> 00:13:02.916 position:19% line:89% align:start
Don't sweat it, Mikey.

00:13:04.385 --> 00:13:05.853 position:19% line:89% align:start
That's just how it is.

00:13:08.255 --> 00:13:09.256 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:13:14.295 --> 00:13:16.463 position:24% line:89% align:start
So hey, Takemitchy.

00:13:16.497 --> 00:13:17.632 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:13:17.666 --> 00:13:18.966 position:33% line:89% align:start
Face or gut?

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:20.801 position:27% line:89% align:start
Take your choice.

00:13:20.834 --> 00:13:22.671 position:19% line:89% align:start
Huh? What do you mean?

00:13:22.704 --> 00:13:24.905 position:27% line:83% align:start
Personally, I'd
choose your face.

00:13:24.938 --> 00:13:25.939 position:27% line:89% align:start
Which will it be?

00:13:27.308 --> 00:13:28.809 position:33% line:89% align:start
Gut, my gut.

00:13:28.842 --> 00:13:31.879 position:30% line:83% align:start
-(punch thuds)
-Ugh!

00:13:33.814 --> 00:13:37.351 position:19% line:83% align:start
(laughs) You tightened
your gut, didn't you?

00:13:47.394 --> 00:13:50.230 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi groaning)

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:03.611 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ow.

00:14:05.379 --> 00:14:06.380 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh right,

00:14:07.381 --> 00:14:08.882 position:24% line:89% align:start
Kisaki punched me.

00:14:12.052 --> 00:14:13.854 position:16% line:89% align:start
But why did I punch him?

00:14:15.856 --> 00:14:17.925 position:21% line:83% align:start
Kisaki's the new 3rd
Division Captain.

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:23.197 position:21% line:83% align:start
My plan was to become
the head of Toman,

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:24.998 position:21% line:83% align:start
but that's not
looking very likely.

00:14:27.201 --> 00:14:28.001 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:14:30.904 --> 00:14:31.905 position:35% line:89% align:start
You awake?

00:14:32.841 --> 00:14:34.074 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Mikey?

00:14:37.911 --> 00:14:39.947 position:16% line:89% align:start
What's Mikey doing here?

00:14:40.948 --> 00:14:44.652 position:24% line:83% align:start
You don't like
Kisaki, am I right?

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:48.956 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] Oh,
well, uh, I, uh...

00:14:55.129 --> 00:14:57.965 position:16% line:83% align:start
You know, it's tough
growing an organization.

00:14:59.133 --> 00:15:03.103 position:10% line:83% align:start
You get some new guys in
and then the old ones leave.

00:15:11.111 --> 00:15:14.081 position:19% line:83% align:start
There's still so far to
go to reach my dream.

00:15:15.482 --> 00:15:16.950 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yes, but Mikey...

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:22.222 position:24% line:83% align:start
I need something
from you. A favor.

00:15:22.256 --> 00:15:23.725 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:15:23.758 --> 00:15:24.958 position:44% line:89% align:start
Sure.

00:15:27.227 --> 00:15:29.597 position:10% line:89% align:start
I got this childhood friend.

00:15:29.631 --> 00:15:30.899 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah?

00:15:30.931 --> 00:15:33.434 position:24% line:83% align:start
Well, we were just
neighbors, really.

00:15:33.467 --> 00:15:35.936 position:24% line:83% align:start
We weren't super
close or anything.

00:15:35.969 --> 00:15:38.172 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] Mikey's
childhood friend.

00:15:38.205 --> 00:15:40.140 position:13% line:89% align:start
They must be pretty crazy.

00:15:41.475 --> 00:15:43.977 position:10% line:83% align:start
You know, the guy was always
picking fights with me

00:15:44.011 --> 00:15:46.848 position:21% line:83% align:start
and I'd kick his ass
every single time.

00:15:46.881 --> 00:15:48.783 position:16% line:83% align:start
Wow, he would keep
picking fights with you?

00:15:48.817 --> 00:15:49.784 position:30% line:89% align:start
You're kidding!

00:15:49.818 --> 00:15:51.051 position:13% line:89% align:start
That guy must've been nuts.

00:15:52.352 --> 00:15:55.657 position:16% line:83% align:start
He's the guy who punched
your lights out earlier.

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:58.325 position:5% line:89% align:start
I sorta got punched by two guys.

00:15:58.358 --> 00:15:59.159 position:33% line:89% align:start
So which one?

00:16:01.228 --> 00:16:04.666 position:21% line:83% align:start
1st Division Captain.
Keisuke Baji.

00:16:10.137 --> 00:16:14.007 position:10% line:83% align:start
That Baji's a pretty
unpredictable guy, isn't he?

00:16:14.041 --> 00:16:17.978 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yeah, I still have no idea
why he wanted to punch me.

00:16:18.011 --> 00:16:21.248 position:21% line:83% align:start
(laughs) He's always
been like that.

00:16:21.281 --> 00:16:24.485 position:10% line:83% align:start
He'd slug someone walking
by just 'cause he was tired.

00:16:24.519 --> 00:16:27.655 position:10% line:83% align:start
He set a car on fire one time
just 'cause he was hungry.

00:16:27.689 --> 00:16:30.023 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yeah, of course.

00:16:30.057 --> 00:16:32.292 position:21% line:83% align:start
This guy goes way
beyond unpredictable.

00:16:33.795 --> 00:16:36.196 position:7% line:89% align:start
Anyway, that's what he's like.

00:16:37.331 --> 00:16:39.901 position:21% line:83% align:start
He was there to
help us start Toman.

00:16:39.934 --> 00:16:41.536 position:16% line:89% align:start
He was a founding member?

00:16:43.237 --> 00:16:47.609 position:13% line:83% align:start
When Toman began, I was in
middle school, first year.

00:16:47.642 --> 00:16:51.078 position:10% line:89% align:start
It was Draken, Mitsuya, Pah,

00:16:51.478 --> 00:16:52.714 position:33% line:89% align:start
Baji and me.

00:16:53.447 --> 00:16:56.083 position:30% line:89% align:start
(serene music)

00:16:57.886 --> 00:16:59.253 position:24% line:89% align:start
So the five of you.

00:17:00.487 --> 00:17:02.256 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's right.

00:17:02.289 --> 00:17:05.292 position:19% line:83% align:start
We all got together and
established this team.

00:17:11.498 --> 00:17:16.069 position:7% line:83% align:start
Takemitchy, I want you to
bring Baji back from Valhalla.

00:17:17.237 --> 00:17:20.107 position:24% line:83% align:start
I really kinda like
the guy, you know?

00:17:22.844 --> 00:17:24.077 position:19% line:89% align:start
Think you can do that?

00:17:25.379 --> 00:17:26.514 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah!

00:17:26.548 --> 00:17:28.750 position:16% line:83% align:start
If that's what you
want, Mikey, you got it!

00:17:31.886 --> 00:17:33.086 position:38% line:89% align:start
But, uh,

00:17:34.121 --> 00:17:37.324 position:16% line:83% align:start
do you think I could ask
for one thing in return?

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:39.761 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:17:42.095 --> 00:17:43.096 position:41% line:89% align:start
Kisaki.

00:17:44.599 --> 00:17:45.600 position:33% line:89% align:start
You've gotta

00:17:47.802 --> 00:17:50.337 position:16% line:89% align:start
kick Kisaki out of Toman!

00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:51.171 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:17:52.172 --> 00:17:54.341 position:19% line:83% align:start
Why'd you bring someone
like him into your gang?

00:17:55.877 --> 00:17:57.110 position:13% line:89% align:start
I can't explain it to you,

00:17:57.144 --> 00:18:01.583 position:27% line:83% align:start
but trust me, the
guy is bad news!

00:18:01.616 --> 00:18:05.452 position:13% line:83% align:start
He's gonna, Kisaki is gonna
destroy Toman in the future!

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:10.390 position:13% line:83% align:start
No matter what I say, he's
never gonna understand.

00:18:16.463 --> 00:18:17.565 position:44% line:89% align:start
Fine.

00:18:17.599 --> 00:18:19.232 position:33% line:89% align:start
What? Really?

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.769 position:24% line:83% align:start
We're going to end
up butting heads

00:18:21.803 --> 00:18:23.805 position:13% line:89% align:start
with Valhalla pretty soon.

00:18:23.838 --> 00:18:25.607 position:27% line:83% align:start
Just bring Baji
back before then.

00:18:27.174 --> 00:18:29.777 position:16% line:83% align:start
Prove you can be more
useful to me than Kisaki.

00:18:33.113 --> 00:18:35.750 position:16% line:83% align:start
You don't have to tell me
that Kisaki's bad news.

00:18:37.117 --> 00:18:39.286 position:21% line:83% align:start
But at the same time,
I know he's strong,

00:18:40.755 --> 00:18:44.291 position:16% line:83% align:start
and in the future, we're
gonna need that strength.

00:18:45.325 --> 00:18:47.762 position:27% line:83% align:start
You go work this
out, Takemitchy.

00:18:49.363 --> 00:18:51.799 position:10% line:83% align:start
Remember, you're the one who
brought this trade to me.

00:18:51.833 --> 00:18:53.166 position:27% line:89% align:start
But if you fail,

00:18:54.002 --> 00:18:55.202 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'll kill you.

00:19:00.675 --> 00:19:01.843 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Mitsuya!
-Huh?

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:05.212 position:19% line:83% align:start
How long are you gonna
keep eavesdropping?

00:19:06.014 --> 00:19:07.414 position:33% line:89% align:start
Come on out!

00:19:07.447 --> 00:19:10.885 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's not like I can't see
see your dumb silver hair.

00:19:10.918 --> 00:19:13.888 position:10% line:89% align:start
(chuckles) Caught in the act.

00:19:13.921 --> 00:19:15.389 position:7% line:89% align:start
I was looking for the bathroom

00:19:15.422 --> 00:19:18.092 position:10% line:89% align:start
and I heard you guys talking.

00:19:18.126 --> 00:19:20.160 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Mitsuya.

00:19:21.228 --> 00:19:23.765 position:7% line:89% align:start
Anyway, your timing's perfect.

00:19:23.798 --> 00:19:27.035 position:19% line:83% align:start
Listen, I've decided to
assign Takemitchy here

00:19:27.068 --> 00:19:28.603 position:21% line:89% align:start
to your 2nd Division.

00:19:28.636 --> 00:19:30.270 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:19:30.972 --> 00:19:32.573 position:35% line:89% align:start
Takemitchy,

00:19:32.607 --> 00:19:35.910 position:16% line:83% align:start
starting from today,
you're a member of Toman.

00:19:35.943 --> 00:19:37.477 position:16% line:89% align:start
Good to have you with us.

00:19:40.213 --> 00:19:43.250 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's super good to be
with you, thank you!

00:19:44.217 --> 00:19:46.721 position:16% line:83% align:start
Guess this is the reward
I get for eavesdropping.

00:19:48.156 --> 00:19:49.957 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Mikey] We should
be heading back.

00:19:49.991 --> 00:19:51.559 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Mitsuya] Yeah.

00:19:51.592 --> 00:19:52.426 position:33% line:89% align:start
You go ahead.

00:19:52.459 --> 00:19:54.361 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna wash this
blood off first.

00:19:57.165 --> 00:19:59.867 position:27% line:89% align:start
(both chuckling)

00:20:13.047 --> 00:20:15.883 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi spits)

00:20:18.218 --> 00:20:20.688 position:16% line:83% align:start
So all this time I wasn't
even a member of Toman?

00:20:21.689 --> 00:20:23.390 position:30% line:89% align:start
Of course not!

00:20:23.423 --> 00:20:25.225 position:7% line:89% align:start
And yet, I actually told Naoto

00:20:25.258 --> 00:20:27.595 position:19% line:83% align:start
that I was gonna become
the head of Toman.

00:20:27.628 --> 00:20:29.564 position:27% line:89% align:start
How embarrassing!

00:20:29.597 --> 00:20:30.397 position:47% line:89% align:start
But

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.401 position:5% line:89% align:start
at least I've got a lead, Naoto!

00:20:35.402 --> 00:20:37.739 position:24% line:83% align:start
If I can drag Baji
back to Toman,

00:20:37.772 --> 00:20:40.908 position:19% line:83% align:start
I might be able to
get Kisaki kicked out.

00:20:40.942 --> 00:20:42.610 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh.

00:20:42.643 --> 00:20:45.445 position:16% line:83% align:start
But why did Baji quit
Toman in the first place?

00:20:47.481 --> 00:20:48.281 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:20:54.689 --> 00:20:55.690 position:38% line:89% align:start
A charm?

00:20:57.290 --> 00:20:58.526 position:21% line:89% align:start
I wonder whose it is?

00:21:02.697 --> 00:21:03.698 position:33% line:89% align:start
What's this?

00:21:04.966 --> 00:21:05.967 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh, it's a picture.

00:21:06.868 --> 00:21:09.537 position:30% line:89% align:start
(gentle music)

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:11.606 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's Mikey, and Draken!

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:13.641 position:38% line:89% align:start
So young!

00:21:14.474 --> 00:21:15.643 position:21% line:89% align:start
Mitsuya's there, too!

00:21:16.644 --> 00:21:18.212 position:38% line:89% align:start
And Pah!

00:21:18.246 --> 00:21:19.446 position:38% line:89% align:start
And Baji.

00:21:20.648 --> 00:21:22.784 position:21% line:83% align:start
So these are all the
founding members.

00:21:23.951 --> 00:21:26.821 position:16% line:83% align:start
This is amazing! I can't
believe I found this.

00:21:28.488 --> 00:21:32.093 position:10% line:89% align:start
One, two, three, four, five,

00:21:32.126 --> 00:21:33.393 position:19% line:89% align:start
there are six of them.

00:21:34.762 --> 00:21:36.931 position:13% line:83% align:start
But I thought there were
only five founding members?

00:21:38.866 --> 00:21:42.369 position:16% line:83% align:start
Who's this guy? He seems
super close to Baji.

00:21:43.571 --> 00:21:46.207 position:7% line:89% align:start
He's got a tattoo on his neck.

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:47.909 position:35% line:89% align:start
Who is he?

00:21:47.942 --> 00:21:50.578 position:27% line:89% align:start
(soft epic music)

00:22:04.058 --> 00:22:05.726 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's been a while.

00:22:07.829 --> 00:22:08.830 position:38% line:89% align:start
Kazutora.

00:22:17.905 --> 00:22:22.710 position:21% line:89% align:start
(closing theme music)

00:22:24.477 --> 00:22:29.349 position:7% line:83% align:start
(vocalists singing in Japanese)
