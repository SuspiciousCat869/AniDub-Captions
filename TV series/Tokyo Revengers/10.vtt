(runners panting)

00:00:14.983 --> 00:00:16.483 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Takashi] Turn right up here.

00:00:16.518 --> 00:00:17.519 position:41% line:89% align:start
Got it.

00:00:18.653 --> 00:00:20.020 position:19% line:89% align:start
Those are Moebius guys.

00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:22.389 position:33% line:89% align:start
(men yelling)

00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:23.223 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.028 position:33% line:89% align:start
(man yelling)

00:00:30.565 --> 00:00:31.733 position:41% line:89% align:start
Draken.

00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:34.702 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hey, Mitsuya, Takemitchy.

00:00:36.905 --> 00:00:39.072 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Emma] Draken,
are you all right?

00:00:39.507 --> 00:00:40.575 position:27% line:89% align:start
Stay back, Emma.

00:00:40.608 --> 00:00:42.442 position:21% line:89% align:start
So Peh, you traitor.

00:00:42.476 --> 00:00:44.879 position:13% line:83% align:start
What the hell are you doing
teaming up with Moebius?

00:00:44.913 --> 00:00:46.413 position:16% line:89% align:start
Shut your mouth, Mitsuya.

00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:48.115 position:7% line:89% align:start
Or I'll have 'em kill you too.

00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:50.484 position:19% line:83% align:start
You little shits really
think you got a chance

00:00:50.518 --> 00:00:51.653 position:24% line:89% align:start
against all of us?

00:00:51.686 --> 00:00:52.486 position:24% line:89% align:start
(wheel screeching)

00:00:54.522 --> 00:00:56.056 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Peh] Shit, Mikey.

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:57.424 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Just in time.

00:00:58.793 --> 00:01:01.596 position:13% line:83% align:start
All right, with Mikey here,
Peh will have to stop.

00:01:04.131 --> 00:01:07.200 position:21% line:83% align:start
But it really doesn't
matter much who I am.

00:01:07.234 --> 00:01:10.070 position:13% line:83% align:start
All that matters is for now
I'm in charge of Moebius.

00:01:10.103 --> 00:01:11.539 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm Hanma.

00:01:11.573 --> 00:01:12.339 position:27% line:89% align:start
(exciting music)

00:01:12.372 --> 00:01:14.341 position:7% line:89% align:start
Moebius has a hundred men here

00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:17.210 position:24% line:83% align:start
while pitiful Toman
has a measly four.

00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:21.248 position:27% line:89% align:start
(engines revving)

00:01:28.957 --> 00:01:30.157 position:35% line:89% align:start
Well, well.

00:01:31.124 --> 00:01:32.125 position:24% line:89% align:start
Of course you came.

00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:35.362 position:10% line:89% align:start
All right all you jackasses.

00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:37.497 position:27% line:83% align:start
The Tokyo Manji
Gang is here now.

00:01:38.967 --> 00:01:40.200 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Peh grunting)

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:42.469 position:16% line:83% align:start
Looks like the party's
about to get started now.

00:01:43.838 --> 00:01:45.640 position:38% line:89% align:start
Let's go!

00:01:45.673 --> 00:01:47.642 position:33% line:89% align:start
(all yelling)

00:01:47.675 --> 00:01:48.475 position:33% line:89% align:start
Kill 'em all!

00:01:56.183 --> 00:01:58.452 position:5% line:89% align:start
Shit, it's started for real now.

00:01:58.485 --> 00:02:01.288 position:19% line:83% align:start
But somehow, I still
have to protect Draken.

00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:03.357 position:19% line:89% align:start
Where are you, Draken?

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.127 position:21% line:83% align:start
Listen, I don't wanna
fight my own family.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.262 position:24% line:89% align:start
So come back, Peh.

00:02:10.598 --> 00:02:13.133 position:30% line:89% align:start

00:02:17.105 --> 00:02:19.139 position:27% line:89% align:start
(ethereal music)

00:02:19.172 --> 00:02:20.742 position:33% line:89% align:start
There he is.

00:02:20.775 --> 00:02:22.342 position:19% line:89% align:start
I found you, Kiyomasa.

00:02:24.512 --> 00:02:27.314 position:24% line:83% align:start
I did it this time,
I actually did it.

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:31.119 position:30% line:89% align:start
(men grunting)

00:02:35.355 --> 00:02:38.660 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasping)

00:02:38.693 --> 00:02:40.028 position:35% line:89% align:start
Draken, no.

00:02:40.061 --> 00:02:41.696 position:41% line:89% align:start
Draken!

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:43.064 position:35% line:89% align:start
Draken, no.

00:02:43.097 --> 00:02:44.699 position:41% line:89% align:start
Draken?

00:02:44.732 --> 00:02:46.701 position:35% line:89% align:start
Draken, no.

00:02:46.734 --> 00:02:47.702 position:30% line:89% align:start

00:02:58.913 --> 00:03:00.213 position:30% line:83% align:start
-(men grunting)
-Draken!

00:03:00.247 --> 00:03:01.248 position:35% line:89% align:start
Draken, no.

00:03:05.385 --> 00:03:06.521 position:16% line:89% align:start
This can't be happening.

00:03:06.554 --> 00:03:11.526 position:21% line:83% align:start
-(melancholic music)
-(people grunting)

00:03:12.894 --> 00:03:14.662 position:16% line:89% align:start
What's wrong, Takemitchy?

00:03:14.696 --> 00:03:16.296 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's Draken, Mikey.

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.666 position:19% line:83% align:start
Draken, he's been
stabbed in the stomach.

00:03:20.068 --> 00:03:21.736 position:24% line:89% align:start
I think he's dead.

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.237 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Mikey gasping)

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.278 position:30% line:89% align:start
(men grunting)

00:03:32.947 --> 00:03:34.816 position:16% line:89% align:start
Let me through, jackass.

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:36.751 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Mikey gasping)

00:03:36.784 --> 00:03:39.620 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Hanma chuckling)

00:03:40.588 --> 00:03:41.589 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hanma.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.324 position:21% line:89% align:start
I finally found you.

00:03:44.992 --> 00:03:45.993 position:27% line:89% align:start
Mikey (cackles).

00:03:51.666 --> 00:03:54.301 position:30% line:89% align:start
(men grunting)

00:04:16.124 --> 00:04:17.558 position:30% line:89% align:start
What the hell?

00:04:21.929 --> 00:04:23.296 position:13% line:89% align:start
Fighting's hard work, huh?

00:04:24.832 --> 00:04:25.800 position:21% line:89% align:start
(opening theme music)

(men grunting)

00:05:56.824 --> 00:05:58.092 position:27% line:5% align:start
[Man] Like that?

00:05:58.125 --> 00:06:01.028 position:24% line:5% align:start
(Takemichi panting)

00:06:01.062 --> 00:06:04.431 position:10% line:5% align:start
It's over, it's all over now.

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:07.434 position:30% line:89% align:start
Draken is dead.

00:06:08.401 --> 00:06:10.571 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hey, Takemitchy.

00:06:10.605 --> 00:06:11.706 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:06:11.739 --> 00:06:14.474 position:21% line:83% align:start
-(Takemichi gasping)
-(Draken gagging)

00:06:14.508 --> 00:06:17.377 position:10% line:89% align:start
He's still alive, he's alive!

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.379 position:30% line:89% align:start
(men grunting)

00:06:19.412 --> 00:06:20.413 position:27% line:89% align:start
Take care of him!

00:06:24.852 --> 00:06:26.386 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:28.756 position:24% line:83% align:start
He wants me to take
care of Draken?

00:06:31.092 --> 00:06:33.694 position:30% line:89% align:start
(men grunting)

00:06:39.267 --> 00:06:42.003 position:27% line:89% align:start
(dramatic music)

00:06:48.809 --> 00:06:49.810 position:35% line:89% align:start
He's right.

00:06:51.512 --> 00:06:52.647 position:33% line:89% align:start
I, I have to.

00:06:58.119 --> 00:06:59.120 position:35% line:89% align:start
I have to.

00:07:00.187 --> 00:07:03.124 position:21% line:83% align:start
I have to do
something about this.

00:07:03.157 --> 00:07:06.193 position:19% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi struggling)

00:07:21.943 --> 00:07:25.478 position:16% line:83% align:start
He's so heavy, I already
feel like giving up.

00:07:26.948 --> 00:07:27.949 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Draken gagging)

00:07:27.982 --> 00:07:28.783 position:35% line:89% align:start
Draken, no.

00:07:34.789 --> 00:07:37.490 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm gonna save you, I swear it.

00:07:37.525 --> 00:07:39.492 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna get you
to the hospital.

00:07:43.931 --> 00:07:44.732 position:38% line:89% align:start
I swear.

00:07:47.101 --> 00:07:49.170 position:10% line:89% align:start
I swear you're gonna be okay.

00:07:51.572 --> 00:07:53.074 position:24% line:89% align:start
Don't give up, me!

00:07:56.577 --> 00:07:58.212 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Hinata] Takemichi!

00:07:58.245 --> 00:08:00.348 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hina, Emma!

00:08:00.381 --> 00:08:02.383 position:24% line:83% align:start
We called and asked
for an ambulance.

00:08:02.416 --> 00:08:03.718 position:33% line:89% align:start
How's Draken?

00:08:03.751 --> 00:08:06.620 position:7% line:89% align:start
Don't worry, he's still alive!

00:08:09.457 --> 00:08:12.793 position:30% line:89% align:start
(rain falling)

00:08:12.827 --> 00:08:13.694 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, Draken.

00:08:15.529 --> 00:08:17.665 position:13% line:89% align:start
What's taking them so long?

00:08:17.698 --> 00:08:21.635 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hina, are you sure the ambulance
knows where to find us?

00:08:21.669 --> 00:08:24.338 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yeah, but they said
they were backed up

00:08:24.372 --> 00:08:26.474 position:19% line:83% align:start
because of the
festival and the rain.

00:08:26.507 --> 00:08:29.510 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasping)

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:37.952 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Seriously?
-What?

00:08:37.985 --> 00:08:38.986 position:33% line:89% align:start
What's wrong?

00:08:40.488 --> 00:08:41.689 position:41% line:89% align:start
Oh no.

00:08:42.423 --> 00:08:44.025 position:7% line:89% align:start
What the hell is he doing here?

00:08:45.359 --> 00:08:46.527 position:24% line:89% align:start
Ah, what the heck?

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.563 position:19% line:83% align:start
You telling me Draken's
still not dead yet?

00:08:49.597 --> 00:08:53.502 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yeah, and what's
trashy-mitchy doing here?

00:08:53.534 --> 00:08:54.869 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Kiyomasa grunting)

00:08:54.902 --> 00:08:57.171 position:13% line:83% align:start
Aren't you ever gonna learn
to mind your own business,

00:08:57.204 --> 00:08:58.172 position:24% line:89% align:start
you piece of shit?

00:08:58.205 --> 00:09:00.708 position:24% line:89% align:start
(foreboding music)

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:04.645 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Kiyomasa laughing)

00:09:04.678 --> 00:09:06.981 position:7% line:83% align:start
Looks like I'm gonna need
some more duct tape over here.

00:09:07.014 --> 00:09:09.183 position:30% line:89% align:start
(men laughing)

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:16.857 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's all over.

00:09:19.293 --> 00:09:20.428 position:27% line:89% align:start
(water splashing)

00:09:20.461 --> 00:09:21.662 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Draken] Takemitchy.

(Takemichi gasping)

00:09:28.335 --> 00:09:30.304 position:27% line:89% align:start
Did Draken speak?

00:09:30.337 --> 00:09:31.672 position:19% line:89% align:start
You have to hold still.

00:09:32.673 --> 00:09:35.676 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Draken gasping)

00:09:37.411 --> 00:09:40.614 position:7% line:89% align:start
Thank you for this, Takemitchy.

00:09:43.584 --> 00:09:47.588 position:13% line:83% align:start
Now you take Hina and
Emma with you and you run.

00:09:47.621 --> 00:09:49.423 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hmm (quivering)?

00:09:49.457 --> 00:09:52.126 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm all right here.

00:09:52.159 --> 00:09:52.960 position:27% line:89% align:start
Don't you worry.

00:09:55.229 --> 00:09:56.230 position:44% line:89% align:start
Run?

00:10:01.769 --> 00:10:05.806 position:13% line:83% align:start
Did I seriously just start
to run away from this?

00:10:07.241 --> 00:10:08.577 position:19% line:89% align:start
Did Draken notice that?

00:10:08.609 --> 00:10:11.745 position:13% line:89% align:start
Now get going, Takemitchy.

00:10:12.746 --> 00:10:15.249 position:24% line:83% align:start
How can I go when
he's falling apart?

00:10:18.986 --> 00:10:24.091 position:10% line:83% align:start
And when I lost everything
because I kept running away.

00:10:24.125 --> 00:10:27.061 position:30% line:89% align:start
(ominous music)

00:10:27.094 --> 00:10:31.265 position:5% line:83% align:start
Am I really going to use my
second chance to run away again?

00:10:31.298 --> 00:10:34.735 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi screaming)

00:10:34.768 --> 00:10:35.803 position:30% line:89% align:start
(somber music)

00:10:35.836 --> 00:10:37.905 position:19% line:89% align:start
What is it, Takemichi?

00:10:39.508 --> 00:10:40.841 position:24% line:89% align:start
Damn, I'm pathetic.

00:10:40.875 --> 00:10:43.344 position:16% line:83% align:start
What the hell did I
even come back here for?

00:10:48.215 --> 00:10:49.984 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hina, back away.

00:10:50.017 --> 00:10:51.553 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:10:51.586 --> 00:10:54.255 position:27% line:89% align:start
Draken, thank you

00:10:54.922 --> 00:10:56.724 position:13% line:89% align:start
for giving me the courage.

00:10:57.424 --> 00:10:58.926 position:16% line:89% align:start
What are you going to do?

00:10:59.927 --> 00:11:02.663 position:21% line:83% align:start
If I run away, it
all ends right here.

00:11:02.696 --> 00:11:03.898 position:27% line:89% align:start
(exciting music)

00:11:03.931 --> 00:11:05.733 position:24% line:83% align:start
This isn't just
for everyone else.

00:11:13.707 --> 00:11:15.476 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Kiyomasa] What the
hell are you doing?

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:17.011 position:24% line:89% align:start
You wanna die too?

00:11:18.179 --> 00:11:19.313 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hey, watch out.

00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:21.282 position:10% line:89% align:start
Last chance to run away, kid.

00:11:21.315 --> 00:11:24.619 position:30% line:89% align:start
(men laughing)

00:11:24.653 --> 00:11:25.853 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hell no.

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:29.890 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm not running away this time.

00:11:31.025 --> 00:11:34.161 position:21% line:83% align:start
This time I'm
finally going to take

00:11:37.064 --> 00:11:38.399 position:35% line:89% align:start
my revenge.

00:11:41.168 --> 00:11:43.771 position:30% line:89% align:start
(rain falling)

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:51.712 position:27% line:89% align:start
Here's what's up.

00:11:51.745 --> 00:11:53.847 position:21% line:83% align:start
You and I still need
to settle things.

00:11:55.115 --> 00:11:56.283 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:11:56.317 --> 00:11:59.286 position:19% line:83% align:start
From our one-on-one
back at the fight club.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.555 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:12:00.589 --> 00:12:02.089 position:27% line:83% align:start
What the hell are
you talking about?

00:12:02.122 --> 00:12:06.393 position:10% line:83% align:start
You lost, everybody there
saw you get your ass kicked.

00:12:06.427 --> 00:12:07.696 position:30% line:89% align:start
I didn't lose.

00:12:07.728 --> 00:12:09.863 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Kiyomasa scoffing)

00:12:09.897 --> 00:12:12.099 position:19% line:89% align:start
Huh, well in that case,

00:12:13.234 --> 00:12:15.402 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm betting a grand
on Takemitchy.

00:12:15.436 --> 00:12:16.403 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Wha?

00:12:16.437 --> 00:12:17.871 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-(somber music)

00:12:17.905 --> 00:12:21.175 position:16% line:83% align:start
This is dumb as shit, but
I'll go along with it.

00:12:21.208 --> 00:12:23.578 position:21% line:83% align:start
Me too, I'll bet
two thousand on him.

00:12:23.612 --> 00:12:25.379 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'll bet three thousand!

00:12:25.412 --> 00:12:27.114 position:19% line:89% align:start
You guys, are you nuts?

00:12:28.048 --> 00:12:29.718 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ha.

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:31.785 position:16% line:83% align:start
Either these idiots have
all lost their damn minds

00:12:31.819 --> 00:12:33.187 position:16% line:89% align:start
or they've been drinking.

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:34.689 position:30% line:89% align:start
(men laughing)

00:12:34.723 --> 00:12:35.923 position:24% line:89% align:start
You're wrong again.

00:12:37.992 --> 00:12:39.460 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Kiyomasa] How do you figure?

00:12:40.695 --> 00:12:42.296 position:19% line:89% align:start
Takemitchy's gonna win.

00:12:42.329 --> 00:12:44.798 position:30% line:89% align:start
(defiant music)

00:12:46.133 --> 00:12:47.134 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:50.971 position:27% line:89% align:start
Thanks, everyone.

00:12:51.005 --> 00:12:53.340 position:16% line:89% align:start
Let's do this, Kiyomasa!

00:12:53.374 --> 00:12:54.808 position:21% line:89% align:start
We're finishing this!

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:58.846 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Kiyomasa chuckling)

00:12:58.879 --> 00:13:01.516 position:19% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi whimpering)

00:13:01.549 --> 00:13:03.518 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Hinata gasping)

00:13:03.551 --> 00:13:07.221 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi yelling)

00:13:07.254 --> 00:13:09.624 position:24% line:83% align:start
Well now, I thought
I killed you before,

00:13:09.658 --> 00:13:12.259 position:24% line:83% align:start
but look how lively
you still are.

00:13:12.293 --> 00:13:13.294 position:35% line:89% align:start
Takemichi!

00:13:13.327 --> 00:13:14.596 position:27% line:89% align:start
Stay here, Hina!

00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:15.630 position:7% line:89% align:start
You'll just get hurt yourself!

00:13:15.664 --> 00:13:17.331 position:19% line:89% align:start
But I have to help him!

00:13:17.364 --> 00:13:18.932 position:19% line:89% align:start
Look what's happening!

00:13:18.966 --> 00:13:22.002 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi grunting)

00:13:23.538 --> 00:13:25.806 position:7% line:89% align:start
See, this ain't no one-on-one.

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:29.476 position:16% line:89% align:start
This here's an execution!

00:13:29.511 --> 00:13:30.779 position:30% line:89% align:start
(men laughing)

00:13:30.811 --> 00:13:32.179 position:19% line:89% align:start
And guess whose, dude?

00:13:35.015 --> 00:13:37.251 position:7% line:89% align:start
You're about to die, Hanagaki.

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:43.057 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi screaming)

00:13:46.927 --> 00:13:50.998 position:10% line:89% align:start
(defiant music intensifying)

00:13:51.031 --> 00:13:54.034 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi yelling)

00:13:55.469 --> 00:13:57.338 position:16% line:89% align:start
We're taking over Japan!

00:13:57.371 --> 00:13:59.406 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-What are you talking about?

00:14:00.374 --> 00:14:02.042 position:21% line:83% align:start
You guys, if we're
gonna be delinquents,

00:14:02.076 --> 00:14:04.478 position:24% line:83% align:start
we need to find out
how far we can go

00:14:04.512 --> 00:14:06.880 position:16% line:83% align:start
if we use nothing but
our hearts and our souls,

00:14:06.914 --> 00:14:08.282 position:30% line:89% align:start
and our fists!

00:14:08.315 --> 00:14:09.784 position:21% line:83% align:start
-I'm not sure-
-I thought I could be

00:14:09.818 --> 00:14:11.985 position:13% line:83% align:start
the most badass delinquent
in all of Tokyo.

00:14:12.019 --> 00:14:13.153 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Takuya] Yeah, let's do this.

00:14:13.187 --> 00:14:16.524 position:19% line:83% align:start
And for starters, let's
whip Shibuya Third.

00:14:16.558 --> 00:14:17.958 position:30% line:89% align:start
(somber music)

00:14:17.991 --> 00:14:20.928 position:21% line:83% align:start
But my big dreams got
shattered instantly.

00:14:22.062 --> 00:14:26.367 position:16% line:83% align:start
I just didn't have it
in me, to be like Mikey.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.136 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi grunting)

00:14:29.169 --> 00:14:33.340 position:10% line:83% align:start
So, Hanagaki, you gonna try
to hit me eventually or what?

00:14:35.042 --> 00:14:39.279 position:16% line:83% align:start
My failure of a life is
all his fault, I thought.

00:14:39.313 --> 00:14:41.716 position:21% line:83% align:start
Are you ready to get
punched to death?

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:43.651 position:19% line:89% align:start
And I was just unlucky.

00:14:44.753 --> 00:14:46.420 position:27% line:83% align:start
At least, that's
what I believed.

00:14:47.655 --> 00:14:48.656 position:27% line:89% align:start
But I was wrong.

00:14:50.924 --> 00:14:51.925 position:35% line:89% align:start
The fact is

00:14:54.995 --> 00:14:56.598 position:19% line:89% align:start
it's all my own fault!

00:14:57.766 --> 00:14:59.199 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi yelling)

00:14:59.233 --> 00:15:01.803 position:16% line:83% align:start
Because I was too weak to
ever face anyone again!

00:15:01.836 --> 00:15:03.671 position:21% line:83% align:start
After getting my ass
whupped just once!

00:15:05.607 --> 00:15:07.074 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Kiyomasa grunting)

00:15:07.107 --> 00:15:08.543 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi grunting)

00:15:08.576 --> 00:15:10.277 position:24% line:89% align:start
You let go of him!

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:13.947 position:10% line:83% align:start
Hey, Hanagaki, don't tell me
that's all you got, shithead.

00:15:13.981 --> 00:15:16.150 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't think your girlfriend's
gonna be too impressed.

00:15:16.183 --> 00:15:18.753 position:19% line:83% align:start
Is that how you fight,
by giving him a hug?

00:15:18.787 --> 00:15:20.087 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's pathetic,
you chicken-shit!

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.756 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi screaming)

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:23.390 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:15:23.424 --> 00:15:24.759 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Kiyomasa yelling)

00:15:24.793 --> 00:15:26.260 position:10% line:89% align:start
Tell me he did not just bite.

00:15:26.293 --> 00:15:28.929 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're a freaking
disgrace, trashy-michi.

00:15:28.962 --> 00:15:30.698 position:13% line:89% align:start
Quit fighting like a girl!

00:15:30.732 --> 00:15:31.932 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Kiyomasa grunting)

00:15:31.965 --> 00:15:34.602 position:27% line:83% align:start
Let go of me, you
little asswipe.

00:15:35.804 --> 00:15:38.472 position:7% line:89% align:start
I don't care if I'm a disgrace.

00:15:38.506 --> 00:15:41.208 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Kiyomasa yelling)

00:15:43.845 --> 00:15:46.346 position:27% line:83% align:start
And I don't care
if I'm pathetic.

00:15:48.883 --> 00:15:51.653 position:24% line:83% align:start
And I don't care if
I'm not like Mikey

00:15:51.686 --> 00:15:56.390 position:7% line:89% align:start
because I'm Takemichi Hanagaki!

00:15:59.527 --> 00:16:01.328 position:27% line:89% align:start
You're just you.

00:16:01.361 --> 00:16:02.329 position:27% line:89% align:start
You're Takemichi.

00:16:03.531 --> 00:16:06.634 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Hinata whimpering)

00:16:06.668 --> 00:16:08.503 position:27% line:89% align:start
(exciting music)

00:16:08.536 --> 00:16:09.604 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi yelling)

00:16:09.637 --> 00:16:12.139 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm not about to
give up on this.

00:16:12.172 --> 00:16:15.309 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm not giving up on my
second chance at life.

00:16:16.678 --> 00:16:18.580 position:10% line:89% align:start
Let go of me you little shit!

00:16:18.613 --> 00:16:21.114 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Kiyomasa yelling)

00:16:21.148 --> 00:16:23.651 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't let him get away, hang on!

00:16:28.489 --> 00:16:31.058 position:30% line:89% align:start
(both yelling)

00:16:45.874 --> 00:16:48.375 position:30% line:89% align:start
(rain falling)

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:56.083 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi grunting)

00:16:57.952 --> 00:16:59.386 position:35% line:89% align:start
Did I win?

00:17:06.426 --> 00:17:07.361 position:38% line:89% align:start
I got my

00:17:09.831 --> 00:17:11.031 position:38% line:89% align:start
revenge.

00:17:13.935 --> 00:17:17.705 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Takemichi!
-No, stay back, Hina.

00:17:17.739 --> 00:17:19.507 position:19% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi struggling)

00:17:19.541 --> 00:17:22.075 position:30% line:89% align:start
(body falling)

00:17:24.679 --> 00:17:26.681 position:19% line:89% align:start
You'd be proud, Naoto.

00:17:26.714 --> 00:17:28.816 position:13% line:89% align:start
I finally stood my ground.

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:32.419 position:24% line:83% align:start
And I finally took
down Kiyomasa.

00:17:33.721 --> 00:17:36.356 position:16% line:89% align:start
But unfortunately, Naoto,

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.296 position:16% line:89% align:start
I screwed up the mission.

00:17:42.329 --> 00:17:43.965 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Akaishi] You done now?

00:17:43.998 --> 00:17:45.399 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Man] That was frigging
lame, Kiyomasa.

00:17:45.432 --> 00:17:48.770 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hee, now ya got someone
to go to hell with ya.

00:17:48.803 --> 00:17:51.338 position:30% line:89% align:start
(men laughing)

00:17:54.008 --> 00:17:57.177 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] Hina,
take Emma and run.

00:17:58.478 --> 00:18:02.149 position:30% line:89% align:start
What about you?

00:18:02.182 --> 00:18:04.986 position:19% line:83% align:start
We'll figure a way out
of this thing somehow.

00:18:05.019 --> 00:18:06.219 position:38% line:89% align:start
But how?

00:18:07.655 --> 00:18:09.189 position:21% line:89% align:start
We will, don't worry.

00:18:10.925 --> 00:18:14.596 position:24% line:83% align:start
I promise you, it's
going to be okay.

00:18:14.629 --> 00:18:16.463 position:30% line:89% align:start
Please just go.

00:18:18.432 --> 00:18:19.433 position:47% line:89% align:start
Mm.

00:18:20.802 --> 00:18:22.036 position:30% line:89% align:start
Let's go, Emma.

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:25.105 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Emma whimpering)

00:18:31.144 --> 00:18:35.449 position:13% line:83% align:start
Draken, do you ever wonder
what it's like in heaven?

00:18:38.786 --> 00:18:39.754 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Draken scoffing)

00:18:39.787 --> 00:18:42.624 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Draken laughing)

00:18:47.795 --> 00:18:50.732 position:19% line:83% align:start
Don't you know you're
going to hell, dumbass?

00:18:50.765 --> 00:18:52.332 position:38% line:89% align:start
What for?

00:18:52.366 --> 00:18:55.268 position:13% line:83% align:start
I haven't done anything
bad enough to deserve that.

00:18:55.302 --> 00:18:57.772 position:24% line:83% align:start
Wow, I think these
two still want

00:18:57.805 --> 00:18:59.406 position:13% line:89% align:start
their asses beat some more.

00:18:59.439 --> 00:19:01.308 position:10% line:89% align:start
They're so freaking annoying.

00:19:02.677 --> 00:19:04.579 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] I've got
no feeling in the hand

00:19:04.612 --> 00:19:05.847 position:27% line:89% align:start
that got stabbed.

00:19:06.948 --> 00:19:08.850 position:7% line:89% align:start
And after choking out Kiyomasa,

00:19:09.717 --> 00:19:11.619 position:21% line:83% align:start
I can't even lift my
right arm anymore.

00:19:12.754 --> 00:19:15.623 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi grunting)

00:19:17.525 --> 00:19:19.127 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Draken] Could
probably knock you over

00:19:19.159 --> 00:19:21.896 position:24% line:83% align:start
with a finger right
now, Takemitchy.

00:19:21.929 --> 00:19:23.363 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Yeah, Draken?

00:19:23.397 --> 00:19:24.565 position:24% line:89% align:start
Look who's talking.

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:30.203 position:30% line:89% align:start
Kill 'em both!

00:19:30.237 --> 00:19:31.773 position:33% line:89% align:start
(men yelling)

00:19:31.806 --> 00:19:35.275 position:19% line:83% align:start
In the end, I couldn't
change the future.

00:19:35.308 --> 00:19:37.277 position:7% line:89% align:start
(Draken and Takemichi yelling)

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:40.515 position:10% line:89% align:start
But I did everything I could.

00:19:40.548 --> 00:19:43.183 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm not gonna look
down until it's over!

00:19:44.351 --> 00:19:45.787 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Akaishi laughing)

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:49.256 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-(Akkun yelling)

00:19:50.558 --> 00:19:53.360 position:27% line:89% align:start
(sword clanging)

00:19:54.227 --> 00:19:56.831 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Akaishi growling)

00:19:56.864 --> 00:19:59.399 position:16% line:83% align:start
The hell are you crying
for this time, Takemichi?

00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:03.203 position:33% line:89% align:start
Crybaby hero.

00:20:06.774 --> 00:20:08.543 position:33% line:89% align:start
Whoa, Akkun.

00:20:08.576 --> 00:20:09.577 position:44% line:89% align:start
But.

00:20:10.243 --> 00:20:11.546 position:38% line:89% align:start
You guys.

00:20:11.579 --> 00:20:14.048 position:24% line:83% align:start
The Ferocious Five
is in the house.

00:20:14.082 --> 00:20:16.984 position:30% line:89% align:start
(group yelling)

00:20:17.018 --> 00:20:19.520 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Akaishi growling)

00:20:19.554 --> 00:20:22.023 position:10% line:89% align:start
Hinata said you needed help.

00:20:22.056 --> 00:20:24.257 position:10% line:89% align:start
So now just leave this to us.

00:20:24.291 --> 00:20:25.893 position:21% line:83% align:start
You'll see we can
be tough as all hell

00:20:25.927 --> 00:20:26.928 position:24% line:89% align:start
when we need to be!

00:20:26.961 --> 00:20:28.328 position:19% line:89% align:start
Float like a butterfly.

00:20:28.361 --> 00:20:30.832 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, and then sting like a bee.

00:20:30.865 --> 00:20:33.868 position:30% line:89% align:start
(group yelling)

00:20:33.901 --> 00:20:36.436 position:30% line:89% align:start
(men grunting)

00:20:40.273 --> 00:20:42.442 position:21% line:83% align:start
All you did was give
us more to kick.

00:20:44.045 --> 00:20:45.680 position:10% line:89% align:start
So what are you gonna do now?

00:20:52.887 --> 00:20:55.422 position:24% line:89% align:start
Draken, I'm sorry.

00:20:55.455 --> 00:20:57.390 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Is that all you got?
-Hm?

00:20:58.025 --> 00:20:59.292 position:27% line:89% align:start
I really did try.

00:21:00.528 --> 00:21:02.395 position:10% line:89% align:start
But I just couldn't save you.

00:21:03.531 --> 00:21:04.532 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:21:05.499 --> 00:21:08.803 position:19% line:83% align:start
The truth is ever
since I came back here,

00:21:08.836 --> 00:21:10.270 position:21% line:89% align:start
nothing's gone right.

00:21:10.905 --> 00:21:11.873 position:30% line:89% align:start
(men grunting)

00:21:11.906 --> 00:21:13.306 position:44% line:89% align:start
But.

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:15.308 position:21% line:83% align:start
Quit being so useless
and get up and fight!

00:21:20.081 --> 00:21:21.215 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Akkun] Useless?

00:21:21.249 --> 00:21:22.216 position:30% line:89% align:start
(men grunting)

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:24.752 position:13% line:89% align:start
Yeah, it might be useless.

00:21:24.786 --> 00:21:26.788 position:30% line:89% align:start
(men grunting)

00:21:26.821 --> 00:21:28.956 position:27% line:89% align:start
(exciting music)

00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:30.490 position:7% line:89% align:start
Are you gonna fight me or not?

00:21:32.093 --> 00:21:33.895 position:24% line:89% align:start
But just the same.

00:21:33.928 --> 00:21:36.063 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm here, let's go!

00:21:36.097 --> 00:21:37.698 position:30% line:89% align:start
We give up now?

00:21:37.732 --> 00:21:38.733 position:41% line:89% align:start
No way!

00:21:40.935 --> 00:21:42.737 position:27% line:89% align:start
Right, Takemichi?

00:21:49.076 --> 00:21:52.547 position:24% line:89% align:start
(group snickering)

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:54.849 position:13% line:89% align:start
No way I'm gonna lose this!

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:03.891 position:10% line:89% align:start
(exciting music intensifying)

00:22:03.925 --> 00:22:05.026 position:27% line:89% align:start
(siren sounding)

00:22:05.059 --> 00:22:07.028 position:30% line:89% align:start
(men grunting)

00:22:07.061 --> 00:22:09.797 position:10% line:89% align:start
You guys, thank you for this!

00:22:11.999 --> 00:22:12.834 position:21% line:89% align:start
Because it looks like

00:22:14.367 --> 00:22:15.368 position:41% line:89% align:start
we won.

00:22:17.972 --> 00:22:20.541 position:21% line:89% align:start
(closing theme music)

00:22:27.215 --> 00:22:31.052 position:21% line:89% align:start
(singing in Japanese)
