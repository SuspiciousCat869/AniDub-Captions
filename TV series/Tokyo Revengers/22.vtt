(motorcycle engine revving)

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:16.551 position:21% line:5% align:start
[Baji] So, Mikey,
d'you tell everybody

00:00:16.584 --> 00:00:18.285 position:19% line:5% align:start
to meet at the shrine?

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:20.354 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Mikey] Yeah, but
more importantly,

00:00:20.387 --> 00:00:22.489 position:13% line:89% align:start
how's your new junior high?

00:00:22.524 --> 00:00:24.959 position:30% line:5% align:start
(sighs) Boring!

00:00:24.993 --> 00:00:27.294 position:21% line:5% align:start
No one there's got
any damn guts at all.

00:00:27.327 --> 00:00:30.297 position:10% line:5% align:start
If I went to your junior high
school you'd never be bored.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.032 position:24% line:5% align:start
It's so cool to
have a motorcycle!

00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:35.637 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's a GSX250E, right?

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.740 position:19% line:83% align:start
Great job fixin' it
up, musta took awhile.

00:00:38.773 --> 00:00:39.841 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yeah, it did!

00:00:39.874 --> 00:00:42.342 position:24% line:83% align:start
It was pretty rough
when I got it.

00:00:42.376 --> 00:00:45.479 position:10% line:83% align:start
But I found a bunch of people
who could get me used parts.

00:00:46.981 --> 00:00:48.783 position:13% line:89% align:start
(motorcycle engine revving)

00:00:48.816 --> 00:00:50.752 position:21% line:83% align:start
Now it's the coolest
250 in Tokyo!

00:00:52.286 --> 00:00:54.956 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hmph, it's the
coolest in Tokyo, huh?

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.959 position:21% line:5% align:start
Well my Zephyr's the
best in all o' Japan.

00:00:57.992 --> 00:00:59.894 position:13% line:5% align:start
(motorcycle engine revving)

00:00:59.928 --> 00:01:01.663 position:44% line:5% align:start
Huh?

00:01:01.696 --> 00:01:03.230 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hey, hey, hey, now.

00:01:03.263 --> 00:01:04.431 position:10% line:89% align:start
You wanna talk shit like that

00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:05.934 position:24% line:83% align:start
don't try doin'
it in front of me!

00:01:05.967 --> 00:01:09.737 position:10% line:5% align:start
My Impulse here is the best
bike in the world, my friend.

00:01:09.771 --> 00:01:11.405 position:7% line:5% align:start
You're all thinkin' too small.

00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:13.407 position:10% line:5% align:start
-(motorcycle engine revving)
-Hm?

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.109 position:10% line:83% align:start
(laughs) Whattayou guys even
got worth fightin' about

00:01:16.143 --> 00:01:19.179 position:13% line:83% align:start
when you're all still
stuck here on planet Earth?

00:01:19.212 --> 00:01:22.416 position:21% line:5% align:start
My Rocket's the best
bike in the universe!

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:24.451 position:13% line:5% align:start
(motorcycle engine revving)

00:01:24.484 --> 00:01:28.188 position:7% line:5% align:start
[Baji] Ha, so you little shits
finally grew some pubes eh?

00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:30.090 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Draken] Huh, look
who's talkin'.

00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:33.460 position:19% line:83% align:start
Whoa I'm getting
really sleepy. (sighs)

00:01:35.063 --> 00:01:36.598 position:13% line:89% align:start
(motorcycle engine revving)

00:01:36.631 --> 00:01:37.799 position:44% line:5% align:start
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:01:37.832 --> 00:01:40.635 position:10% line:5% align:start
My CBX400F's the best of all!

00:01:40.668 --> 00:01:42.135 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's a race to the shrine!

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.439 position:27% line:83% align:start
Damn you, that's
not a fair race!

00:01:45.472 --> 00:01:47.675 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's cheating and you
damn well know it, Pah!

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:49.443 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'll beat you anyway!

00:01:49.476 --> 00:01:52.647 position:19% line:83% align:start
Last one there's gonna
get his ass kicked!

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.848 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Mikey snoring)

00:01:53.881 --> 00:01:55.349 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, What the hell are you doing

00:01:55.382 --> 00:01:57.250 position:19% line:89% align:start
falling asleep, Mikey?

00:01:57.284 --> 00:01:59.654 position:21% line:83% align:start
Wake up, you're gonna
fall off, you dumbass!

00:01:59.687 --> 00:02:01.221 position:30% line:89% align:start
Mikey, wake up!

00:02:03.223 --> 00:02:08.161 position:21% line:89% align:start
(opening theme music)

00:03:36.718 --> 00:03:39.252 position:30% line:5% align:start
(Baji groaning)

00:03:43.157 --> 00:03:44.357 position:38% line:89% align:start
Damn it!

00:03:49.597 --> 00:03:51.966 position:7% line:89% align:start
Thanks a lot for all the help.

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:53.601 position:21% line:89% align:start
Took ya long enough.

00:03:53.634 --> 00:03:54.802 position:27% line:89% align:start
You're dead last.

00:03:54.836 --> 00:03:56.504 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's not my fault,

00:03:56.537 --> 00:03:59.272 position:10% line:83% align:start
he was dead asleep on my back
the whole time, passed out!

00:03:59.306 --> 00:04:02.309 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Excuses much?
-Yeah, pretty lame, dude.

00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:03.811 position:21% line:89% align:start
Easy for you to say!

00:04:03.845 --> 00:04:06.346 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hm, are we here?

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:08.950 position:16% line:83% align:start
So what'd you want to
talk to us about, Mikey?

00:04:12.486 --> 00:04:15.322 position:10% line:83% align:start
There's a gang called the
Black Dragons, heard of 'em?

00:04:16.456 --> 00:04:17.692 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yeah I've heard of 'em

00:04:17.725 --> 00:04:19.861 position:19% line:83% align:start
and I also heard that
they're brutal as hell.

00:04:19.894 --> 00:04:21.562 position:13% line:89% align:start
Three years older than us.

00:04:21.596 --> 00:04:22.597 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mm-hmm.

00:04:25.298 --> 00:04:27.969 position:19% line:83% align:start
Why didn't you come and
talk to us, Kazutora?

00:04:30.138 --> 00:04:32.607 position:24% line:83% align:start
Instead I had to
hear it from Baji.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.075 position:21% line:83% align:start
You've been fighting
the Black Dragons

00:04:34.108 --> 00:04:35.543 position:16% line:89% align:start
on your own, haven't you?

00:04:35.576 --> 00:04:38.278 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Takashi] What? Kazutora got
into it with the Black Dragons?

00:04:38.311 --> 00:04:39.279 position:41% line:89% align:start
No way!

00:04:39.312 --> 00:04:40.782 position:27% line:89% align:start
He can't help it.

00:04:40.815 --> 00:04:44.317 position:7% line:83% align:start
I guess Kazutora lives right
inside the Black Dragons' turf

00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:46.486 position:19% line:89% align:start
I see what's happening.

00:04:46.521 --> 00:04:48.689 position:13% line:83% align:start
Hey, Wait a minute, you're
not planning to throw down

00:04:48.723 --> 00:04:51.559 position:19% line:83% align:start
against the Black
Dragons are you, Mikey?

00:04:51.592 --> 00:04:52.527 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yup.

00:04:53.895 --> 00:04:56.831 position:13% line:83% align:start
But these guys are the
real deal, that's for sure.

00:04:56.864 --> 00:04:59.299 position:19% line:83% align:start
So we're gonna need a
good reason to do this.

00:05:01.536 --> 00:05:04.172 position:19% line:89% align:start
Hey, I've got an idea.

00:05:04.205 --> 00:05:06.306 position:21% line:83% align:start
Let's just start our
own gang, you guys!

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:09.143 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-A biker gang, just us?

00:05:09.177 --> 00:05:10.310 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hell yeah!

00:05:10.343 --> 00:05:11.579 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:05:11.612 --> 00:05:14.414 position:10% line:89% align:start
Hey, that sounds good to me.

00:05:14.447 --> 00:05:16.851 position:16% line:83% align:start
And we already know
everyone's position too.

00:05:18.451 --> 00:05:20.320 position:21% line:83% align:start
Our commander's gonna
be the invincible,

00:05:20.353 --> 00:05:22.089 position:16% line:89% align:start
cocky little shit, Mikey!

00:05:22.123 --> 00:05:24.457 position:13% line:89% align:start
Aw, you're making me blush.

00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:25.993 position:10% line:89% align:start
Our vice commander's gonna be

00:05:26.027 --> 00:05:28.395 position:7% line:89% align:start
our dependable big bro, Draken!

00:05:29.664 --> 00:05:33.000 position:7% line:83% align:start
Our mediator, Takashi Mitsuya,
will command our elite guard!

00:05:34.367 --> 00:05:37.404 position:19% line:83% align:start
Our powerhouse, Pah,
will carry our banner!

00:05:37.437 --> 00:05:40.407 position:19% line:83% align:start
And alongside me as our
attack unit, Kazutora.

00:05:44.045 --> 00:05:48.249 position:19% line:83% align:start
Okay, but guys, are you
sure you wanna do this?

00:05:48.282 --> 00:05:50.952 position:19% line:83% align:start
I've already decided
on our new gang's name.

00:05:50.985 --> 00:05:52.587 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Yeah, what is it, dude?
-Huh?

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.723 position:5% line:89% align:start
We'll be the Tokyo Manjiro Gang!

00:05:55.756 --> 00:05:56.624 position:30% line:89% align:start
[All] So lame!

00:05:57.558 --> 00:05:58.993 position:13% line:89% align:start
Well that's a stupid name.

00:05:59.026 --> 00:06:00.393 position:19% line:89% align:start
But on the bright side,

00:06:00.427 --> 00:06:02.597 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm definitely down with
the idea of starting a gang.

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.732 position:13% line:89% align:start
Yeah, well that's a start.

00:06:04.765 --> 00:06:06.701 position:13% line:83% align:start
I guess your point is that
if we had our own gang

00:06:06.734 --> 00:06:08.536 position:21% line:83% align:start
then we'd have a good
reason to throw down

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:11.739 position:19% line:83% align:start
with the Black Dragons,
even with a sucky name.

00:06:11.772 --> 00:06:12.807 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Mikey] Ouch!

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.976 position:19% line:83% align:start
Starting up a gang
sounds super exciting!

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:16.844 position:16% line:89% align:start
But that name does suck.

00:06:16.878 --> 00:06:18.378 position:30% line:89% align:start
You guys suck!

00:06:18.411 --> 00:06:20.214 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well, then I guess it's settled.

00:06:20.248 --> 00:06:21.448 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:06:25.186 --> 00:06:26.654 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:06:26.687 --> 00:06:30.258 position:16% line:83% align:start
We're willing to give you
everything that we've got.

00:06:30.291 --> 00:06:32.927 position:24% line:83% align:start
Create this new
age for us, Mikey.

00:06:36.264 --> 00:06:38.398 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right!

00:06:38.431 --> 00:06:40.368 position:21% line:83% align:start
What kind of gang do
you guys wanna have?

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.503 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hm, let's see...

00:06:43.671 --> 00:06:46.406 position:21% line:83% align:start
The kind that I want
is the kind of gang

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:48.809 position:16% line:83% align:start
where we can all risk
our lives for each other,

00:06:48.843 --> 00:06:50.011 position:27% line:89% align:start
every one of us!

00:06:52.613 --> 00:06:55.349 position:13% line:83% align:start
Hey, let's buy some charms
to make this official!

00:06:55.383 --> 00:06:57.518 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Yeah, good idea!
-All right, let's do it!

00:07:04.491 --> 00:07:07.695 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hey hurry up, you guys,
what're you waiting for?

00:07:07.728 --> 00:07:09.196 position:10% line:89% align:start
Come on before they run out!

00:07:14.402 --> 00:07:17.104 position:10% line:89% align:start
Damn, guys, that's expensive.

00:07:18.773 --> 00:07:20.107 position:38% line:89% align:start
313 yen.

00:07:20.141 --> 00:07:22.576 position:38% line:83% align:start
-50 yen.
-100 yen.

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.212 position:38% line:83% align:start
-15 yen.
-25 yen.

00:07:25.246 --> 00:07:26.446 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takashi] 32 yen.

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:28.582 position:27% line:89% align:start
(bikers sighing)

00:07:28.616 --> 00:07:31.819 position:10% line:83% align:start
Oh you gotta be shittin' me,
none of us can afford one!

00:07:31.852 --> 00:07:33.554 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yeah, maybe not.

00:07:33.587 --> 00:07:36.524 position:16% line:83% align:start
But if we all pitch in,
we'll be able to buy one.

00:07:38.491 --> 00:07:39.492 position:27% line:89% align:start
(bikers gasping)

00:07:45.399 --> 00:07:48.102 position:24% line:83% align:start
You should hold on
to it for us, Baji.

00:07:48.135 --> 00:07:49.570 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's right.

00:07:49.603 --> 00:07:51.973 position:13% line:83% align:start
You're the reason we formed
the gang in the first place.

00:07:52.006 --> 00:07:53.374 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yeah, that's good.

00:07:53.407 --> 00:07:54.875 position:19% line:89% align:start
Take care of it for us.

00:07:56.077 --> 00:07:58.512 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:08:02.216 --> 00:08:03.684 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'll take good care of it.

00:08:04.752 --> 00:08:07.989 position:7% line:89% align:start
Count on me, that's a promise.

00:08:08.022 --> 00:08:10.658 position:30% line:89% align:start
(somber music)

00:08:15.863 --> 00:08:18.866 position:24% line:83% align:start
And here it is,
this is the charm.

00:08:21.369 --> 00:08:24.438 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi sobbing)

00:08:24.472 --> 00:08:26.173 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm not the one
who created Toman.

00:08:28.142 --> 00:08:29.176 position:33% line:89% align:start
It was Baji.

00:08:32.713 --> 00:08:36.951 position:13% line:83% align:start
If one of us gets hurt,
the rest of us protect him.

00:08:36.984 --> 00:08:40.354 position:13% line:83% align:start
We wanted to be a gang
that protected one another.

00:08:40.388 --> 00:08:43.557 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's the kind of gang we
promised each other we would be.

00:08:46.727 --> 00:08:49.163 position:16% line:89% align:start
Baji was fighting, (sobs)

00:08:50.564 --> 00:08:52.633 position:24% line:83% align:start
fighting all on his
own this whole time!

00:08:52.666 --> 00:08:56.303 position:27% line:83% align:start
All to keep that
promise! (sniffs)

00:08:56.337 --> 00:08:59.540 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi sobbing)

00:09:02.209 --> 00:09:04.078 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry Baji, I failed.

00:09:11.819 --> 00:09:14.021 position:27% line:83% align:start
-(sirens blaring)
-Uh oh.

00:09:14.055 --> 00:09:15.589 position:30% line:89% align:start
Popo's coming.

00:09:15.623 --> 00:09:17.858 position:5% line:89% align:start
Come on, boys, we're outta here.

00:09:19.627 --> 00:09:20.795 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yo, ever'body out!

00:09:20.828 --> 00:09:22.329 position:16% line:89% align:start
Get lost, scatter, scram!

00:09:33.641 --> 00:09:35.776 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Kazutora] I'm gonna
stay with Baji.

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:37.344 position:13% line:89% align:start
You should get out of here.

00:09:39.246 --> 00:09:40.648 position:30% line:89% align:start
Why, Kazutora?

00:09:41.782 --> 00:09:43.751 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm responsible for all of this.

00:09:44.618 --> 00:09:47.021 position:24% line:83% align:start
I want to be the
one to pay for it.

00:09:49.457 --> 00:09:50.724 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Mikey] All right then.

00:09:56.897 --> 00:09:58.866 position:7% line:89% align:start
Gotta go Toman, everybody out!

00:09:58.899 --> 00:10:00.301 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Got it, Draken.
-Right!

00:10:02.636 --> 00:10:05.072 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:10:06.774 --> 00:10:09.944 position:21% line:89% align:start
(gang member sobbing)

00:10:19.987 --> 00:10:20.788 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mikey!

00:10:22.656 --> 00:10:25.126 position:7% line:89% align:start
I know I can never be forgiven.

00:10:25.159 --> 00:10:28.762 position:21% line:83% align:start
Not about Shinichiro,
and not, about Baji.

00:10:30.264 --> 00:10:34.969 position:7% line:83% align:start
But it's a burden I'll have
to carry, the rest of my life.

00:10:36.337 --> 00:10:38.739 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:11:13.874 --> 00:11:17.144 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] On
October 31st, 2005

00:11:17.178 --> 00:11:20.781 position:24% line:83% align:start
150 members of the
Tokyo Manji Gang

00:11:20.814 --> 00:11:22.983 position:7% line:89% align:start
fought 300 members of Valhalla.

00:11:24.318 --> 00:11:27.121 position:16% line:83% align:start
The conflict, which
ended in Toman's victory,

00:11:27.154 --> 00:11:30.191 position:19% line:83% align:start
resulted in one
death, and one arrest.

00:11:31.859 --> 00:11:35.362 position:10% line:83% align:start
And eventually, the conflict
would come to be known as,

00:11:35.396 --> 00:11:36.897 position:21% line:89% align:start
The Bloody Halloween.

00:12:02.691 --> 00:12:05.159 position:19% line:83% align:start
I brought you some just
like you asked me to,

00:12:05.192 --> 00:12:05.993 position:30% line:89% align:start
it's still hot.

00:12:10.264 --> 00:12:12.199 position:16% line:89% align:start
Chifuyu, I could sure go

00:12:12.233 --> 00:12:14.902 position:24% line:83% align:start
for some Peyang
yakisoba about now.

00:12:16.737 --> 00:12:19.740 position:21% line:89% align:start
Let's split it, kay?

00:12:22.443 --> 00:12:24.878 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's what we did the
first time we met, too.

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:27.281 position:33% line:89% align:start
We split it.

00:12:34.888 --> 00:12:36.757 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Teacher] Starting today,
and if you do well,

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:38.125 position:16% line:89% align:start
for the next three years,

00:12:38.158 --> 00:12:40.060 position:21% line:83% align:start
all of you will
have the great honor

00:12:40.094 --> 00:12:41.762 position:21% line:83% align:start
to be students at
this esteemed school.

00:12:41.795 --> 00:12:43.163 position:24% line:89% align:start
(student grunting)

00:12:43.197 --> 00:12:45.667 position:13% line:83% align:start
I expect each and every one
of you to do your very best,

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:46.867 position:24% line:89% align:start
(student grunting)

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:48.802 position:21% line:83% align:start
in both academics and
in club activities.

00:12:48.836 --> 00:12:50.137 position:24% line:89% align:start
(student grunting)

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:52.707 position:10% line:83% align:start
We trust that you will leave
here far more dignified

00:12:52.741 --> 00:12:55.376 position:16% line:83% align:start
and more respectful than
when you first came.

00:12:55.409 --> 00:12:58.779 position:24% line:89% align:start
(student groaning)

00:12:58.812 --> 00:13:01.782 position:19% line:5% align:start
Yeah well, respect
stuff's not happening,

00:13:01.815 --> 00:13:03.050 position:24% line:5% align:start
not even a little.

00:13:04.218 --> 00:13:06.353 position:24% line:83% align:start
'cause I'm the most
important guy here.

00:13:06.387 --> 00:13:08.956 position:33% line:89% align:start
(rock music)

00:13:09.923 --> 00:13:12.761 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're so freaking
awesome, Chifuyu!

00:13:12.793 --> 00:13:14.928 position:19% line:83% align:start
Teachers don't seem to
intimidate you at all.

00:13:14.962 --> 00:13:16.631 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yeah, man, you could
probably take over

00:13:16.665 --> 00:13:18.465 position:27% line:83% align:start
the whole country
if you wanted to!

00:13:18.499 --> 00:13:22.236 position:5% line:83% align:start
You dumbass, I ain't
interested in any of that shit.

00:13:22.269 --> 00:13:25.839 position:16% line:83% align:start
The older delinquents are
all lame nowadays, anyway.

00:13:25.873 --> 00:13:27.875 position:21% line:83% align:start
That's why being one
isn't cool anymore.

00:13:30.679 --> 00:13:33.914 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:13:33.947 --> 00:13:37.151 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hey, Chifuyu, check
out what we just heard!

00:13:37.184 --> 00:13:38.285 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:13:38.319 --> 00:13:40.854 position:13% line:83% align:start
There's a new kid in Class
3 that got held back!

00:13:40.888 --> 00:13:42.323 position:19% line:89% align:start
And he's a first-year!

00:13:42.356 --> 00:13:46.260 position:16% line:83% align:start
Stop it, you can get
held back in junior high?

00:13:46.293 --> 00:13:47.227 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right!

00:13:47.261 --> 00:13:49.897 position:16% line:83% align:start
He's gotta be some insane
kind of delinquent!

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:51.098 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yeah, all right.

00:13:52.433 --> 00:13:54.502 position:24% line:83% align:start
Well then, guess I
better let him know

00:13:54.536 --> 00:13:56.236 position:13% line:89% align:start
who's the boss around here.

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:57.905 position:7% line:89% align:start
Whoa, you don't leave any doubt

00:13:57.938 --> 00:14:00.107 position:19% line:83% align:start
about who's on top
here, do you, Chifuyu?

00:14:02.711 --> 00:14:03.911 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hey you.

00:14:05.112 --> 00:14:07.448 position:7% line:89% align:start
Which one's Baji, the new kid?

00:14:07.481 --> 00:14:09.450 position:47% line:89% align:start
Uh.

00:14:09.483 --> 00:14:11.051 position:30% line:89% align:start
Huh, that guy?

00:14:17.391 --> 00:14:18.859 position:33% line:83% align:start
-That's him?
-Yeah.

00:14:18.892 --> 00:14:20.127 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Chifuyu] Seriously?

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.830 position:19% line:83% align:start
The four-eyes with
the slicked-back hair?

00:14:21.862 --> 00:14:22.831 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Student] Mm-hmm.

00:14:22.863 --> 00:14:24.733 position:7% line:89% align:start
They held back a guy like him?

00:14:24.766 --> 00:14:27.000 position:21% line:83% align:start
Betcha 100 yen his
parents made him quit

00:14:27.034 --> 00:14:28.469 position:16% line:89% align:start
to work as an errand boy.

00:14:28.503 --> 00:14:31.004 position:19% line:83% align:start
100 yen says he's a
scared lonely shut-in.

00:14:31.038 --> 00:14:32.674 position:13% line:89% align:start
10 says he just quit coming

00:14:32.707 --> 00:14:34.341 position:24% line:83% align:start
because he thought
school was stupid.

00:14:35.744 --> 00:14:38.445 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm outta here, this
is a waste of time.

00:14:56.631 --> 00:14:59.634 position:27% line:83% align:start
I see, so that's
what that means.

00:15:00.835 --> 00:15:02.136 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:15:02.169 --> 00:15:03.170 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:15:05.372 --> 00:15:06.140 position:35% line:89% align:start
Who're you?

00:15:06.173 --> 00:15:09.076 position:10% line:89% align:start
Chifuyu Matsuno from Class 1.

00:15:09.109 --> 00:15:10.911 position:13% line:89% align:start
Never heard've ya, Chifuyu.

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:13.882 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Tell me, nerd.
-Huh?

00:15:13.914 --> 00:15:15.416 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Chifuyu] What's
this s'posed to be?

00:15:15.449 --> 00:15:18.385 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Baji] That's
"Tora," for "tiger".

00:15:18.419 --> 00:15:19.754 position:27% line:89% align:start
Well it's wrong.

00:15:19.788 --> 00:15:21.021 position:41% line:89% align:start
No way!

00:15:21.054 --> 00:15:23.858 position:19% line:83% align:start
I coulda sworn I had
that one exactly right!

00:15:23.892 --> 00:15:24.859 position:30% line:89% align:start
What the hell?

00:15:24.893 --> 00:15:26.528 position:7% line:89% align:start
Why're you dressed like a nerd

00:15:26.561 --> 00:15:27.896 position:5% line:89% align:start
when you can't even write tiger?

00:15:27.928 --> 00:15:31.298 position:16% line:83% align:start
Tora, oh, this can't
happen, I can't go back!

00:15:31.331 --> 00:15:32.366 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Chifuyu] Huh?

00:15:32.399 --> 00:15:34.602 position:24% line:83% align:start
I can't let them
hold me back again.

00:15:34.636 --> 00:15:36.403 position:19% line:89% align:start
It'd break Mom's heart!

00:15:36.437 --> 00:15:38.640 position:19% line:89% align:start
(chuckles) So serious.

00:15:43.711 --> 00:15:45.780 position:27% line:89% align:start
This is "tiger".

00:15:45.814 --> 00:15:47.181 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh!

00:15:47.214 --> 00:15:49.517 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hey thank you,
you're a good guy!

00:15:49.551 --> 00:15:53.521 position:10% line:83% align:start
(chuckles) So, what's this
you're tryin' to write here?

00:15:53.555 --> 00:15:55.222 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Well it's, uh...
-Huh?

00:15:57.525 --> 00:15:58.292 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's a friendship letter.

00:15:58.325 --> 00:15:59.293 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:15:59.326 --> 00:16:00.762 position:13% line:89% align:start
To a pen pal, that's gross!

00:16:00.795 --> 00:16:03.798 position:7% line:83% align:start
You shut up! It's none of your
damn business who I write to!

00:16:03.832 --> 00:16:05.299 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'll murder you!

00:16:05.332 --> 00:16:08.101 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Chifuyu] (chuckles )Okay
okay, hot-head, chill out.

00:16:08.135 --> 00:16:09.737 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh hey, you got
this one wrong too.

00:16:09.771 --> 00:16:11.004 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Baji] Huh? Seriously?

00:16:15.042 --> 00:16:18.479 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Friend] Yo, what're you
spacin' out about, Chifuyu?

00:16:18.513 --> 00:16:19.747 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Chifuyu] Huh?

00:16:19.781 --> 00:16:22.584 position:13% line:83% align:start
Oh, I'm just still thinking
about that nerd I met.

00:16:22.617 --> 00:16:23.984 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Friend] Huh? Why?

00:16:24.017 --> 00:16:27.988 position:19% line:83% align:start
You'll forget about him
by tomorrow. (laughs)

00:16:31.024 --> 00:16:33.427 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Hey, Matsuno!
-Huh?

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:35.763 position:27% line:89% align:start
(bikers laughing)

00:16:35.797 --> 00:16:37.297 position:21% line:89% align:start
Listen here, jackass,

00:16:37.331 --> 00:16:39.734 position:13% line:83% align:start
Where d'you get off
stompin' on my homeboy here

00:16:39.767 --> 00:16:41.068 position:13% line:89% align:start
without my permission, huh?

[Gang Member]
You're finished now!

00:16:48.008 --> 00:16:49.176 position:10% line:89% align:start
You're gonna see what happens

00:16:49.209 --> 00:16:51.411 position:24% line:83% align:start
to anyone who
defies us, Matsuno!

00:16:53.113 --> 00:16:55.850 position:5% line:83% align:start
You are gonna learn some
manners and some respect today!

00:16:55.884 --> 00:16:57.785 position:13% line:89% align:start
And oh it's gonna hurt too!

00:16:58.620 --> 00:16:59.854 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:16:59.888 --> 00:17:02.189 position:33% line:89% align:start

00:17:04.626 --> 00:17:06.628 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh, I am so sorry!

00:17:06.661 --> 00:17:07.829 position:16% line:89% align:start
I was trying to greet you

00:17:07.862 --> 00:17:09.797 position:24% line:83% align:start
and I hit you with
my head instead.

00:17:10.899 --> 00:17:12.332 position:38% line:89% align:start
But you?

00:17:12.366 --> 00:17:14.301 position:19% line:83% align:start
Ambushing somebody
with eight against one?

00:17:14.334 --> 00:17:17.337 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hmph, biker gang, my ass!

00:17:19.373 --> 00:17:20.708 position:38% line:89% align:start

(gang members

00:17:41.495 --> 00:17:44.431 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm not gonna be able to hold
out much longer on my own...

00:17:52.172 --> 00:17:54.742 position:19% line:83% align:start
End of the line, gonna
crack yer head open!

00:17:54.776 --> 00:17:56.143 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Chifuyu Voiceover] Oh shit!

00:17:57.011 --> 00:17:59.013 position:10% line:89% align:start
Eight of you against one kid?

00:17:59.047 --> 00:18:01.081 position:21% line:83% align:start
And armed no less,
how lame can you get?

00:18:01.114 --> 00:18:03.317 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Gang Leader] Ugh,

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:05.085 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Chifuyu] Is that you, Nerd?!

00:18:05.118 --> 00:18:07.321 position:21% line:83% align:start

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:10.390 position:24% line:83% align:start
What the hell're

00:18:10.424 --> 00:18:12.894 position:19% line:83% align:start
As a thank-you I'll
help you out with this!

00:18:12.927 --> 00:18:14.862 position:7% line:89% align:start
No, dumbass, that's a bad idea!

00:18:20.434 --> 00:18:21.435 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:18:21.468 --> 00:18:23.871 position:24% line:83% align:start
You knocked him out
cold with one punch!

00:18:23.905 --> 00:18:25.105 position:33% line:89% align:start
Who are you?

00:18:26.741 --> 00:18:30.143 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm the Tokyo Manji Gang's
First Division Captain.

00:18:31.646 --> 00:18:33.881 position:27% line:89% align:start

(rock music)

00:18:40.187 --> 00:18:42.890 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Chifuyu Voiceover] No
way, he took 'em all out,

00:18:42.924 --> 00:18:44.157 position:30% line:89% align:start
all by himself?

00:18:45.927 --> 00:18:48.096 position:16% line:89% align:start
Listen up, you assholes!

00:18:48.128 --> 00:18:49.631 position:24% line:83% align:start
When somebody hurts
one of our guys,

00:18:49.664 --> 00:18:51.633 position:21% line:83% align:start
the Tokyo Manji gang
comes after 'em with

00:18:51.666 --> 00:18:54.636 position:21% line:83% align:start
everything we've
got and crushes 'em!

00:18:54.669 --> 00:18:56.771 position:27% line:89% align:start
So remember that.

00:18:56.804 --> 00:18:58.338 position:13% line:89% align:start
This guy here is my friend.

00:19:00.708 --> 00:19:02.409 position:24% line:89% align:start
Lay a hand on him,

00:19:02.442 --> 00:19:05.647 position:16% line:83% align:start
and next time I'll
destroy your whole gang!

'Kay, got it!

[Chifuyu Voiceover]
This is the first person

00:19:26.299 --> 00:19:27.935 position:7% line:89% align:start
I've ever had any respect for!

00:19:29.269 --> 00:19:31.639 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yes, I would sir!

00:19:33.074 --> 00:19:36.209 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Baji] I live here, on the
fifth floor, stop by sometime.

00:19:36.243 --> 00:19:38.478 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Chifuyu] Really, I live
here too, on the second!

00:19:38.513 --> 00:19:40.480 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Baji] Ha, well whattya know?

00:19:40.515 --> 00:19:41.949 position:10% line:89% align:start
We live in the same building.

00:19:41.983 --> 00:19:43.051 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Chifuyu] Yeah!

00:19:43.084 --> 00:19:44.184 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Chifuyu Voiceover]
The first person

00:19:44.217 --> 00:19:45.853 position:16% line:89% align:start
I ever thought was cool,

00:19:45.887 --> 00:19:48.556 position:13% line:83% align:start
and the first person I ever
had any desire to follow

00:19:49.657 --> 00:19:51.793 position:27% line:89% align:start
was Keisuke Baji.

00:19:51.826 --> 00:19:53.360 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Baji] Hi Mom, I'm home.

00:19:54.361 --> 00:19:56.864 position:21% line:83% align:start
Huh, are you kidding,
we only have one left!

00:19:56.898 --> 00:19:58.166 position:44% line:89% align:start
Mom!

00:19:58.198 --> 00:20:00.500 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Chifuyu] It's okay, I-
I don't really need one.

00:20:00.535 --> 00:20:01.502 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:20:01.536 --> 00:20:03.303 position:7% line:89% align:start
Hey, let's you and I split it.

00:20:07.075 --> 00:20:09.911 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Chifuyu sobbing)

00:20:11.546 --> 00:20:12.647 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh Baji!

00:20:13.881 --> 00:20:17.719 position:16% line:89% align:start
Thanks so much, Chifuyu.

00:20:19.087 --> 00:20:21.856 position:24% line:83% align:start
You shouldn't have
said thank you!

00:20:21.889 --> 00:20:25.358 position:10% line:89% align:start
That just wasn't fair! (sobs)

00:20:25.392 --> 00:20:28.261 position:13% line:83% align:start
How the hell am I supposed
to go on now without you?

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:33.400 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:37.839 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:55.857 position:13% line:83% align:start
I was told to expect to be
in here at least 10 years.

00:20:57.825 --> 00:20:59.326 position:16% line:89% align:start
But is even that enough?

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.163 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm not running away.

00:21:02.196 --> 00:21:04.766 position:5% line:89% align:start
I need to face up to what I did.

00:21:04.799 --> 00:21:08.569 position:19% line:83% align:start
At least I learned that
much from him, and...

00:21:10.437 --> 00:21:13.908 position:10% line:83% align:start
So this time, I'm going to
actually do the right thing.

00:21:16.309 --> 00:21:18.913 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Draken] Don't kill
yourself, Kazutora.

(Kazutora gasps)

00:21:22.817 --> 00:21:23.918 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Kazutora] How did you?

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:27.287 position:21% line:89% align:start
I know what you meant

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.524 position:13% line:83% align:start
because I know what
you're thinking right now.

00:21:29.557 --> 00:21:30.725 position:13% line:89% align:start
And I'll never forgive you

00:21:30.758 --> 00:21:33.426 position:16% line:83% align:start
if you take your own life
to try to make amends.

00:21:37.665 --> 00:21:41.736 position:16% line:83% align:start
But I just, I don't
know what else there is.

00:21:41.769 --> 00:21:42.837 position:24% line:89% align:start
What else can I do?

00:21:45.673 --> 00:21:47.208 position:10% line:89% align:start
I have a message from Mikey.

00:21:47.241 --> 00:21:48.441 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:21:50.211 --> 00:21:51.913 position:10% line:89% align:start
He told me to tell you this:

00:21:54.414 --> 00:21:56.383 position:7% line:89% align:start
"You're still a part of Toman."

00:22:02.924 --> 00:22:06.326 position:19% line:83% align:start
This is what you wanted
me to do, isn't it?

00:22:06.359 --> 00:22:07.360 position:35% line:89% align:start
Huh, Baji?

00:22:09.462 --> 00:22:11.999 position:21% line:89% align:start
"And I forgive you."

00:22:14.302 --> 00:22:16.971 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Kazutora sobs)

00:22:18.471 --> 00:22:23.476 position:21% line:89% align:start
