00:00:08.977 --> 00:00:12.012 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll help you do that, Kazutora.

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:13.848 position:19% line:89% align:start
Hold on just a second!

00:00:13.882 --> 00:00:15.115 position:44% line:89% align:start
Baji!

00:00:15.148 --> 00:00:17.050 position:13% line:83% align:start
You're one of the
founding members of Toman,

00:00:17.084 --> 00:00:19.119 position:27% line:83% align:start
along with Mikey,
isn't that right?

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:20.722 position:13% line:89% align:start
Why are you betraying them?

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:24.124 position:13% line:89% align:start
You know nothing about it.

00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:27.394 position:13% line:83% align:start
If you did you'd know he's
a founding member too.

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:28.228 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:00:29.731 --> 00:00:32.032 position:35% line:89% align:start
(chuckles)

00:00:32.065 --> 00:00:34.536 position:21% line:83% align:start
Kazutora has an old
grudge against Toman.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.872 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'll never forget it.

00:00:37.906 --> 00:00:40.040 position:24% line:89% align:start
The summer of 2003,

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:42.242 position:19% line:83% align:start
when I was a first-year
in middle school.

00:00:42.276 --> 00:00:43.578 position:21% line:89% align:start
We were running wild.

00:00:44.812 --> 00:00:46.748 position:10% line:89% align:start
It was the middle of summer,

00:00:46.781 --> 00:00:48.415 position:21% line:83% align:start
but it was a
slightly chilly day.

00:00:50.919 --> 00:00:53.655 position:30% line:89% align:start
(motor revving)

00:01:05.098 --> 00:01:07.067 position:21% line:89% align:start
Beach time, bitches!

00:01:10.103 --> 00:01:11.606 position:27% line:89% align:start
Damn this rocks!

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:12.707 position:35% line:89% align:start
So amazing!

00:01:13.942 --> 00:01:16.076 position:21% line:83% align:start
Man that ocean
breeze feels so good!

00:01:19.781 --> 00:01:20.748 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hey grandpa!

00:01:20.782 --> 00:01:22.416 position:16% line:89% align:start
Why ya gotta go so slow?

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:25.053 position:27% line:83% align:start
What the hell am
I s'posed to do?

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:27.120 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's not my fault
he's so damn slow.

00:01:34.796 --> 00:01:36.263 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Unison] Hurry it up, Mikey!

00:01:43.705 --> 00:01:47.875 position:21% line:89% align:start
(opening theme music)

00:03:13.226 --> 00:03:14.629 position:33% line:5% align:start
Mikey, dude.

00:03:14.662 --> 00:03:17.799 position:21% line:5% align:start
You gotta quit tryin'
to rock that moped.

00:03:17.832 --> 00:03:19.499 position:21% line:5% align:start
You're our commander.

00:03:19.534 --> 00:03:21.669 position:7% line:89% align:start
Get a real motorcycle already.

00:03:21.703 --> 00:03:23.303 position:33% line:89% align:start
Nah, thanks.

00:03:23.336 --> 00:03:25.305 position:24% line:83% align:start
But my old ride
suits me just fine!

00:03:25.338 --> 00:03:27.709 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're not tryin' to
shit on my Street Hawk?

00:03:27.742 --> 00:03:30.277 position:21% line:89% align:start
My CB250T 50cc Model.

00:03:31.244 --> 00:03:33.181 position:24% line:83% align:start
Man you can call it
anything you want.

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:35.348 position:21% line:83% align:start
But it's still just a
damn moped you know.

00:03:35.382 --> 00:03:37.618 position:27% line:83% align:start
Ya can't even rev
that wimpy thing.

00:03:37.652 --> 00:03:39.286 position:5% line:89% align:start
Not without it taking off on ya!

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.823 position:16% line:83% align:start
And believe me I've seen
that happen to guys!

00:03:41.856 --> 00:03:43.925 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sounds just like Mikey actually.

00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.127 position:7% line:89% align:start
Only with Mikey it'd be slower!

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.729 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grumbles)

00:03:47.762 --> 00:03:50.898 position:21% line:83% align:start
I know you'd prefer
to have a real CB250.

00:03:50.932 --> 00:03:52.133 position:10% line:89% align:start
But there's no one older here

00:03:52.166 --> 00:03:54.168 position:5% line:89% align:start
who's about to let you have one.

00:03:54.202 --> 00:03:56.403 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Male Mermaid A] Hey hey,
lookie what we got here!

00:03:56.436 --> 00:03:57.437 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Male Mermaid B] Seriously?

00:03:57.471 --> 00:03:59.107 position:10% line:89% align:start
Wook at the cute widdle boys

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.308 position:19% line:83% align:start
in their brand-new
matching gang jackets!

00:04:01.341 --> 00:04:03.077 position:19% line:89% align:start
Tokyo Manji Gang, huh?

00:04:03.111 --> 00:04:04.746 position:16% line:89% align:start
Nope, never heard of ya.

00:04:04.779 --> 00:04:08.182 position:13% line:83% align:start
Where the hell'd you loser
wannabes wash up from?

00:04:08.216 --> 00:04:10.417 position:5% line:89% align:start
This here is Yokohama, cupcakes!

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.587 position:16% line:83% align:start
If you little shits wanna
play pretend gangster

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.722 position:27% line:83% align:start
then you came to
the wrong place!

00:04:14.756 --> 00:04:16.858 position:16% line:89% align:start
Get yer asses back home!

00:04:16.891 --> 00:04:18.258 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grumbles)

00:04:18.291 --> 00:04:19.861 position:10% line:89% align:start
Well I don't know about you.

00:04:19.894 --> 00:04:22.530 position:10% line:83% align:start
But I figure as long as we're
all here getting acquainted.

00:04:22.563 --> 00:04:25.032 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna scrap that
piece-of-shit moped of yours.

00:04:25.066 --> 00:04:27.300 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm sure you won't mind!

00:04:27.334 --> 00:04:30.772 position:16% line:83% align:start
If you lay one finger on
my precious Street Hawk,

00:04:30.805 --> 00:04:31.606 position:33% line:89% align:start
you're dead.

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:32.640 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:04:39.213 --> 00:04:41.414 position:16% line:89% align:start
Aahh, it's not worth it.

00:04:44.752 --> 00:04:47.054 position:21% line:83% align:start
But the next time we
catch you around here

00:04:47.088 --> 00:04:49.322 position:27% line:83% align:start
we're gonna mess
you up, big time!

00:04:49.356 --> 00:04:52.226 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yeah, and we're gonna torch
all your crap bikes too!

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.327 position:21% line:83% align:start
Come on back when
you grow some balls!

00:04:54.361 --> 00:04:56.564 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughter)

00:05:00.001 --> 00:05:01.202 position:27% line:89% align:start
Whattya wanna do?

00:05:01.235 --> 00:05:02.537 position:27% line:89% align:start
Go and kill 'em?

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.172 position:19% line:89% align:start
Goin' five against five

00:05:04.205 --> 00:05:06.207 position:21% line:83% align:start
we'd kick their
heads in in no time.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.643 position:24% line:83% align:start
They already left,
so I say let it go.

00:05:08.676 --> 00:05:12.345 position:13% line:83% align:start
I ain't exactly the brains
here so you guys decide.

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:15.149 position:13% line:83% align:start
Anyway it's all because of
your stupid bike, Mikey.

00:05:15.183 --> 00:05:16.984 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Kazutora] Yeah,
you got that right!

00:05:17.018 --> 00:05:17.985 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Mikey] Huh?

00:05:18.019 --> 00:05:19.486 position:10% line:89% align:start
What's that supposed to mean?

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:29.329 position:24% line:83% align:start
I think you guys
really pussed out.

00:05:29.362 --> 00:05:31.799 position:19% line:83% align:start
We shoulda ripped those
assholes a new one man.

00:05:31.833 --> 00:05:33.333 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yeah you got that right.

00:05:33.366 --> 00:05:34.769 position:16% line:89% align:start
Mikey's gotten way mellow

00:05:34.802 --> 00:05:37.238 position:16% line:83% align:start
ever since he started
hanging out with Draken.

00:05:37.271 --> 00:05:38.573 position:41% line:89% align:start
(laugh)

00:05:38.606 --> 00:05:41.474 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yeah I woulda beaten that
guy's ugly face to a pulp.

00:05:48.381 --> 00:05:49.717 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Mikey] Uh oh.

00:05:51.418 --> 00:05:52.887 position:16% line:89% align:start
What's the matter, Mikey?

00:05:53.921 --> 00:05:55.355 position:19% line:89% align:start
I think I'm outta gas.

00:05:55.388 --> 00:05:57.291 position:24% line:89% align:start
You're shittin' me!

00:05:57.325 --> 00:05:59.760 position:19% line:83% align:start
How many times did we
tell you to fill it up?

00:05:59.794 --> 00:06:03.363 position:10% line:83% align:start
For a leader you kinda suck
at plannin' stuff, huh Mikey?

00:06:03.396 --> 00:06:04.932 position:16% line:89% align:start
Push it to a gas station.

00:06:04.966 --> 00:06:07.802 position:19% line:83% align:start
We'll meet up with you
later on at the beach.

00:06:07.835 --> 00:06:11.005 position:7% line:83% align:start
You know what, this is a
full-blown emergency you guys!

00:06:12.405 --> 00:06:14.976 position:27% line:83% align:start
Toman is in some
serious shit now!

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:16.177 position:38% line:89% align:start
Say what?

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:17.377 position:7% line:89% align:start
Hate to break it to ya, Mikey,

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.180 position:16% line:83% align:start
but you runnin' outta gas
is your problem, not--

00:06:19.213 --> 00:06:20.882 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's not just my problem!

00:06:20.915 --> 00:06:23.985 position:5% line:83% align:start
Which means the guy who's
walking to the gas station is...

00:06:24.018 --> 00:06:24.986 position:21% line:89% align:start
You can't mean that.

00:06:25.019 --> 00:06:25.987 position:35% line:89% align:start
Seriously?

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.521 position:21% line:89% align:start
And here we go again.

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:30.858 position:19% line:89% align:start
The loser at Roshambo!

00:06:30.892 --> 00:06:32.492 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Unison] Yeah I knew it.

00:06:32.526 --> 00:06:33.694 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's harsh man.

00:06:39.867 --> 00:06:40.668 position:38% line:89% align:start
Damn it!

00:06:41.769 --> 00:06:44.171 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's freaking hot out here.

00:06:44.205 --> 00:06:46.140 position:21% line:83% align:start
How the hell'd I
get stuck with this?

00:06:46.173 --> 00:06:48.809 position:13% line:89% align:start
Thanks for nothing, Mikey!

00:06:48.843 --> 00:06:53.648 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Unison] Oohh!

00:06:55.783 --> 00:06:57.484 position:10% line:89% align:start
We're at the beach, bitches!

00:07:00.521 --> 00:07:02.422 position:21% line:89% align:start
Let's do it, Mitsuya!

00:07:02.455 --> 00:07:04.292 position:13% line:89% align:start
You can't keep up with me!

00:07:04.325 --> 00:07:06.294 position:24% line:83% align:start
Last one into open
water buys lunch!

00:07:06.327 --> 00:07:08.029 position:27% line:83% align:start
You don't stand
a chance, Draken!

00:07:08.062 --> 00:07:09.063 position:41% line:89% align:start
Aaghh!

00:07:10.231 --> 00:07:11.699 position:35% line:89% align:start
Seriously?

00:07:11.732 --> 00:07:13.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
When there are all these
beautiful babes here?

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:17.437 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Unison] Ah man!

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.241 position:21% line:83% align:start
Now those are a
sight for sore eyes!

00:07:20.274 --> 00:07:21.776 position:24% line:89% align:start
(lecherous chuckle)

00:07:21.809 --> 00:07:23.044 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm.

00:07:23.077 --> 00:07:24.912 position:33% line:89% align:start
Oh, hey wait

00:07:24.946 --> 00:07:25.746 position:30% line:89% align:start
Where's, Mikey?

00:07:27.815 --> 00:07:30.418 position:16% line:83% align:start
Sure, just push the damn
thing to a gas station.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.920 position:19% line:83% align:start
Except there ain't one
anywhere near here!

00:07:34.322 --> 00:07:37.525 position:10% line:89% align:start
Well well, what have we here?

00:07:38.659 --> 00:07:40.995 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's one of those little
shits from before.

00:07:41.028 --> 00:07:42.196 position:30% line:89% align:start
Out of gas huh?

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:43.364 position:13% line:89% align:start
Can't get lamer than that!

00:07:43.397 --> 00:07:45.700 position:7% line:89% align:start
Yer little friends left ya eh?

00:07:45.733 --> 00:07:48.035 position:19% line:89% align:start
(seething anger growl)

00:07:48.069 --> 00:07:50.705 position:16% line:83% align:start
Remember how we told ya
we were gonna mess you up

00:07:50.738 --> 00:07:52.206 position:16% line:89% align:start
the next time we saw you?

00:07:53.374 --> 00:07:57.578 position:24% line:83% align:start
(fighting, punching
efforts, grunts)

00:08:02.683 --> 00:08:04.885 position:13% line:89% align:start
(heaving breaths, panting)

00:08:04.919 --> 00:08:06.988 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're tougher than ya
look, I'll give ya that.

00:08:07.021 --> 00:08:09.957 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well we can destroy that
punk-ass moped of his at least!

00:08:09.991 --> 00:08:11.158 position:38% line:89% align:start
(growls)

00:08:11.192 --> 00:08:14.829 position:16% line:89% align:start
(charging-ahead yelling)

00:08:14.862 --> 00:08:16.864 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughter)

00:08:23.304 --> 00:08:24.505 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:28.843 position:16% line:89% align:start
You gotta be shittin' me!

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.315 position:30% line:89% align:start
Piece o' shit!

00:08:34.348 --> 00:08:36.684 position:24% line:89% align:start
(astonished gasps)

00:08:36.717 --> 00:08:40.621 position:7% line:83% align:start
Lay one hand on Mikey's
precious ride and you're dead!

00:08:40.654 --> 00:08:42.690 position:33% line:89% align:start
Ehh what the?

00:08:42.723 --> 00:08:46.027 position:13% line:83% align:start
Is that stupid moped really
all that important to ya?

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:47.528 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmph!

00:08:47.561 --> 00:08:49.663 position:27% line:83% align:start
What the hell are
you smilin' about?

00:08:51.232 --> 00:08:53.034 position:19% line:89% align:start
You're all just sheep.

00:08:53.067 --> 00:08:54.068 position:38% line:89% align:start
What you?

00:08:55.903 --> 00:08:59.040 position:13% line:83% align:start
Not one of you is even
worthy to ride those bikes.

00:08:59.073 --> 00:09:00.341 position:24% line:89% align:start
The hell'd you say?

00:09:00.374 --> 00:09:02.143 position:16% line:89% align:start
Shut up you little shit!

00:09:02.176 --> 00:09:03.377 position:21% line:89% align:start
Smash 'em both, guys!

00:09:03.411 --> 00:09:07.481 position:16% line:89% align:start
(dark menacing chuckles)

00:09:07.516 --> 00:09:08.482 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Mikey] Hey there.

00:09:08.517 --> 00:09:09.483 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:09:09.518 --> 00:09:10.718 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:09:13.054 --> 00:09:13.988 position:38% line:89% align:start
Now what?

00:09:14.021 --> 00:09:15.689 position:30% line:89% align:start
Another victim?

00:09:15.723 --> 00:09:17.792 position:13% line:83% align:start
Hey guys, another piece
of trash just strolled in.

00:09:19.126 --> 00:09:20.327 position:27% line:89% align:start
Whoa, it's Mikey.

00:09:21.362 --> 00:09:22.596 position:24% line:89% align:start
I had to come back.

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:24.031 position:24% line:89% align:start
I forgot my trunks.

00:09:31.906 --> 00:09:34.208 position:33% line:89% align:start
(loud crash)

00:09:37.445 --> 00:09:40.414 position:30% line:89% align:start
(shock, horror)

00:09:40.448 --> 00:09:42.116 position:30% line:89% align:start
Holy shit dude!

00:09:42.149 --> 00:09:44.118 position:19% line:89% align:start
Did you really do that?

00:09:50.257 --> 00:09:51.425 position:33% line:89% align:start
You assholes.

00:09:51.459 --> 00:09:54.361 position:24% line:89% align:start
(puzzled, alarmed)

00:09:54.395 --> 00:09:55.663 position:35% line:89% align:start
You'll pay

00:09:55.696 --> 00:09:58.065 position:19% line:83% align:start
for wrecking something
so near and dear to me.

00:09:58.099 --> 00:09:59.066 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh!

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.801 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're the one who
kicked it over!

00:10:01.602 --> 00:10:04.271 position:30% line:89% align:start
(aghast, shock)

00:10:10.579 --> 00:10:12.313 position:30% line:89% align:start
Baji, you good?

00:10:14.782 --> 00:10:17.284 position:16% line:83% align:start
You ended up getting hurt
over such a dumb thing.

00:10:17.318 --> 00:10:18.319 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry.

00:10:19.653 --> 00:10:21.422 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's all right, Mikey.

00:10:21.455 --> 00:10:24.258 position:19% line:89% align:start
If you're okay, then...

00:10:24.291 --> 00:10:26.227 position:19% line:89% align:start
Let's finish this off.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:27.661 position:24% line:89% align:start
Let's kill 'em all.

00:10:30.164 --> 00:10:32.133 position:41% line:89% align:start
(awed)

00:10:36.103 --> 00:10:38.372 position:24% line:83% align:start
We'll see who gets
killed, dumbasses!

00:10:38.405 --> 00:10:40.875 position:33% line:89% align:start
(charge yell)

00:10:40.908 --> 00:10:44.745 position:16% line:83% align:start
Even back then, Mikey
was an invincible badass.

00:10:52.554 --> 00:10:54.388 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hey, Kazutora.

00:10:54.421 --> 00:10:56.056 position:13% line:89% align:start
Where are we going to now?

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:58.726 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, Mikey's birthday's
coming up, right?

00:10:58.759 --> 00:11:01.162 position:19% line:83% align:start
So we're goin' shopping
for a present for him!

00:11:01.195 --> 00:11:02.564 position:24% line:89% align:start
What kinda present?

00:11:02.597 --> 00:11:03.565 position:27% line:89% align:start
We got no money.

00:11:03.598 --> 00:11:04.566 position:38% line:89% align:start
No need!

00:11:04.599 --> 00:11:05.799 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:11:07.801 --> 00:11:10.437 position:10% line:89% align:start
We're gonna get him a CB250T!

00:11:10.471 --> 00:11:11.839 position:16% line:89% align:start
Nobody has one of those!

00:11:16.377 --> 00:11:17.678 position:35% line:89% align:start
What's up?

00:11:17.711 --> 00:11:20.314 position:33% line:89% align:start
(sly chuckle)

00:11:23.384 --> 00:11:24.818 position:13% line:89% align:start
Just trust me, I got this!

00:11:41.268 --> 00:11:42.269 position:35% line:89% align:start
Over there.

00:11:42.303 --> 00:11:43.103 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's the place.

00:11:44.471 --> 00:11:45.906 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Baji] It's here?

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:47.074 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:11:47.107 --> 00:11:47.908 position:33% line:89% align:start
There it is.

00:11:52.112 --> 00:11:54.281 position:38% line:89% align:start
A CB250T.

00:11:54.315 --> 00:11:55.316 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's beautiful!

00:11:56.618 --> 00:11:57.619 position:38% line:89% align:start
Alright.

00:11:57.652 --> 00:11:58.620 position:30% line:89% align:start
Let's steal it.

00:11:58.653 --> 00:11:59.621 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:11:59.654 --> 00:12:01.055 position:19% line:89% align:start
Wait we can't do that!

00:12:01.088 --> 00:12:02.657 position:38% line:89% align:start
Why not?

00:12:02.691 --> 00:12:05.726 position:21% line:83% align:start
There's no way Mikey
would go for that.

00:12:05.759 --> 00:12:08.095 position:21% line:83% align:start
He'd never want us to
get him one that way.

00:12:09.263 --> 00:12:10.331 position:33% line:89% align:start
You dumbass.

00:12:10.364 --> 00:12:12.733 position:21% line:83% align:start
We don't need to tell
him how we got it!

00:12:12.766 --> 00:12:14.969 position:21% line:83% align:start
The only way kids
like us ever get one

00:12:15.002 --> 00:12:17.204 position:10% line:89% align:start
is if somebody gives us one.

00:12:17.238 --> 00:12:18.439 position:24% line:89% align:start
Or if we steal one.

00:12:25.246 --> 00:12:27.915 position:21% line:83% align:start
Come on, what're you
freaking out about?

00:12:27.948 --> 00:12:30.351 position:19% line:83% align:start
There's no way that gas
tank's gonna be empty.

00:12:30.384 --> 00:12:32.019 position:16% line:89% align:start
This is a piece of cake.

00:12:32.052 --> 00:12:33.020 position:38% line:89% align:start
Dumbass!

00:12:33.053 --> 00:12:34.922 position:13% line:89% align:start
That is not the point here!

00:12:34.955 --> 00:12:37.659 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm tryin' to tell
you stealing is bad!

00:12:37.692 --> 00:12:40.127 position:27% line:83% align:start
But you wanna see
Mikey happy right?

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:40.961 position:27% line:89% align:start
This is the way!

00:12:42.896 --> 00:12:46.300 position:10% line:83% align:start
And you know this is the
bike he's always dreamed of.

00:12:46.333 --> 00:12:47.535 position:19% line:89% align:start
I know all that but...

00:12:59.346 --> 00:13:01.181 position:24% line:89% align:start
This is messed up!

00:13:01.215 --> 00:13:03.652 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're always the
first one to complain!

00:13:03.685 --> 00:13:05.886 position:16% line:83% align:start
And yet, here you are
again, right by my side!

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:12.960 position:38% line:89% align:start
Let's go.

00:13:13.762 --> 00:13:14.962 position:35% line:89% align:start
Seriously?

00:13:27.007 --> 00:13:28.576 position:24% line:89% align:start
It actually opened!

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:29.778 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah!

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:31.145 position:24% line:83% align:start
And no security
alarms or anything!

00:13:31.178 --> 00:13:32.781 position:41% line:89% align:start
Sweet.

00:13:32.813 --> 00:13:34.982 position:19% line:83% align:start
What're you doing just
standing there, Baji?

00:13:35.015 --> 00:13:38.352 position:24% line:83% align:start
Are we really gonna
do this, Kazutora?

00:13:38.385 --> 00:13:39.219 position:24% line:89% align:start
Keep it down, dude!

00:13:40.755 --> 00:13:43.190 position:27% line:83% align:start
Well, there's no
turning back now!

00:13:43.223 --> 00:13:44.659 position:33% line:89% align:start
Just shut up.

00:13:44.693 --> 00:13:45.893 position:24% line:89% align:start
Which way do we go?

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:57.905 position:27% line:89% align:start
Look there, Baji.

00:14:04.244 --> 00:14:05.245 position:44% line:89% align:start
Whoa!

00:14:13.987 --> 00:14:15.989 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's a CB250T!

00:14:17.224 --> 00:14:18.392 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's so awesome!

00:14:20.595 --> 00:14:22.196 position:16% line:89% align:start
Wait, this one isn't new.

00:14:22.229 --> 00:14:23.397 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh.

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:24.198 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yeah, you're right.

00:14:24.231 --> 00:14:25.700 position:5% line:89% align:start
It must be here for maintenance.

00:14:25.734 --> 00:14:27.836 position:13% line:89% align:start
This is a total custom job!

00:14:27.868 --> 00:14:30.638 position:27% line:83% align:start
Look at those fat
tires and wheels!

00:14:30.672 --> 00:14:32.239 position:24% line:89% align:start
Damn, this bike...

00:14:39.079 --> 00:14:42.149 position:21% line:83% align:start
Mikey would look so
super badass on this!

00:14:43.585 --> 00:14:45.252 position:30% line:89% align:start
(light chuckle)

00:14:45.285 --> 00:14:46.954 position:5% line:89% align:start
Alright, gimme the bolt-cutters.

00:14:55.597 --> 00:14:56.598 position:38% line:89% align:start
Damn it!

00:14:59.634 --> 00:15:01.770 position:10% line:89% align:start
Sucker doesn't want to break!

00:15:01.803 --> 00:15:03.003 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hurry up dammit!

00:15:04.004 --> 00:15:07.007 position:16% line:89% align:start
I think I almost got it!

00:15:10.944 --> 00:15:12.379 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yeah we did it!

00:15:12.413 --> 00:15:13.380 position:38% line:89% align:start
Alright!

00:15:13.414 --> 00:15:14.415 position:24% line:89% align:start
Let's roll it out!

00:15:17.519 --> 00:15:18.952 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's got gas in the tank!

00:15:18.986 --> 00:15:20.254 position:30% line:89% align:start
Let's start it!

00:15:20.287 --> 00:15:21.255 position:35% line:89% align:start
No not yet!

00:15:21.288 --> 00:15:23.457 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll go out front and
open the shutters up.

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:24.592 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yeah, okay!

00:15:24.626 --> 00:15:25.627 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hurry up!

00:15:29.831 --> 00:15:32.266 position:24% line:83% align:start
This might actually
work, Kazutora!

00:15:32.299 --> 00:15:33.934 position:41% line:89% align:start
I know!

00:15:33.967 --> 00:15:36.403 position:13% line:83% align:start
When we give this to Mikey,
he's gonna freak out!

00:15:36.437 --> 00:15:37.505 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah!

00:15:41.341 --> 00:15:43.711 position:13% line:83% align:start
You're gonna have the
best birthday ever, Mikey!

00:15:45.513 --> 00:15:46.781 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey!

00:15:46.815 --> 00:15:48.683 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasp)

00:15:52.085 --> 00:15:53.621 position:27% line:89% align:start
The hell's this?

00:15:53.655 --> 00:15:54.656 position:30% line:89% align:start
You robbin' me?

00:15:55.523 --> 00:15:56.691 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasp)

00:15:56.724 --> 00:15:58.492 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh shit!

00:15:58.526 --> 00:16:01.995 position:13% line:83% align:start
You picked the wrong shop
to break into, you asshole.

00:16:05.432 --> 00:16:06.200 position:44% line:89% align:start
Damn!

00:16:06.233 --> 00:16:07.401 position:19% line:89% align:start
And he's got a weapon!

00:16:08.837 --> 00:16:10.037 position:33% line:89% align:start
This is bad!

00:16:14.809 --> 00:16:17.311 position:10% line:89% align:start
You thieving little bastard!

00:16:17.344 --> 00:16:19.614 position:21% line:83% align:start
You thought you could
get away with this?

00:16:19.647 --> 00:16:21.148 position:41% line:89% align:start
No way!

00:16:21.181 --> 00:16:23.083 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh man we're so screwed!

00:16:23.116 --> 00:16:24.619 position:19% line:89% align:start
He totally saw my face!

00:16:24.652 --> 00:16:27.321 position:16% line:83% align:start
Even if we make it out of
here we'll be arrested!

00:16:31.291 --> 00:16:32.760 position:16% line:89% align:start
Now what are we gonna do?

00:16:35.362 --> 00:16:36.163 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:16:38.766 --> 00:16:40.434 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hey, wait a sec...

00:16:40.467 --> 00:16:42.069 position:24% line:89% align:start
You look familiar.

00:16:42.102 --> 00:16:44.606 position:33% line:89% align:start
(fright gasp)

00:16:47.474 --> 00:16:48.275 position:27% line:89% align:start
Are you Keisuke?

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:57.451 position:41% line:89% align:start
Shi...

00:16:57.484 --> 00:16:58.786 position:35% line:89% align:start
Shinichiro?

00:17:01.589 --> 00:17:03.591 position:24% line:89% align:start
What're you doing?

00:17:03.625 --> 00:17:05.425 position:21% line:89% align:start
Why are you in here?

00:17:05.459 --> 00:17:08.563 position:19% line:83% align:start
More like what are you
doing here in my shop?

00:17:09.831 --> 00:17:11.533 position:24% line:89% align:start
This is your shop?

00:17:11.566 --> 00:17:12.667 position:35% line:89% align:start
Shinichiro?

00:17:14.702 --> 00:17:17.237 position:33% line:89% align:start
(fright gasp)

00:17:19.172 --> 00:17:21.108 position:24% line:89% align:start
No Kazutora, don't!

00:17:49.837 --> 00:17:51.471 position:10% line:89% align:start
Time to get outta here, Baji!

00:17:51.506 --> 00:17:52.740 position:33% line:89% align:start
(loud crash)

00:17:52.774 --> 00:17:53.775 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:17:59.446 --> 00:18:02.282 position:21% line:83% align:start
Oh my god, what have
you done, Kazutora?

00:18:02.316 --> 00:18:03.083 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:18:03.116 --> 00:18:04.586 position:13% line:89% align:start
What was I supposed to do?

00:18:04.619 --> 00:18:06.621 position:27% line:89% align:start
He saw your face!

00:18:06.654 --> 00:18:07.555 position:35% line:89% align:start
No dumbass!

00:18:07.589 --> 00:18:09.591 position:24% line:83% align:start
You don't know what
I'm talking about!

00:18:12.927 --> 00:18:14.762 position:7% line:89% align:start
This guy's name is Shinichiro!

00:18:14.796 --> 00:18:15.797 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:19.266 position:16% line:89% align:start
And I know him 'cause...

00:18:20.133 --> 00:18:22.737 position:21% line:83% align:start
Because he's Mikey's
older brother!

00:18:25.506 --> 00:18:26.306 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:30.177 position:35% line:89% align:start
Shinichiro!

00:18:31.478 --> 00:18:32.279 position:35% line:89% align:start
Shinichiro!

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:36.116 position:30% line:89% align:start
Shinichiro, no!

00:18:37.085 --> 00:18:38.151 position:27% line:89% align:start
Mikey's brother?

00:18:38.987 --> 00:18:40.187 position:41% line:89% align:start
No way!

00:18:49.097 --> 00:18:50.798 position:21% line:89% align:start
What're we gonna do?

00:18:50.832 --> 00:18:51.833 position:38% line:89% align:start
Kazutora!

00:18:52.934 --> 00:18:54.334 position:21% line:89% align:start
What are we gonna do?

00:18:56.136 --> 00:18:58.773 position:13% line:89% align:start
Dude, he stopped breathing!

00:18:58.806 --> 00:19:01.075 position:13% line:89% align:start
He's not breathing anymore!

00:19:01.109 --> 00:19:03.310 position:38% line:89% align:start
(panting)

00:19:06.648 --> 00:19:08.616 position:35% line:89% align:start
Shinichiro!

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:10.250 position:24% line:89% align:start
What have we done?

00:19:11.919 --> 00:19:13.888 position:16% line:89% align:start
This can't be happening!

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:18.593 position:21% line:83% align:start
How could we've made
such a huge mistake?

00:19:19.861 --> 00:19:21.529 position:7% line:89% align:start
We were trying to steal a bike

00:19:21.562 --> 00:19:23.564 position:19% line:83% align:start
that belonged to
Mikey's older brother!

00:19:29.737 --> 00:19:30.905 position:30% line:89% align:start
What do we do?

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:33.306 position:30% line:89% align:start
What do we do?

00:19:34.142 --> 00:19:36.443 position:38% line:89% align:start
(panting)

00:19:39.714 --> 00:19:41.015 position:30% line:89% align:start
I didn't do it!

00:19:41.049 --> 00:19:42.684 position:16% line:89% align:start
I didn't kill him, did I?

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:48.321 position:16% line:89% align:start
We have to get him help!

00:19:48.355 --> 00:19:51.358 position:21% line:83% align:start
My god if I'd known,
I never woulda,

00:19:51.391 --> 00:19:54.227 position:10% line:83% align:start
I wouldn'ta hit him if I
knew it was Mikey's brother!

00:19:56.564 --> 00:19:58.533 position:27% line:83% align:start
We have to call
for an ambulance.

00:19:58.566 --> 00:20:01.969 position:13% line:83% align:start
We'll call for an ambulance
and then get out of here!

00:20:02.003 --> 00:20:05.305 position:7% line:89% align:start
But it doesn't make any sense!

00:20:05.338 --> 00:20:08.241 position:16% line:83% align:start
I was only doing this for
Mikey in the first place!

00:20:13.246 --> 00:20:14.716 position:24% line:89% align:start
What's that number?

00:20:14.749 --> 00:20:15.750 position:33% line:89% align:start
Gotta think!

00:20:16.684 --> 00:20:18.052 position:35% line:89% align:start
I don't...

00:20:18.086 --> 00:20:20.353 position:24% line:89% align:start
I don't understand!

00:20:20.387 --> 00:20:23.223 position:16% line:83% align:start
I only wanted to do
something nice for Mikey!

00:20:27.562 --> 00:20:28.361 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:20:29.864 --> 00:20:30.832 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh shit!

00:20:30.865 --> 00:20:31.866 position:38% line:89% align:start
The cops!

00:20:34.168 --> 00:20:35.536 position:13% line:89% align:start
We've gotta get outta here!

00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:36.436 position:38% line:89% align:start
Come on!

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:39.607 position:19% line:83% align:start
Wait a sec, this
whole thing wasn't me!

00:20:40.675 --> 00:20:42.309 position:33% line:89% align:start
Not my fault!

00:20:42.342 --> 00:20:44.512 position:7% line:89% align:start
This is Mikey's fault isn't it?

00:20:44.545 --> 00:20:45.345 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:20:48.649 --> 00:20:50.651 position:35% line:89% align:start
Now I see!

00:20:50.685 --> 00:20:53.286 position:30% line:89% align:start
Uhhm, Kazutora?

00:20:55.823 --> 00:20:57.959 position:21% line:89% align:start
So that's the answer!

00:20:57.992 --> 00:20:59.527 position:21% line:89% align:start
I have to kill Mikey!

00:21:00.728 --> 00:21:03.030 position:33% line:89% align:start
(horror gasp)

00:21:05.032 --> 00:21:06.433 position:21% line:89% align:start
Roger that, dispatch.

00:21:06.466 --> 00:21:08.603 position:19% line:83% align:start
We have two suspects in
custody at the scene.

00:21:08.636 --> 00:21:10.270 position:7% line:89% align:start
One victim, severe head trauma,

00:21:10.303 --> 00:21:12.206 position:19% line:83% align:start
en route to the
hospital by ambulance,

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.574 position:7% line:89% align:start
code three, condition critical,

00:21:13.608 --> 00:21:15.275 position:24% line:83% align:start
and believed to
be the shop owner.

00:21:15.308 --> 00:21:17.612 position:27% line:83% align:start
Tentative ID one
Shinichiro Sano.

00:21:17.645 --> 00:21:19.914 position:16% line:83% align:start
One suspect captured
with weapon at the scene;

00:21:19.947 --> 00:21:21.749 position:5% line:89% align:start
lab is dusting for prints, over.

00:21:21.783 --> 00:21:23.718 position:30% line:89% align:start
I don't get it!

00:21:23.751 --> 00:21:25.485 position:24% line:83% align:start
How could any of
this have happened?

00:21:26.954 --> 00:21:29.322 position:13% line:89% align:start
Must kill, must kill Mikey.

00:21:30.792 --> 00:21:31.726 position:41% line:89% align:start
No way.

00:21:31.759 --> 00:21:32.760 position:41% line:89% align:start
No way!

00:21:33.995 --> 00:21:34.962 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Mikey] Baji!

00:21:34.996 --> 00:21:35.997 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:21:44.872 --> 00:21:46.073 position:27% line:89% align:start
What's going on?

00:21:50.011 --> 00:21:51.378 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mikey!

00:21:52.513 --> 00:21:53.748 position:19% line:89% align:start
What happened in there?

00:21:56.851 --> 00:21:58.385 position:33% line:89% align:start
I'm so sorry!

00:22:03.024 --> 00:22:05.392 position:13% line:89% align:start
Must kill, must kill Mikey.

00:22:06.794 --> 00:22:08.696 position:38% line:89% align:start
(sobbing)

00:22:17.839 --> 00:22:21.474 position:21% line:89% align:start
(closing theme music)
