00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:15.382 position:41% line:89% align:start
Akkun!

00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:17.484 position:41% line:89% align:start
Akkun!!

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:18.485 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.854 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:00:19.888 --> 00:00:20.989 position:44% line:89% align:start
Heh!

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:22.456 position:7% line:89% align:start
What are you doing here, dude?

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:24.859 position:16% line:83% align:start
But here's the reason why
I called you in tonight.

00:00:24.893 --> 00:00:27.027 position:10% line:83% align:start
They're finally gonna let me
start cutting customers' hair

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.028 position:35% line:89% align:start
next month.

00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:30.030 position:10% line:89% align:start
And you, you'll be my first.

00:00:31.064 --> 00:00:32.499 position:19% line:89% align:start
We promised, remember?

00:00:32.534 --> 00:00:35.703 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:00:35.737 --> 00:00:39.039 position:19% line:83% align:start
This proves it. I think
I finally believe it.

00:00:39.072 --> 00:00:41.108 position:7% line:89% align:start
I actually changed the present.

00:00:41.141 --> 00:00:43.878 position:10% line:89% align:start
It worked, it really worked.

00:00:43.912 --> 00:00:45.547 position:33% line:83% align:start
(phone beeps)
Hm?

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:46.714 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:00:46.748 --> 00:00:48.716 position:7% line:89% align:start
I wonder Whose number this is?

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.217 position:35% line:89% align:start
What's up?

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.719 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Naoto] You must have succeeded.

00:00:51.753 --> 00:00:52.720 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:00:52.754 --> 00:00:54.321 position:35% line:89% align:start
Who's this?

00:00:54.354 --> 00:00:57.457 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Naoto] And you just returned
from the past, right?

00:00:57.491 --> 00:00:58.660 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh Naoto!

00:00:58.693 --> 00:01:00.327 position:19% line:89% align:start
Listen man, you did it.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.397 position:13% line:83% align:start
You pulled this off. Thanks
to you everything's changed.

00:01:03.798 --> 00:01:04.799 position:35% line:89% align:start
Takemichi.

00:01:05.767 --> 00:01:07.167 position:30% line:89% align:start
So whattya say?

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.402 position:21% line:89% align:start
Wanna see my sister?

00:01:09.771 --> 00:01:11.539 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hina?

00:01:11.573 --> 00:01:12.372 position:33% line:89% align:start
She's alive?

00:01:19.112 --> 00:01:22.115 position:27% line:89% align:start
(engine revving)

00:01:27.589 --> 00:01:29.791 position:41% line:89% align:start
(sighs)

00:01:29.824 --> 00:01:31.158 position:19% line:89% align:start
The escalating dispute

00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:33.360 position:10% line:83% align:start
between the Tokyo Manji Gang
and its rivals is believed

00:01:33.393 --> 00:01:36.698 position:10% line:83% align:start
to have just claimed several
additional innocent victims.

00:01:36.731 --> 00:01:37.765 position:13% line:83% align:start
Two victims were pronounced
dead at the scene.

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:38.800 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Wait, seriously?

00:01:38.833 --> 00:01:40.200 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's insane.

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:41.803 position:10% line:83% align:start
Official word is being
withheld pending notification

00:01:41.836 --> 00:01:43.136 position:30% line:89% align:start
of next-of-kin.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.439 position:21% line:83% align:start
But the two have been
tentatively identified

00:01:45.472 --> 00:01:48.509 position:19% line:83% align:start
as Naoto Tachibana, 25,
from Shibuya, Tokyo.

00:01:48.543 --> 00:01:51.012 position:16% line:83% align:start
And another victim,
Tachibana's older sister,

00:01:51.045 --> 00:01:52.947 position:7% line:89% align:start
Hinata Tachibana, 26 years old.

00:01:52.981 --> 00:01:54.949 position:19% line:89% align:start
Did he really just say,

00:01:54.983 --> 00:01:57.317 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hinata?

00:01:57.351 --> 00:02:01.055 position:10% line:83% align:start
Back then, all I could do
was watch the TV, helplessly.

00:02:01.089 --> 00:02:03.024 position:21% line:83% align:start
But now, I can
actually go see Hina.

00:02:03.057 --> 00:02:04.692 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hina's alive.

00:02:04.726 --> 00:02:05.827 position:13% line:89% align:start
After doing some research,

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.260 position:27% line:83% align:start
it looks like the
incident that led

00:02:07.294 --> 00:02:09.396 position:21% line:83% align:start
to my sister's death
never happened.

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:10.598 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:02:10.632 --> 00:02:11.733 position:24% line:89% align:start
Toman never fought?

00:02:11.766 --> 00:02:12.734 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:02:12.767 --> 00:02:14.234 position:21% line:89% align:start
Still, I'm surprised.

00:02:14.267 --> 00:02:16.571 position:16% line:83% align:start
I can't believe you
actually pulled this off.

00:02:16.604 --> 00:02:17.939 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:02:17.972 --> 00:02:19.239 position:10% line:89% align:start
What's that supposed to mean?

00:02:19.272 --> 00:02:20.407 position:27% line:89% align:start
Well, dude c'mon.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.409 position:16% line:89% align:start
You are kinda of a loser.

00:02:22.442 --> 00:02:24.478 position:21% line:83% align:start
Okay, are you trying
to pick a fight?

00:02:24.512 --> 00:02:25.780 position:38% line:89% align:start
(laughs)

00:02:25.813 --> 00:02:26.781 position:21% line:89% align:start
What does it matter?

00:02:26.814 --> 00:02:28.248 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're about to see my sister.

00:02:28.281 --> 00:02:31.085 position:27% line:89% align:start
Ah, that's right.

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:33.253 position:16% line:89% align:start
I get to see Hina again.

00:02:33.286 --> 00:02:36.524 position:13% line:83% align:start
I have to admit, I'm super
excited about that, Naoto.

00:02:37.925 --> 00:02:40.762 position:13% line:83% align:start
Getting to see Hina in the
present, it's like a dream.

00:02:43.598 --> 00:02:46.366 position:27% line:89% align:start
(engine revving)

00:02:51.773 --> 00:02:52.740 position:16% line:89% align:start
Okay, this is the place,

00:02:52.774 --> 00:02:53.741 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:02:53.775 --> 00:02:54.776 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:03:00.782 --> 00:03:01.783 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm.

00:03:06.654 --> 00:03:07.655 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.195 position:21% line:89% align:start
(opening theme music)

00:04:41.516 --> 00:04:44.118 position:24% line:5% align:start
I wonder if Hina's
changed at all.

00:04:44.152 --> 00:04:46.154 position:7% line:5% align:start
Well, of course she's changed.

00:04:46.187 --> 00:04:49.289 position:10% line:5% align:start
After all, it's been 12 years
since the two of you broke up.

00:04:49.322 --> 00:04:50.758 position:13% line:89% align:start
And Hinata is an adult now.

00:04:50.792 --> 00:04:52.693 position:27% line:89% align:start
(engine revving)

00:04:52.727 --> 00:04:53.895 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hina's, an adult?

00:04:56.063 --> 00:04:59.499 position:13% line:83% align:start
And she's got a job. She's
a grade-school teacher now.

00:04:59.534 --> 00:05:00.333 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey.

00:05:03.403 --> 00:05:05.273 position:13% line:89% align:start
Oh Takemichi, you're here.

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:06.473 position:21% line:89% align:start
I missed you so much.

00:05:06.507 --> 00:05:08.276 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh, come on now, Hina.

00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:10.745 position:21% line:83% align:start
Maybe the two of you
oughta go get a room.

00:05:10.778 --> 00:05:13.915 position:27% line:83% align:start
Let's go inside.
Naoto's watching.

00:05:13.948 --> 00:05:14.949 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm.

00:05:21.989 --> 00:05:23.591 position:7% line:89% align:start
What the hell's wrong with me?

00:05:23.624 --> 00:05:26.493 position:13% line:83% align:start
Like any of that's likely
to happen when she sees me.

00:05:27.295 --> 00:05:29.797 position:33% line:89% align:start
(tense music)

00:05:35.203 --> 00:05:36.871 position:30% line:89% align:start
Let's break up.

00:05:36.904 --> 00:05:39.472 position:33% line:89% align:start
(tense music)

00:05:43.277 --> 00:05:46.113 position:27% line:89% align:start
(breathes slowly)

00:05:59.293 --> 00:06:00.761 position:41% line:89% align:start
Naoto?

00:06:00.795 --> 00:06:02.096 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:03.097 position:38% line:89% align:start
You know,

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:04.131 position:41% line:89% align:start
I think

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:06.634 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm not gonna see her after all.

00:06:06.667 --> 00:06:07.635 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:06:07.668 --> 00:06:09.570 position:24% line:83% align:start
What brought this
on all of a sudden?

00:06:11.005 --> 00:06:13.641 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, if you look at it
from my point of view.

00:06:13.674 --> 00:06:16.010 position:24% line:83% align:start
Sure my mission
saved Hina's life.

00:06:16.043 --> 00:06:17.044 position:13% line:89% align:start
But she doesn't know that.

00:06:17.078 --> 00:06:19.747 position:19% line:83% align:start
In fact she has no idea
about any of this stuff.

00:06:22.583 --> 00:06:25.385 position:19% line:83% align:start
You go see her, you're
her brother after all.

00:06:25.418 --> 00:06:28.388 position:16% line:83% align:start
But me? By now I'm a
complete stranger to her.

00:06:29.957 --> 00:06:30.758 position:30% line:89% align:start
Don't say that.

00:06:34.028 --> 00:06:35.162 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's for the best.

00:06:35.196 --> 00:06:36.964 position:10% line:89% align:start
I just want her to be happy.

00:06:44.105 --> 00:06:45.940 position:38% line:89% align:start
12 years.

00:06:45.973 --> 00:06:47.541 position:30% line:89% align:start
12 whole years.

00:06:48.475 --> 00:06:50.410 position:24% line:83% align:start
What girl would
even remember a guy

00:06:50.443 --> 00:06:51.946 position:10% line:89% align:start
that she dated that long ago?

00:06:57.018 --> 00:06:58.252 position:30% line:89% align:start
(punches wall)

00:06:58.286 --> 00:07:00.154 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:07:00.187 --> 00:07:02.323 position:16% line:89% align:start
What the hell am I doing?

00:07:02.356 --> 00:07:05.159 position:21% line:83% align:start
I worked so hard, yet
nothing's changed.

00:07:05.192 --> 00:07:08.095 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:12.099 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm still a 26-year-old virgin,
working a part-time job.

00:07:12.133 --> 00:07:14.702 position:7% line:89% align:start
How can I face Hina like this?

00:07:14.735 --> 00:07:17.538 position:21% line:83% align:start
No matter how much I
travel through time,

00:07:17.571 --> 00:07:18.739 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm still a failure.

00:07:20.074 --> 00:07:22.043 position:35% line:89% align:start
(breathes)

00:07:22.076 --> 00:07:24.477 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:07:33.421 --> 00:07:35.122 position:27% line:89% align:start
But Hina's alive.

00:07:35.156 --> 00:07:37.124 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's more than enough.

00:07:37.158 --> 00:07:38.926 position:27% line:83% align:start
How can I ask for
more than that?

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.228 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:07:42.396 --> 00:07:46.033 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll just go back.
Back to my old life.

00:07:46.067 --> 00:07:48.602 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:07:49.337 --> 00:07:50.705 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh, I'm sorry. I...

00:07:50.738 --> 00:07:52.039 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:07:52.073 --> 00:07:54.575 position:33% line:89% align:start
(tense music)

00:07:58.079 --> 00:07:59.246 position:21% line:89% align:start
Wait, am I dreaming?

00:08:01.349 --> 00:08:02.550 position:35% line:89% align:start
Takemichi?

00:08:05.886 --> 00:08:08.589 position:33% line:89% align:start
(breaths) No!

00:08:08.622 --> 00:08:11.125 position:33% line:89% align:start
(piano music)

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:44.191 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh Hina!

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.728 position:30% line:89% align:start
You are alive.

00:08:48.729 --> 00:08:50.598 position:10% line:89% align:start
You're right in front of me.

00:08:51.365 --> 00:08:53.034 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hi, Takemichi.

00:08:53.067 --> 00:08:55.069 position:21% line:83% align:start
Still showing up
without any warning.

00:08:55.102 --> 00:08:56.537 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:57.805 position:7% line:89% align:start
Has something happened to you?

00:08:57.838 --> 00:08:59.907 position:24% line:83% align:start
No, no, nothing's
happened. I'm fine.

00:09:00.908 --> 00:09:02.977 position:7% line:89% align:start
Oh crap. The tears won't stop.

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:06.480 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:09:06.515 --> 00:09:10.084 position:19% line:83% align:start
Ah Hina, your eyes
haven't changed at all.

00:09:10.117 --> 00:09:12.720 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:09:23.864 --> 00:09:24.665 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hm, hm.

00:09:30.704 --> 00:09:32.106 position:24% line:89% align:start
Uhh. Hey, you know.

00:09:32.139 --> 00:09:33.340 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah!

00:09:33.374 --> 00:09:34.942 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's nice weather lately.

00:09:34.975 --> 00:09:35.943 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes!

00:09:35.976 --> 00:09:37.512 position:33% line:89% align:start
It's cloudy.

00:09:37.546 --> 00:09:39.080 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh.

00:09:39.113 --> 00:09:42.416 position:10% line:83% align:start
You two haven't seen each
other in practically forever.

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:44.618 position:24% line:83% align:start
Y'oughta have lots
to talk about.

00:09:44.652 --> 00:09:47.021 position:19% line:83% align:start
And here you are
discussing the weather?

00:09:47.054 --> 00:09:49.757 position:27% line:83% align:start
Come on. So I'm
a little nervous.

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:52.259 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's hard to know
just what to say.

00:09:52.293 --> 00:09:53.294 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's been a long time.

00:09:59.733 --> 00:10:01.368 position:21% line:89% align:start
Well, I'm going home.

00:10:01.402 --> 00:10:02.369 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh.

00:10:02.403 --> 00:10:04.772 position:10% line:89% align:start
No, no, Naoto, You can't go.

00:10:04.805 --> 00:10:07.208 position:24% line:83% align:start
Being here with
you two is torture.

00:10:07.241 --> 00:10:08.442 position:13% line:89% align:start
Figure it out on your own.

00:10:08.476 --> 00:10:09.710 position:30% line:83% align:start
-See you later.
-Uh no, wait.

00:10:09.743 --> 00:10:11.312 position:21% line:83% align:start
You can't leave me
here alone with her.

00:10:11.345 --> 00:10:12.880 position:27% line:83% align:start
My heart will pop
outta my chest.

00:10:12.913 --> 00:10:15.049 position:16% line:83% align:start
Are you trying to kill
me or something, Naoto?.

00:10:15.082 --> 00:10:17.384 position:21% line:83% align:start
And you call yourself
my best friend.

00:10:17.418 --> 00:10:18.652 position:13% line:89% align:start
I am not your best friend.

00:10:18.686 --> 00:10:19.620 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's so mean.

00:10:19.653 --> 00:10:21.088 position:27% line:89% align:start
Let go of my leg.

00:10:21.122 --> 00:10:22.756 position:19% line:89% align:start
You heartless bastard.

00:10:24.024 --> 00:10:24.992 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:10:25.025 --> 00:10:26.561 position:38% line:89% align:start
(laughs)

00:10:26.595 --> 00:10:28.963 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're still the
same old Takemichi.

00:10:28.996 --> 00:10:30.565 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:10:30.599 --> 00:10:32.166 position:44% line:89% align:start
Wait.

00:10:32.199 --> 00:10:33.134 position:30% line:89% align:start
That necklace.

00:10:34.768 --> 00:10:37.138 position:21% line:83% align:start
(gasps) Could that be
the one I gave her?

00:10:37.171 --> 00:10:39.874 position:27% line:83% align:start
(sighs) How about
we go for a drive?

00:10:39.907 --> 00:10:42.511 position:21% line:83% align:start
Maybe that will make
it a little easier.

00:10:42.544 --> 00:10:44.378 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll drive and
you guys can talk.

00:10:44.411 --> 00:10:45.379 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:10:45.412 --> 00:10:46.413 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mm hm!

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:51.520 position:27% line:89% align:start
(engine revving)

00:10:51.553 --> 00:10:53.888 position:35% line:89% align:start
(whistling)

00:10:55.723 --> 00:10:58.092 position:19% line:83% align:start
This didn't make things
any easier at all.

00:10:59.126 --> 00:11:02.029 position:21% line:89% align:start
(instrumental music)

00:11:03.532 --> 00:11:05.166 position:16% line:89% align:start
What's going on with her?

00:11:05.199 --> 00:11:07.434 position:21% line:83% align:start
That's definitely the
necklace I gave her.

00:11:07.468 --> 00:11:08.669 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:11:08.702 --> 00:11:10.838 position:24% line:83% align:start
Does that mean that
Hina might still...

00:11:10.871 --> 00:11:12.473 position:21% line:89% align:start
(instrumental music)

00:11:12.507 --> 00:11:14.175 position:13% line:89% align:start
No, I'm sure it just means

00:11:14.208 --> 00:11:16.777 position:13% line:83% align:start
she bought a really
similar necklace later on.

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:18.979 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yeah, that must be it.

00:11:19.013 --> 00:11:22.683 position:7% line:83% align:start
Thank goodness. I was about to
get all giddy, over nothing.

00:11:22.716 --> 00:11:25.219 position:24% line:83% align:start
But I'm still gonna
look, one more time.

00:11:25.252 --> 00:11:26.187 position:33% line:89% align:start
(phone beeps)

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:27.221 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:11:30.224 --> 00:11:32.226 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Radio call] You're needed
for immediate backup.

00:11:32.259 --> 00:11:33.060 position:27% line:89% align:start
Understood, sir.

00:11:34.828 --> 00:11:36.897 position:24% line:83% align:start
Sorry. I've been
called in to work.

00:11:36.931 --> 00:11:38.098 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh.

00:11:38.132 --> 00:11:40.067 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll come by and get
the car tomorrow.

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.101 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, okay.

00:11:42.269 --> 00:11:44.738 position:16% line:83% align:start
Hey, hold on. You're
not leaving us, are you?

00:11:44.772 --> 00:11:47.408 position:19% line:83% align:start
You two need to talk
things out yourselves.

00:11:47.441 --> 00:11:49.578 position:27% line:83% align:start
I believe you're
both adults now.

00:11:49.611 --> 00:11:50.811 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey!

00:11:51.979 --> 00:11:52.980 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm.

00:11:54.616 --> 00:11:56.817 position:41% line:89% align:start
(sighs)

00:12:04.593 --> 00:12:07.261 position:27% line:89% align:start
(engine revving)

00:12:11.065 --> 00:12:13.267 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:12:19.373 --> 00:12:23.177 position:10% line:83% align:start
Crap. I had my chance there,
and I totally blew it.

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:25.813 position:19% line:83% align:start
Now I really don't know
what to say to her.

00:12:26.213 --> 00:12:28.816 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:12:31.252 --> 00:12:34.255 position:10% line:83% align:start
And I still don't know what
to think about that necklace.

00:12:34.288 --> 00:12:36.423 position:21% line:83% align:start
I wanna get a closer
look at it, but...

00:12:36.457 --> 00:12:38.292 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:12:38.325 --> 00:12:39.326 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Hey.
-Huh?

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.662 position:21% line:89% align:start
Can we stop up here?

00:12:40.695 --> 00:12:41.663 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh yeah.

00:12:41.696 --> 00:12:43.430 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:12:43.464 --> 00:12:46.668 position:27% line:89% align:start
(engine revving)

00:12:46.701 --> 00:12:49.136 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:12:52.172 --> 00:12:53.841 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why don't we take a little walk?

00:12:53.874 --> 00:12:55.776 position:33% line:89% align:start
Is that okay?

00:12:55.809 --> 00:12:56.844 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh, sure.

00:12:56.877 --> 00:12:59.346 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:13:03.884 --> 00:13:05.819 position:7% line:89% align:start
I haven't been here in forever.

00:13:05.853 --> 00:13:06.820 position:24% line:89% align:start
I always liked it.

00:13:07.788 --> 00:13:09.957 position:16% line:83% align:start
So then is this a
memorable place for you?

00:13:11.292 --> 00:13:12.293 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm.

00:13:13.093 --> 00:13:14.795 position:5% line:89% align:start
I came here with someone I love.

00:13:15.764 --> 00:13:17.097 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh,

00:13:17.131 --> 00:13:18.165 position:44% line:89% align:start
yeah.

00:13:18.198 --> 00:13:19.099 position:27% line:89% align:start
On Christmas Eve.

00:13:26.675 --> 00:13:29.744 position:10% line:83% align:start
Why am I getting all excited
thinking about that necklace,

00:13:29.778 --> 00:13:32.514 position:19% line:83% align:start
wondering if she still
has feelings for me?

00:13:32.547 --> 00:13:34.616 position:16% line:89% align:start
I mean, who am I kidding?

00:13:34.649 --> 00:13:36.884 position:13% line:89% align:start
She's 26. It's been years.

00:13:36.917 --> 00:13:38.986 position:21% line:83% align:start
Of course, she'd have
a boyfriend by now,

00:13:39.019 --> 00:13:40.354 position:21% line:89% align:start
after all this time.

00:13:40.387 --> 00:13:43.324 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm just the ex-boyfriend
she dumped 12 years ago,

00:13:43.357 --> 00:13:44.825 position:33% line:89% align:start
nothing more.

00:13:44.858 --> 00:13:47.261 position:27% line:83% align:start
So then, this is
a special place?

00:13:52.066 --> 00:13:55.670 position:19% line:83% align:start
Even now, I still
can't forget about him.

00:13:55.704 --> 00:13:57.104 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:13:57.137 --> 00:13:59.907 position:10% line:83% align:start
It was here on Christmas Eve
that he broke up with me.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:01.408 position:16% line:89% align:start
I don't wanna hear this.

00:14:05.045 --> 00:14:07.682 position:21% line:83% align:start
You mean someone
actually dumped you?

00:14:07.716 --> 00:14:09.850 position:13% line:89% align:start
What the hell am I saying?

00:14:09.883 --> 00:14:12.419 position:24% line:83% align:start
What I still don't
understand...

00:14:12.453 --> 00:14:13.621 position:21% line:89% align:start
is why he dumped me.

00:14:13.655 --> 00:14:14.855 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:14:18.392 --> 00:14:19.193 position:30% line:89% align:start
Please tell me.

00:14:20.361 --> 00:14:21.862 position:27% line:89% align:start
Why'd it happen?

00:14:21.895 --> 00:14:24.331 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:14:24.365 --> 00:14:25.866 position:21% line:89% align:start
Huh? Are you crying?

00:14:25.899 --> 00:14:27.301 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:14:27.334 --> 00:14:28.670 position:44% line:89% align:start
Wait.

00:14:28.703 --> 00:14:30.404 position:10% line:89% align:start
This person that you love...

00:14:30.437 --> 00:14:32.139 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:14:32.172 --> 00:14:33.842 position:21% line:83% align:start
The one you still
can't forget about...

00:14:33.874 --> 00:14:36.243 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:14:39.146 --> 00:14:41.915 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hold on a sec, I've
gotta go the bathroom.

00:14:41.949 --> 00:14:44.586 position:16% line:83% align:start
You go on back to the car
and I'll meet you there.

00:14:44.619 --> 00:14:46.987 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:14:50.924 --> 00:14:52.926 position:41% line:89% align:start
(sighs)

00:14:55.963 --> 00:14:58.932 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm the one who got
dumped back then right?

00:14:58.966 --> 00:15:00.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
There's no I way ended
up breaking up with Hina

00:15:01.001 --> 00:15:02.403 position:16% line:89% align:start
in this world, is there?

00:15:02.436 --> 00:15:04.938 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:15:04.972 --> 00:15:08.075 position:19% line:83% align:start
Even now, I still
can't forget about him.

00:15:09.009 --> 00:15:10.678 position:24% line:83% align:start
Does she still have
feelings for me?

00:15:10.712 --> 00:15:13.548 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:15:13.581 --> 00:15:14.915 position:13% line:89% align:start
No, of course she doesn't.

00:15:17.552 --> 00:15:18.553 position:44% line:89% align:start
But.

00:15:18.586 --> 00:15:20.755 position:16% line:83% align:start
There's no point in being
hesitant about this.

00:15:20.789 --> 00:15:23.223 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:15:26.427 --> 00:15:28.228 position:30% line:89% align:start
I gotta change.

00:15:28.262 --> 00:15:30.698 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:15:30.732 --> 00:15:32.299 position:13% line:89% align:start
So I'm gonna ask Hina out.

00:15:34.001 --> 00:15:36.370 position:19% line:83% align:start
Of course, I know it
probably won't go well.

00:15:36.403 --> 00:15:39.072 position:21% line:83% align:start
But this is a chance
to change who I am.

00:15:40.374 --> 00:15:41.475 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:43.043 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:15:43.076 --> 00:15:45.345 position:21% line:83% align:start
You were supposed to
have been in the car.

00:15:45.379 --> 00:15:46.447 position:35% line:89% align:start
This sucks.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:47.481 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:15:49.551 --> 00:15:51.351 position:21% line:89% align:start
What was that about?

00:15:51.385 --> 00:15:52.386 position:30% line:89% align:start
What a weirdo.

00:15:53.555 --> 00:15:56.323 position:10% line:83% align:start
I was hoping I could take
care of both of you at once.

00:16:00.194 --> 00:16:03.230 position:13% line:83% align:start
All that matters is for now
I'm in charge of Moebius.

00:16:03.263 --> 00:16:04.398 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm Hanma.

00:16:04.431 --> 00:16:05.232 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hanma!

00:16:09.303 --> 00:16:11.906 position:24% line:83% align:start
I've got a bad
feeling about this.

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:14.408 position:21% line:83% align:start
You were supposed to
have been in the car.

00:16:14.441 --> 00:16:15.442 position:38% line:89% align:start
The car?

00:16:16.376 --> 00:16:18.178 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:16:32.827 --> 00:16:35.996 position:21% line:83% align:start
And after I worked
up all that courage.

00:16:39.934 --> 00:16:42.704 position:27% line:89% align:start
(engine revving)

00:16:52.045 --> 00:16:55.082 position:27% line:89% align:start
(breaths heavily)

00:16:57.484 --> 00:16:58.853 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hina! No!

00:16:58.887 --> 00:17:01.623 position:27% line:89% align:start
(engine revving)

00:17:04.091 --> 00:17:06.426 position:35% line:89% align:start
(loud bang)

00:17:09.531 --> 00:17:12.199 position:24% line:89% align:start
(breathes heavily)

00:17:16.871 --> 00:17:20.642 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hina!

00:17:20.675 --> 00:17:22.510 position:21% line:89% align:start
Takemichi, that you?

00:17:23.878 --> 00:17:25.078 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.080 position:30% line:89% align:start
Why aren't you

00:17:27.715 --> 00:17:28.716 position:41% line:89% align:start
inside?

00:17:30.117 --> 00:17:34.221 position:13% line:83% align:start
It ruins everything, if
you aren't inside the car.

00:17:35.757 --> 00:17:37.124 position:33% line:89% align:start
It can't be.

00:17:38.458 --> 00:17:39.259 position:41% line:89% align:start
Akkun!

00:17:40.762 --> 00:17:42.429 position:33% line:89% align:start
Why would you

00:17:42.462 --> 00:17:43.263 position:38% line:89% align:start
do this?!

00:17:47.635 --> 00:17:48.970 position:35% line:89% align:start
(sad music)

00:17:49.003 --> 00:17:52.139 position:27% line:83% align:start
I don't know how
it got like this.

00:17:52.172 --> 00:17:53.775 position:33% line:89% align:start
I don't know

00:17:53.808 --> 00:17:56.109 position:21% line:89% align:start
how it got like this.

00:17:56.143 --> 00:18:00.180 position:21% line:83% align:start
But I'm just another
of Kisaki's soldiers.

00:18:01.181 --> 00:18:02.182 position:27% line:89% align:start
Everyone in Toman

00:18:02.951 --> 00:18:06.153 position:24% line:89% align:start
has to obey Kisaki.

00:18:06.186 --> 00:18:08.957 position:19% line:83% align:start
He's saying the same
things he said before!

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:10.692 position:27% line:83% align:start
But why would you
do this to Hina?

00:18:10.725 --> 00:18:12.125 position:27% line:89% align:start
You cut hair now.

00:18:12.159 --> 00:18:14.127 position:21% line:83% align:start
You've got nothing to
do with Toman anymore.

00:18:15.495 --> 00:18:16.931 position:33% line:89% align:start
I was scared.

00:18:16.965 --> 00:18:18.298 position:30% line:89% align:start
Just so scared

00:18:19.132 --> 00:18:20.133 position:35% line:89% align:start
of Kisaki.

00:18:21.069 --> 00:18:22.269 position:30% line:89% align:start
Don't say that!

00:18:22.904 --> 00:18:24.104 position:44% line:89% align:start
You,

00:18:24.739 --> 00:18:26.206 position:35% line:89% align:start
you have to

00:18:26.239 --> 00:18:27.875 position:30% line:89% align:start
save everyone.

00:18:27.909 --> 00:18:29.476 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:30.410 position:33% line:89% align:start
our crybaby,

00:18:31.445 --> 00:18:32.714 position:44% line:89% align:start
hero.

00:18:32.747 --> 00:18:35.717 position:21% line:83% align:start
Don't say that. You
said all this before.

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:38.052 position:24% line:83% align:start
The same things are
all happening again.

00:18:38.086 --> 00:18:39.486 position:16% line:89% align:start
Nothing's changed at all.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:41.421 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's supposed to be
all different now.

00:18:49.631 --> 00:18:51.766 position:35% line:89% align:start
(loud bang)

00:18:52.667 --> 00:18:54.769 position:38% line:89% align:start
(groans)

00:19:04.946 --> 00:19:06.146 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hina!

00:19:07.882 --> 00:19:08.883 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hina!

00:19:10.752 --> 00:19:11.853 position:33% line:89% align:start
She's alive!

00:19:11.886 --> 00:19:12.854 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hang on, Hina.

00:19:12.887 --> 00:19:14.555 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm gonna get you out of there.

00:19:14.589 --> 00:19:16.624 position:38% line:89% align:start
(groans)

00:19:25.767 --> 00:19:27.068 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hina.

00:19:27.101 --> 00:19:28.870 position:21% line:83% align:start
Come on. We've gotta
get outta here.

00:19:28.903 --> 00:19:29.904 position:35% line:89% align:start
Takemichi.

00:19:31.304 --> 00:19:33.440 position:19% line:83% align:start
Not now, we have to get
you outta this thing

00:19:33.473 --> 00:19:35.242 position:27% line:83% align:start
before it blows
us both sky high.

00:19:36.144 --> 00:19:37.512 position:24% line:89% align:start
Thanks for trying.

00:19:37.545 --> 00:19:39.947 position:10% line:83% align:start
You can tell me that after
we get you out of this thing.

00:19:41.549 --> 00:19:42.784 position:38% line:89% align:start
My legs.

00:19:42.817 --> 00:19:44.519 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:19:44.552 --> 00:19:45.352 position:35% line:89% align:start
I can't...

00:19:46.587 --> 00:19:48.656 position:21% line:83% align:start
I can't feel my legs
anymore, Takemichi.

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:49.691 position:41% line:89% align:start
I can't

00:19:50.825 --> 00:19:52.292 position:35% line:89% align:start
move them.

00:19:52.325 --> 00:19:54.662 position:27% line:89% align:start
(breaths slowly)

00:19:54.696 --> 00:19:57.197 position:33% line:89% align:start
(tense music)

00:20:10.178 --> 00:20:11.145 position:30% line:89% align:start
In the future.

00:20:11.179 --> 00:20:12.146 position:33% line:89% align:start
(tense music)

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:13.147 position:33% line:89% align:start
In the past.

00:20:13.181 --> 00:20:14.148 position:33% line:89% align:start
(tense music)

00:20:14.182 --> 00:20:15.683 position:24% line:89% align:start
Always and forever.

00:20:15.717 --> 00:20:17.151 position:33% line:89% align:start
(tense music)

00:20:17.185 --> 00:20:18.553 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'll love you.

00:20:18.586 --> 00:20:21.589 position:38% line:89% align:start
(crying)

00:20:21.622 --> 00:20:23.891 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:20:23.925 --> 00:20:25.560 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm so glad to hear that.

00:20:26.627 --> 00:20:28.328 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:20:28.361 --> 00:20:29.831 position:24% line:89% align:start
But you have to go.

00:20:29.864 --> 00:20:30.832 position:47% line:89% align:start
No!

00:20:30.865 --> 00:20:31.833 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:20:31.866 --> 00:20:34.234 position:24% line:89% align:start
Please, please go.

00:20:34.267 --> 00:20:35.570 position:13% line:89% align:start
You're so important to me,

00:20:35.603 --> 00:20:38.139 position:27% line:83% align:start
I don't want you
to die here, too.

00:20:38.172 --> 00:20:40.908 position:33% line:89% align:start
No. (sobbing)

00:20:40.942 --> 00:20:43.443 position:33% line:89% align:start
(tense music)

00:20:47.115 --> 00:20:48.750 position:27% line:89% align:start
Go now, Takemichi

00:20:48.783 --> 00:20:51.284 position:33% line:89% align:start
(tense music)

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:53.521 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hina!

00:20:56.356 --> 00:20:58.693 position:35% line:89% align:start
(loud bang)

00:21:12.774 --> 00:21:15.275 position:38% line:89% align:start
(breaths)

00:21:15.308 --> 00:21:17.879 position:27% line:89% align:start
(punches ground)

00:21:17.912 --> 00:21:20.313 position:33% line:89% align:start
(cries loud)

00:21:34.996 --> 00:21:37.231 position:35% line:89% align:start
(sad music)

00:21:37.265 --> 00:21:40.067 position:27% line:89% align:start
(breaths heavily)

00:21:46.841 --> 00:21:48.976 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm still going
to save you, Hina!

00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:50.477 position:5% line:89% align:start
No matter how many times I fail,

00:21:50.511 --> 00:21:53.514 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll keep trying
over and over again.

00:21:53.548 --> 00:21:56.383 position:13% line:83% align:start
Until I reach the future
where you're finally safe.

00:21:56.416 --> 00:21:57.985 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm never going to quit trying.

00:21:58.019 --> 00:22:00.755 position:27% line:89% align:start
(dramatic music)

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:07.394 position:13% line:89% align:start
I've made up my mind, Hina.

00:22:07.427 --> 00:22:09.664 position:27% line:89% align:start
(dramatic music)

00:22:09.697 --> 00:22:10.698 position:35% line:89% align:start
And now...

00:22:11.199 --> 00:22:12.166 position:35% line:89% align:start
Now I'm...

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:13.433 position:27% line:89% align:start
(dramatic music)

00:22:13.466 --> 00:22:14.969 position:24% line:83% align:start
...Gonna become the
leader of Toman.

00:22:17.905 --> 00:22:22.710 position:21% line:89% align:start
(closing theme music)
