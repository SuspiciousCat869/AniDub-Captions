Toman's gonna die
today! (laughs)

-(punches landing)
-(men grunting)

00:00:28.997 --> 00:00:30.163 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] These
guys sure didn't

00:00:30.197 --> 00:00:32.299 position:7% line:89% align:start
waste any time getting started!

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:33.166 position:44% line:89% align:start
Shit!

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.503 position:13% line:89% align:start
But where the hell is Baji?

00:00:35.537 --> 00:00:40.608 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(punches landing)
-(men grunting)

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:47.114 position:10% line:89% align:start
How's he beating both of us?

00:00:47.147 --> 00:00:49.283 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yeah, the kid's an
awesome fighter, isn't he?

00:00:50.618 --> 00:00:51.920 position:30% line:89% align:start

(Kazutora laughing)

00:00:53.755 --> 00:00:54.756 position:33% line:89% align:start
You're mine!

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.027 position:27% line:89% align:start
(metal clanging)

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.262 position:27% line:83% align:start
-(body thudding)
-(Draken gasping)

00:01:02.296 --> 00:01:03.731 position:47% line:89% align:start
No!

00:01:03.765 --> 00:01:08.036 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Mikey!
-(all gasping)

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:09.837 position:16% line:89% align:start
Looks like Valhalla wins.

00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:16.310 position:16% line:83% align:start
-(Mikey groaning)
-(both humming curiously)

00:01:16.343 --> 00:01:20.014 position:24% line:83% align:start
Just answer me one
question, Kazutora.

00:01:20.048 --> 00:01:23.718 position:24% line:83% align:start
Do you really think
that I'm your enemy?

00:01:23.751 --> 00:01:24.752 position:35% line:89% align:start
I suffered

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.525 position:19% line:83% align:start
because of you and the
things that you did.

00:01:30.558 --> 00:01:31.593 position:21% line:89% align:start
Did you know, Mikey?

00:01:33.861 --> 00:01:36.798 position:13% line:83% align:start
That if a person kills
someone, they're a bad guy.

00:01:36.831 --> 00:01:38.432 position:13% line:89% align:start
But if you kill your enemy,

00:01:40.535 --> 00:01:41.335 position:30% line:89% align:start
you're a hero.

00:01:43.037 --> 00:01:45.138 position:21% line:83% align:start
What the hell is this
dude talking about?

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.140 position:24% line:89% align:start
He's lost his mind.

00:01:49.176 --> 00:01:52.312 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Kazutora] I'm going to go
down in history as a hero!

00:01:52.346 --> 00:01:54.247 position:21% line:89% align:start
By killing my enemy.

00:01:54.281 --> 00:01:55.449 position:27% line:83% align:start
-(both grunting)
-(metal clanging)

00:01:55.482 --> 00:01:56.818 position:30% line:89% align:start
Get up, Mikey!

00:01:56.851 --> 00:01:59.621 position:27% line:89% align:start
(blood dripping)

00:02:01.188 --> 00:02:03.290 position:10% line:89% align:start
So you wanna kill your enemy?

00:02:04.626 --> 00:02:06.126 position:24% line:89% align:start
Is that the reason

00:02:07.629 --> 00:02:09.697 position:19% line:89% align:start
you killed my brother?

00:02:09.731 --> 00:02:11.398 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Kazutora gasping)

00:02:11.431 --> 00:02:12.600 position:27% line:83% align:start
-(both grunting)
-(nose crunching)

00:02:12.634 --> 00:02:13.601 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hey, what the hell?

00:02:13.635 --> 00:02:14.602 position:24% line:89% align:start
He's lifting me up!

00:02:14.636 --> 00:02:17.639 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Kazutora grunting)

00:02:19.073 --> 00:02:21.943 position:30% line:89% align:start

(Mikey panting)

00:02:52.774 --> 00:02:54.742 position:27% line:89% align:start
Holy shit, Mikey!

00:02:54.776 --> 00:02:56.511 position:24% line:89% align:start
What have you done?

00:02:56.544 --> 00:02:58.579 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Mikey groaning)

00:02:58.613 --> 00:03:00.180 position:27% line:89% align:start

(Valhalla gang murmuring)

00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:19.667 position:21% line:83% align:start
Looks like Mikey
just hit the ground.

00:03:19.701 --> 00:03:20.868 position:27% line:89% align:start
Maybe he's tired.

00:03:20.902 --> 00:03:22.603 position:16% line:89% align:start
He was bleeding real bad.

00:03:22.637 --> 00:03:25.506 position:30% line:89% align:start
(both panting)

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.875 position:21% line:83% align:start
(chuckles) I think
you did it, Kazutora.

00:03:30.377 --> 00:03:33.114 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Valhalla Member] Hey,
Mikey's not moving at all!

00:03:33.147 --> 00:03:35.348 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yeah, maybe we can
finish him off now!

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.221 position:21% line:83% align:start
This is our best
chance, let's do it!

00:03:41.254 --> 00:03:44.192 position:16% line:89% align:start
(Valhalla gang murmuring)

00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:45.225 position:35% line:89% align:start
Follow me!

00:03:45.258 --> 00:03:46.861 position:10% line:89% align:start
We're gonna take Mikey down!

00:03:46.894 --> 00:03:51.032 position:19% line:89% align:start
(Valhalla gang roaring)

00:03:51.065 --> 00:03:52.200 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, shit!

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:54.234 position:19% line:83% align:start
There's still one
Valhalla captain left!

00:03:54.267 --> 00:03:56.637 position:19% line:83% align:start
We're gonna finish all
these Toman bastards!

00:03:56.671 --> 00:03:58.139 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hey, wait a sec!

00:03:58.172 --> 00:04:00.108 position:24% line:83% align:start
I've seen that guy
somewhere before!

00:04:00.141 --> 00:04:01.109 position:38% line:89% align:start
Come on!

00:04:01.142 --> 00:04:02.442 position:41% line:89% align:start
Do it!

00:04:02.476 --> 00:04:05.445 position:16% line:89% align:start
(Valhalla gang clamoring)

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:06.647 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey!

00:04:06.681 --> 00:04:09.150 position:27% line:83% align:start
Guys, somebody go
and help Mikey!

I have to save him!

00:04:50.792 --> 00:04:52.459 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm coming, Mikey!

Tetta Kisaki.

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:57.979 position:19% line:83% align:start
Our division is here to

(Takemichi breathing shakily)

00:08:19.934 --> 00:08:22.103 position:27% line:83% align:start
That dude wearing
the black mask!

00:08:22.136 --> 00:08:24.605 position:19% line:89% align:start
I saw him with Kisaki!

00:08:25.773 --> 00:08:27.508 position:16% line:89% align:start
But what does that mean?

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:30.177 position:44% line:89% align:start
Heh.

00:08:30.211 --> 00:08:32.613 position:19% line:89% align:start
Good job there, Kisaki!

00:08:32.646 --> 00:08:35.750 position:19% line:83% align:start
(growls) Look at him
trying to take command!

Huh?

Oh, wait, I see now!

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.989 position:13% line:83% align:start
Kisaki doesn't really
care if we win this fight,

00:08:42.023 --> 00:08:43.257 position:27% line:89% align:start
or if we lose it!

00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:44.792 position:10% line:89% align:start
It works for him either way!

Mikey like that!

Way to go, Kisaki!

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:51.432 position:5% line:89% align:start
You have to admit, for a newbie,

00:08:51.465 --> 00:08:52.867 position:10% line:89% align:start
he's sure pulling his weight!

00:08:54.135 --> 00:08:56.771 position:16% line:83% align:start
If he sucks up to Mikey
like this and Toman wins,

00:08:56.804 --> 00:08:58.839 position:5% line:89% align:start
Kisaki's gonna look like a hero!

00:08:58.873 --> 00:09:01.976 position:5% line:83% align:start
But if we lose, Valhalla's
just gonna absorb Toman anyway!

00:09:02.009 --> 00:09:04.478 position:16% line:83% align:start
So it doesn't even matter
how this fight goes!

00:09:04.513 --> 00:09:07.548 position:21% line:83% align:start
Taking over Toman was
his plan all along!

00:09:07.581 --> 00:09:09.917 position:27% line:83% align:start
Aw, look at him
playing the hero!

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:11.619 position:30% line:89% align:start
What the hell?

00:09:11.652 --> 00:09:13.621 position:16% line:83% align:start
Everybody's just playing
right into his hands!

00:09:13.654 --> 00:09:15.289 position:27% line:83% align:start
This thing turned
in Kisaki's favor

00:09:15.322 --> 00:09:16.824 position:13% line:89% align:start
before I even realized it!

00:09:18.492 --> 00:09:19.693 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Draken] Kisaki!

00:09:20.494 --> 00:09:21.695 position:35% line:89% align:start
Good work!

00:09:23.264 --> 00:09:26.267 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasping)

00:09:28.869 --> 00:09:29.804 position:47% line:89% align:start
No!

00:09:29.837 --> 00:09:31.005 position:47% line:89% align:start
No!

00:09:31.038 --> 00:09:31.839 position:35% line:89% align:start
No, Draken!

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:34.442 position:16% line:89% align:start
You've got it all wrong!

00:09:34.475 --> 00:09:36.277 position:16% line:89% align:start
He's not what you think!

00:09:37.178 --> 00:09:38.646 position:35% line:89% align:start
Toman is...

00:09:38.679 --> 00:09:40.714 position:13% line:89% align:start
Draken, Kisaki is gonna...

00:09:42.216 --> 00:09:44.485 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm leaving Mikey in your hands!

00:09:44.519 --> 00:09:47.721 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi sobbing)

00:09:50.124 --> 00:09:53.027 position:21% line:89% align:start
(footsteps clunking)

00:09:54.529 --> 00:09:56.897 position:5% line:89% align:start
At long last, the time has come!

00:09:56.931 --> 00:09:59.166 position:7% line:89% align:start
(Kisaki humming questioningly)

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.201 position:41% line:89% align:start
Kisaki!

00:10:01.969 --> 00:10:03.037 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Kisaki gasping)

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:04.271 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasping)

00:10:04.305 --> 00:10:05.574 position:27% line:83% align:start
-(Baji grunting)
-(metal clanging)

00:10:05.606 --> 00:10:08.409 position:24% line:89% align:start
(glasses cracking)

00:10:08.442 --> 00:10:11.745 position:19% line:89% align:start
(Baji laughing evilly)

00:10:13.114 --> 00:10:15.584 position:30% line:89% align:start
(body thudding)

00:10:15.616 --> 00:10:17.251 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasping)

00:10:17.284 --> 00:10:19.086 position:16% line:89% align:start
(Valhalla gang murmuring)

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.422 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Baji!

00:10:21.455 --> 00:10:24.391 position:33% line:89% align:start
(all gasping)

00:10:24.425 --> 00:10:25.960 position:44% line:89% align:start
Baji!

00:10:25.993 --> 00:10:27.294 position:47% line:89% align:start
No!

00:10:27.328 --> 00:10:29.096 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Baji] Get your ass up, Kisaki.

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:34.135 position:13% line:83% align:start
-I'm not done with you yet!
-(Valhalla gang cheering)

00:10:34.635 --> 00:10:35.636 position:41% line:89% align:start
Get up!

00:10:36.403 --> 00:10:38.339 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna jack up
your face so bad

00:10:38.372 --> 00:10:40.674 position:10% line:89% align:start
no one'll even recognize you!

00:10:40.708 --> 00:10:41.842 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasping)

00:10:41.876 --> 00:10:45.479 position:19% line:83% align:start
So Baji was suspicious
of Kisaki too!

00:10:45.514 --> 00:10:47.815 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Draken, wait!
-Baji, stop it!

00:10:47.848 --> 00:10:50.684 position:10% line:83% align:start
We're gonna take you back to
Toman when this is all over!

00:10:50.718 --> 00:10:52.353 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Baji growling)

00:10:52.386 --> 00:10:54.021 position:13% line:89% align:start
(Baji grunting in surprise)

00:10:54.054 --> 00:10:55.389 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Baji screaming)

00:10:55.422 --> 00:10:58.692 position:27% line:83% align:start
-(body thudding)
-(Baji grunting)

00:10:58.726 --> 00:11:00.629 position:7% line:89% align:start
(Hamada grunting dismissively)

00:11:00.661 --> 00:11:03.063 position:19% line:89% align:start
You all right, Kisaki?

00:11:03.097 --> 00:11:04.865 position:27% line:89% align:start
Buzz, buzz, buzz.

00:11:04.899 --> 00:11:07.801 position:21% line:83% align:start
He's like a damn fly
buzzing around me.

00:11:07.835 --> 00:11:11.305 position:21% line:89% align:start
(glasses clattering)

00:11:11.338 --> 00:11:12.840 position:24% line:89% align:start
Swat that fly dead.

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:20.014 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasping)

00:11:20.047 --> 00:11:21.415 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Baji] Yeah?

00:11:21.448 --> 00:11:23.017 position:16% line:89% align:start
Well, bring it on, then!

00:11:24.351 --> 00:11:27.755 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Baji grunting)

00:11:27.788 --> 00:11:28.789 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm right here!

00:11:30.457 --> 00:11:33.027 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Kisaki scoffing)

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:34.361 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, man!

00:11:34.395 --> 00:11:35.996 position:19% line:89% align:start
(footsteps approaching)

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:37.264 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:11:37.298 --> 00:11:41.902 position:21% line:83% align:start
-(Chifuyu panting)
-(footsteps clunking)

00:11:42.537 --> 00:11:43.737 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:11:47.542 --> 00:11:51.078 position:27% line:83% align:start
(Chifuyu grunting
in determination)

00:11:51.111 --> 00:11:52.746 position:38% line:89% align:start
Chifuyu.

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:55.049 position:7% line:89% align:start
What do you think you're doing?

00:11:55.082 --> 00:11:56.417 position:38% line:89% align:start
Baji, no.

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:57.785 position:30% line:89% align:start
Don't do this.

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:01.556 position:10% line:89% align:start
If you take Kisaki down now,

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:03.457 position:24% line:83% align:start
it'll be a complete
betrayal of Mikey.

00:12:04.725 --> 00:12:07.194 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Baji scoffing)

00:12:07.228 --> 00:12:09.496 position:19% line:83% align:start
If you have any
allegiance left in you,

00:12:09.531 --> 00:12:11.799 position:27% line:83% align:start
-for Toman or-
-(grunts in pain)

00:12:11.832 --> 00:12:14.502 position:30% line:89% align:start
(body thudding)

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:18.673 position:19% line:83% align:start
Who the hell do you
think you are, Chifuyu?

00:12:18.707 --> 00:12:21.175 position:27% line:83% align:start
The only reason I
had you at my side

00:12:21.208 --> 00:12:24.178 position:21% line:83% align:start
was because you were
a decent fighter.

00:12:24.211 --> 00:12:26.213 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Chifuyu grunting)

00:12:26.247 --> 00:12:29.183 position:21% line:83% align:start
I don't give a rat's
ass what you think.

00:12:29.216 --> 00:12:32.721 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Chifuyu panting)

00:12:32.753 --> 00:12:35.690 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm still the First
Division Vice Captain!

00:12:35.724 --> 00:12:37.925 position:21% line:83% align:start
So it's still my job
to protect you, Baji!

00:12:39.994 --> 00:12:42.763 position:7% line:89% align:start
(Baji humming in consideration)

00:12:42.796 --> 00:12:44.666 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Chifuyu panting)

00:12:44.699 --> 00:12:47.602 position:21% line:83% align:start
But I'll have to stop
you if you keep going.

00:12:47.636 --> 00:12:49.403 position:24% line:83% align:start
And I won't go easy
on you, either!

00:12:51.839 --> 00:12:53.007 position:27% line:89% align:start
Go for it, then.

00:12:54.609 --> 00:12:58.279 position:13% line:89% align:start
(Chifuyu breathing shakily)

00:13:01.382 --> 00:13:02.983 position:24% line:89% align:start
You got 10 seconds.

00:13:03.017 --> 00:13:04.184 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:13:04.218 --> 00:13:05.319 position:35% line:89% align:start
[Baji] 10.

00:13:05.352 --> 00:13:06.755 position:44% line:89% align:start
Nine.

00:13:06.787 --> 00:13:08.088 position:41% line:89% align:start
Eight.

00:13:08.122 --> 00:13:09.189 position:41% line:89% align:start
Seven.

00:13:09.223 --> 00:13:10.858 position:44% line:89% align:start
Six.

00:13:10.891 --> 00:13:12.059 position:33% line:89% align:start
What's wrong?

00:13:12.092 --> 00:13:14.596 position:19% line:83% align:start
I thought you said you
were gonna stop me.

00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:15.597 position:44% line:89% align:start
Five.

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:16.830 position:44% line:89% align:start
Four.

00:13:17.831 --> 00:13:20.267 position:16% line:83% align:start
The only way you'll stop
me is by killing me.

00:13:22.102 --> 00:13:23.237 position:41% line:89% align:start
Three.

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:24.739 position:44% line:89% align:start
Two.

00:13:24.773 --> 00:13:25.573 position:44% line:89% align:start
One.

00:13:27.074 --> 00:13:28.409 position:44% line:89% align:start
Zero.

(both grunting)

00:13:40.854 --> 00:13:43.692 position:16% line:83% align:start
Get over here and help me
out with this, Chifuyu!

00:13:43.725 --> 00:13:45.159 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Chifuyu gasping)

00:13:45.192 --> 00:13:47.861 position:24% line:83% align:start
Come on, we can
stop Baji together!

00:13:47.895 --> 00:13:50.064 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Baji grunting)

00:13:50.097 --> 00:13:50.898 position:38% line:89% align:start
Chifuyu!

00:13:53.735 --> 00:13:55.302 position:33% line:89% align:start
It's no use.

00:13:55.336 --> 00:13:57.037 position:30% line:89% align:start
I can't do it.

00:13:57.071 --> 00:13:57.871 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:14:01.108 --> 00:14:01.909 position:41% line:89% align:start
I just

00:14:03.511 --> 00:14:05.179 position:30% line:89% align:start
can't hit Baji.

00:14:05.212 --> 00:14:06.013 position:33% line:89% align:start
I just can't.

00:14:07.114 --> 00:14:08.315 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:14:08.349 --> 00:14:10.652 position:27% line:83% align:start
What the hell are
you talking about?

00:14:10.685 --> 00:14:12.587 position:27% line:83% align:start
-(both grunting)
-(impact landing)

(Takemichi groaning)

00:14:16.156 --> 00:14:16.957 position:44% line:89% align:start
Shit!

00:14:18.693 --> 00:14:19.993 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm passing out!

00:14:21.962 --> 00:14:24.365 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi grunting)

00:14:24.398 --> 00:14:26.100 position:21% line:89% align:start
I have to stop Baji!

00:14:26.133 --> 00:14:27.602 position:38% line:89% align:start
Somehow!

00:14:27.635 --> 00:14:30.104 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi grunting)

00:14:30.137 --> 00:14:32.272 position:10% line:89% align:start
(Baji humming questioningly)

00:14:32.306 --> 00:14:35.476 position:19% line:83% align:start
I know Baji's going to
be killed by Kisaki!

00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:38.879 position:16% line:89% align:start
So I have to protect him!

00:14:40.582 --> 00:14:42.916 position:27% line:83% align:start
Even if I have to
do it by myself!

(Takemichi gasping)

00:14:44.251 --> 00:14:45.219 position:38% line:89% align:start
But wait!

00:14:45.252 --> 00:14:48.590 position:19% line:83% align:start
The one who's gonna
kill Baji isn't Kisaki!

00:14:48.623 --> 00:14:51.058 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's supposed to be Kazutora!

00:14:52.627 --> 00:14:53.695 position:33% line:89% align:start
Where is he?

00:14:53.728 --> 00:14:55.896 position:27% line:89% align:start
Kazutora's gone!

00:14:55.929 --> 00:15:00.934 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(knife squelching)
-(Takemichi gasping)

(Baji gasping)

00:15:12.279 --> 00:15:13.380 position:38% line:89% align:start
Now die!

00:15:13.414 --> 00:15:14.415 position:44% line:89% align:start
Baji!

00:15:15.416 --> 00:15:16.818 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasping)

00:15:16.851 --> 00:15:18.385 position:38% line:89% align:start
Kazutora!

00:15:18.419 --> 00:15:19.721 position:47% line:89% align:start
No!

00:15:19.754 --> 00:15:21.689 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Chifuyu gasping)

00:15:21.723 --> 00:15:25.192 position:16% line:89% align:start
(Baji breathing shakily)

00:15:31.365 --> 00:15:32.700 position:38% line:89% align:start
Now die!

00:15:32.734 --> 00:15:33.934 position:44% line:89% align:start
Baji!

00:15:35.269 --> 00:15:36.704 position:38% line:89% align:start
Kazutora!

00:15:36.738 --> 00:15:38.005 position:47% line:89% align:start
No!

00:15:38.773 --> 00:15:42.911 position:16% line:89% align:start
(Baji breathing shakily)

00:15:42.943 --> 00:15:46.447 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi roaring)

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:47.649 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi grunting)

00:15:47.682 --> 00:15:49.851 position:7% line:89% align:start
If Baji is killed by Kazutora,

00:15:49.884 --> 00:15:51.820 position:24% line:83% align:start
we'll be stuck with
that future again!

00:15:51.853 --> 00:15:53.353 position:27% line:89% align:start
(bodies thudding)

00:15:53.387 --> 00:15:54.756 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hey, Baji!

00:15:54.789 --> 00:15:56.023 position:21% line:89% align:start
How bad are you hurt?

00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:59.627 position:30% line:89% align:start
(wind howling)

00:16:02.564 --> 00:16:03.665 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasping)

00:16:03.698 --> 00:16:05.165 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Baji] It's just a scratch.

00:16:06.734 --> 00:16:08.736 position:7% line:89% align:start
Thank you for that, Takemichi.

00:16:09.504 --> 00:16:10.705 position:33% line:89% align:start
So I did it?

00:16:10.738 --> 00:16:12.874 position:27% line:89% align:start
(exhales shakily)

00:16:12.907 --> 00:16:14.742 position:19% line:89% align:start
I managed to save Baji?

00:16:16.578 --> 00:16:17.579 position:38% line:89% align:start
Kazutora!

00:16:18.913 --> 00:16:20.280 position:30% line:89% align:start
What the hell?

00:16:20.314 --> 00:16:23.116 position:5% line:83% align:start
What do you think you're doing,
stabbing Baji, you idiot?

00:16:23.984 --> 00:16:24.985 position:38% line:89% align:start
It's him.

00:16:26.286 --> 00:16:28.088 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's all Baji's own fault.

00:16:28.957 --> 00:16:31.058 position:13% line:89% align:start
(Chifuyu grunting in shock)

00:16:31.091 --> 00:16:32.627 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(Chifuyu growling)
-(body thudding)

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.461 position:35% line:89% align:start
Is he okay?

00:16:34.495 --> 00:16:37.364 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi panting)

00:16:41.703 --> 00:16:42.737 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's a damn good thing

00:16:43.671 --> 00:16:44.739 position:24% line:89% align:start
you're still alive.

00:16:46.273 --> 00:16:47.074 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:16:47.107 --> 00:16:48.776 position:27% line:83% align:start
What the hell are
you talking about?

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:50.979 position:30% line:89% align:start
Uh, well, I...

00:16:51.011 --> 00:16:52.881 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm going to kill Kisaki!

00:16:52.914 --> 00:16:55.550 position:24% line:83% align:start
So just stay out of
my way, all of you!

00:16:55.583 --> 00:16:58.218 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi panting)

00:16:58.252 --> 00:16:59.186 position:38% line:89% align:start
Damn it!

00:16:59.219 --> 00:17:01.088 position:7% line:89% align:start
What the hell is going on here?

00:17:01.856 --> 00:17:03.691 position:24% line:89% align:start
The fight started,

00:17:03.725 --> 00:17:05.092 position:21% line:89% align:start
then Mikey went down.

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:07.629 position:27% line:89% align:start
Kisaki saved him,

00:17:07.662 --> 00:17:10.364 position:19% line:83% align:start
and then Baji showed up
and went after Kisaki.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.035 position:16% line:83% align:start
And then, out of nowhere,
Kazutora stabbed Baji!

00:17:17.204 --> 00:17:19.007 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's a total mess!

00:17:19.039 --> 00:17:20.508 position:16% line:89% align:start
What am I supposed to do?

00:17:21.676 --> 00:17:22.677 position:38% line:89% align:start
But wait!

00:17:23.678 --> 00:17:25.813 position:19% line:83% align:start
Baji was killed too,
right in front of him.

00:17:27.381 --> 00:17:30.484 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] But Kazutora
backed off of killing Baji!

00:17:30.518 --> 00:17:32.152 position:35% line:89% align:start
Which means

00:17:32.185 --> 00:17:35.690 position:5% line:83% align:start
now Mikey doesn't have a reason
to kill Kazutora anymore!

00:17:35.723 --> 00:17:36.724 position:35% line:89% align:start
Which means

00:17:38.026 --> 00:17:40.294 position:19% line:83% align:start
there's only one thing
left for me to do now!

00:17:43.063 --> 00:17:45.198 position:24% line:89% align:start
So I'm going to...

00:17:45.232 --> 00:17:47.936 position:24% line:83% align:start
Lead Toman and rise
as its new leader!

00:17:47.969 --> 00:17:50.038 position:24% line:89% align:start
By crushing Kisaki!

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:52.740 position:30% line:89% align:start
(intense music)

00:17:55.442 --> 00:17:56.243 position:38% line:89% align:start
Chifuyu!

00:17:57.745 --> 00:18:00.782 position:5% line:89% align:start
(Chifuyu grunting affirmatively)

00:18:00.815 --> 00:18:02.884 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Baji sighing)

00:18:02.917 --> 00:18:05.218 position:24% line:83% align:start
(Takemichi humming
questioningly)

00:18:05.252 --> 00:18:07.120 position:19% line:89% align:start
So you want Kisaki too?

00:18:08.355 --> 00:18:09.356 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:18:10.257 --> 00:18:12.727 position:19% line:83% align:start
So we should work
together to fight him!

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:13.995 position:27% line:83% align:start
-(both grunting)
-(punch landing)

00:18:14.028 --> 00:18:17.230 position:27% line:83% align:start
-(both grunting)
-(punch landing)

00:18:17.264 --> 00:18:18.766 position:24% line:89% align:start
Stay out of my way.

00:18:20.467 --> 00:18:21.636 position:27% line:89% align:start
Let us help you!

00:18:21.669 --> 00:18:23.871 position:13% line:83% align:start
Baji, there's no reason
you have to do this alone!

00:18:27.742 --> 00:18:29.142 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi cringing)

00:18:30.545 --> 00:18:31.546 position:33% line:89% align:start
Baji, don't.

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:35.248 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasping)

00:18:35.282 --> 00:18:38.418 position:21% line:89% align:start
(footsteps clunking)

00:18:41.723 --> 00:18:43.457 position:13% line:89% align:start
Take care of Mikey for me.

00:18:44.759 --> 00:18:47.762 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasping)

00:18:47.795 --> 00:18:50.898 position:21% line:89% align:start
(footsteps clunking)

00:18:55.469 --> 00:18:58.606 position:16% line:83% align:start
Why are you in such a
hurry to die, my Captain?

00:18:59.774 --> 00:19:00.775 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:19:03.077 --> 00:19:07.214 position:10% line:89% align:start
And now... (breathes deeply)

00:19:07.247 --> 00:19:10.283 position:19% line:83% align:start
50 members of the Third
Division versus me!

00:19:13.755 --> 00:19:16.223 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Kisaki scoffing)

(Baji sighing)

00:19:23.898 --> 00:19:25.900 position:13% line:89% align:start
Bring it on, you bastards!

00:19:25.933 --> 00:19:28.903 position:30% line:89% align:start
(wind howling)

00:19:28.936 --> 00:19:31.773 position:24% line:89% align:start
(metal clattering)

00:19:31.806 --> 00:19:34.174 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm coming for you!

00:19:34.207 --> 00:19:37.078 position:19% line:83% align:start
Oh, come on, 50 against
one is impossible odds!

00:19:37.111 --> 00:19:40.081 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Baji panting)

00:19:40.114 --> 00:19:41.281 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Baji roaring)

-(glass shattering)
-(men grunting)

00:19:53.027 --> 00:19:55.029 position:35% line:89% align:start
Holy shit!

00:19:55.063 --> 00:19:57.799 position:16% line:83% align:start
Oh, you ain't seen
nothin' yet, Takemitchy.

00:19:57.832 --> 00:20:01.035 position:19% line:83% align:start
Didn't he swear he was
gonna take Kisaki down?

00:20:01.069 --> 00:20:02.302 position:27% line:83% align:start
-(metal clanging)
-(men grunting)

00:20:02.335 --> 00:20:05.807 position:19% line:83% align:start
He never, ever, makes a
promise he can't keep.

00:20:07.307 --> 00:20:08.609 position:13% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasping in awe)

(phone beeping)

00:20:14.148 --> 00:20:16.249 position:7% line:89% align:start
I guess Kazutora screwed it up.

00:20:17.384 --> 00:20:18.853 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Kisaki growling)

00:20:18.886 --> 00:20:20.621 position:19% line:89% align:start
Baji's coming, Hamada.

00:20:20.655 --> 00:20:22.990 position:19% line:83% align:start
If you space out again
like the last time,

00:20:23.024 --> 00:20:24.959 position:7% line:89% align:start
I swear I'll murder you myself.

00:20:24.992 --> 00:20:26.527 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry, sir!

00:20:26.561 --> 00:20:29.362 position:19% line:83% align:start
And don't underestimate
Keisuke Baji.

00:20:29.396 --> 00:20:31.733 position:19% line:83% align:start
In all this time, he's
still the only one

00:20:31.766 --> 00:20:32.800 position:21% line:89% align:start
who's ever beaten me.

00:20:34.234 --> 00:20:36.170 position:21% line:83% align:start
I know that I let my
guard down before,

00:20:36.204 --> 00:20:38.072 position:24% line:89% align:start
but not this time!

00:20:38.106 --> 00:20:39.239 position:24% line:83% align:start
There's no way
he'll get the drop-

-(Hamada grunting)

(Kisaki grunting in shock)

00:20:45.079 --> 00:20:47.115 position:10% line:89% align:start
Looks like that's checkmate.

(intense music)

00:20:54.155 --> 00:20:55.355 position:33% line:89% align:start
You're done.

00:20:57.925 --> 00:21:00.762 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Kisaki growling)

00:21:01.662 --> 00:21:03.263 position:41% line:89% align:start
No way!

00:21:03.296 --> 00:21:04.297 position:38% line:89% align:start
Baji won?

00:21:06.167 --> 00:21:09.170 position:7% line:89% align:start
(Kisaki sighing in resignation)

00:21:09.203 --> 00:21:10.238 position:24% line:89% align:start
Just try it, then.

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:11.606 position:16% line:89% align:start
You don't have the guts!

00:21:13.273 --> 00:21:17.078 position:13% line:89% align:start
(Baji scoffing derisively)

00:21:17.111 --> 00:21:18.780 position:44% line:89% align:start

(wind howling)

00:21:24.384 --> 00:21:27.722 position:33% line:89% align:start

00:21:45.139 --> 00:21:47.275 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm done, I guess.
