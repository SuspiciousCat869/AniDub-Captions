(dramatic instrumental music)

00:00:11.813 --> 00:00:13.080 position:35% line:89% align:start
Fact is...

00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:16.016 position:13% line:89% align:start
I can't fight against Baji.

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.285 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:21.021 position:21% line:83% align:start
That's honestly where
I stand on this!

00:00:21.054 --> 00:00:23.223 position:7% line:89% align:start
What I need is for you to help!

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:26.326 position:19% line:83% align:start
Tomorrow, we are going
to crush Valhalla

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.295 position:10% line:89% align:start
and bring Baji back to Toman!

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:30.364 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's how this
battle's gonna go down!

00:00:30.397 --> 00:00:32.499 position:38% line:89% align:start
(cheers)

00:00:34.536 --> 00:00:35.637 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Mikey!

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.771 position:44% line:89% align:start
Wow!

00:00:36.804 --> 00:00:37.772 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hey...

00:00:37.805 --> 00:00:39.273 position:16% line:89% align:start
who are all these people?

00:00:39.306 --> 00:00:42.075 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Chifuyu] Toman versus
Valhalla is a big draw.

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:44.077 position:21% line:83% align:start
So all the delinquent
bosses around Tokyo

00:00:44.111 --> 00:00:45.813 position:21% line:83% align:start
are gonna be watching
this closely.

00:00:46.748 --> 00:00:49.049 position:10% line:89% align:start
Well that's enough chit-chat!

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:51.251 position:7% line:89% align:start
Let's bring out today's stars!

00:00:51.285 --> 00:00:53.487 position:13% line:89% align:start
All right, on this side...

00:00:54.956 --> 00:00:57.157 position:24% line:89% align:start
Tokyo Manji Gang!!

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.094 position:33% line:89% align:start
And Valhalla!

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.766 position:16% line:83% align:start
We only have one
condition for this fight.

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.233 position:19% line:89% align:start
Keisuke Baji's return.

00:01:07.802 --> 00:01:09.136 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's all I'm gonna say.

00:01:12.774 --> 00:01:14.174 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Kazutora] Then bring it on!

00:01:14.207 --> 00:01:16.578 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hey punk, are you gonna
fight here or you gonna-

00:01:16.611 --> 00:01:18.245 position:38% line:89% align:start
(grunts)

00:01:19.714 --> 00:01:21.181 position:27% line:89% align:start
(earring jangles)

00:01:21.214 --> 00:01:23.116 position:24% line:89% align:start
Come on. Get real.

00:01:25.285 --> 00:01:27.622 position:21% line:83% align:start
We came here to beat
the shit outta you

00:01:27.655 --> 00:01:29.156 position:19% line:89% align:start
and leave you all dead!

00:01:30.792 --> 00:01:31.859 position:30% line:89% align:start
Let's get them!

00:01:31.893 --> 00:01:32.860 position:41% line:89% align:start
Toman!

00:01:32.894 --> 00:01:35.462 position:30% line:89% align:start
(gang growling)

00:01:37.031 --> 00:01:38.766 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Shuji] Kill 'em all, Valhalla!!

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.536 position:27% line:5% align:start
(gangs shouting)

00:01:43.037 --> 00:01:44.539 position:27% line:89% align:start
Toman dies today!

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:48.810 position:27% line:89% align:start
(gangs shouting)

00:01:51.478 --> 00:01:53.480 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:01:53.514 --> 00:01:55.550 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:01:59.152 --> 00:02:00.153 position:33% line:89% align:start

00:02:00.187 --> 00:02:03.156 position:35% line:89% align:start
(groaning)

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.392 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:02:14.002 --> 00:02:15.469 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Whoa!

00:02:15.503 --> 00:02:17.739 position:10% line:83% align:start
These guys sure didn't waste
any time getting started!

00:02:17.772 --> 00:02:18.740 position:44% line:89% align:start
Shit!

00:02:18.773 --> 00:02:19.741 position:41% line:89% align:start
But...

00:02:19.774 --> 00:02:21.475 position:19% line:89% align:start
where the hell is Baji?

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:23.511 position:35% line:89% align:start
(shouting)

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.483 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:39.192 position:30% line:89% align:start
Here it comes!

00:02:40.862 --> 00:02:44.398 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mikey!

00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:48.235 position:13% line:89% align:start
(dramatic orchestral music)

00:02:51.405 --> 00:02:54.709 position:13% line:83% align:start
Like I'd ever let you lay a
finger on Mikey, Kazutora.

00:02:54.742 --> 00:02:57.078 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're gonna have to
get through me first.

00:02:57.111 --> 00:02:58.546 position:30% line:89% align:start
Oh is that so?

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:03.518 position:38% line:89% align:start
(grunts)

00:03:03.551 --> 00:03:05.753 position:35% line:89% align:start
(groaning)

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:09.356 position:38% line:89% align:start
At last!

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.192 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're gonna get your
ass kicked by me, Draken!

00:03:14.261 --> 00:03:17.197 position:19% line:83% align:start
Bring it on then Hanma.
Let's see what you got.

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:21.169 position:24% line:83% align:start
Have fun Kazutora!
Mikey's all yours!

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:22.737 position:24% line:89% align:start
Let's get started!

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.739 position:35% line:89% align:start
(chuckling)

00:03:24.772 --> 00:03:29.309 position:13% line:89% align:start
(intense orchestral music)

00:03:29.342 --> 00:03:31.846 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're gonna at least
be entertaining yeah?

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:34.682 position:10% line:89% align:start
Mr. Vice Captain. (chuckles)

00:03:34.716 --> 00:03:36.050 position:30% line:89% align:start
(punches hand)

00:03:36.084 --> 00:03:37.752 position:7% line:89% align:start
Oh I wouldn't worry about that.

00:03:37.785 --> 00:03:40.788 position:7% line:83% align:start
I can't even remember the
last time I got to go all-out.

00:03:42.322 --> 00:03:44.391 position:21% line:89% align:start
How about this, huh?

00:03:44.424 --> 00:03:47.628 position:13% line:83% align:start
Man, I've been waiting for
this for a long time Mikey!

00:03:47.662 --> 00:03:48.996 position:35% line:89% align:start
(chuckles)

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.732 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm not gonna hold
back Kazutora.

00:03:50.765 --> 00:03:52.066 position:24% line:89% align:start
Too late for that.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.469 position:27% line:89% align:start
(gangs shouting)

00:03:55.503 --> 00:04:00.508 position:21% line:89% align:start
(opening theme music)

00:05:25.193 --> 00:05:27.460 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:05:30.865 --> 00:05:33.868 position:24% line:89% align:start
(breathing heavily)

00:05:35.503 --> 00:05:39.040 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] Mikey and
Kazutora are facing off?

00:05:39.073 --> 00:05:40.340 position:38% line:89% align:start
(groans)

00:05:40.373 --> 00:05:43.044 position:19% line:83% align:start
You picked a bad place
to daydream, asshole!

00:05:43.945 --> 00:05:46.047 position:38% line:89% align:start
(grunts)

00:05:46.881 --> 00:05:49.349 position:35% line:89% align:start
(shouting)

00:05:49.382 --> 00:05:50.918 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Shit, I'm gonna die!

00:05:50.952 --> 00:05:51.919 position:38% line:89% align:start
(grunts)

00:05:51.953 --> 00:05:54.421 position:35% line:89% align:start
(groaning)

00:05:59.392 --> 00:06:01.394 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:06:01.428 --> 00:06:03.798 position:24% line:89% align:start
Stand up Takemichi.

00:06:05.299 --> 00:06:06.567 position:16% line:89% align:start
Thanks for that Mitsuya!

00:06:08.903 --> 00:06:09.737 position:24% line:89% align:start
You're a lifesaver!

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:13.074 position:38% line:89% align:start
(scoffs)

00:06:13.107 --> 00:06:14.842 position:21% line:89% align:start
And you're a dumbass!

00:06:14.876 --> 00:06:16.143 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:06:16.177 --> 00:06:17.345 position:30% line:89% align:start
What the hell?

00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:19.379 position:19% line:83% align:start
You come here to stand
around and watch?

00:06:19.412 --> 00:06:21.849 position:21% line:83% align:start
We're here to fight!
Every last one of us!

00:06:21.883 --> 00:06:23.317 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're part of the
Second Division

00:06:23.351 --> 00:06:24.719 position:16% line:89% align:start
and don't you forget it!

00:06:27.054 --> 00:06:28.055 position:35% line:89% align:start
(shouting)

00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:30.191 position:38% line:89% align:start
(grunts)

00:06:30.224 --> 00:06:31.926 position:27% line:83% align:start
So get your head
in the game, kid!

00:06:33.127 --> 00:06:34.695 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Yeah, he's right!

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:38.099 position:7% line:83% align:start
Besides, if I get killed here,
what the hell was the point?

00:06:38.132 --> 00:06:39.634 position:13% line:89% align:start
(dramatic orchestral music)

00:06:39.667 --> 00:06:43.004 position:13% line:83% align:start
I need to focus, just focus
on the enemy in front of me!

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:46.307 position:35% line:83% align:start
-(growling)
-(gasps)

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.775 position:27% line:89% align:start
Wait, wait, wait!

00:06:47.808 --> 00:06:50.645 position:10% line:83% align:start
The enemy's already in front
of me? A loser like me?

00:06:50.678 --> 00:06:53.413 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm actually here, actually
fighting real delinquents?

00:06:53.446 --> 00:06:55.016 position:21% line:89% align:start
No, no, no! I can't!

00:06:55.049 --> 00:06:56.817 position:19% line:89% align:start
This is too terrifying!

00:06:56.851 --> 00:06:58.986 position:35% line:89% align:start
(screaming)

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.021 position:35% line:89% align:start
You scared?

00:07:02.823 --> 00:07:05.660 position:13% line:83% align:start
Just keep your eyes on the
enemy in front of you...

00:07:05.693 --> 00:07:06.827 position:38% line:89% align:start
partner.

00:07:06.861 --> 00:07:07.628 position:38% line:89% align:start
Chifuyu!

00:07:09.664 --> 00:07:12.133 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's all gonna be all right
pal. I've got your back.

00:07:14.802 --> 00:07:17.605 position:16% line:83% align:start
There's nobody here who
isn't afraid of fighting.

00:07:20.007 --> 00:07:21.609 position:16% line:89% align:start
All that really counts...

00:07:21.642 --> 00:07:23.611 position:7% line:89% align:start
is the way you face that fear.

00:07:23.644 --> 00:07:26.747 position:21% line:89% align:start
(intense rock music)

00:07:30.084 --> 00:07:33.120 position:35% line:89% align:start

(breathing heavily)

00:07:44.598 --> 00:07:47.735 position:21% line:83% align:start
All right then! Bring
it on you assholes!

00:07:51.238 --> 00:07:53.507 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:07:54.508 --> 00:07:56.010 position:30% line:89% align:start
Ow! That hurt!

00:07:56.043 --> 00:07:57.477 position:19% line:89% align:start
But I need to do this!

00:07:57.511 --> 00:07:59.180 position:27% line:83% align:start
I have to fight
through the pain!

00:07:59.213 --> 00:08:00.648 position:38% line:89% align:start
(grunts)

00:08:00.681 --> 00:08:02.984 position:19% line:83% align:start
I need to change the
worst possible future!

00:08:26.407 --> 00:08:29.643 position:21% line:83% align:start
Are Valhalla a bunch
of losers or what?

00:08:31.178 --> 00:08:33.014 position:35% line:89% align:start

00:08:58.272 --> 00:09:00.374 position:10% line:89% align:start
Mitsuya! Are you doing okay?

00:09:00.408 --> 00:09:01.375 position:38% line:89% align:start
(grunts)

00:09:01.409 --> 00:09:02.476 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:09:02.511 --> 00:09:03.978 position:13% line:89% align:start
There are too many of them.

00:09:05.046 --> 00:09:06.414 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I know.

00:09:06.447 --> 00:09:07.648 position:24% line:83% align:start
Like it wasn't
already bad enough

00:09:07.681 --> 00:09:10.785 position:19% line:83% align:start
that we're outnumbered
by 300 to 150.

00:09:10.818 --> 00:09:13.454 position:16% line:83% align:start
But on top of that, their
guys are older than us,

00:09:13.487 --> 00:09:15.056 position:27% line:83% align:start
so they're bigger
and stronger too.

00:09:15.089 --> 00:09:16.957 position:19% line:83% align:start
So even if our captains
hold their ground,

00:09:16.991 --> 00:09:18.793 position:24% line:83% align:start
our other guys
are getting owned.

00:09:18.826 --> 00:09:20.294 position:38% line:89% align:start
(grunts)

00:09:20.327 --> 00:09:22.263 position:5% line:89% align:start
I give! I can't take it anymore!

00:09:22.296 --> 00:09:23.798 position:27% line:89% align:start
Shut up and die!

00:09:25.466 --> 00:09:27.735 position:38% line:89% align:start
(grunts)

00:09:28.537 --> 00:09:29.737 position:41% line:89% align:start
Draken!

00:09:31.172 --> 00:09:32.306 position:19% line:89% align:start
You better get a grip.

00:09:33.908 --> 00:09:36.343 position:13% line:83% align:start
You start panicking and you
won't even stand a chance.

00:09:38.913 --> 00:09:39.914 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yeah but...

00:09:39.947 --> 00:09:42.950 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's not like I don't
wanna fight Draken!

00:09:42.983 --> 00:09:43.984 position:44% line:89% align:start
I do!

00:09:44.018 --> 00:09:46.253 position:19% line:83% align:start
We just can't fight the
way you and Mikey do!

00:09:46.287 --> 00:09:47.688 position:38% line:89% align:start
We can't!

00:09:47.721 --> 00:09:48.889 position:19% line:89% align:start
We're not that strong!

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:53.094 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry! (whimpers)

00:09:53.127 --> 00:09:55.963 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm going to protect
you. Every one of you.

00:09:57.298 --> 00:09:59.568 position:10% line:89% align:start
So what's the holdup Draken?

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.802 position:16% line:83% align:start
You gonna come over
here and get me or what?

00:10:02.571 --> 00:10:04.772 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:10:07.641 --> 00:10:09.610 position:21% line:89% align:start
Our side's giving up.

00:10:09.643 --> 00:10:12.113 position:24% line:83% align:start
And our commander's
too far away.

00:10:12.146 --> 00:10:14.815 position:30% line:89% align:start
(faint chatter)

00:10:17.818 --> 00:10:22.456 position:13% line:89% align:start
(dramatic orchestral music)

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:25.092 position:27% line:83% align:start
So come and get
me you jackasses!

00:10:25.126 --> 00:10:28.095 position:35% line:89% align:start
(screaming)

00:10:28.129 --> 00:10:29.930 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:10:32.766 --> 00:10:35.336 position:16% line:83% align:start
You haven't seen the last
of me yet, you bastards!

00:10:36.203 --> 00:10:38.706 position:19% line:89% align:start
Wha- Is that Takemichi?

00:10:38.739 --> 00:10:43.878 position:35% line:83% align:start
-(groaning)
-(gasps)

00:10:43.911 --> 00:10:45.012 position:44% line:89% align:start
I...

00:10:45.045 --> 00:10:47.815 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm not going down that
easy, you Valhalla assholes!

00:10:47.848 --> 00:10:49.551 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm still standing, damn it!

00:10:49.584 --> 00:10:52.186 position:10% line:89% align:start
(dramatic instrumental music)

00:10:52.219 --> 00:10:53.654 position:33% line:89% align:start
I'm gonna...

00:10:53.687 --> 00:10:55.356 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm gonna end all of you!

00:10:59.426 --> 00:11:04.431 position:21% line:89% align:start
So just bring it on!

00:11:06.568 --> 00:11:08.603 position:33% line:89% align:start
(whimpering)

00:11:08.637 --> 00:11:10.271 position:21% line:89% align:start
(intense rock music)

00:11:10.304 --> 00:11:11.372 position:33% line:89% align:start
Not bad dude.

00:11:12.206 --> 00:11:14.275 position:30% line:89% align:start
Not bad at all.

00:11:14.308 --> 00:11:16.177 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Toman Member] The hell
were you whining for

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:17.612 position:24% line:89% align:start
just a minute ago?

00:11:17.646 --> 00:11:19.313 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Toman Member] You were
complaining too, jackass!

00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:20.714 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Toman Member] He's right.

00:11:20.748 --> 00:11:22.116 position:10% line:83% align:start
It doesn't matter if there's
more of them than us!

00:11:22.149 --> 00:11:24.285 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Toman Member] Yeah! Bring
it on, you Valhalla punks!

00:11:24.318 --> 00:11:25.486 position:30% line:89% align:start
You ain't shit!

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:26.655 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Toman Member] Come on you guys,

00:11:26.687 --> 00:11:28.355 position:24% line:83% align:start
let's show 'em what
Toman's made of!!

00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:30.691 position:38% line:89% align:start
(cheers)

00:11:32.393 --> 00:11:33.394 position:41% line:89% align:start
Draken.

00:11:34.261 --> 00:11:36.463 position:19% line:89% align:start
I think we're good now.

00:11:36.497 --> 00:11:39.967 position:16% line:89% align:start
(Toman members shouting)

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:46.541 position:13% line:83% align:start
Well! I guess I don't need
to protect them after all.

00:11:46.575 --> 00:11:49.443 position:24% line:89% align:start
(soft piano music)

00:11:51.613 --> 00:11:53.480 position:10% line:89% align:start
Our only option is to attack.

00:11:54.415 --> 00:11:55.416 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:11:57.418 --> 00:12:01.222 position:19% line:83% align:start
You just woke us all
the hell up, Takemichi.

00:12:01.255 --> 00:12:02.624 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:12:02.657 --> 00:12:04.925 position:19% line:83% align:start
Let's rip these clowns
a new one, boys!

00:12:04.959 --> 00:12:06.894 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Toman Member] We can't
make Draken worry about us,

00:12:06.927 --> 00:12:08.395 position:19% line:89% align:start
you jerks, am I right?

00:12:08.429 --> 00:12:10.231 position:38% line:89% align:start
(cheers)

00:12:10.264 --> 00:12:11.732 position:35% line:89% align:start
(giggling)

00:12:11.765 --> 00:12:14.034 position:35% line:89% align:start
(shouting)

00:12:17.404 --> 00:12:19.240 position:13% line:89% align:start
Just watch this Takemichi.

00:12:19.273 --> 00:12:20.741 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:12:20.774 --> 00:12:22.577 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Takashi] This'll work to
our advantage, big-time.

00:12:22.611 --> 00:12:23.811 position:44% line:89% align:start
Why?

00:12:24.713 --> 00:12:26.747 position:30% line:89% align:start
I don't get it.

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:29.750 position:19% line:83% align:start
What you did lit a fire
under all our guys!

00:12:30.384 --> 00:12:31.352 position:35% line:89% align:start
(shouting)

00:12:31.385 --> 00:12:34.088 position:16% line:83% align:start
So now Draken's not tied
down protecting them.

00:12:34.121 --> 00:12:36.390 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:12:40.327 --> 00:12:41.895 position:38% line:89% align:start
Die! Die!

00:12:42.997 --> 00:12:45.332 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Takashi] Draken can change
the odds on this fight

00:12:45.366 --> 00:12:46.767 position:30% line:89% align:start
all by himself!

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.703 position:19% line:89% align:start
My god! What the hell?

00:12:48.737 --> 00:12:51.038 position:24% line:83% align:start
He just took out 10
guys in an instant!

00:12:51.071 --> 00:12:53.140 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:12:54.975 --> 00:12:56.678 position:19% line:89% align:start
There's no effing way!

00:12:56.711 --> 00:12:57.778 position:30% line:89% align:start
He's a monster!

00:12:57.811 --> 00:13:00.047 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:13:01.215 --> 00:13:03.350 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Valhalla Member] And this
guy is Toman's Number Two?

00:13:03.384 --> 00:13:05.819 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Valhalla Member] Yeah!
That's Ken Ryuguji!

00:13:05.853 --> 00:13:08.789 position:10% line:89% align:start
(intense instrumental music)

00:13:08.822 --> 00:13:11.125 position:35% line:89% align:start
(groaning)

00:13:13.595 --> 00:13:17.064 position:10% line:89% align:start
Sorry you had to wait Hanma.

00:13:17.097 --> 00:13:19.833 position:21% line:83% align:start
You sure you're gonna
be able to take me on?

00:13:19.867 --> 00:13:21.569 position:19% line:83% align:start
You don't look like
you have anything left

00:13:21.603 --> 00:13:23.971 position:16% line:89% align:start
in the old gas tank man.

00:13:24.004 --> 00:13:27.441 position:7% line:83% align:start
No sweat, I was just finishing
my warmup routine here.

00:13:28.342 --> 00:13:30.110 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:13:30.144 --> 00:13:31.812 position:38% line:89% align:start
Wow, man!

00:13:32.614 --> 00:13:35.949 position:19% line:89% align:start
You asked for it Hanma!

00:13:35.983 --> 00:13:38.952 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah let's dance! Do it Draken!!

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:42.389 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] This is it!
Draken versus Hanma!

00:13:47.294 --> 00:13:48.262 position:21% line:89% align:start
(intense rock music)

00:13:48.295 --> 00:13:51.899 position:21% line:89% align:start
Let's do this Hanma!

00:13:52.567 --> 00:13:54.868 position:24% line:89% align:start
Let's dance Draken!

00:13:54.902 --> 00:13:56.236 position:35% line:89% align:start
(shouting)

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:58.172 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:13:58.205 --> 00:13:59.373 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:13:59.406 --> 00:14:00.374 position:33% line:83% align:start
-What the...
-Oh shit!

00:14:00.407 --> 00:14:02.843 position:19% line:89% align:start
What the... (whimpers)

00:14:02.876 --> 00:14:06.246 position:21% line:89% align:start
(overlapping chatter)

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.982 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm not finished
with you yet, Hanma.

00:14:09.016 --> 00:14:12.486 position:7% line:89% align:start
Well, I gotta admit that sucks.

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.855 position:21% line:83% align:start
I had my guard up and
you still got through.

00:14:14.888 --> 00:14:16.190 position:19% line:89% align:start
What the hell was that?

00:14:16.223 --> 00:14:18.459 position:24% line:83% align:start
You see how far he
sent Hanma flying?

00:14:18.492 --> 00:14:21.563 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] I knew he was
strong, but holy shit!

00:14:21.596 --> 00:14:23.531 position:16% line:89% align:start
Draken is off the charts!

00:14:23.565 --> 00:14:26.033 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:31.004 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hey! Kazutora!

00:14:32.339 --> 00:14:34.576 position:19% line:83% align:start
Are you just gonna keep
running away from me?

00:14:36.711 --> 00:14:39.380 position:35% line:89% align:start
(chuckles)

00:14:39.413 --> 00:14:41.448 position:38% line:89% align:start
(shouts)

00:14:41.482 --> 00:14:44.952 position:13% line:89% align:start
(dramatic orchestral music)

00:14:50.625 --> 00:14:52.259 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hey, what's wrong Mikey?

00:14:52.292 --> 00:14:54.729 position:21% line:83% align:start
Whatcha doin' on
your knees like that?

00:14:54.763 --> 00:14:57.965 position:10% line:83% align:start
How the hell did he manage to
block that surprise attack?

00:14:57.998 --> 00:15:00.100 position:10% line:89% align:start
That was just luck I'm sure.

00:15:00.134 --> 00:15:02.970 position:7% line:83% align:start
Usually the rumors about a guy
being strong are just that.

00:15:04.104 --> 00:15:05.973 position:10% line:89% align:start
Kazutora are you kidding me?

00:15:06.006 --> 00:15:07.908 position:5% line:89% align:start
You can't even fight one-on-one?

00:15:07.941 --> 00:15:09.343 position:35% line:89% align:start
One-on-one?

00:15:09.376 --> 00:15:11.412 position:19% line:83% align:start
What the hell? I never
promised you that.

00:15:13.046 --> 00:15:14.749 position:24% line:83% align:start
These two guys are
expert fighters

00:15:14.783 --> 00:15:17.017 position:24% line:83% align:start
I recruited for my
own personal use.

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:19.453 position:19% line:83% align:start
They were the toughest
guys I met in juvie.

00:15:19.486 --> 00:15:22.389 position:21% line:5% align:start
(intense rock music)

00:15:28.429 --> 00:15:29.764 position:30% line:89% align:start
Well all right!

00:15:29.798 --> 00:15:31.398 position:24% line:89% align:start
Let's do it Mikey!

00:15:31.432 --> 00:15:32.867 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:15:32.901 --> 00:15:34.769 position:19% line:89% align:start
Get outta there Chonbo!

00:15:34.803 --> 00:15:36.203 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(shouts)
-(metal crunching)

00:15:36.236 --> 00:15:38.172 position:13% line:89% align:start
Whoa, that was a close one!

00:15:38.205 --> 00:15:40.675 position:27% line:83% align:start
You! You scuttle
like a cockroach.

00:15:40.708 --> 00:15:43.110 position:21% line:89% align:start
Your turn now Chome.

00:15:43.143 --> 00:15:46.346 position:10% line:83% align:start
Well what do you know, guess
he's the real deal after all.

00:15:47.347 --> 00:15:49.216 position:27% line:89% align:start
(gangs shouting)

00:15:49.249 --> 00:15:51.318 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:15:53.888 --> 00:15:54.856 position:38% line:89% align:start
(cackles)

00:15:54.889 --> 00:15:55.857 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:57.991 position:38% line:89% align:start
(grunts)

00:16:00.562 --> 00:16:01.962 position:35% line:89% align:start
(cackling)

00:16:01.995 --> 00:16:04.231 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:16:11.773 --> 00:16:14.007 position:35% line:89% align:start
(cackling)

00:16:17.779 --> 00:16:19.647 position:24% line:83% align:start
You wanna know why
I lured you here

00:16:19.681 --> 00:16:21.516 position:13% line:89% align:start
onto this pile of old cars?

00:16:21.549 --> 00:16:22.449 position:30% line:89% align:start
Can you guess?

00:16:24.985 --> 00:16:28.021 position:21% line:89% align:start
(intense rock music)

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:31.992 position:16% line:83% align:start
Because here the
footing's real unstable.

00:16:32.025 --> 00:16:34.161 position:7% line:89% align:start
The junk moves under your feet.

00:16:34.194 --> 00:16:36.096 position:10% line:89% align:start
So you won't be able to land

00:16:36.129 --> 00:16:38.265 position:19% line:83% align:start
those famous nuclear
missile kicks of yours.

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:41.903 position:38% line:89% align:start
(grunts)

00:16:41.936 --> 00:16:44.371 position:24% line:83% align:start
Ha! Time to get
this party started!

00:16:44.404 --> 00:16:46.608 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:04.526 position:10% line:89% align:start
How is he beating both of us?

00:17:04.559 --> 00:17:07.494 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yeah the kid's an
awesome fighter isn't he?

00:17:07.529 --> 00:17:09.029 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:17:09.062 --> 00:17:11.498 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:17:11.533 --> 00:17:13.500 position:33% line:89% align:start
You're mine!

00:17:13.535 --> 00:17:16.236 position:24% line:89% align:start
(metal pipe slams)

00:17:22.577 --> 00:17:23.343 position:33% line:89% align:start
(body thuds)

00:17:23.377 --> 00:17:24.378 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:27.347 position:47% line:89% align:start
No!

00:17:27.381 --> 00:17:28.348 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:17:28.382 --> 00:17:31.084 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mikey!

00:17:36.423 --> 00:17:38.626 position:38% line:89% align:start
(scoffs)

00:17:40.962 --> 00:17:42.162 position:41% line:89% align:start
No way!

00:17:43.096 --> 00:17:44.097 position:33% line:89% align:start
Mikey get up!

00:17:45.332 --> 00:17:47.200 position:16% line:89% align:start
Looks like Valhalla wins.

00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:52.439 position:35% line:89% align:start
(groaning)

00:18:00.147 --> 00:18:01.448 position:21% line:89% align:start
Is Mikey still going?

00:18:05.019 --> 00:18:07.555 position:7% line:89% align:start
Just answer me one question...

00:18:07.589 --> 00:18:08.388 position:38% line:89% align:start
Kazutora.

00:18:09.456 --> 00:18:10.257 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:18:11.291 --> 00:18:12.727 position:16% line:89% align:start
Do you really believe it?

00:18:14.963 --> 00:18:16.764 position:24% line:83% align:start
Do you really think
that I'm your enemy?

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:21.769 position:27% line:89% align:start
(delicate music)

00:18:21.803 --> 00:18:23.938 position:10% line:89% align:start
You'll always belong to me...

00:18:23.972 --> 00:18:25.172 position:38% line:89% align:start
Kazutora.

00:18:27.474 --> 00:18:30.277 position:27% line:83% align:start
Which means that
all of your pain

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:31.779 position:10% line:89% align:start
and all of your suffering...

00:18:32.814 --> 00:18:33.815 position:33% line:89% align:start
All of it...

00:18:34.782 --> 00:18:35.783 position:30% line:89% align:start
belongs to me.

00:18:36.651 --> 00:18:39.319 position:30% line:89% align:start
(voice shaking)

00:18:42.456 --> 00:18:44.759 position:27% line:83% align:start
Betrayal is part
of human nature.

00:18:46.493 --> 00:18:48.495 position:21% line:83% align:start
I don't remember much
from my childhood.

00:18:49.463 --> 00:18:51.431 position:10% line:89% align:start
What I do remember seeing...

00:18:51.465 --> 00:18:53.568 position:10% line:89% align:start
is a fist raised in the air,

00:18:53.601 --> 00:18:56.436 position:19% line:83% align:start
and my mother's face as
she trembled in fear.

00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:57.805 position:33% line:89% align:start
(whimpering)

00:18:57.839 --> 00:19:01.609 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Mother] Kazutora, are you
taking your father's side?

00:19:02.977 --> 00:19:05.613 position:30% line:89% align:start
(heart pounds)

00:19:07.749 --> 00:19:08.750 position:44% line:89% align:start
Or...

00:19:08.783 --> 00:19:10.585 position:24% line:89% align:start
are you on my side?

00:19:10.618 --> 00:19:11.385 position:30% line:89% align:start
(voice shaking)

00:19:11.418 --> 00:19:13.021 position:19% line:89% align:start
You can't choose both.

00:19:13.054 --> 00:19:15.623 position:10% line:89% align:start
You have to choose just one.

00:19:15.657 --> 00:19:18.593 position:27% line:89% align:start
(delicate music)

00:19:18.626 --> 00:19:19.627 position:35% line:89% align:start
I suffered.

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:23.798 position:33% line:89% align:start
I suffered...

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:28.703 position:19% line:83% align:start
because of you and the
things that you did.

00:19:28.736 --> 00:19:30.772 position:30% line:89% align:start
(heart pounds)

00:19:30.805 --> 00:19:34.042 position:21% line:83% align:start
I spent two years in
juvie because of you.

00:19:34.075 --> 00:19:35.275 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:19:35.308 --> 00:19:37.344 position:21% line:83% align:start
What the hell are you
even talking about?

00:19:38.746 --> 00:19:40.213 position:13% line:89% align:start
Of course you're my enemy!

00:19:44.886 --> 00:19:46.286 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm going to eliminate

00:19:46.319 --> 00:19:48.690 position:27% line:83% align:start
everything that
stands in my way.

00:19:48.723 --> 00:19:50.257 position:19% line:89% align:start
Did you know, Mikey...

00:19:51.993 --> 00:19:54.962 position:13% line:83% align:start
that if a person kills
someone, they're a bad guy.

00:19:54.996 --> 00:19:56.731 position:7% line:89% align:start
But, if you kill your enemy...

00:19:58.066 --> 00:19:59.266 position:30% line:89% align:start
you're a hero.

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:06.040 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] What the hell
is this dude talking about?

00:20:06.074 --> 00:20:07.374 position:24% line:89% align:start
He's lost his mind.

00:20:08.576 --> 00:20:09.744 position:38% line:89% align:start
(titters)

00:20:09.777 --> 00:20:10.912 position:24% line:89% align:start
Bat-shit cray-cray!

00:20:12.613 --> 00:20:14.682 position:35% line:89% align:start
(groaning)

00:20:18.385 --> 00:20:20.555 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hold him tight. Don't
let him get loose.

00:20:23.758 --> 00:20:26.160 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grumbles)

00:20:26.194 --> 00:20:28.563 position:21% line:83% align:start
-(grunts)
-(metal pipe smacks)

00:20:28.596 --> 00:20:30.865 position:33% line:89% align:start
(whimpering)

00:20:30.898 --> 00:20:32.567 position:16% line:89% align:start
Guess it's all over now.

00:20:36.369 --> 00:20:38.271 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(grunts)
-(metal pipe slams)

00:20:38.305 --> 00:20:40.240 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grumbling)

00:20:40.273 --> 00:20:43.310 position:21% line:89% align:start
(metal pipe slamming)

00:20:43.343 --> 00:20:45.613 position:13% line:89% align:start
This time Mikey's finished.

00:20:45.646 --> 00:20:46.914 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:20:46.948 --> 00:20:48.649 position:21% line:89% align:start
But that's not fair!

00:20:48.683 --> 00:20:50.417 position:27% line:83% align:start
He's got his arms
and legs pinned!

00:20:51.953 --> 00:20:53.386 position:16% line:89% align:start
This isn't a fair fight!

00:20:54.354 --> 00:20:56.124 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hang on Mikey!

00:20:56.157 --> 00:20:58.291 position:38% line:89% align:start
(grunts)

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:02.295 position:10% line:83% align:start
Oh no you don't! You're still
playing with me remember?

00:21:05.032 --> 00:21:06.266 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:21:06.299 --> 00:21:08.636 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm going to go down
in history as a hero!

00:21:10.138 --> 00:21:11.438 position:21% line:89% align:start
By killing my enemy.

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.241 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(grunts)
-(metal pipe slams)

00:21:13.273 --> 00:21:16.978 position:10% line:89% align:start
(emotional orchestral music)

00:21:21.816 --> 00:21:22.950 position:30% line:89% align:start
Get up, Mikey!

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:28.222 position:7% line:89% align:start
So you want to kill your enemy.

00:21:28.256 --> 00:21:30.457 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:21:32.994 --> 00:21:34.962 position:21% line:89% align:start
Is that the reason...

00:21:34.996 --> 00:21:36.230 position:10% line:89% align:start
(intense instrumental music)

00:21:36.264 --> 00:21:38.431 position:19% line:89% align:start
you killed my brother?

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.636 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:21:41.669 --> 00:21:43.671 position:38% line:89% align:start
(grunts)

00:21:45.907 --> 00:21:46.974 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hey what the hell?

00:21:47.008 --> 00:21:48.042 position:24% line:89% align:start
He's lifting me up!

00:21:48.075 --> 00:21:49.744 position:38% line:89% align:start
(shouts)

00:21:49.777 --> 00:21:50.978 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:21:51.012 --> 00:21:53.848 position:27% line:89% align:start
(ground rumbling)

00:21:56.951 --> 00:22:00.420 position:13% line:89% align:start
(dramatic orchestral music)

00:22:10.698 --> 00:22:12.800 position:38% line:89% align:start
(growls)

00:22:18.072 --> 00:22:21.642 position:21% line:89% align:start
(closing theme music)

00:22:24.879 --> 00:22:28.516 position:21% line:89% align:start
(singing in Japanese)
