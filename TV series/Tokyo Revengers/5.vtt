00:00:08.743 --> 00:00:13.213 position:21% line:89% align:start
(opening theme music)

00:01:38.866 --> 00:01:41.603 position:27% line:5% align:start
Well, look who's
here. Takemichi.

00:01:41.636 --> 00:01:44.438 position:30% line:5% align:start
You are fired.

00:01:44.471 --> 00:01:45.773 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:01:45.807 --> 00:01:47.374 position:21% line:89% align:start
Don't act surprised.

00:01:47.407 --> 00:01:50.110 position:7% line:83% align:start
You totally up and disappeared
for two straight weeks.

00:01:50.143 --> 00:01:52.279 position:16% line:83% align:start
And I'll give you just
one guess who management

00:01:52.312 --> 00:01:54.782 position:7% line:89% align:start
decided to blame for all that.

00:01:54.816 --> 00:01:55.984 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Wow, I'm so sorry-

00:01:56.017 --> 00:01:58.653 position:41% line:89% align:start
Fired.

00:01:58.686 --> 00:02:00.153 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right.

00:02:00.187 --> 00:02:02.356 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's been two weeks since
I went back in time,

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:04.792 position:19% line:83% align:start
and if time passes
while I'm in the past,

00:02:04.826 --> 00:02:07.260 position:5% line:89% align:start
time passes in the present, too.

00:02:07.294 --> 00:02:09.262 position:10% line:89% align:start
Okay, what about my paycheck-

00:02:09.296 --> 00:02:11.766 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Manager] Look for
a direct deposit.

00:02:15.637 --> 00:02:17.071 position:35% line:89% align:start
Say, Naoto,

00:02:17.105 --> 00:02:19.841 position:19% line:83% align:start
I was thinking what if
I tell the past Hina

00:02:19.874 --> 00:02:21.141 position:13% line:89% align:start
what happens in her future?

00:02:21.174 --> 00:02:22.977 position:24% line:83% align:start
You know, like the
way I did with you-

00:02:23.011 --> 00:02:24.478 position:30% line:89% align:start
Absolutely not.

00:02:24.512 --> 00:02:27.682 position:13% line:83% align:start
Takemichi, are you looking
for an easy way out?

00:02:27.715 --> 00:02:29.149 position:19% line:89% align:start
No, no, it's not that!

00:02:29.182 --> 00:02:31.119 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm not trying to
take the easy way out

00:02:31.184 --> 00:02:33.320 position:19% line:83% align:start
because life is hard
right now or anything.

00:02:33.353 --> 00:02:35.489 position:21% line:83% align:start
Plus, if you told my
sister any of this,

00:02:35.523 --> 00:02:38.358 position:10% line:83% align:start
she'd probably think you were
nuts and stop liking you.

00:02:39.727 --> 00:02:42.195 position:5% line:83% align:start
No rational person would believe
what's going on here now.

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:43.230 position:27% line:89% align:start
How dumb are you?

00:02:44.464 --> 00:02:47.001 position:7% line:83% align:start
The only reason I believed you
was because I happened to be

00:02:47.035 --> 00:02:49.369 position:24% line:83% align:start
really into occult
stuff back then.

00:02:49.403 --> 00:02:52.272 position:10% line:83% align:start
Yeah, you were. Plus, you
were still pretty young then.

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:54.842 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wait, did you just call me dumb?

00:02:54.876 --> 00:02:57.045 position:16% line:89% align:start
Since Sendo is dead now,

00:02:57.078 --> 00:02:59.246 position:27% line:83% align:start
we can't use him
to get to Mikey.

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:02.249 position:16% line:83% align:start
So to save Hinata, we
have to go into the past

00:03:02.282 --> 00:03:04.418 position:13% line:89% align:start
and change Toman ourselves.

00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:06.353 position:27% line:83% align:start
So we're back to
square one again.

00:03:07.822 --> 00:03:12.160 position:19% line:83% align:start
(sighs) If only Draken
were still alive, huh?

00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:14.028 position:24% line:83% align:start
Are you talking
about Ken Ryuguji?

00:03:14.062 --> 00:03:15.262 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mm-hmm.

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.464 position:21% line:89% align:start
Did you research him?

00:03:17.497 --> 00:03:18.498 position:41% line:89% align:start
I did.

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:21.736 position:19% line:89% align:start
This is the news story.

00:03:23.538 --> 00:03:26.974 position:10% line:83% align:start
On August 3rd, 2005, in the
parking lot of Musashi Shrine

00:03:27.008 --> 00:03:28.843 position:10% line:89% align:start
in the Shibuya Ward of Tokyo,

00:03:28.876 --> 00:03:32.245 position:13% line:83% align:start
50 members of a biker gang
were involved in a brawl.

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:34.481 position:16% line:83% align:start
A young man in his third
year of middle school

00:03:34.515 --> 00:03:36.383 position:19% line:83% align:start
was beaten and stabbed
in the abdomen.

00:03:36.818 --> 00:03:37.819 position:30% line:89% align:start
He later died.

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:43.124 position:10% line:83% align:start
Some of these posts here
mention an internal struggle,

00:03:43.157 --> 00:03:44.525 position:19% line:89% align:start
and according to them,

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:46.894 position:10% line:83% align:start
there was a bitter strife
between the the Mikey faction

00:03:46.928 --> 00:03:51.065 position:10% line:83% align:start
and the Draken side,
resulting in Ryuguji's death.

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:53.167 position:16% line:89% align:start
Huh? Hey, hang on a sec!

00:03:53.201 --> 00:03:56.403 position:24% line:83% align:start
August 3rd is only
two weeks away!

00:03:56.436 --> 00:03:58.940 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Naoto] Correct,
but 12 years ago.

00:03:58.973 --> 00:04:01.109 position:27% line:83% align:start
A fight between
Mikey and Draken?

00:04:01.142 --> 00:04:02.844 position:21% line:83% align:start
There's gotta be
some kind of mistake!

00:04:04.212 --> 00:04:06.446 position:19% line:83% align:start
Draken understands
Mikey like nobody else.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.882 position:19% line:89% align:start
They're like brothers!

00:04:07.915 --> 00:04:10.918 position:13% line:83% align:start
There's no way! The idea
of them fighting is loony!

00:04:10.952 --> 00:04:12.419 position:5% line:89% align:start
So you think there's more to it?

00:04:12.452 --> 00:04:14.756 position:24% line:89% align:start
Well, I don't know.

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:17.925 position:19% line:83% align:start
I just know Mikey could
never be Draken's enemy!

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.394 position:10% line:83% align:start
Well, it is an absolute fact
that Ryuguji died that day.

00:04:22.997 --> 00:04:24.297 position:10% line:89% align:start
Let's look into it some more.

00:04:25.465 --> 00:04:29.537 position:21% line:83% align:start
Today is July 19th,
so we have two weeks.

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.706 position:5% line:89% align:start
We need to find out how he died,

00:04:31.739 --> 00:04:35.042 position:24% line:83% align:start
then on August 3rd,
you'll save Ryuguji.

00:04:35.076 --> 00:04:37.477 position:7% line:89% align:start
That's your mission this time.

00:04:37.512 --> 00:04:41.281 position:7% line:83% align:start
Manjiro Sano apparently
changed after Ryuguji's death.

00:04:41.314 --> 00:04:43.217 position:27% line:83% align:start
Your friend Sendo
committed suicide

00:04:43.251 --> 00:04:45.686 position:21% line:83% align:start
because he was afraid
of Tetta Kisaki.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.022 position:16% line:83% align:start
And because Toman
became vicious and evil,

00:04:48.055 --> 00:04:49.857 position:10% line:89% align:start
they killed my sister Hinata.

00:04:52.425 --> 00:04:56.063 position:13% line:83% align:start
If you're successful, then
we can save all of them.

00:04:56.097 --> 00:05:00.300 position:7% line:89% align:start
Save Draken and Akkun and Hina?

00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:01.803 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's right.

00:05:01.836 --> 00:05:03.704 position:21% line:83% align:start
We've got the perfect
solution then.

00:05:05.907 --> 00:05:08.375 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm going to save
Draken, no matter what!

00:05:09.177 --> 00:05:10.377 position:30% line:89% align:start
You can do it.

00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:23.825 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] (groans)
Where, where am I?

00:05:23.858 --> 00:05:26.393 position:16% line:83% align:start
There's something on top
of me, but, what the?

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.035 position:24% line:89% align:start
No kissing allowed.

00:05:35.203 --> 00:05:36.604 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:05:36.637 --> 00:05:40.041 position:7% line:89% align:start
What the hell is going on here?

00:05:40.074 --> 00:05:41.042 position:19% line:89% align:start
If there's no kissing,

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:45.412 position:21% line:83% align:start
exactly what else
is on the menu then?

00:05:45.445 --> 00:05:47.748 position:30% line:89% align:start
(phone ringing)

00:05:47.782 --> 00:05:48.583 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Oh?
-Huh?

00:05:54.121 --> 00:05:57.357 position:10% line:89% align:start
Yeah, but add 30 minutes on.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:58.759 position:19% line:89% align:start
Want anything to drink?

00:06:00.061 --> 00:06:01.062 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hello?

00:06:02.063 --> 00:06:03.064 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:06:04.332 --> 00:06:06.901 position:19% line:83% align:start
What the hell was that?
What's going on here?

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.172 position:21% line:89% align:start
My past life changed!

00:06:11.205 --> 00:06:12.874 position:7% line:89% align:start
A forever-alone virgin like me

00:06:12.907 --> 00:06:15.009 position:21% line:83% align:start
somehow ended up with
that total hottie?

00:06:16.577 --> 00:06:18.713 position:13% line:83% align:start
I have to make sure Hina
never finds out about that.

00:06:18.746 --> 00:06:19.714 position:35% line:89% align:start
About what?

00:06:19.747 --> 00:06:20.548 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:25.353 position:16% line:83% align:start
Hinata! What in the
world are you doing here?

00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:27.387 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Hinata] I'm on my way
home from cram school,

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.190 position:19% line:83% align:start
but what are you
doing here, Takemichi?

00:06:29.223 --> 00:06:31.424 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh, uh, I was just uh...

00:06:32.793 --> 00:06:33.861 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Hinata] Hmm?

00:06:35.462 --> 00:06:39.834 position:13% line:83% align:start
Uh, what's wrong? Is there
something on my face?

00:06:39.867 --> 00:06:40.968 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Hinata] Hmm.

00:06:41.002 --> 00:06:43.470 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh no! Don't tell me.

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:46.774 position:19% line:89% align:start
Does she already know?

00:06:46.807 --> 00:06:50.477 position:7% line:83% align:start
Uh, I don't, uh, I don't
really remember what happened!

00:06:50.511 --> 00:06:51.746 position:13% line:89% align:start
What are you talking about?

00:06:51.779 --> 00:06:54.447 position:35% line:89% align:start
Huh? Uh...

00:06:54.481 --> 00:06:56.984 position:19% line:83% align:start
What's up with you?
You're so weird lately.

00:06:57.018 --> 00:06:58.252 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Huh?

00:06:58.286 --> 00:06:59.854 position:27% line:83% align:start
Today, you're the
adult Takemichi.

00:07:01.355 --> 00:07:03.024 position:21% line:83% align:start
But the night we
watched the fireworks

00:07:03.057 --> 00:07:04.491 position:16% line:89% align:start
together up on the roof,

00:07:04.525 --> 00:07:06.928 position:13% line:83% align:start
you left and just rushed
home without saying a word,

00:07:06.961 --> 00:07:08.896 position:21% line:83% align:start
and you've been cold
to me at school.

00:07:10.264 --> 00:07:11.966 position:21% line:83% align:start
But now tonight,
you seem nice again.

00:07:13.067 --> 00:07:14.368 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] That's right.

00:07:14.402 --> 00:07:15.870 position:24% line:83% align:start
Whenever I go back
to the present,

00:07:15.903 --> 00:07:18.272 position:24% line:83% align:start
the me that's here
is the past me

00:07:18.306 --> 00:07:19.941 position:5% line:89% align:start
who has no idea what's going on.

00:07:24.278 --> 00:07:26.247 position:24% line:89% align:start
No kissing allowed.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:29.116 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] How the hell did I
end up with that hottie, though?

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:31.385 position:10% line:83% align:start
-You're such a fool, past me!
-(cell phone vibrating)

00:07:31.419 --> 00:07:33.821 position:21% line:83% align:start
Takemichi, isn't that
your phone ringing?

00:07:33.854 --> 00:07:35.656 position:38% line:89% align:start
Huh? Oh.

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:39.160 position:24% line:89% align:start
Whoa, it's Draken.

00:07:40.194 --> 00:07:41.662 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hello?

00:07:41.696 --> 00:07:44.198 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Draken] Takemitchy, what
are you doing right now?

00:07:44.231 --> 00:07:45.700 position:5% line:89% align:start
Me? Well, I was just talking to-

00:07:45.733 --> 00:07:48.002 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Draken] Get on over
to Musashi Shrine.

00:07:48.035 --> 00:07:49.403 position:16% line:89% align:start
We're all meeting there.

00:07:49.437 --> 00:07:51.372 position:24% line:83% align:start
Huh? Um, now's not
really the best-

00:07:51.405 --> 00:07:53.841 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(line disconnects)
-Hmm?

00:07:53.874 --> 00:07:57.812 position:10% line:83% align:start
Hina, I'm sorry, but for some
reason Draken wants to see me.

00:07:57.845 --> 00:07:59.880 position:10% line:89% align:start
Fine, then I'll go with you.

00:07:59.914 --> 00:08:01.549 position:35% line:89% align:start
Seriously?

00:08:01.582 --> 00:08:03.584 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, Draken's a friend
of yours, isn't he?

00:08:04.885 --> 00:08:07.487 position:30% line:89% align:start
(gentle music)

00:08:10.157 --> 00:08:11.491 position:24% line:89% align:start
Tell me, Takemichi.

00:08:11.525 --> 00:08:13.194 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Hm?

00:08:13.227 --> 00:08:14.662 position:13% line:89% align:start
What things matter to you?

00:08:14.695 --> 00:08:16.764 position:21% line:83% align:start
What do you consider
to be important?

00:08:16.797 --> 00:08:18.799 position:10% line:89% align:start
Huh? Not sure what you mean.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:20.701 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:08:22.136 --> 00:08:24.438 position:19% line:83% align:start
What's important to me
are times like this.

00:08:24.472 --> 00:08:26.841 position:10% line:89% align:start
We don't need to do anything.

00:08:26.874 --> 00:08:29.310 position:19% line:83% align:start
Just the two of us
walking along together

00:08:29.343 --> 00:08:31.278 position:21% line:83% align:start
talking about nothing
in particular.

00:08:31.312 --> 00:08:34.215 position:7% line:83% align:start
I like just being able to
relax and spend time with you.

00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:38.686 position:21% line:83% align:start
I hope we spend a lot
more time like this.

00:08:39.887 --> 00:08:43.024 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] Time. That's
right, there's my answer!

00:08:43.057 --> 00:08:45.826 position:24% line:83% align:start
What's important to
me is saving Hina!

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:48.696 position:7% line:83% align:start
To prevent her from getting
killed by Toman in the future!

00:08:51.832 --> 00:08:54.035 position:21% line:83% align:start
This is where you're
gonna meet him?

00:08:54.068 --> 00:08:55.136 position:33% line:89% align:start
Mm-hmm, yeah.

00:08:55.169 --> 00:08:56.704 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:08:56.737 --> 00:09:00.708 position:10% line:89% align:start
(motorcycle engine whirring)

00:09:05.246 --> 00:09:06.881 position:16% line:89% align:start
Are you sure about this?

00:09:06.914 --> 00:09:07.815 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, yeah!

00:09:12.853 --> 00:09:14.488 position:10% line:89% align:start
They look pretty scary to me.

00:09:14.523 --> 00:09:16.657 position:7% line:89% align:start
Yeah, but no need to be afraid.

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:18.159 position:27% line:89% align:start
Just don't stare.

00:09:18.192 --> 00:09:19.360 position:13% line:89% align:start
They won't dare bother you

00:09:19.393 --> 00:09:21.095 position:24% line:83% align:start
if they know you're
here with me.

00:09:21.128 --> 00:09:23.532 position:21% line:83% align:start
Who wears biker gang
outfits anymore, huh?

00:09:23.564 --> 00:09:25.266 position:27% line:83% align:start
And look how many
of them there are!

00:09:25.299 --> 00:09:26.300 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hey, you!

00:09:27.201 --> 00:09:28.537 position:24% line:89% align:start
Quit your staring!

00:09:28.569 --> 00:09:30.838 position:21% line:83% align:start
What's your problem?
You wanna die?

00:09:30.871 --> 00:09:32.373 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:09:32.406 --> 00:09:34.308 position:21% line:83% align:start
Get outta here
while you still can!

00:09:34.341 --> 00:09:35.776 position:16% line:89% align:start
While you can still walk!

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:37.678 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to stare!

00:09:37.711 --> 00:09:38.879 position:19% line:89% align:start
But I was invited here!

00:09:38.913 --> 00:09:42.216 position:16% line:83% align:start
Ah, bullshit! Do you
even know where you are?

00:09:42.249 --> 00:09:44.018 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] The Musashi Shrine!

00:09:44.051 --> 00:09:46.020 position:16% line:83% align:start
Who the hell would invite
a piss ant like you

00:09:46.053 --> 00:09:47.755 position:24% line:83% align:start
to a Toman meeting,
you little bastard?

00:09:47.788 --> 00:09:49.256 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Hinata] Violence is wrong!

00:09:53.294 --> 00:09:56.063 position:7% line:89% align:start
Wait a sec, are you Takemitchy?

00:09:56.097 --> 00:09:57.231 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yeah, hi there.

00:09:58.833 --> 00:10:01.001 position:13% line:83% align:start
What are you doing scaring
the commander's guest?

00:10:01.035 --> 00:10:02.937 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Toman Member] I'm sorry
sir! I didn't know!

00:10:05.439 --> 00:10:06.941 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Hinata] Are you
okay, Takemichi?

00:10:06.974 --> 00:10:08.375 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:10:08.409 --> 00:10:09.544 position:33% line:89% align:start
Come with me.

00:10:09.578 --> 00:10:11.912 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Huh? Oh, yeah, sure.

00:10:16.183 --> 00:10:17.751 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hey, Takemitchy.

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.756 position:7% line:89% align:start
Sorry, for the surprise invite.

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:25.560 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Draken] Why'd you decide
to bring your wifey along?

00:10:25.594 --> 00:10:27.261 position:27% line:89% align:start
Sorry about that.

00:10:27.294 --> 00:10:30.131 position:16% line:83% align:start
I just had no idea it was
going to be like this.

00:10:30.164 --> 00:10:31.866 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hello again, Hinata.

00:10:31.899 --> 00:10:33.767 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry for scaring
you the other day.

00:10:33.801 --> 00:10:36.637 position:21% line:83% align:start
Oh, it's fine. That's
all forgotten now.

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:39.240 position:21% line:83% align:start
Besides, I'm sorry
for my behavior, too.

00:10:41.041 --> 00:10:42.243 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hey, Emma!

00:10:42.276 --> 00:10:43.410 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Emma] Yeah, what?

00:10:43.444 --> 00:10:44.579 position:13% line:89% align:start
This is Takemitchy's wifey

00:10:44.613 --> 00:10:46.780 position:21% line:83% align:start
so make sure you take
good care of her.

00:10:49.518 --> 00:10:50.718 position:38% line:89% align:start
Will do.

00:10:54.589 --> 00:10:56.790 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey! What do you say, wussy boy?

00:10:57.925 --> 00:11:00.828 position:19% line:83% align:start
Why would that girl be
calling you wussy boy?

00:11:00.861 --> 00:11:03.364 position:21% line:83% align:start
Good question. Do you
already know Emma?

00:11:03.397 --> 00:11:05.534 position:27% line:83% align:start
Uh, it's not what
you think, Hina!

00:11:05.567 --> 00:11:06.734 position:10% line:89% align:start
You gotta believe me, Draken.

00:11:06.767 --> 00:11:08.702 position:21% line:83% align:start
I don't remember a
thing that happened!

00:11:08.736 --> 00:11:10.671 position:19% line:83% align:start
You mean like getting
me down to my underwear

00:11:10.704 --> 00:11:12.173 position:24% line:89% align:start
then running away?

00:11:12.206 --> 00:11:16.010 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh, really? Is
that what happened?

00:11:16.043 --> 00:11:18.846 position:21% line:83% align:start
You know, I'm really
not sure! Funny, huh?

00:11:18.879 --> 00:11:21.616 position:10% line:83% align:start
I just don't seem to remember
a thing about it all!

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:23.618 position:19% line:89% align:start
No wait! I can explain!

00:11:23.652 --> 00:11:27.788 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(punches thudding)
-(Takemichi yelping)

00:11:27.821 --> 00:11:29.356 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm so sorry, Hina.

00:11:30.224 --> 00:11:32.159 position:38% line:89% align:start
Jerkface!

00:11:32.193 --> 00:11:33.494 position:30% line:89% align:start
She is pissed.

00:11:33.528 --> 00:11:34.762 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm surprised you went after me

00:11:34.795 --> 00:11:36.665 position:16% line:83% align:start
when you've got a
girlfriend like that one.

00:11:36.697 --> 00:11:38.933 position:24% line:83% align:start
Don't you get the
wrong idea, though.

00:11:38.966 --> 00:11:41.068 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's not like I like
you or anything.

00:11:41.101 --> 00:11:42.269 position:27% line:89% align:start
I just used you.

00:11:42.303 --> 00:11:43.270 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Huh?

00:11:43.304 --> 00:11:45.372 position:16% line:83% align:start
I thought if I let him
see me with someone else,

00:11:45.406 --> 00:11:46.840 position:21% line:89% align:start
he might get jealous.

00:11:47.908 --> 00:11:51.111 position:19% line:83% align:start
But I guess it didn't
have any effect at all.

00:11:51.145 --> 00:11:54.281 position:10% line:83% align:start
All he cares about is riding
and fighting and Mikey.

00:11:54.315 --> 00:11:55.282 position:16% line:89% align:start
I thought messing around

00:11:55.316 --> 00:11:57.251 position:24% line:83% align:start
would at least make
him a little mad.

00:11:58.319 --> 00:11:59.954 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Now I get it.

00:11:59.987 --> 00:12:02.923 position:5% line:83% align:start
She was just using me to get
Draken to pay attention to her.

00:12:02.957 --> 00:12:06.760 position:16% line:83% align:start
Man, I really don't
understand girls at all.

00:12:06.794 --> 00:12:08.495 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Draken] Takemitchy.

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:09.730 position:38% line:89% align:start
You done?

00:12:09.763 --> 00:12:12.333 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] Yes, sorry
to keep you waiting!

00:12:12.366 --> 00:12:14.502 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Draken] All right,
gather around, everyone!

00:12:14.536 --> 00:12:15.936 position:10% line:89% align:start
The meeting's about to start!

00:12:17.104 --> 00:12:20.374 position:16% line:83% align:start
[All] Good evening,
Commander. Welcome, sir!

00:12:20.407 --> 00:12:23.744 position:19% line:89% align:start
(soft mysterious music)

00:12:50.538 --> 00:12:53.774 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] Whoa, the whole
mood here changed completely

00:12:53.807 --> 00:12:55.943 position:27% line:83% align:start
when Mikey stood
in front of them.

00:12:55.976 --> 00:13:00.715 position:16% line:83% align:start
So this is the power the
commander of Toman holds.

00:13:00.749 --> 00:13:03.718 position:16% line:83% align:start
I brought you here today
to talk about Moebius.

00:13:03.752 --> 00:13:06.053 position:21% line:83% align:start
If they go up against
us, it'll mean war.

00:13:06.086 --> 00:13:08.956 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] Who's Moebius?
And what's this about a war?

00:13:08.989 --> 00:13:10.958 position:13% line:89% align:start
No one told me about this!

00:13:11.925 --> 00:13:14.328 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Mikey] So! I want to
know what you all think.

00:13:16.765 --> 00:13:17.965 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:13:18.667 --> 00:13:20.100 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hey! What the hell?

00:13:22.604 --> 00:13:24.138 position:19% line:89% align:start
What'd you do that for?

00:13:24.171 --> 00:13:25.139 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Peh] Problem?

00:13:25.172 --> 00:13:27.341 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're that Hanagaki punk right?

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:30.645 position:13% line:83% align:start
You're the little shit
that got our boss Kiyomasa

00:13:30.679 --> 00:13:32.346 position:13% line:89% align:start
put outta commission, huh?

00:13:33.981 --> 00:13:37.351 position:10% line:83% align:start
Yeah, and I'm thinking you're
gonna have to pay for that.

00:13:37.384 --> 00:13:39.386 position:30% line:89% align:start
Pay for it how?

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:40.220 position:30% line:89% align:start
Back off, Pah.

00:13:41.723 --> 00:13:43.591 position:19% line:83% align:start
You know full well
we're supposed to drop

00:13:43.625 --> 00:13:45.326 position:10% line:89% align:start
the whole Kiyomasa issue now

00:13:45.359 --> 00:13:48.563 position:10% line:83% align:start
since he used Toman's name to
promote his little fight club.

00:13:48.596 --> 00:13:50.765 position:10% line:89% align:start
Huh? Well, I'm stupid I guess

00:13:50.799 --> 00:13:52.933 position:19% line:83% align:start
'cause I don't know
what any of that means!

00:13:52.966 --> 00:13:55.737 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Peh] Yeah, remember, Pah has
the brains of a sand flea!

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:58.238 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Pah] Who asked for your
opinion, you dipshit!

00:13:58.272 --> 00:14:00.407 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hey! Pah!

00:14:00.441 --> 00:14:01.576 position:21% line:89% align:start
Keep your mouth shut.

00:14:02.443 --> 00:14:03.578 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Pah] Sorry, Draken.

00:14:08.982 --> 00:14:11.820 position:21% line:83% align:start
Don't hold it against
him, Takemitchy.

00:14:11.885 --> 00:14:13.987 position:21% line:83% align:start
Pah's just pretty
pissed off right now.

00:14:15.824 --> 00:14:18.292 position:27% line:83% align:start
He's sorta out of
control, isn't he?

00:14:18.325 --> 00:14:20.994 position:19% line:83% align:start
His best bud got
worked over by Moebius.

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:23.698 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's what ignited all of this.

00:14:23.732 --> 00:14:26.300 position:21% line:83% align:start
Huh? What do you
mean, what happened?

00:14:26.333 --> 00:14:28.135 position:30% line:89% align:start
It was Osanai.

00:14:28.168 --> 00:14:30.904 position:16% line:83% align:start
He's the leader of
Moebius and a rough dude.

00:14:32.239 --> 00:14:34.875 position:10% line:83% align:start
Pah's pal crossed him and
got the shit beat out of him,

00:14:34.908 --> 00:14:36.544 position:30% line:83% align:start
then they raped
his girlfriend

00:14:36.578 --> 00:14:38.212 position:19% line:89% align:start
right in front of him.

00:14:38.245 --> 00:14:40.247 position:19% line:83% align:start
To top it all off, they
took all his money,

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.916 position:10% line:83% align:start
and then later they beat up
his parents and siblings too.

00:14:44.251 --> 00:14:45.620 position:41% line:89% align:start
Brutal.

00:14:45.653 --> 00:14:48.757 position:10% line:83% align:start
That's just the way the
whole Moebius gang operates.

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:50.558 position:19% line:83% align:start
They're two generations
above our gang

00:14:50.592 --> 00:14:52.059 position:19% line:89% align:start
and they run Shinjuku.

00:14:52.092 --> 00:14:55.295 position:21% line:83% align:start
What? I thought Toman
ran this whole area.

00:14:55.329 --> 00:14:59.099 position:21% line:83% align:start
Toman runs Shibuya.
Shinjuku is separate.

00:14:59.133 --> 00:15:02.604 position:13% line:83% align:start
And our whole gang is
still a relatively new one.

00:15:02.637 --> 00:15:04.304 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] So in
this time frame,

00:15:04.338 --> 00:15:07.074 position:13% line:83% align:start
there was another gang that
was even bigger than Toman!

00:15:08.576 --> 00:15:10.578 position:30% line:89% align:start
Well then, Pah.

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.080 position:44% line:89% align:start
War?

00:15:14.214 --> 00:15:16.551 position:21% line:83% align:start
Moebius are
experienced fighters.

00:15:19.086 --> 00:15:22.222 position:21% line:83% align:start
Some of Toman's guys
aren't gonna survive,

00:15:22.256 --> 00:15:24.992 position:21% line:83% align:start
and I'd be making you
guys fight my battle.

00:15:27.762 --> 00:15:31.265 position:24% line:83% align:start
But I'm too pissed
off to let it go.

00:15:31.298 --> 00:15:33.267 position:24% line:83% align:start
But that's not what
I was asking you.

00:15:34.602 --> 00:15:37.204 position:13% line:89% align:start
Are we gonna fight or not?

00:15:39.707 --> 00:15:40.941 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yes, I wanna fight!

00:15:40.974 --> 00:15:44.011 position:19% line:83% align:start
I wanna murder all
those sons of bitches!

00:15:44.044 --> 00:15:45.045 position:35% line:89% align:start
Thought so.

00:15:51.018 --> 00:15:53.721 position:19% line:83% align:start
Anyone here think
Pah's beef with Moebius

00:15:53.755 --> 00:15:55.690 position:5% line:89% align:start
is too much for us to deal with?

00:15:55.723 --> 00:15:57.291 position:38% line:83% align:start
-No way!
-Come on!

00:15:57.324 --> 00:15:59.694 position:24% line:83% align:start
Anyone here scared
of getting beat up?

00:15:59.727 --> 00:16:01.495 position:7% line:89% align:start
Anyone here scared of Moebius?

00:16:01.529 --> 00:16:03.497 position:30% line:83% align:start
-No!
-Those wusses!

00:16:03.531 --> 00:16:04.666 position:30% line:89% align:start
There, you see?

00:16:04.699 --> 00:16:07.334 position:27% line:89% align:start
(gang chuckling)

00:16:11.104 --> 00:16:13.273 position:19% line:89% align:start
Moebius is gonna fall!

00:16:13.307 --> 00:16:14.943 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Gang] Yeah!

00:16:14.975 --> 00:16:17.244 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Mikey] August 3rd, at
the Musashi Festival!

00:16:17.277 --> 00:16:18.979 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's where it's
all gonna go down!

00:16:19.012 --> 00:16:24.051 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Right!
-Yeah, boy, woo!

00:16:24.786 --> 00:16:27.488 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] August 3rd.

00:16:27.522 --> 00:16:30.190 position:21% line:83% align:start
And on August 3rd,
you'll save Ryuguji.

00:16:32.359 --> 00:16:34.194 position:13% line:89% align:start
That's the day Draken dies!

00:16:35.797 --> 00:16:39.233 position:13% line:83% align:start
Naoto said that August 3rd
is when the Mikey faction

00:16:39.266 --> 00:16:41.703 position:19% line:83% align:start
and the Draken faction
have a conflict

00:16:41.736 --> 00:16:43.337 position:16% line:89% align:start
that gets Draken killed.

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:45.740 position:21% line:83% align:start
But now that I'm here
12 years in the past,

00:16:45.773 --> 00:16:48.710 position:10% line:83% align:start
a battle between Toman and
Moebius is about to go down.

00:16:50.879 --> 00:16:53.113 position:19% line:89% align:start
So what does that mean?

00:16:53.146 --> 00:16:55.617 position:10% line:83% align:start
It means I'm not smart enough
to figure all this out!

00:16:57.217 --> 00:16:59.253 position:7% line:89% align:start
All right, Naoto, I've got it!

00:16:59.286 --> 00:17:01.723 position:27% line:83% align:start
I know just how I
can save Draken.

00:17:01.756 --> 00:17:03.691 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm gonna be his bodyguard.

00:17:03.725 --> 00:17:07.194 position:13% line:83% align:start
No doubt. This idea proves
I'm a freaking genius.

00:17:07.227 --> 00:17:09.831 position:21% line:89% align:start
My bodyguard? No way.

00:17:09.864 --> 00:17:11.699 position:21% line:83% align:start
Oh, thank you!
You'll be glad you...

00:17:11.733 --> 00:17:13.968 position:21% line:89% align:start
Wait, what'd you say?

00:17:14.002 --> 00:17:16.704 position:21% line:83% align:start
Why would I want
anything so annoying?

00:17:16.738 --> 00:17:18.740 position:7% line:89% align:start
You'd suck at that job anyway.

00:17:18.773 --> 00:17:20.642 position:10% line:89% align:start
You don't mean it like that!

00:17:20.675 --> 00:17:23.310 position:16% line:83% align:start
I can't believe I failed
my mission already.

00:17:23.343 --> 00:17:26.681 position:13% line:83% align:start
But I'm not giving up that
easily. Time for plan B!

00:17:26.714 --> 00:17:29.383 position:16% line:83% align:start
If I can't guard him, at
least I can follow him!

00:17:30.885 --> 00:17:31.886 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Mikey] What the hell, man?

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:32.887 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:17:32.921 --> 00:17:33.988 position:38% line:89% align:start
A fight?

00:17:34.022 --> 00:17:35.990 position:10% line:89% align:start
Someone's gonna pay for this!

00:17:36.024 --> 00:17:37.190 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] He's pissed!

00:17:37.224 --> 00:17:38.927 position:19% line:83% align:start
Is this where his fight
with Draken starts?

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.628 position:27% line:83% align:start
There's no flag
in my kid's meal!

00:17:44.464 --> 00:17:45.232 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Huh?

00:17:45.265 --> 00:17:46.466 position:19% line:89% align:start
I ordered a kid's meal

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.803 position:21% line:83% align:start
and it's not a kid's
meal without a flag!

00:17:48.836 --> 00:17:50.939 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry, sir. I'll go
get you one right away.

00:17:50.972 --> 00:17:53.307 position:24% line:83% align:start
Here you go, Mikey.
There's your flag.

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:56.778 position:19% line:83% align:start
Oh! (laughs) All right,
Kenny, you did it!

00:17:56.811 --> 00:17:59.346 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] What? Where
did he get the flag from?

00:18:00.615 --> 00:18:03.483 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Draken] (groans) That's
it! I've had it with you!

00:18:03.518 --> 00:18:04.552 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Huh?

00:18:04.586 --> 00:18:06.521 position:19% line:83% align:start
Now they sound for sure
like they're fighting!

00:18:06.554 --> 00:18:09.089 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(Mikey snoring)
-(Draken grumbling)

00:18:09.122 --> 00:18:10.758 position:24% line:89% align:start
What? He's asleep?

00:18:10.792 --> 00:18:13.193 position:19% line:83% align:start
Damn it, I hate the way
you always fall asleep

00:18:13.226 --> 00:18:14.461 position:21% line:89% align:start
right after you eat.

00:18:15.597 --> 00:18:17.732 position:24% line:83% align:start
I swear, Mikey, you
are so hopeless.

00:18:19.232 --> 00:18:20.935 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] Wow, I
guess that's just how

00:18:20.969 --> 00:18:22.637 position:13% line:89% align:start
Mikey is most of the time.

00:18:29.142 --> 00:18:31.378 position:13% line:89% align:start
Draken is freaking amazing.

00:18:31.411 --> 00:18:34.448 position:13% line:83% align:start
He's got Mikey's back
every minute of every day.

00:18:34.481 --> 00:18:37.184 position:24% line:83% align:start
But if he were
ever to lose it...

00:18:40.955 --> 00:18:43.156 position:13% line:89% align:start
Wake up, Mikey. We're here.

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:46.126 position:19% line:83% align:start
Huh? What are we
doing at the hospital?

00:18:47.494 --> 00:18:49.429 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Draken] We're making
a little visit.

00:18:51.633 --> 00:18:53.233 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Mikey] Who's that?

00:18:53.266 --> 00:18:55.302 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Draken] Pah's
buddy's girlfriend.

00:18:57.137 --> 00:18:58.606 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] She's the
reason this conflict

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.307 position:21% line:89% align:start
with Moebius started.

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:03.443 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Draken] She's been
unconscious for five days now.

00:19:06.179 --> 00:19:08.415 position:27% line:83% align:start
What the hell are
you doing here?

00:19:08.448 --> 00:19:10.685 position:27% line:83% align:start
How dare you show
your faces here!

00:19:10.718 --> 00:19:11.686 position:38% line:89% align:start
Get out!

00:19:11.719 --> 00:19:12.720 position:35% line:89% align:start
Easy, dear.

00:19:15.757 --> 00:19:17.190 position:21% line:89% align:start
Get out, both of you!

00:19:17.224 --> 00:19:18.425 position:16% line:89% align:start
Our daughter almost died

00:19:18.458 --> 00:19:20.528 position:24% line:83% align:start
because of gangster
trash like you!

00:19:20.561 --> 00:19:22.630 position:19% line:83% align:start
We haven't done
anything wrong, Kenny.

00:19:22.664 --> 00:19:23.831 position:19% line:89% align:start
Don't bow to this guy.

00:19:23.865 --> 00:19:26.868 position:10% line:83% align:start
Why are you trying to take
it out on us anyway, old man?

00:19:26.901 --> 00:19:28.536 position:19% line:89% align:start
You disgusting vermin!

00:19:28.569 --> 00:19:31.271 position:13% line:83% align:start
Every night out looking for
a fight and causing damage

00:19:31.304 --> 00:19:33.240 position:13% line:83% align:start
and destruction and
danger to innocent people!

00:19:33.273 --> 00:19:34.441 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Mother] Honey, stop.

00:19:34.474 --> 00:19:35.610 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:19:35.643 --> 00:19:38.345 position:5% line:83% align:start
You disrespect people's property
and their neighborhoods!

00:19:38.378 --> 00:19:40.148 position:7% line:89% align:start
Acting like irresponsible kids

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:41.783 position:21% line:83% align:start
even now when you're
so-called adults?

00:19:41.816 --> 00:19:43.851 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're all just
worthless little punks!

00:19:45.185 --> 00:19:47.320 position:19% line:83% align:start
Who do you think you're
talking to, old man?

00:19:48.321 --> 00:19:49.489 position:24% line:89% align:start
What are you doing?

00:19:49.524 --> 00:19:52.694 position:24% line:83% align:start
Chill out. We're
in the wrong here.

00:19:52.727 --> 00:19:54.996 position:21% line:83% align:start
Like getting bowed to
by two pieces of shit

00:19:55.029 --> 00:19:56.698 position:27% line:83% align:start
is going to make
my daughter well?

00:19:56.731 --> 00:19:57.899 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:19:57.932 --> 00:19:59.332 position:13% line:89% align:start
Mikey just shut your mouth.

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.704 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] Mikey's
right though, actually.

00:20:02.737 --> 00:20:04.639 position:21% line:83% align:start
They're not the ones
who hurt this girl.

00:20:04.672 --> 00:20:08.375 position:21% line:83% align:start
Our poor daughter, in
a coma for days now!

00:20:11.179 --> 00:20:12.880 position:27% line:89% align:start
Just look at her!

00:20:12.914 --> 00:20:17.652 position:13% line:83% align:start
Her face and her body have
been battered and bruised!

00:20:17.685 --> 00:20:19.854 position:38% line:89% align:start
(sobbing)

00:20:21.756 --> 00:20:23.524 position:33% line:89% align:start
And for what?

00:20:23.558 --> 00:20:26.527 position:13% line:83% align:start
What did she ever do to you
to deserve such cruel abuse?

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:30.932 position:30% line:89% align:start
(mother crying)

00:20:30.965 --> 00:20:33.201 position:16% line:89% align:start
Our beautiful little girl

00:20:33.233 --> 00:20:36.336 position:19% line:83% align:start
has been disfigured
and despoiled for life!

00:20:36.369 --> 00:20:38.606 position:5% line:89% align:start
You scum have ruined everything.

00:20:42.309 --> 00:20:43.644 position:33% line:89% align:start
Please leave.

00:20:43.678 --> 00:20:46.848 position:16% line:83% align:start
We never want to see you
here or anywhere again.

00:20:53.688 --> 00:20:56.157 position:7% line:89% align:start
Soon we'll be fighting Moebius.

00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:58.325 position:27% line:83% align:start
We'll deal with
our own problems,

00:20:58.358 --> 00:21:00.393 position:7% line:89% align:start
but it'll be in our own world.

00:21:01.361 --> 00:21:04.264 position:19% line:83% align:start
All of our crew have
families and relatives

00:21:04.297 --> 00:21:06.667 position:24% line:83% align:start
and people who are
important to them.

00:21:06.701 --> 00:21:09.771 position:10% line:83% align:start
We can't let innocent people
get dragged into this.

00:21:09.804 --> 00:21:11.773 position:24% line:83% align:start
We can't hurt their
friends and family.

00:21:13.241 --> 00:21:15.408 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's not that you
have to bow your head.

00:21:16.309 --> 00:21:18.311 position:10% line:89% align:start
Just have a heart that cares.

00:21:21.849 --> 00:21:23.350 position:16% line:89% align:start
You're a good guy, Kenny.

00:21:24.585 --> 00:21:26.486 position:13% line:89% align:start
You're right, I apologize,

00:21:27.655 --> 00:21:30.958 position:21% line:83% align:start
and I'm glad to
have you by my side.

00:21:34.662 --> 00:21:37.064 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] I think
now I can understand

00:21:37.098 --> 00:21:40.067 position:10% line:83% align:start
why Mikey would have changed
so much after Draken died.

00:21:41.334 --> 00:21:44.071 position:19% line:83% align:start
And how the Toman of
12 years in the future

00:21:44.105 --> 00:21:45.907 position:24% line:83% align:start
became such an
evil organization.

00:21:47.508 --> 00:21:49.877 position:19% line:83% align:start
Draken was never
supposed to have died.

00:21:51.279 --> 00:21:53.247 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] Draken
is Mikey's heart.

00:21:53.281 --> 00:21:55.516 position:24% line:83% align:start
He compensates for
what Mikey lacks.

00:21:58.418 --> 00:22:00.487 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm feeling pretty hungry
all of a sudden, Kenny.

00:22:00.521 --> 00:22:03.558 position:16% line:83% align:start
What? You just chowed
down a whole kid's meal.

00:22:03.591 --> 00:22:05.358 position:5% line:89% align:start
I always get hungry after a nap.

00:22:05.392 --> 00:22:07.394 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Draken] How does
that even work?

00:22:08.629 --> 00:22:10.965 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] If only
Naoto could see this.

00:22:10.998 --> 00:22:12.133 position:24% line:89% align:start
I knew I was right!

00:22:12.166 --> 00:22:14.035 position:24% line:83% align:start
There's just no
way that these two

00:22:14.068 --> 00:22:15.536 position:10% line:89% align:start
could ever fight each other!

00:22:17.905 --> 00:22:20.808 position:21% line:89% align:start
(closing theme music)

00:22:27.315 --> 00:22:31.986 position:24% line:83% align:start
