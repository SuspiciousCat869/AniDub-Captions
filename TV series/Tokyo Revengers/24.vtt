00:00:07.642 --> 00:00:09.276 position:30% line:83% align:start
-What?
-This is crazy!

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:11.613 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Is this for real?
-There's no way!

00:00:11.646 --> 00:00:13.113 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Who's that?
-What?

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:14.949 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Toman Member] What the hell
is that Valhalla bastard

00:00:14.983 --> 00:00:16.584 position:16% line:89% align:start
doing at a Toman meeting?

00:00:16.618 --> 00:00:17.417 position:27% line:89% align:start
(crowd murmuring)

00:00:17.451 --> 00:00:19.086 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Chifuyu and Hanma?

00:00:19.954 --> 00:00:21.321 position:10% line:89% align:start
What's going on here, Mikey?

00:00:22.757 --> 00:00:25.927 position:19% line:83% align:start
As you all know, in the
Bloody Halloween battle,

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.631 position:24% line:83% align:start
Valhalla had 300
men to Toman's 150.

00:00:29.664 --> 00:00:32.901 position:5% line:83% align:start
And, despite those odds, because
all of you did your best,

00:00:32.934 --> 00:00:35.269 position:27% line:83% align:start
we still managed
to claim victory!

00:00:35.302 --> 00:00:39.507 position:7% line:83% align:start
And now Vice Commander Hanma
has something he wants to say!

00:00:39.541 --> 00:00:42.744 position:21% line:89% align:start
(footsteps thudding)

00:00:42.777 --> 00:00:44.812 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm Hanma Shuji from Valhalla.

00:00:44.846 --> 00:00:46.313 position:27% line:89% align:start
(crowd grumbling)

00:00:46.346 --> 00:00:49.383 position:10% line:83% align:start
Valhalla hasn't had an actual
commander for a long time.

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:52.887 position:10% line:83% align:start
So, after losing this
battle, we have, as a group,

00:00:52.921 --> 00:00:55.023 position:21% line:83% align:start
decided to reorganize
under Toman.

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:56.758 position:27% line:83% align:start
-What?
-There's no way!

00:00:56.791 --> 00:00:58.693 position:27% line:83% align:start
Valhalla and the
Tokyo Manji Gang

00:00:58.726 --> 00:01:00.528 position:13% line:89% align:start
are now officially allies!

00:01:00.562 --> 00:01:01.729 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Huh?

00:01:01.763 --> 00:01:02.730 position:30% line:83% align:start
-This is crazy!
-No way!

00:01:02.764 --> 00:01:04.231 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Toman Member] What?

00:01:04.264 --> 00:01:06.834 position:7% line:83% align:start
So all 300 members of Valhalla
are going to be under Toman?

00:01:06.868 --> 00:01:09.169 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Toman Member] That means
Toman's gonna have 450 members!

00:01:09.202 --> 00:01:11.171 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Toman Member] Dude,
Toman's gonna be awesome!

00:01:11.204 --> 00:01:12.507 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Toman] Yeah, unbeatable!

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.608 position:21% line:89% align:start
I can't get over it!

00:01:13.641 --> 00:01:15.610 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Cheering Toman
Member] Toman rules!

00:01:15.643 --> 00:01:19.313 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Crowd] Toman, Toman,
Toman, Toman, Toman!

00:01:20.682 --> 00:01:22.115 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Hey, wait a sec!

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:25.853 position:27% line:83% align:start
-(air whooshing)
-(tense music)

00:01:25.887 --> 00:01:28.488 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Toman, Toman!
-Something's wrong here!

00:01:28.523 --> 00:01:32.727 position:13% line:83% align:start
We finally managed to avoid
having Mikey kill Kazutora.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.362 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Toman, Toman!
-But now,

00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:37.197 position:24% line:83% align:start
if this dude joins
up with Toman,

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.802 position:16% line:83% align:start
and then Toman and
Valhalla combine forces,

00:01:40.835 --> 00:01:41.869 position:27% line:83% align:start
-it's gonna mean-
-Toman!

00:01:41.903 --> 00:01:44.137 position:21% line:83% align:start
-So!
-(Takemichi gasping)

00:01:44.171 --> 00:01:46.473 position:13% line:83% align:start
Now for the guy who brought
Mikey and me together.

00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:50.377 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's only because of him
that this all worked out.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.714 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] (gasping) No way!

00:01:52.747 --> 00:01:54.214 position:24% line:89% align:start
So come on up here!

00:01:54.247 --> 00:01:55.750 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-What?

00:01:55.783 --> 00:01:56.784 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasping)

00:01:56.818 --> 00:01:57.919 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Oh no!

00:01:57.952 --> 00:01:59.587 position:35% line:83% align:start
-What?
-What, huh?

00:01:59.621 --> 00:02:00.655 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Hanma] Tetta Kisaki!

00:02:00.688 --> 00:02:01.656 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Crowd] Whoa!

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:03.725 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Kisaki!

00:02:03.758 --> 00:02:05.793 position:21% line:89% align:start
Kisaki is the enemy.

00:02:05.827 --> 00:02:08.161 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Whoa!
-Yeah, yeah!

00:02:08.195 --> 00:02:09.998 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Yeah! (laughing)
-Hey!

00:02:10.031 --> 00:02:11.699 position:24% line:83% align:start
-How are you, man?
-Wow!

00:02:11.733 --> 00:02:12.900 position:30% line:83% align:start
-That's right!
-Yeah!

00:02:12.934 --> 00:02:14.002 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Yeah!
-(Toman member laughing)

00:02:14.035 --> 00:02:15.003 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasping)

00:02:15.036 --> 00:02:17.404 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Woo-hoo, yeah!
-Yeah!

00:02:17.437 --> 00:02:22.442 position:10% line:83% align:start
-(Takemichi hyperventilating)
-(somber music)

00:02:23.111 --> 00:02:26.380 position:27% line:89% align:start
(crowd cheering)

00:02:26.413 --> 00:02:29.917 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] We're
gonna get taken over!

00:02:29.951 --> 00:02:35.155 position:10% line:83% align:start
-(singer singing in Japanese)
-(opening theme music)

00:04:00.074 --> 00:04:04.879 position:27% line:5% align:start
-(crowd cheering)
-(crowd laughing)

00:04:07.648 --> 00:04:10.283 position:21% line:83% align:start
Baji sacrificed his
life to protect Toman

00:04:10.317 --> 00:04:12.553 position:21% line:83% align:start
and now Kisaki's just
gonna take it over!

00:04:13.888 --> 00:04:15.189 position:13% line:89% align:start
That means, in the future,

00:04:15.223 --> 00:04:17.324 position:24% line:83% align:start
Toman's still going
to end up evil!

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:20.228 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Did I mess it up again?
-Toman, Toman!

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.196 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Mikey] There's one more
thing I'd like to say!

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:23.798 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Toman!

00:04:23.831 --> 00:04:26.466 position:16% line:83% align:start
We gained some things
at the Bloody Halloween,

00:04:26.501 --> 00:04:28.468 position:10% line:89% align:start
but we lost some things too.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.908 position:13% line:83% align:start
Our First Division Captain,
Keisuke Baji, is dead.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.214 position:16% line:83% align:start
I urge you all to deeply
reflect upon this truth

00:04:40.248 --> 00:04:41.949 position:10% line:89% align:start
and find a way to accept it.

00:04:42.984 --> 00:04:44.585 position:13% line:89% align:start
I leave the closing to you,

00:04:44.619 --> 00:04:47.955 position:16% line:83% align:start
First Division Vice
Captain Chifuyu Matsuno.

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:54.294 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Chifuyu.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.331 position:16% line:83% align:start
I was seriously thinking
about quitting Toman,

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:01.434 position:19% line:83% align:start
but then the commander
said this to me.

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:04.371 position:27% line:83% align:start
"Are you going to
blow out the flame

00:05:04.404 --> 00:05:06.073 position:24% line:83% align:start
"of the First
Division for good?"

00:05:06.107 --> 00:05:07.875 position:21% line:89% align:start
(gentle somber music)

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:09.342 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] You poor guy,

00:05:09.376 --> 00:05:12.547 position:19% line:83% align:start
this must be harder for
you than for anyone.

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.850 position:5% line:83% align:start
Taking over as the First
Division Captain in Baji's place

00:05:15.883 --> 00:05:18.252 position:19% line:83% align:start
would have been way too
much for me to handle,

00:05:18.286 --> 00:05:20.221 position:7% line:89% align:start
so I talked with the commander.

00:05:20.254 --> 00:05:23.057 position:24% line:83% align:start
We talked for days
and days, in fact,

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.725 position:24% line:83% align:start
and I finally came
to a conclusion.

00:05:26.493 --> 00:05:29.931 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm the one who gets to decide
who I'm willing to follow!

00:05:30.998 --> 00:05:32.700 position:24% line:89% align:start
Takemichi Hanagaki!

00:05:32.733 --> 00:05:34.936 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're gonna take
over as the captain

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:37.004 position:19% line:83% align:start
-of the First Division!
-(Takemichi gasping)

00:05:37.038 --> 00:05:38.539 position:35% line:83% align:start
-What?
-That guy?

00:05:38.573 --> 00:05:40.608 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Toman Member] Is that the guy
who always got his ass kicked?

00:05:40.641 --> 00:05:41.876 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Toman Member] Oh, I don't know.

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:44.477 position:27% line:89% align:start
But this is nuts!

00:05:44.512 --> 00:05:47.347 position:19% line:83% align:start
So, Takemitchy, we will
honor Baji's final wish

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.183 position:30% line:89% align:start
before he died.

00:05:49.217 --> 00:05:50.952 position:7% line:89% align:start
You are the one that Baji chose

00:05:50.985 --> 00:05:53.287 position:21% line:83% align:start
and the commander and
I have finalized it!

00:05:53.321 --> 00:05:54.454 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasping)

00:05:54.487 --> 00:05:55.990 position:10% line:89% align:start
(crowd murmuring in surprise)

00:05:56.023 --> 00:05:57.357 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Are you serious?
-Him?

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.193 position:16% line:83% align:start
-I don't know.
-I wouldn't have guessed.

00:05:59.227 --> 00:06:03.331 position:10% line:89% align:start
(crowd murmuring in surprise)

00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:05.333 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Takemichi Hanagaki!
-(Takemichi gasping)

00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:06.934 position:24% line:83% align:start
Raise your head
and greet everyone!

00:06:06.968 --> 00:06:08.569 position:24% line:89% align:start
(triumphant music)

00:06:08.603 --> 00:06:11.839 position:10% line:89% align:start
I just know you can save her!

00:06:12.673 --> 00:06:14.809 position:16% line:89% align:start
Save everyone if you can.

00:06:14.842 --> 00:06:15.843 position:41% line:89% align:start
Crybaby

00:06:16.777 --> 00:06:17.778 position:44% line:89% align:start
hero.

00:06:18.613 --> 00:06:19.780 position:21% line:89% align:start
This isn't over yet.

00:06:21.048 --> 00:06:22.516 position:10% line:89% align:start
I've got to take over Toman!

00:06:23.517 --> 00:06:25.987 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm leaving them to you.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:30.091 position:7% line:89% align:start
(suspenseful triumphant music)

00:06:30.124 --> 00:06:32.159 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Hinata] Please, please go.

00:06:32.193 --> 00:06:35.529 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're so important to me, I
don't want you to die here too.

00:06:36.463 --> 00:06:38.032 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi grunting)

00:06:38.065 --> 00:06:40.433 position:13% line:89% align:start
This is still not over yet!

00:06:40.467 --> 00:06:42.570 position:7% line:83% align:start
-(crowd gasping)
-(crowd murmuring in surprise)

00:06:42.603 --> 00:06:44.105 position:16% line:89% align:start
I can still change Toman!

00:06:45.273 --> 00:06:46.240 position:41% line:89% align:start
I can!

00:06:46.274 --> 00:06:47.909 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi sobbing)

00:06:47.942 --> 00:06:49.409 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasping)

00:06:49.442 --> 00:06:51.779 position:5% line:89% align:start
Thanks for this one last chance!

00:06:51.812 --> 00:06:53.413 position:30% line:89% align:start
(pensive music)

00:06:53.446 --> 00:06:54.882 position:30% line:89% align:start
What the hell?

00:06:54.916 --> 00:06:56.217 position:16% line:89% align:start
What are you crying for?

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:57.518 position:19% line:89% align:start
What a crazy reaction!

00:06:57.551 --> 00:07:00.554 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yeah, now I'm gonna have
to redo his embroidery.

00:07:00.588 --> 00:07:04.225 position:13% line:83% align:start
(chuckling) That's not
raising your head, dumbass.

00:07:04.258 --> 00:07:07.728 position:10% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi strained sobbing)

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.099 position:21% line:83% align:start
-(footsteps thudding)
-(triumphant music)

00:07:12.133 --> 00:07:14.302 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] The more I do,
the worse the situation

00:07:14.335 --> 00:07:17.505 position:24% line:83% align:start
seems to get, but
there's still hope,

00:07:18.205 --> 00:07:20.041 position:33% line:89% align:start
right, Naoto?

00:07:21.342 --> 00:07:22.810 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Hinata] Huh?

00:07:22.843 --> 00:07:25.445 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] There has to be
something I can still do!

00:07:26.547 --> 00:07:28.015 position:30% line:89% align:start
(air whooshing)

00:07:28.049 --> 00:07:30.551 position:24% line:89% align:start
(energy crackling)

00:07:30.584 --> 00:07:33.688 position:30% line:89% align:start
(upbeat music)

00:07:33.721 --> 00:07:37.224 position:7% line:89% align:start
I came back to 2017 this time,

00:07:37.258 --> 00:07:40.127 position:7% line:89% align:start
back to the rental shop again.

00:07:40.161 --> 00:07:41.929 position:21% line:89% align:start
(footsteps thudding)

00:07:41.963 --> 00:07:42.964 position:35% line:89% align:start
My manager.

00:07:42.997 --> 00:07:45.566 position:24% line:83% align:start
Everything's just
the same as it was.

00:07:45.599 --> 00:07:48.002 position:27% line:83% align:start
So sorry to keep
you waiting, sir!

00:07:48.035 --> 00:07:48.936 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Huh?

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:50.738 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Manager] I checked,
but I'm sorry to say

00:07:50.771 --> 00:07:53.407 position:10% line:83% align:start
we don't have what you're
looking for at this location.

00:07:53.441 --> 00:07:54.942 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Huh?

00:07:54.976 --> 00:07:55.776 position:38% line:89% align:start
What the?

00:07:56.644 --> 00:07:58.079 position:16% line:83% align:start
-I called around to the-
-What am I doing

00:07:58.112 --> 00:07:59.513 position:13% line:83% align:start
-with this nice watch?
-Other stores in the area,

00:07:59.547 --> 00:08:00.480 position:21% line:83% align:start
-but even there it's-
-And this expensive

00:08:00.514 --> 00:08:01.615 position:30% line:83% align:start
-looking bag?
-On back order,

00:08:01.649 --> 00:08:04.085 position:16% line:83% align:start
so it will take at least
a week to get it in.

00:08:04.118 --> 00:08:05.619 position:13% line:83% align:start
-What would you like to do?
-(Takemichi gasping)

00:08:05.653 --> 00:08:08.089 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] What the
hell is this haircut?

00:08:08.122 --> 00:08:09.557 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Manager] Sir?

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:12.026 position:13% line:83% align:start
Uh, I, uh, oh, that's
okay, don't worry about it!

00:08:13.427 --> 00:08:15.062 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Manager] Thank you, sir!

00:08:15.096 --> 00:08:17.264 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasping)

00:08:17.298 --> 00:08:19.700 position:5% line:89% align:start
Took you long enough, Takemichi.

00:08:19.734 --> 00:08:22.503 position:19% line:83% align:start
You love coming to this
rental shop, don't you?

00:08:23.237 --> 00:08:25.239 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Wait, who is this?

00:08:25.272 --> 00:08:26.440 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Let's go.
-(car horn blaring)

00:08:26.474 --> 00:08:28.075 position:19% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi shuddering)

00:08:28.109 --> 00:08:29.210 position:38% line:89% align:start
Go where?

00:08:29.243 --> 00:08:30.644 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Man] Get in already.

00:08:32.146 --> 00:08:33.247 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:38.285 position:27% line:83% align:start
-(car whooshing)
-(tense music)

00:08:39.353 --> 00:08:40.621 position:10% line:89% align:start
I ended up getting in, but...

00:08:41.756 --> 00:08:44.425 position:21% line:83% align:start
So, uh, where
exactly are we going?

00:08:44.458 --> 00:08:46.460 position:27% line:83% align:start
Huh, the hell are
you talking about?

00:08:46.494 --> 00:08:47.895 position:13% line:89% align:start
We're going to your place.

00:08:47.928 --> 00:08:48.963 position:38% line:89% align:start
My place?

00:08:50.331 --> 00:08:51.632 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hold on, my apartment's actually

00:08:51.665 --> 00:08:53.467 position:10% line:83% align:start
-the other way-
-You gave the orders for this

00:08:53.502 --> 00:08:55.002 position:19% line:89% align:start
isn't that right, Koji?

00:08:55.036 --> 00:08:55.903 position:38% line:89% align:start
Yes, sir!

00:08:55.936 --> 00:08:57.571 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] I gave them orders?

00:08:57.605 --> 00:08:59.508 position:24% line:83% align:start
What the hell are
they talking about?

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.442 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Koji] Would you mind
if I had a smoke, sir?

00:09:01.475 --> 00:09:02.843 position:21% line:83% align:start
-(Koji grunting)
-(Takemichi gasping)

00:09:02.877 --> 00:09:04.311 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Man] Takemichi doesn't like
cars that smell like smoke!

00:09:04.345 --> 00:09:05.514 position:33% line:89% align:start
What the hell

00:09:05.546 --> 00:09:06.914 position:16% line:83% align:start
-is going on here?
-I already told you that,

00:09:06.947 --> 00:09:08.282 position:10% line:83% align:start
-you jackass!
-They care about what I like?

00:09:08.315 --> 00:09:09.216 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Alright, alright, I'm sorry!
-Scary guys like these?

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:10.551 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Koji] Holy smokes!

00:09:10.584 --> 00:09:11.886 position:21% line:83% align:start
-(Takemichi gasping)
-Was that a pun?

00:09:11.919 --> 00:09:12.553 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Are you making fun of me?
-I know, I'll call Naoto!

00:09:12.586 --> 00:09:13.554 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Koji] No, no!

00:09:13.587 --> 00:09:14.555 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Huh?

00:09:14.588 --> 00:09:16.057 position:10% line:89% align:start
His number's not in my phone!

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:17.691 position:21% line:83% align:start
-(Takemichi gasping)
-(tires screeching)

00:09:17.725 --> 00:09:19.593 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi sighing)

00:09:19.627 --> 00:09:20.761 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yo, Takemichi.

00:09:20.795 --> 00:09:23.764 position:21% line:83% align:start
-(Takemichi gasping)
-(tense music)

00:09:23.798 --> 00:09:26.967 position:16% line:83% align:start
Better get your shit
together man, we're here.

00:09:27.001 --> 00:09:28.537 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, right.

00:09:28.569 --> 00:09:30.204 position:19% line:89% align:start
Now what am I gonna do?

00:09:30.237 --> 00:09:31.639 position:13% line:89% align:start
Even if I find his number,

00:09:31.672 --> 00:09:34.275 position:16% line:83% align:start
I can't call Naoto in
front of all these guys!

00:09:34.308 --> 00:09:35.276 position:24% line:89% align:start
(car door thudding)

00:09:35.309 --> 00:09:36.277 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Group] Welcome, sir!

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:38.145 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi yelping)

00:09:38.179 --> 00:09:39.346 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] What the what?

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:40.848 position:5% line:89% align:start
Took you long enough, Takemichi.

00:09:40.881 --> 00:09:42.016 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Yikes, more scary-ass-
-Why're you keeping us

00:09:42.049 --> 00:09:43.984 position:19% line:83% align:start
-all waiting?
-Dudes I've never met!

00:09:44.919 --> 00:09:46.353 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hey, wait a second, though.

00:09:46.387 --> 00:09:47.154 position:5% line:89% align:start
Can't let this kinda shit happen

00:09:47.188 --> 00:09:48.557 position:21% line:89% align:start
I feel like I've seen

00:09:48.589 --> 00:09:49.690 position:16% line:83% align:start
-these guys before.
-or we're all gonna pay.

00:09:49.723 --> 00:09:51.859 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yamagishi, you need
to keep him in line!

00:09:51.892 --> 00:09:54.195 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] (gasping) Yamagishi?

00:09:54.228 --> 00:09:55.396 position:41% line:89% align:start
No way!

00:09:55.429 --> 00:09:56.664 position:10% line:89% align:start
I didn't even recognize him!

00:09:56.697 --> 00:10:00.000 position:21% line:83% align:start
Not my fault, this
slow-ass made us stop

00:10:00.034 --> 00:10:02.036 position:21% line:83% align:start
so he could rent some
DVD or something.

00:10:02.069 --> 00:10:04.138 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] Wait, then
that means these two are

00:10:04.171 --> 00:10:05.840 position:24% line:89% align:start
Makoto and Takuya!

00:10:07.775 --> 00:10:10.811 position:13% line:83% align:start
These guys are my old crew
from Mizo Middle School!

00:10:10.845 --> 00:10:12.346 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Makoto] Come on, let's go.

00:10:12.379 --> 00:10:13.814 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi grunting)

00:10:13.848 --> 00:10:16.551 position:10% line:83% align:start
Number Two's been waitin'
for us for a while now, Boss.

00:10:16.585 --> 00:10:18.219 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Huh? What?

00:10:18.252 --> 00:10:20.921 position:30% line:89% align:start
(pensive music)

00:10:23.592 --> 00:10:25.560 position:21% line:89% align:start
Wait, does this mean

00:10:25.594 --> 00:10:27.228 position:24% line:89% align:start
(elevator chiming)

00:10:27.261 --> 00:10:29.830 position:16% line:89% align:start
(elevator doors rattling)

00:10:29.864 --> 00:10:32.900 position:19% line:83% align:start
that in this future
I'm actually a winner?

00:10:32.933 --> 00:10:36.036 position:24% line:83% align:start
Did I somehow climb
my way to the top?

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:37.204 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Group] Sir!

00:10:37.238 --> 00:10:39.140 position:19% line:89% align:start
Welcome back home sir!

00:10:39.173 --> 00:10:41.742 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasping)

00:10:41.775 --> 00:10:44.111 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] This is my place?

00:10:44.145 --> 00:10:46.747 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Chifuyu] Answer your
damn phone, Takemitchy.

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:48.983 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] (gasping) Chifuyu?

00:10:49.016 --> 00:10:51.152 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh, thank goodness
it's you, Chifuyu!

00:10:51.185 --> 00:10:53.654 position:21% line:83% align:start
I have no idea
what's going on here!

00:10:53.687 --> 00:10:55.789 position:19% line:83% align:start
Huh? What the hell are
you talking about?

00:10:55.823 --> 00:10:56.991 position:27% line:89% align:start
Top boss meeting.

00:10:57.024 --> 00:10:57.992 position:38% line:89% align:start
Let's go.

00:10:58.025 --> 00:10:58.993 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:10:59.026 --> 00:10:59.960 position:38% line:89% align:start
Top boss?

00:10:59.994 --> 00:11:00.961 position:38% line:89% align:start
Of what?

00:11:00.995 --> 00:11:02.496 position:13% line:89% align:start
What're you talking about?

00:11:02.531 --> 00:11:06.467 position:10% line:83% align:start
Yo, come on, partner, who do
you think I'm talking about?

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:08.769 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're Tokyo Manji
Gang's top exec,

00:11:09.403 --> 00:11:10.871 position:24% line:89% align:start
Takemichi Hanagaki.

00:11:10.905 --> 00:11:12.773 position:19% line:89% align:start
(energetic rock music)

00:11:12.806 --> 00:11:14.108 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasping)

00:11:14.141 --> 00:11:15.743 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Me?

00:11:15.776 --> 00:11:17.778 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm the top exec of Toman?

00:11:22.783 --> 00:11:25.554 position:13% line:83% align:start
-(footsteps thudding)
-(distant traffic humming)

00:11:25.587 --> 00:11:26.787 position:30% line:89% align:start
This way, sir.

00:11:28.355 --> 00:11:30.891 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi grunting)

00:11:30.925 --> 00:11:33.928 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Nahoya] Hey, who the hell
ordered the jellyfish?

00:11:33.961 --> 00:11:36.598 position:10% line:83% align:start
Man, the mapo is spicy, it's
got way too much pepper!

00:11:36.631 --> 00:11:38.533 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hey, where the hell's
the fried rice?

00:11:38.567 --> 00:11:40.401 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Sir?
-(Takemichi gasping)

00:11:40.434 --> 00:11:42.703 position:16% line:89% align:start
(gentle classical music)

00:11:42.736 --> 00:11:45.472 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi grunting)

00:11:45.507 --> 00:11:46.874 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] I can't believe it,

00:11:46.907 --> 00:11:49.977 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm seriously an
executive in Toman now!

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:52.581 position:19% line:83% align:start
And that means I might
be able to get closer

00:11:52.614 --> 00:11:54.315 position:24% line:83% align:start
to the core of
the present Toman,

00:11:54.348 --> 00:11:56.717 position:16% line:83% align:start
something we didn't know
anything about before!

00:11:57.851 --> 00:11:59.086 position:24% line:83% align:start
(Takemichi grunting
uncomfortably)

00:11:59.119 --> 00:12:01.722 position:19% line:83% align:start
But why the hell isn't
Naoto's number in here?

00:12:02.923 --> 00:12:06.360 position:13% line:83% align:start
Item one on the agenda:
our treasury fund balances.

00:12:06.393 --> 00:12:07.629 position:16% line:89% align:start
Uh, no the first item is

00:12:07.662 --> 00:12:09.930 position:16% line:83% align:start
where is my goddamn
fried rice, you jackass.

00:12:09.964 --> 00:12:11.600 position:24% line:83% align:start
And, besides that,
there are still

00:12:11.633 --> 00:12:13.367 position:27% line:83% align:start
some guys missing
from this meeting.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.368 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] It's Pah!

00:12:14.401 --> 00:12:15.302 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Yasuhiro] Shut up, Pah.

00:12:15.336 --> 00:12:16.504 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:12:16.538 --> 00:12:18.439 position:5% line:89% align:start
Just keep on stuffing your face.

00:12:18.472 --> 00:12:20.808 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] And that guy,
wasn't he the Fifth Division's-

00:12:20.841 --> 00:12:23.844 position:19% line:83% align:start
Besides, who's not here
other than Mitsuya?

00:12:23.877 --> 00:12:25.112 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Look around, there's others
-(Takemichi gasping)

00:12:25.145 --> 00:12:26.847 position:27% line:83% align:start
who aren't here
yet too, jackass!

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.949 position:13% line:83% align:start
And how come I still don't
have my damn fried rice?

00:12:28.983 --> 00:12:31.318 position:21% line:83% align:start
I can't eat unless I
got my rice, damn it!

00:12:31.352 --> 00:12:32.186 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Nahoya] Shit-for-brains.

00:12:32.219 --> 00:12:33.354 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-(Takemichi grunting)

00:12:33.387 --> 00:12:36.190 position:19% line:83% align:start
Fried rice always comes
last, you big baldy!

00:12:36.223 --> 00:12:38.359 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] That's the
Fourth Division's captain!

00:12:38.392 --> 00:12:39.927 position:27% line:89% align:start
Shit-for-brains?

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:42.564 position:16% line:83% align:start
Who the hell do you
think you're talkin' to?

00:12:42.597 --> 00:12:44.064 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] And that's Peh!

00:12:44.098 --> 00:12:47.101 position:10% line:83% align:start
Everybody knows Pah's brain's
made of air, you asshole!

00:12:47.134 --> 00:12:48.335 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah!

00:12:48.369 --> 00:12:50.871 position:13% line:83% align:start
Then you should ask them to
make the fried rice first.

00:12:50.904 --> 00:12:53.107 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] I guess some
things never change.

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:56.844 position:10% line:83% align:start
Even 12 years later, everyone
is still here in Toman.

00:12:57.811 --> 00:12:59.280 position:19% line:89% align:start
All you guys do is yap!

00:12:59.313 --> 00:13:00.548 position:27% line:89% align:start
Shut the hell up!

00:13:00.582 --> 00:13:02.584 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Shiba chomping)

00:13:02.617 --> 00:13:04.451 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] But who's this guy?

00:13:04.485 --> 00:13:06.086 position:24% line:89% align:start
Ya damn old-timers.

00:13:07.121 --> 00:13:07.821 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:13:07.855 --> 00:13:08.856 position:21% line:89% align:start
What'd you just say?

00:13:08.889 --> 00:13:10.391 position:27% line:83% align:start
You better watch
out you don't go

00:13:10.424 --> 00:13:12.092 position:13% line:89% align:start
gettin' a big head, Shiba!

00:13:12.126 --> 00:13:13.360 position:38% line:89% align:start
Shut up!

00:13:13.394 --> 00:13:16.930 position:5% line:83% align:start
Who do you think is putting food
on the table for you these days?

00:13:16.964 --> 00:13:19.433 position:13% line:83% align:start
You old-timers barely even
contribute to the treasury,

00:13:19.466 --> 00:13:20.868 position:21% line:89% align:start
you just lie around,

00:13:20.901 --> 00:13:22.570 position:16% line:83% align:start
only because you've been
here for the longest.

00:13:22.604 --> 00:13:24.739 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-The hell'd you just say?

00:13:24.773 --> 00:13:26.273 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hey, hold on-

00:13:26.307 --> 00:13:27.875 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Kokonoi chuckling)

00:13:27.908 --> 00:13:30.712 position:24% line:83% align:start
Come on, Inupi, you
are way too honest.

00:13:30.745 --> 00:13:32.580 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] Who are
these other guys?

00:13:32.614 --> 00:13:34.516 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Chifuyu] They keep talking
like they're the shit.

00:13:34.549 --> 00:13:35.517 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Hm?

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:37.585 position:19% line:89% align:start
Damn ex-Black Dragons.

00:13:37.619 --> 00:13:39.119 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Black Dragons?

00:13:39.153 --> 00:13:41.422 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hey, where the hell
is Mikey, anyways?

00:13:41.455 --> 00:13:44.191 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Shiba chomping)

00:13:44.224 --> 00:13:45.694 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:13:45.727 --> 00:13:47.796 position:16% line:83% align:start
Like he'd ever wanna
spend time with your ass.

00:13:47.828 --> 00:13:48.797 position:35% line:89% align:start
[Pah] Huh?

00:13:48.829 --> 00:13:51.432 position:21% line:89% align:start
Mikey, Mikey, Mikey.

00:13:51.465 --> 00:13:53.768 position:19% line:83% align:start
All you old-timers ever
do is whine about him

00:13:53.802 --> 00:13:55.436 position:7% line:89% align:start
whenever something goes wrong.

00:13:55.469 --> 00:13:57.938 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Shiba chomping)

00:13:57.971 --> 00:13:59.808 position:19% line:89% align:start
Clingy little bitches!

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.643 position:27% line:89% align:start
(chair crashing)

00:14:01.676 --> 00:14:05.112 position:21% line:89% align:start
(footsteps thudding)

00:14:05.145 --> 00:14:08.315 position:27% line:83% align:start
Shiba, let's take
this outside now!

00:14:08.349 --> 00:14:09.850 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh, what a pain.

00:14:11.151 --> 00:14:14.321 position:10% line:83% align:start
You idiots think you're back
on the playground in here?

00:14:14.355 --> 00:14:16.256 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Shuji Hanma!

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:17.458 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Pah growling)

00:14:17.491 --> 00:14:19.927 position:13% line:83% align:start
So he exists in this
version of the present too.

00:14:21.428 --> 00:14:24.064 position:16% line:83% align:start
What I wanted to discuss
at this regular meeting

00:14:24.098 --> 00:14:26.634 position:13% line:89% align:start
was not the treasury funds.

00:14:26.668 --> 00:14:30.971 position:13% line:83% align:start
Koko's public IT company
and Shiba's cover business

00:14:31.004 --> 00:14:33.474 position:16% line:83% align:start
and several of our other
front and shell companies

00:14:33.508 --> 00:14:38.412 position:13% line:83% align:start
were all raided by the cops
three days ago, which means

00:14:39.748 --> 00:14:41.882 position:19% line:83% align:start
We have a Judas
sitting here among us.

00:14:41.915 --> 00:14:44.552 position:30% line:89% align:start
(tense tapping)

00:14:44.586 --> 00:14:45.553 position:38% line:89% align:start
A Judas?

00:14:45.587 --> 00:14:47.421 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Yasuhiro] He means a traitor.

00:14:47.454 --> 00:14:48.823 position:16% line:89% align:start
There's no traitor here!

00:14:48.857 --> 00:14:50.424 position:7% line:89% align:start
Everyone here's a ride-or-die!

00:14:50.457 --> 00:14:51.659 position:30% line:89% align:start
Are you stupid?

00:14:51.693 --> 00:14:53.160 position:21% line:83% align:start
If no one's snitching
to the cops,

00:14:53.193 --> 00:14:54.829 position:21% line:83% align:start
then how the hell did
we all get searched

00:14:54.863 --> 00:14:56.063 position:21% line:89% align:start
on the very same day?

00:14:56.096 --> 00:14:57.231 position:21% line:89% align:start
You little punk-ass,

00:14:57.264 --> 00:14:59.032 position:19% line:83% align:start
who do you think
you're callin' stupid?

00:14:59.066 --> 00:15:00.502 position:21% line:83% align:start
And don't try to
make it sound better

00:15:00.535 --> 00:15:02.403 position:10% line:83% align:start
by calling him stupid
instead of dumbass, dumbass!

00:15:02.436 --> 00:15:04.438 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm the one who
called him a dumbass.

00:15:04.471 --> 00:15:05.372 position:24% line:89% align:start
Shut yer pie hole!

00:15:05.406 --> 00:15:06.306 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Inupi] If you're
lookin' to fight Koko,

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:07.374 position:7% line:89% align:start
maybe you should start with me!

00:15:07.408 --> 00:15:08.843 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Peh] What, you
want a piece of me?

00:15:08.877 --> 00:15:10.477 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Inupi] Yeah, bring it, dipshit!

00:15:10.512 --> 00:15:11.813 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Man] Looks like you're all

00:15:11.846 --> 00:15:12.847 position:13% line:83% align:start
-having fun.
-Careful what you ask for!

00:15:12.881 --> 00:15:13.947 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Huh? (gasping)
-(chairs scraping)

00:15:13.981 --> 00:15:15.517 position:19% line:83% align:start
[All Except Takemichi]
Good day, sir!

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:16.984 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi grunting)

00:15:17.017 --> 00:15:18.018 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] HuH?

00:15:18.051 --> 00:15:19.319 position:33% line:89% align:start
(tense music)

00:15:19.353 --> 00:15:22.356 position:27% line:89% align:start
(gasping) Kisaki!

00:15:22.389 --> 00:15:25.492 position:19% line:83% align:start
No need to be so
formal, guys, come on!

00:15:25.527 --> 00:15:26.326 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Huh?

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.796 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Hanma] It's rare
for you to show up

00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:30.497 position:24% line:83% align:start
at an upper echelon
meeting, Kisaki.

00:15:30.532 --> 00:15:32.199 position:10% line:89% align:start
I've got some business here.

00:15:32.232 --> 00:15:33.701 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] That's
Kisaki all right,

00:15:33.735 --> 00:15:36.704 position:7% line:89% align:start
but he seems different somehow.

00:15:38.506 --> 00:15:41.141 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi grunting)

00:15:41.175 --> 00:15:42.544 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:15:42.577 --> 00:15:44.244 position:24% line:89% align:start
Takemichi, Chifuyu,

00:15:44.278 --> 00:15:46.480 position:21% line:83% align:start
could I have a few
minutes of your time?

00:15:47.582 --> 00:15:49.584 position:33% line:89% align:start
Oh, uh, sure.

00:15:50.819 --> 00:15:53.487 position:30% line:89% align:start
(gentle music)

00:15:53.521 --> 00:15:55.088 position:19% line:89% align:start
Isn't this place great?

00:15:55.122 --> 00:15:56.724 position:21% line:89% align:start
I just had it built.

00:15:56.758 --> 00:15:58.025 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Awesome.

00:15:59.259 --> 00:16:00.562 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Kisaki] Well, have a seat.

00:16:00.595 --> 00:16:01.663 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Uh, sure.

00:16:03.096 --> 00:16:04.998 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Kisaki] You can
sit too, Chifuyu.

00:16:05.032 --> 00:16:07.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
Thanks, but I'll stand,
if you don't mind.

00:16:07.301 --> 00:16:10.103 position:16% line:83% align:start
(laughing) Always did
have a stick up your ass.

00:16:11.038 --> 00:16:12.372 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Tetta Kisaki!

00:16:12.406 --> 00:16:14.341 position:19% line:83% align:start
Always one of the
most important figures

00:16:14.374 --> 00:16:16.578 position:7% line:89% align:start
in the entire Tokyo Manji Gang

00:16:16.611 --> 00:16:19.914 position:21% line:83% align:start
and now, apparently,
its acting commander,

00:16:19.948 --> 00:16:22.884 position:16% line:83% align:start
the guy that somehow the
whole Tokyo police force

00:16:22.917 --> 00:16:24.686 position:7% line:89% align:start
could never get their hands on!

00:16:24.719 --> 00:16:27.054 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is this really that same Kisaki?

00:16:27.087 --> 00:16:28.523 position:21% line:83% align:start
-At this point
-(Takemichi gasping)

00:16:28.556 --> 00:16:31.225 position:13% line:83% align:start
we've all known each other
for quite a long time.

00:16:31.258 --> 00:16:32.392 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:16:32.426 --> 00:16:33.327 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.896 position:19% line:83% align:start
I never thought
everyone from back then

00:16:34.929 --> 00:16:36.764 position:21% line:83% align:start
would still be alive
and kicking today,

00:16:36.798 --> 00:16:38.700 position:13% line:89% align:start
much less be here with us.

00:16:38.733 --> 00:16:41.134 position:13% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi grunting warily)

00:16:41.168 --> 00:16:42.804 position:7% line:89% align:start
Are you surprised to hear that?

00:16:42.837 --> 00:16:45.138 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Uh, no, not really.

00:16:47.575 --> 00:16:49.309 position:24% line:89% align:start
Takemichi, Chifuyu.

00:16:50.512 --> 00:16:51.478 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Huh?

00:16:51.513 --> 00:16:53.013 position:33% line:89% align:start
Tell me this.

00:16:53.046 --> 00:16:54.448 position:30% line:89% align:start
Tell the truth.

00:16:54.481 --> 00:16:55.482 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Huh?

00:16:56.851 --> 00:16:58.553 position:30% line:89% align:start
Do you hate me?

00:16:58.586 --> 00:17:01.388 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasping)

00:17:02.557 --> 00:17:06.493 position:19% line:5% align:start
It was about this time,
only 12 long years ago,

00:17:06.528 --> 00:17:07.529 position:30% line:89% align:start
when Baji died.

00:17:07.562 --> 00:17:09.797 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Chifuyu grunting)

00:17:09.831 --> 00:17:11.900 position:7% line:89% align:start
The blame for that is all mine.

00:17:11.933 --> 00:17:14.167 position:13% line:5% align:start
(both grunting in surprise)

00:17:14.201 --> 00:17:16.638 position:13% line:5% align:start
I'm the one who planned the
Bloody Halloween battle.

00:17:16.671 --> 00:17:17.805 position:5% line:5% align:start
(Takemichi grunting in surprise)

00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:19.273 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] I already knew that,

00:17:19.306 --> 00:17:22.510 position:19% line:83% align:start
but why would he admit
it and say it out loud?

00:17:24.044 --> 00:17:27.180 position:13% line:83% align:start
I used Hanma to sweet-talk
Kazutora Hanemiya

00:17:27.949 --> 00:17:30.050 position:10% line:89% align:start
and then I created Valhalla,

00:17:31.019 --> 00:17:33.320 position:19% line:83% align:start
and then I set them up
to clash with Toman.

00:17:34.522 --> 00:17:36.456 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Chifuyu] But why
would you do that?

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:40.394 position:19% line:89% align:start
Because I wanted power!

00:17:41.428 --> 00:17:43.263 position:16% line:5% align:start
I wanted to be
respected for something.

00:17:44.364 --> 00:17:46.233 position:24% line:5% align:start
And I thought if I
stopped the fight,

00:17:46.266 --> 00:17:48.235 position:24% line:5% align:start
then everyone would
bow down to me.

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:50.872 position:27% line:89% align:start
I was desperate.

00:17:50.905 --> 00:17:53.440 position:24% line:83% align:start
I didn't think Baji
was going to die!

00:17:53.473 --> 00:17:54.241 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Chifuyu gasping)

00:17:54.274 --> 00:17:55.543 position:21% line:5% align:start
I'm serious, Chifuyu!

00:17:56.611 --> 00:17:57.579 position:21% line:5% align:start
(Takemichi grunting)

00:17:57.612 --> 00:17:59.747 position:30% line:5% align:start
(somber music)

00:17:59.781 --> 00:18:00.782 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry.

00:18:02.115 --> 00:18:04.251 position:24% line:83% align:start
I've wanted to say
that for so long.

00:18:05.118 --> 00:18:07.454 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's our friends
who are important.

00:18:07.487 --> 00:18:10.190 position:24% line:83% align:start
After 12 years, I
finally understand.

00:18:11.059 --> 00:18:12.827 position:10% line:5% align:start
So you regret what happened?

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:14.328 position:10% line:5% align:start
All the things you did then?

00:18:16.698 --> 00:18:19.033 position:21% line:83% align:start
Not a single day
goes by that I don't.

00:18:19.067 --> 00:18:21.335 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi grunting)

00:18:21.368 --> 00:18:24.237 position:13% line:5% align:start
You can continue to hate
me, of course, if you must,

00:18:25.405 --> 00:18:27.575 position:24% line:5% align:start
but at least have a
drink with me today.

00:18:28.241 --> 00:18:29.376 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Chifuyu] All right.

00:18:32.714 --> 00:18:34.849 position:19% line:5% align:start
Here's a toast to Baji.

00:18:36.584 --> 00:18:38.218 position:30% line:89% align:start
(all slurping)

00:18:38.251 --> 00:18:39.520 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi And Chifuyu] Ah.

00:18:39.554 --> 00:18:42.056 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hey, uh, can I
have beer instead?

00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:43.758 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm not used to the
expensive stuff.

00:18:43.791 --> 00:18:44.726 position:21% line:89% align:start
(chuckling) Hey hey,

00:18:44.759 --> 00:18:47.528 position:16% line:83% align:start
we can't have Toman
execs talking like that!

00:18:47.562 --> 00:18:48.362 position:35% line:89% align:start
Guess not.

00:18:49.764 --> 00:18:50.999 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi coughing)

00:18:51.032 --> 00:18:52.232 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Kisaki laughing)

00:18:52.265 --> 00:18:54.569 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Chifuyu] Don't force yourself.

00:18:54.602 --> 00:18:56.838 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] I can't
believe this is happening.

00:18:56.871 --> 00:18:59.107 position:13% line:89% align:start
You know, maybe this future

00:18:59.139 --> 00:19:00.875 position:24% line:83% align:start
is actually pretty
awesome after all.

00:19:04.311 --> 00:19:07.882 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Kisaki] (sighing) I haven't
had this much fun in a while.

00:19:07.915 --> 00:19:09.249 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Yeah, same here.

00:19:09.282 --> 00:19:11.151 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Kisaki] Can I say
just one more thing?

00:19:11.184 --> 00:19:12.185 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Hm?

00:19:13.186 --> 00:19:15.123 position:24% line:83% align:start
When I said earlier
that I didn't think

00:19:15.155 --> 00:19:17.190 position:27% line:83% align:start
Baji was going to
die that day...

00:19:18.993 --> 00:19:21.796 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yeah, well, I lied.

00:19:21.829 --> 00:19:22.997 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:19:23.031 --> 00:19:24.132 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:19:24.164 --> 00:19:26.199 position:7% line:89% align:start
I used Kazutora's insane anger

00:19:26.233 --> 00:19:28.368 position:10% line:89% align:start
to get Baji killed that day.

00:19:28.402 --> 00:19:32.006 position:19% line:83% align:start
And now I'm about to
finish what I started.

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.641 position:21% line:83% align:start
-(Takemichi gasping)
-(suspenseful music)

00:19:33.675 --> 00:19:35.342 position:41% line:89% align:start
Oh no!

00:19:35.375 --> 00:19:38.046 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi crashing)

00:19:38.079 --> 00:19:40.548 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasping)

00:19:40.581 --> 00:19:42.116 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:44.952 position:13% line:89% align:start
Oh that's right, this is...

00:19:44.986 --> 00:19:46.420 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hey, I can't move!

00:19:47.588 --> 00:19:50.091 position:24% line:83% align:start
(groaning) What the
hell's going on?

00:19:50.124 --> 00:19:52.259 position:24% line:83% align:start
(grunting) What am
I doing tied up?

00:19:52.292 --> 00:19:53.628 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Takemitchy.
-Hm?

00:19:53.661 --> 00:19:54.428 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Chifuyu?

00:19:54.461 --> 00:19:55.897 position:7% line:89% align:start
What the hell happened to you?

00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:57.799 position:7% line:89% align:start
Looks like you had a good nap.

00:19:57.832 --> 00:19:59.433 position:30% line:89% align:start
(both grunting)

00:19:59.466 --> 00:20:00.768 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hanagaki.

00:20:00.802 --> 00:20:01.602 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Kisaki!

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:03.671 position:30% line:89% align:start
You drugged us!

00:20:04.806 --> 00:20:06.273 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi grunting)

00:20:06.306 --> 00:20:10.343 position:13% line:83% align:start
Chifuyu Matsuno, you sure
are an annoying little fly.

00:20:10.377 --> 00:20:12.412 position:10% line:83% align:start
You just couldn't forget
about something that happened

00:20:12.446 --> 00:20:16.184 position:19% line:83% align:start
12 years ago and you
kept trying to bite me.

00:20:16.216 --> 00:20:18.786 position:19% line:83% align:start
You had to get
revenge for Baji, huh?

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:20.188 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Huh?

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:21.055 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(blow thudding)
-(Chifuyu grunting)

00:20:21.089 --> 00:20:22.590 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Stop it, Kisaki!

00:20:22.623 --> 00:20:25.258 position:7% line:89% align:start
Why not admit that it was you?

00:20:25.292 --> 00:20:27.995 position:19% line:83% align:start
The two of you together
are Judas, aren't you?

00:20:28.029 --> 00:20:29.329 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-(blow thudding)

00:20:29.362 --> 00:20:31.766 position:13% line:83% align:start
Seriously, you sure did
tell the cops a lotta shit,

00:20:31.799 --> 00:20:33.668 position:13% line:83% align:start
-you stupid dumbass!
-Stop it, Kisaki, damn you!

00:20:33.701 --> 00:20:37.370 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Stop it!
-(Chifuyu coughing)

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:40.240 position:33% line:89% align:start
You're wrong!

00:20:40.273 --> 00:20:42.744 position:24% line:83% align:start
The cops got all
that on their own!

00:20:42.777 --> 00:20:44.411 position:27% line:89% align:start
All I ever wanted

00:20:44.444 --> 00:20:46.948 position:19% line:83% align:start
was to run you out of
Toman once and for all!

00:20:47.782 --> 00:20:49.517 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Kisaki sighing)

00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:52.352 position:13% line:83% align:start
How long are you gonna keep
chasing after Baji's shadow,

00:20:52.385 --> 00:20:54.088 position:19% line:89% align:start
you sorry little shit?

00:20:54.122 --> 00:20:56.958 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Chifuyu panting)

00:20:56.991 --> 00:20:58.760 position:16% line:89% align:start
Toman's rotten right now,

00:20:58.793 --> 00:21:00.728 position:21% line:83% align:start
and I'm the one who's
gonna change it!

00:21:01.896 --> 00:21:05.066 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're right about one
thing, I am the Judas.

00:21:05.099 --> 00:21:06.934 position:19% line:89% align:start
Takemitchy didn't know.

00:21:06.968 --> 00:21:09.971 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] Oh, Chifuyu,
don't tell me 12 years later

00:21:10.004 --> 00:21:11.304 position:7% line:89% align:start
you were still trying to avenge

00:21:11.338 --> 00:21:13.440 position:10% line:89% align:start
Baji's death all by yourself?

00:21:14.242 --> 00:21:15.442 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey!

00:21:16.177 --> 00:21:18.546 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm the one who gets to decide

00:21:18.579 --> 00:21:20.848 position:16% line:83% align:start
whether he's been
involved in this or not.

00:21:20.882 --> 00:21:22.382 position:16% line:89% align:start
(tense suspenseful music)

00:21:22.415 --> 00:21:25.253 position:5% line:89% align:start
So, Hanagaki, why are you acting

00:21:25.285 --> 00:21:28.156 position:19% line:83% align:start
like you've got no idea
what's going on here?

00:21:28.189 --> 00:21:29.557 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Huh?

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:30.357 position:44% line:89% align:start
Well?

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:31.491 position:27% line:89% align:start
(gunshot booming)

00:21:31.526 --> 00:21:33.393 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi screaming)

00:21:33.426 --> 00:21:35.163 position:16% line:89% align:start
You bastard, I told you,

00:21:35.196 --> 00:21:36.664 position:19% line:83% align:start
Takemitchy has nothing
to do with this!

00:21:36.697 --> 00:21:37.965 position:13% line:83% align:start
-He doesn't know anything!
-My leg!

00:21:37.999 --> 00:21:39.167 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh, shut your mouth!

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.234 position:21% line:83% align:start
You two are
partners, aren't you?

00:21:40.268 --> 00:21:41.235 position:19% line:89% align:start
You shared everything!

00:21:41.269 --> 00:21:43.971 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi screaming)

00:21:44.005 --> 00:21:45.072 position:27% line:89% align:start
You're a lunatic.

00:21:45.106 --> 00:21:48.576 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi screaming)

00:21:48.609 --> 00:21:51.478 position:7% line:89% align:start
So, got any last words to say?

00:21:51.512 --> 00:21:54.816 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi screaming)

00:21:54.849 --> 00:21:56.083 position:35% line:89% align:start
Takemitchy.

00:21:56.117 --> 00:21:59.754 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi screaming)

00:21:59.787 --> 00:22:00.955 position:35% line:89% align:start
Takemichi!

00:22:00.988 --> 00:22:03.356 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi panting)

00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:08.296 position:13% line:83% align:start
Listen, Takemitchy, because
these are my last words.

00:22:08.328 --> 00:22:10.765 position:21% line:83% align:start
A lot has happened
these past 12 years.

00:22:10.798 --> 00:22:12.533 position:27% line:89% align:start
Mikey disappeared

00:22:12.567 --> 00:22:15.368 position:16% line:89% align:start
and Draken was executed.

00:22:15.402 --> 00:22:17.271 position:21% line:83% align:start
Before we knew it,
we'd gotten ourselves

00:22:17.305 --> 00:22:19.339 position:5% line:89% align:start
involved in some messed-up shit.

00:22:20.575 --> 00:22:23.611 position:10% line:83% align:start
And all of us made our share
of some serious mistakes,

00:22:23.644 --> 00:22:27.215 position:13% line:83% align:start
but still, down deep I know
that we haven't changed!

00:22:27.248 --> 00:22:28.883 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasping)

00:22:28.916 --> 00:22:32.253 position:21% line:83% align:start
So now Baji's legacy,
and Toman's as well,

00:22:32.286 --> 00:22:34.222 position:30% line:89% align:start
(somber music)

00:22:34.255 --> 00:22:35.455 position:33% line:89% align:start
they're both

00:22:37.091 --> 00:22:39.359 position:19% line:89% align:start
in your hands partner.

00:22:40.328 --> 00:22:42.196 position:21% line:83% align:start

Chifuyu!

(Takemichi sobbing)

00:22:49.704 --> 00:22:50.872 position:41% line:89% align:start
No way!

00:22:50.905 --> 00:22:53.541 position:24% line:83% align:start
This has to be some
kind of nightmare!

00:22:53.574 --> 00:22:56.310 position:19% line:83% align:start
There's no way
Chifuyu could be dead!

00:22:56.344 --> 00:22:58.145 position:30% line:89% align:start
Just like that?

00:22:58.179 --> 00:23:00.248 position:27% line:83% align:start
So how's it feel
to have the fate

00:23:00.281 --> 00:23:02.482 position:19% line:83% align:start
of all of Toman
resting in your hands?

(suspenseful music)

00:23:04.018 --> 00:23:07.955 position:10% line:83% align:start
Don't worry, you're gonna be
following him soon enough.

(Kisaki growling)

00:23:15.196 --> 00:23:16.998 position:16% line:89% align:start
What in the hell are you?

00:23:17.031 --> 00:23:20.301 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasping)

00:23:20.334 --> 00:23:22.637 position:24% line:83% align:start
Is that really all
you've got, huh?

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:26.507 position:10% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi breathing shakily)

00:23:31.012 --> 00:23:32.179 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's too bad.

00:23:32.213 --> 00:23:35.883 position:13% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi panting angrily)

00:23:38.219 --> 00:23:39.419 position:38% line:89% align:start
How sad.

00:23:40.288 --> 00:23:41.923 position:38% line:89% align:start
Farewell,

00:23:41.956 --> 00:23:42.957 position:44% line:89% align:start
hero.
