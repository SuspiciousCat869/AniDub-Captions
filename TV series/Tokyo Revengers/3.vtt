Huh? Takemitchy?

That's what Mikey
just said, Takemitchy.

Don't you question him.

(Takemichi gasps)

00:08:14.996 --> 00:08:17.932 position:21% line:83% align:start
So you, you're really
in middle school?

00:08:17.965 --> 00:08:19.533 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Yeah.

00:08:20.868 --> 00:08:24.505 position:13% line:83% align:start
Takemitchy, starting
today, we're friends, yeah?

Huh?

00:08:31.712 --> 00:08:33.814 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Mikey] Are you the one
running these matches?

Uh, yes.

[Mikey] Takemitchy.

00:09:11.852 --> 00:09:12.820 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?!

00:09:12.853 --> 00:09:13.654 position:38% line:89% align:start
See you.

[Takemichi Voiceover]
I can't believe

00:09:28.335 --> 00:09:31.172 position:24% line:83% align:start
I met Toman's
boss, Manjiro Sano!

00:09:31.205 --> 00:09:32.273 position:35% line:89% align:start
[Both] Mmm!

(Takemichi gasps)

00:09:33.374 --> 00:09:35.544 position:7% line:89% align:start
You were so awesome, Takemichi!

00:09:35.576 --> 00:09:37.912 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yeah, that was the most
amazing thing ever!

00:09:37.945 --> 00:09:38.913 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:09:38.946 --> 00:09:40.414 position:24% line:83% align:start
The invincible
Mikey just told you

00:09:40.448 --> 00:09:41.882 position:19% line:89% align:start
you were his new buddy!

00:09:41.916 --> 00:09:43.851 position:27% line:83% align:start
Don't you get how
amazing that is?!

00:09:43.884 --> 00:09:46.620 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi Voiceover] I
guess I wasn't imagining it.

00:09:46.654 --> 00:09:50.391 position:13% line:83% align:start
Agh! I just became friends
with a total monster!

00:09:50.424 --> 00:09:51.859 position:33% line:89% align:start
Lick the poo.

00:09:51.892 --> 00:09:53.562 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi Voiceover] I went
from being Kiyamasa's slave

00:09:53.594 --> 00:09:55.530 position:13% line:83% align:start
to being the latest
plaything of some eccentric

00:09:55.564 --> 00:09:57.598 position:16% line:89% align:start
and powerful gang leader!

00:09:58.799 --> 00:10:00.701 position:13% line:89% align:start
This is an even worse hell!

00:10:00.734 --> 00:10:02.803 position:10% line:89% align:start
Why is this happening to me?!

00:10:04.071 --> 00:10:06.774 position:19% line:83% align:start
So I guess you're
Takemitchy from now on.

00:10:06.807 --> 00:10:08.275 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yeah, that's what the
head guy called you,

00:10:08.309 --> 00:10:10.411 position:7% line:89% align:start
so I guess you are Takemitchy.

(both snickering)

00:10:11.846 --> 00:10:14.081 position:10% line:83% align:start

must be nice to be so stupid.

00:10:15.282 --> 00:10:16.650 position:19% line:89% align:start
Just ignore those two.

00:10:17.485 --> 00:10:18.553 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's nice, though.

00:10:18.587 --> 00:10:20.287 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hm, what?

00:10:21.455 --> 00:10:24.325 position:27% line:83% align:start
Like, those two
just bein' goofy?

00:10:24.358 --> 00:10:26.260 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's good to
hear that again.

00:10:26.293 --> 00:10:27.461 position:19% line:89% align:start
Plus, how about the way

00:10:27.495 --> 00:10:30.030 position:10% line:83% align:start
his second-in-command smacked
down Akaishi, like a boss!

00:10:30.064 --> 00:10:31.465 position:27% line:83% align:start
-That was sweet!
-I know, right?

00:10:31.499 --> 00:10:32.833 position:35% line:89% align:start
Takemichi.

00:10:32.867 --> 00:10:33.868 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

[Takuya] Man, that was awesome!

00:10:37.671 --> 00:10:40.007 position:21% line:83% align:start
I was on the verge of
stabbing Kiyomasa.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:40.841 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:10:40.875 --> 00:10:42.243 position:21% line:89% align:start
Just think about it.

00:10:42.276 --> 00:10:45.079 position:5% line:83% align:start
At the rate we're going, we
would have been slaves forever.

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.015 position:10% line:89% align:start
Unless we took Kiyomasa out.

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:51.018 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi Voiceover] Akkun!

00:10:51.051 --> 00:10:53.220 position:16% line:83% align:start
He always did care
about his friends a lot.

00:10:54.355 --> 00:10:56.190 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Akkun] We owe you, Takemichi.

00:10:56.223 --> 00:10:57.725 position:44% line:89% align:start
Why?

00:10:57.758 --> 00:10:59.226 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well, because, thanks
to you toughing out

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:00.694 position:21% line:89% align:start
that fight with him,

be slaves anymore.

You were awesome, dude.

Man, having to go to
school right now is harsh.

You're actually headed
to school on time today!

I have to go to cram

Oh, yeah?

00:11:45.072 --> 00:11:46.874 position:27% line:83% align:start
You wanna have a
date before that?

00:11:46.907 --> 00:11:50.978 position:7% line:83% align:start
Well, sure. But can you really
call that a date, though?

00:11:51.011 --> 00:11:53.648 position:13% line:83% align:start
Sure, even going to school
together is sort of a date.

00:11:53.682 --> 00:11:57.552 position:16% line:83% align:start
Oh, man, but I sure do
wish that you and I were

[Teacher] This part's important,

it down, and remember it.

Prevent those two from meeting.

who died just because she
got caught up in that mess,

I need to stop the strife
within the Tokyo Manji Gang.

00:12:36.924 --> 00:12:38.325 position:16% line:89% align:start
And to make that happen,

00:12:48.369 --> 00:12:50.337 position:19% line:83% align:start
But I have no idea what
the hell I'm supposed

to do from here!

the head of that evil Toman

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:14.321 position:24% line:89% align:start
really be this guy?

00:19:16.057 --> 00:19:18.026 position:35% line:89% align:start
So, Mikey?

00:19:18.059 --> 00:19:19.027 position:35% line:89% align:start
[Mikey] Mm?

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:21.428 position:19% line:89% align:start
I was, I was wondering

00:19:21.461 --> 00:19:23.931 position:21% line:83% align:start
what made you think
we oughta be friends.

00:19:23.965 --> 00:19:25.232 position:7% line:89% align:start
Well, that's a stupid question.

00:19:25.265 --> 00:19:27.635 position:21% line:89% align:start
Ah! Yeah, I'm sorry.

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:34.241 position:19% line:83% align:start
Truth is, you remind
me of my older brother.

He's dead now.

(gasps)

00:19:39.047 --> 00:19:41.849 position:16% line:89% align:start
He was totally reckless,

00:19:41.883 --> 00:19:43.316 position:10% line:89% align:start
fearless about picking fights

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:46.554 position:19% line:83% align:start
with guys that were way
stronger than he was.

00:19:46.587 --> 00:19:48.122 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, I see.

00:19:48.156 --> 00:19:50.124 position:10% line:89% align:start
He must've been pretty cool.

00:19:50.158 --> 00:19:52.459 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yeah, Takemitchy, he
was a lot like you.

00:19:52.492 --> 00:19:55.997 position:16% line:83% align:start
Huh?! But I'm really not
even that into fighting!

00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:57.532 position:13% line:89% align:start
How do you figure I'm cool?

00:19:57.565 --> 00:20:00.500 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Mikey] Yeah, you're right,
you're actually pretty lame.

00:20:00.535 --> 00:20:02.202 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] Well, you don't
have to be mean about it.

Nowadays, people just think
delinquents are all lame.

[Takemichi Voiceover] Huh!

00:20:11.779 --> 00:20:14.414 position:13% line:83% align:start
I guess even he kinda cares
what people think of him.

00:20:16.249 --> 00:20:18.152 position:21% line:83% align:start
Back when my big
bro was still alive,

00:20:18.186 --> 00:20:20.420 position:16% line:83% align:start
there were so many
biker gangs around here.

00:20:22.355 --> 00:20:25.258 position:10% line:83% align:start
You always heard their
super-loud bikes blowing by.

00:20:28.062 --> 00:20:30.363 position:10% line:89% align:start
Now those guys were bad-ass.

00:20:30.397 --> 00:20:32.232 position:16% line:89% align:start
They fought all the time,

00:20:32.265 --> 00:20:34.769 position:19% line:83% align:start
but they always cleaned
up their own messes.

00:20:36.369 --> 00:20:38.506 position:24% line:83% align:start
I don't see what's
so lame about that.

00:20:46.214 --> 00:20:49.684 position:16% line:83% align:start
So I'm gonna create a
new era for delinquents.

00:20:51.819 --> 00:20:52.987 position:24% line:89% align:start
You oughta join me.

00:20:58.126 --> 00:21:01.829 position:7% line:89% align:start
I like you, Takemichi Hanagaki.

(gasps)

00:21:03.965 --> 00:21:05.332 position:13% line:89% align:start
There's no shortage of guys

00:21:05.365 --> 00:21:07.535 position:24% line:83% align:start
who are good at
fighting out there.

00:21:07.568 --> 00:21:10.772 position:24% line:83% align:start
But guys who'll
stand up to anyone

00:21:10.805 --> 00:21:12.740 position:24% line:83% align:start
for something they
really believe in?

00:21:13.975 --> 00:21:16.343 position:21% line:83% align:start
There aren't too many
guys around like that.

Mikey may be a delinquent,

00:21:34.996 --> 00:21:37.397 position:19% line:89% align:start
but he's not a bad guy.

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:40.134 position:16% line:83% align:start
At least, not the kind of
guy who'd crash a truck

00:21:46.574 --> 00:21:49.544 position:19% line:83% align:start

not their leader.

changed Mikey so much?
