00:00:08.843 --> 00:00:11.111 position:13% line:89% align:start
Damn it, you two assholes!

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:14.181 position:13% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi panting angrily)

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:17.384 position:19% line:83% align:start
Quit acting like you're
a couple of dumb punks!

00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:18.953 position:35% line:89% align:start
[Both] Huh?

00:00:18.987 --> 00:00:20.855 position:24% line:83% align:start
Is he actually
trying to stop 'em?

00:00:20.889 --> 00:00:22.991 position:13% line:89% align:start
Does he have a death wish?

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:24.726 position:24% line:83% align:start
Just look what you
bastards have done

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:26.661 position:10% line:89% align:start
to all my precious memories!

00:00:26.694 --> 00:00:27.962 position:13% line:89% align:start
(Akkun and Takuya gasping)

00:00:27.996 --> 00:00:29.697 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Makoto And Kazushi]
Nice knowin' ya!

00:00:29.731 --> 00:00:30.999 position:21% line:89% align:start
Farewell, Takemichi!

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:33.635 position:21% line:83% align:start
Ah, you selfish jerks
have just destroyed

00:00:33.668 --> 00:00:36.704 position:16% line:83% align:start
everything I ever loved
from my entire childhood!

00:00:36.738 --> 00:00:41.809 position:10% line:83% align:start
-(singer singing in Japanese)
-(opening theme music)

00:02:06.761 --> 00:02:08.128 position:21% line:5% align:start
(Takemichi growling)

00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:09.797 position:35% line:5% align:start
[Both] Huh?

00:02:09.831 --> 00:02:12.667 position:24% line:5% align:start
(tense rock music)

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.434 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Mikey] Wha?

00:02:14.468 --> 00:02:15.837 position:13% line:89% align:start
What are you talking about?

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.071 position:10% line:89% align:start
Are you freaking kidding me?

00:02:17.105 --> 00:02:18.640 position:10% line:89% align:start
All my stuff you just broke!

00:02:18.673 --> 00:02:19.641 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi grunting)

00:02:19.674 --> 00:02:20.942 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi yelping)

00:02:20.975 --> 00:02:22.142 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi crashing)

00:02:22.175 --> 00:02:25.113 position:21% line:83% align:start
-(Takemichi groaning)
-(trash clattering)

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:27.147 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Mikey] You okay in
there, Takemitchy?

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:29.249 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi growling)

00:02:29.282 --> 00:02:32.285 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi yelling)

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.155 position:13% line:83% align:start
Neither one of you gives a
rat's ass about me, do ya?

00:02:35.188 --> 00:02:36.824 position:7% line:89% align:start
Hey, just calm down now, dude.

00:02:36.858 --> 00:02:38.158 position:7% line:89% align:start
You're tellin' me to calm down?

00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:39.694 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're the ones
who just went crazy

00:02:39.727 --> 00:02:40.895 position:16% line:89% align:start
smashing all of my stuff!

00:02:40.928 --> 00:02:42.063 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Akkun] Hey, whoa!

00:02:42.096 --> 00:02:43.330 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Chill out, Takemichi!
-Cool it, man!

00:02:43.363 --> 00:02:45.265 position:19% line:83% align:start
Do you have some sorta
death wish, dude?

00:02:45.298 --> 00:02:47.167 position:21% line:83% align:start
(grunting) Let me go,
Akkun, let me at him!

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.402 position:27% line:83% align:start
You don't give a
shit what happens

00:02:48.435 --> 00:02:50.071 position:13% line:89% align:start
to those around you, do ya?

00:02:50.104 --> 00:02:51.706 position:19% line:89% align:start
Hey, we're sorry, man.

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.374 position:10% line:83% align:start
We didn't mean to disrespect
you or anything like that.

00:02:54.408 --> 00:02:56.343 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] You don't
even know I exist, do you?

00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:57.344 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Akkun] Takemichi, stop!

00:02:57.377 --> 00:02:58.746 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi panting)

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.117 position:5% line:83% align:start
You just don't care, and that's
why the two of you fight.

00:03:03.151 --> 00:03:04.752 position:21% line:83% align:start
-(Takemichi sighing)
-Whoa, Takemichi.

00:03:04.786 --> 00:03:07.522 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi sobbing)

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.262 position:16% line:83% align:start
You don't realize,
neither of you realizes,

00:03:15.295 --> 00:03:17.165 position:21% line:83% align:start
how much trouble
the two of you cause

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:19.133 position:21% line:83% align:start
for the people around
you when you fight!

00:03:19.167 --> 00:03:20.668 position:27% line:89% align:start
Don't you get it?

00:03:20.702 --> 00:03:23.037 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi sobbing)

00:03:23.071 --> 00:03:24.539 position:24% line:83% align:start
Don't you realize
that all the people

00:03:24.572 --> 00:03:27.307 position:16% line:83% align:start
who follow and look up to
you end up fighting too?

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.178 position:24% line:83% align:start
So this isn't just
your problem alone!

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.412 position:16% line:83% align:start
And now if you're gonna
go and split Toman apart,

00:03:33.514 --> 00:03:35.883 position:16% line:83% align:start
well, then that's just
too much for me to take!

00:03:35.917 --> 00:03:37.652 position:13% line:89% align:start
I don't want it to happen!

00:03:37.685 --> 00:03:39.954 position:16% line:83% align:start
(sniffling) And I can't
stand to watch it either!

00:03:39.987 --> 00:03:41.455 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi sobbing)

00:03:41.488 --> 00:03:43.725 position:27% line:83% align:start
You guys are just
so cool, and...

00:03:43.758 --> 00:03:48.629 position:21% line:83% align:start
-(Takemichi sobbing)
-(somber music)

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.632 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Mikey] Takemitchy?

00:03:51.666 --> 00:03:55.069 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] Whatever,
just go away!

00:03:55.103 --> 00:03:56.269 position:38% line:89% align:start
We'll go.

00:03:56.303 --> 00:03:59.173 position:16% line:83% align:start
But you should know
that through all of this

00:03:59.207 --> 00:04:00.942 position:24% line:83% align:start
you've had a dog
turd in your hair.

00:04:01.843 --> 00:04:02.810 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:04:02.844 --> 00:04:06.080 position:27% line:89% align:start
(playful chiming)

00:04:06.114 --> 00:04:09.050 position:5% line:89% align:start
(yelping) Get it off! (groaning)

00:04:09.083 --> 00:04:10.885 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Draken] That's totally
gross, Takemitchy! (laughing)

00:04:10.918 --> 00:04:13.554 position:13% line:83% align:start
Ugh, why didn't one of you
guys tell me that sooner?

00:04:13.588 --> 00:04:14.956 position:19% line:83% align:start
-[Mikey] How could we?
-(group laughing)

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:16.891 position:27% line:83% align:start
You were being so
damned serious!

00:04:16.924 --> 00:04:18.391 position:7% line:89% align:start
Well, duh, I was being serious

00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:19.560 position:21% line:83% align:start
'cause of this fight
between you guys!

00:04:19.594 --> 00:04:20.962 position:10% line:83% align:start
-The shit's coming after us!
-Huh?

00:04:20.995 --> 00:04:22.063 position:21% line:89% align:start
We better run, Kenny!

00:04:22.096 --> 00:04:23.430 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Yeah, and it reeks!

00:04:23.463 --> 00:04:27.735 position:10% line:83% align:start
-(Mikey and Draken laughing)
-(Takemichi gasping)

00:04:27.769 --> 00:04:30.772 position:24% line:83% align:start
Wait, now those two
are friends again?

00:04:30.805 --> 00:04:32.707 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi sniffing)

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.375 position:16% line:83% align:start
They were right though,
my head really does reek!

00:04:35.408 --> 00:04:38.012 position:21% line:83% align:start
That's cool with you
guys though, right?

00:04:38.045 --> 00:04:39.346 position:35% line:89% align:start
[All] Huh?

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:41.281 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Takuya] (laughing) Don't
let the stink get us!

00:04:41.314 --> 00:04:42.482 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Makoto] Run from that shit!

00:04:42.517 --> 00:04:43.684 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Oh, very funny!
-It stinks so bad!

00:04:43.718 --> 00:04:45.887 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] Come
back here, damn it!

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.354 position:16% line:89% align:start
(sighing) You guys suck!

00:04:50.191 --> 00:04:51.926 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Draken] Man, that
was hilarious.

00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:54.327 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Mikey] Yeah, I haven't
laughed like that in a while.

00:04:54.361 --> 00:04:57.397 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Draken] You really
friggin' reeked, Takemitchy.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.399 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] Come on, I
washed my hair, okay?

00:04:59.432 --> 00:05:01.202 position:10% line:83% align:start
-(Akkun and Takuya grunting)
-(ball thudding)

00:05:01.235 --> 00:05:02.469 position:13% line:89% align:start
(Akkun and Takuya laughing)

00:05:02.503 --> 00:05:04.371 position:24% line:83% align:start
And I was wrong
back there, Mikey.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:08.810 position:10% line:89% align:start
Nah, it was me who was wrong.

00:05:09.977 --> 00:05:12.647 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why were you guys even fighting
in the first place though?

00:05:14.215 --> 00:05:15.249 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Draken And Mikey]
Can't remember.

00:05:15.283 --> 00:05:16.984 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi chuckling)

00:05:17.018 --> 00:05:19.486 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Mikey grunting)

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.622 position:21% line:83% align:start
But I think Kenny
was right that night.

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:24.992 position:24% line:83% align:start
Pah saved us all by
doing what he did.

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.865 position:44% line:89% align:start
I'll

00:05:30.898 --> 00:05:32.432 position:27% line:89% align:start
go with the cops.

00:05:32.465 --> 00:05:33.935 position:30% line:89% align:start
(somber music)

00:05:33.968 --> 00:05:36.671 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] Mikey didn't want
Pah to pay for what he did,

00:05:36.704 --> 00:05:38.906 position:21% line:83% align:start
even though Mikey
knew Pah was guilty.

00:05:40.107 --> 00:05:41.909 position:27% line:83% align:start
Mikey wanted to
help Pah get away

00:05:41.943 --> 00:05:43.845 position:16% line:89% align:start
because he's his friend,

00:05:43.878 --> 00:05:46.914 position:21% line:83% align:start
but Draken wanted to
honor Pah's resolve.

00:05:46.948 --> 00:05:50.383 position:10% line:83% align:start
They both took positions
they couldn't back down from.

00:05:50.417 --> 00:05:52.720 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's probably why
they started fighting.

00:05:52.753 --> 00:05:53.554 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm.

00:05:55.556 --> 00:05:56.724 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Mikey] When Pah gets out

00:05:56.757 --> 00:05:58.926 position:21% line:83% align:start
we are gonna have
one hell of a party!

00:06:00.294 --> 00:06:01.494 position:30% line:89% align:start
(feet stomping)

00:06:01.963 --> 00:06:02.964 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Mikey chuckling)

00:06:03.965 --> 00:06:04.966 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Draken] Huh?

00:06:05.967 --> 00:06:06.701 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Draken grunting)

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.009 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi chuckling)

00:06:15.042 --> 00:06:16.177 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Mikey] I wanna play too!

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:17.712 position:30% line:89% align:start
Are you joking?

00:06:17.745 --> 00:06:18.546 position:44% line:89% align:start
Whoa!

00:06:18.579 --> 00:06:19.547 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Draken chuckling)

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.148 position:13% line:89% align:start
(Akkun and Takuya laughing)

00:06:21.182 --> 00:06:23.217 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Whoa!

00:06:23.251 --> 00:06:25.853 position:13% line:89% align:start
Toman's just so damn cool!

00:06:25.887 --> 00:06:27.355 position:35% line:89% align:start
Takemichi!

00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:29.523 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're amazing, dude,
you did it! (laughing)

00:06:29.557 --> 00:06:32.593 position:16% line:83% align:start
You actually got those
two badasses to make up!

00:06:32.627 --> 00:06:34.494 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Kazushi] That's some insane
mind-control shit there!

00:06:34.528 --> 00:06:36.764 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi laughing)

00:06:36.797 --> 00:06:38.132 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Oh!

00:06:38.165 --> 00:06:39.634 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's true though.

00:06:39.667 --> 00:06:42.336 position:19% line:83% align:start
Since Mikey and Draken
are friends again,

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.772 position:19% line:83% align:start
the big conflict isn't
gonna happen now!

00:06:44.805 --> 00:06:47.141 position:24% line:83% align:start
Draken's not gonna
die on August 3rd!

00:06:48.276 --> 00:06:50.477 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi thudding)

00:06:50.511 --> 00:06:52.280 position:24% line:89% align:start
I changed history!

00:06:52.313 --> 00:06:53.614 position:24% line:83% align:start
(Takemichi gasping
in wonderment)

00:06:53.648 --> 00:06:55.816 position:13% line:89% align:start
My mission was successful!

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:57.184 position:27% line:89% align:start
I did it, Naoto!

00:06:59.287 --> 00:07:00.821 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Hinata] Hi, Takemichi!

00:07:00.855 --> 00:07:01.656 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:07:02.657 --> 00:07:03.925 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hina?

00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.693 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I'm here too!

00:07:06.928 --> 00:07:07.728 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hey, what's up?

00:07:08.996 --> 00:07:09.764 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Uh, um-
-Go on!

00:07:09.797 --> 00:07:11.899 position:10% line:89% align:start
Don't be a chicken, ask him!

00:07:13.067 --> 00:07:15.937 position:19% line:83% align:start
Would you by any chance
be free on August 3rd?

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:17.437 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Huh?

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:18.706 position:19% line:89% align:start
Sorry to ask, but, huh-

00:07:18.739 --> 00:07:20.408 position:13% line:89% align:start
She wants to ask you to go

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.909 position:21% line:83% align:start
to the festival with
her, Takemitchy!

00:07:22.977 --> 00:07:23.978 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uh...

00:07:25.413 --> 00:07:27.248 position:19% line:89% align:start
(grunting) Yeah, sure!

00:07:27.281 --> 00:07:28.416 position:27% line:83% align:start
-(Hinata gasping)
-(gentle music)

00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:31.052 position:16% line:83% align:start
See, I told you he was
gonna wanna go with you!

00:07:31.085 --> 00:07:32.720 position:13% line:89% align:start
The dude's your boyfriend!

00:07:32.753 --> 00:07:36.757 position:7% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi and Hinata laughing)

00:07:36.791 --> 00:07:37.792 position:41% line:89% align:start
No way!

00:07:37.825 --> 00:07:39.226 position:44% line:89% align:start
Whoa!

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.861 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're really good
at that, Mikey!

00:07:40.895 --> 00:07:42.196 position:38% line:89% align:start
Yo, Emma!

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:44.165 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Emma] What the hell is this?

00:07:44.198 --> 00:07:45.566 position:21% line:89% align:start
Did you guys make up?

00:07:45.599 --> 00:07:47.034 position:21% line:83% align:start
But you two were at
each other's throats!

00:07:47.068 --> 00:07:48.836 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Mikey] Oh, shut up, Emma!

00:07:48.869 --> 00:07:49.870 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Draken] Were we?

00:07:49.904 --> 00:07:52.640 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Emma] Yes, I was
worried, damn it!

00:07:52.673 --> 00:07:56.010 position:19% line:89% align:start
(gentle peaceful music)

00:08:09.623 --> 00:08:11.325 position:16% line:5% align:start
-Can I get one of those?
-They really decked

00:08:11.359 --> 00:08:12.660 position:19% line:5% align:start
-the place out.
-Over here, over here!

00:08:12.693 --> 00:08:15.262 position:10% line:5% align:start
-(festival-goers chattering)
-(gentle festive music)

00:08:15.296 --> 00:08:16.496 position:10% line:5% align:start
-Come on down, come on down!
-Please, please, please!

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:19.166 position:13% line:5% align:start
(festival-goers chattering)

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.301 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Emma] Hi, guys, we're here!

00:08:20.334 --> 00:08:21.302 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Ah!

00:08:21.335 --> 00:08:24.605 position:13% line:89% align:start
(festival-goers chattering)

00:08:24.638 --> 00:08:26.340 position:10% line:89% align:start
It sure took you long enough.

00:08:26.374 --> 00:08:28.642 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasping)

00:08:28.676 --> 00:08:30.811 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] I'm sorry,
Naoto, I know you want me

00:08:30.845 --> 00:08:32.279 position:10% line:89% align:start
to come back to the present,

00:08:32.313 --> 00:08:34.515 position:27% line:83% align:start
but I need you to
wait just a bit!

00:08:34.548 --> 00:08:37.318 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm allowed to have this
little treat, aren't I?

00:08:37.351 --> 00:08:40.521 position:21% line:89% align:start
(calm pleasant music)

00:08:43.657 --> 00:08:45.126 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Hey!
-(Takemichi gasping)

00:08:45.159 --> 00:08:46.460 position:30% line:89% align:start
Try to keep up.

00:08:46.494 --> 00:08:47.695 position:44% line:89% align:start
Okay!

00:08:49.663 --> 00:08:52.466 position:16% line:83% align:start
You know, let's let them
go off on their own.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:53.467 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Hm!

00:08:53.502 --> 00:08:55.069 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Emma] Ooh, look at that!

00:08:55.102 --> 00:08:56.137 position:16% line:89% align:start
That looks so delicious!

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:58.339 position:24% line:83% align:start
Draken, I wanna eat
some of that, okay?

00:08:58.372 --> 00:08:59.140 position:13% line:89% align:start
What are you talking about?

00:08:59.173 --> 00:09:00.808 position:19% line:89% align:start
No way, you'll get fat!

00:09:00.841 --> 00:09:02.910 position:24% line:83% align:start
What? How dare you
say that to me!

00:09:02.943 --> 00:09:04.178 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Whoa!

00:09:04.211 --> 00:09:07.114 position:7% line:89% align:start
Aw, don't give in, stay strong!

00:09:07.148 --> 00:09:08.115 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Huh?

00:09:08.149 --> 00:09:09.083 position:13% line:89% align:start
You haven't even mentioned

00:09:09.116 --> 00:09:10.284 position:19% line:83% align:start
-my cute new yukata.
-I'm rooting for Emma,

00:09:10.317 --> 00:09:11.852 position:30% line:83% align:start
-obviously!
-Huh, how was I

00:09:11.886 --> 00:09:12.953 position:10% line:83% align:start
-supposed to know it was new?
-She's so crazy about Draken,

00:09:12.987 --> 00:09:15.489 position:21% line:83% align:start
and he just won't
take the hint at all!

00:09:15.524 --> 00:09:17.491 position:7% line:89% align:start
And just look how cute Emma is!

00:09:17.526 --> 00:09:18.492 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] When
did you and Emma

00:09:18.527 --> 00:09:20.294 position:16% line:89% align:start
become such good friends?

00:09:20.327 --> 00:09:21.929 position:7% line:89% align:start
Once I talked to her I realized

00:09:21.962 --> 00:09:24.465 position:10% line:89% align:start
Emma's just such a pure soul.

00:09:24.498 --> 00:09:26.634 position:24% line:83% align:start
She does go off the
deep end at times,

00:09:26.667 --> 00:09:29.170 position:16% line:83% align:start
but that's just because
she loves Draken so much.

00:09:29.203 --> 00:09:31.872 position:13% line:83% align:start
That's why she came onto
you like she did that time.

00:09:32.873 --> 00:09:33.874 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:38.245 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh, Hina?

00:09:38.279 --> 00:09:40.047 position:10% line:89% align:start
You're not off the hook yet!

00:09:40.081 --> 00:09:41.015 position:19% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi whimpering)

00:09:41.048 --> 00:09:43.217 position:19% line:83% align:start
Now I know Emma's
after Draken, not you,

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:45.052 position:27% line:83% align:start
but you're still
in the doghouse!

00:09:45.086 --> 00:09:46.253 position:19% line:89% align:start
Uh, but that was just-

00:09:46.287 --> 00:09:47.522 position:33% line:89% align:start
You cheater!

00:09:47.556 --> 00:09:49.924 position:16% line:83% align:start
But, but I didn't
cheat, that was all her!

00:09:49.957 --> 00:09:51.592 position:35% line:89% align:start
I, uh, uh-

00:09:51.625 --> 00:09:53.528 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hey, let's do that!

00:09:53.562 --> 00:09:55.930 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] Yeah,
the shooting gallery?

00:09:55.963 --> 00:09:58.299 position:19% line:83% align:start
If you win me a prize,
I'll forgive you.

00:09:59.133 --> 00:10:01.602 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hm, you're on!

00:10:01.635 --> 00:10:04.738 position:21% line:89% align:start
(intense rock music)

00:10:07.441 --> 00:10:09.944 position:33% line:89% align:start
(gun cocking)

00:10:11.412 --> 00:10:14.081 position:30% line:89% align:start
(cork rattling)

00:10:15.249 --> 00:10:18.119 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi groaning)

00:10:18.152 --> 00:10:20.688 position:21% line:83% align:start
I want her to
forgive me, damn it!

00:10:22.089 --> 00:10:24.158 position:33% line:89% align:start
(gun popping)

00:10:24.191 --> 00:10:26.794 position:30% line:89% align:start
(both gasping)

00:10:32.766 --> 00:10:34.902 position:7% line:89% align:start
Damn it, that game was rigged!

00:10:34.935 --> 00:10:37.171 position:16% line:89% align:start
I hit that target square!

00:10:37.204 --> 00:10:38.706 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Hinata giggling)

00:10:38.739 --> 00:10:41.642 position:19% line:83% align:start
-(rain pattering)
-(gentle festive music)

00:10:41.675 --> 00:10:43.811 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Oh, it's raining.
-(Takemichi sighing)

00:10:43.844 --> 00:10:46.046 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Hey, look, it's raining!
-(child shouting)

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.214 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Come on.
-Hurry!

00:10:47.248 --> 00:10:50.184 position:10% line:83% align:start
-(festival-goers chattering)
-(rain pattering)

00:10:50.217 --> 00:10:53.354 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Hinata laughing)

00:10:53.387 --> 00:10:54.688 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Hina, over here!

00:10:54.722 --> 00:10:57.158 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Hinata] Whoa, we're
totally soaked!

00:10:57.191 --> 00:10:59.260 position:21% line:83% align:start
Damn, no kidding,
and just when my hair

00:10:59.293 --> 00:11:00.427 position:19% line:89% align:start
was looking so awesome!

00:11:01.596 --> 00:11:02.796 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh.

00:11:06.367 --> 00:11:08.202 position:13% line:89% align:start
Somehow we ended up alone.

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:14.742 position:27% line:89% align:start
Coming down hard.

00:11:16.043 --> 00:11:17.311 position:41% line:89% align:start
It is.

00:11:17.344 --> 00:11:19.146 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(Hinata groaning)
-Huh?

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:20.347 position:33% line:89% align:start
What's wrong?

00:11:20.381 --> 00:11:22.783 position:13% line:83% align:start
These sandals are a little
too small for my feet.

00:11:22.816 --> 00:11:24.351 position:19% line:89% align:start
Whoa, you're bleeding!

00:11:25.319 --> 00:11:26.287 position:27% line:89% align:start
Let me help you!

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.155 position:38% line:89% align:start
Stand up.

00:11:28.189 --> 00:11:29.323 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Hinata yelping)

00:11:29.356 --> 00:11:32.193 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi grunting)

00:11:34.261 --> 00:11:35.062 position:30% line:89% align:start
(bag thudding)

00:11:37.231 --> 00:11:38.365 position:30% line:89% align:start
That was close!

00:11:38.399 --> 00:11:39.366 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Hinata sighing)

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:40.367 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi yelping)

00:11:40.401 --> 00:11:42.269 position:16% line:89% align:start
Sorry, I wasn't trying...

00:11:42.303 --> 00:11:43.304 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:11:46.473 --> 00:11:47.474 position:35% line:89% align:start
It's okay.

00:11:48.142 --> 00:11:51.546 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Huh?

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:55.149 position:13% line:89% align:start
(gentle sentimental music)

00:11:56.585 --> 00:11:57.818 position:30% line:89% align:start
I forgive you.

00:11:58.653 --> 00:12:00.287 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Really?

00:12:00.321 --> 00:12:04.325 position:19% line:83% align:start
Because you tried so
hard to win that prize.

00:12:04.358 --> 00:12:05.594 position:24% line:89% align:start
It was really cute.

00:12:05.627 --> 00:12:09.196 position:10% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi breathing shakily)

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:11.732 position:27% line:89% align:start
(rain pattering)

00:12:13.767 --> 00:12:15.670 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] This,
this is a yes, right?

00:12:15.704 --> 00:12:17.838 position:13% line:89% align:start
Isn't that what this means?

00:12:17.871 --> 00:12:20.675 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gulping)

00:12:20.709 --> 00:12:22.876 position:21% line:83% align:start
She's saying I can
kiss her, isn't she?

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:25.746 position:19% line:89% align:start
(gentle romantic music)

00:12:25.779 --> 00:12:27.214 position:19% line:89% align:start
(Hinata sighing softly)

00:12:27.248 --> 00:12:28.583 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm going for it!

00:12:28.617 --> 00:12:30.251 position:33% line:89% align:start
I'm going in!

00:12:30.284 --> 00:12:31.252 position:33% line:89% align:start
I'm doing it!

00:12:31.285 --> 00:12:32.853 position:30% line:89% align:start
(phone ringing)

00:12:32.886 --> 00:12:35.222 position:27% line:89% align:start
Takemichi, wait.

00:12:35.256 --> 00:12:37.024 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Hm?

00:12:37.057 --> 00:12:38.892 position:7% line:89% align:start
I think someone's calling you.

00:12:38.926 --> 00:12:41.762 position:10% line:83% align:start
Ugh, who the hell would
call me at a time like this?

00:12:41.795 --> 00:12:43.264 position:10% line:89% align:start
Yeah, yeah, what do ya want?

00:12:43.297 --> 00:12:44.932 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh, hi, Takemichi.

00:12:44.965 --> 00:12:47.134 position:19% line:89% align:start
Doesn't this rain suck?

00:12:47.167 --> 00:12:48.302 position:30% line:89% align:start
Ugh, Yamagishi!

00:12:48.335 --> 00:12:50.004 position:24% line:83% align:start
You've got a lot
of nerve calling me

00:12:50.037 --> 00:12:52.006 position:27% line:83% align:start
about some stupid
shit like this!

00:12:52.039 --> 00:12:55.009 position:16% line:83% align:start
I was about to hit a big
turning point in my life!

00:12:55.042 --> 00:12:57.845 position:13% line:83% align:start
Oh, are you out somewhere
with Draken and Mikey then?

00:12:57.878 --> 00:12:59.013 position:24% line:83% align:start
(Takemichi sighing
in exasperation)

00:12:59.046 --> 00:13:00.014 position:47% line:89% align:start
No.

00:13:00.047 --> 00:13:02.483 position:13% line:89% align:start
I was with Draken earlier.

00:13:02.517 --> 00:13:05.286 position:13% line:83% align:start
Mikey said he couldn't come
out with us for some reason.

00:13:05.319 --> 00:13:06.487 position:30% line:89% align:start
Why, what's up?

00:13:06.521 --> 00:13:08.222 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Hm.
-Just be a sec,

00:13:08.255 --> 00:13:09.390 position:16% line:83% align:start
-so sorry!
-Well, when you see him,

00:13:09.423 --> 00:13:10.791 position:19% line:83% align:start
you should tell Draken
to watch his back.

00:13:10.824 --> 00:13:12.493 position:30% line:89% align:start
What, what for?

00:13:12.527 --> 00:13:14.094 position:13% line:89% align:start
I just got some new intel.

00:13:15.462 --> 00:13:17.231 position:7% line:89% align:start
It was about the Mikey faction.

00:13:17.264 --> 00:13:19.900 position:13% line:83% align:start
Word has it that some of
them are out to get Draken.

00:13:19.933 --> 00:13:22.102 position:24% line:83% align:start
But, wait, that
doesn't make sense!

00:13:22.136 --> 00:13:24.071 position:13% line:83% align:start
You saw it yourself,
they're best friends again!

00:13:24.104 --> 00:13:26.907 position:21% line:83% align:start
Mm, yeah, but some
of the rank-and-file

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:28.576 position:19% line:89% align:start
still aren't satisfied.

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:31.078 position:13% line:83% align:start
Actually they're even more
riled up because of that.

00:13:31.111 --> 00:13:33.480 position:19% line:83% align:start
Maybe this conflict is
gonna have a round two.

00:13:33.515 --> 00:13:34.948 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasping)

00:13:34.982 --> 00:13:38.018 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] So the conflict
still isn't over yet?

00:13:39.386 --> 00:13:40.487 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Kazushi] Hello?

00:13:40.522 --> 00:13:41.723 position:35% line:89% align:start
Takemichi?

00:13:41.756 --> 00:13:43.891 position:27% line:83% align:start
-You still there?
-(phone beeping)

00:13:43.924 --> 00:13:45.859 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Hinata] What's wrong?

00:13:45.893 --> 00:13:47.562 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh, it, it's nothing.

00:13:48.929 --> 00:13:50.497 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi grunting)

00:13:50.532 --> 00:13:51.932 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Hinata] Huh?

00:13:51.965 --> 00:13:53.834 position:19% line:83% align:start
Do me a favor, Hina,
wait right here for me!

00:13:53.867 --> 00:13:55.503 position:21% line:83% align:start
-What?
-I'll be right back!

00:13:55.537 --> 00:13:56.604 position:21% line:89% align:start
Where are you going?

00:13:57.905 --> 00:14:00.775 position:19% line:83% align:start
Aw, jeez, you're going
to catch a cold!

00:14:00.809 --> 00:14:03.010 position:21% line:83% align:start
-(Takemichi panting)
-(suspenseful music)

00:14:03.043 --> 00:14:04.546 position:19% line:89% align:start
Where are you, Draken?

00:14:05.613 --> 00:14:08.182 position:10% line:89% align:start
Damn it, I let my guard down!

00:14:08.215 --> 00:14:11.285 position:10% line:83% align:start
I figured the conflict would
stop after they made up!

00:14:11.318 --> 00:14:14.789 position:5% line:83% align:start
But it looks like Draken's
still set to die on August 3rd,

00:14:14.823 --> 00:14:17.024 position:16% line:89% align:start
and today is August 3rd!

00:14:17.826 --> 00:14:19.661 position:19% line:89% align:start
Draken, where are you?

00:14:19.694 --> 00:14:20.861 position:44% line:89% align:start
Why?

00:14:20.894 --> 00:14:23.230 position:24% line:83% align:start
Why did I let my
guard down so much?

00:14:23.263 --> 00:14:26.033 position:27% line:89% align:start
(rain pattering)

00:14:27.569 --> 00:14:30.371 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi panting)

00:14:36.578 --> 00:14:38.212 position:21% line:89% align:start
Those are Toman guys!

00:14:38.245 --> 00:14:39.913 position:13% line:89% align:start
Is it Mikey and the others?

00:14:41.148 --> 00:14:42.349 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:14:42.383 --> 00:14:44.485 position:10% line:83% align:start
Wait, why are Toman guys here
with somebody from Moebius?

00:14:45.787 --> 00:14:47.221 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Moebius Member]
You ready for this?

00:14:47.254 --> 00:14:48.288 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah!

00:14:49.824 --> 00:14:52.627 position:21% line:89% align:start
(grim dramatic music)

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:56.731 position:10% line:83% align:start
Because of him and what he
did, I lost everything I had.

00:14:56.765 --> 00:14:58.499 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Kiyomasa?

00:14:58.533 --> 00:15:01.001 position:30% line:89% align:start
(air whooshing)

00:15:02.002 --> 00:15:03.805 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm gonna find Draken

00:15:03.838 --> 00:15:05.906 position:10% line:89% align:start
and then I'm gonna kill him!

00:15:05.939 --> 00:15:07.174 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasping)

00:15:07.207 --> 00:15:08.710 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] So it was Kiyomasa

00:15:08.743 --> 00:15:10.678 position:7% line:89% align:start
who was behind Draken's murder?

00:15:10.712 --> 00:15:11.746 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi panting)

(hand thudding)

00:15:16.751 --> 00:15:17.985 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Akaishi] Hey, look who I found!

00:15:18.018 --> 00:15:20.187 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi grunting)

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:21.556 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Let go of me!

00:15:22.923 --> 00:15:23.691 position:21% line:83% align:start
-(Takemichi grunting)
-(Takemichi crashing)

00:15:23.725 --> 00:15:27.595 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi groaning)

00:15:27.629 --> 00:15:28.596 position:19% line:89% align:start
Well, what do ya know?

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:30.765 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's our old friend Hanagaki!

00:15:30.799 --> 00:15:32.734 position:13% line:89% align:start
I heard what you just said.

00:15:32.767 --> 00:15:33.934 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's wrong with you, Kiyomasa?

00:15:33.967 --> 00:15:36.270 position:24% line:83% align:start
Why are you trying
to kill Draken?

00:15:36.303 --> 00:15:37.471 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:15:37.505 --> 00:15:39.139 position:27% line:89% align:start
Get up Hanagaki!

00:15:39.173 --> 00:15:40.140 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasping)

00:15:40.174 --> 00:15:42.075 position:7% line:89% align:start
Go out and buy us some drinks.

00:15:42.544 --> 00:15:43.511 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Huh?

00:15:43.545 --> 00:15:44.779 position:16% line:89% align:start
(gang members chuckling)

00:15:44.813 --> 00:15:46.714 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh, and make mine a cola.

00:15:48.081 --> 00:15:49.717 position:16% line:83% align:start
-(Takemichi grunting)
-(gang members laughing)

00:15:49.751 --> 00:15:50.951 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] What the hell?

00:15:50.984 --> 00:15:52.486 position:24% line:89% align:start
My body's shaking!

00:15:54.722 --> 00:15:55.890 position:27% line:83% align:start
-(blow thudding)
-Hey, you deaf?

00:15:55.924 --> 00:15:58.125 position:21% line:83% align:start
Get your ass in gear
and get me a coffee!

-(blow thudding)
-(Takemichi grunting)

00:16:00.562 --> 00:16:02.196 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] I'm sorry!

00:16:02.229 --> 00:16:05.132 position:7% line:89% align:start
Why the hell am I apologizing?

00:16:05.165 --> 00:16:06.500 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Akaishi] A slave like
you's got no right

00:16:06.534 --> 00:16:08.570 position:24% line:83% align:start
to ask about Draken
or anybody else!

00:16:08.603 --> 00:16:12.239 position:10% line:83% align:start
Guess we need to remind you
what a piece of shit you are!

00:16:12.272 --> 00:16:13.808 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] That's right,

00:16:13.842 --> 00:16:16.109 position:27% line:83% align:start
I didn't actually
get any stronger.

00:16:16.143 --> 00:16:18.312 position:7% line:89% align:start
I just imagined I was stronger

00:16:18.345 --> 00:16:20.615 position:21% line:83% align:start
because I was around
Mikey and Draken.

00:16:20.648 --> 00:16:21.982 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Hey!
-Hit him harder!

00:16:22.015 --> 00:16:23.952 position:16% line:83% align:start
-(blows thudding)

-(blows thudding)
-(gang members laughing)

00:16:29.122 --> 00:16:32.359 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] The fact is
this is who I really am.

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:36.463 position:16% line:83% align:start

(Takemichi sobbing)

00:16:39.701 --> 00:16:40.835 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry!

00:16:40.869 --> 00:16:43.036 position:10% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi breathing heavily)

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:45.607 position:27% line:83% align:start
Hey, somebody get
me some duct tape.

00:16:47.542 --> 00:16:52.547 position:21% line:83% align:start
-(Takemichi mumbling)

-(foot stomping)
-(Takemichi grunting)

00:16:54.916 --> 00:16:56.784 position:16% line:89% align:start
Not so tough now, are ya?

00:16:57.719 --> 00:16:59.754 position:7% line:89% align:start
You don't understand anything.

00:16:59.787 --> 00:17:01.589 position:13% line:89% align:start
Once this deal is all over,

00:17:01.623 --> 00:17:04.258 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna fix it so you
end up taking the fall

00:17:04.291 --> 00:17:06.126 position:16% line:89% align:start
for the whole damn thing.

00:17:06.159 --> 00:17:08.863 position:16% line:83% align:start
Until then, you just lay
there like what you are,

00:17:08.897 --> 00:17:10.030 position:27% line:89% align:start
a piece of shit.

00:17:10.063 --> 00:17:13.200 position:21% line:89% align:start
(footsteps thudding)

00:17:19.072 --> 00:17:22.042 position:27% line:89% align:start
(rain pattering)

00:17:31.051 --> 00:17:32.720 position:35% line:89% align:start
Takemichi?

00:17:32.754 --> 00:17:36.056 position:21% line:89% align:start
(footsteps thudding)

00:17:37.725 --> 00:17:41.228 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi grunting)

00:17:41.261 --> 00:17:42.964 position:16% line:89% align:start
(gasping) What happened?

00:17:42.997 --> 00:17:44.732 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh no, are you all right?

00:17:44.766 --> 00:17:45.733 position:21% line:89% align:start
Who did this to you?

00:17:45.767 --> 00:17:47.167 position:19% line:89% align:start
Here, let me help you.

00:17:48.101 --> 00:17:51.305 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Hinata grunting)

00:17:51.338 --> 00:17:52.339 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:17:53.808 --> 00:17:56.343 position:30% line:89% align:start
(tape tearing)

00:17:59.179 --> 00:18:01.649 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry for leaving you alone.

00:18:01.683 --> 00:18:02.684 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Hinata] Huh?

00:18:05.085 --> 00:18:06.521 position:13% line:89% align:start
I really suck at all this.

00:18:07.922 --> 00:18:09.423 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Hinata] Why would you say that?

00:18:10.257 --> 00:18:12.159 position:10% line:89% align:start
I did the best I could, Hina.

00:18:12.961 --> 00:18:14.428 position:38% line:89% align:start
It hurts,

00:18:14.461 --> 00:18:15.462 position:38% line:89% align:start
it sucks,

00:18:16.798 --> 00:18:20.367 position:16% line:83% align:start
but I really did my best
to fix things, and yet...

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:23.370 position:16% line:83% align:start
And yet I haven't really
changed anything at all!

00:18:23.403 --> 00:18:25.039 position:27% line:83% align:start
I haven't managed
to save anyone!

00:18:25.073 --> 00:18:26.608 position:30% line:89% align:start
(somber music)

00:18:26.641 --> 00:18:28.910 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi laughing)

00:18:28.943 --> 00:18:30.410 position:24% line:83% align:start
But then what else
was I expecting?

00:18:30.444 --> 00:18:33.081 position:13% line:83% align:start
How the hell was a complete
and utter failure like me

00:18:33.113 --> 00:18:34.816 position:27% line:83% align:start
ever supposed to
have a snowball's

00:18:34.849 --> 00:18:36.316 position:5% line:89% align:start
chance in hell at saving anyone?

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:38.586 position:21% line:89% align:start
How stupid can I be?

00:18:40.688 --> 00:18:41.956 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Hinata] That's not true.

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:43.791 position:21% line:89% align:start
Just leave me alone!

00:18:43.825 --> 00:18:46.594 position:16% line:83% align:start
I can't stand to have you
see how pathetic I am!

00:18:46.628 --> 00:18:48.563 position:24% line:83% align:start
This would've been
nothing if I was

00:18:48.596 --> 00:18:52.132 position:19% line:83% align:start
more like Draken or
Mikey or anybody else!

00:18:52.165 --> 00:18:53.968 position:24% line:83% align:start
Then I would've
just kicked his ass

00:18:54.002 --> 00:18:56.136 position:24% line:83% align:start
and I would've
done it with style!

00:18:56.169 --> 00:18:57.170 position:30% line:89% align:start
But me I'm just

00:18:57.939 --> 00:19:01.141 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi sobbing)

00:19:01.174 --> 00:19:03.511 position:10% line:89% align:start
nothing but a total failure.

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:08.716 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasping)

00:19:15.757 --> 00:19:17.925 position:24% line:89% align:start
(sentimental music)

00:19:17.959 --> 00:19:19.459 position:19% line:89% align:start
That was my first kiss.

00:19:20.628 --> 00:19:22.195 position:38% line:89% align:start
But why?

00:19:22.229 --> 00:19:25.099 position:16% line:83% align:start
I gave it to you because
you're that special.

00:19:25.133 --> 00:19:28.603 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're not Draken and
you're not Mikey either.

00:19:28.636 --> 00:19:30.571 position:27% line:89% align:start
You're just you.

00:19:30.605 --> 00:19:31.773 position:27% line:89% align:start
You're Takemichi.

00:19:33.141 --> 00:19:35.777 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're not afraid to
cry for others' pain

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:38.846 position:16% line:83% align:start
and you get so frustrated
trying to help them!

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.213 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's just who you are.

00:19:41.381 --> 00:19:44.217 position:19% line:83% align:start
If you ask me, there's
no one cooler than you.

00:19:45.485 --> 00:19:50.390 position:5% line:83% align:start
-(Takemichi sobbing)
-(sentimental orchestral music)

00:19:57.598 --> 00:20:00.367 position:27% line:89% align:start
(rain pattering)

00:20:01.169 --> 00:20:03.336 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hinata, thank you.

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:05.139 position:7% line:89% align:start
What for? I didn't do anything!

00:20:05.173 --> 00:20:06.373 position:41% line:89% align:start
I, uh-

00:20:07.008 --> 00:20:08.710 position:33% line:89% align:start
Don't worry!

00:20:08.743 --> 00:20:11.411 position:16% line:83% align:start
You can do what you need
to do, I have faith.

00:20:12.412 --> 00:20:15.315 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi grunting)

00:20:15.348 --> 00:20:17.719 position:10% line:89% align:start
I couldn't be any lamer, huh?

00:20:17.752 --> 00:20:19.554 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Hinata] Just no
more crying, okay?

00:20:19.587 --> 00:20:21.823 position:27% line:83% align:start
I wasn't crying,
that's the rain!

00:20:21.856 --> 00:20:24.759 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Hinata giggling)

00:20:24.792 --> 00:20:25.993 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi chuckling)

00:20:26.027 --> 00:20:27.695 position:41% line:89% align:start
But now

00:20:27.729 --> 00:20:28.730 position:33% line:89% align:start
I have to go.

00:20:28.763 --> 00:20:29.764 position:44% line:89% align:start
'Kay!

00:20:31.132 --> 00:20:34.334 position:21% line:83% align:start
-(footsteps thudding)
-(pensive music)

00:20:34.367 --> 00:20:36.504 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] And this
time will be different!

00:20:36.537 --> 00:20:39.439 position:21% line:83% align:start
This time, I'm going
to stop Kiyomasa!

00:20:39.473 --> 00:20:43.010 position:10% line:83% align:start
And then I'm going to settle
the trauma in my life,

00:20:43.945 --> 00:20:44.946 position:27% line:89% align:start
once and for all!

00:20:46.013 --> 00:20:48.783 position:27% line:89% align:start
(engine revving)

00:20:48.816 --> 00:20:50.785 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Takemitchy!

00:20:50.818 --> 00:20:51.853 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hey, Takashi.

00:20:51.886 --> 00:20:53.855 position:10% line:89% align:start
Wait, why're you by yourself?

00:20:53.888 --> 00:20:55.322 position:30% line:89% align:start
Where's Draken?

00:20:55.355 --> 00:20:57.125 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] We've got
big trouble, Takashi!

00:20:57.158 --> 00:20:58.492 position:7% line:89% align:start
Draken's about to be attacked!

00:20:58.526 --> 00:21:00.228 position:7% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I know, I heard about it.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:01.929 position:24% line:83% align:start
Wait a minute, you
already knew that?

00:21:01.963 --> 00:21:03.598 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Takashi] And I know by who.

00:21:03.631 --> 00:21:05.265 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Yeah, Kiyomasa!
-That damn Peh.

00:21:05.298 --> 00:21:06.299 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Takashi] Huh?

00:21:06.333 --> 00:21:07.769 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Huh?

00:21:09.237 --> 00:21:11.105 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Takashi] Mikey
wanted to pay the bond

00:21:11.139 --> 00:21:13.107 position:7% line:89% align:start
to get Pah released from jail,

00:21:13.141 --> 00:21:15.710 position:21% line:83% align:start
but Draken was
dead-set against it.

00:21:15.743 --> 00:21:17.612 position:19% line:83% align:start
How the hell did you
manage to get those two

00:21:17.645 --> 00:21:20.413 position:7% line:83% align:start
to quit fighting when even our
captains couldn't stop them?

00:21:21.249 --> 00:21:23.251 position:21% line:89% align:start
Using my head, sorta.

00:21:23.283 --> 00:21:26.988 position:24% line:89% align:start
(playful thudding)

00:21:27.021 --> 00:21:28.556 position:16% line:89% align:start
Whatever you did, thanks,

00:21:28.589 --> 00:21:30.290 position:24% line:83% align:start
because if you
hadn't stopped 'em,

00:21:30.323 --> 00:21:32.425 position:10% line:89% align:start
Toman might've been finished!

00:21:32.459 --> 00:21:34.461 position:24% line:83% align:start
I really can't take
any credit for that.

00:21:34.494 --> 00:21:36.631 position:10% line:89% align:start
You're way too modest, dude.

00:21:36.664 --> 00:21:39.200 position:24% line:83% align:start
Anyway, that's not
what matters here.

00:21:39.233 --> 00:21:40.201 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Takashi] Huh?

00:21:40.234 --> 00:21:41.669 position:24% line:89% align:start
What's the matter?

00:21:41.702 --> 00:21:44.005 position:13% line:83% align:start
Hey, wait, I just realized
that's Peh's bike.

00:21:44.038 --> 00:21:45.305 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Huh?

00:21:45.338 --> 00:21:47.307 position:27% line:83% align:start
Most of Toman was
on the same page.

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:49.043 position:21% line:83% align:start
We all agreed there
was nothing any of us

00:21:49.076 --> 00:21:52.513 position:5% line:83% align:start
could've done that night to
prevent Pah from getting caught.

00:21:52.547 --> 00:21:55.016 position:24% line:83% align:start
All of us, that
is, except for Peh.

00:21:55.049 --> 00:21:56.316 position:10% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasping in shock)

00:21:56.349 --> 00:21:58.519 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Emma] I'd better call
Hinata and see where she is.

00:21:58.553 --> 00:22:00.320 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Draken] She probably
went home already,

00:22:00.353 --> 00:22:01.722 position:24% line:89% align:start
with all this rain.

00:22:01.756 --> 00:22:02.723 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Peh] Draken!

00:22:02.757 --> 00:22:03.724 position:35% line:89% align:start
[Both] Huh?

00:22:03.758 --> 00:22:06.459 position:33% line:89% align:start
(tense music)

00:22:07.394 --> 00:22:09.329 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh, hey, Peh, what's up?

00:22:09.362 --> 00:22:10.865 position:7% line:89% align:start
What's the deal with the sash?

00:22:11.866 --> 00:22:14.467 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Peh growling)

00:22:17.872 --> 00:22:20.875 position:21% line:89% align:start
(closing theme music)

00:22:27.215 --> 00:22:32.419 position:10% line:89% align:start
(singer singing in Japanese)
