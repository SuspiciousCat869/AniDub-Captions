00:00:09.476 --> 00:00:11.144 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Reporter] Now that
we're well into July,

00:00:11.178 --> 00:00:12.981 position:24% line:83% align:start
the weather in
China's heating up,

00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:14.682 position:19% line:83% align:start
and so the air pressure
is starting to bring

00:00:14.716 --> 00:00:16.116 position:21% line:89% align:start
that warmth our way.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:18.151 position:21% line:83% align:start
Already we're seeing
overall temperatures

00:00:18.185 --> 00:00:20.487 position:19% line:5% align:start
higher than last year
all across the country.

00:00:20.522 --> 00:00:23.123 position:16% line:5% align:start
The Kantou Koushin'etsu
area and the Tokai region

00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:26.159 position:19% line:83% align:start
will have clear, sunny,
summery skies ahead.

00:00:26.193 --> 00:00:27.461 position:10% line:89% align:start
And it will be hotter inland,

00:00:27.494 --> 00:00:29.196 position:21% line:83% align:start
so beware of
unexpected rainstorms

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:31.298 position:10% line:89% align:start
in areas near the mountains.

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:33.568 position:27% line:83% align:start
And that's it for
the local weather.

00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:35.235 position:27% line:89% align:start
Now a newsbreak.

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:37.705 position:10% line:83% align:start
The escalating dispute
between the Tokyo Manji Gang

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.908 position:13% line:83% align:start
and its rivals is believed
to have just claimed

00:00:39.941 --> 00:00:42.075 position:24% line:83% align:start
several additional
innocent victims.

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:44.913 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] Wait,
seriously? That's insane.

00:00:44.946 --> 00:00:46.380 position:7% line:89% align:start
Official word is being withheld

00:00:46.413 --> 00:00:48.115 position:21% line:83% align:start
pending notification
of next-of-kin.

00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:50.985 position:21% line:5% align:start
But the two have been
tentatively identified

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:54.589 position:19% line:5% align:start
as Naoto Tachibana, 25,
from Shibuya, Tokyo.

00:00:54.622 --> 00:00:55.823 position:27% line:5% align:start
Naoto Tachibana?

00:00:55.857 --> 00:00:57.457 position:24% line:5% align:start
And another victim
also from Shibuya,

00:00:57.491 --> 00:01:02.129 position:5% line:5% align:start
Tachibana's older sister,
Hinata Tachibana, 26 years old.

00:01:02.162 --> 00:01:04.331 position:21% line:5% align:start
The Police Department
is on high alert.

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:08.201 position:7% line:5% align:start
Did he really just say Hinata?

00:01:09.771 --> 00:01:12.439 position:30% line:89% align:start
(intense music)

00:01:15.242 --> 00:01:18.513 position:10% line:83% align:start
Apparently, my one and only
girlfriend, Hinata Tachibana,

00:01:18.546 --> 00:01:21.616 position:21% line:83% align:start
who I dated in middle
school, is dead.

00:01:22.817 --> 00:01:25.118 position:10% line:89% align:start
Hey, I know you're in there!

00:01:26.554 --> 00:01:27.354 position:41% line:89% align:start
Oh, hi.

00:01:27.387 --> 00:01:28.890 position:27% line:83% align:start
How many times do
I have to tell you

00:01:28.923 --> 00:01:30.357 position:13% line:89% align:start
to turn your damn TV down?

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.693 position:13% line:89% align:start
I can hear it a mile away!

00:01:31.726 --> 00:01:32.827 position:27% line:89% align:start
Sorry about that.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.395 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Landlady] Honestly, kids
these days have no class.

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:36.496 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ugh.

00:01:39.634 --> 00:01:42.269 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Manager] Seriously, how many
times do I have to tell you

00:01:42.302 --> 00:01:45.439 position:21% line:83% align:start
the same thing before
you get it, Takemichi?

00:01:45.472 --> 00:01:46.306 position:47% line:89% align:start
Um.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.175 position:24% line:83% align:start
DVDs need to go
back on the shelves

00:01:48.208 --> 00:01:49.978 position:10% line:89% align:start
as soon as they're returned.

00:01:50.011 --> 00:01:51.846 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm tired of telling you this.

00:01:51.879 --> 00:01:52.814 position:21% line:83% align:start
-I'm sorry-
-Yeah, yeah, I know.

00:01:52.847 --> 00:01:54.481 position:13% line:89% align:start
All you ever are is sorry.

00:01:54.983 --> 00:01:57.819 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi sighs)

00:02:00.187 --> 00:02:01.823 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Delinquent] What a loser, huh?

00:02:02.824 --> 00:02:04.358 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hey there, old dude.

00:02:04.391 --> 00:02:05.158 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:02:05.192 --> 00:02:06.561 position:10% line:89% align:start
Have you got a problem, nerd?

00:02:06.594 --> 00:02:08.763 position:35% line:89% align:start
Uh, sorry.

00:02:10.798 --> 00:02:12.399 position:41% line:89% align:start
Oh, uh.

00:02:12.432 --> 00:02:14.334 position:19% line:83% align:start
-(delinquent laughing)
-(key scratching)

00:02:14.368 --> 00:02:15.135 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh!

00:02:15.168 --> 00:02:16.236 position:30% line:89% align:start
(gang laughing)

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:17.772 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Delinquent] Good luck, loser!

00:02:17.805 --> 00:02:18.973 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh.

00:02:19.007 --> 00:02:20.340 position:27% line:83% align:start
Hey you, what're
you doing there?

00:02:22.476 --> 00:02:23.911 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:27.949 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] I never
expected that my life

00:02:27.982 --> 00:02:29.182 position:16% line:89% align:start
would turn out like this.

00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:34.254 position:10% line:83% align:start
Living in a crappy apartment
with paper-thin walls.

00:02:34.287 --> 00:02:36.858 position:16% line:83% align:start
Treated like an absolute
moron by my manager,

00:02:36.891 --> 00:02:38.325 position:19% line:89% align:start
who's younger than me.

00:02:38.358 --> 00:02:40.227 position:21% line:83% align:start
Then those punks
pick a fight with me

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.830 position:16% line:89% align:start
and I end up apologizing.

00:02:42.864 --> 00:02:45.232 position:10% line:83% align:start
I've only had one girlfriend
in my entire life,

00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:47.200 position:7% line:89% align:start
and that was in middle school,

00:02:47.234 --> 00:02:50.538 position:16% line:83% align:start
so to top it all off,
I'm still a damn virgin.

00:02:50.571 --> 00:02:52.272 position:7% line:89% align:start
Where the hell did I go wrong?

00:02:54.274 --> 00:02:58.278 position:7% line:89% align:start
(assailant intensely breathing)

00:03:02.482 --> 00:03:03.518 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:03:03.551 --> 00:03:08.355 position:21% line:83% align:start
-(train horn blaring)
-(crowd shouting)

00:03:08.856 --> 00:03:09.857 position:47% line:89% align:start
No!

00:03:12.426 --> 00:03:15.228 position:13% line:83% align:start
In that moment when I
thought I was going to die,

00:03:15.262 --> 00:03:17.330 position:19% line:83% align:start
I didn't remember my
parents or my friends.

00:03:18.566 --> 00:03:20.702 position:7% line:89% align:start
I remembered Hinata Tachibana.

00:03:23.236 --> 00:03:25.305 position:30% line:89% align:start
(gentle music)

00:03:25.338 --> 00:03:27.008 position:13% line:89% align:start
So we heard that Tachibana

00:03:27.041 --> 00:03:28.876 position:24% line:83% align:start
has a really big
crush on Hanagaki.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.144 position:35% line:89% align:start
Super big!

00:03:30.178 --> 00:03:32.747 position:16% line:83% align:start
Oh get real, dude. Why
do they always like you?

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.214 position:19% line:89% align:start
What are you gonna do?

00:03:34.247 --> 00:03:36.383 position:13% line:83% align:start
Some boys from another
class came looking for you.

00:03:36.416 --> 00:03:39.453 position:10% line:83% align:start
Oh don't give me that. I
wouldn't even stand a chance.

00:03:39.486 --> 00:03:42.456 position:13% line:89% align:start
Tachibana is super popular.

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.892 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] Thinking back, my
second year in middle school

00:03:44.926 --> 00:03:46.961 position:16% line:89% align:start
was really when I peaked.

00:03:46.994 --> 00:03:49.564 position:10% line:83% align:start
I was number two in a
kickass gang of second-years,

00:03:49.597 --> 00:03:53.000 position:13% line:83% align:start
and that was the only time
I ever had a girlfriend.

00:03:54.168 --> 00:03:56.303 position:24% line:83% align:start
Is this like that
thing where you see

00:03:56.336 --> 00:03:58.005 position:27% line:83% align:start
your life flash
before your eyes?

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:07.515 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Train Announcer] Shibuya.
We've arrived in Shibuya.

00:04:07.548 --> 00:04:10.184 position:16% line:83% align:start
Please make sure you have
all of your belongings.

00:04:10.218 --> 00:04:11.451 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Oh, sorry.

00:04:11.485 --> 00:04:12.720 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Akkun] Hey, Takemichi!

00:04:12.754 --> 00:04:13.521 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Oh.

00:04:13.554 --> 00:04:14.722 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Yamagishi] You coming or what?

00:04:14.756 --> 00:04:16.256 position:38% line:89% align:start
Ah. What?

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.258 position:24% line:83% align:start
What are you doing?
Get off the train.

00:04:18.291 --> 00:04:23.396 position:7% line:89% align:start
Oh yeah! I was, whoa! (panting)

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.365 position:13% line:89% align:start
Dude, what's your problem?

00:04:25.398 --> 00:04:27.935 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] Whoa,
talk about flashbacks!

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:30.403 position:16% line:83% align:start
Makoto, who couldn't keep
his hands off his dick!

00:04:30.437 --> 00:04:32.372 position:19% line:83% align:start
The fool Yamagishi, who
thought wearing glasses

00:04:32.405 --> 00:04:33.808 position:19% line:89% align:start
would make him smarter!

00:04:33.841 --> 00:04:34.942 position:24% line:89% align:start
Our leader, Akkun!

00:04:34.976 --> 00:04:37.444 position:19% line:83% align:start
And Takuya, who I knew
since we were little!

00:04:37.477 --> 00:04:40.214 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hey, Yamagishi, did you
see this week's issue?

00:04:40.248 --> 00:04:42.382 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Yamagishi] Hell yeah.
That pinup was insane!

00:04:42.415 --> 00:04:44.952 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Akkun] Yo guys, we're
in public here, you know.

00:04:44.986 --> 00:04:45.787 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Takuya] I'm starving.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.454 position:24% line:83% align:start
You guys wanna get
something to eat?

00:04:47.487 --> 00:04:49.289 position:27% line:83% align:start
Yeah, I could go
for a hamburger.

00:04:49.322 --> 00:04:51.058 position:24% line:89% align:start
I've got a coupon.

00:04:51.092 --> 00:04:52.226 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Akkun] Got enough
for all of us?

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.861 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Makoto] Nope.
[Takuya] The hell, man?

00:04:57.665 --> 00:04:59.133 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:04:59.167 --> 00:05:01.468 position:24% line:83% align:start
What kind of stupid
look is this?

00:05:01.502 --> 00:05:04.471 position:21% line:83% align:start
Who the hell is this
lame-looking punk?

00:05:04.505 --> 00:05:07.141 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's me! It's me
from middle school!

00:05:07.175 --> 00:05:08.743 position:30% line:89% align:start
I was so lame!

00:05:08.776 --> 00:05:11.478 position:21% line:83% align:start
But this was supposed
to be when I peaked!

00:05:11.512 --> 00:05:12.814 position:21% line:89% align:start
What's in my pockets?

00:05:12.847 --> 00:05:15.482 position:21% line:83% align:start
A single 500-yen
coin and a cellphone!

00:05:15.516 --> 00:05:19.486 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yo, it's an old flip
phone! Talk about memories!

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.755 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:05:20.788 --> 00:05:23.791 position:30% line:89% align:start
July 4th, 2005?

00:05:23.825 --> 00:05:24.926 position:30% line:89% align:start
This is wrong.

00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:26.961 position:21% line:89% align:start
Then that would mean,

00:05:26.994 --> 00:05:28.930 position:10% line:89% align:start
one, two, three, four, and...

00:05:28.963 --> 00:05:30.363 position:21% line:89% align:start
This is 12 years ago!

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:32.499 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Yamagishi] Hey, Takemichi!

00:05:32.533 --> 00:05:33.466 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:05:33.501 --> 00:05:35.468 position:16% line:83% align:start
Come on. What the hell's
wrong with you today?

00:05:35.503 --> 00:05:36.938 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] Who knew
seeing your life

00:05:36.971 --> 00:05:40.107 position:19% line:83% align:start
flash before your eyes
looked so realistic?

00:05:40.141 --> 00:05:44.946 position:21% line:83% align:start
-(casual music)
-(people chattering)

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.447 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Makoto] Seriously, Takemichi?

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.718 position:13% line:83% align:start
Is that all you ordered is
fries? And only a small?

00:05:50.751 --> 00:05:53.054 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yeah, still need dough
for the ride home.

00:05:53.087 --> 00:05:55.089 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Yamagishi] Ah, you
would've got home somehow.

00:05:55.122 --> 00:05:57.525 position:13% line:83% align:start
You know, it's lucky for
us your cousin's the leader

00:05:57.558 --> 00:05:59.694 position:24% line:83% align:start
of Shibuya Third
Middle School, huh?

00:05:59.727 --> 00:06:00.561 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:06:00.595 --> 00:06:02.395 position:16% line:83% align:start
So now if any third-year
messes with us,

00:06:02.429 --> 00:06:04.765 position:5% line:89% align:start
we just have to namedrop Masaru.

00:06:04.799 --> 00:06:05.600 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:06:06.868 --> 00:06:07.668 position:35% line:89% align:start
My cousin?

00:06:09.337 --> 00:06:11.371 position:21% line:83% align:start
Are they really
talking about Masaru?

00:06:12.073 --> 00:06:13.541 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hang on just a sec.

00:06:13.574 --> 00:06:15.676 position:21% line:83% align:start
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.045 position:13% line:83% align:start
What's so good about having
Masaru around anyway?

00:06:18.079 --> 00:06:19.046 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Group] Huh?

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.448 position:21% line:89% align:start
What? What did I say?

00:06:21.481 --> 00:06:22.482 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Did you hit your head?
-Are you nuts?

00:06:22.516 --> 00:06:24.218 position:10% line:89% align:start
What's wrong with you today?

00:06:24.252 --> 00:06:25.553 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] No,
no, I'm all right.

00:06:25.586 --> 00:06:27.989 position:19% line:83% align:start
Good 'cause we're gonna
go start us a fight!

00:06:28.022 --> 00:06:28.990 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh!

00:06:29.023 --> 00:06:30.358 position:19% line:89% align:start
Somebody's going down!

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.526 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] Come to think
of it, Masaru did say

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.562 position:10% line:83% align:start
he was the leader at
Shibuya Third Middle School.

00:06:34.595 --> 00:06:36.797 position:19% line:83% align:start
My friends, we're gonna
have us a little war

00:06:36.831 --> 00:06:38.299 position:21% line:83% align:start
with the second-years
at that school

00:06:38.332 --> 00:06:39.834 position:13% line:89% align:start
that they'll never forget!

00:06:39.867 --> 00:06:40.968 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yeah!
-What?

00:06:41.002 --> 00:06:42.637 position:21% line:83% align:start
You guys wanna go
over to their school

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:43.804 position:16% line:89% align:start
and fight them right now?

00:06:43.838 --> 00:06:45.106 position:35% line:89% align:start
[Group] Uh.

00:06:46.207 --> 00:06:48.109 position:10% line:89% align:start
Well, someone say something.

00:06:48.142 --> 00:06:51.478 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yo, Takemichi, those guys
all think we're wusses,

00:06:51.512 --> 00:06:53.347 position:21% line:89% align:start
so we have to fight.

00:06:53.381 --> 00:06:55.683 position:16% line:83% align:start
They think we're wusses?
So what do we care?

00:06:55.716 --> 00:06:58.152 position:7% line:83% align:start
Come on, dude, stop acting
like you're scared of a fight.

00:06:58.185 --> 00:06:59.353 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:06:59.387 --> 00:07:00.655 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're gonna give 'em
all the old backfist

00:07:00.688 --> 00:07:02.323 position:7% line:89% align:start
just like you always do, right?

00:07:02.356 --> 00:07:03.824 position:33% line:89% align:start
The backfist?

00:07:03.858 --> 00:07:05.660 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Akkun] Now you're getting
all fired up aren't you?

00:07:05.693 --> 00:07:07.595 position:7% line:89% align:start
Lead us into battle, Commander!

00:07:07.628 --> 00:07:08.596 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Yay!
-(table thuds)

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:09.697 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hey, save it for the fight!

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.565 position:30% line:83% align:start
(boys laughing)
Whoo!

00:07:14.568 --> 00:07:16.270 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Wait, wait, wait.

00:07:16.304 --> 00:07:18.572 position:24% line:83% align:start
Shit is moving
way too fast here!

00:07:18.606 --> 00:07:20.741 position:16% line:83% align:start
But I do recall something
like this happening.

00:07:20.775 --> 00:07:22.910 position:24% line:83% align:start
I think we did talk
to my cousin Masaru

00:07:22.944 --> 00:07:25.713 position:16% line:83% align:start
about picking a fight at
the school in Shibuya.

00:07:25.746 --> 00:07:26.914 position:30% line:83% align:start
-[Makoto] Hey!
-Huh?

00:07:26.948 --> 00:07:28.783 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Makoto] You guys
from Shibuya Third?

00:07:28.816 --> 00:07:29.617 position:27% line:89% align:start
Uh, yeah we are.

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:31.285 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Akkun] What grade
are you in then?

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:32.887 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] They're
serious about this.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:36.724 position:21% line:83% align:start
But fighting? I mean,
really fighting?

00:07:36.757 --> 00:07:39.360 position:19% line:83% align:start
I haven't fought anyone
in like 10 years!

00:07:39.393 --> 00:07:42.163 position:7% line:89% align:start
Shit! I might just piss myself!

00:07:42.196 --> 00:07:43.331 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Student] We're
just first-years,

00:07:43.364 --> 00:07:44.832 position:19% line:83% align:start
so we don't know about
the second-years.

00:07:44.865 --> 00:07:46.367 position:27% line:83% align:start
What? You two are
just first-years?

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.468 position:24% line:83% align:start
Either of you even
got any pubes yet?

00:07:48.502 --> 00:07:49.971 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] I don't get it.

00:07:50.004 --> 00:07:52.373 position:13% line:83% align:start
Were the guys I hung out
with always so aggressive?

00:07:52.406 --> 00:07:55.009 position:19% line:89% align:start
Shit, I can't keep up!

00:07:55.042 --> 00:07:56.677 position:21% line:89% align:start
I've gotta calm down.

00:07:56.711 --> 00:07:59.714 position:13% line:83% align:start
This is still just my life
flashing before my eyes.

00:07:59.747 --> 00:08:01.515 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Yamagishi] Well, this is weird.

00:08:01.549 --> 00:08:04.018 position:19% line:83% align:start
We can't find those
second-years anywhere.

00:08:04.051 --> 00:08:04.986 position:21% line:89% align:start
Everyone we talked to

00:08:05.019 --> 00:08:07.021 position:19% line:83% align:start
was either a first-year
or a third-year.

00:08:07.054 --> 00:08:08.289 position:27% line:89% align:start
What's going on?

00:08:08.322 --> 00:08:10.157 position:7% line:89% align:start
It's like they're avoiding us.

00:08:10.191 --> 00:08:11.359 position:19% line:89% align:start
You know what I think?

00:08:11.392 --> 00:08:12.526 position:24% line:83% align:start
They heard we were
coming for 'em

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.128 position:19% line:83% align:start
and they all freaked
out and ran for cover.

00:08:14.161 --> 00:08:15.262 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yeah you're right!

00:08:15.296 --> 00:08:17.497 position:30% line:89% align:start
(boys laughing)

00:08:17.531 --> 00:08:20.167 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] Wait, I
remember this park.

00:08:20.201 --> 00:08:23.637 position:7% line:83% align:start
Well, delinquents from Shibuya
are nothing but wannabe

00:08:23.671 --> 00:08:26.007 position:24% line:83% align:start
fancy little city
boys anyway, right?

00:08:27.975 --> 00:08:29.677 position:27% line:89% align:start
Right, Takemichi?

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:33.047 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] Huh? Fancy
little city boys?

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.150 position:30% line:89% align:start
(intense music)

00:08:36.183 --> 00:08:37.451 position:27% line:89% align:start
No, they're not!

00:08:37.485 --> 00:08:40.521 position:24% line:83% align:start
-[Kiyomasa] Hey!
-(Takemichi gasps)

00:08:43.357 --> 00:08:45.226 position:24% line:83% align:start
Are you the little
shits we heard

00:08:45.259 --> 00:08:47.061 position:27% line:83% align:start
are looking for
our second-years?

00:08:48.396 --> 00:08:50.598 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] These
guys are third-years.

00:08:51.832 --> 00:08:57.104 position:10% line:83% align:start
(inhales) Our second-years
are all away on a field trip.

00:08:57.138 --> 00:09:00.174 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] They look like
third-years in a biker gang.

00:09:00.207 --> 00:09:02.143 position:10% line:89% align:start
These guys are the real deal!

00:09:02.176 --> 00:09:04.078 position:21% line:89% align:start
Serious delinquents!

00:09:05.312 --> 00:09:07.982 position:10% line:83% align:start
We're gonna bash your little
punk faces in one by one

00:09:08.015 --> 00:09:10.084 position:35% line:89% align:start
so line up.

00:09:10.117 --> 00:09:14.755 position:13% line:83% align:start
Wait, you guys, you guys
are all third-years right?

00:09:14.789 --> 00:09:16.824 position:19% line:83% align:start
'Cause we cleared this
visit ahead of time

00:09:16.857 --> 00:09:19.026 position:21% line:83% align:start
and your boss Masaru
said it was cool.

00:09:20.294 --> 00:09:21.295 position:35% line:89% align:start
Masaru, eh?

00:09:22.129 --> 00:09:24.198 position:30% line:89% align:start
Huh? (laughing)

00:09:25.833 --> 00:09:27.435 position:19% line:89% align:start
You hear that, Masaru?

00:09:27.468 --> 00:09:29.136 position:27% line:83% align:start
Yeah, of course
I could hear him.

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:30.838 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm standing right
behind him, aren't I?

00:09:30.871 --> 00:09:32.473 position:24% line:83% align:start
Good, then you can
hear me tell you

00:09:32.507 --> 00:09:34.141 position:13% line:89% align:start
to buy us all some drinks!

00:09:34.175 --> 00:09:35.843 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uh, uh.

00:09:35.876 --> 00:09:38.245 position:13% line:89% align:start
Okay, but with what money?

00:09:38.279 --> 00:09:39.713 position:38% line:89% align:start
Say what?

00:09:39.747 --> 00:09:43.184 position:7% line:83% align:start
Well, every time my fist
meets your face, it's 100 yen!

00:09:43.217 --> 00:09:45.419 position:19% line:83% align:start
So let's see here, how
many drinks do we need?

00:09:45.453 --> 00:09:48.189 position:19% line:83% align:start
-One, two, three.
-Okay, okay, I'll pay.

00:09:48.222 --> 00:09:49.558 position:47% line:89% align:start
Eh?

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:53.528 position:19% line:89% align:start
(third-years laughing)

00:09:53.562 --> 00:09:55.296 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hey, Takemichi!

00:09:56.464 --> 00:09:58.032 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] I get it now.

00:09:58.065 --> 00:10:00.901 position:10% line:83% align:start
Masaru was nothing but their
errand-boy the whole time.

00:10:00.935 --> 00:10:04.071 position:10% line:83% align:start
He was just showing off to me
because I was a year younger.

00:10:05.773 --> 00:10:08.409 position:19% line:83% align:start
And now I remember what
happened next, too!

00:10:08.442 --> 00:10:09.777 position:27% line:83% align:start
Not only were we
scared shitless,

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:12.279 position:19% line:83% align:start
but we'd just lost our
only chance out of it!

00:10:13.147 --> 00:10:14.115 position:38% line:89% align:start
And then.

00:10:14.148 --> 00:10:15.416 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Makoto grunts)

00:10:15.449 --> 00:10:16.617 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Yamagishi grunts)

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:19.153 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Akkun grunts)

00:10:19.186 --> 00:10:22.623 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Takuya groaning)

00:10:22.656 --> 00:10:24.291 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Takuya gagging)

00:10:24.325 --> 00:10:25.626 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Takuya groaning)

00:10:25.659 --> 00:10:27.895 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Akaishi] Get up, I'm not
done kicking your ass yet!

00:10:27.928 --> 00:10:30.264 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] We got the
shit kicked out of us.

00:10:30.297 --> 00:10:31.699 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Akaishi] Come on, stand up!

00:10:34.435 --> 00:10:36.770 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Both] We're so sorry!

00:10:36.804 --> 00:10:39.807 position:16% line:83% align:start
Got a lotta nerve calling
yourselves delinquents.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.209 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're nothing but five
spineless little losers.

00:10:42.243 --> 00:10:44.579 position:21% line:83% align:start
And now you get to be
five little soldiers

00:10:44.613 --> 00:10:46.714 position:24% line:83% align:start
for the Tokyo Manji
Gang starting today!

00:10:46.747 --> 00:10:47.848 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi quivering)

00:10:47.882 --> 00:10:49.917 position:24% line:83% align:start
And you better work
your asses off too!

00:10:55.122 --> 00:10:57.725 position:30% line:89% align:start
(all groaning)

00:11:02.363 --> 00:11:03.797 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Akkun] Come on, Takemichi.

00:11:06.568 --> 00:11:08.702 position:21% line:89% align:start
The Tokyo Manji Gang.

00:11:08.736 --> 00:11:11.739 position:21% line:83% align:start
That's right. This is
where it all started.

00:11:12.973 --> 00:11:16.010 position:7% line:83% align:start
Those hellish days spent doing
whatever they told us to.

00:11:17.478 --> 00:11:18.679 position:35% line:89% align:start
All of us.

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:22.551 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's why I got the hell
away from my hometown

00:11:22.584 --> 00:11:23.884 position:7% line:89% align:start
after graduating middle school.

00:11:24.818 --> 00:11:27.188 position:16% line:83% align:start
I went to work and
started living on my own.

00:11:27.221 --> 00:11:28.657 position:33% line:89% align:start
Sorry, boss!

00:11:28.689 --> 00:11:30.391 position:24% line:83% align:start
But that didn't go
very well either.

00:11:30.424 --> 00:11:31.526 position:21% line:83% align:start
Can't you do
anything I tell you?

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:32.527 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry, boss.

00:11:32.561 --> 00:11:33.861 position:24% line:89% align:start
I just apologized.

00:11:33.894 --> 00:11:35.796 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm very sorry sir.

00:11:35.829 --> 00:11:39.634 position:13% line:89% align:start
Again and again and again!

00:11:39.668 --> 00:11:41.902 position:27% line:83% align:start
I was spending my
life apologizing.

00:11:43.437 --> 00:11:46.307 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi quivering)

00:11:48.776 --> 00:11:50.744 position:27% line:89% align:start
Damn, this sucks!

00:11:50.778 --> 00:11:52.947 position:21% line:83% align:start
My life's ending, and
I'm stuck reliving

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:54.549 position:21% line:89% align:start
the worst part of it.

00:11:54.583 --> 00:11:56.483 position:7% line:89% align:start
I hear you loud and clear, God!

00:11:56.518 --> 00:11:57.751 position:7% line:89% align:start
You're telling me that my life

00:11:57.785 --> 00:12:00.287 position:5% line:89% align:start
has been nothing but utter shit!

00:12:00.321 --> 00:12:03.724 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi sobbing)

00:12:03.757 --> 00:12:06.760 position:21% line:83% align:start
I just know you'll be
successful, Takemichi.

00:12:06.794 --> 00:12:08.829 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi quivering)

00:12:08.862 --> 00:12:09.863 position:19% line:89% align:start
The escalating dispute-

00:12:09.897 --> 00:12:11.398 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Hinata.

00:12:11.432 --> 00:12:12.866 position:21% line:89% align:start
The Tokyo Manji Gang.

00:12:14.235 --> 00:12:15.236 position:35% line:89% align:start
That's it.

00:12:16.203 --> 00:12:19.006 position:19% line:83% align:start
The reason Hinata
dies 12 years from now

00:12:19.039 --> 00:12:20.241 position:19% line:89% align:start
is all because of them.

00:12:23.477 --> 00:12:25.012 position:10% line:89% align:start
But I guess that's just fate.

00:12:25.045 --> 00:12:27.047 position:19% line:83% align:start
It doesn't have
anything to do with me.

00:12:30.585 --> 00:12:33.387 position:27% line:83% align:start
But wait! What if
Hinata could...

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:38.759 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Makoto] You okay, Takuya?

00:12:38.792 --> 00:12:41.663 position:24% line:83% align:start
You guys better not
tell anyone I cried.

00:12:41.696 --> 00:12:42.830 position:24% line:89% align:start
Quit your bitching.

00:12:43.698 --> 00:12:46.967 position:19% line:89% align:start
(train tracks clacking)

00:12:48.536 --> 00:12:50.004 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Makoto] Man, I'm starving.

00:12:50.037 --> 00:12:52.707 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Yamagishi] Yeah, I
need some katsudon.

00:12:52.741 --> 00:12:55.009 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Takuya] I can't eat. My
mouth's all busted up.

00:12:59.246 --> 00:13:00.515 position:35% line:89% align:start
Takemichi?

00:13:00.548 --> 00:13:02.049 position:10% line:89% align:start
What's wrong with you, dude?

00:13:05.486 --> 00:13:08.255 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry, but I gotta go!

00:13:08.289 --> 00:13:09.957 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Akkun] Huh? Go where?

00:13:11.292 --> 00:13:12.092 position:35% line:89% align:start
[All] Huh?

00:13:13.662 --> 00:13:15.796 position:30% line:89% align:start
(gentle music)

00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:18.465 position:10% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi heavily breathing)

00:13:18.499 --> 00:13:19.500 position:30% line:89% align:start
I've forgotten.

00:13:20.602 --> 00:13:22.303 position:7% line:89% align:start
What did Hinata even look like?

00:13:25.774 --> 00:13:30.978 position:16% line:83% align:start
-(Takemichi panting)
-(gentle music continues)

00:13:32.146 --> 00:13:32.946 position:35% line:89% align:start
This is it.

00:13:34.348 --> 00:13:35.949 position:21% line:89% align:start
Tachibana. Tachibana.

00:13:37.686 --> 00:13:38.886 position:35% line:89% align:start
Here it is.

00:13:48.395 --> 00:13:51.365 position:24% line:89% align:start
(doorbell ringing)

00:13:52.466 --> 00:13:53.568 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Hinata] Who is it?

00:13:53.601 --> 00:13:55.570 position:19% line:89% align:start
Takemichi, is that you?

00:13:55.603 --> 00:13:56.870 position:33% line:89% align:start
Uh, yeah, hi.

00:13:58.573 --> 00:14:00.608 position:10% line:89% align:start
Her voice. It's so familiar.

00:14:02.109 --> 00:14:03.511 position:19% line:89% align:start
I wasn't expecting you.

00:14:03.545 --> 00:14:04.845 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasps)

00:14:04.878 --> 00:14:06.347 position:16% line:89% align:start
Were you fighting again?

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:09.350 position:16% line:83% align:start
When will you learn? You
can't keep doing that.

00:14:09.383 --> 00:14:11.485 position:16% line:83% align:start
It was just last week
that you got into a fight

00:14:11.519 --> 00:14:13.187 position:27% line:89% align:start
that was so dumb.

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:16.457 position:13% line:83% align:start
But are you okay? That
looks like it really hurt.

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:19.493 position:10% line:83% align:start
Let me bring you some ice
before it swells up any more,

00:14:19.527 --> 00:14:22.630 position:13% line:83% align:start
and I'll get you some
disinfectant and a bandage.

00:14:22.664 --> 00:14:25.966 position:16% line:89% align:start
Good to see you, Hinata.

00:14:32.406 --> 00:14:34.509 position:24% line:89% align:start
(soft piano music)

00:14:34.542 --> 00:14:36.043 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's all right.

00:14:38.445 --> 00:14:41.415 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's just I don't know
why I'm crying but...

00:14:42.316 --> 00:14:45.252 position:7% line:89% align:start
Sorry, I'll go now. Good night.

00:14:45.285 --> 00:14:47.622 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Hinata] Wait, what happened?

00:14:47.655 --> 00:14:48.922 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] I just,

00:14:48.956 --> 00:14:51.559 position:21% line:83% align:start
I just wanted to
see you, that's all.

00:14:51.593 --> 00:14:53.828 position:7% line:89% align:start
Don't lie! Something happened.

00:14:53.862 --> 00:14:55.630 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're not acting
like yourself at all.

00:15:02.336 --> 00:15:03.103 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:15:03.137 --> 00:15:04.572 position:19% line:89% align:start
Just tell me the truth.

00:15:04.606 --> 00:15:07.207 position:16% line:83% align:start
I want to know everything
about you understand?

00:15:08.375 --> 00:15:09.878 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:12.913 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm your girlfriend,
you know. Dummy.

00:15:13.914 --> 00:15:14.915 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Sorry.

00:15:16.283 --> 00:15:20.020 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's right. She was
always getting mad at me.

00:15:20.053 --> 00:15:23.190 position:24% line:83% align:start
She was small, but
so strong-willed.

00:15:23.223 --> 00:15:24.692 position:21% line:83% align:start
-(Takemichi sobbing)
-[Hinata] Bye-bye.

00:15:24.726 --> 00:15:26.093 position:13% line:89% align:start
See you at school tomorrow.

00:15:28.429 --> 00:15:29.697 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] I always
loved the cheerful way

00:15:29.731 --> 00:15:30.998 position:24% line:89% align:start
she'd say bye-bye,

00:15:32.499 --> 00:15:33.568 position:33% line:89% align:start
and yet I...

00:15:38.405 --> 00:15:40.073 position:30% line:89% align:start
(sobs) Damn it.

00:15:42.976 --> 00:15:44.846 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Bully] Come on, is
that all you've got?

00:15:44.879 --> 00:15:46.313 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Bully] Don't hold out on us!
-Huh?

00:15:46.346 --> 00:15:48.982 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Bully] Let's hear you
jump and down, squirt.

00:15:49.016 --> 00:15:53.822 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Bully] (chuckling) See,
you did have more money.

00:15:53.855 --> 00:15:55.322 position:19% line:89% align:start
Shut up, you dumbasses!

00:15:55.355 --> 00:15:58.025 position:5% line:83% align:start
Can't you see I'm trying to
have a sentimental moment here?

00:15:58.058 --> 00:15:59.293 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hurry it up, junior.

00:15:59.326 --> 00:16:01.328 position:27% line:83% align:start
Quit stalling and
cough up the cash.

00:16:01.361 --> 00:16:02.329 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Hey!

00:16:02.362 --> 00:16:03.130 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Bullies] Huh?

00:16:03.163 --> 00:16:04.364 position:13% line:89% align:start
Shut the hell up, assholes!

00:16:04.398 --> 00:16:05.966 position:30% line:89% align:start
(bully groans)

00:16:05.999 --> 00:16:08.335 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi panting)

00:16:08.368 --> 00:16:09.637 position:33% line:89% align:start
(all gasping)

00:16:09.671 --> 00:16:11.806 position:13% line:83% align:start
You just can't quit running
your mouths, can you?

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:13.407 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yapping and yapping and yapping.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:14.909 position:16% line:83% align:start
-(glass bottle shatters)
-(all gasping)

00:16:14.943 --> 00:16:16.911 position:30% line:89% align:start
At this moment,

00:16:16.945 --> 00:16:19.747 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm in about the
shittiest mood possible!

00:16:19.781 --> 00:16:23.083 position:10% line:89% align:start
So piss off or I'll kill you.

00:16:23.116 --> 00:16:24.284 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Bully] Okay, okay!

00:16:24.318 --> 00:16:26.521 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Bully] No problem
dude, we're outta here!

00:16:27.988 --> 00:16:29.490 position:19% line:89% align:start
(glass bottle rattles)

00:16:29.524 --> 00:16:30.525 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:16:32.459 --> 00:16:34.361 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hey, wait a sec!

00:16:34.394 --> 00:16:35.462 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:16:35.496 --> 00:16:37.164 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Naoto] It's really dangerous
to leave that there.

00:16:37.197 --> 00:16:38.700 position:16% line:89% align:start
Somebody could get hurt.

00:16:39.868 --> 00:16:42.069 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh, you're right.

00:16:44.104 --> 00:16:46.273 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Naoto] Uh, thank you
for helping me out.

00:16:48.943 --> 00:16:51.779 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi sighs)

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.481 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'll give you some advice

00:16:54.516 --> 00:16:56.216 position:24% line:83% align:start
for when guys like
that hassle you.

00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:58.520 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's like this.

00:16:58.553 --> 00:17:01.589 position:10% line:83% align:start
You gotta be prepared to
get hit but never back down.

00:17:01.623 --> 00:17:02.857 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, huh?

00:17:02.891 --> 00:17:04.057 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:17:04.091 --> 00:17:06.193 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh, you don't need
to take notes.

00:17:06.226 --> 00:17:07.695 position:13% line:89% align:start
You just face them head on.

00:17:08.897 --> 00:17:10.130 position:24% line:83% align:start
That's usually
enough to scare off

00:17:10.163 --> 00:17:11.966 position:27% line:83% align:start
half-assed punks
like those three.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.166 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, yeah!

00:17:14.903 --> 00:17:16.470 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] Courage
and confidence.

00:17:16.504 --> 00:17:19.106 position:19% line:83% align:start
In other words, all the
qualities I never had.

00:17:20.073 --> 00:17:22.810 position:13% line:89% align:start
So, what's your name, kid?

00:17:22.844 --> 00:17:25.045 position:30% line:89% align:start
Uh, Tachibana.

00:17:25.078 --> 00:17:27.047 position:27% line:89% align:start
Naoto Tachibana.

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:29.884 position:10% line:83% align:start
What? Did you say Tachibana,
like as in Hinata?

00:17:29.918 --> 00:17:32.020 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yeah, Hinata's my sister.

00:17:32.052 --> 00:17:33.220 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] The hell, man?

00:17:33.253 --> 00:17:35.023 position:5% line:89% align:start
You shoulda told me that sooner!

00:17:35.055 --> 00:17:36.724 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Naoto] Oh, are you
friends with Hinata?

00:17:36.758 --> 00:17:37.825 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's cool.

00:17:39.761 --> 00:17:41.729 position:27% line:89% align:start
Naoto Tachibana.

00:17:41.763 --> 00:17:45.198 position:13% line:83% align:start
That's right. In 12 years,
he's going to die, too.

00:17:46.333 --> 00:17:50.404 position:10% line:83% align:start
My name's Takemichi Hanagaki.
First name's enough.

00:17:50.437 --> 00:17:52.640 position:7% line:89% align:start
Oh okay. Not just yet, though.

00:17:53.942 --> 00:17:55.142 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] Do you
like your sister?

00:17:55.175 --> 00:17:56.911 position:7% line:89% align:start
Huh? Where did that come from?

00:17:56.945 --> 00:17:58.412 position:7% line:89% align:start
No, of course I don't like her!

00:17:58.445 --> 00:18:00.615 position:10% line:89% align:start
You don't like her? Why not?

00:18:00.648 --> 00:18:03.150 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Naoto] Because she's
always bossing me around

00:18:03.183 --> 00:18:05.687 position:19% line:83% align:start
and stuff, and
telling me what to do!

00:18:06.621 --> 00:18:07.555 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yeah I see.

00:18:08.623 --> 00:18:12.694 position:16% line:83% align:start
But all the same, you
oughta take care of her.

00:18:12.727 --> 00:18:14.127 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:18:14.161 --> 00:18:17.431 position:19% line:83% align:start
Fact is I'm totally in
love with your sister.

00:18:19.366 --> 00:18:21.636 position:19% line:83% align:start
I love her so much
that I hardly even know

00:18:21.669 --> 00:18:22.737 position:19% line:89% align:start
what to do with myself.

00:18:23.805 --> 00:18:26.373 position:10% line:89% align:start
I just remembered that today.

00:18:26.406 --> 00:18:27.407 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:18:28.475 --> 00:18:31.111 position:21% line:83% align:start
Ha! I guess you
wouldn't understand.

00:18:34.983 --> 00:18:39.654 position:10% line:83% align:start
This is gonna sound crazy,
but on this very day in 2017,

00:18:39.687 --> 00:18:42.456 position:10% line:83% align:start
I fell off a platform and
right onto the train tracks.

00:18:42.489 --> 00:18:45.994 position:5% line:83% align:start
I thought I was dead, but
suddenly I was in middle school.

00:18:46.027 --> 00:18:48.062 position:27% line:83% align:start
I was me from 12
years ago again.

00:18:48.096 --> 00:18:49.897 position:21% line:83% align:start
What do you call
something like that?

00:18:49.931 --> 00:18:50.898 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's time travel.

00:18:50.932 --> 00:18:53.266 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yeah, exactly!

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:55.670 position:10% line:83% align:start
Of course, it's also possible
I might just be having

00:18:55.703 --> 00:18:56.604 position:27% line:89% align:start
a long-ass dream.

00:18:58.506 --> 00:19:01.141 position:21% line:83% align:start
But you know, I think
what really happened

00:19:01.174 --> 00:19:04.144 position:16% line:83% align:start
is that God wanted me to
see Hinata one last time.

00:19:04.177 --> 00:19:06.179 position:7% line:89% align:start
Huh? What do you mean by that?

00:19:07.882 --> 00:19:10.718 position:7% line:89% align:start
On July 1st 12 years from now,

00:19:10.752 --> 00:19:13.621 position:10% line:89% align:start
your sister Hinata will die.

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:19.560 position:19% line:83% align:start
And that's also the day
you're going to die.

00:19:19.594 --> 00:19:21.596 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Naoto gasps)

00:19:21.629 --> 00:19:23.798 position:30% line:89% align:start
July 1st, 2017,

00:19:24.932 --> 00:19:26.366 position:13% line:89% align:start
remember that date, Naoto!

00:19:27.234 --> 00:19:29.269 position:5% line:89% align:start
You can save your sister's life!

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:33.107 position:16% line:83% align:start
Sorry to lay all this on
you at one time, dude.

00:19:33.141 --> 00:19:34.742 position:24% line:83% align:start
I know it's pretty
hard to believe.

00:19:36.944 --> 00:19:38.478 position:10% line:89% align:start
If this is really happening,

00:19:38.513 --> 00:19:40.313 position:24% line:83% align:start
then I want to
change the future.

00:19:41.481 --> 00:19:43.818 position:21% line:83% align:start
I fell so far that I
forgot about Hinata

00:19:43.851 --> 00:19:45.687 position:16% line:89% align:start
until I heard she'd died.

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:49.791 position:10% line:83% align:start
I was feeling pathetic,
frustrated, sorry for myself.

00:19:49.824 --> 00:19:53.360 position:19% line:83% align:start
But now I wanna do all
of this over again.

00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:57.799 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm counting on you.

00:19:57.832 --> 00:20:00.668 position:27% line:89% align:start
(momentous music)

00:20:04.906 --> 00:20:06.339 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Naoto] Okay, I'll do it.

00:20:20.755 --> 00:20:21.889 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Worker] He's awake!

00:20:21.923 --> 00:20:22.890 position:35% line:89% align:start
Where am I?

00:20:22.924 --> 00:20:24.892 position:30% line:89% align:start
What day is it?

00:20:24.926 --> 00:20:26.359 position:5% line:89% align:start
We brought you to the infirmary.

00:20:26.393 --> 00:20:29.262 position:13% line:83% align:start
You fell from the platform
onto the train tracks.

00:20:30.865 --> 00:20:32.232 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:20:32.265 --> 00:20:35.235 position:30% line:89% align:start
July 4th, 2017?

00:20:35.268 --> 00:20:37.304 position:5% line:89% align:start
Was that all just a dream, then?

00:20:38.106 --> 00:20:39.239 position:44% line:89% align:start
Wait!

00:20:39.272 --> 00:20:40.808 position:21% line:89% align:start
I remember the train!

00:20:40.842 --> 00:20:43.243 position:21% line:83% align:start
There's no way I
coulda survived that!

00:20:43.276 --> 00:20:45.445 position:10% line:89% align:start
I don't have a scratch on me!

00:20:45.479 --> 00:20:46.681 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Naoto] Could I
have some time alone

00:20:46.714 --> 00:20:47.682 position:24% line:89% align:start
to speak with him?

00:20:47.715 --> 00:20:48.883 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Sure.

00:20:48.916 --> 00:20:50.084 position:19% line:89% align:start
You ought to thank him.

00:20:50.118 --> 00:20:51.986 position:21% line:83% align:start
This is the man that
saved your life.

00:20:52.019 --> 00:20:53.020 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:20:54.155 --> 00:20:55.355 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's been a while.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.628 position:33% line:89% align:start
Who are you?

00:21:00.661 --> 00:21:02.096 position:27% line:89% align:start
Naoto Tachibana.

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:03.664 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:21:03.698 --> 00:21:07.001 position:21% line:83% align:start
That day, you changed
the course of my life.

00:21:07.034 --> 00:21:08.870 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Huh? That day?

00:21:08.903 --> 00:21:10.972 position:24% line:89% align:start
But wait, you died!

00:21:12.106 --> 00:21:13.741 position:21% line:83% align:start
You traveled through
time that day.

00:21:15.442 --> 00:21:17.245 position:19% line:89% align:start
That's how I survived.

00:21:17.277 --> 00:21:19.747 position:21% line:83% align:start
That's how I could
be here to save you.

00:21:19.781 --> 00:21:23.316 position:13% line:83% align:start
You changed the present
by traveling through time!

00:21:23.985 --> 00:21:26.587 position:30% line:89% align:start
(lively music)

00:21:28.623 --> 00:21:32.760 position:10% line:83% align:start
Takemichi, 12 years ago today
this is what you told me.

00:21:34.095 --> 00:21:35.763 position:13% line:89% align:start
Remember that date, Naoto.

00:21:36.964 --> 00:21:38.666 position:5% line:89% align:start
You can save your sister's life.

00:21:40.234 --> 00:21:43.370 position:16% line:83% align:start
I studied hard in school
and I became a cop

00:21:44.906 --> 00:21:46.207 position:16% line:89% align:start
in order to protect her.

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.408 position:13% line:89% align:start
Wait! Then Hinata is alive?

00:21:50.878 --> 00:21:52.379 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry, Takemichi.

00:21:53.881 --> 00:21:55.917 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hinata has died.

00:21:58.252 --> 00:22:00.387 position:21% line:83% align:start
I did everything that
I could think of!

00:22:01.222 --> 00:22:03.057 position:38% line:89% align:start
But. But.

00:22:04.424 --> 00:22:07.094 position:7% line:89% align:start
Takemichi, you've got to help!

00:22:07.128 --> 00:22:09.997 position:10% line:89% align:start
I just know you can save her!

00:22:11.699 --> 00:22:15.036 position:13% line:89% align:start
You want me to save Hinata?

00:22:18.005 --> 00:22:19.106 position:21% line:89% align:start
(upbeat theme music)

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:23.811 position:7% line:89% align:start
(vocalists singing in Japanese)
