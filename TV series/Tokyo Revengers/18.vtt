00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:09.443 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Nobutaka] Kisaki's goal

00:00:09.476 --> 00:00:12.112 position:19% line:83% align:start
was to use other people
to get Draken killed

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:14.114 position:7% line:89% align:start
in the Battle of August Third.

00:00:14.147 --> 00:00:15.617 position:10% line:89% align:start
And then with that seat open

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.919 position:13% line:83% align:start
he could take over himself
as Toman's number two!

00:00:17.952 --> 00:00:19.019 position:21% line:89% align:start
(footsteps thudding)

00:00:19.052 --> 00:00:21.723 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Chifuyu] The leader
no one knew about!

00:00:21.756 --> 00:00:25.292 position:10% line:89% align:start
And his name is Tetta Kisaki!

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:27.829 position:24% line:83% align:start
And currently,
Kisaki is in Toman,

00:00:27.862 --> 00:00:30.097 position:5% line:89% align:start
which means the throne is empty!

00:00:30.532 --> 00:00:31.699 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:32.867 position:24% line:89% align:start
If that's the case.

00:00:32.901 --> 00:00:34.702 position:27% line:89% align:start
(train chuffing)

00:00:34.736 --> 00:00:35.970 position:24% line:89% align:start
(lightning strikes)

00:00:36.004 --> 00:00:38.238 position:13% line:89% align:start
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:00:38.272 --> 00:00:41.809 position:16% line:83% align:start
Do you remember the gang
they called Valhalla?

00:00:41.843 --> 00:00:44.077 position:27% line:83% align:start
They had a leader
no one knew right?

00:00:44.111 --> 00:00:46.781 position:21% line:83% align:start
And their leader was
Kisaki wasn't it?

00:00:47.615 --> 00:00:48.783 position:33% line:89% align:start
No it wasn't.

00:00:48.816 --> 00:00:50.050 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:53.453 position:24% line:83% align:start
The guy who led
Valhalla was Mikey.

00:00:53.487 --> 00:00:54.488 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:56.758 position:16% line:89% align:start
Valhalla was put together

00:00:56.791 --> 00:00:58.492 position:19% line:89% align:start
specifically for Mikey.

00:00:58.526 --> 00:01:00.060 position:30% line:89% align:start
There's no way!

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:01.128 position:35% line:89% align:start
Impossible!

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:02.964 position:13% line:89% align:start
Mikey is the head of Toman!

00:01:02.997 --> 00:01:05.833 position:27% line:83% align:start
Toman was taken
over by Valhalla.

00:01:05.867 --> 00:01:07.401 position:24% line:83% align:start
And it was reformed
with Valhalla

00:01:07.434 --> 00:01:09.837 position:13% line:89% align:start
as its parent organization.

00:01:09.871 --> 00:01:11.204 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's the current Toman.

00:01:12.406 --> 00:01:15.009 position:19% line:83% align:start
That was the first time
Toman ever lost a fight.

00:01:15.043 --> 00:01:16.410 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:17.512 position:38% line:89% align:start
Even now,

00:01:17.545 --> 00:01:20.447 position:21% line:83% align:start
I wonder why I didn't
realize it at the time

00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:23.685 position:7% line:89% align:start
the heavy cross that he carried

00:01:23.718 --> 00:01:25.352 position:19% line:89% align:start
with him all the time.

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:28.155 position:19% line:83% align:start
Even though he was
only a 15-year-old kid.

00:01:29.791 --> 00:01:33.061 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Mikey panting)

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:36.531 position:21% line:83% align:start
On that day Mikey
went after Kazutora.

00:01:37.865 --> 00:01:38.866 position:24% line:89% align:start
And he killed him.

00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:43.303 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi grunting)

00:01:43.337 --> 00:01:45.172 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi slouching)

00:01:45.205 --> 00:01:47.875 position:19% line:83% align:start
Mikey was never
charged with it though.

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.276 position:10% line:89% align:start
(ominous instrumental music)

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:52.714 position:24% line:83% align:start
Because Kisaki had
set up someone else

00:01:52.747 --> 00:01:55.115 position:16% line:89% align:start
to take the fall for him.

00:01:55.148 --> 00:01:59.152 position:24% line:83% align:start
After that, Mikey
fell into darkness.

00:01:59.186 --> 00:02:02.189 position:24% line:83% align:start
And Toman was taken
over by Valhalla.

00:02:02.222 --> 00:02:03.725 position:16% line:89% align:start
That was when it expanded

00:02:03.758 --> 00:02:05.827 position:16% line:89% align:start
into a giant organization

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.394 position:10% line:89% align:start
with Mikey as the commander,

00:02:07.427 --> 00:02:10.297 position:21% line:83% align:start
and Tetta Kisaki as
the acting commander.

00:02:11.766 --> 00:02:13.300 position:27% line:89% align:start
Looking back now,

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:15.302 position:7% line:89% align:start
the reason Kisaki joined Toman

00:02:16.436 --> 00:02:19.339 position:19% line:83% align:start
was probably because
of Mikey to begin with.

00:02:19.373 --> 00:02:20.140 position:44% line:89% align:start
Whoa.

00:02:20.173 --> 00:02:21.609 position:13% line:89% align:start
Wait you can't be serious!

00:02:21.643 --> 00:02:24.411 position:21% line:83% align:start
I could never believe
Mikey kill Kazutora!

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:26.914 position:27% line:89% align:start
(glass pounding)

00:02:26.948 --> 00:02:28.148 position:30% line:89% align:start
There's no way!

00:02:29.651 --> 00:02:32.319 position:21% line:83% align:start
I know Mikey and he'd
never kill anyone!

00:02:32.352 --> 00:02:33.621 position:19% line:89% align:start
Can you say for certain

00:02:33.655 --> 00:02:36.289 position:21% line:83% align:start
that if you had been
in Mikey's position,

00:02:36.323 --> 00:02:39.393 position:16% line:83% align:start
that you wouldn't have
killed Kazutora yourself?

00:02:39.426 --> 00:02:41.829 position:16% line:83% align:start
The guy who had murdered
your own brother?

00:02:41.863 --> 00:02:43.163 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasping)

00:02:43.196 --> 00:02:44.231 position:27% line:89% align:start
And on that day,

00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:46.701 position:21% line:89% align:start
Baji was killed too,

00:02:46.734 --> 00:02:47.835 position:19% line:89% align:start
right in front of him.

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:49.003 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:02:49.037 --> 00:02:52.674 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasping)

00:02:52.707 --> 00:02:53.708 position:24% line:89% align:start
How could Kazutora

00:02:55.208 --> 00:02:57.045 position:27% line:89% align:start
have killed Baji?

00:02:57.078 --> 00:02:59.847 position:21% line:83% align:start
You saw it with your
own eyes Takemichi.

00:02:59.881 --> 00:03:02.917 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasping)

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.654 position:10% line:89% align:start
(ominous instrumental music)

00:03:08.022 --> 00:03:10.825 position:24% line:83% align:start
How the hell could
this have happened?

00:03:15.897 --> 00:03:20.702 position:21% line:83% align:start
(opening theme music)

00:04:50.323 --> 00:04:51.893 position:35% line:89% align:start
(car revs)

00:04:51.926 --> 00:04:54.829 position:21% line:5% align:start
(footsteps thudding)

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.400 position:21% line:89% align:start
(footsteps thudding)

00:05:01.836 --> 00:05:04.972 position:16% line:83% align:start
The Mikey I know would
never have killed anyone.

00:05:05.006 --> 00:05:06.941 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Naoto grunts)

00:05:06.974 --> 00:05:09.342 position:7% line:89% align:start
I know this, I believe in him.

00:05:10.178 --> 00:05:11.612 position:33% line:89% align:start
(car revving)

00:05:11.646 --> 00:05:13.815 position:27% line:83% align:start
But when Draken
was talking to me

00:05:13.848 --> 00:05:15.950 position:24% line:83% align:start
I could see what he
was talking about.

00:05:15.983 --> 00:05:17.518 position:16% line:89% align:start
I kept getting glimpses.

00:05:18.686 --> 00:05:21.589 position:19% line:83% align:start
I have no idea why I'm
seeing these things!

00:05:21.622 --> 00:05:23.490 position:16% line:83% align:start
But my head's just
filling up with memories

00:05:23.524 --> 00:05:25.092 position:13% line:89% align:start
that I shouldn't even have!

00:05:25.126 --> 00:05:26.093 position:16% line:89% align:start
(soft instrumental music)

00:05:26.127 --> 00:05:27.929 position:13% line:89% align:start
Baji's body on the ground.

00:05:27.962 --> 00:05:30.164 position:19% line:89% align:start
Kazutora on the ground!

00:05:30.198 --> 00:05:31.833 position:13% line:89% align:start
And Mikey covered in blood!

00:05:33.501 --> 00:05:36.403 position:13% line:83% align:start
I have no idea if all
these images are even real!

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:39.874 position:24% line:83% align:start
But after seeing
the devastated look

00:05:39.907 --> 00:05:41.242 position:27% line:89% align:start
on Mikey's face,

00:05:41.275 --> 00:05:42.743 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi sobbing)

00:05:42.777 --> 00:05:44.278 position:41% line:89% align:start
I know,

00:05:44.312 --> 00:05:46.113 position:24% line:83% align:start
I know I just have
to save Mikey!

00:05:47.915 --> 00:05:49.349 position:30% line:89% align:start
Oh, Takemichi.

00:05:49.382 --> 00:05:52.587 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi sobbing)

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.487 position:7% line:89% align:start
The Battle on Bloody Halloween

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:58.059 position:13% line:89% align:start
resulted in Toman's defeat.

00:05:58.092 --> 00:06:00.094 position:10% line:89% align:start
Because Manjiro Sano ended up

00:06:00.127 --> 00:06:02.897 position:10% line:89% align:start
murdering Kazutora Hanemiya.

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.267 position:21% line:83% align:start
We think Tetta Kisaki
was behind it all.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.169 position:24% line:83% align:start
Mikey was the one
who killed Kazutora

00:06:08.202 --> 00:06:09.971 position:24% line:83% align:start
because he was
very close with...

00:06:10.004 --> 00:06:11.205 position:35% line:89% align:start
With Baji,

00:06:11.239 --> 00:06:13.373 position:5% line:89% align:start
and Baji was killed by Kazutora!

00:06:13.406 --> 00:06:15.543 position:19% line:89% align:start
So I have to save Baji!

00:06:15.576 --> 00:06:18.378 position:19% line:83% align:start
And then Mikey won't
make this huge mistake!

00:06:18.411 --> 00:06:19.981 position:27% line:83% align:start
And we'll be able
to short-circuit

00:06:20.014 --> 00:06:21.983 position:30% line:89% align:start
Kisaki's plot.

00:06:22.016 --> 00:06:24.252 position:21% line:89% align:start
Protect Keisuke Baji.

00:06:24.285 --> 00:06:26.320 position:24% line:83% align:start
That's your new
mission Takemichi.

00:06:26.354 --> 00:06:27.889 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Right!

00:06:27.922 --> 00:06:29.557 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Naoto sighs)

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.525 position:7% line:89% align:start
First Draken and now this guy.

00:06:31.559 --> 00:06:33.961 position:21% line:83% align:start
I guess this is how
it's gonna be for us.

00:06:33.995 --> 00:06:35.963 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yeah but we'll get
this done in no time.

00:06:35.997 --> 00:06:39.133 position:5% line:83% align:start
(Naoto laughs) You say that like
you think it's going to be easy.

00:06:39.166 --> 00:06:42.036 position:13% line:83% align:start
I think this one's going to
be a very difficult mission.

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:43.037 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:44.238 position:35% line:89% align:start
Forget it.

00:06:44.272 --> 00:06:46.941 position:21% line:89% align:start
(footsteps thudding)

00:06:46.974 --> 00:06:48.743 position:24% line:89% align:start
Just do your best.

00:06:48.776 --> 00:06:50.410 position:41% line:89% align:start
I will!

00:06:50.443 --> 00:06:51.612 position:13% line:89% align:start
You're actually turning out

00:06:51.646 --> 00:06:53.681 position:24% line:83% align:start
to be an amazing
person, Takemichi.

00:06:55.116 --> 00:06:57.919 position:10% line:89% align:start
Well I guess I'm off, Naoto.

00:06:57.952 --> 00:06:59.153 position:27% line:89% align:start
(hands clasping)

00:06:59.186 --> 00:07:01.255 position:24% line:89% align:start
(lightning strikes)

00:07:01.289 --> 00:07:02.256 position:30% line:89% align:start
(air swooshing)

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:03.858 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mikey,

00:07:03.891 --> 00:07:04.692 position:38% line:89% align:start
and Baji,

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.129 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna protect them
both, no matter what!

00:07:10.631 --> 00:07:14.135 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi startling)

00:07:14.168 --> 00:07:16.037 position:7% line:89% align:start
Thank you for walking me home.

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:17.772 position:16% line:89% align:start
Wait here, just one sec.

00:07:17.805 --> 00:07:19.774 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, mm-hm.

00:07:19.807 --> 00:07:20.975 position:33% line:89% align:start
(door closes)

00:07:21.008 --> 00:07:23.277 position:19% line:89% align:start
Geez that was a shock!

00:07:23.311 --> 00:07:25.246 position:7% line:89% align:start
All of a sudden I'm with Hina!

00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:27.248 position:27% line:83% align:start
Were we walking
home from school?

00:07:27.281 --> 00:07:28.249 position:30% line:89% align:start
(door opening)

00:07:28.282 --> 00:07:29.250 position:21% line:89% align:start
(footsteps thudding)

00:07:29.283 --> 00:07:30.918 position:30% line:89% align:start
(door closing)

00:07:30.952 --> 00:07:32.386 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Hina laughs)

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.121 position:10% line:89% align:start
Take this. I got you a gift.

00:07:34.155 --> 00:07:35.156 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:07:36.357 --> 00:07:39.360 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's just something
I wanted you to have.

00:07:39.393 --> 00:07:41.195 position:16% line:89% align:start
But what's the occasion?

00:07:41.228 --> 00:07:42.730 position:27% line:89% align:start
Should I open it?

00:07:42.763 --> 00:07:44.031 position:35% line:89% align:start
Of course!

00:07:44.065 --> 00:07:46.133 position:30% line:89% align:start
(bag rustling)

00:07:46.167 --> 00:07:49.837 position:24% line:89% align:start
(necklace rustling)

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:50.838 position:27% line:89% align:start
Four-leaf clover.

00:07:52.273 --> 00:07:54.041 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's just like the
one I gave you.

00:07:56.077 --> 00:07:57.178 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Hina chuckles)

00:07:57.211 --> 00:07:58.612 position:19% line:89% align:start
So now we match, right?

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.682 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi trembling)

00:08:01.716 --> 00:08:04.218 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Hinata's Mom] She
seemed to really love it.

00:08:04.251 --> 00:08:05.553 position:16% line:89% align:start
I know she always kept it

00:08:05.586 --> 00:08:07.989 position:16% line:89% align:start
very close to her heart.

00:08:08.022 --> 00:08:11.092 position:24% line:83% align:start
She must have loved
you very much.

00:08:11.125 --> 00:08:14.295 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi weeping)

00:08:14.328 --> 00:08:16.597 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi crying)

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:19.100 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hey, nothing to cry over!

00:08:19.133 --> 00:08:20.801 position:27% line:89% align:start
I was not crying!

00:08:20.835 --> 00:08:21.802 position:41% line:89% align:start
Oh, no?

00:08:21.836 --> 00:08:24.005 position:16% line:83% align:start
Takemichi, you're always
crying you know that?

00:08:26.007 --> 00:08:27.508 position:27% line:89% align:start
Thanks for this.

00:08:27.541 --> 00:08:28.943 position:27% line:89% align:start
I like it a lot.

00:08:28.976 --> 00:08:29.977 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:08:31.379 --> 00:08:32.980 position:44% line:89% align:start
Good!

00:08:33.014 --> 00:08:33.981 position:35% line:89% align:start
It's funny,

00:08:34.015 --> 00:08:35.716 position:16% line:83% align:start
but sometimes you look
really mature, Takemichi

00:08:36.851 --> 00:08:37.818 position:41% line:89% align:start
Really?

00:08:37.852 --> 00:08:38.853 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mm-hm.

00:08:39.987 --> 00:08:42.356 position:27% line:89% align:start
(train whistling)

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:44.525 position:27% line:89% align:start
(train chuffing)

00:08:44.558 --> 00:08:47.561 position:21% line:89% align:start
(footsteps thudding)

00:08:50.865 --> 00:08:53.534 position:19% line:83% align:start
Why'd you wanna meet up
with me all of a sudden?

00:08:55.336 --> 00:08:56.537 position:27% line:89% align:start
Been a while huh?

00:08:57.338 --> 00:08:58.305 position:38% line:89% align:start
Kazutora.

00:08:58.339 --> 00:09:01.142 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Kazutora chuckle)

00:09:01.175 --> 00:09:02.209 position:27% line:89% align:start
(footsteps thuds)

00:09:02.243 --> 00:09:05.312 position:10% line:89% align:start
Why don't we stop this fight?

00:09:05.346 --> 00:09:06.480 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Kazutora startling)

00:09:06.515 --> 00:09:09.183 position:24% line:83% align:start
Because win or lose
against you guys,

00:09:09.216 --> 00:09:10.718 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm not gonna be happy.

00:09:12.521 --> 00:09:14.822 position:7% line:89% align:start
I just don't get it, Kazutora.

00:09:14.855 --> 00:09:17.158 position:24% line:83% align:start
Why the hell do you
hate Mikey so much?

00:09:18.292 --> 00:09:20.194 position:7% line:89% align:start
Mikey spoke up in your defense

00:09:20.227 --> 00:09:21.195 position:19% line:89% align:start
when you were arrested.

00:09:22.563 --> 00:09:24.799 position:19% line:83% align:start
He's the reason you
got out of juvie early.

00:09:25.966 --> 00:09:27.101 position:27% line:83% align:start
Do you have any
idea how he trie-

00:09:27.134 --> 00:09:28.135 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Kazutora] Shut up.

00:09:29.303 --> 00:09:31.372 position:27% line:89% align:start
Two whole years.

00:09:31.405 --> 00:09:33.340 position:7% line:89% align:start
That's how long I spent there.

00:09:33.374 --> 00:09:35.443 position:13% line:89% align:start
Rotting in that jail cell.

00:09:35.476 --> 00:09:38.446 position:16% line:89% align:start
(soft instrumental music)

00:09:38.479 --> 00:09:41.015 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm not the guy
that I was before.

00:09:41.048 --> 00:09:43.617 position:16% line:83% align:start
Maybe not but you're
still a part of my crew.

00:09:45.252 --> 00:09:48.789 position:10% line:89% align:start
(ominous instrumental music)

00:09:54.563 --> 00:09:57.698 position:21% line:89% align:start
(footsteps thudding)

00:09:57.731 --> 00:09:59.266 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's exactly what I don't like

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:00.935 position:24% line:89% align:start
about you, Draken.

00:10:00.968 --> 00:10:03.137 position:21% line:83% align:start
We're going to crush
Toman in battle

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:04.772 position:19% line:89% align:start
the day after tomorrow.

00:10:04.805 --> 00:10:07.074 position:21% line:83% align:start
Kazutora this is not
what Mikey wants!

00:10:08.442 --> 00:10:10.545 position:10% line:89% align:start
(ominous instrumental music)

00:10:10.579 --> 00:10:13.647 position:21% line:89% align:start

(water flowing)

00:10:23.157 --> 00:10:25.826 position:30% line:89% align:start
(wind rustling)

00:10:27.962 --> 00:10:30.965 position:13% line:89% align:start
Well, there's no going back

00:10:30.998 --> 00:10:32.733 position:10% line:89% align:start
to the way things used to be.

00:10:33.467 --> 00:10:35.002 position:13% line:89% align:start
What would you do, big bro?

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:39.740 position:7% line:89% align:start
So go and have a talk with him.

00:10:41.008 --> 00:10:42.810 position:10% line:89% align:start
Maybe you'll get your answer.

00:10:42.843 --> 00:10:45.913 position:21% line:89% align:start
(motorcycle revving)

00:10:46.847 --> 00:10:50.718 position:13% line:89% align:start
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:10:52.386 --> 00:10:55.723 position:21% line:89% align:start
(motorcycle revving)

00:10:58.025 --> 00:11:02.730 position:21% line:83% align:start

(train chuffing)

00:11:27.721 --> 00:11:31.892 position:21% line:83% align:start
(upbeat instrumental

00:11:38.265 --> 00:11:41.570 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Shuji laughs)

00:11:41.603 --> 00:11:46.073 position:21% line:83% align:start
(upbeat instrumental
music continues)

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.456 position:30% line:5% align:start
(cars revving)

00:12:02.489 --> 00:12:04.792 position:30% line:5% align:start
(horn honking)

00:12:04.825 --> 00:12:06.628 position:21% line:89% align:start
(footsteps thudding)

00:12:06.661 --> 00:12:08.329 position:16% line:89% align:start
So tomorrow's the big day

00:12:08.362 --> 00:12:09.330 position:38% line:89% align:start
Guess so.

00:12:09.363 --> 00:12:11.700 position:21% line:89% align:start
(footsteps thudding)

00:12:11.732 --> 00:12:14.536 position:16% line:83% align:start
But I want you to come
with me first, Takemichi.

00:12:14.569 --> 00:12:16.403 position:30% line:89% align:start
Huh? Where to?

00:12:16.437 --> 00:12:17.338 position:21% line:89% align:start
(footsteps thudding)

00:12:17.371 --> 00:12:19.073 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:12:19.106 --> 00:12:21.742 position:30% line:89% align:start
(cars revving)

00:12:24.278 --> 00:12:27.281 position:30% line:89% align:start
(cars honking)

00:12:27.314 --> 00:12:30.217 position:21% line:89% align:start
(footsteps thudding)

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:36.524 position:30% line:89% align:start
(cars revving)

00:12:36.558 --> 00:12:39.860 position:21% line:89% align:start
(footsteps thudding)

00:12:40.861 --> 00:12:42.363 position:27% line:83% align:start
Thanks for coming
on short notice.

00:12:44.231 --> 00:12:46.267 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Baji sighs)

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:49.671 position:21% line:83% align:start
Chifuyu, ya want
your ass beat again?

00:12:49.704 --> 00:12:50.904 position:35% line:89% align:start
It's Baji!

00:12:53.708 --> 00:12:55.175 position:21% line:89% align:start
Did you get anything?

00:12:55.209 --> 00:12:56.176 position:35% line:89% align:start
On Kisaki?

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:57.378 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:12:57.411 --> 00:13:00.314 position:16% line:89% align:start
(soft suspenseful music)

00:13:00.347 --> 00:13:01.482 position:24% line:89% align:start
You're a spy right?

00:13:01.516 --> 00:13:03.350 position:16% line:89% align:start
You're spying for Toman?

00:13:03.384 --> 00:13:04.552 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Baji grunts)

00:13:04.586 --> 00:13:05.654 position:13% line:89% align:start
I've done my own research,

00:13:05.687 --> 00:13:08.389 position:24% line:83% align:start
and I figured out
Kisaki is bad news.

00:13:08.422 --> 00:13:09.456 position:27% line:89% align:start
So you can quit.

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:11.760 position:5% line:89% align:start
You can get out of Valhalla now.

00:13:11.792 --> 00:13:13.927 position:21% line:83% align:start
What the hell are you
talking about dumbass?

00:13:13.961 --> 00:13:15.396 position:7% line:89% align:start
When the fight starts tomorrow,

00:13:15.429 --> 00:13:18.899 position:13% line:83% align:start
if you're still on
Valhalla's side, it's over!

00:13:18.932 --> 00:13:21.335 position:16% line:83% align:start
You'll be seen as Toman's
enemy from then on!

00:13:22.803 --> 00:13:26.907 position:16% line:89% align:start
(soft suspenseful music)

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:29.109 position:24% line:89% align:start
(handlebar clanks)

00:13:29.143 --> 00:13:30.444 position:38% line:89% align:start
Chifuyu.

00:13:30.477 --> 00:13:33.881 position:5% line:83% align:start
How many times do I have to
drill it into your thick skull?

00:13:34.448 --> 00:13:35.416 position:16% line:89% align:start
Never trust anyone you're

00:13:35.449 --> 00:13:36.751 position:16% line:89% align:start
not sure is your friend.

00:13:36.785 --> 00:13:38.720 position:10% line:89% align:start
(Chifuyu and Takemichi gasps)

00:13:38.753 --> 00:13:40.387 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm with Valhalla now.

00:13:40.421 --> 00:13:42.189 position:30% line:89% align:start
(wind rustling)

00:13:42.222 --> 00:13:45.192 position:21% line:83% align:start
And tomorrow we're
going to crush Toman.

00:13:45.225 --> 00:13:49.029 position:7% line:89% align:start
(Chifuyu and Takemichi grunts)

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:51.031 position:38% line:89% align:start
Chifuyu?

00:13:51.899 --> 00:13:54.335 position:21% line:83% align:start
Mind if I talk to
him alone for a sec?

00:13:55.069 --> 00:13:55.869 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:13:56.904 --> 00:13:59.940 position:21% line:89% align:start
(soft wind rustling)

00:14:01.442 --> 00:14:04.111 position:19% line:83% align:start
There's nothing I have
to talk to you about.

00:14:04.945 --> 00:14:06.180 position:21% line:89% align:start
Look, I have no idea

00:14:06.213 --> 00:14:07.615 position:7% line:89% align:start
what you're doing all this for.

00:14:07.649 --> 00:14:08.916 position:27% line:89% align:start
And to be honest,

00:14:09.718 --> 00:14:11.385 position:7% line:89% align:start
I really don't even much care.

00:14:12.886 --> 00:14:16.323 position:16% line:83% align:start
But please try to survive
the battle tomorrow!

00:14:16.357 --> 00:14:17.358 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:14:18.359 --> 00:14:19.360 position:35% line:89% align:start
Don't die!

00:14:19.393 --> 00:14:20.695 position:27% line:89% align:start
Please don't die!

00:14:20.729 --> 00:14:22.363 position:24% line:89% align:start
(soft piano music)

00:14:22.396 --> 00:14:23.565 position:27% line:89% align:start
For Mikey's sake!

00:14:24.498 --> 00:14:25.866 position:19% line:89% align:start
'Cause it'll break him!

00:14:26.701 --> 00:14:30.705 position:10% line:89% align:start
(soft piano music continues)

00:14:30.739 --> 00:14:32.507 position:27% line:89% align:start
Mikey's my enemy.

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:34.676 position:13% line:89% align:start
And tomorrow I'll kill him.

00:14:34.709 --> 00:14:36.544 position:7% line:89% align:start
You go and tell him I said so.

00:14:36.578 --> 00:14:39.947 position:21% line:89% align:start
(footsteps thudding)

00:14:41.516 --> 00:14:45.085 position:10% line:89% align:start
(soft piano music continues)

00:14:51.925 --> 00:14:52.926 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Mikey] I see.

00:14:54.529 --> 00:14:56.631 position:24% line:89% align:start
As kids we played,

00:14:56.664 --> 00:14:57.898 position:7% line:89% align:start
right on this same jungle gym,

00:14:57.931 --> 00:14:58.932 position:33% line:89% align:start
Baji and me.

00:15:00.167 --> 00:15:02.837 position:7% line:89% align:start
We fought a lot too back then,

00:15:02.871 --> 00:15:04.471 position:24% line:83% align:start
but we always made
up right away.

00:15:06.473 --> 00:15:08.610 position:19% line:83% align:start
I guess we're fighting
for real, this time.

00:15:10.545 --> 00:15:12.346 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry that I failed.

00:15:12.379 --> 00:15:13.380 position:38% line:89% align:start
I tried.

00:15:14.415 --> 00:15:15.617 position:21% line:89% align:start
It wasn't your fault.

00:15:16.785 --> 00:15:18.620 position:5% line:89% align:start
If he won't back down it's done.

00:15:19.788 --> 00:15:21.455 position:13% line:89% align:start
Baji's a traitor to Toman.

00:15:22.557 --> 00:15:24.592 position:19% line:89% align:start
And tomorrow, we fight.

00:15:24.626 --> 00:15:26.795 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gulps)

00:15:26.828 --> 00:15:29.731 position:21% line:83% align:start
All of Toman is
ready to throw down.

00:15:29.764 --> 00:15:30.964 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gulps)

00:15:32.065 --> 00:15:34.569 position:16% line:89% align:start
So I've made up my mind.

00:15:34.602 --> 00:15:37.104 position:16% line:89% align:start
(soft instrumental music)

00:15:37.137 --> 00:15:39.139 position:24% line:83% align:start
Mikey doesn't have
a choice anymore!

00:15:40.007 --> 00:15:41.375 position:13% line:89% align:start
As the commander of Toman,

00:15:42.544 --> 00:15:44.011 position:21% line:89% align:start
he has to fight Baji!

00:15:47.147 --> 00:15:50.652 position:21% line:89% align:start
(soft wind rustling)

00:15:50.685 --> 00:15:52.052 position:16% line:89% align:start
(crew members murmuring)

00:15:52.085 --> 00:15:55.189 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Crew Member] Yeah,
you know whatever.

00:15:55.222 --> 00:15:57.792 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Crew Member] Lets get this
over with sooner or later.

00:15:57.826 --> 00:15:59.960 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Crew Member] When
you think it is?

00:15:59.993 --> 00:16:01.195 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Crew Member] I don't
know, you telling me.

00:16:01.228 --> 00:16:02.296 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Crew Member] Yeah, I guess.

00:16:02.329 --> 00:16:03.898 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Crew Member] Come on already!

00:16:03.932 --> 00:16:04.799 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Crew Member] It's
really important.

00:16:04.833 --> 00:16:07.569 position:16% line:89% align:start
(crew members murmuring)

00:16:07.602 --> 00:16:10.471 position:21% line:89% align:start
(soft wind rustling)

00:16:10.505 --> 00:16:13.608 position:21% line:89% align:start
(footsteps thudding)

00:16:17.812 --> 00:16:19.279 position:35% line:89% align:start
All of you!

00:16:19.313 --> 00:16:21.248 position:24% line:83% align:start
We'll now call this
meeting to order!

00:16:21.281 --> 00:16:23.016 position:5% line:89% align:start
To prepare for tomorrow's fight!

00:16:25.887 --> 00:16:28.455 position:21% line:83% align:start
Thank you all for
coming here tonight!

00:16:28.489 --> 00:16:29.423 position:21% line:89% align:start
(crew members grunts)

00:16:29.456 --> 00:16:30.625 position:33% line:89% align:start
As you know,

00:16:30.658 --> 00:16:32.493 position:5% line:89% align:start
tomorrow we clash with Valhalla.

00:16:32.527 --> 00:16:34.027 position:16% line:89% align:start
We have nothing to gain.

00:16:34.061 --> 00:16:36.129 position:16% line:83% align:start
They're the ones bringing
this fight to us.

00:16:36.997 --> 00:16:38.232 position:38% line:89% align:start
And now,

00:16:38.265 --> 00:16:40.902 position:7% line:89% align:start
Baji has joined with our enemy.

00:16:40.935 --> 00:16:43.237 position:10% line:89% align:start
We show no mercy to traitors!

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:45.339 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's how Toman handles things!

00:16:45.372 --> 00:16:47.675 position:16% line:83% align:start
(Chifuyu sighs) Hoped he
might change his mind.

00:16:47.709 --> 00:16:48.710 position:27% line:89% align:start
So much for that.

00:16:49.777 --> 00:16:54.081 position:5% line:89% align:start
(suspenseful instrumental music)

00:17:02.189 --> 00:17:05.560 position:5% line:89% align:start
But now, I'm gonna get childish.

00:17:05.593 --> 00:17:06.728 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:17:06.761 --> 00:17:07.662 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:17:07.695 --> 00:17:10.798 position:16% line:89% align:start
(crew members muttering)

00:17:10.832 --> 00:17:12.032 position:38% line:89% align:start
Fact is,

00:17:13.233 --> 00:17:14.836 position:13% line:89% align:start
I can't fight against Baji.

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:16.571 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Whaaa?
-Huh?

00:17:16.604 --> 00:17:17.572 position:16% line:89% align:start
(crew members muttering)

00:17:17.605 --> 00:17:19.507 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takashi chuckles)

00:17:19.541 --> 00:17:22.175 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Mikey shuffling)

00:17:22.209 --> 00:17:25.680 position:21% line:83% align:start
That's honestly where
I stand on this!

00:17:25.713 --> 00:17:27.682 position:7% line:89% align:start
What I need is for you to help!

00:17:29.049 --> 00:17:30.818 position:19% line:83% align:start
Tomorrow, we are going
to crush Valhalla

00:17:30.852 --> 00:17:33.021 position:10% line:89% align:start
and bring Baji back to Toman!

00:17:33.086 --> 00:17:35.155 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's how this
battle's gonna go down!

00:17:35.188 --> 00:17:38.593 position:19% line:89% align:start
(crew members cheering)

00:17:39.493 --> 00:17:40.562 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mikey!

00:17:40.595 --> 00:17:41.596 position:44% line:89% align:start
Wow!

00:17:41.629 --> 00:17:42.797 position:41% line:89% align:start
Toman!

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:43.831 position:41% line:89% align:start
Toman!

00:17:44.298 --> 00:17:45.098 position:41% line:89% align:start
Toman!

00:17:45.432 --> 00:17:46.433 position:41% line:89% align:start
Toman!

00:17:47.502 --> 00:17:48.302 position:41% line:89% align:start
Toman!

00:17:48.803 --> 00:17:49.938 position:41% line:89% align:start
Toman!

00:17:49.971 --> 00:17:51.039 position:41% line:89% align:start
Toman!

00:17:51.071 --> 00:17:51.973 position:44% line:89% align:start
Damn!

00:17:52.006 --> 00:17:53.741 position:27% line:83% align:start
Just how I hoped
it would happen!

00:17:55.108 --> 00:17:56.945 position:33% line:89% align:start
Sorry, Kenny.

00:17:56.978 --> 00:17:59.814 position:16% line:83% align:start
Does this make me a
failure, as a commander?

00:17:59.847 --> 00:18:01.315 position:16% line:89% align:start
You know that's not what

00:18:01.348 --> 00:18:02.917 position:16% line:89% align:start
all that cheering means.

00:18:02.951 --> 00:18:04.084 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Mikey chuckles)

00:18:04.117 --> 00:18:05.419 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Crew Members] Toman!

00:18:05.452 --> 00:18:06.621 position:41% line:89% align:start
Toman!

00:18:06.654 --> 00:18:07.589 position:41% line:89% align:start
Toman!

00:18:11.291 --> 00:18:14.261 position:24% line:89% align:start
(crowd chattering)

00:18:16.898 --> 00:18:18.432 position:27% line:89% align:start
(train chuffing)

00:18:18.465 --> 00:18:19.634 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey.

00:18:19.667 --> 00:18:20.935 position:16% line:89% align:start
Who are all these people?

00:18:20.969 --> 00:18:22.770 position:7% line:89% align:start
They're here to see it go down.

00:18:22.804 --> 00:18:25.039 position:19% line:89% align:start
Toman versus Valhalla.

00:18:25.073 --> 00:18:26.273 position:13% line:89% align:start
The winner of today's fight

00:18:26.306 --> 00:18:29.276 position:19% line:83% align:start
will be one step closer
to running all of Tokyo.

00:18:29.309 --> 00:18:31.546 position:21% line:83% align:start
So all the delinquent
bosses around Tokyo

00:18:31.579 --> 00:18:33.615 position:21% line:83% align:start
are gonna be watching
this closely.

00:18:33.648 --> 00:18:36.383 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yeah. There are a lot of
scary-looking guys here.

00:18:36.416 --> 00:18:38.285 position:24% line:83% align:start
Those two over
there for instance.

00:18:38.318 --> 00:18:39.319 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:18:39.353 --> 00:18:41.121 position:7% line:89% align:start
Those are the Haitani Brothers.

00:18:41.154 --> 00:18:42.890 position:5% line:89% align:start
A charismatic pair from Roppongi

00:18:42.924 --> 00:18:45.560 position:10% line:83% align:start
who can gather over a hundred
guys with a single call.

00:18:45.593 --> 00:18:46.828 position:35% line:89% align:start
A hundred?

00:18:46.861 --> 00:18:49.631 position:7% line:83% align:start
And take a look at the fat
dude over there up on the car?

00:18:49.664 --> 00:18:50.932 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:18:50.965 --> 00:18:53.133 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's Leanman and he runs Ueno.

00:18:53.968 --> 00:18:55.803 position:7% line:89% align:start
Word is he's strong as a beast.

00:18:55.837 --> 00:18:57.071 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Hansen laughs)

00:18:57.105 --> 00:18:58.640 position:13% line:89% align:start
Looks like it's party time!

00:18:58.673 --> 00:19:02.777 position:16% line:83% align:start
Time to find out Toman
and Valhalla ain't shit.

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:04.311 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Crew Members] Welcome, sir!

00:19:05.178 --> 00:19:06.848 position:24% line:89% align:start
(footstep thudding)

00:19:06.881 --> 00:19:10.018 position:16% line:89% align:start
(soft suspenseful music)

00:19:10.051 --> 00:19:11.753 position:24% line:89% align:start
Alright you shits.

00:19:11.786 --> 00:19:14.055 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm the one who's gonna be
overseeing today's fight.

00:19:14.088 --> 00:19:15.288 position:24% line:89% align:start
The name's Hansen.

00:19:15.322 --> 00:19:18.092 position:19% line:83% align:start
And I'm from Ikebukuro
Criminal Black Members.

00:19:18.126 --> 00:19:20.728 position:7% line:89% align:start
He's a boss from the '88 group.

00:19:20.762 --> 00:19:21.929 position:13% line:89% align:start
He's overseeing this fight.

00:19:21.963 --> 00:19:23.097 position:35% line:89% align:start
Overseeing?

00:19:23.131 --> 00:19:24.899 position:7% line:89% align:start
He's basically like a referee.

00:19:24.932 --> 00:19:26.701 position:10% line:89% align:start
Hansen, the Haitani Brothers,

00:19:26.734 --> 00:19:28.603 position:24% line:83% align:start
and Leanman are all
gonna keep cool,

00:19:28.636 --> 00:19:29.904 position:27% line:89% align:start
and watch today.

00:19:29.937 --> 00:19:31.105 position:16% line:89% align:start
Usually they're lunatics

00:19:31.139 --> 00:19:33.708 position:19% line:83% align:start
who are always butting
heads with Toman.

00:19:33.741 --> 00:19:35.109 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi grunts)

00:19:35.143 --> 00:19:37.444 position:19% line:83% align:start
Are they seriously
just gonna stay quiet?

00:19:37.477 --> 00:19:39.847 position:10% line:89% align:start
Well that's enough chit-chat!

00:19:39.881 --> 00:19:42.116 position:7% line:89% align:start
Let's bring out today's stars!

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:43.117 position:35% line:89% align:start
All right.

00:19:43.151 --> 00:19:44.619 position:33% line:89% align:start
On this side.

00:19:44.652 --> 00:19:46.788 position:30% line:89% align:start
(gate opening)

00:19:46.821 --> 00:19:49.189 position:30% line:89% align:start
(air swooshing)

00:19:49.222 --> 00:19:51.291 position:24% line:89% align:start
(upbeat rock music)

00:19:51.324 --> 00:19:53.861 position:27% line:89% align:start
Tokyo Manji Gang!

00:19:53.895 --> 00:19:55.630 position:30% line:89% align:start
(gate opening)

00:19:55.663 --> 00:19:56.798 position:27% line:89% align:start
(flag swooshing)

00:19:56.831 --> 00:19:59.801 position:33% line:89% align:start
(CT chuckles)

00:19:59.834 --> 00:20:01.368 position:33% line:89% align:start
And Valhalla!

00:20:01.401 --> 00:20:05.305 position:10% line:89% align:start
(upbeat rock music continues)

00:20:05.338 --> 00:20:07.041 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's time to go Takemichi.

00:20:07.075 --> 00:20:08.208 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi grunts)

00:20:08.241 --> 00:20:10.712 position:21% line:89% align:start
(footsteps thudding)

00:20:10.745 --> 00:20:11.813 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gulps)

00:20:11.846 --> 00:20:13.047 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mikey!

00:20:13.081 --> 00:20:14.716 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's really him.

00:20:14.749 --> 00:20:16.818 position:21% line:89% align:start
The Invincible Mikey!

00:20:16.851 --> 00:20:19.352 position:24% line:89% align:start
(crowd chattering)

00:20:19.386 --> 00:20:20.722 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Leanman chomping)

00:20:20.755 --> 00:20:22.056 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Leanman slurping)

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:24.592 position:24% line:89% align:start
(crowd chattering)

00:20:24.625 --> 00:20:25.860 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hey, Hansen.

00:20:25.893 --> 00:20:28.361 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm glad it's you
overseeing this fight today.

00:20:28.395 --> 00:20:29.731 position:24% line:89% align:start
Thank you for that.

00:20:29.764 --> 00:20:31.231 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Hansen laughs)

00:20:31.264 --> 00:20:34.334 position:16% line:83% align:start
If this fight sucks I'm
takin' you both down pal.

00:20:34.367 --> 00:20:36.771 position:19% line:89% align:start
One man from each gang!

00:20:36.804 --> 00:20:37.672 position:33% line:89% align:start
Step forward!

00:20:38.338 --> 00:20:41.341 position:24% line:89% align:start
(upbeat rock music)

00:20:46.047 --> 00:20:47.949 position:13% line:89% align:start
You can have a five-on-five

00:20:47.982 --> 00:20:49.483 position:16% line:89% align:start
with your five best guys.

00:20:49.517 --> 00:20:52.319 position:21% line:83% align:start
Or go for an all-out
brawl with everyone.

00:20:52.352 --> 00:20:54.188 position:13% line:89% align:start
How do you guys wanna roll?

00:20:54.222 --> 00:20:56.423 position:21% line:83% align:start
Valhalla brought this
whole thing to us.

00:20:56.456 --> 00:20:59.259 position:21% line:83% align:start
So you guys can
decide that Kazutora.

00:20:59.292 --> 00:21:00.628 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Kazutora] Huh?

00:21:00.661 --> 00:21:03.097 position:16% line:83% align:start
We only have one
condition for this fight.

00:21:03.131 --> 00:21:04.632 position:19% line:89% align:start
Keisuke Baji's return.

00:21:04.665 --> 00:21:06.299 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:21:06.333 --> 00:21:07.935 position:13% line:89% align:start
If Toman wins this battle,

00:21:07.969 --> 00:21:10.037 position:13% line:89% align:start
we'll be taking Baji back.

00:21:10.071 --> 00:21:11.706 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's a fact.

00:21:11.739 --> 00:21:15.209 position:16% line:83% align:start
Ha! Baji came over to us
of his own free will.

00:21:15.243 --> 00:21:17.545 position:24% line:83% align:start
There's nothing
to return, Draken.

00:21:17.578 --> 00:21:19.914 position:24% line:83% align:start
We'll be taking
Baji back with us.

00:21:21.115 --> 00:21:22.482 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's all I'm gonna say.

00:21:24.252 --> 00:21:26.453 position:10% line:89% align:start
Then bring it on you jackass!

00:21:26.486 --> 00:21:27.889 position:24% line:89% align:start
(knuckles cracking)

00:21:27.922 --> 00:21:30.390 position:16% line:83% align:start
Hey, punk. Are you gonna
fight here or you gon-

00:21:30.423 --> 00:21:32.960 position:30% line:89% align:start

00:21:32.994 --> 00:21:34.128 position:24% line:89% align:start
(stomach punching)

00:21:34.162 --> 00:21:36.998 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Hansen groaning)

00:21:39.567 --> 00:21:41.368 position:7% line:89% align:start
(Chifuyu and Takemichi gasping)

00:21:41.401 --> 00:21:42.637 position:24% line:89% align:start
(ear rings clanks)

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:43.638 position:38% line:89% align:start
Come on.

00:21:43.671 --> 00:21:45.206 position:38% line:89% align:start
Get real.

00:21:45.239 --> 00:21:46.841 position:21% line:89% align:start
Overseeing the fight?

00:21:46.874 --> 00:21:47.875 position:35% line:89% align:start
Conditions?

00:21:47.909 --> 00:21:50.812 position:16% line:83% align:start
You guys come here to
play house or some shit?

00:21:50.845 --> 00:21:52.713 position:30% line:89% align:start
(air swooshing)

00:21:52.747 --> 00:21:54.982 position:21% line:83% align:start
We came here to beat
the shit outta you,

00:21:55.016 --> 00:21:56.449 position:19% line:89% align:start
and leave you all dead!

00:21:58.686 --> 00:22:01.421 position:7% line:89% align:start
Wanna get shit started, Mikey?

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:03.991 position:27% line:89% align:start
(wind swooshing)

00:22:04.025 --> 00:22:05.159 position:30% line:89% align:start
Let's get them!

00:22:05.193 --> 00:22:06.194 position:41% line:89% align:start
Toman!

00:22:06.227 --> 00:22:09.496 position:19% line:89% align:start
(crew members charging)

00:22:12.332 --> 00:22:15.036 position:27% line:89% align:start
(crews fighting)

00:22:18.039 --> 00:22:22.844 position:21% line:89% align:start
(closing theme music)
