[Takemichi] I never
expected that my life

00:00:09.276 --> 00:00:10.778 position:16% line:89% align:start
would turn out like this.

00:00:10.812 --> 00:00:11.913 position:10% line:89% align:start
Living in a crappy apartment

00:00:11.946 --> 00:00:13.648 position:10% line:89% align:start
with paper thin walls treated

00:00:13.681 --> 00:00:17.184 position:5% line:83% align:start
like an absolute moron by my
manager, who's younger than me.

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:19.086 position:21% line:83% align:start
Then those punks
pick a fight with me,

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.255 position:16% line:89% align:start
and I end up apologizing.

00:00:21.288 --> 00:00:23.825 position:10% line:83% align:start
I've only had one girlfriend
in my entire life,

00:00:23.858 --> 00:00:25.325 position:7% line:89% align:start
and that was in middle school.

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.295 position:16% line:83% align:start
So, to top it all off,
I'm still a damn virgin.

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:29.998 position:7% line:89% align:start
Where the hell did I go wrong?

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.199 position:27% line:89% align:start
(dramatic music)

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:33.033 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:36.169 position:47% line:89% align:start
No.

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:45.045 position:16% line:83% align:start
Huh? Who the hell is
this lame-looking punk?!

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:46.548 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's me from middle school.

00:00:46.581 --> 00:00:50.618 position:10% line:83% align:start
I was so lame, but this was
supposed to be when I peaked.

00:00:50.652 --> 00:00:51.953 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Makoto] Man, I'm starving.

00:00:51.986 --> 00:00:54.154 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Kazushi] Yeah, I
need some katsudon.

00:00:57.291 --> 00:00:59.727 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Akkun] What's wrong
with you, dude?

00:00:59.761 --> 00:01:01.930 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry, but I gotta go.

00:01:01.963 --> 00:01:04.164 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Akkun] Huh? Go where?

00:01:06.568 --> 00:01:08.503 position:27% line:89% align:start
(doorbell rings)

00:01:08.536 --> 00:01:10.038 position:35% line:89% align:start
Who is it?

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.973 position:19% line:89% align:start
Takemichi, is that you?

00:01:12.006 --> 00:01:14.008 position:16% line:89% align:start
Were you fighting again?

00:01:14.042 --> 00:01:16.343 position:16% line:83% align:start
When will you learn? You
can't keep doing that.

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:23.083 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's all right!

00:01:25.687 --> 00:01:29.423 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Naoto] Oh, are you friends
with Hinata? That's cool!

00:01:29.456 --> 00:01:31.258 position:27% line:89% align:start
Naoto Tachibana.

00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:34.261 position:13% line:83% align:start
That's right. In 12 years,
he's going to die, too.

00:01:35.195 --> 00:01:37.966 position:7% line:89% align:start
On July 1st, 12 years from now,

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:40.802 position:10% line:89% align:start
your sister Hinata will die.

00:01:40.835 --> 00:01:42.070 position:35% line:89% align:start
(whimpers)

00:01:42.102 --> 00:01:45.238 position:19% line:83% align:start
And that's also the day
you're going to die.

00:01:45.272 --> 00:01:47.240 position:30% line:89% align:start
July 1st, 2017.

00:01:47.274 --> 00:01:49.777 position:13% line:89% align:start
Remember that date, Naoto.

00:01:49.811 --> 00:01:51.813 position:5% line:89% align:start
You can save your sister's life.

00:01:51.846 --> 00:01:53.146 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm counting on you.

00:01:55.617 --> 00:01:57.217 position:27% line:89% align:start
Okay, I'll do it.

00:02:01.355 --> 00:02:03.858 position:7% line:89% align:start
Takemichi, you've got to help!

00:02:03.891 --> 00:02:06.794 position:10% line:89% align:start
I just know you can save her.

00:02:08.428 --> 00:02:12.800 position:13% line:89% align:start
You want me to save Hinata?

00:02:14.736 --> 00:02:17.404 position:30% line:89% align:start
(siren wailing)

00:02:23.978 --> 00:02:25.178 position:44% line:89% align:start
Whoa.

00:02:26.748 --> 00:02:27.715 position:33% line:89% align:start
Time travel.

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:28.916 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Yeah?

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.918 position:7% line:89% align:start
I've been studying your power.

00:02:30.952 --> 00:02:32.587 position:27% line:83% align:start
You jumped from
the present time,

00:02:33.821 --> 00:02:38.158 position:19% line:83% align:start
July 4th, 2017, to the
same date, July 4th,

00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:39.861 position:21% line:89% align:start
but in the year 2005.

00:02:41.395 --> 00:02:44.364 position:19% line:83% align:start
So you can time travel
12 years into the past.

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:47.869 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's the power I
believe you've acquired.

00:02:49.537 --> 00:02:51.338 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:02:52.372 --> 00:02:56.243 position:10% line:89% align:start
(singing in foreign language)

00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:25.499 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi Voiceover]
I am so tired.

00:04:25.533 --> 00:04:27.201 position:16% line:89% align:start
There, that's important.

00:04:27.235 --> 00:04:28.903 position:35% line:89% align:start
Huh? Yeah.

00:04:28.936 --> 00:04:30.838 position:21% line:83% align:start
And that part there,
you just scrolled by.

00:04:30.872 --> 00:04:32.573 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hm? Oh.

00:04:32.607 --> 00:04:35.176 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Naoto] ake sure you read
that whole paragraph there.

00:04:35.209 --> 00:04:36.177 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi sighs)

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.012 position:21% line:89% align:start
No, you went too far.

00:04:38.045 --> 00:04:39.847 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yes. There, memorize
that part too.

00:04:40.815 --> 00:04:42.250 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi Voiceover]
For two days now,

00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:44.152 position:24% line:83% align:start
I've been locked in
Naoto's apartment,

00:04:44.185 --> 00:04:45.787 position:13% line:89% align:start
and I haven't slept a wink.

00:04:46.621 --> 00:04:47.789 position:41% line:89% align:start
(yawns)

00:04:47.822 --> 00:04:48.589 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Naoto clears throat)

00:04:48.623 --> 00:04:50.158 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh!

00:04:50.191 --> 00:04:51.793 position:7% line:89% align:start
We need you to know everything,

00:04:51.826 --> 00:04:54.494 position:21% line:83% align:start
all the intel on the
Tokyo Manji gang.

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:58.331 position:19% line:83% align:start
I think Naoto's insane.
He's trying to kill me.

00:04:59.734 --> 00:05:01.536 position:41% line:89% align:start
(yawns)

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:02.335 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:04.172 position:13% line:89% align:start
Five days ago, on July 1st,

00:05:04.205 --> 00:05:06.541 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hinata Tachibana got
caught up in a dispute

00:05:06.574 --> 00:05:09.977 position:13% line:83% align:start
among members of the Tokyo
Manji game, and died.

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:14.582 position:16% line:83% align:start
During a festival, a
truck rammed its way in,

00:05:14.615 --> 00:05:17.752 position:13% line:83% align:start
aiming for some stalls, and
she was one of the victims.

00:05:17.785 --> 00:05:18.753 position:35% line:89% align:start
She was 26.

00:05:20.254 --> 00:05:21.689 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Naoto] In that report,

00:05:21.722 --> 00:05:23.724 position:7% line:83% align:start
you'll find some of the things
the Tokyo Manji gang has been

00:05:23.758 --> 00:05:26.393 position:19% line:83% align:start
up to that haven't been
reported by the media.

00:05:26.426 --> 00:05:27.995 position:24% line:83% align:start
That's information
my predecessor

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:29.329 position:13% line:89% align:start
risked his life gathering.

00:05:30.631 --> 00:05:31.398 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:05:31.431 --> 00:05:33.000 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's him in the last photo.

00:05:34.268 --> 00:05:35.468 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:05:35.503 --> 00:05:36.737 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Naoto] He was
working undercover

00:05:36.771 --> 00:05:39.207 position:27% line:83% align:start
when he was found
out and killed.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.708 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasps)

00:05:40.741 --> 00:05:45.246 position:13% line:83% align:start
In his eye socket, in place
of his gouged out eyeball,

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:47.915 position:16% line:83% align:start
there was a miniaturized
video recording device

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:49.349 position:16% line:89% align:start
that captured his murder.

00:05:49.382 --> 00:05:50.718 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:05:50.751 --> 00:05:53.087 position:5% line:89% align:start
So I began requesting transfers,

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.421 position:10% line:89% align:start
until I finally got assigned

00:05:54.454 --> 00:05:56.724 position:16% line:83% align:start
to my predecessor's
position six months ago.

00:05:56.757 --> 00:05:59.227 position:10% line:83% align:start
The death of this
investigator is under wraps,

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:00.661 position:24% line:83% align:start
because they didn't
wanna cause panic,

00:06:00.695 --> 00:06:02.530 position:16% line:83% align:start
though that's really
only part of the reason.

00:06:02.563 --> 00:06:04.497 position:5% line:89% align:start
Tokyo Manji, or Toman for short,

00:06:04.532 --> 00:06:06.567 position:19% line:83% align:start
was already under
Tetta Kisaki's control

00:06:06.601 --> 00:06:08.269 position:10% line:89% align:start
before any of this happened.

00:06:08.302 --> 00:06:10.171 position:5% line:89% align:start
Naoto is trying to fill my brain

00:06:10.204 --> 00:06:11.272 position:13% line:89% align:start
with all of the information

00:06:11.305 --> 00:06:13.507 position:24% line:83% align:start
there is about the
Tokyo Manji gang.

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:16.878 position:41% line:89% align:start
(sighs)

00:06:16.911 --> 00:06:19.780 position:10% line:83% align:start
But seriously, do we need all
this stuff to save Hinata?

00:06:19.814 --> 00:06:22.183 position:19% line:83% align:start
If we have one problem
with your power,

00:06:22.216 --> 00:06:25.653 position:7% line:83% align:start
it's that you're limited in
what dates you can go back to.

00:06:25.686 --> 00:06:26.486 position:38% line:89% align:start
(groans)

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.055 position:24% line:83% align:start
That's really just
your observation.

00:06:29.357 --> 00:06:31.391 position:27% line:83% align:start
You're obviously
alive right now.

00:06:31.424 --> 00:06:34.562 position:21% line:83% align:start
So what happened back
then must be real.

00:06:34.595 --> 00:06:36.496 position:21% line:83% align:start
But I don't even know
for sure if I can go--

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:39.567 position:24% line:83% align:start
If we could go back
to the day she died.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.236 position:10% line:83% align:start
If we could just keep her
from going to that festival,

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:44.939 position:16% line:83% align:start
then it might be possible
to save her life.

00:06:44.972 --> 00:06:48.776 position:13% line:83% align:start
But since we can't go back
to the exact date we want,

00:06:48.809 --> 00:06:50.945 position:19% line:83% align:start
we'll do everything
else we can right now.

00:06:52.246 --> 00:06:53.948 position:10% line:89% align:start
You need to go back in time,

00:06:53.981 --> 00:06:57.885 position:5% line:83% align:start
to middle school, 12 years ago,
and meet a certain someone.

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:00.487 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] Huh?
A certain someone?

00:07:00.521 --> 00:07:05.760 position:7% line:83% align:start
Toman has two leaders,
Manjiro Sano and Tetta Kisaki.

00:07:05.793 --> 00:07:06.994 position:41% line:89% align:start
No way.

00:07:07.028 --> 00:07:08.362 position:27% line:89% align:start
Sano and Kisaki.

00:07:08.396 --> 00:07:10.665 position:21% line:83% align:start
If these two had
never met each other,

00:07:10.698 --> 00:07:13.401 position:16% line:83% align:start
today's Tokyo Manji gang
never would have existed.

00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:14.502 position:30% line:89% align:start
(clears throat)

00:07:14.535 --> 00:07:16.170 position:27% line:83% align:start
Which means that
my sister Hinata

00:07:16.203 --> 00:07:17.939 position:5% line:89% align:start
wouldn't have had to die either.

00:07:18.873 --> 00:07:20.374 position:33% line:89% align:start
I understand.

00:07:20.408 --> 00:07:22.376 position:27% line:83% align:start
I need to go back
to middle school,

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:25.445 position:21% line:83% align:start
and somehow make sure
those two never meet,

00:07:25.478 --> 00:07:27.682 position:24% line:83% align:start
but how do I make
time-travel happen?

00:07:27.715 --> 00:07:29.617 position:13% line:89% align:start
I didn't do it on purpose.

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:31.419 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Naoto] You told me that
right before you came back

00:07:31.484 --> 00:07:34.956 position:16% line:83% align:start
to the present, you shook
hands with me, right?

00:07:34.989 --> 00:07:36.456 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Ah, yeah.

00:07:36.489 --> 00:07:38.659 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Naoto] So I think that
must be the trigger.

00:07:40.695 --> 00:07:42.930 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] A handshake, huh?

00:07:42.964 --> 00:07:46.167 position:19% line:83% align:start
That evening, you saved
me from those punks.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.168 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Huh?

00:07:47.201 --> 00:07:48.669 position:16% line:89% align:start
I think because of that,

00:07:48.703 --> 00:07:51.339 position:13% line:83% align:start
I may have become a part of
the way your power works.

00:07:51.372 --> 00:07:53.341 position:30% line:89% align:start
Huh? I get it.

00:07:53.374 --> 00:07:55.276 position:24% line:83% align:start
I thought he was a
little bit crazy,

00:07:55.309 --> 00:07:58.846 position:13% line:83% align:start
but Naoto actually believes
I can travel through time.

00:07:58.879 --> 00:08:00.982 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's why he's taking
this so seriously.

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:03.718 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Naoto] Takamichi,
are you ready?

00:08:04.919 --> 00:08:08.055 position:24% line:83% align:start
The fact is, I want
to save Hinata too.

00:08:08.089 --> 00:08:09.290 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:08:09.323 --> 00:08:10.925 position:13% line:89% align:start
Just as much as Naoto does.

00:08:12.126 --> 00:08:16.664 position:16% line:83% align:start
Sano and Kisaki. They met
in August, 12 years ago.

00:08:16.697 --> 00:08:19.600 position:13% line:83% align:start
Just locate either one of
them, and stay by his side,

00:08:19.633 --> 00:08:21.635 position:19% line:83% align:start
and stop the two of
them from ever meeting.

00:08:21.669 --> 00:08:24.105 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yeah, right. I'll
give it my best shot.

00:08:24.138 --> 00:08:27.641 position:24% line:89% align:start
(suspenseful music)

00:08:27.675 --> 00:08:30.611 position:10% line:89% align:start

[Boy] Yeah!

00:08:44.525 --> 00:08:46.093 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Huh?

00:08:46.127 --> 00:08:47.161 position:24% line:89% align:start
You're going down!

00:08:47.194 --> 00:08:48.162 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Boy] Come on.

00:08:48.195 --> 00:08:50.431 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hm? Where'd Naoto go?

(energetic rock music)

00:08:53.334 --> 00:08:54.969 position:5% line:89% align:start

-Enough damn talking!
-Kick his ass!

Hey, wait a second.

00:08:58.039 --> 00:09:00.374 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hope you had a good
last meal, punk!

-Get this fight started!
-Punch him, dude!

Yeah!

-Kill him!
-Yeah!

00:09:04.311 --> 00:09:06.515 position:21% line:89% align:start
Kick his little ass!

00:09:06.547 --> 00:09:08.783 position:19% line:83% align:start
Come on, you wuss!
I've got money on you!

00:09:08.816 --> 00:09:11.952 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hey, wait! What the
hell is going on?

00:09:11.986 --> 00:09:12.953 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hang on a sec.

00:09:12.987 --> 00:09:14.221 position:44% line:89% align:start
Wait!

Damn! Naoto was right!

What do you know?

00:09:24.432 --> 00:09:26.333 position:24% line:83% align:start
I really did go

[Takemichi Voiceover]
Did I, did I pass out?

00:09:34.775 --> 00:09:36.410 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hey, what the hell
are you doing,

00:09:36.444 --> 00:09:38.145 position:24% line:83% align:start
going down after
one punch, dumbass?

00:09:38.179 --> 00:09:40.815 position:24% line:83% align:start
We're all betting a
lot of money here.

00:09:40.848 --> 00:09:43.584 position:21% line:83% align:start
That was the most

[Takemichi Voiceover] Match?

So how did we do today?

That scar over his eye.

Fight club?

Oh, right, people were betting
on that fight I was just in.

00:10:11.745 --> 00:10:15.282 position:10% line:83% align:start
Now I remember. These guys
always ran a fighting racket.

Before we go, somebody teach

I get my ass kicked even
more day after effing day.

00:14:00.908 --> 00:14:02.943 position:21% line:89% align:start
So if I go see Naoto.

00:14:05.714 --> 00:14:08.248 position:27% line:89% align:start
(doorbell rings)

00:14:08.282 --> 00:14:09.751 position:41% line:89% align:start
(sighs)

00:14:09.784 --> 00:14:11.820 position:16% line:89% align:start
Man, I hope they're here.

00:14:12.853 --> 00:14:14.622 position:27% line:89% align:start
Naoto is the key!

00:14:14.656 --> 00:14:16.490 position:24% line:83% align:start
If I can just shake
hands with him,

00:14:16.524 --> 00:14:17.991 position:13% line:89% align:start
I can return to the future.

00:14:18.693 --> 00:14:21.895 position:10% line:89% align:start
Only you can save my sister.

00:14:23.531 --> 00:14:25.933 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi Voiceover] Am
I just running away again?

00:14:25.966 --> 00:14:29.002 position:19% line:89% align:start
(footsteps approaching)

00:14:29.036 --> 00:14:31.905 position:27% line:83% align:start
Huh? What are you
doing, Takemichi?

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.809 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hinata? You're here!

00:14:34.843 --> 00:14:38.879 position:21% line:83% align:start
Uh, yeah, 'cause I
live here, remember?

00:14:38.912 --> 00:14:41.448 position:27% line:89% align:start
(car horn beeps)

00:14:41.482 --> 00:14:43.718 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yeah, right, duh. Heh.

00:14:43.752 --> 00:14:45.854 position:27% line:83% align:start
Why have you been
fighting again?

00:14:45.919 --> 00:14:47.622 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Ugh, sorry.

00:14:47.655 --> 00:14:49.524 position:7% line:89% align:start
You look worse than usual too.

00:14:49.557 --> 00:14:50.525 position:33% line:89% align:start
Are you okay?

00:14:50.558 --> 00:14:53.460 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh, yeah, totally fine.

00:14:54.461 --> 00:14:56.798 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Hinata sighs)

00:14:56.831 --> 00:14:59.433 position:16% line:83% align:start
Why do you boys insist
on fighting all the time?

00:15:01.135 --> 00:15:03.270 position:27% line:83% align:start
Sometimes I wish
I was a boy too.

00:15:03.303 --> 00:15:04.104 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Huh?

00:15:04.639 --> 00:15:06.608 position:35% line:89% align:start
(chuckles)

00:15:06.641 --> 00:15:10.879 position:13% line:83% align:start
Because if I was, hiya, I'd
punch him just like that,

00:15:10.911 --> 00:15:12.379 position:13% line:89% align:start
and I'd always protect you.

00:15:12.413 --> 00:15:13.581 position:35% line:89% align:start
(chuckles)

00:15:13.615 --> 00:15:14.849 position:24% line:89% align:start
I know some karate,

00:15:14.883 --> 00:15:18.520 position:7% line:83% align:start
so if I was a guy, I'd be even
stronger and totally awesome.

00:15:18.553 --> 00:15:20.688 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:15:22.923 --> 00:15:26.528 position:19% line:83% align:start
In that case, I'll
protect you too, Hina.

00:15:27.261 --> 00:15:28.228 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:15:28.262 --> 00:15:30.532 position:38% line:89% align:start
(giggles)

00:15:30.565 --> 00:15:31.666 position:19% line:89% align:start
I just called her Hina.

00:15:31.699 --> 00:15:33.033 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Hinata] Okay.

00:15:33.066 --> 00:15:35.169 position:24% line:83% align:start
I got carried away
there for a second.

00:15:35.202 --> 00:15:36.871 position:13% line:89% align:start
I want you to call me that,

00:15:36.905 --> 00:15:39.908 position:35% line:89% align:start
(chuckles)

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:41.975 position:38% line:89% align:start
(laughs)

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:44.813 position:35% line:89% align:start
(chuckles)

00:15:44.846 --> 00:15:46.581 position:24% line:83% align:start
but I'll be the
one protecting you.

00:15:46.614 --> 00:15:47.615 position:24% line:89% align:start
So get used to it.

00:15:47.649 --> 00:15:48.650 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:15:48.683 --> 00:15:49.918 position:38% line:89% align:start
Face it.

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:52.019 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're really kind of
a cry baby, Takemichi.

00:15:53.855 --> 00:15:55.289 position:24% line:89% align:start
So if I were a guy,

00:15:55.322 --> 00:15:57.124 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'd definitely be
stronger than you.

00:15:58.292 --> 00:16:00.427 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hey, it's not fair
of you to say that!

00:16:00.461 --> 00:16:02.797 position:21% line:83% align:start
The other day was the
only time I cried!

00:16:02.831 --> 00:16:04.431 position:27% line:83% align:start
(Hinata giggles)
Sure about that?

00:16:04.465 --> 00:16:05.800 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] Forget
that happened.

00:16:05.834 --> 00:16:07.869 position:5% line:89% align:start
Nope. I'm never going to forget.

00:16:07.902 --> 00:16:10.705 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi laughs)

00:16:10.738 --> 00:16:13.407 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Hinata laughs)

00:16:15.944 --> 00:16:18.546 position:7% line:89% align:start
Bye-bye. I'll see you tomorrow.

(giggles)

00:16:22.817 --> 00:16:25.720 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hi, I'm home!

00:16:25.753 --> 00:16:26.721 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi sighs)

00:16:26.754 --> 00:16:30.023 position:24% line:89% align:start
(crickets chirping)

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:37.498 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:16:39.868 --> 00:16:40.835 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:16:40.869 --> 00:16:43.203 position:35% line:89% align:start
(chuckles)

00:16:48.075 --> 00:16:51.078 position:24% line:89% align:start

[Takemichi Voiceover]
12 years from now,

00:16:54.716 --> 00:16:56.183 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hina and I won't be dating.

(street sign beeps)

00:16:57.585 --> 00:17:00.187 position:13% line:83% align:start
By that time, we won't have
seen each other for years.

00:17:03.223 --> 00:17:06.026 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm not under any
obligation to save her.

00:17:06.059 --> 00:17:08.462 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'll be the one protecting
you. So get used to it.

00:17:10.999 --> 00:17:13.467 position:27% line:89% align:start

(Takemichi sobbing)

00:17:15.135 --> 00:17:17.204 position:24% line:83% align:start

she'd actually die.

(people chatting)

Hey, Takuya.

I can't believe you lost a fight

to that guy of all people.

00:17:29.383 --> 00:17:30.952 position:21% line:83% align:start
You should have been
able to clobber him.

Oh, well, it's hard to explain.

You got a minute?

They're doing their fight
club again. It's today.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:49.102 position:13% line:83% align:start
And lately it seems they've
been running it every day.

And today's fighter
is gonna be Takuya.

[Takemichi Voiceover] Wow.

Takuya Yamamoto has
always been pretty frail.

(audience cheering)

00:18:01.381 --> 00:18:03.952 position:13% line:83% align:start
If I remember right, he
was almost beaten to death.

00:18:03.985 --> 00:18:05.820 position:21% line:89% align:start
Takuya can't do this!

00:18:05.853 --> 00:18:07.487 position:13% line:89% align:start
We all know he can't fight!

00:18:07.522 --> 00:18:09.591 position:7% line:89% align:start
Yeah. Go tell that to Kiyomasa.

00:18:09.624 --> 00:18:10.592 position:35% line:89% align:start
(both sigh)

00:18:10.625 --> 00:18:11.425 position:27% line:89% align:start
Can you tell him?

00:18:12.392 --> 00:18:13.393 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:18:13.427 --> 00:18:15.697 position:27% line:83% align:start
If I thought that
they would let me,

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:17.097 position:19% line:89% align:start
I would take his place.

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:18.833 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi Voiceover] Akkun
actually said he'd try

00:18:18.866 --> 00:18:20.668 position:19% line:89% align:start
to take Takuya's place!

00:18:20.702 --> 00:18:23.236 position:10% line:83% align:start
But it's not like they'd ever
listen to what we had to say.

00:18:26.206 --> 00:18:27.842 position:35% line:89% align:start
Wow, Akkun.

00:18:27.875 --> 00:18:29.744 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Makoto sighs)

00:18:29.777 --> 00:18:31.411 position:21% line:89% align:start
Thanks anyway, Akkun.

00:18:31.445 --> 00:18:33.246 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Akkun] I didn't do anything.

You just watch me.
I'll get your revenge.

You'll see.

00:18:41.723 --> 00:18:42.890 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:18:42.924 --> 00:18:44.726 position:24% line:83% align:start
And when I win,
you owe me dinner!

00:18:46.493 --> 00:18:47.595 position:41% line:89% align:start
Takuya.

Yeah, that's the spirit.

If you believe
you'll win, you will!

00:18:54.669 --> 00:18:55.903 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I know it.

00:18:55.937 --> 00:18:57.204 position:13% line:89% align:start
You got this thing, Takuya.

00:18:57.237 --> 00:18:58.940 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wash your damn hands, Yamagishi!

(dramatic music)

[Takemichi] I thought
that they were lame,

00:19:11.119 --> 00:19:13.554 position:21% line:83% align:start
but they're actually
insanely cool.

00:19:13.588 --> 00:19:14.555 position:30% line:89% align:start
I remember now,

00:19:14.589 --> 00:19:17.224 position:13% line:83% align:start
I had such amazing friends
in middle school.

All right, then, let's
get on with this.

up or you'll fart.

00:19:47.287 --> 00:19:49.289 position:19% line:83% align:start
You better win this
fight, you pencil-neck!

00:19:49.322 --> 00:19:51.092 position:13% line:83% align:start
You lose this fight, you're
goin' home in a basket!

00:19:51.125 --> 00:19:54.494 position:21% line:83% align:start
And from Mizo Middle
School, Yamamoto!

00:19:54.529 --> 00:19:55.495 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Boy] You're gonna
die, long-hair!

00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:57.330 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Boy] You better
not chicken out!

00:19:57.364 --> 00:20:00.168 position:13% line:83% align:start
The odds are currently six
to four in favor of Kojima!

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.103 position:7% line:89% align:start
Don't worry about that, Yamada!

00:20:02.136 --> 00:20:04.038 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Boy] I thought his
name was Yamamoto.

00:20:04.072 --> 00:20:06.007 position:16% line:83% align:start
Who the hell cares
about your dumbass name?

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:07.775 position:7% line:89% align:start
I've got 500 yen riding on you.

00:20:07.809 --> 00:20:09.143 position:24% line:89% align:start
(audience chatting)

00:20:09.177 --> 00:20:10.778 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Boy] Let's see
something, come on.

00:20:10.812 --> 00:20:12.513 position:30% line:89% align:start
(clears throat)

00:20:12.547 --> 00:20:14.214 position:13% line:83% align:start
-[Boy] All right, come on!
-Humpf.

00:20:15.149 --> 00:20:16.851 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Boy] Let's go,

00:20:16.884 --> 00:20:18.553 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Boy] Let's do it!

00:20:25.492 --> 00:20:28.696 position:7% line:83% align:start
Ha, punk. You look like
you're about to shit yourself.

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:30.164 position:41% line:89% align:start
(pants)

00:20:30.198 --> 00:20:33.668 position:16% line:89% align:start
(audience stops chatting)

00:20:37.605 --> 00:20:38.740 position:27% line:89% align:start
Begin the fight.

00:20:38.773 --> 00:20:41.109 position:24% line:89% align:start
(audience cheering)

00:20:41.142 --> 00:20:42.577 position:30% line:89% align:start
Everyone stop!

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:44.746 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Audience] Huh?

00:20:47.615 --> 00:20:48.415 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:20:51.786 --> 00:20:53.054 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Takuya] Takemichi!

00:20:53.087 --> 00:20:54.387 position:24% line:89% align:start
The hell? Shut up!

00:20:54.421 --> 00:20:55.556 position:27% line:89% align:start
Who is this jerk?

00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:57.457 position:24% line:83% align:start
Get lost, you
stupid second-year!

00:20:57.491 --> 00:20:58.458 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Boy] What, a second-year?

00:20:58.492 --> 00:20:59.927 position:7% line:89% align:start
He's gonna get his ass kicked!

00:20:59.961 --> 00:21:00.928 position:41% line:89% align:start
(sighs)

00:21:00.962 --> 00:21:02.262 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Boy] Get out of here!

00:21:02.295 --> 00:21:03.631 position:16% line:89% align:start
Don't you guys get bored,

00:21:03.664 --> 00:21:06.667 position:16% line:83% align:start
seeing the same damn
match every single time?

00:21:08.136 --> 00:21:09.837 position:16% line:83% align:start
Don't you want something
more entertaining?

00:21:09.871 --> 00:21:11.773 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're the dumbass
who got knocked out

00:21:11.806 --> 00:21:13.373 position:16% line:89% align:start
with one punch yesterday.

00:21:13.406 --> 00:21:14.407 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Boy] Piss off.

00:21:14.441 --> 00:21:16.276 position:27% line:83% align:start
What do you mean,
more entertaining?

00:21:17.912 --> 00:21:19.914 position:24% line:89% align:start
I need to face him!

00:21:19.947 --> 00:21:21.215 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:21:21.249 --> 00:21:22.583 position:33% line:89% align:start
For example.

00:21:22.617 --> 00:21:24.852 position:13% line:89% align:start
Well, can't turn back now.

00:21:24.886 --> 00:21:26.554 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Kojima] Who the hell
are you, ya stupid punk?

00:21:26.587 --> 00:21:28.189 position:24% line:83% align:start
Keep your big nose
outta my fight!

00:21:28.222 --> 00:21:29.257 position:33% line:89% align:start
This is bad.

00:21:29.289 --> 00:21:30.357 position:33% line:89% align:start
He's lost it.

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:32.927 position:27% line:89% align:start
(dramatic music)

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:34.729 position:24% line:89% align:start
King versus slave.

00:21:34.762 --> 00:21:35.530 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah?

00:21:35.563 --> 00:21:36.531 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Boy] You gotta be kidding.

00:21:36.564 --> 00:21:37.765 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Boy] Shit. He's crazy.

00:21:37.799 --> 00:21:39.967 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Boy] Did you hear what
he just said? He's nuts.

00:21:40.001 --> 00:21:40.968 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:21:41.002 --> 00:21:42.937 position:16% line:89% align:start
What's he talking about?

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:45.472 position:19% line:89% align:start
Takemichi! Don't do it.

00:21:46.641 --> 00:21:48.543 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] So what
do you say, Kiyomasa?

00:21:59.687 --> 00:22:02.123 position:7% line:89% align:start
Are you gonna fight me or not?

00:22:02.156 --> 00:22:03.157 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmph.

00:22:03.191 --> 00:22:05.492 position:35% line:89% align:start
(all gasp)

00:22:06.861 --> 00:22:10.064 position:13% line:83% align:start
In the past and in the
present, I have to change,

00:22:10.097 --> 00:22:11.331 position:21% line:89% align:start
or nothing else will.

00:22:12.266 --> 00:22:13.568 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:22:13.601 --> 00:22:15.803 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi Voiceover]
So I'm done running.

00:22:17.605 --> 00:22:20.508 position:21% line:89% align:start
(closing theme music)

00:22:27.181 --> 00:22:31.118 position:21% line:89% align:start
(singing in Japanese)
