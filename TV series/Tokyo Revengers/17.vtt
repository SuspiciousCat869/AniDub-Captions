Hey, Kazutora, where
are we going to now?

00:00:16.618 --> 00:00:19.186 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, Mikey's birthday's
coming up, right?

00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:21.523 position:19% line:83% align:start
So we're goin' shopping
for a present for him!

00:00:21.556 --> 00:00:23.023 position:24% line:89% align:start
What kinda present?

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:24.091 position:27% line:89% align:start
We got no money.

00:00:24.124 --> 00:00:25.392 position:38% line:83% align:start
-No need!
-Huh?

00:00:27.996 --> 00:00:30.565 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Kazutora] Over there,
that's the place.

00:00:30.598 --> 00:00:31.633 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Baji] It's here?

00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:33.066 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Kazutora] Yeah, there it is.

00:00:35.737 --> 00:00:39.172 position:27% line:83% align:start
-A CB250T.
-It's beautiful.

00:00:39.874 --> 00:00:41.776 position:13% line:89% align:start
All right, let's steal it.

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:42.777 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.444 position:19% line:89% align:start
Wait, we can't do that!

00:00:44.478 --> 00:00:45.880 position:33% line:89% align:start
You dumbass.

00:00:45.914 --> 00:00:48.115 position:21% line:83% align:start
We don't need to tell
him how we got it!

00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:50.284 position:21% line:83% align:start
The only way kids
like us ever get one

00:00:50.317 --> 00:00:52.554 position:10% line:89% align:start
is if somebody gives us one.

00:00:52.587 --> 00:00:54.054 position:24% line:89% align:start
Or if we steal one.

00:00:54.722 --> 00:00:57.224 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Baji grunts)

00:01:03.397 --> 00:01:04.866 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Baji] It actually opened!

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:07.401 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Kazutora] Yeah, and no
security alarms or anything!

00:01:07.434 --> 00:01:09.003 position:41% line:89% align:start
Sweet.

00:01:09.037 --> 00:01:11.271 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Baji] Are we really
gonna do this, Kazutora?

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:13.775 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Kazutora] Just shut up.

00:01:13.808 --> 00:01:15.208 position:24% line:89% align:start
Which way do we go?

00:01:21.816 --> 00:01:24.351 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Look there, Baji.
-Whoa!

00:01:25.352 --> 00:01:27.487 position:10% line:89% align:start
All right, let's roll it out!

00:01:27.522 --> 00:01:28.556 position:35% line:89% align:start
No not yet!

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.658 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll go out front and
open the shutters up.

00:01:30.692 --> 00:01:31.993 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yeah, okay!

00:01:32.026 --> 00:01:33.226 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hurry up!

00:01:34.662 --> 00:01:37.197 position:13% line:83% align:start
You're gonna have the
best birthday ever, Mikey!

00:01:38.866 --> 00:01:39.834 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey!

00:01:39.867 --> 00:01:41.669 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Baji gasps)

00:01:41.703 --> 00:01:45.540 position:16% line:83% align:start
You picked the wrong shop
to break into, asshole.

00:01:47.942 --> 00:01:50.678 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hey, wait a sec,
you look familiar.

00:01:50.712 --> 00:01:52.513 position:27% line:89% align:start
Are you Keisuke?

00:01:52.547 --> 00:01:54.515 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Baji gasps)

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:55.717 position:35% line:89% align:start
Shinichiro?

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.786 position:21% line:89% align:start
Why are you in here?

00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:03.558 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Baji gasps)

00:02:03.591 --> 00:02:04.892 position:21% line:89% align:start
No, Kazutora, don't!

00:02:06.426 --> 00:02:11.498 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(Kazutora grunts)
-(tool clangs)

00:02:11.532 --> 00:02:13.233 position:10% line:89% align:start
Time to get outta here, Baji!

00:02:16.704 --> 00:02:19.306 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Baji] Oh my god, what
have you done, Kazutora?

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:21.743 position:30% line:83% align:start
Huh? What was I
supposed to do?

00:02:21.776 --> 00:02:23.678 position:27% line:89% align:start
He saw your face!

00:02:23.711 --> 00:02:24.712 position:24% line:89% align:start
I know him 'cause,

00:02:25.913 --> 00:02:27.749 position:21% line:83% align:start
because he's Mikey's
older brother!

00:02:29.083 --> 00:02:30.852 position:27% line:89% align:start
Mikey's brother?

00:02:30.885 --> 00:02:31.886 position:41% line:89% align:start
No way!

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.288 position:21% line:83% align:start
How could we've made
such a huge mistake?

00:02:36.924 --> 00:02:38.458 position:7% line:89% align:start
We were trying to steal a bike

00:02:38.492 --> 00:02:40.427 position:19% line:83% align:start
that belonged to
Mikey's older brother!

00:02:42.096 --> 00:02:43.564 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Officer] Roger that, dispatch.

00:02:43.598 --> 00:02:45.967 position:19% line:83% align:start
We have two suspects in
custody at the scene.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.267 position:7% line:89% align:start
One victim, severe head trauma,

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.303 position:16% line:83% align:start
en route to the hospital
by ambulance, code three.

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:54.509 position:30% line:89% align:start
I don't get it!

00:02:55.677 --> 00:02:57.444 position:24% line:83% align:start
How could any of
this have happened?

00:02:58.846 --> 00:03:01.448 position:13% line:89% align:start
Must kill, must kill Mikey.

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:03.450 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Baji!
-Huh?

00:03:06.721 --> 00:03:07.454 position:27% line:89% align:start
What's going on?

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.693 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Baji sobbing)

00:03:11.726 --> 00:03:12.727 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mikey!

00:03:14.128 --> 00:03:15.395 position:19% line:89% align:start
What happened in there?

00:03:18.633 --> 00:03:19.801 position:33% line:89% align:start
I'm so sorry.

00:03:23.571 --> 00:03:26.908 position:19% line:83% align:start
After that, Mikey and I
went our separate ways.

00:03:29.443 --> 00:03:32.880 position:19% line:83% align:start
Truth is, you remind
me of my older brother.

00:03:32.914 --> 00:03:33.915 position:30% line:89% align:start
He's dead now.

00:03:35.116 --> 00:03:36.283 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi Voiceover]
Mikey told me once

00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:38.119 position:7% line:89% align:start
that he had a brother who died!

00:03:38.152 --> 00:03:40.353 position:7% line:89% align:start
So these two are the ones who-

00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:42.623 position:7% line:89% align:start
Kazutora defended me in court.

00:03:42.657 --> 00:03:45.459 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's the only reason
I didn't go to juvie.

00:03:45.492 --> 00:03:47.294 position:21% line:83% align:start
An' since then, I've
just been waiting

00:03:47.327 --> 00:03:49.997 position:24% line:83% align:start
'til he was finally
a free man again.

00:03:50.031 --> 00:03:51.364 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasps)

00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:52.834 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi Voiceover]
Does that mean Baji's

00:03:52.867 --> 00:03:56.236 position:13% line:83% align:start
always been loyal to
Kazutora, and not to Toman?

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.140 position:19% line:83% align:start
So he didn't just
leave Toman on a whim!

00:03:59.173 --> 00:04:00.474 position:24% line:89% align:start
But if that's true,

00:04:00.508 --> 00:04:03.144 position:13% line:83% align:start
then how the hell am I
supposed to drag him back?

00:04:03.177 --> 00:04:06.013 position:10% line:89% align:start
Awesome, helluva story Baji.

00:04:07.447 --> 00:04:10.417 position:13% line:83% align:start
And that kind of dedication
is definitely welcome here.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.386 position:5% line:89% align:start
Baji, you get a Valhalla jacket!

00:04:17.357 --> 00:04:18.860 position:10% line:89% align:start
And you tell Mikey something.

00:04:20.528 --> 00:04:23.831 position:13% line:83% align:start
One week from right now on
the night of October 31st,

00:04:23.865 --> 00:04:27.367 position:13% line:83% align:start
Abandoned car lot, finally
Valhalla versus Toman.

00:04:28.035 --> 00:04:29.537 position:24% line:89% align:start
Shit's goin' down!

00:04:30.838 --> 00:04:33.941 position:27% line:89% align:start

(crickets chirping)

00:06:05.867 --> 00:06:08.769 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi Voiceover] So Baji's
always been Toman's enemy.

00:06:08.803 --> 00:06:11.639 position:13% line:83% align:start
And now there's a huge
battle coming up in a week.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.709 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi sighs)

00:06:14.742 --> 00:06:17.044 position:7% line:89% align:start
We'll fight with Valhalla soon.

00:06:17.078 --> 00:06:18.880 position:24% line:89% align:start
So bring Baji back.

00:06:18.913 --> 00:06:21.315 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi Voiceover]
That's impossible, Mikey.

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:23.985 position:16% line:83% align:start
How the hell can I bring
him back in a week?

00:06:24.018 --> 00:06:26.220 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's totally not happening!

00:06:26.254 --> 00:06:29.456 position:7% line:89% align:start
But if you fail, I'll kill you.

00:06:30.925 --> 00:06:34.494 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi Voiceover]
What am I gonna do?

00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:45.438 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi sighs)

00:06:48.276 --> 00:06:50.177 position:7% line:89% align:start
I didn't get any sleep at all.

00:06:50.211 --> 00:06:51.679 position:19% line:89% align:start
I feel like an old man.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.348 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi sighs)

00:06:54.382 --> 00:06:56.217 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi Voiceover] I
don't know what to do!

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.185 position:21% line:83% align:start
What am I gonna tell
Mikey about Baji?

00:07:00.021 --> 00:07:01.389 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi sighs)

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:04.025 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Hey, blondie!
-Huh?

00:07:05.393 --> 00:07:06.594 position:30% line:89% align:start
Get over here.

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:11.464 position:27% line:83% align:start
Come on over here
and take a seat.

00:07:13.567 --> 00:07:15.136 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi Voiceover]
Who, who's this guy?

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:16.504 position:21% line:89% align:start
He's been hurt, bad.

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.308 position:16% line:83% align:start
And I think he must
have a few screws loose.

00:07:20.341 --> 00:07:21.509 position:27% line:89% align:start
Gonna ignore him.

00:07:21.542 --> 00:07:24.011 position:19% line:83% align:start
Guess we both had us
a rough day yesterday.

00:07:24.045 --> 00:07:25.846 position:27% line:89% align:start
Huh, what's that?

00:07:27.381 --> 00:07:28.616 position:35% line:89% align:start
That Baji!

00:07:28.649 --> 00:07:30.017 position:13% line:89% align:start
Sure is awesome, isn't he?

00:07:31.052 --> 00:07:32.452 position:27% line:89% align:start
Do you know Baji?

00:07:32.485 --> 00:07:34.188 position:27% line:89% align:start
Wait who are you?

00:07:34.221 --> 00:07:36.456 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm in the Tokyo Manji Gang too.

00:07:36.489 --> 00:07:38.592 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm the 1st Division's
Vice Captain.

at Valhalla's base!

Look who's talking.

00:07:56.644 --> 00:07:58.713 position:21% line:83% align:start
You oughta thank Baji
for slugging you.

Huh?

00:07:59.747 --> 00:08:01.382 position:10% line:89% align:start
Why the hell would I do that?

00:08:01.415 --> 00:08:02.950 position:7% line:89% align:start
You totally ruined the ceremony

00:08:02.984 --> 00:08:05.953 position:16% line:83% align:start
to appoint a new Captain
for the 3rd Division.

punished pretty severely

if Baji hadn't slugged ya.

Oh.

00:08:16.931 --> 00:08:18.666 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Chifuyu] The reason
Baji beat me up

00:08:18.699 --> 00:08:19.867 position:16% line:89% align:start
was to get into Valhalla.

00:08:21.769 --> 00:08:25.239 position:5% line:83% align:start
But he didn't join Valhalla
because he wants to crush Toman.

00:08:25.272 --> 00:08:26.273 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:31.545 position:21% line:83% align:start
Baji's got something
else in mind.

00:08:33.914 --> 00:08:35.216 position:33% line:89% align:start
It's Kisaki.

00:08:35.249 --> 00:08:36.717 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:08:36.751 --> 00:08:40.054 position:10% line:83% align:start
That's the reason Baji joined
Valhalla in the first place,

00:08:40.087 --> 00:08:41.255 position:27% line:89% align:start
to expose Kisaki.

00:08:56.670 --> 00:09:01.142 position:16% line:83% align:start
So I hear, you know about
my brother, Shinichiro.

00:09:02.476 --> 00:09:04.045 position:13% line:89% align:start
He was the ultimate badass.

00:09:04.078 --> 00:09:06.547 position:30% line:89% align:start
He was amazing.

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:07.715 position:41% line:89% align:start
He was.

00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:09.917 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hey, Takemitchy.

00:09:11.352 --> 00:09:13.654 position:10% line:89% align:start
We know how it all happened.

00:09:13.687 --> 00:09:16.557 position:13% line:83% align:start
And we know there's nothing
we can do to change it.

00:09:18.926 --> 00:09:23.097 position:7% line:83% align:start
Neither Baji or Kazutora meant
for it to go down like that.

00:09:24.565 --> 00:09:25.566 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:09:28.102 --> 00:09:31.272 position:10% line:83% align:start
My brother's gone and I know
nothing will bring him back.

00:09:32.541 --> 00:09:36.977 position:24% line:83% align:start
But, my heart still
can't accept it.

00:09:40.781 --> 00:09:44.318 position:10% line:83% align:start
The CB250T Baji and Kazutora
tried to steal that night

00:09:44.351 --> 00:09:45.986 position:27% line:89% align:start
was my brother's.

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:47.088 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Huh?

00:09:47.121 --> 00:09:49.690 position:19% line:83% align:start
He was going to give it
to me for my birthday.

00:09:52.726 --> 00:09:55.362 position:16% line:83% align:start
This bike is all I've got
left of my brother now.

00:09:57.665 --> 00:09:58.866 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's precious to me.

00:10:01.735 --> 00:10:06.140 position:10% line:83% align:start
As for Baji, It's been two
years and I've forgiven him.

00:10:07.509 --> 00:10:10.010 position:16% line:83% align:start
But, even if they didn't
know it was his shop,

00:10:10.044 --> 00:10:13.681 position:13% line:83% align:start
and even if there's nothing
we can do about it now

00:10:13.714 --> 00:10:16.617 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll never be able
to forgive Kazutora,

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:18.385 position:24% line:83% align:start
he's the one who
killed my brother.

00:10:23.691 --> 00:10:25.893 position:21% line:83% align:start
Or forgive Baji for
siding with Kazutora.

00:10:27.728 --> 00:10:30.364 position:19% line:83% align:start
Takemitchy, I'm pretty
sure I asked you

00:10:30.397 --> 00:10:31.899 position:16% line:89% align:start
to bring Baji back to me.

00:10:33.334 --> 00:10:37.071 position:10% line:83% align:start
So what's Baji's vice captain
doing here instead of him?

00:10:38.272 --> 00:10:40.307 position:19% line:83% align:start
What are you trying to
pull here, Takemitchy?

00:10:41.742 --> 00:10:44.078 position:13% line:89% align:start
Do you really want to die?

00:10:44.111 --> 00:10:45.146 position:30% line:89% align:start
No, I, I uh...

[Takemichi Voiceover]
What am I doing here?

00:10:50.317 --> 00:10:51.819 position:19% line:89% align:start
What is it I wanna do?

00:10:55.524 --> 00:10:57.424 position:21% line:83% align:start
The reason Baji went
over to Valhalla

00:10:57.458 --> 00:10:58.959 position:21% line:89% align:start
was to spy on Kisaki.

00:10:58.993 --> 00:11:00.161 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh!

00:11:00.194 --> 00:11:01.829 position:21% line:89% align:start
Does that mean that,

00:11:01.862 --> 00:11:04.599 position:13% line:83% align:start
that Valhalla and Kisaki
are connected in some way?

00:11:04.633 --> 00:11:06.400 position:33% line:89% align:start
Probably so.

00:11:06.433 --> 00:11:09.069 position:13% line:83% align:start
And if Baji's investigating
from within Valhalla

00:11:09.103 --> 00:11:11.772 position:13% line:83% align:start
then I'm gonna investigate
Kisaki from the outside.

00:11:12.706 --> 00:11:15.209 position:10% line:89% align:start
Will you help me, Takemichi?

00:11:15.242 --> 00:11:16.243 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:11:17.778 --> 00:11:19.046 position:19% line:89% align:start
I have to do something.

00:11:20.981 --> 00:11:24.285 position:10% line:83% align:start
'Cuz on his own he just flies
off the handle too easily.

00:11:26.987 --> 00:11:28.289 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] How do you know
Baji's investigating Kisaki?

00:11:28.322 --> 00:11:29.790 position:10% line:89% align:start
Did he tell you that himself?

00:11:29.823 --> 00:11:31.425 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Chifuyu] No, he didn't
say that exactly.

00:11:31.458 --> 00:11:34.094 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-But I'm certain of it.

00:11:34.128 --> 00:11:36.130 position:19% line:83% align:start
I can always tell
what Baji's# thinking.

00:11:37.431 --> 00:11:39.166 position:27% line:83% align:start
I've been by his
side for so long.

00:11:41.168 --> 00:11:43.638 position:27% line:83% align:start
What I want to do
here is simple.

00:11:43.672 --> 00:11:46.307 position:10% line:89% align:start
I just want to help Baji out.

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:47.609 position:13% line:89% align:start
What do you want, tell me.

00:11:47.642 --> 00:11:49.009 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:11:49.043 --> 00:11:51.812 position:21% line:83% align:start
At that 3rd Division
Captain's ceremony

00:11:51.845 --> 00:11:53.781 position:24% line:89% align:start
you punched Kisaki.

00:11:53.814 --> 00:11:55.983 position:19% line:83% align:start
That was a really
dangerous thing to do.

00:11:56.717 --> 00:11:58.520 position:21% line:89% align:start
What was that about?

00:11:58.553 --> 00:11:59.853 position:13% line:89% align:start
What were you tryin' to do?

00:11:59.887 --> 00:12:04.725 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi Voiceover]
Me, I, well, I was...

00:12:08.495 --> 00:12:09.997 position:16% line:89% align:start
What was I trying to do?

00:12:11.198 --> 00:12:12.233 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's right!

00:12:12.266 --> 00:12:14.935 position:16% line:83% align:start
Mikey ordered me to
bring Baji back to Toman

00:12:14.969 --> 00:12:17.838 position:10% line:83% align:start
and I was hoping he'd get
rid of Kisaki if I did that.

00:12:18.939 --> 00:12:21.141 position:5% line:89% align:start
Because if Kisaki's out of Toman

00:12:21.175 --> 00:12:24.111 position:10% line:83% align:start
then the future would change
and I might save Hina!

No!

what I swore back then!

on my side, let's do it!

00:14:06.013 --> 00:14:07.515 position:27% line:83% align:start
And you and I are
in the same grade,

00:14:07.549 --> 00:14:09.350 position:13% line:83% align:start

Huh?

00:14:10.384 --> 00:14:11.753 position:35% line:89% align:start

why didn't you ever ask?

outrank me in Toman

00:14:20.729 --> 00:14:22.764 position:24% line:83% align:start
I guess it amounts
to the same thing.

be too casual-

encounter with Tetta Kisaki.

00:15:42.242 --> 00:15:45.946 position:5% line:83% align:start
Before him I just beat the shit
out of people I didn't like.

00:15:45.979 --> 00:15:48.248 position:21% line:83% align:start
And no one ever stood
up to me either.

00:15:48.282 --> 00:15:52.720 position:16% line:83% align:start
Eventually, everybody was
gone and I wound up alone.

00:15:52.754 --> 00:15:57.057 position:13% line:83% align:start
And Kisaki picked exactly
that moment to approach me.

00:15:57.090 --> 00:16:00.227 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi Voiceover]
Kisaki, a stupid little brat?

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.464 position:10% line:83% align:start
And surprisingly, when I did
just what Kisaki told me,

00:16:03.497 --> 00:16:05.365 position:19% line:89% align:start
everything worked out.

00:16:05.399 --> 00:16:07.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
So I went in just a
single year from a moron

00:16:08.001 --> 00:16:10.037 position:21% line:83% align:start
who didn't know
anything but fighting

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:12.540 position:13% line:83% align:start
to the commander who ruled
over all of Shinjuku.

00:16:13.575 --> 00:16:15.008 position:30% line:89% align:start
In just a year!

00:16:15.042 --> 00:16:16.878 position:10% line:89% align:start
You're saying that the reason

00:16:16.911 --> 00:16:19.213 position:16% line:83% align:start
you became the commander
of Moebius so rapidly

00:16:19.246 --> 00:16:21.482 position:19% line:83% align:start
was because Kisaki
was there helping you?

00:16:21.516 --> 00:16:22.884 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:16:22.917 --> 00:16:24.151 position:24% line:83% align:start
Just 'cause you're
good at fighting

00:16:24.184 --> 00:16:26.220 position:24% line:83% align:start
doesn't mean you're
a good leader.

00:16:26.253 --> 00:16:30.558 position:7% line:83% align:start
Then, I take it Kisaki was
your most trusted subordinate?

00:16:30.592 --> 00:16:33.227 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Osanai grumbles)

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.664 position:5% line:83% align:start
I was a stepping stone for
Kisaki and never anything else!

00:16:36.698 --> 00:16:39.901 position:19% line:83% align:start
That became clear to me
after that huge fight!

00:16:39.934 --> 00:16:41.970 position:13% line:89% align:start
The Battle of August Third!

00:16:42.002 --> 00:16:44.137 position:21% line:83% align:start
You mean when Draken
got stabbed, right?

00:16:44.171 --> 00:16:46.608 position:19% line:83% align:start
That whole thing was
planned out in advance.

00:16:46.641 --> 00:16:48.275 position:13% line:89% align:start
Kisaki orchestrated it all.

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:52.112 position:21% line:83% align:start
Kisaki pushed Pah to
the breaking point

00:16:52.145 --> 00:16:54.616 position:13% line:83% align:start
in order to create a reason
for a fight with Toman.

00:16:56.016 --> 00:16:58.418 position:24% line:83% align:start
And then he made me
take the rap for it!

00:16:58.452 --> 00:17:02.022 position:24% line:83% align:start
So you mean it was
all Kisaki's fault?

00:17:03.691 --> 00:17:06.193 position:16% line:83% align:start
And then after I got
stabbed to end that fight

00:17:07.127 --> 00:17:08.730 position:13% line:89% align:start
he met secretly with Mikey,

00:17:08.763 --> 00:17:11.699 position:7% line:83% align:start
and he told him he didn't
like how I was running things.

00:17:11.733 --> 00:17:14.368 position:16% line:83% align:start
He got himself on Mikey's
good side by claiming

00:17:14.401 --> 00:17:16.771 position:7% line:89% align:start
he could prove Pah's innocence.

00:17:16.804 --> 00:17:20.107 position:10% line:83% align:start
What was Kisaki trying to
accomplish with all of that?

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:22.276 position:24% line:83% align:start
Kisaki's goal was
to use other people

00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:25.212 position:13% line:83% align:start
to get Draken killed in
the Battle of August Third.

00:17:25.245 --> 00:17:26.614 position:10% line:89% align:start
And then with that seat open

00:17:26.648 --> 00:17:29.316 position:13% line:83% align:start
he could take over himself
as Toman's number two!

00:17:31.184 --> 00:17:34.154 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] So it was Kisaki
who was behind all of that!

00:17:35.422 --> 00:17:38.292 position:21% line:83% align:start
And after he used me
he tossed me aside.

00:17:38.325 --> 00:17:42.195 position:5% line:83% align:start
And now I hear he's already got
his next sword at the ready.

00:17:43.063 --> 00:17:45.833 position:21% line:83% align:start
And that sword's
name is Shuji Hanma!

00:17:48.402 --> 00:17:49.369 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:17:49.403 --> 00:17:52.040 position:21% line:83% align:start
Are you serious, the
guy from Valhalla?

00:17:52.072 --> 00:17:53.041 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Osanai] Yeah.

00:17:53.073 --> 00:17:55.175 position:27% line:83% align:start
If you knew about
it all this time

00:17:55.208 --> 00:17:57.144 position:21% line:83% align:start
why haven't you taken
out Kisaki yourself?

00:17:57.177 --> 00:17:59.047 position:27% line:83% align:start
Instead it sounds
like you stood by

00:17:59.079 --> 00:18:01.849 position:19% line:83% align:start
and let him play you
like a fiddle, Osanai.

00:18:01.883 --> 00:18:04.151 position:24% line:83% align:start
If it was just a
matter of fighting,

00:18:04.184 --> 00:18:07.154 position:19% line:83% align:start
or even if I needed to
try and outsmart him,

00:18:07.187 --> 00:18:09.423 position:16% line:89% align:start
then I would have tried.

00:18:09.456 --> 00:18:12.927 position:10% line:89% align:start
But he's, how do I put this?

00:18:12.961 --> 00:18:14.762 position:21% line:89% align:start
The man is just evil!

00:18:14.796 --> 00:18:16.229 position:21% line:89% align:start
How can I explain it?

00:18:16.965 --> 00:18:18.833 position:5% line:89% align:start
What kind of monster uses others

00:18:18.866 --> 00:18:21.536 position:7% line:83% align:start
to kill people without
getting their own hands dirty?

00:18:22.704 --> 00:18:25.540 position:19% line:83% align:start
Who knows what he'd do
if I went after him?

00:18:30.243 --> 00:18:35.248 position:16% line:83% align:start
No, my days of dealing
with Kisaki are over now.

00:18:39.887 --> 00:18:43.256 position:21% line:89% align:start
(train cars thudding)

00:18:46.828 --> 00:18:48.696 position:13% line:89% align:start
Well one thing's clear now.

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:50.130 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:18:50.163 --> 00:18:52.366 position:24% line:83% align:start
Valhalla does have
someone at the top!

Even without an obvious boss,
and so full of mysteries

00:18:57.404 --> 00:18:59.841 position:19% line:83% align:start
that the gang's called
the Headless Angel,

00:18:59.874 --> 00:19:02.309 position:7% line:89% align:start
it turns out there is a leader!

00:19:02.342 --> 00:19:04.478 position:10% line:89% align:start
The leader no one knew about!

00:19:04.512 --> 00:19:08.116 position:10% line:89% align:start
And his name is Tetta Kisaki!

00:19:08.148 --> 00:19:10.317 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasps)

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:12.920 position:24% line:83% align:start
And currently,
Kisaki is in Toman.

00:19:12.954 --> 00:19:15.255 position:5% line:89% align:start
Which means the throne is empty!

is the head of Valhalla?

00:19:17.959 --> 00:19:20.595 position:27% line:83% align:start
Then why is he a
member of Toman?

00:19:20.628 --> 00:19:22.764 position:27% line:83% align:start

to fight Valhalla?

trying to accomplish?

I don't understand!

Oh don't worry about it.

you wanna ask him now?

I'm sorry to keep bugging
you like this, Draken.

00:20:10.243 --> 00:20:12.814 position:21% line:83% align:start
Why didn't you leave
Tokyo like I said?

00:20:14.182 --> 00:20:16.316 position:24% line:83% align:start
Uh, I needed to
ask you something.

00:20:17.819 --> 00:20:21.221 position:16% line:83% align:start
Do you remember the gang
they called Valhalla?

00:20:21.254 --> 00:20:23.624 position:24% line:83% align:start
They had a leader
no one knew, right?

00:20:23.658 --> 00:20:24.726 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Draken] Yeah.

00:20:24.759 --> 00:20:27.294 position:21% line:83% align:start

Huh!

00:20:37.772 --> 00:20:40.373 position:16% line:83% align:start

specifically for Mikey.

There's no way, impossible!
