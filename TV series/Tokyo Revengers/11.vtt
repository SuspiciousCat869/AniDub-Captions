00:00:07.542 --> 00:00:10.778 position:33% line:89% align:start
(all panting)

00:00:10.812 --> 00:00:14.181 position:30% line:89% align:start
(siren wailing)

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:15.449 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] It looks like

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:16.951 position:41% line:89% align:start
we won.

00:00:16.985 --> 00:00:18.151 position:16% line:89% align:start
Shit! The cops are here!

00:00:18.185 --> 00:00:19.787 position:24% line:83% align:start
So what do we do
with these punks?!

00:00:19.821 --> 00:00:22.122 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Akaishi groans)

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:24.792 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi panting)

00:00:24.826 --> 00:00:27.494 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Akkun panting)

00:00:29.664 --> 00:00:30.865 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm gettin' the hell outta here!

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:32.032 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Delinquent 1] Huh?

00:00:32.065 --> 00:00:33.868 position:21% line:89% align:start
What about Kiyomasa?!

00:00:33.902 --> 00:00:34.869 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Akaishi] Forget him!

00:00:34.903 --> 00:00:36.604 position:33% line:89% align:start
(all panting)

00:00:36.638 --> 00:00:38.105 position:35% line:89% align:start
(all sigh)

00:00:38.138 --> 00:00:39.908 position:27% line:89% align:start
(relieved exhale)

00:00:39.941 --> 00:00:42.109 position:24% line:89% align:start
(relieved laughter)

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:45.379 position:16% line:83% align:start
I get it now. I was doing
things out of my league.

00:00:45.412 --> 00:00:47.615 position:10% line:89% align:start
And so I kept on messing up.

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:51.118 position:13% line:83% align:start
But still, not one of those
screw-ups was for nothing.

00:00:52.286 --> 00:00:55.322 position:19% line:83% align:start
They were watching out
for me the whole time.

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:56.156 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:58.726 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Makoto grunts)

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.794 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Kazushi] Thanks.

00:00:59.827 --> 00:01:01.295 position:21% line:89% align:start
We did it, Takemichi!

00:01:01.328 --> 00:01:04.464 position:10% line:83% align:start
Did you guys all see me pull
off my Super Miracle Punch?!

00:01:04.498 --> 00:01:07.735 position:10% line:83% align:start
No, but I saw you get
punched and land on your ass.

00:01:07.769 --> 00:01:09.403 position:13% line:89% align:start
You guys, shut up already!

00:01:09.436 --> 00:01:12.840 position:13% line:83% align:start
We need to get Draken and
Takemichi to the ambulance!

00:01:12.874 --> 00:01:13.841 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Ow.
-Take this.

00:01:13.875 --> 00:01:15.208 position:10% line:89% align:start
This will stop the bleeding.

00:01:15.242 --> 00:01:16.343 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Akkun] Can you
stand up, Draken?

00:01:16.376 --> 00:01:17.579 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Hey.
-Yeah, I think so.

00:01:17.612 --> 00:01:20.080 position:27% line:83% align:start
Guys, uh, I don't
see any ambulance.

00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:21.081 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Hinata] They're over here!

00:01:21.114 --> 00:01:22.717 position:13% line:89% align:start
Come on, we need to hurry!

00:01:24.652 --> 00:01:26.186 position:21% line:89% align:start
Come on, speed it up!

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:27.187 position:21% line:89% align:start
(both girls panting)

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.188 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Right here, hurry!
-Hurry!

00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:29.289 position:21% line:89% align:start
They're in bad shape.

00:01:31.593 --> 00:01:34.394 position:21% line:89% align:start
(gang members groan)

00:01:34.428 --> 00:01:36.798 position:7% line:89% align:start
(exhales) I think I've had it.

00:01:36.831 --> 00:01:37.799 position:27% line:89% align:start
(exhausted sigh)

00:01:37.832 --> 00:01:39.433 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey!

00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:41.502 position:7% line:89% align:start
Afraid I'm out of action, guys.

00:01:41.536 --> 00:01:44.271 position:16% line:83% align:start
He hurt his leg, I guess,
probably kicking somebody.

00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:47.307 position:5% line:89% align:start
(sighs) You know where Mikey is?

00:01:47.341 --> 00:01:48.676 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yeah, he's over there.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.652 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Shuji chuckles)

00:01:57.685 --> 00:02:01.055 position:24% line:83% align:start
Fightin' you is
exhausting, Mikey.

00:02:01.089 --> 00:02:02.790 position:21% line:83% align:start
And you don't even
sound out of breath,

00:02:02.824 --> 00:02:04.124 position:21% line:89% align:start
you freaking monster.

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:06.293 position:21% line:89% align:start
Just shut up and die.

00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:07.427 position:24% line:89% align:start
(motor engine revs)

00:02:07.461 --> 00:02:08.462 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.568 position:16% line:89% align:start
Come on, boss. Gotta go.

00:02:13.601 --> 00:02:15.135 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:02:15.168 --> 00:02:20.173 position:19% line:83% align:start
-(siren wailing)
-(motor engine revving)

00:02:20.942 --> 00:02:24.311 position:21% line:89% align:start
(indistinct chatters)

00:02:26.014 --> 00:02:27.314 position:27% line:89% align:start
Listen up, Mikey.

00:02:27.347 --> 00:02:28.983 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're about to
witness the creation

00:02:29.017 --> 00:02:30.818 position:21% line:83% align:start
of the most sinister
biker gang alliance

00:02:30.852 --> 00:02:31.819 position:21% line:89% align:start
in the Kanto region!

00:02:32.787 --> 00:02:34.488 position:16% line:89% align:start
And Valhalla is its name!

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.227 position:24% line:83% align:start
You already know my
name, Shuji Hanma.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.329 position:21% line:83% align:start
And as Valhalla's
first vice commander,

00:02:42.362 --> 00:02:44.732 position:27% line:83% align:start
I can promise you
this much, Mikey!

00:02:44.766 --> 00:02:48.069 position:19% line:83% align:start
From now on, Toman will
never know peace again!

00:02:48.102 --> 00:02:51.371 position:19% line:89% align:start
(motor engine revving)

00:02:57.945 --> 00:03:01.314 position:21% line:89% align:start
(opening theme music)

00:04:26.901 --> 00:04:29.203 position:30% line:5% align:start
(siren wailing)

00:04:29.237 --> 00:04:31.773 position:21% line:5% align:start
(ambulance whooshing)

00:04:31.806 --> 00:04:34.809 position:27% line:5% align:start
(monitor beeping)

00:04:34.842 --> 00:04:37.178 position:16% line:89% align:start
(Draken breathes heavily)

00:04:37.211 --> 00:04:39.379 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] Please,
be okay, Draken!

00:04:40.882 --> 00:04:42.650 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Draken stammers)

00:04:42.683 --> 00:04:43.483 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:04:46.988 --> 00:04:47.989 position:41% line:89% align:start
Draken!

00:04:50.357 --> 00:04:54.796 position:24% line:83% align:start
(exhales) Thanks
a lot, Takemitchy.

00:04:56.496 --> 00:04:57.832 position:24% line:89% align:start
You saved my life.

00:04:59.366 --> 00:05:01.368 position:21% line:83% align:start
Man, don't go tellin'
me stuff like that.

00:05:01.401 --> 00:05:04.071 position:5% line:89% align:start
It sounds weird comin' from you.

00:05:04.105 --> 00:05:06.774 position:7% line:89% align:start
(breathes) Take care of Mikey.

00:05:07.842 --> 00:05:09.510 position:27% line:89% align:start
Counting on you.

00:05:09.544 --> 00:05:10.845 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:05:10.878 --> 00:05:11.946 position:30% line:89% align:start
(monitor beeps)

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:14.081 position:7% line:89% align:start
He's gone into cardiac arrest!

00:05:14.115 --> 00:05:15.783 position:21% line:89% align:start
Step back. Start CPR!

00:05:15.817 --> 00:05:17.285 position:30% line:89% align:start
Airway's clear!

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:18.953 position:27% line:89% align:start
One, two, three,

00:05:18.986 --> 00:05:21.989 position:27% line:89% align:start
four, five, six!

00:05:22.023 --> 00:05:23.090 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm not getting anything!

00:05:23.124 --> 00:05:24.125 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Paramedic 1] Try again.

00:05:24.158 --> 00:05:25.325 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Paramedic 2] One, two, three...

00:05:25.358 --> 00:05:27.195 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] This
can't be happening!

00:05:27.228 --> 00:05:28.996 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Paramedic 2]
Five, six, seven...

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.031 position:41% line:89% align:start
Draken!

00:05:30.998 --> 00:05:34.001 position:19% line:89% align:start
(motor engine revving)

00:05:37.872 --> 00:05:38.840 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Mikey grunts)

00:05:38.873 --> 00:05:41.374 position:33% line:89% align:start
(tense music)

00:05:43.443 --> 00:05:46.479 position:27% line:89% align:start
(faint breathing)

00:05:49.951 --> 00:05:52.753 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi panting)

00:05:57.457 --> 00:05:59.426 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Hinata] Takemichi!

00:06:02.063 --> 00:06:04.265 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Emma whimpering)

00:06:04.298 --> 00:06:05.867 position:38% line:89% align:start
We can't

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:06.801 position:41% line:89% align:start
do much

00:06:06.834 --> 00:06:07.835 position:33% line:89% align:start
except pray.

00:06:09.337 --> 00:06:10.905 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi sighs)

00:06:10.938 --> 00:06:13.541 position:30% line:89% align:start
(rain pouring)

00:06:14.208 --> 00:06:16.376 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Akkun] No! Cardiac arrest?!

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:17.645 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Emma whimpering)

00:06:17.678 --> 00:06:19.914 position:10% line:89% align:start
No! This just can't be real!

00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:25.219 position:10% line:89% align:start
What if he dies? I'm scared!

00:06:25.253 --> 00:06:26.988 position:24% line:89% align:start
Try to have faith.

00:06:27.021 --> 00:06:29.190 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Emma whimpers)

00:06:29.223 --> 00:06:29.991 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Takemitchy!
-[All] Huh?

00:06:30.024 --> 00:06:30.992 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Mitsuya] How's Draken?!

00:06:31.025 --> 00:06:32.326 position:33% line:89% align:start
Mitsuya, Peh!

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.095 position:21% line:89% align:start
Sorry, but it's bad.

00:06:37.999 --> 00:06:40.668 position:30% line:89% align:start
(door whirring)

00:06:42.003 --> 00:06:45.573 position:5% line:83% align:start
Before we even got to the
hospital, his pulse nose-dived.

00:06:45.606 --> 00:06:46.607 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Mitsuya] Damn it!

00:06:48.175 --> 00:06:49.176 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:06:54.282 --> 00:06:55.516 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hello, Mikey.

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.121 position:27% line:89% align:start
Draken is in the-

00:07:00.154 --> 00:07:01.322 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mikey.

00:07:01.355 --> 00:07:03.357 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Mikey, I wanna say-
-Shut up, all of you.

00:07:03.391 --> 00:07:05.126 position:21% line:83% align:start
You need to keep
quiet in a hospital.

00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:07.061 position:16% line:89% align:start
Don't you know anything?

00:07:07.094 --> 00:07:08.129 position:16% line:89% align:start
Where's the waiting room?

00:07:09.397 --> 00:07:12.432 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Emma whimpering)

00:07:13.801 --> 00:07:14.802 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, Mikey!

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:18.438 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Emma whimpers)

00:07:23.811 --> 00:07:24.745 position:33% line:89% align:start
I know Kenny.

00:07:25.546 --> 00:07:26.948 position:21% line:89% align:start
And so I can tell you

00:07:26.981 --> 00:07:29.150 position:21% line:83% align:start
that he's always been
a man of his word.

00:07:30.318 --> 00:07:32.452 position:16% line:89% align:start
He's not gonna die here.

00:07:32.485 --> 00:07:35.122 position:19% line:83% align:start
He'd never do something
so disingenuous.

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:37.692 position:30% line:89% align:start
He promised me

00:07:38.993 --> 00:07:41.195 position:16% line:83% align:start
that he and I would
rule the world together.

00:07:42.897 --> 00:07:44.464 position:38% line:89% align:start
So Emma,

00:07:44.497 --> 00:07:46.466 position:33% line:89% align:start
Mitsuya, Peh,

00:07:46.499 --> 00:07:47.501 position:35% line:89% align:start
Takemitchy,

00:07:48.502 --> 00:07:50.504 position:5% line:89% align:start
just have a little faith in him.

00:07:52.373 --> 00:07:55.576 position:24% line:89% align:start
(melancholic music)

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:57.712 position:16% line:89% align:start
He's gonna pull through.

00:07:58.913 --> 00:08:02.016 position:27% line:89% align:start
(relieved sighs)

00:08:02.049 --> 00:08:03.551 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] He's right.

00:08:03.584 --> 00:08:05.586 position:19% line:83% align:start
What good is gonna come
out of us panicking?

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.488 position:10% line:89% align:start
Mikey is just so damn strong!

00:08:11.392 --> 00:08:12.994 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Mikey] And
remember, keep quiet.

00:08:20.634 --> 00:08:21.602 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasps)

00:08:21.635 --> 00:08:24.005 position:19% line:89% align:start
(Emma and Hinata gasp)

00:08:24.038 --> 00:08:26.707 position:30% line:89% align:start
(door whirring)

00:08:31.512 --> 00:08:33.180 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Doctor] We were able
to save his life.

00:08:33.214 --> 00:08:35.483 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:08:35.516 --> 00:08:37.718 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Doctor] The operation
was a success.

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:41.188 position:27% line:89% align:start
(delighted gasps)

00:08:41.222 --> 00:08:46.227 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh, hell yeah! (laughs)

00:08:47.194 --> 00:08:48.496 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yes! Draken's okay!

00:08:48.529 --> 00:08:50.398 position:5% line:89% align:start
Thank goodness, Hina! Thank God-

00:08:50.431 --> 00:08:51.298 position:19% line:83% align:start
-It's a miracle!
-He's gonna be alright!

00:08:51.332 --> 00:08:53.167 position:19% line:89% align:start
We were all so worried!

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.869 position:21% line:89% align:start
[All] Draken! Draken!

00:08:54.902 --> 00:08:56.537 position:13% line:83% align:start
-All right, that's enough!
-Draken! Draken!

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:58.539 position:19% line:83% align:start
Let's go tell the
guys outside the news.

00:08:58.572 --> 00:09:00.374 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Right.
-Yeah.

00:09:00.408 --> 00:09:03.878 position:16% line:89% align:start
(all laughing in relief)

00:09:05.112 --> 00:09:06.647 position:24% line:89% align:start
Aren't you coming?

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:07.681 position:33% line:89% align:start
I just can't.

00:09:08.816 --> 00:09:10.651 position:16% line:89% align:start
I can't face the others.

00:09:11.886 --> 00:09:13.054 position:44% line:89% align:start
Peh.

00:09:13.087 --> 00:09:16.424 position:10% line:83% align:start
Everybody gets that what you
did, you did for Pah's sake.

00:09:16.457 --> 00:09:17.858 position:21% line:89% align:start
We all understand it.

00:09:19.026 --> 00:09:20.428 position:33% line:89% align:start
You mean it?

00:09:20.461 --> 00:09:22.263 position:13% line:89% align:start
Let me tell you something.

00:09:22.296 --> 00:09:25.166 position:13% line:83% align:start
The guy who's been worrying
the most about Pah,

00:09:25.199 --> 00:09:26.567 position:21% line:89% align:start
that would be Draken.

00:09:28.402 --> 00:09:30.104 position:24% line:83% align:start
You know they won't
let you see him.

00:09:30.137 --> 00:09:31.138 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:09:31.806 --> 00:09:33.207 position:10% line:89% align:start
But that's not what matters.

00:09:34.842 --> 00:09:37.512 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Mitsuya] From that day on,
Draken went with Pah's parents

00:09:37.546 --> 00:09:40.414 position:27% line:83% align:start
to go visit him
every single day.

00:09:40.448 --> 00:09:42.116 position:24% line:83% align:start
Even though he knew
that only relatives

00:09:42.149 --> 00:09:44.185 position:16% line:89% align:start
could actually go inside.

00:09:44.218 --> 00:09:47.288 position:10% line:83% align:start
He'd bring a gift, then he'd
wait outside the whole time.

00:09:48.956 --> 00:09:50.891 position:24% line:83% align:start
That's the guy that
you tried to kill.

00:09:54.128 --> 00:09:55.129 position:33% line:89% align:start
I'm so sorry!

00:09:56.097 --> 00:09:57.231 position:21% line:89% align:start
You need to apologize

00:09:57.264 --> 00:09:59.133 position:24% line:89% align:start
to Draken, to Pah,

00:10:00.067 --> 00:10:01.769 position:33% line:89% align:start
to everyone.

00:10:03.971 --> 00:10:04.972 position:47% line:89% align:start
Mm.

00:10:06.575 --> 00:10:08.709 position:24% line:89% align:start
Welcome back, Peh.

00:10:10.644 --> 00:10:13.247 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Peh whimpers)

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:18.752 position:24% line:89% align:start
(insects chirping)

00:10:18.786 --> 00:10:21.989 position:21% line:83% align:start
Oh, look! It finally
stopped raining.

00:10:26.293 --> 00:10:27.895 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh no, look at the time!

00:10:27.928 --> 00:10:30.965 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's already past
midnight! I had no idea!

00:10:30.998 --> 00:10:33.300 position:21% line:83% align:start
(sighs) That means
it's August 4th now.

00:10:33.334 --> 00:10:34.335 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:10:35.537 --> 00:10:38.305 position:24% line:83% align:start
Then on August 3rd,
you'll save Ryuguji.

00:10:38.339 --> 00:10:39.740 position:7% line:89% align:start
That's your mission this time.

00:10:41.742 --> 00:10:45.646 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] Whoa! So,
it's already August 4th?

00:10:45.679 --> 00:10:48.716 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi grunts)

00:10:50.217 --> 00:10:52.887 position:16% line:89% align:start
Naoto, I made it happen!

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.189 position:7% line:89% align:start
If it's not August 3rd anymore,

00:10:55.222 --> 00:10:56.891 position:30% line:89% align:start
then that means

00:10:56.924 --> 00:10:58.225 position:13% line:89% align:start
the mission to save Draken

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.495 position:30% line:89% align:start
was a success!

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:04.798 position:21% line:89% align:start
(gang members cheer)

00:11:10.871 --> 00:11:14.141 position:19% line:89% align:start
(indistinctive cheers)

00:11:16.043 --> 00:11:18.045 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hm? Huh?

00:11:18.712 --> 00:11:19.847 position:24% line:89% align:start
Where did Mikey go?

00:11:20.714 --> 00:11:23.751 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi pants)

00:11:29.323 --> 00:11:31.725 position:19% line:83% align:start
That doesn't make any
sense. Where did he go?

00:11:35.664 --> 00:11:40.834 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh, there he i- (gasps)

00:11:41.302 --> 00:11:43.837 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Mikey sighs)

00:11:47.174 --> 00:11:51.979 position:27% line:89% align:start
(sobs) Oh, Kenny!

00:11:52.913 --> 00:11:57.851 position:16% line:89% align:start
This is messed up! (sobs)

00:12:01.121 --> 00:12:03.791 position:30% line:89% align:start
(wistful music)

00:12:11.098 --> 00:12:14.368 position:24% line:83% align:start
Don't scare me like
that, you asshole.

00:12:14.401 --> 00:12:17.371 position:24% line:89% align:start
(sympathetic sigh)

00:12:28.415 --> 00:12:29.917 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] August 10th.

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:33.020 position:16% line:83% align:start
A whole week after the
huge fight on August 3rd,

00:12:33.053 --> 00:12:35.690 position:27% line:83% align:start
rumors brought on
even more rumors.

00:12:35.724 --> 00:12:37.491 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hey, look! It's
that Takemichi dude!

00:12:37.525 --> 00:12:38.826 position:13% line:89% align:start
Yeah, they say he shut down

00:12:38.859 --> 00:12:40.294 position:5% line:89% align:start
that whole battle on August 3rd!

00:12:40.327 --> 00:12:41.295 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Ha ha!
-For real?

00:12:41.328 --> 00:12:42.429 position:35% line:89% align:start
Holy shit!

00:12:42.463 --> 00:12:44.633 position:10% line:89% align:start
Overnight, I became a legend

00:12:44.666 --> 00:12:46.834 position:21% line:83% align:start
among all the
delinquents in town.

00:12:46.867 --> 00:12:50.004 position:16% line:83% align:start
Shit! Why should I go
back to the future now?!

00:12:50.037 --> 00:12:52.873 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Akkun] Agh, why did we
bother saving this guy again?

00:12:54.509 --> 00:12:55.710 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hey, Draken!

00:12:55.744 --> 00:12:58.145 position:19% line:83% align:start
I was free so I thought
I'd come visit ya!

00:12:58.178 --> 00:12:59.514 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Draken grunts)

00:12:59.547 --> 00:13:00.814 position:16% line:89% align:start
So how ya feelin' anyway?

00:13:00.848 --> 00:13:02.783 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Draken] Who the hell
died and made you king?

00:13:02.816 --> 00:13:03.951 position:35% line:89% align:start
Huh? What?

00:13:03.984 --> 00:13:05.520 position:7% line:89% align:start
What is that supposed to mean?

00:13:05.553 --> 00:13:08.088 position:10% line:83% align:start
It means your head's gettin'
too big for your body.

00:13:08.122 --> 00:13:10.057 position:19% line:83% align:start
And just because you
got a little attention,

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:12.393 position:19% line:83% align:start
well get over
yourself, you dumbass!

00:13:12.426 --> 00:13:13.728 position:21% line:89% align:start
How lame can you be?

00:13:13.762 --> 00:13:15.229 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi sighs)

00:13:16.497 --> 00:13:19.066 position:19% line:83% align:start
You wouldn't understand
how I feel, Draken.

00:13:19.099 --> 00:13:21.235 position:21% line:83% align:start
Most of my life I've
been in the shadows.

00:13:21.268 --> 00:13:22.403 position:33% line:89% align:start
Aw, poor boy.

00:13:22.436 --> 00:13:24.138 position:16% line:89% align:start
(grunts) Listen, Draken!

00:13:24.171 --> 00:13:25.939 position:21% line:83% align:start
I've never had anyone
look up to me before

00:13:25.973 --> 00:13:27.575 position:21% line:83% align:start
so why the hell
can't you let my head

00:13:27.609 --> 00:13:29.076 position:27% line:83% align:start
get a little bit
bigger at least?!

00:13:29.109 --> 00:13:30.411 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Draken] Oh, man.
That's pathetic.

00:13:30.444 --> 00:13:32.614 position:21% line:83% align:start
Are you even hearing
yourself right now?

00:13:32.647 --> 00:13:34.783 position:21% line:83% align:start
(grunts) You're such
a downer, Draken.

00:13:34.815 --> 00:13:36.250 position:13% line:89% align:start
You said I saved your life,

00:13:36.283 --> 00:13:37.719 position:16% line:83% align:start
but now that you're
feeling a little better,

00:13:37.752 --> 00:13:39.386 position:16% line:89% align:start
this is how you treat me.

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:41.021 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Draken chuckles)

00:13:41.055 --> 00:13:43.157 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh, by the way. Here.

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:44.191 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:13:45.392 --> 00:13:48.028 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Draken] It's from Mikey. He
asked me to give it to you.

00:13:52.266 --> 00:13:53.901 position:27% line:89% align:start
A Toman uniform?

00:13:53.934 --> 00:13:57.071 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's Mikey's, from when
he first formed Toman.

00:13:57.104 --> 00:13:58.707 position:21% line:89% align:start
To a member of Toman,

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:01.342 position:16% line:83% align:start
that uniform is as
important as life itself.

00:14:01.375 --> 00:14:02.843 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gulps)

00:14:02.876 --> 00:14:05.212 position:27% line:83% align:start
Why would he ever
give this to me?

00:14:05.245 --> 00:14:07.981 position:16% line:83% align:start
Whether you wear this
or not is all up to you.

00:14:08.015 --> 00:14:10.050 position:21% line:83% align:start
But he wanted you to
have it, regardless.

00:14:12.019 --> 00:14:15.724 position:19% line:83% align:start
Takemitchy, you
basically saved Toman.

00:14:15.757 --> 00:14:18.560 position:24% line:83% align:start
We all know that.
And me most of all.

00:14:19.728 --> 00:14:22.162 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Draken grunts)

00:14:22.196 --> 00:14:24.231 position:27% line:83% align:start
So I want to say
this once again.

00:14:27.234 --> 00:14:28.235 position:35% line:89% align:start
Thank you.

00:14:29.671 --> 00:14:30.871 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:34.141 position:16% line:89% align:start
And just take care of it.

00:14:35.876 --> 00:14:38.580 position:30% line:89% align:start
(mellow music)

00:14:40.515 --> 00:14:41.583 position:24% line:89% align:start
This was Mikey's...

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:45.620 position:7% line:89% align:start
This is just too heavy for me.

00:14:47.988 --> 00:14:51.392 position:13% line:83% align:start
You think I could be
deserving of this someday?

00:14:51.425 --> 00:14:53.060 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Draken chuckles)

00:14:53.093 --> 00:14:54.128 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Draken] Go ask him.

00:14:54.161 --> 00:14:55.563 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:14:55.597 --> 00:14:58.265 position:13% line:83% align:start
He's probably taking a nap
up on the roof right now.

00:15:08.242 --> 00:15:09.042 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hey, Mikey!

00:15:10.444 --> 00:15:11.979 position:27% line:89% align:start
I can't shake it.

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:14.081 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:15:15.082 --> 00:15:17.685 position:7% line:89% align:start
This uneasy feeling in my head.

00:15:17.719 --> 00:15:18.952 position:13% line:89% align:start
Why did Hanma want to start

00:15:18.986 --> 00:15:21.890 position:21% line:83% align:start
an internal conflict
inside Toman?

00:15:21.922 --> 00:15:24.024 position:19% line:83% align:start
Why did he use Kiyomasa
and his lackeys

00:15:24.057 --> 00:15:25.860 position:19% line:89% align:start
to try and kill Kenny?

00:15:25.894 --> 00:15:28.262 position:19% line:83% align:start
And the biggest
mystery of all is you,

00:15:28.295 --> 00:15:30.931 position:7% line:83% align:start
who somehow realized that that
inner conflict was happening,

00:15:30.964 --> 00:15:32.933 position:21% line:83% align:start
and that someone was
out to get Kenny,

00:15:32.966 --> 00:15:35.035 position:19% line:89% align:start
before anyone else did.

00:15:35.068 --> 00:15:39.139 position:16% line:83% align:start
Not only that, you tried
to stop it, Takemitchy.

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:44.712 position:21% line:83% align:start
So tell me who the
hell you really are.

00:15:47.549 --> 00:15:49.617 position:30% line:89% align:start
You know I'm...

00:15:49.651 --> 00:15:50.652 position:41% line:89% align:start
I'm...

00:15:57.991 --> 00:16:01.195 position:16% line:83% align:start
(laughs) What the hell's
with that lame getup?

00:16:01.228 --> 00:16:02.196 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:16:02.229 --> 00:16:03.665 position:7% line:89% align:start
You look even lamer than usual.

00:16:03.698 --> 00:16:05.733 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hey, that's not cool!

00:16:05.767 --> 00:16:07.434 position:24% line:83% align:start
-This is my, uh...
-Well, whatever.

00:16:07.468 --> 00:16:09.102 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh, uh...

00:16:09.136 --> 00:16:12.039 position:10% line:83% align:start
Kenny's still alive! And I
know it's all because of you.

00:16:15.108 --> 00:16:17.010 position:10% line:89% align:start
Thanks for that, Takemitchy.

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:30.792 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Mikey,

00:16:30.825 --> 00:16:32.292 position:41% line:89% align:start
Draken,

00:16:32.326 --> 00:16:33.327 position:41% line:89% align:start
Akkun.

00:16:34.629 --> 00:16:37.899 position:10% line:83% align:start
Honestly, I wish I could stay
here with you guys forever.

00:16:37.932 --> 00:16:39.032 position:44% line:89% align:start
But,

00:16:39.066 --> 00:16:40.200 position:24% line:89% align:start
I've gotta go home.

00:16:41.736 --> 00:16:42.737 position:30% line:89% align:start
Goodbye, guys.

00:16:46.708 --> 00:16:49.443 position:27% line:89% align:start
(doorbell rings)

00:16:50.712 --> 00:16:52.079 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh, hi Takemichi.

00:16:52.112 --> 00:16:55.550 position:16% line:83% align:start
You sure do like to show
up without any warning!

00:16:55.583 --> 00:16:56.784 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I know. My bad!

00:16:57.719 --> 00:17:00.387 position:16% line:89% align:start
Actually, is Naoto here?

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:01.388 position:41% line:89% align:start
Naoto!

00:17:01.421 --> 00:17:03.056 position:10% line:89% align:start
Takemichi is here to see you!

00:17:06.761 --> 00:17:08.328 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hold on, I'll go get him.

00:17:08.362 --> 00:17:09.129 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, Hina...

00:17:09.162 --> 00:17:11.365 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Hm?
-Uh...

00:17:11.398 --> 00:17:12.199 position:44% line:89% align:start
Here.

00:17:14.736 --> 00:17:15.970 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:17:16.004 --> 00:17:17.204 position:19% line:89% align:start
You got me a necklace?

00:17:17.237 --> 00:17:19.574 position:27% line:83% align:start
Well, I wanted to
give you something

00:17:19.607 --> 00:17:20.808 position:13% line:89% align:start
after all of that trouble.

00:17:20.842 --> 00:17:21.976 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:24.177 position:27% line:83% align:start
Oh, yeah, right.
At the festival.

00:17:24.211 --> 00:17:26.714 position:16% line:83% align:start
I wish I could've gotten
you something more,

00:17:26.748 --> 00:17:27.916 position:21% line:89% align:start
something expensive.

00:17:27.949 --> 00:17:29.884 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Hinata] Oh, it's
a four-leaf clover!

00:17:29.918 --> 00:17:30.885 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Yeah.

00:17:30.919 --> 00:17:31.886 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:33.186 position:27% line:89% align:start
Can I put it on?

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:34.187 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Sure.

00:17:36.256 --> 00:17:39.126 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's not really just to
make things up to you.

00:17:39.159 --> 00:17:41.094 position:19% line:83% align:start
I just wanted to leave
something behind.

00:17:41.128 --> 00:17:42.296 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Hinata] How do I look?

00:17:42.329 --> 00:17:43.598 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:17:43.631 --> 00:17:45.299 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Hinata laughs)

00:17:45.332 --> 00:17:48.268 position:7% line:83% align:start
Because I won't be able to see
the you in the past anymore.

00:17:50.337 --> 00:17:51.438 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:17:51.471 --> 00:17:52.272 position:33% line:89% align:start
Looks great.

00:17:53.273 --> 00:17:56.176 position:24% line:83% align:start
I already love it.
Thank you so much.

00:17:57.477 --> 00:17:58.613 position:35% line:89% align:start
Uh, hello?

00:17:58.646 --> 00:17:59.647 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Hinata gasps)

00:17:59.681 --> 00:18:01.616 position:19% line:83% align:start
Sorry to interrupt your
flirting, but here I am.

00:18:02.717 --> 00:18:04.184 position:13% line:89% align:start
Didn't you want to see me?

00:18:04.217 --> 00:18:05.853 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Hinata] How long have
you been standing there?!

00:18:05.887 --> 00:18:07.120 position:13% line:89% align:start
Nice score on the present.

00:18:07.154 --> 00:18:08.690 position:19% line:83% align:start
Were you eavesdropping
all this time!?

00:18:08.723 --> 00:18:10.592 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm only here because
you yelled for me.

00:18:10.625 --> 00:18:13.460 position:21% line:83% align:start
That doesn't mean you
can sneak up on us!

00:18:13.493 --> 00:18:14.294 position:38% line:89% align:start
Naoto...

00:18:15.063 --> 00:18:16.229 position:30% line:89% align:start
Put 'er there!

00:18:17.464 --> 00:18:18.533 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:18:18.566 --> 00:18:20.902 position:13% line:83% align:start
Wow, Takemichi, you must
really love shaking hands.

00:18:20.935 --> 00:18:22.870 position:27% line:83% align:start
(chuckles) Yeah,
you got me there!

00:18:22.904 --> 00:18:23.871 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hina?

00:18:23.905 --> 00:18:25.105 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:18:25.907 --> 00:18:27.140 position:30% line:89% align:start
Be happy, okay?

00:18:28.943 --> 00:18:30.477 position:27% line:89% align:start
What's that mean?

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:33.748 position:41% line:89% align:start
Naoto.

00:18:33.781 --> 00:18:35.617 position:21% line:89% align:start
Mm. Sure, all right.

00:18:39.988 --> 00:18:41.589 position:21% line:89% align:start
(electricity cackles)

00:18:41.623 --> 00:18:43.223 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Takemichi] I kept
Draken from dying,

00:18:43.256 --> 00:18:45.793 position:19% line:83% align:start
which means he's still
Toman's number two.

00:18:45.827 --> 00:18:49.196 position:13% line:83% align:start
So now, Kisaki won't be
taking over that position.

00:18:50.163 --> 00:18:52.265 position:21% line:83% align:start
Mikey changed because
of Draken's death.

00:18:53.433 --> 00:18:55.402 position:19% line:83% align:start
Akkun committed suicide
out of fear of Kisaki

00:18:55.435 --> 00:18:58.806 position:24% line:83% align:start
and Hina was killed
by the evil version

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:00.642 position:19% line:89% align:start
of Toman in my future.

00:19:00.675 --> 00:19:03.778 position:10% line:83% align:start
With Draken still alive, all
of that should have changed!

00:19:04.979 --> 00:19:06.948 position:33% line:89% align:start
Right, Naoto?

00:19:06.981 --> 00:19:10.317 position:19% line:89% align:start
(electricity cackling)

00:19:11.619 --> 00:19:14.689 position:13% line:83% align:start
So how many times do I have
to repeat myself, Hanagaki?

00:19:14.722 --> 00:19:17.692 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're gonna drive me
right out of my mind.

00:19:17.725 --> 00:19:20.227 position:19% line:89% align:start
Huh? What did you say?

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.897 position:21% line:83% align:start
As soon as a DVD gets
returned to the store,

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:24.932 position:7% line:89% align:start
you get it back onto the shelf!

00:19:24.966 --> 00:19:27.101 position:27% line:83% align:start
Now get your butt
in gear already.

00:19:27.135 --> 00:19:29.704 position:10% line:89% align:start
Ah! I'm back at work again?!

00:19:29.737 --> 00:19:30.705 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:19:30.738 --> 00:19:31.839 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:19:31.873 --> 00:19:34.042 position:13% line:83% align:start
Wait, what's going on?
What am I doing back here?

00:19:34.075 --> 00:19:35.743 position:21% line:83% align:start
I thought I was
fired from this job!

00:19:35.777 --> 00:19:38.646 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hey, and how come
I'm not with Naoto?

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:39.814 position:30% line:89% align:start
Wait! My phone!

00:19:43.151 --> 00:19:44.484 position:16% line:89% align:start
No matter where I search,

00:19:44.519 --> 00:19:47.320 position:19% line:83% align:start
the incident where Hina
died isn't coming up!

00:19:47.354 --> 00:19:50.290 position:10% line:83% align:start
Does that mean the time
travel was all just a dream?

00:19:50.323 --> 00:19:52.694 position:10% line:89% align:start
I... I have to talk to Naoto!

00:19:52.727 --> 00:19:55.797 position:13% line:83% align:start
Why isn't his phone number
here in my contacts?!

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:56.798 position:44% line:89% align:start
Argh!

00:19:56.831 --> 00:20:00.034 position:33% line:89% align:start
(phone drops)

00:20:00.068 --> 00:20:02.904 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasps)

00:20:09.342 --> 00:20:11.079 position:24% line:89% align:start
It wasn't a dream!

00:20:11.112 --> 00:20:14.381 position:27% line:83% align:start
-(phone vibrates)
-(Takemichi gasps)

00:20:14.414 --> 00:20:16.751 position:16% line:89% align:start
A schedule notification?

00:20:16.784 --> 00:20:18.820 position:24% line:89% align:start
Huh? A hair salon?

00:20:18.853 --> 00:20:20.855 position:30% line:89% align:start
What the hell?

00:20:20.888 --> 00:20:23.691 position:21% line:89% align:start
(indistinct chatter)

00:20:33.901 --> 00:20:34.902 position:41% line:89% align:start
Akkun.

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:37.538 position:41% line:89% align:start
Akkun!

00:20:37.572 --> 00:20:38.806 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:40.340 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi sobs)

00:20:40.373 --> 00:20:43.343 position:21% line:83% align:start
(chuckles) What are
you doing here, dude?

00:20:43.376 --> 00:20:45.646 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're early. Aren't you
supposed to be at work?

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.647 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I left.

00:20:46.681 --> 00:20:49.117 position:7% line:89% align:start
Man, you're so gonna get fired.

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:52.252 position:16% line:83% align:start
So Akkun, you really did
become a hairstylist?

00:20:52.285 --> 00:20:55.189 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, I'm just startin'
out, like I told you.

00:20:55.223 --> 00:20:57.491 position:19% line:83% align:start
Right now, I'm working
as an assistant.

00:20:57.525 --> 00:20:58.726 position:47% line:89% align:start
Mm.

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:00.928 position:19% line:83% align:start
But here's the reason I
called you in tonight.

00:21:00.962 --> 00:21:02.163 position:10% line:89% align:start
They're finally gonna let me

00:21:02.196 --> 00:21:04.431 position:16% line:83% align:start
start cutting customers'
hair next month.

00:21:04.464 --> 00:21:06.134 position:10% line:89% align:start
And you, you'll be my first.

00:21:06.167 --> 00:21:07.969 position:10% line:89% align:start
You know, my first customer.

00:21:09.137 --> 00:21:10.772 position:19% line:89% align:start
We promised, remember?

00:21:10.805 --> 00:21:11.939 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasps)

00:21:11.973 --> 00:21:13.775 position:7% line:89% align:start
Let me be your first customer!

00:21:13.808 --> 00:21:16.110 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh, okay?

00:21:16.144 --> 00:21:17.245 position:38% line:89% align:start
Awesome!

00:21:17.277 --> 00:21:18.813 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm gonna hold you to that!

00:21:21.949 --> 00:21:23.316 position:21% line:89% align:start
What the hell, man!?

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:25.253 position:19% line:83% align:start
You didn't forget about
all that, did you?

00:21:25.285 --> 00:21:27.454 position:19% line:83% align:start
No, you dumbass! Of
course I didn't forget!

00:21:27.487 --> 00:21:29.056 position:21% line:89% align:start
Wait, are you crying?

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:30.892 position:35% line:89% align:start
What?! No!

00:21:30.925 --> 00:21:32.325 position:10% line:89% align:start
No, of course I'm not crying!

00:21:32.359 --> 00:21:33.961 position:19% line:83% align:start
Man, you're still such
a crybaby, Takemichi.

00:21:33.995 --> 00:21:37.297 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi sniffles)

00:21:38.498 --> 00:21:41.636 position:19% line:83% align:start
This proves it! I think
I finally believe it!

00:21:41.669 --> 00:21:43.905 position:7% line:89% align:start
I actually changed the present!

00:21:43.938 --> 00:21:46.339 position:10% line:89% align:start
It worked! It really worked!

00:21:46.373 --> 00:21:47.542 position:33% line:89% align:start
(phone rings)

00:21:47.575 --> 00:21:48.375 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:51.378 position:7% line:89% align:start
I wonder whose number this is?

00:21:51.411 --> 00:21:53.147 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hey, so what's up?

00:21:53.181 --> 00:21:54.347 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Naoto] You must have succeeded.

00:21:54.381 --> 00:21:56.884 position:21% line:89% align:start
What now? Who's this?

00:21:56.918 --> 00:21:59.887 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Naoto] And you just returned
from the past, right?

00:21:59.921 --> 00:22:01.155 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, Naoto!

00:22:01.189 --> 00:22:02.857 position:16% line:89% align:start
Listen, man. You did it!

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:05.860 position:10% line:83% align:start
You pulled this off! Thanks
to you, everything's changed!

00:22:07.261 --> 00:22:08.461 position:33% line:89% align:start
Takemichi...

00:22:08.495 --> 00:22:11.966 position:24% line:83% align:start
So what do you say?
Wanna see my sister?

00:22:11.999 --> 00:22:13.801 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Takemichi gasps)

00:22:13.835 --> 00:22:14.769 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takemichi] Hina?

00:22:14.802 --> 00:22:15.870 position:33% line:89% align:start
She's alive?!

00:22:17.905 --> 00:22:20.875 position:21% line:89% align:start
