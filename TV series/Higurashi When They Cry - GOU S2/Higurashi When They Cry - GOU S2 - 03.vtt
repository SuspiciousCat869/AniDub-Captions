00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.884
[rustling]

00:00:50.926 --> 00:00:52.302
[gasps softly]

00:01:02.688 --> 00:01:09.403
[RENA pants]

00:02:52.756 --> 00:02:55.175
[RENA screams]

00:02:55.217 --> 00:02:58.345
There are two others out there,
so why are you coming after me?

00:02:58.387 --> 00:02:59.763
Why me?

00:03:01.223 --> 00:03:02.724
No way I could pass up a pair

00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:04.976
of plump,
delicious thighs like yours!

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:08.271
Yes, you're going to make
quite the feast for us tonight.

00:03:08.313 --> 00:03:10.899
The meat on your arms looks
so succulent and tender,

00:03:10.941 --> 00:03:12.901
I can almost taste it already!

00:03:12.943 --> 00:03:15.654
But I don't wanna be eaten.

00:03:15.696 --> 00:03:17.739
Please stay away!

00:03:19.574 --> 00:03:21.201
I should be safe here.

00:03:21.243 --> 00:03:22.744
Huh? Ah!

00:03:22.786 --> 00:03:24.705
It's you, Rika!

00:03:25.372 --> 00:03:26.581
[KEIICHI]
Hmm?

00:03:26.623 --> 00:03:29.126
[RENA pants]
Are you still alive?

00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:31.211
I've managed
to pull through so far.

00:03:31.253 --> 00:03:33.505
Satoko and Mion
were chasing after me!

00:03:33.547 --> 00:03:35.674
Well, you're safe here with me!

00:03:35.716 --> 00:03:37.509
That's such a relief.

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:40.679
Huh? Rika? Please stop that.

00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:42.848
Stop it.

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.350
Wait. Don't come
any closer, please.

00:03:45.392 --> 00:03:47.185
Please don't!

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:49.187
[RIKA]
It won't hurt, Rena.

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:50.480
You won't feel a thing.

00:03:50.522 --> 00:03:52.232
What do you mean it won't hurt?

00:03:52.274 --> 00:03:55.444
[RIKA] When I'm eating
you alive. Miiii!

00:03:55.777 --> 00:03:56.611
Would you really?

00:03:56.653 --> 00:03:58.280
Would you really do that?

00:03:58.321 --> 00:04:00.157
You wouldn't, Rika!

00:04:01.867 --> 00:04:03.201
[RENA screams]

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:06.830
She's gonna eat me, Keiichi!

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:12.127
[sighs]

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:13.920
That was crazy.

00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:16.131
What an intense game of tag!

00:04:22.053 --> 00:04:23.847
And who'd have guessed.

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:26.516
That Rena had the guts to
just take someone out like that.

00:04:26.558 --> 00:04:28.393
[gasps]

00:04:31.813 --> 00:04:34.524
[KEIICHI]
Mion, you friggin' lying jerk.

00:04:34.566 --> 00:04:35.650
Ah.

00:04:35.692 --> 00:04:37.360
Huh?!

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.073
Here, you can use this.

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:44.201
[KEIICHI]
Oh, perfect. Thank you.

00:04:58.924 --> 00:05:02.719
[RENA]
Work harder. Can't stop now.

00:05:03.887 --> 00:05:05.180
Work harder. And harder!

00:05:05.222 --> 00:05:06.932
And harder! And harder!

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:09.518
Gotta work harder!

00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:12.395
Can't stop.

00:05:12.437 --> 00:05:14.147
Gotta work harder.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.277
[MION] Then you're
in for a big surprise!

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:20.403
Our main event.

00:05:20.445 --> 00:05:22.572
It's the Four‐Demon
Battle Royale!

00:05:22.614 --> 00:05:24.491
Well, the name's
interesting at least.

00:05:24.533 --> 00:05:25.575
Now that we have Keiichi,

00:05:25.617 --> 00:05:28.286
we need to make it a Five‐Demon
Battle Royale, though.

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:30.038
[chortles]

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.040
This challenge will be
the perfect chance for you

00:05:32.082 --> 00:05:34.459
to put everything we've
taught you into practice!

00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:35.502
That's right!

00:05:35.544 --> 00:05:37.462
We'll be making the rounds
through the festival stalls

00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:40.048
and playing club games.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.591
So that's how it is?

00:05:42.425 --> 00:05:45.512
Now I'm getting
kind of excited, too!

00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:02.112
[RENA laughs]

00:06:02.153 --> 00:06:05.115
It's done. It's gonna be okay!

00:06:05.156 --> 00:06:09.494
Nobody knows where to look
the police or anyone else!

00:06:09.536 --> 00:06:10.912
[KEIICHI]
Hey! Rena!

00:06:10.954 --> 00:06:12.622
Workin' up a sweat?

00:06:14.416 --> 00:06:16.793
[RENA] Even all this
hard work wasn't enough.

00:06:17.836 --> 00:06:20.046
Or maybe.

00:06:20.088 --> 00:06:23.925
Maybe this is still punishment
for my family's sin.

00:06:23.967 --> 00:06:27.846
Maybe it's because we broke
the rules and left Hinamizawa.

00:06:30.307 --> 00:06:33.351
Please, tell me. I beg you.

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:35.353
How much longer do we have
to suffer your curse

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:37.564
before you're satisfied?

00:06:37.606 --> 00:06:39.357
When will this end?

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:43.028
I beg you to grant my family
your forgiveness, Lord Oyashiro!

00:06:51.494 --> 00:06:52.329
Hey there, kids.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:53.747
Looks like you're
having a good time.

00:06:53.788 --> 00:06:55.874
Not that it isn't a
pleasure to see you here,

00:06:55.916 --> 00:06:58.627
but I must point out how rude it
is to be taking pictures

00:06:58.668 --> 00:07:01.046
of a lady without
asking her permission.

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:04.257
That's true, but he was
taking a picture of you.

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:24.486
â™ª

00:08:44.441 --> 00:08:45.817
Lord Oyashiro?

00:08:45.859 --> 00:08:48.236
It's the guardian
deity of Hinamizawa.

00:08:48.278 --> 00:08:52.115
That's why it's so important
that we all pay our respects.

00:08:52.157 --> 00:08:57.078
Thank you, our Lord Oyashiro.
Thank you, our Lord Oyashiro.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.873
A guardian deity?

00:08:59.914 --> 00:09:02.542
Thank you, our Lord Oyashiro.

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:23.188
Man, how far did Rena have
to go to track everybody down?

00:09:34.199 --> 00:09:39.579
[RENA] Yes or no, Keiichi?
Did you see or not?

00:09:39.621 --> 00:09:42.957
Did you? Or not?

00:09:49.756 --> 00:09:51.257
[CHIE]
Pardon me, Maebara.

00:09:51.299 --> 00:09:53.593
[KEIICHI]
Hi, Ms. Chie. What's up?

00:09:53.635 --> 00:09:55.303
There's someone
waiting at the front gate

00:09:55.345 --> 00:09:57.055
who says he would
like to see you.

00:09:57.097 --> 00:09:58.973
What? Who is it?

00:10:02.685 --> 00:10:06.022
[RENA] That old man
walking with Keiichi.

00:10:06.064 --> 00:10:10.568
I know him.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:11.903
Why would Keiichi
be hanging around

00:10:11.945 --> 00:10:14.572
with a police officer at school?

00:10:14.614 --> 00:10:16.407
Why here?

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:20.078
Why? Why? Why?

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:20.912
[SATOKO]
Ah!

00:10:20.954 --> 00:10:23.873
That's one more club member
present and accounted for!

00:10:23.915 --> 00:10:26.876
Honestly, now, where could
Keiichi have gotten off to?

00:10:26.918 --> 00:10:27.794
Though in any case,

00:10:27.836 --> 00:10:30.880
we can't delay the meeting
on his account, can we, Rena?

00:10:30.922 --> 00:10:32.298
There's been a gruesome murder,

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.134
and it's up to us
to guess the right cards

00:10:34.175 --> 00:10:36.719
and reveal the killer!

00:10:36.761 --> 00:10:39.973
[RENA]
Sorry. Be right there, okay?

00:10:40.014 --> 00:10:41.015
What is this?

00:10:41.057 --> 00:10:42.809
Is your neck bothering you?

00:10:42.851 --> 00:10:45.353
[RENA] Oh, no!
It's nothing to worry about.

00:10:45.395 --> 00:10:46.437
Just itchy.

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:48.148
I'm not sure what it is.

00:10:48.189 --> 00:10:51.151
It's been like this
lately for some reason.

00:10:51.192 --> 00:10:54.487
Well, that's unfortunate, but
hopefully it will clear up soon.

00:10:54.529 --> 00:10:56.823
I'm sure I'll be fine,
thank you.

00:11:09.043 --> 00:11:10.503
I have a question.

00:11:10.545 --> 00:11:12.505
Have you guys been lying
to me about anything

00:11:12.547 --> 00:11:14.382
or keeping something
hidden from me?

00:11:14.424 --> 00:11:17.468
Huh? We would never do that!

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:18.595
Yes, you would.

00:11:18.636 --> 00:11:20.763
[RENA]
Keiichi, why would you say that?

00:11:20.805 --> 00:11:21.806
It's the truth!

00:11:21.848 --> 00:11:23.057
You never said a word about‐‐

00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:25.143
Okay. How 'bout you?

00:11:25.185 --> 00:11:26.603
Fair's fair, isn't it?

00:11:26.644 --> 00:11:28.313
So, what are you not telling me?

00:11:28.354 --> 00:11:30.315
We're friends, aren't we?

00:11:30.356 --> 00:11:31.649
So, have you lied?

00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:32.859
Have you been lying to me

00:11:32.901 --> 00:11:34.611
or keeping something
hidden from me?

00:11:34.652 --> 00:11:35.820
Of course not.

00:11:35.862 --> 00:11:37.238
I've always been
honest with you.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.198
That's a lie.

00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:39.449
Why do you think I'm lying?

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:40.658
[RENA]
Because I saw it.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.702
You hid something
from me at the junkyard.

00:11:42.744 --> 00:11:44.913
Something you didn't
want me knowing you'd seen.

00:11:44.954 --> 00:11:45.747
Hold on.

00:11:45.788 --> 00:11:47.290
[RENA] And you lied
about where you were

00:11:47.332 --> 00:11:48.374
during the club meeting.

00:11:48.416 --> 00:11:50.168
You didn't really go to the
teacher's office, did you?

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:51.002
How do you‐‐

00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:53.129
[RENA] You were outside
in a car talking to someone,

00:11:53.171 --> 00:11:55.506
an older man I didn't recognize.

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:57.300
Now who was he, that man?

00:11:57.342 --> 00:11:58.927
I didn't catch his name, but...

00:11:58.968 --> 00:12:02.055
And why would a total stranger
come to talk with you at school?

00:12:02.096 --> 00:12:03.723
What, how would I know that?

00:12:03.765 --> 00:12:05.725
Well, you know what you
talked about, don't you?

00:12:05.767 --> 00:12:07.518
It had nothing to do with you!

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.062
You liar!

00:12:15.526 --> 00:12:16.945
[ICHIRO]
Keiichi!

00:12:18.863 --> 00:12:21.157
[ICHIRO] Someone from the
bookstore is calling you.

00:12:21.199 --> 00:12:22.909
The bookstore?

00:12:22.951 --> 00:12:24.702
[ICHIRO]
Oh, hi, good to see you, Rena!

00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:26.829
Nice to see you as well, sir!

00:12:26.871 --> 00:12:28.998
[ICHIRO] Please, no need
to stand around out there!

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.166
Come on inside.

00:12:30.208 --> 00:12:32.085
Keiichi is up in his room.

00:12:32.126 --> 00:12:33.753
[RENA]
Thank you for having me!

00:12:33.795 --> 00:12:35.463
[ICHIRO]
You know where that is, right?

00:12:35.505 --> 00:12:37.757
Just up the stairs,
on your left.

00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:38.633
[RENA]
I got it.

00:12:38.675 --> 00:12:40.218
Thank you, though!

00:12:41.261 --> 00:12:42.762
[ICHIRO] Oh, uh, hey,
if you'll give me a second,

00:12:42.804 --> 00:12:44.514
I've got some snacks
for you two.

00:12:44.555 --> 00:12:45.848
Awoo!

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:48.226
[ICHIRO] You go ahead,
I'll bring them up.

00:12:48.268 --> 00:12:49.644
Snacks are my favorite!

00:12:49.686 --> 00:12:50.770
[ICHIRO chuckles]

00:12:50.853 --> 00:12:53.147
You two enjoy yourselves, okay?

00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:54.565
[RENA]
We will!

00:13:09.831 --> 00:13:13.293
[KEIICHI]
Yes, Detective. Please, tell me!

00:13:13.334 --> 00:13:14.836
I'd like to hear it.

00:13:17.171 --> 00:13:20.425
Yeah, she told me she'd
just moved here recently.

00:13:23.469 --> 00:13:25.513
[KEIICHI]
Really?

00:13:43.573 --> 00:13:45.658
[RENA] He was on the phone
with that detective.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.578
He was talking on the
phone to the detective!

00:13:48.619 --> 00:13:51.789
Talking about me
with that detective!

00:13:57.837 --> 00:14:00.298
It'll be fine.

00:14:01.966 --> 00:14:04.427
You don't need to worry, Dad.

00:14:04.469 --> 00:14:06.471
I just have to work harder.

00:14:14.062 --> 00:14:15.688
I'm home.

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:17.148
Ahh.

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:19.275
Hey there, Reina you're back.

00:14:19.317 --> 00:14:21.569
You remembered to eat lunch
today, didn't you?

00:14:21.611 --> 00:14:25.531
[RENA'S DAD chuckles] I honestly
just wasn't very hungry.

00:14:25.573 --> 00:14:27.075
[RENA]
Are you okay?

00:14:27.116 --> 00:14:28.701
[RENA'S DAD]
A little worried.

00:14:28.743 --> 00:14:31.245
I haven't been able
to get in touch with Rina.

00:14:31.287 --> 00:14:34.415
And she apparently hasn't shown
up for work the past few days.

00:14:34.457 --> 00:14:35.708
That's not good.

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:36.751
I hope she's okay.

00:14:36.793 --> 00:14:39.212
[phone rings]

00:14:39.253 --> 00:14:42.173
You just relax and let me
get the phone, okay, Dad?

00:14:42.215 --> 00:14:44.008
Sure, thanks.

00:14:45.968 --> 00:14:47.804
[AIKO]
Hello? Is this Rena?

00:14:47.845 --> 00:14:49.555
[RENA]
Keiichi's mom, is that you?

00:14:49.597 --> 00:14:51.599
[AIKO]
Hi there! Sorry to bother you,

00:14:51.641 --> 00:14:53.726
but I was hoping
I could ask you a favor.

00:14:53.768 --> 00:14:56.437
[RENA] Is there something you
need me to do for Keiichi?

00:14:56.479 --> 00:14:58.731
[AIKO] Yeah. I got called
into the city for work,

00:14:58.773 --> 00:15:00.650
and I'm gonna
have to stay overnight.

00:15:00.691 --> 00:15:03.736
Keiichi's stuck home all
by himself right now.

00:15:03.778 --> 00:15:05.405
[RENA]
What about his dad?

00:15:05.446 --> 00:15:07.073
[AIKO]
I had to bring him with me.

00:15:07.115 --> 00:15:09.283
Sorry to ask this
on such short notice,

00:15:09.325 --> 00:15:11.994
but I really need your help.

00:15:12.036 --> 00:15:14.372
You don't have to worry
about a thing, ma'am.

00:15:14.414 --> 00:15:17.542
I'll be happy to come over
and make dinner for Keiichi!

00:15:17.583 --> 00:15:19.877
[AIKO]
Oh, thank you so much, dear!

00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:21.629
We have plenty
of stuff in the fridge,

00:15:21.671 --> 00:15:25.550
and you're free to use whatever
you need in the kitchen, okay?

00:15:37.937 --> 00:15:39.856
Was there somewhere
you needed to be?

00:15:39.897 --> 00:15:42.150
[RENA] Yeah. I'm going
to Keiichi's house.

00:15:42.191 --> 00:15:43.860
I hope you don't mind
if dinner is a bit later

00:15:43.901 --> 00:15:45.486
than usual tonight.

00:15:45.528 --> 00:15:47.488
[RENA'S DAD]
Don't worry about it.

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:49.991
Just be safe out there, okay?

00:15:50.032 --> 00:15:53.035
Yeah! I'm gonna go work hard.

00:16:04.213 --> 00:16:06.966
[doorbell rings]

00:16:14.474 --> 00:16:15.558
[RENA]
Hey, Keiichi?

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.477
Please open the door.

00:16:17.518 --> 00:16:19.187
[KEIICHI]
Oh. Hey, Rena.

00:16:19.228 --> 00:16:20.605
Your mom called to tell me
she was going to be

00:16:20.646 --> 00:16:22.315
out of town for the night.

00:16:22.356 --> 00:16:25.151
She asked me if I would come
and bring you dinner.

00:16:25.193 --> 00:16:26.986
[KEIICHI]
Oh. That's a surprise.

00:16:27.028 --> 00:16:29.530
She hadn't mentioned it to me.

00:16:30.364 --> 00:16:33.034
[RENA] I made a lot so we
would have plenty to share,

00:16:33.075 --> 00:16:34.660
so it's heavy.

00:16:34.702 --> 00:16:36.245
Would you please let me in?

00:16:36.287 --> 00:16:37.955
Can I come in, please?

00:16:37.997 --> 00:16:40.958
Why are you being
so mean to me right now?

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.293
Why?

00:16:43.669 --> 00:16:46.255
Did Rena say or do
anything to scare you?

00:16:46.297 --> 00:16:47.507
[KEIICHI]
It's crazy, right?

00:16:47.548 --> 00:16:49.800
She's a close friend,
and I care about her a lot,

00:16:49.842 --> 00:16:52.762
but sometimes, she...

00:16:52.803 --> 00:16:55.515
...she looks at me
with this dead stare,

00:16:55.556 --> 00:16:57.683
and her eyes are
so cold and empty,

00:16:57.725 --> 00:16:58.768
and it does scare me.

00:16:58.809 --> 00:17:00.478
"You liar."

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:03.314
If that's what you're worried
about, it was just one moment,

00:17:03.356 --> 00:17:06.150
and you shouldn't
get hung up on it.

00:17:06.192 --> 00:17:07.735
Maybe it hit
you harder than usual

00:17:07.777 --> 00:17:09.779
'cause you were tired
when she said it.

00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:11.405
Or maybe some anxiety of yours

00:17:11.447 --> 00:17:13.824
is making things seem
worse than they are.

00:17:13.866 --> 00:17:15.117
You should try
to keep that in mind

00:17:15.159 --> 00:17:18.955
if you ever find yourself
feeling scared of Rena again.

00:17:18.996 --> 00:17:20.915
So, make sure it's not
actually your own troubles

00:17:20.957 --> 00:17:23.084
that are making you worry, okay?

00:17:27.505 --> 00:17:28.881
It's okay.

00:17:35.179 --> 00:17:36.639
Huh?

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:44.981
Hold on. Does that
mean you are feeling better,

00:17:45.022 --> 00:17:47.650
or you're hungry, or uh...?

00:18:03.874 --> 00:18:06.586
Now everything
is going to be okay.

00:18:06.627 --> 00:18:09.338
[laughs]

00:18:10.798 --> 00:18:13.175
I know you can win, Keiichi!

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:17.221
Let's go!

00:18:17.263 --> 00:18:18.764
You've got this!

00:18:43.247 --> 00:18:45.583
[school bell rings]

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.419
Why, good morning, everybody!

00:18:48.461 --> 00:18:49.378
[STUDENT A]
Morning!

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:51.422
Good morning.

00:18:51.464 --> 00:18:54.383
Good morning to you, too!

00:18:54.425 --> 00:18:56.177
Where are Keiichi and Rena?

00:18:57.053 --> 00:18:59.764
[CHIE]
Good morning, class.

00:18:59.805 --> 00:19:00.973
I know it's a bit early,

00:19:01.015 --> 00:19:03.476
but could everybody
please take your seats?

00:19:03.517 --> 00:19:05.936
I have an important
announcement to make.

00:19:05.978 --> 00:19:08.272
I wonder what
this could be about.

00:19:08.314 --> 00:19:09.815
But how could this be?

00:19:09.857 --> 00:19:11.651
This isn't right.

00:19:11.692 --> 00:19:14.779
[CHIE] Please listen
and stay calm, okay?

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:17.073
Last night.

00:19:17.114 --> 00:19:19.200
Your classmates,
Ryugu and Maebara,

00:19:19.241 --> 00:19:22.370
were found unconscious,
with serious injuries.

00:19:22.411 --> 00:19:24.038
Maebara is recovering.

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.957
He's currently staying
in the hospital.

00:19:26.999 --> 00:19:29.418
But unfortunately, Ryugu was‐‐

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:31.545
[RIKA]
That's a lie!

00:19:36.967 --> 00:19:39.637
I couldn't
believe it either, Rika.

00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:41.055
I've been trying
to make sense of it

00:19:41.097 --> 00:19:43.015
since the police called
to tell us about it,

00:19:43.057 --> 00:19:45.601
but it doesn't seem real.

00:19:45.643 --> 00:19:47.103
[SATOKO]
Rika?

00:19:47.144 --> 00:19:49.563
[CHIE] Miss Furude, I'm not
done with my announcement.

00:19:49.605 --> 00:19:52.066
Please stay in your seat.

00:19:52.108 --> 00:19:53.859
[RIKA]
You're not done?

00:19:53.901 --> 00:19:56.278
I am. It's over.

00:19:59.365 --> 00:20:02.034
[SATOKO] Don't worry, I'll
check on her when I get home.

00:20:03.494 --> 00:20:05.621
[CHIE]
Thank you, Miss Hojo.

00:21:14.106 --> 00:21:19.069
[RIKA grunting]

00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:20.988
[screams]

00:21:28.412 --> 00:21:30.915
[SATOKO] I'm here
to check up on you, Rika.

00:21:42.259 --> 00:21:44.887
And you wasted no time dying.

00:21:44.929 --> 00:21:47.765
You've taken care of a very
important step for me.

00:21:47.807 --> 00:21:51.811
Now I can follow you
into your next life.

00:21:53.854 --> 00:21:56.482
[SATOKO] No doubt you think
this was simply bad luck.

00:21:56.524 --> 00:21:58.442
You abandoned this fragment,

00:21:58.484 --> 00:22:00.945
hoping to escape
tragedy in the next.

00:22:00.986 --> 00:22:03.280
I'm certain that's
what you had planned.

00:22:03.322 --> 00:22:05.157
but I simply can't allow it.

00:22:05.199 --> 00:22:07.785
You will surrender
your dream or suffer loss

00:22:07.827 --> 00:22:12.206
after tragic loss,
death after miserable death.

00:22:12.248 --> 00:22:15.292
under the curse
of Lord Oyashiro.

00:23:53.057 --> 00:23:56.352
