WEBVTT

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:28.445
Rika!

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.958
So, you've come
to another tragic ending.

00:00:46.922 --> 00:00:50.592
Long ago, in my old life,
among mortal‐kind.

00:00:50.634 --> 00:00:54.012
So great was my despair
at the viciousness of men,

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:57.641
that I took on the burden of
their sins and through this act,

00:00:57.683 --> 00:01:02.062
cleansed the souls of those
for whom I gave my life.

00:01:02.104 --> 00:01:04.940
And to bear the burden
of enacting this sacrifice.

00:01:04.982 --> 00:01:08.110
I chose my own daughter.

00:01:08.151 --> 00:01:10.195
For the millennia
that came after.

00:01:10.237 --> 00:01:13.782
I would scorn the world
of men and its cruelty.

00:01:13.824 --> 00:01:15.909
And yet, there's
nothing in any realm

00:01:15.951 --> 00:01:17.703
that is without an end.

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:20.414
Before time's march,
buildings collapse,

00:01:20.455 --> 00:01:23.166
and even the hardest
hearts grow soft.

00:01:23.208 --> 00:01:25.627
The power which had kept me
from the world of men,

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:28.255
likewise crumbled in time.

00:01:28.297 --> 00:01:31.133
Should the first born to
the Furude line be a girl

00:01:31.174 --> 00:01:33.802
and all successors
for eight generations,

00:01:33.844 --> 00:01:37.764
it is said that Oyashiro
shall be reincarnated.

00:01:37.806 --> 00:01:39.808
And when you were born, Rika,

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.311
the eighth consecutive
female heir.

00:01:42.352 --> 00:01:46.815
At long last, I was once again
able to see the world of man,

00:01:46.857 --> 00:01:49.443
from which I had
turned away in disgust.

00:01:52.988 --> 00:01:55.866
[HANYUU] My millennia spent
rejecting the world of humanity,

00:01:55.907 --> 00:01:59.244
had been wasted in a cage
wrought from my own loneliness.

00:01:59.286 --> 00:02:02.122
Perhaps that was just
desserts for my own sin.

00:02:02.164 --> 00:02:03.373
I had charged my own daughter

00:02:03.415 --> 00:02:07.669
with the task of ending my life,
an unthinkable burden.

00:02:12.883 --> 00:02:15.969
As years passed, the line of
Furude women would carry on,

00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:18.513
until at last,
your mother was with child.

00:02:18.555 --> 00:02:20.724
I prayed fervently
you would be a girl

00:02:20.766 --> 00:02:23.518
and then the pain of
loneliness would fade.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.103
I would know my daughter again,

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:27.272
my first friend
in a thousand years.

00:02:27.314 --> 00:02:31.109
The one with whom I was
bound to share my life.

00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:35.739
But soon, in June of 1983,
as she first lived it.

00:02:35.781 --> 00:02:37.240
Once again,

00:02:37.282 --> 00:02:40.285
I would condemn her
to bear the weight of my sin.

00:02:40.327 --> 00:02:42.079
[laughs]

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.206
[HANYUU] In order to avert
your fated death,

00:02:44.247 --> 00:02:45.916
I granted you
the use of my power

00:02:45.957 --> 00:02:48.543
and turned you into one
who lives in loops.

00:02:48.585 --> 00:02:52.589
[TAKANO]
Easy, sleep well.

00:02:52.631 --> 00:02:54.549
Rika, my dear.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.144
[HANYUU] But that power
bore a flaw, and accepting it

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:10.273
would only bring you a
hundred years of suffering.

00:03:10.315 --> 00:03:13.610
The ordeal drove your spirit
to the very brink of death

00:03:13.652 --> 00:03:15.153
and you cursed the dice of fate

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:19.574
as they heaped yet more misery
upon you with each roll.

00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:24.454
Yet, still,
you refused to give up.

00:03:28.917 --> 00:03:30.085
Hanyuu Furude.

00:03:30.127 --> 00:03:31.378
How do you do?

00:03:32.754 --> 00:03:35.716
Awoo! She's adorable!

00:03:35.757 --> 00:03:38.301
Wait, she said her
family name is Furude, too.

00:03:38.343 --> 00:03:39.636
Yeah, just like mine!

00:03:39.678 --> 00:03:41.722
She's actually a distant cousin!

00:03:43.265 --> 00:03:44.891
[HANYUU]
And by the power of your will.

00:03:44.933 --> 00:03:48.311
I went from spectator to
participant in your struggle.

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:51.356
[HANYUU]
Then...

00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:54.735
Living in the world of man
is just a game of Old Maid.

00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:56.653
I was dealt the Joker by chance

00:03:56.695 --> 00:03:58.572
and there's
nobody left to take it.

00:03:59.865 --> 00:04:02.659
But I can at least take
my revenge by shooting you all!

00:04:02.701 --> 00:04:05.996
Isn't that only right,
in this irrational world?

00:04:08.874 --> 00:04:10.375
Hanyuu?

00:04:10.417 --> 00:04:11.543
[HANYUU]
Brave Mion,

00:04:11.585 --> 00:04:14.254
you have demonstrated
more than enough courage.

00:04:14.296 --> 00:04:16.006
If you're left with
the Joker in hand.

00:04:16.047 --> 00:04:18.258
and if there is nobody else
who can relieve you of it

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.677
in the world of man,
then it shall be my duty

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:23.263
to bear that burden
in their place.

00:04:23.305 --> 00:04:24.139
Hanyuu!

00:04:24.181 --> 00:04:26.141
What are you trying to do?

00:04:26.183 --> 00:04:29.603
[HANYUU] Rika, I had
so much fun in this world.

00:04:29.644 --> 00:04:31.438
Joining you in club was
far more enjoyable

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.940
than watching
the games play out.

00:04:33.982 --> 00:04:35.817
Thank you.

00:04:35.859 --> 00:04:37.652
Our time together has
brought me more happiness

00:04:37.694 --> 00:04:40.155
than a god could handle!

00:04:41.323 --> 00:04:43.492
Aim and fire, child of man!

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:45.702
Shoot me, and let me
take up the weight of the sin

00:04:45.744 --> 00:04:47.871
you must foist upon another!

00:04:47.913 --> 00:04:48.955
[TAKANO]
Fine.

00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:51.958
You wanna bear
the weight of my sins?

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.085
Then take it!

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.343
[HANYUU] After witnessing
a miracle in the world of men.

00:05:01.384 --> 00:05:06.181
I resumed my place within
the sea of fragments.

00:05:06.223 --> 00:05:09.142
Rika, may you sleep restfully.

00:05:09.184 --> 00:05:11.478
And have sweet dreams.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:40.966
Rika.

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:42.968
Though I knew what it meant.

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:47.347
Getting to be here with you
once more, it made me happy.

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.525
[OOISHI]
You're gonna tell me!

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:31.618
[OOISHI] Tell me! Tell me!
Tell me! Tell me!

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.370
Tell me!

00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:36.373
[screams]

00:07:36.414 --> 00:07:39.000
It's okay. You're no
longer in any danger, Rika.

00:07:42.212 --> 00:07:44.297
[HANYUU] The pain you feel
is but a memory.

00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:47.217
You need only calm down,
and it will quickly subside.

00:07:47.258 --> 00:07:49.469
[RIKA gasping]

00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:50.553
Ooishi.

00:07:50.595 --> 00:07:52.681
He's the one who killed me.

00:07:54.265 --> 00:07:55.141
[gasps]

00:07:55.183 --> 00:07:59.562
Somehow, I'm able to remember
who my killer was this time!

00:07:59.604 --> 00:08:01.147
What's happening?

00:08:04.192 --> 00:08:07.612
Your own foolishness
binds you to your fate.

00:08:09.531 --> 00:08:11.658
If only you'd stayed
with the cat until the end,

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:12.742
perhaps you could have saved her

00:08:12.784 --> 00:08:15.495
from the predicament in
which she now finds herself.

00:08:15.537 --> 00:08:17.789
So Rika can remember
who killed her?

00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:20.000
I'm not concerned
about it in the least.

00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:23.044
In fact, I'd say we should
welcome this development.

00:08:23.086 --> 00:08:24.129
[RIKA]
For a century.

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:27.215
A hundred years in Hinamizawa,
caged like a bird!

00:08:27.257 --> 00:08:30.885
Helplessly witnessing tragedy
after senseless tragedy!

00:08:30.927 --> 00:08:32.887
It took a miracle for
Keiichi and the others

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:35.306
to keep my soul alive this long!

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:38.643
I lived through 1983 and
the five years after it,

00:08:38.685 --> 00:08:40.478
but now I'm trapped
in this little girl's body

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.188
all over again!

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:44.399
I finally escaped
from that village.

00:08:44.441 --> 00:08:47.444
I grew up, and moved on,
and started a new life!

00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:49.112
Then suddenly,
after all those years,

00:08:49.154 --> 00:08:51.614
I was dragged back
to Hinamizawa!

00:08:51.656 --> 00:08:53.950
Do you understand
what that means?

00:08:55.118 --> 00:08:57.037
[RIKA]
Even if this new power works.

00:08:57.078 --> 00:09:00.290
Even if I can break the cycle
again, years could pass,

00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:03.793
and I could still wake up
in 1983 again someday!

00:09:03.835 --> 00:09:06.504
I might never be free!

00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:08.089
I'm so sorry.

00:09:08.131 --> 00:09:10.175
I need to know
you're here, or else,

00:09:10.216 --> 00:09:14.512
I'll have to fight this
endless battle by myself!

00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:21.019
[sobs]

00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:22.937
[HANYUU]
Rika, this is something I hoped

00:09:22.979 --> 00:09:25.356
I would never
have cause to tell you.

00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:29.527
But for your sake, it shall
be my parting message.

00:09:30.153 --> 00:09:33.239
In truth, of the many
artifacts bearing my name,

00:09:33.281 --> 00:09:34.783
there is one more holy,

00:09:34.824 --> 00:09:37.827
one more powerful
than any other by far.

00:09:37.869 --> 00:09:41.706
It's a sword by the
name of Onigari‐no‐ryuou.

00:09:41.748 --> 00:09:44.417
Its blade has the
ability to sever the loops

00:09:44.459 --> 00:09:46.628
and offer an end to
those for whom death

00:09:46.669 --> 00:09:48.505
is but another beginning.

00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:51.299
Those who live in loops
can be killed by that?

00:09:51.341 --> 00:09:53.927
But you are not just
a mere fledgling anymore.

00:09:53.968 --> 00:09:56.012
Huh?! No!

00:09:56.054 --> 00:09:58.306
This is our last farewell, Rika.

00:09:58.348 --> 00:10:01.392
From here on, your life and
your future are yours to shape,

00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:02.977
and yours alone.

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:04.437
Don't go!

00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:06.356
Stop, Hanyuu!

00:10:06.397 --> 00:10:08.817
Wait, please!

00:10:11.903 --> 00:10:13.571
Don't forget to enjoy
a cream puff for me

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:15.657
every now and again, okay?

00:10:15.698 --> 00:10:17.534
I could only hold on through
those hundred years

00:10:17.575 --> 00:10:19.327
because I had you!

00:10:19.369 --> 00:10:21.621
Please. Don't leave me now.

00:10:21.663 --> 00:10:22.956
I need you here!

00:10:22.997 --> 00:10:26.543
You can't go!

00:10:28.378 --> 00:10:30.046
I can't do this.

00:10:30.088 --> 00:10:31.840
Hanyuu.

00:10:34.175 --> 00:10:35.802
I'd like to play hide and seek.

00:10:35.844 --> 00:10:37.053
Hide and seek?

00:10:37.095 --> 00:10:38.805
Not what I expected.

00:10:38.847 --> 00:10:40.598
But it's always fun, right?

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.059
Okay, so where
will the boundaries be?

00:10:43.101 --> 00:10:44.727
Would the school grounds work?

00:10:44.769 --> 00:10:47.522
I should say we'll need
a bigger arena than that.

00:10:47.564 --> 00:10:50.525
[RIKA] Any place in
Hinamizawa will be fair game.

00:10:50.567 --> 00:10:52.402
As in the entire village?

00:10:52.443 --> 00:10:54.028
That may be too big.

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:55.655
[chortles]

00:10:55.697 --> 00:10:57.949
With my trapping skills
and knowledge of the terrain,

00:10:57.991 --> 00:10:59.784
I certainly won't be caught.

00:10:59.826 --> 00:11:00.702
Actually,

00:11:00.743 --> 00:11:03.329
in this version,
the only one hiding is me.

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:05.957
[MION]
How's that work?

00:11:08.751 --> 00:11:09.919
[SATOKO]
Rika!

00:11:09.961 --> 00:11:12.380
I know this is
where you're hiding,

00:11:12.422 --> 00:11:15.925
so you may as well come out now!

00:11:36.821 --> 00:11:37.989
That's right.

00:11:38.031 --> 00:11:41.826
I came here when we
were playing hide‐and‐seek.

00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:45.163
I snuck into the ritual tool
storehouse to hide,

00:11:45.205 --> 00:11:47.207
but Rika took all
the blame for it.

00:11:47.248 --> 00:11:48.583
And the punishment.

00:11:48.625 --> 00:11:49.417
It wasn't me!

00:11:49.459 --> 00:11:51.920
I swear I haven't
done anything wrong!

00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:54.005
I'm so sorry!

00:11:55.298 --> 00:11:57.091
And how long ago was that?

00:11:57.133 --> 00:11:59.093
Centuries now, I'm sure.

00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:01.846
But I could hardly say how many.

00:12:40.718 --> 00:12:42.637
[SATOKO] It would be foolish
to allow Rika to get her hands

00:12:42.679 --> 00:12:45.848
on a weapon as
dangerous as this.

00:12:56.317 --> 00:12:57.735
Silly Hanyuu.

00:12:57.777 --> 00:12:59.487
What happened to it?

00:13:00.697 --> 00:13:02.991
Where's the sword
you had promised me?

00:13:03.032 --> 00:13:05.243
That parting gift
I never asked you for.

00:13:05.285 --> 00:13:07.870
You offered it to me
and now it's not here!

00:13:07.912 --> 00:13:12.250
[laughing]

00:13:25.847 --> 00:13:26.764
[KEIICHI]
All right, Mion.

00:13:26.806 --> 00:13:28.224
We're following your gut.

00:13:28.266 --> 00:13:29.434
Think she's here at the shrine?

00:13:29.475 --> 00:13:31.769
[RENA] Well, the shrine
is where Rika lives.

00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:34.814
She probably knows all of the
best hiding spots around here.

00:13:34.856 --> 00:13:36.858
Yes, but it's also where I live,

00:13:36.899 --> 00:13:39.152
and I already checked
those hiding spots.

00:13:39.193 --> 00:13:41.946
[MION] If Rika's really trying
to keep us from finding her,

00:13:41.988 --> 00:13:43.948
she's at the shrine for sure.

00:13:57.128 --> 00:13:58.671
[KEIICHI]
Rika!

00:13:58.713 --> 00:13:59.881
[SATOKO]
Rika!

00:13:59.922 --> 00:14:02.342
If you can hear us,
please come out!

00:14:02.383 --> 00:14:03.551
[RENA]
You won, Rika!

00:14:03.593 --> 00:14:05.511
Now come talk to us, okay?

00:14:05.553 --> 00:14:07.388
[MION] You may have
beaten us this time,

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:10.308
but tomorrow's
another day, got it?

00:14:13.227 --> 00:14:16.189
With this shard,
I finally have a way out.

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:17.273
Rika!

00:14:17.315 --> 00:14:18.274
Hide wherever you want,

00:14:18.316 --> 00:14:21.027
but I'm always going
to find you in the end!

00:14:25.198 --> 00:14:26.908
[RIKA]
Five more loops.

00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:30.870
I'll try to set this world
right for five more loops.

00:14:30.912 --> 00:14:33.915
And then, I'll surrender.

00:14:33.956 --> 00:14:37.335
I'm certainly not going to
allow you to get away from me.

00:14:45.009 --> 00:14:45.927
Pardon me.

00:14:45.968 --> 00:14:47.887
Are you Mr. Akasaka?

00:14:47.929 --> 00:14:50.932
Yes. I'm Mamoru Akasaka.

00:14:50.973 --> 00:14:53.309
Weren't you at that
toy store in Okinomiya?

00:14:53.351 --> 00:14:54.936
I'm Satoko Hojo.

00:14:54.977 --> 00:14:57.647
I got the sense you
and Rika were acquainted.

00:14:57.688 --> 00:15:00.108
Although I'm not
sure how you two met.

00:15:00.149 --> 00:15:00.942
We are.

00:15:00.983 --> 00:15:02.985
I owe Rika my life.

00:15:03.027 --> 00:15:05.571
And so, whatever
she needs from me,

00:15:05.613 --> 00:15:07.115
I'll be there to help.

00:15:08.866 --> 00:15:11.327
[SATOKO] Then there's
something I need to tell you.

00:15:11.369 --> 00:15:14.956
About the real reason behind
what Rika's going through.

00:15:14.997 --> 00:15:16.374
[AKASAKA]
The real reason?

00:15:16.416 --> 00:15:18.876
[SATOKO] Yes, though most
people would scarcely believe me

00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:20.753
if I told them.

00:15:20.795 --> 00:15:22.338
The truth is...

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:23.965
Rika is sick.

00:15:24.006 --> 00:15:27.552
A parasitic infection
is controlling her.

00:15:27.593 --> 00:15:29.846
[AKASAKA] I'm sure
I'll be able to help her.

00:15:30.805 --> 00:15:33.224
[laughs]

00:15:33.266 --> 00:15:34.058
See?

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.185
It'll be okay now!

00:15:36.227 --> 00:15:38.146
The parasites were
inside of you too,

00:15:38.187 --> 00:15:39.897
but now I got 'em all out!

00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:42.942
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you, Rika!

00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:46.779
Of course not.

00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:49.866
[AKASAKA]
Dammit, this itching is torture!

00:15:49.907 --> 00:15:52.785
I know how to get
rid of these damn bugs!

00:15:56.747 --> 00:15:58.833
[AKASAKA] Itchy, itchy,
itchy, itchy, itchy!

00:15:58.875 --> 00:16:00.376
How do you like this?

00:16:00.418 --> 00:16:03.504
You think you can hide from
a fire, you little fuckers?

00:16:03.546 --> 00:16:08.759
[laughs]

00:16:08.801 --> 00:16:10.052
[SATOKO]
We're here, Rika!

00:16:10.094 --> 00:16:12.597
Please shout if you're okay!

00:16:12.638 --> 00:16:14.056
I swear we'll‐‐

00:16:14.765 --> 00:16:16.142
[KEIICHI]
Rika, no!

00:16:17.518 --> 00:16:18.686
Oh, please.

00:16:18.728 --> 00:16:20.771
Someone call
the fire department!

00:16:20.813 --> 00:16:23.024
Hurry!

00:16:23.065 --> 00:16:26.402
[SATOKO] Rika, I do hope
you'll catch on quickly.

00:16:26.444 --> 00:16:28.738
It's the curse
that makes you suffer.

00:16:32.325 --> 00:16:34.535
[SATOKO]
For Lord Oyashiro.

00:16:34.577 --> 00:16:36.412
has willed it.

00:16:48.216 --> 00:16:52.845
[AKANE] This is intolerable,
like bugs digging into my flesh!

00:16:52.887 --> 00:16:54.430
[moans]

00:16:54.472 --> 00:16:57.725
I can't stop itching.

00:16:57.767 --> 00:16:59.143
And I'm sure your tainted blood

00:16:59.185 --> 00:17:02.647
must be torturing
you just as much, dear.

00:17:04.357 --> 00:17:06.067
Even worse.

00:17:06.108 --> 00:17:07.944
Since you cut up
my shoulders so badly,

00:17:07.985 --> 00:17:10.738
I can't even lift my arms
to scratch my throat.

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:12.698
You genuinely didn't
deserve to be born

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:15.785
into such a cursed
family as the Furudes.

00:17:18.037 --> 00:17:19.872
If only we all could
choose our own fates,

00:17:19.914 --> 00:17:21.290
I would never have
had to be born

00:17:21.332 --> 00:17:23.209
in this hellmouth of a village!

00:17:23.251 --> 00:17:26.462
If only, but the curse of
Hinamizawa was upon us

00:17:26.504 --> 00:17:28.089
from our very first breaths,

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:30.132
and a hideous death
is our birthright.

00:17:30.174 --> 00:17:34.762
[AKANE] Indeed, all the
misery and pain and itching.

00:17:34.804 --> 00:17:36.806
You deserve better.

00:17:36.847 --> 00:17:39.475
I'm going to stop
the hurting now!

00:17:39.517 --> 00:17:41.852
Yes, you'd be
doing me a kindness.

00:17:41.894 --> 00:17:43.813
Please put an end to this.

00:17:43.854 --> 00:17:46.315
I'm ready to move on
to the next world.

00:17:46.357 --> 00:17:49.443
[AKANE] And once your
Hinamizawa blood is purged,

00:17:49.485 --> 00:17:51.404
I'll join you in that world.

00:17:51.445 --> 00:17:52.989
Now go!

00:17:56.409 --> 00:17:57.702
Who's this, now?

00:18:00.413 --> 00:18:02.498
[AKANE]
Little Satoko?

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:05.918
That's not right, is it?

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.295
You look just like her,

00:18:07.336 --> 00:18:10.298
and yet I couldn't be more sure
that you're somebody else.

00:18:10.339 --> 00:18:13.593
Have you seen to
my beloved Rika yet?

00:18:13.634 --> 00:18:16.137
I'm rather curious what
leads you to ask that.

00:18:16.178 --> 00:18:20.182
Could we simply say I'm
in urgent need of an answer?

00:18:20.224 --> 00:18:21.559
Oh.

00:18:23.352 --> 00:18:26.439
That spares us
a bit of conversation.

00:18:34.113 --> 00:18:37.908
So, a demon lived
among us, after all.

00:18:42.538 --> 00:18:45.458
Whoever told you I was a demon?

00:18:51.464 --> 00:18:53.049
Well, the blood
of a Furude woman

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:56.552
has always been just the thing
when Lord Oyashiro gets cranky,

00:18:56.594 --> 00:18:59.930
and lucky us, I happened to know
exactly where I can get one!

00:18:59.972 --> 00:19:01.432
Stop talking.

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:04.226
Yes, yes.

00:19:04.268 --> 00:19:05.519
Getting the chance to carry on

00:19:05.561 --> 00:19:07.563
your ancestors'
tradition like this,

00:19:07.605 --> 00:19:09.649
you must feel so proud.

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:11.651
[RIKA]
Please stop talking.

00:19:11.692 --> 00:19:15.112
If you ask me, we're
the only real family heads.

00:19:15.154 --> 00:19:17.323
Oryo's half senile by now

00:19:17.365 --> 00:19:19.784
and that Mion is
just about useless.

00:19:19.825 --> 00:19:22.828
Everyone's forgotten what
they all owe to this village!

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:25.206
Kids these days, I swear.

00:19:25.247 --> 00:19:28.125
[RIKA] I get it, so please,
drop me overboard

00:19:28.167 --> 00:19:30.169
and let me carry out my role.

00:19:30.211 --> 00:19:33.214
Oh! You're the only one
out of the other houses

00:19:33.255 --> 00:19:35.049
who understands how important‐‐

00:19:35.091 --> 00:19:36.050
[RIKA]
I'd just rather drown

00:19:36.092 --> 00:19:38.302
than choke on
your rancid breath.

00:19:38.344 --> 00:19:40.388
Don't you talk back
to your elders!

00:19:40.429 --> 00:19:41.472
Hear me?

00:19:41.514 --> 00:19:43.307
You rotten little girl!

00:20:01.534 --> 00:20:04.245
Lord Oyashiro,
please let this be enough!

00:20:04.286 --> 00:20:05.496
Show us mercy.

00:20:05.538 --> 00:20:06.831
Spare us your rage!

00:20:06.872 --> 00:20:08.958
We beg your forgiveness!

00:20:08.999 --> 00:20:10.584
[SATOKO]
I suspect she's gone.

00:20:10.626 --> 00:20:12.211
As impressive as Rika can be.

00:20:12.253 --> 00:20:13.629
I doubt she could
hold her breath

00:20:13.671 --> 00:20:16.465
for twice as long
as the world record.

00:20:23.973 --> 00:20:25.850
[laughs]

00:20:25.891 --> 00:20:28.769
It's really getting
fun now, isn't it, Rena?

00:20:28.811 --> 00:20:30.730
Why would you do this, Keiichi?

00:20:30.771 --> 00:20:33.023
We were all just hanging
out with our friends!

00:20:33.065 --> 00:20:36.152
[KEIICHI laughs] And we're all
having a great time together,

00:20:36.193 --> 00:20:37.570
aren't we?

00:20:37.611 --> 00:20:39.822
But hey, it's gonna
get even better

00:20:39.864 --> 00:20:43.617
once I bust that head
of yours wide open!

00:20:47.163 --> 00:20:49.623
It's happening again.

00:20:49.665 --> 00:20:51.125
[laughs]

00:20:51.167 --> 00:20:54.295
Kinda like being
in club, isn't it?

00:20:54.336 --> 00:20:57.214
You're not wrong. But...

00:20:57.256 --> 00:21:00.468
This isn't the kind
of world anyone wanted!

00:21:02.511 --> 00:21:04.972
It's just a bad dream, Keiichi!

00:21:05.014 --> 00:21:06.766
This isn't really you.

00:21:06.807 --> 00:21:08.517
So please wake‐‐

00:21:12.313 --> 00:21:13.689
It's always someone different,

00:21:13.731 --> 00:21:16.901
and there's no way to know
where or when it'll be.

00:21:16.942 --> 00:21:19.195
But it will happen.

00:21:21.614 --> 00:21:25.743
[EUA laughs]

00:21:25.785 --> 00:21:26.994
I could scarcely conceive of

00:21:27.036 --> 00:21:30.122
any finer storytellers
than you lot.

00:21:30.164 --> 00:21:33.667
May you never fail to satisfy,
O children of man.

00:21:33.709 --> 00:21:35.419
I shall continue to
look on with interest

00:21:35.461 --> 00:21:38.005
as you weave this
tale and the boredom

00:21:38.047 --> 00:21:40.966
that has plagued me
shall surely be kept at bay!

00:21:41.008 --> 00:21:46.722
[laughs]

00:21:50.184 --> 00:21:52.061
Oh, dear.

00:22:10.704 --> 00:22:12.998
My darling failure
has come to join me.

00:22:16.794 --> 00:22:19.505
