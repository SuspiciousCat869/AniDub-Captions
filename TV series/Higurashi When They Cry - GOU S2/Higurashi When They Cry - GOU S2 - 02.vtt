WEBVTT

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:16.433
Try harder.

00:00:20.145 --> 00:00:23.482
[RENA]
Do something. I have to.

00:00:27.486 --> 00:00:29.488
[RENA]
I have to try harder.

00:00:32.783 --> 00:00:35.911
I can't let this end
the way it did before.

00:00:35.953 --> 00:00:38.038
I have to try harder.

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:20.766
[RENA'S DAD groans]

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:22.726
My head's on fire.

00:02:22.768 --> 00:02:25.020
Good morning, Reina.

00:02:25.062 --> 00:02:26.688
[RENA]
Morning, Dad.

00:02:28.273 --> 00:02:29.858
[RENA]
Here, drink up.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:30.984
[RENA'S DAD]
Hmm?

00:02:31.026 --> 00:02:33.320
Hey. Thank you for that.

00:02:33.362 --> 00:02:34.821
[chuckles]

00:02:37.532 --> 00:02:39.159
[RENA'S DAD groans]

00:02:39.201 --> 00:02:40.827
Oh, by the way,

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:42.204
what's all the
stuff you picked up

00:02:42.245 --> 00:02:43.413
from the hardware store?

00:02:43.455 --> 00:02:44.331
Huh?

00:02:44.373 --> 00:02:46.416
Sorry, I just happened
to notice the bag

00:02:46.458 --> 00:02:48.543
sitting on the
floor in your room.

00:02:48.585 --> 00:02:51.213
Did you go all the way out
to Okinomiya for that?

00:02:51.254 --> 00:02:54.132
[RENA]
Uh, yeah, I was digging

00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:55.759
around the old
dam construction dump,

00:02:55.801 --> 00:02:58.011
and I found this
really cute statue.

00:02:58.053 --> 00:02:59.888
But it's too big
to carry on my own,

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.516
so I went and bought some things
to help me bring it back!

00:03:02.557 --> 00:03:04.476
That so?

00:03:04.518 --> 00:03:08.105
I guess we'll be adding a new
piece to the garden display.

00:03:08.146 --> 00:03:09.606
Be careful, all right?

00:03:09.648 --> 00:03:12.859
Right. You don't need
to worry about me, Dad.

00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:31.920
No one will look here.

00:03:36.133 --> 00:03:38.802
[KEIICHI] Why the heck
is Rena taking so long?

00:03:38.844 --> 00:03:42.597
[RENA]
Keiichi! Good morning!

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:43.890
Jeez, finally.

00:03:43.932 --> 00:03:44.933
What was your hold‐up?

00:03:44.975 --> 00:03:46.101
Sorry about that!

00:03:46.143 --> 00:03:46.935
Did you wait long?

00:03:46.977 --> 00:03:47.769
Did you?

00:03:47.811 --> 00:03:49.896
Yeah, I was waiting
here way too long.

00:03:49.938 --> 00:03:52.524
A few more seconds,
and I was gonna ditch you.

00:03:52.566 --> 00:03:53.483
Awoo...

00:03:53.525 --> 00:03:55.485
The other day, you promised
you would never leave me,

00:03:55.527 --> 00:03:57.320
no matter how late I got here!

00:03:57.362 --> 00:04:00.407
And I also said I'd totally
ditch you if you showed up late.

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:01.324
[RENA]
Aww...

00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:04.119
You're so mean to me, Keiichi!

00:04:05.036 --> 00:04:05.829
[KEIICHI]
You know.

00:04:05.871 --> 00:04:08.206
I get that I said you should
sleep in now and then,

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:10.917
but I wasn't really expecting
you to go and do it.

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.378
Yeah, same here, that doesn't
seem like you at all.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.006
And to sleep in on a
school morning, no less.

00:04:16.047 --> 00:04:17.758
How unbecoming.

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.801
If you sleep all sprawly
with your belly out,

00:04:19.843 --> 00:04:22.304
it's gonna give you a
big tummy‐ache later!

00:04:22.345 --> 00:04:24.139
Guys, you've got it wrong!

00:04:24.181 --> 00:04:26.975
I just had a few things to
take care of before school.

00:04:27.017 --> 00:04:28.560
A few things like what?

00:04:28.602 --> 00:04:29.561
Uh...

00:04:29.603 --> 00:04:32.147
Whatever it is,
we can help if you want!

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:34.191
Thank you, but, no.

00:04:34.232 --> 00:04:38.111
This is something I'm going
to have to deal with by myself.

00:04:38.153 --> 00:04:39.362
All right.

00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:41.740
If you say you can handle it,
then I won't worry.

00:04:41.782 --> 00:04:43.992
Yeah, Rena!
You can do this!

00:04:44.034 --> 00:04:45.952
Right! Thanks, guys!

00:04:45.994 --> 00:04:49.623
Oh, yeah. Sorry, but I won't be
able to make it to club today.

00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:51.625
Does that mean
you have to punish me?

00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:53.502
Nah. It'll be okay.

00:04:53.543 --> 00:04:55.962
Sounds like you've
got a lot on your plate.

00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:59.424
Plus, the forecast said we might
be getting a bunch of rain.

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:01.676
Let's call it off
for the rest of the day.

00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:04.262
It's no fun without
everyone here anyway.

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:06.056
I'm really sorry!

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.072
[RINA]
Hello there.

00:06:05.615 --> 00:06:07.784
Sorry to show up unannounced.

00:06:07.826 --> 00:06:10.036
Hope I didn't startle you.

00:06:10.078 --> 00:06:12.414
Your name's Reina, isn't it?

00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:13.748
Where do I start?

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.710
I'm already making
this super awkward.

00:06:16.751 --> 00:06:18.461
So, um, I guess you can say

00:06:18.503 --> 00:06:21.381
I'm friends with your dad.

00:06:21.423 --> 00:06:22.257
Oh, right!

00:06:22.299 --> 00:06:25.552
I need to introduce
myself first, Sorry.

00:06:25.594 --> 00:06:27.387
No, I know who you are.

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:29.723
It's Rina Mamiya, isn't it?

00:06:29.764 --> 00:06:31.266
Wow! How'd you know?

00:06:31.308 --> 00:06:33.143
Oh. Dad likes you a lot;

00:06:33.184 --> 00:06:34.811
he's always talking about you.

00:06:34.853 --> 00:06:36.229
[laughs]

00:06:36.271 --> 00:06:39.107
It's nice to hear that,
'cause your dad's a great guy.

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:41.943
[chuckles] Thanks,
that's nice of you, though

00:06:41.985 --> 00:06:45.113
I'm still not sure why you
needed to see him at our house.

00:06:45.155 --> 00:06:47.157
Well, he talks about you, too.

00:06:47.198 --> 00:06:49.743
That's why I kind
of invited myself here.

00:06:49.784 --> 00:06:52.329
So, I could meet this daughter
I've heard so much about,

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:53.163
you know?

00:06:53.204 --> 00:06:55.582
You came all the
way out here to meet me?

00:06:55.624 --> 00:06:57.125
I'm so glad!

00:06:57.167 --> 00:06:59.169
I've actually been hoping
to meet you for a while,

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:00.670
so this is perfect!

00:07:00.712 --> 00:07:03.423
[laughs]
You're happy to see me!

00:07:03.465 --> 00:07:05.675
Seriously, that's
such a huge relief.

00:07:05.717 --> 00:07:07.844
I hope you and
I can become friends.

00:07:07.886 --> 00:07:08.970
Now that you're here.

00:07:09.012 --> 00:07:10.680
I could really use your help.

00:07:10.722 --> 00:07:13.266
Would you mind coming along
on a treasure hunt with me?

00:07:13.308 --> 00:07:15.226
A treasure hunt?

00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:16.853
Yeah! That could be fun!

00:07:16.895 --> 00:07:19.522
Great! We'll have
to walk for a while.

00:07:19.564 --> 00:07:20.815
Is it far?

00:07:20.857 --> 00:07:23.485
Let's hope we
don't get rained on.

00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:24.611
The skies look bad,

00:07:24.653 --> 00:07:27.072
but the forecast said
it wouldn't rain today.

00:07:27.113 --> 00:07:29.115
Is that right? Great!

00:07:29.157 --> 00:07:31.534
This is a perfect chance
to get to know each other.

00:07:31.576 --> 00:07:32.702
I'd love to come.

00:07:32.744 --> 00:07:34.454
Yay!

00:07:34.496 --> 00:07:36.581
Just wait for me a second, okay?

00:07:36.623 --> 00:07:38.625
I need to grab a few things!

00:07:42.003 --> 00:07:43.880
All right, I'm ready!

00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:48.677
[thunder booms]

00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:51.221
What's that?

00:07:51.262 --> 00:07:54.140
It's something to help us
dig up our treasure.

00:07:54.182 --> 00:07:56.101
[RINA] Wow, that's
some serious hardware.

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:57.894
[laughs]

00:07:57.936 --> 00:08:00.105
Okay, Rina, let's go.

00:08:05.735 --> 00:08:07.445
[RINA]
Wow, you're good at this.

00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:09.406
So, Reina, it seems
like you must spend

00:08:09.447 --> 00:08:10.949
a lot of time out here.

00:08:10.991 --> 00:08:12.617
Do you bring your friends?

00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:15.078
I'm usually by myself
when I'm here.

00:08:17.414 --> 00:08:19.958
Not your typical teenager,
are you?

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.669
I never knew they stuffed
this much garbage

00:08:22.711 --> 00:08:24.504
into this tiny village.

00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:26.131
So, what're we looking for?

00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:28.091
You still haven't told me.

00:08:29.467 --> 00:08:31.720
Hey, you're still
listening, aren't you?

00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:33.346
Ahh, sorry about that!

00:08:33.388 --> 00:08:34.222
The wind must have picked up

00:08:34.264 --> 00:08:36.099
and drowned you
out for a second.

00:08:36.141 --> 00:08:37.600
[laughs]

00:08:37.642 --> 00:08:40.437
Uh... Sure, got it.

00:08:42.397 --> 00:08:43.940
[RENA]
This is my secret hideout.

00:08:43.982 --> 00:08:46.609
Promise you won't tell
anyone about it, okay?

00:08:46.651 --> 00:08:48.486
Aw!

00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:49.821
This is adorable.

00:08:49.863 --> 00:08:51.322
Cute little hideaway!

00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:54.117
[laughs]
And it's all mine!

00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:56.077
Nobody else
really comes out here,

00:08:56.119 --> 00:08:58.079
and it's too far
for any sounds to carry.

00:08:58.121 --> 00:09:00.165
[laughs]

00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:01.624
I'm truly honored
that you were willing

00:09:01.666 --> 00:09:04.252
to share such a
special place with me, Reina.

00:09:04.294 --> 00:09:06.046
[laughs]

00:09:06.087 --> 00:09:09.799
Okay, so now that we're here,
tell me about this treasure!

00:09:09.841 --> 00:09:10.717
First thing is,

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:13.553
I need to grab a few of the
tools I have stored out here.

00:09:13.595 --> 00:09:15.764
Wait one second.

00:09:15.805 --> 00:09:16.639
[RINA]
Gosh.

00:09:16.681 --> 00:09:18.683
You've been preparing for this.

00:09:18.725 --> 00:09:20.769
Do you mind if I come inside?

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:23.980
Sorry, I prefer
if you stay out there.

00:09:32.155 --> 00:09:34.407
[RINA]
Ah! This is so cool!

00:09:34.449 --> 00:09:36.993
You really made a whole
little secret base out here,

00:09:37.035 --> 00:09:38.119
didn't you?

00:09:38.161 --> 00:09:40.038
You even got some cushions!

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.248
You could totally
come camp here!

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:44.918
I asked you to wait
outside, didn't I?

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:45.919
I'm really sorry!

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.837
It just started pouring.

00:09:47.879 --> 00:09:51.257
Those forecasts are
so useless, am I right?

00:09:51.299 --> 00:09:52.550
Ooh!

00:09:55.178 --> 00:09:57.055
Does this lamp turn on?

00:09:57.097 --> 00:09:58.014
[RENA]
It works.

00:09:58.056 --> 00:09:59.349
They never shut off
the electricity

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:02.727
to the dam construction site,
so it's still active.

00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:04.187
Really?

00:10:09.192 --> 00:10:11.236
I've got something to say.

00:10:11.277 --> 00:10:14.072
I'm sorry that it took me
so long to get to it.

00:10:14.114 --> 00:10:15.365
Get to what?

00:10:15.406 --> 00:10:18.827
Telling you, the truth
about your dad and me.

00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:21.246
You know how I said
that he and I were friends?

00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:23.123
Well, actually,
he's one of the customers

00:10:23.164 --> 00:10:25.208
who pays for
my company at the club.

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:26.793
You're a hostess.

00:10:26.835 --> 00:10:27.710
I could tell.

00:10:27.752 --> 00:10:32.340
Dad comes home reeking of booze
every time he goes to see you.

00:10:32.382 --> 00:10:33.716
Good point.

00:10:33.758 --> 00:10:35.301
Of course, you'd know.

00:10:35.343 --> 00:10:38.096
You're his daughter,
and you live together.

00:10:38.138 --> 00:10:40.431
I'm from a
single‐parent household,

00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:44.227
so I understand how hard
growing up like that can be.

00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:46.646
I know this isn't
your responsibility.

00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:51.568
[RINA] But I feel awful whenever
he shows up at the club.

00:10:51.609 --> 00:10:54.404
So, I was hoping you'd try
and talk some sense into him.

00:10:54.445 --> 00:10:55.864
Do you think you could
say something next time

00:10:55.905 --> 00:10:57.657
and get him to stay home?

00:11:00.285 --> 00:11:01.327
[RINA chuckles]

00:11:01.369 --> 00:11:04.330
I guess, it's pretty crappy
of me to ask you for anything,

00:11:04.372 --> 00:11:06.916
but I promise, I'll keep
my distance from now on.

00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.543
I won't call him anymore.

00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:10.086
Can you help me out?

00:11:10.128 --> 00:11:12.088
I'm sure it's
what you want, too.

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:13.840
Is that cool?

00:11:13.882 --> 00:11:16.843
[RENA] I understand
you completely, Rina.

00:11:16.885 --> 00:11:19.304
Ahhh... Thank you.

00:11:20.638 --> 00:11:21.764
Heh.

00:11:21.806 --> 00:11:24.309
You've got a pretty
strong grip, Reina.

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:26.728
[laughs]

00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:28.521
Reina. Let go.

00:11:28.563 --> 00:11:30.982
Please, you're
really hurting me!

00:11:31.024 --> 00:11:34.485
[RENA] You tricked my dad,
but I won't let you trick me!

00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:35.987
[RINA]
I'm not!

00:11:36.696 --> 00:11:38.781
[laughs maniacally]

00:11:38.823 --> 00:11:40.742
This time.
I'm doing what's right!

00:11:40.783 --> 00:11:44.245
I'm gonna do whatever I have
to so we can all be happy!

00:11:44.287 --> 00:11:47.248
I've had to work so hard
for everything I have in life.

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:49.959
There's nothing I can do
but keep trying harder!

00:11:50.001 --> 00:11:51.836
[grunts, gags]

00:11:51.878 --> 00:11:57.550
[RENA laughs maniacally]

00:12:03.598 --> 00:12:06.309
[coughs]

00:12:10.647 --> 00:12:16.736
[shudders]

00:12:22.283 --> 00:12:23.493
[RINA]
No!

00:12:40.343 --> 00:12:41.552
Help me!

00:12:41.594 --> 00:12:43.263
Please, someone help!

00:13:05.702 --> 00:13:08.871
Don't do this. I'm sorry!

00:13:08.913 --> 00:13:11.332
Please! I'm so sorry!

00:13:11.374 --> 00:13:13.751
Don't kill me. Don't kill me.

00:13:13.793 --> 00:13:16.170
Please don't kill me.
Please don't kill me!

00:13:16.212 --> 00:13:18.089
Please! Please don't kill me.

00:13:18.131 --> 00:13:19.340
I'm begging you.

00:13:19.382 --> 00:13:21.592
Please don't kill me!

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:22.802
[thud]

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:09.974
[SATOKO]
Rena. There is a world

00:14:10.016 --> 00:14:12.727
where you convince
Rika not to leave the village,

00:14:12.769 --> 00:14:14.937
and in that world,
I promise you,

00:14:14.979 --> 00:14:18.358
you'll get the happiness
you've worked so hard for.

00:14:22.278 --> 00:14:29.327
[RENA pants]

00:14:29.369 --> 00:14:30.912
Next step.

00:14:35.541 --> 00:14:37.418
[RENA]
See, Dad?

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:39.796
I put in the effort
and saw it through.

00:14:39.837 --> 00:14:43.174
I won't let the bad
people hurt my family!

00:14:53.393 --> 00:14:55.478
Gotta hide you.

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:58.147
Can't let anyone dig you up.

00:15:07.448 --> 00:15:08.366
All right!

00:15:08.408 --> 00:15:10.451
School has finally
let out for the day!

00:15:10.493 --> 00:15:12.829
I move to commence
our game club meeting!

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:14.330
Any objections?

00:15:14.372 --> 00:15:15.581
No.

00:15:15.623 --> 00:15:17.959
Then it's unanimous!
Wait. Rena?

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:18.960
Sorry, everyone,

00:15:19.001 --> 00:15:21.129
but I still have some
more stuff I need to do.

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:23.047
Aw, again?

00:15:23.089 --> 00:15:25.341
[RENA]
Aw... Unfortunately.

00:15:25.383 --> 00:15:27.176
You head out early
for work all the time,

00:15:27.218 --> 00:15:29.011
so it's fine, right, Mion?

00:15:29.053 --> 00:15:30.138
[laughs]

00:15:30.179 --> 00:15:32.348
Yeah, my uncle asks me
for help sometimes,

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:34.308
and I just can't turn him down.

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:37.103
I'm gonna have to try
my absolute hardest,

00:15:37.145 --> 00:15:37.979
but when I'm done,

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:40.523
everything can go back
to how it's supposed to be!

00:15:40.565 --> 00:15:41.732
Then we'll be here.

00:15:41.774 --> 00:15:43.359
Still not sure what it
is you're doing,

00:15:43.401 --> 00:15:45.111
but whatever it is,
your old Uncle Mion

00:15:45.153 --> 00:15:47.655
and all your friends are
pullin' for ya all the way!

00:15:47.697 --> 00:15:48.531
Thanks.

00:15:48.573 --> 00:15:50.700
I'll see you
tomorrow, everybody!

00:15:53.077 --> 00:15:56.164
I think I have an idea
what Rena's been up to.

00:15:56.205 --> 00:15:58.708
Did you really manage to figure
something out from that?

00:15:58.749 --> 00:16:00.042
Yeah.

00:16:09.802 --> 00:16:12.472
That's good. She's still here.

00:16:13.264 --> 00:16:16.350
[KEIICHI]
Hey! Rena! Workin' up a sweat?

00:16:19.562 --> 00:16:21.522
[RENA]
Oh? Ah. Keiichi?

00:16:21.564 --> 00:16:22.982
Why are you here?

00:16:23.024 --> 00:16:24.442
I received word of an emergency

00:16:24.484 --> 00:16:26.110
and came as soon as I could!

00:16:26.152 --> 00:16:27.904
Now take me to
the man who was trapped!

00:16:27.945 --> 00:16:28.988
[RENA]
Huh? Wait.

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:30.114
Someone was trapped?

00:16:30.156 --> 00:16:30.990
Where?

00:16:31.032 --> 00:16:33.117
[KEIICHI] Yes. Reports
described a Kenta‐<i>kun</i> statue

00:16:33.159 --> 00:16:35.119
buried deep inside
this garbage heap.

00:16:35.161 --> 00:16:37.497
Huh? Aw, come on.

00:16:37.538 --> 00:16:39.373
You had me thinking
you were serious!

00:16:39.415 --> 00:16:41.250
[KEIICHI chcukles]
I'm just goofin' around.

00:16:41.292 --> 00:16:42.752
I promised I'd help, remember?

00:16:42.793 --> 00:16:46.589
Huh? You came for me? Awoo!

00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:51.761
[KEIICHI]
So, where is that Kenta‐<i>kun</i> at?

00:16:51.802 --> 00:16:55.806
Uh... This way!

00:16:55.848 --> 00:16:57.099
[KEIICHI]
It's down there?

00:16:57.141 --> 00:16:59.018
Yeah. Keep going.

00:17:09.153 --> 00:17:11.072
[KEIICHI pants]

00:17:11.113 --> 00:17:13.366
Man, an axe or a saw
would be a big help.

00:17:13.407 --> 00:17:15.535
We don't need
to do it right now!

00:17:15.576 --> 00:17:16.786
[KEIICHI]
Don't worry! It's fine.

00:17:16.827 --> 00:17:18.371
I wanna do this.

00:17:22.124 --> 00:17:23.209
[exhales]

00:17:23.251 --> 00:17:25.920
But I could use a break first.

00:17:25.962 --> 00:17:27.713
Uh. Hold on,
I'll run home real quick

00:17:27.755 --> 00:17:29.298
and grab some cold barley tea!

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:31.092
My house is super close by!

00:17:35.471 --> 00:17:37.598
Keiichi's seen everything.

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:40.059
He knows what I've done.

00:17:40.101 --> 00:17:41.352
He came because he could tell,

00:17:41.394 --> 00:17:43.187
and now he's seen everything.

00:17:43.229 --> 00:17:45.481
Keiichi knows what I did!

00:17:45.523 --> 00:17:48.526
What do I do,
what do I do, what do I do?

00:17:48.568 --> 00:17:50.069
Oh.

00:17:50.111 --> 00:17:51.279
That's right.

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.823
I just have to keep
trying harder.

00:18:13.634 --> 00:18:14.760
Hinamizawa.

00:18:14.802 --> 00:18:16.554
Dam construction site.

00:18:16.596 --> 00:18:20.891
Worker lynched,
murdered, and dismembered?

00:18:20.933 --> 00:18:23.686
Then what he said, it's true!

00:18:26.314 --> 00:18:28.149
[KEIICHI] Armed with
hatchets and pickaxes,

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:31.235
the assailants brutally
attacked and murdered the victim

00:18:31.277 --> 00:18:34.655
before using an axe
to sever his head and limbs.

00:18:34.989 --> 00:18:36.616
Huh?

00:18:36.657 --> 00:18:38.784
[screams]

00:18:39.952 --> 00:18:42.413
[shrieks]

00:18:45.166 --> 00:18:46.000
Oh gosh!

00:18:46.042 --> 00:18:46.876
Did I startle you?

00:18:46.917 --> 00:18:48.210
Were you startled?

00:18:48.252 --> 00:18:49.795
No, I'm fine.

00:18:49.837 --> 00:18:51.672
[RENA]
Uh. Remember yesterday?

00:18:51.714 --> 00:18:53.049
You said it would be
easier to get him out

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:55.176
if you had a saw or an axe.

00:18:55.217 --> 00:18:56.302
So, I brought something with me

00:18:56.344 --> 00:18:58.262
from my house today
that might help!

00:18:58.304 --> 00:19:00.723
[KEIICHI]
Ah. Perfect. My bad.

00:19:00.765 --> 00:19:03.434
I guess I overreacted
a little bit there.

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:08.189
[RENA]
Jeez. I'm sorry for scaring you.

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:09.273
Sorry!

00:19:09.315 --> 00:19:11.317
This will definitely
be a big help,

00:19:11.359 --> 00:19:12.860
but it's getting dark.

00:19:12.902 --> 00:19:14.445
Let's call it for right now.

00:19:14.487 --> 00:19:15.738
Yeah.

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:17.281
Don't worry, it'll be fine!

00:19:17.323 --> 00:19:19.033
We can come back tomorrow!

00:19:19.075 --> 00:19:20.034
[RENA]
Hmm?

00:19:20.076 --> 00:19:21.911
You're still willing to help me?

00:19:21.952 --> 00:19:23.037
[KEIICHI]
Of course!

00:19:23.079 --> 00:19:26.749
Ah! Thank you, Keiichi!

00:19:26.791 --> 00:19:28.209
Just wait Kenta‐<i>kun</i>.

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:30.711
I'm gonna bring
you home with me!

00:19:30.753 --> 00:19:34.590
[laughs]

00:19:39.512 --> 00:19:42.431
Ah. Oh, Rena, is that you?

00:19:42.473 --> 00:19:44.100
Oh, you're Keiichi's mom!

00:19:44.141 --> 00:19:45.685
It's good to see you!

00:19:45.726 --> 00:19:47.978
Getting ready to
make dinner, I assume?

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:50.314
Plus, some extra for
my lunch tomorrow.

00:19:50.356 --> 00:19:53.234
Awww... You're such
a good kid, Rena!

00:19:53.275 --> 00:19:56.153
Keiichi would burn the house
down if he tried to cook.

00:19:56.195 --> 00:19:57.780
It'd be great to have
someone to fill in for me

00:19:57.822 --> 00:19:59.657
whenever I have to work late.

00:19:59.699 --> 00:20:01.325
Could you help me with that?

00:20:01.367 --> 00:20:04.286
Awoo! I would love to, ma'am!

00:20:13.129 --> 00:20:14.171
Beg your pardon, miss,

00:20:14.213 --> 00:20:16.173
but I've got a few questions
for a young lady

00:20:16.215 --> 00:20:19.969
by the name of Reina Ryugu,
and I believe that's you.

00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:21.595
Yes, that's me.

00:20:21.637 --> 00:20:23.097
May I please ask your name?

00:20:23.139 --> 00:20:24.181
[OOISHI]
You certainly may,

00:20:24.223 --> 00:20:26.559
but I'd rather have this
conversation in the car.

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.103
The air out there's been
a little stuffy for me today,

00:20:29.186 --> 00:20:30.521
ya know?

00:20:31.063 --> 00:20:32.523
I like it better in here.

00:20:32.565 --> 00:20:35.276
The AC keeps it nice and chilly.

00:20:37.153 --> 00:20:39.405
You let me know if it's
too cold back there.

00:20:39.447 --> 00:20:42.616
I tend to keep it blowing
harder than most folks.

00:20:42.658 --> 00:20:45.035
What were these
questions you had for me?

00:20:45.077 --> 00:20:47.079
[OOISHI]
Are you familiar this woman?

00:20:48.289 --> 00:20:49.540
I've met her.

00:20:49.582 --> 00:20:51.208
That's Rina Mamiya.

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:53.836
Right, that's the
name she uses for work.

00:20:53.878 --> 00:20:57.381
She's Rina to her clients,
but her legal name is Ritsuko.

00:20:57.423 --> 00:20:59.633
[RENA]
And did something happen to her?

00:20:59.675 --> 00:21:02.762
We hope not, but she hasn't
been seen since yesterday.

00:21:02.803 --> 00:21:03.888
She's missing?

00:21:03.929 --> 00:21:06.557
[OOISHI] You sound a
bit concerned to hear that.

00:21:06.599 --> 00:21:07.600
I saw her.

00:21:07.641 --> 00:21:09.560
She came by the house yesterday.

00:21:09.602 --> 00:21:12.396
Yeah, I had a feeling she had.

00:21:12.438 --> 00:21:14.315
Some of her coworkers
told me she'd mentioned

00:21:14.356 --> 00:21:16.484
she was taking a
trip out to Hinamizawa

00:21:16.525 --> 00:21:20.029
to meet the teenage daughter
of one of her customers.

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:22.990
So now I'm here trying
to retrace her steps.

00:21:23.032 --> 00:21:25.242
She showed up,
and we talked a while.

00:21:25.284 --> 00:21:26.410
That's all.

00:21:26.452 --> 00:21:29.330
She didn't mention
where she was going so...

00:21:29.371 --> 00:21:30.456
[OOISHI]
I see.

00:21:30.498 --> 00:21:33.542
And would you mind telling me
what you two talked about?

00:21:33.584 --> 00:21:36.712
She told me that she was
raised by a single parent, too

00:21:36.754 --> 00:21:39.840
and hoped we could be friends,
and that's really it.

00:21:39.882 --> 00:21:41.467
So that's all, huh?

00:21:41.509 --> 00:21:43.844
Well, if anything
comes back to you,

00:21:43.886 --> 00:21:47.515
call the Okinomiya Police
Department and ask for Oishi.

00:21:47.556 --> 00:21:49.433
[RENA]
I will.

00:21:50.893 --> 00:21:54.104
Hey, it's almost time
for Watanagashi, isn't it?

00:21:54.146 --> 00:21:57.733
Hopefully the villagers can
finally catch a break this year.

00:21:57.775 --> 00:21:58.567
Huh?

00:21:58.609 --> 00:22:02.154
From the curse of
Lord Oyashiro, obviously.

00:22:05.491 --> 00:22:07.451
Now, you have a good night.

00:23:53.182 --> 00:23:56.560
[RIKA] Next time:
<i>Oniakashi‐hen</i>, Part Three.
