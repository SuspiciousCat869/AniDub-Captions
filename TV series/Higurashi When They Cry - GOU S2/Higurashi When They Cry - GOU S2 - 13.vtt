WEBVTT

00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:17.893
At long last, I've found you!

00:00:17.935 --> 00:00:18.852
I must admit,

00:00:18.894 --> 00:00:20.521
it's impressive that
you were able to seek out

00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:23.398
my wavelength amid
the sea of fragments.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.319
[chuckles]

00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:29.905
You can hardly imagine
how disappointed I was

00:00:29.947 --> 00:00:33.408
to learn that Vier's memories
had somehow been lost to her.

00:00:36.828 --> 00:00:38.664
[gasps]

00:00:39.957 --> 00:00:41.542
What do you mean to do?

00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:43.001
Isn't that obvious?

00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:45.837
Each of us has our piece out
on the field of play.

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.006
'Tis only natural that
we should watch with delight

00:00:48.048 --> 00:00:51.051
as they tear each other apart
in the course of the game.

00:00:53.345 --> 00:00:55.055
[gasps]

00:00:58.642 --> 00:01:00.143
[gasps]

00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:04.773
Rika!

00:01:07.192 --> 00:01:10.654
[EUA chuckles]
What a delectable reaction.

00:01:10.696 --> 00:01:12.489
If there were no players,
needless to say,

00:01:12.531 --> 00:01:15.033
there could hardly be a game.

00:02:50.462 --> 00:02:52.255
[thudding]

00:02:56.093 --> 00:02:59.930
[pants]

00:03:00.597 --> 00:03:02.349
It's not fair.

00:03:02.391 --> 00:03:05.060
Why do I have to go
through this alone?

00:03:05.102 --> 00:03:08.021
Watching my friends
die again and again.

00:03:10.273 --> 00:03:12.734
[RIKA]
What horrible sin did I commit?

00:03:12.776 --> 00:03:14.569
What was my crime?

00:03:14.611 --> 00:03:18.407
What have I done to deserve
eternity in this hell?

00:03:18.448 --> 00:03:20.200
[KEIICHI]
It's just us now, Rika.

00:03:20.242 --> 00:03:22.828
Hurry up and tell me
how I get rid of them.

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:24.830
These parasites inside my body.

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:26.373
How do I kill them all?

00:03:26.415 --> 00:03:28.500
I know you know more about
them than you're letting on,

00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:31.837
so tell me how to get rid of
these filthy maggots already!

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:37.509
[laughs]

00:03:37.551 --> 00:03:41.304
I know what you need,
and it's right in front of you.

00:03:41.346 --> 00:03:43.515
[KEIICHI] Don't make it a game,
just tell me!

00:03:43.557 --> 00:03:45.142
Right now, dammit!

00:03:45.183 --> 00:03:46.893
I can feel the things
crawling down my throat,

00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:48.353
I'm almost choking on 'em!

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:52.107
And this itching is
going to drive me insane!

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:57.696
It's in here.

00:03:57.738 --> 00:03:58.530
Huh?

00:03:58.572 --> 00:04:00.782
What you're looking
for is in my head.

00:04:00.824 --> 00:04:02.659
All you have to do
is crack open my skull

00:04:02.701 --> 00:04:03.827
and eat my brains,

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:05.662
and the itching will stop.

00:04:05.704 --> 00:04:07.998
[laughs]

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:10.709
I found it!

00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:14.337
I finally found the cure!

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.090
Rika?

00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:29.853
I hope you saw that,
you damn bugs!

00:04:29.895 --> 00:04:31.688
Now I'll get
rid of you for good‐‐

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.317
Why is it so freakin' itchy?

00:04:35.358 --> 00:04:42.073
This'll work. Wait, no.

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:43.700
This'll be easier.

00:04:50.582 --> 00:04:53.043
[glass breaking]

00:04:56.213 --> 00:04:57.589
[SOLDIER A]
Get him! Restrain him!

00:04:57.631 --> 00:04:59.257
Get outta my way!

00:05:00.717 --> 00:05:01.760
Just leave me alone

00:05:01.802 --> 00:05:04.679
and let me get these
damn bugs out of my body!

00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:08.308
I can... I can
feel them crawling!

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.602
They just keep
coming and coming!

00:05:10.644 --> 00:05:15.857
[screams]

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:19.277
[HANYUU] What is this?
What happened to this world?

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:22.197
What is this suffering you've
placed upon these people?

00:05:22.239 --> 00:05:24.741
[chuckles]
If it pleases you not,

00:05:24.783 --> 00:05:25.826
then allow me to assure you

00:05:25.867 --> 00:05:29.371
that what you have seen
thus far was only a prelude.

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.252
[KEIICHI]
Let go of me!

00:05:38.588 --> 00:05:40.423
What is Satoko...?

00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:45.220
Oh.

00:05:45.262 --> 00:05:48.306
Get your hands
off me, you bastards!

00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:51.101
They're back, I can
feel them crawling out!

00:05:51.142 --> 00:05:52.602
[SOLDIER C]
Don't resist!

00:05:53.395 --> 00:05:56.731
It would appear things have
gotten rather lively in here.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.156
Poor, lonesome little Rika.

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:06.408
That frail heart of yours

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:09.536
has nobody to hold it
together anymore,

00:06:09.578 --> 00:06:12.539
in any world, in any fragment.

00:06:12.581 --> 00:06:15.000
You have no one left but me.

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:15.876
[HANYUU gasps]

00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:18.211
It can't be.

00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:21.590
Rika, the best thing
to do is give up.

00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:23.174
You'll find happiness.

00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:27.178
But understand
you'll only find it with me.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.722
I'm going to make
you understand that,

00:06:28.763 --> 00:06:30.849
by any means necessary!

00:06:36.855 --> 00:06:38.773
What madness is this?

00:06:40.442 --> 00:06:42.819
You granted
your power to Satoko?

00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:45.947
Indeed, much as you once
granted your power to Rika.

00:06:45.989 --> 00:06:46.907
[HANYUU]
I did.

00:06:46.948 --> 00:06:48.909
It was a grave
error in judgment,

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:52.370
and now, I've borne witness
to your own mistake!

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:57.709
Oh? Then you believe I act now
out of an error in judgment?

00:06:57.751 --> 00:07:01.713
I would not speak
so freely, my dear failure.

00:07:01.755 --> 00:07:03.256
I am not powerless yet!

00:07:03.298 --> 00:07:05.175
There is still
more that I can do!

00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:15.936
[EUA]
Long ago, you were able

00:07:15.977 --> 00:07:19.064
to divert one of Takano's
bullets from its destined course

00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:21.066
and protect the
lives of your friends.

00:07:21.107 --> 00:07:22.609
Surely you knew
better than to expect

00:07:22.651 --> 00:07:26.279
another such opportunity
to arise by chance.

00:07:26.321 --> 00:07:27.906
[HANYUU] The power that
allowed me to save them

00:07:27.948 --> 00:07:29.658
was more than random chance.

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:31.785
It's beyond your understanding!

00:07:31.826 --> 00:07:32.911
[EUA]
Hmph.

00:07:32.953 --> 00:07:34.996
Yet still, such insolence.

00:07:37.624 --> 00:07:38.458
[gasps]

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.461
[EUA] Though it pains me
to admit, you are a part of me.

00:07:41.503 --> 00:07:43.797
And so, I will grant
you a front‐row seat

00:07:43.838 --> 00:07:45.632
to the spectacle.

00:08:02.357 --> 00:08:05.318
Ahh, you're finally
awake, I see.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.904
You nearly slept straight
through the sunset.

00:08:07.946 --> 00:08:10.281
What's going on?

00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:11.616
Satoko.

00:08:11.658 --> 00:08:14.202
You looked so
restless as you slept.

00:08:14.244 --> 00:08:19.958
I can hardly imagine the
nightmares you were having.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.002
And your fever is awful.

00:08:22.043 --> 00:08:23.920
Please, let me take care of you.

00:08:23.962 --> 00:08:25.672
I'll stay here by your side.

00:08:25.714 --> 00:08:28.675
I won't leave
till you're well again.

00:08:28.717 --> 00:08:30.552
Satoko.

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:36.975
Poor, suffering girl.

00:08:37.017 --> 00:08:40.103
Please, someone,
help me understand it.

00:08:40.145 --> 00:08:41.604
Why is this happening?

00:08:41.646 --> 00:08:43.106
What did I do?

00:08:45.859 --> 00:08:50.238
[SATOKO] I can't know
what you saw in your dreams.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:53.283
But whatever it was,
you know it meant something.

00:08:55.118 --> 00:08:56.286
Huh?

00:08:56.327 --> 00:08:59.289
[SATOKO] There's a reason you
have the dreams you do, Rika.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.375
A reason that's
very close to your heart.

00:09:02.417 --> 00:09:06.421
Reason?
There is no reason.

00:09:06.463 --> 00:09:09.090
There's nothing that
could justify this pain.

00:09:09.132 --> 00:09:12.385
Tell me.
Why do I have to suffer?

00:09:14.179 --> 00:09:15.180
[SATOKO]
Think.

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:16.723
Do you genuinely not understand

00:09:16.765 --> 00:09:19.476
why these awful
dreams haunt you?

00:09:19.517 --> 00:09:20.685
[RIKA]
Satoko.

00:09:20.727 --> 00:09:22.896
What are you saying?

00:09:25.857 --> 00:09:28.109
It hurts everywhere.

00:09:28.151 --> 00:09:29.110
They don't stop

00:09:29.152 --> 00:09:32.113
and they won't allow you
to sleep soundly either.

00:09:32.155 --> 00:09:35.366
Can you really not see
why they're so relentless?

00:09:38.703 --> 00:09:40.663
[RIKA]
What's happening?

00:09:40.705 --> 00:09:43.500
Rika, this is
the work of the curse.

00:09:43.541 --> 00:09:45.543
What does that mean?

00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:47.670
What curse? I don't‐‐

00:09:47.712 --> 00:09:49.756
Ahh!

00:09:49.798 --> 00:09:51.007
What is this?

00:09:51.049 --> 00:09:53.676
I can't feel my legs.

00:09:53.718 --> 00:09:54.969
Can't move.

00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:57.138
Please, Satoko.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.724
Let me show you.

00:10:00.642 --> 00:10:02.352
[gasps]

00:10:06.648 --> 00:10:08.066
[screams]

00:10:08.108 --> 00:10:10.026
That's right, Rika.

00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:14.405
Watanagashi is here.

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:16.616
[HANYUU]
Stop! Don't go any further!

00:10:16.658 --> 00:10:18.243
Satoko!

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:20.995
But are you not
Oyashiro, himself?

00:10:21.037 --> 00:10:22.580
Your newest servant
in the mortal realm

00:10:22.622 --> 00:10:25.041
is preparing for
your offertory ritual.

00:10:25.083 --> 00:10:26.626
It's only right that
you should observe it

00:10:26.668 --> 00:10:29.212
to its completion, is it not?

00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:32.882
[SATOKO]
You must confront the truth.

00:10:32.924 --> 00:10:33.800
It's not through chance

00:10:33.842 --> 00:10:35.093
or divine whim
that you're plagued

00:10:35.135 --> 00:10:36.594
by these nightmares.

00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:39.139
Please. Satoko, stop this!

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:41.015
[SATOKO]
You gravely sinned.

00:10:41.057 --> 00:10:43.476
And you will suffer forevermore.

00:10:45.728 --> 00:10:47.856
Stop this! Make it stop!

00:10:47.897 --> 00:10:50.525
Silence. I will not abide this.

00:10:51.818 --> 00:10:53.987
You shall not make demands

00:10:54.028 --> 00:10:56.447
and you shall not
avert your gaze again.

00:11:10.795 --> 00:11:13.131
[laughs]

00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:17.302
Well, perhaps I'll grant
you use of your mouth.

00:11:18.178 --> 00:11:21.681
Rika! Rika! Rika.

00:11:21.723 --> 00:11:23.850
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

00:11:23.892 --> 00:11:26.644
I'm so sorry. Forgive me!

00:11:26.686 --> 00:11:32.275
[squelching]

00:11:32.317 --> 00:11:34.694
Please, you can't allow
this to go on anymore!

00:11:34.736 --> 00:11:37.614
You have to make it stop
or Rika's mind will break!

00:11:37.655 --> 00:11:39.741
[laughs]

00:11:39.782 --> 00:11:41.701
[HANYUU]
You can't. You can't! You can't!

00:11:41.743 --> 00:11:44.495
Please, I'm begging you to stop!

00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:47.999
Stop making
Satoko do this to her!

00:11:51.669 --> 00:11:52.795
[laughs]

00:11:52.837 --> 00:11:53.880
It's too cruel.

00:11:53.922 --> 00:11:55.423
She was Rika's best friend,

00:11:55.465 --> 00:11:57.759
the one who supported her
through thick and thin

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.011
and they mean
everything to each other!

00:12:00.053 --> 00:12:01.638
So please, you can't!

00:12:01.679 --> 00:12:04.015
[laughs]

00:12:04.057 --> 00:12:06.559
You are as unceasingly
entertaining as they are!

00:12:06.601 --> 00:12:09.103
Please, you have to
stop making Rika suffer.

00:12:09.187 --> 00:12:12.440
You have to stop her,
I'm begging you!

00:12:13.191 --> 00:12:15.068
Forgive me.

00:12:15.109 --> 00:12:17.654
I know that I was wrong.

00:12:17.695 --> 00:12:20.240
[gasps]

00:12:20.281 --> 00:12:23.701
Huh? Rika?

00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:26.579
I'm so sorry, Satoko.

00:12:26.621 --> 00:12:31.417
Never meant to hurt you,
but I drove you to this.

00:12:31.459 --> 00:12:32.835
[SATOKO]
All I want is to live here

00:12:32.877 --> 00:12:35.296
in Hinamizawa
together with you, Rika.

00:12:35.338 --> 00:12:37.423
I would never
need anything else.

00:12:41.636 --> 00:12:43.805
Please forgive me.

00:12:43.846 --> 00:12:46.516
I forgive you and
since you repented.

00:12:46.557 --> 00:12:50.353
I know that Lord Oyashiro
can forgive you, too.

00:12:56.276 --> 00:13:00.989
Good. I'll get
things right, next time.

00:13:09.831 --> 00:13:11.291
Keep those words,

00:13:11.332 --> 00:13:13.960
and burn them deep
into your heart.

00:13:14.002 --> 00:13:15.962
Deep enough that they're
certain to stay with you

00:13:16.004 --> 00:13:17.547
when you wake up.

00:13:21.426 --> 00:13:23.011
Rika.

00:13:35.148 --> 00:13:37.734
[SATOKO sighs] Wasn't
that such a fun day, Rika?

00:13:37.775 --> 00:13:40.278
Yes, almost too much
fun for me to handle.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.988
Uh. You said you
needed to talk to me

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:43.573
about something before.

00:13:43.614 --> 00:13:45.283
What was it?

00:13:46.034 --> 00:13:47.160
[RIKA]
You honestly may not be able

00:13:47.201 --> 00:13:49.787
to make sense of
what I'm saying.

00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:51.039
If you can't,

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.416
I would at least
like you to hear it all.

00:14:01.299 --> 00:14:04.927
Rika, please don't.

00:14:04.969 --> 00:14:05.928
You see,

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:07.805
there were these
two dreams I had before

00:14:07.847 --> 00:14:09.974
that both seemed years long.

00:14:10.016 --> 00:14:14.187
The first one, felt like pure
torture as I was dreaming it.

00:14:14.228 --> 00:14:16.314
But when I remember
that dream now,

00:14:16.356 --> 00:14:20.276
all the wonderous moments
come rushing back to me.

00:14:20.318 --> 00:14:23.780
And in the second, I let all
those wonders pass me by.

00:14:23.821 --> 00:14:27.492
I chased my selfish desires
and I suffered for it.

00:14:27.533 --> 00:14:30.036
That suffering
never seemed to end.

00:14:30.078 --> 00:14:31.412
I beg you.

00:14:31.454 --> 00:14:33.247
Don't be deceived.

00:14:35.041 --> 00:14:36.667
But I was a fool.

00:14:36.709 --> 00:14:40.004
For some reason,
I thought I wanted to leave.

00:14:40.963 --> 00:14:42.507
Rika.

00:14:48.471 --> 00:14:50.264
I can hardly guess
what kind of things

00:14:50.306 --> 00:14:53.518
you've seen in your dreams,
but whatever may happen,

00:14:53.559 --> 00:14:56.562
I am always going
to be your friend.

00:14:56.604 --> 00:14:57.480
Always.

00:14:57.522 --> 00:14:59.232
The whole village loves you.

00:14:59.273 --> 00:15:02.443
We all do and we always will.

00:15:02.485 --> 00:15:03.986
[HANYUU] You have
to realize that this world

00:15:04.028 --> 00:15:06.614
they've brought
you to is not right!

00:15:11.536 --> 00:15:12.995
[SATOKO]
It's over.

00:15:13.037 --> 00:15:15.915
You're not gonna have
any more nightmares, okay?

00:15:15.957 --> 00:15:20.169
[sobs]
Satoko!

00:15:22.505 --> 00:15:24.048
It's a lie.

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:25.842
A cheap imitation
of the world you chose

00:15:25.883 --> 00:15:28.386
and the future
you won for yourself!

00:15:31.514 --> 00:15:34.267
So, please, don't be deceived!

00:15:34.308 --> 00:15:36.477
[EUA] However sharply
your cries pierce the void,

00:15:36.519 --> 00:15:37.854
they won't reach the cat,

00:15:37.895 --> 00:15:40.982
nor will she recognize that
she suffers at Satoko's hands.

00:15:41.023 --> 00:15:43.860
For indeed, she has
no reason to suspect her.

00:15:45.695 --> 00:15:47.113
[inaudible]

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:57.707
[KEIICHI] Wait, you
actually yelled at him?

00:15:57.748 --> 00:15:59.834
[RENA] Mm‐hmm. He needed
someone to yell at him,

00:15:59.876 --> 00:16:01.961
with the way he keeps coming
home drunk every night!

00:16:02.003 --> 00:16:03.588
[laughs]

00:16:03.629 --> 00:16:04.964
And if it ended up being you,

00:16:05.006 --> 00:16:07.675
I'm sure he got an earful
he's never gonna forget!

00:16:07.717 --> 00:16:10.386
Fair, but like, that's your dad.

00:16:10.428 --> 00:16:12.221
[SATOKO]
Really now, Keiichi.

00:16:12.263 --> 00:16:14.182
At the risk of
coming off as crude,

00:16:14.223 --> 00:16:16.392
harsh words can be the
least painful resolution

00:16:16.434 --> 00:16:18.060
to a family issue.

00:16:18.102 --> 00:16:19.770
And I'm not alone.

00:16:19.812 --> 00:16:21.105
I talked with his friend Rina,

00:16:21.147 --> 00:16:23.191
and she promised me
she would help.

00:16:23.232 --> 00:16:25.943
Awesome.
You worked hard, huh?

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:27.695
[RENA]
Mm‐hmm.

00:16:57.016 --> 00:16:58.142
[SATOKO]
And maybe, you don't quite

00:16:58.184 --> 00:17:01.979
understand how
happiness actually works.

00:17:02.021 --> 00:17:04.273
Even the smallest moments
of pain can leave marks

00:17:04.315 --> 00:17:07.318
on our hearts that will
last the rest of our lives.

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:11.697
And yet, those tiny moments
of happiness roll right off us

00:17:11.739 --> 00:17:14.075
and when we forget about them,

00:17:14.116 --> 00:17:17.328
we forget all the ways we're
blessed until eventually,

00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:19.372
even being perfectly
content leaves us yearning

00:17:19.413 --> 00:17:21.749
for some greater happiness.

00:17:21.791 --> 00:17:22.625
How sad it would be,

00:17:22.667 --> 00:17:26.796
not to let yourself be happy
for fear that it can't last.

00:17:26.837 --> 00:17:29.173
Aren't you happy
right now, Rika?

00:17:29.215 --> 00:17:32.343
And don't you think that
should count for something?

00:17:35.763 --> 00:17:38.891
[SATOKO]
Hey, promise me you won't leave.

00:17:38.933 --> 00:17:40.184
Okay, Rika?

00:17:40.226 --> 00:17:42.436
I promise.

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.939
My home will forever
be this village.

00:17:44.981 --> 00:17:47.858
And I'll always be here
at your side, Satoko.

00:17:57.785 --> 00:18:00.538
What was that memory?

00:18:30.526 --> 00:18:32.320
Tomorrow is...

00:18:42.204 --> 00:18:43.914
‐‐[SATOKO] Rika!
‐‐Huh?

00:18:44.498 --> 00:18:46.959
We should really be
heading home now!

00:18:46.959 --> 00:18:51.339
'Kay! Sorry, but could you
just give me one more minute?

00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:55.426
Are you ready for this?

00:18:59.013 --> 00:19:02.767
Gotcha! Now. Take this!

00:19:13.069 --> 00:19:15.529
[RENA]
Satoko! Stay away!

00:19:17.615 --> 00:19:24.622
[RIKA shudders]

00:19:26.666 --> 00:19:29.752
[RIKA]
Why... Why won't they stop?

00:19:29.794 --> 00:19:31.587
These memories.

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:43.182
Happy birthday, Satoko!
Surprise!

00:19:43.224 --> 00:19:44.558
Yeah, happy birthday!

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.395
Satoko, happy birthday!

00:19:47.436 --> 00:19:49.855
[MION]
Mm! And many more!

00:19:51.023 --> 00:19:52.483
Wow, you guys.

00:19:52.525 --> 00:19:53.943
Rika really went
out of her way

00:19:53.984 --> 00:19:55.986
to pull together
a party for you!

00:19:56.028 --> 00:19:57.988
Here, take a look at this.

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:10.960
[SATOKO] I appreciate
all of your efforts, I just...

00:20:11.001 --> 00:20:12.420
I know your
birthday can bring back

00:20:12.461 --> 00:20:14.338
a lot of painful memories
that make it hard

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:17.049
for you to celebrate.

00:20:17.091 --> 00:20:19.009
Yeah, it does.

00:20:19.051 --> 00:20:23.013
[RIKA] But hopefully it'll be
better if we all at least try.

00:20:23.055 --> 00:20:24.140
Forgive me.

00:20:24.181 --> 00:20:27.476
I feel so silly now
for how I've been acting.

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:33.524
All of my friends are here
to celebrate my birthday.

00:20:33.566 --> 00:20:36.694
So, what could I have
to be unhappy about?

00:20:37.111 --> 00:20:39.613
Great. Now to open these!

00:20:41.407 --> 00:20:43.576
You should open my gift now!

00:20:43.617 --> 00:20:45.161
Cute!

00:20:46.829 --> 00:20:49.623
Oh, Mion. Thank you so much.

00:20:49.665 --> 00:20:50.791
But before we leave,

00:20:50.833 --> 00:20:53.002
I have another
present to give you.

00:20:53.043 --> 00:20:55.504
[SATOKO]
Goodness. There's more?

00:20:57.173 --> 00:21:00.134
It was all I could afford,
but I hope you'll like it.

00:21:00.176 --> 00:21:02.970
[SATOKO] My! I'm shaking
with anticipation!

00:21:09.435 --> 00:21:10.978
Huh?

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:12.521
[RENA]
Satoko?

00:21:17.568 --> 00:21:21.113
How could you have known
what was in this box?

00:21:21.155 --> 00:21:23.282
[chortles]

00:21:23.324 --> 00:21:26.035
I'm shocked that you would even
attempt such an obvious ploy

00:21:26.076 --> 00:21:28.996
against the undisputed trap
master of our game club!

00:21:41.592 --> 00:21:43.594
Huh?!

00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:45.971
[RIKA] It's true that I had been
planning to play a prank on you

00:21:46.013 --> 00:21:49.266
with this gift,
up until last night.

00:21:53.437 --> 00:21:54.855
Rika, dear?

00:21:54.897 --> 00:21:57.441
Are you quite
thoroughly deceased?

00:21:57.483 --> 00:22:00.528
[RIKA]
I'll ask again.

00:22:00.569 --> 00:22:02.905
How could you have known that?

00:22:02.947 --> 00:22:05.658
[HANYUU] A great power
will lead her to the truth.

00:22:08.118 --> 00:22:09.995
A miracle.

00:22:11.956 --> 00:22:13.541
[gasps]

00:23:53.057 --> 00:23:56.185
[RIKA] Next time:
"<i>Kagurashi‐hen</i>, Part 3."
