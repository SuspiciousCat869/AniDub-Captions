00:00:35.118 --> 00:00:36.954
[SATOKO]
What a childish prank.

00:00:36.995 --> 00:00:39.540
Still, it's a change of tactics.

00:00:39.581 --> 00:00:40.958
They've never come
directly to the house

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:43.043
to antagonize me before.

00:00:43.085 --> 00:00:47.089
I saw a couple of snoops
when I was doing the laundry.

00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:52.344
[TEPPEI] They musta been
the ones who did this!

00:00:52.386 --> 00:00:54.972
Please, Uncle.
Do your best to stay calm.

00:00:55.013 --> 00:00:57.766
If you let your rage consume you
and turn to violence,

00:00:57.808 --> 00:01:01.228
that will only give the
bullies a reason to escalate.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.105
I understand how you're feeling,

00:01:03.146 --> 00:01:04.982
but if we lash out‐‐

00:01:08.151 --> 00:01:10.028
[TEPPEI]
Don't you worry, kid.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.280
It took me long enough,

00:01:11.321 --> 00:01:13.615
but I finally realized
my stupid hair‐trigger temper's

00:01:13.657 --> 00:01:15.325
to blame not only
for the shitty life

00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:16.827
I've been leading up till now,

00:01:16.868 --> 00:01:18.579
but also the pain
I caused the family

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.747
I love so damn much.

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:23.750
[chuckles]
I was such a moron.

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:31.883
[SATOKO]
Yes, you certainly were.

00:01:33.552 --> 00:01:34.678
[IRIE]
Well, Maebara.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.013
You're in charge here.

00:01:36.054 --> 00:01:38.223
Want to kick things off?

00:01:38.265 --> 00:01:41.393
Everyone, thank you
so much for coming today.

00:01:41.435 --> 00:01:42.936
As you probably know,

00:01:42.978 --> 00:01:44.896
Satoko Hojo has been
locked in her house

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:47.941
by her uncle
for several days now!

00:01:47.983 --> 00:01:49.568
The same uncle who abused her

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.903
and then abandoned
her for over a year.

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:54.615
How is that man fit
to be her "guardian"?

00:01:54.656 --> 00:01:56.325
One of our own
has been suffering.

00:01:56.366 --> 00:01:57.200
We can't just stand by

00:01:57.242 --> 00:02:00.078
and let it happen
a second longer!

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.414
Which is why we're
glad you've joined us.

00:02:02.456 --> 00:02:05.334
We'll show these bureaucrats
how much we care!

00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:08.378
We won't abandon her
like her uncle did!

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.588
For the last three days,

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.424
we've been petitioning
Child Welfare, and we won't rest

00:02:12.466 --> 00:02:14.968
until they agree
to handle Satoko's case!

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.429
[CROWD cheers]

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:34.691
So, any good news?

00:04:34.733 --> 00:04:37.736
It felt exactly like
a do‐over of yesterday.

00:04:37.778 --> 00:04:40.781
So, they're just gonna keep
monitoring the situation?

00:04:40.822 --> 00:04:42.991
That's right.
They set a timeline.

00:04:43.033 --> 00:04:44.910
They'll make their
decision in a month.

00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:46.244
A whole month?

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:48.246
How much damage are
these pencil‐pushers

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:50.081
willing to let her uncle do?

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:50.916
For what it's worth,

00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:53.543
it seems they're
taking us seriously.

00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:56.588
[MION] We told everyone
we'd be back at it tomorrow,

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.341
but I don't know
if they'll all be here.

00:04:59.382 --> 00:05:01.468
This is so frustrating.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.303
If they don't come back,

00:05:03.345 --> 00:05:06.223
I will even if it's by myself!

00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:07.641
I'm still in this.

00:05:07.682 --> 00:05:10.060
If we're going
to hope for a miracle,

00:05:10.101 --> 00:05:12.354
we have to make one together.

00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:13.647
Exactly.

00:05:13.688 --> 00:05:14.773
[MION]
Mm.

00:05:27.744 --> 00:05:28.954
[VOLUNTEER D]
Look, kid, the dam war

00:05:28.995 --> 00:05:31.206
is all over and
done with, all right?

00:05:31.248 --> 00:05:32.624
We've had our fill
of standing out front

00:05:32.666 --> 00:05:34.835
of government buildings
holding signs.

00:05:34.876 --> 00:05:37.337
What does the stupid dam war
have to do with anything?

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:39.798
I don't care about
your good old days!

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.092
'Cause now, I've got
a war of my own!

00:05:43.385 --> 00:05:45.595
Is that how you
speak to your elders?

00:05:45.637 --> 00:05:48.306
The hell's wrong
with kids these days?

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:51.309
Right. Seems you're
jumping into the ring,

00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:53.103
so let's see what you got.

00:05:53.144 --> 00:05:55.397
Let's be honest
about what this is.

00:05:55.438 --> 00:05:56.940
You're scared there
are people in the village

00:05:56.982 --> 00:05:58.942
who won't help
anyone named Hojo.

00:05:58.984 --> 00:06:00.777
Isn't that the real problem?

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:02.737
[OOISHI]
Interesting.

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:05.407
Mr. Maebara's on fire.

00:06:05.448 --> 00:06:08.994
He really believes he's
doing the right thing here.

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:11.037
Without even realizing it,

00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:13.540
he's contributing
to Satoko's misery,

00:06:13.582 --> 00:06:15.083
all because
his friends duped him

00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:17.919
into believing their ugly story.

00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:20.547
He thinks he's
protecting the girl,

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:22.090
when really, tearing her away

00:06:22.132 --> 00:06:26.344
from her surviving family
will only cause her more pain.

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:28.013
If he knew the truth,

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:30.682
things might be playing
out very differently.

00:06:30.724 --> 00:06:32.434
For their part,
the villagers are happy

00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:33.935
to use the Hojos as an excuse

00:06:33.977 --> 00:06:36.313
to get riled up and
band together again,

00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:39.566
just like they did
in the good old days.

00:06:39.608 --> 00:06:41.860
The new kid is proving
to be a very useful pawn

00:06:41.902 --> 00:06:45.280
for the culprits
behind the curse.

00:06:45.322 --> 00:06:46.531
[chuckles]

00:06:46.573 --> 00:06:47.824
I'm impressed.

00:06:47.866 --> 00:06:49.993
Good work, Mr. Maebara.

00:06:54.372 --> 00:06:56.833
[KUMAGAI] Yesterday's
got nothing on today's crowd.

00:06:56.875 --> 00:06:58.126
I've gotta hand it to him.

00:06:58.168 --> 00:07:02.881
The whole village responded
to his call to action.

00:07:02.923 --> 00:07:05.050
Well, that's what it's
supposed to look like

00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:06.801
they're doing, anyway.

00:07:06.843 --> 00:07:08.678
What do you mean?

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:09.512
[OOISHI]
It's all going

00:07:09.554 --> 00:07:11.723
according to the
village's grand plan.

00:07:11.765 --> 00:07:15.268
Still, the kid knows how
to make his voice heard.

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.187
If he's going to be
a bigshot around here,

00:07:17.228 --> 00:07:20.649
you may want to start thinking
about being nice to him now.

00:07:29.157 --> 00:07:30.075
[KUMAGAI]
You're going?

00:07:30.116 --> 00:07:32.535
[OOISHI chuckles]
Next spring,

00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:35.163
I'll finally be old
enough to retire.

00:07:35.205 --> 00:07:36.373
Might as well go out there

00:07:36.414 --> 00:07:39.125
and make the chief
look good while I can.

00:07:42.003 --> 00:07:43.213
[IRIE]
Is that...

00:07:43.254 --> 00:07:45.090
Well, Mr. Maebara!

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:47.425
How are you doing this morning?

00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:52.847
[HARAYAMA]
It's getting worse.

00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:53.807
Well, um...

00:07:53.848 --> 00:07:56.893
I guess I'll give
the police another call.

00:07:56.935 --> 00:07:59.020
Right, I'll go get him.

00:08:02.983 --> 00:08:04.567
Ooishi!

00:08:04.609 --> 00:08:07.112
The Chief's on the radio
and he's calling for you!

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:08.655
Ah, thanks for the heads up.

00:08:08.697 --> 00:08:12.033
Seems like my boss wants
to get hold of me, everyone, so

00:08:12.075 --> 00:08:15.829
I'd appreciate it if you could
get this crowd to disperse.

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:19.791
So that's it.

00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:22.085
I knew you were
going easy on 'em.

00:08:22.127 --> 00:08:24.045
It's not like you
to talk things out.

00:08:24.087 --> 00:08:26.297
You'd normally start
twisting that boy's arm

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:28.174
at the first excuse he gave you.

00:08:28.216 --> 00:08:30.844
If Mr. Maebara wants
to play the hero for today,

00:08:30.885 --> 00:08:33.221
I suppose
I don't mind letting him.

00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:36.182
Hey, care for a smoke?

00:08:38.977 --> 00:08:40.437
That boy charges headlong

00:08:40.478 --> 00:08:42.147
through everything
in front of him.

00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:45.650
He doesn't doubt for a
second that he's in the right.

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:47.360
Say again?

00:08:47.402 --> 00:08:48.945
[OOISHI chuckles]

00:08:48.987 --> 00:08:50.947
I think it's time
we play pretend,

00:08:50.989 --> 00:08:52.949
and let the kid handle
the real work.

00:08:52.991 --> 00:08:55.076
The kid?

00:08:55.118 --> 00:08:57.871
[OOISHI]
Here they come.

00:08:57.912 --> 00:09:00.415
Our VIPs.

00:09:00.457 --> 00:09:02.167
Let's go, Kuma.

00:09:05.378 --> 00:09:07.213
Why's he here?

00:09:07.255 --> 00:09:09.382
[CWS CHIEF]
How does it look down there?

00:09:09.424 --> 00:09:12.177
Any sign of them giving up
and going away?

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:19.100
Well, Detective Ooishi's
talking to them now, so...

00:09:23.354 --> 00:09:24.564
[CWS CHIEF]
What happened?

00:09:24.606 --> 00:09:27.067
Sir, they're coming now!

00:09:27.108 --> 00:09:28.359
[RENA]
Okay, guys!

00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:29.944
We're moving in!

00:09:33.531 --> 00:09:34.783
Hang on, Satoko.

00:09:34.824 --> 00:09:36.284
We're coming!

00:09:40.789 --> 00:09:43.458
Whatever you're cooking up
there smells damn good.

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.376
[chortles]

00:09:45.418 --> 00:09:47.545
It tastes good, too,
I might add.

00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:49.839
Now, be a dear and
set the table, will you?

00:09:49.881 --> 00:09:52.383
[TEPPEI]
Sure thing, happy to.

00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:01.935
My sincerest apologies
for the trouble!

00:10:01.976 --> 00:10:04.979
You're going to do something
to help Satoko, aren't you?

00:10:05.021 --> 00:10:06.147
[CWS CHIEF]
Right away!

00:10:06.189 --> 00:10:07.023
Assistant Manager!

00:10:07.065 --> 00:10:08.733
Please head straight
to the Hojo residence!

00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:10.985
[HARAYAMA]
You're sending me, sir?

00:10:11.027 --> 00:10:12.946
But wouldn't her
case worker be better?

00:10:12.987 --> 00:10:15.657
There's no time,
Satoko is in danger!

00:10:15.698 --> 00:10:17.242
[HARAYAMA]
Understood!

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:18.451
I'm on my way!

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.412
[OOISHI] It's almost time
for us to move out, Kuma.

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:22.580
Things're heating up.

00:10:22.622 --> 00:10:23.414
If we don't do something,

00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:26.584
this bunch may scare
Teppei out of the village.

00:10:26.626 --> 00:10:27.544
I don't understand.

00:10:27.585 --> 00:10:29.462
Would that be a bad thing?

00:10:29.504 --> 00:10:31.131
[OOISHI]
It most certainly would.

00:10:31.172 --> 00:10:34.843
I need him to stick around
at least until Watanagashi.

00:10:38.721 --> 00:10:40.682
A moment, Mr. Maebara.

00:10:40.723 --> 00:10:43.351
Are you still gonna try
and get in our way now?

00:10:43.393 --> 00:10:46.354
[OOISHI]
Not at all, Mr. Harayama?

00:10:46.396 --> 00:10:47.897
If you're headed
for the Hojo residence,

00:10:47.939 --> 00:10:50.733
I would be happy
to give you a ride.

00:10:50.775 --> 00:10:52.026
Are you sure?

00:10:52.068 --> 00:10:53.528
[RENA]
If the police are with them,

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:55.071
Satoko's uncle
will have no choice

00:10:55.113 --> 00:10:57.448
but to let
Child Welfare come in.

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.117
Right, but why now?

00:10:59.159 --> 00:11:00.910
You were against us
a little while ago.

00:11:00.952 --> 00:11:02.412
So what changed?

00:11:02.453 --> 00:11:04.247
[laughs]

00:11:04.289 --> 00:11:05.582
The folks here at Child Welfare

00:11:05.623 --> 00:11:09.002
never got a full view of how
bad things are in that house.

00:11:09.043 --> 00:11:12.213
This way they get to see
it up close and in person.

00:11:12.255 --> 00:11:14.382
Thanks for doing
this for us, Detective.

00:11:14.424 --> 00:11:16.801
[OOISHI] This way please,
Mr. Harayama.

00:11:18.094 --> 00:11:19.429
[OOISHI]
Oh, right!

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:20.513
Since that's dealt with,

00:11:20.555 --> 00:11:23.099
could the crowd
kindly disperse now?

00:11:34.569 --> 00:11:37.447
[HARAYAMA] You're Teppei
and Satoko Hojo, correct?

00:11:37.488 --> 00:11:38.531
My name is Harayama,

00:11:38.573 --> 00:11:41.701
and I'm from Okinomiya
Child Welfare Services.

00:11:41.743 --> 00:11:43.203
Child Welfare?

00:11:43.244 --> 00:11:46.748
Why the hell would you bring
this guy here, Detective?

00:11:46.789 --> 00:11:48.833
The situation
is becoming urgent.

00:11:48.875 --> 00:11:50.793
I thought letting him see
the truth for himself

00:11:50.835 --> 00:11:53.880
would be faster than me
trying to lay it out for him.

00:11:53.922 --> 00:11:54.881
What do you mean?

00:11:54.923 --> 00:11:57.634
"See the truth for myself"?

00:12:00.386 --> 00:12:01.763
The villagers have
banded together

00:12:01.804 --> 00:12:05.058
to wage a harassment campaign
against me and my uncle.

00:12:05.099 --> 00:12:06.226
‐‐Huh?
‐‐Huh?

00:12:17.695 --> 00:12:20.406
[KUMAGAI]
And you knew this was going on?

00:12:20.448 --> 00:12:23.201
[OOISHI] They had reached out
to me for help a while ago.

00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:25.161
[KUMAGAI]
Kinda fishy, though.

00:12:25.203 --> 00:12:28.706
I mean, the whole village
coming together to bully them?

00:12:28.748 --> 00:12:31.292
I would be skeptical of
such an ugly story myself,

00:12:31.334 --> 00:12:34.545
if I heard it happened
anywhere but Hinamizawa...

00:12:38.258 --> 00:12:39.842
I've searched
your home thoroughly,

00:12:39.884 --> 00:12:42.679
and I've conducted
an interview with Satoko.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.472
So what?

00:12:44.514 --> 00:12:47.100
To put it very simply,

00:12:47.141 --> 00:12:48.768
your living situation is nothing

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:51.229
like what the protesters
have been portraying.

00:12:51.271 --> 00:12:53.106
That's what we've been sayin'!

00:12:53.147 --> 00:12:54.274
So, then,

00:12:54.315 --> 00:12:56.192
now that you see what
we're dealing with,

00:12:56.234 --> 00:12:59.654
what will Child Welfare Services
be doing with the Hojos?

00:12:59.696 --> 00:13:01.990
Having been born
and raised in Okinomiya,

00:13:02.031 --> 00:13:05.910
I know Hinamizawa has
its own way of doing things.

00:13:05.952 --> 00:13:07.996
And if the Sonozakis
are involved in this.

00:13:08.037 --> 00:13:11.207
I don't know how
much our agency can do.

00:13:11.249 --> 00:13:13.960
[OOISHI]
How about this, then?

00:13:14.002 --> 00:13:18.381
Your agency can bow out
and let me take over the case.

00:13:18.423 --> 00:13:21.217
Me and the Okinomiya
Police Department, of course.

00:13:21.259 --> 00:13:24.554
Wait a minute, Ooishi,
we haven't asked the chief!

00:13:24.595 --> 00:13:26.347
So, what do you say?

00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:28.599
[sighs]

00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:30.059
Hmm...

00:13:30.101 --> 00:13:32.353
Agreed. I'll leave it to you.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.649
That was the right move.

00:13:38.192 --> 00:13:39.610
[OOISHI]
Come to think of it.

00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:42.989
The Watanagashi festival
is tomorrow, isn't it?

00:13:43.031 --> 00:13:45.199
[TEPPEI] Hmm?
What's that got to do with this?

00:13:45.241 --> 00:13:48.411
You've heard of the curse of
Lord Oyashiro, haven't you?

00:13:48.453 --> 00:13:50.830
You know it targets
the village's enemies.

00:13:50.872 --> 00:13:53.499
Isn't that right?

00:13:53.541 --> 00:13:55.251
And that means us.

00:13:56.127 --> 00:13:58.379
[OOISHI] Exactly but the
ones who carry out this

00:13:58.421 --> 00:13:59.422
so‐called curse

00:13:59.464 --> 00:14:01.883
are garden‐variety thugs
and there's a good chance

00:14:01.924 --> 00:14:03.968
they'll be coming
after your family.

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:06.512
I recommend you two
spend tomorrow inside.

00:14:06.554 --> 00:14:09.182
[TEPPEI] Is that gonna be
enough to keep us safe?

00:14:09.223 --> 00:14:10.767
We'll have eyes on your place.

00:14:10.808 --> 00:14:13.186
I'll be here while
the festival's going on.

00:14:16.522 --> 00:14:18.566
You're gonna be fine.

00:14:38.628 --> 00:14:42.173
[phone rings]

00:14:42.215 --> 00:14:43.299
Yes, who's there?

00:14:43.341 --> 00:14:44.133
[SATOKO]
Rika?

00:14:44.175 --> 00:14:45.218
[gasps]

00:14:45.259 --> 00:14:46.844
Satoko, are you okay?

00:14:46.886 --> 00:14:47.762
What happened?

00:14:47.804 --> 00:14:49.347
Ooishi should
have come by today‐‐

00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:51.557
[SATOKO]
Calm down, please.

00:14:51.599 --> 00:14:52.600
I just got through having

00:14:52.642 --> 00:14:55.478
a very similar
conversation with Keiichi.

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:58.189
[RIKA] So, what happened
when they showed up?

00:14:58.231 --> 00:15:00.483
[SATOKO] I cried out
and begged them for help

00:15:00.525 --> 00:15:03.361
and my uncle went
berserk and attacked me.

00:15:03.403 --> 00:15:05.988
But Ooishi was able
to subdue him quickly

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:09.075
and they hauled him off to
the police station in Okinomiya.

00:15:12.453 --> 00:15:14.414
[RIKA]
You're not hurt, are you?

00:15:14.455 --> 00:15:15.540
[SATOKO]
I'm fine.

00:15:15.581 --> 00:15:17.959
And I won't be needing
to worry about my uncle anymore

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.046
because he's never coming
back to this house again.

00:15:22.088 --> 00:15:23.381
[RIKA]
That's good.

00:15:23.423 --> 00:15:27.218
I'm so glad that you stood up
and fought for yourself.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.471
You challenged fate and won.

00:15:30.513 --> 00:15:32.640
[SATOKO]
Rika.

00:15:32.682 --> 00:15:35.935
At long last, I can be free.

00:15:42.817 --> 00:15:43.818
She must think that

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:46.612
she's finally gotten
to the happy ending.

00:15:46.654 --> 00:15:50.783
But the curse of Lord Oyashiro
is about to begin in earnest.

00:15:56.664 --> 00:15:57.582
[RENA]
So Satoko's going to get to

00:15:57.623 --> 00:15:59.917
celebrate
Watanagashi with us?

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:01.127
[KEIICHI] She said on the
phone that she was ready

00:16:01.169 --> 00:16:03.713
to put her full energy into it!

00:16:03.754 --> 00:16:04.630
[laughs]

00:16:04.672 --> 00:16:06.466
That does sound like her.

00:16:06.507 --> 00:16:08.718
[MION]
Huh? There they are.

00:16:09.594 --> 00:16:10.887
Oh, hey, Mion!

00:16:10.928 --> 00:16:12.305
Sorry we're late!

00:16:12.346 --> 00:16:13.848
Good to see you two!

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:15.975
I'll be joining you
this evening!

00:16:16.017 --> 00:16:18.227
Where are Satoko and Rika?

00:16:18.269 --> 00:16:20.605
[MION] Rika's on her way
to pick up Satoko now.

00:16:20.646 --> 00:16:22.940
[SHION] So, the whole gang
will be back together!

00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:24.650
[RENA]
Mm‐hmm.

00:16:24.692 --> 00:16:28.237
I'm sure that tonight's going
to be a special night!

00:16:36.662 --> 00:16:37.747
[SATOKO]
Goodness.

00:16:37.788 --> 00:16:39.665
It seems you're finally awake.

00:16:43.503 --> 00:16:46.130
[TEPPEI]
My head feels really heavy.

00:16:51.177 --> 00:16:52.929
[TEPPEI]
What the hell is this?

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:57.975
[TEPPEI barfs]

00:16:58.017 --> 00:16:59.977
Uncle, your timing is terrible.

00:17:00.019 --> 00:17:03.314
Rika is on her way
to fetch me as we speak.

00:17:03.356 --> 00:17:06.025
And she'll be expecting
to find a pitiable princess,

00:17:06.067 --> 00:17:09.320
rescued from the clutches
of her abusive uncle.

00:17:09.362 --> 00:17:12.490
Then when we cross paths with
the villagers at the festival,

00:17:12.532 --> 00:17:13.366
they'll fawn over me,

00:17:13.407 --> 00:17:15.868
and tell me how glad they
are to see that I'm safe.

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:16.911
Wait, Satoko.

00:17:16.953 --> 00:17:18.454
What are you sayin'?

00:17:18.496 --> 00:17:20.748
What happened with you
while I was passed out?

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:23.209
I thought the villagers
were gangin' up on you.

00:17:25.378 --> 00:17:26.254
[sighs]

00:17:26.295 --> 00:17:27.797
So, Uncle...

00:17:27.838 --> 00:17:29.382
What's up?

00:17:31.008 --> 00:17:32.093
How has it been for you,

00:17:32.134 --> 00:17:35.054
living here in the house
with me for the past week?

00:17:37.181 --> 00:17:40.268
[TEPPEI]
I've really liked it.

00:17:40.309 --> 00:17:42.353
I might be happier
than a rotten bastard

00:17:42.395 --> 00:17:46.482
like me has any right to be.

00:17:46.524 --> 00:17:50.111
Well, I couldn't
be happier to hear that.

00:17:50.152 --> 00:17:53.239
But this is where it ends.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:57.868
Wait, Satoko?

00:17:59.912 --> 00:18:01.247
[SATOKO]
This is where you die.

00:18:01.289 --> 00:18:03.082
[gunshot]

00:18:10.131 --> 00:18:11.215
Huh?!

00:18:11.257 --> 00:18:15.928
What... Wh‐What
the hell is this?

00:18:18.389 --> 00:18:20.975
[SATOKO]
Please, Uncle. Run!

00:18:21.017 --> 00:18:22.226
Oh, no, no.

00:18:22.268 --> 00:18:24.895
We are certainly
not having any of that!

00:18:30.484 --> 00:18:32.570
[SATOKO]
Listen. You have to get away!

00:18:32.612 --> 00:18:34.447
Get out of here!

00:18:34.488 --> 00:18:37.158
Wait, Satoko! Talk to me!

00:18:37.199 --> 00:18:38.618
What's going on?

00:18:46.292 --> 00:18:48.377
You're being a fool!

00:19:10.316 --> 00:19:11.275
[SATOKO]
Please, stop it!

00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:13.194
What do you think
you're doing, here?

00:19:13.235 --> 00:19:14.153
I'm done with all this!

00:19:14.195 --> 00:19:16.530
I don't want any of it anymore!

00:19:16.572 --> 00:19:18.240
I don't wanna kill my uncle.

00:19:18.282 --> 00:19:19.659
Or anybody.

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:22.745
I don't want anyone else to die!

00:19:22.787 --> 00:19:23.871
All I've done.

00:19:23.913 --> 00:19:25.247
All these loops
I've lived through

00:19:25.289 --> 00:19:28.584
are to ensure Satoko Hojo
finally gets to be happy!

00:19:28.626 --> 00:19:30.169
You've turned
into somebody else.

00:19:30.211 --> 00:19:31.629
You're not me anymore!

00:19:31.671 --> 00:19:33.089
I am my true self!

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:34.924
Give me back Satoko!

00:19:38.219 --> 00:19:39.929
You're talking nonsense.

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:42.098
I am the only Satoko.

00:19:45.434 --> 00:19:50.272
[laughs]

00:19:52.817 --> 00:19:54.360
So, what are you, then?

00:19:54.402 --> 00:19:56.862
Simply the dregs of some
long‐discarded fragment,

00:19:56.904 --> 00:19:58.948
claiming to be the real Satoko.

00:19:58.989 --> 00:19:59.990
You're wrong!

00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:02.034
You're that, and nothing else.

00:20:02.076 --> 00:20:03.285
There's nothing to give back.

00:20:03.327 --> 00:20:06.247
because I am Satoko Hojo.

00:20:06.288 --> 00:20:09.333
And you have no reason to exist.

00:20:11.001 --> 00:20:12.586
[SATOKO]
I don't know.

00:20:12.628 --> 00:20:15.506
I don't know exactly
where I went wrong.

00:20:15.548 --> 00:20:17.758
But I went wrong somewhere!

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:19.427
I love Rika.

00:20:19.468 --> 00:20:21.887
I love her more than anything.

00:20:21.929 --> 00:20:24.640
I want to be with her forever!

00:20:24.682 --> 00:20:29.603
And I finally learned
to be honest about that.

00:20:29.645 --> 00:20:32.356
But I must have made a mistake.

00:20:32.398 --> 00:20:34.942
And that means you
have to be wrong, too!

00:20:40.489 --> 00:20:42.575
It's clear from my perspective.

00:20:42.616 --> 00:20:45.327
Your mistake was
rejecting this reality,

00:20:45.369 --> 00:20:49.248
desperately clinging to
the emotions of past lives.

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:51.375
I am Satoko Hojo.

00:20:51.417 --> 00:20:53.127
One who lives in loops.

00:20:53.169 --> 00:20:57.089
One who traverses
the great sea of fragments.

00:20:57.131 --> 00:21:00.050
Indeed. What I am is a witch.

00:21:09.226 --> 00:21:12.146
[EUA laughs]

00:21:12.188 --> 00:21:13.606
Eua, why?

00:21:13.647 --> 00:21:16.442
[EUA] Your tale‐‐or rather,
the tale you have shared,

00:21:16.484 --> 00:21:20.821
has entertained unceasingly,
even to this very moment!

00:21:20.863 --> 00:21:23.574
I have invested such a meager
bit of my power in you,

00:21:23.616 --> 00:21:26.786
yet profited so greatly from it!

00:21:27.787 --> 00:21:29.789
[SATOKO]
You mean, you knew?

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:31.707
You knew everything
from the start?

00:21:31.749 --> 00:21:33.751
[EUA] I must say,
though you were clearly happy

00:21:33.793 --> 00:21:35.503
to make use of my power,

00:21:35.544 --> 00:21:38.798
your way of expressing it
was quite grating at times.

00:21:38.839 --> 00:21:39.799
And yet,

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:42.802
I cannot say you've
ever failed to amuse.

00:21:42.843 --> 00:21:44.470
Satoko.

00:21:48.057 --> 00:21:51.435
Therefore, if your current
state brings you such anguish.

00:21:51.477 --> 00:21:52.394
I shall relieve you

00:21:52.436 --> 00:21:54.480
of all the painful emotions
that burden you,

00:21:54.522 --> 00:21:58.234
as a way of reward for the
entertainment you've given me.

00:21:58.275 --> 00:22:03.364
[laughs]

00:22:03.405 --> 00:22:06.951
Even still, you are
boundlessly entertaining!

00:22:12.039 --> 00:22:14.124
I've been such a fool.

00:22:14.166 --> 00:22:15.042
Goodness.

00:22:15.084 --> 00:22:18.254
Thankfully, I'm the
furthest thing from stupid.

00:22:28.889 --> 00:22:30.558
Satoko?

00:23:52.973 --> 00:23:56.435
[RIKA] Next time:
"Tatariakashi‐hen, Part 5."
