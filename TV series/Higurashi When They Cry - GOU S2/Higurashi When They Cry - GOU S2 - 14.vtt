WEBVTT

00:00:10.052 --> 00:00:11.553
This was as much
as I could afford,

00:00:11.595 --> 00:00:13.055
but I hope you'll like it.

00:00:13.096 --> 00:00:16.183
[SATOKO] My! I'm shaking
with anticipation!

00:00:22.481 --> 00:00:23.899
Huh?

00:00:23.941 --> 00:00:25.192
[RENA]
Satoko?

00:00:29.154 --> 00:00:32.241
How could you have known
what was in this box?

00:00:33.242 --> 00:00:35.077
[chortles]

00:00:35.118 --> 00:00:36.954
I am shocked that
you would even attempt

00:00:36.995 --> 00:00:39.581
such an obvious ploy against
the undisputed trap master

00:00:39.623 --> 00:00:41.041
of our game club!

00:00:53.387 --> 00:00:54.805
[SATOKO gasps]

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:58.016
[RIKA] It's true that I had been
planning to play a prank on you

00:00:58.058 --> 00:01:01.645
with this gift,
up until last night.

00:01:01.687 --> 00:01:03.689
I decided to trade it
for something I knew

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.109
would make you happy.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.195
I'll ask again.

00:01:10.237 --> 00:01:12.197
How could you have known that?

00:01:14.575 --> 00:01:16.076
[gasps]

00:01:19.496 --> 00:01:20.747
[MION]
Whoa!

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:22.291
Guys, what is this?

00:01:24.042 --> 00:01:25.794
[SATOKO] Of all the
things to give it away.

00:01:25.836 --> 00:01:27.212
[MION]
Satoko‐‐

00:01:31.675 --> 00:01:35.053
[RENA shudders]

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:39.516
No!

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:21.284
[RIKA gasping]

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:34.840
[hyperventilating]

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:49.104
Nice of you to join us, Rika!

00:03:49.187 --> 00:03:50.647
It seems as if you're waking up

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:54.359
from one of your
nightmares, yet again.

00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:56.570
Is there something wrong?

00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:59.406
[RIKA]
My nightmares? You're lying!

00:03:59.448 --> 00:04:01.408
Every moment of that was real!

00:04:06.037 --> 00:04:07.330
And it all happened because of‐‐

00:04:07.372 --> 00:04:08.707
[squelch]

00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:27.893
[SATOKO]
Happened because of who?

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:31.730
You think you can blame
everything on me?

00:04:31.772 --> 00:04:33.940
It's not my fault.
It's not my fault.

00:04:33.982 --> 00:04:35.650
It's not my fault!

00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:48.705
It's not my fault.

00:04:48.747 --> 00:04:51.374
It's yours. All of it!

00:05:24.825 --> 00:05:29.955
[RIKA screams]

00:05:29.996 --> 00:05:33.041
Why? How could you?

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:37.379
How could I? You made me!

00:05:40.632 --> 00:05:41.842
You brought it all on yourself

00:05:41.883 --> 00:05:45.136
by dreaming of running
off to St. Lucia!

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:49.140
Don't blame me! Blame yourself!

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:51.351
And your own stupid dream!

00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:58.984
Rika!

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.408
Sick of your
quaint hometown, huh?

00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:11.913
[SATOKO] You wanna find out
what high society is like?

00:06:11.955 --> 00:06:13.915
What's wrong with Hinamizawa?

00:06:13.957 --> 00:06:16.501
What are you trying
to get away from?

00:06:16.543 --> 00:06:18.879
Why don't you
care about Keiichi?

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.172
What about Rena?

00:06:21.214 --> 00:06:24.384
And Mion! And Shion!

00:06:24.426 --> 00:06:27.137
What about me? I'm here!

00:06:27.178 --> 00:06:29.055
Weren't we enough for you?

00:06:29.097 --> 00:06:31.266
Weren't you happy?

00:06:31.308 --> 00:06:34.352
I know you were, Rika!

00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:38.815
[SATOKO] So why did you
want out so badly?

00:06:38.857 --> 00:06:42.235
What's so good
about St. Lucia?

00:06:42.277 --> 00:06:43.612
Satoko.

00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:45.864
[SATOKO]
You know they'd look down on us!

00:06:45.906 --> 00:06:48.325
A gaudy campus
full of boring rich girls?

00:06:48.366 --> 00:06:52.037
That's what you're
leaving us for?

00:06:52.078 --> 00:06:56.041
You said you hated studying,
but you tortured yourself!

00:06:56.082 --> 00:06:58.877
That's how much you
wanted us to get in together!

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:01.254
And you said
you'd stick with me.

00:07:01.296 --> 00:07:04.549
You promised you'd
never leave me alone!

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:22.317
Rika, you liar.
You vile filthy liar!

00:07:24.903 --> 00:07:27.489
[RIKA]
You're calling me a liar?

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.115
[MAN A]
The hell's goin' on?

00:07:29.157 --> 00:07:31.326
[MAN B] The Hojo girl's
committing blasphemy!

00:07:31.368 --> 00:07:34.537
What's Satoko doing?
That's not right!

00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:36.122
Is this a part of the dance?

00:07:36.164 --> 00:07:37.666
'Cause it feels way different.

00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:39.417
Obviously not!

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:41.419
What lie do you
think I told you?

00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:43.088
Out with it!

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:45.465
Everything you've
been saying is nonsense!

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:00.563
[MAN G] The whole shrine
could burn down!

00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:02.065
[MAN H]
What do we do?

00:08:02.107 --> 00:08:03.984
[MAN I]
Why are they fighting up there?

00:08:04.025 --> 00:08:06.403
[MAN J] Water! We need
to put this out right now!

00:08:06.444 --> 00:08:08.363
Get a hose out here!

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:12.534
[SHION gasps]
Mion!

00:08:15.453 --> 00:08:20.792
Both of you,
get away from the fire!

00:08:20.834 --> 00:08:22.419
[RIKA] So, I'm wrong
for wanting to experience

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.004
something different in my life?

00:08:24.045 --> 00:08:26.172
That's what this is about?

00:08:26.214 --> 00:08:29.426
You don't wanna go somewhere
you'll have to study?

00:08:29.467 --> 00:08:30.927
Rika!

00:08:30.969 --> 00:08:32.679
You're just afraid of hard work.

00:08:32.721 --> 00:08:34.723
Don't try to blame that on me!

00:08:38.977 --> 00:08:41.938
[STUDENT A]
Did Lady Rika really just...

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:46.568
[SATOKO] You tried to ride a
unicycle and walk on stilts,

00:08:46.609 --> 00:08:48.778
but you failed
every time, right?

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.155
And what about it?

00:08:51.948 --> 00:08:53.992
This is like that for me!

00:08:54.826 --> 00:08:57.704
It doesn't matter
how much I study.

00:08:57.746 --> 00:08:59.205
It's not going to help me!

00:08:59.247 --> 00:09:00.290
[STUDENT B]
Get a teacher!

00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:01.332
Do you get it yet?

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:03.918
I hate studying!

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.295
I hate it. I hate it.

00:09:05.336 --> 00:09:09.549
I hate, hate, hate it so much!

00:09:09.591 --> 00:09:11.968
That's why I'm going
to keep dragging you

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:13.511
out of bed to study.

00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:16.389
Because I know
that's what it will take!

00:09:17.432 --> 00:09:21.227
You and I are going to get into
St. Lucia Academy together!

00:09:24.064 --> 00:09:26.191
That has always been my dream!

00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:34.032
[SATOKO]
I know it has.

00:09:36.326 --> 00:09:40.246
And that's why I did
my best to play along!

00:09:43.458 --> 00:09:45.418
[SATOKO]
But you abandoned me.

00:09:47.087 --> 00:09:48.671
[SATOKO]
Once we got there,

00:09:48.713 --> 00:09:52.300
you tossed me aside
like I meant nothing to you!

00:09:52.342 --> 00:09:55.553
You swore you'd stay with me!

00:10:09.692 --> 00:10:11.402
Abandoned you?

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:13.446
How many dozen times
did I reach out to you

00:10:13.488 --> 00:10:17.075
to offer help
when we were there?

00:10:17.117 --> 00:10:18.493
[SATOKO]
Sure.

00:10:18.535 --> 00:10:19.828
For a while, you did.

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:29.712
You gave me up for tea
with your stupid fangirls!

00:10:29.754 --> 00:10:31.172
That's a lie.

00:10:31.214 --> 00:10:32.298
I tried to invite you,

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.926
but you refused to
even give them a chance!

00:10:34.968 --> 00:10:37.804
I was just trying to give you
enough space to make new friends

00:10:37.846 --> 00:10:40.140
at the hoity‐toity school
of your dreams!

00:10:40.181 --> 00:10:42.684
[RIKA]
I never told you I wanted space!

00:10:42.725 --> 00:10:44.894
And you never asked me!

00:10:49.524 --> 00:10:52.944
I stopped helping you study
because you shut me out.

00:10:52.986 --> 00:10:54.904
And yet somehow
that makes it my fault

00:10:54.946 --> 00:10:56.865
that you were pulled out
of the main program?

00:10:56.906 --> 00:10:59.159
Of course, it was your fault.

00:11:01.411 --> 00:11:03.663
You dragged me someplace
I never belonged,

00:11:03.705 --> 00:11:09.210
just to make your
stupid dream come true!

00:11:09.252 --> 00:11:12.589
You were old enough
to be in high school.

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:16.259
How long does it take
to learn study skills?

00:11:16.301 --> 00:11:20.138
How many times are you
gonna make me tell you this?

00:11:22.348 --> 00:11:24.350
I despise studying!

00:11:24.392 --> 00:11:25.602
Even so...

00:11:25.643 --> 00:11:27.187
I just wanted...

00:11:38.198 --> 00:11:40.116
[BOTH]
...to be with you!

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:53.796
In Hinamizawa!

00:11:53.838 --> 00:11:56.216
At St. Lucia Academy!

00:11:57.133 --> 00:11:59.135
[BOTH]
You were all I needed!

00:12:07.477 --> 00:12:13.274
[EUA laughs]

00:12:13.316 --> 00:12:15.610
Whatever remnants of
<i>ennui</i> may yet fester within me

00:12:15.652 --> 00:12:17.862
could hardly endure
this spectacle!

00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:24.911
[laughs]

00:12:34.587 --> 00:12:36.589
I advise you to stop.

00:12:40.009 --> 00:12:46.724
[yells]

00:12:57.151 --> 00:12:58.820
What, precisely,
did you intend to do,

00:12:58.861 --> 00:13:02.615
had you broken free
of your bonds?

00:13:02.657 --> 00:13:04.117
Surely you bore no delusion

00:13:04.158 --> 00:13:05.451
that you could
shatter the very mold

00:13:05.493 --> 00:13:08.830
from which you
were so shoddily cast.

00:13:08.871 --> 00:13:10.748
There are many aspects
of me that failed

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:12.625
to manifest
in your making.

00:13:12.667 --> 00:13:14.961
Put simply, I possess
much that you lack,

00:13:15.003 --> 00:13:18.298
and lack nothing you possess.

00:13:18.339 --> 00:13:22.635
And as such, your defeat
at my hands is all but certain.

00:13:22.677 --> 00:13:24.053
You're wrong.

00:13:24.095 --> 00:13:25.722
There is a power
that can snatch victory

00:13:25.763 --> 00:13:27.890
even from the jaws
of certain defeat.

00:13:27.932 --> 00:13:30.143
Oh? Do tell!

00:13:30.184 --> 00:13:32.603
The power of miracles!

00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:35.857
If what you call "certainty"
can be undone by a miracle,

00:13:35.898 --> 00:13:36.774
then that which is "certain"

00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:39.193
cannot remain
"certain" indefinitely!

00:13:39.235 --> 00:13:40.320
[EUA]
Hmph.

00:13:40.361 --> 00:13:44.198
Then by all means,
show me this miracle of yours.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.992
Do that and I shall admit defeat

00:13:46.034 --> 00:13:50.371
and bring our game to an end
without a moment's hesitation.

00:13:50.413 --> 00:13:53.082
[HANYUU]
Rika! It's up to you now!

00:13:53.124 --> 00:13:55.168
Grant me this miracle!

00:13:59.255 --> 00:14:02.216
[SATOKO]
How are you this stubborn?

00:14:02.258 --> 00:14:04.010
Do you not understand how hard

00:14:04.052 --> 00:14:06.512
you've been making
things for me?

00:14:06.554 --> 00:14:09.640
[RIKA] It's no fun hearing you
talk when you're like this.

00:14:09.682 --> 00:14:11.309
Where are the theatrics?

00:14:11.351 --> 00:14:13.436
What happened
to the obnoxious laugh?

00:14:13.478 --> 00:14:16.022
[SATOKO]
Like you have any room to talk.

00:14:16.064 --> 00:14:19.692
What happened to sweet little
Rika and her easygoing smile?

00:14:19.734 --> 00:14:24.697
[RIKA] As much as I hate to say
it, this is who I really am now.

00:14:24.739 --> 00:14:28.076
You know how it is
for us, don't you?

00:14:28.117 --> 00:14:30.161
[SATOKO]
I do, indeed.

00:14:30.203 --> 00:14:32.246
[RIKA] I'd never have
guessed that you and I

00:14:32.288 --> 00:14:34.415
could have the same power.

00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.252
[SATOKO]
What a wonderful blessing.

00:14:43.132 --> 00:14:45.176
I love this power!

00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:47.428
You call me stubborn?

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:49.806
And who are you to talk?

00:14:51.849 --> 00:14:53.643
[SATOKO]
You're exactly right!

00:14:53.684 --> 00:14:55.978
And that's why I'll never.

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:57.772
Ever.

00:15:00.108 --> 00:15:02.026
Ever let you get away!

00:15:12.203 --> 00:15:14.497
[RIKA]
If this is real...

00:15:14.539 --> 00:15:17.208
If you're living
in loops like me...

00:15:20.086 --> 00:15:22.338
[RIKA] ...then I know
what can kill you.

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:39.605
What are you trying to do?

00:15:44.777 --> 00:15:46.404
Is that‐‐

00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:51.242
[RIKA]
Onigari‐no‐Ryuuou a sacred sword

00:15:51.284 --> 00:15:53.995
that can end the lives
of those who live in loops.

00:15:54.036 --> 00:15:55.371
[gasps]

00:15:55.413 --> 00:15:57.748
Great, how sloppy of me.

00:15:59.167 --> 00:16:01.294
[RIKA]
This was a gift.

00:16:01.335 --> 00:16:03.171
A gift I never wanted.

00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:06.757
The last thing Hanyuu
left behind for me!

00:16:35.536 --> 00:16:36.579
You can keep that.

00:16:36.621 --> 00:16:40.458
I assure you this sword
will certainly still work.

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.960
[RIKA] So, you were
the one who took it.

00:16:43.002 --> 00:16:44.921
[SATOKO]
Now then, Rika.

00:16:49.842 --> 00:16:51.594
Yes, it's time.

00:16:58.351 --> 00:17:01.103
[SATOKO]
The real battle starts now.

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:18.871
Not bad, Rika!

00:17:20.414 --> 00:17:23.417
You know, this all vaguely
reminds me of the time in club

00:17:23.459 --> 00:17:25.294
when I secured
my victory by burying you

00:17:25.336 --> 00:17:27.672
under a mountain of wash basins!

00:17:27.713 --> 00:17:31.175
And if you hadn't set that trap,
you never could have beaten me!

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:47.692
[SATOKO chortles]

00:17:47.733 --> 00:17:52.655
No such opportunities
this time but there's no need.

00:17:55.616 --> 00:17:58.578
Traps or no traps,
I will defeat you!

00:18:01.581 --> 00:18:03.457
[RIKA]
Club rule number two!

00:18:06.627 --> 00:18:09.755
Remember? "Do all you can
to claim victory!"

00:18:09.797 --> 00:18:10.715
Enough of that!

00:18:10.756 --> 00:18:13.009
It's time to stop
being a sore loser!

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:16.470
Do you really
believe you can beat me?

00:18:16.512 --> 00:18:19.140
[RIKA] No matter how deep
I might sink into despair

00:18:19.181 --> 00:18:22.893
and no matter how many times
I may find myself at a dead end.

00:18:25.605 --> 00:18:27.398
Fate can still be changed.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.525
The future is not decided!

00:18:49.003 --> 00:18:51.547
[RIKA] Onigari‐no‐Ryuuou
is whole again!

00:19:33.089 --> 00:19:36.092
[EUA laughs]
Are you witnessing all of this,

00:19:36.133 --> 00:19:38.427
O lesser part of me?

00:19:38.469 --> 00:19:40.221
They both live in loops and yet,

00:19:40.262 --> 00:19:44.058
they once again grapple with
the prospect of a final death.

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:48.062
Indeed, they grapple for
the power to inflict it.

00:19:48.104 --> 00:19:51.315
But for either to exercise it,
upon herself or the other,

00:19:51.357 --> 00:19:53.651
would be to forfeit her prize.

00:19:53.693 --> 00:19:56.362
Each of them is vying
for a life with the other

00:19:56.404 --> 00:19:59.073
but neither can abide the
other's vision of that life!

00:19:59.115 --> 00:20:00.908
The bitter irony of it all!

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:01.992
The spectacle they make,

00:20:02.034 --> 00:20:04.829
tearing into each other in
the darkness of their ignorance!

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:09.333
[laughs]

00:20:09.375 --> 00:20:12.128
What greater entertainment
could there be?

00:20:12.169 --> 00:20:14.380
[laughs]

00:20:17.591 --> 00:20:19.760
[SATOKO] When will you
accept the fight is over?

00:20:19.802 --> 00:20:20.970
[RIKA]
When I've won!

00:20:22.888 --> 00:20:26.517
[SATOKO] If you won't yield,
then what about this?

00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:28.519
Why don't we just die together?

00:20:28.561 --> 00:20:30.521
Right here and now.

00:20:30.563 --> 00:20:32.314
[RIKA]
You're willing to accept that?

00:20:32.356 --> 00:20:33.733
Then, why stop there?

00:20:33.774 --> 00:20:37.153
Why shouldn't we take everyone
else with us when we go?

00:20:37.194 --> 00:20:38.571
We can set off a new Big Bang

00:20:38.612 --> 00:20:40.823
and wipe this
whole universe clean!

00:20:40.865 --> 00:20:42.533
If that's what it's
going to take to keep you

00:20:42.575 --> 00:20:45.327
from getting your way,
then I'll do it!

00:20:45.369 --> 00:20:46.787
[gasps]

00:20:55.337 --> 00:20:59.216
[RIKA]
Satoko!

00:21:06.849 --> 00:21:08.392
Fine, you win.

00:21:08.434 --> 00:21:10.060
Don't hesitate.

00:21:10.102 --> 00:21:13.272
Erase me from your world
and be done with it.

00:21:13.314 --> 00:21:15.483
Everything would work
out fine for you.

00:21:15.524 --> 00:21:16.650
You'll have no
trouble fitting in

00:21:16.692 --> 00:21:19.987
with the well‐bred young ladies
of St. Lucia Academy.

00:21:25.659 --> 00:21:27.495
[RIKA]
That doesn't sound bad at all.

00:21:28.704 --> 00:21:30.664
[EUA]
Is she going to kill Satoko?

00:21:30.706 --> 00:21:32.833
No, surely she wouldn't.

00:21:32.875 --> 00:21:34.210
So, what will she do?

00:21:34.251 --> 00:21:35.753
[laughs]

00:21:35.795 --> 00:21:38.214
Imagine if the cat were
to take her own life!

00:21:38.255 --> 00:21:44.929
[laughs]

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:55.105
[EUA]
Is your miracle quite ready yet?

00:22:01.821 --> 00:22:04.281
[EUA]
If it is, then use it, quickly.

00:22:05.616 --> 00:22:08.285
And if not, then disappear.

00:22:14.667 --> 00:22:17.378
I would ask you to leave
no trace of yourself.

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:53.098
[RIKA] Next time:
"<i>Kagurashi‐hen</i>, Part 4."
