WEBVTT

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.776
Goodness,
I made a terrible mess.

00:01:21.373 --> 00:01:28.338
[SATOKO hums]

00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:55.657
Your timing couldn't
be better, Rika.

00:01:56.908 --> 00:01:58.285
[SATOKO]
I'll be right there!

00:01:58.327 --> 00:02:00.287
Please just give me a moment.

00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:07.294
I came here
to escort you, ni‐pah!

00:02:07.336 --> 00:02:09.671
Wonderful, I'm all ready.

00:02:09.713 --> 00:02:13.258
Now let's go and
celebrate Watanagashi!

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.010
[RIKA]
Is your house still dirty?

00:02:15.052 --> 00:02:16.470
We've got some time.

00:02:16.511 --> 00:02:19.097
I can help clean up
a bit if you want!

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:21.516
[SATOKO]
Oh, no, that won't be necessary.

00:02:21.558 --> 00:02:25.979
My room is a bit of a mess,
but it's not that bad.

00:04:02.451 --> 00:04:04.453
[SATOKO] Please excuse
the delay, everyone!

00:04:04.494 --> 00:04:05.912
[RENA]
Satoko!

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:08.123
Coach said you were scheduled
for a check‐up at the clinic,

00:04:08.165 --> 00:04:09.916
but he told me
you skipped out on it.

00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:10.959
Are you okay?

00:04:11.001 --> 00:04:13.628
Yeah, right now
I'm the best I've ever been!

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:14.463
I get it!

00:04:14.504 --> 00:04:16.423
It's 'cause you were too
scared to spend a whole night

00:04:16.465 --> 00:04:18.842
in the clinic by
yourself, isn't it?

00:04:18.884 --> 00:04:21.344
Satoko has had a hard time
falling asleep in a bed

00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:23.513
without me for as long
as I've known her.

00:04:23.555 --> 00:04:25.849
Awoo! I need to hear details!

00:04:25.891 --> 00:04:27.017
Details!

00:04:27.058 --> 00:04:28.810
Hear the details, huh?

00:04:28.852 --> 00:04:30.145
[SATOKO]
Hold it right there!

00:04:30.187 --> 00:04:31.938
I'm not sure exactly
what you take me for,

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.648
but I don't like your tone!

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.026
[laughter]

00:04:36.067 --> 00:04:37.944
[RENA] Honestly,
I was beginning to wonder

00:04:37.986 --> 00:04:39.029
if we would ever get the chance

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.573
to all laugh together
like this again.

00:04:41.615 --> 00:04:45.494
So was I, but we
all pulled through.

00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:46.870
As a team.

00:04:46.912 --> 00:04:47.954
[RENA]
Mm.

00:04:47.996 --> 00:04:48.872
[MION]
Now!

00:04:48.914 --> 00:04:50.373
Since Kei and Shion
are here with us,

00:04:50.415 --> 00:04:53.919
time for the Watanagashi
Six Demon Battle Royale!

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.504
You're sure you're
ready for that?

00:04:55.545 --> 00:04:57.255
You shouldn't underestimate me.

00:04:57.297 --> 00:05:00.217
No idea what we're doing,
but I'm doing it!

00:05:00.258 --> 00:05:01.760
[MION]
The rules are simple.

00:05:01.802 --> 00:05:04.054
Whoever has the best time
tonight is the winner!

00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:05.180
Sound good, everyone?

00:05:05.222 --> 00:05:06.723
[RIKA]
Yeah!

00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:13.605
[KEIICHI] Wonder who's
gonna take first place.

00:05:13.647 --> 00:05:15.065
[SATOKO]
Me, of course.

00:05:15.106 --> 00:05:17.526
[RIKA]
Hanyuu.

00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:20.695
You can no longer
travel this road with me.

00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:24.908
Or witness the happiness
on display tonight.

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.203
But still, in the
depths of my heart,

00:05:28.245 --> 00:05:31.998
I want to say "Look,
look at what we did."

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.584
Against all odds, we won.

00:05:34.626 --> 00:05:39.256
We've managed to change
our tragic future once again.

00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:46.304
â™ª

00:05:46.847 --> 00:05:50.600
[RIKA] You don't need
to worry anymore, Hanyuu.

00:05:50.642 --> 00:05:52.394
Because we've done it.

00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:57.107
We've escaped this dead end.

00:05:57.148 --> 00:06:02.362
We can create our own miracles
and cut ourselves free of fate!

00:07:12.015 --> 00:07:14.184
[KEIICHI]
Huh?

00:07:14.225 --> 00:07:18.021
Satoko?
The dance is just starting.

00:07:28.698 --> 00:07:32.410
Heh. Satoko, you
sly little devil, you.

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:38.291
[KEIICHI]
So, why'd we come up here?

00:07:38.333 --> 00:07:40.126
[SATOKO]
Rika told me everything.

00:07:40.168 --> 00:07:41.628
She told me how hard
you've been working

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:44.089
to try and help me get
away from my uncle.

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:45.757
[KEIICHI]
Well of course I did.

00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:48.885
That's what friends do, right?

00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:52.180
[SATOKO] And I'm so grateful
for all you've done for me.

00:07:52.222 --> 00:07:53.264
Which is why,

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:57.394
I feel a little guilty
asking for one more thing.

00:07:57.435 --> 00:07:59.229
You can say no.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:03.775
But could I please call you
"Nii‐Nii" from now on?

00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:05.652
Huh? But that's...

00:08:05.694 --> 00:08:07.779
[SATOKO]
Do you not like "Nii‐Nii"?

00:08:07.821 --> 00:08:10.448
[KEIICHI] No. I don't mind,
but I thought...

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:15.120
Okay, then that
settles it! Nii‐Nii!

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:16.746
My Nii‐Nii.

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:22.627
Yeah. I'm right here.

00:08:24.045 --> 00:08:27.799
And I also have something
I'd really like to give you.

00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:29.300
It's something that
was very important

00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:31.928
to my Nii‐Nii when
he was still with me.

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:34.597
But starting today you're
going to be my Nii‐Nii.

00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:37.809
So, I think that you should
have it, okay, Keiichi?

00:08:37.851 --> 00:08:39.936
[KEIICHI]
If you really think so.

00:08:42.147 --> 00:08:44.566
[SATOKO] I'd be so
embarrassed if this got out.

00:08:44.607 --> 00:08:47.235
Can we leave
before we're missed?

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:16.765
[OOISHI]
Screw it!

00:09:16.806 --> 00:09:18.016
Damn neck.

00:09:18.058 --> 00:09:21.102
Why does it have to be so itchy?

00:09:21.144 --> 00:09:23.271
Itchy, itchy, itchy!

00:09:23.313 --> 00:09:24.856
[gasps]

00:09:24.898 --> 00:09:26.399
Huh?

00:09:30.278 --> 00:09:31.613
[OOISHI]
Well, look at that.

00:09:31.654 --> 00:09:33.865
What are you up to now,
Mr. Maebara?

00:09:33.907 --> 00:09:35.575
I guess we'll see.

00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:40.663
[SATOKO] Just try
to make yourself at home.

00:09:40.705 --> 00:09:43.917
We're family now, which means
it's your house, too, Nii ‐Nii!

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:52.175
Hey, Satoko, your uncle's
still in jail, isn't he?

00:09:52.217 --> 00:09:53.301
[SATOKO]
That's right.

00:09:53.343 --> 00:09:54.385
Which means we
don't have to worry

00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:56.554
about him bothering us.

00:09:56.596 --> 00:09:58.973
It's just you and me here now.

00:09:59.015 --> 00:10:01.893
[KEIICHI] So, what was it
you wanted to give me, anyway?

00:10:01.935 --> 00:10:04.187
I'll be right back,
so you can wait for me here.

00:10:04.229 --> 00:10:05.730
[KEIICHI]
Okay.

00:10:14.906 --> 00:10:17.575
[KEIICHI]
Let's see. Where's the light?

00:10:31.422 --> 00:10:33.466
Rika.

00:10:35.343 --> 00:10:38.763
[SATOKO]
This is the end of your miracle.

00:10:41.474 --> 00:10:44.060
[SATOKO]
Say goodbye to happiness...

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:49.899
[SATOKO]
...and hello to despair.

00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:09.711
[screams]

00:11:11.421 --> 00:11:14.424
[laughs]

00:11:32.108 --> 00:11:34.360
I'll leave the rest
to you, Detective.

00:11:34.402 --> 00:11:36.404
I hope you're ready.

00:11:44.996 --> 00:11:46.664
[SATOKO]
No!

00:11:46.706 --> 00:11:47.916
[gasps]

00:11:49.334 --> 00:11:50.877
[OOISHI]
Ms. Hojo!

00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:56.299
What happened to you?

00:11:56.341 --> 00:11:58.009
That blood,
it's not yours, is it?

00:11:58.051 --> 00:12:00.553
[cries]

00:12:00.595 --> 00:12:03.598
Listen, I saw you with Maebara.

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.391
Is he still here somewhere?

00:12:05.433 --> 00:12:07.060
What about your uncle?

00:12:10.647 --> 00:12:13.483
I don't have time for this!

00:12:13.524 --> 00:12:20.531
[SATOKO sobs]

00:12:35.338 --> 00:12:37.715
Huh?!

00:12:49.102 --> 00:12:51.437
What? My god.

00:12:51.479 --> 00:12:53.273
[SATOKO]
Keiichi did this.

00:12:53.314 --> 00:12:56.317
He said something
about the curse.

00:12:56.359 --> 00:12:58.403
What's that about the curse?

00:12:58.444 --> 00:13:00.488
Is that the reason he went
and attacked Teppei?

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:03.908
Because your uncle has become
an enemy of the village?

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:06.494
If you're trying to protect him,
then you're just as guilty!

00:13:07.954 --> 00:13:10.081
Won't this damn itching stop?

00:13:10.123 --> 00:13:11.582
He came to me
when I was watching

00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:13.251
Rika's ceremonial dance.

00:13:13.293 --> 00:13:14.627
Huh?

00:13:14.669 --> 00:13:16.879
Out of nowhere, Keiichi just
grabbed onto my hand

00:13:16.921 --> 00:13:19.507
and started dragging me
away from the shrine.

00:13:19.549 --> 00:13:21.134
He seemed desperate and said

00:13:21.175 --> 00:13:23.636
we needed to go
to my house and talk.

00:13:23.678 --> 00:13:26.723
Keiichi Maebara
invited himself here?

00:13:26.764 --> 00:13:27.849
Over to the house where the man

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:30.268
he's been fighting
so hard against lives?

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:32.312
No, someone must
have told him to do it,

00:13:32.353 --> 00:13:34.480
someone from Hinamizawa.

00:13:34.522 --> 00:13:37.900
He was carrying out orders
for whoever is behind the curse.

00:13:37.942 --> 00:13:40.945
[SATOKO] Once we got here,
he began screaming,

00:13:40.987 --> 00:13:44.115
yelling crazy things
about being my Nii‐Nii,

00:13:44.157 --> 00:13:47.035
then he grabbed the bat
from my brother's room.

00:13:47.076 --> 00:13:48.494
Yes, the same brother
who went missing

00:13:48.536 --> 00:13:51.247
because of the curse,
Satoshi Hojo!

00:13:51.289 --> 00:13:53.583
Hah! My suspicions
were right this whole time.

00:13:53.624 --> 00:13:56.002
It's all
connected‐‐it has to be!

00:13:56.044 --> 00:13:57.170
Full of pure rage,

00:13:57.211 --> 00:14:00.506
he viciously attacked
my uncle using the bat.

00:14:00.548 --> 00:14:01.924
But then my uncle was able

00:14:01.966 --> 00:14:04.218
to get it out of his hands.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.095
And attacked.

00:14:06.137 --> 00:14:08.514
I called out and
tried to stop them,

00:14:08.556 --> 00:14:11.601
but my uncle was just
so angry at Keiichi

00:14:11.642 --> 00:14:14.854
for getting Child Welfare
Services involved in our lives.

00:14:14.896 --> 00:14:16.564
His temper took over,

00:14:16.606 --> 00:14:18.816
and nothing I said
could get through to him.

00:14:18.858 --> 00:14:20.985
Keiichi wouldn't
give up, either.

00:14:21.027 --> 00:14:24.614
He kept fighting and fighting.

00:14:24.655 --> 00:14:26.032
If I'd tried harder,

00:14:26.074 --> 00:14:28.493
maybe it wouldn't
have ended like this.

00:14:28.534 --> 00:14:30.578
Yeah, yeah, never mind
the self‐recrimination.

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:33.539
Tell me what else
Maebara had to say.

00:14:33.581 --> 00:14:34.582
The curse!

00:14:34.624 --> 00:14:36.751
What else did he say?

00:14:38.628 --> 00:14:39.837
Wait a second.

00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:41.506
When he was attacking my uncle,

00:14:41.547 --> 00:14:43.883
he kept on repeating
over and over.

00:14:43.925 --> 00:14:45.968
"This is the curse
of Lord Oyashiro!"

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:48.596
[chuckles]

00:14:48.638 --> 00:14:51.516
Yes!
I knew they were behind this!

00:14:51.557 --> 00:14:55.311
The culprits used our sweet
Mr. Maebara as their pawn.

00:14:55.353 --> 00:14:58.272
They must've forced the poor boy
to carry out the curse this year

00:14:58.314 --> 00:15:00.233
to prove his loyalty to them!

00:15:00.274 --> 00:15:05.113
[chuckles]

00:15:05.154 --> 00:15:08.199
Here is the solid,
undeniable evidence!

00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:10.785
Old pal, after five long years,

00:15:10.827 --> 00:15:13.788
I've found the connection
between Oyashiro's curse

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:15.915
and the murders in Hinamizawa.

00:15:15.957 --> 00:15:18.251
My hard work is paying off.

00:15:18.292 --> 00:15:20.670
Before long, I'll be able
to visit your grave

00:15:20.711 --> 00:15:23.381
and reveal the truth
of what happened to you.

00:15:23.423 --> 00:15:25.466
At last, this proof
will lead me straight

00:15:25.508 --> 00:15:28.553
to whoever's responsible.
[chuckles]

00:15:28.594 --> 00:15:31.556
Not just anybody could order
something like this done.

00:15:31.597 --> 00:15:33.558
They would have
to have authority.

00:15:33.599 --> 00:15:37.019
Think! Use your brain,
Kuraudo Ooishi.

00:15:37.061 --> 00:15:39.814
There must be a clue somewhere.

00:15:39.856 --> 00:15:41.732
I'm so happy for you.

00:15:41.774 --> 00:15:44.026
But I wonder if
I might ask, Detective,

00:15:44.068 --> 00:15:45.361
how your neck is feeling?

00:15:45.403 --> 00:15:48.239
How's it feeling?

00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:50.408
It's itchy, so damn itchy!

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:52.118
I was close to
figuring it all out, too.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:53.494
The answer's right there!

00:15:53.536 --> 00:15:56.664
I just need this goddamn
itching to stop, already!

00:15:56.706 --> 00:15:58.458
I am terribly sorry.

00:15:58.499 --> 00:16:00.835
You must be at the final stage.

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:03.463
Who was it?

00:16:03.504 --> 00:16:05.381
Who gave the order to kill him?

00:16:05.423 --> 00:16:06.674
Tell me!

00:16:06.716 --> 00:16:08.009
An order?

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:11.596
Who would tell somebody
to do such an awful thing?

00:16:11.637 --> 00:16:13.764
[gasps]
It can't be!

00:16:13.806 --> 00:16:17.935
Keiichi mentioned
a name, but no...

00:16:17.977 --> 00:16:19.479
She wouldn't...

00:16:23.524 --> 00:16:26.694
What name did he say while
he carried out his attack?

00:16:26.736 --> 00:16:28.196
You have to tell me.

00:16:28.237 --> 00:16:31.199
It's the key to everything.

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.742
It was Rika.

00:16:32.783 --> 00:16:34.452
She's who gave him the order.

00:16:34.494 --> 00:16:36.537
Heh. Rika Furude.

00:16:36.579 --> 00:16:38.539
Head of one of
the Three Families.

00:16:38.581 --> 00:16:40.541
Yes, it makes sense now.

00:16:40.583 --> 00:16:44.295
Of course, the Furude Shrine
would carry out the curse!

00:16:44.337 --> 00:16:47.632
I've connected the dots and
the picture is coming clear.

00:16:47.673 --> 00:16:50.676
I have proof of the crime
that's been committed.

00:16:50.718 --> 00:16:54.347
All that's left to do
is carry out the sentence!

00:16:57.475 --> 00:17:03.147
[SATOKO giggles]

00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:04.190
Yes, go on.

00:17:04.232 --> 00:17:08.027
Shatter Rika's heart into
tiny little pieces for me.

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:10.363
Lord Oyashiro's servant.

00:17:15.034 --> 00:17:18.204
It doesn't look like Keiichi and
Satoko ever turned up, huh?

00:17:18.246 --> 00:17:20.331
I'd probably better
make my way home too,

00:17:20.373 --> 00:17:23.584
else Grandma's gonna force me
to talk with my relatives.

00:17:23.626 --> 00:17:25.628
I think I'll go with you.

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:27.630
I can stay out in the
guest house for the night.

00:17:27.672 --> 00:17:30.633
Huh? Oh! Rika's here!

00:17:30.675 --> 00:17:32.426
Something wrong, dear?

00:17:32.468 --> 00:17:34.762
Have you seen
Tomitake anywhere?

00:17:34.804 --> 00:17:35.721
If you saw Takano,

00:17:35.763 --> 00:17:37.682
then he may have
been somewhere close by.

00:17:37.723 --> 00:17:39.809
Yeah, I just saw
the two of them.

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:42.144
They were out
in the parking lot.

00:17:44.313 --> 00:17:46.566
Ooishi's here?

00:17:46.607 --> 00:17:49.068
[OOISHI chuckles]

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:51.153
I finally found you.

00:17:51.195 --> 00:17:53.823
Ms. Rika Furude!

00:17:55.825 --> 00:17:56.617
[VILLAGER A]
Detective?

00:17:56.659 --> 00:17:58.619
[VILLAGER B]
What the hell are you doing?

00:18:01.122 --> 00:18:02.623
Why would you do this?

00:18:05.209 --> 00:18:06.127
Rika!

00:18:06.168 --> 00:18:08.129
[SHION]
What are you doing?

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:10.965
Now I finally
understand everything!

00:18:11.007 --> 00:18:12.550
[VILLAGER A]
Hey, whatever this is about‐‐

00:18:12.592 --> 00:18:13.843
[gunshot]

00:18:31.569 --> 00:18:32.987
[EUA chuckles]

00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:36.449
You are so marvelously
entertaining, children of man.

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:38.659
[MION] Detective! As heir
to the Sonozaki Family,

00:18:38.701 --> 00:18:41.871
I'm ready to hear you out,
so please, let her go!

00:18:41.912 --> 00:18:44.665
Huuuuh?

00:18:44.707 --> 00:18:48.544
You can't!

00:18:48.586 --> 00:18:50.421
[SHION]
Mion, grab Rika!

00:18:50.463 --> 00:18:52.506
[OOISHI]
Stay the hell outta my way!

00:18:52.548 --> 00:18:53.466
Leave her alone!

00:18:53.507 --> 00:18:55.009
‐‐Shion!
‐‐Make it stop.

00:18:55.051 --> 00:19:02.058
[OOISHI hysterically laughs]

00:19:03.517 --> 00:19:06.395
[SATOKO]
My, it's getting quite lively.

00:19:07.563 --> 00:19:10.566
[MION]
This can't be real.

00:19:11.192 --> 00:19:13.277
Please stop, I'm begging you.

00:19:13.319 --> 00:19:15.780
Shion! Mion!

00:19:15.821 --> 00:19:19.367
[MION]
Rena. Take care of Kei for me!

00:19:23.496 --> 00:19:26.082
No!

00:19:27.833 --> 00:19:30.461
[RENA]
Rika! Please, stop!

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:32.922
[OOISHI]
Charade is over.

00:19:32.963 --> 00:19:35.591
You can't hide
anymore, now confess!

00:19:35.633 --> 00:19:37.093
Rika Furude!

00:19:37.134 --> 00:19:40.513
[RENA]
Please! Take me instead!

00:19:42.723 --> 00:19:45.393
[RIKA] I really thought we
did everything right this time,

00:19:45.434 --> 00:19:47.770
so how did it end up like this?

00:19:47.812 --> 00:19:48.729
[OOISHI]
What?

00:19:48.771 --> 00:19:50.189
Speak clearly.

00:19:50.231 --> 00:19:51.357
Do it.

00:19:51.399 --> 00:19:53.275
I have nothing for you.

00:19:53.317 --> 00:19:54.110
Say it!

00:19:54.151 --> 00:19:55.986
The secrets of
the curse die with me,

00:19:56.028 --> 00:19:57.613
and you'll die knowing nothing.

00:19:57.655 --> 00:19:59.407
[OOISHI]
You're gonna tell me!

00:20:01.742 --> 00:20:07.498
[OOISHI]
Tell me! Tell me! Tell me!

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:09.083
Tell me!

00:20:09.125 --> 00:20:12.211
Tell me! Tell me!

00:20:12.253 --> 00:20:18.801
Tell me! Tell me!
Tell me! Tell me!

00:20:18.843 --> 00:20:24.640
Tell me! Tell me! Tell me!

00:20:24.682 --> 00:20:26.267
Huh?

00:20:26.308 --> 00:20:28.894
Satoko! Stay away!

00:20:28.936 --> 00:20:31.313
You still haven't
finished, really?

00:20:31.355 --> 00:20:32.314
For all your bark,

00:20:32.356 --> 00:20:34.775
you're awfully lacking
in bite, Ooishi.

00:20:34.817 --> 00:20:36.068
Huh?

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:39.989
What's this? Oh, I see now.

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:43.200
So, that was the
truth all along, huh?

00:20:43.242 --> 00:20:45.369
Rika Furude isn't behind this.

00:20:45.411 --> 00:20:47.037
She wasn't the culprit.

00:20:47.079 --> 00:20:49.081
No! It was you!

00:20:49.123 --> 00:20:52.793
Amazing. You finally got it.

00:21:03.846 --> 00:21:05.306
Rika, dear?

00:21:05.347 --> 00:21:08.476
Are you quite
thoroughly deceased?

00:21:10.936 --> 00:21:12.897
It's no good if
you're still alive.

00:21:12.938 --> 00:21:16.150
Then I can't go to the
next fragment with you.

00:21:16.192 --> 00:21:18.110
Well, I suppose it's easy enough

00:21:18.152 --> 00:21:20.863
to make sure you've
left this life.

00:21:23.783 --> 00:21:26.786
There, now I can be
certain that you're dead.

00:21:26.827 --> 00:21:29.497
But, Satoko...

00:21:29.538 --> 00:21:35.044
What? Why? No!

00:21:36.754 --> 00:21:39.882
I'm sorry, but I can't
let you escape just yet.

00:21:39.924 --> 00:21:42.301
Until you accept your
happy future with me

00:21:42.343 --> 00:21:43.594
in Hinamizawa.

00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:47.515
I will never, ever
let you escape this fate

00:21:47.556 --> 00:21:49.308
and that's for certain.

00:21:50.392 --> 00:21:52.228
[gunshot]

00:21:54.980 --> 00:22:01.987
[laughs]

00:22:05.658 --> 00:22:07.201
Now, then.

00:22:07.243 --> 00:22:09.995
Whatever will you do about this?

00:22:12.998 --> 00:22:15.459
Whatever can you do,
pitiful failure,

00:22:15.501 --> 00:22:18.170
when you cannot
view the fragments?

00:23:53.098 --> 00:23:56.435
[RIKA] Next time:
"Kagurashi‐hen, Part 1."
