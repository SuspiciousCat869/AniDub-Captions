WEBVTT

00:00:21.146 --> 00:00:23.524
Long ago, I was just like you.

00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:25.067
Whatever do you mean?

00:00:25.108 --> 00:00:27.444
For so many eons,
I could never bring myself

00:00:27.486 --> 00:00:29.196
to believe in miracles.

00:00:29.238 --> 00:00:31.823
For however many worlds
we might live through.

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:34.326
And for all the blessings
we may be granted.

00:00:34.368 --> 00:00:37.538
I still knew that we existed
at the mercy of fate,

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:41.208
a power we could
never hope to overcome.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.961
And so I allowed
myself no expectations.

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:46.547
I knew that in the end,
they would only be betrayed.

00:00:46.588 --> 00:00:51.093
I refused to hope for a miracle
because miracles were a fantasy.

00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:52.553
But I learned.

00:00:52.594 --> 00:00:55.222
Keiichi and Rena
and Mion and Shion,

00:00:55.264 --> 00:00:59.726
and Satoko let me see the
truth, and soon, you'll know!

00:00:59.768 --> 00:01:03.146
Miracles aren't born from
chance but from our own will!

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:22.291
This has grown tiresome.

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:28.046
The entire charade
has become tedious.

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:29.214
Hmph.

00:01:41.518 --> 00:01:44.896
You would cause me to
relapse into my boredom.

00:02:09.588 --> 00:02:11.798
[SATOKO]
Fine, you win.

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:14.301
Don't hesitate.

00:02:14.343 --> 00:02:17.095
Erase me from your world
and be done with it.

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:19.348
Everything would work
out fine for you.

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:20.432
You'll have no
trouble fitting in

00:02:20.474 --> 00:02:24.311
with the well‐bred young ladies
of St. Lucia Academy.

00:02:25.646 --> 00:02:28.065
That doesn't sound bad at all.

00:02:28.106 --> 00:02:29.691
Heh.

00:02:29.733 --> 00:02:31.652
But once you're living
in that world without me,

00:02:31.693 --> 00:02:34.279
you'll realize something.

00:02:34.321 --> 00:02:37.491
That you were always
happiest here in Hinamizawa.

00:02:39.368 --> 00:02:40.494
And that I was the one

00:02:40.535 --> 00:02:43.038
who cared about you
more than anybody!

00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:50.420
How the hell could you
think I don't know that?

00:02:54.675 --> 00:03:00.806
[RIKA] You always cared for
me just like I cared for you.

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:05.560
More... than anybody
for years and years!

00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:07.813
Did you think I'd forgotten?

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:12.901
How could I? You idiot!

00:03:12.943 --> 00:03:13.944
Don't you dare tell me

00:03:13.985 --> 00:03:17.489
I would have a happy life
in a world without you!

00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:19.741
Do you really think
I would erase you?

00:03:19.783 --> 00:03:21.827
I couldn't do it if I tried!

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:24.996
But I'll beat you
till your face is red

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:26.540
and your eyes swell shut!

00:03:26.581 --> 00:03:28.875
I'll stamp all those practice
problems into your brain

00:03:28.917 --> 00:03:30.585
with my fists,
until you can rattle off

00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:33.422
every single formula
from memory!

00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:35.841
[SATOKO screams]

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:37.884
No, no, no, no, no!

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:39.344
I don't want to!

00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:42.639
I'm not studying anymore!

00:03:42.681 --> 00:03:44.182
I hate studying!

00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:46.268
I never wanna see another book!

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:48.687
I don't even wanna
think about them!

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:51.148
I wanna keep
goofing off forever!

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:53.150
Together with you!

00:03:57.612 --> 00:03:58.488
Why won't you stop acting

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.409
like such a stupid,
selfish little monster already?

00:04:02.451 --> 00:04:04.703
Me? When are you
gonna stop trying

00:04:04.745 --> 00:04:07.038
to drag me off
to your dumb school?

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.583
[RIKA]
You're so stupid, Satoko!

00:04:09.624 --> 00:04:11.960
[SATOKO]
Why won't you get it, Rika?

00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:35.358
Oh?

00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:07.265
Hmm?
What are you doing now?

00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:10.352
No miracle will ever
take your side.

00:05:10.393 --> 00:05:12.938
The question I asked
was what you were doing.

00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:19.277
[HANYUU]
If a hundred times,

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:21.279
we plunge into the
depths of despair,

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:23.281
we climb out two hundred.

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:26.201
If the tide of tragedy takes
us a thousand times,

00:05:26.243 --> 00:05:28.995
then two thousand times,
we pull free!

00:05:33.792 --> 00:05:35.794
Because we have faith
that when a miracle comes,

00:05:35.836 --> 00:05:37.712
it will side with us!

00:05:42.217 --> 00:05:43.677
[gasps]

00:05:46.888 --> 00:05:48.473
Huh?!

00:05:48.515 --> 00:05:49.766
We'll defeat fate.

00:05:49.808 --> 00:05:52.686
Rika and I will
reclaim our future!

00:05:52.727 --> 00:05:55.897
We will bring about
the miracle that we need!

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:58.692
[laughs]

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:05.949
How many endless days
did we fight to get here?

00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:23.717
[RIKA]
Me and Rika.

00:06:25.594 --> 00:06:27.888
[RIKA]
And Keiichi and Rena.

00:06:29.347 --> 00:06:31.600
[RIKA]
And Mion and Shion.

00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:35.270
[RIKA]
All the people of Hinamizawa.

00:06:36.563 --> 00:06:37.981
[RIKA]
Satoko, too.

00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:42.068
[RIKA] They're far
stronger than you realize!

00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:48.366
[laughs]

00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:51.244
You've recaptured
my interest, dear failure!

00:06:51.286 --> 00:06:53.955
Such a fine performance
is deserving of a reward!

00:06:53.997 --> 00:06:58.335
[laughs]

00:07:06.551 --> 00:07:09.804
Strike true, Onigari‐no‐Ryuuou!

00:07:09.846 --> 00:07:13.808
And devour her sins,
right down to the last!

00:07:22.317 --> 00:07:24.235
[EUA laughs]

00:07:31.743 --> 00:07:34.537
The unimaginable
impudence of you!

00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:37.749
You swore that you would concede
if I showed you a miracle.

00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:40.043
You will not interfere
with this world again!

00:07:40.085 --> 00:07:41.461
Now, begone!

00:07:41.503 --> 00:07:45.131
[EUA giggles]
Begone I shall.

00:07:45.173 --> 00:07:47.467
You are the failure I knew
you to be, but nonetheless,

00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:50.679
you were miraculously able
to strike back against me!

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.347
[giggles]

00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:59.437
[cackles]

00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:15.787
You never gave a single thought
to following my dream, did you?

00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:17.372
Stay in Hinamizawa.

00:08:17.414 --> 00:08:19.207
We could be together forever!

00:08:19.249 --> 00:08:22.127
I refuse. I won't
give up on my dream!

00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:24.546
We're getting into
St. Lucia together!

00:08:24.587 --> 00:08:26.006
[SATOKO]
Well, I always dreamed of a life

00:08:26.047 --> 00:08:29.968
with you here in Hinamizawa,
and I'm not giving that up!

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:33.388
All I want is to be
with you forever, Satoko!

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:37.142
And all I want is to be
with you forever, Rika!

00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:40.895
I want to take you
with me to St. Lucia!

00:08:40.937 --> 00:08:45.108
I don't want to go,
and I don't wanna let you go!

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:48.361
Satoko!

00:08:48.403 --> 00:08:51.906
Rika!

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.436
Satoko, you with me?

00:09:21.478 --> 00:09:23.021
I'm listening.

00:09:23.063 --> 00:09:28.109
I'm sorry I left you all by
your lonesome at St. Lucia.

00:09:28.151 --> 00:09:29.277
We'll try again.

00:09:29.319 --> 00:09:31.112
I won't let you out of my sight,

00:09:31.154 --> 00:09:35.325
and I can help you study
as much as you need.

00:09:35.366 --> 00:09:37.786
I'm so happy to hear that.

00:09:37.827 --> 00:09:39.954
Apology accepted, Rika.

00:09:39.996 --> 00:09:42.624
I lost count of how many years
it took to get it out of you,

00:09:42.665 --> 00:09:46.419
but in the end, I suppose I can
say it was worth the trouble.

00:09:47.837 --> 00:09:50.048
[SATOKO]
Though I'm sorry to tell you.

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:52.634
I'm honestly just
not smart enough.

00:09:52.675 --> 00:09:55.595
You're never going to get me
to study that hard again,

00:09:55.637 --> 00:09:58.556
no matter how hard you may try.

00:09:58.598 --> 00:09:59.808
[RIKA]
I figured.

00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:01.309
How many years
did I make you study

00:10:01.351 --> 00:10:04.104
for that entrance exam, anyway?

00:10:04.187 --> 00:10:06.022
[SATOKO]
I could hardly guess.

00:10:06.064 --> 00:10:07.482
Think of the biggest
number you can

00:10:07.524 --> 00:10:09.776
and multiply it by three.

00:10:09.818 --> 00:10:12.570
That might be somewhere close.

00:10:12.612 --> 00:10:16.407
[RIKA] Looping lives can develop
something like allergies.

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:17.784
You keep reliving
the same troubles

00:10:17.826 --> 00:10:21.621
till even seeing them makes
you break out in hives.

00:10:21.663 --> 00:10:23.331
[SATOKO] I really did
believe I would be able

00:10:23.373 --> 00:10:24.499
to stay in the main class

00:10:24.541 --> 00:10:27.210
with you if I gave it
my best effort.

00:10:27.252 --> 00:10:29.254
Otherwise,
I couldn't have made myself

00:10:29.295 --> 00:10:32.382
keep trying so hard for so long.

00:10:32.423 --> 00:10:33.842
[RIKA] So you studied
as hard as you could

00:10:33.883 --> 00:10:36.845
and you still got
terrible grades.

00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:40.640
Maybe you really weren't
cut out for that curriculum.

00:10:40.682 --> 00:10:43.184
Goodness, who could
have imagined it.

00:10:56.739 --> 00:10:58.950
[MION]
Hey! They're on the riverbank!

00:10:59.742 --> 00:11:03.246
[RENA]
Keiichi! We finally found them.

00:11:03.288 --> 00:11:05.665
They're over here!

00:11:05.707 --> 00:11:08.459
[KEIICHI] What the heck
have they been doing?

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:11.713
Whoa! Okay,
what's going on, you two?

00:11:11.754 --> 00:11:13.381
What happened to your clothes?

00:11:13.423 --> 00:11:16.426
[MION]
And what happened to your faces?

00:11:16.467 --> 00:11:17.343
Oh my gosh!

00:11:17.385 --> 00:11:19.512
Hey, do we have some
bandages in the car?

00:11:19.554 --> 00:11:20.889
Do we?

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:22.891
While I appreciate your concern

00:11:22.932 --> 00:11:23.725
I can assure you,

00:11:23.766 --> 00:11:26.936
Rika's punches aren't
nearly enough to hurt me.

00:11:26.978 --> 00:11:28.646
They were enough
to make you cry,

00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:30.940
but I suppose we don't
need to talk about that.

00:11:30.982 --> 00:11:31.941
Don't we?

00:11:31.983 --> 00:11:34.110
Your eyes are at
least as red as mine.

00:11:34.152 --> 00:11:35.069
Okay, kids.

00:11:35.111 --> 00:11:36.487
That's enough of that.

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:38.740
What made you get into
a full‐on fist fight?

00:11:38.781 --> 00:11:40.783
That's so not like you.

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.370
‐‐Hmph!
‐‐Hmph!

00:11:56.925 --> 00:11:59.427
[KEIICHI] I'm glad we came
to pick you guys up.

00:11:59.469 --> 00:12:01.596
So, what were you
two fighting about?

00:12:01.638 --> 00:12:04.474
Ol' Uncle Mion is here to help!

00:12:06.434 --> 00:12:10.104
Come on, you can share
these things with your friends.

00:12:10.146 --> 00:12:11.272
They're fine.

00:12:11.314 --> 00:12:12.982
Whatever it is was
between the two of them,

00:12:13.024 --> 00:12:14.943
and I'm sure
they talked it over.

00:12:14.984 --> 00:12:16.569
They don't need to
tell us what it was about

00:12:16.611 --> 00:12:18.279
if they don't want to.

00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:22.533
Jeez. You're way
too good at this, Rena.

00:12:24.786 --> 00:12:26.287
You two okay?

00:12:26.329 --> 00:12:27.789
"Okay" would be a stretch.

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:30.291
It'll be hard to think of
each other as friends, now.

00:12:30.333 --> 00:12:32.252
My thoughts exactly.

00:12:32.877 --> 00:12:34.963
[RENA]
Here's something to consider.

00:12:35.004 --> 00:12:36.130
Even twins don't have to do

00:12:36.172 --> 00:12:39.300
everything together
forever, right?

00:12:39.342 --> 00:12:41.844
But they'll always
remember their time together

00:12:41.886 --> 00:12:44.264
and those memories
will always be precious.

00:12:46.224 --> 00:12:48.059
Even as they go
their separate ways,

00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:50.645
they'll still have that
connection to each other.

00:12:50.687 --> 00:12:52.063
Yeah, that's true.

00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:55.984
Families and friends
grow apart in time, but still,

00:12:56.025 --> 00:13:00.738
that doesn't make those
relationships any less valuable.

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:03.866
[KEIICHI] They're right and
if I could add something.

00:13:03.908 --> 00:13:05.868
When I call someone a friend,

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:08.204
what am I really
saying about them?

00:13:08.246 --> 00:13:09.831
It's not that
we're always together,

00:13:09.872 --> 00:13:13.042
and honestly, it might be hard
to stay friends if we were.

00:13:13.084 --> 00:13:15.545
But whenever we do
see each other again,

00:13:15.586 --> 00:13:17.005
no matter how long it's been,

00:13:17.046 --> 00:13:19.841
or what's happened
since last time,

00:13:19.882 --> 00:13:23.177
we'll both know that we still
share that connection.

00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:26.514
If you ask me, "friendship"
is just a word for that bond.

00:13:26.556 --> 00:13:28.558
That's all.

00:13:28.599 --> 00:13:29.767
But that bond shouldn't mean

00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:32.103
the two of you are
shackled together.

00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:33.229
If you're worried
your friendship

00:13:33.271 --> 00:13:36.482
is gonna fall apart just 'cause
you're not in the same place,

00:13:36.524 --> 00:13:39.444
you might have the wrong
idea about friendship.

00:14:24.364 --> 00:14:25.406
Huh?

00:14:25.448 --> 00:14:27.909
How are you
this morning, Keiichi?

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:30.078
You're still showing up early!

00:14:30.119 --> 00:14:32.497
You're allowed to sleep in
once in a while, you know?

00:14:32.538 --> 00:14:34.582
But I guess you don't
plan on ever doing it.

00:14:34.624 --> 00:14:37.335
I couldn't sleep in. Not today!

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:41.756
Morning, guys! Good to see you!

00:14:41.798 --> 00:14:42.965
And on time, for once!

00:14:43.007 --> 00:14:44.592
I don't think I could've
forgiven myself

00:14:44.634 --> 00:14:47.011
if we'd shown up late
and missed the big event.

00:14:47.053 --> 00:14:47.929
Right?

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:51.349
We have to see our friend off
on her big journey today!

00:15:53.411 --> 00:15:54.996
Give it everything you've got.

00:15:55.037 --> 00:15:56.956
You'll be representing
Hinamizawa.

00:15:56.998 --> 00:15:58.791
So, keep up
that club spirit, okay!

00:15:58.833 --> 00:16:01.169
You can do anything you
set your mind to.

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:05.173
That's coming from the first and
second presidents of the club!

00:16:05.214 --> 00:16:06.382
Awooo!

00:16:06.424 --> 00:16:08.676
You're so cute in
that St. Lucia uniform

00:16:08.718 --> 00:16:10.094
I can barely stand it!

00:16:10.136 --> 00:16:12.263
I wanna take you home with me!

00:16:12.305 --> 00:16:16.767
Mii. But then
I couldn't catch my train.

00:16:20.146 --> 00:16:23.649
[PA] Thank you for choosing the
Shinkansen for your trip today.

00:16:23.691 --> 00:16:25.776
The 12:52 Hikari bound for Tokyo

00:16:25.818 --> 00:16:28.779
is arriving on
track number 15.

00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:32.783
Please stand behind the yellow
line until boarding commences.

00:16:32.825 --> 00:16:34.368
We appreciate your cooperation.

00:16:40.374 --> 00:16:41.334
Well, this is it.

00:16:41.375 --> 00:16:43.419
Goodbye for now, everyone.

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:50.426
Jeez! Where the heck
were you, Satoko?

00:16:50.468 --> 00:16:52.178
She'll gonna be gone
for three years, you know.

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:55.556
Or, I mean, however
long she takes to graduate.

00:16:57.183 --> 00:16:58.267
Hey, let go!

00:16:58.309 --> 00:17:02.647
Shion asked me to pass on
a message before she leaves!

00:17:02.688 --> 00:17:03.523
[KEIICHI]
Enough.

00:17:03.564 --> 00:17:05.066
[RENA]
Let them say their goodbyes!

00:17:05.107 --> 00:17:06.108
[MION]
But you guys!

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:07.902
[RENA]
Let's go, Mion.

00:17:07.944 --> 00:17:09.529
So, this is goodbye.

00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:12.657
I hope you enjoy it, living
life all by your lonesome.

00:17:12.698 --> 00:17:14.075
All by my lonesome?

00:17:14.116 --> 00:17:16.619
What about the well‐bred
young ladies you mentioned?

00:17:16.661 --> 00:17:18.538
You said I'd fit right in.

00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:20.164
Oh, you'll be
everyone's favorite

00:17:20.206 --> 00:17:21.916
from the moment
you set foot on campus,

00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:23.960
and I couldn't be
happier for you.

00:17:24.001 --> 00:17:28.130
Thank you, however, it won't be
the same as having you there.

00:17:28.172 --> 00:17:32.969
I know, and it won't be
the same without you here.

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:36.305
In this universe, we alone
lead eternal existences,

00:17:36.347 --> 00:17:39.308
living in endless loops.

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:42.895
We'll live forever but forever
is too long to be together,

00:17:42.937 --> 00:17:45.022
so we have to spend time apart.

00:17:45.064 --> 00:17:47.525
To keep us from growing
sick of one another.

00:17:47.567 --> 00:17:50.987
To make sure that the bonds
of our friendship will endure.

00:17:51.028 --> 00:17:52.280
[SATOKO]
But if that time apart

00:17:52.321 --> 00:17:54.407
should go on too
long for my liking,

00:17:54.448 --> 00:17:57.118
I'm always going
to come after you.

00:17:57.159 --> 00:17:59.870
If you come after me,
I'm going to run away.

00:17:59.912 --> 00:18:02.873
And whenever you stop running,
I will be there.

00:18:02.915 --> 00:18:05.835
[RIKA]
If you go north, I'll go south.

00:18:05.876 --> 00:18:09.088
If you go east, I'll go west.

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:10.256
[RIKA]
And we'll meet again.

00:18:10.298 --> 00:18:12.550
[SATOKO]
Sooner than we think.

00:18:16.679 --> 00:18:19.599
We'll meet when
something else cries.

00:18:58.346 --> 00:19:00.056
Is that...?

00:19:10.399 --> 00:19:12.693
Well, ladies. Have a good year.

00:20:13.796 --> 00:20:17.967
Huh? It's good to see you
two made your way back!

00:20:41.073 --> 00:20:45.828
[SATOSHI]
What? Where am I? Satoko?

00:21:02.511 --> 00:21:04.221
[TEPPEI]
Hey! Satoko!

00:21:04.263 --> 00:21:05.639
Huh?

00:21:12.396 --> 00:21:13.647
Check it out, kiddo!

00:21:13.689 --> 00:21:15.524
They had a killer deal
goin' on this meat,

00:21:15.566 --> 00:21:17.318
so I got us all loaded up!

00:21:17.359 --> 00:21:18.569
Why so much?

00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:20.362
[TEPPEI] 'Cause I needed
enough meat to balance out

00:21:20.404 --> 00:21:23.407
all the veggies I picked up
on sale, you know?

00:21:23.449 --> 00:21:24.950
I figured you and I
could have ourselves

00:21:24.992 --> 00:21:27.203
a <i>sukiyaki</i> party tonight!

00:21:27.244 --> 00:21:28.496
[sighs]

00:21:28.537 --> 00:21:30.706
Well, I'm not in much of
a mood to celebrate right‐‐

00:21:30.748 --> 00:21:33.542
Hi! Your Nee‐nee
is here to see you!

00:21:33.584 --> 00:21:35.002
Shion, that's not "seeing."

00:21:35.044 --> 00:21:39.089
I was so hoping to see little
miss Rika off at the station.

00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:42.551
How could mean old Uncle Yoshiro
make me work that shift?

00:21:42.593 --> 00:21:44.804
Why, hello there, Uncle Teppei.

00:21:44.845 --> 00:21:47.890
Surely you didn't buy all this
food just for the two of you?

00:21:47.932 --> 00:21:49.600
[laughs]

00:21:49.642 --> 00:21:52.019
We'd be happy to have
you come help us out!

00:21:53.312 --> 00:21:56.357
This simply isn't for me.

00:21:56.398 --> 00:22:00.236
I'll be coming after you
sooner than I thought, Rika.

00:22:10.913 --> 00:22:13.749
You can come back now,
Satoko Hojo.

00:22:13.791 --> 00:22:16.377
I'll return yourself to you.

00:22:26.262 --> 00:22:27.555
What's that about?

00:22:27.596 --> 00:22:31.350
Oh, my, I do hope
you're feeling okay.

00:22:34.854 --> 00:22:36.981
[chortles]

00:22:37.022 --> 00:22:38.899
I've never felt better!

00:22:38.941 --> 00:22:42.319
And actually, I think a <i>sukiyaki</i>
party is just what I need!

00:22:42.361 --> 00:22:43.153
Though I'll warn you,

00:22:43.195 --> 00:22:44.154
I can get to the good bits

00:22:44.196 --> 00:22:46.323
before you've got a
grip on your chopsticks.

00:22:46.365 --> 00:22:48.742
We'll have way too many
good bits for that!

00:22:48.784 --> 00:22:51.120
What'd ya think I bought
all this meat for, anyway?

00:22:51.161 --> 00:22:52.037
I see.

00:22:52.079 --> 00:22:54.540
You figured out an effective
counterplay, Uncle!

00:22:54.582 --> 00:22:56.166
[laughs]

00:22:56.208 --> 00:22:58.502
What can I say, kid,
ya trained me good!

00:22:58.544 --> 00:23:01.171
Your uncle's gotten to be
a master bargain hunter!

00:23:01.213 --> 00:23:03.716
But that still won't
be nearly enough people.

00:23:03.757 --> 00:23:06.135
Why don't we invite
Kei and Rena, as well?

00:23:06.176 --> 00:23:10.890
And obviously,
I could call my sister.

00:23:10.931 --> 00:23:12.808
You could hardly
have better timing.

00:23:16.437 --> 00:23:19.523
Hey, Keiichi! Mion! Rena!

00:23:19.565 --> 00:23:21.734
Over here, guys!

00:23:24.445 --> 00:23:26.155
[MION]
Damn, that's a lot of food!
