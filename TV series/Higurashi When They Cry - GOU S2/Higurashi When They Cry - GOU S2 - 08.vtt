WEBVTT

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:24.650
[RIKA]
You don't have to do this.

00:00:27.778 --> 00:00:30.155
Please, Satoko, no one would
expect you to go back

00:00:30.197 --> 00:00:32.908
to living with
a cruel man like him.

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:35.369
[SATOKO]
My uncle and I are family,

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.704
so of course we're
expected to live together.

00:00:37.746 --> 00:00:39.998
It's a perfectly
ordinary arrangement.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.583
[RIKA]
No, it's not!

00:00:41.625 --> 00:00:42.709
You know I'm right.

00:00:42.751 --> 00:00:45.546
He and your aunt were
so awful to the two of you.

00:00:45.587 --> 00:00:48.757
Somebody who treats you
like that isn't family!

00:00:55.305 --> 00:00:57.975
Stay here with me.

00:00:58.016 --> 00:01:00.310
I'm afraid staying
isn't an option.

00:01:00.352 --> 00:01:02.854
He's going to destroy my
Nii‐Nii's room if I don't go,

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:05.315
and I can't let that happen.

00:01:05.357 --> 00:01:06.149
Please, Rika.

00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:08.944
Trying to stop me will
only make this harder.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.203
[RIKA]
Satoko!

00:01:19.997 --> 00:01:22.541
We can still walk to school
together, can't we?

00:01:22.583 --> 00:01:24.293
Like always?

00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:26.003
[SATOKO]
Yes.

00:01:26.044 --> 00:01:26.962
Of course.

00:01:27.004 --> 00:01:30.048
I'll meet you at the bottom
of the stone steps, okay?

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.144
[VILLAGE ELDER] Real sorry for
bothering you so late, Mion.

00:01:42.185 --> 00:01:44.605
Oh, no worries, it's fine.

00:01:44.646 --> 00:01:46.607
You should come back
tomorrow morning, though.

00:01:46.648 --> 00:01:48.442
The old lady is
sleeping like the dead,

00:01:48.483 --> 00:01:49.860
and I'm afraid to wake her.

00:01:49.901 --> 00:01:51.069
[laughs]

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:54.531
I get it, but even so...

00:01:54.573 --> 00:01:56.199
Is it something serious?

00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:57.659
There's this rumor
that's been going

00:01:57.701 --> 00:01:59.703
around the village, ya see.

00:01:59.745 --> 00:02:02.289
How 'bout I go ahead
and tell you what I heard,

00:02:02.331 --> 00:02:05.125
and you decide whether
or not to pass it on?

00:02:05.167 --> 00:02:06.627
[MION]
All right, then, let's hear it.

00:02:06.668 --> 00:02:08.503
Well, I figure
at least you should know

00:02:08.545 --> 00:02:11.340
since it involves the Hojo girl.

00:02:11.381 --> 00:02:13.884
Her uncle was spotted
at his house in the village.

00:02:13.925 --> 00:02:16.803
Seems old Teppei is back.

00:02:16.845 --> 00:02:18.055
Are you sure?

00:02:18.096 --> 00:02:19.056
Yeah.

00:02:19.097 --> 00:02:21.850
The man who saw him got
a good look and an earful.

00:02:21.892 --> 00:02:25.270
He was yellin'
and cursin' like usual.

00:02:25.312 --> 00:02:27.230
[sighs]

00:02:27.272 --> 00:02:29.441
Anyway, that's why I came.

00:02:29.483 --> 00:02:32.319
Tell Lady Oryo if
you think she should know.

00:02:34.196 --> 00:02:35.781
[MION]
Satoko.

00:04:19.885 --> 00:04:21.344
[SATOKO]
I'm heading out now.

00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:23.388
[TEPPEI]
By yourself?

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.890
You absolutely sure
you don't want me

00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:26.725
to go with ya, keep ya company?

00:04:26.767 --> 00:04:28.185
I'm only walking to school.

00:04:28.226 --> 00:04:30.103
There's no need
to make it a procession.

00:04:30.145 --> 00:04:32.898
[TEPPEI] But you said the
whole village is out to get ya.

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:34.357
What's to stop
those lousy bullies

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:35.859
from goin' after you on the way

00:04:35.901 --> 00:04:37.778
or even once ya get there?

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:39.780
[SATOKO]
Thank you for worrying about me.

00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:41.448
Knowing you're on my side
gives me the strength

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.034
to continue in spite
of all I'm up against.

00:04:44.075 --> 00:04:44.868
[TEPPEI]
Hm...

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.913
Isn't there anything I can do
to make things easier on you?

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:50.457
You're already
doing it by being here.

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:52.334
No matter what horrible
things might happen

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:53.376
when I walk out the door,

00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:55.837
I'll always know
I can come home to family

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:57.130
and that alone means more to me

00:04:57.172 --> 00:04:59.007
than I could possibly express.

00:04:59.049 --> 00:05:02.969
Yeah? You sure?

00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:04.179
It'll be fine, Uncle.

00:05:04.221 --> 00:05:05.472
You'll see.

00:05:06.223 --> 00:05:08.016
[sighs]

00:05:08.058 --> 00:05:09.684
[RENA]
Hey, Mii!

00:05:09.726 --> 00:05:10.894
Sorry we're late!

00:05:10.936 --> 00:05:12.395
Yeah, good morning, Mion!

00:05:12.437 --> 00:05:13.939
[MION]
Really, you guys?

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.566
I was this close
to ditching you.

00:05:16.608 --> 00:05:19.611
Yeah, well, we'll still
make it in time if we run.

00:05:19.653 --> 00:05:22.113
A morning run wasn't
in my plans today.

00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:23.990
So, what was the hold up?

00:05:24.032 --> 00:05:26.827
Keiichi here overslept
because of his dreams.

00:05:26.868 --> 00:05:31.081
Apparently, they were
about Satoko! Awooo!

00:05:31.122 --> 00:05:31.915
Hey, stop!

00:05:31.957 --> 00:05:34.835
You're gonna make her
think it was something creepy.

00:05:36.253 --> 00:05:37.379
[KEIICHI]
You okay?

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:38.505
Huh?

00:05:38.547 --> 00:05:40.215
Uh, yeah,
just surprised to find out

00:05:40.257 --> 00:05:43.093
you're that smitten with
our resident trap specialist.

00:05:43.134 --> 00:05:44.803
It isn't like that, though.

00:05:44.845 --> 00:05:47.848
Now come on, We really do need
to run, or we're gonna be late!

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:50.267
[RENA giggles]
Coming!

00:06:02.237 --> 00:06:03.405
We'd better hurry.

00:06:03.446 --> 00:06:07.033
I'm worried that
we won't make it on time.

00:06:07.075 --> 00:06:08.869
[SATOKO]
Sorry.

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:09.703
But it doesn't look like

00:06:09.744 --> 00:06:12.414
I'll be able to walk
with you after all.

00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:13.498
Why not?

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.501
There are a few errands
that I need to run for my uncle.

00:06:16.543 --> 00:06:17.544
What errands?

00:06:17.586 --> 00:06:19.713
Surely, they can wait
till after school.

00:06:19.754 --> 00:06:21.923
It'll be better
if I do them now.

00:06:21.965 --> 00:06:22.757
Don't worry.

00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:23.884
It shouldn't take long.

00:06:23.925 --> 00:06:27.470
And this way,
he won't get so angry.

00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:28.388
[RIKA]
Please, Satoko.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.140
Just put them off.

00:06:30.181 --> 00:06:31.766
Come to school with me,
and then we can take care

00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:34.436
of them together
later this afternoon.

00:06:34.477 --> 00:06:36.646
I have to do what
my uncle tells me to.

00:06:36.688 --> 00:06:38.023
You don't, though!

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:41.401
Please accept my decision
and go on ahead without me.

00:06:41.443 --> 00:06:46.031
I only came because
I wanted to tell you in person.

00:06:46.072 --> 00:06:47.115
I'll see you at school.

00:06:47.157 --> 00:06:49.784
Sorry again that
I can't walk with you.

00:06:49.826 --> 00:06:51.077
Bye.

00:07:09.512 --> 00:07:14.392
[CHIE] Ms. Furude, you're
late and where is Ms. Hojo?

00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:17.187
[KEIICHI]
Rika?

00:07:17.228 --> 00:07:18.480
I'm sorry, ma'am.

00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:21.691
Satoko might come
in a bit late today

00:07:21.733 --> 00:07:24.152
[CHIE]
I see.

00:07:32.243 --> 00:07:33.370
Hey, Rika.

00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:36.456
You think Satoko is gonna make
it in time to eat with us?

00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:40.043
If Rika's not
comfortable telling us,

00:07:40.085 --> 00:07:41.461
we'll just have to wait.

00:07:41.503 --> 00:07:42.420
For all we know,

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:44.506
we might be
worrying over nothing.

00:07:44.547 --> 00:07:47.092
Uh, Mion, why does it seem like

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:49.469
you know something
about all this?

00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:50.804
How's that?

00:07:50.845 --> 00:07:54.975
You've been acting
sketchy all morning.

00:07:55.016 --> 00:07:58.311
I heard something
from a council member.

00:07:58.353 --> 00:08:00.271
Something that got me worried.

00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:01.523
What was it?

00:08:01.564 --> 00:08:04.234
We haven't told you
about Satoko's uncle.

00:08:04.275 --> 00:08:07.070
You mean, that freakin' bastard
who beat her up and starved her?

00:08:07.112 --> 00:08:08.780
Oh, wow.

00:08:08.822 --> 00:08:10.782
Guess you heard
it somewhere else.

00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:31.052
[MION]
His name is Teppei Hojo

00:08:31.094 --> 00:08:35.098
and apparently, he turned up
again in Hinamizawa recently.

00:08:40.395 --> 00:08:42.480
[KEIICHI]
Satoko!

00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:44.691
[SATOKO]
What is it, Keiichi?

00:08:44.733 --> 00:08:46.151
Everybody's been worried sick!

00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:48.528
Why did you get here
halfway through lunchtime?

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:53.742
Heh heh. What a silly
thing to worry about.

00:08:53.783 --> 00:08:55.827
Hey, Satoko?

00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:57.495
You okay?

00:08:57.537 --> 00:09:00.290
I'm sorry if I caused you
any concern.

00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:02.375
My uncle just needed me
to run a few errands for him

00:09:02.417 --> 00:09:03.460
before I came in.

00:09:03.501 --> 00:09:04.794
On a school day?

00:09:04.836 --> 00:09:06.546
He should do it for himself!

00:09:06.588 --> 00:09:07.714
I'd really rather eat lunch

00:09:07.756 --> 00:09:09.924
than talk about this,
if we could.

00:09:09.966 --> 00:09:12.302
I'm feeling quite
peckish at the moment.

00:09:14.804 --> 00:09:16.222
Satoko.

00:09:24.814 --> 00:09:25.774
[KEIICHI]
Hey.

00:09:25.815 --> 00:09:27.358
We're friends, right?

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.526
On the same team?

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:29.819
[MION, RENA]
Mm.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:35.533
Rika, can you please
tell us what's going on?

00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:36.868
Mii.

00:09:47.378 --> 00:09:48.338
[KEIICHI]
Dammit!

00:09:48.379 --> 00:09:50.381
If we know that
he's abusing her,

00:09:50.423 --> 00:09:52.300
isn't there somebody
who we can tell?

00:09:52.342 --> 00:09:53.593
Yeah, that's right!

00:09:53.635 --> 00:09:55.303
If we just bring
proof to the police.

00:09:55.345 --> 00:09:57.138
We reported it before.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.808
Last year,
I went to Child Welfare.

00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:02.352
So, what did they do about it?

00:10:02.393 --> 00:10:05.230
[MION] They sent out a social
worker to check on things.

00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:09.109
Then, they interviewed
Satoko and Satoshi

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:10.902
and then their aunt and uncle.

00:10:10.944 --> 00:10:12.987
Why would they
interview the adults?

00:10:13.029 --> 00:10:14.280
Well, they can
hardly make a decision

00:10:14.322 --> 00:10:17.158
without getting both sides
of the story first,

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.701
just wouldn't be fair.

00:10:18.743 --> 00:10:20.703
And what did
they say in the end?

00:10:20.745 --> 00:10:21.788
"We'll stand by."

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:23.748
Stand by for what?

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:27.168
Their beatings hadn't left
any visible marks or bruises.

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:30.505
Not like they could
get 'em on video, either

00:10:30.547 --> 00:10:34.092
and no witnesses,
since it all happened at home.

00:10:43.685 --> 00:10:47.188
[giggles]

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:53.570
[laughs]

00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:54.904
Then what happened?

00:10:54.946 --> 00:10:56.656
[MION]
You can guess.

00:10:56.698 --> 00:10:59.492
The abuse only got
worse for both of them.

00:10:59.534 --> 00:11:01.494
The authorities
couldn't fix things.

00:11:06.374 --> 00:11:07.500
There has to be
something we can do

00:11:07.542 --> 00:11:11.588
to help Satoko, right?

00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:13.173
Mii.

00:11:23.433 --> 00:11:27.437
[giggles]

00:11:30.023 --> 00:11:32.192
Uh?! What happened to you?!

00:11:32.233 --> 00:11:33.902
I'm quite all right, Uncle.

00:11:33.943 --> 00:11:36.029
I just took a
little tumble, that's all.

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:37.864
I don't know what rat
bastard did this to you,

00:11:37.906 --> 00:11:39.282
but there'll be nothin'
but pieces left

00:11:39.324 --> 00:11:41.075
when I'm done with 'em!

00:11:41.951 --> 00:11:43.286
No, please, calm down!

00:11:43.328 --> 00:11:45.914
[TEPPEI] Just you wait, Satoko,
that asshole's gonna be bruised

00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:47.582
and bleeding and wishing
I'd been nice enough

00:11:47.624 --> 00:11:48.750
to go ahead and kill 'em!

00:11:48.791 --> 00:11:51.544
They'll never pull this kinda
bullshit ever again, I swear it!

00:11:51.586 --> 00:11:52.545
I'm fine, Uncle.

00:11:52.587 --> 00:11:53.630
Really, I am.

00:11:53.671 --> 00:11:55.924
A little mud is nothing
to get so upset over.

00:11:55.965 --> 00:11:57.967
[TEPPEI] Move it,
I've got a beating to hand out!

00:11:58.009 --> 00:12:00.720
Please, if you retaliate,
it will only make things worse.

00:12:00.762 --> 00:12:02.013
Stop this!

00:12:02.055 --> 00:12:03.389
I can't let you go.

00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:04.933
If I do that,
then I'll lose this home

00:12:04.974 --> 00:12:06.976
and my family all over again!

00:12:07.894 --> 00:12:09.187
Don't leave me.

00:12:09.229 --> 00:12:11.314
I can't bear the
thought of being alone.

00:12:11.356 --> 00:12:12.732
[TEPPEI]
Uh...

00:12:12.774 --> 00:12:19.322
But they hurt you and I can't...

00:12:19.364 --> 00:12:20.490
It's okay.

00:12:20.531 --> 00:12:23.034
Everything is going
to be all right.

00:12:23.076 --> 00:12:23.952
I'm safe.

00:12:23.993 --> 00:12:24.953
And I'll stay that way,

00:12:24.994 --> 00:12:27.622
here in this house
with my family.

00:12:27.664 --> 00:12:29.791
[TEPPEI]
Sorry I lost it.

00:12:29.832 --> 00:12:32.418
I can forget all the pain
I've had to endure

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:35.713
and live a nice,
peaceful life with you.

00:12:37.966 --> 00:12:40.009
That's all I want,
and if I can have it,

00:12:40.051 --> 00:12:43.054
I believe I'll be
truly happy at last.

00:12:43.096 --> 00:12:48.851
[TEPPEI sobs]

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:26.889
Good to see all
of you this morning.

00:13:28.266 --> 00:13:30.351
Ms. Furude.

00:13:30.393 --> 00:13:33.396
Has Ms. Hojo come
along with you today?

00:13:37.275 --> 00:13:40.945
Please study while
I step out, okay?

00:13:40.987 --> 00:13:42.822
A moment, Ms. Furude?

00:13:44.699 --> 00:13:46.617
[CHIE]
Ms. Hojo's uncle.

00:13:46.659 --> 00:13:49.287
Is the rumor true?

00:13:49.329 --> 00:13:51.831
Then I know what's happening.

00:13:51.873 --> 00:13:52.749
What now?

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:53.791
Huh?

00:13:53.833 --> 00:13:55.084
If you know about
what's happening,

00:13:55.126 --> 00:13:57.378
then what are you
going to do about it?

00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:59.630
Uh.

00:13:59.672 --> 00:14:01.758
I can go visit her at her house,

00:14:01.799 --> 00:14:04.260
and if I notice
anything wrong...

00:14:04.302 --> 00:14:07.055
Then you'll report it
to Child Welfare, right?

00:14:07.096 --> 00:14:10.266
They won't do anything
unless there's proof of abuse.

00:14:10.308 --> 00:14:11.726
[CHIE]
You three!

00:14:11.768 --> 00:14:13.895
You should all be in study hall!

00:14:13.936 --> 00:14:15.605
[KEIICHI]
To hell with study hall, ma'am!

00:14:15.646 --> 00:14:18.191
Satoko's in trouble,
and she needs help!

00:14:18.232 --> 00:14:19.942
I understand your frustration,

00:14:19.984 --> 00:14:22.153
but until I've seen
her living situation,

00:14:22.195 --> 00:14:24.322
I can't make
a report in good faith!

00:14:24.364 --> 00:14:26.532
She's right. I think it's best

00:14:26.574 --> 00:14:29.660
if we let Ms. Chie
handle things for right now.

00:14:29.702 --> 00:14:31.329
[RIKA]
I agree.

00:14:31.371 --> 00:14:33.706
I think it's best if
we listen to Rena.

00:14:33.748 --> 00:14:37.126
Uh... All right, if that's
fine with you, Rika.

00:14:37.168 --> 00:14:38.044
[CHIE]
Class Rep.

00:14:38.086 --> 00:14:41.005
Please escort them back.

00:14:41.047 --> 00:14:42.924
Let's go then.

00:15:00.566 --> 00:15:01.859
[TEPPEI]
Huh?

00:15:01.901 --> 00:15:04.445
Don't you think
you should be lyin' down?

00:15:04.487 --> 00:15:05.696
[SATOKO]
I'm all right now.

00:15:05.738 --> 00:15:10.410
I felt a bit feverish
this morning, but it passed.

00:15:10.451 --> 00:15:14.122
[TEPPEI] Let's check,
where'd that thermometer get to?

00:15:14.163 --> 00:15:16.290
[SATOKO]
I told you, my fever's gone.

00:15:16.332 --> 00:15:17.708
I'll take your word for it,

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.460
and I guess if you're still
feeling all right tomorrow,

00:15:19.502 --> 00:15:21.003
you can go back to school.

00:15:21.045 --> 00:15:22.046
Don't worry, 'cause you'll have

00:15:22.088 --> 00:15:24.507
your own personal bodyguard
walkin' with you both ways.

00:15:24.549 --> 00:15:25.633
[SATOKO]
I don't want to go.

00:15:25.675 --> 00:15:26.884
Huh?

00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:28.553
[SATOKO]
I don't want to go to school.

00:15:28.594 --> 00:15:30.721
[TEPPEI]
Uh... Hold on now.

00:15:30.763 --> 00:15:32.640
I know you've had some
trouble with the villagers,

00:15:32.682 --> 00:15:35.726
but are you sayin' even
your classmates are in on it?

00:15:35.768 --> 00:15:37.353
[SATOKO]
Why wouldn't they be?

00:15:37.395 --> 00:15:40.356
Everyone in my class is
from Hinamizawa, you know.

00:15:40.398 --> 00:15:42.066
And your teacher
ain't doin' anything?

00:15:42.108 --> 00:15:42.900
She's just sittin' back

00:15:42.942 --> 00:15:44.777
and letting 'em
make you miserable?

00:15:44.819 --> 00:15:46.904
[SATOKO]
I wish that was the case.

00:15:46.946 --> 00:15:49.574
That would be far better.

00:15:49.615 --> 00:15:52.410
Your freakin' teacher's
been bullying you, too?

00:15:52.452 --> 00:15:54.078
[knock, knock]

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:57.957
[CHIE]
Hello, Mr. Hojo? Are you home?

00:16:04.213 --> 00:16:05.923
[TEPPEI]
Who the hell are you?

00:16:05.965 --> 00:16:08.468
Hello, sir, you
must be Satoko's uncle.

00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:09.594
My name is Chie,

00:16:09.635 --> 00:16:12.472
and I'm visiting on behalf
of the Hinamizawa school.

00:16:12.513 --> 00:16:13.723
You her teacher?

00:16:13.764 --> 00:16:16.309
[CHIE] Could I please speak
with Satoko for a bit?

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:17.393
Huh?

00:16:17.435 --> 00:16:20.271
You ain't at school; what
the hell's there to talk about?

00:16:20.313 --> 00:16:22.190
[CHIE] Satoko never
came to class today,

00:16:22.231 --> 00:16:26.110
and nobody from her household
called to report her absence.

00:16:26.152 --> 00:16:28.946
[TEPPEI] Oh yeah, she seems to
have come down with somethin',

00:16:28.988 --> 00:16:31.908
full blown fever,
feelin' like shit all day.

00:16:31.949 --> 00:16:33.159
I see.

00:16:33.201 --> 00:16:35.369
Will she be able
to come in tomorrow?

00:16:35.411 --> 00:16:36.871
Like I would know!

00:16:36.913 --> 00:16:39.957
You think I can see the
future or somethin', bitch?

00:16:44.337 --> 00:16:46.797
Huh? Satoko. It's okay.

00:16:46.839 --> 00:16:49.175
I told that woman off;
she's gone now.

00:16:49.217 --> 00:16:50.968
[SATOKO]
Thank you for doing that.

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:54.180
But I'm worried
it won't be enough.

00:16:54.222 --> 00:16:56.933
Who knows what
they'll do to me next?

00:16:56.974 --> 00:16:59.227
Ha! If they band
together against ya,

00:16:59.268 --> 00:17:00.978
I'll fight 'em off,
every last one!

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:03.940
You've got somebody lookin'
out for you now, kiddo.

00:17:03.981 --> 00:17:06.192
[SATOKO] I knew you
would protect me, Uncle.

00:17:06.234 --> 00:17:08.152
[TEPPEI chuckles]

00:17:16.244 --> 00:17:17.245
So, what happened?

00:17:17.286 --> 00:17:19.705
[CHIE] You were waiting
here for me all this time?

00:17:19.747 --> 00:17:20.540
Did she look hurt?

00:17:20.581 --> 00:17:22.208
Was she doing okay?

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:23.668
[CHIE]
I don't know.

00:17:23.709 --> 00:17:26.003
I didn't get a chance
to talk to her.

00:17:26.045 --> 00:17:28.172
[KEIICHI] But at least
we know what's happening.

00:17:28.214 --> 00:17:30.466
Satoko's bastard uncle is
keeping her locked up

00:17:30.508 --> 00:17:31.759
in her house!

00:17:31.801 --> 00:17:32.760
[RENA]
Yeah.

00:17:32.802 --> 00:17:34.178
I think it should be enough.

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:36.722
I'll make the call to
Child Welfare Services.

00:17:36.764 --> 00:17:37.890
If I tell them what we know,

00:17:37.932 --> 00:17:40.351
I'm sure they'll be able
to help somehow.

00:17:40.393 --> 00:17:42.311
They didn't back when I called

00:17:42.353 --> 00:17:45.565
but if a teacher was calling it,
it might get their attention.

00:17:49.193 --> 00:17:52.655
[phone rings]

00:17:52.697 --> 00:17:53.698
[TEPPEI]
Yeah?

00:17:54.865 --> 00:17:57.952
What? Child Welfare?

00:17:57.994 --> 00:17:59.704
The hell are you talking about?

00:17:59.745 --> 00:18:02.582
I've got nothing to do
with that, moron.

00:18:02.623 --> 00:18:04.584
Huh? A welfare check?

00:18:04.625 --> 00:18:06.460
I don't give a damn!

00:18:07.336 --> 00:18:10.298
It might be easier
if I talk to them, Uncle.

00:18:10.339 --> 00:18:11.507
You don't need to do that.

00:18:11.549 --> 00:18:14.468
I can handle whatever
this is about... Um... Okay...

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:15.678
[SATOKO]
Hello?

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.305
Apologies for the ruckus.

00:18:17.346 --> 00:18:20.349
This is Satoko speaking.

00:18:20.391 --> 00:18:21.601
I assume there
are some questions

00:18:21.642 --> 00:18:23.352
you would like to ask me.

00:18:23.394 --> 00:18:25.730
Of course,
I have nothing to hide.

00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:27.898
I am only too happy to answer.

00:18:32.236 --> 00:18:35.323
I convinced them that it
was all a big misunderstanding.

00:18:35.364 --> 00:18:38.659
I don't see why CWS would
call us in the first place.

00:18:38.701 --> 00:18:40.244
I'm afraid I do.

00:18:40.286 --> 00:18:41.996
This is clearly
the village's latest volley

00:18:42.038 --> 00:18:44.040
in their campaign
to persecute me.

00:18:44.081 --> 00:18:46.667
What? Filin' a false report?

00:18:46.709 --> 00:18:48.586
[SATOKO]
It's an especially cruel tactic.

00:18:48.628 --> 00:18:49.587
Huh?

00:18:49.629 --> 00:18:50.963
If Child Welfare Services

00:18:51.005 --> 00:18:52.882
believes there's
a problem at home,

00:18:52.923 --> 00:18:54.800
they have the power
to tear us apart.

00:18:54.842 --> 00:18:55.801
What the hell!

00:18:55.843 --> 00:18:58.054
It can't be legal for them
to do somethin' like that.

00:18:58.095 --> 00:18:58.888
[SATOKO]
If we're lucky,

00:18:58.929 --> 00:19:02.475
the villagers will give up
telling such despicable lies.

00:19:02.516 --> 00:19:04.769
Still we must take
care not to give them

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:06.604
a real reason to separate us.

00:19:06.646 --> 00:19:09.148
I imagine we'll
be under scrutiny.

00:19:23.412 --> 00:19:25.081
Good morning, Rika.

00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:29.293
I'm so glad to see you.

00:19:29.335 --> 00:19:30.961
I wasn't sure if you'd make it.

00:19:31.003 --> 00:19:33.005
[SATOKO]
Since I did, shall we be off?

00:19:33.047 --> 00:19:35.007
Yes, of course!

00:19:36.008 --> 00:19:38.469
So, you're doing okay now?

00:19:38.511 --> 00:19:39.345
[SATOKO]
Yes.

00:19:39.387 --> 00:19:40.846
I was feeling
quite poorly for a bit,

00:19:40.888 --> 00:19:43.891
but that pesky cold seems
to have cleared up completely.

00:19:43.933 --> 00:19:46.602
[RIKA]
That's not what I meant.

00:19:46.644 --> 00:19:47.853
You should've gotten a call

00:19:47.895 --> 00:19:50.356
from someone at
Child Welfare Services.

00:19:50.398 --> 00:19:52.441
[SATOKO]
Yes, that's been resolved.

00:19:52.483 --> 00:19:53.526
I simply explained to them

00:19:53.567 --> 00:19:56.445
that they were misinformed
about my current situation.

00:20:00.491 --> 00:20:03.244
[KEIICHI]
"Standing by"? What the hell?

00:20:03.285 --> 00:20:05.246
[MION] Satoko's house
received a phone call

00:20:05.287 --> 00:20:08.457
from Child Welfare Services
and that was it.

00:20:08.499 --> 00:20:10.084
So, he feeds 'em some bullcrap

00:20:10.126 --> 00:20:12.086
and they decide
to stay on standby?

00:20:12.128 --> 00:20:15.673
[SATOKO] Surely there's
no need to be so loud, is there?

00:20:15.715 --> 00:20:16.632
[KEIICHI]
Satoko?

00:20:16.674 --> 00:20:18.968
Yes. Now, would you
please quiet down?

00:20:19.009 --> 00:20:22.596
[RENA]
Satoko! Is everything okay?

00:20:22.638 --> 00:20:27.435
[EUA laughs]

00:20:27.476 --> 00:20:29.311
How very sad.

00:20:29.353 --> 00:20:31.731
It would seem that
the human Satoko Hojo

00:20:31.772 --> 00:20:34.483
can no longer find joy
in the conventional manner.

00:20:34.525 --> 00:20:35.860
Her only happiness now comes

00:20:35.901 --> 00:20:39.530
from wallowing in her own
despair and the pity of others.

00:20:39.572 --> 00:20:41.323
She moves pieces
around the board

00:20:41.365 --> 00:20:43.284
and toys with the
hearts of her pawns

00:20:43.325 --> 00:20:45.995
in blind pursuit of
that dubious pleasure.

00:20:46.036 --> 00:20:47.955
[KEIICHI]
Jeez, you brat.

00:20:47.997 --> 00:20:49.415
[SATOKO gasps]

00:20:51.959 --> 00:20:54.128
Hey, are you okay, Satoko?

00:20:55.588 --> 00:20:57.423
Satoko, what's wrong?

00:20:59.925 --> 00:21:01.302
[EUA chuckles]

00:21:01.343 --> 00:21:05.473
Indeed, she is a human being
no more, but rather a witch.

00:21:11.896 --> 00:21:13.814
[MION]
Satoko!

00:21:13.856 --> 00:21:15.733
[KEIICHI]
Whoa, Satoko, what is it?

00:21:15.775 --> 00:21:17.693
[SATOKO]
No!

00:21:17.735 --> 00:21:22.907
[laughs]

00:21:22.948 --> 00:21:24.325
[MION]
Easy, Satoko!

00:21:27.328 --> 00:21:28.954
[SATOKO]
No!

00:21:28.996 --> 00:21:32.249
I'm sorry! I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:21:32.291 --> 00:21:34.418
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:38.672
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:21:38.714 --> 00:21:42.176
I hate this. I hate this!
Please make it stop!

00:21:42.218 --> 00:21:47.765
[laughs]

00:21:47.807 --> 00:21:49.850
[SATOKO]
Forgive me! I can't take it!

00:21:49.892 --> 00:21:53.854
[sobs]

00:21:53.896 --> 00:22:00.528
I hate this! I hate it!
I hate it! I hate it!

00:22:00.569 --> 00:22:03.572
No!

00:22:03.614 --> 00:22:07.368
Nii‐nii! Please help me!

00:22:07.409 --> 00:22:08.202
What is this?

00:22:08.244 --> 00:22:09.203
[SATOKO]
Save me!

00:22:09.245 --> 00:22:14.875
[laughs]

00:22:16.043 --> 00:22:17.920
[KEIICHI]
What's happening to her?

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:53.265
[RIKA] Next time:
"<i>Tatariakashi‐hen</i>, Part 3."
