WEBVTT

00:00:23.982 --> 00:00:25.692
[HANYUU]
I see.

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:28.612
A tragedy must have occurred.

00:00:28.654 --> 00:00:31.740
You know there's no other
reason I would be here.

00:00:31.782 --> 00:00:32.866
And I'm sure
I'm going to be sick

00:00:32.908 --> 00:00:35.077
of seeing your face
in no time at all.

00:00:35.118 --> 00:00:36.620
[HANYUU gasps]

00:00:36.662 --> 00:00:37.538
Who killed you?

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.040
Was it Takano
or the Mountain Dogs?

00:00:40.082 --> 00:00:41.375
I couldn't tell you.

00:00:41.416 --> 00:00:43.752
My memories end hours
before my death.

00:00:43.794 --> 00:00:46.338
I don't know how it ended.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.091
But neither is likely.

00:00:49.132 --> 00:00:50.300
[chuckles bitterly]

00:00:50.342 --> 00:00:53.470
I remember running out of the
classroom, hellbent on dying.

00:00:53.512 --> 00:00:54.930
Either by slitting my throat

00:00:54.972 --> 00:00:57.683
or by throwing myself
into the river to drown.

00:00:57.724 --> 00:00:58.892
Why was that?

00:00:58.934 --> 00:01:01.186
What happened in that fragment?

00:01:01.228 --> 00:01:04.523
It pains me to ask you
to recall these memories.

00:01:04.565 --> 00:01:07.192
But as I'm trapped in
this insubstantial form,

00:01:07.234 --> 00:01:09.319
I can't look into
the fragments myself,

00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:11.947
to say nothing of entering them.

00:01:11.989 --> 00:01:12.906
Even so,

00:01:12.948 --> 00:01:14.658
if we're able to
discuss everything,

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.663
it could bring us closer to
understanding your situation.

00:01:19.705 --> 00:01:21.415
I think Keiichi and Rena.

00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:23.959
They grew paranoid
and killed each other.

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:27.379
It seems they both suffered from
late‐stage Hinamizawa Syndrome.

00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:28.463
How awful.

00:01:28.505 --> 00:01:31.967
It must have been unbearable
for Keiichi and Rena both,

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.928
and for your heart
to endure such loss.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:35.846
It was.

00:01:35.887 --> 00:01:37.931
And the shock made
the pain so much worse.

00:01:37.973 --> 00:01:38.849
I thought my words

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.768
would let Keiichi hold
onto his sanity, this time.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.354
I was a fool to put
so much faith in them.

00:01:44.396 --> 00:01:47.149
[HANYUU] You mustn't blame
yourself for their suffering.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.943
You bear the scars of
a century‐long ordeal.

00:01:49.985 --> 00:01:52.321
They may fade,
and the pain may grow dull,

00:01:52.362 --> 00:01:54.656
but they are with
you nevertheless.

00:01:54.698 --> 00:01:57.034
[RIKA] I understand that
better than you could know,

00:01:57.075 --> 00:01:59.953
but even still, people aren't
able to live without hope.

00:01:59.995 --> 00:02:02.748
So, I refuse to
give in to despair.

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.668
Why should this failure change
that, after all the rest?

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:07.753
Please forgive me.

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:08.920
Huh?

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:11.214
[RIKA]
I said something cruel to you,

00:02:11.256 --> 00:02:13.342
but you responded with kindness.

00:02:13.383 --> 00:02:16.219
Thank you for putting
my heart more at ease, Hanyuu.

00:02:17.763 --> 00:02:20.223
I shouldn't have said
I'd grow sick of your face.

00:02:20.265 --> 00:02:21.224
That was wrong.

00:02:21.266 --> 00:02:22.851
Forgive me.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.939
Rika, you'll surely
make it through this.

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:29.358
Just as you did before,

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:31.860
you will bring about
the miracle that you need.

00:02:31.902 --> 00:02:33.737
Without fail.

00:02:40.535 --> 00:02:43.080
Of course, her spirit
won't be easily broken,

00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:48.043
after enduring those
lifetimes' worth of pain.

00:02:48.085 --> 00:02:49.127
It's strange.

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:51.505
My neck still hurts even now.

00:02:51.546 --> 00:02:53.882
It's only a memory,
but I can feel it.

00:02:53.924 --> 00:02:55.634
The wound is gone, but even so,

00:02:55.676 --> 00:02:59.179
the sensation of a blade
slicing into my throat remains.

00:02:59.221 --> 00:03:00.639
It's unpleasant.

00:03:00.681 --> 00:03:02.391
Such is the potency of my gift,

00:03:02.432 --> 00:03:04.142
that the memory is
strong enough to be felt

00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:06.186
even within this realm.

00:03:06.228 --> 00:03:09.481
If you'd prefer,
I could weaken it in such a way

00:03:09.523 --> 00:03:11.316
as to relieve you
of your memories,

00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:14.611
as does the gift bestowed
by that failure unto the cat.

00:03:14.653 --> 00:03:17.948
[SATOKO chuckles] You can't
take my grousing seriously, Eua.

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.826
It's a grand gift and it
was beyond generous of you

00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:22.119
to give it to me at all.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.788
You've done more than enough.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.332
If the cat's death within
a fragment precedes yours,

00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:29.000
upon departing
from that fragment,

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:31.837
you shall follow her
consciousness on into the next.

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:35.048
That's right and I'm not
letting her out of my sight.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.718
Considering their
history, I suspect Rika's

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:40.345
still under the impression
this is Takano's doing.

00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:41.346
[EUA]
Likely.

00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:43.390
The cat knew just
enough of Keiichi's fate

00:03:43.432 --> 00:03:46.643
in the last fragment to liken
it to one she'd seen before.

00:03:46.685 --> 00:03:49.354
One in which he succumbed
to the syndrome.

00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:51.356
That's certainly
unfortunate, Rika.

00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:53.942
Your century of experience
will do nothing to help you

00:03:53.984 --> 00:03:55.402
in the worlds that lie ahead,

00:03:55.444 --> 00:03:57.988
where the curse haunting
you is under my control!

00:03:58.029 --> 00:04:01.575
[EUA laughs]
You use my gift well.

00:04:01.616 --> 00:04:04.327
Truly, the amusement
is unending.

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:06.329
I am most eager
to see how you plan

00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:09.499
to entertain me next,
child of man.

00:05:59.985 --> 00:06:01.695
Oh, good morning, Satoko.

00:06:01.736 --> 00:06:03.864
And a lovely morning to you.

00:06:03.905 --> 00:06:07.284
Goodness, it doesn't look like
you got a restful night's sleep.

00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:09.536
I just woke up from
the most awful dream.

00:06:09.578 --> 00:06:11.997
Everything's still
a little bit foggy.

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:14.082
Well, I'm sorry
to hear about that.

00:06:14.124 --> 00:06:16.334
And what was this dream about?

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:18.378
I can't really
remember any of it,

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:21.673
but there's no reason I should
let a bad dream ruin my day!

00:06:21.715 --> 00:06:23.592
Ni‐pa!

00:06:32.142 --> 00:06:34.936
Honestly, trying to
play it off as a bad dream?

00:06:34.978 --> 00:06:38.607
Who do you think you're fooling?

00:06:38.648 --> 00:06:39.983
Although, to your credit,

00:06:40.025 --> 00:06:43.069
you've gotten quite
proficient with a kitchen knife.

00:06:43.111 --> 00:06:44.654
Still, for my purposes,

00:06:44.696 --> 00:06:48.158
I'd prefer to employ a more
pleasant method from here out.

00:07:09.763 --> 00:07:12.807
I told you to piss off,
you bloodsucking bitch!

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:14.100
Uh, Satoko?

00:07:14.142 --> 00:07:15.560
[SATOKO]
How are you, Uncle?

00:07:15.602 --> 00:07:16.728
That wasn't at you!

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:17.771
When I heard you knockin',

00:07:17.812 --> 00:07:20.065
I thought my asshole
landlady had come back.

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:22.192
I never expected you
to show up here!

00:07:22.233 --> 00:07:23.193
If I knew it was you,

00:07:23.234 --> 00:07:26.279
I wouldn't've been all snarlin'
and yellin' like I was.

00:07:26.321 --> 00:07:29.157
I'd greet ya with a smile!

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:33.078
I believe you, Uncle, and
I suppose I can forgive you.

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:34.788
[TEPPEI]
Uh... Just like that?

00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:37.165
Well... Hey, I don't wanna keep
you standing out there!

00:07:37.207 --> 00:07:39.417
Come in and have, uh...

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:41.920
Yeah. Probably better
if we go somewhere else.

00:07:41.962 --> 00:07:44.506
We could grab you something
sweet at the cafe if you want.

00:07:44.547 --> 00:07:46.257
Well, that's very
generous of you to offer,

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:47.717
but I would prefer not to.

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:49.761
Jeez, I'm real
sorry about all this.

00:07:49.803 --> 00:07:51.262
I'm not trying
to waste your time,

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:53.014
but I haven't got a clue
what a girl your age

00:07:53.056 --> 00:07:55.433
would wanna do for fun.

00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:56.810
That's not an issue.

00:07:56.851 --> 00:07:58.895
All I really need from
you is a simple favor.

00:07:58.937 --> 00:08:00.063
Yeah, of course!

00:08:00.105 --> 00:08:02.565
I'll be happy to do anything
I can to help you out.

00:08:02.607 --> 00:08:04.359
You just say the word
and it's done!

00:08:04.401 --> 00:08:07.404
There's a certain special place
you're quite familiar with.

00:08:07.445 --> 00:08:10.073
I'd like to go,
but I can't get in by myself.

00:08:10.115 --> 00:08:11.241
Huh?

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.496
[TEPPEI]
Yeah, that's the way!

00:08:16.538 --> 00:08:18.456
Stay right on his tail!

Cheshire Cat Munchy, coming
around wide, closing the gap!

Wanyan Daio and Cheshire Cat

Hell yeah!

We're rich!

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:53.867
You absolutely nailed it, kiddo!

It's like you're my own

Uncle, please!

00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:00.040
Ah! Sorry, I freaked out
a little bit there.

00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:01.916
There's a catch to my magic.

00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.251
It only works once.

00:09:03.293 --> 00:09:05.670
Now can we head home, please?

00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:11.593

[giggles]

00:09:21.603 --> 00:09:23.938
[SATOKO]
This is utterly unbelievable.

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:25.607
Why do men seem
to find cleaning a house

00:09:25.648 --> 00:09:28.693
so much more objectionable
than living in their own filth?

00:09:28.735 --> 00:09:30.737
[TEPPEI]
Yeah, I'm not proud.

00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:32.530
[SATOKO] I'm going to need
you to clean up all the trash

00:09:33.907 --> 00:09:35.992
Right now, there's
not even space to sit

laid out doesn't help matters.

Uh. Nothing, I'm on it.

Look, Satoko.

00:09:59.808 --> 00:10:01.851
I've been givin'
it a lot of thought.

00:10:01.893 --> 00:10:04.562
It only seems right
that you get half the cash.

00:10:04.604 --> 00:10:07.232
Hell, half and a little extra.

00:10:08.233 --> 00:10:11.569
This will be as much as I need
and that's all I intend to take.

The rest is yours
to do with as you see fit.

00:10:14.072 --> 00:10:16.324
But you're the only
reason I won, though!

00:10:16.366 --> 00:10:19.202
[SATOKO] You were the one who
put money on the line, not me.

00:10:19.244 --> 00:10:20.620
I was barely involved.

00:10:20.662 --> 00:10:22.539
All I did was tell you
the name of some horse

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.249
that appeared in a dream I had.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:28.128
Uh, Satoko. I owe you
so much for this!

00:10:28.169 --> 00:10:30.338
Now's hardly the time
to bow your head.

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:31.422
[TEPPEI]
Huh?

00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:33.758
You came into a
pretty big windfall today.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.718
So that seems like
a reason to celebrate.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.178
Man, I want to,

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:39.305
but I don't think
my doctor would approve.

00:10:39.347 --> 00:10:42.684
I'm sure just one little drink
isn't enough to do you any harm.

00:10:42.725 --> 00:10:44.519
Why not enjoy yourself?

00:10:44.561 --> 00:10:45.436
Ya know what?

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:47.355
I should enjoy myself.

00:10:47.397 --> 00:10:48.398
What's one drink?

00:10:48.439 --> 00:10:51.568
And of course, I'll enjoy
something a little softer.

00:10:56.531 --> 00:11:00.493
[sighs] Goddamn, I can't even
remember being this happy.

00:11:00.535 --> 00:11:03.079
[burps]
And my niece came home.

00:11:03.121 --> 00:11:05.790
Who woulda called that
'cause it sure ain't me!

00:11:05.832 --> 00:11:08.751
No way in hell.

00:11:08.793 --> 00:11:11.254
I'm sorry.
You're such a sweet kid.

00:11:11.296 --> 00:11:14.382
You didn't deserve to get stuck
with an asshole like me!

00:11:14.424 --> 00:11:15.967
That's in the past, Uncle.

00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:17.886
Your apology is
good enough for me.

00:11:17.927 --> 00:11:19.304
[TEPPEI]
Not for me, it's not!

00:11:19.345 --> 00:11:20.805
From now on,
I gotta keep you safe,

00:11:20.847 --> 00:11:23.224
the way I always shoulda
done from the beginning!

00:11:23.266 --> 00:11:25.268
While I appreciate the thought,

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:27.645
I can't help but
harbor some concerns.

00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:28.605
[TEPPEI]
Huh?

00:11:28.646 --> 00:11:30.523
Well, I remember
you being friends

00:11:30.565 --> 00:11:32.442
with some very frightening men,

00:11:32.483 --> 00:11:34.819
and I'm afraid one of them
could show up again.

00:11:34.861 --> 00:11:36.738
Yeah, I get that.

00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:39.616
I used to run with a nasty crowd
back in the bad old days,

00:11:39.657 --> 00:11:42.202
but I swear, I don't even
know 'em anymore!

00:11:42.243 --> 00:11:45.038
So, you couldn't get in touch
with them if you wanted?

00:11:45.079 --> 00:11:47.707
My old address book's
around somewhere, I guess.

00:11:47.749 --> 00:11:50.543
That's scary enough on its own!

00:11:50.585 --> 00:11:52.212
Uncle, couldn't
you get in trouble

00:11:52.253 --> 00:11:54.797
if somebody found
your address book?

00:11:57.133 --> 00:11:59.260
Nah, my ass is covered, kiddo.

00:11:59.302 --> 00:12:01.429
I never woulda written
down their real names.

00:12:01.471 --> 00:12:03.348
Bad guys never write down
each other's real names

00:12:03.389 --> 00:12:06.559
in case the cops
come snoopin' around.

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:10.313
Thanks for sharing
your wisdom, Uncle.

00:12:15.526 --> 00:12:17.570
I'd love to hear
about these fake names.

00:12:17.612 --> 00:12:20.114
I hope you'll indulge me
for just a moment.

00:12:20.156 --> 00:12:21.908
Was there a name you
would call if you needed

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:23.952
to acquire certain
dangerous goods

00:12:23.993 --> 00:12:25.870
that are hard
to find in this country?

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.750
[DRIVER]
Hmm?

00:13:12.792 --> 00:13:14.294
Slow down, kid.

00:13:14.335 --> 00:13:16.671
Sorry, but your daddy
parked somewhere else.

00:13:16.713 --> 00:13:18.339
And here I was sure
I'd knocked on your door

00:13:18.381 --> 00:13:20.174
the way you specified.

00:13:20.216 --> 00:13:22.677
Did you open it
out of curiosity?

00:13:22.719 --> 00:13:25.805
I'm not gonna make anything
outta this, little girl.

00:13:25.847 --> 00:13:26.889
But you oughta run like hell

00:13:26.931 --> 00:13:28.933
from whoever sent you my way.

00:13:28.975 --> 00:13:30.977
I brought the
full amount in cash.

00:13:31.019 --> 00:13:31.853
Listen.

00:13:31.894 --> 00:13:34.022
There has to be trust
between a buyer and seller

00:13:34.063 --> 00:13:36.190
for this kind of
transaction to happen.

00:13:36.232 --> 00:13:37.817
Some mystery kid hops in my car

00:13:37.859 --> 00:13:39.527
and starts throwing
money around.

00:13:39.569 --> 00:13:41.404
there better be enough
to cover the purchase price

00:13:41.446 --> 00:13:43.489
and establish trust.

00:13:43.531 --> 00:13:45.241
If you're quite finished,

00:13:45.283 --> 00:13:46.326
would you please
count the money,

00:13:46.367 --> 00:13:47.952
so we can both be on our way?

00:13:47.994 --> 00:13:49.996
[gasps]
Whoa, holy shit.

00:13:50.038 --> 00:13:50.872
For real?

00:13:50.913 --> 00:13:52.957
That's a hell of a wad
you're throwing around.

00:13:52.999 --> 00:13:54.542
I thought I'd bring extra.

00:13:54.584 --> 00:14:00.590
Like you said it's an excellent
way to establish trust.

00:14:00.631 --> 00:14:01.591
Understood.

00:14:01.632 --> 00:14:04.594
That's a good enough answer
for anything I could've asked.

00:14:04.635 --> 00:14:05.970
Payment's been rendered in full,

00:14:06.012 --> 00:14:08.056
so here's the deliverables.

00:14:08.097 --> 00:14:09.724
Take good care of her.

00:14:15.021 --> 00:14:16.105
[SATOKO]
Perfect.

00:14:16.147 --> 00:14:18.316
Pleasure doing
business with you.

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:24.364
So, does your boss actually know
how to use one of those things?

00:14:24.405 --> 00:14:27.950
'Cause the price didn't
include any shooting lessons.

00:14:27.992 --> 00:14:29.911
That part is covered.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.248
Huh? You wanna
learn how to shoot?

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:37.377
I do, and I figured you might
have some knowledge to offer.

00:14:37.418 --> 00:14:38.795
Oh, you'd better believe I do!

00:14:38.836 --> 00:14:41.214
Your old Uncle Mion has even
had some firearms training

00:14:41.255 --> 00:14:43.800
with a former soldier
from overseas.

00:14:43.841 --> 00:14:46.135
I was thinking that learning
how to use another weapon

00:14:46.177 --> 00:14:49.263
might come in handy in the
future as a member of our club!

00:14:49.305 --> 00:14:50.681
[MION]
Hmm...

00:14:50.723 --> 00:14:52.100
You know, I've been
thinking about putting on

00:14:52.141 --> 00:14:55.561
a giant water gun battle
with the club for a while now.

00:14:55.603 --> 00:14:56.813
Let's do it!

00:15:01.234 --> 00:15:02.235
What is that?

00:15:02.276 --> 00:15:04.320
This is your new
training weapon.

00:15:11.119 --> 00:15:12.703
That was just sad,

00:15:12.745 --> 00:15:15.081
but this model gun
certainly feels well crafted.

00:15:15.123 --> 00:15:16.457
Yeah, for sure!

00:15:16.499 --> 00:15:18.084
It was a custom job,
built heavy enough

00:15:18.126 --> 00:15:21.838
to feel exactly like the
real thing in your hands.

00:15:30.138 --> 00:15:31.764
Of course, you're that good.

00:15:31.806 --> 00:15:34.725
Honestly, my skill's
not anything special.

00:15:34.767 --> 00:15:36.644
The only reason that
I've gotten this good

00:15:36.686 --> 00:15:39.355
is because I've been
practicing for so long.

00:15:39.397 --> 00:15:41.399
Practice makes
perfect, after all!

00:15:41.441 --> 00:15:42.275
Lovely.

00:15:42.316 --> 00:15:45.403
I happen to be quite
good at practicing.

00:16:37.121 --> 00:16:38.664
Not to worry.

00:16:38.706 --> 00:16:41.125
I know my way around
a gun well enough.

00:16:44.086 --> 00:16:49.884
[phone rings]

00:16:49.926 --> 00:16:50.927
Who is it?

00:16:50.968 --> 00:16:53.262
[RENA giggles]
Good morning, Satoko!

00:16:53.304 --> 00:16:54.096
Were you asleep?

00:16:54.138 --> 00:16:55.014
Were you?

00:16:55.056 --> 00:16:56.557
Oh, hi, Rena.

00:16:56.599 --> 00:16:59.227
Pardon me, but why are
you calling this early?

00:16:59.268 --> 00:17:01.562
[MION]
Good morning, Satoko!

00:17:01.604 --> 00:17:03.314
[SATOKO]
Mion is there, too?

00:17:03.356 --> 00:17:04.899
Then that must mean...

00:17:04.941 --> 00:17:06.651
[MION]
You got it!

00:17:06.692 --> 00:17:09.737
Now, grab Rika and
meet us in Okinomiya!

00:17:09.779 --> 00:17:12.740
You're gonna be
joining us, right?

00:17:12.782 --> 00:17:14.534
[SATOKO] I wouldn't
miss it for the world!

00:17:14.575 --> 00:17:17.453
The day's come,
prepare to be destroyed!

00:17:22.124 --> 00:17:24.126
[RIKA] Today is sure
to be a fierce battle!

00:17:24.168 --> 00:17:26.504
And I hear that Mion is
even putting up a cash prize

00:17:26.546 --> 00:17:27.922
for the final event!

00:17:27.964 --> 00:17:30.132
A big one. Fifty thousand yen!

00:17:30.174 --> 00:17:31.926
Huh? I don't even
know what I'd do

00:17:31.968 --> 00:17:34.136
with that kind of
money if I had it!

00:17:35.429 --> 00:17:37.223
[SATOKO]
You're finally here!

00:17:37.265 --> 00:17:39.433
We've been waiting patiently!

00:17:39.475 --> 00:17:41.519
Good morning.
Glad to see you made it.

00:17:41.561 --> 00:17:42.353
You too!

00:17:42.395 --> 00:17:44.522
What's on the agenda today?

00:17:44.564 --> 00:17:45.648
Hold on.

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:47.692
You mean this is where
we'll be having club?

00:17:47.733 --> 00:17:49.694
Yeah, the shop sets up
tournaments now and then

00:17:49.735 --> 00:17:52.613
to show off the products
and get new customers.

00:17:52.655 --> 00:17:53.739
A tournament.

00:17:53.781 --> 00:17:55.283
So now you're telling me
I'm gonna be playing

00:17:55.324 --> 00:17:57.451
against everybody else
in the whole shop?

00:17:57.493 --> 00:17:58.744
Exactly!

00:17:58.786 --> 00:18:00.663
Today's club meeting is
special 'cause there's more

00:18:00.705 --> 00:18:03.749
than just the five of us
competing this time around!

00:18:03.791 --> 00:18:05.042
That's special, huh?

00:18:05.084 --> 00:18:07.128
It's definitely
more people to beat!

00:18:07.169 --> 00:18:08.254
Get ready, Kei.

00:18:08.296 --> 00:18:10.673
You're gonna have
tons of fun today!

00:18:18.306 --> 00:18:21.100
Wha‐‐? You got your
money back already?!

00:18:21.142 --> 00:18:22.268
Awoo!

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:24.270
All of these cards are so cute!

00:18:24.312 --> 00:18:25.229
I need them.

00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:27.398
I'll take them home with me!

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.274
[RIKA]
Oh gosh.

00:18:28.316 --> 00:18:30.651
I've never played this
fishing game before.

00:18:30.693 --> 00:18:32.737
I hope you can go easy on me.

00:18:32.778 --> 00:18:34.071
Don't you worry about that!

00:18:34.113 --> 00:18:37.033
We would be more than happy
to show you the ropes, Rika!

00:18:37.074 --> 00:18:38.409
This old fart's about
to teach you boys

00:18:38.451 --> 00:18:40.453
a lesson you're
not gonna forget.

00:18:40.494 --> 00:18:42.663
Pick whichever game you
think you're good at.

00:18:42.705 --> 00:18:45.416
'Cause I'm gonna show
you how wrong you are.

00:18:45.458 --> 00:18:47.543
[SATOKO] To be honest, I can't
even recall how many times

00:18:47.585 --> 00:18:50.421
I'd beaten you two before
I stopped counting.

00:18:50.463 --> 00:18:53.382
[GAMER B] I don't think we've
ever met before today, have we?

00:18:54.342 --> 00:18:55.426
[SATOKO]
Heh.

00:18:55.468 --> 00:18:58.137
I remember each one
of these cards.

00:19:07.355 --> 00:19:08.439
[GAMER B]
What are you, psychic?

00:19:08.481 --> 00:19:09.899
[SATOKO chortles]

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:14.695
Good game, boys, but in
the end, victory is mine!

00:19:14.737 --> 00:19:16.155
You've been outplayed.

00:19:16.197 --> 00:19:17.865
Wha‐‐? Seriously?

00:19:17.907 --> 00:19:19.575
You got through
your group already?

00:19:19.617 --> 00:19:21.410
Well done, Satoko.

00:19:21.452 --> 00:19:23.829
I see you've made your
way to the finals as well.

00:19:23.871 --> 00:19:25.331
No way, Mion, too?

00:19:25.373 --> 00:19:26.624
How'd that happen?

00:19:26.666 --> 00:19:27.958
So that's dealt with,

00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:30.628
what do you say we step out
for a quick cup of tea?

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:32.797
The others should be finished
by the time we get back.

00:19:32.838 --> 00:19:35.049
Ooh. Good idea!

00:19:41.806 --> 00:19:43.808
[MION] Hmm...
Which drink do I want?

00:19:43.849 --> 00:19:45.518
This one!

00:19:55.528 --> 00:19:57.196
I've had a thought, Eua.

00:19:57.238 --> 00:19:58.280
What is that?

00:19:58.322 --> 00:19:59.949
In all the worlds
I've lived through,

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:03.202
Mion has never once been
consumed by Hinamizawa Syndrome.

00:20:03.244 --> 00:20:04.787
Indeed, not one time.

00:20:04.829 --> 00:20:06.997
Typically, the paranoia
manifests in carriers

00:20:07.039 --> 00:20:09.834
when their physical distance
from the queen is too great.

00:20:09.875 --> 00:20:12.086
Or it can be a stress
response to some mental

00:20:12.128 --> 00:20:14.630
or emotional trigger
in their lives.

00:20:14.672 --> 00:20:17.591
Mion can come off very
emotional and impulsive,

00:20:17.633 --> 00:20:19.176
but she's actually
quite rational,

00:20:19.218 --> 00:20:21.262
which might protect her
from the syndrome.

00:20:21.303 --> 00:20:23.180
Or perhaps her position
as heir apparent

00:20:23.222 --> 00:20:25.558
to the Sonozaki clan
bolsters her resolve enough

00:20:25.599 --> 00:20:28.394
that she's always able
to cling to sanity.

00:20:28.436 --> 00:20:30.396
Either way, I can't help
wondering what would happen

00:20:30.438 --> 00:20:32.189
if the paranoia claimed her‐‐

00:20:32.231 --> 00:20:35.651
what she'd do if she had
Hinamizawa Syndrome.

00:20:35.693 --> 00:20:38.529
And I'm quite eager to find out.

00:20:41.031 --> 00:20:42.324
[MION]
Sorry, everyone.

00:20:42.366 --> 00:20:44.452
I'll make it up to
you next time, promise!

00:20:44.493 --> 00:20:46.078
I suppose we'll simply
have to find the time

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:47.913
to settle this later, then!

00:20:47.955 --> 00:20:50.708
You kids made the shop
a lot of money today!

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:53.294
Here, take these
as a "thank you."

00:20:53.961 --> 00:20:55.087
Hold on a minute.

00:20:55.129 --> 00:20:56.255
I helped out, too.

00:20:56.297 --> 00:20:57.381
Where's mine?

00:20:57.423 --> 00:21:00.009
I'll give you a big tip the
next time I see you at work.

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:02.011
[groans]
Really?

00:21:02.052 --> 00:21:03.053
Well, hello there!

00:21:03.095 --> 00:21:04.722
I got a new penguin friend!

00:21:04.764 --> 00:21:07.725
Oh my gosh can I actually
take this home?

00:21:07.767 --> 00:21:10.728
So, is mine cute too?

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:11.979
[RENA]
Aww!

00:21:12.021 --> 00:21:13.773
It's so cute!

00:21:13.814 --> 00:21:14.899
[laughs]

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.567
What's wrong, Kei,
don't you wanna take it home

00:21:16.609 --> 00:21:18.360
and play house with it?

00:21:18.402 --> 00:21:20.112
It is pretty cute, honestly.

00:21:20.154 --> 00:21:22.406
Just not exactly what I'm into.

00:21:22.448 --> 00:21:23.949
And if you keep it,
folks in town

00:21:23.991 --> 00:21:26.911
are gonna start talking about
the weird kid with the doll.

00:21:26.952 --> 00:21:28.120
Yeah, good point.

00:21:28.162 --> 00:21:31.165
This would be wasted on me.

00:21:31.207 --> 00:21:33.167
Hmmm...

00:21:33.209 --> 00:21:35.878
Keiichi.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.880
That could be a
good gift for someone

00:21:37.922 --> 00:21:39.840
and if you give it out of
the goodness of your heart,

00:21:39.882 --> 00:21:43.302
I know anybody here would
be happy to accept it!

00:21:45.554 --> 00:21:46.931
You should have this, Mion.

00:21:46.972 --> 00:21:48.891
I think it suits
you much better.

00:21:48.933 --> 00:21:49.767
You, wha‐‐?

00:21:49.809 --> 00:21:52.895
Oh, no, I'm not really into
all that girly‐girl stuff!

00:21:52.937 --> 00:21:55.397
Sometimes it's like I was
supposed to end up a guy,

00:21:55.439 --> 00:21:57.608
but the wrong box got
checked or something!

00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:00.444
Seriously, just take it!

00:22:00.486 --> 00:22:02.988
Jeez. Thank you.

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:04.406
I think that's for the best.

00:22:04.448 --> 00:22:05.449
Keiichi may have won her,

00:22:05.491 --> 00:22:07.493
but she's better off with you.

00:23:52.973 --> 00:23:56.310
