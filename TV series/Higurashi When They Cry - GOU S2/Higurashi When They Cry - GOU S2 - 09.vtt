WEBVTT

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:23.440
Huh?

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:25.651
[SATOKO]
Stop it, please!

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:28.445
You don't need to
go in Nii‐Nii's room!

00:00:28.487 --> 00:00:30.489
That's enough of
your damn whining!

00:00:30.531 --> 00:00:32.616
Where the hell else
am I gonna get some cash?

00:00:32.658 --> 00:00:34.785
I know that bank
book is in there!

00:00:34.826 --> 00:00:36.912
Uncle, I didn't
take the bank book!

00:00:36.954 --> 00:00:38.914
Please don't mess up
Nii‐Nii's room!

00:00:38.956 --> 00:00:41.542
What is he gonna do
when he finally comes home?

00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:43.293
I said enough whining!

00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:51.635
[SATOKO sobs]
Nii‐Nii! Nii‐Nii!

00:00:51.677 --> 00:00:53.387
Ahh, I screwed up!

00:00:53.428 --> 00:00:58.976
I'll be in so much shit if
they see a single bruise on you!

00:01:02.104 --> 00:01:03.605
Shut your damn mouth!

00:01:03.647 --> 00:01:05.107
You know that
won't make it better!

00:01:05.148 --> 00:01:05.941
Little shit!

00:01:05.983 --> 00:01:09.820
Hey! I told you
to shut the hell up!

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:13.282
I realize something,
looking back.

00:01:13.323 --> 00:01:14.908
[EUA]
Hmm?

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.120
[STAOKO] This was one of the
worst fragments I lived through

00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:20.747
but it was wonderful,
in one respect.

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:23.375
As awful as that life was,
on the whole,

00:01:23.417 --> 00:01:26.503
at the very least,
I had Rika all to myself.

00:01:26.545 --> 00:01:29.172
Indeed, those who live in loops
often come to value things

00:01:29.214 --> 00:01:32.009
differently than
they do in mortal life.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.637
[SATOKO] The tragedies
I remember now bring me joy.

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:37.764
I can't say I object to that.

00:01:37.806 --> 00:01:41.268
If that is so,
then perhaps your humanity,

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.397
nay, your identity as
Satoko Hojo has faded fully.

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.024
[chortles]

00:01:47.065 --> 00:01:50.402
I'm afraid that is a
mischaracterization, Eua.

00:01:50.444 --> 00:01:52.446
Even as I live
through these loops.

00:01:52.487 --> 00:01:54.990
I couldn't be more sure
that I'm still myself,

00:01:55.032 --> 00:01:57.075
and that's why
I'll continue pursuing Rika

00:01:57.117 --> 00:01:58.827
till we reach a world
where we can share the life

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.663
we were always meant to have.

00:02:01.705 --> 00:02:03.832
I suppose so.

00:02:03.874 --> 00:02:05.959
[laughs]

00:03:39.177 --> 00:03:42.806
[SATOKO cries]
No!

00:03:42.848 --> 00:03:44.558
[KEIICHI]
It's okay! We're friends.

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.059
I won't hurt you!

00:03:46.101 --> 00:03:49.604
[SATOKO]
Help me. Someone help!

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:50.897
Satoko!

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:54.985
[RENA] Please. Just give
her some space, Keiichi.

00:03:55.026 --> 00:03:56.403
Don't be scared, Satoko.

00:03:56.445 --> 00:03:58.822
You're safe here with us.

00:03:58.864 --> 00:04:00.490
It's okay.

00:04:00.532 --> 00:04:05.036
[SATOKO]
Nii‐Nii. Help me, I need you!

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:09.416
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

00:04:09.458 --> 00:04:13.378
We wanted to
help you and we failed.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.131
Please forgive us.

00:04:42.991 --> 00:04:46.787
Hey, Rika. How'd it go?

00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:51.958
It's bullcrap!

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.251
Why has Child Welfare Services

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:56.087
been sitting on their hands
this whole time?

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:58.882
[MION] Satoko has a false
abuse report on her record.

00:04:58.924 --> 00:05:01.676
They won't intervene
without hard evidence.

00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:02.552
So what?

00:05:02.594 --> 00:05:03.929
We wait around for
him to do something

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.806
that leaves her
bloody and bruised?

00:05:05.847 --> 00:05:07.098
Stop, Keiichi!

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.308
I only meant they're‐‐

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.811
[SHION] What the hell
is left to talk about?

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:14.856
Wait, Shion? You're here?

00:05:14.898 --> 00:05:17.442
[SHION] If we don't stop him,
he will kill her.

00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:18.443
Enough talking.

00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:19.820
We need to act now!

00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:22.072
[RENA] Yeah, I agree
with Shion and Keiichi.

00:05:22.113 --> 00:05:23.323
It's the truth.

00:05:23.365 --> 00:05:25.742
Satoko needs our help;
we can't just wait!

00:05:25.784 --> 00:05:28.036
There must be something
we can do for her!

00:05:28.078 --> 00:05:29.371
[KEIICHI]
But what would it be?

00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:32.082
Will another report to Child
Welfare change anything?

00:05:32.123 --> 00:05:34.543
[SHION] We don't have time
to cut through the red tape!

00:05:34.584 --> 00:05:37.629
Let's ambush the pig bastard
and cut his throat!

00:05:42.717 --> 00:05:46.137
[TEPPEI]
Ugh... Huh?

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:48.390
Okay. Good enough, probably.

00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:50.976
Well, they're cut up.
So, what now?

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:53.937
Just toss everything
straight into the frying pan?

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:58.483
Add a teaspoon of oil? Huh?

00:06:00.402 --> 00:06:02.279
What the hell is a teaspoon?

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.655
Why can't they write this crap

00:06:03.697 --> 00:06:06.658
in a way normal
people can read it?

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.536
Which one of you
feels like a teaspoon?

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:13.832
[TEPPEI]
Hmm...

00:06:13.874 --> 00:06:15.959
This oughta do it, right?

00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:17.085
[gasps]

00:06:17.127 --> 00:06:18.169
Hell yeah, that's cookin'!

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:19.296
Ah!!

00:06:19.337 --> 00:06:21.339
What in the world
are you doing?!

00:06:22.257 --> 00:06:23.341
What's up, Satoko‐‐

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:25.176
Turn off the burner immediately!

00:06:27.554 --> 00:06:29.347
[TEPPEI]
Did I screw up?

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:30.807
[SATOKO]
Uncle, honestly.

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:31.850
You were literally moments

00:06:31.892 --> 00:06:33.977
from burning this
house to the ground!

00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:35.687
Sorry, kiddo.

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:38.732
I was only tryin' to give you
a little surprise, is all.

00:06:38.773 --> 00:06:41.026
Well, you've
certainly done that.

00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:41.943
[sighs]

00:06:41.985 --> 00:06:43.028
Now, could you kindly tell me

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:45.780
what possessed you to try
to cook, out of the blue?

00:06:45.822 --> 00:06:47.490
I know things are tough
for you out there,

00:06:47.532 --> 00:06:49.367
and I thought it might help
if you could come home

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:50.660
to a nice, hot meal.

00:06:50.702 --> 00:06:51.828
Uh.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:55.081
Well, I sincerely appreciate
the kind gesture.

00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:56.082
But what do you
think would happen

00:06:56.124 --> 00:06:57.584
if someone called Child Welfare

00:06:57.626 --> 00:07:00.754
to report a raging grease fire
at the Hojo residence?

00:07:00.795 --> 00:07:02.464
Huh?

00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:04.507
Listen, we have
to keep our noses clean

00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:08.053
or the people of Hinamizawa
are sure to turn it against us.

00:07:08.094 --> 00:07:10.138
We're the only ones
we can trust.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.681
Hey, about that.

00:07:11.723 --> 00:07:13.266
I had this idea.

00:07:13.308 --> 00:07:15.101
Why don't I call up
Child Welfare myself

00:07:15.143 --> 00:07:16.603
and nip all this in the bud?

00:07:16.645 --> 00:07:19.064
Then it's the whole
village versus the Hojos

00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:22.817
and who do you suppose they're
more likely to listen to?

00:07:22.859 --> 00:07:25.320
What's more, if the
Sonozakis were to get involved.

00:07:25.362 --> 00:07:28.573
Child Welfare would
effectively be their puppets.

00:07:29.491 --> 00:07:33.161
So, I guess what you're sayin'
is we gotta live with that?

00:07:33.203 --> 00:07:35.830
All I want's a
quiet life with my niece.

00:07:35.872 --> 00:07:38.541
Is that really so much to ask?

00:07:38.583 --> 00:07:40.710
To be left alone?

00:07:43.338 --> 00:07:44.756
[SATOKO] Well,
worrying ourselves over them

00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:47.092
certainly won't help
matters, will it, Uncle?

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:49.177
I'd say getting this
kitchen sparkling clean

00:07:49.219 --> 00:07:52.180
would be a far
better use of our time!

00:07:52.222 --> 00:07:54.391
Let's grab some water
and rags and get started!

00:07:54.432 --> 00:07:56.017
Right. Good thinking!

00:07:56.059 --> 00:07:58.728
Just leave the scrubbing
and the lifting to me, kid!

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:10.699
[KEIICHI]
This is it. We're doing it.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:11.533
[RENA]
Yeah!

00:08:11.574 --> 00:08:13.785
Time to go in there
and save Satoko!

00:08:13.827 --> 00:08:15.286
That's right!

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:16.663
[MION]
You already know this.

00:08:16.705 --> 00:08:18.623
But be on your best behavior,

00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:20.625
'cause everything the
department does after this

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:21.710
will be on us.

00:08:21.751 --> 00:08:24.129
Let's get this over with.

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:27.173
You dismissed my idea
out of hand, Kei.

00:08:27.215 --> 00:08:29.551
You'd better be
able make yours work.

00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:30.719
Understood?

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:31.720
Got it.

00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:33.555
Now, let's go, everyone!

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:38.393
Well, what's this?

00:08:38.435 --> 00:08:40.103
Did something catch your eye?

00:08:40.145 --> 00:08:41.521
[OOISHI]
Nothing much.

00:08:41.563 --> 00:08:43.231
I was just thinking how
interesting it was

00:08:43.273 --> 00:08:46.609
that the Maebara boy would
show up here of all places.

00:08:46.651 --> 00:08:48.862
[KUMATANI]
Child Welfare Services?

00:08:48.903 --> 00:08:49.904
Exactly.

00:08:49.946 --> 00:08:50.864
And if that wasn't enough,

00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:54.993
he's with the head of the Furude
clan and the Sonozaki girls.

00:08:55.035 --> 00:08:56.911
Huh?

00:08:56.953 --> 00:08:58.121
[OOISHI]
Hey, Kuma.

00:08:58.163 --> 00:09:00.623
Could I get you to look
into what's going on here?

00:09:00.665 --> 00:09:02.125
Yeah, sure thing.

00:09:05.628 --> 00:09:06.755
[TEPPEI]
Satoko?

00:09:06.796 --> 00:09:08.590
Where do these go, again?

00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:44.959
[KEIICHI]
Listen up, guys!

00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:48.338
We all need to talk
about Satoko Hojo, okay?

00:09:48.379 --> 00:09:50.465
As you're all well aware,
she wasn't able

00:09:50.507 --> 00:09:52.258
to come to school today.

00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:09.400
What's that?

00:10:10.485 --> 00:10:11.319
[SATOKO]
Hurry up, Uncle!

00:10:11.361 --> 00:10:13.321
Dinner's about to be served.

00:10:14.656 --> 00:10:16.491
Is there something wrong?

00:10:16.533 --> 00:10:17.826
[TEPPEI]
It's fine!

00:10:17.867 --> 00:10:19.869
Lemme go hang this stuff up.

00:10:24.874 --> 00:10:25.959
[TEPPEI]
Hmm?

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.293
The hell are you gawkin' at?

00:10:27.335 --> 00:10:29.170
You never seen a
guy hangin' up laundry?

00:10:29.212 --> 00:10:31.089
Old turds!

00:10:33.216 --> 00:10:36.261
Gotta watch your ass all
the time in this place.

00:10:36.302 --> 00:10:39.055
But it's not just
a single person.

00:10:39.097 --> 00:10:42.142
It's all the people
in Hinamizawa.

00:10:42.183 --> 00:10:43.601
It just ain't right.

00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:45.228
What can I do?

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:49.399
There has to be some way
I can help her, isn't there?

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.025
[KEIICHI] Our club already
launched the first strike

00:10:51.067 --> 00:10:52.777
on Child Welfare Services.

00:10:52.819 --> 00:10:54.154
All they did was write down

00:10:54.195 --> 00:10:56.406
that five of Satoko Hojo's
classmates showed up

00:10:56.447 --> 00:10:58.950
and asked them to help
her then sent us home.

00:10:58.992 --> 00:11:01.911
So, we know exactly
what we have to do!

00:11:01.953 --> 00:11:03.913
Five is not enough!

00:11:03.955 --> 00:11:04.873
If we're gonna save her,

00:11:04.914 --> 00:11:06.749
we're gonna
need all of your help!

00:11:06.791 --> 00:11:08.918
We're gonna show them that
we're the Hinamizawa School,

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.837
and we mean business!

00:11:10.879 --> 00:11:12.714
[KIDS]
Yeah!

00:11:13.131 --> 00:11:14.924
What can I do for her?

00:11:14.966 --> 00:11:18.386
There's gotta be something
I can do, but what is it?

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:30.940
[EMPLOYEE]
Have a good day, sir!

00:11:32.859 --> 00:11:33.943
[OOISHI]
Is that right?

00:11:33.985 --> 00:11:36.529
Teppei Hojo's
back in Hinamizawa?

00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:38.615
[KUMATANI]
And we have no idea why.

00:11:38.656 --> 00:11:40.325
[OOISHI chuckles]

00:11:40.366 --> 00:11:43.328
Knowing him, my guess is
he had one too many one night

00:11:43.369 --> 00:11:45.747
and picked a fight
with somebody he shouldn't have.

00:11:45.788 --> 00:11:48.291
Either that or he got ambitious

00:11:48.333 --> 00:11:52.170
and went after yakuza
protection money.

00:11:52.212 --> 00:11:53.546
But in any case, it seems

00:11:53.588 --> 00:11:56.758
he's not gonna be hanging
around Okinomiya anymore.

00:11:56.799 --> 00:11:59.928
[KUMATANI] Word is he's keeping
Satoko holed up in the house.

00:11:59.969 --> 00:12:01.804
Think there's any truth to that?

00:12:01.846 --> 00:12:04.682
Mr. Maebara and his friends
seem to think so,

00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:07.894
though they might not be
seeing the whole picture.

00:12:07.936 --> 00:12:10.230
But as many times as
I've had to bring Teppei in.

00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:13.733
I definitely can't
discount the possibility.

00:12:13.775 --> 00:12:17.737
Either way, I do
feel awful for Satoko.

00:12:17.779 --> 00:12:19.405
Hey, Ooishi!

00:12:19.447 --> 00:12:20.865
[OOISHI]
Hmm?

00:12:25.828 --> 00:12:27.288
Well, would ya look at that.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:30.416
What brings you out
to this neck of the woods?

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.715
[OOISHI]
Slow down there, Mr. Hojo.

00:12:37.757 --> 00:12:40.051
What exactly is this about?

00:12:40.093 --> 00:12:41.761
[KUMATANI]
Hey, enough of that!

00:12:41.803 --> 00:12:44.806
You have my full attention.

00:12:44.847 --> 00:12:47.517
Now, I'm guessing there's
something you need from me?

00:12:47.558 --> 00:12:48.726
[TEPPEI]
There is!

00:12:48.768 --> 00:12:50.311
There's somethin'
real important goin' on

00:12:50.353 --> 00:12:52.981
that I need your
help with, Detective!

00:12:53.022 --> 00:12:54.357
[OOISHI] It must be
serious if you're going

00:12:54.399 --> 00:12:57.068
to make this much
of a fuss about it.

00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:03.116
I'll hear you out.

00:13:03.157 --> 00:13:05.868
Now, would you please
go ahead and stand up?

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:07.036
You're certainly
not in a position

00:13:07.078 --> 00:13:09.289
to be asking favors of me

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.624
but if you're gonna get
on your hands and knees,

00:13:11.666 --> 00:13:14.002
the least I can do is listen.

00:13:16.963 --> 00:13:19.424
[TEPPEI]
Hey, Satoko, I'm home!

00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:22.176
I hope you had a pleasant
shopping trip, Uncle‐‐

00:13:22.969 --> 00:13:24.804
I'm glad to see
you're looking well.

00:13:24.846 --> 00:13:25.847
I was pretty surprised

00:13:25.888 --> 00:13:28.433
when I heard talk that
you'd moved back in here.

00:13:28.474 --> 00:13:30.310
Well, I'm rather
surprised myself,

00:13:30.351 --> 00:13:33.271
seeing the two of you walk
in the door together.

00:13:33.313 --> 00:13:35.064
Whatever is this about?

00:13:35.106 --> 00:13:36.816
We need someone on our side.

00:13:36.858 --> 00:13:38.651
He can help keep you safe.

00:13:38.693 --> 00:13:41.612
I don't think I'd say
I'm on anybody's side yet.

00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:43.531
I came to visit your
home at your request,

00:13:43.573 --> 00:13:45.033
but I can't judge the situation

00:13:45.074 --> 00:13:47.201
before I've heard
the whole story.

00:13:47.243 --> 00:13:49.203
Although...

00:13:49.245 --> 00:13:50.496
My first impression is,

00:13:50.538 --> 00:13:52.081
the conditions
here aren't as bad as

00:13:52.123 --> 00:13:55.335
what was reported
to Child Welfare.

00:13:55.376 --> 00:13:56.294
Would you mind
sittin' down a while

00:13:56.336 --> 00:13:59.422
and lettin' me
fill you in on things?

00:14:01.966 --> 00:14:06.471
[OOISHI] So, the village
has been bullying her?

00:14:06.512 --> 00:14:08.389
That seems a bit far‐fetched.

00:14:08.431 --> 00:14:11.559
Look, I understand you've
got no reason to believe me,

00:14:11.601 --> 00:14:13.811
but she's got nothin'
to lie about, right?

00:14:13.853 --> 00:14:16.272
Everything my Uncle
told you is true.

00:14:16.314 --> 00:14:21.694
He's the only one in the entire
village who's on my side.

00:14:21.736 --> 00:14:23.654
The people I pass on the road

00:14:23.696 --> 00:14:26.032
and even my
classmates at the school.

00:14:26.074 --> 00:14:30.661
They all believe that I'm an
enemy of Hinamizawa Village.

00:14:31.537 --> 00:14:32.413
While I'm here,

00:14:32.455 --> 00:14:35.208
do you mind if I take
a look around the place?

00:14:43.549 --> 00:14:45.551
No indication that
anyone's been locked up

00:14:45.593 --> 00:14:49.180
or abused here, huh.

00:14:59.273 --> 00:15:00.400
Well, it certainly
doesn't seem like

00:15:00.441 --> 00:15:03.736
you're in any kind
of distress, are you?

00:15:03.778 --> 00:15:05.696
[SATOKO]
Why would I be distressed?

00:15:05.738 --> 00:15:07.490
Things have been going
swimmingly between us

00:15:07.532 --> 00:15:09.283
since he moved back home.

00:15:09.325 --> 00:15:11.869
[OOISHI]
Heh. I apologize.

00:15:18.167 --> 00:15:21.754
[SATOKO] I can't believe he
would turn to Ooishi for help.

00:15:21.796 --> 00:15:24.715
He believed my lie but
what's truly shocking

00:15:24.757 --> 00:15:28.845
is that he would go to
such lengths to protect me.

00:16:07.758 --> 00:16:11.053
It must be awfully
frustrating, Detective Ooishi.

00:16:11.095 --> 00:16:14.474
You've thrown yourself into
solving the Hinamizawa murders,

00:16:14.515 --> 00:16:17.018
and you've failed every time.

00:16:17.059 --> 00:16:19.270
But all your worries
are over now

00:16:19.312 --> 00:16:22.773
because with this medicine, your
eyes will finally be opened,

00:16:22.815 --> 00:16:26.027
and the truth will be fully
revealed to you at last.

00:16:29.572 --> 00:16:31.407
[EUA chuckles]

00:16:31.449 --> 00:16:33.993
My... how gruesome a
tragedy could Ooishi inflict

00:16:34.035 --> 00:16:36.871
upon the village as
he progresses to L Five?

00:16:36.913 --> 00:16:39.457
I hardly dare to guess.

00:16:39.499 --> 00:16:41.959
And yet, however
the story may unfold,

00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:43.544
I can scarcely
imagine it could fail

00:16:43.586 --> 00:16:45.546
to keep our boredom at bay.

00:16:45.588 --> 00:16:48.424
[laughs]
Wouldn't you agree?

00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:53.137
My apologies.

00:16:53.179 --> 00:16:55.932
I hadn't planned on
taking up so much of your day.

00:16:55.973 --> 00:16:58.184
[TEPPEI] Do you think
you can help Satoko out?

00:16:58.226 --> 00:17:00.394
Well, from everything
I've seen here today,

00:17:00.436 --> 00:17:01.604
I'm comfortable enough to say

00:17:01.646 --> 00:17:04.565
there's nothing that warrants
a call to Child Welfare.

00:17:04.607 --> 00:17:05.900
So, then you can!

00:17:05.942 --> 00:17:07.109
[OOISHI]
As an officer of the law,

00:17:07.151 --> 00:17:09.487
it wouldn't be proper
for me to publicly take sides

00:17:09.529 --> 00:17:11.781
in what's currently
a personal dispute

00:17:11.822 --> 00:17:13.491
but if matters
begin to escalate,

00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:16.577
or if you feel that either
one of you is in danger,

00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:19.121
I hope you won't
hesitate to let me know.

00:17:19.163 --> 00:17:21.123
And I promise to
do anything in my power

00:17:21.165 --> 00:17:22.792
to help you guys out.

00:17:22.833 --> 00:17:25.878
Heh! I owe you
my life, Detective!

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.756
[SATOKO] I truly couldn't
have hoped for a better ally

00:17:28.798 --> 00:17:31.968
to have on my side in this
fight, Detective Ooishi!

00:17:32.009 --> 00:17:34.053
No need for all that now.

00:17:36.013 --> 00:17:38.516
[OOISHI] All right, you two,
stay in touch.

00:17:58.244 --> 00:18:00.079
[OOISHI]
Old pal.

00:18:00.121 --> 00:18:02.748
I promised at your grave that
I would track down your killers

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:06.377
and your missing arm,
and I promise again every year.

00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:09.171
But I think this is
the year it happens.

00:18:09.213 --> 00:18:11.299
I'm finally getting closer.

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:12.717
I might be able
to find the criminals

00:18:12.758 --> 00:18:14.802
hiding behind the curse.

00:18:14.844 --> 00:18:19.432
[chuckles] Though I'm not
gonna be doing it by the book.

00:18:27.189 --> 00:18:29.525
[KUMATANI]
Hey, Ooishi!

00:18:29.567 --> 00:18:31.777
[OOISHI] Sorry to keep
you waiting so long.

00:18:31.819 --> 00:18:34.196
Hope you're not mad at me, Kuma.

00:18:34.238 --> 00:18:35.573
You get used to it.

00:18:35.615 --> 00:18:37.908
So, what's got Teppei Hojo
inviting detectives

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:39.160
into his house?

00:18:39.201 --> 00:18:40.453
[OOISHI chuckles]

00:18:40.494 --> 00:18:43.414
I'll have to fill you in
on the situation later.

00:18:43.456 --> 00:18:44.707
But on that topic,

00:18:44.749 --> 00:18:47.293
have we heard anything
from Child Welfare?

00:18:47.335 --> 00:18:49.378
The demonstrators
were back at it today.

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:52.089
Even more of them
than last time.

00:18:52.131 --> 00:18:55.384
[OOISHI] Well, the Maebara boy
is new in town, after all.

00:18:55.426 --> 00:18:56.594
He might have
jumped straight into

00:18:56.636 --> 00:19:00.056
the dogpile before he really
knew what was going on.

00:19:00.097 --> 00:19:01.349
Dogpile?

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:02.683
I'm sorry to ask, Kuma,

00:19:02.725 --> 00:19:05.603
but could you wait here
just a bit longer?

00:19:05.645 --> 00:19:08.898
[KUMATANI] If you say so,
but where are you going now?

00:19:08.939 --> 00:19:10.900
[OOISHI] I'd like to take
a walk around the village

00:19:10.941 --> 00:19:13.277
and go up to the Furude Shrine.

00:19:13.319 --> 00:19:15.696
[KUMATANI] Right, 'cause
Watanagashi is coming up.

00:19:15.738 --> 00:19:16.906
Scoping out security?

00:19:16.947 --> 00:19:18.866
[OOISHI]
Yeah, that's exactly right.

00:19:18.908 --> 00:19:21.619
After all, there are certain
places the locals associate

00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:24.413
with Lord Oyashiro's curse
and it seems to me

00:19:24.455 --> 00:19:27.375
like those are the places
to keep an eye on.

00:19:28.292 --> 00:19:31.003
[GARDENER] I'd never believe you
if you told me I'd see Teppei,

00:19:31.045 --> 00:19:33.214
of all people,
hangin' up the laundry.

00:19:33.255 --> 00:19:34.965
[VILLAGER B] Yeah, but he
was as scary as ever,

00:19:35.007 --> 00:19:37.093
flyin' off the handle
and screamin' at us,

00:19:37.134 --> 00:19:38.803
so I reckon it really was him.

00:19:38.844 --> 00:19:40.012
[OOISHI]
How you fellas doin'?

00:19:40.054 --> 00:19:41.430
[GARDENER]
Hey there, Ooishi.

00:19:41.472 --> 00:19:42.807
How can we help ya?

00:19:42.848 --> 00:19:43.724
Just a bit ago,

00:19:43.766 --> 00:19:46.602
I was walking by the
Hojo family's old place.

00:19:46.644 --> 00:19:50.731
I could swear I heard Teppei
yelling his head off at someone.

00:19:51.857 --> 00:19:53.359
Yeah. Sounds right.

00:19:53.401 --> 00:19:55.319
We've been hearin' about that.

00:19:55.361 --> 00:19:57.029
I sure do feel for Satoko,

00:19:57.071 --> 00:19:59.573
havin' to be cooped up
there with that man all alone.

00:19:59.615 --> 00:20:01.075
Then he is abusing her?

00:20:01.117 --> 00:20:03.202
Likely, but there's no proof.

00:20:03.244 --> 00:20:04.745
Do you think you could go

00:20:04.787 --> 00:20:07.665
and check up on her
for us, Detective?

00:20:07.707 --> 00:20:09.792
[OOISHI] Hmm...
I can't really get involved

00:20:09.834 --> 00:20:11.794
without some
evidence of a crime.

00:20:11.836 --> 00:20:15.297
But I do hear your concern, and
I think it's for good reason,

00:20:15.339 --> 00:20:18.259
so could I ask you two
to keep an eye on the place?

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:19.927
[GARDENER]
I suppose so.

00:20:51.834 --> 00:20:53.127
[cracking sounds]

00:20:55.504 --> 00:20:57.465
[cruching sounds]

00:21:07.266 --> 00:21:08.559
Well, hello!

00:21:08.601 --> 00:21:10.394
Good to see you, Detective!

00:21:10.436 --> 00:21:11.729
[OOISHI] Looks like
you've been working up

00:21:11.771 --> 00:21:13.731
a good sweat out here!

00:21:13.773 --> 00:21:16.734
Any chance you've caught
sight of Teppei skulking around?

00:21:16.776 --> 00:21:18.861
[ELDER]
Huh? That Hojo lout?

00:21:18.903 --> 00:21:21.071
No, sir. Not lately.

00:21:21.113 --> 00:21:23.157
[OOISHI]
Really? That's strange.

00:21:23.199 --> 00:21:25.034
He was here just a moment ago.

00:21:25.075 --> 00:21:26.243
As a matter of fact.

00:21:26.285 --> 00:21:27.787
I saw him running away
from the shrine

00:21:27.828 --> 00:21:29.955
as I started
heading up the stairs.

00:21:29.997 --> 00:21:31.582
That's not good.

00:21:31.624 --> 00:21:34.335
No way he would've been
praying to Lord Oyashiro,

00:21:34.376 --> 00:21:35.669
so what was he up to?

00:21:35.711 --> 00:21:38.172
Yeah, that's a good question.

00:21:38.214 --> 00:21:42.885
Well, let's just hope he
wasn't raiding the offering box.

00:21:42.927 --> 00:21:45.304
No room left for doubt,
now, is there?

00:21:45.346 --> 00:21:47.139
Our murderous friends
could hardly ask

00:21:47.181 --> 00:21:50.684
for a cleaner setup than this.

00:21:50.726 --> 00:21:51.769
That's right.

00:21:51.811 --> 00:21:54.188
One target for demoning away

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:58.359
and one to be sacrificed
to Lord Oyashiro's curse.

00:22:01.445 --> 00:22:03.739
[VILLAGER A] Who would
do something like this?

00:22:03.781 --> 00:22:06.534
[VILLAGER B] Teppei would
and did, from what I hear.

00:22:06.575 --> 00:22:09.787
Relieved himself on
the torii gate walking out.

00:22:09.829 --> 00:22:12.164
[VILLAGER A]
The man's got no decency!

00:22:12.206 --> 00:22:14.041
You know what
people've been saying.

00:22:14.083 --> 00:22:16.377
Lord Oyashiro
never stops watching.

00:22:16.418 --> 00:22:17.962
Yeah.

00:22:18.003 --> 00:22:20.089
And he's looking
straight at the Hojos.

00:23:52.932 --> 00:23:56.560
[RIKA] Next time:
"<i>Tatariakashi‐hen</i>, Part 4."
