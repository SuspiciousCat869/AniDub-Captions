00:00:19.394 --> 00:00:20.687
[EUA]
Hmm...

00:00:21.897 --> 00:00:23.148
The game is in your favor.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.942
The pieces all seem
to move in accordance

00:00:24.983 --> 00:00:26.443
with your will.

00:00:26.485 --> 00:00:30.364
And it's barely begun.

00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:31.740
Rika could never imagine

00:00:31.782 --> 00:00:34.743
how much suffering
I still have in store for her.

00:00:34.785 --> 00:00:35.953
Heh.

00:00:36.954 --> 00:00:38.830
And after having
once escaped the cycle,

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:40.415
the pain of being ensnared again

00:00:40.457 --> 00:00:43.919
in her century of tragedy
makes it more bitter still.

00:00:43.961 --> 00:00:45.796
The cat's mind is entangled.

00:00:45.837 --> 00:00:47.130
Each loop, yet another burr

00:00:47.172 --> 00:00:49.675
in the snare tearing
at her psyche.

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:51.802
What a great gift
you offered me.

00:00:51.843 --> 00:00:53.011
Thank you, Eua.

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:54.555
Your power has
given me the wherewithal

00:00:54.596 --> 00:00:57.349
to force my dear,
stubborn Rika to submit.

00:00:57.391 --> 00:00:58.517
[EUA chuckles]

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.728
You hardly need to thank me.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.772
What I have vested
in you is a trifle next

00:01:03.814 --> 00:01:05.607
to what I gain from your antics,

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:08.944
an escape from boredom,
which I so detest.

00:01:08.986 --> 00:01:11.280
I won't pretend I understand
just what it is you find

00:01:11.321 --> 00:01:15.117
so entertaining about me,
but I'm glad you're having fun.

00:01:15.158 --> 00:01:17.411
[EUA]
Hmm...

00:01:17.452 --> 00:01:22.583
Child of man, do not forget
this most important fact.

00:01:22.624 --> 00:01:23.542
In casting the die,

00:01:23.584 --> 00:01:25.460
you bound yourself
to see this game through

00:01:25.502 --> 00:01:27.170
to its conclusion.

00:01:27.212 --> 00:01:31.717
It's already begun,
and you can no longer withdraw.

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:34.595
As long as you continue
to follow the cat in death,

00:01:34.636 --> 00:01:36.555
so, too, shall you
follow her consciousness

00:01:36.597 --> 00:01:39.224
into the next
fragment without fail.

00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:42.477
However, should you happen
to precede the cat in death,

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:45.647
and therefore, be expelled
from a fragment before her.

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.774
You would find yourself
thrust into a world

00:01:47.816 --> 00:01:49.860
wherein the knowledge you've
gained would serve you little,

00:01:49.901 --> 00:01:50.902
for in that fragment,

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:53.864
your quarry would
never be born at all.

00:01:53.905 --> 00:01:57.034
Have you any objection
to these conditions?

00:01:57.075 --> 00:02:00.120
I would hardly make
such a careless mistake.

00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:05.375
[EUA chcukles]

00:02:06.585 --> 00:02:08.587
Of course not, naturally.

00:02:17.304 --> 00:02:20.557
‐‐[RIKA] Too close.
‐‐[HANYUU gasps] I'm sorry!

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.977
I suppose you're not in the mood
to give me an "au au," then?

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.563
No, don't worry about it.

00:02:26.605 --> 00:02:29.691
That would be a poor use of
the time we've been granted.

00:02:29.733 --> 00:02:32.361
Let's try and make this
a constructive discussion.

00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:34.613
Though, regardless,
the fact that I'm here tells us

00:02:34.655 --> 00:02:36.531
that a tragedy has occurred.

00:02:36.573 --> 00:02:38.408
There's nothing to be
gained by forcing yourself

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.035
to carry on through the pain.

00:02:40.077 --> 00:02:42.162
Give yourself a moment to rest.

00:02:42.204 --> 00:02:43.413
Of course.

00:02:44.373 --> 00:02:45.707
If you can promise
it will lead me

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:47.292
to a world free of tragedy,

00:02:47.334 --> 00:02:50.837
I'll gladly lie here in
silence with my eyes shut.

00:02:51.672 --> 00:02:54.549
Or perhaps you mean
to rescue me yourself.

00:02:54.591 --> 00:02:58.428
Is that it, Lord Oyashiro?

00:02:59.304 --> 00:03:01.723
[HANYUU]
I'm sorry.

00:03:01.765 --> 00:03:04.267
[RIKA] I still don't
know what I did wrong.

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:06.812
What else could I have done?

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:08.855
When Keiichi won
that doll at the game shop,

00:03:08.897 --> 00:03:12.776
I said he should give it to Mion
as a present and he listened,

00:03:12.818 --> 00:03:14.778
but that didn't change anything!

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.239
He still snuck into the
ritual toolshed with Shion,

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.659
and Kimiyoshi still
went missing in the night!

00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:23.161
[HANYUU] Rika.
Your killer in that world‐‐

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:24.913
Shion, I think.

00:03:24.955 --> 00:03:25.831
But you know quite well

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:28.375
that the power I bear
has been compromised.

00:03:28.417 --> 00:03:30.627
So, I have no way of
knowing for certain.

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:33.422
Please, calm down and
consider what you do know.

00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:35.382
Even if you're unable
to remember the hours

00:03:35.424 --> 00:03:36.758
before your death,

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.469
there may be some hint
in the memories you have!

00:03:39.511 --> 00:03:40.971
[RIKA]
I don't want to.

00:03:42.556 --> 00:03:43.390
Rika.

00:03:43.432 --> 00:03:46.393
[RIKA] I'm so tired
of seeing people die.

00:03:46.435 --> 00:03:50.689
I keep losing my friends and
all the people I grew up with.

00:03:52.858 --> 00:03:58.864
[RIKA] And I‐I'm sorry,
but I'm tired of dying, too.

00:04:10.292 --> 00:04:11.418
[SATOKO]
Rika?

00:04:20.218 --> 00:04:21.928
Is something the matter?

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.347
[RIKA]
Oh. It's nothing. I'm fine.

00:04:26.892 --> 00:04:28.810
I had this awful dream
before I woke up,

00:04:28.852 --> 00:04:31.480
and I needed a
moment to shake it off.

00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:35.734
Really, I'm okay! Ni‐pa!

00:04:35.776 --> 00:04:38.487
That face tells
a different story.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.082
[sobs]

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:52.584
[RIKA]
Satoko!

00:04:52.626 --> 00:04:56.713
I don't understand
why it keeps happening!

00:04:56.755 --> 00:05:00.592
How many times
do I have to do this?!

00:05:00.634 --> 00:05:04.346
[sobs]

00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:06.515
If your nightmares are
causing this much pain,

00:05:06.556 --> 00:05:08.225
perhaps there's more to them.

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:11.478
It could be that your dreams
bear some deeper message.

00:05:12.813 --> 00:05:15.357
A message? What does that mean?

00:05:15.398 --> 00:05:17.776
And why? From who?

00:05:17.818 --> 00:05:23.990
Well, if I had to guess,
a divine being.

00:05:24.032 --> 00:05:28.078
Say, one like Lord Oyashiro.

00:05:32.374 --> 00:05:36.002
After all, he is the guardian
deity of Hinamizawa.

00:05:36.044 --> 00:05:37.671
If you've been
having nightmares,

00:05:37.712 --> 00:05:39.422
then maybe he's trying
to tell you something

00:05:39.464 --> 00:05:42.342
too important to risk
letting it go unnoticed.

00:05:42.384 --> 00:05:44.636
By making me suffer endlessly?

00:05:44.678 --> 00:05:47.556
What could I learn from
being tormented like this?

00:05:47.597 --> 00:05:50.267
I certainly couldn't
answer that question.

00:05:50.308 --> 00:05:54.062
But you do know that
Lord Oyashiro isn't an evil god.

00:05:54.104 --> 00:05:56.773
All he wants is
for us to be happy.

00:05:56.815 --> 00:05:59.234
Surely, he's trying
to show you how.

00:05:59.276 --> 00:06:00.861
[RIKA]
But why do it like this?

00:06:00.902 --> 00:06:03.363
Why make it so
hard to understand?

00:06:03.405 --> 00:06:05.156
I'm trying,
but no matter what I do,

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:07.742
the nightmares always
seem to drag me in again.

00:06:07.784 --> 00:06:09.035
It won't stop!

00:06:09.077 --> 00:06:11.246
[SATOKO]
Hey, Rika?

00:06:11.288 --> 00:06:12.914
I have a question for you,

00:06:12.956 --> 00:06:17.502
and I need you to
give me an honest answer.

00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:19.337
Have you done, or said,

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:20.422
or even thought of anything

00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:23.967
that could have made
Lord Oyashiro angry?

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:26.177
Does anything at
all come to mind?

00:06:30.974 --> 00:06:32.601
No. Nothing.

00:06:38.773 --> 00:06:41.943
I've always been
a good priestess.

00:06:46.114 --> 00:06:47.866
You liar.

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:52.329
Did you just say something?

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:53.288
You're lying.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.373
I've heard you say
things in your sleep.

00:06:57.417 --> 00:07:00.253
"I'd do anything to be
free of this hick village.

00:07:00.295 --> 00:07:02.672
I wish I could escape to
the Saint Fancy‐Name Academy

00:07:02.714 --> 00:07:06.134
for Young Ladies,
like I've always dreamed of."

00:07:08.011 --> 00:07:09.971
But one of
Lord Oyashiro's rules states

00:07:10.013 --> 00:07:13.600
that villagers are never to
abandon Hinamizawa, doesn't it?

00:07:13.642 --> 00:07:15.060
You're his priestess, too.

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:16.603
You should take
that rule to heart.

00:07:16.645 --> 00:07:19.189
[RIKA]
All of that is ancient history!

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:22.150
People go to Okinomiya
and back every day.

00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:23.485
We're allowed to travel!

00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:26.363
[SATOKO] I promise I won't
tell anyone your answer.

00:07:26.404 --> 00:07:27.864
So be honest with me.

00:07:27.906 --> 00:07:31.242
Have you really been harboring
such a blasphemous wish?

00:07:32.702 --> 00:07:36.831
How can having a certain school
I wanna go to be blasphemy?

00:07:36.873 --> 00:07:38.375
That's not fair!

00:07:38.416 --> 00:07:40.001
Am I not even allowed to dream?

00:07:40.043 --> 00:07:42.963
You're his priestess;
his servant in the mortal world.

00:07:43.004 --> 00:07:45.757
You're the very incarnation
of Oyashiro on Earth.

00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:48.593
I don't care! It's wrong!

00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:52.097
I never chose that for myself,
so why do I have to suffer?

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:54.766
It was decided
before I was born!

00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:11.866
Then tell me.

00:08:11.908 --> 00:08:15.537
What makes you wish
you could leave Hinamizawa?

00:08:23.795 --> 00:08:27.007
I know you can still
appreciate its beauty,

00:08:27.048 --> 00:08:30.343
especially on a day
with such fair weather.

00:08:30.385 --> 00:08:32.429
And this village has been
our constant companion

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:35.056
for our entire lives.

00:08:35.098 --> 00:08:38.810
We've played in its rivers,
walked between its fields,

00:08:38.852 --> 00:08:41.396
looked down upon it
from the mountaintops,

00:08:41.438 --> 00:08:43.231
and from the moment
we were born,

00:08:43.273 --> 00:08:45.066
Hinamizawa and its
people have been here

00:08:45.108 --> 00:08:47.902
to protect and nurture us.

00:08:47.944 --> 00:08:52.240
But you still grew tired
of your "quaint hometown."

00:08:52.282 --> 00:08:54.701
And I think,
if I were Lord Oyashiro,

00:08:54.743 --> 00:08:56.536
it would hurt me
to see my priestess show

00:08:56.578 --> 00:08:59.581
so little regard for the gifts
I had shared with her.

00:09:06.504 --> 00:09:09.966
So, then, perhaps
these nightmares

00:09:10.008 --> 00:09:12.218
are a way of punishing you.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.763
What does he want me to do?

00:09:14.804 --> 00:09:16.681
Try and clear your mind.

00:09:16.723 --> 00:09:18.975
Think back on
your time in Hinamizawa,

00:09:19.017 --> 00:09:21.269
to all the good memories
you've made here.

00:09:21.311 --> 00:09:23.980
You might even remember
some you had forgotten.

00:09:26.024 --> 00:09:27.442
And if you do that.

00:09:31.613 --> 00:09:34.532
I'm sure you won't
suffer any more nightmares.

00:09:38.912 --> 00:09:40.538
[RIKA]
I'm so sorry.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.290
You've gone through
hard times here,

00:09:42.332 --> 00:09:46.753
just like I have but I was
so caught up in my own pain.

00:09:46.795 --> 00:09:48.338
All is forgiven.

00:09:48.379 --> 00:09:50.548
Getting to share this moment
with my dearest friend

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:53.885
in the village
I love is enough, Rika.

00:09:53.927 --> 00:09:58.098
Satoko. Thank you.

00:10:13.655 --> 00:10:15.698
[BOY A]
C'mon!

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.575
[BOY B]
You got this!

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.328
There's only two outs.

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:22.247
It's not over yet!

00:10:22.288 --> 00:10:24.249
But this is the
last chance we'll get.

00:10:26.668 --> 00:10:28.878
We were absolutely
smoking these guys,

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.381
but that pitcher has turned
the whole game around.

00:10:31.422 --> 00:10:33.258
You looked
so cool out there, Mi.

00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:36.136
You hit home runs to
both left and right field!

00:10:36.177 --> 00:10:37.262
Though even making contact

00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:40.056
with the ball is enough
to look cooler than Satoko.

00:10:40.098 --> 00:10:40.974
Oh, really?

00:10:41.015 --> 00:10:43.726
You'd better get ready
to eat those words, Rika.

00:10:43.768 --> 00:10:45.353
Mii.

00:10:49.774 --> 00:10:50.775
Safe!

00:10:50.817 --> 00:10:51.734
Hell yeah!

00:10:51.776 --> 00:10:54.028
Yay! You can do it, Satoko!

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:55.905
All right.

00:10:55.947 --> 00:10:58.992
Time to hit this homerun
and seal the deal!

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:02.787
How's Satoko's batting
been so far today?

00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:04.372
Let me think.

00:11:04.414 --> 00:11:06.040
She struck out every time.

00:11:06.082 --> 00:11:06.958
[RIKA]
She swung hard,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.461
but her bat was this
far away from the ball!

00:11:10.503 --> 00:11:13.047
Right. That's her game.

00:11:14.048 --> 00:11:16.217
[RENA]
Over here, Keiichi!

00:11:16.259 --> 00:11:18.761
Satoko, it's gonna be okay.

00:11:18.803 --> 00:11:21.181
Someone's here to save the day!

00:11:25.602 --> 00:11:26.686
Oh, my.

00:11:26.728 --> 00:11:28.104
What exactly
did you expect to do

00:11:28.146 --> 00:11:30.023
with that thing
out here, Keiichi?

00:11:41.284 --> 00:11:42.285
Nice swing!

00:11:43.953 --> 00:11:45.955
Don't even need
to run the bases!

00:11:45.997 --> 00:11:48.208
[chortles]

00:11:48.249 --> 00:11:49.876
Hooray, we won!

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:54.172
Why did you even
bother calling me?

00:11:54.214 --> 00:11:56.299
[KAMEDA]
Damn it all!

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:58.301
A perfect trap.

00:11:58.343 --> 00:11:59.719
All you have to do
is play it cool,

00:11:59.761 --> 00:12:01.179
and your opponent
will never realize

00:12:01.221 --> 00:12:03.514
what's happening
until it's over!

00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:04.891
That's the ballgame.

00:12:04.933 --> 00:12:07.143
Now, you remember
our deal, right?

00:12:13.775 --> 00:12:16.611
Wow. You guys got here early!

00:12:16.653 --> 00:12:19.322
You've finally decided
to join us, I see!

00:12:19.364 --> 00:12:20.823
You could've been a bit later.

00:12:20.865 --> 00:12:23.284
Then I would've gotten
to eat all of your meat.

00:12:23.326 --> 00:12:25.495
That's too bad for you,

00:12:25.536 --> 00:12:27.914
'cause I've got a
big‐time reach advantage.

00:12:27.956 --> 00:12:30.375
I can get to the choice cuts
before you're in range.

00:12:30.416 --> 00:12:32.293
You're kidding
yourself if you believe

00:12:32.335 --> 00:12:34.254
I'm just gonna let you
get away with that!

00:12:34.295 --> 00:12:35.463
Oh, calm down.

00:12:35.505 --> 00:12:38.049
I'll leave plenty of bell
peppers and eggplants for you.

00:12:38.675 --> 00:12:39.759
And if that's not enough,

00:12:39.801 --> 00:12:41.636
I'll make sure you have
all the roasted squash

00:12:41.678 --> 00:12:43.513
you could ever ask for!

00:12:43.554 --> 00:12:44.806
You wouldn't!

00:12:44.847 --> 00:12:46.975
I'd better let Coach know.

00:12:47.016 --> 00:12:50.770
I'm gonna tell him
how much you love squash.

00:12:50.853 --> 00:12:52.605
He would go on
a cross‐country tour

00:12:52.647 --> 00:12:54.774
and buy up all
the squash in Japan!

00:12:54.816 --> 00:12:56.025
[KEIICHI]
Wouldn't that be nice, Satoko?

00:12:56.067 --> 00:12:57.652
Nothing but squash
for breakfast, lunch,

00:12:57.694 --> 00:12:59.112
and dinner, every day!

00:12:59.153 --> 00:13:01.572
[sobs]
Rena!

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:03.616
They're being mean to me!

00:13:03.658 --> 00:13:05.618
Wait, if you go crying
to Rena, she'll‐‐

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:07.829
[RENA]
Awoo!

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:09.998
Stop that right now, Keiichi!

00:13:10.039 --> 00:13:12.166
I won't let you be
mean to Satoko!

00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:14.460
'Cause she's mine and
I'm taking her home with me!

00:13:14.502 --> 00:13:16.296
Hey, Rena, we're not done yet!

00:13:16.337 --> 00:13:17.922
Mion and Rika are
trying to act like

00:13:17.964 --> 00:13:20.675
they weren't in on it, too!

00:13:34.939 --> 00:13:36.649
[chuckles]

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:40.570
[BOY E] You can let me
take care of all these.

00:13:40.611 --> 00:13:42.447
Might I ask for a favor?

00:13:42.488 --> 00:13:43.531
Huh?

00:13:45.116 --> 00:13:45.908
[KEIICHI]
Rika.

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:46.743
Mii?

00:13:46.784 --> 00:13:48.619
You seen Satoko around?

00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:51.581
I think she left early to go
and get groceries for dinner.

00:13:51.622 --> 00:13:52.957
[KEIICHI]
Did she?

00:13:52.999 --> 00:13:54.709
That's convenient.

00:13:54.751 --> 00:13:57.170
It must be nice to
ditch clean‐up duty!

00:13:57.211 --> 00:13:59.630
Satoko is really clever
and can think on her feet.

00:13:59.672 --> 00:14:03.301
Unlike you, Keiichi. Ni‐pa!

00:14:19.067 --> 00:14:22.236
All right, all right,
that gave me everything I need!

00:14:22.278 --> 00:14:23.321
<i>Ron!</i>

00:14:23.363 --> 00:14:25.448
Man, I stepped in that one!

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:27.658
But still this thing's not over.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:31.162
[SATOKO] Actually, I believe I
myself have a double <i>ron</i>, here.

00:14:31.204 --> 00:14:32.372
Huh?

00:14:35.291 --> 00:14:37.460
A <i>yakuman</i>?

00:14:37.502 --> 00:14:40.546
[chuckles] You and little Satoko
have been wiping the floor

00:14:40.588 --> 00:14:42.507
with us all day!

00:14:42.548 --> 00:14:43.424
[FRIEND B]
Yeah, that one‐two punch

00:14:43.466 --> 00:14:45.218
at the end sealed the deal.

00:14:45.259 --> 00:14:46.803
Hell yeah, Satoko!

00:14:46.844 --> 00:14:49.847
We really cleaned
house together!

00:14:49.889 --> 00:14:51.391
Sorry 'bout that.

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:53.684
Thanks, kid!

00:14:53.726 --> 00:14:56.771
The girl's turnin' into a real
killer at the mahjong table!

00:14:56.813 --> 00:14:59.565
She could have what it takes
to go pro someday, no joke!

00:14:59.607 --> 00:15:00.775
[TEPPEI] Yeah,
you better believe my niece

00:15:00.817 --> 00:15:02.151
has what it takes!

00:15:02.193 --> 00:15:03.236
She's cute as a button,

00:15:03.277 --> 00:15:06.030
but she's sharp enough to
beat anyone at their own game!

00:15:06.072 --> 00:15:08.741
[laughter]

00:15:08.783 --> 00:15:10.368
[FRIEND A]
How 'bout another round?

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:12.703
It's been fun, but we're
gonna have to call it there.

00:15:12.745 --> 00:15:14.914
Huh? For real? This early?

00:15:14.956 --> 00:15:16.874
You never close out
while the sun's up.

00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:20.169
I gotta take Satoko back to her
place before it gets dark out.

00:15:20.211 --> 00:15:22.630
No way I'm having
her walk home at night.

00:15:22.672 --> 00:15:24.715
If anything ever
happened to that girl...

00:15:24.757 --> 00:15:26.634
‐‐Uhhh...
‐‐Uhhh...

00:15:28.428 --> 00:15:30.138
[FRIEND A]
You sure have changed, Tecchan.

00:15:30.179 --> 00:15:33.433
They do say nothing changes
a man like a woman, right?

00:15:33.474 --> 00:15:34.308
[FRIEND B]
I never would have guessed

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:36.811
the woman would
be so tiny, though.

00:15:36.853 --> 00:15:38.062
That little lady right there

00:15:38.104 --> 00:15:41.357
is the only family
I got left in this world.

00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:42.650
I had to change.

00:15:42.692 --> 00:15:45.820
I couldn't keep being
the man I was before.

00:15:45.862 --> 00:15:49.907
If it came to it, I'd be
willing to die for Satoko.

00:15:50.992 --> 00:15:52.785
Hell, I buy it!

00:15:52.827 --> 00:15:55.663
Honestly, I'm likin'
this new Tecchan!

00:15:59.792 --> 00:16:02.670
Thanks a lot for takin'
the time to come and visit me.

00:16:02.712 --> 00:16:03.921
[SATOKO]
If I hadn't, your apartment

00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:07.133
would've gradually
turned back into a landfill.

00:16:07.175 --> 00:16:08.509
All the time I spent cleaning it

00:16:08.551 --> 00:16:10.386
would have been thrown away.

00:16:10.428 --> 00:16:11.888
[TEPPEI]
Hmmm...

00:16:11.929 --> 00:16:12.889
Sorry.

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:16.684
It's the first time I've had to
take care of a place on my own.

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:25.860
[SATOKO] It looks like you've
hardly touched your winnings

00:16:25.902 --> 00:16:27.570
from the horse race, Uncle.

00:16:27.612 --> 00:16:29.238
I expected worse.

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.824
[TEPPEI] I only take out
as much as I need to get by,

00:16:31.866 --> 00:16:34.577
I'm not gonna go
throwing that money away.

00:16:34.619 --> 00:16:37.580
'Cause, hey,
if things go bad someday

00:16:37.622 --> 00:16:39.540
and I gotta check out early,

00:16:39.582 --> 00:16:42.543
I wanna leave you something
to help you get by.

00:16:44.712 --> 00:16:47.882
[SATOKO]
Uncle Teppei?

00:16:47.924 --> 00:16:50.259
When you said you would be
willing to die for me,

00:16:50.301 --> 00:16:51.511
did you mean that?

00:16:51.552 --> 00:16:54.680
Uh... You wouldn't
have to ask me twice!

00:16:54.722 --> 00:16:56.349
If there's anything
I can do for you,

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:59.227
I'm ready to lay down
my life to make it happen!

00:17:02.813 --> 00:17:05.525
[SATOKO] Then do you think
you could come live with me

00:17:05.566 --> 00:17:06.859
in Hinamizawa?

00:17:06.901 --> 00:17:07.818
Huh?

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:09.737
I've been having
a bit of a problem,

00:17:09.779 --> 00:17:11.989
and I could really
use your help with it.

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:23.459
It shouldn't take this long
to pick up groceries.

00:17:29.298 --> 00:17:31.842
So, what did you
need my help with?

00:17:31.884 --> 00:17:33.344
Can you tell me yet?

00:17:33.386 --> 00:17:34.762
Sorry.

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:44.272
I know you haven't
lived in this house

00:17:44.313 --> 00:17:47.942
for a pretty good
while at this point.

00:17:47.984 --> 00:17:49.402
I guess that makes sense.

00:17:49.443 --> 00:17:50.486
Wouldn't want the folks
in the village

00:17:50.528 --> 00:17:53.197
realizing you're out here.

00:18:03.416 --> 00:18:04.792
What the hell
are you lookin' at?!

00:18:04.834 --> 00:18:06.544
[GARDENER]
Uh. Nothing!

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:11.215
[TEPPEI]
C'mon, Satoko. Get inside.

00:18:11.257 --> 00:18:13.801
Okay. Uncle Teppei.

00:18:27.857 --> 00:18:29.859
Thank you for scaring them away.

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.862
I can't stand the way
they stare at me.

00:18:32.903 --> 00:18:36.490
[TEPPEI] No one's gonna
stare at you in here.

00:18:36.532 --> 00:18:38.701
Or hear you, either.

00:18:40.494 --> 00:18:42.204
[SATOKO]
Uncle.

00:18:44.957 --> 00:18:48.919
The truth is, recently,
I've been horribly bullied.

00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:51.589
[gasps]

00:18:51.631 --> 00:18:53.591
I want names! Who is it?!

00:18:53.633 --> 00:18:55.301
Tell me and I'll fix it!

00:18:57.678 --> 00:19:00.222
Tell me so I can
beat their heads in!

00:19:00.264 --> 00:19:01.182
[SATOKO]
Wait.

00:19:01.223 --> 00:19:02.683
Why the hell would I wait?!

00:19:02.725 --> 00:19:05.186
Tell me who's comin'
after you and I swear!

00:19:05.227 --> 00:19:06.228
I'll shut it down!

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:10.024
But it's not
just a single person.

00:19:10.066 --> 00:19:12.443
It's all the people
in Hinamizawa.

00:19:12.485 --> 00:19:15.154
What? All of 'em?

00:19:15.196 --> 00:19:16.989
If you were to beat up
one or two people,

00:19:17.031 --> 00:19:18.616
the rest of the village
would only use it

00:19:18.658 --> 00:19:22.495
as a justification to
treat me even more terribly.

00:19:22.536 --> 00:19:24.997
Why would they do that to you?

00:19:25.039 --> 00:19:27.375
[SATOKO]
You know why.

00:19:27.416 --> 00:19:29.919
My parents were the leaders
of the pro‐dam movement,

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:31.879
and I'm being punished
in their place.

00:19:33.464 --> 00:19:34.965
[TEPPEI]
That was all my brother!

00:19:35.007 --> 00:19:36.342
You weren't part of that mess!

00:19:36.384 --> 00:19:37.635
You were still just a little kid

00:19:37.677 --> 00:19:39.845
when the whole
dam war went down!

00:19:39.887 --> 00:19:43.391
[SATOKO] But I'm a Hojo,
which makes me an enemy.

00:19:43.432 --> 00:19:44.934
And when there's an enemy,

00:19:44.975 --> 00:19:47.019
the whole village
unites against them.

00:19:47.061 --> 00:19:50.022
That's the way things
are done in Hinamizawa.

00:19:54.694 --> 00:19:58.614
The only thing I want is a
quiet life here in the village.

00:19:58.656 --> 00:20:00.658
I want us all to get along

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:04.829
but I don't think that's what
anybody in the village wants.

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:06.872
'Cause I'm their enemy.

00:20:06.914 --> 00:20:09.250
They don't wanna be
neighbors with a Hojo.

00:20:09.291 --> 00:20:12.169
They just wanna
throw rocks at me!

00:20:16.132 --> 00:20:18.342
[TEPPEI] Please...
Please forgive me, Satoko!

00:20:18.384 --> 00:20:21.262
I never had any idea you
were going through this!

00:20:21.303 --> 00:20:23.264
[sobs]

00:20:23.305 --> 00:20:26.350
I'm ashamed I wasn't
around to protect you.

00:20:26.392 --> 00:20:28.936
I'm so sorry!

00:20:28.978 --> 00:20:30.479
[SATOKO]
It's okay.

00:20:30.521 --> 00:20:33.816
You're not the one to blame
for any of it, Uncle.

00:20:33.858 --> 00:20:35.067
All I'll ask.

00:20:35.109 --> 00:20:39.113
Is that you move in here
with me for a little while.

00:20:39.822 --> 00:20:42.074
[SATOKO]
I get so tired sometimes,

00:20:42.116 --> 00:20:44.452
but if I had family
waiting at home,

00:20:44.493 --> 00:20:46.996
it might not be so hard
to get through the day.

00:20:47.037 --> 00:20:49.248
Satoko!

00:20:53.711 --> 00:20:55.588
[EUA chuckles]

00:20:55.629 --> 00:20:56.922
You've chosen
to seek your pleasure

00:20:56.964 --> 00:21:00.384
by soaking in the pity
of those around you, I see!

00:21:01.051 --> 00:21:03.053
[VILLAGER A]
Teppei Hojo's back in town?

00:21:03.095 --> 00:21:04.472
[VILLAGER B]
Yeah, someone spotted him

00:21:04.513 --> 00:21:06.515
outside the family's old house.

00:21:06.557 --> 00:21:08.976
[VILLAGER C] The man's
a good‐for‐nothin' thug.

00:21:09.018 --> 00:21:11.771
What's he doing back
in Hinamizawa now?

00:21:11.812 --> 00:21:13.606
[VILLAGER B] Crossed the
wrong person in Okinomiya

00:21:13.647 --> 00:21:16.567
and had to skip town, I bet,
so we're stuck with him!

00:21:16.609 --> 00:21:18.944
[VILLAGER C] We gotta let
the mayor know about this.

00:21:18.986 --> 00:21:21.655
You think Oryo would step in?

00:21:21.697 --> 00:21:23.115
[VILLAGER A]
The worst part is,

00:21:23.157 --> 00:21:25.993
poor Satoko's
gotta deal with him.

00:21:37.254 --> 00:21:39.507
[SATOKO chuckles]

00:21:45.638 --> 00:21:47.014
[RIKA]
Huh?

00:21:47.807 --> 00:21:49.141
[chuckles]

00:21:49.183 --> 00:21:50.476
Satoko!

00:21:52.728 --> 00:21:53.979
You had me worried.

00:21:54.021 --> 00:21:56.148
Let's hurry up and start dinner!

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:58.150
Rika, wait.

00:21:58.192 --> 00:22:02.279
I only came here to get
all my things packed up.

00:22:02.321 --> 00:22:03.614
My uncle has returned,

00:22:03.656 --> 00:22:06.367
and I'm going to be
moving back in with him.

00:22:08.285 --> 00:22:12.957
[EUA laughs]

00:22:12.998 --> 00:22:15.668
How distraught
the cat must be feeling!

00:22:15.709 --> 00:22:17.294
[laughs]

00:22:17.336 --> 00:22:21.507
My goodness, the two of you
are so very entertaining.

00:23:52.932 --> 00:23:56.560
[RIKA] Next time:
"Tatariakashi‐hen, Part 2."
