[SATOKO]
Hmm?

00:01:04.147 --> 00:01:06.191
Is there something wrong?

00:01:07.985 --> 00:01:09.903
Oh no, everything's fine!

00:01:09.945 --> 00:01:12.531
Ni‐pa!

00:01:18.287 --> 00:01:19.705
[SATOKO]
It doesn't matter how many times

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:21.290
you check the calendar.

00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:22.541
In the end,
you'll have to accept

00:01:22.583 --> 00:01:26.837
in your heart that Hinamizawa
is where you belong.

00:01:26.878 --> 00:01:31.967
Either that or you can
relive June 1983 forever.

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.885

[RENA]
Hey, Dad?

00:03:21.827 --> 00:03:23.078
I'm heading to school.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.997
[RENA'S DAD grunts]
Stay safe.

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:28.041
[graons]

00:03:28.083 --> 00:03:29.543
Do you feel okay?

00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:31.253
Would you like a glass of water?

00:03:31.294 --> 00:03:33.755
Or I could get you
some medicine.

00:03:33.797 --> 00:03:36.049
You don't need
to worry about me.

00:03:36.091 --> 00:03:37.759
I was out drinking in Okinomiya,

00:03:37.801 --> 00:03:40.178
and I might have
overdone it a little bit.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.597
[RENA] Were you
with that Rina lady again?

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.015
[chuckles]

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:46.476
I can't help it;
she's an enchanting woman.

00:03:46.518 --> 00:03:47.561
While we're on the subject,

00:03:47.602 --> 00:03:49.104
I'd really love it
if the two of you

00:03:49.187 --> 00:03:50.647
could finally get
to know one another.

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:52.274
[RENA]
Oh my gosh, look at the time!

00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:54.484
I gotta go, I don't wanna
keep my friends waiting.

00:03:54.526 --> 00:03:57.070
[RENA'S DAD]
Of course.

00:04:09.875 --> 00:04:12.210
[gasps]
Yay, you're here!

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:14.171
Good morning, Keiichi!

00:04:14.212 --> 00:04:16.465
You don't always have
to get here so early.

00:04:16.506 --> 00:04:18.842
It's okay to
sleep in now and then.

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:27.642
Ah. They're here.

00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:29.394
Hey! Get a move on!

00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:31.021
[KEIICHI] Like you don't
make people wait for you

00:04:31.062 --> 00:04:32.063
all the time!

00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:32.939
[RENA]
Hey, Mion!

00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:34.483
Sorry we took so long!

00:04:34.524 --> 00:04:36.067
[MION]
Mornin', Rena.

00:04:41.364 --> 00:04:44.326
It seems like today's trap
is really elaborate, huh?

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:45.327
Why, not at all.

00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:48.371
This is par for the course!

00:04:48.413 --> 00:04:52.709
Layering traps upon traps to
guarantee my prey is ensnared.

00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:55.962
That's exactly what the art
of trap‐setting is all about!

00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:56.797
Clap, clap.

00:04:56.838 --> 00:04:59.633
You're so dedicated
to your craft, Satoko!

00:04:59.758 --> 00:05:01.843
He's here. Stay quiet!

00:05:01.885 --> 00:05:04.513
[KEIICHI] So, you're gonna
put my skills to the test, huh?

00:05:04.554 --> 00:05:06.515
[RENA]
What skills? I don't get it.

00:05:06.556 --> 00:05:07.641
[KEIICHI]
It must have been her.

00:05:07.682 --> 00:05:08.558
Stay back!

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.435
[RENA]
Huh? By "her" you mean.

00:05:10.477 --> 00:05:11.311
[KEIICHI]
Look!

00:05:11.353 --> 00:05:12.604
You're not even
trying to hide it.

00:05:12.646 --> 00:05:14.523
Satoko Hojo!

00:05:17.651 --> 00:05:19.152
[KEIICHI]
Hmph!

00:05:20.195 --> 00:05:21.863
Heh.

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:30.539
Poor, pitiful Keiichi's day
is off to a rough start!

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.958
[SATOKO chuckles]

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:35.919
[KEIICHI]
Satoko!

00:05:39.464 --> 00:05:41.925
[RENA] Thank you for
hanging out with me, today.

00:05:41.967 --> 00:05:43.176
Did you have fun?

00:05:43.218 --> 00:05:44.594
[KEIICHI]
Yeah, it was great!

00:05:44.636 --> 00:05:47.013
I'm kinda bummed
we're all going home now.

00:05:47.055 --> 00:05:49.432
Well, if you don't mind,

00:05:49.474 --> 00:05:51.893
could we make a
quick stop, could we?

00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:53.645
Sure, but where?

00:05:56.731 --> 00:06:01.027
[RENA exhales] What are we gonna
find? What are we gonna find?

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.285
So, you wanted to come
play on a pile of trash?

00:06:08.326 --> 00:06:09.411
It's not trash!

00:06:09.452 --> 00:06:12.247
To me it's a big
mountain of lost treasure!

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:13.164
Oh my gosh.

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:14.749
I hope I find something cute;

00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:17.168
my heart is going
all pitter‐pattery!

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.379
[KEIICHI]
Hey, wait a sec!

00:06:21.882 --> 00:06:25.260
[RENA] It's okay, Keiichi.
You can just wait there!

00:06:25.302 --> 00:06:26.970
[KEIICHI]
Come on.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.732
Cute things, come out.

00:06:38.773 --> 00:06:41.151
Cute things, come out!

00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:43.695
Ah!

00:06:45.989 --> 00:06:47.824
Awoo!

00:06:47.866 --> 00:06:50.702
There's a Kenta‐kun in here!

00:06:50.744 --> 00:06:54.789
Except, how do I get him out?

00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:56.333
Hey, Keiichi!

00:06:56.374 --> 00:06:58.460
Sorry to keep
you waiting up there.

00:06:58.501 --> 00:07:02.297
I'm ready to go
whenever you are!

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:04.674
Tomitake's here?

00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:18.271
Didn't you think
that Kenta‐kun was cute?

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:21.441
Keiichi?

00:07:21.483 --> 00:07:22.776
Are you okay?

00:07:22.817 --> 00:07:25.028
[KEIICHI]
Huh? Oh, I'm fine.

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:26.780
I wanted to get him
back to your place,

00:07:26.821 --> 00:07:29.324
so I'm disappointed.

00:07:29.366 --> 00:07:30.492
Me too.

00:07:30.533 --> 00:07:32.285
If I'd come with you,

00:07:32.327 --> 00:07:34.663
then maybe I could've
grabbed him by the arm

00:07:34.704 --> 00:07:36.915
and yanked him outta
that trash heap!

00:07:36.957 --> 00:07:38.166
You can't do that!

00:07:38.208 --> 00:07:39.000
If you pulled that hard,

00:07:39.042 --> 00:07:41.169
you would've ripped
his arm straight off!

00:07:41.211 --> 00:07:43.088
[gasps]

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:45.256
Yeah, true.

00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:47.467
Having both arms
makes him cuter.

00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:49.636
He'd look sad with just one.

00:07:49.678 --> 00:07:52.681
A‐Anyway, I made you a promise.

00:07:52.722 --> 00:07:54.099
I'm gonna go back
to the dump with you

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.767
and help you get him home!

00:07:55.809 --> 00:07:57.769
Awoo! Thank you!

00:07:57.811 --> 00:08:00.981
I'm so glad you and I get to
take Kenta‐kun home together!

00:08:01.022 --> 00:08:02.148
Awoo!

00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:04.609
[KEIICHI]
All right, see ya.

00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:07.445
[RENA] Mm‐hmm!
See you tomorrow, Keiichi!

00:08:15.996 --> 00:08:17.580
I'm home.

00:08:17.622 --> 00:08:20.834
Huh? Oh.
Hope your day went well.

00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:22.043
Hey, hold on.

00:08:22.085 --> 00:08:24.004
Are you really
heading out this late?

00:08:24.045 --> 00:08:25.714
She called me up
on short notice,

00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:27.632
but I didn't wanna
leave her hanging.

00:08:27.674 --> 00:08:30.468
I'll try to get home at a more
reasonable hour tonight.

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:32.053
You're going to see that woman.

00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:34.639
Huh? Did you just say something?

00:08:34.681 --> 00:08:35.974
[RENA]
Nuh‐uh.

00:08:36.016 --> 00:08:38.101
Be careful. It's dark out.

00:08:38.143 --> 00:08:39.352
Oh, I will.

00:08:39.394 --> 00:08:41.312
Don't you worry about me.

00:08:42.439 --> 00:08:45.358
I'll be back in
a little while, Reina.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.111
Have fun, Dad. See ya.

00:08:56.077 --> 00:08:59.039
[RENA] I shouldn't let
myself get like this.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.624
That was why I took
the "I" out of my name.

00:09:01.666 --> 00:09:04.085
So I could leave all
the ickiness behind me

00:09:04.127 --> 00:09:06.129
and go on living as Rena.

00:09:18.141 --> 00:09:19.517
[RENA]
Hmm?

00:09:20.268 --> 00:09:21.686
Huh?

00:09:40.914 --> 00:09:43.875
[SATOKO chortles]
It's over!

00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:48.088
You know you can never beat me
in a footrace, don't you?

00:09:48.129 --> 00:09:49.005
[RIKA] Maybe not,

00:09:49.047 --> 00:09:51.174
but a scavenger hunt
is much different!

00:09:51.216 --> 00:09:54.427
I may be behind,
but I'm not out of it yet!

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.430
If you say so.

00:09:57.472 --> 00:09:58.306
But, in any case,

00:09:58.348 --> 00:10:00.558
there are no hard
feelings allowed!

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.977
I'll just have
to do my best, then!

00:10:09.609 --> 00:10:11.194
[RENA]
Mi was in charge of hiding it,

00:10:11.236 --> 00:10:12.612
so she probably put it someplace

00:10:12.654 --> 00:10:15.240
Keiichi wouldn't
even know about.

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:18.368
[gasps]

00:10:33.174 --> 00:10:35.176
[gasps]
Rena?

00:10:35.218 --> 00:10:36.928
Keiichi.

00:10:39.973 --> 00:10:40.765
Rika!

00:10:40.807 --> 00:10:42.308
Great minds think alike,

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:45.019
and that's how I knew exactly
where you would be, Satoko!

00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:46.479
Ni‐pa!

00:10:46.521 --> 00:10:48.439
Meaning we're heading
for the same objective,

00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:51.109
which would make this
a footrace, would it not?

00:10:51.151 --> 00:10:54.195
I'm afraid that your
ni‐pas will do you no good.

00:10:59.534 --> 00:11:00.660
Excuse me!

00:11:00.702 --> 00:11:02.162
[RIKA]
Beg your pardon!

00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:08.168
I don't think so!

00:11:09.836 --> 00:11:13.381
[crashing sounds]

00:11:14.382 --> 00:11:15.884
[laughs]

00:11:17.427 --> 00:11:20.180
That sound means
the game is over.

00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:22.307
[SATOKO] You were up
against my traps, after all.

00:11:22.348 --> 00:11:24.976
And there's no shame in
losing to the best, right?

00:11:25.018 --> 00:11:26.728
[chortles]

00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:29.856
Satoko. Don't be a sore winner.

00:11:29.898 --> 00:11:31.691
It doesn't bother me at all.

00:11:31.733 --> 00:11:34.444
That's just how it is
when you lose the game!

00:11:36.738 --> 00:11:39.657
I even got you a present
to celebrate your victory!

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:41.910
I knew you would
understand, Rika!

00:11:41.951 --> 00:11:43.703
Congratulations, Satoko!

00:11:43.745 --> 00:11:45.038
Ni‐pa!

00:11:53.046 --> 00:11:55.131
[SATOKO] Wha‐‐? I don't
even know what happened!

00:11:55.173 --> 00:11:56.174
Look in a mirror.

00:11:56.216 --> 00:11:57.467
You'll see.

00:12:01.346 --> 00:12:03.014
Ah! There's ink on me!

00:12:03.056 --> 00:12:04.682
I wanted to bring
a secret weapon

00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:07.435
so I would have a good way
to counter all of your traps.

00:12:07.477 --> 00:12:09.020
Ni‐pa!

00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:12.106
It's fine. There's
no shame in losing to Rika.

00:12:12.941 --> 00:12:14.275
Rena?

00:12:14.317 --> 00:12:17.403
Sorry, I didn't realize
how tired I was getting.

00:12:17.445 --> 00:12:19.989
Too much fun, I guess.

00:12:20.031 --> 00:12:20.907
Are you okay?

00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:21.866
[RENA]
Mm‐hmm.

00:12:21.908 --> 00:12:25.536
I'll stop by the nurse's
office, but Kenta‐kun...

00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:27.288
No need to worry about that,

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.582
we'll go deal with him
whenever you're feeling better.

00:12:38.841 --> 00:12:41.469
And I suppose I'd better
go wash my face.

00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:43.805
I'd be mortified if anyone
were to see me like this

00:12:43.846 --> 00:12:45.682
out in public

00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:50.353
That's two gone.

00:12:50.395 --> 00:12:52.021
I guess we're done here.

00:13:18.715 --> 00:13:20.174
[SATOKO]
I'm sorry, Rena.

00:13:20.216 --> 00:13:21.884
I didn't want this for you,

00:13:21.926 --> 00:13:26.306
but Rika, in her ignorance,
left me no other choice.

00:13:32.061 --> 00:13:33.730
I promise you, in the end,

00:13:33.771 --> 00:13:36.858
I'll create a Hinamizawa for
you where you can be happy.

00:13:36.899 --> 00:13:38.234
Where we live carefree

00:13:38.276 --> 00:13:41.738
and our lives are full
of smiles and laughter.

00:13:41.779 --> 00:13:43.948
But getting there will hurt.

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:48.578
Terribly, for you,
and everyone around you.

00:13:56.252 --> 00:13:58.338
So please, forgive me.

00:14:10.224 --> 00:14:12.769
Satoko, is that you?

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:16.606
[RENA]
Is somebody here?

00:14:24.572 --> 00:14:26.866
I should get home, shouldn't I?

00:15:07.615 --> 00:15:09.325
I'm home.

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:40.523
[RENA]
This is our savings.

00:15:40.565 --> 00:15:42.233
Dad has been dipping
into the settlement money

00:15:42.275 --> 00:15:43.234
from the divorce,

00:15:43.276 --> 00:15:44.819
but we both swore
we wouldn't touch it

00:15:44.861 --> 00:15:49.073
unless there was
an emergency, so why?

00:15:49.115 --> 00:15:50.825
Why?

00:15:57.248 --> 00:15:59.292
[RENA]
Ahh!

00:16:01.294 --> 00:16:04.881
[RENA'S MOM] Reina?
You remember my friend, right?

00:16:04.922 --> 00:16:06.382
The man who had dinner with us.

00:16:06.424 --> 00:16:08.050
What's his name?

00:16:08.092 --> 00:16:11.387
Uh... Uncle Akihito, wasn't it?

00:16:11.429 --> 00:16:14.056
But if I call him "Uncle,"
he'll bop me on the head!

00:16:14.098 --> 00:16:15.558
[laughs]

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.603
Since you remember him, how do
you feel about Mister Akihito?

00:16:18.644 --> 00:16:20.396
He's mean!

00:16:20.438 --> 00:16:23.024
He's always teasing me
when I talk to him.

00:16:23.065 --> 00:16:24.066
Oh, no.

00:16:24.108 --> 00:16:26.611
That's just his way of showing
you that he likes you.

00:16:26.652 --> 00:16:28.946
You got along so well
at the barbecue!

00:16:28.988 --> 00:16:29.822
[RENA]
Hmmm...

00:16:29.864 --> 00:16:32.283
Well, I guess maybe
he's okay sometimes.

00:16:32.325 --> 00:16:34.535
Maybe.

00:16:35.161 --> 00:16:37.121
[RENA'S MOM]
So, then, Reina,

00:16:37.163 --> 00:16:40.249
between Dad and me,
who do you like better?

00:16:40.291 --> 00:16:42.168
Definitely you,
'cause you take me out

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:44.921
and let me eat
these tasty parfaits!

00:16:44.962 --> 00:16:47.298
And what would you want
to do if things changed,

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:50.301
and your father and I ended up
living in different houses?

00:16:52.929 --> 00:16:56.182
Which one of us would you
prefer to live with?

00:16:56.224 --> 00:16:58.184
Which one?

00:16:58.226 --> 00:16:59.644
But why?

00:16:59.685 --> 00:17:03.272
Because, recently,
I've been thinking of divorcing

00:17:03.314 --> 00:17:07.652
your father and getting married
to Mister Akihito instead.

00:17:07.693 --> 00:17:08.528
[RENA]
Why?

00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:10.947
Why would you want
to break up with Dad?

00:17:14.116 --> 00:17:16.035
It's wrong!
Mom, that's awful!

00:17:16.077 --> 00:17:16.953
You're awful!

00:17:16.994 --> 00:17:18.704
I can't believe you'd do that!

00:17:18.746 --> 00:17:20.748
He's been working
so hard all this time

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:22.250
trying to take care of
everything at home

00:17:22.291 --> 00:17:24.544
and give you the chance
to focus more on your work!

00:17:24.585 --> 00:17:26.587
And you're leaving him for it?

00:17:26.629 --> 00:17:28.673
I hate you!

00:17:28.714 --> 00:17:30.841
[RENA'S MOM]
I'm sorry. It's too late.

00:17:30.883 --> 00:17:33.302
But you haven't told Dad
about any of this yet,

00:17:33.344 --> 00:17:36.138
and that means there's still
time to make it right!

00:17:39.225 --> 00:17:41.644
I can't make it right.

00:17:41.686 --> 00:17:43.980
I'm pregnant.

00:17:48.526 --> 00:17:49.610
[LAWYER]
Then it's settled.

00:17:49.652 --> 00:17:52.196
Keep in mind, the terms specify
that you are not allowed

00:17:52.238 --> 00:17:55.575
to meet with or in any way
contact your ex‐wife.

00:17:55.616 --> 00:17:57.076
And you've agreed to them.

00:17:57.118 --> 00:18:00.246
Meaning you are now
legally bound by them.

00:18:15.052 --> 00:18:17.054
[RENA'S DAD]
Reina?

00:18:17.096 --> 00:18:17.888
[RENA]
Huh?

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:20.850
[RENA'S DAD] Do you know
the man she left me for?

00:18:20.891 --> 00:18:23.519
Yes, I do.

00:18:23.561 --> 00:18:26.522
He's funny and
he gives me candy.

00:18:36.699 --> 00:18:38.326
[cries]

00:18:38.367 --> 00:18:42.121
[RENA'S DAD gasps]
I didn't... Uh...

00:18:42.163 --> 00:18:44.123
Reina. I didn't mean it!

00:18:45.249 --> 00:18:48.210
[RENA] Until then, I'd always
believed that I needed

00:18:48.252 --> 00:18:52.757
to be nice to everybody
all the time no matter what.

00:18:52.798 --> 00:18:54.383
But then I learned.

00:18:54.425 --> 00:18:57.178
I learned that there are
bad people in this world.

00:18:57.219 --> 00:19:00.556
People who don't
deserve kindness.

00:19:00.598 --> 00:19:04.477
And when you're nice to them,
it only gets you hurt.

00:19:06.312 --> 00:19:09.023
Uncle Akihito was a bad person.

00:19:09.065 --> 00:19:10.399
I should've shunned him.

00:19:10.441 --> 00:19:12.234
I should've hated him!

00:19:12.276 --> 00:19:13.736
With all I had!

00:19:13.778 --> 00:19:16.864
I could've scared him away
and we'd still be a family!

00:19:16.906 --> 00:19:20.743
But I didn't try hard
enough to stop him!

00:19:23.412 --> 00:19:27.875
And now it's happening again.

00:19:27.917 --> 00:19:30.419
I have to try harder
and stop the bad person

00:19:30.461 --> 00:19:33.714
tearing my family apart.

00:19:33.756 --> 00:19:35.341
Have to do something.

00:19:35.383 --> 00:19:37.593
There has to be
something I can do.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:56.987
[BARKER]
Got some lovely ladies in here

00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:59.615
who'd love to help you
blow off some steam!

00:19:59.657 --> 00:20:02.952
Hey, no rush,
we're open all night!

00:20:02.993 --> 00:20:05.162
I'm gonna have to stop
you right there, little girl!

00:20:05.204 --> 00:20:06.247
But could I? Um...

00:20:06.288 --> 00:20:08.249
No, you couldn't, for
at least several more years,

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:10.084
so go on home.

00:20:19.885 --> 00:20:22.972
Let's see. A black tea, please.

00:20:27.226 --> 00:20:28.018
[PATRON D]
And she really did it?

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:30.062
[PATRON C]
I'm tellin' ya, she's a freak!

00:20:30.104 --> 00:20:31.313
[PATRON A]
I almost felt bad!

00:20:31.355 --> 00:20:32.982
[PATRON B]
For real?

00:20:35.276 --> 00:20:38.487
What did I think I could do,
coming here by myself?

00:20:43.117 --> 00:20:44.201
[HOSTESS]
You really wanna walk away

00:20:44.243 --> 00:20:47.329
from your best customer, Rina?

00:20:47.371 --> 00:20:49.665
[RINA] What's the difference
if he's passed out drunk?

00:20:49.707 --> 00:20:51.375
Better to let him sleep.

00:20:51.417 --> 00:20:54.253
But I did load up his tab
with expensive drinks.

00:20:54.295 --> 00:20:55.171
And when he wakes up,

00:20:55.212 --> 00:20:58.549
he'll close out and stumble back
to the village, as usual.

00:20:58.591 --> 00:21:00.676
[HOSTESS laughs] You've
seriously got this rube

00:21:00.718 --> 00:21:02.970
shellin' out for drinks
you don't even want.

00:21:03.012 --> 00:21:04.472
Unbelievable.

00:21:04.513 --> 00:21:06.223
[RINA]
Yeah, believe it.

00:21:06.265 --> 00:21:08.768
Turns out his ex‐wife dropped
him a boatload of cash

00:21:08.809 --> 00:21:10.686
in exchange for a clean break

00:21:10.728 --> 00:21:13.189
and he's been dying for
a woman to spend it all on.

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:16.609
[HOSTESS] So, you went out and
hooked yourself a whale, huh?

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:18.152
If you told him
you needed all of it

00:21:18.194 --> 00:21:23.199
to pay your ex to go away,
you think he'd go for it?

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.950
Yeah, probably.

00:21:24.992 --> 00:21:26.452
]gasps]

00:21:26.494 --> 00:21:29.330
[HOSTESS laughs] Your new boy
sounds like a fun one!

00:21:29.371 --> 00:21:31.165
I was half joking,
but if you know a guy

00:21:31.207 --> 00:21:33.083
who'd wanna play the part.

00:21:33.125 --> 00:21:34.877
Ooh.

00:21:35.753 --> 00:21:37.421
Well, that was
a sad‐sounding sigh

00:21:37.463 --> 00:21:40.508
for a woman with a
bottomless bank account.

00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:42.134
The only thing is,

00:21:42.176 --> 00:21:45.179
this guy's still got his teenage
daughter living with him.

00:21:45.221 --> 00:21:47.598
[HOSTESS]
Hmm? What about it?

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:50.226
I'm from a single‐parent
home, you know?

00:21:50.267 --> 00:21:51.435
It's tough.

00:21:51.477 --> 00:21:53.646
I don't need to
make it harder, right?

00:21:53.687 --> 00:21:56.315
[HOSTESS]
Hmm? That's not like you.

00:21:56.357 --> 00:21:58.651
Then how about, "I wanna
pull out before this loser

00:21:58.692 --> 00:22:02.154
and his baggage
start dragging me down"?

00:22:02.196 --> 00:22:05.032
[RENA]
I have to try harder this time.

00:22:07.034 --> 00:22:08.410
I have to do something.

00:22:08.452 --> 00:22:11.038
It can't happen again.

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:12.832
I have to try harder.

00:22:12.873 --> 00:22:14.542
I have to try harder!
