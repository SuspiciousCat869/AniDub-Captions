WEBVTT

00:00:17.226 --> 00:00:19.019
Okay then, that's my shift!

00:00:19.061 --> 00:00:20.354
[STAFF]
We'll see you next time.

00:00:20.395 --> 00:00:22.689
Thanks again for coming
in on such short notice!

00:00:22.731 --> 00:00:24.233
Oh, no prob!

00:02:17.554 --> 00:02:18.597
[CHIE]
Listen, class!

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:20.265
Cooking can be
dangerous business,

00:02:20.307 --> 00:02:22.434
and you could hurt yourself
if you're not careful!

00:02:22.476 --> 00:02:23.852
Remember, you're in class.

00:02:23.894 --> 00:02:25.354
This is part of your studies!

00:02:25.395 --> 00:02:27.105
You must take it seriously!

00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:28.774
[STUDENTS]
Yes, ma'am!

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.111
[KEIICHI] I've never
heard anybody get fired up

00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:34.780
about curry like that.

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:38.158
Ms. Chie puts her heart and soul
into every batch she makes,

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.661
so if I were you,
I wouldn't blow this off.

00:02:40.702 --> 00:02:42.287
It's a cooking
assignment for school.

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.665
Why would she expect more
than the bare minimum?

00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:47.000
[RENA] You shouldn't say
stuff like that out loud!

00:02:47.042 --> 00:02:49.127
It'll be really bad
if she hears you!

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:50.504
Quit being dramatic.

00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:51.463
Curry is junk food,

00:02:51.505 --> 00:02:53.632
no matter how much
care you put into it.

00:02:53.674 --> 00:02:55.759
You can get it anywhere
and it always tastes‐‐

00:03:02.432 --> 00:03:05.310
[CHIE giggles]

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:10.190
Right, time to get serious!

00:03:10.232 --> 00:03:12.359
You see where this
is going, don't you?

00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:14.569
The rest of you should
have figured it out, already!

00:03:14.611 --> 00:03:17.030
Today's club activity
is a curry showdown!

00:03:17.072 --> 00:03:19.116
I think that's a wonderful idea!

00:03:19.157 --> 00:03:21.410
Although my year is doing
the assignment as a group,

00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:23.704
so we'll just be
sending one delegate.

00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:26.581
You better watch out,
'cause my curry is so tasty,

00:03:26.623 --> 00:03:29.501
your brain won't
know how to handle it!

00:03:29.543 --> 00:03:32.129
Damn, and I know Rika's
a pretty good cook, too.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.214
Jeez, no fair, Satoko!

00:03:34.256 --> 00:03:35.841
And I'm great
at making curry, too,

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:38.593
so you shouldn't
expect to beat me either!

00:03:38.635 --> 00:03:41.221
All my opponents
are tough, except one!

00:03:43.557 --> 00:03:44.474
Seriously?

00:03:44.516 --> 00:03:45.684
Ugh, no way!

00:03:45.726 --> 00:03:47.269
[MION]
Heh heh heh.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.647
"No way Mion knows the
first thing about cooking!"

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:53.108
That's what you're
telling yourself, right?

00:04:02.576 --> 00:04:04.745
[KEIICHI] Well, I'm not
gonna let you guys win!

00:04:04.786 --> 00:04:06.288
I learned a thing or
two about cooking back

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.583
when I went camping
with my dad, so get ready!

00:04:12.586 --> 00:04:14.004
This pot is boiling over,

00:04:14.045 --> 00:04:16.882
so shouldn't you hurry up
and take off the lid?

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:18.216
[KEIICHI]
Nice try but I know better than

00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:20.719
to take advice from you, Satoko.

00:04:20.761 --> 00:04:22.345
No matter how much
your rice bubbles up

00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:24.014
and tries to boil over,

00:04:24.055 --> 00:04:26.558
you leave the lid
on till it's done!

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.643
[MION] Whoa.
Kei actually knows something!

00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:31.354
[KEIICHI] That's right. Turn
tail and run, ya little goblin.

00:04:31.396 --> 00:04:33.732
[SATOKO] Well, if that's
how we're doing this.

00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:43.700
Goodness, I seem
to have lost my balance!

00:04:43.742 --> 00:04:45.160
Ah!

00:04:46.536 --> 00:04:49.039
Oh, deary me,
I guess this was open!

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.333
Ah. You ruined it!

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:54.586
What have you done to my curry?

00:04:54.628 --> 00:04:56.087
Why is it this sweet?

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:57.589
[chortles]

00:04:57.631 --> 00:05:00.717
Good luck fixing it
when it's that far along!

00:05:02.511 --> 00:05:04.304
[KEIICHI]
My curry. It's gone.

00:05:04.346 --> 00:05:06.306
Poor, pitiful Keiichi.

00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:10.101
Shed a tear for poor,
pitiful Keiichi!

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:14.272
Darn you, Satoko!

00:05:18.109 --> 00:05:19.069
Well, for what it's worth,

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.530
I'm impressed that you've
stayed upright this long.

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:23.824
[KEIICHI] Kind words won't
do me any good here.

00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:25.867
I need some food in me soon.

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:27.077
[giggles]

00:05:27.118 --> 00:05:28.995
They say hunger
is the best spice,

00:05:29.037 --> 00:05:31.540
so at least dinner
should be extra yummy!

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:33.875
[MION] Well, I gotta
head off to work now,

00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:35.919
so I'll see you
guys later, okay?

00:05:45.637 --> 00:05:46.930
Hey, you.

00:06:08.577 --> 00:06:10.328
[doorbell rings]

00:06:12.747 --> 00:06:14.833
[KEIICHI]
The door is open.

00:06:21.673 --> 00:06:25.010
Hello? Um, good evening.

00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:26.761
Oh no. Are you okay?

00:06:26.803 --> 00:06:28.513
Why are you on the floor?

00:06:34.853 --> 00:06:36.313
[KEIICHI]
Thanks for the food.

00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:37.230
It was awesome.

00:06:37.272 --> 00:06:39.316
[MION splutters]

00:06:44.946 --> 00:06:45.739
Oh right.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.949
I was home alone
last night and starving.

00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:49.868
Then Shion showed up
at my door all of a sudden

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:51.661
with a whole bunch of food.

00:06:51.703 --> 00:06:53.747
She told me to
bring you the containers.

00:06:53.788 --> 00:06:55.373
I cleaned 'em out for you.

00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:57.542
[laughs]
That Shion, right?

00:06:57.584 --> 00:06:59.127
She's such a thoughtful girl.

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:01.004
You certainly
are in high spirits.

00:07:01.046 --> 00:07:03.423
It's easy to see, Miss Mion!

00:07:03.465 --> 00:07:04.716
I think it's cute!

00:07:04.758 --> 00:07:07.385
She's showing her softer side.

00:07:35.997 --> 00:07:38.667
[SHION]
Look at these! They're so cute!

00:07:38.708 --> 00:07:39.834
[KEIICHI]
This place.

00:07:39.876 --> 00:07:43.171
[SHION]
Hey, Kei. If I asked you,

00:07:43.213 --> 00:07:45.715
would you buy me a doll?

00:07:45.757 --> 00:07:46.883
[KEIICHI]
Uh?

00:07:46.925 --> 00:07:49.177
Yeah, why not?

00:07:49.219 --> 00:07:50.512
Excuse me!

00:07:50.553 --> 00:07:52.430
I was hoping I could buy
that doll in the window

00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:53.515
with the pink dress.

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:56.434
[MION]
Yes, sir! Let me get‐‐

00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:57.686
[KEIICHI]
Uh! Mion?

00:07:57.727 --> 00:07:58.728
Wait, Kei?

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:02.273
And that's‐‐ What the
hell are you doing here?

00:08:04.275 --> 00:08:06.403
Now, shall we move on, Kei?

00:08:06.444 --> 00:08:09.072
Our date's not over just yet.

00:08:09.114 --> 00:08:10.532
Hey, hold on a second.

00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:13.410
[SHION]
My sister is hard at work.

00:08:13.451 --> 00:08:16.830
She doesn't need us
interrupting her.

00:08:16.871 --> 00:08:18.248
Sure.

00:08:26.923 --> 00:08:28.842
How could you?

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:34.597
Why, Keiichi?

00:08:43.732 --> 00:08:44.733
Awoo!

00:08:44.774 --> 00:08:46.609
Look how many stalls there are!

00:08:46.651 --> 00:08:48.153
Are we gonna find
something cute?

00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:49.362
Are we?

00:08:51.031 --> 00:08:51.865
[MION]
Hmm?

00:08:51.906 --> 00:08:53.116
Something wrong?

00:08:53.158 --> 00:08:54.951
[KEIICHI]
Oh, no.

00:08:54.993 --> 00:08:57.120
First thing we gotta
do is go see Rika.

00:08:57.162 --> 00:08:59.789
Satoko will probably be nearby.

00:08:59.831 --> 00:09:01.207
Makes sense.

00:09:03.835 --> 00:09:06.504
I only need you to
drive me to the festival.

00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:09.299
You're not escorting me,
understood, Kasai?

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:10.550
[KASAI]
Yes, ma'am.

00:09:10.592 --> 00:09:12.677
but I ask that you stay
aware of your surroundings

00:09:12.719 --> 00:09:14.262
while you're out tonight.

00:09:14.304 --> 00:09:16.514
And what exactly
am I looking out for?

00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:18.767
Hinamizawa can be quite
a dangerous place

00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:20.310
around this time of the year.

00:09:20.351 --> 00:09:21.728
[SHION laughs]

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:24.064
So even the
Shotgun Dragon is afraid

00:09:24.105 --> 00:09:26.149
of a sleepy little
mountain village.

00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:28.026
[KASAI]
That village has a history.

00:09:28.068 --> 00:09:30.361
Whatever demonic kidnappers
might haunt these hills,

00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:33.531
I can hardly see what
they would want with me.

00:09:37.827 --> 00:09:39.996
[KASAI] By the way,
how were you intending

00:09:40.038 --> 00:09:41.748
to return home tonight, ma'am?

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:43.875
Right, that is a good question.

00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:46.044
I guess there's no reason
I couldn't ask my sister

00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:48.421
to let me stay the
night at the mansion.

00:09:48.463 --> 00:09:49.297
Are you positive you want

00:09:49.339 --> 00:09:51.591
to stay there tonight,
of all nights?

00:09:51.633 --> 00:09:52.634
[SHION yawns]

00:09:52.675 --> 00:09:55.512
Please wake me up when
we get to the festival.

00:09:55.553 --> 00:09:57.347
There's a blanket in the
back that you're free to use,

00:09:57.388 --> 00:09:58.640
if you would like.

00:09:58.681 --> 00:10:01.351
However, we won't be
on the road much longer.

00:10:02.102 --> 00:10:04.312
Then let me sleep!

00:10:15.198 --> 00:10:17.033
[MION]
Hey. Where did Kei go?

00:10:17.075 --> 00:10:19.953
Huh? He was with us
until a second ago.

00:10:19.994 --> 00:10:22.956
Well, knowing Keiichi,
I'm guessing he and Shion

00:10:22.997 --> 00:10:25.333
must have wandered
off somewhere together.

00:10:25.375 --> 00:10:28.920
Huh? Yeah. Probably! Heh.

00:10:28.962 --> 00:10:31.965
I hope he knows he's gonna miss
the beginning of Rika's dance.

00:10:32.006 --> 00:10:32.882
[RENA]
Don't worry!

00:10:32.924 --> 00:10:34.259
I'm sure he
would've found a spot

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.760
where he can see the stage!

00:10:35.802 --> 00:10:37.178
[SATOKO]
Certainly.

00:10:38.429 --> 00:10:41.349
[SATOKO] No doubt those two are
enjoying themselves right now.

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:46.312
[TOMITAKE]
It's open.

00:10:46.354 --> 00:10:47.313
[TAKANO]
Thank you!

00:10:47.355 --> 00:10:49.065
It's finally time.

00:10:49.107 --> 00:10:52.360
So? You two are
accessories to the crime.

00:10:52.402 --> 00:10:54.863
No reason not to take
a look now, is there?

00:10:54.904 --> 00:10:56.573
Wha‐‐?! Hey, wait a minute.

00:10:56.614 --> 00:10:58.366
We're just standing here!

00:10:58.408 --> 00:11:00.076
That sounds interesting!

00:11:00.118 --> 00:11:02.328
Kei, let's go.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:06.499
â™ª

00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:01.221
If what you're saying about
the Final Operation is true,

00:12:01.262 --> 00:12:03.348
then we can't
afford to slow down!

00:12:03.389 --> 00:12:04.182
We need to get out of here

00:12:04.224 --> 00:12:06.184
before the Mountain Dogs
pick up our trail!

00:12:06.226 --> 00:12:07.602
We just have
to get to the clinic.

00:12:07.644 --> 00:12:08.603
We can take my car!

00:12:08.645 --> 00:12:09.854
[TOMITAKE]
No, we can't!

00:12:09.896 --> 00:12:12.106
They probably have
a tracker on it already.

00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:13.524
Same goes for my bike.

00:12:18.488 --> 00:12:19.280
I'm sorry to intrude,

00:12:19.322 --> 00:12:21.491
but we need you for
a moment, Mr. Mayor.

00:12:21.532 --> 00:12:24.327
[sighs]
This year too, huh?

00:12:24.369 --> 00:12:26.704
And there goes my evening.

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.290
[OOISHI] I'm gonna need
to fill in some details,

00:12:29.332 --> 00:12:32.001
so you'll be hearing
from me soon.

00:12:32.043 --> 00:12:33.628
Well, would you look at that?

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:35.296
Mayor Kimiyoshi is here.

00:12:35.338 --> 00:12:38.341
Detective. What are
we all doing out here?

00:12:38.383 --> 00:12:39.759
I hope you're not
about to tell me

00:12:39.801 --> 00:12:41.552
someone got demoned away.

00:12:41.594 --> 00:12:43.346
Couldn't tell you for sure.

00:12:43.388 --> 00:12:45.932
but that sure seems
to be a strong possibility.

00:12:45.974 --> 00:12:47.225
What do we know, then?

00:12:47.267 --> 00:12:49.852
[OOISHI] There was an
incident about half an hour ago.

00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:52.355
Tomitake and Takano
ran out of the woods

00:12:52.397 --> 00:12:55.483
and stole one of the mini trucks
that were parked in this lot.

00:12:55.525 --> 00:12:57.860
Huh? They stole
one of our trucks?

00:12:57.902 --> 00:12:58.861
[OOISHI]
Yep.

00:12:58.903 --> 00:13:02.156
We've got plenty of eyewitnesses
to corroborate that part.

00:13:03.074 --> 00:13:03.866
[VILLAGER F]
Hmm?

00:13:03.908 --> 00:13:07.662
That's the nurse from
Doctor Irie's clinic.

00:13:07.704 --> 00:13:08.579
[gasps]

00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:09.539
Over here!

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:10.373
There's a key?

00:13:10.415 --> 00:13:11.457
It's in the ignition!

00:13:11.499 --> 00:13:12.709
Get in on the other side!

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:14.377
I'm gonna get us out of here!

00:13:16.212 --> 00:13:18.298
Hold on, that's my truck!

00:13:20.216 --> 00:13:21.634
Tomitake was that younger fella

00:13:21.676 --> 00:13:24.137
who comes around
from Tokyo, wasn't he?

00:13:24.178 --> 00:13:26.222
But why would he go
and steal a truck?

00:13:26.264 --> 00:13:28.349
[OOISHI] Witnesses said they
seemed to be in a real hurry

00:13:28.391 --> 00:13:30.727
to get wherever they were going.

00:13:30.768 --> 00:13:34.063
Although, it could be
they were running scared.

00:13:34.105 --> 00:13:35.857
They didn't even bother
tossing their belongings

00:13:35.898 --> 00:13:38.026
in the bed before they took off.

00:13:38.067 --> 00:13:40.153
They really didn't
wanna hang around.

00:13:40.194 --> 00:13:41.571
Sounds like it.

00:13:41.612 --> 00:13:43.656
So, then can you
think of anything

00:13:43.698 --> 00:13:45.408
that would get
those two so spooked

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:47.785
that they'd steal a mini truck
and flee the village?

00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:50.163
I've got no idea what
you're trying to get at,

00:13:50.204 --> 00:13:51.122
but the way you're talking,

00:13:51.164 --> 00:13:53.374
I'm guessing you
have some thoughts.

00:13:53.416 --> 00:13:55.335
One or two.

00:13:56.919 --> 00:13:59.630
Were they running from
the curse of Lord Oyashiro?

00:13:59.672 --> 00:14:01.341
Is that some kinda joke?

00:14:01.382 --> 00:14:02.717
[laughs]

00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:04.844
Well, I'm glad
you caught it, Mayor!

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.263
We've got an officer
doing the rounds,

00:14:07.305 --> 00:14:09.807
collecting witness statements,
and we've already picked up

00:14:09.849 --> 00:14:12.393
a few interesting
tidbits here and there.

00:14:12.435 --> 00:14:14.437
It would seem
before the incident,

00:14:14.479 --> 00:14:16.981
our two truck thieves were
spotted hanging around

00:14:17.023 --> 00:14:20.568
with a couple of characters
you might be familiar with.

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:21.402
As a matter of fact,

00:14:21.444 --> 00:14:23.821
I was just about
to go talk with them.

00:14:27.492 --> 00:14:30.953
That way maybe we can
figure out which thread to pull.

00:14:32.955 --> 00:14:33.998
Huh?

00:14:39.212 --> 00:14:40.380
Why'd you come?

00:14:40.421 --> 00:14:43.216
I said I didn't need
an escort, Kasai.

00:14:43.257 --> 00:14:45.802
[KASAI] I wanted to bring
you something, ma'am.

00:14:45.843 --> 00:14:47.637
Then I'll leave immediately.

00:14:49.889 --> 00:14:51.557
For protection.

00:14:54.477 --> 00:14:55.937
I should warn you.

00:14:55.978 --> 00:14:57.855
Be very careful with it.

00:14:59.816 --> 00:15:03.236
It's stronger than
the off‐the‐shelf model.

00:15:03.277 --> 00:15:04.737
So, I see.

00:15:04.779 --> 00:15:06.489
[KASAI] Just brandishing it
at someone should be enough

00:15:06.531 --> 00:15:08.157
to scare them off

00:15:08.199 --> 00:15:10.660
and on the off chance
they keep coming after you,

00:15:10.701 --> 00:15:12.829
they'll think twice
if you buzz it at them.

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:15.706
You were really worried
about me, weren't you?

00:15:15.748 --> 00:15:17.834
Thank you, Kasai.

00:15:17.875 --> 00:15:19.168
Of course.

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:21.504
[SHION] Although, honestly,
I can't imagine anyone

00:15:21.546 --> 00:15:24.173
reaching me through
all this security.

00:15:24.215 --> 00:15:25.633
[KASAI]
It won't hurt to have it.

00:15:25.675 --> 00:15:27.176
Goodnight, ma'am.

00:15:54.203 --> 00:15:57.331
It's been a long while,
Miss Shion Sonozaki.

00:15:57.373 --> 00:15:59.876
I hope you can spare
a minute to talk with me.

00:15:59.917 --> 00:16:01.669
And what is it that
has you out working

00:16:01.711 --> 00:16:04.088
even at this late hour,
Uncle Ooishi?

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:05.423
[OOISHI laughs]

00:16:05.465 --> 00:16:07.300
Funny enough, I've been
trying to get in touch

00:16:07.341 --> 00:16:09.844
with you and your
friend Mr. Maebara!

00:16:09.886 --> 00:16:11.220
[SHION]
Hmm?

00:16:11.262 --> 00:16:13.181
You two were the last
people seen speaking

00:16:13.222 --> 00:16:15.183
to Tomitake and Takano.

00:16:15.224 --> 00:16:17.560
Huh?! The last?

00:16:20.521 --> 00:16:28.488
[phone rings]

00:16:28.529 --> 00:16:30.615
[KEIICHI]
Maebara residence.

00:16:30.656 --> 00:16:33.034
Hello, Kei! This is Shion.

00:16:33.075 --> 00:16:34.785
[KEIICHI]
Why're you calling me so late?

00:16:34.827 --> 00:16:35.745
[SHION]
I was worried whether

00:16:35.786 --> 00:16:38.122
my sister actually
bought your story.

00:16:38.164 --> 00:16:39.415
[KEIICHI]
Well, she realized I was lying

00:16:39.457 --> 00:16:42.043
when I told Rika I'd
been watching her dance,

00:16:42.084 --> 00:16:43.794
but I think she
believed the rest.

00:16:43.836 --> 00:16:45.171
[laughs]

00:16:45.213 --> 00:16:46.255
What a good boy.

00:16:46.297 --> 00:16:48.049
[KEIICHI]
Oh, shut up, Shion.

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:49.717
[SHION]
Also, um,

00:16:49.759 --> 00:16:53.137
there was one more thing
I wanted to ask you about.

00:16:53.179 --> 00:16:56.557
So, at the Watanagashi
festival tonight.

00:16:56.599 --> 00:17:00.061
The four of us all went inside
that storehouse, didn't we?

00:17:07.735 --> 00:17:09.695
[KEIICHI]
What's that supposed to mean?

00:17:09.737 --> 00:17:12.198
[SHION] It means,
they may have been targeted

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:14.242
by Lord Oyashiro's curse.

00:17:14.283 --> 00:17:15.284
[gasps]

00:17:15.326 --> 00:17:17.036
[SHION]
And if that's what happened,

00:17:17.078 --> 00:17:18.621
then you and I know why.

00:17:18.663 --> 00:17:20.414
[KEIICHI] You dragged me
into that stupid storehouse

00:17:20.456 --> 00:17:22.041
on the night of Watanagashi!

00:17:22.083 --> 00:17:23.543
Now you call me in
the middle of the night

00:17:23.584 --> 00:17:25.503
to tell me that
we're both screwed?

00:17:25.545 --> 00:17:28.673
[SHION] I'm sorry. I never
expected it to happen this way.

00:17:28.714 --> 00:17:30.716
[KEIICHI] You were the
one who made it happen!

00:17:30.758 --> 00:17:32.218
So, what now?

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.095
Fix this!

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.848
‐‐[MION] Shion.
‐‐Huh?

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:40.977
[KEIICHI] You messed it up,
so you need to fix it, right?

00:17:41.018 --> 00:17:42.770
Answer me!

00:17:51.571 --> 00:17:53.489
Please wait a second, Mion!

00:17:53.531 --> 00:17:56.909
[MION] Would you care to
explain exactly what's going on?

00:17:56.951 --> 00:17:58.160
[SHION]
I will, I swear!

00:17:58.202 --> 00:17:59.870
This isn't what it sounds like!

00:17:59.912 --> 00:18:02.665
Has Kei been dragged
into Hinamizawa's mess?

00:18:02.707 --> 00:18:06.836
Have you turned him into
a target for the curse?

00:18:06.877 --> 00:18:08.254
That caring boy,

00:18:08.296 --> 00:18:11.757
who's shown nothing but
kindness to everyone here.

00:18:11.799 --> 00:18:14.427
Are you going to get him killed?

00:18:21.434 --> 00:18:26.939
This conversation is
nowhere near over, Shion.

00:18:29.317 --> 00:18:31.444
[SHION]
Stay back!

00:18:31.485 --> 00:18:33.613
Please, stay back!

00:18:40.453 --> 00:18:42.538
You provoked the wrath
of Lord Oyashiro,

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:45.041
and you turned Kei
into his target.

00:18:45.082 --> 00:18:49.170
His life is in danger now
because of what you did.

00:18:49.211 --> 00:18:50.755
Because of you.

00:18:52.423 --> 00:18:53.799
Give him back.

00:18:53.841 --> 00:18:55.843
Give Kei back to me.

00:18:55.885 --> 00:18:57.803
I said stay away!

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:01.974
Who are they planning
to send after him?

00:19:02.016 --> 00:19:04.101
Don't try to tell
me you don't know.

00:19:04.143 --> 00:19:06.228
Did you hear anything
from Kasai?

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:07.438
Nothing.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.857
[MION] Who in the
village gave the order?

00:19:09.899 --> 00:19:11.067
I don't know!

00:19:11.108 --> 00:19:12.902
Grandma did it, right?

00:19:12.943 --> 00:19:14.904
Anytime that the
Three Houses take action,

00:19:14.945 --> 00:19:18.032
she's always the one
pulling their strings.

00:19:18.074 --> 00:19:19.533
[SHION]
I don't know!

00:19:19.575 --> 00:19:22.119
How would I know anything
about any of that?

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:27.541
Mion, whatever
you're doing, please.

00:19:28.501 --> 00:19:30.378
Please, stop!

00:19:32.421 --> 00:19:33.756
[zap]

00:19:40.596 --> 00:19:43.849
[MION] I told you,
we're not done talking yet.

00:19:58.322 --> 00:20:02.201
Please, Mion. No.

00:20:02.243 --> 00:20:03.536
I wish there was
something I could do

00:20:03.577 --> 00:20:06.205
to avoid what comes next.

00:20:14.463 --> 00:20:17.299
But this is the
way it has to be.

00:20:17.341 --> 00:20:18.968
Our sick tradition
has been a stain

00:20:19.009 --> 00:20:23.222
on the soul of
our village for too long.

00:20:23.264 --> 00:20:25.307
As heir to the Sonozaki line,

00:20:25.349 --> 00:20:28.602
I know the evil flowing through
the veins of Hinamizawa.

00:20:28.644 --> 00:20:30.229
This is my duty.

00:20:30.271 --> 00:20:33.065
I have to purge
all the bad blood.

00:20:35.151 --> 00:20:36.569
[MION]
And then...

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:44.577
[MION] Then I'll be sure
that Kei is safe.

00:20:46.579 --> 00:20:48.748
[MION]
I need your help, Shion.

00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:51.041
Please tell me
you're on my side.

00:20:51.083 --> 00:20:53.753
Tell me everything
you know, right now.

00:20:56.630 --> 00:21:02.553
Huh?

00:21:02.595 --> 00:21:04.597
[MION]
Shion?

00:21:08.768 --> 00:21:10.311
Did I just?

00:21:10.352 --> 00:21:11.979
I couldn't have.

00:21:18.319 --> 00:21:21.238
I couldn't have really killed‐‐

00:21:23.491 --> 00:21:27.453
[screams] Shion, I swear,
I didn't mean to!

00:21:27.495 --> 00:21:40.925
[sobs]

00:21:48.432 --> 00:21:50.351
It'll be okay.

00:21:50.392 --> 00:21:52.436
I just have to keep going, now.

00:21:57.358 --> 00:21:58.859
I have to protect Kei.

00:22:07.368 --> 00:22:09.870
[MION] There's something
I need to ask you, Grandma.

00:22:11.539 --> 00:22:13.040
[MION] I remember you
telling me that the curse

00:22:13.082 --> 00:22:16.544
had nothing to do
with the Sonozaki family.

00:22:17.837 --> 00:22:18.629
But this time,

00:22:18.671 --> 00:22:21.590
I know you're going
to tell me the truth.

00:23:53.015 --> 00:23:56.852
[RIKA] Next time:
