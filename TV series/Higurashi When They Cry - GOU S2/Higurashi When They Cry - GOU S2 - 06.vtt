[MION pants]

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:33.492
[MION]
I'm so sorry for this.

00:00:33.534 --> 00:00:36.537
But I have to know you're
telling me the truth.

00:00:36.578 --> 00:00:37.955
Is it you?

00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:40.707
You're the one who's been
manipulating the curse, right?

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:43.418
Using the power
of the three families.

00:00:47.172 --> 00:00:48.632
Grandma?

00:00:53.095 --> 00:00:56.348
Grandma! Please, you're
the only chance I have left.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.476
If you're dead,
how can I stop the curse?

00:00:59.518 --> 00:01:02.145
I need you alive to save Kei!

00:01:02.187 --> 00:01:05.190
No, no, no, no. What can I do?

00:01:07.234 --> 00:01:11.863
[MION] Wait. There are
two more families.

00:01:12.823 --> 00:01:16.076
[phone rings]

00:01:16.118 --> 00:01:17.786
[KIMIYOSHI]
Hello, can I help you?

00:01:17.828 --> 00:01:19.830
[MION]
Uncle Kimiyoshi?

00:01:19.871 --> 00:01:21.331
[KIMIYOSHI]
Is that you, Mion?

00:01:21.373 --> 00:01:23.000
What's the matter?

00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:25.043
[MION]
I'm sorry for calling so late.

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:28.255
Grandma said she has
something urgent to discuss.

00:01:28.297 --> 00:01:31.758
[KIMIYOSHI sighs]
The stolen truck, I'm guessing.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.385
[MION] She said she
needed to talk to you

00:01:33.427 --> 00:01:35.178
about it face to face.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.305
Can you make it?

00:01:36.346 --> 00:01:37.556
[KIMIYOSHI]
Yes, no problem.

00:01:37.598 --> 00:01:41.560
I'll be there shortly,
so let Oryo know I'm on the way.

00:01:41.602 --> 00:01:43.145
I will.

00:01:43.186 --> 00:01:45.439
We'll be right
here waiting for you.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.331
[MION]
Sounds like you're awake.

00:03:30.252 --> 00:03:31.503
Mion, it's you.

00:03:31.545 --> 00:03:33.797
What the hell is this all about?

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:35.257
[MION]
That's good.

00:03:35.298 --> 00:03:39.052
I need somebody who can
talk to me to set things right.

00:03:39.094 --> 00:03:39.886
Huh?

00:03:39.928 --> 00:03:41.763
What are you thinking,
doing something like this?

00:03:41.805 --> 00:03:43.515
[MION]
I have questions for you.

00:03:43.557 --> 00:03:45.267
And as head of one
of the three families,

00:03:45.308 --> 00:03:47.769
you're the only one who
can give me the answers.

00:03:47.811 --> 00:03:48.687
What?

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:50.647
[MION] I already know
the curse is a cover story

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:52.733
dreamed up by
the three families.

00:03:52.774 --> 00:03:55.485
A convenient way to get
rid of inconvenient people.

00:03:55.527 --> 00:03:57.237
Huh? That's horrible!

00:03:57.279 --> 00:03:58.613
Where did you come up with that?

00:03:58.655 --> 00:04:00.824
And Oryo Sonozaki
is the one responsible

00:04:00.866 --> 00:04:02.409
for deciding
who will be targeted

00:04:02.451 --> 00:04:04.244
by the curse each year.

00:04:04.286 --> 00:04:06.913
But is that really
the way it is?

00:04:06.955 --> 00:04:08.290
[KIMIYOSHI]
Who told you it was?

00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:10.876
[MION] Listen,
the Sonozaki family is in charge

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:12.377
of the village now,

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:14.171
but there was a time
when the Kimiyoshi family

00:04:14.212 --> 00:04:16.131
held more power, wasn't there?

00:04:16.173 --> 00:04:16.965
Right.

00:04:17.007 --> 00:04:18.008
Before the war

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.218
and we passed the torch
on to the Sonozakis.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.304
So the Kimiyoshis have
been passing themselves off

00:04:22.345 --> 00:04:24.806
as loyal servants for decades
while using the curse

00:04:24.848 --> 00:04:27.434
for their own ends,
right under Oryo's nose.

00:04:27.476 --> 00:04:29.186
Now, just hold on a damn minute!

00:04:29.227 --> 00:04:31.188
What are you getting at
with all this nonsense?

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:32.272
How many will it be?

00:04:32.314 --> 00:04:34.649
Huh? How many what?

00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:36.485
Last year,
Shion had to sacrifice

00:04:36.526 --> 00:04:39.946
three of her fingernails as
atonement for her wrongdoing.

00:04:41.823 --> 00:04:44.326
How many fingernails are you
ready to lose as atonement

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:46.077
for hiding the truth from me?

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:49.956
[KIMIYOSHI shudders]

00:04:49.998 --> 00:04:51.291
Please, stop this.

00:04:51.333 --> 00:04:52.375
I don't know
what you wanna hear,

00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:54.544
but I'm not hiding anything!

00:04:54.586 --> 00:04:57.756
[MION] You've always been so
kind to me, Uncle Kimiyoshi.

00:04:57.798 --> 00:04:59.424
I really do like you.

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:00.967
[KIMIYOSHI] Then please,
whatever you're doing.

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:02.344
I'll tell you anything I can,

00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:04.346
but you have to stop, Mion!

00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:07.057
[MION]
All I want is to save Kei.

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.393
[MION] Tell me, how do
I call off the order

00:05:10.435 --> 00:05:12.896
to have him demoned away.

00:05:12.938 --> 00:05:15.398
I swear, I don't know
anything about any orders.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.276
But I'll do whatever I can
to help you as mayor!

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:21.071
Even if it means talking
Oryo into something!

00:05:21.112 --> 00:05:23.824
It hurts so much that
I have to do this to you!

00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:26.409
[shudders]

00:05:26.451 --> 00:05:28.703
Please forgive me.

00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:35.252
[KIMIYOSHI screams]

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:46.012
The curse wasn't under Uncle
Kimiyoshi's control either?

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:52.185
Only one more great family.

00:05:57.816 --> 00:05:59.192
[CHIE] Though I'm sure
at least some of you

00:05:59.234 --> 00:06:01.278
have been told
about this already.

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:02.863
Mayor Kimiyoshi has gone missing

00:06:02.904 --> 00:06:05.323
and hasn't been heard
from since yesterday.

00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:07.409
[gasps]

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:08.702
The demons.

00:06:08.743 --> 00:06:11.913
But it doesn't seem like
the curse happened this year.

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:16.960
[GIRL A]
Heads up!

00:06:17.002 --> 00:06:18.378
‐‐[SATOKO] Get ready!
‐‐[GIRL A] Do your worst!

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.880
Please tell the truth.

00:06:19.921 --> 00:06:22.173
Last night,
did you do something bad?

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:24.342
[KEIICHI gasps]

00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:28.471
Keiichi, do you not remember
what happened last night?

00:06:31.308 --> 00:06:32.350
Rika.

00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:35.478
You wanna hear a kitty story?

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:39.065
But when they did
the kitties all got scared

00:06:39.107 --> 00:06:40.692
when they saw what was inside.

00:06:40.734 --> 00:06:43.987
Then, they heard they might be
cursed just for looking.

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:47.699
And later, two of those kitties
disappeared in the night.

00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:49.576
So please, Rika.

00:06:49.618 --> 00:06:51.453
The two that're left.

00:06:51.494 --> 00:06:53.914
What can they do now?

00:06:53.955 --> 00:06:56.875
[RIKA laughs]

00:06:56.917 --> 00:06:59.169
Why would you bother
with that flimsy pretext

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.838
when you're clearly
dying to confess?

00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:05.800
It's not an issue.

00:07:05.842 --> 00:07:09.262
You have absolutely
nothing to worry about.

00:07:09.304 --> 00:07:12.307
If only you'd thought
to worry a little bit sooner,

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:14.517
maybe it wouldn't
have come to this.

00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:16.227
But the curse this year.

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:17.520
Your whole world.

00:07:17.562 --> 00:07:20.815
You've already thrown
everything away.

00:07:20.857 --> 00:07:22.859
Do you understand you
could have avoided all this

00:07:22.901 --> 00:07:25.403
if you'd just stayed
and watched me dance?

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:27.614
But instead, you
snuck off to the toolshed

00:07:27.656 --> 00:07:29.783
violated a sacred space.

00:07:29.824 --> 00:07:33.370
And on the night of
Watanagashi, at that.

00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:36.289
The last great
family's responsible.

00:07:36.331 --> 00:07:38.583
Now I understand everything.

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:40.794
Rika Furude is the one
who's really in control

00:07:40.835 --> 00:07:43.088
of Lord Oyashiro's curse!

00:07:44.923 --> 00:07:45.966
Hey, Keiichi!

00:07:46.007 --> 00:07:48.301
There's always better things
to do than sit around.

00:07:48.343 --> 00:07:50.011
Grab the ball that just hit you.

00:07:50.053 --> 00:07:51.805
You can come join our game.

00:07:51.846 --> 00:07:53.848
It's time for super deadly
sludge 'n' slaughter

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:56.726
electric razor wire
trench warfare dodgeball!

00:07:56.768 --> 00:07:58.269
Huh? I guess.

00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:01.856
[RIKA]
Keiichi?

00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:04.776
[giggles] Why don't you
play with Satoko?

00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:22.877
Rika.

00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:24.337
[gasps]

00:08:24.379 --> 00:08:26.381
Mi?

00:08:26.423 --> 00:08:28.466
Is something wrong, Mion?

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:31.302
[MION]
My heart is breaking right now.

00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:34.681
I really didn't wanna
think it could be true.

00:08:38.935 --> 00:08:41.771
[MION] I understand that it
wasn't what you wanted.

00:08:41.813 --> 00:08:43.565
I know you've only been
fulfilling your duty

00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:46.276
as head of the Furude family.

00:08:46.317 --> 00:08:47.736
I'm so sorry.

00:08:47.777 --> 00:08:49.988
Forgive me!

00:08:55.577 --> 00:08:57.245
When all of this is over.

00:08:57.287 --> 00:09:00.665
I'll join the
rest of you, I swear!

00:09:11.301 --> 00:09:15.221
But for now, I still
have to keep Kei safe.

00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:19.225
[CHIE] All right everybody,
time for class!

00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:22.187
That's odd.

00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:24.439
Where's Ms. Furude?

00:09:26.608 --> 00:09:28.359
She would never be this tardy.

00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:30.987
Has anybody seen
her since lunch, kids?

00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:33.948
[SATOKO]
Keiichi.

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:34.991
I believe that you and Rika

00:09:35.033 --> 00:09:37.368
were talking at lunch,
weren't you?

00:09:41.247 --> 00:09:42.373
[KEIICHI]
Uh. Yeah.

00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:44.459
We talked a little
before you showed up,

00:09:44.501 --> 00:09:47.170
but then, she was gone.

00:09:47.212 --> 00:09:51.341
Actually, I think I saw her
behind the school with someone.

00:09:51.382 --> 00:09:52.675
Huh?

00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:55.512
And this was somebody
other than Keiichi?

00:09:56.763 --> 00:09:59.015
I couldn't see the guy
she was talking to.

00:09:59.057 --> 00:09:59.849
[KEIICHI]
Who was it?

00:09:59.891 --> 00:10:03.853
Uh. It was a man dressed
like a construction worker.

00:10:03.895 --> 00:10:05.480
[SATOKO]
That seems strange.

00:10:05.522 --> 00:10:08.274
Why would a
construction worker be here?

00:10:11.027 --> 00:10:12.612
[MION]
Rika!

00:10:12.654 --> 00:10:13.613
Rika!

00:10:13.655 --> 00:10:15.907
Shout if you can hear us!

00:10:27.377 --> 00:10:29.462
‐‐The heck?
‐‐[MION] Over here, Kei!

00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:32.507
[KEIICHI]
What'd you find?

00:10:32.549 --> 00:10:34.050
[MION] I think there's
something on the roof!

00:10:34.092 --> 00:10:36.261
Huh? Up there?

00:10:36.302 --> 00:10:38.388
I'm gonna take a look. Hang on!

00:11:43.161 --> 00:11:44.329
That should stall anyone trying

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:46.706
to carry out
the curse for a while.

00:11:46.748 --> 00:11:48.249
But I need to get Kei
to a safe place,

00:11:48.291 --> 00:11:50.376
now, while I have the chance!

00:11:53.171 --> 00:11:55.381
[RENA] What's up, Keiichi?
What's wrong?

00:11:55.423 --> 00:11:59.177
It's my fault. All of it.

00:11:59.219 --> 00:12:01.471
[RENA]
Why would you say that?

00:12:01.512 --> 00:12:03.473
What makes you
think it's your fault?

00:12:03.514 --> 00:12:05.475
Can you talk about it?

00:12:05.516 --> 00:12:06.684
[KEIICHI]
Hmmm...

00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:08.978
Well.

00:12:11.606 --> 00:12:14.275
Sorry. Not right now.

00:13:03.533 --> 00:13:05.243
[splash]

00:13:10.665 --> 00:13:12.709
[phone rings]

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:14.002
[KEIICHI]
Who is it?

00:13:14.043 --> 00:13:15.753
[MION]
Hi, Kei.

00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:18.506
[KEIICHI]
Shion, I‐‐

00:13:18.548 --> 00:13:21.342
Uh! No. Wait.

00:13:21.384 --> 00:13:23.177
Is this Mion?

00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:26.306
I want you to come
over here right now.

00:13:32.437 --> 00:13:34.439
[CHIE]
Please find Ms. Furude for us.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.274
Thank you so much.

00:13:40.528 --> 00:13:41.779
Ms. Hojo?

00:13:41.821 --> 00:13:44.324
I didn't realize you
were still here at school.

00:13:44.365 --> 00:13:46.242
Did the police have anything
new to share with you

00:13:46.284 --> 00:13:49.078
about Rika's disappearance?

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:49.996
They gave me their word

00:13:50.038 --> 00:13:52.457
that they'll do everything
they can to help her.

00:13:52.498 --> 00:13:54.542
Do they have a lead on
where she might be?

00:13:54.584 --> 00:13:56.961
I understand that
you're worried about her,

00:13:57.003 --> 00:13:59.297
but everything is
going to be okay.

00:13:59.339 --> 00:14:01.591
We just have to be patient.

00:14:01.632 --> 00:14:04.135
But is there some way
I can help her?

00:14:04.177 --> 00:14:06.304
[CHIE]
You can go home and rest up,

00:14:06.346 --> 00:14:07.513
and when she comes back,

00:14:07.555 --> 00:14:09.891
you'll be there waiting
for her with a big smile.

00:14:09.932 --> 00:14:13.019
I suppose that is the
best thing I can do right now.

00:14:13.061 --> 00:14:14.771
And I'm sure she's
going to play it all off

00:14:14.812 --> 00:14:16.481
like nothing happened.

00:14:16.522 --> 00:14:18.608
Right. Sounds like her.

00:14:22.445 --> 00:14:25.073
[SATOKO]
Please track her down quickly.

00:14:25.114 --> 00:14:29.494
Her disappearing is
the worst‐case scenario.

00:14:29.535 --> 00:14:30.787
Though perhaps the quickest way

00:14:30.828 --> 00:14:33.664
to go about this is
to ask directly.

00:14:36.584 --> 00:14:38.586
I know you're nervous right now.

00:14:38.628 --> 00:14:40.922
Trust me, I get it.

00:14:40.963 --> 00:14:42.507
Don't worry.

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:46.135
[gasps]

00:14:46.177 --> 00:14:47.011
Come on.

00:14:47.053 --> 00:14:49.013
We'll talk at my place.

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:53.601
Mion Sonozaki has just now

00:14:53.643 --> 00:14:56.229
made contact
with Keiichi Maebara.

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:59.273
They're approaching
the Sonozaki estate.

00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:00.775
[OOISHI]
This is Ooishi.

00:15:00.817 --> 00:15:01.859
Join up with the detectives

00:15:01.901 --> 00:15:04.112
surrounding the
Sonozaki property.

00:15:04.153 --> 00:15:06.864
Continue surveillance
from there.

00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:08.533
[WORKER]
Yes, sir.

00:15:08.574 --> 00:15:09.909
[KUMATANI] So, you think
the Sonozaki family

00:15:09.951 --> 00:15:12.829
has some involvement in the
Mayor's situation as well?

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:14.038
[OOISHI]
According to his family,

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.707
Oryo called him over shortly
before he went missing,

00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:18.793
and he hasn't been
sighted anywhere since.

00:15:18.835 --> 00:15:21.963
And has anybody been able to get
Oryo's side of that story yet?

00:15:22.004 --> 00:15:23.005
She wouldn't meet with us,

00:15:23.047 --> 00:15:24.799
but we did get
to enjoy a brief chat

00:15:24.841 --> 00:15:26.259
with her granddaughter Mion.

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.262
She said Kimiyoshi headed
home after they talked.

00:15:29.303 --> 00:15:31.389
[KUMATANI]
You think she was lying, then?

00:15:31.431 --> 00:15:33.933
Hell, who could say?

00:15:33.975 --> 00:15:35.810
If she was, it would
imply that the Mayor

00:15:35.852 --> 00:15:39.355
is still out here on the
Sonozaki property somewhere.

00:15:39.397 --> 00:15:40.982
Are we gonna move in?

00:15:41.023 --> 00:15:42.400
[OOISHI]
On the Sonozaki mansion,

00:15:42.442 --> 00:15:44.360
based on what we know right now?

00:15:44.402 --> 00:15:45.361
Not a chance.

00:15:45.403 --> 00:15:49.073
We could turn this
place into a warzone.

00:15:49.115 --> 00:15:51.659
Now, if we were
to find probable cause.

00:15:51.701 --> 00:15:53.369
That's why we're staked out?

00:15:53.411 --> 00:15:55.079
[OOISHI chuckles]

00:15:55.121 --> 00:15:57.248
The second we hear something
that sounds like a scream,

00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:59.125
our guys are prepared
to breach the gate

00:15:59.167 --> 00:16:01.794
and move in hard and fast.

00:16:01.836 --> 00:16:04.255
[KEIICHI]
That is a really big gate.

00:16:04.297 --> 00:16:05.756
[MION]
Come in.

00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:18.102
[KEIICHI]
Please, tell me.

00:16:18.144 --> 00:16:20.188
The deaths during Watanagashi.

00:16:20.229 --> 00:16:21.772
Why do they keep happening?

00:16:21.814 --> 00:16:24.484
Why did all those
people have to die?

00:16:36.662 --> 00:16:37.663
There's more here?

00:16:37.705 --> 00:16:39.290
What is this?

00:16:46.088 --> 00:16:47.673
[MION]
We're near the end.

00:16:47.715 --> 00:16:49.300
My uncle's safe room.

00:16:49.342 --> 00:16:52.303
It's the most secure
place on our property.

00:16:54.263 --> 00:16:55.556
[STAFF]
Movement near the front gate,

00:16:55.598 --> 00:16:58.476
but it's not anyone
we've been following.

00:16:58.518 --> 00:16:59.894
[OOISHI]
What's going on?

00:16:59.936 --> 00:17:02.438
[STAFF]
It appears to be a visitor.

00:17:03.981 --> 00:17:06.025
I still don't know what you're
planning to do out there,

00:17:06.067 --> 00:17:07.818
but whatever it is,

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:09.070
I wanna help you, Mion!

00:17:09.111 --> 00:17:10.530
Just tell me what I can do!

00:17:10.571 --> 00:17:14.033
We're both on the
same side here, remember?

00:17:14.075 --> 00:17:18.287
You know, that one time,
we were at the game tournament,

00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:20.540
and you gave me that doll.

00:17:20.581 --> 00:17:24.293
You looked at me
like I was just a normal girl.

00:17:24.335 --> 00:17:26.254
I was happy.

00:17:26.963 --> 00:17:30.967
I'm doing this 'cause
I love you, understand?

00:17:31.008 --> 00:17:33.302
I promise to protect you!

00:17:33.344 --> 00:17:35.263
But you won't be safe
until I've put an end

00:17:35.304 --> 00:17:38.391
to this sick ritual permanently!

00:17:38.432 --> 00:17:40.059
Mion.

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:46.065
[alarm blares]

00:17:49.986 --> 00:17:51.487
Is there somebody here?

00:17:51.529 --> 00:17:54.574
[MION] Hah.
They've sent someone after me.

00:17:54.615 --> 00:17:55.825
[gasps]

00:17:55.866 --> 00:17:58.619
[MION]
It's possible they've caught on.

00:18:00.871 --> 00:18:02.164
Well, that's fun.

00:18:02.206 --> 00:18:03.749
I should greet them.

00:18:03.791 --> 00:18:05.876
No, wait. Please don't go!

00:18:05.918 --> 00:18:07.712
[MION]
Excuse me, Kei.

00:18:07.753 --> 00:18:10.047
Looks like I have
a guest to entertain.

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:20.808
I've been waiting here
for quite some time now.

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:21.684
[laughs]

00:18:21.726 --> 00:18:24.061
Sorry, the intercom
was hard to hear.

00:18:24.103 --> 00:18:26.105
What brings you out this way?

00:18:26.147 --> 00:18:29.650
[SATOKO] Your family's
generous offer of soy sauce.

00:18:29.692 --> 00:18:31.611
I received a notice about it.

00:18:31.652 --> 00:18:32.862
Soy sauce?

00:18:32.903 --> 00:18:36.198
Right, that must be
something Grandma set up.

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.825
Is it still valid?

00:18:37.867 --> 00:18:39.702
I was beside myself
with anticipation

00:18:39.744 --> 00:18:42.246
for the whole trip over.

00:18:42.288 --> 00:18:44.040
Of course, come on in.

00:18:44.081 --> 00:18:47.918
Mion Sonozaki is inviting Satoko
Hojo in at the front gate now.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.129
[OOISHI]
Do you see Keiichi Maebara?

00:18:50.171 --> 00:18:52.423
[STAFF] No sign of him
from our position.

00:18:52.465 --> 00:18:53.382
[OOISHI]
People keep going in,

00:18:53.424 --> 00:18:55.843
but none of 'em seem
to be coming out.

00:18:55.885 --> 00:18:58.137
If the Mayor really
is still in there,

00:18:58.179 --> 00:19:00.014
what could the
Sonozakis be doing?

00:19:00.056 --> 00:19:01.891
[OOISHI]
Hmm. Team! Hold your position

00:19:01.932 --> 00:19:03.309
and prepare
to storm the property

00:19:03.351 --> 00:19:05.603
at the first sign
of suspicious activity!

00:19:05.645 --> 00:19:08.189
I'm going to join
you over at the scene!

00:19:14.278 --> 00:19:15.655
Dammit!

00:19:26.624 --> 00:19:27.833
[MION]
Hey, Satoko.

00:19:27.875 --> 00:19:29.126
[SATOKO]
What is it?

00:19:29.168 --> 00:19:31.420
[MION] Who exactly
told you to come here?

00:19:31.462 --> 00:19:33.923
[SATOKO] I mentioned the
notice about the soy sauce.

00:19:33.964 --> 00:19:35.841
[MION] So, you came
to fill up on soy sauce

00:19:35.883 --> 00:19:37.718
with your best friend
still missing?

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.721
I'm surprised that word hadn't
already gotten back to you.

00:19:40.763 --> 00:19:42.640
As it turns out,
Rika had been hiding,

00:19:42.682 --> 00:19:44.308
and she came out after you left.

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:46.519
Oh, is that what happened?

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.646
[SATOKO] It seems
she wanted to give us a scare

00:19:48.688 --> 00:19:50.606
and went a bit
overboard with it,

00:19:50.648 --> 00:19:55.653
but in the end, there's
nothing to be concerned about.

00:19:55.695 --> 00:19:58.322
[MION] I'm going to
ask you one more time.

00:19:58.364 --> 00:20:01.367
And you're not going to
feed me any more of your lies.

00:20:01.409 --> 00:20:04.328
Who told you to come out
to the Sonozaki estate?

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:05.496
Goodness.

00:20:05.538 --> 00:20:07.498
Your reaction to hearing
Rika was found safe

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:11.085
almost makes me think you have
reason to believe otherwise.

00:20:11.127 --> 00:20:13.963
Yes, I have a very good reason.

00:20:14.004 --> 00:20:16.465
Wanna hear it?

00:20:16.507 --> 00:20:18.926
[SATOKO]
Thank you, I'd love to.

00:20:18.968 --> 00:20:21.011
[MION] Then tell me
what I wanna know first!

00:20:21.053 --> 00:20:22.471
Who's in charge?

00:20:22.513 --> 00:20:24.640
Who in the village
is giving the orders?

00:20:24.682 --> 00:20:27.810
I know they're targeting Kei,
and I have to stop them!

00:20:27.852 --> 00:20:32.314
[SATOKO]
Right, so where is Rika?

00:20:32.356 --> 00:20:33.816
Is she still alive?

00:20:33.858 --> 00:20:37.695
Ugh! If you're not
gonna give me an answer...

00:20:39.363 --> 00:20:41.115
[gunshot]

00:20:49.874 --> 00:20:52.710
How? Where did‐‐

00:20:56.255 --> 00:20:58.090
[SATOKO chuckles]

00:20:58.132 --> 00:20:59.550
Where is Rika?

00:20:59.592 --> 00:21:02.386
[MION]
Satoko!

00:21:03.596 --> 00:21:04.847
Sorry for that.

00:21:04.889 --> 00:21:07.933
I'm sure I'm a far better shot
than you were expecting.

00:21:09.435 --> 00:21:11.937
But of course,
I have you to thank for it.

00:21:11.979 --> 00:21:13.397
It's no exaggeration to say

00:21:13.439 --> 00:21:14.607
I could never have managed this

00:21:14.648 --> 00:21:17.443
without the firearms training
you gave me, Mion.

00:21:17.485 --> 00:21:19.236
[MION]
Satoko!

00:21:19.278 --> 00:21:20.738
You little‐‐

00:21:23.073 --> 00:21:25.409
[SATOKO] I'd like you
to answer my question now.

00:21:26.577 --> 00:21:27.411
[MION yelps]

00:21:27.453 --> 00:21:29.371
Tell me where to find Rika.

00:21:29.413 --> 00:21:33.083
[MION cackles]
You're too late.

00:21:33.125 --> 00:21:35.753
Your little friend
is already rotting!

00:21:35.795 --> 00:21:37.838
How ya like that, bitch?

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:40.508
[SATOKO] Then you're
entirely sure she's dead?

00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:43.594
I felt the life draining out
of her as I wrung her neck,

00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:46.764
and I hope for her sake I
finished the job then and there.

00:21:46.806 --> 00:21:49.642
'Cause I stuffed her in
the septic tank after that!

00:21:49.683 --> 00:21:52.353
So, if she was still alive
when I got done with her,

00:21:52.394 --> 00:21:55.022
she died choking on
our classmates' shit!

00:21:55.064 --> 00:21:56.065
[laughs]

00:21:56.106 --> 00:21:57.900
Thank you.
That's good to hear.

00:21:57.942 --> 00:21:59.360
[MION]
Huh?

00:22:01.237 --> 00:22:04.031
[SATOKO] You painted quite the
vivid picture of her death.

00:22:04.073 --> 00:22:07.409
I have no doubt it
happened just as you say.

00:22:07.451 --> 00:22:10.454
I'll see you again very soon.

00:22:11.914 --> 00:22:13.374
[SATOKO]
Rika.

00:23:53.057 --> 00:23:56.435
[RIKA] Next time:
"<i>Tatariakashi‐hen</i>, Part 1."
