1
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:45,291
Thanks hon...

2
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:54,125
Excuse me, what are you eating?

3
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:55,291
You mean to tell
me you don't know

4
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:56,916
what Soba noodles are?

5
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,208
Huh.

6
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:00,833
I would like to
try some of these...

7
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:02,208
Noodles.

8
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:09,333
What's wrong with him?

9
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:10,750
Mister Krory here...

10
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:13,500
He wanted to try Soba
noodles but he did it all wrong.

11
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:15,125
He thought the
won ton was bread...

12
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:18,375
...the dipping sauce, soup...
and the noodles, Italian pasta!

13
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:19,916
He ate each of them separately,

14
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,666
and then had the smart idea
to eat a mouth full of wasabi...

15
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:27,666
It was the worst food
I had ever tasted in my life!

16
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:31,583
Kanda you should have taught
him how to eat it correctly.

17
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:35,000
I don't have time to babysit,
unlike you apparently.

18
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,375
You're done eatin' already...?

19
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:41,125
Do you have an
assignment to get to?

20
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:43,583
I'm heading to Denmark
on a mission soon.

21
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:45,500
Well at least
you're staying busy, Yu.

22
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:49,041
How many times have I told you
not to call me by that name?

23
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,458
Woah there...

24
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:51,916
Speaking of missions, hey Allen!

25
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,208
I ran into Chief Komui earlier

26
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:55,041
and he said he
wanted to see you.

27
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:56,291
Yeah...?

28
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:57,916
Maybe the Chief's got
a mission for me too...

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,750
Huh.

30
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:06,583
You want me to
act as a courier...?

31
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,000
So I guess there's no mission?

32
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,416
Yeah...

33
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,916
Sorry to throw this on you
so soon after your return

34
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,375
but I need you to deliver
this to General Yeegar.

35
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:15,666
And he can be found
somewhere in the Netherlands.

36
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,250
He's the oldest of all
the Black Order Generals,

37
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,791
however he's a born soldier

38
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:25,000
who's spent his entire
career on the front line.

39
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:26,791
Uh, uh...

40
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:29,125
Would you mind if
I asked you a question...?

41
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,083
This General Yeegar, is
he an eccentric person,

42
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:32,666
like my old master?

43
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,583
Gee uh... I'm not sure...

44
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:36,791
The one thing I know is

45
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,500
he's very particular
about proper manners.

46
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:41,458
So you may want to
study up on your etiquette.

47
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:52,125
I really don't want
to go on this trip...

48
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:53,750
Why'd he have to pick me?

49
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,291
Why have you sent Allen Walker

50
00:03:57,375 --> 00:04:00,625
on a simple courier
mission to General Yeegar?

51
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:04,083
The General sent me a request
to see Allen a few days ago...

52
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:07,041
He said he wanted to see the boy
who was prophesized by Hevlaska

53
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:09,750
as the Destroyer of Time
with his own eyes.

54
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,000
I see...

55
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,875
I guess we can assume
the General is becoming

56
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,916
concerned about his own future?

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,291
Yes... and... about
Allen's left eye as well.

58
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,791
He's worried the Earl
may act against it...

59
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:24,541
and then, the one who
stands to lose the most

60
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,958
would be Allen as a consequence.

61
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,458
It's gotten darker.

62
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:40,583
And it's looking more

63
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,541
and more like the
marking of an Akuma.

64
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:43,916
I used to believe
that having an eye

65
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,375
like Allen's would be a
huge advantage in our fight.

66
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,208
But I just think back
to the day I saw the soul

67
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:53,166
of an Akuma in person and I
gotta say, it's not worth it...

68
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,000
It was tough to look at.

69
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,125
The sight of it
turned my stomach

70
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:02,375
so bad I couldn't keep
food down for days...

71
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:09,416
The world Allen
sees every day... is hell.

72
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:20,541
Someone's supposed to meet me

73
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:23,916
at this station but how
long is that going to take?

74
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,583
You must be Allen Walker.

75
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:27,583
Hi.

76
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:28,541
Nice to meet you.

77
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,000
My name is Thierry.

78
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,166
I'm a Finder with the unit
assigned to General Yeegar.

79
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,666
So Thierry, I guess you
know who I am already...

80
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,666
Thanks for coming out
this way to pick me up.

81
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,875
I appreciate it...

82
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,166
I'm on a courier mission.

83
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,000
Chief Komui back at
Headquarters instructed me

84
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,708
to give this over
to General Yeegar.

85
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,458
Oh dear... I'm terribly
sorry to inform you

86
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:47,291
but the General
is no longer here.

87
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:48,708
Huh?

88
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:51,208
He made his way towards Belgium
the other day the moment

89
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,583
he heard there was innocence
discovered in the area.

90
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,958
Belgium, well... uh...

91
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:59,041
The border's not
too far from here.

92
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,125
The train isn't coming, is it?

93
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:10,583
Well, let's just say it's
not coming any time soon...

94
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:12,875
I'd give it another
two hours or so.

95
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:16,625
So... Chief Komui told me that

96
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:19,833
the General is strict when
it comes to manners.

97
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,291
Do you find that to be the case?

98
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,500
Yeah sure, I mean
sometimes he can be

99
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,833
a stickler for table manners
and proper language,

100
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:29,291
but I've worked
around him long enough

101
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,333
to know he's a really nice guy.

102
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:32,375
What...?

103
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,750
He's a nice guy...?
The General?!

104
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:37,458
Um... why the sudden outburst?

105
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,458
Oh, Forgive me...

106
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,208
It's just that I have
trouble equating the words

107
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:45,333
nice guy when talking about a
General of any kind, that's all.

108
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:46,541
Help...

109
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,041
I'd rather lose a thumb
than go back there!

110
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,833
General Yeeger is a
genuine and kind leader...

111
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:53,375
He knows a wide
variety of subjects...

112
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,750
and he teaches us about them.

113
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,916
For instance, do
you know the species

114
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,625
of this particular butterfly?

115
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:00,708
No.

116
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:04,458
This one is a form
of Nymphalidae...

117
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:07,500
It's commonly found in
Europe, and western Asia.

118
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,791
And General Yeegar
taught you about that?

119
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:13,083
Yes, it's one of the many
things he's taught us.

120
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,541
How should I put it...

121
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:17,583
The General acts as somewhat
of a mentor to us all...

122
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,125
I've heard that before
he joined the Order

123
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:23,416
he taught young children,
so maybe it's natural for him.

124
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,375
He sounds like a
really great guy...

125
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,291
I look forward to
meeting with him.

126
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,291
So there's Innocence
in this town?

127
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:42,125
Yes, we're absolutely
certain there's Innocence

128
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:43,666
somewhere within the city...

129
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,416
However the location
of General Yeegar

130
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,416
is still somewhat up in the air.

131
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,250
It's too bad there's no one here
to ask if they've seen him.

132
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,166
Listen Thierry...

133
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,041
We need to contact
General Yeegar right away.

134
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:57,916
Why?

135
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,250
If he's still within the city,

136
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,208
the wireless Golem should
be able to reach him...

137
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:02,208
Grab it.

138
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:03,666
That's... a problem...

139
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,958
General Yeegar doesn't
have a Golem anymore.

140
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,333
Huh?

141
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:09,916
I'm afraid his Golem
stopped working recently

142
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,375
and he never got a new one...

143
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:12,791
I was hoping
perhaps the contents

144
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:15,416
of that case of yours
has a replacement.

145
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,458
Do we have another
way of contacting him?

146
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,250
No, not from here...

147
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:23,791
though if he
contacted headquarters

148
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:26,375
since we've left he may have
notified them of his position,

149
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,833
in which case we can use
that to track him down.

150
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,958
We don't have time
to contact headquarters,

151
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:33,250
which is why I think we should
continue our search on foot,

152
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:34,875
at least for the time being.

153
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,625
Why are you acting so aggitated?

154
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:38,166
Is there something
I should know?

155
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,125
It's the way the
townspeople are acting.

156
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42,666
I've seen that look before.

157
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,041
It's an Akuma.

158
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:46,208
The scent that was
unleashed when the Innocence

159
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,958
was discovered has attracted
the Akuma to this town.

160
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,125
You sure?

161
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:00,500
Persistent!
Persistent! Persistent!

162
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,541
You really are tenacious...

163
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,791
You know that?!

164
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:23,958
There's nowhere to escape...

165
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:26,583
Return the Innocence
you murdered for at once,

166
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,750
before I make the end
of your existence hell.

167
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:32,458
You sure you want
to be making threats...

168
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:34,541
To my friends?!

169
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:40,208
Go ahead and take it
from me if you can.

170
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:43,208
I guess you're not smart
enough to listen to reason.

171
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You've left me with no choice!

172
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:49,625
Oh wow, what a
tough-talking grandpa you are!

173
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,458
I hope you don't
break your hip...

174
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:52,916
Get him!

175
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,416
There he is!

176
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,000
Amazing.

177
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,208
You don't know when to quit!

178
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:15,791
I'm through showing
you mercy, old man!

179
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,541
Wait! What the... NO!

180
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:48,208
Bastards...! No no no no no!!!

181
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,625
Any last words?

182
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:58,458
I should ask the same for you...

183
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,375
DIE!!!

184
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,625
General Yeegar, just
stay where you are!

185
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,000
I'll handle him from here!

186
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,083
I take it you're Allen Walker...

187
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:18,833
I'd like to thank
you for... saving me...

188
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:19,708
You are brave.

189
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,291
Ohh, it was nothing.

190
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,791
I was amazed
at your abilities...

191
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,250
I'm glad you're safe...

192
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:28,041
and that you were able to
re-capture the Innocence.

193
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:30,458
At a price... yes...

194
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,791
But, many innocent people
have lost their lives here.

195
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:43,000
Had we acted sooner,

196
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,416
then the loss of
life in your town

197
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,375
would have been avoided
and for that I apologize...

198
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,000
Please forgive me.

199
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,791
An apology isn't
necessary sir...

200
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,416
Because you reacted
at all, many more lives

201
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,666
have been saved that would
have otherwise been lost.

202
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,291
We appreciate what
you've done for us

203
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:59,083
from the bottom of our hearts...

204
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:01,250
We will forever be in your debt.

205
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:12,125
So you're General Cross'
apprentice, isn't that right?

206
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,333
Uhh... yes.

207
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:17,041
I've heard training under
him can be hellacious.

208
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,833
Yeah, that's about right...

209
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:19,958
But don't take
that the wrong way!

210
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,208
It was worth it...

211
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,916
I appreciate everything
Master Cross did for me.

212
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,708
Cross is an interesting fellow.

213
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:27,291
As a human being
he needs some work

214
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:29,208
and lacks a variety
of social graces,

215
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:32,583
but, no one is more attuned
to the extermination of Akuma.

216
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:33,833
Huh?

217
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:36,833
I believe that is why he
made you his apprentice.

218
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:40,500
Because you've housed Innocence
within your body since birth.

219
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:41,750
As you already know,

220
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:44,666
each of us five Generals
carry several pieces

221
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,333
of Innocence with us in the
field at all times in order

222
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:49,666
to seek out worthy
Accommodators.

223
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,583
Including the Innocence
I collected today,

224
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:54,125
I have eight pieces
in my possession.

225
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,416
I don't know how many
more pieces I can collect

226
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,791
before putting myself in danger,

227
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:01,000
nor do I know the amount
of Accommodators I can find

228
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,291
in the little time
I have left in this world,

229
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:04,500
but to end this war,

230
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:07,958
I must continue the
quest for Innocence.

231
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,625
Now please, eat...

232
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:12,708
This is how I choose
to show my appreciation.

233
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,041
General...

234
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:16,708
I didn't do anything to
deserve this... kindness.

235
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:19,083
This meal is not a
thanks for saving me...

236
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,916
But in honor of
becoming an Exorcist

237
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,875
and enduring its hardships.

238
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,500
Though you're a full-fledged
member of The Order,

239
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:29,250
it is often difficult to
deal with the horrors of war

240
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,541
especially as young as you are.

241
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:32,625
The least you deserve for making

242
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,833
such a profound
sacrifice to the Order

243
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:37,250
is a good meal
every now and then.

244
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:40,208
Thank you General Yeegar.

245
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:50,250
This is delicious...!
Best meal I've ever had

246
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:51,500
and this bread! Oh the bread!

247
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:52,791
Oh... that's great...

248
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm glad you like it.

249
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,583
I do... I do!

250
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:58,750
Unbelievable.

251
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,333
It's quite common actually,

252
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,416
the hosts of Parasite Type
Accommodator's tend

253
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,333
to have abnormally large
appetites, as you can see...

254
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:06,708
Very impressive...

255
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:13,083
I'm sorry...
I cleared the table.

256
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:13,875
Oh, no!

257
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,333
Don't worry about it son.

258
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,500
Eat as much as you
like. I don't mind.

259
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,166
Eating an abundant
amount of food

260
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:26,750
is a wonderful complement to
a cook so please, eat your fill.

261
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,666
He is just like you had
described him Thierry.

262
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,875
General Yeegar,
he's a really nice guy,

263
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,291
just like you were telling me...

264
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:34,375
Sir you must have

265
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:35,750
been a fantastic
teacher back in the day.

266
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,208
I'm sure all of your
students couldn't wait to get

267
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:39,708
to school every morning
to learn from the best.

268
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,208
Actually...

269
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,708
I wasn't a good teacher by
any stretch of the imagination.

270
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:45,208
Huh?

271
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,000
Because...

272
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,041
I was unable to protect them...

273
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:51,500
at a time when my
students needed me the most.

274
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:54,791
So what happened...?
Don't tell me...

275
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:55,750
Did you...?

276
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,291
Yes...

277
00:14:57,375 --> 00:15:01,041
It happened forty years ago
though it seems like yesterday.

278
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:04,416
I was in a small village
in the country working

279
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,500
as a school teacher...

280
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,250
I had just under
twenty students,

281
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:11,500
allowing me to give each
of them my full attention.

282
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:13,166
They responded
quite well to this

283
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,166
and we formed a strong bond.

284
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:19,875
However, it wasn't long before
tragedy struck our class.

285
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:23,041
It changed us all forever.

286
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:26,958
One day, a female student
passed away suddenly

287
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:29,083
from a serious illness...

288
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:31,541
Everyone in our class
mourned her death,

289
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:32,958
but no one suffered more

290
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:35,583
from her passing
than her best friend...

291
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,416
Joanne.

292
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,375
The day after he took
advantage of her grief.

293
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:46,166
Why good evening there... child.

294
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,708
The Millennium Earl.

295
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:53,083
He manipulated Joanne
in her moment of weakness

296
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:56,875
and brought her friends soul
back turning her into an Akuma.

297
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:59,166
Her classmates were
unaware of what had happened

298
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,208
and were happy for
Joanne when she returned

299
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:04,291
after her long absence of
grieving for her friend.

300
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:05,958
Feeling better now Joanne?

301
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,208
Hey Joanne, you
look a little pale.

302
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:08,916
That's okay.

303
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,166
We'll help cheer you up!

304
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,083
What I saw that day was
the most horrific scene

305
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,916
I'd ever laid eyes on...

306
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,666
Most of the students were dead,

307
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,750
but those that were
still clinging to life,

308
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:28,125
suffered greatly
before expiring.

309
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:33,083
I panicked, just like anyone
in that situation would,

310
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,416
and ran out to the
schoolyard to call for help.

311
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,666
And then...

312
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,666
I saw Joanne
standing in the yard,

313
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:43,125
facing a man who was aiming
an arrow straight at her head.

314
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:45,416
What are you doing?!

315
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:57,875
Stop it!

316
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:02,125
That man turned out to be an
Exorcist with the Black Order.

317
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:04,541
I suppose he saw
something in me,

318
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,916
because after explaining
what an Akuma was,

319
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,333
he suggested I go to the
Order where it was revealed

320
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:12,333
that I was an
Accommodator of Innocence,

321
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:15,041
and could become an Exorcist.

322
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:16,833
The last forty years of my life

323
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:19,375
have been dedicated
to fighting evil

324
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:22,916
and preventing tragedies like
this from ever happening again.

325
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,166
However...

326
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,666
the fight of one old man
is not nearly enough.

327
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,208
It seems as though
you have been through

328
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:31,625
many hardships as
well... Allen Walker.

329
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:34,208
Yes, sir, I have...

330
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,208
I turned Mana into an Akuma...

331
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:38,708
He was someone who
was very special to me.

332
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,625
Then I destroyed
what he became...

333
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:44,666
That's when my left eye received
the curse it bears now...

334
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,416
Allowing me to see
the souls of Akuma.

335
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,041
I heard...

336
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,916
I also heard that soon after
you became Cross' apprentice

337
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,291
and began your
Exorcist training.

338
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,291
At first I wanted to
become an Exorcist

339
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:59,041
to atone for Mana's death.

340
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:00,750
But now I know
better than that...

341
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,958
Because I fight in
order to survive,

342
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:06,125
to ensure that the people
who have died can rest easy,

343
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,875
to make every day worth living.

344
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,375
Some people would see being born

345
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:12,250
with Innocence in
their body a curse...

346
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:14,791
Whereas I see it as my fate.

347
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,083
The fact is...

348
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:18,333
I turned the most
important person in my life

349
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:21,500
into an Akuma so the
only thing I can do is...

350
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:24,583
There's no need
to explain yourself...

351
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:25,625
I believe you handled

352
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:27,833
your situation bravely,
young man...

353
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:30,541
I am proud to know you
for that reason alone.

354
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,541
Thank you, General.

355
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,250
Trust me, I understand how you

356
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,208
and Joanne felt
compelled to bring back

357
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:38,458
the soul of someone you loved.

358
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:39,916
No one can blame you

359
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,041
for reacting the
way that you did...

360
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:46,583
Even the most righteous
exorcist would understand.

361
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,625
Remember, that
knowing firsthand the pain

362
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:50,458
and suffering one goes
through when confronted

363
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:52,625
with the Earl and his
deception can only aid

364
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:55,333
in your journey as an Exorcist.

365
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:58,000
That knowledge will enable
you to save more lives

366
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:01,166
than you could
ever have imagined.

367
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:05,208
Allen, are you all right?

368
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:10,791
It's nothing really.
I'm okay... I'm sorry.

369
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:13,208
It wasn't a mistake...
It wasn't...

370
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:16,125
I became an Exorcist
for a reason, right Mana?

371
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:28,541
Take care you guys!

372
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,166
You humans continue to fight

373
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,583
even though you have
no future in this world...

374
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,208
It's pathetic.

375
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:07,708
What are you talking about?

376
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:11,208
I have a message for you
from Lord Millennium.

377
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:12,750
Your time has come...

378
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:16,083
The seven thousand year
prologue has finally ended,

379
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:19,166
and the play is about to begin.

380
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,250
Don't miss the rising
of the curtain...!

381
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:26,208
For you are the
actors... the Exorcists!

382
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:34,791
If that's true then
everything up to this point

383
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:37,416
was just a ruse.

384
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:50,791
♪ The Lord Millennium
is in search of you. ♪

385
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:57,125
♪ Looking for the heart now,
have you heard the news? ♪

386
00:20:57,208 --> 00:21:00,416
♪ Maybe you stole
it from him. ♪

387
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,500
♪ I'll see if it's true. ♪

388
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:39,791
The Millennium Earl
has announced

389
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:43,500
his intentions to bring
about the end of mankind.

390
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:45,291
As the starting bell rings,

391
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:48,666
a beginning too cruel
to describe unfolds.

392
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:52,458
On the next D. Gray-man:
"The Beginning of the End"!

393
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:55,833
Bring forth salvation to
this tormented Akuma's soul.
