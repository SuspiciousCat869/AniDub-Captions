1
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:47,083
Romania?

2
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:48,375
Here...! This should help.

3
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:50,166
Well, what sort of
assignment is it?

4
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,250
We're trying to find someone...

5
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:53,416
And we have good
reason to believe

6
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,500
that he spent some
time in this village...

7
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:56,750
You are to
investigate the reports

8
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:58,541
and help us locate
his whereabouts.

9
00:01:58,625 --> 00:01:59,958
But sir, this sort of thing

10
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:03,541
isn't normally an
Exorcist's job, right Chief?

11
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,708
You are correct, missing persons

12
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:09,041
are not usually
duties of Exorcists,

13
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:10,458
however, in this case,

14
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:12,958
I must say that this is
a job only for you, Allen.

15
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:14,000
Really...?

16
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:15,750
But why me...

17
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:24,333
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, noooo!

18
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:26,166
Come now, you're the
only one who can do it...!

19
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,458
It makes perfect
sense, don't you see?

20
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:29,416
Good Luck...

21
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,583
Have fun!

22
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:34,083
No...! Absolutely not...!

23
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:38,625
I won't do it, I woooooon't!

24
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:43,500
I don't want to see Master!

25
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:51,416
It's getting close.

26
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:56,083
Was that...?

27
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:57,791
It's fast!

28
00:02:58,666 --> 00:02:59,416
Smell that?

29
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,500
Yes, I can...

30
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:03,000
It's like a kind of sweetness.

31
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:06,916
He... He got Franz!

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,250
What happened?

33
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:11,250
He took Franz over there...

34
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:11,916
Look!

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,625
What?

36
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:25,333
It... It's him!

37
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:25,958
No way!

38
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:27,375
That's him?!

39
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,041
It's Count Arystar Krory!

40
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,166
So he's... not an Akuma.

41
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:33,958
Oh yeah...

42
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,416
That'd be a vampire...

43
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,291
Agreed...

44
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:37,833
He's a vampire!

45
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:42,750
You see, this is why I didn't
wanna look for Master!

46
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,666
This can't be real.

47
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:07,666
I don't want to die!!

48
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,125
What are we gonna do?

49
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,375
I don't know but if possible
I'd rather not fight him.

50
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,958
Well, we can't let him
continue to kill the villagers,

51
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:17,625
so I'm afraid we don't have
much of a choice here, Lavi.

52
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:20,000
Okay...

53
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:22,500
Then let's do it...
Innocence Activate!

54
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:41,416
Am I to understand that you're
actually going to fight me...?

55
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,208
How very brave of you.

56
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,291
Hey, remember if you
get bitten or something...

57
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:46,458
You and I are through...

58
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,208
That goes both ways.

59
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,833
He's fast!

60
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,416
No, you don't!

61
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:02,000
Come on, what's
the matter with you?!

62
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,833
He wasn't moving
that fast before!

63
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:12,541
Big Hammer, Little Hammer!

64
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,291
Grow... Grow... Grow...

65
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,833
GROW!!!

66
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,500
Take that!

67
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,458
Holy crap, this guy has
some crazy teeth, doesn't he!

68
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,375
I've got you.

69
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:02,166
Stop fighting now and
you won't be harmed.

70
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,708
What strange little brats...

71
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,500
To think that you've
faced me head on

72
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,666
and are still able
to draw breath.

73
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,625
You must be monsters as well...

74
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:20,833
Aren't you?

75
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:23,291
Not exactly... you're
fighting Exorcists.

76
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:24,125
Really...?

77
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:25,791
Exorcists... Fascinating...

78
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:28,375
What do you taste like...?
Let's find out!

79
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:31,375
No way...!

80
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,166
He's biting my
Anti-Akuma Weapon!

81
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,708
Oh dammit Allen, he's...

82
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,833
...he's... got your blood!

83
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:43,041
Why does this blood
burn so badly?!?!!

84
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:55,958
Hey, don't go!

85
00:06:57,416 --> 00:07:00,583
I warned ya...

86
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,666
But...

87
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:31,291
Ah... Welcome home... Arystar.

88
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:36,166
Is something the matter, dear?

89
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,708
Eliade, I...

90
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:42,208
I don't want you...
to ever hate me.

91
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:44,291
Hate you?

92
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:47,166
Because of, what, I've done,

93
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,916
I've became a vampire again.

94
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:53,875
Hello...?

95
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:57,208
Hello?!

96
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:58,458
Oh... God...

97
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,958
Oh, please tell me
that you're still alive...

98
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:02,291
Please...

99
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:03,333
Hello...?

100
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,083
Oh, please...

101
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,875
I'm afraid it's
too late, Arystar.

102
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:09,916
This man has
already passed away.

103
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,250
Don't worry--I'll bury the
body in the usual place.

104
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,708
How did I turn
into this monster...?!

105
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,666
How?!

106
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,875
A mob of men from the village

107
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,375
were just here to fight
me in the garden...

108
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,375
I've now become
an enemy to them,

109
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:30,583
something to be
hated, and despised.

110
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,125
Oh, Eliade!

111
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:35,916
How they feel can't be helped...

112
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,083
Don't you see, Arystar...?

113
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:41,750
They are human,
and you are a vampire.

114
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:00,666
Stay back...

115
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,208
Don't come any
closer to me, please!

116
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,458
What's the matter, Arystar?

117
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:06,750
Eliade, I...

118
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:09,000
Please don't. I will...

119
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:11,833
I will kill... you...
I know it...

120
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:14,541
Oh, God help me...

121
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,291
 I... will...

122
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,416
...even though, I love you.

123
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,458
Don't you know
I love you, too...?

124
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:22,958
Arystar, my darling...

125
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:30,666
Don't worry yourself

126
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,416
with what those
people think of you...

127
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,541
You're above them...

128
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,291
My dearest Eliade...

129
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:40,625
I will love you...
with all that I have...

130
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:44,958
Let's live here in this castle
forever, you and I alone.

131
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,250
Yes...

132
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:49,458
Forever... and ever...

133
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,458
The brave Black Clergymen

134
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:55,958
have driven back the
vampire, Arystar Krory!

135
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:59,125
May God bless these brave
fighters...! Come, men...!

136
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:02,916
Hip Hip Hurray!
Hip Hip Hurray!

137
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,208
It would seem that
victory is upon us tonight!

138
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:07,791
But then, excuse me...

139
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:11,375
Um, why do you all seem to be
standing so far away from me?

140
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,541
Just giving you
space, black monk!

141
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:16,041
It's because they know
you were bitten by Krory,

142
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,833
and they're afraid you're going
to turn into a blood-sucker...

143
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:21,083
What?

144
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:24,666
Ah, it's crazy, isn't it?!

145
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,166
You see, I'm not
worried at all!

146
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,041
He's worried...

147
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,708
Oh, he's totally worried!

148
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,958
Come on, we should hurry
and get back to the castle,

149
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:32,666
that is, if you aren't
too afraid of me...

150
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,791
Why the rush?

151
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,750
Because the Count
abducted a villager,

152
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,375
that's why, remember...?

153
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,583
He could still be
alive in there...

154
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:43,833
Krory always takes his
victims inside the castle...!

155
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,541
And they never come out...!

156
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,541
It's happened every time!

157
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,083
I get it...

158
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:51,416
But, you're right, if there's
even the smallest chance...

159
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,541
Mayor, we want to ask you

160
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:54,041
and all of your
men to wait here...

161
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,375
We're going in to
investigate the castle!

162
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:57,666
Oh, don't worry...!

163
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,791
We now know that when
humans fight monsters,

164
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:02,541
it's far too easy for
us to lose our lives!

165
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,208
We shall leave it to the monks!!

166
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:08,416
So then, does he mean,
we're monsters, too?

167
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,041
Ahhh... I don't feel good.

168
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:21,041
Hmmm...

169
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,875
I see, yes, that would
explain quite a bit...

170
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:26,458
You're nothing if not
prepared, Chief Komui.

171
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,666
I'm impressed that you
guessed our involvement...

172
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,166
Remind me never to
underestimate you, Bookman.

173
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,333
Well, sir, we tend to
take a special interest

174
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:37,208
in our young friend
with the white hair.

175
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,375
You mean Hevlaska's prophecy...?

176
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:43,833
Hmm, well again, it's a
comfort that you're there.

177
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:47,333
I'm glad you're comforted
while I'm babysitting.

178
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,916
Yes, I see...!

179
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,958
I did not know that...!

180
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,083
Yes, yes...

181
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,333
Give it up, Chief...

182
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:01,916
We all know that whoever
you were just talking to

183
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,333
has hung up, you're
obviously faking it.

184
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:06,333
Section Leader
Reever, coffee now!

185
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:08,458
But first we need you
to approve this work!

186
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,625
Come now, you know
I can't concentrate

187
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,458
without my coffee!

188
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:13,250
That's it!

189
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,583
You are completely insane!

190
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:15,833
Leave me alone...!

191
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:16,833
Wow...

192
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:18,750
My brother's a mess.

193
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:25,583
"Botanical of the
Ancient," what is this?

194
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:29,166
Lavi and Allen should have
no problem taking care of it.

195
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,000
Seriously, we're
Exorcists--what business

196
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:48,625
do we have dealing
with a vampire?

197
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:49,833
I don't know...

198
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:52,666
What do you suppose
brought my Master here?

199
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,041
And don't you think it's strange

200
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,833
that he'd leave a
message like that...

201
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:59,750
like he knew we'd come
to help these people?

202
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:20,916
I have to wonder
if this vampire case

203
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,583
and my master are connected.

204
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,000
Of course they are...

205
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,125
If not, then why
are we even here?

206
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:28,583
Hey, do you smell something...?

207
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:29,416
Lavi...?

208
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,750
Oh!

209
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:34,125
I've smelled this before...

210
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:48,000
Lavi, wake up!

211
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,916
We're in trouble!

212
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,750
Activate!

213
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,250
Those flowers are
carnivorous...!

214
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,500
That explains all of the gas--

215
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:20,791
Lavi!

216
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,375
Are you alright, Lavi? Wake up!

217
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:35,333
There are too many of
them, come on, Lavi...!

218
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,291
Listen... You have to wake up
and help me with this!

219
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:45,083
What are you doing...?!
Stop this at once!

220
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,458
You wouldn't be trying

221
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:48,916
to destroy Arystar's
precious flowers, would you?!

222
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,041
Hmm...

223
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:01,583
Suddenly, I feel the
lusty eyes of a stranger...

224
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,083
Hi.

225
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:09,416
Oh my God, she's gorgeous!

226
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,083
Oh my.

227
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,125
Wow!

228
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,125
Lavi?!

229
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,083
She's totally my type and
she's looking right at me...!

230
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,291
Hey, Lavi, look out!

231
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,958
Such a handsome boy...

232
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:29,166
So, would you
like to be my lover?

233
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,125
Would I...?!

234
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:32,875
Yes... please...
Yes, yes, yes--

235
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,541
What are you
trying to do to me?!

236
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:38,166
How can you be such an idiot
over a girl like that...?

237
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:41,625
Did you happen to notice that
we're about to be eaten here?!

238
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,666
Allen, you are such a child.

239
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,708
What do you mean
"a girl like that," huh?!

240
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:52,291
That crest...

241
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:54,958
Are they really Exorcists?

242
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,875
My name is Eliade...

243
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:59,583
and I'm Arystar's assistant.

244
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,083
Now I'd appreciate
you telling me

245
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:03,708
what sort of business has
brought you here to our castle.

246
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,958
Sure, it's about the vampire!

247
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:07,833
We've come to
search these premises

248
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:09,666
for the villager
taken by the Count.

249
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,208
Oh, a villager's here...?

250
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:16,166
Hmm... Really.

251
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,375
I wonder if you two
can guess what this is...

252
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:19,541
Uh...

253
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:20,625
It's a coffin.

254
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:21,708
Silly boy...

255
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:24,166
I meant what do
you think is in it...

256
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:27,333
Why don't you... have a look!

257
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:30,958
Franz!

258
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:08,458
This is really bad!

259
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:09,958
Let's go... C'mon!

260
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,875
What... What is happening?!

261
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,333
Oh... Look...!

262
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:32,708
The black clergymen are
destroying Krory's castle!

263
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,083
Fight, Clergymen, fight...!

264
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:38,583
Fight, Clergymen, fight...!
Fight, Clergymen, fight...!

265
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:41,166
Yeah!

266
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:43,208
It may be...

267
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:45,666
That sending them off alone...

268
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,208
...wasn't the best idea.

269
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,375
We are so amazing...

270
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:05,125
Oh man, I thought
we were dead for sure.

271
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,083
What's really
amazing is this coat.

272
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:11,041
I... I don't feel so good...

273
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:15,041
Hey... what's that?!

274
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,583
A graveyard!

275
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,958
Well, these graves don't
look very nice, do they...?

276
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:38,000
You think they were pets?

277
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,541
I think...

278
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:42,125
it's possible we may have found
the missing villagers, Lavi.

279
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:43,416
Huh?

280
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,000
Think about it...

281
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:48,458
...that Eliade woman had Franz's
body in a coffin, didn't she...?

282
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:49,541
That could mean

283
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:52,166
that she was bringing
it here to bury.

284
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,541
Let's see, there are,
eight graves...

285
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,208
Yes, that would match
the number of victims

286
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:59,041
the mayor told us about.

287
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,125
Hmm...

288
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,666
but Krory killed
nine people, didn't he?

289
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,708
That's right, but remember,
didn't they say something about

290
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:09,375
the first woman evaporating
after he sucked her blood?

291
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:16,958
So these... are probably...

292
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,500
Aaaahh! You broke it!

293
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:25,958
No-No! I barely touched
it, I promise, see?!

294
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:29,916
What is that!

295
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,416
Hey, come here and
take a look at this!

296
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,916
There!

297
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:39,291
Pentacles... on the
surface of the ground.

298
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:42,625
No mistake...
Traces of Akuma blood.

299
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:43,833
Agreed...

300
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:47,791
Could this be a
graveyard for... for Akuma?

301
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,916
Allen, the pentacles are
showing on this one, too!

302
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,666
I'm afraid we're going
to find the pentacles

303
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,416
on every one of these graves.

304
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,791
Hey...

305
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:04,916
Remember when those
flowers ate Franz earlier...?

306
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,125
Did you see the...?

307
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:07,791
Yeah.

308
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:20,416
I saw them, the pentacles.

309
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,791
So then... do you think...?

310
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:27,916
The flowers... ate an Akuma?

311
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:39,625
I don't know... but I do think

312
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:43,708
there's a lot more going
on here than vampires.

313
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:41,708
The truth is beginning
to show itself,

314
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:44,500
the story of Krory, the vampire

315
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:47,958
and Eliade, the
mysterious woman by his side.

316
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:52,375
On the next episode of
D. Gray-man: "Krory Attacks."

317
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:56,166
Bring forth salvation to
this tormented Akuma's soul!
