1
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:42,666
There sure are a lot of
olive groves around here...

2
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,500
It'll probably be like this

3
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:46,458
until we get to
the next station.

4
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:48,416
I wish we were there now.

5
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,958
We rode past some really
unbelievable scenery

6
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:52,208
while you were sleeping.

7
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:54,291
Some of the best
I've seen this whole trip...

8
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm sorry you had to miss it.

9
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:58,375
You're saying it
wasn't just olive trees?

10
00:01:58,458 --> 00:01:59,541
Why didn't you wake me up?

11
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:00,916
I would have if I could...

12
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,041
But the way you were snoring

13
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:04,166
I figured you needed
the sleep anyway.

14
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:10,333
Maybe you've got a point there.

15
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:21,666
Wow... I'm sorry...

16
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,791
You're okay, right?

17
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,000
Sure. How are you?

18
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:28,208
Oh... I'll live.

19
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,208
What's going on?

20
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,125
I hope this doesn't
make us late.

21
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:42,958
It looks like a wagon is
stuck on the tracks up ahead.

22
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:45,625
So sorry for the trouble!

23
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:49,375
Don't apologize, hurry up
and clear off the tracks!

24
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:50,375
Oh, we'll move...

25
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,250
Just as soon as we...

26
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:53,875
...kill everyone...

27
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:01,958
Destroy them!

28
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:04,125
No human is to be left alive!

29
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:11,916
Get everybody off the train!

30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,750
O-Okay!

31
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:16,541
What? They had an
Exorcist on board?!

32
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:34,750
One more to go.

33
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:35,958
That was close! Ooh...

34
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,000
But you'll have to
do better than that!

35
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,583
Look...! It's another group...!

36
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:42,875
Where are they all coming from?

37
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,916
And why are there so many...?

38
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,333
This doesn't make any sense.

39
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:53,041
Misty Wind!

40
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:05,958
Now hold still...

41
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,666
Die, Exorcist!

42
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:24,708
Lenalee!

43
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:27,000
Thank me later.
Just be careful.

44
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,333
Get in my way, will you...?

45
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,375
Then take this!

46
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:51,083
It's over.

47
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,375
More?

48
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,000
Why are there so many?

49
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:56,416
I don't know, but after
this we're gonna find out.

50
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,916
Right!

51
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,416
I'm starving.

52
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,416
If I don't eat soon,
I'm a goner.

53
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,666
Stop saying that...

54
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,041
Why do you think
such huge numbers

55
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,791
of Akuma would suddenly
appear in a place like this?

56
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:15,791
Do you think olive leaves

57
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,833
taste more like
olives or leaves?

58
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,250
What?

59
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,375
Ya know you could at least
pretend to pay attention.

60
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:24,000
Hungry...

61
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,666
Hey, there little buddy...!

62
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,208
Today must be your lucky day, 

63
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:29,625
because I made every one
of your favorite fiddles!

64
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:31,083
Voila...

65
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:33,625
Well don't just sit there
looking at it, dig right in!

66
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,500
Don't mind if I do!

67
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,916
Allen... Allen!

68
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:49,333
Somebody's coming.

69
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,583
They're Finders!

70
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,791
We're saved...!
They'll have food!

71
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,875
I certainly hope they do.

72
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,625
Here... Please enjoy...

73
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,041
Oh, thank you!

74
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:04,750
Where are my manners?

75
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:07,625
I'm Devon, the
leader of this group.

76
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,583
Jerry mentioned an
Exorcist whose appetite

77
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,500
was "fascinating,"
I believe he said.

78
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,583
I'm guessing he
meant you, right?

79
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:18,666
It's impressive...

80
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,083
I could put away
food like that myself

81
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:22,208
when I was a young man...

82
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:24,750
Here, have some more...

83
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:28,083
I don't know how
to thank you enough.

84
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:29,333
As we were traveling here,

85
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:31,291
we were amazed at
the number of villages

86
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,666
that had been
attacked by Akuma.

87
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,333
It seems they're
assembling in large groups

88
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,250
to make traveling safer.

89
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,875
But where would so
many Akuma be going?

90
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:41,416
I know they're heading westward,

91
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,375
but it's difficult for me to
pin down a specific location...

92
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:46,041
Heading west...?

93
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:48,416
I wonder what
they're looking for.

94
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,625
You've been awfully quiet.

95
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:51,375
What do you think, Allen?

96
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:52,750
Where they're going
doesn't concern me

97
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:55,458
as much as why there are
so many traveling together.

98
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:56,750
I agree.

99
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,291
That's exactly what
we've been looking into...

100
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:00,500
Of course...

101
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,500
I remember how Jerry
described your appetite!

102
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:04,666
He said it was "captivating."

103
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,208
He told me that he fell in love

104
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,000
with Allen when he
saw the way he ate.

105
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:10,708
He did not! Did he?

106
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,458
It's so quiet...

107
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:26,458
Why can't I hear anything?

108
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:35,375
Where is this place?

109
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,875
A black moon...!
Brother...? Anyone?

110
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:44,666
I've seen this place before!

111
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:46,916
Where am I?

112
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,583
It was only a dream.

113
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:13,041
What's the matter?
Having trouble getting to sleep?

114
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,708
I... I'm so sorry... I'm fine.

115
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:17,541
I didn't mean to wake you up...

116
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,583
Good night, Allen.

117
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:24,666
It was just a bad dream.

118
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,750
For coffee made from
three-day-old grounds,

119
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:45,208
this is pretty good...

120
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:48,833
My compliments to Chef Eeze
for another fine meal.

121
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:52,666
All right, then.

122
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,833
Let's get back to work.

123
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:58,500
Man, my head feels like
it was hit with a brick...

124
00:08:58,583 --> 00:08:59,666
Ya me too...

125
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,166
That's because you
drank too much, dummy.

126
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,291
Hey, Tyki.

127
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,500
Huh...

128
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:06,708
Phone's for you.
It's the same guy as usual.

129
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,333
This is Tyki...

130
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,166
Yeah...

131
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,875
Yeah, I got it.

132
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:16,916
Klack!

133
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,666
Momo!

134
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,750
Sorry, you guys.

135
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:22,083
I just got called
in to another job.

136
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:23,125
Running off to do that

137
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,166
top-secret side
work of yours again?

138
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,916
That's the one.

139
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,166
If that job pays so well,

140
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,708
why don't you put in a
good word with your boss

141
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:31,375
and let him know
we're interested...?

142
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,916
Whatever it is, if you can
do it, it can't be that hard.

143
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,750
Sure thing...

144
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,000
No problem.

145
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,958
Try not to miss me too much...

146
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,416
So long!

147
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,416
Whoa, I almost forgot...!
Hey, Eeze!

148
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,916
I got a little something for
you when I was on my last trip.

149
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,125
It's not much,
but I want you to have it.

150
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,250
Here.

151
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,750
Oh, wow...! Look, cool...!

152
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,125
Are you sure I can have it?

153
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:58,958
Sure.

154
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:00,666
You mean it's really mine?

155
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,166
Why not...?

156
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,916
The way you kinda run this
place, I figured you deserve it.

157
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:06,958
Just don't tell Momo or Klack.

158
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,458
Oh, I won't!

159
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,416
So... I'll see you soon, buddy!

160
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,125
Thanks, Tyki!

161
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:15,250
I'll see you whenever you
get back from your secret job!

162
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,583
You made it.

163
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:27,375
Well then...

164
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:28,625
If you don't mind,

165
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:31,208
we'll join the rest of
the family at lunch...

166
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:34,166
What do you say?

167
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,416
Very well.

168
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:40,291
I'd do absolutely anything
for the Millennium Earl.

169
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,291
It's bitter.

170
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,583
This egg is bitter! You idiot!

171
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:53,958
How many times
do I have to tell you

172
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:55,916
to make it sweet before
you'll get it right?

173
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,916
Is it really that painful to try
something that isn't sweet?

174
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,375
What did you just say?

175
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:01,625
If you really
like sweets so much,

176
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,791
then why don't
you give this a try?

177
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:07,500
That's not sweet, either!

178
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:11,750
You think that's funny, huh?

179
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,500
Maybe you'll like this instead!

180
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:21,083
Stop that...!

181
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,625
The Millennium Earl
will be here any minute,

182
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,750
and when he sees what
you've done to the place--

183
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,625
I don't remember
asking your opinion!

184
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:30,208
Lero!

185
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,416
You dress like a
clown at a funeral!

186
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,458
Shut up!

187
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,541
It's called fashion,
you big jerk!

188
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:36,416
Oh yeah...

189
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,708
That's what I'm talking about...

190
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:38,875
Don't just sit there lero,

191
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:41,750
get this melon
off my head, lero!

192
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,958
Lero, lero, lero, lero... Lero?!

193
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,000
Thank you so much
for your patience...

194
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,708
Look who's here!

195
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:53,166
What's with all the mess?

196
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,666
Uh... Nothing!

197
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,583
Yeah! Nothing!

198
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,458
Hey... Tyki.

199
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:01,250
Road... Hello.

200
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:04,166
Skin, you haven't
changed a bit...

201
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,541
Devit, Jasdero...

202
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:08,208
You're both looking splendid...

203
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:09,458
Well, then...

204
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:12,583
I believe everyone
is accounted for.

205
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:19,500
Now you can all do my homework!

206
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:21,791
You're kidding...

207
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,166
You mean I traveled all this
way to do your long division.

208
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,791
So... that a problem?

209
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,500
What if it is, uh?

210
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:31,500
You need to learn that
life is not ever that sweet.

211
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,041
That's sweet!

212
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:37,208
You'll be done faster if you...
ya know... start right now!

213
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,750
What's this...?

214
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,500
What are you supposed to do
with all these number thingys?

215
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:41,333
It's math homework...

216
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:42,708
You work out the problems...

217
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,125
Sounds fun...

218
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:46,125
And it's too hard for you
to do yourself, huh...?

219
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:47,375
It's a good thing
you know someone

220
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:50,291
of my superior
intelligence to help out.

221
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:52,500
There. All finished.

222
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:53,791
Wait a second...

223
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,416
Why are they all the same?

224
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,166
It's such a pretty number I just
couldn't resist the urge...

225
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,083
But it isn't the
right answer, is it?

226
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:01,708
Look! I can do math, too!

227
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,291
Lero?

228
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:07,208
Five, five, five, five, five,
five, five, five, five, five!

229
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:08,458
Pretty, huh?

230
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:09,958
They're all so stupid!

231
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:12,458
Come on...! You didn't
solve one problem!

232
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,625
Maybe you ought to try
doing your own homework...!

233
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:19,125
See? I'm solving
problems already!

234
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,041
If you didn't want to
help you should've said so.

235
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:22,583
It was stupid of me to ask.

236
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,125
Who are you calling stupid?!

237
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:28,166
At least it's something to
pass the time before dinner.

238
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,666
Thanks, Tyki!

239
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:33,083
You're the only one in this
family I can really rely on.

240
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:35,958
That so...? Here.

241
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:37,375
Thank you!

242
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,125
Lero?

243
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:40,375
Hey!

244
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:42,250
All you did was write
a different number!

245
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,916
And besides, this is my
geography homework!

246
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,708
Those answers are even
more wrong than Jasdero's!

247
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,500
No, I'm pretty sure it's twelve.

248
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,333
Useless!

249
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,666
No one to help you with
your homework, huh...?

250
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,916
You're in luck.

251
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,750
Best of luck on your assignment
to locate General Cross...

252
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,125
We'll say goodbye to you here,

253
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:14,500
then we'll travel
along the coastline

254
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,916
and try to find General Tiedoll.

255
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,250
If anyone can find him,
I'm sure you can.

256
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,666
Be careful on your journey.

257
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,916
We'll do our best...

258
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,333
You two do the same...

259
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:26,291
General Cross can
certainly be elusive,

260
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:28,416
but I'm sure you
can track him down.

261
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,458
Thanks...

262
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:31,583
We both got our
work cut out for us.

263
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:41,083
You don't run across someone
like Devon every day, huh?

264
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:42,666
Seeing you shovel food away like

265
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:46,041
that reminds me of
me as a young boy.

266
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:57,208
I guess you two
are a lot a like.

267
00:14:57,291 --> 00:15:08,875
I guess you two
are a lot a like.

268
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:10,875
Everyone clear the road.

269
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:14,541
Just let us pass through
and we'll be on our way.

270
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,125
They're all--

271
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,625
Circle around the wagon...

272
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,708
Get out the barrier equipment
and create a perimeter...

273
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:25,583
Right sir!

274
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,541
Hope they can see this.

275
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,250
Is that...?

276
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,458
...a signal!

277
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:37,250
It's Devon and the Finders!

278
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,375
As long as these are
all level one Akuma,

279
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,208
this should be enough
to hold them back.

280
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:56,916
We've got to hang on and hope

281
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,333
that Lenalee and
Allen saw that flare.

282
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,291
Right... Yes, Sir!

283
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,958
Oh god!

284
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:07,750
Sir, we can't hold 'em...

285
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,416
Don't get weak on me now!

286
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:21,708
You came back!

287
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,666
Of course!

288
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,375
Not bad...! Listen up...!

289
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:39,708
Do whatever those
two tell you, okay...?

290
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,916
Set your barrier
device to capture!

291
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,916
Yes, sir!

292
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,416
Everyone attack!

293
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:52,875
Thanks for the help, guys!

294
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,333
Yeah!

295
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:01,458
Sorry I'm late...

296
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:03,375
I'm the level two.

297
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:12,000
It isn't completely
finished yet...

298
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:14,250
but I took care of the
harder ones for ya...

299
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,916
You're the greatest,
Lord Millennium...!

300
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,291
And you even showed your work!

301
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:21,333
I didn't call
everybody here today

302
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,500
to help Road with
her math homework...

303
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,625
We need to discuss
what battle strategy

304
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:28,083
to use against the Exorcists.

305
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,750
That's more like it!

306
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:34,291
Does this mean that Jasdero's
gonna get to kill somebody soon?

307
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,333
Who would have thought that
junior high math problems

308
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:38,791
would have been the highlight
of this evening, hmm?

309
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:43,291
I've organized some
of the largest numbers

310
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:47,000
of Akuma ever assembled,
and the stage is finally set.

311
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,458
I hope you're all ready
to see some action.

312
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,708
Yeah...! So, so, so...

313
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:52,416
What do you think?

314
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,750
Who should I kill first?

315
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:57,375
How about you let Jasdero
take care of the Exorcists?

316
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:58,708
Isn't that a great idea?

317
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:00,833
If I don't get to kill
my share of Exorcists

318
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:02,291
I'll break your neck!

319
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:03,291
Then you better move fast...

320
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:04,666
First come, first served.

321
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,958
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...!

322
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:07,416
But try not to
kill 'em too fast,

323
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,125
it's more fun
to make 'em suffer!

324
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:12,416
I call dibs on
Allen Walker, okay?

325
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,041
Good! I'm glad to see
you've got your favorites,

326
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,208
it shows you're dedicated...!

327
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:21,666
But all our targets will be
assigned fairly and at random.

328
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:25,541
It's your responsibility
to make sure that

329
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:29,708
the person shown on your
card comes to a horrible death.

330
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,875
Take that!

331
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:45,958
You'll have to do a
lot better than that.

332
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:49,583
Good! It's so much more fun
when they try to get away.

333
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:55,250
Bet you didn't know it could
be used like that, did you!

334
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,458
You detestable little man!

335
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:05,583
Devon!

336
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:10,958
We came here to
destroy your forces...

337
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:12,916
And my companions
must be able to level up

338
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,333
while we search
for your general...

339
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:18,583
You're dead for getting
in our way Exorcist!

340
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,791
Devon!

341
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:41,625
Are you okay?

342
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:44,416
I'll be all right.

343
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,416
That's great.

344
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,166
Nobody seems to
be seriously injured.

345
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,916
I'm sorry you put your
mission on hold to help us...

346
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,583
But I'll tell you
what--why don't I make you

347
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:58,041
an extra special sandwich
to show our appreciation?

348
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,458
Sure!

349
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,583
Tyki!

350
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:07,708
Thanks a lot for stopping by

351
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:10,041
to help me with
my math homework.

352
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:13,750
What else are
big brothers good for?

353
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:20,666
If I don't watch my step
I could lose my other life.

354
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,333
I can't let that happen.

355
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,458
I must admit...

356
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:28,916
Having both a light
and a dark side...

357
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,708
is quite thrilling...

358
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:33,583
Who would have thought?

359
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:35,875
The Finder unit...

360
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:39,708
Doing everything they can
to save people's lives.

361
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:41,458
And now I'm protecting them...

362
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:45,250
After what they've done for us,
it's the least I can do.

363
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:40,291
As the two men stand there,

364
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:43,791
staring over calm oceans far
off into the blue distance,

365
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:47,958
Daisya reminisces about
his childhood by the sea.

366
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:52,625
On the next episode of
D. Gray-man: "Charity Bell."

367
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:56,333
Bring forth salvation to
this tormented Akuma's soul!
