1
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:55,916
Arystar Krory the First,
my grandfather,

2
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,833
was an odd fellow...

3
00:01:57,916 --> 00:02:00,125
He made this castle his home

4
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:02,166
and filled it with
items he had collected

5
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,708
over the years through
his many travels.

6
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:08,375
He had a taste for the
rarities of life,

7
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:09,916
treasuring more
than anything else

8
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,375
his ancient breed of plants.

9
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:14,833
The surrounding
soil must be quite rich

10
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:16,791
for the flowers to grow so much;

11
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:19,166
they're bigger than
any flora I've seen.

12
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,208
In the night, they
utter strange sounds,

13
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:22,750
but more bizarre is their taste

14
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:25,375
for attacking guests
that visit the castle.

15
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:27,416
It was because of this
that rumors about us

16
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,875
being vampires began to spread
before we knew it to be true.

17
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:33,583
Young Arystar...

18
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:36,041
Your destiny has
been chosen for you...

19
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:39,625
In this castle you will live the
remainder of your lifetime...

20
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:41,208
It is now your responsibility

21
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:44,166
to tend to our
beautiful flower garden...

22
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,833
This endeavor will bring
you happiness my grandson.

23
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:58,500
When Grandfather passed away,

24
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:00,625
I was left to my solitude,

25
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:03,958
with only his collection
of treasures as company.

26
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:06,083
The villagers had
labeled me a vampire,

27
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:08,666
assuring my status
as an outsider.

28
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,000
And although
I had the curiosity,

29
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:13,166
I never found a way
to leave the castle,

30
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,041
nor did I have
courage to attempt it.

31
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:21,875
I spent my time seeing
to the bizarre flowers,

32
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:24,416
making sure they
stayed healthy...

33
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,916
Then one day, I came
to a realization

34
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,875
that I was no different
than the collection,

35
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:35,375
so much so that I began to
see myself as a part of it.

36
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:38,500
I thought, "Everything
here belongs to Grandfather.

37
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:42,333
I have nothing to my name,
besides the clothes on my back."

38
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:44,416
There is not a person in this
world who could accept me

39
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,416
for what I am,
because I am nothing.

40
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,333
There is not a soul...
who could love me...

41
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:52,625
...when I do not
even love myself.

42
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:57,083
But Eliade...
she was different...

43
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:58,750
She accepted me without question

44
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,541
and treated me with respect,

45
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:05,291
and in return... I loved
her... with all my heart.

46
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,750
I wonder if the monks have
been able to kill Krory yet.

47
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,458
I pray that they have.

48
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:22,500
I saw a giant pillar
of flame up there before.

49
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,041
What could it have been?

50
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,875
Do you have any idea, Mayor?

51
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:28,833
I have no idea

52
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:30,625
but I think I may know
someone who does...

53
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:33,375
Is there another monk here?

54
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:35,291
I could have sworn...

55
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,791
He was staying at the inn...

56
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:39,625
But where could he have gone to?

57
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:47,500
Damn it!

58
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:48,583
How are we supposed
to help Krory

59
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:49,708
if we can't even
handle these flowers?

60
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,500
We're just gonna
have to find a way!

61
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,875
Grow grow gro...

62
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,208
Hey!!!

63
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,666
I'm gonna die!
I'm being eaten!

64
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,000
Listen... now calm down

65
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,125
and just do exactly
as I tell you, alright?

66
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:04,291
Are you nuts...?

67
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:05,791
If I... calm down I'll be...

68
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,291
Lavi, like I said...

69
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:10,416
I've... dealt with
these before...

70
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,666
We can beat these flowers...

71
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,208
I saw Cross do it!

72
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:14,375
Great!

73
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:15,833
Then why don't you
tell me how to do that?!

74
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,125
Okay...

75
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:18,625
Now... this breed of
flower doesn't bite humans

76
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:20,125
who show affection to them.

77
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:22,375
So start treating it
like it's a little puppy.

78
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,750
Make it think you really
love and care for it!

79
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:26,166
Wait Allen, are you serious?

80
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,708
Just tell it you love it
you eye patched coward!

81
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:29,958
Fine then!

82
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:31,666
I... love... you!!!

83
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:47,541
Nicely done...

84
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:50,208
You were right to turn away.

85
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:53,666
I draw my power from these orbs.

86
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,875
Your power?

87
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:57,833
Can you dodge them all at once?

88
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:08,083
The flowers... they're dying!

89
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:14,416
How would you like
some more, darling?!

90
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:20,541
God damn you!

91
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,125
It's just water?!

92
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:30,708
These orbs...

93
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:31,875
They evaporate moisture out

94
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,750
of the living subjects
to disable them.

95
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:37,708
You're right...
that is my power...

96
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,791
While I am protected
by these orbs,

97
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:44,125
no living creature can get
within striking distance of me.

98
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:45,958
That's nonsense...

99
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:47,541
How arrogant...

100
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:50,750
You committed a mortal sin by
harming Grandfather's flowers.

101
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,208
How arrogant of you...!

102
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:55,875
You don't even care
about these flowers.

103
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,750
You blame your Grandfather

104
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,541
for your pathetic
life instead of actually

105
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:02,583
finding the courage
to do something about it!

106
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,625
Dying inside this
castle is the perfect fate

107
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:08,500
for a coward like you!

108
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,875
Well...

109
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:13,416
While we were together...

110
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,541
I was content
with that thought...

111
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:19,916
Eliade.

112
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,541
Even though she's an Akuma...

113
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:26,750
I still can't deny the
fact that I love her.

114
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,958
I no longer want to see
you in that disgusting form!

115
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:34,958
So I'll gladly rip
you limb from limb!

116
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:36,500
Never...!

117
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,708
See if you can get
close enough to try!

118
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:44,791
I love you! I love you!
I love you! I love you!

119
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,375
I love you! I love you!
I love you!

120
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:53,000
Oh, man. I love you!
I love you! I love you!

121
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:55,500
I love you! I love you!
I love you!

122
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:01,166
What's that?

123
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,791
Where's fangboy?

124
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,875
There he is!

125
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:07,791
Look out! Don't touch them!

126
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:09,708
We still aren't
any closer to Krory

127
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:11,708
and these bubbles
sure aren't helpin'!

128
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:54,500
Goodbye... Arystar.

129
00:08:54,583 --> 00:09:02,041
Goodbye... Arystar.

130
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,083
Oh my darling...

131
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:07,750
There was something...
something I...

132
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:11,541
...had wanted to do with
you for the longest time.

133
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:14,791
But... it's impossible now.

134
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:47,458
Arystar... you're still
alive, aren't you?

135
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:57,791
I love you...!
I love you...! I love you!

136
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:14,458
Is he... sucking her blood?

137
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,083
I always had a feeling...

138
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:25,375
...these fangs would
be the last thing I felt.

139
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:42,208
For so long now, there
have been countless men

140
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:43,750
who would shower
me with affection

141
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:48,250
and tell me how
beautiful I looked.

142
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:03,041
But the one thing
I wanted more than anything

143
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:04,125
in the world was something

144
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:07,000
that made human
women beautiful...

145
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,583
Despite my being
prettier than most,

146
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:13,208
the smile on their
faces was pure bliss.

147
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:17,625
That's an emotion
I could never experience...

148
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:21,250
And... no matter
how much I wish...

149
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:23,958
...no matter how long I pray...

150
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:29,375
...I can never reach it...
because I am an Akuma.

151
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,791
Every man I come into contact
with dies by my hand...

152
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:38,000
In order to reach that
level of happiness...

153
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:42,208
I need a man that won't
be harmed so easily.

154
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:46,500
All I ever wanted...
was to love someone...

155
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,791
A man who I could love...

156
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,916
A man who would love me back

157
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,333
but more than anything, a man

158
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:57,666
who could survive
my deadly touch.

159
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,416
I may have found that man...

160
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:20,333
but in the end... he will
be the one who destroys me.

161
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:34,750
You... You know I...

162
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:40,083
I always wanted
to love you Arystar.

163
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:47,666
Please darling... know that...

164
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:57,750
...I tried my best.

165
00:12:57,833 --> 00:13:07,750
...I tried my best.

166
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:19,041
...I tried my best.

167
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,541
Goodbye my love.

168
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:30,958
What the...

169
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:32,958
Rain... inside the castle...

170
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:49,666
Are you okay, Krory?

171
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,833
I want to die...

172
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:59,041
I killed the woman I loved...

173
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:02,541
I took away her life....
with my own hands.

174
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:08,291
But you... had no choice.

175
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:14,458
I've become the very
monster I once despised...

176
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:17,083
Healing my own body by
sucking every last drop

177
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,166
of blood from the
veins of the one person

178
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,416
who ever cared for me.

179
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,833
Even when I knew it was going

180
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:25,750
to destroy her I kept on going!

181
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:29,750
A monster like me doesn't
deserve to take another breath.

182
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,250
If you're in so much pain...

183
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,041
Why don't you
become an Exorcist...?

184
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:51,625
It's the duty of all Exorcists
to hunt and destroy Akuma.

185
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:53,000
Whether you like it or not

186
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,958
you just destroyed an
Akuma named Eliade today...

187
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:58,541
You did that because it is
what you were meant to do...

188
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,208
Now you have two choices...

189
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:03,416
You can either wallow
here in your own self pity.

190
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,916
Or you can let Eliade's
death mean something...

191
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,250
She's not coming back,

192
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,208
so do the right thing and
make her death worth it!

193
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:16,000
Krory, whether
you like it or not,

194
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:21,083
you are an apostle of
Innocence... just like us.

195
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:44,541
Your Master did indeed
pay visit to my castle.

196
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,541
He and my Grandfather
were friends

197
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,458
and he came here when
he heard of his death...

198
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:51,166
He returned something to me
that had been under his care.

199
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,875
What did he return?

200
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:55,500
Here... This is it.

201
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,750
That... That's crazy...!

202
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,333
That pot belonged to Roseanne!

203
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,791
So you're familiar with this?

204
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,833
Unfortunately... yes...

205
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:05,125
What was planted in the
pot when he brought it?

206
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:08,083
The bulb of a
carnivorous flower.

207
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,958
I knew it.

208
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,666
Allen.

209
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,875
If something bad were
to happen to Roseanne,

210
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,500
you can expect a punishment

211
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,583
a hundred times
worse on your head.

212
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:20,250
'Kay!

213
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,041
Pay no attention...

214
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:32,000
He gets like that sometimes
when he remembers his past...

215
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:34,000
So... he only came
by to return the flower?

216
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:34,625
That's it...

217
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:36,166
Yes...

218
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,916
But there was something awfully
strange about that flower...

219
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:40,750
Out of nowhere it
bit me on my hand,

220
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,250
which caused
quite a bit of pain,

221
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:43,833
and then it quickly
withered away.

222
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:48,041
I can't breathe...!

223
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:51,583
Maybe the... flower
did this to me...

224
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:02,625
Oh no...! Mah, my teeth!

225
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,750
Now that I think about it...

226
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,208
That was probably the Innocence

227
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:13,833
you mentioned that made my
teeth grow back so quickly.

228
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:16,083
That definitely sounds
like Innocence...

229
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:18,083
Although the one thing
I'm still having trouble with

230
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:21,083
is how it came to live
inside a carnivorous flower.

231
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,833
Well what if the General
came to return the flower...

232
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:25,750
It's possible the
Innocence was lying dormant

233
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:26,958
here the entire time

234
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:30,083
and was only activated
after Cross' visit.

235
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:32,250
Ever since those fangs
grew into my mouth...

236
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:34,458
I've had an
uncontrollable bloodlust

237
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:38,541
and then... I met
Eliade shortly after.

238
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:41,083
Allen and I are looking for
the man that visited you...

239
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:42,166
Did he say anything...

240
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,500
About where he
was planning to go?

241
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:45,833
I think he did...

242
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:48,000
He said he wanted to
go somewhere far away

243
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,625
and asked me to lend
him money for his travels.

244
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:52,625
He did that here, too?

245
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,708
Are you okay?

246
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:02,958
Don't worry.
I'm fine... really I am.

247
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,333
I have a favor to ask...

248
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:06,583
Would you mind going ahead

249
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,791
and waiting for me
outside of the castle...?

250
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:12,541
I'd like some time to myself
while I prepare for the journey.

251
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:13,708
Sure.

252
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:22,250
The sun should be rising soon...

253
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,416
That sure was a
crazy night, huh?

254
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:27,708
Definitely...

255
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:28,916
However the only
clue we found out

256
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,958
about my Master is that
he came over here...

257
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,333
And the thing is

258
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:35,083
we still don't know
why he came over here.

259
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,041
Well...

260
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,041
Remember, we found a
new Exorcist in fang boy...

261
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:42,083
So it wasn't a
total waste of time.

262
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:44,666
Yeah.

263
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,791
Come on Allen,
there's no need for you

264
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,458
to act like you did
something wrong...

265
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:54,166
I mean, granted, this may not be
the ideal outcome for Krory...

266
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,750
But the fact is he
needed a reason

267
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:58,333
to go on living and
you gave that to him...

268
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,458
Given some time,
he'll feel better.

269
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:02,250
I promise...

270
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,333
That was an elegant speech...

271
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:05,375
Way to scare me!

272
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:06,541
Old fart...!

273
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,166
How long have you
been standing there?!

274
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,541
I just got here.

275
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,333
You really worry
about me that much...?

276
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,958
I can take care of myself.

277
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:14,458
I solved this case
with less effort

278
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:16,791
than it takes to change
one of your diapers.

279
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,791
That really hurt you geezer!

280
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:24,416
Don't talk to me about
effort you slimy punk!

281
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,791
You could've used
some of that "effort"

282
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:27,583
to avoid damaging the castle!

283
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,208
Well excuse me but I was
trying not to get myself killed.

284
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,375
Try listening first
before you hit me panda!

285
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,000
I didn't hit you, I kicked you!

286
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,125
Don't you know the difference?

287
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,375
It's the same thing!

288
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:37,666
No it is not!

289
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,083
What have you been
doing this whole time,

290
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,083
lounging around
and eatin' prunes?

291
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:49,875
Don't tell me...

292
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:59,958
Wait... He's still
in there... Krory!!!

293
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:16,875
Look at your faces...

294
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:18,791
You thought I died...

295
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,458
I'm sorry if I gave
you all a scare.

296
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:24,791
But as you can see, I'm fine.

297
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,375
You should know...

298
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:29,583
I fully intend on devoting my
life to becoming an Exorcist.

299
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,875
Great!

300
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,916
Eliade...

301
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,208
I have made destroying
Akuma my new life's work...

302
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:44,791
Otherwise... what right
did I have to destroy you...?

303
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:49,458
I hope you understand, my love.

304
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,166
Our new friend and colleague,

305
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,291
Krory, joins us on a mission...

306
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:44,791
But his inexperience
outside of his castle shows

307
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:47,250
when his actions
put us in danger...

308
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:52,208
Next time on D. Gray-man:
"Krory's New Beginning."

309
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:55,791
Bring forth salvation to
this tormented Akuma's soul.
