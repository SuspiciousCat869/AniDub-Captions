1
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:38,916
I see...

2
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,333
So when all was said and done,

3
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:43,333
there really wasn't any
Innocence in Dankern Village.

4
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:46,125
I'm sorry you traveled all
that way for nothing, then...

5
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:47,750
But in any case,
I'm glad you could uncover

6
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:50,083
the truth about
the town though...

7
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:51,416
And now that you have,

8
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,625
you can continue on
to Spain like we planned.

9
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:56,416
That's where I'm supposed
to meet up with Allen, right?

10
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,750
That's correct.

11
00:01:57,833 --> 00:01:58,916
And of course it's
imperative that you determine

12
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,708
the whereabouts
of General Cross.

13
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:02,958
And if you don't mind,

14
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:04,166
there's a message
I'd like for you to relay

15
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:08,125
to the Finder that's
joined you... Goz.

16
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:10,416
So then...

17
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,625
You're telling me you want me

18
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:14,583
to travel into a border
town all by myself?

19
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:16,000
When you make it
to the next village,

20
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:18,625
there should be another
Exorcist waiting to join you.

21
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:19,958
My brother would
like for both of you

22
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:21,708
to search for General Socalo.

23
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:22,875
Okay...

24
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:24,500
But until then I'll
be on my own, right?

25
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:26,083
That's right...

26
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:28,791
I'd go with you but I'm heading
to my next assignment in Spain.

27
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:31,541
You're here now...!

28
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:33,583
Why don't you just come
with me half the way?

29
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:35,125
But why?

30
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:37,583
I overheard some
townspeople talking earlier...

31
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:41,750
They said there've been reports
of wolves near the border!

32
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:44,416
I heard there were more
people attacked last night.

33
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,125
Those folks that live in
the forest are scared bad.

34
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,250
Word is... the village

35
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:50,541
by the woods is
near deserted now.

36
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,166
If the forest is
really that dangerous,

37
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,958
I don't want to go
through it all alone...

38
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:57,666
Go with me until we
get to the other side

39
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,708
of Schwarzwald and
then I'll owe you one.

40
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:01,458
What is Schwarzwald?

41
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,791
It means "Black
Forest" in German.

42
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:06,791
That's what people named the
woods with all the wolves in it.

43
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:08,875
Black Forest?

44
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:17,625
Such a dense forest...

45
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,583
And this is only the outer edge.

46
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:20,625
Yeah...

47
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:23,291
I'm wondering
how deep it goes...

48
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:26,583
It's pretty early in the
day for it to be this dark.

49
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:33,041
Did... you hear that...?
I... I think it's the wolves!

50
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:34,458
They must be hunting us!

51
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:35,083
Help me! Help!

52
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,250
Goz...! Hold on!

53
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:38,958
Hey, wait for me!

54
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:41,541
Wait up!

55
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,291
Don't shoot...! We mean no harm!

56
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:50,291
Lenalee!

57
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,000
What are you doing out here?

58
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,041
We're passing through
to the next town...

59
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:57,208
It's a small village just this
side of the border with France.

60
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:58,583
So you're heading to the border?

61
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:01,416
What village are
you coming from?

62
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,083
We came from the farming village
in the middle of the forest.

63
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,250
It wouldn't happen to be the one

64
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,750
that's been attacked
by wolves, would it?

65
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:09,416
I heard about it...

66
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,916
Was everyone able to
make it out okay...?

67
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,333
Thank god you're safe.

68
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:16,166
Yeah, well we're not
all safe, all right?

69
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:19,291
We lost more than half our
group just making it this far!

70
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:20,708
What?

71
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:24,541
We don't even know what happened
to the ones we left behind.

72
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:27,041
You mean there are
still people back there?

73
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:28,708
It was the only choice we had...

74
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,250
Even without the
sick and the old,

75
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,791
we barely made
it out alive...

76
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,750
If we'd brought
them we'd be dead!

77
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:34,958
We thought if
we could make it

78
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,375
to the next town
over we could find help...

79
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:40,083
By now I'm sure the
wolves have killed them all!

80
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,166
Where's Jessica?

81
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,083
Has anybody seen Jessica?

82
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:45,208
She's gone?

83
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:46,791
You let that girl
go wandering off...?

84
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:49,583
I thought you said you were
gonna keep a close eye on her!

85
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:52,000
But... She was here
just a few minutes ago...

86
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,208
She probably ran off scared

87
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:55,333
right after these
two showed up...

88
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:58,500
No way...! This is all my fault!

89
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,333
We're coming, Jessica!

90
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:41,250
Suman!

91
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:44,208
Lenalee...?
What are you doing here?

92
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,500
I should ask you the same.

93
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:47,666
Is this guy a
friend of yours...?

94
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,625
From the Black Order?

95
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:51,375
This is Suman Dark...

96
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:54,333
And yes, he's an
Exorcist for the Order.

97
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:56,000
You serious...

98
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:57,583
Of course I am...

99
00:05:57,666 --> 00:06:00,500
I assume that this is the Finder
you've brought to assist me...

100
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:03,708
Unfortunately this one
doesn't look very dependable.

101
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:04,666
'Scuse me?

102
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,041
He'll have to do...

103
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,625
I appreciate the help...

104
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:10,625
Saves me the trouble of going
all the way to the next town...

105
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:11,875
Let's get going.

106
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,750
What's the deal
with this guy, huh...?

107
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:16,375
He acts like Kanda
only not as nice.

108
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,000
Hey, before you take off...

109
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,708
I have a favor to ask you.

110
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:21,833
These people are
headed to the next town.

111
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,666
Help us escort them safely.

112
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,916
Escort?

113
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,125
Are you sure?

114
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,125
They come from a
village in the middle

115
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:29,458
of the forest that
was under attack.

116
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:31,708
The next town
is still miles away,

117
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,500
and the wolves
that took their village

118
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,583
could strike again
at any moment.

119
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:38,500
Is that an official
order from headquarters?

120
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:39,250
It's not...

121
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,500
It's a request.

122
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,125
Then ask someone else.

123
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:43,583
But why?

124
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,625
My assignment from
the Black Order is

125
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,333
to find and destroy Akuma,

126
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,166
and I will not
sacrifice that mission

127
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,333
to protect
civilians from wolves.

128
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,083
Why did you stop and
help that little girl

129
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:55,916
if it wasn't part of your
precious assignment?

130
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,666
I made a mistake...

131
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:01,791
Wait... Stop right there...

132
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:05,083
How can you turn your back
on all these innocent people?

133
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:09,208
Can you honestly tell me
you don't feel for them?

134
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:11,000
Quiet...

135
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:14,500
Goz!

136
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,583
What is that?

137
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:18,875
It's a giant wolf!

138
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:19,958
It can't be...!

139
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:22,416
What kind of wolf
walk on two legs?

140
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:26,083
Oh, man!

141
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:29,125
No one hurts my little pets
and gets away with it...!

142
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:30,750
You'll die for this!

143
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,958
Innocence!

144
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:34,666
Activate!

145
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,166
It's fast.

146
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,750
And highly evolved,
even for a level two.

147
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,166
Bring the wind!

148
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,958
Our business here is done.

149
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,833
Goz, come with me...

150
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,375
I have an assignment to do.

151
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:27,833
We can't go...!

152
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:30,333
What about all the villagers
who had to be left behind?

153
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:32,541
Why must you waste my time...

154
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,125
They need our help...

155
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:35,625
There are still sick
and elderly people

156
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,500
that couldn't escape
with the rest.

157
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:38,708
I told you.

158
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,583
Protecting these people
is not my mission...

159
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:41,666
No way!

160
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,208
My orders are to
locate General Socalo,

161
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,875
and that is precisely
what I intend to do...

162
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,458
The more you
bother me with this,

163
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:50,625
the farther behind I get...

164
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:53,500
Don't go...! Stay and help us!

165
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,125
My mommy's still back there...

166
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:01,791
We have to go back and
save her, so you have to help!

167
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,333
Oh, sweetheart.

168
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,500
Was your mommy one of the
people that stayed behind?

169
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,500
That's right...

170
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:09,625
It broke our
hearts to leave her,

171
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,208
but we knew there
was no way she could

172
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:13,958
make the journey
in her condition.

173
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:15,208
Ever since her husband died,

174
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:18,041
she worked in the
fields to make ends meet.

175
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:21,208
Before long she pushed
herself too hard and took ill.

176
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,458
When we left her, all she asked

177
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:26,250
was that we take good
care of her only daughter.

178
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,333
Jessica.

179
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:30,916
Poor Jessica!

180
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,250
That must have
been so hard for you!

181
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,291
But it's all gonna
be fine now, okay?

182
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,916
We'll go back for your mommy!

183
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,458
We'll save her...

184
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:40,916
Right, Suman?

185
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,583
My mission comes first.

186
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:43,791
How could you?

187
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:44,833
Please come...

188
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:46,708
It'll be easier
with three of us...

189
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,833
And if the wolves are being
controlled by an Akuma,

190
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:51,166
it's your responsibility
to help them!

191
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,250
I'm sure you can handle
this one on your own...

192
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,458
Maybe you have time to
run errands for strangers,

193
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,625
but my work is more
important than that.

194
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,000
Suman...

195
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:01,666
Hey! No... Stop mister!

196
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:09,250
My mommy gave me this.

197
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:13,375
She said to only use
it in a real emergency.

198
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:18,125
Will you save my
mommy for this much?

199
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:26,583
That's the saddest
thing I ever heard!

200
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,458
All right.

201
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:32,708
I'm certainly not in the
business of doing favors...

202
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,125
But if you're hiring
me for an assignment,

203
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,125
that's a different story.

204
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:44,666
What's with this guy?

205
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,166
Please be careful out there!

206
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:48,791
Don't worry.

207
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,000
No matter what,

208
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,000
we'll make sure nothing
happens to Jessica.

209
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,625
Let's get a move on.

210
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,666
Wolves do their
hunting at night...

211
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,125
If we don't get
through the forest

212
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:59,208
and safely into the
village by sundown,

213
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,833
we'll have a big problem.

214
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:18,125
This is the work of an Exorcist.

215
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:19,625
Sure looks like it...

216
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:22,708
The enemy has finally
wandered onto our turf!

217
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,125
Yes...

218
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,458
They will pay for our brother's
death with their lives.

219
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:27,875
We're killing them all, right?

220
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:30,750
A bunch of fresh souls
for the Millennium Earl!

221
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,541
It's starting to get dark...

222
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,625
Try to stay close.

223
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:54,291
Jessica!

224
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:55,041
Mommy!

225
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,083
You're okay!

226
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,000
Why on earth did
you come back here?

227
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:01,416
You were all alone so we came
to rescue you from the wolves!

228
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,208
Thank you...

229
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:04,458
Tell me, then.

230
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:07,583
Everyone made it safely
to the next town, right?

231
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,958
Johanna and Old Man
Hansen didn't make it...

232
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,625
Wolves came and took 'em away.

233
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,125
And there were others, too...

234
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,041
So many!

235
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:25,625
If the forest was so dangerous,

236
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:29,583
why didn't you stay in the
town with everyone else?

237
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,416
All I wanted was for
you to be safe, Jessica!

238
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:36,916
The important thing
is you're together...

239
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,458
If you'll come with us,

240
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,416
we can do our best to get you
both to the next village...

241
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,083
But we don't have a lot of time.

242
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:42,833
It's too late.

243
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:44,125
We're staying.

244
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:45,583
It's getting dark...

245
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,125
And traveling through the
forest at night with a child

246
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:49,416
and a sick woman
would be suicide.

247
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,458
We'll hold up here
for the time being;

248
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:55,333
then start making
our way to town

249
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:58,125
as soon as the sun comes up.

250
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,208
What do you have there?

251
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:18,333
It's not your shift for
another couple of hours.

252
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:20,250
So what do you want?

253
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,375
I wanted to ask
if you still feel bitter

254
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:25,875
about the way you came to
be a part of the Black Order.

255
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,708
It was five years ago
that you joined...

256
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,375
I know at the time
you really didn't have

257
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,500
any interest in
becoming an Exorcist,

258
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,083
and I wondered if
after all these years,

259
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,583
you still felt the same way.

260
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:37,958
What kind of person chooses

261
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:39,791
to risk their
well-being every day

262
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:43,208
fighting Akuma and monsters?

263
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:46,041
God chose to create me
with this thing on my arm,

264
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,833
and ripped away
any choice I had.

265
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,541
You're not the only
one that was forced

266
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:53,166
into joining the Order
against their will.

267
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,375
When they realized I was
compatible with the Dark Boots,

268
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:59,041
they immediately separated
me from my brother.

269
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,041
We've got to keep
her restrained...

270
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,958
Her abilities are unknown...

271
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:06,625
Her life must be cherished.

272
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:08,125
She's not an experiment...

273
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:11,166
She shall make a
powerful Exorcist.

274
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:15,541
I... want to go home...

275
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:18,791
Let me... see my brother.

276
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:21,208
I was there for three years...

277
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:23,291
Until Komui, came
to be the supervisor

278
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:27,583
at the Black Order,
that place was my prison.

279
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,375
But now, I honestly can't
imagine my life without it...

280
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:33,708
If I didn't have my friends
in the Order to fight for,

281
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:36,083
I don't know what I'd do.

282
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,750
If you still feel
like the Order is

283
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:38,791
your own personal prison,

284
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,541
I can't say
I don't understand...

285
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:43,625
But they've become the greatest
family you could ask for.

286
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:48,708
And when my family is
involved, I put up a fight...

287
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:51,125
But I guess that's just me.

288
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,208
Your family, huh?

289
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,500
Um... Hey guys?

290
00:14:57,583 --> 00:15:00,416
We can't let Jessica run
around outside like that, Goz!

291
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,458
Sorry...

292
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:05,333
She was pretty
persuasive, though.

293
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,583
Wanna play a game?

294
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,458
Queen to D-1...

295
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:29,583
Jessica's father made the pieces

296
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,833
for that chess set
himself, you know.

297
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:34,791
Oh?

298
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,000
I gotta a checkmate...

299
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:38,750
Huh...? Checkmate...?
Hold on a second...

300
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,958
That's a checkmate
if I ever saw one.

301
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,541
There has to be another move!

302
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:45,333
She beat you fair and square,
why can't you just admit it...?

303
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:48,000
I mean, you're not really
a sore loser, are ya?

304
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:50,750
I don't remember
asking for your input!

305
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,541
Are you sure that's
where you wanna move...?

306
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,291
Because you can
still change your mind.

307
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:57,083
I bet he'd make a great dad.

308
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,833
Attack!

309
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,541
Suman... There are too many!

310
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,958
Keep your head down!

311
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,750
Hold onto something...

312
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,041
Nice job!

313
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,666
Look at all of them...

314
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,791
Look at the damage
you've done...!

315
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:09,833
How dare you harm
our little ones!

316
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:11,500
This is unforgivable...

317
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:14,458
We're going to
have to kill you now.

318
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,666
Jessica!

319
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:24,875
Put that girl down.

320
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:26,208
We don't take it very lightly

321
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,916
when someone like you goes
around harming our pets.

322
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,583
Maybe if we show
you what it feels like

323
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:33,041
you might finally
learn your lesson, huh?

324
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,958
Isn't she adorable...?

325
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:37,250
It'd almost be a
shame to kill her.

326
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:41,583
I said leave her alone!

327
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:45,916
Moving will only let
the poison work faster...

328
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,541
I told you about the poison
in my fangs, right...?

329
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,666
Because if it spreads
through your entire body,

330
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,958
you're a dead man!

331
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:53,458
But what's the fun in you dying

332
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:56,416
if you don't even get to
see me kill this little girl?

333
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,666
It'd be such a shame
if you missed it.

334
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,750
I'll kill you,
before that happens...

335
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,083
What the--?!

336
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,666
I hate to disappoint...

337
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,083
I've gotta Parasite-Type
Anti-Akuma weapon,

338
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,916
so your poison fangs don't
have any affect on me...

339
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,291
You'll pay for that!

340
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,000
Jessica!

341
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,625
Why you--!

342
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,416
Thanks, I owe you one...

343
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,916
We're not out of here yet...

344
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,708
Let's go!

345
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:36,583
Unforgivable!

346
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,666
Die! Die! Die!

347
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:52,875
Bring the Wind!

348
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,041
Nice work...

349
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:08,000
Okay... Now you can owe me.

350
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:20,250
How can I thank you for
everything you've done?

351
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:23,333
I'm proud of you for not getting
scared back there, Jessica...

352
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:25,375
I think you've earned this.

353
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,083
All right then, Lenalee...

354
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,791
I guess this is goodbye...

355
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,583
Thank you for all your help.

356
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:44,500
Have a good trip...

357
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,166
And be safe... okay?

358
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,958
I hope we run into
each other again.

359
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:48,958
We will...

360
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,500
Until then, take
care of yourself.

361
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:54,708
Thank you...! Goodbye!

362
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:56,041
When everybody
starts feeling better

363
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:57,333
and goes back to the village,

364
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:59,541
you'll have to
come visit us, okay?

365
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:02,791
Promise me you'll come!

366
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:09,666
Wow...

367
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,250
Ya know I almost wish
I'd been there to see it!

368
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,416
I've heard about
that Suman guy...

369
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,250
Who'd have thought he'd actually
turn out to be a nice person?

370
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,375
I know...

371
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:19,166
He's a little rough
around the edges,

372
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,250
but I think deep down
he's a really great guy.

373
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:23,916
The way he acted with Jessica,

374
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,083
I can almost imagine him as
a regular, everyday father.

375
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,875
Maybe he even has
a family of his own

376
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:31,875
somewhere that we
don't know anything about.

377
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,500
It almost killed me,
but I made it.

378
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:50,250
Could we finally take a break
and sit down for a minute?

379
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,875
We're behind
schedule as it is...

380
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:54,083
Let's move.

381
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:56,458
I only wanted to rest
my legs for a little bit.

382
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:57,625
Hey, where are you going?

383
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,208
Wait for me!

384
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:40,583
Akuma have started traveling

385
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:43,750
in the largest packs any
of us have ever seen.

386
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:45,458
One thing is for certain,

387
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:47,875
something big
is about to happen.

388
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:50,833
On the next episode
of D. Gray-man:

389
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:52,458
"Shroud of Darkness."

390
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:56,166
Bring forth salvation to
this tormented Akuma's soul!
