00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,208
[ALLEN]
Please, Innocence.

2
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:41,541
If I can't activate
you like before,

3
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:44,208
then we have to find
another way to synchronize!

4
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:45,791
A better, stronger way!

5
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:48,458
Let's fuse together even
more and make a weapon

6
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:51,416
great enough to
protect the world!

7
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,500
[ALLEN shudders]

8
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:55,583
[TYKI] I don't know
what you're trying to do,

9
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:58,208
but you're not
going to succeed.

10
00:01:58,291 --> 00:01:59,750
[TYKI gasps]

11
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,291
[ALLEN] My left arm
is for Akuma.

12
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,875
My right arm's for humans.

13
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:12,291
I'm supposed to save them both.
That's what I decided.

14
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:15,375
You and I are together as one.

15
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:20,500
[TYKI]
That sword!

16
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:28,791
Achieving transcendence.
Crown Clown is now active!

17
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,708
Be careful, Allen.

18
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:56,125
[LAVI] Lenalee! Please!
Wake up! Lenalee!

19
00:02:56,208 --> 00:03:00,416
[OTHER LAVI] It's you
who needs to wake up, Lavi.

20
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:05,291
Take a look around. She's
just another historical relic.

21
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,125
[LAVI gasps]

22
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:13,625
Will you ever learn?
A Bookman must be an observer

23
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:17,291
and recorder of history,
not an active participant.

24
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:20,791
You are to witness and document
events without prejudice.

25
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:23,958
If a Bookman develops emotional
attachment to his subjects,

26
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:26,166
he's compromised.

27
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,375
[OTHER LAVI] The worst thing
you could do is sympathize

28
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,875
with a moment of history, Lavi.

29
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:39,583
[LAVI] Hold on. I know this
is some kind of illusion.

30
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:42,166
I need to find a way
out of this place.

31
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,333
I won't get lost!
I won't break!

32
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,500
That's the spirit. Struggle.

33
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:52,791
[crashing noise]

[LENALEE grunts]

35
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:00,375
Lenalee, stop it!

[LENALEE pants]

37
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:05,208
[CHAOZII] You can't
keep doing that!

38
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,458
You'll permanently
injure your legs!

39
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,458
[LENALEE]
I have to fight.

40
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:23,833
[CHAOZII grunts]

41
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:26,250
No, Chaozii!
Your hand!

42
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,000
Say whatever you want!

43
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:31,000
You aren't going to
convince me to stop!

44
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:36,041
[CHAOZII grunts]

45
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:48,083
You're wasting blood
and time, lero!

46
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:50,333
You're only a pathetic human,
so there's no way

47
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:53,208
you'll ever break through
that barrier, lero!

48
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,458
I won't give up!

49
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:57,750
[CHAOZII grunts]

50
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:04,291
I'm useless. How am I supposed
to help you Exorcists

51
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,958
when I'm so weak?

52
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,791
Chaozii...

53
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,291
[LERO laughs]

54
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:11,625
What did I tell you, lero?

55
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:14,250
Humans are incredibly
stupid, lero!

56
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,250
Isn't that right,
Mistress Road?

57
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,458
Huh? Mistress Road?

58
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:32,041
[TYKI] Well, this is an
interesting turn of events.

59
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:36,541
His arm became a sword.
That isn't fair.

60
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:40,583
That sword...
It looks just like...

61
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:42,125
Power up.

62
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,541
Give me power!

63
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:50,166
All right, Crown Clown!
Let's get outta here!

64
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,125
I won't let you!

00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,833
[LENALEE, CHAOZII gasp]

[TYKI grunts]

67
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,541
[ROAD]
What's happening, Tycky?

68
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:13,375
[TYKI]
A surprising human feat.

69
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:17,583
So surprising it's hard to find
anything humorous about it.

70
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:22,916
[TYKI] Did I bring out
something terrible in him?

71
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,250
[ROAD]
I know that sword.

What was that?

00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:02,750
[LENALEE whimpers]

76
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:04,875
You okay, Lenalee?

77
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,583
[LENALEE] I'm getting
such a strange feeling.

78
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:10,250
Allen is emitting
intense energy.

79
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:15,333
It's so overwhelming,
it's almost frightening. Why?

80
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:18,375
I will protect my friends!

81
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,000
We'll see about that!

82
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:22,666
[ALLEN yells]

83
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,625
I'll never understand
why you fight so hard.

84
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:28,541
You of all people
should know why!

85
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:30,000
[TYKI]
Huh?

86
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,416
We're the same! Don't you
fight to protect something?

Hm?

00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,708
[EEZE]
Oh, wow.

Hey, now there's a pretty stone!

Yep!

[KLACK]
By the way, Tyki.

105
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:34,291
You given any thought to what
we discussed the other day?

106
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:35,291
[TYKI]
I did.

107
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,083
We've dug this place to hell.

108
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,208
There's nothing left here
but worthless stones.

109
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,833
As it stands, who knows
if we'll even get paid?

110
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:44,166
Their conditions
better be good.

111
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,000
The supervisor at the new
place and I are old friends.

112
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,041
I negotiated us good terms.

113
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:52,625
[TYKI] Then it sounds like a
move is the best thing for us.

114
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:56,250
And Eeze too. The situation
here is too tough for a kid.

Tycky. Snap out of it!

[TYKI gasps]

133
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,791
[ROAD] You were
daydreaming again.

134
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:49,750
What were you thinking about?

135
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:52,791
Oh, it was nothing important.

136
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,791
You always take a button
off their coats.

137
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,833
What are you saving them for?

138
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:05,958
What's it matter
what I do with them?

139
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,458
See you later, Road.

140
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,458
You can play coy all you want,

141
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:12,416
but I know all
your secrets, Tycky.

142
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:17,291
How you spend your days
and the company you keep.

143
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:21,125
Really. Don't you think you're
too close to these lowly humans?

144
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:22,666
[TYKI gasps]

145
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:26,375
Hm. Not like it's my
business what you do.

146
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:30,291
Just make sure it doesn't
interfere with your real job.

147
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:32,208
Yeah. Right.

148
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:36,458
Fighting to protect
something, huh?

149
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:39,416
[ALLEN grunts]

150
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,833
[TYKI] Not that I've
grown completely numb

151
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:42,416
to those feelings.

152
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,416
But I'm finding more
often than not...

153
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,500
...I do things for
my own enjoyment!

154
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:48,041
[ALLEN grunts]

155
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,541
[TYKI] It's hard to think
about others when I'm having

156
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:54,833
such a blast destroying
and killing.

157
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:57,833
Sometimes I don't know
what to do with myself.

158
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:00,125
But that's my burden.
I'm the Noah

159
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:04,500
with the memory of pleasure.
The one and only, Tyki Mikk.

160
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:07,500
You should give up,
Tyki Mikk. While you can!

161
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:08,291
That so?

162
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,333
[ALLEN yells]

163
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:11,875
You can't stop me.

164
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:13,541
You wanna bet?

165
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:16,416
[TYKI]
What?

166
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,791
[TYKI cries out]

167
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,625
--Lero?
--Tycky? No!

168
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:22,208
He did it!

169
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:23,916
[LENALEE]
I can't believe it.

170
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,958
Allen hates fighting humans.

171
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,833
Even battling the Noah
stresses him out.

172
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:30,750
But unless I'm dreaming...

173
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:35,500
He just cut one down.
Without any hesitation!

174
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:40,083
[TYKI pants]

175
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,750
[TYKI]
Huh? Huh?

176
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:47,875
What the hell is going
on here? I'm still alive?

177
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,333
I feel the pain
from being sliced,

178
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:54,125
and yet, there's no blood!

179
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:57,125
Is this some kind
of magic trick, boy?

180
00:11:57,208 --> 00:12:00,000
I can assure you
that it's no illusion.

181
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,958
[ALLEN] What I cut through
wasn't your body.

182
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:06,250
[TYKI gasps]

183
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:09,083
[TYKI retches]

184
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:12,833
It's something
deeper than flesh.

185
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:16,750
[TYKI]
The Noah inside of me is...

186
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:23,666
[TYKI screams]

187
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,041
[ROAD] Does that sword
have the power to destroy

188
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:28,250
the Noah that dwells within us?

189
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:32,958
[ALLEN] It kills the demon,
while leaving the human alive.

190
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:36,541
That's the power my
Crown Clown and I possess.

191
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:45,708
[TYKI wails]

192
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:48,291
[ROAD] So that's the power
of the Crown Clown.

193
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,625
A blade that both
spares our humanity,

194
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:53,458
while cutting through
the Noah inside of us.

195
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:57,291
An Innocence that exorcises
only the enemies of God.

196
00:12:57,375 --> 00:13:00,375
A perfect reflection
of Allen Walker's heart.

197
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:03,333
To think he's this
well-meaning, even in battle.

198
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:06,125
He really is a clown.

199
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:09,708
Are you watching this, Earl?
He's the one.

200
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:14,583
The boy you couldn't change
into a demon. Allen Walker.

201
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,666
[TYKI]
Wh--? What gives?

202
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:23,041
You tried cutting the Noah
out of me. Is that it?

203
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:27,500
You're not going to
kill me? Just the Noah?

204
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,791
[TYKI laughs]

205
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:33,000
[TYKI]
You're weak. Too soft.

206
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,791
That sword of yours...

207
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:38,166
It's only a tool to
ease your conscience!

208
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,125
Say what you want.

209
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:45,666
I know what I'm doing and take
responsibility for my actions.

210
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,125
[ROAD]
Tycky!

211
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:49,500
[LERO]
Careful, Mistress Road!

212
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:57,166
Don't.

213
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,791
[ROAD gasps]

214
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:06,958
[TYKI] There are two sides.
Light Tyki and Dark Tyki.

215
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:11,000
Duality can have
its perks. But...

216
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:14,083
What'll happen when
one of them is removed?

217
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,166
Life would be easier.

218
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:19,958
No. It'll probably
just be boring.

219
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,958
[ALLEN]
If you won't give up...

220
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:40,750
I'll force you to!
It's over!

221
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:49,791
[TYKI]
Huh.

222
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:53,416
Well, this is regrettable.

223
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:59,333
I'm sorry, Road. Farewell.

Thank you, Mr. Tyki!

227
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:13,166
[TYKI] Eeze. Sorry I can't
bring you any more souvenirs.

228
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,375

[ROAD] Tyki's Noah...
I can't feel it anymore.

232
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,791
It's been completely erased.

Did Allen just
destroy a Noah?

Yeah, he did!

Don't move.

If you do,
I'll kill all your friends.

it's absolutely certain
everyone else will die.

I really like you, Allen.

But my family will
always come first.

I said don't move.

Look. I'm angry
with you right now.

[ROAD] But even that
wouldn't be enough.

You're going to have
to pay for what you did

to my family, Allen.
You hurt him.

So I'll do the same thing
to someone close to you.

[ALLEN]
No, Road, you can't!

I was born from your memories.

you find me vexing

00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:22,833
Lavi...

320
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:27,958
[LAVI] This isn't real!
This isn't real!

321
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:30,000
Haven't I told you
again and again

322
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:32,458
how to survive
through hardships?

323
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,458
[LAVI] Don't get confused
by what you see.

324
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:38,000
Close your eyes.
Stay calm, Lavi.

325
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,125
[BOOKMAN chuckles]

326
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:45,125
[BOOKMAN]
Cut them down, Lavi!

327
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:48,458
[ZOMBIES growl]

328
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:24,875
[ALLEN] Lavi struggles between
his sworn duty as a Bookman

329
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:28,583
and the path his heart
yearns for him to follow.

330
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:33,583
As both sides battle,
only one will survive.

331
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:36,666
On the next
D. Gray-man, "Lavi."

332
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:39,875
Bring forth salvation
to this poor Akuma's soul!

333
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:42,541
[ALLEN]
I'm late!

334
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:47,875
Well, boy. Looks like your
worst enemy is punctuality.

335
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:53,041
What? First poker! Now school!
Why is everything a competition?

336
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:54,583
[LAVI laughs]

337
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:56,750
Just be on time, Allen.
