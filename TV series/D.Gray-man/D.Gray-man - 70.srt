[FO, BAK gasp]

170
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,166
Now, the main event.

171
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:26,000
Decompose! [laughs]

172

--[BAK grunts]
--[FO whimpers]

173
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,625
[BAK]
I... I'm still alive.

174
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:44,000
[FO]
We survived, Bak.

175
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:46,083
[BAK gasps]

176
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:49,583
Walker's Innocence
is finally active.

177
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:50,750
That's crazy.

178
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:54,000
It repelled the threads
from that Akuma!

179
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:01,916
I'll break you
into little pieces!

180
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,583
Die!

181
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:15,833
[AKUMA A groaning]

182
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,958
[groaning continues]

183
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,750
[ALLEN]
Let's go.

184
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,750
[BOTH laughing]

185
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,666
[ALLEN]
Let's go...

186
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,833
...together.

187
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,375
[ALL gasp]

188
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,791
Walker... You...

189
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,250
No way.

190
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,833
Is that really him?

191
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:58,375
Finally!

192
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,375
Good job, kid.

193
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:04,750
[AKUMA A growls]
You little wretch.

194
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:09,500
[yelling]

195
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:13,166
This poor Akuma needs salvation.

196
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:22,166
Ha!

197
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,375
His left arm's back!

198
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,750
Go get 'em, Walker!

199
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:29,875
[ALLEN]
My right arm protects humans.

200
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:33,458
And my left arm protects Akuma.

201
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:37,833
May your soul rest in peace.

202
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:02,708
Let me ask you something Akuma.

203
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,500
Where did you plan to take me,

204
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:08,000
and who gave you the order
to take me there?

205
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:11,000
Sorry, kid. Can't tell you.

206
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:13,041
[laughs]

207
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:18,291
Unless you promise
to spare my life if I do.

208
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,541
That's fair enough.

209
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,000
Now tell me...

210
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:29,083
[laughing] Do you think
I was born yesterday?!

211
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:30,458
You're not gonna spare me!

212
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:33,750
Nice try though, clown boy!

213
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:37,166
I'm serious. I don't
want to hurt you.

214
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,333
I can help you.

215
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,625
I just want to save your soul.

216
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:44,666
[AKUMA A] Hold on, I thought you
were on the humans' side.

217
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,958
I am.

218
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,000
Well, half of me is.

219
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,166
But the other half is different.

220
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,666
That side wants to
help Akuma like you.

221
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:58,125
I will bring salvation
to this poor Akuma's soul.

222
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:04,250
Oh dear, what's this feeling?

223
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:08,000
Heh, heh, heh. Everything feels
so wonderful all of a sudden!

224
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:09,458
All right then.

225
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:10,916
I'll answer you.

226
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,458
It was one of the Noahs
who sent me here.

227
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:15,750
Sir Tyki Mikk, actually.

228
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:20,000
I can't help but wonder what's
going on in Edo right about now.

229
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,166
It's not just him.

230
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,416
Oh, no, four other
Noahs are there too,

231
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,416
and even the Earl himself!
Isn't that something?

232
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,625
Uh-oh.

233
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:33,250
Are you afraid now?

234
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,541
Thank you for that.

235
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:49,875
Now, take Noah's Ark.

236
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:53,458
You'll need to reach Edo
as soon as you possibly can.

237
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:55,666
Hurry.

238
00:18:55,750 --> 00:19:00,958
I promise that it'll carry you
safely across the distance.

239
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:03,166
Why, Akuma?

240
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,333
[AKUMA A]
"Why"?

241
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:06,541
[ALLEN]
Yes.

242
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:09,291
Why would you share that
information with me?

243
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:12,625
[AKUMA A]
Because a Noah commanded me to--

244
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:15,000
Wait, no.

245
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:17,875
I wonder...

246
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:24,625
I don't know why, but suddenly
I feel so warm and peaceful.

247
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:31,458
Finally.

248
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:33,291
I'm saved.

249
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:36,541
It's been so long.

250
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:39,041
Thank you, Allen.

251
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:54,125
Goodnight, Akuma.

252
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,833
Walker...

253
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,625
[NARRATOR]
And so, in that moment,

254
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:12,916
Allen Walker was able to realize

255
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,458
and obtain his Innocence
in its truest form.

256
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:21,041
And it was chronicled
by the name...

257
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,708
...the clown of God.

258
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:26,416
Crown Clown.

259
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:07,458
[ALLEN] When Noah's Ark
appears unexpectedly,

260
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:09,666
the Asian Branch
devotes all its energy

261
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,500
to tackling the
mysterious phenomenon.

262
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,583
And now that I've got
my Innocence back,

263
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:17,291
there's something important
I have to do.

264
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:19,375
On the next <i>D.Gray-man</i> :

265
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:20,916
"The Name Chronicled."

266
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,583
Bring salvation to this
poor Akuma's soul!

267
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:25,791
[FO]
Stupid Bak.

268
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:28,458
I'm here. What?

269
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:29,791
[FO]
Nothing, nevermind.

270
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:33,833
[sighs] Okay then.

271
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:35,500
[FO]
Hey! Stupid Bak.

272
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:36,583
What now?

273
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:39,041
[FO]
Eh, just forget it.

274
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:40,791
Whatever...

275
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,541
[FO]
Stupid Bak!

276
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:47,291
[BAK groans] All right,
that's enough of that!

277
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:50,750
What'd you have to go
and hit me for?!

278
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:52,125
[FO]
Because I like you.

279
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:52,916
Huh?

280
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
[FO]
Sorry, I meant...

281
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:55,750
...I like hitting you!

282
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:57,791
[BAK growls]
