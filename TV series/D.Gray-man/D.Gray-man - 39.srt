1
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,375
This is hardly the
time to take a break!

2
00:01:58,541 --> 00:02:00,083
We have to keep moving.

3
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:01,750
Right.

4
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,666
Did you locate Daisya?

5
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,333
No... Not yet.

6
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:03,875
His Golem was transmitting
a weak signal earlier...

7
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:05,708
Maybe it gave out.

8
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:06,625
Maybe.

9
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:07,916
Daisya can look after himself.

10
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,416
He's bound to be
here by morning.

11
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,416
All right...

12
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,416
I'll start heading
your way, too.

13
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:25,416
My patience has run out...

14
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,166
I've seen that skin color...

15
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,083
And I've seen those
scars...! Are you...

16
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:32,333
One of the Clan of Noah?

17
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:34,583
And what if I said yes?

18
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:37,416
Charity Bell...! Activate!

19
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,583
Ohhh... That was scary.

20
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:54,750
If you liked that,

21
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:57,375
then you'll really
get a kick out of this!

22
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,291
How clever.

23
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,583
Well, I guess that's
the end of that...

24
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:38,375
But how did you--?

25
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,791
You're referring
to your end, right?

26
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:51,958
I'm really going
to enjoy killing you!

27
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,750
What...? Daisya...?
Is that you?

28
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,375
Daisya no!

29
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,708
Whatever you're gonna do...

30
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,125
Do it.

31
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:13,250
That was faster than I expected.

32
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:24,250
If you have any last
requests, now's the time.

33
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:25,958
There's nothing...

34
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,916
Just do it.

35
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,708
Very well.

36
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:49,833
At least... I was never bored.

37
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:10,625
If I don't watch my step,
I could lose my other life.

38
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:13,666
I can't let that happen.

39
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,958
I must admit...

40
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:19,416
Having both a light
and a dark side...

41
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,250
Is quite thrilling...

42
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:24,125
Who would have thought?

43
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:38,208
That's Daisya's Golem all right.

44
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:12,041
We've received instructions
to have his body transported

45
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,375
to the Order along
with the Finders.

46
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:15,916
And the Akuma?

47
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,291
We've successfully
driven every one

48
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:18,625
of them from the city...

49
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,333
There are still a few
outside the south border,

50
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:21,958
but we're keeping
an eye on them.

51
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,083
We can't just leave them

52
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:24,791
and hope they'll
go away on their own.

53
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:27,458
Besides, the General is
still out there somewhere.

54
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:29,208
There's only one
thing we can do.

55
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,250
Yeah.

56
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,458
Look after Daisya.

57
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,583
I was expecting more.

58
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,250
It is him!

59
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:05,375
At least there won't be
much cleaning up afterwards.

60
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:10,708
I call on the Maker
of Eden... Activate!

61
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:14,291
And acknowledge all the beauty
that there is in this world.

62
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:18,208
Art!

63
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,833
Wait, what's he doing?

64
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,208
Is that an anti-Akuma weapon?

65
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,416
General!

66
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:53,083
Kanda...! How long has it been?

67
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:01,250
Poor boy...

68
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,625
Daisya deserved
better than that.

69
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,500
May he rest in peace.

70
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,458
He was always a good kid...

71
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:10,583
Even when he used to break my
glasses with his Charity Bell,

72
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:13,666
I knew he had such
a gift for doing good!

73
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:17,125
His body is scheduled to be
shipped to Headquarters today.

74
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,875
The Order also took his
Charity Bell for safekeeping...

75
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,625
We're escorting the body...

76
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:24,875
Marie and I would be honored if
you would join us on the trip.

77
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,125
If my memory serves me,

78
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,625
Daisya came from the
town of Bodrum, didn't he?

79
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,041
Huh...? Oh...

80
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,083
That's right.

81
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:35,041
It's a breathtaking
little village

82
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:38,500
on the edge of the Aegean Sea.

83
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:41,041
General...

84
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,041
We believe the enemy is
after you for your Innocence,

85
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,333
and they'll stop at
nothing until they get it.

86
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:47,791
I haven't seen the Bodrum
shoreline in many years,

87
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:49,958
so this sketch
may not be accurate.

88
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:54,541
Daisya...

89
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,750
May your hometown find
you and bring you comfort,

90
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,541
no matter where you are...

91
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,791
Goodbye, my dear old friend.

92
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,916
I won't be traveling with you.

93
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,708
I'm a General of the Order,
and a General can't walk off

94
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:13,375
the battlefield in
the middle of a war...

95
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:14,750
And besides...

96
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:18,666
It's my duty to find
and train new Exorcists.

97
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,666
If God hasn't already
given up on us...

98
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:26,708
we should be on the lookout in
case he sends more disciples.

99
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,708
I knew he'd say
something like that.

100
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:31,166
Some people never
change, do they?

101
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:33,500
General Tiedoll.

102
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:35,333
We're coming with you.

103
00:10:48,708 --> 00:11:00,041
Oh no!

104
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,166
Allen...! Lenalee!

105
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,416
Yeah, hello...

106
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,958
Is Devon around?

107
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,500
It can't be...

108
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,375
No!

109
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:27,125
Yes, I understand.

110
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:29,208
We'll contact you again soon.

111
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:36,625
Chief...

112
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,500
That was a call
from the unit in Spain.

113
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:41,583
It seems the battle in
Barcelona is finally over.

114
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:42,833
And the General?

115
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:45,083
As far as we know,
General Tiedoll is safe...

116
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:48,208
And the Akuma force has
been driven from the city.

117
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,458
Excellent.

118
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:53,583
However--

119
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:56,916
Many units sustained
heavy casualties...

120
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,458
And there's more.

121
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:02,375
Units in other regions are
reporting losses as well.

122
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:03,833
We have no choice...

123
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:06,416
All we can do is wait and
have faith in our people.

124
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,166
That's strange...

125
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,916
How did I end up here?

126
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,416
What's this?

127
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:32,250
I guess I must have taken
a wrong turn somewhere...

128
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,791
I'll have to ask
someone for directions.

129
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:40,416
Do you think we got them all?

130
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:43,916
Yeah.

131
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,416
Those monsters gave us more
trouble than I expected.

132
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,291
If we don't find General Socolo
soon, it might be too late.

133
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:50,916
Right.

134
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:17,041
From the Tiedoll Unit,
Daisya Barry.

135
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:18,708
From Socolo Unit...

136
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:22,375
Kazarna Rido...
and Charcar Lavong.

137
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,125
From Klaud Unit...

138
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:27,291
Tina Spark, Gwen Frere,
and Sol Galen.

139
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:28,458
All told...

140
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,791
Six Exorcists gave
their lives in battle.

141
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:32,000
Including Finders,

142
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:34,416
that brings the number
of confirmed dead...

143
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,000
to one hundred and forty eight.

144
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:51,333
I can't believe we've lost
so many of our members...

145
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,958
And for six Exorcists to
fall in a single battle...

146
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:55,791
It's completely unheard of...!

147
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,333
For apostles of God,
they didn't last very long.

148
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:00,041
If they couldn't
stand up to the enemy,

149
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:02,083
what chance do the
rest of us have...?

150
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,625
It's only a matter of time.

151
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,291
The Millennium Earl...

152
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,500
Do you think he'll kill us all?

153
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:11,916
I've heard enough.

154
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,333
A hundred and forty-eight
soldiers died to keep you safe.

155
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,541
They deserve more
than your whining...

156
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,458
Welcome home.

157
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:32,041
You will not be forgotten.

158
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:41,791
So, the same cause of
death as General Yeager?

159
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,291
That's right...

160
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,083
The autopsies showed that
the bodies of three Exorcists

161
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:48,375
were in the exact same
condition as the General's.

162
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:51,083
Daisya, Barry, and both
men from the Socalo Unit...

163
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,166
Rido and Lavong.

164
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:57,000
Although there are no visible
openings on the bodies,

165
00:15:57,083 --> 00:16:00,708
each of them has had one of
their organs completely removed.

166
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:03,708
That can only mean...

167
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:06,041
The Clan of Noah.

168
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,750
Both the Socalo
and Tiedoll Units

169
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:12,625
were three-man teams, leaving
three Exorcists who survived...

170
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,500
Do we have reports
on their status?

171
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:17,583
Kanda and Marie from Tiedoll
Unit returned unharmed...

172
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:20,875
That much has
been confirmed... But--

173
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:24,250
The third member of Socalo
Unit is still missing...

174
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,250
Suman Dark.

175
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,250
That is surprising.

176
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,125
Chief Komui!

177
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:31,583
What is it?

178
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:33,666
We'd like permission to go
to our Leader's hometown,

179
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,666
so we can give his
remains to his family.

180
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,083
And you are?

181
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,666
I'm one of the members
of the Arias Unit...

182
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,458
We were attacked
by a swarm of Akuma

183
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:44,083
in a mountain pass as we
were traveling to India.

184
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,375
Our leader sacrificed himself

185
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:47,458
to make sure the rest
of us got out alive...

186
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,000
Before he died...

187
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:52,208
He told me he had a son back
home who would be about my age.

188
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:53,541
I'm begging you...

189
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,583
Let us take our leader home!

190
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:56,750
The deceased are to be cremated

191
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,625
and buried here
on the grounds...

192
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:00,916
The Black Order has
been perfectly clear.

193
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,958
There are no exceptions.

194
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:05,958
Contacting the families of
the deceased is forbidden...

195
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,916
Any information about
members of the Order,

196
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,291
living or dead,
is strictly classified.

197
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,041
What about their families?

198
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,583
They died trying to
make the world safe,

199
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,458
you can't just
forget about them!

200
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:16,916
Can you give me
your word that those

201
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,750
in your unit who died
won't be turned into Akuma?

202
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,333
Or that your Leader's son won't

203
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:24,791
do absolutely anything to bring
his dead father back to life?

204
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:26,791
Their last mission in protecting

205
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:29,625
the world is to
vanish altogether.

206
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,083
There's too much at stake.

207
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:46,541
I can't afford to
be sentimental...

208
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:49,208
I have to stay
focused on victory.

209
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,458
Hello you two...

210
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,333
General Tiedoll!

211
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,500
Yes, it's me...

212
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,833
Come on, it'll be morning soon.

213
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,625
There's no doubt
this city has seen

214
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:28,041
some devastating things
over these last few days.

215
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:29,541
Yes...

216
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:32,166
I only wish that Allen and
I could have gotten here sooner.

217
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,541
We came as fast as we could,

218
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,083
but by the time
we reached the city,

219
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,708
the battle was already over.

220
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:37,708
It was hopeless...

221
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:38,875
We might as well
have stayed home

222
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,666
for all the good it did...

223
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,208
God knows how many
people we could have saved,

224
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:44,875
if we had just
gotten here earlier.

225
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:47,708
General...

226
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:48,958
The Order needs your help...

227
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:50,541
Will you be going back?

228
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,333
As long as I'm able
to serve the Order,

229
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,583
I'll continue in my own way...

230
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:55,750
Right now that means

231
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,916
finding more Accommodators
of Innocence...

232
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,750
Each of you has
responsibilities of your own,

233
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:01,916
but you know that...

234
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:08,291
The battle may be over,
but the war isn't...

235
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,583
There've been four
Generals attacked so far...

236
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:13,250
So it's a safe bet who
their next target will be.

237
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,708
It's so obvious!

238
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:15,833
My Master?

239
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:17,875
That's right...

240
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:23,916
And I hope for his sake that
you find him before they do.

241
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,083
Right.

242
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,000
But I don't imagine
he'll be too pleased

243
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:30,583
about the idea of suddenly
having two Exorcist bodyguards.

244
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:32,875
Yeah... Good point.

245
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,791
But General Cross doesn't
have to worry about it,

246
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,625
because we don't have
any clue where he is.

247
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,500
That shouldn't be too hard...

248
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,666
I thought everyone
knew about this.

249
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,541
Within Timcanpy--and every
Golem--is a feature that

250
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:47,333
allows it to sense the
person that created it.

251
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:49,583
Okay...

252
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:52,041
Tell us where we
can find General Cross.

253
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,250
He stopped moving.

254
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,708
It looks like he's facing east.

255
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,958
Nothing's gained by
dwelling on lost battles...

256
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:14,958
The war against the Millennium
Earl is just beginning.

257
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:15,833
Yes, sir.

258
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:18,166
Right.

259
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,208
Be careful General Tiedoll...

260
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,208
Goodbye...

261
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,500
We'll see you again someday!

262
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,916
I thought they'd never leave.

263
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
That boy is nothing but trouble.

264
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:36,166
That's true...

265
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,625
But from this point on--

266
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,375
The path set out before
them is fraught

267
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:43,833
with dangers the likes of
which they've never imagined.

268
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:47,125
There's not a doubt in my mind.

269
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:51,333
Speaking of new journeys,
it's time we started ours.

270
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,125
Right.

271
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,500
Anything you say, Master.

272
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:43,458
As far as the eye can see, red
roses dominate the landscape.

273
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:45,375
After the losses we've suffered,

274
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:48,208
they do wonders to
soothe our aching hearts.

275
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:52,500
On the next episode of
D. Gray-man: "Requiem Roses."

276
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:56,291
Bring forth salvation to
this tormented Akuma's soul!
