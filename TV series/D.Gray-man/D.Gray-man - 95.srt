[LINK]
Let's begin, General Cross.

34
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:15,666
Approximately four years ago,

35
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,125
you were directed to carry
out a crucial assignment.

36
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,375
You were ordered to
destroy the Akuma factory.

37
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,291
Although shortly after
you received these orders,

38
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:23,916
you went missing.

39
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,166
During your absence,

40
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,041
you failed to communicate
with headquarters,

41
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:29,458
not even reporting in once.

42
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,583
Your actions throughout
these past four years

43
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:32,750
remain a mystery.

44
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,083
And I'm including
your involvement

45
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,333
in this most recent crisis.

46
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:38,375
During the battle in Edo, Japan,

47
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:41,125
the Cross Unit and the Tiedoll
Unit engaged in combat

48
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,041
with the Millennium
Earl and his minions,

49
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:46,708
allowing you the opportunity to
successfully infiltrate the Ark.

50
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:47,958
Following the battle,

51
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:50,541
a group of five Exorcists,
including Lenalee,

52
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,708
who the enemy believes
to most likely possess

53
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:53,958
the Heart Innocence,

54
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,708
along with a young man
who was later confirmed

55
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:58,541
to be an Accommodator,
were all abducted by the Earl

56
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:00,750
and abandoned inside
the collapsing Ark,

57
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:04,291
where they clashed with the
Noah Clan in order to escape.

58
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:07,083
Multiple Exorcists, including
the nigh invulnerable

59
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,208
Yu Kanda and Arystar Krory,

60
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,541
were seriously injured
during this confrontation

61
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:14,291
and are currently being
treated within HQ.

62
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:17,791
While these Exorcists were
desperately locked in combat,

63
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,541
General Cross combed
through the Ark

64
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,291
in search of the Akuma factory,

65
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:24,125
and managed to
successfully locate it.

66
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:25,875
After he made this discovery,

67
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,833
the General came to
the Exorcists' aid

68
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:30,041
to help fend off the Noah.

69
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,500
All accounts state the General

70
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,291
then ordered one
of the Exorcists,

71
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,041
his protégé Allen Walker,
to be specific,

72
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,666
to operate the
controls of the Ark

73
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,916
in order to evade its collapse.

74
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,041
Not only did this seizure
prevent the Earl

75
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:44,625
from downloading the Ark

76
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:47,333
and thus obstructing his access
to it, it also allowed the Order

77
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:51,083
to commandeer the
Akuma factory within.

78
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,708
Subsequently, the General
utilized the Ark again

79
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,625
without authorization from the
Order to return to Headquarters

80
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,750
for the first time
in four years.

81
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,875
That is all.

82
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:02,083
Thank you.

83
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,791
So a full four years have passed

84
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:06,458
since the last time you
sat in one of these chairs.

your work, General.

You accomplished
quite a great deal.

87
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:14,375
Regardless, you caused us
considerable apprehension.

You seemingly disappeared
off the face of the planet.

89

For all we knew, you were dead
or had become compromised.

90
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:24,375
I'm not in the habit of doubting
our own people, but...

91
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:27,541
What can I say?

92
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:28,875
It was a dangerous assignment

93
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:31,666
and I was operating under
the enemy's very nose.

94
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,583
The Earl's got his
goons hidden everywhere

95
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,833
so I had to take an unusual
amount of precaution.

All there is to it.

97
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:38,666
Things got even more dicey

98
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,666
when the Earl started
targeting Generals

99
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,458
while hunting for the Heart.

100
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,500
I had a couple of close
calls here and there,

101
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:46,083
but I still managed
to pull it off

102
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:49,125
because I was operating
under everybody's radar.

this verdict was handed down
directly from the Great Generals

and the brass at Central.

136
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,125
These past hundred years,
the Order has been deadlocked

137
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:11,750
in a hopeless war
against the Earl

138
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,750
and his endless army of Akuma.

139
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:14,833
But the battle in Edo

140
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:17,708
has drastically
altered our position.

141
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,750
First, we prevented
the enemy from seizing

142
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,250
the Heart Innocence from us.

143
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:24,458
As a result, we were able
to successfully protect

144
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:25,916
the Generals
targeted by the Earl

145

with a minimum number of losses.

146
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,500
Although there were
many casualties,

147
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:31,750
we were fortunate enough

148
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:34,416
to maintain the fighting
power of our Exorcists.

149
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,291
Despite the heavy loss we
suffered during the battle,

150
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,916
we alternately inflicted
considerable damage

151
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,625
to our enemy.

152
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:44,166
Most significantly, our seizure
of the Akuma factory

153
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,541
has temporarily cut off the
Earl's supply of Akuma.

154
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,625
This is a true
strategic gain for us

155
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:52,208
as it will force the Earl to
postpone the second coming

156
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:56,166
of the "three days of darkness,"
his plan for the apocalypse.

157
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,583
I'm certain the Earl will
find a way to recover,

158
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,458
but we've at least bought
ourselves more time

159
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,666
to prepare for
the final battle.

160
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,333
And of course, we must consider
the Ark's teleportation ability.

00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:09,583
Harnessing this capability
will no doubt serve

162
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:12,666
as a powerful strategic
asset in large-scale action

163
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,000
conducted against the
Noah and the Akuma.

164
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:17,291
Wait, you want our
people to use the Ark?

165
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:18,500
That's correct.

166
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,333
I'd like you to call
the Science Section

167
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:23,833
to begin immediate
preparations, Chief Komui.

168
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,250
Typical.

169
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,333
We're gonna be the ones
stuck riding the damn thing

170
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:33,291
and he doesn't even
bother to ask our thoughts.

171
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,541
So it'll be a means
of transportation

172
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:37,750
for the Exorcists?

173
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,666
I can see the strategic
military advantages

174
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,208
it would give us, but still.

175
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:42,791
Now wait a second!

176
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:46,708
I don't recall giving you
permission to speak, Chief Bak.

177
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:51,708
You may voice your
concerns, Chief.

178
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,416
Uh, yes. It's just--

179
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,375
The enemy forces have
been using that Ark

180
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,541
for the past 7,000 years.

181
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,291
It's completely foreign to us.

182
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:03,166
I think it would behoove us
to carefully study it first.

183
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,958
You say that as though
you haven't already

184
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:06,333
boarded the Ark yourself.

185
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:07,750
Shut up, pretty boy!

186
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,833
[ROUVELIER] Such research
would be a waste of time.

187
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:11,750
And that is the official
unified decision

188
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:15,250
of every single Great General
serving at the Central Agency.

189
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,791
B-But without further study,
we could very likely

190
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,625
endanger the lives
of the Exorcists

191
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,375
by exposing them to
prolonged usage.

192
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:22,833
To be perfectly
frank, Chief Bak,

193
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:25,416
that is the least
of our concerns.

194
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,083
This organization doesn't exist
to coddle our Exorcists.

195
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:31,208
We exist for the sole
purpose of winning the war

196
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,041
against the Earl.

197
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:37,250
[BAK]
You heartless bastard.

198
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,500
Now take your seat,
Branch Chief Bak.

199
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,333
Komui.

200
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,208
I said sit.

201
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:51,333
[BAK] I knew it. I don't
know why I'm so surprised.

202
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,250
[KOMUI] The Black Order
is the militant arm

203
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:57,333
of a mighty religion, serving
the will of the Holy Father.

204
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,791
Winning this crusade is the
only thing that matters

205
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:02,166
to Rouvelier and his ilk.

206
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,416
Their defense of the faith

207
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,250
and loyalty to the
Order is fanatical.

208
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,125
We have no choice
but to obey the Order.

209
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:14,208
The slightest doubt, and
we'll be slain as heretics.

210
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:18,041
They consider Exorcists a
strategic means to an end.

211
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:21,125
Nothing more than
sacrificial lambs.

212
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,375
[KOMUI]
And that's why I'm here.

213
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:29,166
I'll do everything in my power
to protect the Exorcists.

214
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:34,125
No matter what, I won't let the
Order throw away their lives.

215
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:38,041
Moving on. Let's discuss
the next item of business.

216
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,125
Wait, there's more?

217
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:41,000
Of course there is.

218
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,958
[KOMUI]
Yet they didn't tell us.

219
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:44,291
I'm sorry, Director,

220
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,625
but you specifically told
me before the meeting

221
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,375
that the only item
on the agenda today

222
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,375
was to question General Cross.

223
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,208
Oh, did I tell you that?

224
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:55,208
This next issue, well, Chief
Bak's apprehensions from earlier

225
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,125
must have reminded me of it.

226
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,916
What?

227
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,833
So, General Cross.

228
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,708
This might be a
sensitive subject for you

229
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:05,833
as it regards your apprentice,
Allen Walker.

230
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,000
Wait, Walker?

231
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,916
What does Allen have
to do with this?

232
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,833
More than you've
cared to investigate.

233
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:14,375
In fact, we suspect Walker is
possibly working for the enemy.

234
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:16,250
Given the evidence
that led us to this,

235
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:17,750
it is of the utmost importance

236
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:20,333
we ascertain where
his loyalty lies.

237
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,166
Wait. Director, please!

238
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:25,458
The Central Agency does not
take this suspicion lightly.

239
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:27,541
And therefore we demand
that Allen Walker

240
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:30,166
face the inquisition.

241
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,666
An inquisition?

242
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,375
No way.

243
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,708
[BAK]
He can't actually be serious.

244
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:49,333
An inquisition is barbaric.
No one does it anymore!

245
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:51,625
It's not even a proper tribunal.

246
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:54,833
It amounts to little more
than trial by torture.

247
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:57,166
On top of that,
it's a closed door trial

248
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,291
orchestrated by a
judge, prosecutor,

249
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,916
and defender of the
Order's choosing.

250
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,458
Facing an inquisition, it's a
predetermined death sentence.

251
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:07,916
May I speak, sir?

252
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,208
North American
Branch Chief Reni.

253
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:11,666
Walker is one of us.

254
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,166
An apostle who has admirably
served the Order.

255
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,708
What reasoning do you have
to demand an inquisition?

256
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:21,250
The same reasoning behind the
wariness Chief Bak expressed.

257
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,500
If we encounter something
potentially hazardous

258
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,583
to the Order, then it
deserves thorough scrutiny.

259
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:30,041
The Ark is the least
of our concerns.

260
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,416
The potential threat I speak of

261
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,958
is none other than your
apprentice, Allen Walker.

262
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:35,958
[BAK]
Huh?

263
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:37,375
[ROUVELIER]
As Chief Bak said,

264
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,416
the Ark is a creation
of the Earl's.

265
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,791
It's been in his sole possession

266
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,541
for the past several
thousand years,

267
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:46,000
the mechanics of it remain a
complete mystery to the Order.

268
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:49,166
So one is left to wonder,
how exactly did Allen Walker

269
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,458
possess the knowledge to
proficiently operate it?

270
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,208
Tell me, General Cross,

271
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,125
I'd love to hear
your explanation.

272
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,416
[CROSS snoring]

273
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,458
He's asleep.

274
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,916
[ROUVELIER]
General Cross!

275
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,583
The Earl had us backed
into a desperate corner.

276
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:05,208
People can do some
amazing things

277
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:06,708
when their life's at stake.

278
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,458
Oh. Now I see.

279
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:11,875
You must think I'm
a blithering idiot.

280
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:13,041
Answer me this.

281
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:14,958
You took Allen Walker
as your apprentice

282
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:16,541
right after you
received the orders

283
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:19,708
to destroy the Akuma
factory, did you not?

284
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,583
After you completed
Allen Walker's training

285
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:24,458
as an Exorcist, you left
him with instructions

286
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:27,916
to join the Order while you,
in turn, went missing.

287
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,666
And now this same Allen Walker

288
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,500
has fulfilled the
role of the Player.

289
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:32,875
If I'm not getting
through to you,

290
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,333
allow me to be more direct.

291
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,291
Were you aware of
who Allen Walker was

292
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,250
when you sent him
to join the Order?

293
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:42,375
Were you acting under
the Fourteenth's will?

294
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,000
Be honest with me, General.

295
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:48,041
Allen Walker is the Fourteenth's
designated Player, isn't he?

296
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:50,958
Who is the Fourteenth?

297
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,458
You ever heard of him before?

298
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:53,833
No.

299
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,458
[ROUVELIER]
Really, General,

300
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:04,416
did you believe we assigned
you to destroy the plant

301
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,208
without knowing anything at all?

302
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:10,375
[CROSS] They knew the
plant was inside the Ark.

303
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:12,541
So you sent me there
on purpose, huh?

304
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,750
Considering that I have
yet to hear a denial,

305
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,416
I'm assuming that
you're freely admitting

306
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,708
your association
with the Fourteenth?

307
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:21,125
Now why don't you go ahead
and answer my question?

308
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:22,583
Last thing I ever expected

309
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,916
was to hear those
words come from you.

310
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,333
How do you even know
about the Fourteenth?

311
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,958
I'm the one who's asking
the questions here.

312
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:32,500
And the one question
I want answered

313
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:35,708
is whether or not Allen Walker
is working for the enemy.

314
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:38,125
Whose side is he on?

315
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:39,375
Now hold on.

316
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,541
Keep quiet.

317
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:43,083
I'm Andrew Nansen,
Branch Chief of Oceania.

318
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:45,416
Director, I'm sorry,
but just what in the world

319
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,083
are you even talking about?

320
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:48,625
None of this makes sense.

321
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:51,416
Allen Walker is an apostle
of the Order, right?

322
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,333
He's a tried and true Exorcist.

323
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:54,500
My thoughts exactly!

324
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:56,708
Same here! Are you
doubting one of our own?

325
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,750
[ROUVELIER]
Anyone is capable of duplicitous

326
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,500
and heretical machinations,

327
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,916
regardless of their
ranking as an Exorcist.

328
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,833
We are God's army, and it is
our duty to remain virtuous

329
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:10,250
and expunge all
evil we encounter.

330
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:14,416
Have all of you forgotten what
transpired with Suman Dark?

331
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,208
We have already
witnessed the horrors

332
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:18,416
of an Exorcist
submitting to evil,

333
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,583
and we cannot let something like
that happen again on our watch.

334
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:25,958
These disasters must be
prevented at all costs.

335
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,541
Y'know, come to think of it,

336
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:30,916
there was an Exorcist present
when Suman fell from grace.

337
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,625
Remind me, Chief Komui.
Who was that again?

338
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:37,041
It, um, was Allen Walker.

339
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:41,041
Right. It was there on
the tip of my tongue.

340
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:45,833
That was, indeed, Allen Walker.

341
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,041
Oh, Allen.

342
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,291
What? Is there something
wrong, Lenalee?

343
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:54,541
Oh, I was just thinking,

344
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:56,916
I wonder if Allen's
wounds are healed.

345
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,750
I've got a feeling he's okay.

346
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,041
The head nurse told me

347
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:02,666
she's never seen an
appetite like his before.

348
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,041
Yeah. Sounds like him.

349
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,625
[REEVER] All right, c'mon,
let's move it, guys!

350
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:14,333
And do not drop them!
No matter what, okay?

351
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:15,666
So heavy.

352
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,708
ctually, I'm just... sleepy.

353
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:22,250
Wake up!

354
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,416
That's all I've got.

355
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,416
Feels like I haven't
slept in ages.

356
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,416
We haven't had time
to catch any sleep

357
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,916
since this stuff arrived.

358
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,541
Shut up! You're making
me sleepy, too!

359
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:37,583
Heh. I even hear a lullaby.

360
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:38,916
[REEVER, TUP]
Huh?

361
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,583
What lullaby?

362
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,000
[JOHNNY]
But I...

363
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:45,916
That's so strange. I heard
it coming from somewhere.

364
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:51,041
[LAVI] I promise you,
I heard Allen's voice, okay?

365
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:52,125
[KANDA]
Well, I don't.

366
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:53,500
[LAVI]
Look, I know what I heard.

367
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,041
It was the same song
we heard in the Ark

368
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:57,916
and it was coming from in there.

369
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,541
Hey, hold on a sec.

370
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:02,875
Why do you suddenly care enough
to help me look for Allen, Yu?

371
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:05,291
Don't ever call me Yu again.

372
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,166
[KANDA]
What's your problem?

373
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,333
You boys aren't done healing;
now back to the ward.

374

Let go of me, you crazy bat!

pertaining to either

You can't keep us in the dark.

yourself, please!

I have full oversight
of this assembly

with the authority granted to me

393

by the Great Generals
and the Central Agency.

Go on, Director.
Investigate all you want.

Excuse me, General?

396

Scrutinize to your
heart's content.

do whatever you
feel is appropriate.

What the hell are you saying,

Very well then,

I believe I'll take
you up on that.

For the time being,

you are not to step foot
out of Headquarters.

405

I'll assign you some attendants
from the Central Agency

to keep watch over you.

Is this...?

00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,041
Am I the one who
chose this path,

419
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:28,041
or did someone else
choose it for me?

420
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:31,333
Is that true? It can't be right.

[ALLEN] The moment she
lays her eyes on Rouvelier,

Lenalee starts uncontrollably
shaking in fear.

Unpleasant memories claw their
way to the surface of her mind.
