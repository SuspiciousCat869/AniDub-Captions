with a few drinks, right?

160
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,958
You're gonna be in trouble
if you try to make us

161
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:34,750
drink with you! We're minors!
So thanks but no thanks! Ha!

162
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:40,041
[PATRONS mutter]

163
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,958
[JASDERO]
Uh...

164
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,291
Is he here?

165
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,916
[PROPRIETRESS] There you
two are! It's about time!

166
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
[JASDEOR, DEVIT]
Uh... Huh?

167
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,791
[chuckles]
You're coming with me!

168
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,166
[JASDERO grunts]

169
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,416
[DEVIT grunts]

170
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,916
[PROPRIETRESS] Alright,
two able-bodied workers!

171
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:02,125
[PROPRIETRESS] Hm! Well then,
I'll leave you to it!

172
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,375
[JASDERO, DEVIT]
Sure.

173
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,875
[DEVIT]
Hey, wait! What are we doing?

174
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:12,083
Listen, lady. We'd rather
not have to hurt you.

175
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,708
Bring us Cross and
we'll let you live! Heh!

176
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:19,791
[PROPRIETRESS] Don't be silly,
or I'll make you regret it.

177
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:20,833
[JASDERO, DEVIT gasp]

178
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,875
Mr. Cross told me about you.

179
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,458
He said that to
pay off his debt,

180
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,458
a couple of creepy-looking
characters would be coming

181
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:28,875
to work at the pub for a while.

182
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:29,875
So, us?

183
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:30,875
[PROPRIETRESS]
Mm-hm.

184
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:32,041
Cross's debt?

185
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:32,833
[PROPRIETRESS]
Mm-hm.

186
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:33,833
We're paying it?

187
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:34,500
[PROPRIETRESS]
Mm-hm.

188
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,083
We're working? Here?

189
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:36,916
[DEVIT]
His debt?

190
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,625
[JASDERO]
Cross's debt?

191
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:38,291
[DEVIT]
Pay it off?

192
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:39,041
[JASDERO]
Working?

193
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:39,916
[DEVIT]
We're paying it?

194
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
[JASDERO]
Screw you!

195
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:43,000
[DEVIT]
We're not bussin' tables!

196
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,375
[JASDERO, DEVTI gasp]

197
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:47,000
You've got another thing
coming if you think

198
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:48,583
we're gonna let
you go that easy.

199
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:51,000
And once they run out of stuff
for you to do at Pig's Bit,

200
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:53,583
there's a pretty high bill that
needs to be paid at my pub.

201
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:56,750
Same goes for my place.
I'll be waiting.

202
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,625
No matter how long it takes,

203
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:01,916
you're gonna pay
off Cross's tabs.

204
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:08,000
[DEVIT, JASDER grunting]

[BOTH panting]

206
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,083
[DEVIT]
They worked us to the bone,

207
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,916
and we still couldn't pay off
all the money Cross owed,

208
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,666
so now we're responsible
for the rest!

209
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:34,333
[BAR OWNERS laugh]

210
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:35,791
[DEVIT]
Dammit, Cross!

211
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:37,916
Why can't you just pay your
bills like everybody else?

212
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,041
What a jackass!

213
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:43,125
Yeah, look at this
giant stack of charges!

214
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,000
It's a hundred guineas total!

215
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:48,375
And you are gonna pay back every
bit of it! You understand me?

216
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:53,583
[JASDERO, DEVIT sob]

217
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:57,125
Saddling them with debt.
That's quite clever.

218
00:10:57,208 --> 00:11:00,583
Hm. Actually, I think I
lent him money as well.

219
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,208
Yeah, good luck.

223
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:17,750
Allen! Is there something wrong?

224
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:19,875
Crazy. It looks like
he's getting crushed

225
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:22,208
under the weight of
just the word "debts"!

yourself together, would ya?

A hundred.

Come on, stop! Don't say that,
it freaks me out!

a hundred guineas.

[ALLEN]
What's the big deal?

244
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,541
That's such a small
amount of money!

246

What'd you say?

247

Compared to the
amount I owe, anyway.

[LAVI gasps]
I'd ask you how much that is,

but I'm kind of afraid to know!

250

[ALLEN] I had it a whole
lot worse than you guys!

[ALLEN] Master! I'm back.
Sorry for making you wait.

00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:51,916
[ALLEN] What's this?
It's from Master.

253

He'll be waiting at Cow's Sigh.

thing that happened to us!

like you would say that.

worse waiting for me.

So Cross sent you in his place?

[JASDERO, DEVIT]
Uh...

262
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:19,541
On top of that, the amount
of debt was ridiculous.

263
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,875
[ALLEN]
Okay, I understand! I'll do it!

264
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:24,750
I can handle a little bit of
physical labor if I have to.

265
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:26,875
I'm used to it!

it'll be more than a little bit.

No!

My. That is terrible.

276
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:08,041
Yeah, but I'm sure that the
pay was probably decent

277
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,250
since it was hard
labor, wasn't it?

[KRORY, LAVI gasp]

279
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,583
[ALLEN] Well, all the exertion
made me super hungry every day,

280
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:17,375
so I spent a lot
of money on food.

281
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,000
[ALLEN sighs]

282
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:21,625
Yes, I can see how that would
make things difficult.

283
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:22,833
That's awful.

284
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:23,916
[KRORY, LAVI gasp]

285
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,708
[ALLEN chuckles]
Just a hundred guineas.

[chuckling continues]

287
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,875
[ALLEN] That amount of money
is nothing but pocket change

288
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,541
compared to what I went through.

289
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,041
[DEVIT]
Just pocket change, huh?

290
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,333
[JASDERO] If you say
that one more time,

291
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,666
we're gonna kill you dead!
Deader than dead!

292
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,125
Anyway. I know you guys
might think my master

293
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,041
is a demon, but that's
not true at all.

294
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,375
Aw, that's nice!

295
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:46,125
Allen's got such
a good heart!

296
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,458
He still defends his master,
no matter what kind of

297
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:51,000
challenges he had
to put up with!

298
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:53,458
You've got it all wrong.

299
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:59,208
[ALLEN]
The truth is.

300
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:02,125
Master's not a demon, he's more
like the devil himself!

301
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:03,625
Before you make any
deals with him,

302
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:06,000
you should at least know
what you're getting into!

Jeez! Put a sock in it!

Nobody cares about
your stupid problem!

Yeah, so why don't you zip your
lip and pay our debt. Now!

308
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,208
Why would I do that
for you two losers?

309
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:31,708
I have to worry about mine
before I can do anything else!

[JASDERO, DEVIT grunt]

311
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,958
Forget the sob-story
and pay the bill!
