1
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:54,166
The storm is getting worse.

2
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,125
It'll be alright.

3
00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:59,958
Do you think it's
safe to go out?

4
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:04,750
You know you're free to
stay behind until I get back.

5
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,625
Father, I'm going
to come with you...

6
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:10,875
If I stayed here
I'd only worry...

7
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:14,833
I just wish we knew where
to look for it... that's all.

8
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,833
This would be a helluva
lot more enjoyable for me

9
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:25,208
if all this yucky snow was

10
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:28,000
turned into sweet,
sweet ice cream.

11
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,875
Once we safely
collect the Innocence,

12
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:35,041
I'm sure the Earl will be happy
to make some for you, lero.

13
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:36,125
I thought the only thing

14
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:39,375
Lord Millennium could
make was Akuma.

15
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:45,750
I'd like cream stew,
pot stickers,

16
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,541
omelet with mushrooms,
green pepper steak,

17
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,208
fried rice, and a Caesar salad.

18
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:49,875
Mmm?

19
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,041
And ten cream puffs

20
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:52,375
and red bean paste
pancakes for dessert.

21
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,583
O-kay... and these
are large portions?

22
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:55,416
Uh-huh!

23
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,458
It's so fun to cook for you.

24
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:05,000
That was fantastic!

25
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:07,291
Whoa... you have
quite the appetite, huh?

26
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,541
Parasite Type
Exorcists need fuel

27
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,750
because they tend to
expend a lot of energy.

28
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,583
Yeah, they sure do.

29
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:14,833
Allen...

30
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:15,875
Yes?

31
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:16,833
New mission.

32
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:17,708
Huh?

33
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,750
Report to Chief Komui.

34
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:24,791
Sorry I'm late...

35
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,541
How do you like cold
weather...? How bout heat?

36
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,083
I'd say I'm fine with either.

37
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,416
Really...?!

38
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,875
Then you'll be perfect
for this next assignment.

39
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:41,291
We've learned of a village

40
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:43,083
experiencing abnormal
weather conditions...

41
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:44,291
It's snowing one minute,

42
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:47,041
while the next brings
blazing hot winds...

43
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:47,791
That's strange...

44
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,083
What's the cause?

45
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:50,958
We believe Innocence
is the most likely source

46
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:53,000
for such a phenomenon.

47
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,625
You and Kanda
are to retrieve it...

48
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:56,375
As a team of course.

49
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,125
Yes sir, understood.

50
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,750
Looking forward to it.

51
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:13,291
Didn't you know...?

52
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,291
We're taggin' along.

53
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,125
How annoying.

54
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:21,666
Oh now, don't say that.

55
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,541
We can all work together, Yu.

56
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,208
Do not call me that!

57
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:27,458
You know, since
I'm an Exorcist too,

58
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:28,875
I'll be able to help pitch in

59
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:31,333
and fight when we run into
Akuma... Isn't that right?

60
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm sure we'll be glad
to have your help.

61
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:39,875
Lavi...

62
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,208
This is the perfect
chance for us

63
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:42,750
to confirm with our own eyes

64
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:46,125
if this is Hevlaska's
Destroyer of Time.

65
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,583
Yeah.

66
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:56,791
And that's when I decided
to go to China, and let me--

67
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:59,250
Hey, are you listening?!

68
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:02,916
I can't get any rest...

69
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,416
I don't know which
is more exhausting,

70
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,416
working with Kanda or
listening to these stories.

71
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,333
So there I was,
really hitting it off

72
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:13,083
with this beautiful Chinese girl
in an amazing silk dress...

73
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,375
It was like a dream!

74
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:15,458
Well, you wouldn't
believe it but then another,

75
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:18,125
even more beautiful girl
came in and...

76
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:18,875
Hey...

77
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,666
Did you fall asleep...?!

78
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,708
How rude.

79
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,416
This is gonna look so good...

80
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:33,083
Oh, you awake...?

81
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,708
That Allen fell asleep, too...

82
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:36,666
Ha... Yeah and something
seems to have happened

83
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,750
to his face so maybe you
should take a look see.

84
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,625
Heeeyyyy, you don't have
to get so worked up, Yu!

85
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,000
Thank you for coming...

86
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:55,708
I'm your Finder.

87
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:57,083
The name's Michael.

88
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,541
You have to be
careful, Timcampy.

89
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:02,958
This is really nasty.

90
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:05,250
Should we wait it out here
until the storm dies down?

91
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:07,916
Well, we can't predict that
it actually will die down.

92
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,416
Are you going to search?

93
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,125
Of course I'm going to search--

94
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:12,416
that's why we were sent here...

95
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,333
I'm not going to waste
time sitting around.

96
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,250
But...

97
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:18,625
Don't worry about it--in fact,

98
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:20,708
why don't you just wait
around and build a snowman,

99
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:23,375
Short Stack?

100
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:24,833
Hold on!

101
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:40,833
This is going to be
one of those stories

102
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:42,875
where we all freeze to death
and they don't find our bodies

103
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:45,916
until the snow
melts in the spring!

104
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,333
Like these two?

105
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,125
Sir, can you hear me?

106
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,125
Come on, wake up!

107
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:00,291
Are you able to move?

108
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:02,458
Is my father alright?

109
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,416
I think so... He seems fine.

110
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,250
We should carry them
to shelter immediately.

111
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:10,833
We... We've been
staying at a nearby inn.

112
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:12,750
Don't worry,
we'll take you there.

113
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,875
Then I'll keep going.

114
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,625
I'm quite sure they
don't need all five of us

115
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:20,125
to rescue them from some snow.

116
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:21,083
Hey, wait--

117
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:22,250
It's fine...

118
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,750
Don't worry, we'll
start searching again

119
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:26,333
as soon as we can
get them to safety.

120
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:29,750
In the meantime,
I'll go with Kanda.

121
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,416
We'll catch up to you.

122
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm so sorry...

123
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:41,541
You're very kind.

124
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,833
You should
go ahead and rest now.

125
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:49,125
Ah, this gentleman seems to
have avoided any frostbite.

126
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:54,083
I asked the landlord's wife to
make something warm for you.

127
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,250
You didn't have to...

128
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:59,791
Father, see how good it looks?

129
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:01,333
Well... We'll be
right downstairs

130
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:04,541
so if you decide you need
anything else just call on us.

131
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,250
What do you think
a father and daughter

132
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:12,041
would be doing out in
a snowstorm like that?

133
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,041
Hmm.

134
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:16,250
I know why they're out there.

135
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,333
They went looking
for the "Leaf of Revival"

136
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,000
just like everybody
else is doing...

137
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:20,958
It's a legend here.

138
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:21,875
Wait... "Teeth"? 

139
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:24,041
No, not "teeth," leaf!

140
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,875
The "Leaf of Revival"
is a peculiar

141
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:29,916
and mysterious item that
appears in Norse mythology.

142
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,708
Legend has it that
the hero Sigmund

143
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,750
originally discovered it...

144
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,708
The leaf can supposedly
return the lives

145
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:38,291
of those who passed
away before their time...

146
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:39,791
It is said that families
around the world

147
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,625
have been looking
for the Leaf of Revival

148
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:44,291
for hundreds of
years without success.

149
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,583
Even today many
still search for it...

150
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,833
It's hard to believe
but some poor people

151
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:51,375
are still looking for that
thing to this very day,

152
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:53,000
and for some bothersome reason,

153
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,250
every time they
come around here,

154
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:57,000
the weather turns on its head.

155
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,125
It's cleared up!

156
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,375
Yeah...

157
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,916
Is it just me or does
this wind feel warm?

158
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:10,916
Do you know where Bookman is?

159
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,875
He said he was tired
so he went to lie down.

160
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:15,125
I think that this extreme
weather is getting to him...

161
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:17,666
I forget that old
panda's age sometimes.

162
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,833
Well, we might as well go.

163
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:21,958
The wind seems to be
coming from that direction,

164
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,458
so if we travel
towards its source

165
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:26,083
maybe we'll stumble
upon the Innocence...

166
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,000
C'mon let's hurry...

167
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:30,166
Well aren't you a smart one...

168
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,791
Hello, how are
you this morning...?

169
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:37,166
I'm sorry again for all the
trouble we caused you yesterday.

170
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:40,750
Are you sure it's a good idea
for you to come outside so soon?

171
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,291
We'll manage.

172
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,166
I won't let you and your friends
find the Leaf before we do.

173
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,083
Oh... Um, we aren't
really looking for--

174
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:48,250
Go get ready... right now.

175
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:55,750
Whoa, where can we get those?!

176
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,875
It's almost hot
out today, father.

177
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:08,291
I know.

178
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:28,791
You still in one piece?

179
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:30,625
Yeah, I'm okay

180
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,708
You didn't hurt
yourself, did you?

181
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,500
No, I'm fine.

182
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,000
Well that's good...

183
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,458
Listen...

184
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:39,958
Yes?

185
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,583
We were told that
even the locals

186
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,500
won't set foot
beyond this point...

187
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:47,666
It could be very dangerous
to wander around here.

188
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:52,916
Maybe you two should
head back to the inn.

189
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:56,541
So you and your group can
have it all to yourselves...?

190
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:58,916
Let's go, Elda.

191
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:03,333
We're not looking for the "Leaf
of Revival," sir, I promise...

192
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:04,500
I can't tell you what it is,

193
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,375
but we're searching
for something else.

194
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:09,333
The truth is that Lavi
and I are Exorcists,

195
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:12,583
clergymen sent with the
power to destroy Akuma.

196
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:14,000
You're Exorcists?

197
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:15,500
Oh, Akuma...?

198
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,541
Hmmph! Those creatures
don't even exist.

199
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,500
Excuse me, but if the
Leaf of Revival exists,

200
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:21,125
why can't Akuma?

201
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,125
Please sir, you
should go back...

202
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,250
Trying to resurrect a
person you've lost

203
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,916
will only lead to regret

204
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,833
and there's also an evil
presence in the world

205
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:32,916
who will take advantage
of those desires.

206
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,541
And what would you
know of it, boy?!

207
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,000
No, Father, please!

208
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,250
Lavi, we should get going.

209
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,791
Stay close, Elda,
we're following them.

210
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:50,875
I have a feeling they're
hiding something.

211
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:05,125
So, did Skin go off
to look for Innocence?

212
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:08,625
I don't know... but
I wouldn't worry about him.

213
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,000
Why'd he take Lero with him?

214
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:12,958
I wanna play with Lero...

215
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:14,791
You're awfully whiny
this evening,

216
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,708
is something the matter?

217
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,750
Put that book down and
let's do something fun!!

218
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,583
There's nothing to do
without Lero around!

219
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:22,416
I'm so bored I'm gonna die!

220
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,625
Tyki, play with us
now so we don't die.

221
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,041
What?

222
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:29,458
He really really wants you
to play with him, see...?

223
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:34,416
He says "Play, Play
with me Tyki"!

224
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,041
It's alright, lero...

225
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:39,625
I'll just mind my own
business and read, lero.

226
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:40,875
May I stop...?

227
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,125
This isn't very fun.

228
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:44,041
Noooo!

229
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:46,083
Now catch!

230
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:53,708
Found it yet?

231
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,000
No.

232
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,333
Don't screw around!

233
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,333
But Skin, we're trying...

234
00:12:58,416 --> 00:12:59,916
Are you arguing with me?!

235
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:02,208
No... I'm sorry!

236
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:03,083
I don't want your
damn apologies,

237
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:04,250
I want you to find it!

238
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:06,708
Of course, and we will!

239
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:08,500
We'll do our best, Skin!

240
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:12,166
Yeah, let's... let's go.

241
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:17,208
What? Do you have something
you want to say to me umbrella?

242
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:20,041
No, I don't, lero.

243
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:30,500
How did the hot
wind turn into this?!

244
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:31,875
Unbelievable.

245
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:34,458
I wonder where Kanda
is--you think he's alright?

246
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,125
You know at this point,

247
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:37,375
I'm really not as
worried about Kanda

248
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:40,125
as I am about that
Finder who went with him.

249
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:41,500
Look...

250
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:46,916
Maybe we should stop for now,

251
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,583
if we keep going
and they don't make it,

252
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,166
we'll just end up
having to carry them

253
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,666
to the inn on our
backs all over again.

254
00:13:59,083 --> 00:13:59,791
Here.

255
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:02,583
Oh... thank you very much.

256
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,458
You're really prepared!

257
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:07,416
Since my Father prefers to
do so many things on his own,

258
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,750
I decided I should learn about

259
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:11,125
helpful ways of
supporting him...

260
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:14,375
Here... have some, Father.

261
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:18,083
You shouldn't talk to them.

262
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:20,666
Excuse me, but you're
the ones following us.

263
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:30,000
Father, why don't you
try to get some sleep,

264
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,625
just until the storm
calms down... okay?

265
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,625
She really is well-prepared...!

266
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,250
Hey, you realize if we get lost

267
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,208
we're going to have to
cuddle or something.

268
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:01,166
Allen?

269
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,208
Please feel free
to go on ahead...

270
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:07,416
Don't worry about us,
we'll manage just fine,

271
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,416
and I'm so sorry for
all of the rude things

272
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,625
my father said to you.

273
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:13,375
It's okay.

274
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:14,708
Don't tell him,

275
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:18,000
but I don't believe, the
Leaf of Revival exists...

276
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:22,458
I'm just... hoping that this
will make him feel better.

277
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,000
He's been really hard on himself

278
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:27,958
ever since the day my brother
was taken away from us.

279
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:29,875
So it's your brother
that he hopes

280
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,875
to revive and bring back
to life with the leaf...

281
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:37,916
You see... our house
had caught fire...

282
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:39,958
The four of us...

283
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:43,166
We were all living there
together when it happened,

284
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:48,166
but my younger brother was born
with bad legs, and he couldn't--

285
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,875
Jacob, Jacob!

286
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:53,291
No...

287
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:54,541
Don't come in!

288
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:55,583
Jacob!

289
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:57,208
Don't...!

290
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,833
Father, get them
away from here...

291
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,625
Go!

292
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,541
No!

293
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,000
Since then...

294
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:12,291
...my Mother has been confined
to her bed and Father...

295
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:16,625
...has so many regrets
he can't even look at me.

296
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,666
I won't stop him again...

297
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:24,375
I give him the freedom
to do what he wants...

298
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:28,500
As much as I'm able I want to
spare Father more heartache.

299
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I read that the hero
Sigmund accidentally

300
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:35,958
caused his own
son's tragic death,

301
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:40,791
but then... he was able
to bring him back to life,

302
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:44,166
by placing the Leaf of
Revival on the boy's body.

303
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:48,250
Elda... come on.

304
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,000
Shhh!

305
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:04,250
My, my... Are they Exorcists?

306
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,083
What?

307
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:20,333
I'm afraid we're
completely lost.

308
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:23,375
Yeah... would you mind
if we joined up with you?

309
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:25,708
We're lucky we found you,

310
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,125
we just didn't know
what would happen

311
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:30,666
if we were stranded
out here by ourselves.

312
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,583
You forget how easy it is
to lose your way in the dark.

313
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:35,833
Ain't that the truth...

314
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:37,041
if you could just point
us in the direction

315
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:40,583
of the main road
we'd appreciate it.

316
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:46,958
You're all Akuma...
show yourselves!

317
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:49,625
Did I mention how glad
I am your eye is healed up...?

318
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:52,250
It really is convenient.

319
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,583
I suppose we have no choice.

320
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:04,250
What the hell is that?!

321
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:07,750
Just stay back!

322
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,416
Tell us where the Innocence is!

323
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,291
You think that we'd
tell you guys...?

324
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,041
Now that's hilarious.

325
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,833
What did you say?!

326
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:27,958
Hurry...

327
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,416
Go now!

328
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,458
You bastard!

329
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,416
Innocence Activate!

330
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:13,875
That was quite a show,

331
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:17,875
but I wonder where your
little friends are off to?

332
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,416
Stop it!

333
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,666
Allen, behind you!

334
00:19:58,416 --> 00:19:59,750
Big Hammer, Little Hammer...

335
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:02,208
Grow, Grow, Grow!

336
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:06,708
Lavi...!

337
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:09,375
Take Elda and Frey and
get them out of here!

338
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:23,625
Mugen...!

339
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:25,958
Bring forth calamity!

340
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:28,416
Netherworld Creature Ichigen!

341
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,541
Retreat!

342
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,916
Yeah... Yu is here!

343
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:46,291
Shut up.

344
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:00,916
Allen...?

345
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,625
Allen!

346
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,458
The snow covers everything,

347
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:43,541
and the Akuma's attacks
grow more intense.

348
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:45,041
And then,

349
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:49,166
the legendary tree with shining
leaves appears before us.

350
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,333
On the next episode
of D. Gray-man:

351
00:22:51,416 --> 00:22:53,083
"Beyond the Snowstorm."

352
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:56,500
Bring forth salvation to this
tormented Akuma's soul!
