00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:41,291
[ROAD] Take a step
and everyone dies.

2
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:44,458
Surely you remember what my
candles did to your left eye.

3
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:48,791
That was a sample of
the pain they can inflict.

4
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,166
You wouldn't
want your friends,

5
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,583
especially sweet,
adorable Lenalee,

6
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:55,625
to be turned into human
pincushions, would you?

7
00:01:55,708 --> 00:02:00,125
Then do as I say and stay
still until I break Lavi.

Lavi... Lavi...

10
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:14,125
[LAVI]
Shut up!

11
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:17,750
[ZOMBIES moan]

12
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:18,958
[LAVI]
Don't look.

13
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:21,375
[REEVER]
Lavi.

14
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:22,583
[LAVI]
Don't look.

[ZOMBIES moan]

16
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,875
[LAVI] It'll only
make me more confused.

17
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:31,875
[ZOMBIES moan]
Lavi... Lavi...

18
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:33,416
Lavi, why?

19
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,750
Tell us why, Lavi.

20
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:38,916
[ZOMBIES moan]

[ZOMBIES yell]

22
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:42,875
[LAVI]
It's just an illusion.

00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,458
[ZOMBIES yell]

24
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,833
[KOMUI] What do you
think you're doing?

25
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:51,041
Damn!

26
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:52,583
[ZOMBIE groans]

27
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:58,833
[LENALEE]
You've abandoned us.

28
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:05,583
We're your comrades.
How could you do this to us?

29
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:08,166
[LAVI] Don't.
Don't listen to them!

30
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,166
They're not really there!

31
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:15,583

[ZOMBIES groan]

34
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,541
[LAVI] They're not real.
Don't let yourself forget that!

35
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:28,791
[LAVI] I have to get
out of here, now!

36
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,500
[BOOKMAN] I hereby accept
you as the successor

37
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:33,416
to the title of Bookman.

38
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,958
[LAVI gasps]

39
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,583
[BOOKMAN] The secret history
we witness and gather

40
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:43,166
is the complete collection
of all historical facts

41
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,208
that are omitted from
mankind's records.

42
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,791
[BOOKMAN] From now on,
it's your responsibility

43
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:53,208
to write them down.
Understand?

44
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:54,750
[SMALL LAVI]
Right.

45
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:01,041
[SMALL LAVI gasps]

46
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:05,916
[SMALL LAVI] This way
I can learn things

47
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,583
that no one else knows.

48
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,875
That's why I can't
wait to be a Bookman.

49
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,916
Stop it!

50
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,458
[LAVI] Someone's looking
into my memories!

51
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,958
[SMALL LAVI gasps]

52
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:40,708
[LAVI] Wherever we went, it was
just one war after another.

53
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:46,000
In my time as a Bookman, I've
witnessed a total of 48 wars.

54
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:52,041
It boggles my mind
how stupid people are.

55
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,958
Just killing each other
time and time again.

56
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:58,000
I get so sick of watching
them screw things up.

57
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:00,625
[BOOKMAN]
Mm.

58
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:04,875
But this time won't be
like the other wars.

59
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:07,041
We'll disguise
ourselves as soldiers

60
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:10,791
and observe from
their perspective.

61
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:14,583
You're inexperienced, so listen
carefully to what I tell you.

62
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:17,125
No matter what position
we find ourselves in,

63
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,666
it will always be a
Bookman's duty to--

64
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,416
To record history and
nothing more than that.

65
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,291
We're never to interfere
with other people.

66
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,333
You see?
I understand it.

67
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:31,791
All I can do is smile and
laugh and go with the flow.

68
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:34,250
[BOOKMAN sighs]

69
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:38,291
[BOOKMAN] Just try to stay out
of trouble, would you, Deek?

70
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:42,000
Hey, "Deek" was my
48th name, remember?

71
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:45,000
It's Lavi now,
so just call me that.

72
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,750
That's good to hear.

73
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:50,958
[REEVER] Thank you for waiting.
Our chief is ready to see you.

74
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,708
I welcome you to the
Black Order, gentlemen.

75
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:00,666
Science Section Chief
Komui Lee.

76
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,000
[BOOKMAN]
I don't have a name,

77
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,750
so I would prefer for you
to call me Bookman.

78
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,875
[LAVI] Coffins.
Is this a funeral?

79
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:09,041
[BOOKMAN] That young man there
is Lavi, my successor.

80
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:13,625
[LAVI] They must be
on the losing side.

81
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:16,208
[LAVI gasps]

82
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:19,125
[LENALEE weeps]

83
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:24,375
Stop, that's enough already!

84
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:25,541
[REEVER]
Lavi.

85
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,833
[JOHNNY]
Lavi.

86
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:29,375
No!

87
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:36,708
You wanna measure me? Can't you
just eyeball it or something?

88
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:39,541
Come on, don't be ridiculous!
A well-fitting coat

89
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:42,666
can do wonders for an
Exorcist's defense, you know!

90
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,250
On top of that,
it improves your mobility!

91
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:47,625
Johnny, give
the guy some space!

92
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,958
Hey! Section leader!
You think Lavi would look good

93
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:53,791
in a long coat like Kanda's,
or keep it short? Huh?

94
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:56,250
Wow, he is really
into this, huh?

95
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,541
You're one of us now,
so they wanna

96
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,625
make sure you're protected.

97
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:01,166
Let's measure.

98
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,458
[LAVI] I wonder if these
people are gonna be

99
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:08,708
left out of history one day?

100
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:18,583
[LAVI pants]

101
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,958
And so you stayed
at the Order.

102
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:24,833
What was it, two years you were
there? And during that time,

103
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:28,541
you became increasingly
close to the people you met.

104
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:34,625
[OTHER LAVI] Despite your
responsibility as a Bookman

105
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:39,375
to remain impartial, you began
to consider them your comrades.

106
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,750
[LAVI]
Shut up!

107
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,250
[OTHER LAVI]
You must be confused.

108
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,875
You can't even determine
whether that smile of yours

109
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:54,916
is real or fake anymore,
can you, Lavi?

110
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,458
[LAVI] I said stop!
Stop! Leave me alone!

111
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:05,583
[LAVI shudders]

112
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,000
[LAVI gasps]

113
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:14,291
[ALLEN]
Hey, I lost this.

114
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:19,125
So you held onto it
all this time,

115
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,791
and without
telling Bookman.

116
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:23,833
Allen.

117
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:25,958
[OTHER LAVI]

119
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:35,416
Allen!

120
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,000
[LAVI gasps]

121
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,708
Aw, what's all this about?

122
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:42,333
You look like your
heart's shattering.

123
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:45,000
[splash]

124
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:47,208
[LAVI shudders]

125
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:54,750
Oh, come on. A Bookman
doesn't need comrades.

126
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,833
That's what the
rules say, you know?

127
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:59,166
Ya can't go and let
yourself get attached.

128
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,833
It's only bound to cause
you pain in the end.

129
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,333
And if you do feel
that way about someone,

130
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,958
the best thing you
can do is destroy them.

131
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:09,583
You know that, don't you?

132
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,416
Oh, are there more?

133
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:21,375
And looky here. You better
get your knife ready.

134
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:26,583
Why are you hesitating?
Go on, cut them down already.

135
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,041
[ALLEN]
Lavi...

136
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:30,083
[LAVI shudders]

137
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:32,250
[ALLEN]
Lavi...

138
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:39,041
[LAVI pants]

139
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:47,291
[LAVI coughs, retches]

140
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:50,041
[OTHER LAVI chuckles]

141
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:54,041
You never had what it takes
to be a Bookman. Pathetic.

142
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,208
Why can't you
kill your comrades?

143
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:59,125
It really shouldn't be
that difficult for you.

144
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:06,208
[OTHER LAVI]
Don't worry.

145
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:10,833
The Bookman line will
live on, even if you die.

146
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:14,791
I'll take your place
as the next Bookman.

147
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:17,625
So you can disappear now.

148
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:28,833
[ROAD] Looks like I
just broke Lavi's mind.

149
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:31,416
[ROAD laughs]

150
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,791
Still, no matter what happens
in my world of dreams,

151
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:37,458
he can't actually be
hurt by illusions.

152
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:39,958
His friends only
stabbed him in his mind,

153
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:42,291
not out here in reality.

154
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:45,333
But the shock of being
done in by his own comrades

155
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:48,125
caused him to lose his sanity.

156
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:52,041
While his body is alive,
his mind is dead.

157
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:56,125
But there is something left
behind that I can use.

158
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:02,500
[ROAD]
Now. Come out.

159
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:07,458
[ROAD] It's time for
you to be set free.

160
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,458
[LENALEE gasps]

161
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:27,875
L... Lavi?

162
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:32,166
Sort of. If you want to save
Lenalee and that human,

163
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,833
you're going to
have to beat that.

164
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,583
[LENALEE gasps]

165
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,333
Lavi!

166
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,625
[ALLEN grunts]

167
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:55,166
[ALLEN yells]

168
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:05,291
No way. Why is he attacking
me all of a sudden?

169
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:10,833
[ALLEN yells]

170
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:14,291
[ALLEN screams]

171
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:19,750
[ALLEN] There's gotta be
something bad possessing him!

172
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:30,708
[ALLEN] If it's evil, my sword
should be able to exorcise it!

173
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,708
Come on, please work!

174
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:37,750
[ALLEN groans]

175
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,625
Don't bother with
the sword of exorcism,

176
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:43,375
'cause it's not evil
that's controlling him!

177
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:47,375
Attack with Edge on
your left arm instead!

178
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:53,708
Tear him into tiny pieces! It's
the only way you can stop him!

179
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:59,333
[LENALEE] You know he
can't do that, Road!

180
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:00,875
[ROAD chuckles]

181
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,833
[ROAD] You'd better hurry up
and use Edge, Allen.

182
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,750
Or I'll kill them right now!

183
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:11,791
You're not being fair!

184
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,333
[LENALEE] She knows
it's impossible for Allen

185
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:15,416
to do that voluntarily.

186
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,166
Switch out your weapon!

187
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:25,916
Unless you want to watch
Lenalee die, of course!

188
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,625
[ALLEN groans]

189
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,166
[ALLEN coughs]

190
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:42,666
[ALLEN] Lavi. You can
hear my voice, can't you?

191
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:48,333
You and I... We're
the only people left

192
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:51,333
who can protect Lenalee
and Chaozii now.

193
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:57,791
Krory said so, remember?
Kanda would say the same.

194
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:58,791
[ALLEN groans]

195
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:00,458
Stop it.

196
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:05,083
[ALLEN coughs]

197
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,791
For Lenalee...

198
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:11,125
...her comrades...
are more important

199
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:15,875
than anything else
in this entire world.

200
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:18,375
You're gonna make her cry!

201
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:25,666
Comrades, huh?
You think so? I don't.

202
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,208
[ALLEN grunts]

203
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:31,125
[ALLEN yells]

204
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,833
[ALLEN groans]

205
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:34,625
[LENALEE shudders]

206
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,416
[LENALEE]
Please stop!

207
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,708
[LERO]
Ah!

208
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:40,500
Haven't you gotten it
through your skull yet?

209
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:45,875
[ROAD] This is how
Lavi really feels!

210
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:51,041
I've never once thought of
any of you as my comrades.

211
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:55,583
I'm Lavi, the sole successor
to Bookman. Nothing else.

212
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,875
And I don't need you.

213
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:00,500
[ALLEN grunts]

214
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:02,625
[LAVI]
Devouring Flame.

215
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,541
[LAVI]
Fire Stamp!

216
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,750
[ALLEN]
Crown Clown!

217
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:21,125
It split in two!

218
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,083
[ALLEN] This sword's
ability is exorcism,

219
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:33,083
so it's useless against the
power of Lavi's Innocence.

220
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:36,791
My only option is to change
to Crown Clown's Edge.

221
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:38,333
[ALLEN gasps]

222
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:43,250
But I can't! If I use that,
it'll hurt Lavi too!

223
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:48,125
There has to be another way!
What do I do?

224
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,083
[LAVI]
Heaven Stamp.

225
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:03,250
[LENALEE] Lavi!
Please stop attacking him!

226
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,375
Snap out of it, now!

227
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:08,208
Nyeh. You're just
wasting your breath.

228
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:13,166
It's no use! Lavi's mind
has been destroyed.

229
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,666
All that's left
is a Bookman.

230
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:19,541
The way he's acting right now
is the way he really is.

231
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:22,833
He doesn't have any friends.
Not you or anyone else.

232
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:25,333
[LAVI]
Devouring Flame.

233
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,791
Lavi...

234
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:36,250
[ALLEN] I don't know
if Road's doing this,

235
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,333
so I'll just have to guess!

236
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:43,583
[LERO screams]

237
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,500
Mistress Road!

238
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:48,666
[ROAD laughs]

239
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:52,833
[ROAD] Aw, too bad! You
guessed wrong. I have to

240
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:56,625
give you credit for thinking
outside the box, though.

241
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,875
Your attacks are as
useless as they were

242
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:05,875
back in that rewinding town.
Did you forget about that?

243
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,083
[ROAD] Who cares
what this sword can do

244
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:11,458
if you're not really hitting me?

245
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:15,625
Here's the thing. I'm me,
but I'm not actually me.

246
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:17,583
Come on. If you don't
know anything about me,

247
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,500
then how are you
ever gonna beat me?

248
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:21,875
[ALLEN]
No...

249
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,583
[ROAD] Why don't you just
do what I tell you to do?

250
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,541
You're a decent Exorcist,
but even you

251
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,791
can't control how people feel.

252
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:31,333
Fire Stamp!

253
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,541
Now surrender!

254
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:36,166
[ALLEN screams]

255
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,458
Oh, Allen! Please, no!

256
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:46,000
Stop this, Lavi!
Call off the flames!

257
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:52,375
[ALLEN gasps]

258
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:55,666
[ALLEN] I'm surrounded by fire,
but it doesn't burn.

259
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:59,375
[LENALEE]
Lavi! I'm begging you!

260
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,750
[LENALEE] The heat's
causing them to melt.

261
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:11,500
[ALLEN] That's so weird...
Why am I not burning up?

262
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,833
[LENALEE gasps]

263
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:15,458
[ALLEN gasps]

264
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:17,000
[ALLEN]
Whoa.

265
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:23,208
Wait, huh? My body is...

266
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:26,500
...moving on its own!

267
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,416
Impossible!

268
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:35,625
[LAVI] Apparently it
is possible, jackass.

269
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,708
How dare you go out
of control like this?

270
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:39,958
Agh, it hurts.

271
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:43,375
Have you lost your mind?

272
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:47,083
Lost my mind?
Funny you should say that.

273
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:50,208
[LAVI groans]

274
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:51,750
[OTHER LAVI gasps]

275
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:54,750
[LAVI]
That was close.

276
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:58,625
If your mind is broken, you're
supposed to go insane, right?

277
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:05,125
[LAVI] In that moment,
when they attacked me,

278
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:08,625
I did what I had to do
to protect my sanity.

279
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,916
[LAVI]
Now that that's over.

280
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,083
I'm going to make sure you pay
dearly for playing with my mind.

281
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:19,750
What the...?

282
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:24,625
And I'm not holding back!
Fire Stamp!

283
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,833
Lavi!

284
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:31,416
[ALLEN]
No!

285
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,666
Lavi, wait!

286
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:38,000
[LERO screams]

287
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:41,083
She's been swallowed up
by the flames, lero!

288
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,291
[ROAD] He's insane.
Why would a Bookman

289
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,833
let himself be
burned to a crisp?

290
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:48,625
It may be noble,
but it won't actually--

291
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,166
[ROAD gasps]

292
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:53,833
[LAVI]
Too real for you?

293
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:57,375
Then how about an attack from
that dream world of yours?

294
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,166
I didn't give you
enough credit.

295
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,833
[ROAD] I'm impressed you
figured out my disguise.

296
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:11,208
Well, of course. You do seem to
have a thing for Allen, so...

297
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:12,625
[ROAD chuckles]

298
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:16,791
[ROAD] It's over. You'll never
become the next Bookman.

299
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:21,291
Heh. It looks like you've
backed me into a corner.

300
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:23,958
[LAVI] I didn't
want to do this,

301
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,708
but it's my best
course of action.

302
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:31,500
[LAVI]
I'm sorry.

303
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:34,958
This is goodbye.

304
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,208
[ALLEN] After aiming
Fire Stamp at himself,

305
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:17,083
Lavi is becoming
engulfed in hellfire.

306
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:19,250
Lenalee and I
call out his name,

307
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:23,291
but will our voices be
able to reach him?

308
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:27,125
On the next D. Gray-man,
"Voice of Darkness."

309
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:30,500
Bring forth salvation
to this poor Akuma's soul!

310
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,958
[ALLEN]
Huh?

311
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:35,250
[LAVI]
Huh? Oh--!

312
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:37,750
Uh, Lavi, are you
hiding something?

313
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:40,208
Uh... What? Of course not!

314
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:42,125
[ALLEN screams]

315
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:44,666
Hey, who said you could
