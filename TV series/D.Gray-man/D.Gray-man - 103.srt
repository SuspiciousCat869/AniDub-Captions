[LEVEL 4]
Let me go!

00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:43,083
There's no way!
You're finished!

00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:47,000
I said let me go,
you pathetic human scum!

Uh!

Cancel the evacuation!

Komui.

00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:24,541
As for this potbellied freak,
it's now my lab specimen.

11
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:27,041
[KOMUI]
General Cross? Is that you?

12
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,333
[CROSS] Don't tell me
you thought I was dead.

13
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:31,500
My master must
have used Carte Garde.

14
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:33,708
That's why the Level

[REEVER]
Chief...

00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:38,333
Are you there, Chief?
Do you copy?

17
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:40,958
It can't be. That's Reever!

18
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,458
[REEVER]
Still breathing.

19
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,708
Glad to hear
you're doin' the same.

[KOMUI]
Where are you?

21
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,791
[REEVER]
Buried under Lab 5.

22
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,708
There's debris
and flames everywhere.

23
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:52,416
I'm not sure of
our exact location.

24
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,916
We're being shielded
by Miranda's Time Out.

25
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,625
I can also see Tiedoll's Maker
of Eden in the distance.

26
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:01,375
Somehow we're all still alive,

27
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,375
but we need these fires put out!

28
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:05,291
Understood. We're on it!

29
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,208
We'll get you out of there!

30
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:08,708
I need you and
the other survivors

31
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,583
to huddle as close
to Miranda as possible

32
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,166
to shrink her Time Out!

33
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:16,333
The smaller the range, the less
strain it will be on Miranda.

34
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:17,458
General Cross.

35
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:19,000
Chief Komui?

36
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,750
I'm going back upstairs.

37
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:23,500
Can you assist Allen and
Lenalee with one final task?

38
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:24,916
Destroy the target.

39
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,500
[CROSS]
Like you had to ask.

40
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,958
Go on, Chief,
and leave it to me.

[LAVI]
I can't move, but sure.

43
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:38,583
I'm sorry! You guys fought
without any weapons!

44
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:42,375
Huh? What the hell are
you apologizing for, Komui?

45
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,708
Weapon or not,
fighting Akuma's my job.

46
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:47,125
You never drop
the macho act, do you?

[LENALEE]
Brother!

48
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,583
Are there survivors in the lab?

00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:55,000
Is it true, Komui?
They're alive?

50
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,458
Yeah!

You're more naïve than I thought

reasons I'm going to kill you?

More importantly,
after all that fire,

do I still have any hair left?

The name is Howard Link.

Thanks, Dink.

169
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,375
The medical team has
their hands full right now,

170
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,416

Why, Tup?

If I could just fall asleep
right at this moment,

At Central Agency
attending a council meeting.

Chief wants us in his office.

237
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,000
[KOMUI] It's the evolved form
of the Equipment Type.

238
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:55,458
In exchange for its
Accommodator's blood,

239
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,375
the Innocence takes on
a weaponized form,

Crystal Innocence.

that Lenalee is
the only one with this Type?

No, although I should add,

00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:16,166

we'll likely see it again.

That might be true.

While we managed to survive,
I think yesterday was a show.

252
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:34,291
A performance orchestrated by
the Earl to reveal his strength.

253
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:39,208
And to let us know,
he could destroy us at any time.

254
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:43,541
Whatever his message,
one thing's pretty clear.

255
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:47,333
We need to become stronger
and continue to fight.

Until the Akuma
are gone forever...

he could've destroyed
such a small organization

What I'm getting at is,
what if it's beneficial

264
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,916
for the Earl
to keep the Order alive?

Why I didn't just kill him?
