1
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,458
We're going down.

2
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:45,916
But, none of the attacks
pierced the hull.

3
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,916
The damn rudder.
It's refusing to budge.

4
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,041
[MIRANDA]
This isn't right.

5
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:56,291
The Time Record should still
be working on the ship

6
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:58,750
without any problems!

7
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:00,625
[gasps]

8
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:04,958
What are these things?

9
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,625
This must be the doing of
that Akuma from earlier!

10
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:10,000
That means our only
chance is defeating him!

11
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:11,000
And, we gotta do it quick,

12
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:13,500
otherwise this
voyage is history!

13
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:18,625
Lenalee...

00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,750
[KIE, MAOSA, CHAOZII grunt]

[MAOSA, KIE gasping]

16
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,541
Huh...?

17
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:38,875
[ALL gasp]
It's Lavi. Yes!

18
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:45,625
[KRORY]
They're not letting up at all.

19
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,666
[LENALEE]
Release!

20
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:58,500
What an entrance.

21
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:02,583
[inahles]

22
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:07,416
[LENALEE] For the sake of my
world. I can't fail now.

23
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:20,750
[AKUMA A laughs]

24
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:21,875
[AKUMA B]
Eat this!

25
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:24,833
[AKUMA C]
We're not through with you!

26
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,416

[CREW groaning]

29
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:09,416
Master. Let me keep you safe.

30
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:12,416
[MIRANDA groaning]

31
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,416
[CREW groaning]

32
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,416
[MIRANDA gasping]
No!

33
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:22,791
If the Exorcists are gonna give
this everything they've got,

34
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:24,416
then so are we!

35
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,958
But you...

36
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:27,541
We've been hit pretty bad,

37
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:31,166
so as soon as time goes back
to normal we're all gonna die.

38
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,750
Let us do what we can
while we're still alive.

39
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:34,666
No, don't!

40
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,083
No sailor worth his salt

41
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,333
would let you down
at a time like this!

42
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:42,625
[MIRANDA gasping]

43
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:48,791
[CREW screaming]

44
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,833
[gasps] The ship's taking
damage so quickly,

45
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:56,416
my Recovery
spell can't keep up!

46
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,583
[CREW groaning]

47
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,583
Why are you even doing this?

48
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,500
We won't let those creeps
hurt anyone else!

49
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:05,333
Yeah, and if protecting you
guys costs us our lives,

50
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:06,750
then so be it!

51
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,666
[CREW T screams]

52
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,916
They're dying!

53
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,541
[BOTH gasp]

54
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:12,833
I've got you!

55
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,166
[KRORY grunts]

56
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,375
[ANITA]
He saved our lives!

57
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:20,250
They won't get away with this!

58
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:26,166
[ESHI]
Huh? What are you doing?

59
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,541
[LENALEE] The effects from that
forced release are hitting me

60
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:32,416
even faster than I
expected them to.

61
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,041
I'm beginning to fall apart.

62
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:41,041
Don't abandon all hope yet.

63
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:45,250
It's so much more fun to kill
you when you struggle.

64
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,833
[LENALEE]
But you won't.

65
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,166
[ESHI]
Huh?

66
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:56,916
Because you are going
to break first.

67
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:01,083
Dammit!

68
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,416
[KRORY]
Ah!

69
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,250
[LAVI]
What the hell happened to you?

70
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:06,208
I'm just starting to feel
a little lightheaded

71
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,333
from running out of blood.

72
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:15,333
Come on! Can't you guys
ease up for a sec--

73
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:19,416
[LAVI screaming]

74
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,958
[KRORY grunts]

75
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,458
Lavi, no!

76
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:27,041
[gasps]

77
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,666
[LAVI grunts]

78
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:54,500
[coughs]

79
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,750
What the...? I didn't die?

80
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,583
Ah yes. That's much better.

81
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:00,958
Huh?!

82
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:06,333
That was lucky. It appears
as long as the poison

83
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:09,000
from those beams hasn't had time
to spread through your body,

84
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,791
I'm able to suck it out.

85
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:12,833
Besides, it was tasty.

86
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:16,750
I can't believe you bit me.
I feel weird now.

87
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,458
[BOOKMAN] What are you
two numbskulls doing

88
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:20,541
standing around on the deck?

89
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,541
Vanquish that enemy now!

90
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,666
What are you waiting for?

91
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,666
[growls] You dare
speak to me that way?

92
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,458
Lavi, you should've activated
Tree Stamp by now!

93
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:34,291
[gasps] Oh, right.
I forgot all about that.

94
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:37,250
Dammit, I really can be
an idiot sometimes.

95
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:38,333
[BOOKMAN]
I'll say!

96
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,875
Yeah, well no one
asked you, Panda!

97
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:43,291
Hey Krory, gimme your ear.

98
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:44,916
[BOOKMAN]
Oh, why must I be saddled

99
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,166
with a pair of bumbling
fools like them?

100
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,875
Is there no end to their folly?

101
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,125
[LAVI]
Ya got it?

102
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:54,750
Indeed. I understand.

103
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:57,958
My only concern is that
the footing is so unstable.

104
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:00,750
Either it works or we
fall to a watery death.

105
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:03,875
[grunts] I would never
die so clumsily.

106
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:06,250
[LAVI] Yeah, but we'll look
even more stupid if this ship

107
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,541
doesn't last till
Lenalee gets back.

108
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,791
Let's give it our best shot!

109
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:29,041
[LENALEE] Falling Kick
Technique. Iron Shackles!

110
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,250
[ESHI]
Pathetic.

111
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:38,916
You're still not strong enough
to pierce through my body.

112
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,958
Actually. Thanks to
you, now I am.

113
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,750
[LENALEE]
So...

114
00:08:57,791 --> 00:09:01,000
[LENALEE] ...this is going
to be my final attack.

115
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,750
[groaning]

116
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,416
Now what?

117
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,083
[BOOKMAN]
Huh?

118
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:18,083
[LAVI]
Whoa! The ship.

119
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:21,166
[KRORY]
It righted itself.

120
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,666
[LAVI]
But how?

121
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,250
This is perfect!

122
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:27,666
Hurry up, Lavi!
Strike them down, now!

123
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,916
Yes, sir!

124
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,583
[yells]

125
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,958
Go, Stamp! Tree Circle!

126
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:43,208
Heh.

127
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:55,291
Now, Tree Stamp! Spinning
Disc of Heaven and Earth!

128
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,875
[BOOKMAN] Tree Stamp isn't
an offensive move.

129
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:06,000
It's a special ability
of Lavi's Innocence.

130
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,208
It allows him to
helpfully manipulate

131
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,208
certain elements of nature.

132
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:14,250
Let's lose those clouds.
Watch this!

133
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,416
[KRORY]
There!

134
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:31,791
They're at four o'clock.

135
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:35,125
Roger that.

136
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:36,916
Have at it, buddy!

137
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,500
[AKUMA C]
Hey, what the hell?

138
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,541
Wh-Why did the clouds
disappear all of a sudden?

139
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:47,916
Oh, no.

140
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,416
Wait... I forgot,

141
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,333
the human eye can't see this
far up into the sky anyway.

142
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,125
Ah, they'll never spot me!

143
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:57,166
That's good.
What was I scared for?

144
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,916
Ah?

145
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,083
Ah... That's funny.

146
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:02,666
[AKUMA B]
Hey, quit slacking off!

147
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:06,208
Unless you want to let me kill
'em so I can evolve instead!

148
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,416
Up to you.

149
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,500
[AKUMA C]
You saw that just now, right?

150
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,875
[AKUMA B]
Saw what?

151
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:16,416
Hey. That Level Two over there
thinks he saw something weird.

152
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,416
[AKUMA A] Hm?! Yeah,
all right, what did you see?

153
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:24,166
[AKUMA C]
Huh?

154
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,250
[AKUMA A]
It... It's an Exorcist!

155
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,416
So, there are only
three of them.

156
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,875
[AKUMA groaning]

157
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,250
[AKUMA B] What the...?
Something's wrong!

158
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,958
What's happening to my body?

159
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:40,958
[AKUMA C groaning]

160
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,583
[AKUMA A screams]

161
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:45,583
[KRORY] I gave you all
a taste of my blood.

162
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:49,291
Normally, I would have wanted to
partake of your bodily fluids.

But you've killed so many
of my comrades tonight

it's only right that you should
suffer in the same manner.

00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:06,458
Simply put, it's poison to you.

from one of those Akuma?

Yes. Don't worry about me.

me where you might bleed from.

Whoa, that's not nice!

I didn't do anything to her!

This crystal I'm holding here
is actually her Innocence.

When she almost died taking
down that Level Three Akuma,

it transformed
and protected her.

[LAVI] Whoa. Her Innocence
did that all on its own?

Type Innocence doing something

I am his messenger, after all.

As you can see,
I may be an Akuma,

know what anybody's name is

I know their names, I just
don't know how to spell them!

know the Finders' names!

Nope.
