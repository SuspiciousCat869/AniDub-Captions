[ALLEN]
Ready when you are.

00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:13,666
So how many times do you
wanna be killed today?

I'm slightly impressed that
you haven't run away yet.

[ALLEN] We're not stopping
until I'm satisfied.

5
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:23,916
[FO] And when do you
expect that to happen?

6
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,166
When my arm returns.
When my Innocence comes back.

7
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,875
That's fine.

16
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,375
[WONG] Allen Walker's
fighting style has improved

17
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:02,541
considerably since yesterday.
It's truly amazing.

18
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,416
But pointless.

19
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,541
I admit his arm has adapted,

20
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:09,583
however, only to its
current unstable form.

21
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:11,166
It doesn't matter how
much of his strength

22
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,041
returns or his skill improves.

23
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:16,166
Our goal is to revive
his Innocence.

24
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,166
Unless that happens, he'll
never be an Exorcist again.

25
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,333
[WONG]
Huh?

26
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:27,500

[LENALEE]
I can't save her if I stay here!

37
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:27,916
I have to find her treatment.

38
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,041
Hold on, Allen! I won't be long.

39
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:35,250
I guess this must be
where they parted ways.

40
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:38,750
Allen met with a Noah, and
it destroyed his left arm.

41
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:42,708
The only thing he could do
was save Suman's Innocence.

42
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:47,166
[LENALEE]
It's blood.

43
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,666
He was right here.

44
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,000
But now he's gone.

45
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:57,166
How are we going to find him?

46
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,916
[WONG] I hope you've
said your goodbyes,

47
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,583
because you need to
leave immediately.

48
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:04,916
Our goodbyes?

49
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,333
What are you saying?
Is he dead already?

50
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:10,500
I know that it's
difficult to hear,

51
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,750
but you need to do as I ask.

[LENALEE whimpers]

53
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:18,375
Lenalee, you saw Tim's memory
just the same as I did.

54
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:21,166
Allen lost his left arm
back there, remember?

55
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:25,000
That alone means he can't
be an Exorcist anymore.

56
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,750
We have to accept
that and move on.

00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,583
There was nothing we could do!

60
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:57,458
I mean, come on,
this is war, Lenalee!

61
00:06:57,541 --> 00:07:00,166
We have to move forward!

We're about halfway there.

00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,708
The weather isn't bad.

66
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:38,666
If it holds, we should be able
to reach Edo in two days.

67
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,250
Provided we don't
run into trouble.

Forgive me for bothering
you, Anita. It's late.

71
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:53,208
But I was wondering,

72
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:56,625
could I borrow something
to tie my hair back?

73
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:07,750
These used to belong to my
mother. Do you like them?

74
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:10,666
What? You must treasure them.
Are you sure it's okay?

75
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,000
Of course.

76
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,625
Her original intention was
to pass them down to me

77
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,833
on my 18th birthday.

78
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:20,416
But she was killed by an Akuma
before that day could arrive.

79
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,458
I could never bring
myself to wear them.

80
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:26,833
Killed by an Akuma.
I'm sorry to be asking this,

81
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:30,000
but your mother supported the
Black Order as well, didn't she?

82
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,250
Yes. She fell in love
with General Cross

83
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:35,625
the moment she saw him and that
was that. Classic love story.

84
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,750
Oh. I imagine it was.

85
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,791
[ANITA]
It's hard for me to understand.

86
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:42,166
He really is such
a troublesome man.

87
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,333
I wish I had gotten the
chance to ask her why

88
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:46,833
she kept loving him for so long.

89
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:51,208
But then again who am I
to judge? I'm the same.

00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:17,583

Yes, I do.

One day, you'll be just
like your mother. I'm sure.

[gasps] I don't care.

00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:47,791
After all, everything I'm doing
is because of that man.

99
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:50,458
So I can be of help to him.

100

Everything to help him.

101

Do you think General
Cross is out there?

That's he's still alive?

I believe so. I have to.

Don't get caught up in the war.

You are the successor to a

You are not an Apostle of God.

you that your role

is as a bystander,
not a participant?

The only reason we happen to be

163
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:27,625
[LENALEE gasps]

164
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:36,000
Lavi!

165
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:44,125
[LAVI gasps]

166
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:49,708
Your title: "The Crushed Skull"!

167
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:51,875
[LAVI]
It's over.

168
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,166
[MIRANDA gasping]

169
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:22,750
This isn't my art.

170
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:25,958
[BOOKMAN] Heaven Compass
Binding Spell Needles.

171
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:27,958
North Crime!

172
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:32,208
[ESHI]
Ah!

173
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:36,083
[ESHI groaning]

174
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:51,791
No way!

175
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,541
You had me scared there
for a second, you idiot!

176
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:55,875
[LAVI gasping]

177
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:56,916
I got ya!

178
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,833
[LAVI grunts]
Nice catch.

179
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:06,333
[ESHI] Title: "Why Don't You
Finish Me Off Already?"

180
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:08,000
Oh, I intend to,

181
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:11,250
but first there are a few
questions I need you to answer.

182
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:14,375
Who are you?
Where did you come from?

183
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:18,666
[ESHI] "Eshi was Created from
the Soul of a Japanese Artist."

184
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,916
That's my title.

185
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,250
[BOOKMAN] You didn't travel
all the way out to the middle

186
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:26,500
of the ocean just to hunt
humans for fun, did you?

187
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:30,166
Are you under orders
from the Earl?

188
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,708
[ESHI] Heh. I'd've expected
you wanted information

189
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,375
on Cross Marian.

190
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:36,500
[BOOKMAN]
Hm?

191
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:42,958
[ESHI groans, screams]

192
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,541
[BOOKMAN]
Impossible!

193
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:48,833
[ESHI]
Title: "A Reversal of Fortune."

194
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:59,625
[ESHI] I can tell you about
him on one condition.

195
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:03,625
You agree to be a
model for my art.

196
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:06,708
[BOOKMAN]
You're a Level Three Akuma!

197
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:11,541
Let him go! Extend!

198
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,375
Lavi!

199
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:22,083
[MIRANDA]
I should have told him.

200
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:24,791
He can't move too far
away from the ship.

201
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,958
Bookman! Lavi!

202
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,166
[MAHOJA]
What now?

203
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,583
[ANITA]
Don't lose that Akuma!

204
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,541
All hands! Report to
your battle stations!

205
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,125
[CREW]
Right!

206
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,666
[gasps]

207
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:55,833
I title this...
"Old Man and the Moon."

208
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,791
[LAVI]
No.

209
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,583
Old man! Come on! Please!

210
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:08,333
Wake up!

211
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,208
[LAVI]
Old man!

212
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:20,291
[ESHI chuckles]

213
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:23,083
[LAVI]
Uh... Uh!

214
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:28,750
[MIRANDA cries]

215
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:30,708
[LAVI]
That was close.

216
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:39,625
[LENALEE]
Innocence! Level Two Release!

217
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,958
Lenalee...

218
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,791
Dammit! What's going
on with Lavi?

219
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:50,208
Is Bookman okay?

220
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,041
Who is that?

221
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,625
Lenalee?

222
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:12,541
[LENALEE] You need to
head back to the ship!

223
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,958
[LAVI]
Lenalee! Hold on! Don't go!

224
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:18,041
His power is way different from
the Akuma we've fought before!

225
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,250
He's a Level Three!

226
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,625
You can't fight him alone!

227
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,291
[LAVI gasping]

228
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:29,833
[LAVI] My injuries. Why are
they coming back now?

229
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:32,041
I must be too far
away from the ship.

230
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:32,875
Dammit...

231
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:35,416
Uh. Lenaleee!

232
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:40,500
[ESHI chuckles]

233
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:43,041
[ESHI]
I'll title you...

234
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:48,875
[LENALEE yells]

235
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:58,791
[ESHI]
You're fast.

236
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:01,541
[LENALEE yells]

237
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:09,333
[gasps]

238
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:27,791
The perfect title:
"Are you next?"

239
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,750
Self titled. Cause I'm
going to destroy you!

240
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:56,291
[ALLEN] As the ship is being
destroyed from a skyward attack,

241
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:59,333
Miranda and the rest of the crew
struggle to keep it afloat.

242
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:01,916
Meanwhile, Lenalee
fights against Eshi,

243
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,750
a Level Three Akuma.

244
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:07,291
Will she survive without
the help of her allies?

245
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:09,625
On the next <i>D. Gray-Man</i> :

246
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:11,666
"Sinking Darkness."

247
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,958
Kanda. Do you feel like
playin' a card game?

248
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:16,958
Say what?

249
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:18,208
Then again,

250
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:19,833
we don't have to since
I know I'm going to win.

251
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:21,500
Cut the deck!

252
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:24,041
[ALLEN] A royal flush.
Can you beat that?

253
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:26,625
It looks like a bunch
of random cards.

254
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:28,666
It looks like a win to me.

255
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:32,916
[KANDA growls] I don't play
your Western card games!

256
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,083
This pair is one of a kind.

257
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:39,000
Hey, Allen. Do you want
to play a card game?

258
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:41,208
[ALLEN]
Huh?

259
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:42,916
We're playing Old Maid, huh?

260
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,083
Is this game more
your speed, Kanda?

261
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:46,958
[LAVI]
Heh.

262
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:49,666
Kanda goes well with the Joker!

263
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,125
The perfect match!

264
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:54,125
My sword goes well with
your face, short stack!

265
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:57,541
They're all really good
friends, as you can see.
