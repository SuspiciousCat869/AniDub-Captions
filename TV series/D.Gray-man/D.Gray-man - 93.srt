Yes. It's possible.

161
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,583
Yu and Krory could be alive.

162
00:12:57,375 --> 00:13:00,458
[LAVI]
Yu's got straight bangs!

163
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:03,291
Was that supposed to make me
find you, you dumb bunny?

164
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,583
Ah! Yu!

165
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:11,708
[LAVI] Is that Krorykin's you're
carryin'? He's still alive!

166
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,250
[KANDA] I found him
lying in another room.

167
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,291
What's going on?

168
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:16,875
[LAVI]
You know as much as I do!

169
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:20,666
Hey, short stack! We're all
here! What're ya waitin' for?!

170
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,375
[ALLEN] Don't you ever
call me that name, Lavi!

171
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:26,333
I just heard Allen's
voice! Where is he?

172
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:28,125
Where you hidin', short stack?

173
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:31,041
Call me that again,
see what happens!

174
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:34,458
The name is Allen. You idiot.

175
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:41,041
Allen! Are Lenalee
and Cross safe?

176
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,833
[ALLEN]
They're both here with me!

177
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:45,791
I'll send you a door that
will lead to this room.

178
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,500
[KRORY]
Eliade.

179
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,916
[LAVI] Uh! You hear that?
Krorykin's spoke!

180
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,500
[CHAOZII]
We're all alive! It's a miracle!

181
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,583
I'm so happy.

182
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:10,166
[LAVI]
This place is quiet as a tomb.

183
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,750
Man, how did we get
outta this mess?

184
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:16,041
So wait, were you the one who
put the Ark back to normal?

185
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,583
Yeah, although,

186
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:20,666
I'll admit, I'm not
sure how I did it.

187
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,333
Yeah. I wasn't around
to document it.

188
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:24,416
[ALLEN gasps]

189
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,166
It's Timcanpy!

190
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,416
Come to think of it,

191
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,041
I haven't seen him since
we split up in China.

192
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,000
[ALLEN]
Now, go.

193
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:34,958
t's up to you.

194
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,916
[ALLEN]
Since that night...

195
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,041
...I've just been so
busy, I'm sorry!

196
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:49,708
How I've missed you, Timcanpy!

197
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:52,500
And, look how much you've
grown since you were away!

198
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:53,750
Why have you grown?

199
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:56,125
I hate to interrupt this
touching moment, but--

200
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:58,625
[KANDA]
Can it, short stack.

201
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,333
The name is Allen, got it?

202
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:03,083
I've walked through every
street in this damn town,

203
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:06,083
but I never found any sign
the Noah are still here.

204
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:09,958
Hey, Kanda there's something
I've been meaning to ask you.

205
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,791
What's with that
tattoo on your chest?

206
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:14,625
And that symbol,
does it mean anything?

207
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:18,166
No comment.

208
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,750
What a great attempt
at a conversation!

209
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,916
But what do you say you
give it another shot?

210
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,208
[KANDA]
Piss off.

211
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,875
Just like an old married couple.

212
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:31,500
[sighs]

213
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,083
[KANDA] Let's cut to the chase.
How do we escape, short stack?

214
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,958
[ALLEN] For the last time,
it's Allen, jerk!

215
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:38,041
[LAVI] Can you stop
fighting for a second?

216
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:40,250
I'll check if we
can get out this way.

217
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:41,208
Or not.

218
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:42,041
[ALLEN screams]

219
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,750
[LAVI]
There's no floor!

220
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,583
[yelps]

221
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:48,000
[LAVI]
What? Don't grab onto me!

222
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,291
The hell were you
thinking, short stack?

223
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:54,791
[LAVI]
Choking! You're choking me!

224
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:57,833
I can safely say this isn't
connected to the outside.

225
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,458
I outta drop you, short stack!

226
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,500
[ALLEN]
My name's Allen.

227
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,208
If you're gonna fall,
do it alone!

228
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:03,625
[LAVI]
Did you hear me all right?

229
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:06,000
About the whole choking thing?

230
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,125
I'll lift you guys up!

231
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:09,625
[yells]

232
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,666
I believe in you, Chaozii!

233
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,708
[LAVI]
I believe I'm about to pass out.

234
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:20,166
You betray the sacrifice
they made for you!

235
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,333
If you save him,
then you're my enemy!

236
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:26,791
In my eyes, that makes you
no different than an Akuma!

237
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:31,708
[CHAOZII] After everything, I
still can't forgive you, Allen.

238
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:35,791
Huh?

239
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,250
What is that?

240
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,000
[gasps]

241
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:50,875
[LAVI]
I almost forgot!

242
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:54,166
You're an Accommodator, Chaozii!
And a strong one to boot!

243
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,416
[KANDA]
Explain.

244
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,958
[CHAOZII]
It's attached to my wrist.

245
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,416
My guess is, since the
Ark has been stabilized,

246
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,500
it must've allowed the
Innocence to come find you.

247
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,833
The power to defeat Akuma.

248
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:07,958
This Innocence is mine to wield.

249
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:11,125
A gift from Anita and the crew.

250
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:13,583
I'm sure of it.

251
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:14,958
[LAVI]
Speaking of which,

252
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:16,791
my Innocence has
seen better days,

253
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,458
but here's hopin' it'll
piece back together.

254
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:21,458
Looks like we're in
the same boat, Yu.

255
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,500
[KANDA growls]

256
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,791
I'm sure Komui will
fix 'em for ya.

257
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,708
[KANDA]
Komui is the problem.

258
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:28,208
[KOMUI laughing]

259
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:32,166
Repair them? Of course I can!
For a slight fee that is!

260
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,916
More importantly, I'm
worried about Count Krory

261
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,666
not being able to wake up.

262
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,000
If we don't get
outta this place,

263
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,625
we can't get him the
medical treatment he needs.

264
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:45,083
At least my Master and
Lenalee are watching over

265
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,625
and taking care of him.

266
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,500
Alone together.

267
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,166
[ALL]
Oh, no.

268
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:54,416
[LAVI] A renowned womanizer
and sweet Lenalee.

269
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,625
[KANDA, ALLEN]
Alone? Together?

270
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:01,041
[CROSS] Looks like he
pushed himself to the limit

271
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:02,833
during his battle.

272
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,708
He may be in a coma
for quite some time.

273
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:10,250
[LENALEE] Poor Krory. He got
it the worst of any of us.

274
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:13,916
It was his Innocence that saved
him by supercharging his body.

275
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,291
If you want him to wake up soon,
what he needs is to rest.

276
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,958
That's the best
thing for him now.

277
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:24,583
I'm so sorry. Sleep well, Count.

278
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:26,583
[CROSS] You're more comfortable
revealing your emotions

279
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:28,416
since I saw you last, Lenalee.

280
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,666
What?

281
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,625
[CROSS] And you've become
a beautiful woman.

282
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,875
I don't know about that.

283
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:36,750
But you, you're still elusive
as ever, General Cross.

284
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:39,791
My brother's been searching for
you all this time, you know.

285
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:42,125
[CROSS] The fact he let you
leave his side is shocking.

286
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:43,541
[chuckles]

287
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,833
Tell me, when did you
get aboard the Ark?

288
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:49,083
Remember when you were
fighting the Noah in the city?

289
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,041
I was nearby as well.

290
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:53,333
It was the perfect time
to sneak into the Ark,

291
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:56,416
using Maria's ability
to go unnoticed.

292
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,625
What a shame.

293
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,833
Had I only caught sight of you,

294
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,333
I would've revealed
myself much sooner.

295
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:06,375
What do you expect to
get from complimenting me?

296
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:10,041
It's such a pity.
Your hair was beautiful.

297
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,958
Your hair. It's so beautiful.

298
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,166
Promise me you'll
grow it long again.

299
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,791
Don't let this war beat you.

300
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:21,833
It's kinda strange.

301
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:25,083
Anita said those exact
same words to me.

302
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:31,208
I understand.

303
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:34,708
I told her not to follow me
no matter what happened.

304
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:38,583
She was devoted.
And a fine woman.

305
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,125
General.

306
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:47,416
Please make me a promise.
Protect my Cross.

307
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,041
[ALLEN, LAVI gasp]

308
00:19:59,125 --> 00:19:59,875
[gasps]

309
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:01,708
[screams]

310
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:13,875
[ALLEN]
Master! That's a crime!

311
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,708
[LAVI]
If only we'd gotten here sooner!

312
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:18,583
[LENALEE] What? No. It's not
like that, Allen. We were just--

313
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:22,000
[CROSS] She's 16! A full-fledged
woman! So stop raving, idiot!

314
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:23,208
[ALLEN]
Have you no decency?

315
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:25,291
[LENALEE]
General! You're embarrassing me.

316
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:26,625
[CROSS]
The real crime is you leaving

317
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,625
this beautiful girl alone,
stupid apprentice!

318
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:29,916
[LAVI]
Lenalee,

319
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
are you sure nothing
happened between you two?

320
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,333
[CHAOZII] You Exorcists are
embarrassing to be around!

321
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,250
[LENALEE] Hold on. What do
you guys think happened?

322
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,666
[ALLEN] All I know is that
it's a crime, Master.

323
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,958
--[ALLEN] A serious crime.
--[KANDA] Oh, who cares?

324
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,916
Sweet Eliade.

325
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:17,916
[ALLEN]
Our arduous journey concludes

326
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,958
and we arrive home at the
headquarters of the Black Order

327
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:23,958
for a long overdue
reunion between friends.

328
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:26,333
However, our feelings
of joy are short lived

329
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:28,916
as dark clouds loom
on the horizon.

330
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,958
On the next D.Gray-man:
"Homecoming"!

331
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:35,250
Bring forth salvation to
this poor Akuma's soul!

332
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:38,333
Hey, Lavi. Who were you
saying has short bangs?

333
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:39,875
You mean Kanda!

334
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:42,083
[KANDA]
Yeah? That so, eye patch?

335
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:43,708
[LAVI]
Huh? Wait a minute!

336
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:46,333
[KANDA]
Mugen! Unsheathe!

337
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:48,416
[KRORY]
You guys are too noisy.

338
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,333
I was in the middle
of a great dream.

339
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:52,125
Krorykins is awake!

340
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:55,291
Are any of you even
listening to my lecture?

341
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:56,541
Anyone?
