1
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:48,833
When it's finished, everyone
will know I'm a genius!

2
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:49,916
Please?

3
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,916
Alright then...

4
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,458
I'm so glad!

5
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:53,125
No problem.

6
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:55,583
Hey there, Lenalee!

7
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:56,916
Komui?

8
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,708
Well, don't you two seem
to be having such fun...!

9
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:00,000
What are you talking about?

10
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:01,875
You know how much
I love a good conversation!

11
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:04,333
I'll just catch up
with you in a bit.

12
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:07,625
Thanks, Russell...
We'll chat soon.

13
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:10,208
Lenalee... what was
all that about dear?

14
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:11,666
I already forgot...!

15
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,541
I'll see you later, okay?

16
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:17,333
Suspicious...

17
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:21,083
What could my sweet
Lenalee, be hiding?

18
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:26,458
Reever!

19
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:27,625
Yeah?

20
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:29,083
It looks like you
guys are busy as usual.

21
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:30,750
Oh, Allen...

22
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:33,500
Yeah, the Chief keeps sending
us one task after another.

23
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:35,166
What?!

24
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,416
You're going out?!

25
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,583
Uh-huh...!

26
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:40,125
I haven't had a day
off in a long time!

27
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,291
Lenalee...

28
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,125
Ah...! She is... pretty...

29
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,833
Oh, no! I was just...

30
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:51,875
Lenalee...!

31
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:53,458
Where you off to?

32
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,416
Just to town to
do some shopping...

33
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,375
...that is... if my brother
here will let go of me.

34
00:02:58,458 --> 00:02:59,666
That's not a good plan...!

35
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,625
That town is
extremely dangerous!

36
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:03,166
Yeah, but Lenalee's tough,

37
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,666
so you don't have
to worry, right?

38
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,833
 I am pretty tough...

39
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:08,250
Alright... see ya later!

40
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,291
Have a good time, Lenalee!

41
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:13,500
No...! Wait! Lenalee!

42
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:14,791
Excuse me, Chief...

43
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:16,708
...but I think it's
time we got to work.

44
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:17,583
Ahh!

45
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:19,083
Let go of me, Section Leader!

46
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,041
Let me go!

47
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,708
Take your hands off me Reever...

48
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:25,166
Hey, uh... where's Mr. Russell?

49
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,833
Oh... Oh, Russell,
it's his day off...

50
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,083
Come to think of it,

51
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:31,125
I'm pretty sure he was
headed into town, too.

52
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:36,166
Did he say Russell was in town?

53
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,833
Could he and Lenalee...

54
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:41,375
No! I have to stop them!

55
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,583
Ya think the Chief's... alright?

56
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:45,625
Don't know.

57
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:51,375
Chief?

58
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:54,166
I brought the results
of the analysis!

59
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:56,250
Komui?

60
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,333
I wonder where he ran off to...

61
00:03:58,416 --> 00:03:59,583
There's trouble!

62
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,083
Section Leader Reever, hurry!

63
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,500
The storage room in the basement

64
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:05,916
has been unsealed and
Sir Komlin the Second is gone!

65
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,625
What?!

66
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,291
You're kidding!

67
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,583
Russell, you lecherous fiend!

68
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:14,166
It can't be coincidence they
were so secretive earlier,

69
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:18,125
and they both just happened
to go into town today?!

70
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,291
Oh yes, it's perfectly clear

71
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:21,708
that they're dating...!

72
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:24,000
How disgusting!!

73
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,791
And they've taken to
sneaking out together...!

74
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,458
Dear Lenalee,
I did not raise you

75
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:31,000
to be dishonest and
immoral, young lady!

76
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,750
Hear me now, Sir Komlin...!

77
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:35,833
Use your upgrade to
stop this relationship!

78
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:53,291
Exorcists... where are they?!

79
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,375
What are you yelling about?!

80
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,291
Quiet!

81
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,666
This is shameful--I
am an Akuma...!

82
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,916
When I was a Level One

83
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I was able to take
human life quite easily...

84
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,166
but at Level Two
I haven't killed

85
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:29,250
even a single one--what
am I doing wrong?!

86
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,833
I must pull myself together...!

87
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:36,708
After all, I do have a perfect
transformation ability.

88
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,541
Now, transform!

89
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,458
So handsome!

90
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:02,666
So it seems I can convince

91
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,208
even the animals
with my disguises...

92
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:09,041
My transformation
ability is quite phenomenal!

93
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,541
Is it possible
that the perfection

94
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:13,833
of this valuable skill has
caused me to lose all of my--

95
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:16,750
Oh, no... it can't be true.

96
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:20,541
I managed to get this
picture of an Exorcist...!

97
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:24,583
I'll kill her and bid farewell
to my old, pathetic self.

98
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:31,375
Wow... she's pretty!

99
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:37,791
How lucky...!

100
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,666
I'm not so pathetic, after all!

101
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:48,125
What's happening?!

102
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,000
Targets locked on, Lenalee...

103
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,208
Russell...

104
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:08,500
I don't understand!

105
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:09,750
Mama, what's that?

106
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:14,833
Shh, come on; don't
look it in the eye!

107
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:17,416
That's funny...

108
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,875
Filthy octopus...!

109
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:23,000
Trying to put his hands
all over my sweet Lenalee...!

110
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:29,583
Upgraded Sir Komlin,
eliminate Russell the pervert!

111
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:42,666
Oh my...

112
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:46,208
Let go of me...!

113
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:47,208
I have to kill him!

114
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:49,166
I have to kill that pervert...

115
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,291
Please, Chief, you're
going to have to calm down!

116
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:52,666
Using Sir Komlin like this

117
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,166
could easily destroy the
town if you're not careful!

118
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,958
The most important matter
is my Lenalee's safety,

119
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:59,750
so what if we have to
sacrifice a town or two...

120
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:02,750
Okay, this obsession
is getting kind of sick.

121
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,750
Allen... deal with this please.

122
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,458
Yes, sir!

123
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:16,041
Ahhh...!

124
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,041
My upgraded Sir Komlin!

125
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:21,125
Allen, you idiot
octopus helper outer...

126
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:27,666
Hey, what is this thing...?!

127
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:31,041
It won't come off!

128
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:34,291
That's a good look for you!

129
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:37,083
I've got just the
thing for that pervert...

130
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,125
Ahh...! Step away
from the gun...!

131
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,875
Please, Chief Komui!

132
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,583
Do you believe he
was really intending

133
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,750
to use all these
octopi on Russell?!

134
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:46,375
Come on now,
Chief, think about it!

135
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:48,583
Your sister and Russell are
just walking around together

136
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:51,333
and talking, that doesn't
mean they're dating, does it?!

137
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:54,166
Do they look like they just
happened to run into each other?

138
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,625
You know Russell has a son,
don't you, Chief...?!

139
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,125
That means he's
probably way too old

140
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:01,000
to make a move on
Lenalee, wouldn't ya say?

141
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,958
Let's just wait and see, okay?

142
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:07,750
I'll, reserve judgment.

143
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,416
However...

144
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,625
If I discover they're dating

145
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:15,000
the jerk will have
nowhere to hide!

146
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:21,250
It looks like a shop
for men's clothes.

147
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,291
I knew it! They're dating!

148
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:24,625
You can't know that based on

149
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,500
what kind of store
they walked into, Chief!

150
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:27,750
Ahh, it's no use...!

151
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,208
I can't get it off!

152
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,083
May I help you?

153
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:35,041
Do you have a good tie
selection?

154
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,916
Certainly, Miss... this way.

155
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,375
What do you think of this one?

156
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,666
Let me see...

157
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,458
They haven't noticed
that I'm an Akuma...

158
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:49,833
I'm able to fool
even the Exorcists...

159
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:54,166
My transformation ability is
absolutely very, very perfect!

160
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,750
Pardon me.

161
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:06,625
No... I won't...

162
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:09,666
I won't allow it!

163
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,291
I'll take care of
that fiend Russell

164
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:14,375
by blowing him and everything
else on Earth to smithereens!

165
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,583
We need some help, Allen!

166
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,958
Allen is busy fighting
the octopus, sir.

167
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,041
Timcanpy, pull harder!

168
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,750
Fine, then you do it, Lavi!

169
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:24,916
Okay...

170
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,416
We're saved...

171
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:35,750
Hey!

172
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,791
One way or another, he will die!

173
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:39,708
Sorry, Chief...

174
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,500
Here's my chance...

175
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:03,833
Oh no, was the
wall weak or something?

176
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,291
I don't understand!

177
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,625
What the hell do you
think you're doing...?!

178
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:14,333
You blew half of the
store away, Chief!

179
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:17,416
Do not be alarmed,
that bomb was programmed

180
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,291
to hurt everyone except
my dear sweet Lenalee.

181
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:22,500
You are missing the point, sir!

182
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:24,708
I can't get it off of me!

183
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,666
I'm begging you...

184
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,291
Leave this café alone...

185
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,166
Are you listening
to me, Chief...?

186
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,500
Don't do anything to
jeopardize these people.

187
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:46,291
I'm rather uncomfortable
taking orders

188
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,458
from a man wearing a dress.

189
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,166
Oh really, and just
why do you suppose

190
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,875
we're dressed up this way?!

191
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:53,708
Don't look at me...

192
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:54,875
Okay go ahead.

193
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:57,208
Pull it, don't worry about me!

194
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,166
Sorry to keep you waiting...

195
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:08,958
Why... thank you!

196
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:12,291
You're welcome, Miss, enjoy.

197
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:17,083
Now drink up...
drink your poisoned tea...

198
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:19,625
One sip will send you
to the Netherworld.

199
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:22,458
How many sugars
do you usually take?

200
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,541
Oh... I'll do that myself.

201
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,458
Fly my pink fuzzy ones...

202
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,833
Destroy Russell!!

203
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:35,916
Lavi!

204
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,958
Yes, sir... Grow!

205
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,500
Wow... again?

206
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,208
Why... Why me?

207
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:56,083
Damn you--

208
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:57,958
Did you see their hands?!

209
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:00,708
Anyone would have
thought they were dating...

210
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,916
This time she'll die for sure!

211
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,791
Mr. Russell, come in here!

212
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,666
What?

213
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,250
I was looking at this one!

214
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:23,083
Ah, yes, that's a
very good choice!

215
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,750
The charade ends
now, Russell...!

216
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,125
Number sixty-five!

217
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,375
Yes, sir!

218
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,166
Move out...

219
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,375
Macho number sixty-five!

220
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,250
Attack!

221
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:49,333
Just give it a rest!

222
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,500
Was that a dart...?!

223
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,958
Damn you, Chief,
I'm gettin' super sleepy...

224
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:00,583
Give that to me. Take it, men!

225
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:13,708
Man, this has been
happening all day!

226
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,500
Enough is enough,
you have to stop this!

227
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:25,708
But he but they
but but but I can't--

228
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,291
No... No more!

229
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,625
Chief, please, you
have to calm down!

230
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,875
I can't bear any
more mistakes...!

231
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:57,708
I have to take my chance now.

232
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:06,958
I wonder what
happened to the lights?

233
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:10,541
Don't worry...
It's probably just a blackout.

234
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:15,750
I'm sure the lights
will come back on soon.

235
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:24,833
Exorcist, prepare to die!

236
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,916
My Lenalee!

237
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Komui what... What are
you doing in town?

238
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,791
Russell, you won't
get away with this!

239
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:39,625
Stand by...! Sir Komlin
the Third deploy!

240
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,166
I'm the only one
who falls on her...

241
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,125
Well, I... I don't...

242
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:09,583
I don't know what's going on,

243
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:12,041
but there's no reason for
you to be so upset, brother.

244
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:14,375
Be quiet, quiet, quiet!

245
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:26,750
Oh, no...

246
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:29,208
Is that...

247
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,958
Komlin?

248
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:34,166
Sir Komlin the Third!

249
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,666
And now, Sir Komlin...!

250
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,541
We will annihilate Russell!

251
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,791
Komlin... Punch!

252
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:47,541
There's no escape!

253
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,791
Hey, stop, quit it!

254
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,708
Unreal...

255
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,250
Faster!

256
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:04,083
Jump!

257
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,458
Komlin Kick!

258
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,875
I... I'm not that Russell
person I swear to you...

259
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:15,000
I'm really an Akuma!

260
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,416
You're exactly right,

261
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,458
anyone seducing Lenalee
get's treated like an Akuma...!

262
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:22,250
Komlin High Beam!

263
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:35,875
Come on... Lavi...

264
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:37,583
You've got to help
us stop the Chief!

265
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,041
I... I can't...

266
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,375
Allen!

267
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:00,208
Komlin High Beam!

268
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:14,791
Say hi to Sir Komlin the Third's
killer technique, Russell...

269
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:17,083
Komlin Fist--

270
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,458
What are you doing
here, brother...?

271
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:19,958
Answer me!

272
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:23,000
I don't care what you do,
I won't accept it, Lenalee...

273
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:25,166
Russell can't be your boyfriend!

274
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,166
My boyfriend...?!

275
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,958
You think Mr. Russell is...

276
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:30,666
Where in the world did
you come up with that?!

277
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,500
But the two of you
went on a secret date!

278
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:37,625
I saw it all with
my own eyes, the horror!

279
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:38,583
Geez...

280
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:41,791
Russell! Are you
alright, buddy?!

281
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:43,833
Here.

282
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:44,833
What's this?

283
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,541
It's a present for you...

284
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,291
I came to town today to buy it.

285
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:51,625
A present for... me?

286
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,375
I asked Mr. Russell
to come with me

287
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,333
to help pick
something out for you,

288
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:57,291
and then I thought
I would return the favor

289
00:18:57,375 --> 00:19:01,250
by helping him find a really
nice present for his son, John.

290
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:04,500
Well gosh, I certainly wish

291
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,750
you'd told me all
of this sooner...!

292
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:10,166
Sir Komlin...! You
may stop the attack!

293
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:15,375
That was too close!

294
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,375
I think it's safe to
say we're done here!

295
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:24,708
Mr. Russell, I'm sorry for the
trouble my brother has caused.

296
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:26,291
Oh... no problem.

297
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,583
Thank you and I believe
we did have a deal

298
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:31,791
so let's go and find that
present for John.

299
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:34,500
At last, I can finally kill her!

300
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:44,750
Lenalee!

301
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:47,416
Why am I such a bad Akuma...!

302
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:51,625
I guess I'm glad the
pretty girl gets to live!

303
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,041
Don't worry, everyone, I'm here!

304
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:59,083
Thank you, Allen, you--

305
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:05,708
Where's Mr. Russell?

306
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:08,375
The real Mr. Russell
is just fine.

307
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,833
I'm so glad,

308
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:12,833
but why do you think that
Akuma was just targeting me?

309
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:14,750
I really have no idea.

310
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:16,583
Woo-hoo...!

311
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:19,208
I got a present from Lenalee...!

312
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,125
She got it just for me...!

313
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:24,625
A present, a
present, woo-hoo...!

314
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:25,791
Uh-oh...

315
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:28,916
I think you've done
enough damage today!

316
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,458
Sir Komlin...

317
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:39,375
Sleep...

318
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:40,625
My sweet...

319
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:42,708
So what are we going
to do about this mess?

320
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:45,458
I propose we all pitch
in to fix the damage...

321
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:48,458
I'll leave you to it while
I go visit Sir Komlin...

322
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:49,916
Let's get to work!

323
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,750
He plays with a robot
while we're cleaning up,

324
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,583
all those in favor of burying
him in one of these walls?

325
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,041
Let's get him.

326
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:02,250
What's the matter, everyone...?
Ow, that looks sharp...

327
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:41,375
In searching for
traces of my Master,

328
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:43,375
I travel to a small village,

329
00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:46,541
where I am asked to
face off against a vampire.

330
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:50,041
On the next episode
of D.Gray-man:

331
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:52,500
"Vampire of the
Solitary Castle."

332
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:56,250
Bring forth salvation to this
tormented Akuma's soul!
