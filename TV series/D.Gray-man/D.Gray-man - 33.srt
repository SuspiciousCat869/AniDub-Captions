1
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:45,041
Um... Um...

2
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:47,833
No, this isn't it either.

3
00:01:47,916 --> 00:01:49,291
I'm... lost...!

4
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,958
All these rooms and
I can't tell which one's mine!

5
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,916
Why do these doors
look exactly the same?

6
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:01,791
Wait...

7
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:04,500
Maybe this is the one.

8
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,166
This has to be it...

9
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,000
I don't know why, but
I just know this is my room!

10
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:11,833
Miranda?

11
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:13,583
It's okay... Are you lost?

12
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,833
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
I'm so sorry!

13
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:18,750
Calm down... What's wrong...

14
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:19,708
I'm lost...

15
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:21,416
I think that room is Kanda's.

16
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,375
It's probably best
that you didn't go in...

17
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,458
Now if I'm remembering correctly

18
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:29,666
that's your room
right over there.

19
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,000
Oh, thank you! Thank you!

20
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:35,125
Lenalee...

21
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:36,958
Komui wants to see
you right away, kay...

22
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:38,625
Coming!

23
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:40,083
Hey, what were you doing

24
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:41,625
standing in front
of Kanda's room?

25
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:42,791
Oh...

26
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,083
Miranda got lost and
thought it was hers.

27
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:45,458
Ah. Miranda.

28
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,416
I hope she learns
her way around soon.

29
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,291
She will. I'm sure she will.

30
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:08,375
Come on, Daisya.

31
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:11,500
Is it that hard to draw a
map I could actually read?

32
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,375
I have obtained information
on the General's whereabouts.

33
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,375
I will be waiting
for you in Alfheim,

34
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,333
which you will
find beyond Mitterwald

35
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:22,500
and the village of
Dankern... Daisya...

36
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:35,250
Not thinking of going to
Dankern Village, are you?

37
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,541
If you are, then
I certainly wouldn't rely

38
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,875
on these signs to
find your way there...

39
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:43,458
I move these signs to keep
people away from that place.

40
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,500
I'm sure you've heard
all the horrible rumors?

41
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:47,666
What rumors?

42
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,041
Ah...

43
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:50,625
People around here have
been whispering for ages now

44
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:53,166
about an evil witch
living in the village...

45
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,666
I'm not one to gossip,

46
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,625
but the story is that she
survives by eating the children

47
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,750
and travelers she
lures into her home.

48
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,750
My destination is
just beyond Dankern...

49
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:02,666
Now which way is it?

50
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,666
You're the stubborn
type, aren't you...?

51
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,791
At least I tried.

52
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:09,916
If you keep following the path,
you'll come to a forest.

53
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,875
If you've still got
your heart set on it,

54
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:13,208
pass through the forest

55
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:15,791
and you'll find Dankern
Village on the other side.

56
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:19,416
Thanks for your help, old woman.

57
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,583
You'll regret not
listening to my advice...!

58
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:23,916
The locals don't call it

59
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,750
"The Forest of No Return"
for no reason, you know!

60
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,041
I'm telling you, turn back now!

61
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:31,583
You'll go missing just like
those three poor fellas dressed

62
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,666
all in white did the other day!

63
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,041
You hear me?

64
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:38,125
Of course you do, but
you're not paying attention!

65
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:40,875
Some people...

66
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:44,875
Three men dressed
all in white. Hm...

67
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,500
Innocence... Activate!

68
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,291
It was an Akuma after all...

69
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:26,375
This must be the forest
the old woman was so afraid of.

70
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:28,833
Who are you?

71
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,833
Please don't kill me!

72
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:33,875
That uniform...

73
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,833
Are you a Finder?

74
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:37,916
Yeah! I am...!

75
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,500
But people
just call me Goz.

76
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:46,041
Wait...! Don't go...!

77
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,375
What do I call you?

78
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,166
The name's Kanda.

79
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,500
Kanda the Exorcist, right?

80
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:54,500
It's an honor...

81
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:55,958
I only joined the
Order a few months ago,

82
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:58,083
but I'm such a
big fan of your work!

83
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:00,416
Oh? I couldn't tell.

84
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,708
Sorry about that...

85
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:05,708
...but... I'm just
so happy you're here.

86
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:07,541
When an Akuma killed
my two partners earlier,

87
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:11,500
I figured it was just a matter
of time till they got me, too.

88
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:12,833
But it'll be okay...!

89
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,458
Now that the Black Order
sent you to help me,

90
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,166
everything's going to be fine!

91
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,083
To help you?

92
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:18,333
Yeah...!

93
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:19,750
They sent an Exorcist
to check on my team...

94
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,291
The Black Order had sent us

95
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,000
to investigate the
village up ahead.

96
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,583
And when they lost
contact with our team,

97
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,500
they were so worried
the Order dispatched

98
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,583
an Exorcist to see
what was wrong...

99
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:29,958
That's why you came...

100
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,583
Right...? Kanda...

101
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,875
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

102
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:39,375
Don't go...! I really
need your help...!

103
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:40,708
What'll I do?

104
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:43,875
You can go back to
Mittenwald and wait.

105
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,458
Calm down...

106
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:47,583
I'm sure the Order will send an
Exorcist to check on you soon...

107
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:51,583
But you're here...! Kanda!

108
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,333
The forest near Dankern
Village has earned itself

109
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,833
a new moniker lately:
The Forest of No Return.

110
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,750
It seems travelers
heading to Dankern

111
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:04,166
by way of the forest
are disappearing.

112
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,875
Here's the full report.

113
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:06,875
Thanks.

114
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,625
We have to examine
the possibility

115
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:11,333
this was caused by Innocence...
It sounds likely.

116
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:12,833
You're absolutely right...

117
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,208
In fact, we sent three Finders

118
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:16,833
to investigate exactly
that two days ago...

119
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:20,166
But we lost contact with
them almost immediately.

120
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,291
We can't rule
out the possibility

121
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,125
there are Akuma in the vicinity.

122
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:25,375
So here's the plan...

123
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,083
I want you to join
Allen on his assignment,

124
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:29,000
but I'm afraid
this takes priority...

125
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,333
As soon as you're
finished investigating

126
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,500
the disappearances,
go and find him.

127
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:34,458
Yes, sir.

128
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:03,333
Wait...! Hey, I want
to come with you!

129
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:19,250
Not bad...

130
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,666
How'd you get so fast...

131
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,125
Well, I played a
little football in school.

132
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:25,291
If I wasn't this fast then
I never would have been able

133
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:28,625
to get away from that Akuma.

134
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,916
Hey, you can't stop like
that without telling me!

135
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,625
What'd I ever do to you?

136
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,291
Hi... You guys
wouldn't be trying

137
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:53,083
to get to Dankern
Village, would you?

138
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:02,291
Whoa...! We don't
want any trouble, okay?

139
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,250
Trouble is exactly
what they want...

140
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,791
It's time, Mugen.

141
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,833
Innocence... Activate!

142
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:08,500
One more to go.

143
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:11,708
Help! Help me!

144
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:16,750
Stay right where you are...

145
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,750
Kanda, get this
monster off of me!

146
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,708
Don't move or your friend dies.

147
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,875
Go ahead and kill him, then.

148
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,708
I said go ahead and kill him!

149
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,250
Moron! Get off me!

150
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,583
I'm trying...

151
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:52,125
He got away.

152
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:54,208
Gee... I'm real sorry...

153
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:57,875
It was all my fault,
please forgive me!

154
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:58,916
If he makes it to Dankern,

155
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,208
we'll probably
never see him again.

156
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:02,875
Yeah... That's true...

157
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:04,583
Then let's go.

158
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,750
So... this is
Dankern Village, huh?

159
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,458
We haven't seen
any more Akuma...

160
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:21,916
Yet.

161
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,458
And if there are
any people around,

162
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:26,875
they're sure keeping quiet.

163
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,000
I think I know
why no one's around...

164
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,250
You're covered in blood...

165
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,750
It doesn't exactly give
off a warm impression...

166
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,166
It doesn't make any difference.

167
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,166
If we want people
to talk to us it does!

168
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:48,625
There you go!

169
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,208
Isn't this a lot better?

170
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:56,583
No wonder the townspeople

171
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,458
were trying so
hard to avoid us...

172
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:00,916
This investigation
is off to a rocky start!

173
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,333
I told you I'm not
here to investigate.

174
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:05,041
But why?

175
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:18,750
Is it just me, or is that
cabin really kind of creepy...

176
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,583
Well...

177
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:40,041
Ah, hello?

178
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:42,708
Nice day isn't it...

179
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:45,500
Do you happen to know
who lives in this shed?

180
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,000
No one...

181
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,791
No one has lived there
for a very long time.

182
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:52,375
I can see why...!

183
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:53,875
It isn't the most
inviting-looking

184
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:55,416
place I've ever seen...

185
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,791
If I didn't know better I'd
think it's where a witch lives!

186
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,000
Witches aren't real...

187
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:00,625
There's no such thing.

188
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:03,208
Not real... Of course.

189
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,750
Tell me...

190
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,875
Have you noticed any suspicious
people around town recently?

191
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,666
Suspicious people?

192
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,666
Yeah...

193
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,041
You see, we were
following somebody

194
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,416
and we think they
might be trying

195
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,000
to hide out in Dankern Village.

196
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,125
I'm sorry...

197
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:18,041
I haven't seen who
you're looking for.

198
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,583
You have lotus flowers here...

199
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:40,916
I've lived in this town my
whole life, and I've been

200
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,375
coming to this pond for
as long as I can remember.

201
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:49,041
And I've never seen
them blooming until today.

202
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,625
It could be this
is the first time

203
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,750
they've blossomed
in your lifetime.

204
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,291
The seeds of a
lotus flower can sleep

205
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,625
in the soil for
a thousand years.

206
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,833
And then one day
they bloom again.

207
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,708
They bloom every
thousand years...?

208
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:03,666
Lotus seeds can really stay
asleep for such a long time?

209
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,208
Yes.

210
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:07,250
I wonder what it's like
for them to be awake...

211
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,875
Or if they'll ever
want to bloom again.

212
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,541
I feel sorry for them.

213
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:14,833
It takes so long to bloom,
and they die so quickly.

214
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,583
Well, I wouldn't say that...

215
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:19,666
The lotus will blossom long
after you and I are gone.

216
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,791
Are you sure?

217
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,583
Believe me...

218
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,250
I wish I could be
there to see it.

219
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:29,333
You know a lot about lotuses
for such a young man...

220
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,625
They're only flowers.

221
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,541
Here you go.

222
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:39,791
It's not much...

223
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,625
But I hope it's enough
to tide everyone over.

224
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:42,791
It's perfect...!

225
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:43,750
You're giving us a
place to stay the night

226
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:45,458
and a hot meal, too...?

227
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:47,333
I don't know how to thank you!

228
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:48,041
Oh, wow!

229
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,375
I'm starving!

230
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:55,208
Sofia takes quite a bit of
pride in the food she makes,

231
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:56,708
so I'm glad you appreciate it...

232
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,500
Yeah, it's delicious!

233
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:00,833
Stop it...

234
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,458
Right... I'm sorry...

235
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:04,583
I almost forgot what
we came here to ask them.

236
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:08,375
Uh... I hope I'm not
being rude, but--

237
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,958
Where's the rest of your family?

238
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:14,166
My wife passed away
about ten years ago... so...

239
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,875
That's really sad,
but it does explain

240
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,625
why Sofia is such
a great cook for her age.

241
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,791
I'm so glad you liked it...

242
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,666
Do you mind if I ask
what brought you both

243
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,875
to a secluded little
village like ours?

244
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,750
To tell you the truth...
we're here to investigate...

245
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:30,166
Now I don't want
to frighten you,

246
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,916
but rumor has it that
everyone that goes

247
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,750
into this forest
never comes out again...

248
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:37,041
Do you think it's true?

249
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:43,458
Have you seen anyone around
lately that wasn't a villager?

250
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,666
Someone you didn't know?

251
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,291
Actually...

252
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:50,750
Uh... Besides us, of course.

253
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,166
Well...

254
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,166
You both are the first
I've noticed in a long time...

255
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,041
Oh, is that so...

256
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:58,500
Sorry, I work in Mittenwald...

257
00:15:58,583 --> 00:15:59,583
I don't notice much here,

258
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:00,958
since I'm always working to care

259
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,833
for the family
with my earnings...

260
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:05,583
Because I haven't had any
time off in such a long while,

261
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,416
I came to Dankern
to visit father,

262
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,375
when my boss offered
me a short vacation...

263
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:10,375
I see...

264
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:11,500
On your way here
you must have had

265
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,250
to travel back
through the forest...

266
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:14,916
How long ago was that?

267
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,708
Oh... Probably about
a week and a half ago.

268
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:20,416
Okay, interesting...

269
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,458
What's the matter?

270
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:23,000
Oh...! It's nothing...!

271
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,708
I'm just so relieved we have
such a nice place to stay...!

272
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:27,166
I guess I got a little nervous

273
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:31,958
when I heard there might
be a witch living in the area.

274
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:35,583
I... I apologize.

275
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:37,708
Are you all right, Father?

276
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,541
Yes, dear... I'm fine.

277
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:42,458
My trick knee is acting up...

278
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:45,916
If you don't mind
I'm going to bed.

279
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,208
You'll have to excuse my father,
but he's almost as superstitious

280
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:54,041
as everybody
else in this town...

281
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,166
I should have told you before,

282
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,458
but people here
have given a name

283
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:58,458
to the cabin you
asked me about earlier.

284
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:01,416
It's "The Witch's Cabin,"
and everyone avoids it.

285
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,500
Except you...

286
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,416
It doesn't seem
to bother you at all.

287
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,250
I don't really
believe in witches...

288
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:09,083
But if I thought one lived
there, I'd be terrified.

289
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,125
Hold on...

290
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:11,250
You're saying
there isn't a witch?

291
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:12,291
Right.

292
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:13,500
Up until about a
month ago there was

293
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,708
actually a very sweet
and lonely old woman

294
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,250
who lived in that cabin.

295
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:18,791
But the townspeople
called her a witch

296
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,166
and drove her away...

297
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,250
If only they had taken
the time to get to know her,

298
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:26,416
this whole thing
could have been avoided.

299
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,875
Are you finished?

300
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,375
Sorry...

301
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,958
Knowing there's no such thing
as witches made me hungry.

302
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:33,916
I'm glad.

303
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,166
It's nothing fancy,

304
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,833
but I hoped you saved
some room for dessert.

305
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,041
Here.

306
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:41,125
Thanks so much...!

307
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:42,833
Jellybeans are my favorite...!

308
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:45,625
I can't even remember
the last time I had any!

309
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:47,125
Well, it's getting late...

310
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:49,791
We should rest up for
our big day tomorrow.

311
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:51,583
I'll show you to your room.

312
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,333
This is the guest bedroom,
it's where you'll be staying...

313
00:17:58,416 --> 00:17:59,708
And I'll be in
the room next door,

314
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,250
so if there's anything
at all that you need,

315
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:02,833
please don't hesitate to ask...

316
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:03,833
I'm sure it's perfect.

317
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,541
Thank you.

318
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,250
Hey, Kanda.

319
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,416
You can sleep in
the bed if you want.

320
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:14,541
The town seems nice.

321
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:17,083
And there isn't any
sign of Innocence...

322
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,958
Not yet...

323
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:21,791
I guess it was all those
Akuma we ran into...

324
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:24,166
But at least there's
no such thing as witches.

325
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:29,125
We came all this way...
and it's just another dead end.

326
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,375
Which means first
thing in the morning

327
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:31,750
you'll probably
be off on the road

328
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,458
to your next mission, won't you?

329
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:35,458
Not until I destroy that Akuma.

330
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:38,458
Right... That's what I meant.

331
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,125
A dead end, huh...?

332
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:49,666
Certainly haven't learned
much about the Akuma.

333
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:53,833
Something feels... wrong.

334
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:55,375
But what...?

335
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,416
It's right on the
edge of my mind...

336
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,500
But... I can't put
my finger on it.

337
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:20,666
Sofia...? No, it couldn't be.

338
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:57,875
It's Goz.

339
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,333
It's you again.

340
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:22,250
What is your purpose
in this forest...?

341
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:24,375
Why do you kill people
who come to the town?

342
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,708
I'm only doing my job...

343
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:28,416
Following orders...

344
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,125
<i>Her</i> orders.

345
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:33,250
Mind telling me who <i>she</i> is...

346
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:43,458
I failed you...

347
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:46,333
Please forgive me.

348
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:59,208
"Please forgive me"...?
But for what?

349
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,708
The answer must be inside.

350
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:39,541
Fear made the witch's rule

351
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:41,916
over the town of
Dankern complete.

352
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
In the end, it was almost enough

353
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:47,750
to keep the truth behind
the tragedy hidden forever.

354
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,958
On the next D. Gray-man:

355
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:52,500
"The Village Where
a Witch Lives, Part 2."

356
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:56,083
Bring forth salvation to
this tormented Akuma's soul!
