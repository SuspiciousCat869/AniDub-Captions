1
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:41,291
No! Mei Ling!

2
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:02,208
We lost her.

3
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:03,791
Why did it take Mei Ling...?

4
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:05,541
What could it possibly want?

5
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,958
It would appear that the Akuma

6
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:09,375
are after the
girl's crystal ball.

7
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:13,916
Do you know something...

8
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,958
Did her grandfather
tell you why?

9
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:17,416
Yeah... They want the ball?

10
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,208
Yes...

11
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:19,583
I believe it's very likely

12
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:22,458
that Mei Ling's crystal ball
is indeed, Innocence...

13
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:24,625
I'll provide more details later.

14
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:25,708
Hurry and go now...

15
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:27,958
The girl is in grave danger...

16
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:29,500
Please save her...

17
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:32,333
Mei Ling is everything to me.

18
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:34,041
Yes, sir!

19
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:52,250
Extend!

20
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:57,416
What?

21
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:01,041
Now, let's go!

22
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:02,833
Yes, lets!

23
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:23,875
It looks like there's
a lot of Akuma

24
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,666
at the lake up ahead of us!

25
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,958
We've gotta hurry!

26
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:48,416
Where am I?!

27
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,500
Look around... Isn't it obvious?

28
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,250
The lake... What's happening...?

29
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:02,708
Don't you remember...?

30
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:04,500
You threw the
ball into the lake

31
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,583
and now it's caused a whirlpool.

32
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:08,500
Well done!

33
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:12,166
You may have uncovered
something very valuable to us

34
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,041
called Innocence!

35
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:17,375
Innocence...

36
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:18,708
But if it's your ball,

37
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,625
does that mean it
contains Innocence?

38
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:23,708
You know what it is...

39
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,333
No, I don't!

40
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,625
It makes no difference
if you admit it or not...

41
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:35,666
I'll know the truth
when I drop you into it.

42
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,166
No one is able to
go near the whirlpool

43
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:42,750
but the ball belongs to you,
so let's see what happens...

44
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:47,166
Oh no... help me!

45
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:55,125
Mei Ling has had the
gift of telling fortunes

46
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,791
ever since she was
just a tiny little thing.

47
00:04:57,875 --> 00:04:59,916
The ball was a family heirloom,

48
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,666
and when she touched
it she talked like she had

49
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,375
seen the future
in it; clear as day.

50
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:07,083
And everything she
foretold always came true...

51
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,166
It was amazing, really,

52
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:12,041
how accurate and
vivid the visions were.

53
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,500
When her predictions
came to pass

54
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:21,625
the townspeople were happy,
and I think that's what

55
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:24,416
really made her want to
keep telling fortunes...

56
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:29,125
Mei Ling has always found her
happiness in pleasing others.

57
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:35,083
But then, one night
about a month ago,

58
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:37,666
my heart jumped in my chest
when I heard her scream.

59
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,291
She became afraid
of the crystal ball,

60
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:50,458
and refused to even go near it.

61
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,833
I asked her what she saw,

62
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:57,083
but she just looked
at me and trembled...

63
00:05:57,166 --> 00:06:01,125
and she seemed so petrified
of the ball and so fragile...

64
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:05,250
I'm telling you, she was almost
on the verge of a breakdown.

65
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,291
And that's why I took
the ball out to the lake

66
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,208
and threw it overboard...

67
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:20,875
I was scared and
I wanted to protect her.

68
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:23,791
An ordinary crystal
ball couldn't cause

69
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:26,833
a lake to dry up
like that, could it?

70
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:29,083
It's got to be something else.

71
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:32,541
But we suspect we're not dealing
with an ordinary crystal ball.

72
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,083
What?

73
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:37,000
If we're right and this ball
does turn out to be Innocence,

74
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:39,958
then your granddaughter...

75
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:49,208
Hey, you okay?!

76
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:50,583
You shouldn't get distracted!

77
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,166
Say what...

78
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,416
Crap!

79
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:11,958
That wasn't much fun.

80
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,583
Hey, are you okay, Krory

81
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,500
I'm fine...

82
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:19,375
Look... there...

83
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,250
Ah hell, it's another one!

84
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,500
And it seems to be
carrying someone!

85
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,208
What?!

86
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:28,750
No... No!

87
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:29,750
A little girl...?!

88
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,666
What could they
possibly be doing?

89
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:37,791
Well lookie here...

90
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,166
Found you...

91
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,916
You're actually very
lucky, you know that!

92
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,416
Oh, we know...

93
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,625
But you guys, not so much
'cause we're gonna nail ya...

94
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:48,125
That we will!

95
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:48,958
Really...?!

96
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,541
What're you gonna do?!

97
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,208
Whaddya think?

98
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,166
We're gonna fight!

99
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,041
And kick ass!

100
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,041
Hold on!

101
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,583
Mei Ling... Wait!

102
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,958
Lenalee!

103
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,583
Oh no!

104
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,791
Too late!

105
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:26,041
It dropped her!

106
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:28,416
What was that?

107
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,791
I don't want to!

108
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:55,416
No!

109
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:05,000
What's happening to it?!

110
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,416
Can you see anything?

111
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:15,000
There she is...!

112
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,833
Innocence, activate!

113
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:18,541
Wait, Lenalee!

114
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:20,833
Open your eyes...!

115
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,625
Are you okay, Mei Ling?!

116
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:55,500
What is it doing?

117
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,416
It's sucking up all the water.

118
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,333
Is that it?

119
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:05,333
Yes...

120
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:07,125
That's my crystal ball...

121
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:10,625
The one grandfather
and I threw into the lake.

122
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,125
Mei Ling...

123
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:15,833
you need to know that that's
no ordinary crystal ball.

124
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,000
It's an Innocence fragment

125
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:19,750
and I'm pretty sure
you've been chosen

126
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:22,583
to be the Accommodator
of that Innocence.

127
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,791
What does that mean?!

128
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,958
Innocence...

129
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:33,666
It's the source of miraculous
powers that have the ability

130
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:37,333
to cause all sorts of
mysterious phenomena...

131
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:38,875
It also gives humans the power

132
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:41,250
to fight the Millennium Earl
and all of the demons

133
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:45,458
under his control, who hope
to destroy this world...

134
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:49,958
Innocence is humanity's only
hope against these evil forces.

135
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:53,666
And so... for us,
Innocence is life

136
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,375
but for demons, or Akuma,

137
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:58,625
it's something to
be hated and hunted.

138
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:01,000
Each piece of Innocence
can only be controlled

139
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:03,750
and used to its full
purpose by one person,

140
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,875
known as an Accommodator...

141
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,958
Accommodators of
Innocence are the only people

142
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,958
who can gain the
power to fight Akuma

143
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:13,541
and they're also known as...

144
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:17,208
The Exorcists.

145
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,625
Exorcists...

146
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:30,000
So that's really Innocence...

147
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,375
It is?

148
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:34,166
Yes and you're probably
the Accommodator

149
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,416
of that Innocence, Mei Ling...

150
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,125
Which would mean that,
well, you're one of us.

151
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:43,458
I'm like you... an Exorcist...

152
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,500
Wow, looks like it's expanding.

153
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,333
Now!

154
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:03,500
Idiot Akuma!

155
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,458
What's it doing?!

156
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:14,916
Alright then how about this!

157
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:29,416
No...

158
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:34,458
No!!!

159
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,750
Nooooo!!

160
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,041
Come on... Let's go!

161
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:50,375
Mei Ling...

162
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,041
Allen...! Lenalee, hey!

163
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,416
Are you both alright?

164
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,625
Yeah, what's going on?

165
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,416
Well...

166
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,916
No... no... Never!

167
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,916
It's okay.

168
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,583
Please don't make me...

169
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:08,375
I can't...
I can't touch it again!

170
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,000
About a month ago,

171
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:18,916
the crystal ball showed me
a different kind of future.

172
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:30,166
It was dark, and terrible,
and full of death.

173
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:33,041
I didn't mean to.

174
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,625
I promise I was
only trying to help...!

175
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,250
I love the people here
and I wanted to do

176
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:40,625
what I could to make them happy!

177
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:44,583
Why did this happen...? Why??!

178
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:49,625
It's alright...

179
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:53,583
Don't worry about it.

180
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,958
Poor little thing...

181
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:57,250
I wonder what vision
the ball revealed to her?

182
00:13:57,333 --> 00:14:00,375
I'll bet... that Mei Ling
saw her own future.

183
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:02,458
But then why would that
frighten her so much?

184
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:05,416
Because that girl's an
Accommodator of Innocence,

185
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,000
so the future that she
got to see in the crystal ball

186
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:11,291
must've been one
of her as an Exorcist.

187
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:14,166
We all know that we've
chosen a dark and bloody path,

188
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:17,791
but we still have hope because
we can't see how the story ends.

189
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:21,041
That's right... and she can.

190
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,916
Listen to me...

191
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,750
I have to stay here, but
I want you to go on home.

192
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:30,791
Really?

193
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:35,125
Yes, really.

194
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,083
I want you to go take
care of your grandfather

195
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:38,541
and enjoy every
minute of your life

196
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,416
and forget all about this...

197
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,583
Don't worry about
Innocence or the future.

198
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,875
Mei Ling...

199
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:58,125
I'm so glad I got to meet you.

200
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:01,916
Wait!

201
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,541
Yes?

202
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:11,416
Lenalee... don't go.

203
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,416
What was that?!

204
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,000
What's happening to it...?

205
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,166
Is it moving now?

206
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,541
It looks like the
Innocence is beginning

207
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,541
to spin out of control.

208
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,375
Out of control?

209
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,291
Yes...

210
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,083
Your Innocence has real power,

211
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:44,208
the power to show
you future events...

212
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:45,875
I'm guessing it might
even be the force

213
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,375
that literally connects
the future and the present

214
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,041
for just an instant in time...

215
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,375
So, then...

216
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:52,875
The Innocence might lose control

217
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:55,750
if it was separated from its
Accommodator and the present

218
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:59,125
and was somehow directly
connected to the future.

219
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:03,125
However it happened,
we have to hurry

220
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:05,375
and stop it before
things get worse.

221
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,291
I'll help...

222
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:16,125
Mei Ling... there's
something I want to say, okay?

223
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,666
Sure.

224
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,583
You should know that the
path you're about to take

225
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:23,625
may lead you to an even
more painful, harder future

226
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,750
than the one
you've already seen...

227
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:29,166
Knowing that,
do you still want to do it?

228
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,750
Yes!

229
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,083
Okay then...

230
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,041
I'll be beside you all the way.

231
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,458
Yeah, alright!

232
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,291
Come on. Let's do it!

233
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:44,750
I'm feeling hungry!

234
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:48,208
Yeah, it's time
to settle things.

235
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,833
How am I supposed to
do anything about this?

236
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:54,250
Extend!

237
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:02,166
Now, Lenalee!

238
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,416
We're counting on you!

239
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:10,750
Are you scared?

240
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:11,708
No!

241
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,666
Then you better hold on tight.

242
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,250
I will!

243
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:18,583
Innocence... activate!

244
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,125
Are you still alright?

245
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,458
Yes, I'm fine!

246
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,458
It's just for a
little bit longer, 'kay?

247
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,000
Okay!

248
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:30,708
Now Innocence...
Level Two release!

249
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:45,208
I'm so sorry for not
understanding you.

250
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:49,166
I didn't know you were
suffering, just like I was.

251
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:53,208
I think... we can finally
come together now.

252
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,791
Lenalee!

253
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,416
Did they make it?

254
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,833
They did it!

255
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,791
What's the matter?

256
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:15,916
Lenalee, will I really be
able to become an Exorcist?

257
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,166
Mei Ling...

258
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,625
Are you still scared...?

259
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,041
What you saw must've been awful.

260
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:23,750
It was... but...

261
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,708
it didn't show me everything
that's going to happen.

262
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,166
And maybe that could mean

263
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,041
there's more to the story
and there's a bright future

264
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:33,500
beyond what I could see then.

265
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:36,833
That's what I hope...

266
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:39,625
If I'm with you I'll be fine.

267
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:43,333
You're very brave...
you know that?

268
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,458
I've got you now!

269
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:13,750
Alright!

270
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,833
The water's back...

271
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:38,875
They must've gotten the
Innocence back under control.

272
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:42,125
That means Mei Ling has made
her choice then, doesn't it?

273
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:46,458
I do pray for her sake that
it was the right decision.

274
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:50,458
Ultimately, no one can tell if
the future will be good or bad.

275
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:56,583
I guess you're right...
and, either way

276
00:19:56,666 --> 00:20:00,083
it's the future she's
chosen for herself.

277
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,541
Ah man...

278
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:06,458
Well, we somehow
managed to survive that.

279
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,750
It was a tough one this time.

280
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,416
Hey, look out there!

281
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:33,708
Unacceptable!

282
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,541
You are totally useless!

283
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:38,500
Begone.

284
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,166
What?!

285
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:45,875
Well, what do you think

286
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:47,666
we should do now,
Madame Lulu Bell?

287
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,500
I've been thinking about
this new turn of events.

288
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,250
I know, with a
new stupid Exorcist

289
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:54,000
on the scene and
her unknown powers

290
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:56,500
I don't know what
we're supposed to do next!

291
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:04,541
We'll report it... to Master.

292
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,458
To impress her beloved Madame...

293
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:43,416
Mimi mounts a strong,
solitary attack...

294
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:47,541
in the hopes of stealing Mei
Ling's new-found Innocence.

295
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:52,666
Next time on D. Gray-man:
"Madame Lulu Bell's Bell."

296
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:56,083
Bring forth salvation to
this tormented Akuma's soul!
