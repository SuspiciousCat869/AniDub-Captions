1
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,750
Innocence has altered
its own biology.

2
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,375
Of course it doesn't
happen overnight...

3
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:42,791
Most estimates
place the timeline

4
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:44,875
between Noah's Flood
and the present.

5
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,500
This may be due to the
crystal's mysterious power

6
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:53,166
trying to communicate with us

7
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,125
or any number of
unknown reasons,

8
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:57,041
but it seems that
Innocence always finds

9
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:59,625
its way into human hands.

10
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:01,208
The one thing we
still can't figure out

11
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:05,083
is why Innocence is causing
the strange phenomena.

12
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,750
Master Walker, tell me,

13
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:09,541
are you at all familiar
with the Ghost of Mater.

14
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:10,791
I'm not.

15
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:12,375
It's fascinating.

16
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:14,333
The story harkens
back to the days

17
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:16,500
when the city fell
into the ruin...

18
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:18,833
The ghost was originally
an inhabitant of the city

19
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:20,916
before it met its demise.

20
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,375
As people visited the city,

21
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:24,708
the ghost would draw
them toward his being,

22
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:27,083
in an attempt to
relieve his loneliness.

23
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:35,750
Innocence...

24
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:37,750
Activate!

25
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:40,750
Mugen.

26
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:42,916
Summon Misfortune!

27
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,041
Underworld...

28
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,875
Creatures...

29
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:49,958
First Illusion!

30
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,250
Have you come to
save us, Exorcist?

31
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,166
You're safe...

32
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,791
Ghost of Mater

33
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:17,041
Wait...

34
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:18,875
It's not an Akuma...

35
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:20,625
It's a fake!

36
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:24,958
I'm right... behind you.

37
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:36,458
What the...

38
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:42,416
There's two of me.

39
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,208
But how are you able to do that?

40
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:51,583
I copied you...

41
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:52,916
it was easy...

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,541
I even duplicated your power.

43
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,375
This new ability is a
pretty good trick...

44
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:01,416
isn't it...?

45
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,333
When an Akuma
evolves to Level Two

46
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:06,250
then a brand new skill
is awakened, you see?

47
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:09,041
So now... when I
touch something...

48
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:10,750
I have the ability to copy it...

49
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,958
and even make it part of me!

50
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:14,500
Brilliant!

51
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:33,625
He's strong...

52
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:34,833
incredible...

53
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:37,541
this is what happens
when an Akuma evolves?!

54
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:42,750
That Akuma is matching
Master Walker's every move...

55
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,958
Die!

56
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:08,083
This feels wonderful!

57
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:11,291
What a lovely new
plaything I have!

58
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:19,125
How cute... Your turn!

59
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:23,916
All Akuma are fashioned
from dark matter...

60
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,250
a polar opposite material of
the Innocence that we seek.

61
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,708
Unfortnately, the more
the Akuma fight us,

62
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:33,625
the more they evolve
and gain strength...

63
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,416
When an Akuma reaches the
next level it changes...

64
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,291
it develops it's own
ego and begins to talk.

65
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:42,083
It also learns new abilities...

66
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:44,166
They become much
more powerful...

67
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,000
It's not the same enemy...

68
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,541
and the man trying
to fight it...

69
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,708
will have to
struggle to keep up.

70
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:51,416
Then what will happen?

71
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,125
Well, sooner or later...

72
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:56,125
the Akuma will discover
where we are hiding.

73
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,166
Afraid it's only
a matter of time.

74
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,250
And so...

75
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,916
you want the Innocence...

76
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,500
before the Akuma comes here...

77
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,333
is that what you're
trying to say?

78
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:08,208
It is...

79
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:10,333
And to be blunt, I need it now.

80
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,833
I see.

81
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,041
What are you?

82
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:21,666
I am the Ghost of Mater.

83
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,916
Nice try, old man.

84
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,333
But, you're no ghost.

85
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:25,500
That's right...

86
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,541
I am a doll.

87
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,291
Guzol!

88
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,291
A doll?

89
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,541
It was very hard here...

90
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:36,041
The rocks, the dry weather...

91
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:39,583
the sunlight was blazing
and oppressive...

92
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:42,000
People actually
used to call Mater

93
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,166
"The Land Forsaken By God."

94
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:48,958
The citizens, who lived in
great suffering and despair,

95
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,125
wanted desperately to
forget their troubles,

96
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:53,833
even if only for a moment.

97
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:55,666
They created a doll...

98
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,750
a doll that would
sing and dance...

99
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:02,125
the city soon went to ruin
and the people disappeared,

100
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:06,041
but the doll stayed alive.

101
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:10,083
And here I am...
the Ghost of Mater.

102
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:13,541
This city went to ruin--what--
five hundred years ago...?

103
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,958
And you've remained
alive all this time?

104
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:17,375
I have...

105
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:21,208
Innocence pounding in my heart.

106
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:22,625
Whatever the case...

107
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,583
It won't be easy for
you to escape this place

108
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:27,083
on foot and I can't
carry you both...

109
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:28,458
so if you don't mind...

110
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,291
I need to take your heart now.

111
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:31,500
Wait...!

112
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,416
If we can't escape,
then why don't we hide?

113
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,708
Oh... and who are you?

114
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:39,583
Well, I'm...
Guzol's... helper...

115
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:42,333
She's a child that was
abandoned by humans...

116
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:46,333
I found her and took her in.

117
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,375
Guzol, are you alright?!

118
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,083
So you think we
could hide, huh...?

119
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:52,458
Do you know of a
safe place to go?

120
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:54,375
Toma...

121
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,333
What's up? Is anything wrong?

122
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:58,791
I've been watching
from a safe distance...

123
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,333
There was a violent
impact earlier

124
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:03,541
and Master Walker's
condition is unknown.

125
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:07,166
The Akuma just came out
of the building alone...

126
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,083
It's chasing the Golem!

127
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:10,250
Okay...

128
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:11,791
It's risky for you
to stay there too long

129
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:14,583
and I need to see what Timcampy
recorded immediately...

130
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:17,083
get out of there and
come to this location...

131
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:19,083
I'll send my golem
your way to guide you...

132
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,041
Got that?

133
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,083
Yes, sir, I understand.

134
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:27,708
Come here... Come here!

135
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,833
Helloooo?

136
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:33,125
Hey tell me... does this hurt?

137
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:39,125
Now, where o where
is the Ghost of Mater?

138
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,958
Find Toma and be careful.

139
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:57,541
Damn... we're really
running out of time...

140
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:58,875
Listen, we--

141
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,291
They're gone.

142
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm alive!

143
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,458
Where did it go?

144
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:32,791
How long...

145
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,791
How long was I unconscious?

146
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:38,458
The Akuma must be
around here somewhere.

147
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:39,791
I've got to stop it...

148
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:41,666
But I can't defeat
it by myself...

149
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,750
My only hope is
that Kanda's close by.

150
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,083
Who's there?

151
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:54,000
It's me... I am alone.

152
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:54,958
Toma.

153
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:57,000
Where is the Ghost of Mater?

154
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,541
He escaped.

155
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,041
Here is Timcanpy.

156
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,625
Alright Tim, I need you
to show me everything

157
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,250
you discovered about the Akuma.

158
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:20,541
It looks just like him.

159
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:22,958
A dangerous skill...

160
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,166
He's a mirror.

161
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:29,375
The Akuma can become...
a mirror image?

162
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:40,541
Hold on...

163
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:44,250
I can't believe
I'm actually lost.

164
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:48,125
It's pitch black in here.

165
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:49,875
No one knows about this path...

166
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:52,958
The Akuma and the Exorcists
won't be able to find it.

167
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:56,208
I can't see anything...
Are we alright, Lala?

168
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:57,916
We're fine...

169
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,458
This way.

170
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:00,875
I'm used to it...

171
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:04,375
I've been underground for
so long... that... well...

172
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:07,166
I've learned every
part of these ruins...

173
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:14,416
Guzol, we made it.

174
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:20,250
Look, when he
transformed into Allen,

175
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:21,708
the right and left
sides of his clothes

176
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:24,125
and weapon are reversed...

177
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:25,541
And here...

178
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:27,791
it's the same where
the kid sliced it...

179
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:30,250
plus, I don't see
anything inside the body...

180
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,916
like it's a shell or something.

181
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,708
This is not simply a
new transforming skill...

182
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:36,916
it's more like the Akuma

183
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,916
is using some ability
to copy a target...

184
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,500
and once a copy is made it can
also gain the target's power.

185
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,291
Toma, do you see
how the Akuma changed

186
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:49,500
the shape of the kid's left arm
just before it attacked him...?

187
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,625
Allen gave him a dangerous
edge--something we don't need...

188
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:55,250
I feel like I should've gone
and looked for Allen...

189
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:58,666
If the Akuma transformed into
him then how will we know who...

190
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,416
Don't worry about that now...

191
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,083
We should be able to spot
the Akuma... easily.

192
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:05,625
It'd be pretty stupid
for him to appear

193
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:08,416
as the kid at this point.

194
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:12,791
Look over there!

195
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,958
K... Kanda...

196
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:30,791
See...?

197
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,916
It's sides... are reversed!

198
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,375
Don't just stand there...

199
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,250
Attack me, creature!

200
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:46,083
No... Master... Kan... da...

201
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,000
Summon Misfortune...

202
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:52,125
Underworld Creatures
First Illusion!

203
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:53,375
Be vanquished!

204
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:02,041
What the--

205
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:09,416
Thank you... Master...

206
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,625
Who are you...?

207
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,291
Idiot!

208
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:15,958
What the hell are you doing?!

209
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:17,625
You fool...

210
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:19,875
Why would you defend an Akuma?!

211
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:21,916
I'm sorry, Kanda,
but using my left eye,

212
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,041
I can tell that this person
is not an Akuma at all...

213
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:27,750
In fact, this looks
very strange to me...

214
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:30,000
What do you mean?!

215
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:33,708
Ma... ster... Walker...

216
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,833
Something's wrong
with his face...

217
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,208
Is it his skin?

218
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,666
Toma!

219
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,041
Toma?!

220
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,625
Look out, the Akuma
is right beside you!

221
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:56,500
No...

222
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:57,958
Kanda!

223
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,458
You son of a bitch...

224
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:03,791
You've been--

225
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:08,041
Oh yes... see I'm very
good with disguises now...

226
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:11,166
After I crushed that
little yellow Golem,

227
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,833
I found this guy creeping
around in the shadows.

228
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,791
So I just copied him

229
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,375
and you couldn't even
tell the difference...!

230
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:21,625
However you did figure out
that our sides are reversed.

231
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,166
Which is why I decided to put

232
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:27,875
that gray-haired kid's
body on this Toma person.

233
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:28,416
Oh my...

234
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,916
I'm a genius!

235
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,083
Think of me as a carbon copy...

236
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:34,625
You had no idea,
did you Exorcist?!

237
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,541
He's dead...!

238
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:52,291
The Exorcist is dead!

239
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,000
Wrong Akuma...

240
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:55,500
I can't die...

241
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,750
Not until I find someone.

242
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,333
But until that happens...

243
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,958
I'll still be here...
so deal with it.

244
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:03,583
Wrong answer!

245
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:09,750
Amazing...!

246
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:12,416
He can stand up when he's dead?

247
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:25,291
Haha...! You can
try all you want...

248
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,208
but it's useless!

249
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,250
Kanda!

250
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,375
You're still alive.

251
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,291
Damn that little bastard...

252
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,333
He wasn't nearly
that strong before.

253
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:54,833
His death will be
slow and painful!

254
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:57,083
You will pay...!

255
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,416
Where are they?

256
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,833
What the hell...?!

257
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:04,625
Damn you... Where did you go?!

258
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,875
Master Walker...

259
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:10,791
Please...

260
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,416
Just leave me here...

261
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,291
You must be injured, too...

262
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,208
It's alright...

263
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:18,666
You don't have to take me.

264
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:22,333
It'll take a lot more than
that to get me to leave you.

265
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:23,333
But he's right...

266
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,166
We'll never escape like this...

267
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,416
If I could just...

268
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,541
If there was only a
good place to hide...

269
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,375
Where are you???

270
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:36,875
Come out come out wherever
you are so I can kill you!

271
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:46,791
Guzol...

272
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,750
do you think they're
still fighting up there?

273
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,000
Your coughing's worse...

274
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,583
Oh no.

275
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,333
I'm fine.

276
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:55,916
Oh, Guzol...

277
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,833
what made you tell that scary
man earlier that you are a doll?

278
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:01,625
Because I wanted to protect you.

279
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:05,333
I don't want anyone
to hurt you, Lala.

280
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:08,416
You're too good to me...

281
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:14,166
I'm sorry... but I should
lie down for a while.

282
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,750
Alright.

283
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:29,833
I know that you don't
have very much time left.

284
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:32,416
Is there anything
I can do to help you?

285
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,291
No...

286
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,250
I just want to sleep.

287
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,916
That's just fine...

288
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,875
I'll sing you a lullaby.

289
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:59,416
I was deceived. The Ghost
of Mater is a doll...

290
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,291
And they found a way
to escape from me.

291
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,458
He and the little girl
must be hiding out...

292
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,375
We... We must find them.

293
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:10,583
Alright, but before we go
after the doll I wanted to--

294
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:14,333
Kanda... hear that?

295
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,291
It's coming from below.

296
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,166
Wind?

297
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,000
Something's down there...

298
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,125
I think it's coming from here!

299
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:46,125
This is good...
We found a safe place to hide.

300
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:50,000
Where did you go?!!!

301
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,791
Exorcist!!

302
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,833
Let's stop... We need to rest.

303
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:14,541
How much deeper
can this thing go?

304
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,791
It's that song!

305
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,458
It was very hard here...

306
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:01,291
The rocks, the dry weather...

307
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:04,208
the sunlight was blazing
and oppressive...

308
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:06,583
People actually
used to call Mater

309
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:09,750
"The Land Forsaken By God."

310
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:13,666
The citizens, who lived in
great suffering and despair,

311
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,041
wanted desperately to
forget their troubles,

312
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:18,958
even if only for a moment.

313
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:20,666
They created a doll...

314
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,458
a doll that would
sing and dance...

315
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:27,083
the city soon went to ruin
and the people disappeared,

316
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:30,791
but the doll stayed alive...

317
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,125
And here I am...

318
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,416
the Ghost of Mater.

319
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:50,958
You came.

320
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:54,708
Forgive me... but I had to...

321
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:55,875
You're the doll...

322
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:58,166
The Ghost of Mater.

323
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,791
The doll that lived
to sing a song...

324
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:44,708
Lala's voice is gentle and
fills the land of Mater...

325
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:48,000
I want to protect her
and keep her safe!

326
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:50,666
On the next episode
of D. Gray-man:

327
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,750
"Let Me Hear the Lullaby."

328
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:55,875
Bring forth salvation to this
tormented Akuma's soul!
