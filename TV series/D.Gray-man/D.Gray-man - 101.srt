[KANDA]
Get ready.

320
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:07,625
It's the Level 4!

321
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:09,166
Komui!

322
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:16,750
[yells]

323
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:20,250
[gasps]

324
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:21,500
Komui!

325
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:26,500
Big brother!

326
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:29,625
I'll go help them!
There may still be time!

327
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:30,083
[ROUVELIER]
Hm?

328
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,416
Is that--?

329
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:36,791
A Level 4. Come on,
Komui! Don't die!

330
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:39,125
Lavi. Brother.

331
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,416
[ROUVELIER]
With the elevator broken,

332
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,500
retrieving the Innocence
is off the table.

333
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:50,625
Hevlaska! Implant an
Innocence in her! Now!

334
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:53,666
[ORDER MEMBER G]
Wake up, Chief.

335
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:54,958
[KANDA]
Damn it, Komui.

336
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,333
[ORDER MEMBER F]
Chief.

337
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:03,041
[KOMUI] Blast. The elevator,
can it be repaired?

338
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,458
Looks like it's beyond saving.

339
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:11,875
Did you shield me?
You saved my life.

340
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:14,125
Shut up. It's nothing.

341
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:31,083
I can't belive it. Are you
all right, Chief Komui?

342
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:32,833
Yeah, I think so.

343
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:34,916
Did either one of
you get injured?

344
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,250
Don't worry. We're--

345
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:44,333
[LAVI]
Komui! Kanda!

346
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:45,666
Lavi?

347
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,875
What do you know?
You're still alive!

348
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,000
[KANDA]
Of course we are.

349
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,208
[KOMUI]
If Lavi's here, that means...

350
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:57,708
Lenalee!

351
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:59,500
[LEVEL 4] Does this mean
our little game of tag

352
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,375
is over, Chief?

353
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:05,375
If you're smart,
you'll fall back.

354
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,250
You gotta be kidding.

355
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,333
You gotta be kidding.

356
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:15,250
[ROUVELIER]
Stop delaying, Hevlaska.

357
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:18,166
Implant an Innocence
inside of her.

358
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:34,875
You're sure about this?

359
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:36,833
I'm prepared.

360
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:40,875
Yes, I want this.
It's all right.

361
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:42,833
I'm sorry, Komui.

362
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,500
Get it over with.

363
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:55,083
Hevlaska!

364
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,833
[ROUVELIER]
Hevlaska! Hevlaska!

365
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,708
[LEVEL 4]
How lucky can I be?

366
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:07,583
There's even more humans
here than I thought.

367
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,875
[LAVI]
Damn it.

368
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:17,916
[KOMUI]
Lenalee.

369
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,416
[LENALEE]
Big brother.

370
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:26,666
It's... so close.

371
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:33,166
[LENALEE]
My vision's getting blurry.

372
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,875
It's no use.

373
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:38,750
Please.

374
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:45,541
God, I've hated you for so
long, but hear me, please.

375
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:50,541
I'm begging you...
Give me strength.

376
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:54,708
Never before in my life
have I wanted Innocence

377
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:57,250
as much as I do now.

378
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:32,291
[ALLEN]
As our final moments draw near,

379
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:34,750
Lenalee says one
last prayer to God,

380
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:37,000
begging for her
Innocence to return.

381
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:41,166
Is her wish going to be granted
or will it fall on deaf ears?

382
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:44,291
On the next D. Gray-man:
"The Promise."

383
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:47,708
Bring forth salvation to
this poor Akuma's soul!

384
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:52,333
Principal Earl.

385
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:55,291
I've successfully infiltrated
the class without suspicion.

386
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:56,500
[LEVEL 4 chuckles]
