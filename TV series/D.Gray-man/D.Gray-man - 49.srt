1
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:41,208
What?

2
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:44,750
They found Innocence
and an Accommodator?!

3
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:46,000
That's right...

4
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:47,541
That's troublesome...

5
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:50,916
Find out what sort of power
she has and report back to me.

6
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,708
Yes, Master, I will.

7
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:58,666
I've received new orders
from the Millennium Earl...

8
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:02,375
He wants me to investigate the
power of the girl's Innocence.

9
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:03,916
What a clever plan...!

10
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,500
Please, allow me to go with
you and help, Madame Lulu Bell!

11
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:17,875
I'll put it back
on you right away!

12
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:18,750
No thanks.

13
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:19,291
Huh...?

14
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:20,666
Why not?

15
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,291
It wasn't like the bell
was given to me by Master...

16
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:24,750
You can throw it away.

17
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,541
Really...?

18
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:29,666
What if I wanted to keep it
for myself? Would that be okay?

19
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,291
If that's what
you wish then fine.

20
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:34,458
Oh, thank you so much, Mistress!

21
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:39,583
It's kinda hard...

22
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:40,833
How kind of you.

23
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:43,000
To think you're actually
helping me put it on...!

24
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:44,500
Wearing your bell
will be like carrying you

25
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:47,708
with me wherever I go now!

26
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:49,166
I have an idea, Mistress...

27
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,583
Not only will I learn about
the new Innocence's power,

28
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:54,666
I'll also steal it from
the girl and bring it to you!

29
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:58,375
Just remember,
know when to retreat.

30
00:02:58,458 --> 00:02:59,791
Yes, ma'am!

31
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,541
This is the first
time Madame Lulu Bell

32
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:26,875
has given me something since
I started working for her.

33
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,333
The days when
I would kill humans

34
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:33,791
in monotonous repetition
changed when I met Lulu Bell.

35
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,541
Sure, all she wanted
was for someone

36
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:39,500
to tend to her fingernails
at her beck and call...

37
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:42,375
but the idea of a person
wanting me to serve them...

38
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:46,208
of someone needing me;
made me feel good.

39
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,041
And I'll succeed... for her!

40
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:02,333
Okay, they said they'd
be sending a Finder

41
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:05,541
from the Asia Branch to
come here to get Mei Ling.

42
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,250
Maybe we could all go with
you to the meeting place

43
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:12,166
just to be sure everything
goes according to plan.

44
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:14,625
That's a good idea...

45
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:17,125
Well then... I guess we should
go get ready for the trip!

46
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:18,333
Okay!

47
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,625
It's a big day...

48
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,875
I'm so glad you
decided to join our team.

49
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,458
I admit I'm a little nervous...

50
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:38,791
but I feel better
when I'm with you.

51
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,208
Try not to worry...

52
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:43,500
Because I have a hunch
you're going to do just fine.

53
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,541
Still, a part of
me wonders if the Order

54
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,375
will ever become as
important and special

55
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:50,791
to me as this village
has been over the years.

56
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,291
What do you see?!

57
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:05,416
The villagers...

58
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,916
They're being attacked...

59
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,666
It looks like... Akuma!

60
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,625
Where are they?

61
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,458
We have to help them...

62
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,250
Excuse me!

63
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,833
Hello there, Mei Ling!

64
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:22,375
You have to get out of here!

65
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,250
But why?

66
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:25,875
It's over there!

67
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:28,791
Innocence Activate!

68
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:38,958
I wonder if this one
was in the group

69
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:40,750
that attacked us before...

70
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:43,208
That was amazing, Mei Ling
with a power like yours,

71
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:46,750
we'll be able to know in advance
when the Akuma are attacking!

72
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:50,000
Are you okay?

73
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,458
I'm fine, thanks...

74
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:54,750
Why don't we go get some rest?

75
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,125
Well that's gonna be a pain...

76
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:03,750
We definitely need
to steal the Innocence

77
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,875
as soon as possible before
they make a weapon with it.

78
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,666
Do you feel alright?

79
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,583
Better...

80
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,583
Thank you for helping me...

81
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:17,208
I'm so glad we were able to get
there and save those people...

82
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:18,541
Lenalee...

83
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:21,291
I know I couldn't have
done it without your help.

84
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,708
You must be thirsty.
I'll get you something to drink.

85
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,291
That sounds good.

86
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:33,625
Hey, where are Allen and Krory?

87
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:36,083
They decided to go out
and patrol the town a bit.

88
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,208
How's our newest little comrade?

89
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:40,875
Honestly, I think
she looks really tired.

90
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,958
It appears Mei Ling's
Innocence reacted

91
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:44,333
to being thrown into the lake

92
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:48,166
by becoming fully
activated apart from her.

93
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,916
I would imagine that trying
to control Innocence that hasn't

94
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,750
yet been made into a weapon
is probably quite exhausting.

95
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,291
Even seeing into
the future as she does

96
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:00,916
may require a
considerable amount

97
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,375
of both mental and
physical strength.

98
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:04,916
And if she becomes an Exorcist,

99
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,041
there's a good chance
she'll see a lot more visions

100
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,125
of people being
attacked and worse.

101
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:12,041
It's true, the girl may not last
unless she's very determined

102
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:15,083
to develop inner
strength and self-control...

103
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,416
Mei Ling spent much of her life
helping the people here

104
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,708
by telling their fortunes
and making them happy...

105
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:24,875
It lit her up inside and
she was always glad to do it.

106
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:26,125
However...

107
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:28,166
I can see that becoming
an Exorcist is probably

108
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,458
an unavoidable future
for my granddaughter.

109
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:34,958
And so, I beg you
to give her your support.

110
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:46,083
Aren't you two guests
at Mei Ling's house?

111
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,125
Yes, ma'am!

112
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,666
We heard that
sweet girl is going

113
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,291
to be leaving the village soon
to take up working with you!

114
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:53,583
You'll have to take
good care of her for us!

115
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,000
Yes, she's always been sensitive

116
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:57,541
ever since she was
little... Look after her.

117
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:58,541
We will.

118
00:07:58,625 --> 00:07:59,875
When people heard
she was leaving,

119
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:02,416
the whole town decided
to throw a party for her.

120
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,041
It's tonight and we'd love
for all of you to come...

121
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:07,791
Thank you, we'll be sure
to tell the others about it.

122
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,041
It's nice to know that Mei Ling

123
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,708
is obviously very
loved by the people here.

124
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:12,916
I know.

125
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:24,583
I can almost see something...
but it's not clear...

126
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,083
Excuse me...

127
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:27,125
Hello?

128
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:28,750
Sorry to bother you...

129
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:32,125
but I'm looking for the
girl who tells fortunes.

130
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:33,541
That's me.

131
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,875
Oh, then I'm so glad
I found you...!

132
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:37,708
My master sent me
because she's desperate

133
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,500
for you to tell her fortune.

134
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:40,875
Why?

135
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:44,250
Well, to tell you the
truth my master's very sick.

136
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:45,833
And I just know she'll cheer up

137
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:49,875
when you tell her she's
going to feel better soon!

138
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,583
Oh, please...!

139
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,875
We traveled all this way
because of your reputation...

140
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:56,708
The people here say such
wonderful things about you!

141
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:59,250
Alright... where's your master?

142
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,958
We're sharing a room at that
Inn over near the main road...

143
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,291
I could take you there now.

144
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:04,666
Sure, that'd be fine...

145
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,583
I'll be ready in just a second.

146
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,541
Oh, thank you
so much, Miss...!

147
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,166
You're so, kind!

148
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,375
Sorry for the wait!

149
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,000
Oh no, go away!

150
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:15,166
Thanks for bringing
it out to me.

151
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:16,875
Is something wrong?

152
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,166
Well...

153
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,416
A girl came here to
ask me to tell a fortune.

154
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:25,875
What's up?

155
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,708
I want to go out
for a little awhile.

156
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,583
The girl was nice and
she just wanted me

157
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,833
to help cheer up
someone who's sick...

158
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,666
Besides, this could
be the last time

159
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,833
I get to tell fortunes for
people in this village...

160
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,791
I understand...

161
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,916
but if it's okay
I'll come with you.

162
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:49,458
Stupid exorcist,

163
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:52,500
now I have to come up
with another plan...

164
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:10,250
Princess Ariel,
did you want something?

165
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,291
My nails need polishing.

166
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:13,583
Yes, ma'am.

167
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,000
I was surprised

168
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:19,875
when Father brought me
a proposal of marriage...

169
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,375
He seems to be very
pleased by the whole thing,

170
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,666
so of course, I'll obey him.

171
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,333
Congratulations.

172
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,041
Well, you'll be coming with me!

173
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,041
What?

174
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,333
It's an order...

175
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:32,625
From now on wherever
I go I'll always want you

176
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,625
to be there with me.

177
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:35,583
Yes, ma'am...

178
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,458
You're very good to me, ma'am...

179
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:40,375
I'll always be happy
to serve you, Princess.

180
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:42,041
Sweet Princess...

181
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:44,583
she trusted her maid
with all her heart

182
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,208
and was understandably upset

183
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:49,791
when the girl
suddenly fell terribly ill...

184
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,666
No, remember,
I ordered you to stay

185
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,333
by my side for the
rest of my life...!

186
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:57,791
You can't go.

187
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:00,458
You're the only person in
the whole world I can trust!

188
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,041
The heartbroken Princess decided

189
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:05,125
to make a contract with me,
the Millennium Earl

190
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:08,208
to bring the poor
girl back to life.

191
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:11,708
I won't do it,
I won't let you die!

192
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,208
Please forgive me...

193
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:15,541
I'm sorry, my Princess.

194
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,583
I wanted to serve you

195
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:20,291
and devote myself
to you always...

196
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:23,875
I wanted to... to...

197
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:31,041
I don't understand.

198
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:36,500
Why do I feel so much pain
when I see my own face...?

199
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,375
I just want to be able
to dedicate myself

200
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:42,291
to Madame Lulu Bell, and
devote myself to her wishes!

201
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:44,000
Are you sure this
is what she told you?

202
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,083
Think so...

203
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:47,500
So the little brat
came after all...

204
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,875
It's you...

205
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:56,916
Why don't I go ahead
and relieve you

206
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,500
of that Innocence
before the others get here?

207
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:11,041
Mei Ling, stay back!

208
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:12,833
Okay!

209
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,250
Stop interfering!

210
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,750
Lenalee, dodge to the right!

211
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,875
Hey, that was great,
thanks Mei Ling!

212
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,166
Activate!

213
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,916
So you think you're tough!

214
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,916
Watch your right...

215
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,375
Look out behind you!

216
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,458
Who do you think you are?!

217
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:50,083
Mei Ling, don't
push it too hard!

218
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,500
Don't worry about me.

219
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,000
Just watch out
for the next attack,

220
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,791
it's coming from your left!

221
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:00,083
That girl is
reading my attacks...

222
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,541
I can't fight like this!

223
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,583
I swear on Madame
Lulu Bell's bell...

224
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,708
that I will not retreat!

225
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:13,833
I'll do everything in my power
to bring victory to my mistress!

226
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:38,000
Lenalee!

227
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,791
Stay back...! I mean it!

228
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:40,583
But I--

229
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:41,458
Get outta here right now!

230
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,500
Oh, she's not going anywhere!

231
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:24,791
Oh no...

232
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,500
Come on, I think
we should hurry!

233
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,125
Outta my way!

234
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:39,875
I won't allow you to stop me...!

235
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:41,208
I'll be taking the
Innocence back

236
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,458
to Madame Lulu Bell
no matter what!

237
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,250
Lulu Bell?

238
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:25,083
Allen... Krory...

239
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,666
You see... for my
mistress I can muster

240
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,583
all the strength
I need to defeat you...!

241
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,666
I can do anything for her!

242
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:37,500
Damn... she's strong...

243
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,125
Hey, you guys!

244
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:42,416
I made it!

245
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:47,416
Big Hammer... grow, grow, grow!

246
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,666
Here's another one!

247
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,666
Help me Mistress...

248
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:17,458
Are you okay?

249
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,708
She's gone.

250
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:46,416
Oh, my mistress!

251
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,125
Was it you...?

252
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,375
Were you the one that
saved me, Madame?

253
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:54,625
I thought I said that you
must remember when to retreat.

254
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,541
Oh, yes, ma'am...

255
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,916
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

256
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,625
However... now I've seen
a clear demonstration

257
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:05,166
of the new Innocence's power
and how it could threaten us.

258
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:16,958
Oh Mei Ling, are you
sure you weren't hurt?

259
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:19,041
We're so glad you're alright!

260
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:22,625
I'm sorry I wasn't
more helpful to you.

261
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,041
Stop it...

262
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:26,500
Believe me, you have
an amazing ability there,

263
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:28,916
to be able to foresee
attacks is huge...

264
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,250
We should really be
thanking you, y'know.

265
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,250
You mean it?

266
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,916
Mei Ling's Innocence does
hold a very special power...

267
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,416
I'm sure it's being
reported to the Earl...

268
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,666
And they'll be coming
back to destroy it.

269
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,916
We need to leave the
village as soon as possible.

270
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,166
I think that would be wise.

271
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,833
But remember, Mei Ling's
going-away party

272
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,791
is about to begin.

273
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,208
We should go...

274
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:54,208
Because if I stay here
any longer the Akuma

275
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:56,875
might come and the
villagers could get hurt.

276
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:58,333
Your right...

277
00:17:58,416 --> 00:17:59,583
I'll see you again.

278
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:01,333
I'm going away to
become an Exorcist

279
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,166
so I can protect you someday...

280
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,000
Just like Lenalee, Allen,
and the others have...

281
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:09,875
Precious girl...

282
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:12,333
I know you're going
to be wonderful.

283
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:13,833
Grandfather...

284
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:17,500
Now make me happy by leaving
and taking your chosen path.

285
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:18,916
Okay!

286
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,458
I'm sorry...

287
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:32,125
Madame Lulu Bell...

288
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,166
I'm sorry...

289
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:46,083
Welcome, Master...

290
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,875
The new Innocence appears

291
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:51,166
to be quite a
bother, doesn't it...?

292
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,625
Of course it has
to be destroyed.

293
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:57,291
I know you'll be able to
accomplish it, my dear.

294
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:58,666
Yes, Master.

295
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,958
Ah... good girl...

296
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,500
Let me give you some help!

297
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:11,166
Take them and
use them as you will.

298
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,750
Thank you...

299
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,833
I swear to you I'll find a way
to destroy this Innocence...

300
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,916
If the girl can
foresee our attacks...

301
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,083
there has to be a way
to turn it against them...

302
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:37,708
Madame Lulu Bell?

303
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:46,291
My mistress is leaving...

304
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:48,583
She's leaving me behind...

305
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:19,541
Is something wrong, Mei Ling?

306
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,416
Everyone is badly hurt.

307
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,458
There's going to
be a terrible battle.

308
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,458
Mei Ling!

309
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:56,041
Madame Lulu Bell...

310
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,458
I'm coming to help you.

311
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:41,958
Dark forces want to
destroy the new Innocence

312
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:44,000
and its power to see
into the future...

313
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:47,458
and Mimi risks everything
to battle beside Lulu Bell.

314
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:52,791
Next time on D. Gray-man:
"Feelings of Devotion."

315
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:56,291
Bring forth salvation to
this tormented Akuma's soul!
