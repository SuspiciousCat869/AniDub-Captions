1
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:46,083
Mana...

2
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:50,166
Do you remember the last time I
couldn't see out of my left eye?

3
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,416
I decided that even if
I lost that ability forever,

4
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,750
I'd still grow up strong and
train to join the Black Order...

5
00:01:57,916 --> 00:01:59,583
Just like an exorcist...

6
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:01,541
I will be prepared...

7
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:03,916
Mana!

8
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,208
Now Allen...
you must go deeper...

9
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:11,958
...into the realm of
black... and white.

10
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:31,458
Thanks Mana.

11
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:33,791
Your eye is finally healed.

12
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:35,083
That's right...

13
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:38,125
I take back what
I said before...

14
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:41,000
I do have reason to fight now.

15
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,000
What a shame...

16
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:02,958
I guess you figured
me out... huh?

17
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:06,958
This bite?
It's probably gonna scar...

18
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:09,291
Thanks for pointing that out.

19
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:13,083
And now my outfit
is ripped to shreds.

20
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:14,583
That's your fault
since you transformed

21
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:17,083
into the Akuma I saw last night.

22
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,458
I told you not to set
foot in this castle...

23
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:23,500
But like a fool
you defied me anyway.

24
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:24,583
What are you waiting for?

25
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:26,666
Are you going to
transform or not...?

26
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,875
Don't you want to be in
your true Akuma appearance?

27
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,750
As far as I'm concerned
this is my true form...

28
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:34,541
And if it were up to me I'd
look like a human forever.

29
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:38,541
My Akuma form is...
hideous and gross!

30
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:40,500
I agree with you.

31
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,041
Now... I've got a headache;

32
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:45,875
let's call a truce and
go our separate ways.

33
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:47,541
Can't do that.

34
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:50,083
Then you're a fool.

35
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:06,958
You are such a cute
little thing... Exorcist...

36
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:10,250
So cute I think I will...

37
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,958
EAT YOU!!!

38
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:15,458
I don't think so.

39
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,166
This time when I hit
you, you stay down!

40
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,375
That's not good!

41
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,291
Uhh...

42
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:06,458
What's wrong?

43
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,625
Ah man.

44
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:23,625
Hey, Krory!

45
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:24,833
Are you okay?!

46
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:27,583
No... Not now...!

47
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:31,791
I need more power... more blood!

48
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:32,791
If only...

49
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,166
I had taken more from Eliade.

50
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,833
No Arystar...!

51
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:40,541
If you had sucked
any more of her blood,

52
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:43,458
you'd have killed
the love of your life!

53
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:46,375
Eliade!!

54
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,416
He must be having
a nervous breakdown...

55
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,416
Well... Not my problem.

56
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,708
I'm not here to hold his hand,

57
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:57,000
so lets take this
chance to pounce!

58
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,875
No hard feelings, Krory.

59
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,166
Innocence...

60
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,791
Level Two Release!

61
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,375
Stamp!

62
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:13,916
Fire circle!

63
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:23,166
Hellfire... Devouring...
Fire Stamp!

64
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:40,000
Don't worry, Krory...

65
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:42,000
That flame level wasn't lethal.

66
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:15,000
Thank you.

67
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,083
Hey, Allen.

68
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,541
You seem to be in
a bit of a hurry.

69
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:18,750
Appreciate the help, Lavi...

70
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:21,166
I think you may have
just saved my life.

71
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,666
Don't sweat it.

72
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:29,750
Arystar!

73
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:39,125
Convert!

74
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,833
Arystar!

75
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:43,041
Arystar, wake up!

76
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,000
Huh?

77
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,000
Wait... I think
I'm seeing things.

78
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,000
Allen...

79
00:07:57,083 --> 00:08:00,208
Is that gorgeous
woman an... Akuma?

80
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:00,958
What?

81
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:01,708
Yeah...

82
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,000
I can see it...

83
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,666
There's a human soul
standing right beside her.

84
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,916
No way!

85
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:21,125
So you... you can
see it too... Lavi?

86
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:22,583
Allen...

87
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:25,208
I'm afraid... I can...

88
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,500
Come back... Come back to me!

89
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:32,666
Please honey...

90
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,166
Please come back!

91
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm caught...

92
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,791
They've got me...

93
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,958
There is no escape...

94
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,000
I can't even breathe...

95
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,125
It's this woman's fault.

96
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,916
Welcome, young one.

97
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,791
Your fate now belongs to me.

98
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,958
Now, I order you
to kill this woman

99
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:58,041
and wear her body as your own.

100
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,166
What? You never
said I had to die!

101
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,541
No choice...

102
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,416
I have no choice...

103
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,333
Can't disobey...

104
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,458
Kill her...

105
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,291
Now!

106
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:30,708
This woman's words pulled
me back from the grave...

107
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:33,708
Her body became my own...

108
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:36,833
She certainly had a
figure worth admiring.

109
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,208
After transforming
into an Akuma,

110
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:43,583
I became a prolific killer...

111
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,458
...and it wasn't too
long before I evolved.

112
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:50,333
From then on,
I gained a sense of self,

113
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:53,041
and took interest
in other things...

114
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,416
Such as shopping, cosmetics,

115
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:00,208
dancing, parties, and
other extravagances...

116
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:03,291
I was now considered
attractive and desirable...

117
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,291
Men began to take notice,
throwing their

118
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:08,666
flirtatious advances
toward me at every turn.

119
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,708
Their looks were intoxicating.

120
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,916
But at the core
I was still an Akuma.

121
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,208
Killing became more of
an instinct then an act...

122
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,375
All of those men
who wished to be mine

123
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,833
became my victims
quite easily...

124
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,541
However, the effects
of killing made me ugly.

125
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:42,166
No longer was
I pretty... or desired...

126
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,250
It was then that I noticed,

127
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:48,333
that I could never truly
be a human being again...

128
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:51,166
I thought to myself...

129
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:55,375
"There's something
I want to try... just once...

130
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,125
I wouldn't be able
to live with myself

131
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:59,583
if I didn't at
least attempt it."

132
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:02,125
But it's an impossibility...

133
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,416
Because we are machines...

134
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,375
Programmed to slaughter humans.

135
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:28,541
It's me, Eliade.

136
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:30,166
I've been observing your skill

137
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,166
at deceiving and killing humans

138
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,416
and I must say it's
quite impressive...

139
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,875
Thank you, Lord.

140
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,208
Would he expect any less of me?

141
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:42,291
After all, he was responsible
for programming me

142
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:44,666
to behave that way...

143
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,375
You have an assignment...

144
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:49,541
There's a man that goes
by the name of Arystar Krory

145
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,833
who I'm suspicious of, and
I'd like you to investigate him.

146
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,833
Arystar... Krory?

147
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:57,250
There's a high probability
that he's been in contact

148
00:11:57,333 --> 00:12:01,041
with the Exorcist General
Cross, making him a threat...

149
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:02,541
You will have an
unlimited supply

150
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:06,375
of Level One Akuma at
your disposal, so use them.

151
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,000
Even if there's
nothing on Krory,

152
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:10,666
kill him anyway just
to be on the safe side.

153
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,250
Yes, Lord.

154
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,666
Lord Millennium, let's play!

155
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,791
Ahhh, Road...

156
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,291
I've been looking
for you everywhere!

157
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:17,583
My Lero's gone.

158
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:19,791
You didn't happen to
steal it again did ya?

159
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:21,000
Who cares?

160
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,666
Even if I did, you'd
still forgive me, right?

161
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,958
No no no no no!

162
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:25,833
You have it all
wrong, you little pest!

163
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:28,208
Stop being a big baby!
You'll get him back.

164
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:29,250
I need Lero at a
moment's notice...

165
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,208
The Earl never
treats me like that.

166
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,500
No matter how pretty I am,

167
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:36,250
I could never speak
with him so playfully...

168
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,666
He's simply not interested
in me like that...

169
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:42,416
Why...? Because I'm
just another Akuma,

170
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,666
an underling that exists
only to do his bidding.

171
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:51,333
That still doesn't stop me

172
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:54,083
from dressing nicely
and wearing makeup...

173
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,000
I want to be pretty...

174
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:58,583
It feels good.

175
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,958
I only wish to be desired...

176
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:04,000
Like a human...

177
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:08,166
I just want to be real woman.

178
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,791
Would you shut up...?!

179
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,583
I just need to fix my makeup...

180
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,500
I can't concentrate
if I don't look good!

181
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:14,833
We don't have time for breaks.

182
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:16,333
The Earl won't be pleased...

183
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:17,791
Just go on without me.

184
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,750
I'll catch up with you later.

185
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,541
Why can't they keep their
opinions to themselves...?

186
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:33,208
This is why I can't stand
dealing with Level One Akuma.

187
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:37,583
I will continue on my killing
spree, there's no denying that.

188
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:38,958
And even though the path I'm on

189
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:42,083
is not what
I would prefer to do,

190
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:45,958
I'll evolve more and more
with each murder I commit...

191
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:49,833
But what will happen when
my evolution is complete?

192
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:53,375
I like human men...
because they like me...

193
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,916
They give me attention and
I feel like a real woman,

194
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,916
like I'm alive.

195
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,041
But I also dislike human men,

196
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:04,166
because they break so easily...

197
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,291
They tend to die at the
slightest touch from an Akuma.

198
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:09,375
If they knew what
I really was...

199
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:12,708
They would look away in disgust.

200
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,958
Human men are so...

201
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,916
Why can't I move?

202
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm an Akuma, I should
be overpowering him!

203
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:34,041
Those fangs...

204
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:36,916
They're so sharp...

205
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,083
I have a bad feeling about this.

206
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:47,375
I'm going to die...
this is it...

207
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,833
...bitten by this stranger...

208
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:54,375
This man... has destroyed me.

209
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:04,166
I'm still alive.

210
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,250
I can't believe what I just did!

211
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:07,625
I attacked this girl!

212
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,375
I was sucking her blood!

213
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:13,875
What is wrong with me...?
I'm a monster!

214
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:20,125
You're still alive?

215
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,416
You had a chance to kill me.

216
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,791
Why didn't you?

217
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:26,500
I... I stopped once
I realized what I was doing...

218
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:30,541
I'm... just so...
weak, Eliade...

219
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:33,208
I'm sorry... Please...
Please forgive me!

220
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:40,250
The sight of those fangs...
made my skin crawl.

221
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:42,625
Despite how
dangerous they were...

222
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:46,583
I was oddly...
attracted to them...

223
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:49,291
...I craved more.

224
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,416
I found you!

225
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,541
What?

226
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:54,375
It's my turn this time.

227
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:08,041
That is how Arystar
Krory and I first met.

228
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,458
Our relationship is
anything but normal.

229
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:13,916
Arystar is a human, whose
body is the host for Innocence.

230
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,875
So naturally, he and
I are sworn enemies,

231
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,541
though in reality
we are far from it.

232
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:22,083
He is unique due to his
superhuman abilities achieved

233
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:24,583
when drinking blood from Akumas.

234
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,958
But the Innocence
coursing inside him

235
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:30,416
makes his thirst for
blood unquenchable.

236
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,958
Since the day we met,
he's restrained himself

237
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:37,166
from drinking my blood because
he doesn't want to kill me...

238
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:40,875
It's taken all of his
strength to do so.

239
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,416
And whenever the urge
to drink overwhelmed him,

240
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,958
he would attack my fellow Akuma,

241
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:48,958
who had infiltrated
the village below...

242
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,750
He would do that for my sake.

243
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:55,083
I didn't care who he attacked...

244
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:58,250
I was happy as long
as we could be together

245
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:03,416
in this castle...
for the rest of time.

246
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:08,416
Arystar, can you
hear me?! Arystar!

247
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:12,500
Hello Eliade.

248
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:17,791
How are you feeling my darling?

249
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:20,250
But... wait... Eliade, look...

250
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:21,625
Do you see that thing?

251
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:22,500
Huh?

252
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,750
It's right... above you...

253
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:28,583
It looks like it's
coming out of your body.

254
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:32,083
What is it?

255
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,833
That's the soul of the Akuma

256
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,875
who's holding the
body against its will

257
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:45,083
so it can use it
as a power source...

258
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:47,041
Does that sound about right?

259
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:48,291
This is nuts...

260
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:51,833
I can... see it...
with my own eyes.

261
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:53,000
Ya know, Allen...

262
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,500
It must have something
to do with yours'.

263
00:17:57,625 --> 00:18:01,458
My left eye has become...
more powerful...

264
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:05,291
Could Mana's curse have
increased my powers this much?

265
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,500
I don't understand how,

266
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:13,208
but other people are able to see
what only I could see before...

267
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:16,541
Which means...

268
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:19,208
Krory...! Do you
see the apparition

269
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:21,416
that is coming out
of your friend's body?

270
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,708
That is the soul of an Akuma...

271
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,041
Eliade is an Akuma!

272
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:29,250
She's an enemy to
both you and us!

273
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:32,791
Is that true, Eliade...?
Be honest...

274
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,791
Have you been deceiving me?

275
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,041
Are you an Akuma?

276
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,208
I...

277
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:41,291
I don't know what to say.

278
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:45,875
This blood...

279
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,875
Is it not... human blood?

280
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:54,083
I really wish that it didn't
have to come to this...

281
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:05,708
Oh no...

282
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,208
I was going to keep
you alive and use you,

283
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:17,750
but there's no
point to that now...

284
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:21,208
I will never allow you
to become an Exorcist...

285
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,500
That's why I have to kill you!

286
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,000
Not good...!

287
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,458
Fang boy can't defend himself
because he fought me earlier!

288
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:30,291
Fang boy?

289
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:31,333
Who is that?

290
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:33,250
Him...! Krory...

291
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,333
Flowers...?!

292
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,250
I thought we already got
rid of all these, Lavi!

293
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:48,375
Ah, looks like we need to
try a little harder, buddy...

294
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:49,958
There's too many of them!!

295
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,041
I don't care how pretty you
are or how good you smell,

296
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:56,666
I now officially hate flowers!

297
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,958
It looks like your
grandfather's precious flowers

298
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,916
have worked up an appetite...!

299
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,083
When I'm finished with you,

300
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:06,250
shall I feed your
body to them as well?

301
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:11,833
I loved you, Eliade.

302
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:15,291
I've loved you since the
moment I laid eyes on you...

303
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:16,625
But if I'm your enemy then,

304
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:19,250
why didn't you kill me
that day in the forest...

305
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:22,458
Rather than string
me along like this?

306
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:24,833
Like I said before,
I used you...

307
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:26,125
I needed you for something

308
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:28,708
I've been wanting to
do for a long time...

309
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:33,125
That's the only reason you're
still alive to this day.

310
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,500
Fine then...

311
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:37,291
I guess you've
made your choice...

312
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,291
Akuma.

313
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:46,416
I've a confession...

314
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,083
Eliade... I now yearn
for nothing more

315
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,958
than you drawing your
last dying breath...

316
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:58,291
So... We feel the
same way for each other.

317
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:00,166
We do.

318
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:40,625
Their feelings for each
other have reached

319
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:43,958
a boiling point as the fight
continues to rage on...

320
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:48,083
Once lovers, they are now
in a battle to the death.

321
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:52,125
Next time on D. Gray-man:
"The Vampire Whom I Loved."

322
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:56,166
Bring forth salvation to this
tormented Akuma's soul.
