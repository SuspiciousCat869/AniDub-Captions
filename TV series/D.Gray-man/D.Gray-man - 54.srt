We're gonna get
you out of there!

You deserted your friends.

And begged the Akuma
to spare you.

25
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:14,958
You betrayed the Innocence,
didn't you?

26
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:19,833
It was your decision. You chose
to become a Fallen One.

27
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,791
It's trying to kill him.

His Innocence is
trying to kill him.

You're going to stop. Right now!

We're going down.

you from the inside out!

You can't go on
like this for long.

will kill you!

those little humans. Ha, ha, ha!

So, what? Should all
of us move in on him?

[AKUMA D] Not yet. This is
starting to get interesting.

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,333
Yeah. Let's hang back and
see how this plays out.

100

We can go after him once

No matter what.

112
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,000
You're gonna get
out of this alive.

[panting]

114
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,291
What now?

115
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,125
I don't know!

116
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,666
Is it over? Did it stop?

117
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,500
Why isn't it attacking anymore?

118
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,166
[LENALEE]
Can you repeat that?

119
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,291
Are you saying there's no hope?

120
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:55,250
[KOMUI] Yes. Once someone
becomes a Fallen One,

121
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,333
they can't be saved.

122
00:09:57,416 --> 00:10:01,041
Suman... will not survive.

123
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
That's a lie.

124
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:41,416
[SUMAN] Help me. Please,
I don't wanna die!

125
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,916
[SUMAN groans]
Help me.

126
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:58,500
[SUMAN DARK roars]

127
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,541
[LENALEE]
I don't understand. Why?

128
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,333
[KOMUI] There isn't
anything anyone can do

129
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,875
once a person has
become a Fallen One.

130
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,833
Nothing can save them.

131
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:19,416
Nothing?

132
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,333
[KOMUI] There are only two ways
it can end for a Fallen One.

133
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,250
Either they keep destroying
until they use up

134
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,458
all their energy, and they die.

135
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:29,541
Or, they end up fighting with
something else, like an Akuma.

136
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,083
And it kills them.

137
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,500
In both scenarios the
result is the same.

138
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:36,125
A Fallen One cannot be saved.
It's impossible.

139
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:37,666
[LENALEE]
You're lying!

140
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:42,833
[KOMUI] No I'm not. Now calm
down and listen to me carefully.

141
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:46,458
What about Suman? What is
all of this Fallen One stuff?

142
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:50,875
It's bad. Innocence gone crazy,
and there's no cure.

143
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:54,875
When someone Falls, Innocence
takes control of their body...

144
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:57,541
...and destroys it.
Usually in less than a day.

145
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,541
[JOHNNY gasping]

146
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:00,916
Few know this.

147
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,833
Even the existence
of Fallen Ones

148
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,541
is a closely guarded secret.

149
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,833
But Suman. He's an Accommodator.

150
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:09,166
Why would his Innocence
do that to him?

151
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,500
Can't the order
help him somehow?

152
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:12,833
He and I...

153
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,833
Our rooms aren't that far
apart from one another.

154
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,458
So we're neighbors.

155
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:20,958
And sometimes he'd come over and
the two of us would play chess.

156
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,666
Right now I'm up,
38 games to 7.

157
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:27,541
My longest streak yet! He's,
uh, kind of a sore loser.

158
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,500
Didn't like that too much.

159
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,541
So when he saw me
in the mess hall,

160
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,875
sometimes he'd be
mad and ignore me.

161
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:37,166
But every time he came back
from one of his missions,

162
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,208
he'd come and see me
and start a new game.

163
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,375
Johnny...

164
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:44,166
[whimpers] I know we
weren't really friends.

165
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,583
He was just lonely.

166
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:49,208
The only thing he
wanted was company.

167
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:53,166
But even so,
what'll happen to him?

168
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:56,416
I told you. He's gonna die.

169
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,541
Once it's all over
and done with,

170
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:02,416
his Innocence will normalize and
return to its original state.

171
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,666
You must then collect
it quickly, Lenalee,

172
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,250
before the Akuma have the chance
to get their hands on it.

173
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,416
You can't be serious.

174
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,875
Komui?!

175
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:14,833
Are you suggesting we just
stand back and let him die?!

176
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:17,916
The Order wants you to
collect the Innocence.

177
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,666
That is your one
and only mission.

178
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,000
What if Suman's Innocence
is the Heart?

179
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:25,458
You understand what that means.

180
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,333
There are more important
things than one life.

181
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:29,625
But he's our friend!

182
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:30,916
[KOMUI]
Are you certain of that?

183
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,833
How do you know his
feelings haven't changed?

184
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,916
What are you trying to say?

185
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,083
This information is
still classified.

186
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:38,666
But there is a
strong possibility

187
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,791
that Suman betrayed the Order.

188
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:44,541
[sighs] I'm sure I don't need
to remind you of the incident

189
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,666
where over a hundred
Finders and Exorcists

190
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,333
were massacred while
in the line of duty.

191
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:51,208
[gasps]

192
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,291
Not long before it happened,

193
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:59,291
an Exorcist called in and asked
the Communication Section

194
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:01,708
about other agents
in the field.

195
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:04,416
He requested information
regarding active Finders

196
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,666
and Exorcists including their
locations and abilities.

197
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,166
[LENALEE gasps]

198
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,916
[KOMUI] Wireless Golems have
built-in security features.

199
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,250
They are assigned to
only one Exorcist.

200
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,750
If a Golem doesn't recognize
its owner's voiceprint,

201
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,875
it will block all
communications.

202
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,333
During the investigation,
we learned the Golem used

203
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:24,041
to contact headquarters
that day was Suman's.

204
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:27,000
Thus, we believe that
he made the call.

205
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,583
Most of the time,

206
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:31,541
Exorcists are away from branch
offices and out on assignment.

207
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,416
So it's not unusual
for them to call in

208
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,916
requesting backup
or an update.

209
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,375
Therefore, the Communication
Section gave the caller

210
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:39,750
the information he asked for

211
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,041
without checking
with Command first.

212
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:45,708
The attacks happened soon after.

213
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:49,291
No other Exorcist knew the
locations of all those killed.

214
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,375
But on the other hand,
we could be wrong.

215
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:52,958
Even if Suman had
the information,

216
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:55,208
we don't have proof he
gave it to the enemy.

217
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,833
But it remains possible
that he could have.

218
00:14:57,916 --> 00:14:59,666
Now that he's become
a Fallen One,

219
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,291
it seems to confirm
our suspicions

220
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,666
about his involvement.

221
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,541
This is his punishment
for his crimes.

222
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:09,583
Suman betrayed us.
He betrayed the will of God.

223
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,125
[LENALEE] You're lying!
I don't believe you!

224
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:20,083
[cries] That's a lie.
You're wrong.

225
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,125
It's not true.

226
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:27,708
[ALLEN]
Suman, stop!

227
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:51,125
Stop this mindless destruction!

228
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:54,666
Please, Suman! Don't let
the Innocence control you!

229
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,791
[roars]

230
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:15,416
Listen to me!
I felt what you felt!

231
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,875
I know how badly
you wanted to live!

232
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,500
I know you loved someone!

233
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,500
I know you wanted
to go home to her!

234
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,041
[gasps]

235
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:29,375
[SUMAN DARK gasping]

236
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:32,000
[ALLEN] I saw a little
girl in your memories.

237
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:35,458
That's your daughter, isn't it?

238
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,916
I saw when you had
to say goodbye to her.

239
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,541
It was the last time
you were with her

240
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:42,250
before you left
to join the Order.

241
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:51,666
Someone help me.
Help me, please!

242
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:57,791
[ALLEN] I know that you never
wanted to join the Order!

243
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:01,875
I know you never wanted
to be an Exorcist!

244
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,291
[ALLEN]
But your little girl was sick.

245
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:17,500
And you needed money to pay
for her doctors and medicine.

246
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:21,291
So you became an
Exorcist to save her.

247
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:30,291
There's no shame in
not wanting to die!

248
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:33,000
Even though you left your family
believing you'd never see them,

249
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,916
you clung to the hope
that it might be possible!

250
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,958
And in the face of death
you missed them so much

251
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:40,875
you were willing to do anything!

252
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:53,166
[SUMAN]
Let me live. I beg you.

253
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,916
Please don't kill me.

254
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,208
I'll do anything you ask
if you spare my life.

255
00:17:57,291 --> 00:18:01,125
I don't care what. Anything.
You hear me? Anything!

256
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,708
I don't wanna die!

257
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:10,541
I miss my family.
Desperately. I wanna go home!

258
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:13,500
Even though you surrendered.
Even though you gave up.

259
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,583
Even though you sold your soul!

260
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:19,083
In spite of it all, I know
that you still wanted to live.

261
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,000
Didn't you?!

262
00:18:56,166 --> 00:19:00,625

[screaming]

264
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,916
[ALLEN]
He can't go on like this.

265
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,666
His Innocence is killing him.

266
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:30,625
I have no choice. I have
to separate him from it.

267
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:35,041
[ALLEN]
There's no other way.

268
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:37,375
He'll lose his arm, but
at least he won't die.

269
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:39,875
It's the only choice.

270
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:43,958
I believe he would want this.
Above all else he wants to live!

271
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:46,333
So it has to be done!

272
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:54,041
Here we go. Innocence, Activate!

[ALLEN] Suman continues
to rain down destruction

00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,791
while his body falls apart.

He's on the brink
of losing his life.

If I intend to save him,

283
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:21,375
I'm going to have to try
something different.

284

Next time on <i>D.Gray-man</i> :

Jerry. Jerry! Did ya hear?

The Order said
they're gonna hold

00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:35,083
a wanko soba eating contest!

291
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:37,500
And I figure if I wanna win it,
I better start practicing now.

292
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:39,166
So give me all
the soba you've got.

293
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:42,458
That's right, all of it!
I'm gonna eat it all by myself.

Hey, short stack.

Hm? I know Kanda loves soba,

296
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:47,875
but you can make him
something else, right?
