Well, so serious.

You know what you remind
me of? A white face clown,

time to begin your journey.

starting to collapse.

and will be absorbed into
the gulf between dimensions.

Or to put it into terms simple
enough for you to understand:

You have three hours.

you'll cease to exist

vanish into nothingness!

And look on the bright side...

I'll do you a favor.

has to mourn your deaths

00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:06,416
You're so tired from
healing the others,

165
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,250
you weren't able
to heal yourself.

166
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,833
The best thing for you is to
stay here with the crewmen

167
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,916
and minimize your exhaustion.

168
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,375
In addition to helping us,

169
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:17,416
you're sending your powers
to those inside the Ark.

170
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,000
It's understandable that
you're feeling weak.

171
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,625
I'm failing you.

172
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,000
You're not.

173
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,333
We can't afford to let anything
happen to you child,

174
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:29,208
or the wounds Allen and the
others sustained will return.

175
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,208
I can feel them.

176
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,625
Allen and everyone else
within the Ark.

177
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:36,583
Their injuries are still
inside my Innocence.

178
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:39,291
At the very least, we know
they're still alive.

179
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:40,583
And yet...

180
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,583
One thing troubles me.

181
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:45,208
I'm not using my full
recovery power right now,

182
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:48,250
which maintains everyone
at their optimal state.

183
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:52,291
The power I'm using only takes
away injuries from the past.

184
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:55,666
Which means any new damage
they sustain won't heal.

185
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,666
I should've pushed myself.

186
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:01,333
I should've used my full
recovery power.

187
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:08,583
[ALLEN gasps]

188
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,291
[TYKI]
There is one way out.

189
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:13,708
Remember me? [chuckles]

190
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,500
[ALLEN gasping]

191
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:22,083
Heh.

192
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:24,333
Uh. Yeah. But...

193
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:26,000
If you let me use
it as collateral,

194
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,416
I'll play some hands.
If I win, I get his stuff back.

195
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,791
Allen! Hold up!

196
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:30,875
You sure about this?

197
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:34,125
[TYKI laughs]
Deal.

198
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:35,375
[ALLEN]
I call!

199
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,333
[laughs]

200
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,333
[ALL]
A freakin' royal straight flush?

201
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:41,041
Gimme a break!

202
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:44,458
Ah! Screw this game!

203
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,666
Catch!

204
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,166
They're yours!

205
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:53,083
Consider it a token
of my thanks!

206
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,416
[ALL]
You're the nerdy glasses guy!

207
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,583
What? You seriously
call me that?

208
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:59,041
What the...? Why are you...?

209
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,666
How did you get in here?

210
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,291
It's kinda a long story.

211
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:02,916
[KANDA]
Hey.

212
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,250
[ALL gasping]

213
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:07,500
Careful. This guy's
oozing with bloodlust.

214
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:09,875
So. How about it, boy?

215
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:10,875
[ALLEN]
Huh?

216
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:13,791
[TYKI]
Tell me why you won't die.

217
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:16,791
[ALLEN groaning]

218
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:20,208
I had to endure a lot of
ridicule because of you.

219
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:22,625
Even from the Earl himself.

220
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,500
[ALLEN]
What? You're crazy!

221
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:27,041
Who are y--?

222
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:42,500
[TYKI]
Heh.

223
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,208
[ALL gasp]

224
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:46,958
[TYKI] Are you still
looking for a way out?

225
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:50,083
'Cause I might know of one.

226
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,875
[gasps]

227
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:58,666
[ALLEN grunts]

228
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,333
[TYKI chuckles]

229
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,291
[growls]

230
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:06,375
The Ark is no longer capable
of providing exits.

231
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:12,041
But perhaps, if we were to use
Road's power, we could make one.

232
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,875
That door just appeared
from out of the ground!

233
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:18,916
[gasps]

234
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,041
[LERO]
Lero? This door is familiar.

235
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:23,666
It belongs to Mistress Road!

236
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,958
Out of all the Noah,

237
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,916
Road's the only one
with the ability to move

238
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,708
between dimensions without
having to rely on the Ark.

239
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,250
So, how about we continue
our little game?

240
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,541
I'll wager the exit,

241
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,750
and you'll bet using the
only thing you have...

242
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,125
...your lives.

243
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:39,500
But this time,
there's no cheating.

244
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:41,083
Do we have a deal?

245
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:42,416
[ALLEN gasps]

246
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,791
[LERO] Tyki! What do you
think you're doing, Lero?

247
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:46,375
You know the Earl
never said you could!

248
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:48,541
[TYKI] Here's the key
that opens Road's door,

249
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:50,791
and the three doors
that lead to it.

250
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:54,458
And it can be yours.

251
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:55,625
Think it over.

252
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,250
But don't take too long.

253
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:00,458
After all, time's
not on your side.

254
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,250
[ALL grunt]

255
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,750
[LERO]
Tyki!

256
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:12,125
The tower fell on top him!
He must be completely flattened!

257
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:13,916
[KANDA grunts]

258
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:23,916
[TYKI] There's no game I enjoy
more than hunting Exorcists.

259
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,833
[LERO]
Lero...

260
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:27,208
[TYKI]
Only seems fair

261
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:30,083
I place the exit at the
highest point in the Ark.

262
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:32,625
If you make it there before
everything collapses,

263
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:33,916
you win your freedom.

264
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,833
[ALLEN] From what I hear,
Noah's are immortal.

265
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:37,833
In my book, that's
called cheating.

266
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:42,916
[TYKI laughs]
You heard wrong, boy.

267
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,125
I don't know how these
stories get started,

268
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,541
but let me set the
record straight...

269
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:49,750
...we're as human
as the rest of you.

270
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:52,500
We only appear immortal.

271
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:55,916
It's easy to confuse us with
gods when you're so weak.

272
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,541
[ALLEN growls]

275

[KANDA]
We have to get moving!

00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:05,458

[LENALEE panting, screaming]

00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:14,291
Someone help her!

279
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:20,416
Hold on tight!
We're getting out of here!

[ALL panting]

281
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:37,083
[LAVI]
So, what's the plan?

282
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:40,458
According to the Earl, this
place disappears in three hours.

283
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:42,500
If he's telling the truth,
all we're accomplishing

284
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,875
with running is delaying
the inevitable.

285
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,916
[LERO]
Actually, you have two hours.

286
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,708
Whichever way you
split it, we're doomed!

287
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:52,833
Lenalee and I have both
witnessed Road teleport before.

288
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:55,083
She can move between dimensions.

289
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,583
True...

290
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,208
[inaudible]

291
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,166
We shouldn't trust Tyki.

292
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,708
But using the door to escape
does seem feasible.

293
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:08,958
The way I see it,
there's two possibilities.

294
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:12,458
Road's door is probably a trap,
but on the other hand...

295
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:15,708
...it might be our only
way out of the Ark.

296
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:18,500
[sighs] We really don't
have any choice.

[GROUP]
Rock! Paper! Scissors!

00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:44,625
Do we feel okay about this door?

300
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,625
Honestly, I don't think
it really matters.

00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,333
[LENALEE, KRORY]
Mm.

Wherever we are,

I don't think we've
left the Ark.

You're sure?

326
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,583
This guy's been after
my General for awhile.

327
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,583
It's not our first encounter.

328
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:24,666
There's no way we're gonna leave
you here by yourself, Kanda.

329
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,083
[KANDA]
Don't get the wrong idea.

330
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:27,791
[BOTH gasp]

331
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,833
[KANDA]
The reason I'm staying

332
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:32,250
is not for your sakes.

333
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:36,375
I told you this thing's
after General Tiedoll.

334
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:40,541
[KANDA]
It's my duty to take him down.

335
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:43,708

336

[ALLEN] The Noah Skinn
Bolic changes his form

337
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:38,750
and is able to wield powerful
lightning attacks.

338
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:40,916
Facing off against him is Kanda.

339
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,916
The swordsman stands silent.

340
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,541
Mugen held at the ready.

341
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:47,708
On the next <i>D.Gray-man</i> :

342
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:49,583
"The Skinn Bolic Room!"

343
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:52,958
Bring salvation to this
poor Akuma's soul.
