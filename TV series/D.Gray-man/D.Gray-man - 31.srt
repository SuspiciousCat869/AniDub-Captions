1
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:48,916
What in the world...

2
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:54,250
I'm sorry everyone...

3
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:56,583
Excuse me...

4
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:57,333
Goodness...

5
00:01:57,416 --> 00:01:58,583
Tag, you're it!

6
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:11,583
I'm so sorry about this...

7
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:13,250
Please say you'll forgive me.

8
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:26,125
Oh don't tell me I'm lost...

9
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:29,250
Where is the Black Order?

10
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:37,041
What...? We were expecting
Miranda hours ago.

11
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:38,541
Well, she is quite late.

12
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,208
It has been awhile since
the Finder was on her trail.

13
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:42,916
It could be cause for concern.

14
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,416
Lenalee, now that you're back,

15
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,041
why don't we sit down together,
have some cake and relax?

16
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,041
Toma...

17
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:51,458
Does she even know
where the Order is?

18
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:54,000
We gave her a map with
outlined instructions...

19
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:55,291
Based on the information
we've received

20
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,458
from Finders who've
spotted her in the area...

21
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:59,625
I've canvassed all
these regions here,

22
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:02,166
unfortunately,
I've come up empty.

23
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,458
That poor woman
is all turned around.

24
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,375
Guys... This is a world map...

25
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:08,458
She can't get anymore lost.

26
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:10,041
What's going on in the world?

27
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:13,208
Is it just me or have lots of
people been getting lost lately?

28
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:18,500
Now I'm worried...

29
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:19,666
It could take her
upwards of a year

30
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,791
to find the Order
at such a slow pace...

31
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,375
It sounds hopeless.

32
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:24,625
Tell you what...

33
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:27,166
I'll go see if
I can track her down.

34
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,083
Wait...! You don't have
to leave now, do you...?!

35
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,416
You haven't even had any cake!

36
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,208
I made it just for you!

37
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:40,583
I'll never reach the
Black Order at this rate.

38
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,666
I left my hometown
to become an Exorcist,

39
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,708
but I don't even think I could
find my way back there...

40
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,375
I guess life could be worse.

41
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:58,500
At least I don't have to repeat

42
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,916
the same day over
and over anymore...

43
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,083
I hope I don't have

44
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:05,416
to keep wandering
forever until I'm dead!

45
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:12,625
Maybe I should ask that
man for directions... but...

46
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:15,625
Don't talk about the following:
the Black Order and Innocence,

47
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,291
whether you're about
to become an Exorcist,

48
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:20,291
and anything having to do
with an official assignment.

49
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:21,291
That's right.

50
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,375
I need to find the
Order on my own.

51
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:27,416
It's the first test of the job;
don't screw it up, Miranda!

52
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:28,666
Watch it, lady!

53
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:32,458
Oh... I'm sorry.

54
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,958
My wallet's gone!

55
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:40,750
Stop him...! Pickpocket!

56
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:53,666
Lady, are you alright?

57
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,500
You fell down.

58
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:03,750
This is the first time I've
traveled outside my home town...

59
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,791
Unfortunately I don't
know left from right...

60
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:06,875
I'm sorry.

61
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,875
Oh, don't worry about it...

62
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,916
We're heading in
practically the same direction

63
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,708
you are so it's no big deal.

64
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,416
We're leaving London
just like you are.

65
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,916
We hope we can find a simpler
life out in the country.

66
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,791
Yeah...

67
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:20,041
Right, mommy...? Right daddy?

68
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:21,958
That is right, honey.

69
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:24,458
I'm sorry to hear about
your troubles in our city...

70
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:27,333
Getting lost and robbed in
the same day isn't fun at all...

71
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:28,541
Well, uh...

72
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:29,833
No, not really...

73
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,458
I'm used to feeling this way.

74
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,708
Heck a group of kids
made a song for me...

75
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:37,083
It went Miranda, Miranda...

76
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,333
She is the bringer
of such bad luck...

77
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:43,041
Full of doom and gloom and
misery, what an ugly duck...!

78
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:44,500
Looking for a job today,

79
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:47,333
who even cares, you'll
just get chucked...!

80
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:48,333
Like that.

81
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:50,083
Why, that's terrible, Miss.

82
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:52,750
You've had a tough life
for someone your age.

83
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,708
It's not... that bad.

84
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:59,250
So uh... what's
the big clock for?

85
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:02,625
Oh, well it's my
prized possession.

86
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:05,500
And, I wouldn't give
it up for anything...

87
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:08,333
I guess that thing's really
important to you, huh?

88
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:09,333
It is...

89
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,333
Although I also
use it for my job.

90
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:12,541
What's your job?

91
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:16,083
I'm really sorry but...
I can't tell you...

92
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:17,833
Is it a secret job?

93
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:20,750
Kids! Stop nosing
around in her business.

94
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,666
You don't need to know
every single detail.

95
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,458
That especially applies to you
because I've seen you do things

96
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:27,333
you could never tell
the children about.

97
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:28,916
What on earth are
you talking about?

98
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,166
That's a bold lie
and you know it!

99
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:35,166
I feel lucky to have found
such nice people to be with.

100
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:39,500
Come one, come all, to the
Isabella and Gary Magic Show!

101
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:42,083
Don't miss the
greatest show on earth!

102
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:43,666
Hey, Guy... Anne...

103
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:47,916
You mind, I would like
to help if you'd... let me.

104
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,416
We've got it all
handled, Miranda.

105
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,625
You don't have to.

106
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:52,333
Yup.

107
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,875
Oh no... Your family has
been so generous...

108
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:57,500
The least I can do is
help out wherever I can.

109
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,750
Why don't you go take a
break for a little while.

110
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,625
No way, this is my job!

111
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:03,000
Then help Anne...

112
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,583
I just want to pass
out flyers for an hour.

113
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,083
I don't need your
help with work.

114
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:09,916
Come on Guy, just
for a few minutes...

115
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,583
I said no!

116
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,375
Miranda...!

117
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,833
Forget about the silly flyers.

118
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:21,166
I need your help
getting everything ready

119
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,500
for dinner tonight.

120
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:25,666
Right... I'm sorry.

121
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,500
Potatoes and carrots,
skinned cleaned

122
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,916
and ready to go on the stove.

123
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,375
Miranda, Miranda...

124
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:34,750
She is the bringer
of bad luuu...

125
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:39,916
Full of doom and gloom and
misery, what an ugly duck...!

126
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,833
Looking for a job today,

127
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:44,583
who even cares,
you'll just get chucked!

128
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:58,791
Miranda, Miranda... she is
the bringer of bad luck...

129
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:03,416
Looking for a job today...

130
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,125
Fire!

131
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:19,875
What's wrong?!

132
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:24,291
Miranda!

133
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:28,291
Oh no!

134
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,208
I'm so sorry!

135
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:36,291
It's Miranda Lotto, right...?

136
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,583
Well, just be... careful.

137
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:39,791
I will.

138
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,791
Well, I guess
that's about it then.

139
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,375
Oops, you dropped this.

140
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,500
What's this mark?

141
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:53,833
The Black Order?

142
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:54,708
Oh, yeah, sorry...

143
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:57,333
Please don't tell anyone else.

144
00:08:57,416 --> 00:09:01,708
Would you... happen to know
someone named Allen Walker?

145
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:08,958
I'm sorry, so you met Allen

146
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:10,833
when he was traveling
through town...

147
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,041
That's right...

148
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,541
He was on his way to
the Black Order place,

149
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,416
just like you are...

150
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,666
He looked suspicious,

151
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,250
so I questioned him on
a murder case I was on.

152
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,375
Does that mean you're
an Exorcist too?

153
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:30,500
Uh... Sort of.

154
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,291
I see.

155
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:35,708
Well, if you have a problem,
don't hesitate to contact me...

156
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:36,916
I can help.

157
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,666
Thank you, I appreciate it...

158
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,583
Miranda!

159
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:42,541
Miranda!

160
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:43,833
You doing better?

161
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:44,666
Oh yes...

162
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,208
I hope I didn't worry you.

163
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:49,208
Well then, hope you
all have a good night...

164
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:50,041
No worries.

165
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,458
We're just glad you're okay.

166
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,583
Not only did I fail to
help you, I ruined your dinner.

167
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:54,625
Don't be silly...

168
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:55,791
We have a job offer.

169
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,250
It's perfect for you,
if you want it.

170
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,333
Welcome and good evening
ladies and gentlemen!

171
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,083
What I'm about to show
you has never been

172
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:07,125
done before in
the history of man...

173
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:09,208
Skewering a woman alive!

174
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:13,000
I will pin her inside this box,

175
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,166
giving her no way to escape,
then stab the box with swords,

176
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,166
leaving her vulnerable
to mortal wounds.

177
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,291
Now any of you in the audience

178
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,625
who are faint of
heart should leave now.

179
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,166
This worked out perfectly...!

180
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,666
Gary's assistant just up and
quit on him a few days ago.

181
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,291
I wonder if she'll be okay.

182
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,500
I hope she'll be okay.

183
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,000
Without further ado...

184
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,375
Let us commence!

185
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:33,875
It's just magic...

186
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,250
Magic!

187
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,666
Magic, magic,
magic, magic, magic...

188
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:09,375
Welcome and good evening
ladies and gentlemen!

189
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:17,625
What I'm about to show you,
has never been done before...

190
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,000
Please help!

191
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:25,291
I'm so sorry,
please forgive me...

192
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:26,958
You know in my entire
life of performance,

193
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:29,916
I've never experienced a
show quite like that one...

194
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,250
It was stupendous...

195
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,583
So you're the reason
the show repeated itself...?

196
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,708
I take responsibility,

197
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:38,333
but it wasn't me,
it was the clock's fault.

198
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,291
Turning back the
hands of time...

199
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,958
What incredible magic...

200
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:43,250
It's something,

201
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,708
however everyone in
attendance, including us,

202
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,291
had no idea that it
was even happening.

203
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,083
Even though I trusted
you wouldn't hurt me,

204
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:51,875
I couldn't help myself...

205
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:52,916
I'm sorry.

206
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,375
No, don't be...

207
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:57,125
I shouldn't have said
anything in the first place.

208
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:59,791
You'll be heading off to
your real job tomorrow...

209
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,833
Don't let tonight get to you.

210
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:02,875
Good night!

211
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:04,250
Good night!

212
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,541
What's wrong?

213
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,583
I don't see how someone as big

214
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:14,291
of a mess as me
could even hold a job.

215
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:15,666
If it'd make you feel better,

216
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,500
you can always travel
with us for the time being.

217
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,791
The trick will help
you get over your fears.

218
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,166
Well... Will you?

219
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,166
Well will you?!

220
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,666
It's true...

221
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,500
I don't have the skills or the
willpower to become an Exorcist.

222
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:40,916
Maybe I should travel with this
family and be in their show...

223
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,625
What do you think?

224
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,375
What is it?!

225
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:56,916
Daddy... What's wrong?

226
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,791
Where's the Innocence?!

227
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,208
What Innocence?

228
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,333
No!

229
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:09,000
Yes...

230
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:23,708
Come on kids!

231
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:24,750
Get inside!

232
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,583
Please stop...!
Don't destroy my clock!

233
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:34,125
It's all I have!

234
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,583
Miranda?!

235
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:46,125
Hey, Miranda...! You are
an Exorcist, aren't you?!

236
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:50,291
Destroying Akuma
is your job, isn't it?!

237
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:53,125
I'm not officially
an Exorcist yet!

238
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:56,916
I can't fight back!

239
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,333
I don't even know how to!

240
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:01,458
I wish Allen and Lenalee
were here to help.

241
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,041
You are an Accommodator
of Innocence.

242
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:10,083
All Accommodators become
Exorcists and fight Akuma.

243
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,041
The only way I can help
myself and my friends

244
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,958
is to become an Exorcist
like I had planned...

245
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,541
So why am I hesitating?

246
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:31,750
But I'm not capable of
destroying Akuma yet!

247
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,583
If they're attacking
because of my Innocence,

248
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:36,708
then I can't just sit
here and cower in fear!

249
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:45,541
Akuma... Over here...!

250
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:48,083
I've got the Innocence!

251
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:48,833
Miranda!

252
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:49,958
Miranda!

253
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:58,166
Stop right there!

254
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:15,083
No... I can't...!

255
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,708
Shoot her! Right meow!

256
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,500
Looks like those Akuma are
trying to get your clock,

257
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:32,791
and if they are, you need
to leave it her and run...

258
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:34,083
I can't!

259
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,000
Hurry!

260
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,833
No...! I won't!

261
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:39,291
Look, if you don't come
with me you're gonna die!

262
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:40,875
I don't care!

263
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:47,416
I'm hit.

264
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,958
Are you okay?

265
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:53,083
Take my bicycle
and get out of here!

266
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:54,291
What about you...

267
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:56,250
You're gonna become
an Exorcist, right...?

268
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,333
Then you don't wanna
be killed here!

269
00:15:58,416 --> 00:15:59,916
Moa...

270
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,083
Miranda, go!

271
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:07,291
Here goes...
I hope this works...

272
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:11,208
Please activate...
My Innocence!!

273
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:52,958
One more time.

274
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:01,708
One more time.

275
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:09,458
I can't do this... anymore!

276
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,125
Lenalee!

277
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:27,333
Stay back!

278
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:37,833
Damn Exorcists!

279
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:04,125
You're safe now...
Are you okay?

280
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:07,750
I thought you
could use some help.

281
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,041
Thank you...

282
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:11,041
What's wrong?

283
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:13,666
I couldn't even find
my way to Headquarters.

284
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,916
You'll be fine.

285
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,333
You risked your own life

286
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:21,125
by drawing the Akuma's attention
away from everyone else.

287
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:24,500
With courage like that
you can be an Exorcist

288
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:27,125
and a good one too!

289
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:29,708
I agree completely...
believe me...

290
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:31,666
Thanks, Lenalee.

291
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:42,791
Thank you so much
for your hospitality.

292
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:45,625
I'm sorry for all
the trouble I caused...

293
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,708
You're really leaving?

294
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:50,000
It's hard to believe that
fighting those disgusting things

295
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:53,000
is what you do for a living.

296
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:55,666
You're right...
I know that now...

297
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,125
I will become an Exorcist.

298
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:02,666
It's probably the one thing
I'm destined to do with my life.

299
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,375
If there's anything I could
do to repay your kindness,

300
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:08,041
it would be to rid the
entire world of Akuma.

301
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:09,875
And to prevent honest
people like yourselves

302
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:12,708
from being put
in danger by them.

303
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:16,166
I really can't thank you enough.

304
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,000
And could you say
hello to Allen for me?

305
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:20,166
Moa!

306
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,333
No way! You know Allen?

307
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:25,708
She said he came
through this town once.

308
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,750
Yeah, Allen destroyed
Akuma while he was here,

309
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,708
and saved a lot of lives.

310
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:32,833
He also saved my sister's soul.

311
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:36,458
Good luck to you.

312
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:38,541
Thank you!

313
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:41,208
Maybe someday I can visit
as a full-fledged Exorcist,

314
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:43,500
just like Allen!

315
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,250
I hope I haven't caught a cold.

316
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,833
What...? Miranda still
hasn't arrived yet?

317
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:56,333
How could she have
gotten separated again?

318
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:58,000
While we were on our
way back we took a break,

319
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,958
and before we knew
it she was gone.

320
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:00,916
Mine...

321
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,791
Look there...

322
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:02,791
Wait a second...

323
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:05,166
Chief...! Found her...

324
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:07,416
Oh that's not good...

325
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,083
Wow...

326
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:12,041
I guess climbing a
massive cliff is part

327
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,458
of the test for
becoming an Exorcist...

328
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:15,458
Don't fall yet!

329
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:21,250
You're almost to
the top, Miranda!

330
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,000
Are you alright?

331
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,583
I'm sorry...

332
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:31,166
I can't do anything
right by myself.

333
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,541
Miranda, what made
you climb up that cliff?

334
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:34,500
Huh?

335
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,000
There's an entrance underground

336
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:40,416
from there you can take an
elevator all the way to the top.

337
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,250
Well you got here in one piece,
which is what matters...

338
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:44,375
Miss Lotto...

339
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,458
Welcome to the Black Order.

340
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:47,750
Thank you...!

341
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:51,000
Now I can really
become an Exorcist!

342
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:55,708
Stop it...!
I've changed my mind!

343
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:57,041
But how else do you expect us

344
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:59,250
to turn the Innocence
into a weapon?

345
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:00,666
Not my clock...!

346
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:04,083
I don't wanna become an
Exorcist anymore...! Stop it...

347
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,583
Lenalee!!!

348
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:40,166
I pass through a
port town in order

349
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,458
to cross the ocean
for an assignment...

350
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:45,041
I soon come to realize that
many of the ships in the port,

351
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:47,916
are being sunk by
an unknown assailant.

352
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,291
Next time on D. Gray-man:
"Mysterious Ghost Ship."

353
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:56,333
Bring forth salvation to this
tormented Akuma's soul.
