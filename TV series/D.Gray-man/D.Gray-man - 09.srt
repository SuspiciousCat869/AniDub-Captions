1
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,541
It's the exact same
newspaper again...!

2
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,041
Same articles...

3
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:08,708
Same pictures...

4
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:10,791
Same horoscope.

5
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:19,583
It's five minutes to eight...

6
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:20,416
Three...

7
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,625
Two...

8
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,000
Please no!

9
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:25,666
I didn't... mean it... honey...

10
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,125
How could you cheat on
me again with that woman?

11
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:30,000
How many days in a row
is that now, you bastard?!

12
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,041
How many years have
we been together?

13
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:31,791
No...

14
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:33,541
It can't be...

15
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:35,833
That makes it
thirty times now...

16
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:39,583
Thirty times in a row that we've
lived October twenty-eighth.

17
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:02,500
Miranda, Miranda,
she's all bad luck...

18
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,208
Full of doom, full of gloom.

19
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:06,583
What a dumb and ugly duck...!

20
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,208
Looking for a job today,

21
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,583
who cares, you'll
just get chucked!

22
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:15,625
Miranda, Miranda,
she's all bad luck...

23
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:17,208
Full of doom, full of gloom.

24
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:19,625
What a dumb and ugly duck...!

25
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:21,208
Looking for a job today,

26
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:23,416
who cares, you'll
just get chucked!

27
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:27,500
Our town is stuck on
October the twenty-eighth...

28
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:30,375
The repetition is maddening...

29
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:32,250
Nothing changes...

30
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,125
Not a single thing.

31
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:41,291
Is Innocence there?

32
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:42,291
Maybe...

33
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:43,291
Could be...

34
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:47,208
No, probably.

35
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:50,000
Okay, you know how
I just said probably...?

36
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:52,000
It's more like maybe...

37
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:55,416
Or not at all because I really
don't know, to be honest...

38
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,625
Or maybe I do know.

39
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:59,833
Who can say for sure?

40
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:02,833
So, I'm not sure I... follow.

41
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,875
And what's to
follow, my friend...?

42
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,375
Apparently there's
a place out there

43
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,541
that's being endlessly rewound.

44
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:11,125
What does that mean?

45
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,333
Let me explain...

46
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:15,791
It appears as if time
and space have come

47
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,625
to a standstill in the town...

48
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:20,333
Causing a single day
to endlessly repeat...

49
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,625
Reever, come here!

50
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,250
I'm coming.

51
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,291
Here's everything
we have so far...

52
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:27,958
We first heard about
this from a wholesaler

53
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:30,250
who supplies a
liquor store in town.

54
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,833
On October twenty-eighth,
he received an order

55
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:36,166
to deliver ten barrels of red
wine for October twenty-ninth.

56
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,541
He attempted the delivery,

57
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:40,125
but was physically incapable
of entering the town,

58
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:42,583
as if a force field
were stopping him.

59
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:43,750
Since then, he's received

60
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:46,750
the exact same order
verbatim--everyday.

61
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,708
Wow... That sounds spooky.

62
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:50,750
Hold on, let me
get this straight...

63
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,416
It's still October
twenty-eighth even though

64
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,541
its almost December
now...? How strange.

65
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,708
We'd like to
investigate this matter.

66
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:00,625
But our Finders are having
trouble entering the city...

67
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,125
And because of that...

68
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:04,541
everything else we
know is just theory.

69
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:05,625
First off...

70
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,333
If this phenomenon
is being triggered

71
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:08,958
by some form of Innocence...

72
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,625
then Exorcists who
contain Innocence

73
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:14,208
may have the ability to enter
the town where others haven't.

74
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,166
But... If the Order's
investigation

75
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,625
illustrates that
this town really

76
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:20,208
is stuck in a time vacuum
on October twenty-eighth...

77
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:21,916
It's quite possible
that you won't be able

78
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,333
to leave once you get inside.

79
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:27,208
The town's basically cut off
from the rest of the world.

80
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:31,000
Well what do you think...?

81
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,083
Shall we go?

82
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,750
Uh... Yeah sure.

83
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,750
Careful, Lenalee...

84
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,000
So long.

85
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:50,750
I've never heard of
anything like this before.

86
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:53,250
So your new life...
you like it?

87
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,750
Do you mean the jobs...?

88
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:57,041
Or how I'm living
with the Order now.

89
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:58,500
I guess both.

90
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,208
I'm still getting
used to the work.

91
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:03,291
But I'm starting to feel
at home at the Order...

92
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:06,375
It really does feel like
a family... ya know?

93
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:09,750
Everybody's been
really nice to me.

94
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,500
Well...

95
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:15,458
Except for one
person in particular.

96
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,333
That's nice...

97
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:17,583
I'm glad...

98
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:18,958
and as for me...

99
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,791
It took me quite a
while to get used to it.

100
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,375
What...?

101
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:24,833
I thought you joined the Order
with your brother Chief Komui.

102
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:28,041
No at first I was
all by myself...

103
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:31,583
You have no idea how happy
I was when my brother joined me.

104
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:32,833
I didn't leave his side

105
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:35,041
for at least the first
few months he was here.

106
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:38,125
I find that hard to believe!

107
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:41,125
LENALEE!!!

108
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:44,041
Yeah I'm not sure
what to do with him.

109
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,083
Toma.

110
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,833
I've been expecting you.

111
00:06:58,916 --> 00:06:59,708
Toma...

112
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:00,583
How are you?

113
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,125
Good, thanks.

114
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:04,625
So I take it you
haven't gotten inside yet.

115
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:05,916
Right.

116
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,250
That's as far as I can get...

117
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:11,875
Unfortunately the only
thing I know about

118
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:14,083
this town is the exterior wall.

119
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:17,125
It makes me wonder
if we'll be any different.

120
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:19,458
We won't know if we
don't give it a try.

121
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:21,750
Please be careful.

122
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:45,458
That was easier than I thought.

123
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:46,958
You're telling me.

124
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:49,250
I'm almost
disappointed in a way...

125
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:50,500
Now...

126
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,250
I wonder where the
Innocence could be hiding?

127
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,958
It's the exact same
newspaper again...!

128
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:03,833
Same articles...

129
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,208
Same pictures...

130
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,208
Same horoscope.

131
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,791
It's five minutes to eight...

132
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:16,666
Three...

133
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,708
Two...

134
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,416
Please no!

135
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,833
I didn't... mean it... honey...

136
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:22,291
How could you cheat on
me again with that woman?

137
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:25,166
How many days in a row
is that now, you bastard?!

138
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,208
How many years have
we been together?

139
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:27,375
No...

140
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,291
It's still happening...

141
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,250
That makes it
thirty-one times...

142
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:32,875
Thirty-one times in a row

143
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,583
that we've lived
October twenty-eighth.

144
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:45,583
How will I ever
escape this hell?

145
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,000
Why thank you...

146
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,208
Are you ready
for your cleaning...?

147
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,958
You're so sweet to comfort me.

148
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:07,541
What do you say we
split up and look for it?

149
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,416
We'll cover more
ground that way.

150
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,791
How about if we meet up at
that pub around lunchtime?

151
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,375
Sounds good.

152
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:22,291
Look...!

153
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:23,791
It's the bringer
of bad luck lady!

154
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,583
Yeah, there she is,
let's get her!

155
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:29,333
Nobody likes you,
nobody likes you...

156
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,666
Take this... witch!

157
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:33,083
No way...!

158
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,916
I can't believe she dodged it!

159
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,708
Heh...!

160
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:36,750
You know what kid,

161
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,125
it really isn't all
that hard to do

162
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,833
when you've had thirty
straight days of practice!

163
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:40,875
Huh?

164
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,250
Huh...?

165
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,041
I've never thrown that snake
at you in my whole life!

166
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,583
Peter...

167
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:48,083
You're gonna catch her bad luck
if you keep talking to her.

168
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:51,458
Miranda, Miranda,
she's all bad luck...

169
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:52,875
 Full of doom, full of gloom.

170
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,125
What a dumb and ugly duck...!

171
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:56,708
Looking for a job today,

172
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:59,208
who cares, you'll
just get chucked!

173
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:02,416
Look out...!

174
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,291
She's beaming us with bad luck!

175
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:07,458
RUN RUN!!

176
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,958
Those brats...

177
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,083
I don't understand.

178
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:16,250
Why can't anyone else
see what's happening?

179
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,625
I...

180
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:20,583
I don't know if I can handle
another day without sun.

181
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,625
As I exit the alley
a carriage will splash

182
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:35,041
muddy water all over me,
then I will go home... again.

183
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:43,208
Oh my God! This has
never happened before!

184
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:48,041
But where did this
monster come from?

185
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:53,250
Is today the day I die...?

186
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,958
Could it really be tomorrow?

187
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:57,041
Will my suffering end?

188
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:01,083
Where is the Innocence?

189
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:03,333
You will tell me.

190
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:05,375
I'd let go of her if I were you.

191
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:22,541
There's someone else
I've never seen before...!

192
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:25,333
Oh God, please tell
me I'm not dreaming.

193
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:26,291
It's true...!

194
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,958
I'm actually living tomorrow!!

195
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,458
Come back!

196
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,333
Today is the happiest
day of my life!

197
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:56,416
Why, do you ask?

198
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,250
Because it's not today,
it's tomorrow!

199
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:03,416
I think I spoke too soon.

200
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,291
That's him...!

201
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:12,666
He's the one who
changed everything.

202
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,333
You and I really need to talk!!!

203
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,583
Welcome members of my family...

204
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:32,125
Let us all find success in
our quest for Innocence.

205
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:34,166
I've provided a
plethora of Akuma

206
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,041
to choose from
and use as you see fit.

207
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,041
So we'll be hunting Innocence.

208
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,083
That's right!

209
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:41,875
I'm ready to let loose...

210
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:44,416
I bet it'll be so much fun...

211
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,666
I have other work to
finish before I start,

212
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,000
but let me know
if you need my help.

213
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:50,541
Then...

214
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,833
maybe I'll go ahead and start up
the celebration with a bang.

215
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,666
What's it supposed to be?

216
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:07,291
Excuse me.

217
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:09,083
Don't ignore what I asked...

218
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,125
How did you lose her, Allen?

219
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,416
She ran off before
I could stop her...

220
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,500
But look...

221
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,458
At least we know
what she looks like now.

222
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:18,541
I guess so.

223
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:20,875
We can use the
drawing to find her.

224
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:23,333
Is it...

225
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:24,500
Is it that bad?

226
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,875
Uhh... yeah.

227
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,500
If I had known this
was going to happen,

228
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:31,083
I would never have split
us up in the first place.

229
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:33,125
The Akuma you fought...

230
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:36,166
Are you positive that it
said Innocence to her?

231
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,208
Yeah.

232
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:38,166
Here you go.

233
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,875
Enjoy.

234
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:41,583
You're gonna eat all that?!

235
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:42,833
I'm gonna get started...

236
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:44,958
'Kay...? 'Kay.

237
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:51,958
That was delectable.

238
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:54,250
Wow, you actually did it.

239
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,083
So about that woman again...

240
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,625
She's the key...

241
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:00,333
I think she'll be able to lead
us right to the Innocence...

242
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,833
We're sure lucky I found her.

243
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,000
Yeah right...

244
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:07,791
So how are your
investigation's going?

245
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:10,708
It looks like my brother's
theory is correct after all...

246
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,333
so... right after I
split with you...

247
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:14,833
I attempted to leave the town.

248
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:20,333
When I walked through
the edge of the village,

249
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:22,833
it just spit me right back in.

250
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:25,166
So... it's just as we feared.

251
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,750
Now we're stuck
in this endless loop

252
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,791
of a town along with everyone
else until we find a solution.

253
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:32,750
That's why we need to
get the Innocence ASAP.

254
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,375
Innocence?

255
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:39,250
That's her, Lenalee!
She's the one!

256
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:46,125
Wait! I'm sorry I screamed!

257
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:47,750
You're Exorcists?

258
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:50,250
We are, but why are
you running away?

259
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,291
We're here to help you.

260
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:53,625
I'm sorry...

261
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,833
I've been through a lot lately.

262
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:01,208
Yeah, hello...?

263
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:02,666
I'd like to place an order

264
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,916
for ten barrels of red wine,
I need it tomorrow.

265
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
This must be the place
Reever was talking about.

266
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:12,208
So... my name is
Miranda Lotto...

267
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:13,666
And I'm alone...

268
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,708
But I'm happy to find people
who can see what I see...

269
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,083
Yes, umm...

270
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,041
I would mention it to people
but they would just mock me...

271
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:24,666
This last month's been so hard
that I've contemplated suicide.

272
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,583
But I've learned
that the only way

273
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:28,541
to stay alive is to
dodge the snake.

274
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:32,791
I think she's...
Lost her mind.

275
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:34,208
Miss Lotto, tell me...

276
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,000
You've been able to
see the abnormalities

277
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:38,333
that are happening
here everyday?

278
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:39,916
I have...

279
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,750
but it's as if, everyone else in
town has no idea it's happening.

280
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,625
Please you have
to help me out...

281
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:48,125
I can't stand this
insanity anymore!

282
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,583
You saved my life from that
evil monster back there...!

283
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,708
You've saved me once you can
save me again, can't you?!

284
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,541
You need to calm
down, Miranda...

285
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:58,916
We'll help, but we need
to work together on this.

286
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,500
That sounds really good.

287
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,041
Something must have happened on

288
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:04,458
the first October twenty-eighth
to trigger the repetition...

289
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:06,458
any idea of what it could be?

290
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:08,375
How many times do
I have to tell you people?

291
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:11,458
It's always October
twenty-eighth here!

292
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:15,208
What's wrong?

293
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,666
Do you see those men
at the bar, Miranda...?

294
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,166
They're the only people
in town that have noticed

295
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,541
you're different than
everyone else aside from us.

296
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:26,416
I realize why you're the only
one this time warp affects...

297
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,375
and why you can see
things others cannot see.

298
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:31,625
It's because you're the one
who's in contact with the

299
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:34,375
Innocence that is causing
all these abnormalities...

300
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:37,000
Which is why these
creatures are here.

301
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,500
Innocence activate!

302
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,208
Lenalee.

303
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,833
Get Miranda to safety
while I handle this.

304
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:13,958
Your Dark Boots are quicker

305
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,625
than anything these
Akuma can muster.

306
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:17,208
I'll meet up with you later!

307
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:20,458
Be careful Allen!

308
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,416
I'll come back to help
you as soon as I can.

309
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:35,083
All three of these
Akumas are level Twos.

310
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:40,833
I finally find the
person that can save me

311
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:43,875
from this hell
and now he's gone!!

312
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,458
So this is the rewinding town.

313
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,083
Lero, wait, don't do this...!

314
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,416
Leroleroleroooo!

315
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:22,791
Who was that?

316
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:32,625
And Road Kamelot makes
a stunning appearance.

317
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:39,166
Pang Voice!

318
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,125
Feels like my
head's... splitting!

319
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:03,958
Hotter than flame its, ICE FIRE!

320
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:07,833
If you come in
contact with it...

321
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:10,166
Flesh rots instantly...

322
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,708
You wanna try it?

323
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:14,791
Let's slice him up...!
Let me go first!

324
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,000
Lets me do it...!

325
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,208
It'll be funnier

326
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:20,000
if I use my voice 'cause
his head'll explode!

327
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,291
I will slice you to pieces!

328
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:24,750
I'll make you rot!

329
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,750
Your brain will be mush!

330
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:31,750
One two three Scissors...!

331
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,666
One two three Rock...!

332
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,416
One two three Paper...!

333
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,875
One two...

334
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:39,458
You play dirty...!

335
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:42,791
How dare you interrupt a
game of Rock, Paper, Scissors!

336
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,750
Do you expect me to just
sit around and wait?

337
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,458
We must crush the Exorcist!

338
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:48,125
Crush him to death!

339
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:50,833
Stop.

340
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:54,625
You three are
having too much fun...

341
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:55,875
Need I remind you

342
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:58,500
that the mission is to
search for Innocence?

343
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:05,291
Return.

344
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,958
What just happened?

345
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:21,000
Where'd they go?

346
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,833
That's... a good... question...

347
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:25,750
There was a big booming
voice in the sky...

348
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,500
and then they were gone.

349
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:29,125
A voice?

350
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:45,083
So you wanted to
speak with us, Road?

351
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:47,416
That is correct...

352
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,375
Never go behind my back and
have all the fun without me!

353
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,625
The boy...

354
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:55,791
He's the one who carries
the eye of the cursed...

355
00:20:55,875 --> 00:21:00,375
It makes me wonder what approach
I should take in his death.

356
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:41,333
Picking up on the scent
of the nearby Innocence,

357
00:22:41,416 --> 00:22:44,041
the mysterious young
girl Road arrives

358
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:47,625
in the Rewinding Town
to stake her claim.

359
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:49,500
On the next D. Gray-man:

360
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:52,041
"The Bad Luck
Woman's Innocence."

361
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:55,791
Bring forth salvation to this
tormented Akuma's soul.
