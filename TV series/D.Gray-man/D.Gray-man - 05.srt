1
00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:39,958
A fragment of Innocence was
discovered in southern Italy...

2
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:43,541
But we got word that an Akuma
is already en route to grab it.

3
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:45,458
You two will head
there immediately.

4
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:49,125
Destroy the enemy and secure
the Innocence at all costs.

5
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:51,083
According to the dossier
we're heading to...

6
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:53,833
the ancient city of Mater...

7
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:56,291
I think I remember reading
about this place once.

8
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:58,333
It's been in ruins for decades.

9
00:01:58,416 --> 00:01:59,750
Our target sounds interesting.

10
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:01,583
The Ghost of Mater...

11
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:03,208
I'm confused.

12
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:05,750
Innocence has altered
its own biology.

13
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:08,083
Of course it doesn't
happen overnight...

14
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:09,458
Most estimates
place the timeline

15
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:11,291
between Noah's
Flood and the present.

16
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:12,958
The one thing we
still can't figure out

17
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:15,791
is why Innocence is causing
the strange phenomena.

18
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:19,916
What the... There's two of me.

19
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,291
I copied you...

20
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:22,583
It was easy...

21
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:25,708
I even duplicated your power.

22
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:28,333
Look out, the Akuma
is right beside you!

23
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,416
Forgive me...

24
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,083
but I had to...

25
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:51,625
You are the doll...

26
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:54,000
The Ghost of Mater.

27
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:08,708
Hey... Hold on!

28
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:33,500
Stop this, tell me why
you're attacking us...

29
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,500
Come on, I'm no good fighting
against a cute girl like you.

30
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:50,500
Very soon Guzol will be dead...

31
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:54,250
Please don't take me
from him until he's gone.

32
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:57,833
I'll let you have my heart
just don't separate us!

33
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:05,708
Did you know that when there
were still people in Mater;

34
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:09,125
it used to be called
"the land forsaken by God"?

35
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:09,916
Yes...

36
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,458
I've heard of that.

37
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:14,458
Trying to escape the harsh
weather and the blazing sun...

38
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:17,250
the citizens began
to dig underground...

39
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:20,041
and they built living
spaces down in the earth.

40
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,208
They kept digging and
digging for years on end

41
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:25,125
until finally... one day...

42
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:26,583
they found something.

43
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,250
They were suffering
and in great despair...

44
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:42,541
and their city was slowly
dying around them.

45
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:45,791
They created a doll that
would bring them comfort,

46
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:48,708
that would help them to
forget those hard times...

47
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:51,291
even if just for a minute.

48
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:54,791
A doll... that would
sing and dance.

49
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:05,083
Even after the city went to
ruin hundreds of years later...

50
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:07,666
and there was no one
left to hear the song...

51
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:12,500
this doll kept on singing...
alone in the world.

52
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:14,708
Then one day...

53
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:18,125
a small child arrived in
the now abandoned town...

54
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,125
He had no family...

55
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:26,708
and had simply wandered around
until he discovered Mater.

56
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:36,000
Little boy... would you
like to hear a song?

57
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,583
Little boy...

58
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:43,125
would you like to hear a song?

59
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,375
It had been five hundred years

60
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:47,166
since Mater had
ceased to exist...

61
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,250
and it wasn't the first time

62
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:51,041
a human had
stumbled into the city.

63
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:54,208
I met five adults over
the years before he came...

64
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:57,166
but when I asked each of them
if they wanted to hear a song...

65
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,000
they all attacked me...

66
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:03,166
I thought the boy would
do the same thing.

67
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,250
I was just going to kill him
if he didn't accept me...

68
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:10,375
as I did to all of the
others before him.

69
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:11,625
Little boy...

70
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:14,541
would you like to hear a song?

71
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:17,250
I'm a doll created by humans...

72
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:18,958
and doing their bidding...

73
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:22,500
is the reason for my existence.

74
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:25,375
Please... let me sing for you!

75
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,541
Miss Ghost?

76
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:30,333
You would really sing
a song for me...?

77
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:33,416
No one has ever done
anything like that.

78
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,625
Miss... my name is Guzol...!

79
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:39,041
Please sing for me, oh please!

80
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:54,791
Just look...

81
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:57,416
Your hair is so
pretty now, Lala!

82
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,583
Lala?

83
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:01,208
Can I please call
you that, Miss Ghost?

84
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:08,125
Several decades have
passed since then...

85
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:10,750
and Guzol has stayed
with me all this time.

86
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:17,416
Oh, Guzol, are you alright?

87
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,666
Lala... stay by my side...

88
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,458
until the end...
and let me stop you...

89
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:28,000
with my own hands...
when I die.

90
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,625
Yes... Guzol...

91
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:33,583
I belong to you
and so does my fate.

92
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:36,625
He will soon be unable to move.

93
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:40,666
I can barely feel his heartbeat
as it grows weaker...

94
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,833
So please give us
a little longer...

95
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:45,750
Let me be here with him
until he passes on.

96
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,916
During the past
five hundred years...

97
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,541
since the city of
Mater became ruin...

98
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:54,125
Guzol has been the only
one who accepted me.

99
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,583
I promise I will gladly
hand my heart over

100
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,125
to you when he is gone...

101
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:01,791
if you will let me stay with him
as his doll until the end.

102
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:03,875
Please, I beg of you!

103
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:10,291
We can't.

104
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:14,250
You're asking us to wait around
until that old man dies...?

105
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:15,666
We don't have time for that--

106
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,750
we don't know when the
Akuma will discover us here.

107
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,000
Kanda!

108
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,916
What did we come here for?!

109
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,125
Get over there and take
that doll's heart short stack!

110
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,750
I can't.

111
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:41,583
I'm sorry...
but I don't want to take it.

112
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:43,208
Then take this--

113
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:46,458
that coat wasn't made to
be used as a damn pillow...!

114
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:49,250
It was to be worn
by an Exorcist!

115
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:58,041
Sacrifice is what leads
to salvation... hear me?

116
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,000
No, please don't
take it from me yet!

117
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:06,500
Please... not just yet...

118
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:07,416
Stop.

119
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,458
Let me be the one.

120
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:14,750
Step away from them and let me
become the sacrifice instead...

121
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,833
As far as I can see they just
want to choose the way

122
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:19,625
their lives end, nothing more.

123
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:21,166
And until that
happens I won't take

124
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,041
the Innocence from this doll...

125
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:24,416
If I destroy the
Akuma there should be

126
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,583
no problem honoring
their request...

127
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,583
How can you stand there
and be so cold blooded

128
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,125
towards these people?

129
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:31,500
Is this really worth--

130
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:37,250
Please--this won't
solve anything!

131
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,500
Your naïve outlook
is ridiculous...!

132
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,041
You'd compromise
yourself for others just

133
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,166
because you feel
sorry for them?!

134
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,375
Where is your pride?
Don't you cherish anything?!

135
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:48,500
Kanda you're wrong...

136
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,833
I don't feel sorry for them...

137
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,166
It's my pride that...

138
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,708
helps me stand up against
your anger right now.

139
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:56,916
I feel sorrow for them

140
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,541
because their bond will
soon be destroyed...

141
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:00,708
I mean, doesn't...

142
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:02,750
that mean anything to you...?

143
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,541
You know they don't
have much longer.

144
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,375
You'll still get the Innocence.

145
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:09,125
All they're asking for is time!

146
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,875
So I'll gladly offer
myself in their place

147
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:13,666
if you'll just let them be!

148
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,083
Guzol...

149
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,583
It's him.

150
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,458
I got the Innocence!

151
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:42,958
It's mine!!

152
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:49,333
La... la...

153
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:52,125
Lala...

154
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:56,666
My my...

155
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,583
It's more beautiful
than I dreamed!

156
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,041
Give it back...

157
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:18,791
Give the Innocence back...

158
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,666
Give it back!

159
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,541
Give the innocence back...

160
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,416
Right now.

161
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,500
You hear me?

162
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:38,333
His Anti-Akuma weapon
is transforming!

163
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,458
Yes, he's going
to rebuild it...!

164
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:42,166
Parasite Type
Exorcists can alter

165
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,083
their weapons with emotions.

166
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:47,708
Even the Innocence appears to
be reacting to his feelings...!

167
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,041
Amazing...

168
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,583
His emotions are
incredibly powerful...

169
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:55,541
His weapon is a manifestation
of his hatred towards the Akuma.

170
00:11:58,458 --> 00:11:59,708
Idiot...!

171
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:02,041
The weapon hasn't completed
it's formation yet!

172
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,208
What is that?!

173
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,250
It's a gun!

174
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:43,208
You can't hurt me with that
thing if I'm sand, can you?!

175
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:53,791
Comfy, right...?!

176
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:56,958
This is it...! While you die,
I keep the innocence!!

177
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:01,250
Mind if I help you
with dying??!

178
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,416
Oh no! Master Walker!

179
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,625
He's fine, Toma.

180
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:16,291
I'm still sensing
the kid's hatred.

181
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,458
He started shooting
from the inside!

182
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,708
I feel the Innocence
inside me doing all this...

183
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:38,333
firing my nerves and
directing my brain...

184
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,291
My brain controls my body

185
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:43,000
and teaches me a new
way to use my Weapon!

186
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:45,250
It changed... again!

187
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:56,541
Oh no...!

188
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:57,500
My skin...

189
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:58,458
The sand...

190
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,125
was...

191
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:01,666
Sand...

192
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,750
Sand!!

193
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,625
You're not going anywhere.

194
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,625
That much I promise you.

195
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:11,916
Don't forget I still
have your right arm!

196
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:28,041
Lala...

197
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,958
stay by my side...

198
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:31,541
until the end...

199
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,000
and let me stop you...

200
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:34,875
with my own hands...

201
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,000
when I die.

202
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,500
He loved her...

203
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,958
I won't let you get
away with this...

204
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:42,458
I won't!

205
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,416
Dammit...

206
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,541
I don't understand...

207
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,500
How can he be beating me...

208
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:57,166
We're using... the same arm?!

209
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,625
The kid has a limit...

210
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:01,166
It's changed its form,
but his anti-Akuma weapon

211
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,125
only has so much energy...

212
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,416
Only exorcists that
are fully synchronized

213
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,916
with their Innocence
can use their weapon

214
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
to its most
powerful potential...

215
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:13,833
Judging from what I've
seen--the boy isn't there yet...

216
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:31,500
Ow... damn...

217
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,125
A rebound...?!

218
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:36,125
Why isn't my body able
to handle this new weapon?

219
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:42,125
I win!

220
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:50,041
You're alive?!

221
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,083
Kanda!

222
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,208
Shut up, you wimp!

223
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,750
You're going to quit now
that you're a little tired...!

224
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:05,708
If you give up, you'll
never be a true exorcist...

225
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:08,833
You said you wanted to
protect them... right...?!

226
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,416
Right?!

227
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,916
That's why I hate you--you're
so damn lazy, short stack...

228
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,250
destroy this Akuma
and save these people...

229
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:19,166
or just give up and die.

230
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:21,791
Okay, in that case...

231
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:23,541
if you're gonna
hate me anyway...

232
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:27,750
I never actually told
you I would give up.

233
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:31,541
I just needed to catch
my breath, that's all.

234
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:34,958
Everything about
you is annoying.

235
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,583
Give me one more shot...

236
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,416
please...

237
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,125
Innocence...

238
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,708
activate!

239
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,500
Underworld Creatures...

240
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:53,666
First Illusion!

241
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,833
Be vanquished!

242
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:01,791
Impossible...!

243
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:05,291
Damn you to hell!

244
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,250
One more time...

245
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:43,041
I wanna hear Lala...

246
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:58,666
Do you want a song?

247
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:07,166
Mister Human?

248
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,083
Do you want a song?

249
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:12,875
Mister Human?

250
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,333
Mi-ster hu-man...

251
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:16,916
I am a doll.

252
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,166
I'll sing a song...

253
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,958
Mi-ster hu-man.

254
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:30,041
Lala...

255
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:33,583
I love you.

256
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:40,291
Are you going to sleep now?

257
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:41,458
Then I will sing...

258
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:44,625
a peaceful lullaby
for the nice human.

259
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:09,166
You sleeping...?

260
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,458
You'd better keep a
close eye on that doll.

261
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,791
Yeah... Are you okay?

262
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:16,083
I heal quicker than most people.

263
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:17,375
Really...?

264
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:18,500
You looked pretty bad.

265
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:19,666
Shut up.

266
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,375
I was able to make contact
with the Order a while ago

267
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,666
and Komui has
given us instructions...

268
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,166
I'm headed straight to the
next assignment from here...

269
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,833
It's your job to bring the
Innocence to Headquarters.

270
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:35,250
I got it.

271
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,666
If it's too hard,
just go stop her...

272
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,666
It's not even
really Lala anymore.

273
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,791
You're right...

274
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:45,125
but it's the promise they had...

275
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:49,708
Guzol has to be the one
who finally stops her song.

276
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:53,333
You're too soft, you know that?

277
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:55,666
An exorcist is
simply a destroyer...

278
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:59,250
We'll never be anyone's savior.

279
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:00,958
I don't think I agree...

280
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:03,250
We can be both.

281
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:17,666
On the third night...

282
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,666
after Guzol died...

283
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,666
Lala stopped.

284
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:34,625
Thank you...

285
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:38,791
for letting me sing
until I broke down.

286
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:41,708
You helped me keep my promise--

287
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:54,083
Hey... what's wrong with you?

288
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Kanda...

289
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,750
We're not just destroyers...

290
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,458
At the same time...

291
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:05,375
we can be saviors.

292
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:39,541
In the town, a voice shouts

293
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:41,250
that an Akuma
has been spotted...

294
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:44,625
The boy wanted to go after
it more than anything.

295
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:45,791
It's dangerous!

296
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:47,916
Stay away from the
Milennium Earl...!

297
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,333
On the next episode
of D. Gray-man:

298
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:52,708
"That Which Calls
forth Disaster."

299
00:22:52,791 --> 00:22:55,583
Bring forth salvation to
this poor Akuma's soul!
