The fact that such a phenomenon

Hey, what's wrong, Miranda?

Did you just hear something?

Oh, no.

It's nothing to worry about,
but still, thank you for asking.

That's good to hear.

You know, I never realized

230
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:32,500
that Innocence was capable
of this kind of thing.

231
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:33,833
I know it's temporary,

232
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:36,000
but it's amazing that
you can heal their wounds.

233
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,875
[MIRANDA] Well, if the
circumstances were different,

234
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:40,333
I would prefer not
to use this ability.

Even if they regain

237
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:45,083
the strength to
fight temporarily,

238
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:49,500
they're just going to keep
sustaining injuries.

239
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:52,125
The longer it takes to bring
this battle to an end,

240
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,166
the more likely
we'll lose someone.

And then I won't be
able to revive them!

help fight, but I...
