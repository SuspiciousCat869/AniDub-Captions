What's going on?

160
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:46,875
Liquor bottles?

161
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:48,833
But who put them in the hallway?

162
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:50,416
[JASDERO]
We did!

163
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,291
And you should probably know,
there's a bomb planted in one!

164
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,708
But so many to choose from!

165
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:56,000
[ALLEN]
Huh?

166
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:03,166
If you don't find and defuse
it soon, you'll all be spirits!

167
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,625
[JASDERO laughs]

168
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,875
Who would think of
a trap like this?

169
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:09,541
They could be lying.

00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:19,041
[KRORY grunts]
Which one is it?

173
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,958
[LERO]
Move faster, Lero!

[ALL grunt]

175
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:29,000
[ALLEN] I know these bottles.
I recognize all these brands.

176
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,041
[LENALEE]
Huh?

177
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,416
It's coming back.

178
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,625
The memory of going out
to buy booze for my master.

179
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,666
General Cross did that?

180
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,125
And I had to put
them all on a tab!

181
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,166
[ALL gasp]

182
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:45,416
It got to a point where
no one would sell to me.

183
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,791
"My! You're running
up a large bill!."

184
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:50,166
"Go support your habit
some other place!"

185
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,541
But it wouldn't matter.

186
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:54,250
If I showed up empty-handed,
I'd still get scolded.

187
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:57,375
"Go find me some! And don't
come back till you do!"

188
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,750
So I pleaded and
begged around town.

189
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:02,250
Until someone took pity
and sold me a bottle!

190
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:03,708
Uh, Allen.

191
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:06,208
I don't really think this is
the time to get nostalgic.

192
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:09,833
And the most expensive alcohol
among them all was...

193
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:14,041
[ALLEN]
This one! The prized drink!

194

Hurry up!

How do we defuse it?

00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:29,291
And we've only got
eight seconds!

202
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:34,541
Just get rid of it
before it explodes, Lero!

Talk about a close call.

Well done. That was
quick thinking.

213
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,625
Yeah, it was a piece of cake.

214
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:59,041
Why are bottles of my master's
favorite alcohol here?

215
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,708
Please, don't tell
me he's somewhere

216
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,416
inside the Ark with us.

217
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,916
That might be the case. If so,
it's good news. Right, Allen?

218
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,375
[ALLEN]
What?

219
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:09,500
This master of yours would
never try to bomb his pupil,

220
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:10,541
would he?

221
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:13,041
He would never stoop
to such a level!

222
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,833
Then again, I could be wrong.

223
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:17,625
Regardless, we should
keep moving forward.

224

[grunts] The thought of my
master waiting for us somewhere

225
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:23,666
in the Ark is troublesome.

226
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,875
I want to find him, but at
the same time I don't.

[LERO]
Uh...

And, for your last hand,
a royal flush!

How about we ignore this
one and just keep moving?

I completely agree.

it's rigged to explode!

chips to gamble with!

Do you pick black? Or red?

Who's behind these
morbid games?

Wait. What're you saying?

What kind of reckless life have
you been living up until now?

283
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:59,250
No choice. Looks like we're
going to have to place a bet.

00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:02,166
Right! We'll leave it
in your hands, Allen.

experience than the rest of us.

you have any proof?

why don't you prove it
