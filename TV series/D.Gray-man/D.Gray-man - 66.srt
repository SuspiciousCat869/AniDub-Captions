You're done for the day.

[BAK]
You won't get anywhere

41
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:49,833
unless you rest up once
in a while, Walker.

42
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:51,333
Are we clear?

[ALLEN grunts]

44

Yes, sir.

45
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,208
[SHIFU]
This is the data we gathered

46
00:03:57,291 --> 00:04:00,291
when you started training.

47
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,333
The point where you first
employed your plan

48
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:05,791
to force your Innocence out
through fear of death--is here.

49
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,791
But the timeline doesn't
show any change

50
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:10,625
in your activation
time after that.

51
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,208
Since you weren't
getting results,

52
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:16,708
you and Fo began to make changes
to your training routine.

53
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:19,958
This graph shows
the data from that.

54
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:22,291
You tried training at
different times of day,

55
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:25,708
even shortening and
lengthening your battles.

56
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:28,208
You adjusted several
different variables,

57
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:32,500
but after today's 20-hour
training session,

58
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:35,000
we still aren't seeing
a difference in output.

59
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:37,583
So what could possibly
be the problem here?

60
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:40,833
I mean, do you have any idea
what could be missing, Shifu?

61
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:43,500
Well... That's a difficult
question to answer,

62
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,625
since there's never been
a case quite like this.

63
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:48,000
Think about it, we're trying
to activate an Innocence

64
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:49,208
that's already been destroyed.

65
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:52,125
I'm not sure that's
even possible.

66
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,625
Are you okay?

67
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,291
Huh? Oh, me?

68
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:01,583
Yeah. I guess I kinda
blew it today, didn't I?

69
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,041
My bad, guys.

70
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:07,916
Okay! I'll just have to try
extra hard tomorrow! Yeah!

71
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,291
Anyway. I'd better be
getting back to my room now.

72
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:13,208
See ya.

73
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,166
He's pushin' himself
really hard.

74
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,125
Yeah, I suppose he's more upset

75
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:24,125
about this situation
than any of us are.

76
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,583
Poor Walker.

77
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:30,291
We're very concerned
about all of this.

78
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:31,791
I agree.

79
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,666
What if our base comes under
attack because of that boy?

80
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,458
[BOTH] Are you gentlemen
sure it's necessary

81
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:38,250
for Walker to be staying
at the Asian Branch?

82
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,875
Have you considered transferring
him to headquarters?

83
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:43,333
They have better facilities
and more personnel there.

84
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:45,333
[WONG] But what if he
was spotted by Akuma

85
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:47,791
or the Noahs during transport?

86
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:50,583
As it stands, he's a
normal human being.

87
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:53,000
He wouldn't have any
way to protect himself.

88
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:55,333
Well, we'll have to
take our chances.

89
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:57,875
He's an Exorcist who
can't use Innocence.

90
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,250
Doesn't that mean he's of
no use to the Black Order?

91
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:03,541
You... You'd best
hold your tongue!

92
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:06,541
I understand what you're
trying to express here.

93
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:10,791
That said, Walker isn't
useless by any means.

94
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:14,666
As you know, the number of
Exorcists is steadily declining.

95
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,625
Each one we have is
much too valuable

96
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:20,250
to let go, Walker included.

97
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:23,166
In fact, he's a
crucial asset to us.

98
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,500
I assure you that the
Asian Branch, actually,

99
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:29,916
the Order as a whole cannot
afford to lose him.

100
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:35,416
If you feel that
strongly about it,

101
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,166
then it seems we have no choice.

102
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:40,958
[WONG]
The nerve.

103
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:44,083
To think they'd even suggest
something like that.

104
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:46,208
[BAK]
I'm sure they're afraid too.

105
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:50,583
The Noahs have been relentless
in their pursuit of Walker.

106
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,458
The most troubling part is,

107
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:55,791
they're not trying to kill Allen
Walker because he's an Exorcist

108
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:59,166
or because of his Innocence.

109
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,958
But, because of his connection
to a certain someone.

110
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:05,375
I tried asking Walker
about that connection,

111
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,541
but he didn't know who it was.

112
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:10,208
That's exactly why we can't
let him set foot outside

113
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:15,291
until the situation is resolved
and his weapon is recovered.

114
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:18,833
He'll be safe at the Asian
Branch until then.

115
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,583
[BAK] Luckily that deity
my grandfather made

116
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:25,916

activate his Innocence.

be to the Asian Branch?

Give it a rest.

made the call, right?

138

No helping it.

Look at it this way,

140

this is even more of a
problem for the Chief.

back my Innocence.

163
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:02,916
I have to keep fighting!
Come on, hurry!

164
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,250
[ALLEN gasps]

165
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:08,083
[ALL]
Huh?

166
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:11,125
[FO growls]
Idiot!

167
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:14,250
--What's wrong with you?!
--[ALLEN groans]

168
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:18,250
Oh, no! Walker!

169
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,250
Hey, stay back!

170
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:20,333
You'll get hurt!

171
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:22,833
Stop wasting time!
What's your deal?!

172
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:24,958
Please, Fo!
He's not feeling well.

173
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,041
Give him a break, okay?

174
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,916
[FO]
Ugh, do I look like I care?

175
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,833
Why aren't you giving
it your best?!

176
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:32,916
This... is my best.

177
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,875
Don't you lie to me, Walker!

178
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,583
Jeez, what is it gonna take?

179
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:39,166
I'm starting to think you don't
even want to make this happen!

180
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,791
Get your head in the game
before it's too late, kid.

181
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,083
What, do you have something more
important to worry about?

182
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,125
I know, you're scared,
aren't you?

183
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:48,541
You make me sick,
you little baby!

184
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:51,166
What makes that stupid Bak
think a short stack like you

185
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,791
could revive your Innocence?!

186
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:55,500
[ALLEN yells]

187
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:57,083
Uh-oh, you broke Walker!

188
00:10:57,166 --> 00:11:00,125
What are you freakin' out about?
This is all your fault!

189
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,708
Would you please calm down?

190
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:05,750
[ALLEN] I don't know what's
wrong with me either.

191
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,291
[BOTH]
Mm?

192
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,333
[ALLEN] I mean, do you think
I want to be stuck here,

193
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,250
doing nothing?

194
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:16,875
I don't know what to do!
I'm so lost...

195
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:20,750
Ugh. Dammit!

196
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,333
How long...?

197
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:26,166
How long do I have to
keep doing this?

198
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,083
[ALLEN grunts]

199
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:33,791
What's the matter?

200
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:36,833
I thought you were supposed
to be training right now.

201
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:39,708
Forget him. He's a loser.

202
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:41,625
Did something happen?

203
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:44,083
He's always keeping his
problems to himself.

204
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,291
Would it kill him to
ask for some help?

205
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,833
He doesn't even care how
worried I am about him!

206
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,875
I'm sick of that jerk.

207
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:53,125
Listen, no matter what you say,

208
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,541
I'm not gonna babysit that
little wuss anymore.

209
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:58,000
Are you trying to quit
training with Walker?

210
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:00,958
You heard me.
Who cares about him?

211
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:02,750
Just let him die.

212
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:03,666
[chair legs scraping]

213
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,208
[BAK]
Hm...

214
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,666
If you say so. You're a deity.

215
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,083
It's not like there's any way
I can stop you, right?

216
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:14,166
I guess it was just
too difficult...

217
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,458
All right, let's give
up on Walker then.

218
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:18,666
Huh?

219
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,125
Actually, if you're not
gonna work with him,

220
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,875
then there's no reason for him
to stay in the Asian Branch.

221
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:25,000
[FO]
H-Hey!

222
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:26,166
That's right!

223
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,750
I'd better take those
other guys' advice

224
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,458
and have him sent back
to headquarters!

225
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,416
Now... Now wait just a second!

226
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,708
I know he kinda sucks
at this and everything,

227
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,666
but don't you think sending
him away is too harsh?

228
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,875
Perhaps, but what
else can we do?

229
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,541
I told you. The kid's
got a lot on his mind.

230
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:44,166
You can't blame him for
being a little distracted!

231
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,416
Oh, yeah?

232
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,500
Someone's in tune with
Walker all of a sudden.

233
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,958
It's all over his face,
any fool can tell!

234
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:52,333
Anyway, I'm sure we'll
see some improvement.

235
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,625
He just needs some time
to clear his head!

236
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,291
Okay? Trust me!

237
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:59,083
You're not backing down.

238
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:01,083
All right, if it's that
important to you,

239
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:04,500
I say we keep working with
him to the bitter end!

240
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,083
Uh!

241
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:09,750
Uh. Wait, that face...

242
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:12,291
I'm just so touched by you
standing up for Walker!

You're an expert at that, sir.

247
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:31,916
Well, we can't have them
fighting, can we?

248
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,083
Would you like me to
help you with that?

Yes, please do.

Hey! It's been a while!

00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,708
Komui? [growls]

255
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:58,000
[KOMUI] I've been wondering
what's going on over there!

256
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:00,125
So, I thought I'd
give you a ring.

257
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:03,000
[REEVER] Hey, Chief, could you
please stop slacking off?

258
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,541
[WONG exhales]

259
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:07,958
[BAK clears throat] Well, I
don't have anything to report.

260
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:11,833
The situation with Walker
isn't looking too good.

261
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:15,125
[KOMUI] I see. So why can't
he use his Innocence?

262
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,583
[BAK] If we knew that,
it would be easy.

263
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:19,416
One thing's for certain though,

264
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,041
forcing it out by backing him
into a corner isn't working.

265
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,750
See, we were thinking maybe
now that he's a human,

266
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,500
we could trigger his
survival instincts

267
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,958
and get him to accelerate
his evolution that way.

268
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:32,208
It seemed like a solid strategy.

269
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:34,833
But it looks like we're
starting to hit a wall.

270
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:38,583
Basically, we discovered that
Walker being placed in a crisis,

271
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,208
and activating his Innocence,

272
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:42,791
don't really go hand
in hand at all.

273
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:43,833
I see.

274
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,000
[BAK]
What now?

275
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,833
Well, survival is one thing,

276
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:50,458
but it's much more
complex than that.

277
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,875
I think there may be some
other factors involved.

278
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,958
[BAK]
Other factors. Like what?

279
00:14:56,041 --> 00:15:00,583
Not sure. Although, I
can venture one guess.

280
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,375
You may not have
experienced this,

281
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:05,125
but Innocence has its own will.

282
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:06,500
I have.

283
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,708
Back when Walker was rescued
from the brink of death.

284
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:11,166
I thought that
might be the case.

285
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,000
[KOMUI]
If that's what's going on here,

286
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,916
the Innocence could be
longing for something.

287
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,958
[BAK]
Hm.

288
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,708
If he wants to
activate his power,

289
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,833
then he'll need to find
out what that is.

290
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:24,916
I think it's something Allen's
longing for at the same time.

291
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,375
I hope that helps.

292
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:30,208
Something that the
Innocence wants,

293
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:33,166
that Walker's looking for too.

294
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:37,375
[sighs]

295
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,000
[ALLEN]
What am I doing?

296
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:41,708
I should never have blown
up at Fo like that.

297
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:43,041
She was so mad,

298
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:46,666
she probably won't want
to train with me anymore.

299
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,458
Uh.

300
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,208
[ALLEN] What if I'm giving
this all I've got,

301
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:54,666
and it turns out to
be for nothing?

302
00:15:54,750 --> 00:16:00,541
Do I even remember how to
activate my Innocence now?

303
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:04,083
It's weird, I can't even
recall what it felt like

304
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,833
to have my left arm anymore.

305
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:10,750
[ALLEN grunts]
Things are pretty dark.

306
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:12,916
Huh?

307
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,666
--Hello there, Walker.
--[ALLEN screams]

308
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,875
O-Oh! Hi, Lo Fwa!
Where'd you come from?

309
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:22,416
[LO FWA] I brought a light.
You said it was dark, so...

310
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,250
Oh. That's not really
what I meant, but...

311
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:26,500
[LO FWA]
Here.

312
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:30,208
[ALLEN]
Uh, thanks, I guess.

313
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:39,916
[LO FWA] So, it seems pretty
tough, getting your arm back.

314
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I dunno. It could be worse,
right? I'm kinda pathetic.

315
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:49,333
[LO FWA] That's not true at all!
You're working very hard.

316
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:51,958
[ALLEN] Yeah, but if nothing
ever comes of it,

317
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,375
what's the point?

318
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:57,666
[LO FWA] Nothing? You've
already gained something.

319
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,000
Huh?

320
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:01,125
[LO FWA]
Well, you made some friends,

321
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:02,958
and then the Noahs
came after you

322
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:07,125
because they thought your
Innocence might be the Heart.

323
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:13,083
People died, you saw a Fallen
one, you lost your weapon.

324
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:16,541
Didn't those things make you
want to protect your comrades?

325
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:19,333
You're determined to
stop the Noahs, right?

326
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,875
I'm sure the burden of
the lives you couldn't save

327
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,375
is making you feel like
you have to fight as hard

328
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:28,166
as you possibly can.
Maybe harder than you can.

329
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,583
I think what's driving you
more than anything now,

330
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:34,750
is the kindness in your heart.

331
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:39,250
And yet, even though it may come
from wanting to be kind,

332
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:42,750
your determination to fight
them has gotten so powerful.

333
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,541
Maybe it's starting
to overshadow

334
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:45,833
that precious feeling.

335
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:48,541
The one that's been there
from the beginning.

336
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:51,750
You don't fight for
the sake of fighting.

337
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:55,708
And you certainly don't live
for the sake of fighting.

338
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:58,416
The reason you feel
so compelled to fight,

339
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,125
is because you have something
important to protect.

340
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,208
Something important, huh?

341
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,791
That's right.

342
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:08,458
Do you mean...?

343
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,125
[LO FWA]
Heh.

344
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,458
What's happening?

345
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,416
Wh-Wh-Why are there two of me?!

346
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,458
A-And why is one of me
flirting with Walker?!

347
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:18,583
[ALLEN]
Uh?

348
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:20,958
[LI KEI] Uh, Lo Fwa?
What's the matter?

349
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,833
Oh, dear.

350
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:24,541
[FO growls]
And I was so close, too.

351
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:25,666
[ALLEN]
Uh!

352
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:29,291
What?! It was Fo?!

353
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,333
[LI KEI, LO FWA scream]

354
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:31,958
That's right, I forgot.

355
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:34,250
She can transform
into other people.

356
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,791
I hear she likes to play
pranks on the Chief.

357
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:40,166
[LI KEI] Okay, but why was
she posing as Lo Fwa?

358
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:44,000
[FO grunts] Don't take it
the wrong way. Got that?

359
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,500
Uh...?

360
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,916
I... I didn't come here to
whisper sweet nothings to you!

361
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,333
I'm still pissed off
at you about earlier!

362
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,500
Don't go gettin' all excited!

363
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:57,625
[FO] Man, that kid's
a pain in the ass! Ugh!

364
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,541
[ALLEN]
Thank you, Fo.

365
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,750
For the light.

366
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:11,166
[FO] We'll train some more
after you rest up.

367
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,666
[ALLEN]
Sure.

368
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,541
And you'd better not
impersonate me anymore!

369
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:18,208
So... What was she
talking to you about?

370
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,791
She actually taught me
something really wise.

371
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:23,041
[SHIFU]
Hm?

372
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,583
[ALLEN]
You're right, Fo.

373
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,625
I do have something precious,

374
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:29,833
even though I've
lost sight of it.

375
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:32,458
And that's the reason
why I fight.

376
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:37,291
Because... I have to protect
what's important to me.

377
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:52,083
[MILLENNIUM EARL]
What is it, Tyki, my boy?

378
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:53,416
Uh, your boy?

379
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,250
[MILLENNIUM EARL]
What?

380
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:55,958
Ah! Nothing!

381
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,708
Anyway, about this guy.

382
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:00,791
Are you sure we have
the right information?

383
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,333
[MILLENNIUM EARL]
Course we do.

384
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:05,000
If the Prisoner of the List Cell
says that he's still alive,

385
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:08,083
then trust me, he's still alive.

386
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,125
[MILLENNIUM EARL] You mustn't
underestimate Innocence.

387
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:13,708
[TYKI]
Huh?

388
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:17,000
[MILLENNIUM EARL] It's an evil
force that seeks to destroy us.

389
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:20,875
It'll stop at nothing to do so.

390
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:23,083
[sighs]

391
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:27,458
Hey you. Come out, would ya?

392
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:31,375
I need you to use the box
and go to China right away.

393
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,375
With this...

394
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:36,375
Yes, sir.

395
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:39,458
I have the name of your target.

396
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,291
[ALLEN] Lenalee and the others
make their way to Edo,

397
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:25,375
careful not to run into
any trouble on the way.

398
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:26,750
But during the journey,

399
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:31,625
something strange
happens to the Akuma.

400
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:33,916
On the next <i>D.Gray-Man</i> :

401
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,916
"Heading to Edo."

402
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:42,875
Hey Kanda, are you sure you
don't want a bite of this cake?

403
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:44,875
No way, I can't eat sweet stuff.

404
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:47,833
[ALLEN]
Hm?

405
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:49,291
More for me then.

406
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:50,333
Fine.

407
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:51,708
Come on now...

408
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:52,791
Stop it!

409
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:55,875
[yelping]
