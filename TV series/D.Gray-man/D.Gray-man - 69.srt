[AKUMA A] These humans are
just delaying the inevitable.

167
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:27,416
[AKUMA A chuckles]
They think that'll stop me?

168
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,041
Fo!

169
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:38,583
[FO groaning]
I've got you...

170
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,708
...Walker...

171
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,625
Hang in there, okay?

172
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:47,666
You know what? Despite
appearances, you got guts.

173
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,166
Even if you're just a kid.

174
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,083
[ALLEN gasps]

175
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,208
You'll reactivate your
Innocence one day.

176
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:57,250
I'm sure of it.

177
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:59,541
Your face... Why did you...

178
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,250
[FO laughs]

179
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,166
But Fo, you're injured!

180
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,791
You can't fight him!

181
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,208
Fo!

182
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:09,041
I'm no Exorcist, Allen.
Just a guardian deity

183
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,875
with zero expectations
of defeating him at all.

184
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:13,166
[ALLEN gasping]

185
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,625
[FO]
But hopefully,

186
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:18,875
I can buy you some time.

187
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,791
You better run.

188
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,750
Ah! Don't go!

189
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:31,458
Let me go! I'll fight
the Akuma instead!

190
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:32,750
Bak! Stop her!

191
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:37,083
Let me go in her place! No!

192
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:46,791
Well then. You finally decided
to accept your fate.

193
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:47,916
Too bad.

194
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,333
I was looking forward
to hunting you.

195
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:57,458
I am Allen Walker, and I won't
let you pass any further.

196
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,916
We'll see about that.

197
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,958
Stop her! Let me through!

198
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:28,041
[ALLEN]
Fo!

199
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,291
[AKUMA A]
You willingly return

200
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,750
after how easily I put
you down the first time?

201
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:37,333
You're either brave
or incredibly stupid.

202
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:39,666
Regardless, this
shouldn't take long.

203
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,166
You're move, Allen Walker.

204
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:49,625
Good bye... Bak.

205
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,750

[FO yelling]

211
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,583
This is so boring.

212
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,000
[FO gasping]

[sighs]

215
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:42,666
Hm?

216
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:48,125
[AKUMA A] That's the spirit
I was hoping for.

217
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:51,125
I would've been disappointed
if killing you were that easy.

218
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:53,875
An absolute waste of my time.

219
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:57,291
You agree, Allen Walker?

220
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:03,750
I won't make it easy for you.

221
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,125
Open this wall right now, Bak.

222
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,083
Don't waste your energy, Walker.

223
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:10,541
You closed it you can open it!

224
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:11,416
[BAK]
I refuse.

225
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,708
[LI KEI]
Walker, calm down!

226
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:15,291
[ALLEN] So you're fine
just letting Fo die?

227
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:16,750
[BAK] You don't get it.

228
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:20,875
Exorcists are the only hope
we have against the Akuma.

229
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:24,333
If you die, that's one
less in this world,

230
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:29,333
and that means we are that much
closer to losing this war.

231
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:30,875
Forget about Fo.

232
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,375
You don't mean that.

233
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,875
[BAK] If you really cared
about her, Allen,

234
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:39,291
you'll endure her loss...
and continue moving forward.

235
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:46,166
[ALLEN] Drop the stoic
leader act, Bak.

236
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:50,875
The truth is you're on the verge
of losing control yourself.

237
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,791
You've broken out
in hives again.

238
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:53,833
[BAK]
Uh?

239
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:54,750
[ALLEN]
And you're crying.

240
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,083
Uh! What?

241
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:58,250
I don't know what you mean!

242
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:03,583
[ALLEN] You can't hide it.
You feel the same way as me.

243
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:05,000
I'll open this myself.

244
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,541
[ALL]
What?

245
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:09,166
[ALLEN] You tell me to move
forward, then block my way?

246
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,416
No.

247
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,208
I'll break through this
wall and keeping going!

248
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:16,666
You don't have any
objection, do you?

249
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,166
It's my choice to make!

250
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,666
Do I object?

251
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,791
Of course I do!

252
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:23,666
Grab this idiot!

253
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,416
[LI KEI]
Right away, Chief!

254
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,208
[ALLEN]
Huh?

255
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:26,541
[WONG]
Please excuse us.

256
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,833
[ALLEN]
Ow!

257
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:30,125
Why are you doing this?

258
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:31,583
Admit it!

259
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:34,166
You don't want Fo to die so
let me go and rescue her!

260
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,083
You don't have to say anything!
Your face speaks volumes!

261
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:40,416
Leave my hives outta this!

262
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,916
In case you forgot, that
Akuma's dark matter attack

263
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
left your body decomposed
almost down to molecules!

264
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,583
You don't stand a chance!

265
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,625
The slightest bump could
tear your body apart!

266
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:52,625
Only an idiot would let you
go into battle right now!

267
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:55,125
And you'd be stupid to want
to fight in your condition!

268
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:58,833
So shut up and follow
my orders, Exorcist!

269
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:04,708
[ALLEN] You can't tell me
what to do, Director Bak.

270
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:07,125
[BAK]
Why not?

271
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,083
[ALLEN]
I'll reveal to HQ

272
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,833
you've secretly been taking
pictures of Lenalee.

273
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:14,083
[BAK groans]

274
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:15,250
What?!

275
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:18,041
No telling what Komui
might do to you.

276
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,625
My guess is,

277
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:22,500
after he's through, you'll wish
that Level Three got you first.

278
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:24,375
[BAK]
You're a monster!

279
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,083
[LENALEE]
I can't believe this.

280
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,333
I trusted you, Bak!

281
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:30,083
And you've been spying
on me like a pervert!

282
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:31,500
You're disgusting!

283
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,791
Forgive me! Please!

284
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:36,333
[BAK screams]

285
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,208
[BAK whimpering]

286
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:39,750
Is that true?

287
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,750
I had no idea.

288
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,958

[ALL gasp]

292
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,750
I didn't think you'd
resort to blackmail.

293
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:52,833
But it doesn't matter.

294
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:55,208
I won't let you pass.

295
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,500
There are some things
you can't change!

296
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,041
I won't let you through.

297
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,166
We're talking about
a Level Three Akuma.

298
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,291
Look at you! You
won't last a minute.

299
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,041
Fo went in there
to buy us all time

300
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:08,416
and we're wasting it
arguing like this!

301
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,166
You're wasting time!
I'm not backing down!

302
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,250
And you're not going
to change my mind!

303
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,125
When we met, one of the
first things you asked me

304
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:17,791
was if I wanted to return to
the battlefield! Remember?

305
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,916
I said yes and that
hasn't changed!

306
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,041
The only way you're gonna get
that wish is if you become

307
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,000
an Exorcist again!
But guess what?!

308
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,125
You're not! You're an
ordinary human being

309
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,333
until your Innocence
gets revived! Got it?

310
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:29,333
You're wrong!

311
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:30,125
[gasps]

[ALLEN whimpers]

314
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,875
You're wrong. I'm not...

315
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:40,458
I'm not... a human being.

316
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:44,666
That Akuma... When
I saw him earlier...

317
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,541
...I felt the blood begin
to stir inside of me.

318
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:50,375
Like it was unfrozen.

319
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,500
I heard my heart pounding as if

320
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,958
it hadn't been beating
until that moment.

321
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:58,250
Like I had been brought
back from the dead.

322
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,500
And those feelings
circulating through my body

323
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:03,416
made it feel good
to be alive again.

324
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,208
What are you...

325
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,166
What're you trying to say?

326
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,208
[ALLEN]
I know the truth.

00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,875
[ALLEN]
You made an observation earlier.

331
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:23,000
My entire existence is like
one Anti-Akuma weapon.

332
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:27,375
[FO groaning]

[AKUMA A chuckles]

334
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:32,833
[ALLEN]
It wasn't just a metaphor.

[AKUMA A chuckles]

337
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:50,125
What my heart
wanted all this time,

338
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:54,333
the most important thing
to me, was killing Akuma!

339
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,166
I'm not a human anymore!

340
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,125
I am an Exorcist, Bak!

341
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:01,333
And I have to return
to the battlefield!

342
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,666
[ALLEN]
Let me fight Akuma!

343
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:08,958
[ALL gasp]

344
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:15,250
Wong! Li Kei!

345
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,583
We're okay, I think.

346
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:18,708
He's gone.

347
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:20,500
What could have happened to him?

348
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:21,916
[gasps]

349
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,416
[ALLEN]
I'm going.

350
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,833
Thank you for everything, Bak.

351
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,500
You can't.

352
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,875
[BAK]
Houshin.

353
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:56,791
His arm and eye aren't weapons.

354
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:59,625
His very existence is.

355
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,583
[BAK]
Only 15 years old,

356
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:05,458
and cursed by the Akuma.

357
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:07,791
[ALLEN]
Thank you all very much.

358
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:10,333
For everything you've
done to help me.

359
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:13,875
I'm truly grateful.
With all my heart.

360
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:16,000
I'm not a human anymore!

361
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,875
I only said that to try
and protect you, Allen.

362
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,083
Not hurt you.

363
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:26,041
[BAK]
I'm sorry.

364
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:45,375
[AKUMA A] I expected more
of a fight out of you.

365
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:47,208
I don't understand why the Noah

366
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:49,458
wanted a weakling
so desperately.

367
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:52,333
Even going so far
as to use the Ark.

368
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:54,333
Tell me, Allen Walker,

369
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:57,875
before you die--
who are you?

370
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:05,750
I'm a kid. Nothing more.

371
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:08,458
[AKUMA A]
Correction.

372
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,000
You are nothing.

373
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,250
[FO screams]

374
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,291
[AKUMA A laughs]

375
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:34,916
Walker.

376
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,625
What did you do? Who are you?

377
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,041
I'm an Exorcist.

378
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:28,041
[ALLEN] In order to
buy us time and escape,

379
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:30,916
Fo challenged a Level Three
Akuma by herself.

380
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,750
But I refuse to
leave her to die.

381
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:35,541
One direct hit, and I'm dead.

382
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:37,708
If I'm going to save her
and win this fight,

383
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:40,041
I need to try
something desperate.

384
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:43,958
On the next <i>D.Gray-man</i> :
"God's Clown!"

385
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:46,833
Your name's Short Stack.

386
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:48,125
[ALLEN]
Huh?

387
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:50,125
So what am I supposed
to call him?

388
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:52,625
Actually, I don't think
he even has a name.

389
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:53,916
I figured.

390
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,916
[AKUMA A]
What?! I don't have a name?!
