1
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:44,166
It always belonged to me...

2
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:49,166
I was wrong, I shouldn't
have run away.

3
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:53,500
But... just that once...

4
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:56,666
I did... and now...

5
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:37,291
Aren't we there yet...?

6
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:38,333
Come on, guys...

7
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm really starving here.

8
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:40,916
Yeah...

9
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,125
I feel you, Allen...

10
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:43,375
I'm tired, too...

11
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:46,083
and I'm thirsty,
I'd give anything for a drink!

12
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,708
I know...

13
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:49,791
Hang in there, everyone...

14
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:52,125
I think we should be
getting close to a town...

15
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,458
Lavi...! Is that a...?

16
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:57,833
Yes...! We did it...

17
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:00,500
It looks like we're actually
headed to a real town!

18
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:01,833
Finally!

19
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:04,166
Man o man, they gotta have
something to drink here!

20
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,375
Yes, food, here I come...

21
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:07,625
I'm so glad!

22
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:09,333
We've been saved!

23
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,458
What's this?

24
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:27,583
We made it!

25
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:28,916
Yeah...!

26
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,166
Hey, wait...

27
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,291
This is strange...

28
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:32,750
Where are the people?

29
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:36,333
I wonder what's going on?

30
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:41,250
Do you think maybe...
it's a ghost town?

31
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,541
It can't be a ghost
town, I'm thirsty.

32
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,333
How am I gonna get a
drink if no people are here?!

33
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:48,375
There's something
wrong with this place.

34
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:55,791
As far as I can tell,
there are waterways

35
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:58,333
running in all directions inside
the perimeter of the town.

36
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:00,333
And yet...

37
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:02,166
They all seem to be empty.

38
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,125
What does that mean?

39
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:06,500
It means the water's dried up.

40
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,875
Forgive me for
interrupting--are you travelers?

41
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,708
 Oh, fantastic...

42
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:11,750
Sorry, it's just nice to know

43
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,625
that there are
people in this town!

44
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:32,166
I realize it's not much but...

45
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,875
under the circumstances
it's the best I can offer...

46
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,583
Please... it's great!

47
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:39,375
It's wonderful, seriously...

48
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:43,500
Well then, go ahead and dig in.

49
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,458
Thank you very much!

50
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:48,500
Your people seem to
be suffering here...

51
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,291
Well, it's not easy...

52
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:51,875
We've all been
scrambling ever since

53
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,291
the town's water
source started drying up.

54
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:55,208
The source?

55
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:57,125
That's right...

56
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:58,500
You see there's a
good-sized lake

57
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:01,416
located just a short
distance outside of town.

58
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,166
It held plenty of water
that naturally overflowed

59
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,041
and fed directly
into our waterways...

60
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,833
However, about a
month ago the water level

61
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:13,166
started dropping
lower and lower,

62
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:17,875
and we can't for the
life of us figure out why.

63
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,041
It's gotten so serious

64
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:25,833
we had to start rationing
our drinking water.

65
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:28,000
Have you discovered
why this is happening?

66
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:30,250
No... we still don't
know the cause...

67
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,500
According to all the people

68
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:33,416
who've been watching
the lake and investigating,

69
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,750
even after a heavy rain

70
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:37,000
the water level there
keeps decreasing.

71
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:39,875
Wait a minute... after
a rain the level's down?

72
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,416
How can that be?

73
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,791
It's certainly...
a mysterious phenomenon.

74
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:46,583
Indeed... one worth
looking into.

75
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:47,833
Good point...

76
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:48,916
Would it be alright
if we took a look

77
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,666
at the water
source as well...?

78
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,916
We might be able to find

79
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,666
some overlooked clues
that could help out...

80
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,875
Go ahead...

81
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:56,208
If you wanna get to
the lake from here...

82
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,625
just go out the front gate
and hang a hard right...

83
00:05:58,708 --> 00:05:59,833
then keep going straight ahead

84
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:01,416
and you'll
eventually run into it...

85
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:06,041
If you can help us in any way,
we'd all be very grateful.

86
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:08,750
Well, we'll do our best, sir!

87
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:13,958
What...?!

88
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,083
Why do Lenalee and I have
to stay here in town?!

89
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:18,041
Come on...

90
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:19,625
Even if we check the
lake that doesn't mean

91
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,750
we'll be able to
solve the mystery.

92
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:23,875
It makes sense that
someone should stay behind

93
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:25,625
to question the townspeople,

94
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:28,916
especially about what was going
on around here a month ago...

95
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,833
and with Lenalee
growing up in China

96
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:33,875
and all I figured it'd be
easier for her to talk to 'em.

97
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:35,416
Okay, sure!

98
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,666
But I... I just wanna--

99
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,083
If we find that Innocence
is causing the phenomena

100
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:43,416
there are likely other
things present as well.

101
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,791
Akuma!

102
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,333
Bingo...!

103
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:47,625
And now that that's settled
we'll leave the investigation

104
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,916
of the town in
your capable hands.

105
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,208
Let us know if you
come up with anything!

106
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:53,875
Don't worry--we will!

107
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:56,000
You guys be careful!

108
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,666
C'mon, Lenalee,
I'm always careful!

109
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,583
Okay, let's find
someone to talk to.

110
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,916
He was right.
This isn't much water at all.

111
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,666
How strange, no wonder the
town's waterways are dried up.

112
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,541
Do you see something, Bookman?

113
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:37,916
Seems the
water's still receding.

114
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:40,208
Look at that...

115
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:41,333
How could the level go down

116
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:43,250
when the town
isn't drawing off of it?

117
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,666
Could something
have happened to it?

118
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,541
Well, it's possible
the lake water

119
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:50,000
could be draining or
disappearing somewhere.

120
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,625
But what would cause
something like that?

121
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,750
If it isn't flowing out anywhere

122
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:58,375
then I'm guessing there must be
something actually in the water.

123
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:00,583
I see!

124
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:01,833
Then let's jump in...

125
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,125
we can take a quick dip
and see what's in there!

126
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:04,791
No, wait!

127
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:06,250
Is something the matter?

128
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,583
What's going on here?

129
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,666
I think they're the townspeople.

130
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:20,250
They must've decided the lake
water needed to be guarded.

131
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,333
Due to the fact they're losing
their only water source...

132
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:27,083
Concern on their part
is easily understood...

133
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:29,541
I'm afraid if we dove
into the lake right now

134
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:33,250
while they're watching we'd
invite an unpleasant scene.

135
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:34,541
Then, how will we be able

136
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,833
to discover the
cause and help them?

137
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,625
We'll still check it out,

138
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:41,041
because the sun's
gonna go down eventually

139
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:44,041
and it'll be a lot easier to
get around them in the dark.

140
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,583
That's a great plan!

141
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:51,083
Yes, we have no
choice but to wait it out.

142
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,750
They're Exorcists.

143
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:59,541
We have to get our hands
on it before they do.

144
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:02,500
Our mission is to kill all
the miserable Exorcists.

145
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:03,875
We should do it tonight!

146
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,833
Yes, as soon as possible!

147
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:11,375
What...?

148
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:12,833
Fortune teller?

149
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:14,208
That's right...

150
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,708
The story around town
was that the fortune teller

151
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:19,916
could see anyone's future
by using a crystal ball...

152
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,958
But then, about a month
ago they suddenly stopped

153
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:25,125
telling the fortunes
and no one knew why.

154
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:28,208
That's about the time
the water started drying up.

155
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,625
Would you mind telling me
where their house is, ma'am?

156
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:33,916
There... end of the street.

157
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:38,958
Well that's interesting...

158
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:39,958
I know...

159
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,208
How'd it go for you?

160
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:43,125
I circled around and got
a good look at the town,

161
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,833
but I haven't seen any
signs of Akuma anywhere yet.

162
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:47,000
That's good...

163
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:48,458
Well then let's go
see what we can learn

164
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,500
from this fortune
teller, shall we?

165
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,791
Hello...? Is anyone home?

166
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,625
Hello?

167
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,250
Maybe they went out for a bit.

168
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:06,166
Who are you?!

169
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,958
What did you come here for?

170
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,541
Well... you see, sir...

171
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:12,958
We're doing some investigating

172
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,583
and heard that you stopped
telling people's fortunes

173
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:17,083
around the same time the
water started drying up.

174
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:20,333
How dare you... Get out!

175
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:21,208
And don't come back!

176
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,541
But sir, wait!

177
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:25,208
Please, just tell us why
you stopped seeing people.

178
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,166
I have nothing to say to you.

179
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,750
But any information
you have, could help us!

180
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:33,875
I said no...! Now leave!

181
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,458
Grandfather...

182
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:37,958
We're worried about the
town's water supply, sir...

183
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,833
If you would only--

184
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,333
Who's that?

185
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,791
Get out of here!

186
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:47,708
Leave me alone...!

187
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:50,375
I have nothing to say to anyone!

188
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:57,208
I guess he doesn't want to talk.

189
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,375
Grandfather, what were
those people doing here?

190
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,541
Don't worry about
them, Mei Ling...

191
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:11,083
I don't imagine they'll
be coming back here soon.

192
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:12,875
But I... I saw her...

193
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:15,041
I think she's the
one in my vision...

194
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:18,166
You must, forget about it.

195
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:47,916
I see... alright.

196
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,875
We'll keep
investigating the town...

197
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:51,333
Be careful.

198
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:53,291
I can't believe they didn't
find out anything, either.

199
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,416
But they've still got
tonight to investigate

200
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,250
the lake and you and
I'll just have to be ready

201
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,166
to work a little
harder tomorrow.

202
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,333
Let's do it!

203
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,958
It's almost time!

204
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,958
Well well... they're still here.

205
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:22,083
I can't wait to see
the Exorcists in pain.

206
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:23,291
I think I'll go find the girl...

207
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,750
Then I'll wait here.

208
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,125
Is there something
wrong, old man?

209
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,541
You can investigate
the lake without me.

210
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:34,666
Say what?

211
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,625
I'm going back to town...

212
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,375
I'm counting on you.

213
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,666
Hey... wait, what's goin' on?!

214
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,833
Find her... find her...

215
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:53,333
Must... find her...

216
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,416
There she is!

217
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:31,416
Who's there?

218
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,583
Please open the door... hurry!

219
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:39,833
Oh, it's you!

220
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,166
I'm sorry it's late,

221
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,291
but I saw you today and
I knew I had to find you.

222
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:44,375
It's no problem...

223
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:45,833
I'm glad you're here ...

224
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:46,916
Come in!

225
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:51,291
So, Mei Ling, is the fortune
teller your grandfather...?

226
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,375
Are you okay?

227
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,416
Yes, but...

228
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,583
I'm the one who
tells the fortunes.

229
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,416
I'm so sorry...

230
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,458
It's just... I assumed...

231
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:00,791
You gotta understand
my grandfather's

232
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,625
just really worried about me

233
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:06,000
and that's why he was mean
and drove you away like that.

234
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,458
It's alright, we're fine...

235
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,750
Why did you decide to come
here tonight and talk to us?

236
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,416
Um, well...

237
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,875
Because...

238
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:16,041
I'm... I'm worried
about the town

239
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:18,708
and, and the
water's almost gone.

240
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:21,541
Before, I really liked
it when I could

241
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:24,791
make the people happy by
telling them their fortunes...

242
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:27,416
But now... it's just awful...

243
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,708
Everyone's suffering so much.

244
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:31,333
Oh, I see...

245
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:33,166
I bet you can
tell what's going on...

246
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,500
is that it?

247
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:39,041
No... I can't...

248
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:43,500
Hey... you did say you're a
fortune teller, didn't you?

249
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,000
Uh, yes...

250
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,458
Miss Lenalee.

251
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:48,708
Just "Lenalee," okay?

252
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:51,208
Yes, Lenalee.

253
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,583
I have an idea...
If you have the ability

254
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,958
to actually look
into people's futures,

255
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:57,125
then maybe you could try

256
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:59,750
to see the reason
the water's drying up.

257
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:05,458
I... I'm not able to
tell fortunes anymore.

258
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:06,791
Why?

259
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,375
The only way
I can discern any part

260
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:11,250
of the future is
by using my crystal ball

261
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:15,125
and I can't now because
Grandfather and I threw it away.

262
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:17,458
Oh no...! Where is it?

263
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:21,125
We threw it into the lake
a-a-about a month ago.

264
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:23,375
Are... you sure about that...?

265
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,416
You did it a month ago?

266
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,875
Yes.

267
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:32,666
Well then... maybe...
it's the crystal ball...

268
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,500
Wow.

269
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,416
But if it's your ball,

270
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,666
does that mean
it contains Innocence?

271
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,208
Innocence?

272
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:03,250
Yeah... it's an object that
has very special powers...

273
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,000
Mei Ling?

274
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,416
Yes?

275
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,083
What made you throw
the crystal ball away?

276
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,208
Why would you want to do that?

277
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,625
Because...

278
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:20,375
We did it... because
we thought that...

279
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:22,375
I didn't mean to
do anything wrong!

280
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,916
Hey, everything's
going to be okay, really!

281
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,375
Lenalee, the Akuma!

282
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,541
What is that thing?!

283
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,500
Hide!

284
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,166
I want you to stay here...

285
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,458
Don't go anywhere!

286
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,125
Noooo!!!

287
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,333
What's wrong?

288
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,000
No!!!

289
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:31,333
Mei Ling, come back!

290
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:36,458
Stop!

291
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,625
Lenalee!

292
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,666
There you are...

293
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,083
The little fortune teller girl.

294
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,291
Who... Who are you?

295
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:56,083
So nice to meet you and
now you're coming with me!

296
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,708
Mei Ling?

297
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:05,708
Akuma!

298
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:09,166
What took you so long, Exorcist?

299
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,916
You're not goin' anywhere!

300
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,791
Oh really?

301
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:35,875
Lenalee, get outta there!

302
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,375
Thanks, Allen!

303
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:54,791
No...! Mei Ling!

304
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,625
Mei Ling... Mei Ling?

305
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:03,833
Where are you...? Mei Ling?

306
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,625
Who's there?!

307
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,250
You have nothing
to fear from me,

308
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:10,541
but I must ask you a
very important question.

309
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:23,125
What's that?

310
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:47,791
That was intense, wasn't it?!

311
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,000
A few more seconds

312
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:50,541
and we would've been
sucked into that thing.

313
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,125
Yeah, could you
tell what it was?

314
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:53,833
I don't have any idea...

315
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:55,666
The water looked like
it was disappearing

316
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,583
as it was being
sucked into that light.

317
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,708
Lavi...

318
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:01,333
Ah crap...

319
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:02,666
Here we go again...

320
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,875
You ready to fight?

321
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:05,166
Of course!

322
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:15,583
This sucks!

323
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:35,583
Die!

324
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:40,458
Mei Ling was taken by an Akuma

325
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:43,625
and was about to be swallowed
up by the surface of the lake

326
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:45,708
when, at that very
moment, a great light

327
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:48,291
began to shine from
beneath the water...

328
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:50,583
On the next episode
