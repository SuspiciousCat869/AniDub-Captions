1
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:46,916
Stop this! If you damage
it anymore, it'll--!

2
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:56,625
Allen Walker!
I'll kill you for this!

3
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:06,083
You're a terrible Master.

4
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:10,416
I did it because I had
faith in you, my apprentice.

5
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:16,083
[BOOKMAN] There's no need to
worry. She's just unconscious.

6
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:17,875
What a relief.

7
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:24,708
[giggling]

8
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:08,666
[JOHNNY]
Stop. Stop it.

9
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:12,000
You... You can't!

10
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:22,500
[RENI]
This can't be happening.

11
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,750
This is all... It's a dream.

12
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,208
It's very real.

13
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,583
Did you think the Akuma
could be stopped so easily

14
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,875
by your vain efforts?

15
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,375
[SKULL B] They were created by
the Earl to be living weapons.

16
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:40,625
Continuously evolving. Adapting
to efforts to kill them.

17
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:01,875
Wait. Is that its level?

18
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:18,375
[JOHNNY] What have I done?
This is all my fault!

19
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,375
He was already dead.

20
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:23,250
If only I hadn't been stupid
and tried to save him...

21
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:24,416
[JOHNNY screams]

22
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,333
[JOHNNY] ...I wouldn't
have gotten caught

23
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:26,416
in the first place!

24
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,666
It's still alive?

25
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:34,291
Johnny!

26
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,750
[MARVIN]
We're gonna get you out of here!

27
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:44,458
[OFFICER A]
Just hang on, Johnny!

28
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:46,041
[JOHNNY]
Chief Bak.

29
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:48,125
They have Tup!

30
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,375
We're on it!

31
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,166
Trap those Skulls, Reni! Here!

32
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,291
[RENI]
You got it!

33
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:57,625
[SKULL C gasps]

34
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:02,625
Great shot! This is our chance!

35
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,791
Hurry up and get
away while you can!

36
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,625
The battery, it's dying!

37
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:09,125
Mine won't last
much longer either!

38
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,583
[screams]

39
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,250
[ALL screaming]

40
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:29,583
[ALL screaming]

41
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:30,791
Damn it!

42
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,125
I got you!

43
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,750
[screams]

44
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,708
[JOHNNY]
What have I done?

45
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:06,750
[JOHNNY] I was so worried
about saving Tup,

46
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,875
I got everyone else hurt.

47
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:12,791
I dragged them all into this,
when I should've let him go!

48
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:18,333
It's my fault! I did this!

49
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:34,041
What happened here?

50
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:36,291
[MARVIN]
Allen...

51
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:41,291
Allen. Be careful.

52
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:46,500
The Akuma... it's evolved.

53
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:01,083
[MARVIN]
We tried to stop it.

54
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:05,166
I'm sorry, Allen. We failed.

55
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:26,458
[giggling]

56
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm Level 4.
And what's your name?

57
00:07:58,166 --> 00:07:59,125
[MARIE]
Huh?

58
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:01,041
Are you picking
something up, Marie?

59
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:06,291
Yes, it's an Akuma.
But it's frequency is-- Uh!

60
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:07,750
What's the matter?

61
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,000
[MARIE]
I don't know.

62
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:12,208
But I've never heard a
noise like this before.

63
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:40,375
[ALLEN]
It's soul... it's sickening.

64
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:45,833
This Akuma, I've never
seen one like it before.

65
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,625
One as terrible.

66
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:20,375
[ALLEN]
So this is Level 4.

67
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:24,791
It's too horrible.
I can't even look at it.

68
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:38,791
[JOHNNY]
Al... Allen.

69
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:41,541
Allen. I'm sorry.

70
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:44,916
Please help the others!

71
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,166
How can I?

72
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:49,458
[JOHNNY]
You have to help save everyone.

73
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:52,916
I'm so sorry.
This is all my fault!

74
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,625
Please, Allen. Save them!

75
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:12,291
[LEVEL 4]
Who is "everyone"?

76
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:16,458
Tell me, are you crying?

77
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:20,750
[ALLEN] Yes, for those
who didn't survive,

78
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:23,375
but also for you and your soul.

79
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,958
But now, you're going to pay!

80
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,333
[yells]

81
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,958
I'll destroy you!

82
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:45,250
Not only for what you did,
but for your own sake!

83
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:53,291
[MARIE, BOOKMAN gasp]

84
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:54,625
A Level 4?

85
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:56,208
[ALLEN]
Bookman!

86
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:58,833
There's several injured people
over there! Please help them!

87
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:03,500
[yells]

88
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,541
Gotta hurry.
I have to defeat it!

89
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,416
Before it gets stronger!

90
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:23,750
[ALLEN] Shivers are
running down my spine.

91
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:27,375
Where's all this
fear coming from?

92
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:30,083
Is this what it's like
battling a Level 4?

93
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:33,000
Being completely
overwhelmed by dread?

94
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,375
[LEVEL 4] Oh, that's right.
I nearly forgot!

95
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:47,375
This place is the Headquarters
of the Black Order, isn't it?

96
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,916
And I am a weapon of carnage,

97
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,583
so I should carry
out my purpose:

98
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:09,875
To massacre every
living person in here.

99
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,416
[TIEDOLL]
Huh?

100
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,666
What's this strange
feeling I'm getting?

101
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:30,000
Coming somewhere near Gate 26?

102
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,541
[TIEDOLL]
Marie. Do you read me?

103
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:33,875
Yes. What's wrong?

104
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:36,125
[TIEDOLL] Is anything
happening near the Gate?

105
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:38,958
Yes, sir. An Akuma appeared.

106
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:41,500
[BOOKMAN]
It's a Level 4.

107
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:42,958
A Level 4?

108
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:46,125
Curious. Akuma are
living weapons.

109
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:50,083
Which means, it could
continue evolving.

110
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,958
[BOOKMAN] Despite being
mechanical soldiers,

111
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:54,541
this one's incredibly
similar to a human.

112
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,958
The entire 100-year
history of the war

113
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,750
between the Black
Order and the Akuma

114
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,708
has been recorded
by the Bookmen.

115
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:03,458
Countless documents
detailing the conflict.

116
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:05,583
Despite all the data,
the final form

117
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,958
of the Akuma remains a mystery.

118
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,750
Up to this point,
only three Levels

119
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:12,291
had been observed and confirmed.

120
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:15,333
In other words,
this moment is historic.

121
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:18,041
A monumental event not only
for the Black Order,

122
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:20,125
but all of mankind as well.

123
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:24,333
This is our first
contact with a Level 4.

124
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:25,833
Level 4 confirmed!

125
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:27,791
Did you say a Level 4?

126
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:31,500
[yells]

127
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:34,666
No more! You won't kill again!

128
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:43,500
Fight me!

129
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:51,333
[ALLEN]
I can't shake this uneasiness.

130
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:53,666
Even though I'm the
only one attacking,

131
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,458
the more I hit him,
the more it feels like

132
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:57,916
I'm somehow receiving damage.

133
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,333
Spiritual wounds. Feelings of
helplessness and despair.

134
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:04,541
[giggles]

135
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,583
[ALLEN]
Edge End activate!

136
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:15,583
[ALLEN]
Please! Tell me it worked!

137
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:18,541
[gasps]

138
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:25,333
I've decided.
I'll start with you.

139
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:36,750
[ALLEN screaming]

140
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:47,041
No! Don't hurt Allen!

141
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,125
[giggles]

142
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:11,458
[gasps]

143
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:15,583
It wields such
incredible power.

144
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,916
I lost him!

145
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,833
Walker....

146
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:24,458
No, Allen!

147
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:30,125
[LEVEL 4 giggles]

148
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:33,083
So who's up next?

149
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:44,625
[LEVEL 4 wailing]

150
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:47,541
[BAK screaming]

151
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:48,916
This sound!

152
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,541
[MARIE screams]

153
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:51,916
It's too much!

154
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,625
[TIEDOLL]
Marie! Marie! Are you okay?

155
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,458
[TIEDOLL]
What on earth is that noise?

156
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:02,708
No use.

157
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:04,666
This screeching is
making me too dizzy

158
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,500
to stay synchronized
with my Innocence!

159
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,416
[SOCALO]
What the hell is that sound?

160
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,333
Whatever it is, it's
throwing me off balance!

161
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,875
The damn bastard
won't stop screaming!

162
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,166
On! Gataru!

163
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:32,958
[CROSS]
You'll be okay, Maria.

164
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:34,250
Since you're dead,

165
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:37,750
use Carte Garde to gain
control over my body.

166
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,666
[LEVEL 4 giggles]

167
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,416
Were you gathering
humans for me to harvest?

168
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,958
[TIEDOLL]
Don't-Don't you dare!

169
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:02,958
[SOCALO yells]

170
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:14,333
[gasps]

171
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,250
Link, you saved my life.

172
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:26,541
You didn't think I'd let Allen
Walker die that easily, did you?

173
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:29,166
What...? What happened?

174
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:37,958
No. It can't be.

175
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:55,083
Where is the Science Section?

176
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:58,208
It's gone. There
isn't anything left.

177
00:17:58,291 --> 00:17:59,875
Then that means...

178
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:03,208
Bookman... Marie, Miranda...

179
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,250
Even my master.

180
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,250
Everyone's gone...

181
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:08,791
[LINK]
That's impossible!

182
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:11,250
The Generals couldn't
have been defeated.

183
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,041
[SKULL B laughs]

184
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:22,500
[SKULL B]
Cower, you pathetic fools!

185
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:25,250
[SKULL C] You're doing
beautiful work, Level 4!

186
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:26,583
[LEVEL 4]
Hm?

187
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:29,583
Just as expected from one
of the Earl's creations!

188
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:32,250
Now get over here
and help us break free!

189
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:33,708
[SKULL C]
If we don't return soon,

190
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:36,333
we're gonna be in deep
trouble with Lord Millennium!

191
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,541
[SKULL B] Destroying this
barrier should be nothing

192
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,416
for someone as powerful as you!

193
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:44,791
[SKULL B laughing]

194
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:50,875
Huh?

195
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:52,250
[SKULL C]
Uh?

196
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,916
The idiot doesn't know
his own strength!

197
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,875
He shot right through me!

198
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,500
You double-crosser!

199
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:14,958
[gasps]

200
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,333
[LEVEL 4 giggles]

201
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:17,791
[LEVEL 4]
Sorry.

202
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:22,041
I guess I just got over-excited!

203
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:23,500
I'm so worked up,

204
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:27,500
there's no way I can calm
down until I kill even more!

205
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:31,958
I bet there are humans on
the other side of this door.

206
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:33,791
No! It's leaving!

207
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:36,791
That monster is about to
break into Headquarters!

208
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,500
I have to stop him.

209
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:46,458
Are you all right? Walker!

210
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,458
I've never seen
anything like it.

211
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,708
Contact the command center!

212
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:11,583
[ANNOUNCER A]
Warning!

213
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,916
An Akuma has entered
Headquarters from Lab 5!

214
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,416
But how?

215
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,708
[ANNOUNCER A]
Lab 5 has been destroyed!

216
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:20,916
The Akuma has escaped
beyond its walls!

217
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,416
I repeat!

218
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,625
An Akuma has annihilated Lab 5
and entered Headquarters!

219
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,708
Allen.

220
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:30,083
[ANNOUNCER A]
Furthermore, it appears to have

221
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:31,875
evolved to Level 4.

222
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:33,416
We haven't been able to confirm

223
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,416
the Exorcists' safety
inside Lab 5!

224
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,375
I repeat!

225
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:40,291
[LINK
Walker! Wake up!

226
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:44,416
There's no time!
You've got to get up now!

227
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,750
Allen! Allen!

228
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:25,750
[ALLEN ] The Level 4 escapes Lab
5, leaving a path of destruction

229
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:28,416
as it proceeds deeper
into Headquarters.

230
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:33,291
As it continues wreaking havoc,
a new target enters its sight.

231
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:37,500
On the next D.Gray-man:
"To the God I Hate So Much."

232
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:41,166
Bring forth salvation to
this poor Akuma's soul!

233
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:44,875
Listen up! We have a new
transfer student, Lero!

234
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:47,541
Give Level 4 a warm welcome!

235
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:48,666
Nice to meet you.

236
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,083
Wait a minute. For?

237
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:54,333
Oh! Yeah! I kinda miss her!

238
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:55,458
Hey!

239
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,291
[LERO]
Quite the temper.
