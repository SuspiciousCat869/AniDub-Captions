this is the way to Edo?

No doubt about it.

00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:08,583
I think the Earl might be trying
to gather every Akuma in Japan!

But I don't understand.

need to collect

162
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,375
[gasps]

163
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:50,583
[BAK] Fo! Why'd you stop
moving all of a sudden?

164
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,916
Something's going on
with Walker's eye.

165
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,041
[BAK]
What?

166
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,291
Whoa, Shifu! Tell me
you just saw that!

167
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:57,875
I did.

168
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,458
[BAK] Walker, what's
wrong with your eye?

169
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:01,916
[ALLEN]
No.

170
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,625
[BAK]
Speak to me!

171
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:06,166
[ALLEN] My left eye just
started twitching again.

172
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,083
What is it reacting to?

173
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,708
Is there an Akuma
out there somewhere?

174
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:13,791
Or maybe... something else?

175
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:22,208
[BAK]
Walker!

176
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:25,166
[ALLEN] Just ignore it.
It should stop soon.

177
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,333
[BAK]
But...

178
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:29,458
Let me keep fighting!
I can't stop now!

179
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:31,833
Sure, sounds like a plan.

180
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:33,083
Fo!

181
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:37,000
He says he wants to keep
fighting. So let's go!

182
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,666
[ALLEN groans]

183
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,875
[BAK] So to activate his
abilities, we need something

184
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:47,500
that Walker's seeking that his
Innocence is also seeking.

185
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:51,750
Whatever it is, I hope this
training helps him find it.

186
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,166
[MILLENNIUM EARL]
My precious playthings.

187
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,083
Tell me, can you all
hear my voice?

188
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:06,583
[AKUMA chattering]

189
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:15,375
[MILLENNIUM EARL]
Aw! What a glorious sight!

190
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:16,958
[DEVIT]
Creepy!

191
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:20,125
It's hard to believe all these
Akuma came from Japan, huh?

192
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:22,708
Ha, ha! The boss must be
planning something big

193
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:24,750
to need that many! [laughs]

194
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:25,833
Huh?

195
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:29,166
Hey, Tyki!

196
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,291
You don't have anything
else to do in Japan.

197
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,291
Why don't you move on
to your next job?

198
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,583
You're just takin'
up space here.

199
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:39,000
That's right,
Cross is our business!

200
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,375
[TYKI]
Hmph.

201
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:42,833
[MILLENNIUM EARL]
I don't mind giving you

202
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:45,541
a helping hand this
one time, Jasdevi.

203
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,458
Same goes for you, Skinn.

204
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,458
But I can't say that
I'll tolerate you

205
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,958
being defeated by
Generals forever.

206
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:54,666
The search for the Heart
is only just beginning.

207
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,125
Do I make myself clear?

208
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,250
[BOTH]
Uh!

209
00:12:57,333 --> 00:13:00,583
You'd better not fail me!

210
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:03,125
[BOTH]
Right. We won't, sir.

211
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,041
[MILLENNIUM EARL]
And you too, my boy.

212
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:08,333
I understand. Just don't
call me that, all right?

213
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:10,000
[LERO]
Lero!

214
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,083
[MILLENNIUM EARL] I don't know
what brought Froi Tiedoll

215
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,875
to this country
in the first place,

216
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:16,083
but Cross Marian's
presence in Japan

217
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:18,208
gives me that sinkin' feeling.

218
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:19,833
Even after all this time,

219
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:22,791
I still can't figure what
that man's motives are.

220
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:24,875
Perhaps destiny has
brought the two of us here

221
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:27,833
at the same time for
a reason, Cross Marian.

222
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:30,375
In that case, let us
take this opportunity

223
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:33,291
to ring in a new beginning.

224
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:36,041
Now that we're all present
and accounted for.

225
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:41,375
I'll send every Akuma in Japan
to strike those Generals down!

226
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:52,875
[MILLENNIUM EARL]
Huh?

227
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,333
What's that?

228
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,125
[DEVIT] A snake?

229
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,625
[LAVI]
Eat him.

230
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,000
We should go.

231
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,125
[SKINN, JASDERO grunting]

232
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,625
[TYKI]
Look out!

233
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:14,000
[DEVIT] Holy crap.
It ate Lord Millennium!

234
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:17,416
[MILLENNIUM EARL]
I don't think so.

235
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:22,708
[MILLENNIUM EARL]
A pathetic excuse for an attack

236
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:25,750
like that wouldn't have
come from a General.

237

[DEVIT, JASDERO grunt]

238
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:31,375
Now, little rats.
Come out to play!

239
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:41,916
We won't let you anywhere
near the General. Stay back!

[ALL laughing]

241
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:45,625
[MILLENNIUM EARL]
Do you honestly think

242
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:48,208
you stand a chance against me?

243
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:50,250
So, this blowhard is the one

244
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:53,125
who calls himself the
Millennium Earl, is he?

245
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:54,541
Indeed.

246
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,208
This guy is the "Maker"?

247
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:58,625
[MILLENNIUM EARL] I'm impressed
you invaded this far,

248
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:01,125
but it's time you were
punished for it.

249
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:04,750
[LENALEE] It's him. So we've
finally come face to face.

250
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:07,083
You're not really planning
to fight them, are you?

251
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:10,000
He's got four Noahs and all
the Akuma in the country!

252
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:14,458
We are so dead right now!
A 100% dead!

253
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:18,708
Don't say that, Chome. The odds
may be stacked against us.

254
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:21,958
But still... We're not about
to fight a losing battle.

255
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:24,750
That's good.

256
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,250
But...

257
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:34,708
[CHOMESUKE] ...this is
definitely a losing battle!

258
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:37,250
Talking about it solves nothing.

259
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,833
We won't know if we can
win this until we try!

260
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:41,333
You're right, Krory.

261
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,041
So we might as well get in there

262
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:46,708
and find out how many
Akuma's we can destroy!

263

Ha, ha! I guess I don't
mind fighting you if

268
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,083
you manage to beat
these three first!

269
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,583
You can try,

270
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:04,833
but you won't get within arm's
reach of Lord Millennium!

271
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:07,166
We may be up against
Level Three Akuma...

272
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,583
...but there's no way we're
gonna back down now!

Oh, no! Are they okay?

[BOOKMAN]
Uh...

281
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,125
I take back what I said earlier!

282
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:53,250
If our attacks can't even
scratch these Akuma,

283
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:54,625
we're a thousand percent dead!

284
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:59,500

are no match for us.

285

Don't do it!

What a shame. Wasted effort.

291
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,875
Even if you combine
your power...

292
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:41,500
...it still won't be
enough to defeat us!

Go for it!

than I thought!

What did that vampire guy do?

[AKUMA C] He just made
the fire snake move faster!

299
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,166
We might not be
able to kill them,

300
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,291
but we can at least send them
flying into next week!

It's over, Noahs!

No kids are allowed inside here,
this is a private cabin.

was you, wasn't it?

319
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,625
[LAVI]
Fine by me.

320
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:18,666
Lavi...

321
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,875
Nobody else needs to interfere.

322
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:23,041
Let me take care of mole-face.

323
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:26,666
I'll beat the crap out of this
guy. Right here, right now!

324
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:27,750
What's wrong?

325
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,541
You're really that
broken up over me

326
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,333
eliminating that
little cheater?

327
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:33,625
You must've been friends,
is that right?

328
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:34,791
Shut your mouth.

329
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,291
[TYKI]
Ah, so you were friends then.

330
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:38,791
Be quiet!

331
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:41,166
[TYKI] I'm gonna take a guess
that cute girl over there

332
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,833
was a friend of his as well?

333
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,625
I said stop!

334
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:47,666
I'm so sorry.
You must be crushed.

335
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,083
I get it.

336
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:51,208
What is that called again?

337
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,541
Friendship, right?

338
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:53,875
Stop talking.

339
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,458
[TYKI]
I do sympathize.

340
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:56,666
Shut it!

341
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,625
[TYKI] It's perfectly
normal to be sad...

342
00:19:58,708 --> 00:19:59,791
[LAVI]
Damn you!

343
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,500
...when your friends die.

344
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,166
I said shut up!

345
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:07,291
[laughs] No need to be angry.

346
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:08,916
He's still alive, you know.

347
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,375
[gasps]

348
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:14,333
[TYKI] In fact, he might
even be here shortly.

349
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:20,250
However, you won't get to see
him if you're dead by then.

350
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,833
I highly doubt it'll
take too long though.

351
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:26,833
I did destroy Allen Walker's
Innocence, after all.

352
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,041
[TYKI] So if he allows
himself to be captured

353
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,541
and nearly killed by the Akuma

354
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,875
I sent after him,

355
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:36,083
it'll be soon.

356
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,833
[ALLEN]
Thanks to Fo's advice,

357
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:18,083
it looks like my Innocence

358
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:22,041
might finally be starting
to come back.

359
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:24,041
But for it to return completely,

360
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:27,958
we're still missing an important
piece of the puzzle.

361
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:31,958
On the next <i>D.Gray-man</i> :
"Silence."

362
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:35,625
[KANDA]
Huh?

363
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:36,875
Uh?

364
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:39,291
Hold on, what are you
doing in a hot spring?

365
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:41,708
It's for the fanservice,
probably.

366
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:43,375
That's what they want to see?

367
00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:44,791
Yeah.

368
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:49,625
[gasps] If it's fanservice,
we need babes!

369
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:50,958
[LAVI]
Heh!

370
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:53,541
[LENALEE, MIRANDA scream]

371
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:54,958
I was intrigued.

372
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:56,041
Come on.

373
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,916
Cut it out.
