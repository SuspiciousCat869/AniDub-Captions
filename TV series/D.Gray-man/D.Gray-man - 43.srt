1
00:01:38,416 --> 00:01:39,791
Madame Lulu Bell...

2
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:41,500
Madame Lulu Bell!

3
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:43,166
Wouldn't you like
to get out of bed...?

4
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,083
Oh won't you please wake up!

5
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:52,125
Actually... I'm awake.

6
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:54,041
Oh good, then hurry
and let's go!

7
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:57,541
All those Exorcists are still
alive and waiting for us!

8
00:01:57,625 --> 00:01:59,125
And thanks to your
awesome strategy

9
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:01,791
those goody-goodies got
split up into two groups...!

10
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:03,500
I can't wait to take
one of them out for good

11
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:06,250
and tell the Earl
what we've done!

12
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:08,125
I need to learn more about them.

13
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:09,375
You're overthinking it...

14
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:12,125
We should just get out
there and try something!

15
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:14,125
If we try and fail,

16
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:17,833
my Master won't have
any praise for me, will he?

17
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:21,291
But where are you going then?!

18
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:23,041
Madame Lulu Bell?!

19
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:24,791
I need a shower.

20
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:43,291
Madame Lulu Bell...
what are we doing?

21
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:46,666
This bridge is really scary!

22
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:53,416
What'd you stop
like that for, huh?!

23
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:01,875
I'll save it... for last.

24
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:04,625
Huh...? What does that mean?!

25
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,875
Please wait for me, Mistress!

26
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,166
I found it.

27
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,666
It doesn't work.

28
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,666
That's what I thought.

29
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,250
We could be too
far away from them

30
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:46,375
or maybe it's because we can't
get a signal in this valley...

31
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:47,708
Anyway, I don't think
we're going to be able

32
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:50,000
to communicate
through our Golems here.

33
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:51,500
What do you think we should do?

34
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:52,458
Keep moving...

35
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:53,625
We need to find a way to contact

36
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:56,083
Lavi and Lenalee as
soon as possible...

37
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,458
I'll bet if we could
get out of this Valley

38
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,458
we'd be able to
pick up a signal.

39
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:00,916
Then let's go.

40
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,625
I'm still really hungry...

41
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,708
Help us, somebody please help!

42
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:28,750
Just stay calm...

43
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:29,958
We have to pass
through this valley

44
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,625
if we want to get
to the other side!

45
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,541
Fine, then let's hurry...

46
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,416
Don't push me!

47
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:44,125
Maybe... we should try
to take it slow and easy.

48
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:46,416
Yeah, I think
that's a great idea!

49
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:53,583
Could that be...

50
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:54,458
A village...

51
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:55,666
It sure is.

52
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:08,041
This seems like a strange
location for a village.

53
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,791
But I'll bet someone here knows
how to get across the valley.

54
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,250
You're right, and with any luck,

55
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,833
we may be able to
score a meal, too...

56
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:20,000
Just tell us... What'd you
do with the statue, Selim?!

57
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,583
We won't leave you
alone until we know,

58
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,916
so unless you want to get
hurt, start talking, thief!

59
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,083
I didn't do it...!

60
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,666
You have to give me
a chance to explain!

61
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,666
Explain what...?!

62
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,000
Everything you say is a lie!

63
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:30,958
No, I'm not lying!

64
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:31,958
Stop it...!

65
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,958
Won't you at least
listen to him?

66
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,166
Don't waste your
breath, Katia...!

67
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,833
I'm sure that no one here
would believe me anyway...

68
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:39,875
Go ahead...

69
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,750
Try your best...
Come and kill me...

70
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:42,750
Do it!

71
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,083
You heard him.

72
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,625
Okay, if that's what
you really want!

73
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,000
Who's there?!

74
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,666
I haven't seen them before.

75
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,500
Hey... This doesn't
concern you...

76
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,166
Oh, I assure you,
gentlemen, we mean no harm.

77
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,916
My friend and I are
a little bit lost

78
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,875
and we're hoping you
could give us directions...

79
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,541
Yes, and maybe you could
even help us find a meal?

80
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,416
Krory, wait!

81
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:13,708
They're Akuma...
just show yourselves...

82
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:20,666
What the...

83
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:35,500
Do you see any
more of them around?

84
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,125
Not yet... I think that's all.

85
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:38,416
Oh good...

86
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,041
No...! Please don't run away!

87
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:45,916
We're never gonna eat.

88
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,458
What was that?!

89
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,541
Who are you guys...
and what are you doing here?

90
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:53,333
It's okay, there's no
reason to be afraid...

91
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,750
I don't mean to interrupt
but they're coming back.

92
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:01,833
We must kill the monsters, men!

93
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:04,041
You're right, we'll
never taste food again!

94
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,666
Let's get outta here!

95
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:12,708
They got away!

96
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:13,833
Just let 'em go...

97
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,791
No point in chasing 'em.

98
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,833
Selim...

99
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,625
It went just like we planned...

100
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:31,958
Yes...! Did ya hear that...

101
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:33,291
Everything's
working perfectly...

102
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,750
Isn't that great...

103
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:35,875
Be careful...

104
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:37,875
One who's quick to
speak of success

105
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,291
is usually quick to fail.

106
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:42,958
Our plan has just begun, Mimi.

107
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,250
Yes, I understand!

108
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,291
A stone statue moved by itself?!

109
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:53,375
Are you sure?

110
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:54,375
Positive...

111
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:55,625
It's the truth...

112
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,708
But since I'm a
wanderer no one trusts me,

113
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,666
they always assume
I'm lying to them...

114
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,958
although I suppose
they have good reason.

115
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:05,291
Selim, please, tell
us exactly what you saw.

116
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,916
It was last night...

117
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,708
I got back to
the village late...

118
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:12,083
I'd taken my time coming back
from hunting in the mountains.

119
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:20,083
Hey, what's the matter, Tannon?

120
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,291
No... but that's impossible...

121
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,833
Statues can't move like that!

122
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,791
Even though I saw her
do it with my own eyes...

123
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,000
I still can't believe
that something

124
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,833
made of stone could
walk out here like that.

125
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:10,541
But that's what happened...!
I did not take the statue!

126
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,625
Well, it's certainly
an intriguing story.

127
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,500
You shouldn't be surprised
that ordinary people

128
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,375
don't believe such
things are possible.

129
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:20,125
So you mean...
Do you guys believe me?

130
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:22,125
Right now, we're most
interested in whatever

131
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,291
is causing the
statue to move around.

132
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:25,916
There were Akuma back there...

133
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,583
Do you know of--

134
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,583
What are you doing out here?!

135
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:32,708
That's the girl
from the village!

136
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,500
Let her go... I know her...

137
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,375
Selim!

138
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,375
Pardon me!

139
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,208
There's plenty of meat here,
if you'd like some more.

140
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,791
It's delicious!

141
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:49,666
Yeah, thank you very much!

142
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,625
Katia's father happens to
be the mayor of our village

143
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,750
and she's always
getting in the way.

144
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:56,958
For a long time now,

145
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:58,375
all of the villagers
have believed

146
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:01,250
that the stone statue's
like our guardian angel...

147
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,958
and that as long as
it was in our possession

148
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:05,166
the land would
always be peaceful.

149
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,791
So you can understand
why my father

150
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,250
and the other men became worried

151
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:10,166
when they learned
it had disappeared.

152
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,750
Selim said he'd seen it walking

153
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:14,500
into the mountains and in
their fear they blamed him...

154
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:17,458
And what about you, do you
believe I'm a liar, too, Katia?

155
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:19,875
No, I've always believed in you!

156
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:23,000
Listen to me... you're
not a bad person, Selim!

157
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,583
Quit lecturing me...

158
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,208
You act like
my sister or something.

159
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:32,333
Selim showed up at our
village only a short time ago

160
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:33,916
and my father and
the other villagers

161
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,083
don't trust him very much.

162
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:38,750
Oh, I see... That doesn't
help things, does it?

163
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,000
By the way, I was wondering

164
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:41,791
what brought you to our village?

165
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,875
We only came to
ask for directions.

166
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,166
We're trying to
cross through the valley

167
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,250
and end up on the
other side of the mountains.

168
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:48,791
Why didn't you say so,
past the village,

169
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,208
you'll see a
suspension bridge...

170
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,500
If you cross it you'll
be on the other side

171
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:53,916
of the mountain in no time.

172
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,041
Oh, thank you...!

173
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:57,041
That's incredibly
helpful... isn't it?

174
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,125
Yes, it is...

175
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,625
But it looks like,

176
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:02,208
we shouldn't leave this
village behind just yet.

177
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:05,041
Yes... do you suspect
it's Innocence as well?

178
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,583
A legendary stone
statue suddenly

179
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,458
begins moving around by itself

180
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:11,666
and Akuma are starting to
appear at a nearby village...

181
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,750
Yeah, I'd say it's very possible
we're dealing with Innocence.

182
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,000
What's Innocence?

183
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,250
It's something that's
extremely valuable to us

184
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:21,958
and it causes mysterious
phenomena whenever it's around.

185
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,958
Besides, now that
Akuma are in the area

186
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:25,791
we can't abandon
the villagers...

187
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,291
We have to stick around
and get to the bottom

188
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,250
of what's happening
with this statue.

189
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:30,791
Thank you so much...!

190
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:33,916
If we find the statue then we
can prove Selim's innocence!

191
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:35,791
Just leave it to us...

192
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,750
We owe you for the
meal, anyway, don't we?

193
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:39,333
That's true!

194
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:45,458
It's this way...

195
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,291
I'm sure I saw the
statue take this path...

196
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:48,708
Just follow me.

197
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,583
Listen, Selim, this is probably
going to be dangerous.

198
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:54,916
Yes, it's very likely we'll be
running into more Akuma

199
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,166
and it'd be much safer
if you waited here.

200
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,583
But I can't...!

201
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,791
The paths up here are winding
and hard to navigate...

202
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,583
Without me guiding
you, you'll get lost

203
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:05,833
and we won't be able
to find the statue.

204
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:06,333
We can't let you--

205
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:07,333
No...!

206
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:08,583
Don't you see?

207
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:09,750
If I bring the statue
back to the villagers

208
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:11,875
then maybe they'll
begin to trust me...!

209
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:13,875
Right, Katia?!

210
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,750
It's risky...

211
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:20,666
I know that, but I have
to come with you, please!

212
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:23,541
Alright, lead the way...

213
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,000
But if we get into
any fighting up there,

214
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:27,000
I want you to promise
me you'll stay down...

215
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:29,375
You got it... Thank you, Allen!

216
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:30,958
Now stay close, okay?

217
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,291
Selim!

218
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:33,541
What is it?

219
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:36,708
Just be careful okay...

220
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,708
Yeah...

221
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,875
And let the games begin.

222
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:09,000
Oh, good... You're awake.

223
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,500
Yeah... Where are we?

224
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,916
In a carriage.

225
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,041
In a larger sense, we're
on our way to meet Bookman.

226
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:20,041
The plan is to get you
healed as soon as possible...

227
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:22,666
Then we can get
back to our mission.

228
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,250
I'm sorry, Lavi.

229
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:31,208
Hey... did you ever get in
touch with Allen and Krory?

230
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:33,625
Uh-uh, I wasn't
able to get through...

231
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,250
There's no signal and
I think all of the mountains

232
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:36,375
around here are preventing us

233
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:38,291
from connecting
through the Golem.

234
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,250
Oh, I hope they're okay.

235
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:41,958
Well now, as long
as they stay together

236
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:43,458
I'm sure they'll be fine...

237
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:44,666
As a matter of fact...

238
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,500
I can almost hear 'em
whining right now...

239
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:49,125
Twenty bucks says
they're starving.

240
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:50,583
Probably right...

241
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,083
For now, we need
to just concentrate

242
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:55,166
on getting you well again,
young lady, so we can join 'em.

243
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:00,458
Allen, Krory...

244
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,208
Where are you?

245
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:04,833
These rocks are incredible!

246
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,000
I know...

247
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,416
over the years, rainwater
and the elements

248
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,916
have eroded them and
created this terrain...

249
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,875
It's easy to get lost out
here so we have to be careful.

250
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:15,208
What's wrong?

251
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:16,708
I see it over there!

252
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:21,958
So that's it...

253
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,250
That's what you saw, Selim?

254
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,250
That's her, there's
no mistaking it.

255
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,041
Then let's follow her, quickly!

256
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:35,291
What's that?

257
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,875
They're the ancient ruins...

258
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:38,416
This may be the biggest...

259
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,916
It was an old temple
or something.

260
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,833
They fell for it...! Let's go...

261
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:08,708
Things are going just as
Madame Lulu Bell planned!

262
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:13,541
If a legendary stone statue
were to start to move...

263
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:15,916
What do you suppose
people would think?

264
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,916
Well, I guess they'd have a hard
time believing it at first...

265
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,166
They'd probably think their eyes
were playing tricks on them.

266
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,125
Yes... but then...

267
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:25,916
...there are other people
who see things differently.

268
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,500
Who would that be?

269
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,708
Exorcists, of course.

270
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,416
I see now!

271
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,333
Madame Lulu Bell?

272
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:38,125
The Excorcists are always
seeking Innocence...

273
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:41,333
This trap will prove
irresistible to them.

274
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,125
And then...

275
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,333
Leave the rest to me.

276
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,291
Just a little longer...

277
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:55,375
Wait for Madame
Lulu Bell to give the signal!

278
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,208
This place is full of statues!

279
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:01,416
Where do you suppose the one
we're looking for is hiding?

280
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,791
There it is!

281
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:13,708
They've come.

282
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,500
Be careful!

283
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:31,208
Don't worry...

284
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:32,416
Everything seems fine!

285
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,958
Ready...

286
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:37,916
And go!

287
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:40,500
Whoa, what's going on?!

288
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,166
I dunno, just be ready!

289
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:02,708
Allen, are you alright?!

290
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,416
Missed my chance!

291
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,250
Oh no, it didn't work...!

292
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:08,583
Everyone kill them!

293
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:12,291
Selim, take cover!

294
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:15,083
My my... This will
be quite a feast!

295
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,750
There's so many of them!

296
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,458
Nice work, thanks!

297
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:47,000
Are you alright?

298
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:48,583
Yeah, thanks to you!

299
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,458
Wait, where are you going...?

300
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,625
Do you have another plan?

301
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:12,750
I quit.

302
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,583
What?!

303
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,625
There's no point in
fighting any more

304
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:17,500
so I'm going back.

305
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:18,750
Hey, wait a second!.

306
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:20,291
You can't just change
your mind like that...!

307
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:24,625
You're acting like a cat you
know, but then, you are a cat.

308
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,958
Retreat! Fall back now!

309
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:35,458
Our enemies are getting away!

310
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:38,916
Damn...

311
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,750
Hey... where are you guys?!

312
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,208
Come over this way...

313
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:43,916
I think I found her!

314
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:49,250
Back here.

315
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:51,750
The real one?

316
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,625
It sure is... This is her...

317
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:56,416
She's the village's
guardian angel.

318
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,666
Everyone will be so
happy she's been found

319
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,708
and peace will return
to the people here.

320
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,833
Allen... why do you
think the Akuma retreated

321
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,541
in the middle of a battle?

322
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:44,708
I don't know...

323
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:46,291
Maybe they thought
they couldn't defeat us,

324
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:49,166
but by using that statue
they had us trapped,

325
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,916
so it doesn't
make much sense.

326
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,833
I don't understand it, either.

327
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:54,291
Hey, look, there it is!.

328
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,125
It's just like Selim told us!

329
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,458
This bridge gives us a
way to cross the valley,

330
00:19:58,541 --> 00:19:59,791
and once we're over
the mountain range

331
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,333
we should be able to
contact Lavi and Lenalee...!

332
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,041
C'mon!

333
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,333
They destroyed it...

334
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:26,583
Damn them...!

335
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:28,041
They're obviously hoping
to keep us stranded here

336
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:30,750
by any way possible!

337
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,083
What is it, is something wrong?

338
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:39,208
Oh... Just thought
I saw something...

339
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,791
Well, at least we were able
to delay our enemies for now.

340
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,833
Taking out the bridge
bought us some time

341
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:48,708
before they got
together with the others...

342
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:51,833
Good strategy, Madame Lulu Bell!

343
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:55,458
Yes, I know, failure isn't
any fun at all, is it...?

344
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:58,916
We'll have to make sure
we succeed next time, then.

345
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:40,791
Lavi continues on his journey,

346
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:43,583
faithfully protecting
our injured comrade...

347
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:48,250
while silently, the evil hand of
an assassin closes in on him...

348
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:52,750
Next time on D.Gray-man:
"Iron Fan Maid."

349
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:56,166
Bring forth salvation to
this tormented Akuma's soul!
