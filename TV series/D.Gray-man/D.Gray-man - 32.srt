1
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:41,083
Wait... Where are all the ships?

2
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:42,125
Gone...

3
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:43,500
They only come
every other day now,

4
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:46,083
so you'll have to
wait 'til tomorrow.

5
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:47,375
I heard there were
passenger ships

6
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:49,125
in and out of here every day.

7
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:51,791
There aren't enough
ships for all that anymore.

8
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:53,666
Not since so many
of them have been

9
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,833
sinking like stones
in the waters near here.

10
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:58,416
They're sinking...?
But what's causing it?

11
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,000
Its pirates, that's what!

12
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:01,583
You know it's pirates...!

13
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:03,000
We told you so!

14
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:04,291
Pirates?

15
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:05,833
You brats and your stories...!

16
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:08,833
Keep telling lies like that and
it'll come back to haunt ya!

17
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:10,708
I don't really care if you
believe me or not...!

18
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:12,708
Pirates are
responsible for this!

19
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:14,208
You punks...

20
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:15,458
That's enough!

21
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:20,875
One of these days
I'm finally gonna get

22
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:23,000
my hands on those
lying little kids.

23
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:25,125
There aren't any real pirates?

24
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:29,125
Our coral reefs do more
damage than any pirates...

25
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:30,916
And there are lots
of rocks that are tough

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,166
for even the most
experienced sailors

27
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,208
to navigate around,
even in daylight.

28
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:38,041
Of course at night
it's nearly impossible.

29
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,541
No one who's crashed
there has ever survived.

30
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:43,000
But those kids and
their imaginations.

31
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:44,083
I'm in a bit of a hurry,

32
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:45,958
aren't there any
ships available today?

33
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,333
It's like I told ya...

34
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:49,125
Ships come every other day.

35
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:52,125
Well, I guess...

36
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:55,583
I'm staying here tonight.

37
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,375
Sure, you can find a room.

38
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:10,416
Matter of fact, I've got
one available right here...

39
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,291
I'll let you have it for cheap.

40
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:14,041
I'll take it. Thanks a lot.

41
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:15,208
Guest rooms are upstairs...

42
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:17,750
They're all empty,
so take your pick.

43
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:22,666
Fruit ahoy! Charge!

44
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,833
Watch who you're
messing with, old man!

45
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:33,041
I told you that food
is for paying customers!

46
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,583
Your stupid rules don't
apply to pirates like us!

47
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:36,916
Pirates, huh...?

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,125
You don't look like any
pirates I've seen before.

49
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:41,125
Yeah, well I bet
you've never even seen

50
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:43,041
a pirate at all,
you land lubber.

51
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,958
Now!

52
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,250
We'll get you for this!

53
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:50,416
Sorry sir...

54
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,541
Don't those kids
ever take a day off?

55
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:53,583
Doubtful...

56
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,083
So whose kids are they?

57
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:56,583
The leader's mine.

58
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:57,958
The rest follow him around

59
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:00,083
because he's loud
and they're dumb.

60
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:02,375
They go around calling
themselves pirates

61
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:04,416
just to get under
their parents' skin...

62
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,500
A typical rebellious
phase, you know.

63
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,375
Let's hope so...

64
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,208
Three hundred twenty...!

65
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:13,125
Three hundred twenty-one...

66
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,666
Three hundred twenty-two...

67
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,166
Three hundred twenty-three...

68
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,500
I hope I can find Master soon.

69
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:24,041
Ow!

70
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,541
That stings!

71
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:26,625
I know that Archie...

72
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:28,125
But it's good for
treating bruises.

73
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:29,333
I thought this time we'd be able

74
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:31,583
to steal some food
from my dad for sure.

75
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:34,125
The problem is we don't have
enough members to be scary.

76
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:37,541
Your dad wouldn't act so
tough if we had another pirate!

77
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,416
Another pirate, huh?

78
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,583
Yeah, but they can't be
any younger than we are...!

79
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:44,083
We're marauding pirates,
not babysitters.

80
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:45,541
And they can't
be an adult either,

81
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:48,000
or else they won't do
whatever we tell 'em to.

82
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:49,416
It has to be someone
that can hold

83
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,000
their own in a
battle with the enemy.

84
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,291
And a boy 'cause
girls can't be pirates.

85
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,500
Sure...

86
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,166
But where can we find
somebody like that?

87
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,000
I've got an idea...

88
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,083
What about that guy?

89
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:02,333
Four hundred five...

90
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:03,916
Four hundred six...

91
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,208
He isn't younger than us.

92
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:06,958
And he's not old, either.

93
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,583
Looks pretty strong to me!

94
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,208
Definitely a guy.

95
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:12,041
Four hundred and eleven...

96
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,916
Four hundred and twelve...

97
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,791
Four hundred and thirteen...

98
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,833
Four hundred and fourteen...

99
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,208
Four hundred and fifteen...

100
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,416
Four hundred and sixteen...

101
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,791
Hey, Tim...! Where'd you go?

102
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,166
You looking for this?

103
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,708
Timcanpy...

104
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:36,958
If this is a joke,
it isn't very funny.

105
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,916
Swirling Current Arch!

106
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,041
Bob...! The Hurricane!

107
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,208
Call me Chitta the Belly!

108
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:44,916
Calculator Dan!

109
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,166
And I'm Eagle-Eye Eric!

110
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,458
Together we are
the Abochidae Pirates!

111
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,041
You will fear our wrath!

112
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:52,458
Abochidae...?

113
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:55,875
They combined the first
sound in each of their names...

114
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:56,791
Wow.

115
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,458
And what's your name, huh?

116
00:05:58,541 --> 00:05:59,250
Allen.

117
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:00,541
Congratulations, Allen...!

118
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:02,000
You've been selected
as a candidate

119
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,791
to potentially join the
dreaded Abochidae Pirates!

120
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,583
Isn't that awesome?!

121
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,666
A candidate for a pirate crew?

122
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,291
If you prove yourself worthy
by passing a series of tests,

123
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:13,041
we'll allow you
to join our ranks.

124
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:14,166
Lucky!

125
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,583
Well...

126
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,875
I appreciate the offer
but I think I'll have to pass.

127
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,750
If you ever want to see
your little buddy again,

128
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,750
then I think you might
want to reconsider.

129
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:24,291
I'm sorry, but--

130
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:24,833
Huh?

131
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,625
He's gone!

132
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:30,500
It's just that I'm not in the
mood for games right now.

133
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:33,875
May I please have Tim back...

134
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:34,875
Bob catch...

135
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:37,833
I got it! I got it!

136
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:39,875
Tough luck, buddy...!

137
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:41,333
If you think you can
outrun Bob the Hurricane,

138
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,375
you've got another thing coming!

139
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:46,500
And if I can outrun you?

140
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:47,708
This guy's unbelievable!

141
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:50,750
Nobody in town
can keep up with me!

142
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,625
I am asking nicely you know!

143
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:55,208
Chitta! Catch!

144
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,375
Got it...

145
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,375
Never fear!

146
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,833
Chitta the Belly
to the rescue...!

147
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:00,291
If you want your
little friend back,

148
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:02,875
you're gonna have to beat
me in an eating contest!

149
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:10,083
Ready... set, go!

150
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,416
Good luck...!

151
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,916
I've never lost
once in my whole--

152
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,250
If there's nothing else,
can I have Tim back?

153
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,875
You cheated!

154
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:27,083
Dan!

155
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:28,583
Calculator Dan...!

156
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:30,416
If you can come up with the
answer to this math problem

157
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,333
before I can, I promise you
can have your friend back.

158
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:36,541
Let's see here...

159
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:39,375
58 plus 25, carry the
three, multiply the...

160
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:40,416
The answer's 83.

161
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,625
No way...! But...!

162
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,500
Eric!

163
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:46,791
It's my turn now...!

164
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:49,041
Whichever one of us can
make the ugliest face

165
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,041
can keep this thing...

166
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:51,250
Okay.

167
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:55,041
You win...! Archie!

168
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,750
Congratulations on
making it this far.

169
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:09,041
I didn't realize
I was doing anything.

170
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:10,666
But you're not a
member just yet...

171
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,708
You still have to prove yourself

172
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,333
in one final
challenge against me...

173
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:17,791
Whoever can swim to that
rock first is the winner.

174
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,375
Ready... go!

175
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,375
Might as well keep
playing along...

176
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,416
Here we go...

177
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:33,583
Beat this!

178
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,333
What? But how?!

179
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,416
It's about time I settled this.

180
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,083
No!

181
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:53,041
Oh no... Look out...

182
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:09,833
Arch!

183
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,791
Archie!

184
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:15,875
I'm all right.

185
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:17,583
Maybe I shouldn't
have done that.

186
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,750
No one's ever beat Swirling
Current Archie before!

187
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:22,583
I didn't beat him...

188
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,458
Arch lost to me on purpose.

189
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:25,666
Huh?!

190
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,333
Wha--?!

191
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:27,708
To test my bravery,

192
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:30,041
he pretended to drown to
see if I'd try to save him.

193
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:31,583
Of course...

194
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:35,333
If he really wanted to race
me I wouldn't stand a chance.

195
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:37,291
Yeah! I planned the whole thing!

196
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,041
That is so cool!

197
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:41,958
I knew it!

198
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:42,958
Allen Walker...

199
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,458
Welcome to the
Abochidae Pirates.

200
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:47,541
Me?

201
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,500
Let's hear it for
our new member!

202
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,583
But... I wasn't trying to join!

203
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,083
Yeah...! Cool!

204
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:56,250
Now I don't want you

205
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:57,750
to start thinkin'
I owe you or anything...

206
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:00,125
I had an off day,
it happens to everybody...

207
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:03,208
But the next time we race
it'll be the real deal!

208
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,041
Uh... huh...

209
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,583
Pretty incredible, isn't it?

210
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:38,041
Yeah...! It's definitely
a meal for a working man!

211
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:39,916
A working man...?
Yeah, that's a laugh...

212
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,500
Cooking and cleaning
doesn't sound much

213
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,458
like a man's work to me!

214
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:45,041
What'd you just say?!

215
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,333
You used to be a sailor...!

216
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:49,250
Now you're just a shopkeeper!

217
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,166
Sit down and finish your food!

218
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,958
I lost my appetite.

219
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:58,416
What was that?

220
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,208
It's none of your business.

221
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,958
The kid seems to have
taken a liking to you...

222
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,083
I hope he's not too
much of a bother...

223
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:14,250
No... Not at all.

224
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:15,416
It's okay...

225
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,375
He gets his crudeness
from his old man.

226
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:18,916
I'm sorry about that...

227
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,291
Sorry you've got to put up with

228
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,125
all that pirate
nonsense of his...

229
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,791
If only his mother
were still alive,

230
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:26,791
maybe he wouldn't have turned
out so rough around the edges.

231
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:29,333
Arch mentioned that
you used to be a sailor?

232
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:30,875
Oh, yeah...

233
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:33,416
I've taken fish out of every
ocean on the face of the planet!

234
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,458
Every day I put my life on
the line to bring in a catch...

235
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:39,333
And I loved every minute of it.

236
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:42,875
If you loved it
then why did you stop?

237
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:46,916
It wasn't an easy
choice for me to make.

238
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,291
I miss the sea but
my life's on land, now.

239
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:55,333
A single father
and his only son...

240
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:59,291
Maybe that's the reason
Jid decided to stop sailing.

241
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:17,541
You're late!

242
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:25,708
This cave is our top-secret
pirate headquarters.

243
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:32,750
Archie... Allen...

244
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,625
You came.

245
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:37,958
We're building a ship...

246
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:40,375
And once we finally get it
finished we'll be unstoppable!

247
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,625
We're gonna sail
right into the ocean!

248
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:47,083
And we'll kill every one
of those stinkin' pirates!

249
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,166
What pirates?

250
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,708
There really are
pirates around here;

251
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:53,291
we saw 'em with our own eyes!

252
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,541
One night we all
gathered right here

253
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:58,291
in this cave to
watch the ships come in.

254
00:12:58,375 --> 00:12:59,833
From here you can see
the ships coming down

255
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:03,333
the channel way
before anybody else can.

256
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,916
Most ships come in
sometime in the afternoon...

257
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,750
But this one had been
riding out a storm,

258
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:11,291
so it didn't make it back
until it was really late.

259
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,833
All of a sudden
the wind picked up.

260
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:37,000
We ran back to town and told
every grown-up we could find.

261
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,208
Because we're kids they thought
we made the whole thing up!

262
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:42,291
That's why we're gonna go out
and find the pirates ourselves.

263
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,875
We'll show everybody we were
right and they were wrong!

264
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,916
They're really
serious about this.

265
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,791
We're the only ones
that can stop them.

266
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,083
It's up to us
to rescue the town!

267
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,083
But we can't do it
without your help!

268
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,250
Please, Allen!

269
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,708
If these kids are right...

270
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:59,458
But still--

271
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,583
Fighting pirates is
a pretty big job,

272
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:03,916
but your dad's an
experienced sailor...

273
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,791
Maybe he'll have a few ideas.

274
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:09,916
Don't talk about my old man!

275
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,333
Archie...

276
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:15,000
He used to be a sailor,
but he gave up!

277
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,875
If you think we should
ask that quitter for help,

278
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:19,708
maybe you don't
belong here...! Get out!

279
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:20,791
Archie!

280
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,333
Out!

281
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:27,458
If you're ever in the
neighborhood again,

282
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,333
feel free to stop on by.

283
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:30,416
I will.

284
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,250
I apologize again about Arch...

285
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,416
For him and his friends to
cause you all that trouble,

286
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,625
then not even come
to see you off...

287
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,791
I didn't turn out to
be much of a pirate.

288
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,375
What?

289
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:44,250
I don't know, just
rambling I guess, sorry...

290
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:45,583
It's finished...!

291
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:47,500
Those pirates don't stand
a chance against us now!

292
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,125
All right!

293
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:50,166
Come on, you guys...

294
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,416
Let's go!

295
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,791
Yeah!

296
00:14:58,208 --> 00:14:59,291
Hi, it's Allen.

297
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,083
I know I'm already
running a day behind,

298
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,750
but there should be
another ship along any minute.

299
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:06,000
I'm relieved you
called to check in with me.

300
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,500
Several ships have reportedly
gone missing in that area...

301
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:09,541
There are so many similar cases

302
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,833
it could hardly
be a coincidence.

303
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:14,625
A deluxe passenger ship went
missing yesterday, in fact.

304
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:16,250
A passenger ship...?

305
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,750
It couldn't have been--

306
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,000
Hey...! You kids!
Come back here...

307
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:23,125
Jid?

308
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:24,458
Arch!

309
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:25,583
Hey, Archie...

310
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,291
Your dad looks even
madder than usual.

311
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:28,958
Let the old man be
as mad as he wants.

312
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,833
See if I care.

313
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:40,625
Oh no... There's an
Akuma on board that ship!

314
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,125
What's that?

315
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,541
That's the same
pirate ship from before!

316
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:50,916
What do we do?

317
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,875
We destroy them, that's what!

318
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,541
Quick, I need a boat!

319
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,875
Your son and his friends
are in grave danger!

320
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:01,083
Archie?

321
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:03,583
That passenger ship
is under enemy fire!

322
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,208
We need a boat!

323
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:14,791
What was that?

324
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:15,541
It's a reef...

325
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:16,791
We've run aground

326
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,833
and now we're sitting
ducks for those pirates!

327
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:21,958
Die, die, die!

328
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,083
This is bad...
This is really bad!

329
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:26,000
We'll use our secret weapon!

330
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,750
Wait for it... Fire!

331
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:39,166
Yeah...! That oughta show him!

332
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:42,166
That actually kinda scared me...

333
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,833
Take that!

334
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:50,541
Allen!

335
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,500
 Old man?

336
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,375
What's going on with your hand?

337
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:00,875
I'll explain everything later...

338
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,125
Right now I need
you to get these kids

339
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:05,041
to safety while
I take care of that ship.

340
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,583
An Exorcist, huh?

341
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:10,083
So you're the one who's been
attacking all those ships!

342
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,791
Guilty as charged!

343
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,875
It's a great way to kill
a lot of people at once

344
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:16,125
and move up another level!

345
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:17,791
Not if I can do
anything about it!

346
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:22,250
Where is it...?
Where's the Akuma?

347
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,083
Is it on the deck...?
Wait, no...!

348
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:27,500
The entire ship is an Akuma?

349
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,583
Took you long enough!

350
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:38,750
Ah, that was close...!
Try this on for size!

351
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,541
Fire!

352
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:52,541
Not bad...!
But take that...! And that!

353
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:59,083
Hurry!

354
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,791
We have to protect a
fellow pirate in danger!

355
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,250
I'm coming, boy!

356
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,166
Dad...! No!

357
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,666
Old man...

358
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:27,333
Arch!

359
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:29,000
Dad! Please don't die!

360
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:30,791
I'm not gonna die...

361
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:34,625
Not while you still need
me to take care of you.

362
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,958
I tried to care
for your mother also.

363
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:38,875
But by the time we
realized she was sick,

364
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,416
it was too late.

365
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,208
When she died, I got
scared I might lose

366
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:46,541
my little boy,
so I quit sailing.

367
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,875
I promised myself that day,

368
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,500
I'd be by your side until
you were a grown man...

369
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:52,333
To guide and protect you...

370
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,375
Like your mom would have wanted.

371
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,583
Old man...

372
00:18:56,666 --> 00:19:00,166
I had no idea you gave up
sailing because of me.

373
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,125
When you gave me this
telescope for my birthday,

374
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,291
all I wanted was to grow up

375
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:06,166
and be a sailor just
like my old man was.

376
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,291
Then all of a sudden you quit.

377
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,250
Because you said
you were scared...

378
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,791
I never felt so
betrayed in my life.

379
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,083
But the only reason you quit was

380
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,500
so you could stay
and protect me...

381
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:17,916
I'm sorry.

382
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:20,166
Archie!

383
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:22,875
Allen!

384
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,166
Aw, what's the matter?

385
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,708
Trouble keeping up?

386
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:32,875
I can't keep this
up much longer...

387
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:36,583
I've got to attack the
Akuma ship directly!

388
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:39,208
Come on you guys, one
of our own is in trouble!

389
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:40,208
I'm in.

390
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:41,125
For family!

391
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:42,541
For our friends!

392
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:45,791
To save the town from evil!

393
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:47,916
A ship's weakest
point is it's bridge...

394
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,333
See if you can hit it!

395
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:51,000
No problem!

396
00:19:53,625 --> 00:20:00,250
And fire!

397
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:01,291
You again!

398
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:02,916
A smoke bomb, huh?

399
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,500
You'll have to do a lot better
than that if you want to a--

400
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,833
Aw, crap!

401
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,375
It took three days to repair...

402
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,250
But she's finally ready to sail.

403
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:40,500
Allen!

404
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:42,333
Hey!

405
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:51,125
Jid has finally taken
up sailing again...

406
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,291
And he's got five
young apprentices.

407
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,625
I guess there's only
one thing left to do...

408
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,083
Meet up with Lenalee...

409
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,125
And look for
my master, of course.

410
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:41,625
After entering
"The Forest of No Return,"

411
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:44,041
Kanda finds an
eerie little village,

412
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:46,750
completely hidden
from the outside world.

413
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,791
On the next episode
of D. Gray-man:

414
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:51,250
"The Village Where
a Witch Lives."

415
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:52,750
Part one of two...

416
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:56,083
Bring forth salvation to
this tormented Akuma's soul!
