1
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:40,125
And the one question
I want answered

2
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:43,291
is whether or not Allen Walker
is working for the enemy.

3
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:44,666
Whose side is he on?

4
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,416
Are you doubting one of our own?

5
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,291
[ROUVELIER]
Anyone is capable of duplicitous

6
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,250
and heretical machinations,

7
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:53,208
regardless of their
ranking as an Exorcist.

8
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:56,166
Go on, Director.
Investigate all you want.

9
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,291
Excuse me, General?

10
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:00,458
As far as Allen goes,

11
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:02,500
do whatever you feel
is appropriate.

12
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:05,791
What the hell are you saying,
Cross? Don't do this!

13
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,958
Very well then,
General Cross Marian.

14
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,583
Pleased to meet you.

15
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:21,250
Director Rouvelier has assigned
me to your guard detail.

16
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:24,208
I'm Howard Link, an
Inspector for the Order.

17
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:25,708
[LAVI]
Hm?

18
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:26,583
[ALLEN]
Huh?

19
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:27,833
[LENALEE]
Hm?

20
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:29,916
As a small gesture of
good will between us,

21
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,541
I baked you a pumpkin pie.

22
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:33,583
I do hope you like it.

23
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:34,750
[gasps]

24
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,250
Thanks! Good will accepted!

25
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:41,458
[LINK]
Glad to hear it.

26
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:43,500
Wait, you don't even
know who this guy is!

27
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:46,458
Did you even hear him
say he's your guard?

28
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:51,291
[LENALEE]
Tell me where my brother is!

29
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:53,666
[REEVER]
Uh. Lenalee! Wait!

30
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,083
[LENALEE]
Komui!

31
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:57,541
What's going on? Why does
Allen have a guard detail?

32
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:59,500
Not a good time!

33
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,583
[ROUVELIER]
Oh?

34
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,583
How nice to see you, Lenalee.

35
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:11,041
How do your legs feel?
Any improvement?

36
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:15,250
I didn't know...
you were here.

37
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:20,333
[ROUVELIER] Oh, Lenalee.
What're we going to do with you?

38
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:23,458
There's no running away
from the Order, child,

39
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:25,583
so please stop trying.

40
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,916
[ROUVELIER]
Now. You come to me.

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,166
Come.

42
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:36,291
It appears as though I'll be
here for an extended visit.

43
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:39,250
I'll also need to study your
Innocence at some point soon,

44
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,750
so please do cooperate.

45
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,541
[REEVER]
Dammit. I wasn't fast enough.

46
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,500
[ROUVELIER]
Oh. One other thing.

47
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:54,875
Here, would you care to try

48
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:57,625
my latest confectionery
creation before you go?

49
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:00,125
[KOMUI]
Whoa, that looks delicious!

50
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:03,166
Can I please try a little taste?

51
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,458
Yeah, the Director's cakes
are out of this world!

52
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:06,875
[KOMUI laughing]

53
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:08,333
[KOMUI]
Off with you now, Lenalee.

54
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,458
You need to run along
for your check up!

55
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,666
It is time for that!

56
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,583
Well, come on, Lenalee,
I'll walk you down!

57
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:14,666
[KOMUI laughs nervously]

58
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,708
[KOMUI]
Thanks, Reever! Wow, what a guy!

59
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:21,833
[KOMUI laughs nervously]

60
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:30,000
[REEVER]
Sorry about that. You okay?

61
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,041
[REEVER] Crap, I should've
had a guard on the door.

62
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:33,583
I didn't even think
about the experience

63
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,333
she had with him as a kid.

64
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:37,916
Ah, jeez, I'm such an idiot.

65
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,041
Section Leader Reever.

66
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:46,125
Why? Why do they have
a guard on Allen?

67
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:49,500
And what is Rouvelier
even doing here?

68
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:50,958
[ROUVELIER]
It's rather apparent Lenalee

69
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:54,583
still hasn't forgiven me,
even after all these years.

70
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:57,416
I could see it in her
eyes quite clearly.

71
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:04,541
[KOMUI] Let's return to the
matter at hand, Director.

72
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:07,791
So why are you guarding me?
Can you tell me that much?

73
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,208
It was the decision
of Director Rouvelier.

74
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:12,333
However, there is
the possibility

75
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:13,875
your surveillance
could be lifted,

76
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:16,833
depending on your answers
to this questionnaire.

77
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,791
I have plenty of questions
to ask you as well,

78
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:21,541
but I'll save them
for the library.

79
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,583
Why couldn't we do all
this in the cafeteria?

80
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,833
I'm capable of answering
questions in there.

81
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:28,041
I barely got to touch my food.

82
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:31,416
It was far too noisy in there
for us to properly concentrate.

83
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,833
That is not the
library, Mr. Walker!

84
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,083
Really? Guess I got
turned around.

85
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:39,333
[CROSS] Are you serious?
Who bought this cheap booze?

86
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,083
Oh, great.

87
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:44,625
[CROSS] They really expect
me to drink this swill?

88
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:47,375
You bastards are supposed
to be my caretakers!

89
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:51,041
So take care of me and go buy
me some decent booze right now!

90
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:52,958
[AGENT A] The Director gave
us very strict orders

91
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:55,333
to keep you on a tight budget.

92
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:56,833
Could you bother
to explain to me

93
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:58,833
why you need me here
to drink with you?

94
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,291
'Cause there's nothin'
better than drinkin'

95
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:02,541
with a beautiful
woman, that's why.

96
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,291
Four years since I've seen you,

97
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:07,125
and you are just as gorgeous
as the first time I saw you.

98
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:10,291
And you're just as much of
a hopeless deviant, as ever.

99
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:11,333
[CROSS yelps]

100
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:16,458
If it isn't my dumb pupil.
What's the big idea?

101
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,666
That's exactly what
I wanted to ask you,

102
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,541
but I can see the only idea
in your head was to get drunk.

103
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:23,875
All right, Allen, wha'dya want?

104
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:26,333
[ALLEN] Did you really
just ask me what I want?

105
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:27,708
Okay, take it easy.

106
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:30,041
Is this about the sheet music?

107
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm sorry about this, Allen.

108
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:35,500
[LINK]
You and General Cross Marian

109
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,833
are forbidden to
speak, understand?

110
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:40,708
What? Why not? What's the deal?

111
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:43,458
Hang on! Hey, Master!

112
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:47,250
What is this? Why
can't I talk to him?

113
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:49,041
It's a direct command
of the Order.

114
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,375
[ALLEN]
The Order?

115
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:53,041
I don't get it, why do they
wanna keep us apart?

116
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:54,958
I was waiting to tell you
this in the library,

117
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,750
but since you're
making a scene...

118
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,583
You're under suspicion for your
involvement with the Fourteenth.

119
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:00,791
[gasps]

120
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:10,666
[ALLEN]
Wait. The Fourteenth?

121
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,291
Well, it looks as though
that name rang a bell.

122
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:14,750
No, um. Not at all.

123
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:17,083
Very well, then. Follow me.

124
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,291
I'll provide you
with the details.

125
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,875
We'll see if I can't
jog your memory.

126
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,125
[LINK]
The Fourteenth was a Noah

127
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:30,708
who happened to be
murdered by his own clan.

128
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:33,416
His real name is unknown to us.

129
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,166
All of our historical
records state

130
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,333
that there were originally
only thirteen Noah

131
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,458
that lived throughout
the past few millennia.

132
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:42,541
He was mysteriously born
sometime in the recent past.

133
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:46,333
Due to these reasons, we only
know him as the Fourteenth.

134
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:49,500
Any of this starting to
sound familiar to you yet?

135
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:54,208
[ROUVELIER] As recorded
in the document you hold,

136
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,375
we know the Fourteenth
was killed by his own.

137
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:57,875
Although,

138
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:00,000
there is a scattered group that
have dedicated themselves

139
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,916
to his posthumous cause.

140
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,500
Is that so?

141
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,208
[ROUVELIER] We don't know the
exact number of these adherents.

142
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,250
But we do know that
General Marian Cross

143
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,583
ranks as one of them.

144
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:11,250
That can't be true.

145
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:12,833
[ROUVELIER]
Oh, it is.

146
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:15,916
Furthermore, I believe that he
took Allen Walker as his protégé

147
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,458
because he knew that
Walker's the Player.

148
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:21,333
Your facts are starting to
sound like speculation to me.

149
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:23,666
[ROUVELIER] Please, Chief,
can you honestly tell me

150
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,166
that you don't find
this information

151
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,166
the least bit worrisome?

152
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,666
A mysterious,
previously unknown Noah,

153
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,083
and a conclave including
one of our own generals

154
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:34,291
plotting to fulfill
his last wish,

155
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:37,708
and none of this troubles you?

156
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,125
[ALLEN]
I'll tell you this now.

157
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:41,833
I'm not plotting anything.

158
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,625
And I've never heard of
the Fourteenth before,

159
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,083
so quit trying to remind me.

160
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,291
[LINK] Oh, sure, you
don't know anything.

161
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:50,708
Because nobody ever denies
their own culpability.

162
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:56,500
[thunder rumbles]

163
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:00,625
Now listen up.

164
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,000
You can deny your involvement

165
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,833
with the Fourteenth
as much as you want,

166
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:06,875
but your actions have already
confirmed your connection.

167
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:09,333
What other explanation is
there for how you knew

168
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,208
the melody to operate the Ark?

169
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:13,958
And how else could you
know how to read this?

170
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:23,583
That... But how?

171
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:25,625
Well, now that's
a look of surprise.

172
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:29,541
You didn't tell Chief Komui
about this sheet music, did you?

173
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,125
Do I have proof to
back up these claims?

174
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,875
Come now. Of course I do.

175
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:43,958
In fact, living,
breathing proof at that.

176
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,750
The Order happens to have one
of the Fourteenth's adherents

177
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:51,041
in our custody as we speak.

178
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:54,208
He's quite the infirm
and frail old man.

179
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:56,833
After devoting so much of
his life to the Fourteenth,

180
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:59,250
he came to fear that
the Earl would kill him.

181
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,375
So he came to us for protection.

182
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:05,000
And believe me, we have
learned a great deal from him.

183
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:07,958
The symbols on here,
our scholars pored over them.

184
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,958
They don't belong to any
known people or culture.

185
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:15,125
And despite this fact,
you're capable of reading them.

186
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,708
[ALLEN]
Because...

187
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:21,375
That's only because they're...
the letters I created with Mana.

188
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:24,291
Did somebody teach you how
to decipher these symbols?

189
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:25,541
Who taught you?

190
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,166
[ALLEN]
But... I can't.

191
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,083
[LINK] Are these symbols
some kind of covert code

192
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:30,958
created by the Fourteenth?

193
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:34,166
[ALLEN]
I can't tell them.

194
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,375
Mana was just a
travelling clown.

195
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:40,250
I was an orphan and he
took me in and raised me.

196
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:43,291
And that's all there is to it.

197
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:46,125
[LINK]
Speak up, Walker. Am I wrong?

198
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:58,958
It's you. Why are you here?

199
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,041
What?

200
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:03,500
[ALLEN]
There! Behind me! In the window!

201
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,833
I don't see anything other
than our reflections.

202
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:09,625
[ALLEN]
Huh?

203
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:12,000
You don't see it.

204
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,500
You're resorting to theatrics
now that you're cornered?

205
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:17,458
How childish can you get?

206
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:22,500
[ALLEN] It's not an act.
I think I'm losing my mind.

207
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:28,375
Mana, you and I, we were
just an orphan and a clown.

208
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:31,666
That's what I always believed.

209
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:37,666
But if that's not so... If we
were more, then what were we?

210
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:49,583
Is it just me, or is the
atmosphere kind of tense today?

211
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:52,250
Yeah, everyone's on edge
because of Walker and Cross.

212
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:53,833
Rumors are spreading
like wildfire.

213
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:56,958
What kind of rumors?

214
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,750
[MEMBER A] I heard
the Noah brainwashed them

215
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,333
and sent them in
to infiltrate us.

216
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:01,666
[MEMBER B]
Yeah.

217
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,791
That's why the Central
Agency's snooping around.

218
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:04,916
[BAK]
That's just ludicrous!

219
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,208
Leave them be.

220
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,958
Trying to repudiate gossip
only strengthens it.

221
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,875
Trust me, it'll blow
over soon enough.

222
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:13,541
[NANSEN]
You really think so?

223
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:16,000
We are in the middle
of a war, after all.

224
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,333
It's life and death,

225
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:19,416
and people are desperate,
frantic, and scared.

226
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,916
If a rift develops between us,
it could likely be disastrous.

227
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:31,083
Allen Walker is a good guy!

228
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:35,041
He's not working with
the Noah, he's with us!

229
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:38,833
Allen's my friend.
He's a good guy.

230
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:49,458
Listen, I know you care
about your friends,

231
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:50,958
but you can't let it
get to you so much

232
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:53,458
'cause some morons are
talkin' bad about them.

233
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:55,750
Yeah, people are just
freaking out right now.

234
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:58,583
They'll snap out of it once
they start to calm down.

235
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,000
And hey, we're with you, man,

236
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:02,416
we know that Allen's a good guy.

237
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:07,250
[JOHNNY]
Thanks, guys. Really.

238
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:23,500
Hey, good mornin'.

239
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,791
Oh, hey, good morning, Lavi.

240
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:28,916
Oh, wow. You got some
heavy bags under your eyes.

241
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,666
Must be tough to sleep with
a mole spying on you all night.

242
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,791
What? You're a very
rude young man.

243
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:37,833
[ALLEN] Jeez, Link, don't let
him get under your skin.

244
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,500
Lavi's practically still a kid.

245
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:41,458
He just likes giving
people nicknames.

246
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:44,375
Just ignore him and he'll get
bored and leave you alone.

247
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:45,541
[LAVI chuckles]

248
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,000
[LAVI]
Hey. A kid?

249
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:49,500
You do know that I'm older
than you, right, Allen?

250
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,208
[ALLEN] Doesn't make you
any more mature, though.

251
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:52,708
I'm surprised.

252
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,375
I thought you'd be more upset
about everything goin' on,

253
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,791
but you seem pretty chipper.

254
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,416
[ALLEN]
Well, you know how it is.

255
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,666
Sure, maybe I'm seeing
things that aren't there,

256
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,166
but what can I do about it?

257
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:06,166
Everything is out of
my control, right?

258
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,791
There's not much
point in getting upset

259
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:10,375
over something that's
out of your hands.

260
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:24,166
[ALLEN] What is this? They've
set up a restricted area?

261
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,291
[LAVI]
Hm? What's goin' on?

262
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:28,541
Oh, good morning, everybody.

263
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:32,666
We finally got this thing
set up and ready to study.

264
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,250
The factory?

265
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:37,750
Wait a sec, did you guys
move that here from the Ark?

266
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:40,166
[REEVER] Yep. We couldn't
research it in there.

267
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,625
Yeah, sure, that's great.

268
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,750
Now when are you gonna get
around to fixing my hammer?

269
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:46,458
[REEVER] Look, it's on the list
of things to do, I promise.

270
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:48,875
But this is the
priority right now.

271
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,833
You guys realize
how huge this is?

272
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:53,250
It's bound to provide us
with invaluable information

273
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:54,958
about the Akuma.

274
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,916
Once we crack
all of its secrets,

275
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,500
it might give us
some kind of idea

276
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:01,416
of how we can finally win
this war against the Earl.

277
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,166
This find, it's the first true
beacon of hope for us.

278
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,791
Hope, huh?

279
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:20,041
What do you want?

280
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,583
Nothing.

281
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,291
I just thought it might be nice
to sit and meditate with you

282
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:25,250
for a change of
pace, that's all.

283
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,583
Because of Rouvelier?

284
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,416
You always come running to me.

285
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:33,375
He rears his head, and you
sprint in my direction.

286
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,708
I just don't like worrying the
others, but you don't worry.

287
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:41,000
Or if you do, you
never really show it.

288
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:44,666
And I like that you
don't ask questions.

289
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,125
But... I guess I'm just running.

290
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,708
I know I should face him.

291
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:52,208
I don't understand why I'm like
this! I hate feeling this way!

292
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:54,208
I've gotta be
stronger than this!

293
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:56,541
But I'm not... I'm just...

294
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,583
[sighs]

295
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,583
Lenalee.

296
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:05,166
You're one of the
strongest people I know.

297
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,208
[LENALEE]
Hm?

298
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:08,875
You mean that?

299
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:11,375
Just shut up and meditate now.

300
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:21,416
[LENALEE]
Huh?

301
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,083
[GOLEM A] Lenalee Lee. Please
come to Hevlaska's chamber.

302
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:27,500
Director Rouvelier and
Chief Komui await you.

303
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:35,791
[HEVLASKA]
Her synchronization rate

304
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,750
has dropped to
below ten percent.

305
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,583
It's fallen that low?

306
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:40,791
[HEVLASKA]
Her Innocence.

307
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:44,041
It's best to return it
to me at this time.

308
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,958
I'll restore it
to original form.

309
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:03,041
You're okay? You're
not in any pain?

310
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,125
I'm fine.

311
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:06,333
[ROUVELIER]
So what does this mean?

312
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:09,458
Is she incapable of
synchronizing now?

313
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:11,333
[HEVLASKA]
No, that's not the case.

314
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:13,958
Although, much as we
already witnessed

315
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:17,208
with Allen Walker's
left arm, the Innocence,

316
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:21,291
it has begun to develop
unprecedented properties.

317
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:25,291
I sense that it's begun to
develop a will of its own.

318
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:29,750
Just as the Akuma grow more
powerful by feeding on sorrow,

319
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:31,541
the Innocence has
begun to react

320
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:33,875
to the emotions of
the Accommodator.

321
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,541
As if...

322
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,416
[gasps] It's evolving?

323
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,541
Are you saying the Innocence
has begun to evolve?

324
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,291
[KOMUI]
Is that possible?

325
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,583
Perhaps it is.

326
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:49,208
But the stronger it grows,
the more it demands of its host.

327
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:51,166
Like a Parasite Type.

328
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,125
[LENALEE]
Huh?

329
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:53,958
Parasite Types are uncommon.

330
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:55,875
There are fewer of them
than Equipment Types

331
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:57,458
due to the strain.

332
00:17:57,541 --> 00:18:02,208
Such a powerful, distilled form
of Innocence... is corrosive.

333
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,416
The constant surge
of energy required

334
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,541
feeds off of the
vitality of the host.

335
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:10,250
And such a ceaseless
assault on the body

336
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:13,833
shortens the lifespan
of the Accommodator.

337
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:16,875
[LENALEE]
What? Did she just...?

338
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:22,250
Komui. Is that true?

339
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:25,625
[ROUVELIER] Her Innocence is
becoming a Parasite Type?

340
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:27,958
[HEVLASKA]
I'm not sure yet.

341
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:31,666
But the next time
she synchronizes,

342
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:35,458
I suggest that she is prepared.

343
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,750
[LINK]
Walker!

344
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,000
Yeah?

345
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,583
Are you trying to give
yourself a heart attack?

346
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,291
You're 15 years old
and growing,

347
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:49,875
you need to eat some vegetables.

348
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:52,958
Yeah, sure, you're one to talk,
the only thing you eat is cake.

349
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:55,041
I'm 19, I can eat
whatever I want.

350
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,375
[ALLEN] What?
And how does that matter?

351
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:57,750
[LINK]
Because I'm an adult.

352
00:18:57,833 --> 00:19:01,250
Just another peaceful,
lovely morning.

353
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:04,750
[JOHNNY] All right! I'm ready
for another hard day of work!

354
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:05,791
Let's get to it!

355
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:07,875
Johnny! C'mon, you're late!

356
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:09,791
Hurry up and bring
that box over here!

357
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,708
[JOHNNY]
Right! Sorry!

358
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,791
He's certainly in a
better mood today.

359
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:17,666
Guess so.

360
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,541
[BAK]
Wow, there it is.

361
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,416
All right. We're ready to work,
what've you got for us to do?

362
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,500
C'mon, guys.

363
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:24,708
[JOHNNY]
Whoa, hey, you can't come in!

364
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:26,583
You're not with
the Science Section!

365
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,625
[BAK] So what? I'm still
a damn great scientist!

366
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,500
[RENI] Yeah, you don't
have to be so rude.

367
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:33,250
You guys are
understaffed, right?

368
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:34,375
Well, we're here to help!

369
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,416
Oh, this is the
last thing I need.

370
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,041
Look, I'm sorry. I'm
not tryin' to be rude.

371
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,166
I'm just tryin' to
do my job, alright?

372
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,583
Sure, and what
important work it is.

373
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,583
[JOHNNY]
Exactly!

374
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:48,166
Uh.

375
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,666
What?

376
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:04,625
See. I've got a job to do.

377
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,333
What the hell?

378
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:40,916
Now then, let's get to work.

379
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:18,291
[ALLEN] Lulu Bell of the Noah
Clan suddenly appears in the lab

380
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:20,250
with a horde of Akuma.

381
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:22,500
Her ambush takes
everyone by surprise,

382
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:24,625
and no one knows
how to counter attack,

383
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:27,625
leaving the Order on
the verge of annihilation.

384
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:31,166
On the next D.Gray-Man:
"Attack on Headquarters."

385
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:34,125
Bring forth salvation to
this poor Akuma's soul!

386
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:35,875
Yeehaw!

387
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:40,916
Hey, sorry, but who
are you again?

388
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,458
My name is Howard Link.

389
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:44,416
Why do you keep hovering
over me like that?

390
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,166
I'm keeping an eye on you.

391
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,333
But why?

392
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:49,125
Because you always
show up late to school,

393
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:50,666
you run in the hallway,

394
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,958
and you also bring snacks and
a Golem into the classroom,

395
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:53,833
that's why!

396
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:55,708
Really? Those are your reasons?

397
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:56,916
[ROUVELIER]
Heh-heh.
