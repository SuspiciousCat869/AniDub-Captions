1
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:48,166
[AGENT A] There goes three
months' worth of salary.

2
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,875
If I stay on as Cross Marian's
caretaker any longer,

3
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:52,541
I'll end up destitute!

4
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:56,041
Wait, you did remember to keep
the receipt for that, right?

5
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:58,000
Even if I proved it was
a business expense,

6
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:00,625
I doubt Director Rouvelier
would reimburse me.

7
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:04,500
[AGENT B] Valid point. He holds
the purse strings pretty tight.

00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,208
[AGENTS gasp]

9
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:08,333
[AGENT A] What's going on?
Why'd we stop?

10
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:10,208
[ORDER MEMBER A] It appears the
boat is stuck on something

11
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:11,541
in the canal.

12
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:13,166
Perhaps a piece of driftwood?

13
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,583
If we get back late,
we can expect

14
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:16,916
another scolding
from General Cross.

00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,541
There's a body under here!

18
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:30,833
The Oceania Branch Chief.

00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:36,708
[ALL scream]

20
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:39,583
All right. We're ready to work,
what've you got for us to do?

21
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:40,666
C'mon, guys.

22
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,750
[JOHNNY]
Whoa, hey, you can't come in!

23
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:43,625
You're not with the
Science Section!

24
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:46,708
[BAK] So what? I'm still
a damn great scientist!

25
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,625
[RENI] Yeah, you don't
have to be so rude.

26
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:51,500
You guys are understaffed,
right? Well, we're here to help!

27
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:53,583
Oh, this is the
last thing I need.

28
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:56,208
Look, I'm sorry, I'm
not tryin' to be rude.

29
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,333
I'm just tryin' to do
my job, all right?

30
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:00,750
Sure, and what
important work it is.

31
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:02,625
[JOHNNY]
Exactly.

32
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:05,333
Uh.

33
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:06,791
What?

34
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:21,833
See. I've got a job to do.

35
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:51,333
[LULU BELL] You have
the privilege of meeting

36
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:53,375
the shape-shifting Noah of Lust.

37
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:54,833
I'm Lulu Bell.

38
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:56,375
Though we'll be
parting ways soon

39
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,250
as your lives will be ending,

40
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:02,416
my Master told me to be polite
and introduce myself first.

41
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,583
[gasps]

42
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:07,750
Allen!

43
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:11,083
Akuma are here!

44
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,083
I'm picking up a large
number of signals

45
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,291
from the lab I saw Reever in!

46
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:22,666
The entrance to the lab is
sealed. We've gotta get in!

47
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,791
[LINK] Where did this
black wall come from?

48
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:32,291
Didn't even make a scratch.

49
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:33,541
[ALLEN]
Look out, Lavi!

50
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,416
Let's try Heaven Compass!

51
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,166
With Edge End!

52
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:43,291
Did it work?

53
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:48,125
[LAVI] Nothing.
So how do we get through?

54
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:52,041
I can't hear anything
from the other side.

55
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,416
Are they here for the egg?
To steal back the factory?

56
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,166
All I know is Reever

57
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,541
and the rest of the Science
Section are trapped!

58
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,958
We've gotta find a way
to break down this wall!

59
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:03,375

You're wasting your time!

60
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:04,875
Follow me!

61
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,750
You're not to come with
us, Lavi. Understand?

62
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:15,250
Come on! I like a joke,
but now's not the time!

63
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:16,416
[BOOKMAN]
I'm serious.

64
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,208
Your Innocence hasn't
been repaired yet.

65
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:22,083
Your presence would only
slow down the rest of us.

66
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:25,541
Tell everyone what's happening!
Go spread the word!

67
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:30,916

68
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,041
[BOOKMAN]
Hm?

69
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:45,125
The Master's egg is ours
again. Safe and sound.

70
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:58,375
Kill me. Just kill me already.

71
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:06,958
[RENI] What the hell
are the Akuma up to?

72
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,333
They're lining the
researchers up in rows.

73
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:12,500
Whatever it is,
I guarantee it's not good.

74
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:15,916
Chief Bak. Is that you?

75
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,791
[BAK]
Johnny. You're finally awake.

76
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:21,000
Chief. Take off my headphones.

77
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:23,875
Listen to them. Please.

78
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:28,166
[REEVER]
Hello? Can you hear me?

79
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,916
It's Reever! So you're
still alive, huh?

80
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,250
You sound surprised, Chief
Bak. Good to hear you.

81
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:38,250
It could be the number of Akuma,
but the radio signal is so weak,

82
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:40,875
we can't communicate
outside the lab.

83
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:43,000
[BAK] Are you the only
one who wasn't captured?

84
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:46,250
Negative. There's
five others here.

85
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:48,333
Listen, I don't know
if you started,

86
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:50,750
but you should rig up
a barrier talisman.

87
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:53,833
Way ahead of you. Though I
don't know if it'll function.

88
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:56,916
We're doing what we can, but
there's not a lot to work with.

89
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,583
[REEVER]
Same story over here.

90
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:02,875
[RENI] Bak! Something else is
coming through using their Ark.

91
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,875
We've already lined
them up for you.

Make it quick. We don't
have much time.

good head on their shoulders.

[BAK]
Reever! Don't!

103
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:54,958
Even if we attacked all at once,

104
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,583
we wouldn't stand a chance
against their numbers.

105
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:00,708
The best thing we can do is to
survive as long as possible.

106
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:01,833
Keep working on the talisman

107
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:05,000
and we may be able
to save a few.

108
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,625
Don't give up, Reever!

109
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:08,708
We may not be able to
reach the outside,

110
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,708
but we still have
Walker's left eye.

111
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,625
He definitely noticed
what's going on.

112
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:15,916
Don't lose faith!

you're gonna do to me?

Well now, this one talks.

We're creating puppets
to guard the egg.

Skulls, as the Noah call us.

121
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,583
It's a necessity to
recruit more of our kind

122
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:39,125
since your Exorcists
killed so many of us.

if you're worthy.

Just you wait!
You'll pay for this!

How, may I ask, do you
intend to do that?

The last time you

Innocence in my body.

weren't Accomodators.

to respond to the Innocence

where they couldn't.

Hevlaska did agree.

could go out of control!

myself... it'll work.

[MIRANDA screams]

317
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:41,625
Watch out!
