1
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:48,708
This story takes place
one thousand years ago...

2
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:51,375
The lord who ruled
this land at the time

3
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:54,333
had a beautiful daughter...
named Sandra.

4
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:56,750
When she turned
sixteen years old,

5
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:58,416
the breathtaking
beauty of the girl

6
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,708
was already being discussed
throughout the kingdom

7
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:04,083
and great swarms
of men began arriving

8
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:07,500
from distant lands such
as Greece and the Orient,

9
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:09,708
crossing oceans
and mountains to ask

10
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:11,958
for Sandra's hand in marriage.

11
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:14,958
However, no matter how
noble or fervent the offer

12
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:18,125
of marriage, the princess
would not accept...

13
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:20,958
This did not deter her
suitors from pursuing her,

14
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:23,583
and Sandra finally
issued a decree...

15
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:27,708
I will only be the wife of the
strongest man in the world.

16
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:29,375
Then, to test their strength,

17
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:32,125
the princess told the
men that to win her,

18
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:33,750
they must fight Vittorio,

19
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:36,666
the sword fighter who
protected her family.

20
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:45,416
battling men from across
the globe who swaggered

21
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,208
into the arena
confident in their skills...

22
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:51,291
...and he never lost.

23
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:54,583
This continued even after
the poor princess took ill,

24
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,000
and passed away...

25
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:58,875
And it is said the battle
cries are still heard,

26
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:01,250
one thousand years later.

27
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:23,791
By order of Princess Sandra,
I will fight you.

28
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:27,291
Come!

29
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,125
Kanda's missing?!

30
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:43,916
Wasn't his last
assignment in Rome?

31
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,416
Yes, that's right...

32
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,875
Innocence was discovered in
ruins just outside the city

33
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:49,333
and he was sent to collect it.

34
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:50,625
But it's been a week now

35
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:52,125
since we've had any
contact with either Kanda

36
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:55,916
or the Finder that he
took along with him.

37
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,333
Many Akuma have been reported

38
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,958
around the arena where
they supposedly disappeared.

39
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:03,916
So, of course, only Exorcists
can go in with any safety.

40
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,541
I'd like to send you...

41
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,833
Do you think you're up
to the task, Allen?

42
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:15,625
I'm all set...

43
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:16,875
We can push off.

44
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,083
What are you doing here?

45
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:20,416
Would you move over, please?

46
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,000
Oh... Uh, sure... I didn't
know you were coming.

47
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,625
Alright then,
I think we're ready.

48
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:38,916
Wow, she still
seems pretty angry.

49
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:45,250
I wonder if Komui forced
her to come with me...?

50
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,666
Then again, it's hard
for me to imagine

51
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,708
him forcing Lenalee
to do anything.

52
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,333
Why do you think, Allen,
because you're my friend!

53
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,875
You know, I was
thinking we really haven't

54
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:10,958
had a chance to talk
since you've recovered.

55
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,583
About what happened...

56
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:18,250
I'm sorry, Lenalee!

57
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,375
Don't try to get up yet...

58
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:27,958
I still haven't forgiven you.

59
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,875
Oh... alright.

60
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:31,791
You're really selfish, Allen...

61
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,833
You think that being able
to see Akuma's souls

62
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,125
means that you carry the
whole burden and you

63
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:40,583
sacrifice yourself instead
of letting other people help.

64
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:44,125
I wonder, what friendship
even means to you...

65
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:45,958
Because it's insulting

66
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:49,125
when you won't even allow
me to fight beside you!

67
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:54,625
I hate... your stupid eye...

68
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,208
I hate it.

69
00:05:56,833 --> 00:06:02,375
Um...

70
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:03,625
Lenalee, I...

71
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:07,083
Thank you for saving my life.

72
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:10,458
You're welcome. I'm sure
it won't be the last time!

73
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:17,416
I wonder if that means she's
decided to forgive me?

74
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,500
What're you waiting for?!

75
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:20,000
Hurry up and get on!

76
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:22,875
If we don't the next train
to Rome isn't until tomorrow!

77
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:24,875
Oh... yeah!

78
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:35,333
A Roman swordfighter
who's still alive?

79
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:36,541
See...?

80
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:37,875
Doesn't it sound like Lala,

81
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:40,250
that doll that sang for,
what, five hundred years?

82
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:44,083
Yeah, so does that mean
that this fighter has...

83
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:45,666
We don't know yet...

84
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,625
I mean, we can't say
that it's even possible

85
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:50,708
for Innocence to do
such a thing in a human.

86
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:51,791
It could also mean that he's

87
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:54,208
an Accommodator
using the Innocence.

88
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:55,750
Yeah... maybe...

89
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,583
Let's put it this way,
if we discover

90
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:00,333
that this swordsman
really exists,

91
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:03,083
we'll have a pretty
big mystery on our hands.

92
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:07,833
According to this briefing,

93
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:09,958
it looks as though the
sources report that Akuma

94
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,666
only started appearing
around the ruins

95
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:15,000
of the fighting arena
about a month ago.

96
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:17,000
But it says here that
not a single Akuma

97
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:19,833
that went inside ever
managed to escape...

98
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:21,083
That's strange...

99
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:22,458
Do you think that they
could have been defeated

100
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:25,083
by the sword fighter if
he was using Innocence?

101
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:28,041
I'd be willing to bet that's
what my brother was thinking,

102
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:30,333
and in order to confirm
that it was true...

103
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:33,125
He decided to
send Kanda to Rome.

104
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,958
Stay here... and lay low.

105
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,666
Please be careful.

106
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,125
Mighty Mugen...

107
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:55,583
Innocence, Activate!

108
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,250
Move it! You're in my way!

109
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:25,583
That's what you get for
standing around like a punk.

110
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,291
Uh... Excuse me...

111
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:32,666
Don't worry, old man,

112
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,208
you'll get your money
when I get my reward.

113
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:36,166
Who are they...?

114
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,833
Do you think they're soldiers?

115
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:40,666
They certainly act as though
they're trying to start a war.

116
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,875
I heard that...!

117
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:43,750
You want to say it
again to my face?

118
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:44,666
Come on!

119
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,958
You just say that again!

120
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,458
Please, now, calm down...!

121
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,875
You don't want to get hurt
like this. Come on, let's go...

122
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:51,458
Let go!

123
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:52,875
If they're so bent on fighting

124
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:56,166
I wish they'd do us all a
favor and kill each other.

125
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,000
This is a gathering
of bounty hunters...

126
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,750
We're all here because
the Sardini family

127
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:01,958
put out the call to anyone

128
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,041
who can help find
their missing daughter.

129
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,750
Wait, bounty hunters?

130
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,583
A local girl is missing?

131
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,208
You mean you haven't heard...?

132
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:12,250
Its all over, the Sardini's
sixteen year old daughter,

133
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:14,250
Claudia, was abducted
from their residence

134
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,625
about three days ago...

135
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:20,375
The man who took her identified
himself as "Vittorio."

136
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:21,916
Vittorio?!

137
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,916
The swordfighter that's been
living for a thousand years?!

138
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:29,708
Your attention please...

139
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:32,666
You will make your way
to the Sardini residence!

140
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,666
The Viscount Paletti
will give instructions

141
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:38,291
to those who wish to
collect a sizeable reward!

142
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:41,041
Who do you think
Paletti could be?

143
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,666
I don't know.

144
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,041
Oh, how funny!

145
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:10,541
Come on, Allen,
I can't believe you.

146
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,666
We didn't come
here for a picnic.

147
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,375
This isn't a picnic,
it's just a little snack...

148
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,833
Here you go, young lady,
have your fill!

149
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:20,375
Oh, no thank you!

150
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:24,833
Brave searchers

151
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,791
pardon me for
interrupting your meal

152
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:29,083
but I'd like your
attention please...

153
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:32,041
I'm sure you are already
aware that Claudia Sardini,

154
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,166
the daughter of
the Sardini family,

155
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:38,375
has been abducted by a thug
who calls himself Vittorio...

156
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:42,375
Her father, who stands beside
me, is obviously heartbroken.

157
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:45,000
As an heir of the
honored Paletti Family...

158
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:48,750
I hereby promise...
on our family's name...

159
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:51,041
The person who finds Claudia,

160
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:54,500
my dear fiancée, and rescues
her from the detestable thief...

161
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,041
"Fiancée"?!

162
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,833
Why would such a young girl be
engaged to a man of his age?

163
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:01,666
To him, will be given one tenth
of the Sardini Family fortune!

164
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,041
Viscount, how can you
make such a proclamation...!

165
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,166
You shouldn't decide
these things

166
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,833
without discussing it with me!

167
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,333
You surprise me, sir...

168
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:10,875
I would think that offering
a mere tenth of your assets

169
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,166
would be nothing when compared

170
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,875
to the safety of
your only daughter,

171
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:17,083
as her loving father I'm
sure you don't count the cost.

172
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,916
We're talking about the
Sardinis--even one-tenth

173
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,250
is more than most
of us can dream of!

174
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,333
We'll find her!

175
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:25,791
I'm going to enjoy being rich!

176
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,750
Oh, Claudia...
I don't know how

177
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:37,958
I could have raised such
an ungrateful daughter!

178
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:42,250
To hell with this Vittorio.
It's ridiculous!

179
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:45,375
Huh...?!

180
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:46,541
Hey... What the... Hey...

181
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:48,750
Please, don't be alarmed...

182
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,583
We won't do any harm.

183
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,250
Excuse us for
barging in this way.

184
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:56,458
We're not a threat
to you, Mr. Sardini...

185
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:58,583
We're with the Black Order.

186
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,791
What...? Is that so...?

187
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:04,875
Well then, have a seat...

188
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,041
It began about a month ago,

189
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,250
my daughter said that a
medieval-looking swordsman

190
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,666
appeared to her in her bedroom.

191
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,208
It all sounded so ludicrous

192
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:19,583
I decided Claudia
must've been dreaming.

193
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:21,041
But then she...

194
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:23,250
Well, she simply wouldn't
stop talking about this man

195
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:26,166
and his reports to her at
night or some such thing.

196
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,791
His reports?

197
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:31,500
The world's strongest man
has yet to appear, my lady.

198
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,166
I admit I lost my temper...!

199
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,708
I told her to stop
spouting such nonsense,

200
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:39,916
but she swore up and down
that she was telling the truth.

201
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,583
And then three days ago,

202
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,208
on the very day
that her engagement

203
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,625
with Viscount Paletti
was finalized...

204
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:50,125
What could that girl
possibly be thinking!

205
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:51,666
My thoughts exactly...

206
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,875
What could be going through
dear Claudia's head right now?

207
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:57,125
Oh, Viscount...

208
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,875
I was just recounting
some of the details...

209
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,041
Hmph...!

210
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,041
Once we are married,
the Sardini family,

211
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,125
born of merchants and tradesmen,

212
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,333
will become
relations of nobility

213
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:09,416
and will finally
realize their dream

214
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,833
of being fully embraced
by upper class society...

215
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,916
When Claudia submits
to our wishes...

216
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,333
Son-in-law, I still object to
the way you're handling this...

217
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:20,583
Claudia ran away from home.

218
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:21,791
It's that simple...!

219
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:23,583
That or she was somehow
tricked into leaving

220
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:25,916
by this fool calling
himself Vittorio.

221
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,083
Gathering these hunters

222
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:29,208
and offering a reward
was unnecessary...

223
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:30,833
Why, our local police
could have taken...

224
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:32,750
I hope you
aren't worried, sir...

225
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:35,958
The last thing I want to do
is waste hard-earned money...

226
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:38,500
And speaking of money,
isn't it true that those

227
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:41,208
who are fortunate,
such as lottery winners,

228
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:44,125
are often the envy of those
who seem to have no luck?

229
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:45,250
Hmm?

230
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,958
You're very successful...

231
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,750
I'm sure you've
experienced ill will

232
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:52,000
from those who must
struggle more in life.

233
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:56,250
And who are these young people

234
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,791
who seem to enjoy
glaring at us so?

235
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:01,666
Ah... they claim affiliation
with the Black Order.

236
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,625
Did you request
for them to come?

237
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,708
No, of course not...

238
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,375
Very well then...

239
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:09,708
If patrons of the illustrious
Black Order are willing

240
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:12,083
to step in and lend us a hand,

241
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,458
perhaps the bounty
hunters are unneeded...

242
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:15,250
Please use...

243
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:16,708
You won't have our help...

244
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:18,625
If you sincerely want
Claudia to come back,

245
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:21,708
what's stopping you from
looking for her yourselves...?

246
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:24,750
All I've heard here is
money, status, fortune...

247
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,083
What do the two
of you value more,

248
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,333
this girl or the
things you possess?!

249
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,416
Having a parent like
you and a fiancé

250
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,041
like the Viscount...
would drive anyone away.

251
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:36,958
Allen... we should go.

252
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,041
Uh... what?

253
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:48,666
It's nothing.

254
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,916
I can't believe after all that

255
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,166
we didn't discover
anything about Kanda

256
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,875
and we still don't know
much about Vittorio, either...

257
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,208
I know.

258
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:04,041
Let's start fresh again
tomorrow morning, alright?

259
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:07,791
Alright.

260
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:11,416
Hey, Allen, do you really think
Claudia just ran away from home?

261
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,083
What?

262
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:14,208
I was just thinking...

263
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:16,291
Didn't her father
say that she started

264
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:19,666
talking about Vittorio...
about a month ago?

265
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,666
Why would she want to
make up such a story?

266
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,291
Because she, wanted to run
away and used it as an excuse?

267
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,375
I guess that could be true,

268
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,666
but what if Vittorio
really did appear to her?

269
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,208
You mean, as a ghost?

270
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:35,958
Mmm, maybe the ghost fell in
love with Claudia or something.

271
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:37,208
But...

272
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:39,750
I thought that he hadn't
seen Claudia before.

273
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,625
I was just
wondering, that's all.

274
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,666
Oh.

275
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,916
Good night.

276
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:09,750
I'll go first!

277
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:10,625
Where is he?!

278
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,833
I know I'm going to find her!

279
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:16,208
Oh, no...!

280
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:17,375
Let's hurry!

281
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:20,958
Where are you, Vittorio?!

282
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:21,833
Show yourself!

283
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:22,666
Come out and bring us Claudia!

284
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,541
He's probably afraid.

285
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:26,000
Turn the girl over!

286
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:36,916
What's happening?!

287
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,500
Dammit!!

288
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,000
I'll kill them!

289
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,333
Everyone, this way... hurry!

290
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:59,375
Damn the money--it
isn't worth it!

291
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:06,875
Damn the money--it
isn't worth it!

292
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:08,250
Wait, don't go...

293
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,041
Come on, it's too
late to save him...

294
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,916
You have to help me!

295
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,875
They only care about themselves!

296
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:19,708
It's still my duty
to protect them...

297
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,583
...as an Exorcist!

298
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:27,291
These are the instructions
given by Viscount Paletti.

299
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,083
Whoever goes inside the ruins

300
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:30,625
and proceeds to
defeat this Vittorio,

301
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,166
and rescue the lady Claudia...

302
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,833
This hero will be
given one fifth

303
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:35,958
of the entire
Sardini family fortune.

304
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,166
Was that one fifth?!

305
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,916
I thought it was only
a tenth, wasn't it?!

306
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,583
Now they're offering a lot more!

307
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,166
I'm not going to do it.

308
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,000
With those monsters in there,
you got to have a death wish...

309
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:46,000
No, we'll let the brats
take care of the monsters

310
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:48,416
in there and take on
Vittorio ourselves!

311
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:53,041
A poor nobleman mustn't squander
such a rare opportunity...

312
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:56,291
Claudia will soon be at my side.

313
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:02,125
Now, men... take aim!

314
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:04,625
Fire!

315
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,375
Who is that?

316
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:26,958
I am Vittorio... a swordsman
serving the house of Tivoli.

317
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:27,875
That's the man...

318
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:29,333
We found him!

319
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:31,583
By order of Princess Sandra...

320
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:33,250
I will fight you.

321
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:43,291
Attack!

322
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:53,125
Attack!

323
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:54,875
No you're not strong enough.

324
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:56,041
Kanda?!

325
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:58,000
This fighter is my prey...

326
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:59,750
Don't intervene.

327
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,333
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

328
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:06,875
I will fight you.

329
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,708
Miss Lenalee!

330
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:09,625
Pedro...

331
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:10,625
I'm so glad you made it!

332
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:11,416
Yeah...

333
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,833
Believe me. I'm glad too!

334
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:14,125
Are you sure you're alright?

335
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:17,291
Never mind about me,
Vittorio's got Innocence!

336
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,125
It's in the sword...

337
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:20,583
That's the source
of the phenomenon

338
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:24,125
that's kept the swordsman
alive for a thousand years.

339
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:29,000
Those two fought for
three days straight...

340
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:31,583
But then Akuma began appearing,

341
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,625
and the situation
became very chaotic...

342
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:36,083
...so Vittorio disappeared...

343
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,708
Kanda has been sleeping
for the last two days...

344
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:40,750
The fight was exhausting,

345
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,875
and he wanted to
regain his strength.

346
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,208
Neither of them seems to be

347
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,000
using the power of
the Innocence!

348
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,708
I believe that's a matter
of pride and honor...

349
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:51,708
They stopped using it on
the second day of the fight.

350
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:53,833
Without my Anti-Akuma Weapon,

351
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:55,958
I'm practically
useless in battle...

352
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:57,791
I wonder if that's the reason
Kanda didn't want me

353
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:00,333
to help him against Vitorrio.

354
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,208
The Innocence is healing him!

355
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,250
Look, the wounds
are disappearing!

356
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:58,833
Oh, no!

357
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:08,875
Kanda!

358
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:18,916
Kanda!

359
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:28,916
Kanda!

360
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:38,916
Kanda!

361
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:48,916
Kanda!

362
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:58,916
Kanda!

363
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:08,958
Kanda!

364
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:18,958
Kanda!

365
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:28,958
Kanda!

366
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:38,250
Kanda!

367
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:40,208
Vittorio raises his deadly sword

368
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:43,708
to levy the final blow
on a wounded Kanda...

369
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:46,125
All the while, the ancient
swordfighter fights

370
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:48,208
for the honor of a woman.

371
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,166
On the next episode
of D. Gray-man:

372
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,708
"Pride of the Swordsman."

373
00:22:52,791 --> 00:22:56,000
Bring forth salvation to this
tormented Akuma's soul!
