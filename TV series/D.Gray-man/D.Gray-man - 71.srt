Try making a fist

In addition,

I asked HQ to send us any
records they had on Walker.

00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:35,375
I compared the data.

17
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:37,083
Take a look at his Innocence.

18
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:39,125
It's more completely
joined with his body.

19
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:40,625
While before it was unrefined.

Amazing.

Nothing's too surprising
at this point.

Remember the Chief said the will
of the Innocence kept him alive.

After all the obstacles
he's overcome,

he's loved by God?

I guess there's no harm
saying when they first

be God's clown.

Would you say it's strong?

Oh. Yeah! It's a powerful
Anti-Akuma weapon.

[ALLEN]
One thing.

119
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,791
Even if Komui tells you
it's too dangerous,

120

I'm still going to ride the Ark.

121
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,208
You're not serious.

122
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,750
I'm looking over
the report you sent.

123
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,958
So his arm and body
are completely merged?

124
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,333
[BAK]
Yes.

125
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:14,666
It's proof Walker's mind and
Innocence have bonded.

126
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,791
Whereas before the
two were at odds.

127
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,666
[KOMUI]
Fascinating.

128
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,791
Furthermore, based on the
information in front of me,

129
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:23,166
his Innocence was unstable.

130
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,166
That left arm of his
was like a rough jewel.

131
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,791
Pure but unrefined.

132
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:29,041
Not quite an
anti-Akuma weapon yet.

133
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,375
It still needed some polishing.

134
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:34,208
It must have reacted
to Allen's emotions.

135
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:35,750
And whenever it
released that power,

136
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:38,333
it appeared similar to
Innocence being activated.

137
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,416
Looking back, it's obvious.

138
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,000
The records clearly show
that it's incomplete.

139
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:47,291
There's no comparison between
the old arm and the new one.

140
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,291
But who can blame him?

141
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:52,666
He's just a 15-year-old kid.
Governed by emotions.

142
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,916
Show me someone
his age who isn't.

143
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,583
This incident may have been
a blessing in disguise.

144
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:01,416
He could have gone his whole
life, living only for the Akuma.

145
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,083
Filled with suffering.
Sad and alone.

146
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,083
But that wasn't the case.

147
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,416
The battlefield drove
him into a corner.

148
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,916
And forced him to
acknowledge what he loved.

149
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,833
The need to save both
humankind and the Akuma.

150
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:18,791
His love is pure and
terrifying at the same time.

151
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,791
Yes. Isn't it?

152
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:24,083
Strong enough to change
him into a new person.

153
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:27,583
Reborn with the "Crown Clown"
to save both humans and Akuma.

154
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:31,250
However, there's one
thing I'm not sure of.

155
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:35,750
[BAK] Now that he's made
a comeback, is he content?

156
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:39,416
Will his choice bring him
the satisfaction he seeks?

157
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:51,333
One day we'll be strong enough
to cheat at cards again.

158
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:56,666
[ALLEN]
My mind is made up now.

159
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:00,375
I just need to push
forward on this path.

160
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:04,291
I'll keep walking
without stopping.

161
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:18,083
[LO FWA] So this is the
legendary Noah's Ark?

162
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:19,916
It doesn't look like a boat.

163
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,500
Are you serious, Jiji?

164
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,625
This thing is really a vessel?

00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,791
I don't know and
that's not our job.

[ALL]
Right! Yes sir!

The Science Section

will determine
what it is or isn't

based on the
information we send.

Our task is simply to hand
over accurate data,

00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:37,625

They're trying to bury us!

[REEVER] How's the analysis
comin', Johnny?

176
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,125
Um. Fine.

177
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,250
I've never seen this
much data, sir.

No time for complaining.

We've got Exorcists fighting
on the battlefield

Y-Yes sir.

Well. Ha! For some reason
it reminds me of my office.

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,791
Hey Chief.

That's no way to treat me.

Especially when I'm delivering
such good news.

187

Has there ever been a time

when your good news was
actually good, Chief?

189

It appears Allen
Walker's Innocence

190

has been fully restored.

Hey! That's great news!

194
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:23,875
Our top priority is verifying
the Ark is a teleporting device.

195
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:27,208
And if so, can Allen
safely board it?

So cool!

00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:41,500
The Science Section at the
Europe Branch is the best!

204
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:45,166
It's my goal to work
for them one day.

205

Me too.

Oh? Ah!

Welcome back, Allen!
You're home early!

Was there any trouble?

No trouble at all.

210
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,208
I just wanted to rush back

211
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,666
so I could have dinner
with you, Lo Fwa.

[LO FWA gasping]

Ah! Maybe I'll get
serious and apply!

00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,541
Lo Fwa. This work would
get done a lot quicker

215
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,041
if there were three
people doing it.

216
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,041
We lost her.

217
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,416
[WONG]
We meet again.

218
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,125
This is the last time I'll
give you your medicine.

219
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:35,291
You know the drill.

220
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:36,458
Thank you, Wong.

221
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:37,708
Forgive me.

222
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,583
But perhaps you should
rest your arm a little.

223
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:42,250
You're right. Still,
I'm kinda anxious

224
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,458
to get the senses back
in my hand again.

225
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,083
[WONG]
I'm sure when your friends see

226
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:49,083
your Innocence revived it'll
send morale through the roof.

227
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:50,875
Yeah maybe, at least I hope so.

228
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:53,500
Lenalee was especially
shocked when I told her

229
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,166
you would no longer
be an Exorcist.

230
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,250
But I imagine she'll be even
more surprised to see you again,

231
00:12:58,333 --> 00:12:59,583
stronger than ever!

232
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:00,750
What?

233
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,750
I guess with all the
excitement going on,

234
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:05,291
no one mentioned I was
the one who told Lenalee

235
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:07,458
and the others you were
at the Asian Branch.

236
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:08,875
You saw them?

237
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:10,625
Were they doing all right?

238
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:12,166
Yes.

239
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,750
I also escorted Miranda to the
docks to set sail with them.

240
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,833
What? Miranda's with them?

241
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:19,333
That's right. She did
seem to experience

242
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:23,333
a great deal of difficulty
finding the Asian Branch though.

243
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:26,708
So Miranda decided to
join the Black Order.

244
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:30,458
Then I look forward to
fighting alongside her, too.

245
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:31,875
That reminds me.

246
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,958
There's something in your
room you're going to need

247
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:36,416
to take with you before you
return to the battlefield.

248

I put one of these on.

00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,833
Too long.

for you three.

What's left?!

00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:04,166
We need to develop a Golem

259
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,416
that can withstand conditions
inside the Ark.

260
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,625
A new Golem?

261
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:09,833
What's wrong with the
one's we always use?

262
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,958
You tell me!

263
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,333
They're all toast.

264
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,166
[BAK] Looks like our Golems
aren't reinforced enough

265
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,958
to make the journey.

00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:20,208
Sorry, Chief.

267
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:22,833
We're brainstorming a
new model as we speak.

268
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,333
No need for that.

269
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:27,208
I've developed a two-way
communicator we can use.

[ALL sigh]
That was close!

271
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,541
[BAK] Did you finish with
the data collection?

272
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,666
Yes! We're just waiting
on headquarters

273
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,875
to make their decision.

Ah!

00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:45,833
So. What do you think?

277
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:47,958
[clears throat] I've
examined the data.

278
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,291
And...?

279
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,375
And I can't recommend
that Allen board the Ark.

280
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:52,833
Why not?

281
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:55,041
The evidence doesn't
100% conclude

282
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,958
that it's the real Noah's Ark.

283
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:59,083
[KOMUI] But the Akuma
that Allen fought traveled

284
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,916
to the Asian Branch from Edo
aboard this, did he not?

285
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,791
[REEVER] There's no mistaking
that it's some form

there remain too many
unknown variables

to call it safe.

289
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:11,250
Knowing the Akuma,
it could be a trap!

his intentions clear.

He's determined to board it
with or without my permission.

Thank God he's alive.

Aw. Section Leader
Reever. Don't cry.

316
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,041
[ALLEN] You're telling me
I shouldn't ride the Ark.

317
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,041
It's risky.

318
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,291
[ALLEN]
I don't care!

319
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,958
And I know nothing I say
is going to stop you.

320
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:18,208
So we'll compromise and
explore the Ark together.

321
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:19,208
Huh?

322

If we decide it's unsafe,

00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,333
you're to get out immediately.

324
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:25,333
I... I'm not running away
if things get dangerous!

325
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:28,583
[laughs] Reckless
as ever, I see.

326
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:31,666
After everything, you haven't
changed one bit.

327
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,916
But don't forget, you're very
important to us, Allen Walker.

328
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,625
And we don't want anything
to happen to you.

329
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:39,750
Camaraderie isn't
a one-way street.

330
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,875
Honestly, don't you
care about our feelings?

331
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:42,750
[ALLEN growls]

332
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:45,333
Fine. We'll do it your way.

333
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:47,000
Tell everyone back
at Headquarters

334
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:49,583
I'm thinking about them.
It's my home.

335
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:51,333
And I'm comin' back there soon.

336
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:53,458
I promise.

337
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,000
You better.

338
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:57,333
Right! Let's get started.

339
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,625
Well you heard the man!

340
00:16:58,708 --> 00:16:59,708
[ALLEN]
Wait.

341
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:00,875
I need to do something.

342
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,125
[KOMUI]
Oh?

343
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,375
[ALLEN]
Say goodbye.

344
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,083
To someone who can't be here.

345
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:07,166
I wouldn't be alive
if it wasn't for her.

346
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,250
[gasps]

347
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:19,125
How're you feeling Fo?

348
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:20,625
[FO]
So-so, I guess.

349
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:21,500
[ALLEN]
Really?

350
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:22,708
You sound better.

351
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,166
[FO] Resting in here
will allow me to heal.

352
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:30,083
But recuperating is such
a bore. As you know.

353
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,583
I'll just have to say farewell

354
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,458
to that crazy
Exorcist from here.

355
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:36,750
You're mean. C'mon,
I'm not that crazy, am I?

356
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:39,250
[FO laughs]
You dummy.

357
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:42,000
You care about the Akuma
as much as humans.

358
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:45,125
That's makes you
crazy in my book.

359
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:48,333
[ALLEN grunts, laughs]

360
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:53,166
[FO]
I'm tired. And need to rest.

361
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,500
But someone like you should
hurry back to the battlefield!

362
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:59,291
Someone like you.

363
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,041
[ALLEN]
See you around.

364
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:20,750
[ALLEN]
Sorry for the wait.

365
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,375
[BAK]
Did you finish saying goodbye?

366
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:25,041
[ALLEN]
Yes. I did.

367
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:26,791
I'm going.

368
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:28,333
Yes.

369
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:30,458
I thought Lo Fwa and the
others would be here.

370
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:33,916
It must have been too hard for
them to say goodbye in person.

371
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,041
Will you tell them
thank you for me?

372
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,833
There's no way I can repay them
for everything they did.

373
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:39,958
Of course.

374
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:43,333
We'll make sure they
get your message.

375
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:59,333
[LO FWA]
Wait! Don't go!

376
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,666
You can't leave yet!

377
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,500
Hey you guys!
Where were you?

378
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,166
You almost missed me.

379
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,458
A present!

380
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,500
Since your deck was missing
the Ace of Spades,

381
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:13,708
the three of us made you a new
one! It's an exact replica!

382
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:17,041
Right down to the ink!

383
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:19,666
Ha! Thank you.

384
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,333
Please, be careful!

385
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:22,500
See ya.

386
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:23,500
[ALLEN]
You bet.

387
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,083
[gasps]

388
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:28,208
[footsteps]

389
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,500
[BAK]
Walker!

390
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:40,583
[ALLEN]
Huh?

391
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:41,958
You made a promise!

392
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:44,833
You better come back to us!

393
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,916
[ALLEN]
I'm finally going back.

394
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,875
Back to my friends.

395
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,833
[TYKI]
He's still alive, you know.

396
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:09,625
In fact, he might even
be here shortly.

397
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:10,708
However,

398
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,041
if you die,

399
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:16,375
it'll just be us to greet
him when he arrives.

400
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:17,625
Yeah?

401
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:20,708
Guess our only choice
is to survive.

402
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:23,375
We have to be here
when Allen returns.

403
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:27,208
Otherwise, there won't be anyone
left alive to greet him.

404
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:31,291
Glad to hear.

405
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:35,000
Then I trust you'll put up
a struggle before dying.

406
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:39,458
Here we come! [yells]

407
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,750
[ALLEN]
The battle against the Noah Clan

408
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:17,291
continues to rage in Edo.
And as if Akuma spread across

409
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:19,541
the land and sky weren't
trouble enough,

410
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:20,791
they merge to create

411
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:23,791
an even more powerful
and grotesque form.

412
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:25,875
On the next <i>D.Gray-man</i> :

413
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:27,875
"Showdown in the Capital."

414
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:30,833
Bring salvation to this
poor Akuma's soul.

415
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:33,791
And, who are you?

416
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:34,958
My name's Lo Fwa!

417
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:35,916
I'm Li Kei.

418
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,416
I'm Shifu.

419
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,375
Lo Fwa. Shifu. Li Kei.

420
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:40,291
No! I'm Li Kei!

421
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:41,625
And I'm Shifu!

422
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:44,125
Ah! And I couldn't care less!

423
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:45,791
[FO]
Kanda. Admit it.

424
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:47,541
You can't memorize names.

425
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:49,041
Short Stack!

426
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:50,541
[FO laughs]

427
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:52,666
See? You don't even
remember Allen's!

428
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,625
[KANDA growls]

429
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:57,750
That wasn't very nice, Fo.
