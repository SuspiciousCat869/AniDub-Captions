00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:04,541
What are those?

3
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:12,583
[SUMAN] It seems that...
my life is coming to an end.

4
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:16,791
I'll soon be dead,
and when I die,

5
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:19,916
I'll take this monster with me.

6
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,541
It'll die, too.

7
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:27,583
I'm sorry. I only wanted
to see my family.

8
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:32,708
I'm so deeply sorry.

[ALLEN whimpering]

10
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:41,333
Stop it! Leave him alone!

11
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:46,833
[ALLEN grunts]
I said get off him!

12
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:51,291
[ALLEN grunting]

You bastards...

00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,833
[ALLEN]
Stop!

00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:20,333
[ALLEN cries]

17
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:34,500
Teez. Enough.

[ALLEN gasps]

00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,708
[TYKI]
Heh.

20
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,500
Come here.

[TYKI chuckles]

23
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:36,958
My, my. Look how much
bigger they've grown.

24
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,250
[ALLEN gasping]

25
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,666
[ALLEN]
Wait a minute. I know him.

26
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,875
He's from Suman's memory!

27
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:50,291
[ALLEN gasping]

28
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,916
[ALLEN]
I can't take it!

29
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,750
I wanna live. I beg you.

30
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:58,250
And what might your
name be, good sir?

31
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,916
[ALLEN gasping]

32
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,250
[ALLEN]
You're a Noah.

33
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:11,166
You're gonna pay!

34
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:17,500
[ALLEN gasps, groaning]

35
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:18,958
[TYKI]
Huh?

36
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:24,125
[TYKI] The boy's left arm.
It must be his Innocence.

37
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:27,250
In any case, why does
he look so familiar?

38
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:28,458
[TYKI gasps]

39
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:30,750
[ALLEN chuckles]

40
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:33,541
Now I remember!

41
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:39,208
From the train! You're the
card shark that cheated us!

42
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:43,125
I guess I can't blame you for
not recognizing me in this form.

43
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:46,083
[ALLEN]
Tell me. What did you do?

44
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:47,458
[TYKI]
Pardon?

45
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:51,708
[ALLEN]
To Suman. Is he dead?

46
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:55,416
You killed him.
Isn't that right?

47
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,250
Answer me!

48
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:01,083
You would have done the
same thing in my shoes.

49
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,375
He was the enemy.

50
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:07,083
[ALLEN growls]

51
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,333
[TYKI]
Well.

52
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,541
I guess there's no harm in
telling you about my ability.

53
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:18,708
It's not like you can run

54
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:20,750
and give any of your
friends the details,

55
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:24,958
but you'll only hear it once. So
perk those ears up. Understood?

56
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:27,916
[ALLEN whimpering]

57
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,750
[TYKI]
These guys are called "Teez".

58
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,458
Basically, they're
man-eating Golems

59
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,375
created by the Millennium Earl.

60
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:43,291
The butterfly shape was
his idea. A personal touch.

61
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:46,291
All you need to know is
that they feed on humans.

62
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:50,125
And the more they eat,
the more they grow and multiply.

63
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,875
However, that's their
ability. Not mine.

64
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:55,166
I don't want you to
get the wrong idea.

65
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,333
I just use the Teez as a tool.

66
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:02,541
On the other hand,
my power... is this.

67
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,583
[ALLEN grunts]

68
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,041
[TYKI chuckles]

69
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:17,708
Don't look so worried.
You won't feel any pain.

70
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,250
Impressive, huh?

71
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:22,083
My hand, actually
my entire body,

72
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:24,666
can pass through
anything I choose.

73
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:29,166
But that's only one half of
my ability. 'Cause you see,

74
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:34,083
when I want to touch something,
it's a different story.

75
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:36,416
Say I pull my hand through

76
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:41,750
and decide to grab a
part on the way out.

77
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:46,625
Some vital organ.
Your heart for instance.

78
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,583
I could remove it
from your chest,

79
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,333
still warm and pumping blood.

80
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:53,250
No problem.

81
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,875
Wouldn't even require cutting
your body open with a knife

82
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,416
to pluck it out.

83
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,791
[ALLEN grunts]

84
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,500
[TYKI] Imagine having
your heart extracted

85
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,250
while you're still alive.

86
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,291
[heartbeats]

87
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:12,208
[TYKI] What do you think
that would feel like?

88
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:17,416
Come on.
Why don't you tell me?

89
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,208
Are you afraid to die, boy?

90
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,291
Uh?

91
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,250
[TYKI gasps]

92
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,541
What a killjoy.

93
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:38,416
I wasn't really
going to take it.

94
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,333
If I did, I'd only get my
gloves stained with blood.

95
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:43,250
Normally I'd let
the Teez feed on you,

96
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,666
or it'd be a waste
to have them on hand.

97
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,958
[ALLEN]
Normally?

98
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:49,583
Yes. You mean you haven't heard?

99
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,625
About your dead comrades
who were found

100
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,833
with their internal
organs missing?

101
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:55,250
[ALLEN gasps]

102
00:08:56,291 --> 00:09:01,500
[TYKI] Daisya Barry.
Kazarna Rido. Charcar Lavong.

103
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,958
As for Suman,
since he helped me,

104
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:07,041
I gave him special treatment.

105
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,666
I decided to make his
body into a nursery

106
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,375
by planting Teez inside of it.

107
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,083
Seems it was effective.

108
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:15,708
Look at how much they've grown.

109
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:17,500
[ALLEN grunting]

110
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:21,416
Come to think of it,

111
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,000
I also encountered a
General named Yeagar.

112
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:24,875
[ALLEN gasps]

113
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:26,000
[TYKI]
If I remember correctly,

114
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,041
I didn't kill him
outright either.

115
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:31,708
Damn it. There was a
reason. What was it?

116
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:34,000
[ALLEN]
General Yeagar...

117
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:38,916
[TYKI]
Oh, that's right!

118
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,583
I used him as a
messenger instead.

119
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,541
I gather he was in
quite a bit of pain

120
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,875
by the time you found him,

121
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:48,833
seeing as his insides
were mostly eaten.

122
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:51,666
How... How dare you.

123
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,916
[TYKI]
Huh?

124
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:57,041
I'm sorry. What's that?

125
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:58,750
You killed them.

126
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:02,708
Oh, I see! They really
didn't tell you, huh?

127
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:04,041
[ALLEN grunts]

128
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:09,041
I won't forgive you!

129
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:16,916
[TYKI]
I confess,

130
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,541
I didn't think you had
this much fight left in you.

131
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:25,166
No matter. In your state,
you won't hold out for long.

132
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:27,458
[snap]

133
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:31,291
[ALLEN screams]

134
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:34,208
[ALLEN groaning]

135
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:37,000
[TYKI] Regrettably,
you caught me at a bad time.

136
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,500
I'd hoped to meet you
again in my light form.

137
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,041
Then perhaps I would
have challenged you

138
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,875
to a game of cards instead.

139
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:49,708
[TYKI] But this is my dark
side, and at the moment

140
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,458
I'm busy killing people
associated with

141
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:55,583
a certain individual.
Perhaps you know him.

142
00:10:55,666 --> 00:11:00,958
So tell me, boy. Your name
wouldn't be Allen Walker?

143
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,041
[LENALEE]
I'm close.

144
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:13,666
Suman's light disappeared
around here.

145
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,208
[LENALEE]
Come on, Allen.

146
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:25,208
[LENALEE] You should be here.
Why can't I find you?

147
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,041
[LENALEE]
Allen! Answer me!

148
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:32,083
[LENALEE] I have to hurry.
But where are you?

149
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:44,625
[LENALEE] What is this?
This awful feeling?

150
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,458
Allen...

151
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,916
[ALLEN]
This isn't good.

152
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,500
The condition my body's in...

153
00:11:56,583 --> 00:12:01,500
I can't even stand,
let alone fight.

154
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:04,291
If only I was stronger.

155
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:07,208
Why am I weak?

156
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,250
[ALLEN groaning]

157
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:15,333
[TYKI] Answer me. Your name
is Allen Walker, yes?

158
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:18,791
[CELL RORON]
You got the right victim, sir.

159
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:21,541
Yes. No doubt.

160
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:25,708
Allen Walker.

161
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:30,583
[CELL RORON]
Delete him.

162
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:36,583
Delete him.

163
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,916
[TYKI] I don't think
you've been introduced.

164
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,625
This is Cell Roron,
prisoner of the List Cage.

165
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:45,708
It's his responsibility to point
you out when our paths cross.

166
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:49,750
[ALLEN screams]

167
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,333
Now that I've found you,

168
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:55,458
I think I'll start by getting
rid of that Innocence of yours.

169
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:19,291
[TYKI]
Didn't you know?

170
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:22,958
Innocence isn't impervious.
It can be destroyed.

171
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:25,000
At least in the hands
of the Clan of Noah

172
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,833
or the Millennium Earl.

173
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:30,041
This can't be real.

174
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:33,583
[TYKI]
Every time we kill an Exorcist,

175
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:37,583
we collect their Innocence
and proceed to eliminate it.

176
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:39,125
Once we destroy the Heart,

177
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,333
all Innocence,
no matter how far away,

178
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,250
will shatter and
disappear forever.

179
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:47,458
It's quite dramatic, but that's
how we know we have the heart.

180
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:48,875
I wonder,

181
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:53,875
could yours be the one the
Earl's been searching for?

182
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,416
How about an experiment?

183
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,291
That's Suman's Innocence
beside you, right?

184
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:01,291
So if it disappears after
I destroy yours, then,

185
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:04,416
that would mean your Innocence
was the Heart all along.

186
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,708
Since you like to gamble,

187
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:08,166
would you care to wager
who has better odds?

188
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,791
[TYKI chuckles]

189
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,000
Don't do it.

190
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,833
Don't destroy it.

191
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,250
[ALLEN]
Didn't you hear me?

192
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:28,375
[ALLEN]
Don't do it!

193
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:34,666
[TYKI laughs]

194
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:38,666
[gasps]

195
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,916
[ALLEN gasping]

196
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:03,958
[TYKI] Now. Let's see
if that was the Heart.

197
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:10,833
[TYKI]
Well, shoot. I guess it wasn't.

198
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,625
We'll find it.

199
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:14,333
Besides, my job right now

200
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:16,166
is assassinating
people on this list.

201
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,416
[CELL RORON]
Delete him! Delete him!

202
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,500
Delete him! Delete him!
Delete him! Delete him!

203
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,416
[TYKI]
Yeah, yeah. Enough. I get it.

204
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,916
[CELL RORON]
Sorry.

205
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,958
[ALLEN]
Listen to me, Tim.

206
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:29,083
I need you to take Suman's
Innocence and run.

207
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:32,041
You can't stay.

208
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:33,875
You have to.

209
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:40,250
[ALLEN]
There's no other choice.

210
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:44,208
If you stay here, who's going
to help them find my master?

211
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,875
Now, go.

212
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:48,833
It's up to you.

213
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:56,291
[gasps]

214
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:05,166
[ALLEN]
Thanks for everything, Tim.

215
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,875
[TYKI] Well, I guess that
was a wise decision.

216
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:15,500
[TYKI]
Akuma. Go after it.

217
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,083
[AKUMA A grunts]

218
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:19,250
[AKUMA A] Hey, everyone.
We got new orders.

219
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,333
The Noah wants us to
capture that Golem.

220
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:22,625
[AKUMA B]
You're crazy if you think

221
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,166
we're going to disobey the Earl.

222
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,541
[TYKI]
Correct me if I'm wrong,

223
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,250
but he gave you explicit orders

224
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,000
to recover the Innocence
from the Fallen One.

225
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:30,041
[AKUMA B]
Did you hear that?

226
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:32,291
[AKUMA C]
It's the Noah's voice.

227
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:36,875
[TYKI] The golden Golem has the
Innocence in its possession.

228
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,791
I'm a little
preoccupied right now,

229
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:41,833
so you find it and
take the credit.

230
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:43,333
[AKUMA cheer]

231
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:44,666
[AKUMA B]
What a great guy!

232
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,541
[AKUMA C]
Let's go!

233
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:50,041
[AKUMA A] The golden
Golem is good as dead!

234
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:54,916
Did you see that? Just now.

235
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,708
Some kind of flash trailing
across the sky.

236
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:02,708
[KRORY]
I did. But what on earth was it?

237
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:10,958
The morning greets
us with ill omens.

238
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:14,666
A red dawn means blood
has been spilled.

239
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:19,916
[LENALEE]
Lavi! I need your help!

240
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,000
[TYKI] I bet I can guess what
was going through your head.

241
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:27,458
You realized it's hopeless.

242
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:31,291
You thought, "might as well send
this Golem to my comrades".

243
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:33,500
But I'm afraid
you've shown your hand.

244
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,916
You're prepared to die.

245
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,208
[ALLEN]
It isn't hopeless.

246
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,041
[TYKI]
Hm?

247
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:44,250
[ALLEN] As long as Tim
makes it back to the Order,

248
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:47,416
hope will never fade away.

249
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,958
[TYKI] An optimist right until
the very end, aren't you?

250
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:54,416
Well, you can pray to
your God that happens.

251
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,375
You could ask for anything.

252
00:17:56,458 --> 00:18:00,375
But at some point, you will have
to face the harsh reality.

253
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:05,541
Your God isn't here. Only me.

254
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,041
[TYKI]
Teez, do me a favor.

255
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,000
Don't devour this one.

256
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:17,791
Just puncture a little hole
in his heart instead.

257
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:24,916
A quick death would be a
disservice to such a brave soul.

258
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,708
Let's give him time to reflect
on his life before he dies.

259
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:31,541
Long enough for the blood
to spill out of his heart,

260
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:34,708
and for the fear to
wash over his body.

261
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:38,916
Slowly writhing in pain,
until eventually he dies!

262
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
[ALLEN groans]

263
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:42,625
[gags]

264
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:44,250
[BOOKMAN]
Hm?

265
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,166
It can't be!

266
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,583
[TYKI] Did it hurt a little
more than you thought?

267
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:55,666
Sorry, but look on the bright
side. Your suffering's over.

268
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:07,250
[TYKI]
Huh?

269
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:24,083
Sweet dreams, boy.

270
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:26,416
Forever.

271
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:04,458
[ALLEN]
The moon...

272
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:10,041
Even down here it looks so big.

273
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:17,208
[ALLEN]
I'm not ready.

274
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:20,541
Don't come for me.

275
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:25,208
I'm alive. Still alive.

276
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,458
[ALLEN]
Not yet.

277
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:51,791
[FO]
Dammit.

278
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:54,708
I can't see anything through
this. What's with all the fog?

279
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:57,250
[FO grunts, yelps]

280
00:21:58,625 --> 00:21:59,958
[FO yells]

281
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:02,541
[FO]
Ouch! My nose broke the fall!

282
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:04,500
Uhh!

283
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:07,333
Why the hell are these
scattered all over the forest?!

284
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:09,083
Uh.

285
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:11,208
Looks like a Karuta card.

286
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:15,125
Someone lost their deck.
Where did it come from?

287
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,666
Uh!

288
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:23,916
This isn't good.
Looks like I'm too late.

289
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:29,916
[LENALEE]
While awaiting Allen's return,

290
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,583
a messenger from
the Asian Branch

291
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:33,625
delivers the news of his fate.

292
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:36,875
Further pushing us towards
the abyss of despair.

293
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:40,375
Will we ever emerge?
And will we ever move on?

294
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:44,916
On the next <i>D. Gray-Man</i> :
"Loss and Reunion."
