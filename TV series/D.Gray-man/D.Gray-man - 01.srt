1
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,000
Exorcists...

2
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:45,041
Chosen, by God Himself...

3
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:50,125
They exist to destroy the evil
that lurks in the darkness...

4
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:54,208
an evil that brings pain
and suffering to the world.

5
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:45,291
Timcanpy! Timcanpy!

6
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:49,208
You should be
careful where you fly...

7
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:51,208
One of those cats'll eat ya.

8
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:55,791
It looks like you
could use some food.

9
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,500
Oh wow, thank you.

10
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,541
Oh, are you on a trip?

11
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:00,750
No ma'am...

12
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:03,541
I'm just on my way to
an important place.

13
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:06,375
I'm going to the
Exorcist Headquarters.

14
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,416
So have you heard?

15
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,541
Apparently a lot of people
have disappeared in there.

16
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,458
Well, since it was abandoned,

17
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,208
travelers without
money would sleep

18
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:22,291
in there before the
morning train came.

19
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,166
But they never make it
through the night,

20
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,166
only there clothes remain.

21
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,208
Then it's gotta
be cursed, right?

22
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,166
Remember what happened
there two years ago?

23
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:35,458
Come on Moa!

24
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:36,875
You're not really
going in there?

25
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:38,083
We've being flooded

26
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:39,791
with numerous complaints
about this place...

27
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:42,750
Innocent people have been
disappearing in here.

28
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:44,625
How many times do
I have to tell you?

29
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,125
This building's cursed!

30
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:47,458
Listen Charles...

31
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:50,333
We're going in
there no matter what.

32
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:54,250
This curse talk is rumor for
the civilians, not the police...

33
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:57,833
Now stop being a
baby and let's go.

34
00:03:57,916 --> 00:03:59,500
Okay.

35
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,666
It looks like a tornado
came through here.

36
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:12,875
I can't believe
anyone would choose

37
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:15,083
to spend the night
in such filth.

38
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,208
Augh!!

39
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:18,333
What?!

40
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:21,541
Waaah!! Something's
touching my foot!

41
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:25,166
It's just a cat.

42
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:46,416
Is everything alright...?

43
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,041
Moa?!

44
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,166
Moa?

45
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,125
I gotcha!

46
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:02,791
Who are you?

47
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,916
What are you
doing in this place?

48
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:07,958
You just made a big mistake.

49
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,041
You're a cop?!

50
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,416
That's right.
And you're under arrest?

51
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,041
Look... I'm really sorry...!

52
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,583
I was just trying
to catch that cat.

53
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,125
I guess...

54
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,791
I got a little carried away
and got a hold of you instead.

55
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,833
It's okay...

56
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:25,666
Believe me, I'm one
of the good guys.

57
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:28,875
I honestly had no
idea this place

58
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:31,333
had such a stigma
surrounding it.

59
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:34,333
Heck I just got into town a
few hours ago on the train.

60
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,625
And then I ran into this
annoying little cat...

61
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,375
The fur ball ate something
important of mine

62
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:39,500
so I chased him...

63
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,875
Next thing I knew I was in here.

64
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,625
You think I'm making this up...?

65
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,291
Master said it was my
responsibility now,

66
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:48,500
and that he'd have
my head if I lost it!

67
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:49,541
Really...?

68
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,500
May I speak to this Master?

69
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,333
Uhh... Sorry...

70
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:55,958
He went missing in
India a few weeks ago.

71
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,750
This is all your fault!

72
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,958
He is just a kid.

73
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:05,041
Just hold on a sec...

74
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:06,208
I have to go get my partner.

75
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,791
I'll be back soon.

76
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,416
What's that?

77
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,125
Don't you go anywhere!

78
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,458
Hello?!

79
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:35,791
No...

80
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,791
Charles.

81
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,083
My God...

82
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,791
The rumor...

83
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:56,333
Could it really be true?

84
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,250
What... I can't breathe.

85
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:07,041
Breathe easy...

86
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,166
This gas is very poisonous.

87
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,250
This is the work of an Akuma.

88
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,625
An...

89
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:16,708
Akuma?

90
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:18,333
Officer!

91
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,166
It's about time...

92
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,375
She's come to.

93
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:31,708
Oh my head...

94
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:32,416
Where am I?

95
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,458
At the station.

96
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:35,541
Captain!

97
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:37,500
Moa's awake and
ready for questioning!

98
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,708
Get her in here!

99
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,416
That kid...! Captain I...

100
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,666
We know.

101
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,833
We're questioning the
main suspect right now.

102
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:52,333
So your name is Allen Walker.

103
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:55,750
Admit it!

104
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:56,958
You murdered him!

105
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:58,625
I told you I'm innocent!

106
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,375
What proof do you
have that I did it...?

107
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,708
All I did was save the life
of one of your officers

108
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:04,666
before she succumbed to the gas.

109
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,958
A witness put you at
the scene of the crime...

110
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:08,333
Why were you there?

111
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,875
Look at your hand...

112
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,416
It's all covered in blood.

113
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,416
No it's not...

114
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,750
That's its natural color.

115
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:21,041
What... What the
hell is that...?

116
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,458
It's glowing green
for Christ's sake!

117
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:28,166
It's not looking good
for you right now, son.

118
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:31,500
I can only imagine your
parents are very disappointed.

119
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:32,500
Excuse me, sir.

120
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,708
Huh?

121
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:35,875
Mister Walker was with me

122
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:38,416
the entire time
before Charles was killed.

123
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,791
What?!

124
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,208
Uh, Captain...

125
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,375
I just got word from the crime
scene investigators that

126
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:46,541
a number of large caliber bullet
holes were found in the wall...

127
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,166
According to the boy...

128
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,416
The only possessions he had on
him were a cat and a suitcase.

129
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,875
There's no evidence
to suggest the boy

130
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:55,500
had the gun on him,
much less fired it.

131
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,791
It's looking like
the kid's clean.

132
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,708
Why did you pass out...?!

133
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:03,083
Explain yourself Moa!

134
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:05,916
I'm... sorry I failed you, sir.

135
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,458
I can't believe you
didn't get a look

136
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,750
at the killers face
when you were right there.

137
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,375
Uhh, I think I know
who you're looking for.

138
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:17,208
Although I didn't actually
see it with my own eyes,

139
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,000
I know who did it...

140
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,500
I can help you capture
him if you'll allow me.

141
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,916
Your suspect is
what's called an Akuma.

142
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,958
They're common...

143
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,833
and there very
deadly to humans...

144
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:30,041
It will keep killing
until we stop it...

145
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:31,291
and it's important that you make

146
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,583
the first strike before
it becomes too strong.

147
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,958
Akuma?

148
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:39,500
This is an anti-Akuma weapon...

149
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,625
Now is anyone familiar
with... exorcists?

150
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,041
Don't worry.

151
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,250
I'm a clergyman whose sole
mission is to hunt Akuma.

152
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,708
Oh, Exorcists?

153
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,833
What a load of crap.

154
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:03,916
You're free to leave...

155
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,750
Now get out of my sight...

156
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:08,416
I'm heading back to my office.

157
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,958
Officer Moa...!

158
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:12,916
Mister Walker is not to leave
your sight, you got that?!

159
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,375
Huh?

160
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,416
I heard a cop was
killed in the old church.

161
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,541
Not just killed.

162
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,291
I heard he was massacred.

163
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,333
It sounds like the
rumors about this place

164
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,625
being possessed
are true after all.

165
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:28,583
I wonder what will happen next?

166
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,666
How did it become possessed?

167
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,000
I don't know the whole story,

168
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,750
but it had to do with
a newlywed couple

169
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,125
that had a horrible accident.

170
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:49,208
My precious little Akuma.

171
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:53,458
You must take innocent
life to continue evolving.

172
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:55,083
Brother...?

173
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:55,875
Marc?

174
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,041
I'm home...!

175
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,875
You feeling any better?

176
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,833
Welcome home, Moa.

177
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,708
You've come home early today.

178
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,250
What's the occasion?

179
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,166
Look Marc...

180
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,541
You're not eating anything
at all these days...

181
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:14,166
How do you expect
to have any strength?

182
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:18,916
I just haven't
had an appetite...

183
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,541
It's fine.

184
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,041
Don't worry...

185
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:26,000
I'll be hungry again soon.

186
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:31,333
Whatever you do,
don't stop fighting...

187
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,666
My sister would
want it that way.

188
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,916
Hey, easy with
the claws already!

189
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:43,375
Real nice...

190
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:44,750
Let me take a guess...

191
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:47,250
You were gonna try to
get to the crime scene?

192
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,208
Just for a second.

193
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,625
Absolutely not!

194
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,083
I'm so close.

195
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,708
I just hope I can find this
monster before it's too late.

196
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:04,791
So tell me.

197
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,125
Allen, how confident are you

198
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,666
that the killer is
an actual Akuma?

199
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:10,958
Huh?

200
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:13,083
This encyclopedia says
Akuma are imaginary demons

201
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,166
that were created by
ancient civilizations

202
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:18,833
to explain illness
and natural disasters.

203
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:22,458
You're telling me that's are
killer, some make believe demon.

204
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,541
I'm not buying it.

205
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:28,250
The encyclopedia is
talking about something

206
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,875
entirely different than
what I'm looking for.

207
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:34,791
Akuma's also the
name of a weapon.

208
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,208
Weapons that are
specifically created

209
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:41,958
to target mankind are the Akuma
I'm concerned with finding.

210
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,375
They take on the
form of humans,

211
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:46,000
so they're very
difficult to find.

212
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,125
Marc, are you okay?

213
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,000
What's wrong?

214
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,166
What's happening?

215
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,791
Oh my God.

216
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,000
Moa, can you hear me?

217
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,666
Are you hurt?

218
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,041
Where are we?

219
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,375
We're back in the church.

220
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,500
What's that...

221
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,875
Don't tell me you actually
caught the bullet!

222
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:57,875
Don't touch it!

223
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,791
This came from an Akuma...

224
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:03,291
Each bullet is filled with an
extremely destructive virus...

225
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,500
They use a defense system

226
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,791
where they transform
their bodies into guns.

227
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:09,583
Making them highly
effective killers.

228
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:12,041
After a bullet hits you,
it takes less than a minute

229
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:15,250
for the virus to eat
away your insides.

230
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,041
I couldn't save you kitty.

231
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,458
I'm sorry.

232
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,291
So then.

233
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:28,166
Tell me what happened to Marc?

234
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,750
Well...

235
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:33,041
Akuma take over a dead person's
body to blend in with society.

236
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,791
That wasn't your brother, Moa.

237
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:38,500
An Akuma had already killed him
and taken over his corpse.

238
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,791
So... you mean that Marc...

239
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,375
was already dead?

240
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:45,041
Come here!

241
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,333
Hey!

242
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:53,041
What in the hell are
you two doing here?!

243
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:53,583
Captain!

244
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:54,833
Ouh... My God...

245
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:55,916
What the hell?

246
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,500
Men...! Fire!

247
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,583
Your guns are useless...!

248
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,375
Get out of here while you can!

249
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,166
Oh no!

250
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,500
Captain...?

251
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,708
Oh my God...

252
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,416
You damn monster...!

253
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,125
Why did you have
to kill them...?!

254
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:29,083
Tell me!

255
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:30,583
It can't hear you...

256
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:31,708
Look...

257
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:33,750
It's not doing it
because it wants to.

258
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:34,916
It's programmed to do nothing

259
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,291
but seek evolution
through murder.

260
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:40,041
So you're just a mindless
killing machine?!

261
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,583
No...

262
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:44,166
They're living weapons who carry
around the souls of others.

263
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,291
These souls are
controlled by the Maker,

264
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,250
and are conscious to
what's happened to them.

265
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:51,375
They're left to agonize over
their sins, fully aware

266
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:55,000
of their situation but unable
to do anything about it.

267
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,625
All of these pent up feelings

268
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:58,958
are used as energy
for the Akuma,

269
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:03,250
allowing it to evolve
quickly and efficiently.

270
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:06,500
I can see this Akuma's soul...

271
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,083
Hold on...

272
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:10,208
It's a woman...

273
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:12,750
She has a strong bond with Marc.

274
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,750
Akuma are machines not
made of mechanical parts,

275
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:20,000
but from the sorrow experienced
by the souls they inhabit.

276
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:23,250
Everyone has a dark
side within their heart.

277
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,583
The Maker seeks out anyone
whose dark side has grown

278
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:31,208
due to a recent personal tragedy
and transforms them into Akuma.

279
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,583
Tragedy.

280
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,250
Now Claire, are you
and Moa still fighting?

281
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,041
We are.

282
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,583
I just don't want
her to become a cop...

283
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:48,583
I fear that doing it
just to catch the people

284
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:51,750
who killed your parents
is the wrong reason.

285
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:52,791
Claire...

286
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,458
Moa isn't becoming
a police officer

287
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:56,333
so she can seek revenge...

288
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:57,916
She wants to
protect us and others

289
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,541
from all the bad people in
the world, so we can be happy.

290
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:04,666
Have faith...

291
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,375
Believe me... It's okay...

292
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,500
Just sit down with her later.

293
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:10,541
It's our wedding day
and you look beautiful,

294
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:12,791
so let's just focus on us.

295
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,125
You're right...

296
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:17,708
I'll have faith.

297
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:30,375
Oh my God.

298
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:34,708
God damn you!!!

299
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,333
Good evening son.

300
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:44,375
Look at my newest
attractive body.

301
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:47,333
It can take a soul and
revive it back to life.

302
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,000
Maybe even get your Claire back

303
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:52,000
from the clutches of
your detestable God.

304
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:55,750
But in order to do so, it
needs a little of your help.

305
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:58,333
All you need do is call
out Claire's name,

306
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,583
and she shall return.

307
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:02,250
So all I have to do
is say her name

308
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:03,875
and she'll come back to life.

309
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,541
Exactly.

310
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:13,500
Come back Claire!

311
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:18,916
Marc...?

312
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,750
Is, is that you?

313
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:21,666
Claire!

314
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,083
Why'd you do it...?!

315
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,083
You've turned me
into an Akuma...

316
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,250
There's no escaping!

317
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:28,833
You did well son,

318
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:32,375
but your once bride-to-be
will do you one better.

319
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:37,458
I order you to kill this man
and wear his body as your own.

320
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,708
Happy Birthday...!

321
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:59,416
You are now complete.

322
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,625
No... It can't be...

323
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:06,500
Impossible!

324
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:09,750
There's no way that's my sister!

325
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,375
Sacred cross that
dwells within me...

326
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:24,291
Grant me the power to
destroy this evil darkness.

327
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:34,625
Bring forth salvation to
this tormented Akuma's soul.

328
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,708
I'm sorry to have to do this...

329
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:47,583
Your suffering will end
forever in just a moment.

330
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,750
May you rest in peace...

331
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,750
Claire.

332
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:07,416
Thank you.

333
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:21,958
My brother and Claire...

334
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:24,833
they're together in
heaven now, right?

335
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:26,333
Together and happy...

336
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,000
for sure.

337
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,958
I just don't understand.

338
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,666
He's called The
Millennium Earl...

339
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,916
That's the name
the Maker goes by...

340
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,333
He's enacted a plan that will
wipe out mankind if he succeeds.

341
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:45,000
As an Exorcist, it's my job
to put an end to his reign.

342
00:20:52,583 --> 00:21:02,541
Are you ready...
let's get out of here.

343
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:12,541
Are you ready...
let's get out of here.

344
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:22,583
Are you ready...
let's get out of here.

345
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:32,583
Are you ready...
let's get out of here.

346
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:42,583
Are you ready...
let's get out of here.

347
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:52,583
Are you ready...
let's get out of here.

348
00:21:52,666 --> 00:22:02,625
Are you ready...
let's get out of here.

349
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:12,625
Are you ready...
let's get out of here.

350
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:22,625
Are you ready...
let's get out of here.

351
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:32,625
Are you ready...
let's get out of here.

352
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:37,583
Are you ready...
let's get out of here.

353
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:39,458
I'm heading to the
Exorcist Headquarters,

354
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:42,250
commonly known
as the Black Order.

355
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:44,750
But before I can
even set foot indoors,

356
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:48,583
a man with a sword pointed at
me intends to strike me down.

357
00:22:48,666 --> 00:22:50,666
On the next D. Gray-man:

358
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,083
"The Black Order."

359
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:55,875
Bring forth salvation to this
tormented Akuma's soul.
