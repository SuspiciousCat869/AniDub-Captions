1
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:47,333
Road, stop it, Lero, stop!

2
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:48,708
I think I'm gonna be sick!

3
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:49,958
No way!

4
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:52,666
I'm having too much
fun to stop now!

5
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:53,666
But that's exactly my point!

6
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,166
This is no time
to be having fun!

7
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,583
The Earl is going to
punish us as soon as

8
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:58,458
he finds out you took
me without permission!

9
00:01:58,541 --> 00:02:01,500
And you know how
I hate being spanked!

10
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,000
Would you stop
worrying, Lero...?

11
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:08,208
I told you, he won't scold us!

12
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:09,333
Oh boy...

13
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:11,416
This last day's been fun...

14
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,583
He's such a joy to fight.

15
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:32,208
This town is perfect.

16
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:34,958
Its people are
well-off and peaceful.

17
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:37,833
This seems to be a happy
and successful village...

18
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:42,625
They are excellent specimens
for creating faithful Akuma.

19
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,750
I miss you so much!

20
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,750
But timing is everything,

21
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:54,375
when a happy human
has been plunged

22
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,750
into the depths of sadness...

23
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:58,750
I will come.

24
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,875
Good evening Miss.

25
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,916
You no longer need
to cry my child...

26
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,750
I can bring your husband back
from that detestable God.

27
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:12,500
I will call back your husband's
soul to its rightful place,

28
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:15,041
but first you must
do something for me...

29
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:19,666
From the depths of your
heart, call out to him.

30
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,583
My love...

31
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:29,166
Come back to me!!!

32
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,375
No... my love...

33
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:38,458
Is that really you?!

34
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:42,708
What...? How could
you do this...?

35
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:46,166
You turned me into an Akuma!!

36
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,458
Now you will
follow this order...

37
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:52,333
Kill your wife and wear
her body as your own.

38
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,291
Komui?

39
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,625
You're finally awake...

40
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:11,166
How are you feeling?

41
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,000
I've been a lot better...

42
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:14,166
So tell me...

43
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,000
Is Lenalee doing alright?

44
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,083
She's fine...

45
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:19,041
It's certainly nothing
to worry about.

46
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,333
I'm glad she's doing well...

47
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:23,750
What type of treatment
is she receiving?

48
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,916
It's called acupuncture...

49
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,166
It's a Chinese therapy

50
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,916
that uses needles in the
skin to relieve pain.

51
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,166
Sounds painful.

52
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,958
You can give it a try
if you'd like to...

53
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,875
What...? No way!

54
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:39,250
Can I ask you a question?

55
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,583
Please do.

56
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:42,916
Okay...

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,166
Why did you choose to
come all the way out here

58
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,750
when you have so much
work to do back home...?

59
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,041
Of course you
care for Lenalee,

60
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:51,958
but you're here
for something else.

61
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:56,000
What can you tell me
about the Noah family?

62
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:59,375
He came here to ask
me that same question.

63
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:01,875
What's he doing here?

64
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:03,875
I didn't even see him come in.

65
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,250
The Noah family has
had great influence

66
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,875
for generations but
you'd never know it...

67
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:12,375
And their power has never
been officially recorded...

68
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,291
Yet, somehow they've
always popped up

69
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:17,208
at the major turning
points in history.

70
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:18,416
They've appeared once again

71
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,083
and have taken the
side of the Earl...

72
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:22,041
That's the reason why
your Chief came here.

73
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:23,583
To speak with the Bookmen,

74
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:26,625
who are the only known living
humans to have knowledge--

75
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,375
Talk is cheap...

76
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:35,208
Still don't know when to
keep your mouth shut, eh...?

77
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:36,708
How many times must I say it?

78
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:39,666
The Bookmen's information
can't be divulged to outsiders.

79
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,625
What's he doing here?

80
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,916
Where are all these
people coming from?

81
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,041
Easy...

82
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,416
I don't see the big deal...

83
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,291
I mean you're getting up
there in years grandpa,

84
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,291
so I'll be replacing
you soon anyway.

85
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:51,250
You fool...!

86
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,750
Only you could be naïve enough

87
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:55,000
to think you're worthy
of filling my shoes.

88
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,000
You crusty old panda.

89
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,041
Oww!

90
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,541
You old coot!

91
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:03,125
Allen Walker.

92
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:06,416
The prophecy speaks of you as
being the Destroyer of Time.

93
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,541
Yes...

94
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:09,125
That's right.

95
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:12,375
On behalf of all the Bookmen,
it is an honor to meet you...

96
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:13,583
Bookmen?

97
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,208
We investigate
secrets in history

98
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,958
that aren't part of official
record and make them official.

99
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:21,041
Let me tell ya, a lot
of hard work goes into...

100
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,083
Oww...!

101
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:22,833
That hurt!

102
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,125
Shut your mouth!

103
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:30,500
We are currently acting as
Exorcists with special duties.

104
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:34,291
I don't have a typical name...

105
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,208
So just call me Bookman.

106
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,375
Oh, okay.

107
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:46,416
Now that is very strange...

108
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,333
It appears as if
your left eye has

109
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:51,416
begun to regenerate
of its own volition...

110
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,000
I suppose my needle treatment
won't be necessary after all.

111
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,583
I guess that means
I'm pretty lucky...

112
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,625
I heard it's a
curse of some kind.

113
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,375
Yes... it is...

114
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:06,166
I injured it as a boy when I
turned my father into an Akuma.

115
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,666
You should probably
lie down and get some rest...

116
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,291
When Miss Lenalee
awakens you'll need

117
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,708
to report for an
assignment immediately...

118
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:14,958
So be ready.

119
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:22,791
Tell me, how did it go?

120
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,083
Just fine...

121
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,666
He said treatment
wouldn't even be necessary.

122
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,000
That's good...

123
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,708
You could probably
use a bit of fresh air.

124
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,583
So why don't we take a walk?

125
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:37,791
Woah!

126
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,375
Sounds like they're having some
sort of festival, doesn't it?

127
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:40,416
Yeah.

128
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,958
So how old are you?

129
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:43,166
About fifteen.

130
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,208
Ah, I'm older than you...

131
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:46,958
I'm eighteen.

132
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:49,916
Fifteen, huh?

133
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,708
I guess it's just your gray hair
that makes you look older.

134
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,041
My hair?

135
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:57,375
So, Lavi's my name, but
people call me Junior...?

136
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:58,791
What's your nickname...?

137
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:02,041
What about "Short Stack"
sound alright kid?

138
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:04,375
Well that is what Yu
referred to you as.

139
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:05,291
Yu?

140
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,166
Oh wait...

141
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,541
So you don't know...?

142
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,208
That's Kanda's first name...

143
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:10,791
It caught me off guard too...

144
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:11,958
Strange huh?

145
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,541
I didn't know that...

146
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,541
I thought he just went by Kanda.

147
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:18,500
Next time you run into him...
you should call him Yu

148
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,875
and see if you can get a
good reaction out of him.

149
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:25,625
Of course you probably won't
see him for quite a while...

150
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:27,250
I have a feeling
that our assignments

151
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:31,250
are only gonna get longer and
more difficult as time goes on.

152
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:31,916
Really?

153
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,333
Why do you say that?

154
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:36,583
The Noah family appearing
is proof enough for me...

155
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:40,666
It most likely means the Earl is
stepping up his operations...

156
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:43,666
We'll have to play again soon.

157
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:47,583
And next time we'll let the Lord
Millennium set the stage for us!

158
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:49,708
Well that's the reality

159
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:52,750
of the situation so we
need to be ready...

160
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,041
Damn him...

161
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,916
I became an Exorcist
for one reason.

162
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,625
To destroy Akuma...

163
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:03,458
not to murder my
fellow human beings.

164
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,250
Hey... Hold on...

165
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,458
You okay...? What's
wrong, Short Stack?

166
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,000
My name's Allen!

167
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,458
I'm going ahead on my own.

168
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:12,833
I'll meet up with you later.

169
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:14,458
Whew...

170
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:17,208
It's just a joke...

171
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:29,250
I need to wrap my head
around this Noah family...

172
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:32,500
Why are they
working with The Earl?

173
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,750
Feels nice, doesn't it?

174
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:38,625
This is how it's supposed to
feel when two humans embrace.

175
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:54,500
What's going on?

176
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,875
I feel scared...

177
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,000
What am I afraid of...?

178
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:06,083
Is it the idea of
being around humans?

179
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,916
Any one of them
could be Akuma...

180
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:15,125
Without my left eye,
I'm useless...

181
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:20,666
There's no way I'm able to
tell Akumas from humans...

182
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,708
I might as well be blind!

183
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,583
Want some flowers...?

184
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:35,208
You should smell them,
they're fantastic.

185
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:37,000
They're really pretty...

186
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,958
Mister Exorcist.

187
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:49,875
Mister Exorcist.

188
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,958
Now die... Exorcist scum!

189
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:03,166
That sure was a close one...
gotta be careful, Short Stack...

190
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,250
Lavi.

191
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:05,333
Who else would it be?

192
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:06,791
Y'know it's way too dangerous

193
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,000
to be out on these
streets by yourself.

194
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:13,916
Ah great!

195
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,875
Look out!

196
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,375
It's a monster!

197
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:19,458
Big Hammer Little Hammer...

198
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,416
Grow, grow, GROW!

199
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,375
It's huge!

200
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:24,750
Keep your head down!

201
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,166
Take this!

202
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:40,541
He destroyed the whole building!

203
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:43,333
The nerve of those Akuma playing
ball in the street like that.

204
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:44,375
Come on...

205
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:45,958
Let's get outta
here while we can...

206
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,958
The street is the worst place
to be to get stuck in a battle.

207
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,666
Um, right.

208
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,458
Ready...? Now hold on.

209
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:56,125
Okay.

210
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:57,541
Big hammer, little hammer...!

211
00:11:57,625 --> 00:12:00,458
Extend!

212
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:07,666
Who the hell are they?

213
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,458
Police...!

214
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,416
Someone get the police!

215
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:16,208
That is every single trace
of information I have

216
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:18,750
on the Noah family
in my records.

217
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,500
This will be a huge help to us.

218
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,416
Thank you, Bookman...

219
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,000
I'm sorry all this took so long.

220
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,625
I really appreciate it.

221
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:26,958
Well, of course...

222
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:29,291
I'm only doing my job.

223
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:35,041
I know how stressful this
must be for you, Chief Komui...

224
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:37,958
The presence of Akuma
alone is troubling enough...

225
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:39,416
but the addition
of the Noah family

226
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,166
will complicate
things even further.

227
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,000
It's not so bad...

228
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:47,166
Those who really have
it hard are the Exorcists.

229
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:49,625
But, me...?

230
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:51,166
All I do is send
them into battles

231
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,708
to do the dirty work while
I stay back at headquarters.

232
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,791
Everyone's in pain...

233
00:12:56,875 --> 00:13:01,125
In times of war, suffering
is what brings us all together.

234
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,541
Hey, are you gonna
throw up, Short Stack...?

235
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:08,500
Y'alright?

236
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:10,583
It's Allen!

237
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,416
That weapon is incredible...

238
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,125
I can't believe it can fly, too!

239
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:15,125
I know...

240
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:17,208
I couldn't live without it.

241
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:18,916
Doesn't it get heavy...?

242
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,083
Especially when
it fully extends?

243
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:22,333
Not at all...

244
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:25,041
It stays the same weight
no matter what its size.

245
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,250
Wow.

246
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,750
So uh... what in the
heck is wrong with you?

247
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,083
Huh?

248
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:31,458
Back in town,

249
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,333
why did you wait until they
transformed to attack?

250
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:34,791
That'll get you killed quick...!

251
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:35,583
You know?

252
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:36,916
Yeah.

253
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,833
I take it your left eye
can detect Akuma

254
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:41,958
and it's not working.

255
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:43,375
Then you have to do this

256
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:46,958
just assume every human
you come across is a bad guy.

257
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,333
But that doesn't work...

258
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:52,750
Because only a small amount
of humans are actually Akuma.

259
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,250
Sure you can say that...

260
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,458
But here's the thing...

261
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:59,416
I can see you're afraid
of humans... right?

262
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,750
You feel defenseless without
the use of your eye...

263
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:08,291
Now you're noticing how exposed
you are with normal sight.

264
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:14,166
I'm afraid, you might be right.

265
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,666
Look here...

266
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,458
You can't afford to trust
anyone until your eyes fixed...

267
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:20,416
Because any of those
people could be an Akuma.

268
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:25,083
It's a threat that we're forced
to deal with every single day.

269
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,833
So then what do you
usually do to deal with it?

270
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:32,750
I pretty much assume every human
is an Akuma and I trust no one.

271
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:35,083
For most Exorcists,

272
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,375
we're all at a huge
disadvantage...

273
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:40,500
We're not like you with
your all-seeing eye.

274
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:45,000
Unfortunately, Akuma easily
blend in with humans...

275
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,708
There's no way
for us to distinguish

276
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:50,000
between friend and foe
when we're in a crowd.

277
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:53,375
This is the case for pretty
much all of us Exorcists...

278
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:56,708
We see humans as allies to
the Earl in one way or another.

279
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:57,791
Hold on.

280
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,875
You're wrong...

281
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:03,416
You can't just kill everyone
because you don't trust them.

282
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,166
That's true...

283
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,208
Good point...

284
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:07,750
That's why I wear this coat.

285
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:08,916
Huh?

286
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
This coat draws the
Akuma closer to me.

287
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:22,041
There he is!

288
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,625
It's him!

289
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:25,041
He's so handsome.

290
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:28,041
He really stands out
in a crowd, doesn't he?

291
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:29,833
Master...

292
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:30,958
I don't understand...

293
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,083
Why do you have that coat?

294
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,791
You're attracting a
lot of attention.

295
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,250
Foolish apprentice...

296
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,333
Because I'm different
from you, you idiot.

297
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:39,666
Huh?

298
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:48,625
Master...!

299
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,833
This is exactly what
I was afraid of earlier...!

300
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,458
Now we're surrounded
because of that coat!

301
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:55,416
What's the problem with that?

302
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:13,833
I don't see any point in trying
to hide from your enemy,

303
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:16,291
when your enemy is invisible...

304
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:17,791
This coat is a target

305
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:21,000
and by wearing it I can suspect
anyone who approaches me.

306
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,250
Hey, what's wrong?

307
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:32,791
Lavi.

308
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:33,791
Hm?

309
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,000
Aren't you always
afraid though...

310
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:38,291
being the target of
Akuma wherever you go?

311
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:42,375
To be perfectly honest
I'm more afraid of humans...

312
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,250
because someone I'm good
friends with today...

313
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:47,166
could be an Akuma tomorrow.

314
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,625
It happened recently...

315
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,833
A guy I knew turned
into an Akuma...

316
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:53,958
He and I had actually been
close, personal friends

317
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,708
for some time.

318
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:56,916
Don't get me wrong...

319
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,375
it drives me nuts...

320
00:16:58,458 --> 00:16:59,708
But listen...

321
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:02,000
What other choice do I have?

322
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:04,458
Destroying the Akuma
I come across keeps me alive,

323
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:06,625
then so be it.

324
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,750
You must be prepared to
make yourself a target...

325
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:13,541
in order to protect the
humans around you...

326
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:17,875
Are you capable of
handling that...? Allen?

327
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:24,125
He's over there!

328
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:24,833
Where?

329
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:27,500
Yes, those are the ones.

330
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:30,500
Get your hands up...! Right now!

331
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:32,166
You...

332
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,166
You're coming with me.

333
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,125
Wait, uh... What'd we do?

334
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:38,375
That's enough outta you, kid!

335
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:45,000
He's an Exorcist...!
He's mine...

336
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,458
Watch out!

337
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:55,666
We're outmanned!

338
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,291
Yeah...! I know!

339
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:01,291
Big Hammer Little Hammer...!
Grow...! Grow...

340
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:11,458
Grow!

341
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:13,583
Come on...! You need
to be quicker than that!

342
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:14,291
Right...

343
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,208
I will!

344
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:17,500
It makes sense now...

345
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:20,625
All Exorcists, including
Lavi and Master Cross,

346
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,541
must see humans as the enemy,

347
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,375
just like I'm having
to do right now.

348
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,875
By using themselves
as a decoy in order

349
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:30,208
to draw in the Akuma,
they use the best ways

350
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:33,375
they're capable of to protect
the innocent people around them.

351
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,708
It's a completely
different way of fighting.

352
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,916
Hey, nice shot.

353
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,083
I've been a poor excuse
for an apprentice...

354
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,500
How could I just now be
understanding Master's guidance,

355
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:50,291
years after he taught it to me?

356
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:51,375
I wonder...

357
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:55,041
if you even have
that fear... Allen.

358
00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:01,291
I finally get what he meant
when he spoke of the fear.

359
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,958
If my left eye
can ease any fears

360
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,333
among my fellow Exorcists

361
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,750
while I fight alongside
them in battle...

362
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:10,708
If I can provide
just that one luxury...

363
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,708
Yeah...! We got 'em!

364
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,666
Please...

365
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,041
Please, somebody help me!

366
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,958
Help me, Please!

367
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,250
Thank you so much!

368
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:52,708
Are you hurt?

369
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:58,333
Nice try.

370
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,125
Not bad, kid.

371
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:16,750
Thanks.

372
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,666
Looks like your eye healed up.

373
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:28,000
Wow, that was fast, huh?

374
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,583
Woah, it's snowing!

375
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:32,583
Check it out!

376
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:33,833
Can you believe it?

377
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:36,416
See Allen...? Look!

378
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,000
Hey, you!

379
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:39,291
C'mere!!

380
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:40,875
Come back here!!

381
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,208
Hahahaha...

382
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,708
I'm gonna get ya!!

383
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,958
I'm gonna get ya...!

384
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:49,458
I made the decision
to take this path...

385
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,833
the path of an Exorcist...

386
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:53,916
I need to be prepared...

387
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
and I need this coat.

388
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:41,291
Far gone lies a town that
suffers from turbulent weather.

389
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:45,083
One moment there's a blizzard,
and the next a heat wave.

390
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:47,208
Kanda, Lavi and
myself are traveling

391
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:49,875
to this village to
face a dangerous threat.

392
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:51,291
On the next D. Gray-man:

393
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:52,708
"The Leaf of Revival."

394
00:22:52,791 --> 00:22:56,291
Bring forth salvation to this
tormented Akuma's soul.
