Allen!

00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:43,833
Road? What...?

3
00:01:43,916 --> 00:01:46,833
How I missed you!

4
00:01:46,916 --> 00:01:48,791
Have you gone totally
insane, Mistress Road?

5
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:51,833
You can't kiss
an Exorcist! Lero!

6
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:55,916
[CELL] He's alive.
See? He's alive!

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,750

Yes, yes. We can all see.

[ALL groan]

9
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:02,541
[TYKI] I got hungry while
we were waiting for you.

10
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:04,458
Care to join?

11
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:07,250
A chance to catch up before
we get down to business?

12
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:10,291
Afraid I'll have to
decline. You see...

13
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:12,750
We're kind of pressed
for time right now.

14
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:14,291
Speaking of which...

15
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:18,250
Would you care to know
how much time is left?

16
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:21,583
[ROAD] Look outside.
It's a wonderful view.

17
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,125
[TYKI] The only location
which still remains

18
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:30,958
is the tower we're standing in.
Everywhere else

19
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:34,166
has sadly collapsed
and disappeared for good.

20
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:37,458
[LENALEE]
It can't be!

21

[LENALEE, LAVI gasp]

22
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,666
Please stay awhile.

23
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,583
Come and join us.
Please, have a seat.

Go ahead and shoot.

[ROAD chuckles]

30
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:05,916
What a sweetheart
you are, Allen.

31
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,708
You really hate me, don't you?

32
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,625
Go ahead and shoot me.

33
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:15,750
But don't forget, that arm
of yours is also a weapon.

34
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,333
[ALLEN]
Tyki Mikk.

35
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:40,875
[TYKI] Poor boy.
Didn't you know?

36
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:43,541
Innocence isn't impervious.

37
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,625
Now then.

38
00:04:57,708 --> 00:05:00,416
I believe that you and I are
overdue for a discussion.

39
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,958
Right, boy?

40
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:10,416
[TYKI] Oh, come on,
don't make that face.

41
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,875
It isn't becoming on you.

42
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:15,208
I promised you no
tricks, didn't I?

43
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:18,500
I'm not trying to trap you.

44
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,041
[ROAD giggles]

45
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:22,291
Yeah, don't be afraid, Allen!

46
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:24,000
[LERO]
What are you doing, Lero?

47
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:27,541
Stop hanging all
over him like that!

48
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,666
I set up the exit door!

49
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:34,125
It's all the way on the top
floor of this castle!

50
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:41,583
I hope it actually does
take us out of the Ark.

51
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,083
[ROAD giggles]

[LENALEE gasps]

53
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,583
[TYKI] The only location
which still remains

54
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,958
is the tower we're standing in.

[LENALEE]
Krory.

57
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:10,875
[LENALEE] We left
them behind. Are they...?

58
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,458
Let's try to be strong, okay?

59
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:22,458
Allen's trying, too.

60
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:31,708
[LENALEE] That's right.
I promised I'd try hard.

61
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,250
Get a hold of
yourself, Lenalee.

62
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:38,875
[LENALEE] This isn't
the time for crying.

63
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:48,291
Anita's death.
They had a hand in it.

64
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:02,041
[CHAOZII] Can she tell
what I'm thinking?

65
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:05,208
No. I'm just a regular human.

66
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:08,000
I can never defeat
one of the Noah clan.

67
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:16,583
[ALLEN] So tell me what this
is really about, Tyki Mikk.

68
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:19,875
Sorry, but I have no
reason to trust you.

69
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:23,041
You have no reason to act
all self-righteous, either.

70
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,625
I don't need to remind you
that you were the first Exorcist

71
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:28,708
to strip one of the Noah clan
down to his underwear.

72
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:31,375
You and I?
We're bound by destiny.

73
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:32,625
No, we're not.

74
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,541
Your friends lost their
shirts in that game too.

75
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:37,375
What makes you so special?

76
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:40,166
Now that is some
pretty big talk, boy.

77
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,625
You should respect your elders.

78
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:47,041
You want to talk about
my Innocence, right?

79
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,500
[TYKI chuckles]

80
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:53,500
To be quite honest, I was blown
away when I saw what happened.

81
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:56,458
I thought for certain I had
decimated that pesky thing.

82
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,583
Well, it's right here
in front of you.

83
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,291
So I guess that
you thought wrong.

84
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:04,916
Ooh. So Tycky's interested
in Innocence now? Who knew?

85
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:14,291
[TYKI] Perhaps a little bit.
Tell me, boy.

86
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:17,875
Teez devoured your heart and yet
here you stand, still alive.

87
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:20,125
I'm assuming that was
thanks to your left arm?

88
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,166
[BOTH gasp]

89
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,541
What'd he say?

90
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:25,041
Are you serious?
You mean your heart got eaten

91
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:28,125
and you didn't think it was
important to let us know?

92
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:33,708
[ALLEN] Uh, I just didn't
want you guys to worry.

93
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,625
Part of my Innocence
actually took the place

94
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:39,083
of my heart, so it's
not really a problem.

95
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:40,833
Allen, too?

96
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:43,750
[BOOKMAN]
Innocence making the choice

97
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:47,333
to save its Accommodator
is unprecedented!

98
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:55,500
[LAVI] That's crazy. When it
happened to Lenalee, it was

99
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:59,333
the first known case of a person
being saved by their Innocence.

100
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:14,208
[LAVI] But it's happened twice.
Lenalee and Allen.

101
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:17,541
At first we thought Lenalee's
Innocence might be the Heart,

102
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:20,416
but maybe we were
simplifying things too much.

103
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,875
There's supposed to
be only one Heart.

104
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,833
Now that we're
looking at two cases,

105
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:28,583
I'm thinking this
goes a lot deeper.

106
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:32,000
[ROAD] Are you
taking notes, Bookman?

107
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,875
[LAVI gasps]

00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:37,000

111
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,875
That's enough.
I'll have to ask you

112
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:49,416
to step away from
the boy, all right, Road?

113
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,916
No! I love him,
he's mine now!

Don't be silly, Road.

117
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,875
You know very well that Noahs
and Exorcists can't be together.

Anyway. Lord Millennium

121
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:08,833
has the ending
all planned out.

122
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:11,833
I've played along
with it, half-seriously.

123
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,916
Evil should have a sense
of levity to it, no?

124
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,291
But thanks to you, boy,

125
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:19,541
I'm beginning to understand
what needs to be done.

126
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:23,500
[TYKI] In other words,
I should take

127
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:26,708
eliminating you
very seriously.

128
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:42,250
[ALLEN] Tyki Mikk. I have
something to say to you too.

129
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:46,000
If you do one more thing to
hurt any of my friends...

130
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:52,166
Then you'd better be
prepared for me to kill you.

[ALLEN]
Trust me, Lenalee.

I'll take care of
this guy for good!

You've got some nerve,
don't you?

not so bad after all.

Turns out Tycky likes Allen too.

You best stay
out of it, Bookman.

138
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:23,541
Play with me instead, won't you?

139
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,791
It won't be long before
the ark disappears.

Well, well. Tell me, what
are you thinking right now?

143
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:08,916
Are you enjoying our quaint
little fight to the death?

144
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,333
Is it as much fun as when
you beat me at cards

the day we first met?

146
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:17,750
Lose the poker face and
tell it to me straight, boy.

147
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:27,166
Honestly, I'm sad. Every time
I see you, I'm reminded.

148
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:31,750
Of how you're not human,
and yet you are.

149
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:35,333
I wish this <i>was</i>
just a poker game.

158
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,125
Yeah.

159
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:08,708
I'm keeping them locked away,
but I won't hurt them for now.

160
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:11,500
So let's play a game, okay?

161
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,958
Lavi...

162
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:18,583
What do you think
he's gonna do?

163
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:21,625
[LAVI] The oldest child
of the Noah clan.

164
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,583
Road, was it?

165
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:25,791
All right, fine, I'll play,
but you have to promise

166
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:28,208
to let them go if I win.

167
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,208
Eh. Sure, whatever.

168
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:44,083
Lavi!

169
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,708
[LAVI gasps]

170
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,833
[LENALEE]
Lavi!

171
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,625
Go, Teez.

172
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,666
Now, Crown Clown!

173
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:03,583
[ALLEN]
Clown Belt!

174
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:05,250
Lavi, no!

175
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,208
[ALLEN grunts]

176
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,416
[TYKI] I kinda feel
sorry for your friend.

177
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,916
You'd better hope
playing with Road

178
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,208
doesn't cause his mind to
completely disintegrate.

179
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:20,791
Oh, well. You should
worry about yourself first.

180
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:24,916
[ALLEN grunts]

181
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,541
[ALLEN]
Right, I forgot.

182
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:33,541
You have the ability to pass
through anything you want.

183
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:38,250
[TYKI] Indeed. I'm not bound
by any object in the world.

184
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:42,416
In fact, I can even
walk through the air.

185
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,833
My powers allow me to
override any obstacle

186
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:48,708
or cross any barrier I please.

187
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:52,875
Well, technically. Innocence is
the one exception to that rule.

188
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,750
Ain't that a kick in the head?

189
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:58,208
It's not considered part
of this world, so...

190
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,250
[TYKI chuckles]

191
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:25,041
[TYKI chuckles]

192
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:49,875
[ALLEN grunts]

193
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,666
[TYKI grunts]

194
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,416
[ALLEN yelps]

195
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,458
[LENALEE, CHAOZII sigh]

196
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:57,625
[ALLEN grunts]

197
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:01,333
Oh, Allen... Lavi...

198
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:09,708
Whoa. Where am I?

199
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:14,083
[ROAD] All you have to do
to win is find your way

200
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:18,333
out of this room.
Pretty easy game, right?

201
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:20,083
Time to start!

202
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:23,250
That's it, huh?

203
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:26,500
It's definitely not the
room I was in before.

204
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:29,000
She said she could
teleport, right?

205
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:34,333
I guess she must've taken me
to a different place somehow.

206
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:38,625
This is crazy.
It doesn't even look real.

207
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:41,000
[ROAD giggles]

208
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,000
What the hell are
you laughing at?

209
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:44,875
[ROAD laughs]

210
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:48,166
Nothing much. I was just
thinking about how confused

211
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,208
you must be right now,
trying to figure out

212
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:53,291
whether I teleported you
to a different reality.

213
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:55,625
[LAVI] Well, that's
what you did, isn't it?

214
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:58,208
So, how much longer are
you planning on sitting

215
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:02,166
inside the floor like a
creepy little chess piece?

216
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,583
Aren't we gonna fight?

217
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:07,458
[ROAD] Nah. That
wouldn't be fun at all.

218
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:08,708
[LAVI sighs]

219
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,916
Look behind you.

220
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:15,958
That's the person I want
you to fight instead.

221
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,541
[LAVI grunts]

222
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:21,791
[LAVI gasps]

223
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:28,250
[LAVI]
Me?

224
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:32,208
That's a real cute trick,
but I'm still not buying it.

225
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:36,250
Fire Circle!
Devouring Flame!

226
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:38,458
[LAVI gasps]

227
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:41,583
[OTHER LAVI]
That won't work.

228
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:44,166
The only thing
here is your mind.

229
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,750
You don't have your
Innocence with you.

230
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,750
Which means that
you're powerless.

231
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,333
[LAVI gasps]

232
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:55,416
[ROAD]
Come on, Bookman.

233
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:59,333
[ROAD] Get real. If you
thought teleportation

234
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:01,708
was the only surprise
I had up my sleeve,

235
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:04,166
you've got another
thing coming.

236
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,916
[LAVI shudders]

237
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,625
[ROAD] The reason why I'm the
only Noah who can teleport

238
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,708
without using the Ark
is because I have

239
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:13,041
the unique ability to
connect reality with

240
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:16,833
my own little dream world.
Isn't that neat?

241
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:20,458
You and I are gonna have
so much fun together.

242
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:22,541
You might as well
get comfortable.

243
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:24,625
You're trapped in
Road Kamelot's dream

244
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:27,708
and I'm not letting
you out anytime soon!

245
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:29,250
[LAVI grunts]

246
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:32,875
[LENALEE] 
Lavi!

247
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,458
What did she do to you?

248
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:38,541
Lavi! Speak to me!
What's happening, Lavi?

249
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:41,833
Come on, answer me! Lavi!

250
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,958
[ROAD laughs]

251
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,833
[LERO]
That's pretty dark, Lero!

252
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:50,541
Of all the Noah
family's abilities,

253
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,458
yours freaks me out the most!

254
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:53,875
First things first.

255
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:56,166
What part of that big old
Bookman brain of yours

256
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:59,291
will be the most fun for me
to poke at till it bleeds?

257
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,541
I hope your blood is a
nice pretty red color,

258
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,666
just like a candy apple!

259
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:07,083
[ROAD laughs]

260
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:17,125
[TYKI] Careful, boy.
Don't fall.

261
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:24,083
[ALLEN yelps]

262
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,625
[ALLEN grunts]

263
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,708
[ALLEN groans]

264
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,416
[ALLEN gasps]

265
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:16,125
That's quite impressive.
It's like you're protected

266
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,625
by a full suit of armor.

267
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,416
You can call it a
clown if you prefer,

268
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,041
but from where I'm standing,
it looks more like a devil.

269
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,875
How fearsome.

270
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:31,250
This is getting
interesting.

271
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:35,875
I can't believe I get to destroy
your arm all over again.

272
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,791
[TYKI chuckles]

273
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:19,083
[ALLEN] Once again, I prepare
to battle Tyki Mikk.

274
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:21,750
Memories of our last fight
fill me with fear.

275
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:24,750
I do my best to hold my ground,
but in that moment,

276
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:28,291
an unexpected shock
passes through my left arm.

277
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:31,666
On the next D. Gray-man:
"Weak Humans."

278
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,833
Bring forth salvation
to this poor Akuma's soul!

279
00:22:34,916 --> 00:22:36,958
[LERO] This'll be on the test,
Lero! Make sure you take...

280
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:39,708
Uh... Can I please see that?

281
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:40,708
Sure thing.

282
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:43,166
[LERO]
Huh? No, wait!

283
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,041
Are you crazy? Don't borrow
pencils from people who bring

284
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:49,000
their Golems to school, Lero!
Now give it back!

285
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:50,916
[ROAD]
Huh?

286
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,625
[ALL]
You're a Golem, too, Lero!
