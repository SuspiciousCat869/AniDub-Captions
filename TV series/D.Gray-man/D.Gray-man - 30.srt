1
00:01:46,916 --> 00:01:48,250
Barba!

2
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:52,583
Allen! 

3
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:55,833
O... Okay... alright...

4
00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:58,166
Just tell me what's wrong...

5
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,041
Calm down, buddy!

6
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,750
 Allen, are you okay?

7
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:10,375
I'm fine...
At least... I think so.

8
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,500
Barba...

9
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:18,666
What happened that
got you so upset?

10
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,958
Lenny.

11
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:27,791
Poor Liza...

12
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:30,000
She loved Lenny so much.

13
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:33,000
When I think about it,
it makes me cry.

14
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:36,916
Oh no... Where is Liza?

15
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,083
They still haven't
cleared out this room yet?

16
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:41,833
Didn't I tell you to
get Lenny's stuff...

17
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:45,250
So you can clean up the mess
in this room, we need the bed.

18
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,875
You can't trust
anyone these days.

19
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:49,291
Hey what are you doing in there?

20
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:50,625
Me?

21
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:52,208
I thought that was you...

22
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:53,583
Don't you know
better than to wander

23
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:57,875
into another patient's
room without authorization?

24
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:58,958
I'm so sorry.

25
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:00,208
It's hard enough doing this job

26
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:02,333
without having to
baby-sit all the trainees.

27
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:03,000
Trainees?

28
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,291
But, but I...

29
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:05,666
You were instructed,
just like all the others,

30
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,625
to find me, the Head Nurse,
as soon as you arrived

31
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:12,416
How do you expect to work here
if you can't even do that?

32
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,333
Please, hold on a second, Miss.

33
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:15,375
I'm sorry, ma'am.

34
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,000
This hospital's
so big I got lost.

35
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:19,666
It won't happen
again. I promise.

36
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:25,875
Look, we need to get going.

37
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:28,916
We're shorthanded today and
need all the help we can get.

38
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:31,250
What'd she get into?

39
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:32,083
Well...

40
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,416
I'm not worried about it...

41
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,583
I'm sure Lenalee can
handle herself just fine...

42
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:43,666
Liza?

43
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,125
Liza, have you had a chance

44
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:48,125
to think about what
we discussed earlier?

45
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:49,916
I want you to be
back on your feet,

46
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,708
but in order to do that,
we need to act soon.

47
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,041
That's why I still
believe the method

48
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,916
I proposed is our best option.

49
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,375
What is he talking about?

50
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,708
Hello?

51
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:05,000
Oh, I apologize, hello...

52
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:06,625
Allen!

53
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:07,958
You know this boy?

54
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,500
Yes...

55
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,500
I met him through Mother, the
woman who's been helping me.

56
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:14,250
Mother...? Ahh...
right, I see now.

57
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,458
She's the old woman

58
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,083
you've been seeking
advice from lately...

59
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,750
Yes, that's her.

60
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,541
I'm currently...

61
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,458
Mother's acting apprentice.

62
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,291
And what are you doing here?

63
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:25,916
I heard Lenny passed away

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,125
so I came by to pay my respects.

65
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:29,916
His funeral will
be held tomorrow...

66
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,500
Now I'd prefer it if Liza
were left alone for awhile...

67
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,166
You do understand, don't you?

68
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,458
Yes... but...

69
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,125
Please son, just leave.

70
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:39,333
If you're worried about
Liza the best thing

71
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:41,583
you can do for her
is go home, okay?

72
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:43,125
No, no. It's alright.

73
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:44,875
Huh?

74
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,333
I don't mind it...

75
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:49,041
Will you stay...? Please, Allen?

76
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,958
Oh, of course.

77
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,041
Okay...

78
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,625
He can stay if
that's what you want.

79
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,250
Thank you Director...

80
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:56,916
I appreciate it.

81
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,583
Just promise me
you'll think about

82
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,250
what we discussed earlier.

83
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,666
It's important, Liza.

84
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,000
I'll need to know
your answer soon.

85
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,333
Sure.

86
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:07,750
So Liza...

87
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,166
What was that about?

88
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,458
He's trying to get me
to take some counseling.

89
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,083
Ahh... counseling?

90
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:15,416
He said losing Lenny
is a major trauma,

91
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:20,000
and to heal that hole in
my heart I'll need help.

92
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:28,208
You're still not finished?

93
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,041
You forgot these...

94
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,000
Get rid of them.

95
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:38,458
I grew those flowers myself!

96
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,291
I'm not going to
throw them away!

97
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:41,166
I don't care...

98
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,166
Just get them out of here, now.

99
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,041
I'm sorry... Barba.

100
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:00,583
Does Doctor Robert always
treat people that way?

101
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:03,625
No, but he's been in a
really bad mood lately.

102
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:04,500
Oh...

103
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:05,708
I think it has something to do

104
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:08,083
with some loan shark
he hasn't paid back yet.

105
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:11,500
Is that right?

106
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,208
I know, I know.

107
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:14,958
I will pay you back soon...

108
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,666
I just need some more time...

109
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,000
Whatever you do, do not come

110
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:20,875
to the hospital, you understand?

111
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,500
Oh wait...

112
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:35,291
I wonder if Allen and
Lenalee are coming back.

113
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:36,500
Hey Mother!

114
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:39,125
Are Allen and Lenalee
coming back tonight?

115
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:41,750
Do you think I should
make food for them too?

116
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:51,833
Well, you must be tired,
being your first day and all.

117
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,916
Yeah... Though you seem okay.

118
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,750
How long have you been here?

119
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,791
For the better part
of two years now...

120
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,666
Not too long after this hospital

121
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,916
was built I relocated
here from a village nearby.

122
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,375
So this hospital's
only two years old?

123
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:05,625
Yep...

124
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:06,583
You should have seen it
when it was first built.

125
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,041
It wasn't nearly this big.

126
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:09,166
Ever since the renovations

127
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,500
were completed six months ago,

128
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,916
our number of patients
has skyrocketed.

129
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,166
Six months...

130
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,000
I do know the number
of Akuma has gone up

131
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:20,000
significantly over
the past six months.

132
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:22,625
Seems most of our patients
are terminally ill...

133
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,708
The Director
treats them for free 

134
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,958
so we're pretty much
packed all the time.

135
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:29,583
I'd be surprised if this
place made any money.

136
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,291
Around the time
the hospital expanded,

137
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:36,000
they began taking
terminal patients,

138
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:38,916
which is the same time
Akuma started showing up.

139
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,500
Is the Director behind
this in some way?

140
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:43,875
If so, what would
be his motive...?

141
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:45,875
Or is Robert using
the Director's goodwill,

142
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,666
to funnel grieving relatives

143
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,625
to the Millennium Earl
in exchange for money?

144
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:53,708
No matter who's behind it,
someone in this hospital

145
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:57,708
is actually brokering
souls for the Earl.

146
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,958
At first he only had
slight pneumonia...

147
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:01,083
The doctors told us he would be

148
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:03,458
released in about
a week or so...

149
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:06,833
But no matter what they did,
he wouldn't get any better...

150
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:09,500
From that point on I started
believing it was my fault,

151
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:12,000
because I wasn't good
enough at caring for him.

152
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,458
But Lenny didn't actually
believe that, did he?

153
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:16,208
I'm sure he told you
it wasn't your fault.

154
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:17,833
Yeah...

155
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:21,458
He was always smiling,
trying to encourage me.

156
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,041
It wasn't long after
when he told me

157
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:26,791
he was starting to
have feelings for me...

158
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:29,416
Which was great, because
I was attracted to him,

159
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,750
especially his smile.

160
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:35,583
But then, just days after
we said "I love you"

161
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:36,791
to each other
for the first time,

162
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,625
the Director told
us the bad news.

163
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:43,708
He had diagnosed Lenny
with a terminal illness...

164
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,500
Of course Lenny
was upset about it,

165
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:49,750
but he accepted his fate and
took everything in stride...

166
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:52,291
He was so calm, when anyone else

167
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,666
in that position would have
been a wreck finding out

168
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,291
they only had weeks to live...

169
00:08:57,375 --> 00:09:02,000
Instead, Lenny was more
worried about me than himself.

170
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:06,208
I'm sorry...

171
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:09,666
but I can't stop crying.

172
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,083
Allen?

173
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:14,208
When you need to cry it's
better to just let it go.

174
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:15,708
When I lost someone
very dear to me

175
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:17,916
I cried my eyes out for days...

176
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,083
No wait...

177
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:20,708
It was actually a
lot longer than that...

178
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:22,375
It was more like a few weeks.

179
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:24,458
You lost someone?

180
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:25,625
Who?

181
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,125
Mana...

182
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,083
He was my foster father.

183
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,125
So how did you get on with
your life after losing him?

184
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:35,958
How did you get
over the empty feeling

185
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,375
in the pit of your heart?

186
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:40,500
Even now it's really tough
for me to talk about Mana,

187
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:43,125
but I still rely on him
for emotional support

188
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,625
even though he's gone.

189
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,166
I can get by each day because of

190
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:50,958
all the wonderful memories I
have of him when he was alive.

191
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,375
As long as I don't
forget about him...

192
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,416
Mana will continue
to live inside me

193
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,583
for the rest of my life.

194
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,125
You're right...

195
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:02,000
That's nice...
and it makes sense.

196
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:05,000
Lenny will live
inside me as long as...

197
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:07,250
I don't forget.

198
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,250
Yes... that's it...

199
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:12,083
You'll be okay...

200
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,500
Hey, was that...

201
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:22,250
Yes, I have another
one set up for you,

202
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,333
just as I promised.

203
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:40,791
What?

204
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:41,875
I don't understand.

205
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,500
I put the wrong day
on my calendar.

206
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,833
I was supposed
to start yesterday

207
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:46,208
but I wrote down today...

208
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,083
I'm so sorry.

209
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,750
Then who is that other girl?

210
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,500
Where did he get
the funds to renovate

211
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:58,875
the hospital when he isn't
charging patients for treatment?

212
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,791
If I can find out where
the money's coming from...

213
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:04,791
The Director
financed it himself?

214
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:07,375
Where in the world is he
getting that kind of money...?

215
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,083
That must mean the broker is...

216
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,083
You shouldn't be
sticking your nose

217
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:13,375
in other people's business.

218
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:14,958
I know you're not a nurse
like you say you are,

219
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,541
so who the hell are you...?

220
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,125
Get back here!

221
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:24,166
They already have you working
so soon after the funeral...?

222
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,750
I guess that must
be pretty tough...

223
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,666
Are you gonna be okay?

224
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,208
I'll be fine...

225
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,125
Besides I'd rather
have something to do

226
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,416
to help me get my
mind off of things.

227
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,666
Just don't push
yourself too hard.

228
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,708
Thanks for looking out
for me you guys, really...

229
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:50,250
Oh right, I almost
forgot about this.

230
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:53,208
Mother asked me to give
you this envelope, here.

231
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:54,541
That's for me?

232
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,500
Hold it!

233
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:58,750
If you don't stop,

234
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,583
I'm gonna have you
arrested for trespassing!

235
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,208
I don't have time
to deal with this guy,

236
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:04,791
not when Liza's in danger!

237
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:11,875
I thought I'd find you up here.

238
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:13,625
I've been looking for you, Liza.

239
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:15,916
Oh, hello Director.

240
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,875
You poor thing,
you must be a wreck.

241
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:20,500
Here, Liza...

242
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:23,500
Come with me and we'll sit
down and talk through this.

243
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,166
Trust me, it will
help you grieve.

244
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,208
I can't. I have work to do.

245
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:28,208
Forget about work...

246
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:29,708
You need help.

247
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,041
Damn it, she's fast.

248
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,666
I can't even
keep up with her!

249
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:40,458
Move it!

250
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,666
How could you do that?!

251
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,333
Lenalee?

252
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,291
What the hell is that thing?

253
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:02,500
It's an Akuma,
we're not safe here...

254
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,166
Akuma?

255
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,333
Allen!

256
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,083
No... no... no!

257
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:22,416
This entire hospital is like
some Akuma manufacturing plant.

258
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:25,916
There's someone
working in this hospital

259
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,375
that sold his soul to
the Millennium Earl...

260
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:31,083
And these poor people
have become his victims.

261
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,583
Now let's save their souls
from any more torment!

262
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,416
You and Lenny shared a bond

263
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,458
that could only
be broken by death.

264
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:47,250
Wouldn't you like to be
with him once again?

265
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:51,416
If you act now I can make
that happen for you...

266
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,916
You're one of the lucky ones...

267
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,333
Think about it, you can
hear his voice once again,

268
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:57,666
and see that smile
you loved so much.

269
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,208
Lenny wants to see you again.

270
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:02,375
He is dying to, and
you can make it happen.

271
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:05,083
He wants to... to see me?

272
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,458
He does...

273
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,916
He wants you more than
anything else in the world.

274
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,208
It was his dying wish,

275
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,041
and you can make
it come true for him

276
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,541
if you just give
me your permission.

277
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:22,250
Allen, the hospital's
Director is the broker.

278
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,208
Broker?

279
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:26,666
He's been using dying
patients as bait for the Earl,

280
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,541
so they can be Akuma...

281
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:31,208
The Director's building
an army for the Earl...

282
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:34,041
He's even making
money off of it...

283
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,500
Since I found out
he had money problems

284
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,333
I've been suspicious
of Robert...

285
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:41,833
But he was shocked at
the sight of an Akuma.

286
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:44,375
Leaving the Director
as our best suspect.

287
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:45,791
Let's hurry...

288
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:48,916
We have to stop him before
he creates any more Akuma.

289
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,208
The door's locked.

290
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:56,958
Your things are
already prepared.

291
00:14:57,041 --> 00:15:00,291
All I need to do is set up
an appointment for you,

292
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:01,791
and then once that is made,

293
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,916
the only thing you will have
to do is call his soul back.

294
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,041
It will be very easy.

295
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,500
Call his soul back?

296
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:10,708
I was afraid this
was going to happen!

297
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:12,125
I'll handle all the details,

298
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:14,000
but all you'll need
to do is say his name

299
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:16,083
and he will literally
come back to life.

300
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,916
Well...? Aren't
you excited Liza?

301
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,791
I am... I want to
see him so badly.

302
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,875
Oh... So you've decided!

303
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,583
Fantastic...! You've
made the right decision...

304
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:29,833
Good girl...

305
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:31,166
I'll go make the call.

306
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:36,625
I want to see him... but I...

307
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:40,083
I don't need him to
come back to life.

308
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,458
'Scuse me?

309
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:46,208
It's because... he already
lives in my heart.

310
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:49,250
That nonsense isn't
going to help anyone.

311
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,250
Liza open up!

312
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,458
Liza!

313
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,000
I'm sick of this hymning
and hawing from you.

314
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:58,416
Forget about your consent.

315
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,041
We're going through this
whether you want to or not.

316
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,375
What are you doing?

317
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:04,750
You have no idea who
you're dealing with.

318
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:07,458
This is not the kind of
person you make wait.

319
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:09,375
You forced my hand, Liza.

320
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,333
Sarah was an easy one,

321
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:18,708
while you two took
more time and effort.

322
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:21,666
The poison I was feeding
Lenny worked perfectly,

323
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,125
prolonging his illness
long enough to get you both

324
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:27,041
to fall in love just
like I had planned.

325
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:28,500
I've worked too long on this,

326
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:30,333
to let you walk away.

327
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,125
Who's there?!

328
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,833
Identify yourself!

329
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,000
I am an Exorcist...

330
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:46,666
I destroy Akuma... and
save souls from torment...

331
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,958
The Millennium Earl
is our enemy.

332
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,333
You're trying to
stop the Earl...

333
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:52,833
Right...

334
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:55,541
I thought you'd like to know
we destroyed all your Akuma.

335
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,250
Let me guess...

336
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,458
You're an Exorcist too?

337
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:01,333
You're a soul broker,
aren't you...?

338
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:02,666
You've been collaborating
with the Earl

339
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,916
by using your patients
as bait for his army...

340
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,708
and turning a nice
profit while you're at it.

341
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,708
What drives a man
to do such a thing...?

342
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:15,166
Especially since
you're... human.

343
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,125
Stay where you are.

344
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:18,791
You want to know why I did it.

345
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,500
I did it for the
people living here...

346
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:21,958
The people of this town...

347
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,666
What do you mean?

348
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,416
The only chance a
rat hole in the middle

349
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,875
of nowhere has for developing
is by opening a hospital

350
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:31,375
and filling it with patients,
otherwise it will die.

351
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,791
All I ever did,
I did for this town.

352
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,375
That's enough!

353
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:41,916
Mother!

354
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,375
What are you doing here?

355
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,333
I was worried about you two

356
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,333
so I called Mother
here to save the day...

357
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:56,791
She's so tough anytime she's

358
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,666
in the room there's
no need to worry.

359
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,791
Is that right?

360
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,000
You know she does
seem to have gotten

361
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:04,000
much stronger over
the last three years.

362
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,791
I can't believe she
knocked him out in one shot.

363
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:09,000
Oh, I'm not finished...

364
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:12,666
I'll make certain he atones for
his sins against humanity...

365
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,625
It will be up to us to show him

366
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,125
what a terrible mistake he made,

367
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:18,125
by putting all those
souls in danger.

368
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:21,000
You two should never forget
what you saw here today.

369
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:23,583
The Earl doesn't just
turn humans into Akuma...

370
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,083
He manipulates their desires

371
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:28,125
and uses their minds to
turn them into collaborators,

372
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:31,500
forcing them to do his bidding
through blackmail or slavery.

373
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,166
Right.

374
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,583
It will be a tough fight,

375
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:37,166
but don't forget that not
all humans are weak enough

376
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,833
to fall under his spell,
like Liza here.

377
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:42,125
Through it all, she never
lost her strength or will,

378
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:44,833
even when the odds
were stacked against her.

379
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:52,583
Hello hello...?
Well no kidding, huh...

380
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,958
I'll be over right away...

381
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,750
It's no big deal to
lose a collaborator

382
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,250
or two now and then...

383
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,541
Luckily for me there are
countless other people

384
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:05,208
who are willing to give their
effort towards the cause.

385
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:15,708
I'm not as strong as
I've been made out to be...

386
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:18,625
There are many times
I thought I would crack,

387
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:19,916
but this letter
that Mother gave me

388
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,958
really helped me through it.

389
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,291
"There is no sense
in you being sad just

390
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,166
because I'm no longer there,

391
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,125
for I will always
be by your side.

392
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:31,875
Any time you want to see me,

393
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:35,000
just think back on all
the wonderful memories.

394
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:38,125
Don't be sad, my dear Liza.

395
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:40,875
Live your life to the
fullest and never look back...

396
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:44,666
For as long as I can, I will
pray for your happiness."

397
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:52,416
Liza has a full
life ahead of her.

398
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,541
It'll be nice having
Lenny at her side.

399
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:58,458
Yes... For sure.

400
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:01,083
There's another
letter I forgot about.

401
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,041
Huh...?

402
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,166
But Liza just left.

403
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,125
You better grab her
before she's gone.

404
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:05,958
Not her...

405
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,708
It's addressed to Lenalee...

406
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:10,333
It arrived at Mother's
house just a few hours ago.

407
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:12,541
I'm not expecting anything.

408
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:17,458
It's from my brother.

409
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:20,375
Come back to Headquarters
double, triple, quadruple quick!

410
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:22,708
I really really need
you here, Lenalee!

411
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:24,333
It's urgent!

412
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,083
Come...! Come back...!

413
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,583
Hurry up and come
back protisimo...

414
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,125
Something fishy's going on.

415
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:33,208
That's strange...

416
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:35,291
He didn't even
mention my name once.

417
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:36,583
What now...?

418
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:38,166
Do you wanna head back
with me to Headquarters?

419
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,875
But I still haven't been
able to find Master Cross...

420
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,583
These are for you.

421
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:45,625
Wow... I guess I've
become pretty popular, huh?

422
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,083
What...?

423
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,958
They're just a bunch of
overdue bills address to Master!

424
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,333
Those letters can help
you find Master Cross...

425
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:55,166
Just trace back
the return addresses

426
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,041
and you'll find where he's been.

427
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,958
What do you say we
give it a shot, Timcanpy?

428
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:39,916
Miranda was making her way

429
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,500
to the Black Order
to become an Exorcist,

430
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:43,875
when she accidentally
got lost...!

431
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:46,041
Now she's faced with
two different paths...

432
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:49,500
Which one does she choose,
and then what happens?

433
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:52,125
On the next D. Gray-man:
"Lost Miranda."

434
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:56,333
Bring forth salvation to
this tormented Akuma's soul.
