1
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,875
[ALLEN] That guy's one of
the Noah Clan, isn't he?

2
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:50,666
Yeah, clearly.

3
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,875
I saw him several times
before my unit came to Edo.

4
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:55,750
He's been hunting us down.

5
00:01:55,833 --> 00:02:00,541
Well. Specifically, he's going
after the General of my unit.

6
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,041
So, you finally made it.

10
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:16,500
Don't forgive. Don't
forgive. Don't forgive.

11
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:18,416
Don't forgive.

12
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,750
I'll never forgive Exorcists!

building up this anger

15

for the last 7,000 years, and
somebody's about to pay for it!

[KANDA]
It's all right.

00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:02,041

That's Noah's Ark up there,

00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:44,416
I couldn't be more certain.

29
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,916
If the six of them really
have been swallowed up

30
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,708
and taken captive by
that terrible vessel,

31
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:54,166
I'm not so sure there's a way
for them to escape from it.

32
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:30,875
Welcome back!

00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:33,750
Oh, damn, of course
it's only you.

Yep, just me.

Sorry to disappoint you, Road.

where he could be.

[TYKI]
As if you don't know.

38
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:46,041
He's probably down there with
Skinn, if I had to guess.

39
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:48,875
[ROAD]
Hm. I hope he shows up soon.

40
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:50,458
[TYKI]
Don't too get excited.

41
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,583
I'm sure Skinn'll
make quick work of him.

42
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:55,416
You've sure got it bad for
the little brat, don't you?

43
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,916
Look, Tyki.

44
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You're the last person who gets
to be all judge-y with me.

45
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:05,250
So, what do you think we should
do when he gets up here?

46
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:08,708
I don't know. [chuckles]

47
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:15,791
[ALLEN] Earthquake!

48
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:18,250
[LAVI] Nah, there's no way
this is an earthquake.

49
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,916
We're inside Noah's Ark
right now, remember?

50
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,166
[LERO]
Right, Lero!

51
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,166
Don't let the shaky ground
deceive you, Lero!

52
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,000
That's just because this
room hasn't completed

53
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:27,958
its download to the new Ark yet!

54
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:32,791
But as soon as it does, it'll
disappear into thin air, Lero!

55
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,750
How long until this
room disappears?!

56
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:35,791
Tell me now!

57
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,250
Beats me, Lero!

58
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,833
From what I understand, the
downloading process begins

59
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:42,291
with the areas around the
outer perimeter of the Ark,

60
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,416
but after that, the order
the rooms download

61
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,916
and disappear in will be
random and unpredictable!

62
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,458
Sorry to break it to you,

63
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:50,833
but I have no way of knowing
when this room downloads, Lero!

64
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,083
For real?

65
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:55,250
[LERO panting]
And you've got 110 minutes

66
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,916
to get off the Ark, Lero.

67
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,333
That's all we've got left?

68
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:00,750
Yup, Lero! By that
time, the entire Ark

69
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:04,166
will be finished downloading and
it'll cease to exist forever!

70
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,458
No matter where you are in
the Ark at that moment,

71
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,583
that'll be curtains
for you, Lero!

Why would you do that?

I'm sure Kanda and I will
be fine in this room.

78
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,666
The rest of you should
find the door

00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,666
that leads to the next
exit and move forward.

It seems like you're quite
worried about this.

I mean, Yu's got a pretty
rotten personality,

one of our own, can we?

even having this discussion?!

You know there's only one
obvious right answer to this,

88
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,833
Allen! We should all stay
and fight as a team,

89
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:47,666
and then we move forward!

get trapped in here,

00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:07,666
And if you find the door
and open it with that key,

163
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:12,458
then it'll become an exit that
leads into the next room, Lero!

164
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,125
So once we do that,

165
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,625
will this room and that one
stay connected by the door?

166
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:22,166
[LERO]
Sure, Lero!

167
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,833
After a connection is made,
it'll stay there forever, Lero!

168
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:27,083
So, I guess that means
Kanda can walk through

169
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:28,958
after he beats that guy!

170
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,375
[LERO] Well yeah, but
so can the Noah, Lero!

171
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:31,833
[gasps]

172
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,166
Uh.

173
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,291
But oh well, I guess that's
better than the room

174
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:38,500
collapsing and both of
them being stuck, right?

175
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,333
[CHAOZII]
Hey, Exorcists!

176
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:48,041
Looks like there's some
kind of building up ahead!

177
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,750
[KRORY]
This must be it.

178
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:54,541
Allen.

179
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,250
[ALLEN]
Mm-hm.

180
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,833
All right, let's go in.

181
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm ready.

182
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,291
[ALL gasp]

183
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,708
Whoa, what's happening?

184
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,875
[LAVI]
It's beginning.

185
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:25,541
[SKINN yelling]

186
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:36,291
[KANDA]
Mugen... Activate.

187
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:40,750
[SKINN roars]

188
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,791
Now, Nigen.

189
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:45,083
Activate!

190
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,208
Nigen Swords!

191
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,791
Come. Time is short.

192
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:02,208
[LERO]
Lero, Lero, Lero.

193
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:03,291
Yu...

194
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:06,125
We have to press on.

195
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,000
Kanda.

196
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:13,625
You better find us.

197
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:18,125
If you break your word,
I'll have to kick your ass.

198
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,083
[SKINN]
Thunderbolt.

199
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,500
Thunderbolt. Thunderbolt.

200
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,000
Thunderbolt.

201
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:38,375
Thunder, thunder, thunder,
thunder, thunder, thunderbolt!

202
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,208
[SKINN]
Die!

203
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:55,208
[SKINN chuckles]

204
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:05,500
[KANDA]
Nigen Swords!

205
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,250
Mantis Slicer!

206
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,125
[SKINN gasping]

207
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,333
[KANDA]
Nigen Swords!

208
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:18,250
Mantis Slicer!

209
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,375
[SKINN grunts]

210
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:26,208
[SKINN yelling]

211
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,375
[SKINN roars]

212
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:44,875
[SKINN]
You're not half bad, are ya?

213
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,000
[SKINN chuckles]

214
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:07,916
[ROAD]
Would ya look at that?

215
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,750
[TYKI]
Huh?

216
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,333
Huh?

217
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:14,458
[ROAD] Skinn finally got one of
the Exorcists to fight with him.

218
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:19,125
I can't tell which one it is
from all the way up here though.

219
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:22,708
Oh, so they're still in
that room, are they?

220
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:26,500
[ROAD] No, it looks like only
one of them's left in there now.

221
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:30,125
The rest of them must've gone
ahead through the next door.

222
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:31,375
What?

223
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:33,958
But why would Skinn have
allowed that to happen?

224
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,500
[ROAD]
You know Skinn.

225
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:39,583
He can only see whatever's
right in front of his dumb face.

226
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,291
[TYKI]
Huh?

227
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:44,583
[chuckles] He's such an idiot.

228
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:47,791
Well, I guess we're being
just as foolish though.

229
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:48,875
[ROAD]
Yup.

230
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,041
I mean, there's no reason

231
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:54,458
we have to bother
fighting them at all.

232
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:56,333
We could just as easily
leave them alone

233
00:14:56,416 --> 00:15:00,083
and let the Ark disappear
with them on it.

234
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,791
This is so strange.

235
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,041
You'd think the Earl would have
something to say about us

236
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,916
acting on our own like this.

237
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,250
[ROAD]
Yeah.

238
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:10,541
Perhaps his silence means
he isn't angry with us.

239
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,875
[ROAD]
He'd never get angry with us.

240
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:15,541
He just prefers not to put
his precious little lambs

241
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:18,916
in harm's way if he
doesn't have to.

242
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Our whole purpose is to be
dedicated to God, remember?

243
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:27,291
Besides, he knows
how Noahs operate.

244
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:33,041
We can't resist danger, so I'm
sure he expected this anyway.

245
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,958
[ROAD]
That's our nature.

246
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:45,208
But you, Tyki...

247
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,041
[KRORY]
What is this place?

248
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:52,958
[CHAOZII]
I have no idea.

249
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:54,875
[LAVI]
What's with the dark hallway?

250
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,208
Looks like it goes on forever.

251
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,333
Would you mind directing
us to the exit?

252
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:02,250
That's cheating, Lero!
You have to find it, Lero!

253
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:04,833
Damn, you're useless!

254
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,625
You must be worried
about Kanda, huh?

255
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:12,625
Right, Allen?

256
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,708
What? Why would I be worried?

257
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,750
I mean, what about you?

258
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,916
[LENALEE]
Mm-hm. Of course, I am.

259
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,333
[gasps]

260
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:23,000
[LENALEE] But Kanda and I
made a promise back there.

261
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,625
He says he'll find us
as soon as he can.

262
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:28,708
So I have to believe that he'll
keep his word and show up.

263
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:31,458
[gasps]

264
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:33,958
Yeah, you're right.
We should go.

265
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:35,833
Right.

266
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,875
See you soon.

267
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,375
[KANDA yells]

268
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:43,750
[SKINN yelling]

269
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:46,250
Mantis Slicer!

270
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:57,708
[SKINN yelling]

271
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,750
[SKINN chuckles]

272
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:17,541
Oh, so you can fight. I see.

273
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:18,666
[SKINN]
Huh?

274
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,708
Nothing, it's just
I always assumed

275
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,958
that you didn't know how.

276
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:26,625
All you did before was
watch us from afar.

277
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,958
[KANDA]
Hmph.

278
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,166
Uh?

279
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,958
[KANDA] I noticed you there
on multiple occasions

280
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,875
when my unit was
confronted by Akuma.

281
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:52,958
But for some reason, you
always kept your distance.

282
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,791
I figured you were
either too weak

283
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,916
or too scared to face us.

284
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
[SKINN]
Oh. Well.

285
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,541
I had good reason.

286
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:03,500
There were three of you,
weren't there?

287
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:04,583
Yes.

288
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,500
What does that matter?

289
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:11,125
[SKINN] Heh. The first one,
the second, or the third.

290
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:13,041
I knew I wanted to
kill all of you,

291
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,458
but I couldn't decide
on the best order!

292
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:17,166
[KANDA]
Hm?

293
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,083
[SKINN] I would just stand
there and watch you

294
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,125
and try to figure out
who to pick off first

295
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:22,500
and who to save for last!

296
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:25,916
[SKINN laughing]

297
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,708
[KANDA]
Okay...

298
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:30,750
[KANDA] He's not weak,
he's just an idiot.

299
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,125
Well?

300
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,416
Have you finally made up
your mind about the order?

301
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,708
Absolutely!

302
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:37,541
[laughing]

303
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:38,583
You first!

304
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,583
It was always a
toss-up before,

305
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:42,625
but since I've got you
right where I want you,

306
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:44,791
I guess you'll have
to be number one!

307
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,625
Ah. You let fate choose.

308
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:51,166
[SKINN] The question now, is
who should I slaughter next?

309
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:54,583
There were some good choices
in that group that just left.

310
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:57,250
Hey! Why don't you help me pick?

311
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,875
You're kidding.

312
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,666
[SKINN]
After I destroy you,

313
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:04,583
I'll be ready for another
one-on-one battle.

314
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,541
[SKINN] I'll march straight
through that door,

315
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:12,333
single out another one of your
little Exorcist buddies,

316
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:14,708
and challenge him to
a fight to the death.

317
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:16,250
And when I'm through,

318
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:20,041
I'll pick another target and rip
that one limb from limb too!

319
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:26,916
[SKINN laughing]

320
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:32,958
[SKINN]
And as soon as I've had my fun

321
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:36,958
eliminating every Exorcist
on Noah's Ark, one by one

322
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:40,083
then I'll go after Tiedoll!

323
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:49,291
Sorry, but there's one
critical flaw in your plan.

324
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,041
[SKINN]
Huh?

325
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:54,041
[KANDA] You won't get
to fight anyone else.

326
00:19:57,625 --> 00:20:00,458
Because I'll
eviscerate you first.

327
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:03,500
[SKINN laughing]

328
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,833
Just what I'd expect you to say!

329
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:09,333
You Exorcists always find a way
to piss me off even more!

330
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,791
You made a grave mistake

331
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:13,583
when you crossed Skinn
Bolic of the Noah Clan!

332
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:15,083
Who are you, anyway?

333
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:20,166
I know you're from Tiedoll's
Unit, but what's your name?

334
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,333
Kanda.

335
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:26,750
Is that so? [laughing]

336
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:34,000
Watch this. It's the power
of a Noah's anger!

337
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,458
[SKINN]
Kanda.

338
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:49,750
[KANDA]
What?

339
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,375
[SKINN]
I like sweets.

340
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,875
Do you enjoy them too?

341
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,541
Actually, I hate them.

342
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:32,500
[ALLEN] The immortal Skinn
Bolic continues to get back up

343
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:35,583
no matter how many times
Kanda strikes him down.

344
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:37,541
Kanda increases Mugen's power,

345
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:41,333
despite the fact that it
will cost him his own life.

346
00:22:41,416 --> 00:22:43,125
Next time on <i>D.Gray Man</i> :

347
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:45,958
"Forbidden Skill,
Sangen Style."

348
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:49,541
Bring forth salvation to
this poor Akuma's soul!

349
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:53,833
Sorry, we're closed
for renovations!

350
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:54,875
[ALLEN]
Huh?

351
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:57,458
Hey!
