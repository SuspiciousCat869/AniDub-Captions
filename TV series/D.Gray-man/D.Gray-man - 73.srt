00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,916
Uh. What the...?

2
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,666
[KOMUI]
Is something the matter?

3
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,250
[ALLEN exhales]
Well...

4
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:50,125
I didn't know what to expect,
but this definitely wasn't it.

5
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:51,708
[KOMUI]
Describe what you see.

6
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:53,291
[ALLEN]
I'm in a town.

7
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:56,875
The buildings are white.
Looks sort of Mediterranean

8
00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:58,708
Uh... Chief Komui?

9
00:01:58,791 --> 00:01:59,791
[KOMUI]
Yes?

10
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:02,000
[ALLEN]
Do you think everyone's okay?

11
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:05,000
[KOMUI]
Whenever you're feeling uneasy,

12
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,833
just think happy thoughts.

13
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:08,333
[ALLEN]
Hm? Happy thoughts?

14
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:09,583
[KOMUI]
Nothing comes to mind?

15
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:12,458
All right then. How about this?

16
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:14,583
When everyone comes back,
first thing I'll do

17
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:18,041
is slap them on the back
and welcome them home.

18
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:20,458
[KOMUI]
And then,

19
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:22,833
I'm going to give Lenalee
a great big hug.

20
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:24,791
After that, I'll make sure
there's a banquet of food

21
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:27,500
for you to eat. Lavi will
probably just fall asleep

22
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:30,708
on the spot, so I'll
throw a blanket over him.

23
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:33,666
For the adults, I'd like
us to toast with wine.

24
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,041
We'll have a large celebration

25
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:38,250
and fall into a
pleasant slumber.

26
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:42,625
Don't waste this moment, Lavi!

27
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:46,125
Take him out, cho!

28
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:50,708
I enjoyed our time
together, Lavi.

29
00:02:57,583 --> 00:03:01,375
[KOMUI]
And then, once the party's over,

30
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:04,916
Kanda will show up,
grouchy as ever.

31
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,666
Couple of large
Akuma over there.

32
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:23,666
Marie. Only you can
hear from this far out.

33
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,916
What's happening?

34
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,916
[MARIE] I'm mostly just
picking up Akuma noises,

35
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,750
but I can also faintly make out
the voices of Lenalee, Lavi,

36
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:40,125
and some other members
of the Cross Unit.

37
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:43,875
I see. Then go and help them.

38
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:48,041

Mm-hm.

You sure it was such a good idea

41
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:55,166
to send your bodyguards away?

42
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,958
You can dispense
with the theatrics.

43
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:00,083
I don't buy a single
bit of this.

44
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:01,791
I know that you were all hoping

45
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:04,333
this would happen from
the very beginning.

46

Weren't you, modified Akuma?

47

Ha, ha!

48
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,875
And I would rather not end
up with an unpaid debt

49
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,750
to Marian, so...

That's right! Ha, ha!

00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:18,166
You guys sure stress me out.
So, let's wrap this up.

when they get the urge to kill
is a little flashy for me.
