00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:40,458
Right! Let's get going!

00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:47,083
Chaozii! Move!

3
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:53,791
What happened?

4
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:54,916
Say something, Allen!

5
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,791

[ALLEN gasps]

7
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:11,458
Who are you? Tyki?

8
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:15,500
But that's impossible.
I destroyed your Noah.

9
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:31,791
[ALLEN yells]

10
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:36,125
[ALLEN]
Where'd he go?

11
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:49,416
[ALLEN groans]

12
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,708
[ALLEN] Not only is he
powerful, he's fast too!

13
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:10,916
I can't even counterattack!
Is this thing really a human?

14
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,333
[TYKI yells]

15
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,208
[ALLEN]
No!

16
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:24,750
[ALLEN]
Tyki Mikk...

17
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:28,208
Who are you?
What did you become?

18
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,041

[TYKI growls]

20
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:47,458
Is that Tyki Mikk? And what's
with his outfit? Is this a joke?

21
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:48,458
Lavi...

22
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:50,208
Just hang in there, Allen.

23
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:53,250
Hold on to me and
we'll get out of here.

24
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:58,333
We can't escape. The door...
It doesn't exist anymore.

25
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,125
[LAVI]
No way.

26
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,583
It was destroyed?

27
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,083
Then, there's no way
for us to leave the Ark.

28

[LENALEE] Allen!
Are you all right?

36
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:57,208
[LAVI] Dammit!
What do we do now?

37
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:58,791
Say something!

38
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:01,208
[LAVI] Both Allen and I
are complete wrecks.

39
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:05,500
We can't fight. And there's
no way out! But...

40
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:13,208
There's no choice but
to get to higher ground!

[LAVI] Devouring Flame.
Direct Fire Stamp!

[LAVI groans]

50
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:48,666
[LAVI] No, it can't be.
Not like this.

51
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,708
Lavi! No!
There's no way...

52
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,750
Is this the same Tyki
from earlier?

53
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:57,875
The Noah? But I thought
Allen already defeated him!

[ALLEN yells, grunts]

61
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:38,125
[LAVI] He's too strong.
There's no way we can stop him!

62
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,333
You can't give up!

[CHAOZII]
We're so close!

64
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,916
I'm sorry. We're never
getting out of this place.

65
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,500
The door was destroyed.

[LENALEE gasps]

67
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,333
I saw it. His first attack
shattered it. We're stuck.

68
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:52,625
[CHAOZII]
That can't be!

72
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:03,291
But we're doomed!
Why are you still fighting?

73
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:06,333
Simple.
We're Exorcists, Chaozii.

No. You're only going
to injure yourself more!

78
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,375
I have to fight
with Lavi and Allen!

79
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:25,083
But we're defeated,
so what does it even matter?

80
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:28,041
Because I'm an Exorcist too,
and we never give up!

Am I going to die?

00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:35,958
Without saving anyone?

00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:42,875
[CHAOZII]
Get up, dammit. Get up!

90
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:52,583
 I'm so useless!
I'm sorry, Anita... Mahoja...

91
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:56,375
I'm too weak.
I can't do anything.

92
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:59,333
Why am I not strong
enough to help?

93
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:07,583
Forgive me, Anita.
I can't save them! Forgive me!

[MAHOJA] Master. The work
is finished as you asked.

96
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,125
What are your orders?

97
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,458
[ANITA]
Stop the ship!

98
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:46,125
Go summon the Exorcists and
Akuma to join us on the deck!

99
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:52,666
So that's it.
Kie and Maosa.

100
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,750
Out of the crew, you're the
only ones who survived.

[KIE, MAOSA grunt]

103
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,625
[MAHOJA] What is it?
Speak up, you two.

104
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:02,625
[KIE]
It's just that...

105
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,125
[MAOSA]
There's another...

106
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,833
[ANITA]
Mm?

107
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:08,666
[MAOSA] But he's
being kinda stubborn.

108
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,291
Dead! I'm as dead as
the rest of you, ya got it?

109
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:17,291
No, you're not.

110
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:18,916
Definitely a lie.

111
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,291
I know for a fact you
didn't get shot, Chaozii.

112
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:22,875
You're wrong! I did!

113
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,000
Accept the truth.

114
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,833
It's time someone
told you, Chaozii.

115
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,291
You're not a very good liar.

116
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:29,291
Everyone here
knows you survived.

117
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,875
I am telling you the truth!
I got hit, all right?

118
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:33,500
[CREW MEMBER]
Then look her in the eyes

119
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:35,291
and repeat what you said.

120
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:37,291
[CHAOZII gasps]

121
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,458
Crewman Chaozii Han.

122
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:41,750
I'm sorry, Captain Anita.

123
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,583
Please let me go
down with the ship!

124
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,875
Beside you and
the rest of the crew!

125
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:50,041
I forbid it.

126
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:53,750
We mean so much to you,
but you're okay lying to us?

127
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,958
[CHAOZII]
This place... Edo...

128
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:58,458
It's full of Akuma.
Isn't that right?

129
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:02,791
If I go, a normal human like me
is sure to wind up dead anyway.

130
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:05,708
Even if by some slim
chance I did survive,

131
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,375
I'd be lost without Anita
and the rest of you.

132
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:11,583
I don't have a reason to live
or anywhere to go back to!

133
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,875
My home...
It's with you guys!

134
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:16,166
When my mother was
killed by an Akuma,

135
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,666
it was you and your
mother who delivered me!

136
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,583
The only reason I'm alive
and aboard this ship right now

137
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,500
is because of you two!

138
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:24,666
I chose to support the Order
and devote the remainder

139
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,833
of my life in your service
to repay the debt I owe you!

140
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:30,041
And if fate has decided you
should sink into the ocean,

141
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:32,750
then that will be
my fate as well!

142
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,875
I beg you to grant me
this one request!

143
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,958
Please let me stay with you!

144
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:44,916
[CHAOZII sobs]

145
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,833
[ANITA] It requires
greater courage to live.

146
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:51,083
Believe me, I understand
exactly how you feel.

147
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:56,000
But you know, Chaozii, nothing
ever really disappears forever.

148
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:59,041
Even if our bodies are
swallowed by the sea,

149
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:02,041
our life force will join
you and the Exorcists.

150
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:06,041
We'll be right beside you
to help carry on the fight.

151
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:09,833
And together, we can
continue to save more lives.

152
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:13,750
You see, whatever battles
the future holds, even though

153
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:18,291
you won't see us standing
next to you, we will be there.

154
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:21,083
Reaching out to you
from the ether.

155
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:25,791
You must go on.
Live though this for me.

156
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:28,500
Though we won't see
each other anymore,

157
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:31,000
we'll always be friends.

158
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,500
[CHAOZII weeps]

159
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:38,500
[ANITA]
I have only one thing to ask.

160
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:42,833
Use your life to protect
those young Exorcists.

161
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:45,791
As long as you do that,
I promise you...

162
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:48,250
We will never leave your side.

[LENALEE gasps]

164
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:54,083
[CHAOZII]
I failed you, Anita. Everyone.

165
00:12:54,166 --> 00:13:01,541
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I can't do anything!

[LENALEE yells]

173
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:40,500
I got you, Lenalee!

174
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:48,958
[CHAOZII] Can you hear me,
Anita? Mahoja? My comrades!

175
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:52,708
[CHAOZII gasps]

176
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:57,875
This is for you!
Help me save her!

[CHAOZII grunts]

00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,000
Oh, Chaozii...

[LENALEE gasps]

182
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:49,916
[LENALEE] It can't be!
That's Innocence!

183
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,208
And it appears to be
reacting to Chaozii!

184
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:56,666
But what's its source?
Where is it coming from?

185
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:11,875
Go. You know I won't
try to stop you.

186
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:20,125
[CHAOZII grunts]

187
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:25,416
I know you're with me, Anita
and Mahoja! For my friends!

188
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,125
It's amazing.

189
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:31,250
[CHAOZII grunts]

190
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:43,375
Who are you?

191
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,041
Report!

192
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:49,875
So reinforcements
are being sent.

193
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:52,833
I don't recall hearing
about additional guards.

194
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:55,083
Wait while I confirm this.

195
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,708
[CHAOZII grunts]

196
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:12,916
Hold on!

[LENALEE grunts]

198
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,791
[LENALEE] What's this
binding wrapped around me?

199
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,750
I can't break free!

200
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,958
[CHAOZII yells]

201
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:24,958
What's happening?
How am I doing this, Lenalee?

202
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:26,500
There must be Innocence nearby

203
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:28,791
you're somehow
synchronizing with.

204
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,916
You can't keep this up.

205
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,291
It's the same as Miranda.

206
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:35,000
His body's carrying
an incredible burden.

207
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:38,583
It may be an
Equipment Type Innocence.

208
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:41,916
The Innocence you're reacting to
is in a raw crystallized form!

209
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,458
It hasn't been weaponized yet!

210
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:47,291
An accommodator can't
wield that kind of power!

211
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:49,000
If you keep this up,
you'll be injured!

212
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:53,750
Too bad! I mean,
what else can I do?

213
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:56,375
If this how it ends,
then so be it!

214
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:57,875

[CHAOZII yells]

217
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,583
Chaozii, no...

218
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:09,000
Miss Anita!
Mahoja! My shipmates!

[CHAOZII grunts]

221
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:16,958
[LENALEE] You're pushing
yourself too hard!

222
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:18,833
[CHAOZII] I can't
overdo it at this point!

223
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:22,125
I either hold up the
wreckage or I let it fall!

224
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:28,125
I don't mind the pain. I finally
got the chance to save you!

225
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:33,708
Hurry up! Before I let go,
you need to run! Right now!

226
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:37,208
Where would I run?
The door leading out is gone.

[CHAOZII grunts]

228
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:43,250
But still... I won't give up.

229
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,500
I refuse!
I'll never give up!

230
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:48,375
And neither will I!

It's Allen!

And Lavi!

Lenalee sounded
kinda surprised

248
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,416
both of us are
still in this fight.

249
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,875
I have to admit, I'm a
little surprised myself.

250
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,875
I didn't think I had
any energy left.

251
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:45,583
That makes two of us.
With the door gone and no way

252
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,541
to get out, it'd be easy to
lie down and just give up.

253
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:49,750
[ALLEN] Then again,
when have you and I

254
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,625
ever thrown in the towel?

255
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:54,750
That's true. If Chaozii and
Lenalee won't back down...

256
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,333
Then we can't lose hope either.

Lavi!

263
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,625
He got both of them!

264
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:14,916
He's behind you!

265
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,708
What?

266
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,375
[TYKI growls]

267
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:21,750
[ALLEN]
Clown Belt activate!

268
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:22,916
Getting confused?

[TYKI growls]

270
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:26,750
I'm the one you're
supposed to be fighting.

271
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:30,250
That's why you're here,
isn't it? For me.

272
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:33,666
I'm the one you
want to kill, right?

[TYKI growls]

274
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:38,500
Watch out, Allen!

[ALLEN grunts]

276
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:49,708
Getting careless, or did
you forget? I'm still here!

[ALLEN yells]

282

Is that it? We may not
get out of here alive,

283
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,333
and this may be my last battle.

284
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:09,833
But I'll keep fighting
until my final breath!

285

[TYKI yells]

286
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,458
That's the promise
I made with Mana!

[CHAOZII, LENALEE groan]

288
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:20,041
No!

[ALLEN] Our fierce battle
with the transformed

292
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:27,583
Tyki Mikk continues.

293
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:30,250
As we're backed into a
corner, and all seems lost,

294
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:34,083
an Exorcist in hiding
makes his appearance.

295
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:37,500
On the next D.Gray-man,
"Judgment."

296
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:40,791
Bring forth salvation
to this poor Akuma's soul!

[LENALEE]
Huh?

300
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,666
What's the matter, Lenalee?

301
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:51,916
A mosquito, I think.

302
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,375
Ah.

303
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:56,291
