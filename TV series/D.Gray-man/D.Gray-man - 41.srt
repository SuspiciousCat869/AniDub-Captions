1
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:56,125
You know with it pouring like

2
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:59,041
this I doubt the ferry's
gonna leave on schedule.

3
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:02,208
Hey guys!

4
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:05,416
I got some bad news...

5
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,041
The ferry's been cancelled.

6
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:08,416
According to the local sailors,

7
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,500
if we set out in this
rough weather the current

8
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:12,750
would drag us
into the Aegean Sea.

9
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:15,541
Sounds like we'll have
to wait until tomorrow.

10
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:17,041
It's frustrating to
get all the way

11
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:19,916
to the Bosporus Strait just
to get stranded like this...

12
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,083
but that's the way it is.

13
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:27,916
Yeah, I know that Timcanpy...

14
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,958
Master's over there
in that direction,

15
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:31,583
somewhere in Asia.

16
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:53,166
Come on... Isn't there
anything you can do?

17
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,833
None of the other
inns will take us.

18
00:02:58,625 --> 00:02:59,583
Look mister...

19
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:00,875
Are you saying
you want us to sleep

20
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:03,708
in the street in the
middle of a thunderstorm?

21
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:06,000
What do you expect
me to do, huh?

22
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,916
See?

23
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:10,375
We're already over capacity

24
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:13,458
with other people who are
stranded because of the ferry...

25
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:17,916
I'm sorry but I just can't
fit in any more customers.

26
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,083
I guess we'll have
to try somewhere else.

27
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,250
Any luck?

28
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,375
Nope. Everyone's packed solid.

29
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:43,625
Oh no...

30
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:46,166
Are we really going to
spend all night outside?

31
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:52,833
Look, it's a cat.

32
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,333
Aww... The poor thing...

33
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:57,166
She shouldn't be out here
in this terrible weather...

34
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,666
It looks like she's trying
to invite us somewhere.

35
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,333
Given the circumstances
I'll follow a cat anywhere

36
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:20,083
if we can get
out of the rain...

37
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:21,458
Hey! Wait for us!

38
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,125
Lavi!

39
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:38,833
Uh...

40
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,083
Where'd the cat go?

41
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:42,625
I don't see it.

42
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:45,333
Look... there!

43
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:51,583
Talk about an out-of-the-way
place for an inn.

44
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,041
Divine providence must
have guided us here...

45
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,125
It's all thanks to that cat...

46
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:57,666
I guess she just
couldn't stand seeing us

47
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,750
suffer in the rain like that.

48
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,791
Well let's hope they have
some rooms available.

49
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,416
Yes?

50
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:12,541
Think he'll do it...

51
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,791
There's not a doubt in my mind.

52
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:17,625
She's... so flippin' hot...

53
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:19,708
I knew it.

54
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:23,541
You're just my type!

55
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,250
May I help you?

56
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:28,125
Yes... We were hoping
you would have

57
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:29,958
some rooms
available for tonight.

58
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:31,500
Please... Don't make us beg...

59
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:32,875
We got stranded here

60
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,125
after the ferry was
cancelled 'cause of the storm.

61
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:35,666
Ah...

62
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:40,333
That's too bad.

63
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:42,583
Unfortunately my parents
aren't here today

64
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:45,208
so I can't offer any
additional amenities.

65
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:46,583
Ah right!!!

66
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:49,666
You wouldn't mind telling me
your name, now would ya?

67
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,208
My name...? Lulu Bell.

68
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:54,416
Ohhh, yes!

69
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,250
Thank you!

70
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,250
Oh thank you, Lulu Bell...!

71
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,583
You're the best!

72
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,500
The best... You won't
regret it... I promise...

73
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,666
She said she couldn't offer much

74
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,958
but I was hoping
for more than this.

75
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,666
How disappointing.

76
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,875
We did trouble her
to let us stay here

77
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:14,291
so don't expect too much.

78
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,333
She's right...

79
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,583
Once we take in this warm milk,

80
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:19,500
our bodies will
warm up nice and cozy.

81
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:24,625
This milk's colder
than the rain outside.

82
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,041
You know what I just realized?

83
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,041
The Bosporus Strait
is the place mentioned

84
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,916
in the Noah's Flood legend.

85
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,958
Wait do you mean
the Noah's Flood?

86
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:37,208
Exactly.

87
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:39,875
You probably heard all
about it from my brother

88
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:42,833
right after you
joined the Order.

89
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,708
Anti-Akuma Weapons are Innocence

90
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:48,291
that's been processed
into a useable form.

91
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,083
The original
creators of the cube

92
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,375
battled the Millennium
Earl with Innocence.

93
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:55,125
The Earl?

94
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:05,333
They used it to destroy
the Earl but in the end,

95
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:07,916
they destroyed
themselves as well...

96
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,166
This was referred to as Noah's
Flood in the Old Testament.

97
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,250
However the
prophecy inside the cube

98
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:19,500
referred to it as the
"three days of darkness."

99
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:21,083
Well according to the cube

100
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:22,708
the prophecy says
that the earl will be

101
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:25,541
responsible for bringing
the world to an end...

102
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,083
Right...

103
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:28,750
That's the whole reason the
Order began in the first place,

104
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:31,125
to prevent that prophecy
from coming true.

105
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,041
And so they set
about finding Exorcists

106
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,375
and Accommodators
of Innocence as a way

107
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:38,166
of combating against
this threat, huh?

108
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,208
One hundred and
nine pieces of Innocence

109
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:42,958
were scattered all over the
world during Noah's Flood...

110
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:44,166
Our mission is to track down

111
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,125
and collect them as
quickly as possible

112
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,291
so we can gain enough
power to finally defeat

113
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:51,125
the Millennium Earl
once and for all.

114
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:52,458
And yet...

115
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,708
From the Tiedoll Unit,
Daisya Barry.

116
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:04,208
From Socolo Unit...

117
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:08,000
Kazarna Rido...
and Charcar Lavong.

118
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:09,416
From Klaud Unit...

119
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,958
Tina Spark, Gwen Frere,
and Sol Galen.

120
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:16,041
All told six Exorcists
gave their lives in battle.

121
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:19,625
Including Finders, that brings
the number of confirmed dead...

122
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,708
...to one hundred
and forty eight.

123
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:22,916
We are being attacked

124
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,458
by the Earl and his
ally's the Clan of Noah

125
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:28,583
and our fellow Order members
continue to die as a result...

126
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:31,083
We've also lost some
pieces of Innocence.

127
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,291
Which is exactly why

128
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:35,041
we have to stay strong
and hang in there...

129
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,250
You're right...

130
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,166
The sooner we join up
with General Cross,

131
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,500
we'll be stronger and be able
to prevent more casualties.

132
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:43,875
It makes me wonder though...

133
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:46,541
When will this
storm finally let up?

134
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,666
Sure is frustrating
getting stranded here

135
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,750
when it's literally a
short trip across the water

136
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:54,250
to the continent
Cross is hiding on.

137
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:58,583
I know how you feel...

138
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:01,541
If this keeps up and the
ferry doesn't leave soon,

139
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,500
I may pass out from hunger.

140
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:05,541
You're funny, Allen.

141
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,166
Seriously! I'm not
kidding around!

142
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,500
I may die of starvation

143
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:11,583
if we don't get some food
around here and fast!

144
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,458
What are those noises...?
Ya hear em?

145
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:25,041
I'm sorry...
It's my dumb stomach...

146
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,833
I don't know what
to do to stop it.

147
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:30,875
I'm sorry.

148
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:34,000
You're doing it too, Krory?

149
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:36,625
I can't sleep
with all this noise.

150
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:39,875
I'm so jealous of Lenalee
getting her own room.

151
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:47,458
What on earth is that noise?

152
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:58,333
I can't take this anymore!

153
00:09:58,416 --> 00:09:59,833
Akuma!

154
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:04,916
Sorry I didn't see this comin'!

155
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,500
No worries...

156
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,750
This time your noisy stomach,
and not your eye for a change,

157
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:11,000
kept me from being
killed in my sleep.

158
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:14,833
Grow... Grow... GROW!

159
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:23,000
It'll be a waste if we
just blow them to pieces!

160
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,166
I finally got my meal.

161
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,375
I'm so hungry I don't
even have enough strength

162
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,583
to put up a fight!

163
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,208
Hey, thank you...
You saved me...

164
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,041
I was attacked
in my room too...

165
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,166
I'm just glad everyone's
still in on piece.

166
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,916
We are at least so far.

167
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:53,500
Anyone seen Lulu?

168
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,041
Hey, Lulu Bell...!

169
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,208
What the...

170
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,666
I can't find her anywhere.

171
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,583
Where could
she have gone?

172
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,208
Was she captured?

173
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:12,041
Oh no.

174
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:18,666
That cat again.

175
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,666
Isn't she the one who
lead us here earlier?

176
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:32,666
Oh no... You poor thing,
you're soaking wet.

177
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:57,250
Kill the family
that owns the inn,

178
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:58,333
then bring in the Exorcists

179
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,250
and attack them
while they're sleeping.

180
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,833
It was a perfect
plan, Lulu Bell.

181
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,875
Absolutely brilliant.

182
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:08,791
That's why I'm so incredibly
sorry for failing you.

183
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:10,666
Hands.

184
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,458
Huh?

185
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,375
Your hands aren't moving.

186
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:15,083
You're right!

187
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,000
My apologies Mistress!

188
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,458
It was just a test.

189
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,000
The attack from earlier...

190
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,750
I just wanted to
test the merits of this...

191
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:28,916
...Allen Walker boy.

192
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,333
I have heard that this young

193
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:34,000
and ever so annoying
Exorcist Allen Walker

194
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:38,666
can see the souls of Akuma using
nothing more than his own eye.

195
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,000
I do not know if
this is true or not,

196
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:44,041
but many of my precious
Akuma have suffered greatly

197
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:48,500
at the hands of this boy,
on multiple occasions.

198
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:52,208
Four Exorcists have banded
together, including Walker,

199
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:55,458
in hopes of finding the
hermitical General Cross,

200
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,250
but in order for
us to kill Cross

201
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,416
before he becomes a nuisance

202
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,958
we must stop this group
of fools from finding him.

203
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:05,875
Which brings me to you...

204
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:09,791
It is your turn now,
sweet, adorable pussycat...

205
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:13,166
Hinder their advances
as much as you like.

206
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:15,833
What?

207
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,958
You're asking if you
can kill the Exorcists...?

208
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,500
But of course, I encourage it.

209
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,333
That tickles...!

210
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:28,583
You sure do love to lick
people's faces, now don't ya?

211
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:36,125
If we're gonna do it,
it happens tonight.

212
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,791
So does that mean the rain
is going to end tomorrow?

213
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,291
Yes.

214
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:42,458
All right...

215
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,166
We've been following
them since Bulgaria

216
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,375
and finally our
chance has arrived...!

217
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:49,541
Now we can kill them before they
even make it across the strait!

218
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:52,333
They'll never
come near their goal!

219
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,333
Before that...

220
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,625
I need to do something.

221
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,583
Miss Bell where
are you hiding...?!

222
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:04,083
Can you hear me at all, Lulu?!

223
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:06,291
Allen, hey...!

224
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:07,333
Did you find her?!

225
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,166
Sorry, afraid not...

226
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,333
We've spent a long
time looking for her.

227
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:12,708
It pains me to say it,

228
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,750
but perhaps she fell
victim to the Akuma.

229
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:17,208
Maybe, but we don't
know that for sure yet.

230
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,291
Yeah...

231
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:19,833
For all we know,
she could have escaped

232
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:21,750
and is hiding somewhere in town.

233
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:24,041
In any case, let's keep looking.

234
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,875
I'll take this area again
and look a little closer.

235
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:29,125
'Kay, good luck, Lavi!

236
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,625
Unfortunately my
parents aren't here today

237
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:54,916
so I can't offer any
additional amenities.

238
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,458
Despite what she said,

239
00:14:57,541 --> 00:15:01,916
the daughter in this picture
doesn't look like her...

240
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,916
But if she is an Akuma,

241
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,208
wouldn't Allen's eye
have spotted her...?

242
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:09,083
Then she must be...

243
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:18,750
I'll be looking over here.

244
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,708
Lulu Bell!

245
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:24,958
Lulu Bell!

246
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:29,416
You're okay...

247
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,083
Thank goodness you're all right!

248
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:33,333
We were worried about you.

249
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,375
Thank you Lulu for
acting as our decoy...

250
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,666
Now you can step aside

251
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,625
and let the professionals
take over from here.

252
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,041
Attack...!

253
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:47,625
We can not allow Lulu Bell's
kindness to be wasted!

254
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,250
Get them!

255
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:04,666
Not again!

256
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,208
Ah great...

257
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:13,416
You bastards
sure are persistent!

258
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:19,625
I'm alright...

259
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:21,291
Don't worry about me.

260
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,666
We better get outta here!

261
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:44,416
Go...! Focus all of
your power on the boy...

262
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,208
I want him dead!

263
00:16:58,291 --> 00:16:59,541
It's too much...

264
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,125
There's no end to them!

265
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:13,500
Don't worry...

266
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,166
Just stand behind me.

267
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,958
I'll protect you.

268
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:18,333
Why are you helping me...?

269
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:19,583
Those Akuma...

270
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,750
They want nothing more
than to kill us both...

271
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,583
I'm so sorry you were
dragged into this.

272
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:27,291
It was never my intention
to put you in harm's way.

273
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,166
Akuma are created
by the Millennium Earl

274
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,583
who is hell-bent on
destroying the world.

275
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,500
We're Exorcists,
and it's our job

276
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:36,541
to stop his madness from
seeing the light of day.

277
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:39,291
Exorcists...

278
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:40,625
I see...

279
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:42,500
The Exorcists mission
is to not only crush

280
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,958
the maniacal ambitions
of the Millennium Earl

281
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:47,958
but to save his many
hapless victims from sorrow.

282
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,208
If you were to die someone

283
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:51,416
would surely be
saddened by your loss...

284
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,833
That's why it's
my duty to protect you...

285
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:58,500
Lulu... What the...

286
00:17:58,583 --> 00:17:59,541
Silly boy...

287
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:02,000
The Millennium Earl
is my master...

288
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,666
Those foolish enough
to deem him their enemy

289
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,541
are my enemy.

290
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,875
I'm with the Noah clan.

291
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:12,541
Noah...

292
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:16,583
Allen!

293
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:20,458
Lenalee!

294
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:21,875
Are you okay?

295
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:23,291
I'm here too guys.

296
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:27,625
Now then...

297
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:30,541
Let's end this.

298
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:34,791
Innocence...! Level Two Release!

299
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:35,833
Stamp...

300
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,625
Fire circle!

301
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,833
Devouring Flame...

302
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,291
Fire stamp!

303
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,833
Do you know how long
it took to gather those!

304
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,250
So The Clan of Noah...

305
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:06,125
You're an ally of
Road Kamelot, aren't you?

306
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,750
Wait!

307
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:27,291
That cat again.

308
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:30,541
Are you alright?

309
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,041
Now that another member
of the Clan of Noah

310
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:55,541
has appeared, our journey
is only gonna get tougher.

311
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,041
Which makes it all
the more important

312
00:19:57,125 --> 00:20:00,750
we find General Cross
as soon as possible.

313
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:01,666
And now...!

314
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,208
Let us go to Asia!

315
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,416
I hadn't thought of this,

316
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,166
but what if Lulu slipped
on the boat with us?

317
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:09,708
Don't worry, I'm just joking.

318
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,250
It doesn't look like she did...

319
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:14,250
at least I don't
think she did...

320
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:18,958
Lulu Bell... another
Noah member.

321
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:25,291
Why are we letting
them get away again?

322
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:27,750
We'll follow.

323
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,041
Oh yeah...

324
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:29,791
I mean...

325
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,291
I kinda figured as such,

326
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:32,875
since the Earl gave
everyone the order

327
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:36,500
to stop them from joining
up with Cross... Right?

328
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,583
There is that too.

329
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:39,916
If you were to die someone would

330
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,958
surely be saddened
by your loss...

331
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,916
That's why it's my
duty to protect you...

332
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:49,125
What he said annoyed me...

333
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,416
Annoyed me to no end...

334
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:56,583
That's why...
I've decided to kill him.

335
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:03,541
I will begin... Master.

336
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,583
Lulu Bell has set up
numerous traps

337
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:44,458
along our path while we
search for Master Cross in Asia

338
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:48,000
and she succeeds in cornering
us into each one of them...

339
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:50,583
On the next episode
of D. Grayman:

340
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:52,666
"The Black Cat's Traps."

341
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:56,416
Bring forth salvation to
this tormented Akuma's soul.
