1
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:11,333
Exorcists...

2
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:15,125
Chosen, by God Himself...

3
00:00:15,208 --> 00:00:20,166
They exist to destroy the evil
that lurks in the darkness...

4
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,125
an evil that brings pain and
suffering to the world.

5
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:07,750
And what's to
follow my friend...

6
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:09,250
Apparently there's
a place out there

7
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:11,375
that's being endlessly rewound.

8
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:12,708
What does that mean?

9
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:18,333
I've been expecting you.

10
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:21,708
Where is the Innocence?

11
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:23,833
I'd let go of her if I were you.

12
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,166
What's wrong?

13
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,541
Do you see those men
at the bar, Miranda...?

14
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:33,250
They're the only people
in town that have noticed

15
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:36,208
you're different than
everyone else aside from us.

16
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:40,250
I realize why you're the only
one this time warp effects,

17
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:43,333
and why you can see
things others cannot see...

18
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:44,958
It's because you're
the one who's in contact

19
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:48,333
with the Innocence that is
causing all these abnormalities,

20
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:50,583
which is why these
creatures are here.

21
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:52,750
Innocence activate!

22
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:01,541
All I want is to be normal...

23
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,291
but I can't
'cause my clock is...

24
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:04,958
made of Innocence.

25
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:09,875
Awww...

26
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:12,333
Answer a question for me...

27
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:14,291
Where's your clock hiding?

28
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:20,250
You are awake.

29
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,833
You're not an Akuma...

30
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:22,583
Tell me...

31
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:23,916
What are you?

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,666
I'm just a human being...

33
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,625
Is there something wrong with
a human befriending an Akuma?

34
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,625
Yes, there is!

35
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:30,958
Akuma are weapons created

36
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:33,916
by the Millennium Earl
in order to murder humans!

37
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,791
Weapons also exist for humans

38
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:38,000
to kill other humans,
do they not...?

39
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:41,125
The Millennium Earl is our
brother and our savior.

40
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:43,333
You see we are
the chosen ones...

41
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:47,000
the true Apostles that were
hand-picked by God himself.

42
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,333
I am Road...

43
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:50,583
And I am in the family of Noah.

44
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:06,250
You Exorcists think
your Black Order

45
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:10,083
is so powerful,
don't you...? I did too...

46
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:13,541
Well, until we came along.

47
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:16,291
The family of Noah...?

48
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:19,375
And you're not Akuma, but human?

49
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:28,708
Shhh...!

50
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:29,875
Quiet, Road, Lero...!

51
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:31,250
Shhh!

52
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,375
You should know it's forbidden

53
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,291
to tell strangers
all of our secrets!

54
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,458
Huh...?

55
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:36,958
And why is that?

56
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,333
You just can't do that...!

57
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:40,333
The Earl has yet to
finalize his ultimate plan

58
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,958
which means you can only
take the Innocence to safety.

59
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,000
Fighting these Exorcists
wasn't discussed!

60
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:47,166
Not only did you smuggle
me out without asking,

61
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,375
you've been making too many
decisions on your own!

62
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:51,125
Your recklessness is
going to get us spanked,

63
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:52,625
and I hate being spanked.

64
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:55,541
Lord Millennium would never
disgrace me with a spanking.

65
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,750
Lero, you need to calm down...

66
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:04,041
this little game is
all in the name of fun.

67
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,541
Believe me;

68
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:09,666
this show I've put on will
not interfere with his plans.

69
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,125
Lero.

70
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:39,583
Why would a...
human choose to...

71
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:48,458
Tell me.

72
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,583
What are you so angry for?

73
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,125
You don't believe I'm human,
I can see it in your eyes.

74
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,916
Feels nice, doesn't it?

75
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,458
This is how it's supposed to
feel when two humans embrace.

76
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,416
My name is Road Kamelot...

77
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,291
and I am a proud member
of the human race.

78
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:33,208
You're hiding something
from me... aren't you?

79
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,375
If you're human, just like us...

80
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,458
I'm not...

81
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:50,208
I'm superior to
you in every way.

82
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,541
She killed herself!

83
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:12,250
We are super-humans...

84
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,958
who have inherited
the DNA of Noah...

85
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:18,083
mankind's greatest Apostle.

86
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,416
So we're not
much alike at all...

87
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,500
You are what we refer
to as... sub-humans!

88
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,666
Killing you is no
different than snapping off

89
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,250
a tree branch or
stepping on an ant...

90
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:08,708
I hate this world

91
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:11,125
because it's become filled
with sub-humans like you...

92
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:14,625
To save it we must eliminate
each and every one of you.

93
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:16,458
And while we're on the subject,

94
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:18,041
God would also like
to see your kind

95
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,291
cast into the pit of fire...

96
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:23,250
Why do you think he gave
us Akuma in the first place?

97
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,500
That isn't God's will...

98
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,083
Not at all...!

99
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:30,833
It's just your own!

100
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,041
But that really
doesn't matter...

101
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,958
Does it?

102
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:41,166
Go ahead. Try to kill me.

103
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,708
I've got to stop her...
even if she's human!

104
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,500
My death's an impossibility.

105
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,666
Ice Fire!

106
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,541
Slicing Wind Scythe!

107
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:05,333
Pang Voice!

108
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,541
Allen!

109
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:12,541
In the state you're in,

110
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:15,958
you couldn't take on one
Akuma, let alone three.

111
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:21,833
I guess now is as good
a time as any to attack...

112
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,416
No... please don't...

113
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,500
You mustn't!

114
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:32,041
Oh God, no!!

115
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,833
Lero?!

116
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:40,333
Allen!

117
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,625
Don't move, okay?

118
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,541
Allen.

119
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,708
Allen... Please.

120
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:07,666
Please don't... die on me...

121
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:09,750
Allen...

122
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,875
Just stay strong.

123
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:19,583
I'm... gonna be fine.

124
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:32,500
You know you can't save him...

125
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:34,291
What are you doing?

126
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:35,916
She's nuts.

127
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,125
The woman has lost her mind!

128
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:43,583
Look at how pathetic she is!

129
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:46,416
Yes, that's right...

130
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,916
I'm pathetic... aren't I?

131
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,875
What a great choice of words...

132
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:53,125
You're no more pathetic

133
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:56,208
than any weak sub-human
that awaits their death.

134
00:11:56,291 --> 00:12:04,041
I'm giving... comfort...
and under... standing.

135
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,333
Idiot.

136
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:13,541
She's right...

137
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,750
I am an idiot.

138
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:43,708
I have numerous memories,
just like anyone would...

139
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,458
but none of them
includes someone

140
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:48,333
saying 'thank you' to me.

141
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,375
As a kid I was always
the one left behind...

142
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:56,000
in the shadows of everyone else.

143
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,583
No matter what I
attempt, even if it's

144
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:25,958
the most simple of tasks,
it always ends in failure...

145
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:27,333
Unfortunately, I find that

146
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:32,166
my life is one big
regret after another.

147
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,583
Yet after all these years,

148
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:39,333
I still don't know
when to give up...

149
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:41,500
Is it my fault to keep trying,

150
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,708
when the results
are always the same?

151
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:46,750
Is it impossible for me
to make things right?

152
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,291
Even if I tried to give up,
I don't think I could.

153
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:56,041
It's not in my nature to submit
in the face of disappointment.

154
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:58,958
In the end,

155
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:01,916
I guess I'm just a
glutton for punishment...

156
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,166
I really am... an idiot.

157
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:36,083
What's... happening...?

158
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:40,833
I can feel a... presence.

159
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,500
My clock...

160
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,000
It's...

161
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,833
Innocence.

162
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:36,166
Miranda... How...

163
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,125
Allen...

164
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:05,291
Are you okay?

165
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,958
Guess what...?

166
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:09,625
You are an Innocence
Accommodator after all.

167
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:13,000
An accommodator?

168
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,166
That's right.

169
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,083
What is this thing?

170
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,791
Hey, Miss Road...

171
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:28,541
Do you think I can touch
this or is that a bad idea?

172
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:31,583
Road, look!

173
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,708
That's some arm.

174
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,666
Lero?

175
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:49,083
His injuries have
already healed.

176
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,000
Lenalee...

177
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,500
Lenalee!

178
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:58,500
She's alive.

179
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:05,625
Allen... Is she alright?

180
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:06,708
She's fine...

181
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:08,750
I think she's just in a daze...

182
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:11,208
And it seems her nerves have
been temporarily paralyzed...

183
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:14,416
probably by the sonic
Akuma attack from before.

184
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,708
Are you sure?

185
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,958
How could she be
okay after that?!

186
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,000
Don't panic.

187
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:21,375
As long as she's
in here, she's safe.

188
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:31,333
What the...

189
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:32,958
Allen?

190
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:33,958
You're back!

191
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,708
Lenalee!

192
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,333
Timcanpy!

193
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:42,625
I didn't know you
were here, buddy!

194
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:48,041
I think I... remember dreaming.

195
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:49,708
What kind of dream was it?

196
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:52,166
It was my past...

197
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,250
but I can't remember
any details.

198
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,958
I wonder if your dream
was siphoned off too.

199
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:59,666
Wait, what does that mean?

200
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,958
Do you still not
see what happened...?

201
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:03,750
The Innocence that is
coursing through your veins

202
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,375
has saved all of
our lives, Miranda.

203
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,250
What...? You're... joking...

204
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:10,125
Aren't you?

205
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,958
I know it's probably hard to
believe but think about it...

206
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,875
When you activated,
the Innocence inside

207
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:19,000
you reset time to
before we got hurt.

208
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:22,333
So I really have...

209
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:24,916
Innocence in me.

210
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,916
Yes, Miranda...

211
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,125
Thank you.

212
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,833
You're thanking me?

213
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:36,583
From me too...

214
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,083
Thank you.

215
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:43,625
I can't... believe it.

216
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:58,875
Innocence activate!

217
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:01,833
The Waltz...

218
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:04,208
Misty Wind!

219
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,625
All this wind is hurting me!

220
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:11,375
I think it's coming
from Road's doll!!

221
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:12,416
I'm blinded!

222
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,583
I can't even see!

223
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,708
Amazing.

224
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:34,125
Allen.

225
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:35,916
Just stay put.

226
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:39,583
Attack!

227
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:41,250
Right!

228
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,833
No!!

229
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:48,291
Where are you...?

230
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,333
Filthy Exorcists!

231
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:51,500
I'm right here!

232
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,125
Now die!!!

233
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,583
Die!!!

234
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:04,625
Hold on!

235
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:16,333
Damn them!

236
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:17,833
I see...

237
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:21,583
The Exorcists are much craftier
than I thought they'd be.

238
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:56,333
Okay Road...

239
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:58,375
It's your move.

240
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:40,416
With our wounded
bodies rejuvenated,

241
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,375
we take the fight back
to Road and her Akuma...

242
00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:45,208
But her true colors
rear their ugly head

243
00:22:45,291 --> 00:22:46,416
when she tries to use some of

244
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,000
her dirty tricks
during the battle.

245
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:50,625
On the next D. Gray-man:

246
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:52,875
"And Snow Falls Over the Town."

247
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:56,125
Bring forth salvation to this
tormented Akuma's soul.
