1
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:39,666
[ROAD] Who cares
what this sword can do

2
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,208
if you're not really hitting me?

3
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:44,291
Come on. If you don't
know anything about me,

4
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:46,625
then how are you
ever gonna beat me?

5
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,708
[OTHER LAVI gasps]

6
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:03,000
And I'm not holding back!
Fire Stamp!

00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:07,541
[LERO screams]

8
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:09,083
[ROAD gasps]

9
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,666
[LAVI]
Too real for you?

10
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,208
Then how about an attack from
that dream world of yours?

11
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:21,916
[ROAD] I'm impressed you
figured out my disguise.

12
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,208
Well, of course. You do seem to
have a thing for Allen, so...

13
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:30,250
[ROAD] It's over. You'll never
become the next Bookman.

14
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:32,875
[LAVI] I didn't
want to do this,

15
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:35,500
but it's my best
course of action.

16
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:52,583
[LERO]
Mistress Road's hurt, lero!

17
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,958
He attacked himself.

18
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:01,625
Lavi... Lavi!

19
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:06,375
You'll die! You have to stop!

20
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,583
I just don't understand.
I thought you were number 49.

21
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:28,291
You're supposed
to be just like me.

22
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:32,250
Identical in every way.
But look at you.

23
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:35,791
Why aren't you
like the other 48?

24
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,333
What makes you
act so differently

25
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,666
from your previous incarnates?

26
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:46,416
You're having so
much trouble, 49.

27
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,000
You're torturing
yourself. For what?

28
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:55,333
Becoming a Bookman!
That's what's important!

29
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:58,916
But no! You'd rather fight
for your temporary friends!

30
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,333
Humans are a
worthless species

31
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:03,750
that do nothing but
start wars! Am I wrong?

32
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:06,666
Your allegiance should be
with the Bookman Clan first!

33
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,041
We can't let our emotions
get in the way of our job!

34
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:15,916
[LAVI]
Time changes things.

35
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,583
At first, I had no faith
in human beings.

36
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:24,125
They lived and died in a
world of unending conflict.

37
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,750
I wanted to think I
was better than them.

38
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:34,833
So... Do you have the answers?

39
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:37,750
The reason why we
Bookmen even exist?

40
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:40,833
Or how come human beings
are always creating wars?

41
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:43,166
Fighting each other?

42
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,791
How do you expect me
to know that?

43
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,958
You think I have any answers?

44
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:50,708
I've had many names
in this life.

45
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:55,416
You represent 1 through 48.
Lavi is my 49th.

46
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,333
But we're the same.

47
00:04:57,416 --> 00:05:00,500
It was you who asked
those questions.

48
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:03,166
You were the one
that started changing.

49
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,208
You need to get out
of here as much as I do.

50
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:10,958
[LAVI] We can't find
the answers if we stay.

51
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:17,291
[LENALEE grunts]

52
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,958
Wake up, dammit!

53
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:23,375
[LENALEE screams]

54
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:28,291

00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:52,750
It's Allen!

59
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,500
Please! Save him!
Save Lavi!

60

61
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,833
Come on! Break through!

[ALLEN yells]

64
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:22,791
Yeah, right!

65
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:26,041
You think I'm
gonna let you die?

66
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,583
[ALLEN]
Lavi!

67
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:38,875
Lavi!

68
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:45,958
Lavi! Lavi!
Grab my hand!

69
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:55,458
You and I are
the same person...

[CHAOZII, LENALEE gasp]

71
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,958
[ROAD] So you
managed to get out.

72
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:39,250
A promise is a promise.
Looks like you win this battle.

73
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:43,041
Lavi. Junior Bookman.

74
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:55,375
[CHAOZII] Wh... What
happened to the flames?

75
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,500
They're gone!
Where are they?

76
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:10,958
[LENALEE]
Lavi... Allen...

77
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:13,416
Huh? Is it over, lero?

78
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,375
But then...
Where's Mistress Road, lero?

79
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,791
[LERO yells]

80
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,333
M-Mistress Road!

81
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:29,000
No. It can't be, lero. She can't
be dead. Road can't be dead!

82
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:33,250
[CHAOZII]
Huh?

83
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,208
The barrier gave way.

84
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:38,166
Then, that must mean
Lavi beat Road.

85
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:43,458
[LENALEE] But where
is he? And Allen?

00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,208
[LENALEE gasps]

87
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:59,750
Are you there?
Say something!

They both survived!

92
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:23,541
Oh, man! It hurts to breathe!

00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,125
[LAVI]
We're alive.

95
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:29,666
[ALLEN] Sorry for
inconveniencing you!

96
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,208
[LAVI] Heh. You're reckless.
You know that, Allen?

97
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:34,166
[ALLEN] Gimme a break.
Find reckless in the dictionary,

98
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,000
you'll see your picture!

99
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,958
[LAVI coughs, laughs]

100
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,583
I don't know what happened.

101
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:43,000
But when I woke up,
I was on fire!

102
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,708
The old man will probably
yell at me for this.

103
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:48,375
But I feel pretty
good right now.

104
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:54,666
[LENALEE]
Lavi!

105
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:58,666
Hey, Lenalee!
Give you a scare?

106
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:02,875
A scare? What do
you think, idiot?

107
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:06,166
[LAVI screams]

108

[LAVI grunts]

109
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:11,916
Careful. Lenalee's got what
you would call tough love.

110
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:18,625
[LENALEE]
You had me so worried!

111
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,083
I'm sorry about that. Really.

112
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:28,833
[ROAD laughs]

113
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:32,166
M-M-Mistress Road?

114
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,958
She's alive?

115
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:37,708
[ROAD chuckles]

116
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:43,916
A... A... Allen.

[ALL gasp]

118
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:50,541
Don't go, lero!
Don't leave, Mistress Road!

119
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:57,500
A... A... Allen.

00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,041
[ALL gasp]

121
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:10,916
Mistress Road? Lero!

122
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,375
Whoa. What happened to her?

123
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:18,875
Did you hear the way she
whispered your name, Allen?

124
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,291
She really liked you.

125
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,583
Seriously, what was going on
between the two of you?

126
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:23,583
[LAVI groans]

127
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:24,916
Let's get one thing straight.

128
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,208
There was nothing
going on between us.

129
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:28,583
[LAVI]
What's the big idea?

130
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,958
Hitting me when I'm
completely covered in burns?!

131
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:32,750
[ALLEN] Yeah?
And whose fault is that?

132
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,333
[LAVI] That doesn't
matter, jerk!

133
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:35,916
[CHAOZII]
Guys! Please stop!

134
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,208
[LENALEE] I'm kind of curious.
Now that Road disappeared...

135
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:41,458
Does that mean the exit
she created in the tower

136
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:43,333
vanished as well?

137
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,625
[ALL scream]

138
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,416
Lavi! No time to waste!

139
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,625
Go through the ceiling
and see if it's there!

140
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,375
Yeah! You got it!

141
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,458
[LAVI] I'll take a look
and make sure it's safe!

142
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:59,333
If everything checks out, I'll
come back and pull you guys up!

143
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:00,166
Right.

144
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,875
We're counting on you!

145
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,500
[LAVI]
Extend!

146
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:09,458
Another tremor.

147
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,750
It won't be long until
this place collapses.

148
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:12,916
[CHAOZII yelps]

149
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,916
How are your
injuries, Chaozii?

150
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,916
It's nothing.

151
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,708
Let's take a rest.

152
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:21,083
Hope the door's there.
I'm ready to get out.

153
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:22,666
Yeah.

154
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,833
[ALLEN] Based on the shaking,
we've probably got half an hour.

155
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:29,208
Kanda... Krory...

156
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,125
[LENALEE] Hey, Allen.
If there is a portal,

157
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,375
you are going through with us?

158
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:34,916
[ALLEN]
Huh?

159
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:40,541
Eh... You got me.

160
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:41,875
What you mean is, "yes"!

161
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:44,291
Ouch. That was a
mean right hook.

162
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:46,250
You know, Lenalee,
you've gotten more violent

163
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,375
since you lost
the use of your legs.

164
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:49,708
[LENALEE]
Stop joking!

165
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,708
Kanda and Krory must've
gotten held up somewhere,

166
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:54,541
and I'm not leaving without
finding them. There's still time

167
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:58,000
for me to go back and search
the Ark before it disintegrates.

168
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,250
I'll look too.

169
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,125
[ALLEN] No, you guys go
ahead and wait outside.

170
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:02,708
Allen.

171
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:05,541
I'm the most mobile one in the
group, so it makes total sense.

172
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,083
Hm!

173
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:11,041
I know what I'm asking of you
is hard, but understand.

174
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:13,166
This really is for the best.

175
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:18,625
[LENALEE] How can you
be so heartless?

176
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:22,041
You're smiling?
After what you just told me?

177
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,791
You wear that
expression on your face

178
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:30,000
even though you know it'd
kill us if we lost you.

179
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,500
Honestly. It wasn't
that difficult

180
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:39,125
for me to figure out
what you were thinking.

181
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,000
Because if I was
in your position,

182
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:43,458
I know I'd do the same.

183
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:46,291
I'd go back and look
for our missing friends.

184
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,583
[LENALEE]
All I want...

185
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:58,166
...is for all of us to
go back home, together.

186
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:01,708
All right. Talk about
a change of luck!

187
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,833
Guess we're okay.

188
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:05,958
Hey! The portal's still up here!

189
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,833
Just hold onto the handle
and I'll pull you guys up!

190
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:11,000
Oh, wait.
That's not gonna work.

191
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,416
Allen, since Lenalee
and Chaozii are injured,

192
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,291
you're gonna need to carry
them up along with you!

193
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,291
Okay. You ready?

194
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:22,833
I'm sorry I'm so heavy.

195
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,791
Don't worry.
I'll be all right.

196
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,458
You're sure about this?

197
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:30,875
Yep. Hold on and whatever
you do, don't let go.

198
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,583
[LERO]
Lero!

199
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:35,333
Why aren't you
coming to help, Earl?

200
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,625
Why did you abandon us, lero?

201
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:40,208
[ALLEN]
Tyki Mikk...

202
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:42,208
Right! Let's get going!

203
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:46,208
This portal could disappear at
any minute! No time to waste!

204
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:47,750
[LENALEE, CHAOZII]
Mm.

205
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:52,333
Allen! Let's hurry!

206
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,916
[ALLEN] We're bringing
Tyki Mikk and Lero.

207
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,916
[LENALEE, LAVI gasp]

208
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,583
[CHAOZII]
Huh?

209
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,958
You've lost your mind.
You can't be serious.

210
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:04,541
His inner Noah is gone.

211
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:07,208
Which makes Tyki Mikk
an ordinary human now.

212
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:09,958
Do you remember when we
first met him, Lavi?

213
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,625
[ALLEN] He wasn't
alone on the train.

214
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:15,916
He was traveling with
a group of friends.

215
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
There's a chance
they're waiting for him.

216
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,125
It just wouldn't be right
to let him die here all alone.

217
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,416
Hey, I don't have
a problem with it.

218
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,958
But, Allen...

219
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:28,916
You know what the Order
would do if they found out

220
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,208
you helped them. A Noah?

221
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:34,041
[CHAOZII]
What do you mean "help"?

222
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:41,375
You're saying that after all we
endured, you didn't kill him?

223
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,666
I chose to let him live.

224
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:47,208
[CHAOZII] But why? They're
in league with the Akuma.

225
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:50,375
Did you forget how they
killed Anita? Mahoja?

226
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:54,041
How they murdered nearly
all of my shipmates?

227
00:15:54,125 --> 00:16:00,333
And here you are, helping
him. Helping a Noah!

228
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:03,250
You betray the sacrifice
they made for you!

229
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:06,458
If you save him,
then you're my enemy!

230
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:08,250
--Chaozii.
--My enemy!

231
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:11,500
In my eyes that makes you
no different than an Akuma!

232
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,833
Chaozii! Move!

233
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,166
[CHAOZII gasps]

234
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:25,958
What happened?

235
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,750
Say something, Allen!

236
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:36,333
Don't... Don't get closer!

237
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:38,291
[ALLEN moans]

238
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:40,625
[CHAOZII shudders]

239
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:45,750
[ALLEN screams]

240
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:48,416
[CHAOZII shudders]

241
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,791
[ALLEN screams]

242
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:53,083
[CHAOZII shudders]

243
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:54,083
[LAVI]
Allen!

244
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,708
[LENALEE]
 Let go of him!

245
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:59,083
[LAVI] Allen! Damn!
It dragged him down there!

246
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:00,916
What the hell was that thing?

247
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,583
[LENALEE]
Allen, can you hear me?

248
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:08,791
Why did... Why'd you save me
after the things I said?

249
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,625
[ALLEN]
Chaozii! Move!

250
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,750
Why would you rescue me?

251
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:25,333
I refuse! I'm not gonna
lose another comrade!

252
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:30,958
Exorcist, hold on!

253
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:46,208
[ALLEN groans]

254
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:49,958
[ALLEN] No... The door.
Our only way out.

255
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:52,083
[ALLEN groans]

256
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:58,583
[ALLEN pants]

257
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:01,208
[ALLEN gasps]

258
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:11,666
Who are you? Tyki?

259
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:15,416
But that's impossible.
I destroyed your Noah.

260
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,000
What is going on?

261
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:29,250
Answer me. What are you?

262
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:34,416
[ALLEN] Are you Tyki Mikk...
or something else?

263
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,125
[ALLEN gasps]

264
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:39,291
[ALLEN]
What is this feeling?

265
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:46,833
[ALLEN] I sense the power
of the Noah within Tyki Mikk.

266
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:50,041
The air I breathe...
It's cold as death.

267
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,041
[ALLEN] 
I thought...

268
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:57,250
I don't like this.

269
00:18:57,333 --> 00:19:00,208
I had destroyed it.

270
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:02,333
This terrible feeling.

271
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:08,125
[ALLEN grunts]

272
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:16,875
[ALLEN] Tell me what's
going on! Say something!

273
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,041
[ALLEN]
Huh?

274
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,375
[ALLEN]
His blood... It's pitch black.

275
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:38,708
[TYKI screams]

276
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:39,708
[ALLEN gasps]

277
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:50,791
[TYKI screams]

278
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:53,500
His body's changing?

279
00:19:53,583 --> 00:20:01,541
[TYKI screams]

280
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:06,375
Lero! Where are you,
Lord Earl?

281
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:08,833
Why aren't you here
to save Lero?

282
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:12,333
[TYKI screams]

283
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:16,416
[ALL gasp]

284
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,458
[ALLEN gasps]

285
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:10,208
[ALLEN] Tyki Mikk's Noah
has fully awakened,

286
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:12,750
transforming him
into a demonic knight.

287
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:15,125
A dark warrior
possessing such ferocity

288
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:18,875
his very essence threatens
to eclipse our hope.

289
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:22,541
On the next D. Gray-man,
"Black Carnival."

290
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:25,958
Bring forth salvation
to this poor Akuma's soul!

291
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:30,750
[LERO] So who can answer
the problem, lero?

292
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:33,458
What? Not a single
student in here, lero?

293
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:35,791
Hey, Allen. I'm sorry
I ate all your dumplings.

294
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:37,416
I forgive you, Lavi.

295
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,791
Thanks, buddy.

296
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:40,458
On that note,
I'm the one who stole

297
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:42,041
and ate your lunch
the other day.

298
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:43,708
[LAVI]
Ah--?!

299
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:45,666
And it was delicious, too!

300
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,750
Oh, yeah? Fire Stamp!

301
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,208
--[LENALEE] Huh?
--[LERO] Lero?

302
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:51,625
What's going on out here?

303
00:22:51,708 --> 00:22:53,125
It probably
wasn't a good idea

304
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:55,750
to use your fire stamp
in a hallway.
