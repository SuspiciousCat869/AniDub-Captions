1
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:47,916
Oh no.

2
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,291
It isn't good. Right now,
part of the ship

3
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:54,750
is experiencing repeated
time recoveries.

4
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:58,208
It's coming from...

5
00:01:58,291 --> 00:01:59,625
...above us.

6
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:03,458
The ship's deck
is being attacked!

7
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:11,708
[ESHI] I think I'll title this
one: "Corpse of an Exorcist"

8
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:23,708
[LAVI] Devouring Flame!
Direct Fire Stamp!

9
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:32,791
Dammit! I could've done
without those injuries!

10
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,250
New title:

11
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:35,583
[LAVI]
Huh?

12
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:39,208
[ESHI] "Why Does This Exorcist
Keep Recovering?"

13
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:44,791
There's no way.
You must be a Level Three.

14
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:48,541
[ESHI] I can tell you about
him, on one condition.

15
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,791
You agree to be a
model for my art.

16
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:55,916
[BOOKMAN gasps] You're...
You're a Level Three Akuma!

17
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,333
[gasps]

18
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:09,166
I title this...
"Old Man and the Moon"

19
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:11,458
[LAVI]
No.

20
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:15,083
[LAVI grunts]

21
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:19,750
Old man! Come on! Please!

22
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:22,125
Wake up!

23
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,958
[LAVI]
Old man!

24
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:34,416
[ESHI chuckles]

25
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,958
Please. Please work.

26
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:08,000
It has to. Please.

27
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,041
[CREW grunting]

28
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,916
Those who can move,
get to your positions!

29
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,500
[MIRANDA panting]

30
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,583
[KRORY] I don't like what
I'm seeing out there.

31
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,833
[LENALEE]
I'm really worried about them.

32
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,083
[KRORY gasps]

33
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:45,333
[LENALEE]
What is it?

34
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,250
[KRORY] Just now I had
this sinking feeling...

35
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,583
[MIRANDA gasping]
We have a problem!

36
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,833
Lavi's traveling too
far away from the ship!

37
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,083
When he leaves my coverage,

38
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:55,250
his injuries are going
to return immediately!

39
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,416
And now he's in
the middle of combat.

40
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,375
There has to be
something we can do.

41
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,083
Leave the Akuma to me.

42
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:03,666
[MIRANDA]
You can't go alone!

43
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,083
[KRORY]
You sure you'll be all right?

44
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:06,791
I will.

45
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,958
Lenalee, promise
you'll come back.

46
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:15,416
Yes. I'll see you again.

47
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,875
[KRORY]
Uh.

48
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,958
[LENALEE]
Innocence Activate!

49
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,583
Please be careful.

50
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:40,833
[LENALEE] You need to
head back to the ship!

51
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,375
[LAVI]
Lenalee! Hold on!

52
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:43,791
Don't go!

53
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:46,208
His power's different from
Akuma we've fought before!

54
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,333
He's a Level Three!

55
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:50,583
You can't fight him alone!

56
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:53,916
[LAVI groaning]

57
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,875
[LAVI] My injuries. Why are
they coming back now?

58
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,833
I must be too far away
from the ship. Dammit.

59
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:03,291
Uh. Lenaleee!

60

[ESHI chuckles]

Don't worry about me, Lavi.
I'll take care of this.

[LAVI gasps]

71
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:11,416
Go back and protect
the ship while I'm gone.

72
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:17,500
[LENALEE] I'll catch up
with all of you later.

73
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:20,125
There's no way
I'm leaving her.

74
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:22,791
[BOOKMAN]
Lavi. Go back to the ship.

[LAVI gasps]

76
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:27,500
He's not the only
one we have to fight.

00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:31,333
There are more of them up there.
Just beyond the clouds.

You all right, Exorcist?

didn't get hit. Good.

What about you?
Don't you understand?

If you're injured, you'll die
when time goes back to normal!

[SAILOR A chuckles]

We know. But we've already been
hit several times before.

00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:53,333
You see, we've got nothing
left to lose by shielding you.

We aren't going to survive
this voyage anyway.

use and protect you.

This isn't right.

This is my dark matter ability.

163
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,375
I use it to control the
gravity of my victims.

164
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:45,500
You didn't know, but every
time you received an attack,

165
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:48,000
dark matter was added
to the damage.

166
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:49,625
Weighing you down gradually

167
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:52,166
until you began to
sink into the water.

168
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:56,375
Not so fast anymore
are you, Exorcist?

169
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:00,291
This is the end for you.

Even if you know it won't
make any difference.

It will fill you with
a false sense of hope.

For a short while at least.

[KRORY] This must be the doing
of that Akuma from earlier!

Then that means our only
chance is defeating him!

And we gotta do it quick,

I lost my balance.

[ALLEN] Eshi's ability

continues to drag
Lenalee lower.

Further into the dark,

Huh. So, someone wrote
in requesting to know

how <i>D. Gray-Man</i> Character
