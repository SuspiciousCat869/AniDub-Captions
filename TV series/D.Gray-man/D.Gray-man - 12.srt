1
00:01:37,916 --> 00:01:38,958
The Waltz...

2
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:41,375
Misty Wind!

3
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:48,625
I'm right here!

4
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:57,458
I see...

5
00:01:57,541 --> 00:02:01,208
The Exorcists are
craftier than I thought.

6
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:02,875
Okay Road...

7
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:04,875
It's your move.

8
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:14,458
Kill them.

9
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:17,833
Ice Fire!

10
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:20,500
Slicing Wind Scythe!

11
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:29,500
They did it, lero!

12
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:56,458
How can the good guys
still be alive, lero?!

13
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:58,458
That hurts, lero...!

14
00:02:58,541 --> 00:02:59,958
What are you doing to me, lero?!

15
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:01,750
It's that woman...

16
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,291
Allen...

17
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,000
Lenalee...

18
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:21,250
Ice Fire!

19
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:26,916
Slicing Wind Scythe!!

20
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,541
My arm...

21
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,458
My wounds returned...

22
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:51,416
Lenalee...! Do you think
you can hold them off?

23
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,125
I just need a minute!

24
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,125
Sure...!

25
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:55,208
Hurry, Allen!

26
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:56,583
I'll be back!

27
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,416
Someone is here...

28
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,208
I feel it.

29
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:16,333
Time is being... changed...

30
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,041
Amazing!

31
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,875
You are alright...
aren't you, Allen?

32
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:25,000
Yes, because of you...

33
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:27,541
I'll return!

34
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,083
Be careful.

35
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:39,250
Have you reached your limit yet?

36
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:43,208
Why don't we release you from
your suffering right away?!

37
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,125
Slicing Wind Scythe!

38
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:56,375
Allen...

39
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:57,916
That was a close one...

40
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,250
At least you're back.

41
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:00,583
Well, it appears as
though our injuries

42
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:03,416
come back whenever
we're away from Miranda...

43
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,166
You need to go to her right
now for healing, Lenalee...

44
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,625
Can you make it alone?

45
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:08,833
Sure I can.

46
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:10,250
I've got this...

47
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,416
Okay.

48
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,375
She's a user...

49
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:17,791
That Miranda woman somehow
bonded with the Innocence.

50
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,291
Is that true, lero?!

51
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,208
I'm not sure how
she's doing it,

52
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,000
but it looks like
when they get near her

53
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,916
all of their injuries disappear.

54
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,666
Then they'll keep
coming back... lero?!

55
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,083
Allen!

56
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,291
Hey, you made it back!

57
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,875
Alright you two,
that's enough now.

58
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,666
What?!

59
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:49,583
Who is that?

60
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:53,041
Allen, that's the girl we saw
at the theatre, isn't it...?

61
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,291
What is she...?

62
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,208
Is she an Akuma?

63
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,333
No.

64
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,666
She's human.

65
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:04,541
But how?

66
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:11,625
A... L... L... E... N.

67
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,500
It's Allen Walker...

68
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:17,000
the one who can see
the souls inside Akuma.

69
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:18,750
I'm sorry,

70
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:20,291
perhaps I should have
mentioned before that

71
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:23,958
the Lord Millennium has already
told me a little about you.

72
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:25,833
About how you're
working as an Exorcist

73
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:29,541
to actually save
Akuma, isn't that right?

74
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:34,708
When I heard that, I just
laughed and laughed...

75
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,458
And that's when I knew...

76
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:41,458
I knew that I wanted to play
with Allen Walker someday.

77
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:45,125
You, Akuma.

78
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:46,583
Yes?

79
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:49,500
Blow up, please.

80
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:50,958
What?!

81
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,125
Hey, Lero... Start
counting down from ten.

82
00:06:58,208 --> 00:06:59,750
Uh... ten, lero...

83
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,000
Wait...

84
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:03,083
No... Road, you can't do
this, it's not fair...!

85
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:06,875
I've turned into such
a powerful Akuma now!

86
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:09,291
Road, you can't!

87
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:10,916
Road, what are
you trying to do?!

88
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,041
Six, lero...

89
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,250
What happens when
Akuma are destroyed

90
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,791
by something other
than Innocence?

91
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:15,750
Five, lero...

92
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:17,291
Let's imagine, for example,

93
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:20,666
if an Akuma were
to blow himself up...

94
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,875
Still don't know...?

95
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,291
Then I'll tell you...

96
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:27,458
Their souls will vanish along
with the dark matter...

97
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:30,833
If that happened you
couldn't save it, could you?!

98
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:33,833
Two, lero...

99
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,958
Don't do it!

100
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,625
No...! It's too late!

101
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:42,083
Come back!

102
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,541
I have to get there first...

103
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,166
I have to destroy him!

104
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,875
One, lero...

105
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,416
Allen!

106
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:19,958
Help me!!

107
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,750
Are you okay?!

108
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:48,541
Why'd you stop me?!

109
00:08:56,125 --> 00:09:00,208
Why do you think, Allen,
because you're my friend!

110
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,291
Oh, it was wonderful...!

111
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,291
Trying to stop him
from exploding...

112
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,583
I couldn't have guessed
how heroic you are!

113
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:10,958
You monster...

114
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:15,500
But would a real hero...
leave her all by herself?

115
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,375
Don't touch her!!

116
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,833
Slicing Wind Scythe!

117
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,083
Are you alright, Miranda?!

118
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:47,500
Yes... I'm fine...

119
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:52,041
Miranda...

120
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,916
Aw... you beat us to her.

121
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,541
I guess it's time to
call it a day anyway...

122
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:05,500
You were much more fun than
I expected, Allen Walker.

123
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,250
See ya...

124
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:24,708
Go ahead and shoot.

125
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:35,166
Help me!!

126
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:42,750
What a sweetheart
you are, Allen...

127
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:45,625
You really hate me, don't you?

128
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:49,583
Go ahead and shoot me...
but don't forget...

129
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:52,500
that arm of yours
is also a weapon.

130
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,041
Weapons also exist for humans

131
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:57,291
to kill other humans,
do they not?

132
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:00,000
Feels nice, doesn't it?

133
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:03,875
This is how it is supposed to
feel when two humans embrace.

134
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:10,250
Look at you, crying
over an Akuma...

135
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,500
I knew you didn't
have it in you...

136
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:16,500
Well then... let's save
the rest for later...

137
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:25,208
But let me warn
you... next time...

138
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,166
It won't be so easy,

139
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:31,000
because the Lord Millennium
will set the stage for us!

140
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,625
Dammit!

141
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,833
It's all collapsing!

142
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,000
Stay close!

143
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:08,916
Lenalee...! Miranda!

144
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,791
I'm here...

145
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,458
I've come back...

146
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:53,416
I've returned to
Miranda's apartment...

147
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,125
But wait, how...

148
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:58,041
What happened to
the place we were...

149
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:03,250
Did she... Did Road destroy it?

150
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:08,916
Allen...?! Allen?!

151
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,458
There's something
wrong with Miranda!

152
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,833
Miranda!

153
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:23,625
What's the matter?

154
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:26,958
I think that she's refusing
to deactivate her Innocence.

155
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,625
Please, Miranda,
you have to stop...

156
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,625
Your body isn't strong enough
yet to control it this long.

157
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:33,916
I can't...

158
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,500
If I were to let it stop...

159
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,875
If I were to stop now...
then it all comes back...

160
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:58,083
...the time comes
back to you both.

161
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:01,208
And that means... you two...

162
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:06,833
Your injuries would come
back... all of that pain.

163
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:14,208
I can't... let that happen...

164
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:15,583
I finally...

165
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:20,875
Someone finally thanked
me for something...

166
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,375
Yes, Miranda...

167
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,166
Thank you.

168
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:28,916
I have to keep it going.
I can't stop...

169
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:32,625
I can't stop...

170
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,791
It's alright...
Deactivate it...

171
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:57,208
Hey, look at me...

172
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:05,166
Miranda, you've earned a rest.

173
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,875
I mean, if it weren't for you

174
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:13,375
we probably wouldn't
even be here anyway

175
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:15,291
and we're grateful
for that trust me.

176
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:16,375
That's right, Miranda.

177
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:17,916
If you hadn't activated
your Innocence,

178
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,125
we wouldn't have been
able to survive that attack.

179
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,375
Much less escape...

180
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:24,000
Thank you for saving us.

181
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:27,916
But we should be the ones
to carry our own injuries.

182
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,500
Yeah...

183
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:32,125
As long as we're alive they have
a pretty good chance of healing.

184
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,708
Miranda...

185
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:40,291
Our bodies are going to
heal in time... so let go...

186
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,833
Let it stop.

187
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:19,375
Ahh... another day,
another dollar...

188
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,083
Building Manager!!!

189
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:23,166
Oh, Miranda...?!

190
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,666
Why... What's the matter...?!

191
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,125
And wha... what's this...

192
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:27,583
Wha... What have you
done to your hands?!

193
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:28,583
Doctor...!

194
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,250
Please, call a doctor...

195
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:33,333
there are people with
serious injuries... please!

196
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:34,375
Please hurry...!

197
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,625
We need a doctor immediately...

198
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:38,500
Oh, please...

199
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:56,833
Hello!

200
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,166
Does anyone hear me?

201
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,708
I'm looking for the Finder
from the Black Order...!

202
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:02,250
Are you out here, Mr. Finder?!

203
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:03,083
Where are you...?!

204
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:06,291
Someone finally... came out.

205
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:22,625
Our injuries will heal...
as long as we're alive.

206
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,916
We'll be fine.

207
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:35,833
But the scars will remain.

208
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:42,250
This doesn't look good...

209
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,875
Lavi, keep watch and
make sure no one comes in.

210
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,333
Gotcha.

211
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:57,708
Ahhh!

212
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:58,625
Hey...

213
00:17:58,708 --> 00:17:59,833
I'm surprised you're awake.

214
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:02,708
Komui...?! Uh, where am I?!

215
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,416
You're in a hospital,
of course...

216
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,916
Don't worry, though,

217
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,041
it's a very reliable facility
partnered with the Order.

218
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:11,791
But, wait... what
are you doing here?

219
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:14,250
I'm here to make sure you
get back into tiptop shape!

220
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,750
Oh, that's nice...

221
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:19,625
Why aren't we at the order?

222
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,916
Well, you both had very
serious injuries...

223
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,333
so we couldn't transfer you
to Headquarters yet.

224
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:26,625
Where's Lenalee?

225
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:27,750
She's here...

226
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,541
She has nerve damage,

227
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,750
so she probably won't
wake up for a while.

228
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:32,833
Oh, I see.

229
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:36,125
Yeah, but I think
she'll be fine.

230
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,541
That old geezer is
with her right now

231
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:41,916
so she should be good
as new before you know it.

232
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:46,875
So, I'm Lavi...

233
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:49,000
It's nice to finally meet you.

234
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:53,291
It's nice to meet you, too.

235
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:55,041
Oh, that reminds me...

236
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,666
Some lady stopped by
to see you earlier...

237
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,458
She left a letter for you.

238
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,166
Didn't stick around though.

239
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:03,458
Let's see...
it's from a Miranda Lotto?

240
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:05,750
Do you know her?

241
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:08,458
Lemme see it. What does it say?!

242
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:09,750
Stop trying to move so fast!

243
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:10,583
Allen!

244
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:11,208
Do you have any scissors...?

245
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:12,083
Come on, anyone?!

246
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:13,750
I've got a drill.

247
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,875
Dear Allen and Lenalee...

248
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,916
you'll have to forgive me for
not staying to see you wake up.

249
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,500
I heard that Miranda is moving!

250
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:27,500
Really?

251
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,000
She wasn't thrown
out or anything?

252
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:32,916
Since the day I stopped
the clock's Innocence,

253
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,500
there have been no more
mysterious phenomena

254
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,041
in this town...

255
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,958
The citizens don't seem
to have any idea...

256
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:44,291
that October twenty-eighth
repeated thirty-four times.

257
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,583
Now that I look back...

258
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,375
I believe that the
Innocence caused everything

259
00:19:57,458 --> 00:20:01,125
to happen the way it
did in order to test me...

260
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,208
Do you think that's possible...?

261
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,875
Or am I being silly?

262
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:06,208
You'd just better be grateful

263
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,291
because I'm not forgiving
you next time, honey!

264
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,500
I know, I know...

265
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,250
...but you're the one
I really love, dear.

266
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,333
Do you mean it?

267
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:14,333
After all, the Innocence
did keep silent

268
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:18,708
until just the right moment
for me to use it, did it not?

269
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:20,666
Thank you very much
for everything.

270
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,625
Ah, well...

271
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:22,416
Take care now.

272
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,958
Oh... that reminds me...

273
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,125
But however it came about...

274
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:29,208
I feel that I've finally found
my place in the world.

275
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:30,583
Here.

276
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:31,833
Hm?

277
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,333
When you replace
the wallpaper,

278
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,625
please send the bill
to that address.

279
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,208
Who is this?

280
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:49,791
It's my new employer.

281
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:54,541
I know...
I'll see you both again.

282
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:00,791
And next time...

283
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:05,458
I'll stand beside you...
as an Exorcist.

284
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:39,875
My eye has lost the ability

285
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:44,500
to detect Akuma and I'm not
sure if or when it will heal...

286
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:48,083
Now they're able to surprise us
by blending in with the crowd!

287
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:52,666
On the next episode of D.
Gray-man: "With the Coat."

288
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:56,083
Bring forth salvation to this
tormented Akuma's soul!
