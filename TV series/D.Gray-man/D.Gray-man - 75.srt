[MILLENNIUM EARL]
Why, good evening.

9
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:33,791
What a surprise to
see you again...

10
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:37,125
...Allen Walker!

11
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,500
[ALLEN]
Hmph.

12
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:44,166
Hello, Earl. Good evening.

13
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:53,458
[MILLENNIUM EARL] You know,
you're becoming a real pain

14
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:56,333
in my neck. Showing up at
the most inopportune times

15
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,291
and ruining my plans.

16
00:02:58,375 --> 00:02:59,291
[ALLEN]
It's over.

17
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:00,916
You can't have Lenalee!

18
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,125
[MILLENNIUM EARL laughs] Cling
to her as much as you want.

19
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:05,541
Makes things easier for me,

20
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:09,291
since neither of you
are getting out alive!

21
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:13,416
[BOTH gasp]

22
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,583
[MILLENNIUM EARL]
The two of you can die together!

23
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:16,833
[ALLEN grunts]

24
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:20,375
[MILLENNIUM EARL]
Huh?

25
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:23,083
I won't let you lay
a hand on her again!

26
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,125
[MILLENNIUM EARL]
Huh?

27
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:30,083

[LENALEE whimpering]

My legs...

30
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,958
Because of the crystallization,
they won't move.

31
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:57,583
[LENALEE]
Allen...

32
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:11,708
Heh, heh, heh. I'm comin'
for you, my dear.

33
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,791
Huh?

34
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:15,500
What the...?

35
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:19,166
You're persistence is tiresome.

36
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:21,541
Fight me, Earl!

37
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:23,916
[MILLENNIUM EARL]
If you insist!

38
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,250
[ALLEN grunts]

39
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:37,291
[MILLENNIUM EARL]
Well, so serious.

40
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:40,208
You know what you remind
me of? A white face clown.

41
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:43,208
Chasing after the
gleeful Auguste.

42
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:47,375
Is that what you think is
happening, silly child?

43
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:50,583
[ALLEN] Guess that makes
you the Auguste.

44
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:54,041
If it's my job to stop the fool,
then I'm happy to oblige!

45
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,833
[MILLENNIUM EARL]
Hm?

46
00:04:57,583 --> 00:05:00,625
I won't stand by while you
make everyone suffer!

47
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,458
I came back to the battlefield

48
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:06,208
to put a stop to you
once and for all!

49
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:08,500

[MILLENNIUM EARL groans]

54
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:50,750
There's only one way to
save humans and Akuma!

55
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:53,666
You're the one not
leaving this place alive!

56
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,041
Cross Grave!

61

Looks like the performance has
concluded, but we'll meet again.

62
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:14,041
And hopefully next time we won't
put our audience to sleep.

63
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,458
Lenalee!

64
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,583
[MILLENNIUM EARL] Perhaps she'll
join us for the encore.

65
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:21,375
That is, if this isn't
the final show.

66

[gasps]

67
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:24,541

Take a bow!

[LAVI grunting, coughing]

69
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:37,958
Did you see what happened?

70
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:40,458
[LAVI]
Some kind of explosion.

71
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:41,916
[ALLEN]
Lenalee!

72
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,875
Lenalee!

73
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:45,375
What? Allen?

74
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:49,041
No. Come on.
Get it together, Lavi.

75
00:06:58,875 --> 00:06:59,875
[LAVI]
Man...

76
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:02,958
What is going on here?

77
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:07,500
[gasps] An Akuma?

78
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:10,833
Lavi!

79
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:12,333
There's no way!

80
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:13,708
It's Allen!

81
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:15,458
I can't get Lenalee to wake up.

82
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,500
[LAVI]
What's wrong?

83
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:25,166
Oh yeah. I've seen this before.

84
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,458
Hey, but don't worry.

85
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:29,250
Her condition shouldn't
be life threatening.

86
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:30,958
[ALLEN]
Really? Are you sure?

87
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:32,041
[LAVI]
I'm positive.

88
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,666
What a relief.

89
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,291
This has happened before?

90
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,125
One other time
that I know about.

91
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,916
After the crystallization,
she was so exhausted that--

92
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,708
[KANDA]
So you thought you could escape.

93
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:43,208
[LAVI, ALLEN]
Huh?

94
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:43,750
[KANDA]
Die!

95
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:44,833
[ALLEN yelps]

96
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:46,541
Hey! Kanda!

97
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:47,250
What?!

98
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,166
Short Stack?

99
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,458
The name's Allen.

100
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,000
Why are you here?

101
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,625
I should be asking
you the same thing.

102
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:55,375
I was following a Noah
with curly hair.

103
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:56,500
Hey, Lavi.

104
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,000
Do you have any idea
where he went?

105
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,500
Come to think of it, that
muscly guy I was fighting

106
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:03,166
vanished, too.

107
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,000
The Noah are gone.

108
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:07,708
What happened to them?

109
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,125
[ALLEN]
Don't give me that face!

110
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,791
You can't pretend like I'm
the one who let them escape!

111
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:17,208
If you want the truth,
I might as well tell you.

112
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:19,500
The Noah got away
'cause you're slow.

113
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,083
What did you say to me?

114
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:24,583
I coulda sworn you were calling
me slow just now, Short Stack.

115
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,291
Even though you were
the last to show up.

116
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:29,333
How many times do I need to
tell you, my name's Allen.

117
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:30,875
That's right, I forgot.

118
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:33,541
You can't help that you're a
bit slow in the head as well.

119
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,000
You've got some nerve.

120
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:37,375
I'm gonna show you how fast
I can be, Short Stack!

121
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,541
Let's go! Draw your weapon!

122
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,875
I'll slice off your hair
and make wigs out of it!

123
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:45,000
I think black hair would fetch a
higher price on the wig market.

124
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:47,625
[KANDA] I'll be generous and
leave one strand on your head.

125
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49,791
That's enough, kids.
Settle down.

126
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,083
Marie's right.

127
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:52,833
You guys should be carrying
on like old times!

128
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:54,833
[BOTH]
We are. Don't interrupt.

129
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:57,166
[LAVI, MARIE]
Uh...!

130
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:02,625
That person standing next
to Kanda looks like...

131
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:03,958
It can't be.

132
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:06,750
It's Allen Walker.

133
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,875
Just as I thought, he's alive.

134
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,875
[TIEDOLL]
With one slight difference.

135
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:16,916
The form of his Innocence
has changed.

136
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,916
A great deal has happened in
such a short amount of time.

137
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,291
Hm... Looks like we'll
need to get caught up

138
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:28,041
before we go any further.

139
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,208
[TYKI] Just when things
were getting fun.

140
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:42,791
Was it really necessary to
withdraw, Lord Millennium?

141
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:45,458
That Exorcist girl could have
been the Heart, you know.

142
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:48,041
We should have taken
her out then and there.

143
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,500
[MILLENNIUM EARL]
So heavy.

144
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,541
You might want to consider
cutting back on the sweets,

145
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,416
Skinn, my darling.

146
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,250
[TYKI]
You're not even listening.

147
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:56,833
Man. What a pain.

148
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:58,291
[ROAD]
The Ark data transfer

149
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:01,000
will be complete in less
than four hours, Earl.

150
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,250
[TYKI]
Huh?

151
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:03,875
[MILLENNIUM EARL]
Oh, Road. A job well done.

152
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:06,125
How can I repay you?

153
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,083
I want a year's supply of candy.

154
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:10,416
That's my standard rate.

155
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,041
[MILLENNIUM EARL]
It's a deal.

156
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:15,291
Speakin' of jobs, I can think of
someone who failed at theirs.

157
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:18,625
Your target seems to have come
back from the grave, Tyki.

158
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:19,500
[TYKI]
Huh?

159
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,708
He's alive? Left arm and all?

160
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:22,958
You sure it was him?

161
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,875
Intact and so full of life!

162
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,916
He did a splendid job
at gettin' in my way.

163
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,916
[TYKI]
Oh, boy...

164
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,666
Hey! What cha talkin' about?

165
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,791
[MILLENNIUM EARL] Just how
unreliable Tyki is at his work.

166
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:35,958
Duh.

167
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:38,500
Heh! Mm?

168
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,666
[sniffing]

169
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,958
So Tyki. Did you change
your cigarette brand?

170
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,166
[TYKI]
No. Why are you so interested?

171
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,875
Thinking of taking up smoking?

172
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,208
[ROAD]
No reason.

173
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,250
[ROAD]
Wait a minute.

174
00:10:56,333 --> 00:11:00,208
Lord Millennium. Where's Lero?

175
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:00,833
[chickens clucking]

176
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:03,125
[BOTH]
Uh...

177
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,416
[JASDERO]
Um, Devit.

178
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,458
Is that Cross?

179
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,375
[DEVIT]
Where did he go?!

180
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:22,875
[banging]

181
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:30,250
[TIEDOLL] Altered Akuma, Lenalee
could be the Great Heart,

182
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,041
the Crowned Clown.

183
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:35,833
Okay. Let's see if I'm following
everything we discussed.

184
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:39,625
The goals of the Cross Unit
are to meet up with Marian,

185
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:42,583
and destroy the Akuma
manufacturing plant.

186
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:43,875
Is that correct?

187
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,250
So far.

188
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:47,500
[TIEDOLL] However, my objective
for coming to Japan

189
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,833
is to find new Accommodators.

190
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:52,000
I hate to say this after
we've had the fortune

191
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:56,041
of running into each other,
but, you should know,

192
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:59,791
I have absolutely no intention
of aiding Marian Cross.

193
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:02,583
The man considers everyone
but himself as tools.

194
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:06,166
Puppets to be used
in his machinations.

195
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,208
You were supposed to serve
as his guard but instead he

196
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:14,458
used you and his altered Akuma
as decoys. Pawns in his scheme.

197
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:16,500
You can understand why
I'm quite hesitant

198
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:17,875
to cooperate with the man.

199
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,166
[ALLEN]
I wonder if there's anyone

200
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,125
who doesn't hate my master.

201
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:24,083
If I may, I would like
to propose a suggestion

202
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:25,416
for you and your group.

203
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,416
Go ahead.

204
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,750
I feel your most important
duty at this time

205
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,625
is to leave Japan immediately.

206
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:32,333
[ALLEN]
Huh?

207
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:33,750
You can't be serious.

208
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:36,583
You're telling us to stop
fighting and go back home?

209
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,958
There's a time and place to
strike the Millennium Earl,

210
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:40,958
but it's not here or now.

211
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:42,875
As apostles, your
most important duty

212
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:45,333
at this moment is to stay alive.

213
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:48,250
As of now, the only
Exorcists alive in the world

214
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,458
are Hevlaska at the Order,

215
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:54,750
Socalo, Klaud Nine,
Marian, and lastly,

216
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,500
the nine of us here.

217
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:59,166
There are no more.

218
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:05,708
We can't afford to lose
anymore Exorcists.

219
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:12,250
I feel the best solution in this
situation is to retreat.

220
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:17,375
So the choices are give
up or keep going, right?

221
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:18,583
[exhales]

222
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:20,416
I'm sorry to tell you, General,

223
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,458
but it's not the first
time we've heard this.

224
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:26,250
We were already warned by
a former comrade of ours.

225
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:27,708
You should turn back around,

226
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:30,125
you'll only slow
the General down.

227
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:33,458
Japan is already under
the Earl's control.

228
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:36,791
If you go there,
you'll most likely die.

229
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:39,166
And you know,
we thought about it.

230
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:42,458
Then Sleeping Beauty
here spoke up.

231
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:46,291
Let's move on.
There's no turning back now.

232
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:49,416
It'd be a betrayal to everyone
who sacrificed their life

233
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,500
so we could get this far.
I won't let that happen.

234
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:01,666
[LAVI]
So we made up our minds.

235
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,041
To keep moving forward,

236
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:06,833
no matter how much the odds
were stacked against us.

237
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:11,166
[KRORY cries]
Lavi speaks the truth.

238
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,375
We'll keep going.

239
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,250
We won't give up!

240
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:18,666
Yeah! Count us in!

241
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:22,458
And you share these
sentiments, Allen?

242
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:26,500
I do.

243
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:29,416
Nothing's going to stop
me from moving forward.

244
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,000
[sighs] Very well.

245
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:36,500
If that's the case, I won't
bring up the subject again.

246
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,958
The journey to this
point was perilous.

247
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:43,041
But you should know, only
more hardships await you.

248
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:47,250
A winding path
lined with thorns.

249
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,958
[LAVI sighs]

250
00:14:57,458 --> 00:15:00,083
This is it, Krory.
Won't be long.

251
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,791
Once Lenalee wakes up and
is able to get on her feet,

252
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:05,916
we'll be back on the road again.

253
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,583
Uh? What's the matter?

254
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:10,666
I nearly forgot Lenalee's words.

255
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,583
How could they've slipped
my mind so easily?

256
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:15,291
We can't turn back now,

257
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:18,000
or the lives of everyone
who helped forged this path

258
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,000
will be forfeit.

259
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:24,291
Arystar.

260
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:28,375
[KRORY] And I include Chomesuke
along with them.

261
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:32,791
As do I. If we don't
press onward,

262
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:36,458
we'll never be able to
avenge our lost friends.

263
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:52,000
[ALLEN]
Can you forgive me?

264
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:56,541
I'm sorry for disappearing
so suddenly.

265
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,791
And, also...

266
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,416
[ALLEN]
...failing Suman Dark.

267
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:11,166
[ALLEN]
I couldn't save him...

268
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,083
[gasps]

269
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You're awake!

270
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:24,708
Is that... you?

271
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:28,541
I'm sorry. For everything.

272
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:29,958
[LENALEE]
What?

273
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:35,250
[ALLEN]
I have so much to apologize for.

274
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:36,791
[LENALEE]
There's nothing to forgive.

275
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,666
[ALLEN]
Huh?

276
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,875
[LENALEE]
You're worried about Suman?

277
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,125
[ALLEN gasps]

278
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:44,166
[LENALEE]
Everything's all right.

279
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:47,833
He didn't die in vain.

280
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:51,000
Don't you realize in the
end you saved his heart?

281
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,666
[ALLEN gasps]

282
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,333
It was all because of you.

283
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:59,041
Thank you for rescuing his soul.

284
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,208
Welcome back, Allen.

285
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,416
I missed you.

286
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,875
It's good to be back.

287
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:20,833
And this time, I'm staying.

288
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:27,875
[BOOKMAN] Looks like
you're feeling better.

289
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,083
[LENALEE, ALLEN]
Uh!

290
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,750
What's this? Are those
tears in your eyes?

291
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,791
No! I, I just...

292
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:36,375
I seem to remember you
crying on the ship, Lavi.

293
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:37,958
What?! That never happened!

294
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:40,083
[ALLEN]
Hold up. You were crying, too?

295
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:43,000
[LAVI] Like I already told you,
it never happened!

296
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:45,791
Yeah. You were probably
bawling your eyes out.

297
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:48,458
You weren't even there!
How would you know?!

298
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:49,708
[CHAOZII]
Nice and tight!

299
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:52,833
Got everything packed,
and ready to go!

300
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:54,083
[shattering]

301
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:55,875
[MAOSA] I think you got
a little problem there.

302
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:57,958
[KIE] How did you tie
the sack upside down?

303
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:00,000
[CHAOZII]
Uh? What the heck?

304
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:01,916
Maybe I should have
used a different knot.

305
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,291
[KIE] I don't think your choice
of knot was the problem.

306
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:10,791
[LAVI humming]

307
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:11,750
Lavi.

308
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,833
[LAVI]
Hm? What's up?

309
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:16,375
You told General Tiedoll
you wished to continue

310
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:17,708
on this journey.

311
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:19,833
That you wanted to see it
through until the end.

312
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:22,166
That's right.
What's the problem?

313
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:25,625
Just wanted to know if it was
as the Bookman successor,

314
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:30,250
or rather, if you believe you're
an Exorcist of the Black Order.

315
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:33,416
How many times do I have to
remind you of your place?

316
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,833
I haven't forgotten.

317
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:37,125
You sure do worry
a lot, old man.

318
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:40,291
You ought to learn to
relax once in a while.

319
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:43,333
What do you say we get
back to everyone, huh?

320
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:44,958
[BOOKMAN grunts]

321
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:54,083
[KANDA] You're seriously
gonna go through with this?

322
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,416
[KRORY] Lenalee said
she can move again.

323
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,083
We'll be resuming
our course shortly.

324
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:02,500
[KANDA sighs]
What a bunch of lunatics.

325
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:05,833
Yeah, well, I guess you're all
gonna die somewhere, right?

326
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:09,708
Uh! What's your problem?

327
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:12,375
We won't know for
certain until we try.

328
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:13,416
Wha--?!

329
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,083
[KANDA growls]

330
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:17,666
[ALLEN]
He's right.

331
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,416
Our fates' aren't
written in stone.

332
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,291
[ALLEN grunts]

333
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:26,666
[MIRANDA] Do you want me to
reverse time for you, Chaozii?

334
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,416
[GROUP chattering]

335
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:34,375
[ALLEN] No matter how difficult
the road ahead lies,

336
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,583
I have to keep walking forward.

337
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:39,958
But this time,
I have my friends.

338
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:40,500
--[LENALEE groans]
--[thud]

339
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,291
[ALLEN gasps]

340
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:49,541
Come on... Get a grip, Lenalee.

341
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,333
No. I'm all right.

342
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:57,416
I have to stand on my own.

343
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:03,625
[ALLEN]
Lenalee...

344
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,375
You're not alone.

345
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:06,916
We're all here.

346
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,875
Let's find my master, together.

347
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,333
[LENALEE]
Together.

348
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,958
[gasps]

349
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:31,583
There you are, Lero!

350
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,791
[LENALEE gasping]

351
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:34,791
[LENALEE screams]

352
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:35,958
Lenalee!

353
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:36,666
[gasps]

354
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,416
[KANDA growls]

355
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,916
[gasps]

356
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:20,833
[ALLEN] Without warning, a hole
to another dimension appears.

357
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:24,208
And Lenalee is dragged
through to the other side.

358
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:26,375
And what's that in
the sky above Edo?

359
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:29,541
Some kind of mysterious
glowing object.

360
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:33,666
On the next <i>D.Gray-man</i> :
"A Key and Noah's Doors!"

361
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,916
Bring salvation to this
poor Akuma's soul!

362
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:40,000
Soba noodles again, Kanda?

363
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:40,791
Wrong!

364
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:42,041
What're you eating then?

365
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:44,333
Breakfast, mori soba!
Lunch, zaru soba!

366
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:45,416
And now mori soba!

367
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,333
What?! That's the same
dish every meal!

368
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:48,208
It's not!

369
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:49,458
Soba? No thanks!

370
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:50,583
Yakiniku for me!

371
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:52,666
Um. I think pears
are pretty good.

372
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:53,791
Pudding's my vice!

373
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:55,458
Chocolate cake for the win!

374
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,166
Eliade.
