1
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:41,875
The villagers...

2
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:43,750
They're being attacked...

3
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:46,125
It looks like... Akuma!

4
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:47,666
That was amazing, Mei Ling...

5
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,041
with a power like
yours we'll be able

6
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:51,833
to know in advance when
the Akuma are attacking!

7
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:54,250
Well that's gonna be a pain...

8
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:55,958
We definitely need
to steal the Innocence

9
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:58,625
as soon as possible before
they make a weapon with it.

10
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,375
You see... for my
mistress I can muster

11
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,291
all the strength
I need to defeat you...!

12
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:10,791
I can do anything for her!

13
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,708
Oh, my mistress!

14
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:28,750
Was it you...?

15
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:31,458
Were you the one
that saved me, Madame?

16
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,666
Welcome, Master...

17
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:37,500
The new Innocence appears

18
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,791
to be quite a bother,
doesn't it...?

19
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:42,250
Of course it has
to be destroyed.

20
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:45,791
I know you'll be able to
accomplish it, my dear.

21
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:47,791
Let me give you some help!

22
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,166
Thank you...

23
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,208
I swear to you I'll find a
way to destroy this Innocence.

24
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:02,166
Madame Lulu Bell?

25
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:10,750
My mistress is leaving...

26
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:13,541
She's leaving me behind...

27
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:14,500
It's an order...

28
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,041
From now on wherever I go

29
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:18,833
I'll always want you
to be there with me.

30
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:19,833
Yes, ma'am...

31
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,666
You're very good to me, ma'am...

32
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:29,708
I'll always be happy
to serve you, Princess.

33
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,625
Madame Lulu Bell...

34
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:34,041
I'm coming to help you.

35
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,916
Forgive me, Lulu Bell.

36
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,750
Now that we know
Mei Ling is being targeted,

37
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:03,250
we can't afford to
wait for the Finder.

38
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:08,250
We have to get her to the
Asia Branch, safely and quickly.

39
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,916
Look sharp! Akuma are close.

40
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,666
Yeah, where?

41
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:24,916
Below us!

42
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:37,875
Big Hammer...! Little Hammer...!
Grow, grow, grow!

43
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,000
Well done...!

44
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,458
You saved us, Mei Ling!

45
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:43,375
How do you feel...?

46
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:44,500
Okay?

47
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:47,958
I'm fine.

48
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:50,291
Her gift is a
double-edged sword.

49
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,083
Using her Innocence
like this takes up

50
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,208
a considerable amount of energy.

51
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:55,750
We had better get out of here.

52
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,166
Right.

53
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:05,750
Above us!

54
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,125
Leave it to me!

55
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,166
Look out, there's
more than one of them!

56
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,875
Devouring Flame!

57
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:21,708
Fire Stamp!

58
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,208
They're on both
sides of the bridge!

59
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,166
Wait... The sides
are only decoys...

60
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,916
They'll come from the front!

61
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,291
I'll take care of them!

62
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:53,750
Mei Ling just kept us

63
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:56,250
from walking
right into their trap.

64
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,791
Mei Ling! Don't push yourself!

65
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,083
She's right, you know...

66
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,666
Relax and leave
everything to us.

67
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,958
When I finally
become an Exorcist...

68
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:11,166
I'll have to get used

69
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,208
to fighting much harder
battles than this...

70
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,041
So, I might as well learn now.

71
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,541
We'll be okay if you need
to take a little break...

72
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,833
Allen here can
see the Akuma too.

73
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,958
There are more of them hiding!

74
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,750
Why are they holding back?

75
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,833
What's wrong?

76
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:40,625
What are those bastards up to?

77
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:43,208
Turn right...!
The path is about to explode!

78
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:44,875
Huh?

79
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,666
What the hell?

80
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:00,291
Behind the rocks...

81
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:01,791
There's more of them!

82
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:07,750
Above and below...!

83
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,041
Both at once.

84
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,666
Mei Ling... No!

85
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,000
She exceeded her limit.

86
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:38,708
Everyone!

87
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:48,041
What the heck...?

88
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,375
What's this?

89
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,875
Are they trying
to split us up...?

90
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:55,125
Grow, grow, grow!

91
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,416
What?

92
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:01,750
Lavi...!

93
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:02,833
Krory!

94
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:05,250
I've got it! Go!

95
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:06,500
Be careful!

96
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,125
Take Mei Ling and run!

97
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:09,500
He's right, now's your chance!

98
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,791
Before they realize they've
got the wrong target!

99
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,875
We'll catch up
with you guys later!

100
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:17,291
What are you waiting for?

101
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:22,583
Meet up with us again
as soon as you can!

102
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:23,833
Okay, old geezer.

103
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:24,500
Krory.

104
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:25,750
You ready?

105
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,291
Ready.

106
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:30,833
I'm not sure cornering
us was a mistake.

107
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,250
What do you mean by that?

108
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,625
Despite Mei Ling's
help they were still able

109
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,500
to stop our carriage easily...

110
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,500
We should not
underestimate them...

111
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:41,291
It's obvious they
had a clear battle plan...

112
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:45,416
Hard to believe after all that
they would mistake their target.

113
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,750
If that's true,

114
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,791
then we've just played
right into their hands...

115
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:49,625
Allen...

116
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:50,833
Lenalee.

117
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,333
They're coming!

118
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:16,666
Lenalee!

119
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,000
Who's there?

120
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:35,041
The little girl has
reached her limit...

121
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:36,916
And if she can't
use her power...

122
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,625
Then she won't be
able to stand in my way.

123
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:40,791
It was a trap...!

124
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,458
You knew that she
would read your plans...

125
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:45,333
You toyed with her until she
was too exhausted to resist!

126
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:48,500
There's nothing I won't
do to get that Innocence.

127
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:49,750
You'll never take it from her.

128
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,333
We won't let you!

129
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:54,208
Help me... Lenalee.

130
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:03,791
Lenalee!

131
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:16,333
Now!

132
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:17,541
Lenalee!

133
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,583
Activate!

134
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:32,083
I will not...
let you hurt her.

135
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:34,000
You hear me?

136
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:38,958
I see...

137
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:40,458
Well.

138
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,875
They keep moving to places
it's hard for me to kick!

139
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:08,875
Allen...!

140
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:09,666
No!

141
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,750
I'll give you as much time

142
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,458
as I can to get
Mei Ling out of here...!

143
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,125
Get her safety!

144
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:00,666
Lenalee!

145
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:06,958
I can't wait to see what mistake
you're going to make next.

146
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:12,125
Lenalee!

147
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,333
Allen!

148
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:29,958
Are you okay?

149
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:38,000
Lenalee!

150
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,500
This is just
like the prediction.

151
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:47,000
I can try to stop
it--I have to try.

152
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,541
But I'm not good enough.

153
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,625
I can't even move.

154
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:52,833
I knew there was only one way

155
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:56,125
to protect my friends,
like Lenalee.

156
00:12:56,916 --> 00:13:00,083
So I decided to
become an Exorcist.

157
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,083
But I'm not protecting anyone!

158
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:04,791
All I'm doing is
causing them trouble!

159
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:16,375
Dammit!

160
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:17,083
Yeah...

161
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:18,458
I know what you mean.

162
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:21,125
I can't pierce their shields,
even using my fangs!

163
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,000
I know, they're too
hard for me, too.

164
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,625
Every time I try to
break through this wall,

165
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:26,291
they push me right back.

166
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:28,666
But we have to get
to Allen and the others.

167
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,000
And soon...

168
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,208
Allen, no!

169
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:44,875
Lenalee...

170
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,125
Allen...

171
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,125
This is all my fault!

172
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:52,083
I lost most of the Akuma,

173
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:55,833
but the amount of damage to the
Exorcists made it well worth it.

174
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:59,166
Everything is going
according to plan.

175
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,041
Time to end this.

176
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,250
Lenalee!

177
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,875
That won't help you.

178
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,750
As much as I hate
to cut this short...

179
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,791
the Master is going to
want both of you dead.

180
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,083
Allen, right!

181
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:40,791
Lenalee, up!

182
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,458
I wouldn't move if I were you.

183
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:04,666
Thank god.

184
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,125
Mei Ling!

185
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:08,541
Mei Ling!

186
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:10,750
You saved our lives...

187
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:14,791
You'd already reached your
limit but you still helped us.

188
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,416
Any last words?

189
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,291
None you'll ever hear...

190
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:21,083
It's about time I showed
you my true power.

191
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,291
True power?

192
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:23,666
Lulu Bell!

193
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,875
Lulu Bell! I'm so
glad you're okay!

194
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:38,333
Are you ready to fight?

195
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:39,458
I am!

196
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:41,500
Then attack.

197
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:58,916
Does that sound familiar?

198
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,583
What are you
talking about, Old Man?

199
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:01,958
If they sound the same...

200
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,416
they must be made
from the same material.

201
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,250
If they sound the same...

202
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,041
He's right...!

203
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:07,708
Hey, Krory!

204
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,041
Leave it to me.

205
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:37,166
Anyone who hurts
Lulu Bell must answer to me!

206
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:47,125
In the nick of time.

207
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:48,250
Krory!

208
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:51,041
Take this!

209
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:52,416
Her again?

210
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,041
And she's more powerful
than the last time!

211
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:56,541
Look who's joined forces.

212
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,916
I shouldn't have
given them so much time.

213
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,291
But I can't withdraw now,

214
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,041
I have an order to carry out...

215
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,416
And the Master
won't like it if I fail.

216
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,541
Madame Lulu Bell...!

217
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,916
Stand back!

218
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,625
Understood.

219
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,666
Yes... I will.

220
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:19,291
I will serve Madame Lulu Bell.

221
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:23,708
I will devote myself
to her completely!

222
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:28,833
Everything is for her!

223
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:31,583
Everything is for
Madame Lulu Bell!

224
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,333
What's happening to her?

225
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:34,958
Who knows?

226
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:41,416
She's going after Mei Ling!

227
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,125
Fire Stamp!

228
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:11,083
Lulu Bell!

229
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:12,583
Give that back!

230
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:19,208
Stack back...

231
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:21,166
I don't want you to get hurt!

232
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,083
I'm sorry Lulu Bell...

233
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,833
I hope...

234
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:49,875
that I at least
helped a little bit.

235
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,416
I'm glad!

236
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,083
She couldn't have gotten far...

237
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,708
We have to get Mei Ling's
Innocence back!

238
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:16,958
It's gone...!

239
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,291
It's broken.

240
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,583
Oh, no.

241
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:31,875
Who told you that
you could disappear

242
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:34,041
without my permission?

243
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:41,750
That was excellent
work, Lulu Bell.

244
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,166
Thank you.

245
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,000
But of course, I expect
nothing but the best from you.

246
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:47,875
Let's go somewhere and talk...

247
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:50,583
I have an assignment
that's perfect for you.

248
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:05,208
Please stop.

249
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:06,875
I'm so sorry!

250
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:09,958
I wanted to be an
Exorcist more than anything!

251
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:13,291
I was going to work so hard
to learn how protect people.

252
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,125
I wanted to help you!

253
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,291
You think it's your
fault this happened...

254
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:18,625
But it isn't.

255
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:21,666
I promised that I would
protect you and I failed.

256
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:29,125
There you are!

257
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:30,958
I've been looking for you!

258
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:33,583
I'm here to take the new
Exorcist to the Asia Branch...

259
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:36,333
Do you know if she's
about ready to leave?

260
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,875
What?

261
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,916
Mei Ling's ability
was certainly helpful.

262
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,791
It's a shame it
turned out this way.

263
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:55,916
True...

264
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,166
But still...

265
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,333
At least now she can
go back to her village

266
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:03,833
and her family, and
lead a long, normal life.

267
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:40,000
We arrived in a town

268
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:43,000
where we heard we
could find the Master.

269
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:46,041
You'll never believe
who we found there instead.

270
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:52,291
On the next D. Gray-man:
"Set Sail, to the East."

271
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:56,333
Bring forth salvation to
this tormented Akuma's soul!
