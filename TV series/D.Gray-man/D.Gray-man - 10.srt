1
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:49,750
Oh my God, this has
never happened before.

2
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:52,291
But where did this
monster come from?

3
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:57,833
So you wanted to
speak with us, Road?

4
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:01,125
That is correct...

5
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:04,291
Never go behind my back and
have all the fun without me!

6
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,000
I still don't understand...

7
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:21,625
Why did they stop attacking?

8
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:22,583
Come on, Allen...

9
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:24,583
We have to keep moving...

10
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:26,791
I'm getting worried
about Miranda.

11
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:28,625
Oh... Right.

12
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:32,083
Miranda, Miranda,
she's all bad luck...

13
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:33,875
Full of doom, full of gloom.

14
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:36,250
What a dumb and ugly duck...!

15
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:37,833
Looking for a job today,

16
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:40,958
who cares, you'll
just get chucked!

17
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,083
Miranda, Miranda,
she's all bad luck...

18
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:45,250
Those kids are harsh.

19
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,833
I can see why Miranda's upset.

20
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:55,500
Where did all those
monsters come from?!

21
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:57,916
And the boy...! The boy...!

22
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,750
His hand morphed
into something else...

23
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:02,875
I can't... I can't take it!

24
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,083
NOOO...!

25
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:08,708
How the hell did
you get in here?!

26
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:09,833
Well I...

27
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:12,166
just walked through
the front door...

28
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,000
You did leave it unlocked.

29
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:15,583
Oh right...

30
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,791
Don't you come in here again
without knocking first, got it?!

31
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:19,375
But we did knock
a couple of times...

32
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:21,375
you just didn't
answer the door...

33
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:23,000
We were worried
you might be in trouble

34
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:25,416
so we decided to come in.

35
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:32,250
So... Miranda...

36
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:33,208
Just calm down.

37
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:34,416
We're here to help.

38
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,583
How can I calm down when...

39
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:49,875
That spooked me.

40
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,375
Me too...

41
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:55,333
Is... that key for...
the grandfather clock there?

42
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,083
Yes...

43
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:00,458
I know it's silly...

44
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:03,000
to keep a clock key
around my neck.

45
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:06,583
No, it's not silly at all...

46
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:09,458
It's part of a memory
from your past, isn't it?

47
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:12,291
There are people out
there who struggle

48
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:15,666
in life because they're
no good at anything.

49
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,625
When I was a child,

50
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:22,750
I was always lurking in the
shadows of my classmates.

51
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:25,708
I just seemed to step
behind everyone else.

52
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:29,625
Unfortunately,
the children I thought

53
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:33,583
were my friends
only laughed at me.

54
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,416
Damn it!!!

55
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,208
I...

56
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:55,041
I'm so sorry!

57
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,166
Look...

58
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,083
This isn't working
out as I had hoped.

59
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,208
No, wait, sir.

60
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:01,708
Stop...

61
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:04,458
I need someone I can trust,
someone that's dependable...

62
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,041
I'm sorry...

63
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:11,916
Believe it or not...

64
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,875
No one has ever said
"thank you" to me before...

65
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:17,958
In my whole life I've never
been a help to anyone.

66
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:20,958
All I've ever wanted was for
someone to notice I exist...

67
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,291
which is why my clock represents

68
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:25,250
the greatest moment of my life.

69
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:28,083
I found it on a
particularly bad day.

70
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:33,125
Uhh... hello?

71
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,250
Oh hi...

72
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,000
I like your clock.

73
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,250
That...?

74
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:38,708
It's a piece a junk the
previous owner forgot

75
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:41,041
to haul out of here
before I moved in...

76
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:42,625
The thing doesn't
even work actually...

77
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,291
The darn thing won't wind.

78
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:47,291
You mean it won't wind at all?

79
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,208
Since I won't be
able to sell it...

80
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:52,500
I've been considering
throwing it away.

81
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:53,791
But if you want
to mess with it...

82
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,125
Go ahead and give it a shot...

83
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:59,041
Who knows, you may have
more luck than I've ever had.

84
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:02,708
A useless, broken clock that
no one ever bothered with...

85
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:05,041
It's as if I were
looking into a mirror.

86
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:19,916
My God...! You actually
got it to work!

87
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,291
Why did the clock accept the
key from me and no one else...?

88
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:26,875
And the sound of the
chime was almost happy.

89
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:32,291
It was the first time I ever
felt acknowledged in any way.

90
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,250
That clock is everything.

91
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,708
It means the entire
world to me...

92
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,458
In all the years
I've been alive,

93
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:45,125
it's the only thing that's
actually needed me.

94
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,958
Miranda?

95
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,583
Huh?

96
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:50,833
Don't forget...

97
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:54,083
We also need your help.

98
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,791
You do?

99
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,791
Well, there's really
no other choice...

100
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,291
You're the only
person in this town

101
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:00,541
that is completely unaffected

102
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,875
by the phenomenon
causing the time loop.

103
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,208
In our opinion...

104
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,958
it's due to the correlation
you unwittingly have

105
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,833
with the Innocence found here.

106
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:08,916
Wait, you speak of...

107
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,833
this Innocence...

108
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:13,500
Tell me what it is?

109
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:15,666
It's culled from
the God Crystal...

110
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:19,250
and its power is...
unbelievable.

111
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:22,375
Innocence causes mysterious
phenomenon to occur.

112
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:23,958
The monsters that
attacked us in the pub

113
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:26,250
are known as Akuma,
and they are in search of

114
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,583
Innocence as well,
to use against us.

115
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,791
As Exorcists...

116
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,083
it's our job to...

117
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:33,791
hunt down and
collect Innocence...

118
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:36,625
as well as destroy any
Akuma we run across.

119
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:41,125
Is that the reason why
I've been attacked lately...?

120
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:42,458
Because I don't
think I can help you.

121
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:45,083
I don't even know what
this Innocence looks like!

122
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,500
That's okay...

123
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:48,250
you must have been in
contact with it at some point...

124
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:50,875
That's why we all need
to look for it together.

125
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,250
Don't look at me like that.

126
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,458
That's your job.

127
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm really sorry but I don't
think I can help you...

128
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:59,166
You're the ones with
all the power. Not me.

129
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,416
I'm a weakling.

130
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,666
I'll just hold you back
from saving the town,

131
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,833
just like I've done
since I was a girl!

132
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:06,083
Look...

133
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,166
We'll save you...

134
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,750
and your town,
but without your help,

135
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:11,625
there's nothing we can
do to change anything.

136
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:14,250
I can't do it.

137
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:15,208
It's impossible.

138
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:15,750
Impossible.

139
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:16,958
I can't do it.

140
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:18,125
No way.

141
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,041
Miranda, we can't
do this without you...

142
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,958
Will you help us?

143
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,166
I start out every
day the same way,

144
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,208
by reading the
morning newspaper.

145
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:42,708
Shortly thereafter I hear
my next-door neighbors fight

146
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:45,250
and then I go out
for my morning walk.

147
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,333
During my walk...

148
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:48,875
some children
throw a snake at me...

149
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:52,125
and then I look for
some kind of a job.

150
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,916
The problem is the only
places that are hiring

151
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,833
are businesses I've already
been fired from in the past.

152
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:05,375
So uh... is there
anywhere else you go?

153
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:08,333
Just one... in the old
shopping district.

154
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:21,333
This is the store where
I first saw the clock.

155
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,750
At night I like to go
through this bin of trash

156
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:27,458
and repair whatever I can.

157
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:32,083
I just can't ignore things
that have been abandoned.

158
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,291
It's against my very being.

159
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:42,333
I was hoping to be alerted to
something but I came up empty.

160
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,875
Me too.

161
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:57,833
Just a couple more
seconds until midnight.

162
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,208
Wait, what's going on?

163
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,625
You're going to sleep?

164
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:15,750
That was bizarre.

165
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:32,875
The clocks are
turning backwards.

166
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,541
Grab my hand, Lenalee!

167
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,333
What's happening?

168
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:57,708
It's destroying everything
that happened today.

169
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:04,125
The sun??!!

170
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,125
Oh no...

171
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:14,500
I don't remember
going to bed at all.

172
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,333
That was unbelievable!

173
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:21,125
Just to be clear,
you don't want us

174
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,416
to attack the Exorcists, right?

175
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,000
That's correct...

176
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:28,916
we must hold off on our attack
until they obtain the Innocence.

177
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:37,708
Here you go.

178
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,291
Ahh... It smells great.

179
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:40,500
Lenalee...!

180
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,458
You've got to come
see this, quick!

181
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,708
Pretty neat, huh?

182
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:49,041
I'm a Clock Exorcist!

183
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,250
You okay, Allen...?!

184
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:51,666
How'd you do that?!

185
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,875
Get outta my clock!

186
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:55,000
No no...

187
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:57,666
It's okay... I'm not
even touching it.

188
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:00,500
I'll show you.

189
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:03,125
Watch what happens
when I try to touch it...

190
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:04,291
See?

191
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:05,041
Wow...

192
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,125
It went through.

193
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:07,375
My clock...

194
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:08,458
What I think is...

195
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,333
the clock's being
very selective...

196
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,416
Only Miranda can touch it.

197
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,541
Which means the clock
is most likely activated.

198
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,958
Factoring in the time
re-winding earlier...

199
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,125
the most likely reason

200
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,125
for this phenomenon
has to be Innocence.

201
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,708
Wait, what are you saying...?!

202
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:26,000
That my clock is the one causing
time to reverse in this town?

203
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,125
Yeah.

204
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:29,750
Don't... tell me...

205
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:33,000
That you'll destroy...
my only friend.

206
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:35,291
Easy... now... Miranda.

207
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,416
Think hard okay...?

208
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,750
There has to be a reason why

209
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,875
the clock has chosen
to act this way...

210
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,833
just try to remember...

211
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:46,791
all the way back to the
original October twenty-eighth.

212
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,666
I remember that day
because I had been fired

213
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,666
from my job for the
one-hundredth time.

214
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,541
Losing a job just
once is hard enough,

215
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:00,041
but a hundred times
is downright pathetic,

216
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,583
and that's how I felt.

217
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,750
I don't think I can take
this for much longer...

218
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,291
Think positive...?

219
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:11,041
So, what does that mean?

220
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:14,666
I don't even... care
about my life anymore...

221
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:18,666
I wish tomorrow...
would never come.

222
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:25,083
Hey, that's it!

223
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,625
Yeah, you made a wish...

224
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:29,208
and the Innocence allowed the
clock to make it come true.

225
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:30,625
No way...!

226
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:33,208
I was just depressed and
complaining, nothing more...

227
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:36,500
I don't understand why a clock
would even do that anyway.

228
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:37,625
Miranda...

229
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,291
is it possible that...

230
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:43,291
You're the accommodator
of the Innocence?

231
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:44,250
You think so?

232
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:45,583
Think about it.

233
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,125
If the clock is causing
the time-loop in reaction

234
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:50,416
to Miranda's wish, then it's
possible the two are syncing up.

235
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,291
Then I could have
caused all this?

236
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:54,875
Miranda... See if you can
reason with the clock

237
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,750
and have it stop
reversing time.

238
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,875
Hello my dear.

239
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:02,791
Will you do me a favor and make
time go back to normal again?

240
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,291
It says October twenty-eighth.

241
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,208
Interesting.

242
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,375
Hey, don't worry...

243
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,500
Everything will be
back to normal soon.

244
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:22,333
Well, Miranda... we need
to think up a plan.

245
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:28,416
Come one! Come all...!

246
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,375
The Piter Theater's
new play of horror

247
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,791
"The Pumpkin and the Witch"
opens today...!

248
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:35,375
Who wants to be the
first to get a ticket?

249
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:38,625
Here. Awesome!

250
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:39,625
Do more tricks!

251
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:41,000
Thank you... yes!

252
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:44,000
You're all great...!
Each of you deserves a break!

253
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:47,791
You're doing an excellent job...

254
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:50,333
The tickets are selling
like hot-cakes, I tell ya...

255
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:51,708
Keep this up

256
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,791
and there'll be a full time
position in it for you.

257
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,916
Oh, thank you, sir!

258
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,208
Sure.

259
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:58,375
Great job, Miranda!

260
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,333
I think you really
did it this time!

261
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:01,833
Let's hope...

262
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:04,833
this guy has fired me five
times in the last thirty days.

263
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:06,750
I have a good
feeling about this...

264
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,333
It'll be great if
you get this job.

265
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:10,791
Your outlook on life will
be so much more positive...

266
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:13,083
I guess... we'll see.

267
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:14,166
Oh stop it...

268
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,750
You need to believe in yourself.

269
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,250
Hey guys...

270
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,041
How'd the job interview go?

271
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,250
It went well.

272
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:22,875
She has a chance at
landing a full-time job.

273
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:24,208
That's great!

274
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,458
And there's also been no
sign of Akuma anywhere...

275
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,958
I think it just
may work this time.

276
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,416
I saw that you had an
interesting array

277
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,958
of moves up there, have
you done this stuff before?

278
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,583
I didn't know you
were watching...!

279
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:35,833
I...

280
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:38,916
used to work as a clown
when I was growing up.

281
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:42,416
My foster father was
a traveling entertainer

282
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,916
so he would teach me
all sorts of tricks

283
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,666
to make money on the streets...

284
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,125
Funny thing is I never
would have dreamed

285
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:50,166
in a million years it'd
come handy as an Exorcist.

286
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,791
You've seen a lot more
of the world than I have...

287
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,625
Lucky.

288
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:57,875
Trust me, it wasn't as
glamorous as you may think.

289
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:05,791
So when was it exactly
that you joined the Order?

290
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:06,708
They found me and my brother

291
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,000
when we were very young.

292
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,541
My parents were
killed by an Akuma...

293
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:15,500
So, that left my brother and
I as orphans for a short while.

294
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,416
Then, I was
recruited by the Order

295
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,166
because they discovered
I was the accommodator

296
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,125
for the Dark Boots.

297
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,416
They separated me
from my brother,

298
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,041
the only family I had left,

299
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:28,083
and kept me under constant
watch so I couldn't leave;

300
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,833
that doesn't mean I didn't try.

301
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:31,791
It felt like I was serving
a prison sentence

302
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:33,583
the first few years.

303
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,041
We've got to keep
her restrained...

304
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,750
Her abilities are unknown.

305
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,375
Her life must be cherished.

306
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,875
She's not an experiment.

307
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:44,375
She shall make a
powerful Exorcist.

308
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:49,416
I... want to go... home...

309
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,708
Let me... see my brother.

310
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:54,708
I'm here...

311
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:58,000
We're safe.

312
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,625
I'm sorry I took so
long to get here...

313
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:02,625
It's good to see you...

314
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,000
Brother.

315
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm going to be living
here with you from now on...

316
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:09,291
We can be a family again.

317
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,000
So my brother worked his way
through the ranks to Chief...

318
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:14,291
and moved to Headquarters
to be with me...

319
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:18,041
He's what inspired me to
embrace becoming an Exorcist.

320
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:19,791
Brother and sister, huh...?

321
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:21,541
It's nice.

322
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:22,958
What do you mean?

323
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,791
I guess everyone suffers from
heartache in some way...

324
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,625
I was thinking I was the
only person in the world

325
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:30,875
who dealt with any kind
of misfortune like that.

326
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:34,000
Alright... I'm gonna
head back to work.

327
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:35,208
Sounds good.

328
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:36,041
Hey...!

329
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:36,958
You in the pumpkin head...!

330
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:38,250
Over here!

331
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:41,875
I want to see
"The Pumpkin and the Witch."

332
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:43,625
Where I can get some tickets?

333
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,250
Sure, of course.

334
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,208
The ticket booth is
just over this way.

335
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:47,916
I'll show you.

336
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,666
You numbskull!

337
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,291
You need eyes in the back of
your head to work this job!

338
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,125
I'm so sorry, sir!

339
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,333
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

340
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:58,250
Miranda...

341
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,583
Tell us what happened.

342
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:00,833
Oh, Allen...

343
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:03,208
Somebody bumped into me
and stole all the money!

344
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,041
Did you get a good look
at the pickpockets face?

345
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,666
That's him there!

346
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,166
Lenalee...!

347
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:12,458
Hang tight...

348
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:13,708
We'll catch him.

349
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,500
Be careful.

350
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:18,875
Get out of my sight.

351
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,791
I knew it wouldn't last.
Who am I kidding...

352
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,166
I just knew it...

353
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:38,000
No matter how hard
I try at something I just...

354
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,125
end up an abysmal failure...

355
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,166
I'm so stupid!

356
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,125
Why do all these terrible
things always happen to me...?

357
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,166
All I want is to be normal...

358
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,750
but I can't 'cause
my clock is...

359
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:50,375
made of Innocence.

360
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:55,916
Awww...

361
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,791
Answer a question for me...

362
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,708
Where's your clock hiding...?

363
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:06,333
Oh great...!

364
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,083
It's a trap!

365
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:09,500
We have Miranda...

366
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:10,666
So now...

367
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,875
we'll be taking the
Innocence from you.

368
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:15,000
Yeah, right?

369
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,875
Ice Fire!

370
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:22,291
Everything's frozen!

371
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:24,583
Stay strong Miranda.

372
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:26,791
Allen!

373
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:32,083
Damn...!

374
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,583
I have to focus all
my energy on the Akumas!

375
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:38,208
Pang Voice!

376
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:40,833
Slicing Wind Scythe!

377
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,833
Freeze!

378
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:50,333
Ice Fire!

379
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,041
Allen, no!

380
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,000
Where am I?

381
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:15,416
You're awake.

382
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:18,541
You!

383
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:20,166
Lenalee!

384
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,458
Not anymore...! Road has
made her into her doll.

385
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,041
So you're Road...?

386
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,916
Why can't I see you...

387
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:31,041
I'm not detecting
an Akuma soul...

388
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,666
You're not an Akuma...

389
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:33,500
Tell me...

390
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:34,666
What are you?

391
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,416
I'm just a human being...

392
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,458
Is there something wrong with
a human befriending an Akuma?

393
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:40,791
Yes, there is!

394
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,750
Akuma are weapons created
by the Millennium Earl

395
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,916
in order to murder humans!

396
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,416
Weapons also exist for humans

397
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,625
to kill other humans,
do they not...?

398
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:51,875
The Millennium Earl is our
brother and our savior.

399
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:54,125
You see we are
the chosen ones...

400
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:57,625
the true Apostles that were
hand-picked by God himself.

401
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,083
I am Road...

402
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:01,333
And I am in the family of Noah.

403
00:22:38,916 --> 00:22:41,625
Road's surprise attack
left us outnumbered

404
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:43,708
and in an
vulnerable situation...

405
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:45,958
but a gleam of hope
arrives when Miranda's clock

406
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:48,833
begins casting a
mysterious light.

407
00:22:48,916 --> 00:22:50,583
Next time on D. Gray-man:

408
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:52,541
"Miranda Lotto's Feelings."

409
00:22:52,625 --> 00:22:55,791
Bring forth salvation to this
tormented Akuma's soul.
