1
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:39,791
Kanda's missing?!

2
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:41,208
Innocence was
discovered in ruins

3
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:43,791
just outside the city and
he was sent to collect it.

4
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:45,083
But it's been a week now

5
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:46,750
since we've had any
contact with either Kanda

6
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:48,791
or the Finder that he
took along with him.

7
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:52,625
The man who took her identified
himself as "Vittorio."

8
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:54,250
Vittorio?!

9
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:58,125
The swordfighter that's been
living for a thousand years?!

10
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:20,625
The Innocence is healing him!

11
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:25,708
Oh, no!

12
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:27,541
Kanda!

13
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,291
Kanda!

14
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:37,791
Allen, wait!

15
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:40,166
You shall die with honor...

16
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:01,791
Kanda!

17
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:07,666
There's a pulse...

18
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,125
He's still alive!

19
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:11,333
Of course I am.

20
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,541
You know I don't die easily.

21
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:17,000
I can see that...

22
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:18,541
Kanda!

23
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,875
Allen seems to be holding up
against Vittorio's attacks,

24
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,958
but I don't know for
how much longer...

25
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,375
The Innocence is contained
in Vittorio's sword...

26
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:43,583
It's very deadly...

27
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:45,333
Unfortunately
Anti-Akuma Weapons

28
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:47,375
can only take so much damage.

29
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:49,750
How did he get that sword
in the first place...?

30
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:51,833
Can we somehow get his
weapon away from him...?

31
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:54,208
No, that will do
nothing to stop him...

32
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:55,083
Why?

33
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:56,625
He is...

34
00:03:56,708 --> 00:04:00,083
He's been enslaved by the
Innocence, both body and soul.

35
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:01,375
Enslaved?

36
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:02,416
Yes.

37
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,666
And we have no
idea where Vittorio

38
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,083
could have gained access
to a sword like that...

39
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:08,708
I don't believe he'd physically
be capable of handling the power

40
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,666
of the Innocence
using only his will,

41
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,250
like an Accommodator
would be able to,

42
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,833
so he actually needs that sword.

43
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:17,000
When confronted with
someone of great power,

44
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:19,583
the Innocence in his possession
begins to overcome his will,

45
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:22,250
forcing him to go
beyond his natural limits

46
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:25,083
in order to defeat his enemy.

47
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,083
So the Innocence
is out of control?

48
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,833
Is that why you suppressed your
Innocence while fighting him,

49
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:33,625
Kanda, so you wouldn't
activate Vittorio's?

50
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,208
He can't do it...

51
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,708
Defeating Vittorio
is impossible.

52
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,458
Kanda!

53
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,375
You're bleeding Kanda.

54
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,416
This is no time to be a hero.

55
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,041
Stay here.

56
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,000
Watch him.

57
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:49,458
I will.

58
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,875
Innocence activate!

59
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,791
Lenalee!

60
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,208
I don't fight women...

61
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,166
Now begone.

62
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:47,333
You will die with honor...

63
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:49,000
Stop it!

64
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:59,458
Claudia, its you... wait...

65
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:02,250
Did this man take you hostage?

66
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,166
No one can make me go back...

67
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,166
You can try all you want but
I'm staying right where I am.

68
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,666
Please give a message
to my father and Paletti.

69
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,416
Tell them I will never return.

70
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,458
Wait a minute this isn't...

71
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:21,500
Claudia, come back!

72
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:13,083
I cannot promise this
will cure him, but...

73
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,291
...you may apply it
to his wounds anyway.

74
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:17,000
Thank you, we will...

75
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:20,041
And later, would you
tell them the story?

76
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:22,041
Yes, of course.

77
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,333
How's Allen?

78
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,166
I think he's going to be fine...

79
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,375
He nearly went into shock

80
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,583
when he couldn't move
his arm any longer,

81
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:34,208
but it didn't last long
and he's improving now.

82
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,500
I think the nerves in
his arm were in paralysis,

83
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,125
but it was only temporary.

84
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,083
That's good to hear.

85
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:40,958
Uh Miss...

86
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:41,958
There's a story I think could

87
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:43,541
shed some light on
our situation.

88
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,541
I'd like you and
Allen to hear it.

89
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:46,750
Please.

90
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:52,000
After fighting Vittorio over
the course of several days,

91
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,333
Kanda was facing total
exhaustion and slept

92
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:57,750
in a nearby cottage nestled
at the base of the mountain.

93
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:58,916
While he was resting,

94
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,583
I used those few days
to survey the area

95
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:03,083
and speak to the locals
in hopes of finding

96
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:06,541
any additional information
that could help our situation.

97
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,875
Fortunately, it was in this
search I came across

98
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,416
this elderly woman,

99
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,416
who told me the story
of Sandra and Vittorio.

100
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,750
This story is an ancient
tale that took place

101
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,916
one thousand years ago.

102
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,875
The lord who had rule over
this entire land at the time

103
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,583
had a beautiful
daughter named Sandra.

104
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,000
When she had turned sixteen

105
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,666
great swarms of men
arrived from far away lands

106
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,250
to ask for the princess's
hand in marriage.

107
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,041
However, no matter
how empassioned

108
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:34,791
or noble the numerous
offers of marriage,

109
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,958
Sandra would not accept.

110
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:40,625
I will only be the wife of the
strongest man in the world.

111
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,125
Then, to test their strength,

112
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:45,666
the princess told the men
that they must fight Vittorio,

113
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,958
the sword fighter who had
protected her noble family.

114
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,750
Vittorio fought for her

115
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:53,541
even after the princess
took ill and passed,

116
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,791
and it is said that the
battle cries are still heard

117
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:59,166
one thousand years later...

118
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,166
The Sardini family's residence

119
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,125
is on the same plot of land
Princess Sandra use to live on.

120
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:05,208
I see...

121
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:06,875
So Vittorio's been
defending Claudia

122
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:09,666
because he thinks
that she's the Princess.

123
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,208
Of course...!

124
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:14,375
Every time he defeated an Akuma
going after the Innocence,

125
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:17,708
he would report back to Claudia.

126
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:21,666
The world's strongest man
has yet to appear, my lady.

127
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:25,916
He saw them...

128
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,333
...not as Akuma,

129
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:30,916
but as the men who were
proposing to Princess Sandra.

130
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,500
Let's see it was exactly
one month ago today

131
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:36,666
that Vittorio first appeared
in front of Claudia.

132
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,750
That's around
the same time Akuma

133
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:42,500
began infiltrating the area
surrounding the ruins...

134
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,708
But what was he doing
there up to that point?

135
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:49,791
He probably was using the ruins
as a safe haven to hibernate

136
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:53,583
and to patiently wait for any
opponents he had to battle.

137
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:54,833
What opponents?

138
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:56,125
As long as Vittorio

139
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,333
has the Sword of Innocence
in his possession...

140
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:00,750
Akuma will continue
to appear before him.

141
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,083
Wait, then what about Claudia?

142
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,666
I'm afraid she's
gotten herself involved

143
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,500
in a situation that
has no end in sight...

144
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,083
These destructive
battles will continue

145
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,750
unless we can figure out a
way to solve this problem

146
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,625
before its too late...

147
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:50,875
Are you crazy?

148
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:52,000
Your wounds haven't
even healed yet!

149
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,875
They're healed.

150
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:54,666
Look at that...

151
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,541
They're almost gone...

152
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:02,791
Where do you think you're going?

153
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,166
I'm going to defeat Vittorio,

154
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,875
collect the Innocence
and then be on my way.

155
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:08,333
And how do you
plan to do that...?

156
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:11,166
Every time you cut him with
your Mugen he regenerates.

157
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,666
I'll figure something out.

158
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,125
I've got troubling news...!

159
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:15,958
Multiple Akuma were
just spotted ambushing

160
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:18,625
the ruins again and
are fighting with Vittorio!

161
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,291
Huh?

162
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,500
Stop it Kanda, you haven't
completely recovered...

163
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:28,083
Why don't you rest for another
day and then go back tomorrow.

164
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,125
You know I can't...

165
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,166
You want them to
steal the Innocence

166
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,041
while I'm here taking a nap?

167
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,375
We can hold them back.

168
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:34,708
Oh that's reassuring.

169
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,125
Just believe in us...

170
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:39,416
Lenalee and myself...
and Vittorio.

171
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,833
Vittorio?

172
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:43,541
He won't make it easy for
the Akuma to defeat him...

173
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:44,916
He can't afford to...

174
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,250
That's why the Innocence
will stay in his possession.

175
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,291
You've got a point...

176
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:51,666
If enough Akuma work together

177
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,208
and overwhelm him, then
Claudia will be in danger...

178
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:55,458
Lenalee and I could be there

179
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,791
in a matter of seconds
to protect her safely.

180
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,875
So please, just
stay here and rest.

181
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,250
Try thinking of a strategy

182
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,750
for collecting the Innocence
inside Vittorio's sword.

183
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,083
Try thinking...?

184
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:07,458
Are you giving me orders now?

185
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:10,833
Sorry, Kanda...

186
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,833
But right now your brain is your
best asset, so just use that.

187
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:15,416
Get back here!

188
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,708
Pedro! Keep an eye
on him, will ya?

189
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,333
Of course.

190
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:02,291
I can't believe it, he really
is giving it some thought.

191
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:10,958
Vittorio!

192
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:43,916
Vittorio...!

193
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,250
Please listen to what
I'm about to say...

194
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:48,291
You don't have to
fight any longer.

195
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:51,500
The fact is Princess Sandra
died a very long time ago...

196
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,208
You were never told
and now a thousand years

197
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:55,666
of pointless fighting
has gone by...

198
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:56,958
Do you hear me?

199
00:14:57,041 --> 00:15:00,083
The princess is alive
and it is her wish

200
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:03,291
that I continue to
fight in her honor...

201
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:06,000
It is my duty to
cater to her wishes

202
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:10,208
no matter how
extreme the request.

203
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:13,250
Come.

204
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:14,750
Please, wake up to reality...

205
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,208
There's no one
for you to protect.

206
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,375
Your fight is over!

207
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,125
It's never over!

208
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,166
You loved Princess Sandra.

209
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,958
That's why you don't
want to let her go.

210
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:35,541
No one is faulting you for that!

211
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,208
I serve the princess.

212
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:40,666
I follow the orders that
are given to me, nothing more!

213
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,166
This is a big misunderstanding.

214
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,958
He thinks you're
Princess Sandra...

215
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,250
Please, you've got to help us.

216
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,666
You're the only one
who's able to stop him.

217
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,916
Either do something now
or this will never end...

218
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,208
You'll be stuck
with him forever,

219
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:56,333
now is that what you want?

220
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,541
Maybe it is.

221
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:03,166
Vittorio saved me from
a life I didn't want,

222
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:06,416
where I could no longer make
a single decision on my own...

223
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,916
I felt like a captive.

224
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,750
At first I was scared.

225
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:15,333
He frightened me and I didn't
understand his purpose...

226
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,166
I expected the worst
but all he would do

227
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,500
is report to me and
quietly leave the house.

228
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,500
And then everything
was different...

229
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:23,666
One night he appeared before me

230
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:27,208
in my room and
asked me a question.

231
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,875
Why are you crying, my lady?

232
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:33,375
My father's forcing me
to marry someone I do not love!

233
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:36,333
Vittorio helped me escape
from that horrible situation.

234
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:41,333
Lay down your sword!

235
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:42,916
Why can't you realize
that all of your fighting

236
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,625
just puts Claudia's
life in danger!

237
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:48,416
What keeps Vittorio
alive also attracts Akuma...

238
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,583
You'll never have a chance

239
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:52,791
at a normal life being
anywhere near him!

240
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:06,625
This is what I mean when I say
you're too soft, Short Stack!

241
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:07,458
Kanda...?

242
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:08,916
You're coming with me!

243
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:12,875
I welcome your challenge.

244
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,541
Die!

245
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,458
No!

246
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,750
He refused to give up his sword,

247
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:44,750
so I had to improvise.

248
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,041
Vittorio!

249
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:52,791
I'm afraid... of losing...

250
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:53,833
No...

251
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:56,875
It's something else.
I want to lose.

252
00:18:56,958 --> 00:19:03,333
The day I lose is the day
the pain will finally end.

253
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:05,333
But I... I can't handle it

254
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:08,125
if she becomes wife
with another man...

255
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:11,000
I can't lose...

256
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:16,375
I want to keep winning...
for the rest of eternity.

257
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,500
Vittorio...! Vittorio!!

258
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:32,583
I'm here now...

259
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:35,666
Don't leave me!

260
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,583
I don't want you
to fight anymore...

261
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:41,541
Let's go someplace
quiet, just you and I.

262
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,791
Princess...

263
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,625
I have... a confession.

264
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:52,416
I know you are
not Princess Sandra.

265
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,416
I knew she passed
away centuries ago...

266
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,416
However...

267
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,750
Fighting for you

268
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:06,250
was one of the greatest
honors of my life.

269
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:09,333
All that I ask... is that
you live for yourself

270
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:16,125
just like Sandra did...
so many years ago.

271
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,000
Oh, Vittorio.

272
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:30,708
Vittorio!

273
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:31,875
No!!!

274
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:37,958
Don't leave me!
Please... Wake up, please!

275
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,375
Three days later...

276
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:51,666
Claudia returned to the
Sardini Family's residence...

277
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:55,958
and packed up her belongings
before leaving again.

278
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,458
She chose to decide the course

279
00:20:57,541 --> 00:21:01,916
of her own life in the end...
just as he had wished.

280
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,166
So, apparently Lenalee
is dating Russell

281
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,458
from the Science Division.

282
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:42,833
Can you believe it?

283
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:44,875
As they head into town
looking happy and carefree,

284
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:46,416
they're followed
by you know who...

285
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,750
Mister Paranoid McJealousy!

286
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:50,166
Find out what happens

287
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:53,166
on the next episode of
D. Gray-man: "Lenalee's Love."

288
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:56,208
Bring forth salvation
to poor Komui's soul!
