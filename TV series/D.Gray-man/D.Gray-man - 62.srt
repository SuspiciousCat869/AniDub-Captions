1
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,416
This is the end for you.

00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:59,458
[ESHI] Title: "The Maiden Who
Has Fallen into Darkness."

00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:12,166
[hisses]

4
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:23,250
[ESHI gasping]

5
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:28,291
Wonderful!

6
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:29,875
I can feel it.

7
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:32,416
I can actually feel that
pathetic woman's heartbeat

8
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,250
getting weaker by the second!

9
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,666
And the sound of her heart
squeaking as it's crushed

10
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,666
by the water pressure
is just too much!

11
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,416
Even though I'm a
Level Three Akuma now,

12
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:48,875
I can't descend to the bottom
of the seafloor, but...

13
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:51,083
...this is my masterpiece.

14
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:54,875
I wanted to witness
it with my own eyes!

15
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:57,916
I'll just have to enjoy
seeing the corpses

16
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,875
of her comrades instead!

17
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,583
[gasps]

18
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,208
[ALLEN]
Not again.

19
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:18,666
[ALLEN] It's like a starving
animal searching for its prey.

20
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,541
Maybe it's reacting to an Akuma
somewhere off in the distance.

21
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,166
[ALLEN gasps]

22
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,666
[ALLEN grunts] Ever since it
was revived at Krory Castle,

23
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,875
my left eye's been evolving.

24
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:36,375
I wish it would stop acting up

25
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:40,208
in the middle of
the night like this.

26
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,458
It won't let me get any sleep.

27
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:46,833
It's like it constantly wants
me to go to where Akuma are.

28
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:52,541
[ALLEN] It feels like people
are screaming and writhing

29
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:53,958
throughout my body,

30
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:56,583
like they're packed
in beneath my flesh.

31
00:03:56,666 --> 00:04:00,458
[ALLEN grunting]

32
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:03,708
Like... Fire.

33
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:09,041
And tonight--it's
worse than usual.

34
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,000
[ALLEN yelps]

35
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,083
Hold on, okay?

36
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:24,166
I just can't go right now.

37
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,750
I'm begging you, please,
just leave me alone!

38
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:34,875
[ALLEN] I don't want to
be like this. Please.

39
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:38,083
[LENALEE]
Allen. Are you there?

40
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:41,208
[ALLEN gasps]
Lenalee?

41
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:45,083
Was that...?

42
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:47,791
[ALLEN gasps]

43
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,375
[LENALEE]
Allen...

44
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,791
[ALLEN gasps]

45
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,375
[LENALEE]
Hello?

46
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:23,000
I thought I heard you in here.

47
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:26,833
[ALLEN]
Yeah, it's just me.

48
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:29,666
What are you doing wandering
around at this hour?

49
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,583
Midnight snacks, huh?

50
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,833
I'm not sneaking
food, you silly.

51
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,708
That's something you would do.

52
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:39,208
Anyway, I...

53
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:40,416
[gasps]

54
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,250
Wait, your eye. Did you hurt it?

55
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:45,875
[ALLEN]
Huh? No, it's fine.

56
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:48,083
Actually, it's
never been better!

57
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:49,625
[LENALEE gasps]

58
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:55,583
[ALLEN] I'm all right. You,
uh, should go to bed now.

59
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:57,333
'Kay?

60
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,708
[LENALEE]
Wait!

61
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,250
[LENALEE] I won't look
if you don't want me to.

62
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:28,416
Just please, please don't go
any further into the darkness.

63
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,583
[ALLEN gasps]

64
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:38,708
[ALLEN] Hey, what's this
all about, anyway?

65
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:40,833
What happened?

66
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:44,500
Did you have a scary dream
or something like that?

67
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:49,000
[LENALEE cries]

68
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,375
[ALLEN gasping]

69
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:54,666
[LENALEE sobs]

70
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,083
[BOOKMAN snores]

71
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:59,208
[KRORY]
Oh. Eliade...

72
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:02,375
[ALLEN] You dreamed the
world got destroyed? I...

73
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:04,083
I guess that's about
the scariest dream

74
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,708
someone could have.

75
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:09,000
[LENALEE]
Lately, it's every night.

76
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:13,666
[LENALEE] It's completely
quiet and still, like...

77
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,916
...like everything in the
world's been wiped out.

78
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,208
And, it's always so vivid. It's
just like it's really happening.

79
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:26,250
When I woke up, I didn't
see you anywhere.

80
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:30,000
I had a bad feeling, so
I came looking for you.

81
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:35,541
I'm sorry to bother you,
but I'm glad you're okay.

82
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,541
You worry too much, Lenalee.

83
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,875
I guess.

84
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,750
There's something
I don't get though.

85
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:50,750
Why do you care about all
of us so much anyway?

86
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:54,083
It's just, well, it kinda
seems like the only reason

87
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:59,208
you fight at all is to keep
the rest of us safe.

88
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:02,375
[LENALEE] When you close your
eyes and imagine the world,

89
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:04,291
what do you see?

90
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:05,875
[ALLEN gasps]

91
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:08,708
[LENALEE] In my case,
I don't think about the world

92
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:14,083
in terms of places on a map,
or anything so simple.

93
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:17,291
Ever since I've been
on the battlefield,

94
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:22,125
when I imagine the world,
all I see is my friends.

95
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:24,708
I know it's selfish to think
the people I care about

96
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:27,416
are more important than
the rest of existence.

97
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,583
But still. That's
how I see things.

98
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:34,750
I guess what I'm
trying to say is,

99
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:37,625
that if I ever lost one of
you, it would be just like

100
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:40,750
part of the universe
had been ripped away.

101
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:44,875
[LENALEE]
So even if we save the world,

102
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:50,791
if one of us doesn't make it,
that'll be the end of me.

103
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,000
[LENALEE]
That's why you can't die--

104
00:08:57,083 --> 00:09:00,708
or disappear again.

105
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:05,791
If you do, then I'll... Well...

106
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:16,458
[ESHI]
Not giving in yet?

107
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:21,708
Fine, if you insist. Come on
back up to the surface.

108
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:25,750
I'll just have to make sure you
descend even deeper this time!

109
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:37,708
[LENALEE]
Innocence...

110
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,750
[LENALEE]
...Activate at max power!

111
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:49,375
[LENALEE]
Release!

112
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,333
[LENALEE]
It worked!

113
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:05,041
[LENALEE] Eshi's ability to
control gravity comes from

114
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:06,875
the power of dark matter.

115
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:09,333
Innocence is the complete
opposite of that,

116
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:10,541
so if I can release it,

117
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:13,750
I should be able to
cancel his power out!

118
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:25,500
[LENALEE] Were you as scared
as I am right now Allen?

119
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:30,458
You also forced your Innocence
out while trying to save Suman.

120
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,541
My synchro-rate is 86,

121
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:37,000
and I'm an Equipment
type Exorcist, so...

122
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,958
...if I release it
at max power...

123
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,791
What an entrance!

124
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,875
[inahles]

125
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:55,541
[LENALEE] For the sake of
my world, I can't fail now.

126
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,791
[ESHI grunts]

127
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:06,125
I'm going to defeat you!
So get ready!

128
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,250
[ESHI yelps]

129
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,375
It's all over now!

130
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:13,250
Is that so? Then come
end it, maiden!

131
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,250
[LENALEE yells]

132
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,250
[LENALEE grunting]

133
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:26,500
[ESHI chuckles]
Too bad!

134
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:29,750
[LENALEE groans]

135
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,833
Now say goodbye!

136
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,541
[LENALEE grunting]

00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:58,125

[LENALEE yelps, coughs]

140
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:10,291
[ESHI chuckles] Well, looks like
you're at the end of your rope.

141
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:13,916
All you've been able to do
so far is offset my ability,

142
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,916
and that's it.

143
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,791
[yells]

144
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:25,583
[ESHI chuckles]
I hate to break it to you,

145
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:27,958
but I'm a close-combat type now.

146
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:32,250
Try as you might, you can't
pierce through my body.

147
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,458
You're a close-combat type?

148
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:37,000
Are you telling me that
Level Three Akuma

149
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,708
have different varieties?

150

[coughs]

[ESHI laughing]

152
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:49,041
So, I suppose that means

153
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:53,208
you were made to have
a stronger body

154
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,000
Fair enough.

155
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,875
[ESHI]
Yes, I am.

156
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:06,416
What difference does
that make to you now?

157
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,750
Well...

158
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:14,291
[ESHI]
Huh? What are you doing?

159
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:15,958
[LENALEE] The effects
from that forced release

160
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:20,583
are hitting me even faster
than I expected them to.

161
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,666
I'm beginning to fall apart.

162
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,875
[ESHI]
Hm?

163
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:29,083
Don't abandon all hope yet.

164
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:33,375
It's so much more fun to
kill you when you struggle.

165
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,875
[LENALEE]
But you won't.

166
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,416
[ESHI]
Huh?

167
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,833
Because you are
going to break first.

168
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,791
[KIE, MAOSA, CHAOZII grunt]

169
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,666
[MAOSA, KIE gasp]

170
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:10,791
Huh...?

171
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,708
[LAVI]
You guys okay?

172
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:18,625
[ALL gasp]
It's Lavi! Yes!

173
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,083
[KRORY]
They're not letting up at all.

174
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:26,750
[LAVI]
Yeah, I noticed!

175
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:32,125
Poor Lenalee. I hope she's
all right fighting on her own.

176
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,083
Lavi.

177
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:46,041
[LAVI] For now, let's just
focus on the ship.

178
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,333
She told me to look after it

179
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,333
while she's dealing
with that Level Three.

180
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:53,916
I can't let this thing
get taken down.

181
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,583
If it does, she'll
lose the one place

182
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:58,041
she can still come home to.

183
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:21,875
[ESHI laughs]
Keep struggling, Exorcist!

184
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:24,250
Give me more!

185
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:27,916
Struggle. Struggle.

186
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,333
Struggle. Struggle!

187
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:45,041
Waltz attack. Misty Wind!

188
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,125
[ESHI chuckles]

189
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:52,375
[grunts]

190
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,333
[ESHI]
Huh? Up there?

191
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:09,458
[LENALEE] Falling Kick
Technique. Iron Shackles!

192
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,291
[ESHI]
Pathetic.

193
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:21,000
You're still not strong enough
to pierce through my body.

194
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:26,833
Actually, thanks
to you, now I am.

195
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:31,833
Did she restrain the
power of her Innocence?

196
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,708
[LENALEE] Lavi, I was
planning to apologize

197
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,625
when I got back to the ship.

198
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,125
I know you had a
lot on your mind

199
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:53,333
after what happened to Allen.

200
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:59,041
So it means a lot that you
were so concerned for me.

201
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:01,833
Anita, you loved
those hairclips.

202
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:05,125
I guess I shouldn't have
borrowed them after all.

203
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:12,333
[LENALEE]
And Allen.

204
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:15,541
I've decided to hold on to
the hope that you're alive,

205
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:19,000
and that you'll come back to
everyone as soon as you're able.

206
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:20,666
So...

207
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,791
[LENALEE] ...this is going
to be my final attack.

208
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,125
[ESHI]
Huh?

209
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:38,750
[ESHI grunting]

210
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:42,000
[ESHI] Her gravitational force
just increased by several tons!

211
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:46,000
She must have been storing
up all that damage!

212
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,875
[ESHI grunts]

213
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:56,583
[ESHI]
Look at what you've done to me!

214
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:58,958
How dare you?

215
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,000
[ESHI] She's applying all the
speed and power of a meteor

216
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,958
hurtling from outer space!

217
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:08,250
I'm not sure how much
longer I can hold out.

218
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:11,583
It's too much strength
to fight against!

219
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,250
You do realize the friction

220
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,500
will burn your body
to ashes, don't you?

221
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:18,125
Are you trying to take
me down with you?

222
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:25,166
But, if I can endure this
somehow, I'll have to win!

223
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,833
You're the only one
who's going to die today!

224
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:30,708
You think you can defeat
an Akuma of my caliber?

225
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:33,541
Don't make me laugh! [grunts]

226
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:48,083
[LENALEE gasps]
Anita's hairclip!

227
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:53,000
[LENALEE]
No! I can't lose it!

228
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:58,208
[LENALEE]
It's important to her!

229
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:03,250
I won't let you out
of here alive, Eshi.

230
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:06,708
You're going to
disappear with me!

231
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:11,416
I can survive. Yes, I have to!

232
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,083
[LENALEE]
Be gone!

233
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:17,291
[LENALEE]
Forever!

234
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:27,708
[ESHI] I'm still alive...
I made it through...

235
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:33,500
[ESHI]
I won.

236
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,125
[ESHI]
Title--

237
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:35,375
[LENALEE]
Big brother! [cries]

238
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,625
Komui!

239
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,666
[LENALEE]
I'm sorry...

240
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:34,041
[ALLEN] Still believing that
Lenalee will come back,

241
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:36,416
Lavi and the others put
their lives on the line

242
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,125
trying to protect the ship.

243
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:40,083
But how long can
the team withstand

244
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:44,125
the Akuma's viciously
relentless attacks?

245
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:46,500
On the next. <i>D.Gray-Man</i> :

246
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:50,333
"Ship Stalled, Girl
Remains Absent."

247
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:51,791
Hey!

248
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:53,875
I made one little mistake
at the end of last episode.

249
00:22:53,958 --> 00:22:57,041
That one should say
Short Stack! Got it?
