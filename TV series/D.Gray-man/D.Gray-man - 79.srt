[SKINN] Did you forget?
We're immortal?

[KANDA]
It doesn't make sense!

He shouldn't be in any
condition to fight anymore!

He just keeps repeating them.

How is he still able to stand?

183
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,208
The rage of Noah must be the
only thing keeping him alive.

That bastard! He's about
to fire a big one!

[KANDA grunts]
We're both in bad shape huh.

The Mugen is at its limit.

187
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:06,875
I can't afford another
direct hit from his attack.

00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:11,083
[SKINN] I'll never forgive it!
I'll never forgive.

Mugen!

[KANDA]
Will you hold?

[KANDA grunts]

I'll never forgive...
you Exorcists!

00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,625
[KANDA] He'll destroy the exit.
We have no choice, Mugen!

Sangen Style!

199
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:59,833
[KANDA] Take my life force
and grow strong. Mugen!

even more powerful!

But there's nothing left of him!

coming from?

Never!

The legendary rage of Noah.

I'll never forgive!

We are Noah. Immortal.

You are human. And will die!

Death. I refuse it. Not until...

I'm searching for.

I did it. I did it. I did it.

I did it. I destroyed
his Innocence.

I destroyed it! I broke the
Innocence into pieces!

[laughing continues]

of light nearly hit me.

226
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,833
But what the hell was it?
Not an attack.

227

No way. I destroyed
his Innocence!

Impossible! The light!

232
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:09,291
It's connecting the shattered
pieces of Innocence!

00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,208
Joining them together!

[KANDA] This technique
is called Sangen Style.

It feeds off my life.

I'm not done!
Nothing's finished yet!
