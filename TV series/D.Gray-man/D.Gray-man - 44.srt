1
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:41,791
Lenalee's in pretty bad shape...

2
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:44,083
After she was attacked by
an Akuma she started running

3
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:46,625
a fever that's showing
no signs of letting up.

4
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:48,000
The doctor's done all he can.

5
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:49,708
You're the only one
who can help her now.

6
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:50,958
That's fine.

7
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:52,833
But get her away from
that place immediately.

8
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:53,958
Are you crazy?

9
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:56,208
I can't strain Lenalee
with a trip now.

10
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:58,375
But the two of you
are being targeted.

11
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:02,500
The reason the enemy
used a fake Lenalee

12
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:05,208
was not just an
attempt to defeat you...

13
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,708
Their true objective was
to split the four of you up,

14
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:10,666
which they obviously
succeeded in doing.

15
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,375
It's hard to fathom
Akuma dreaming up

16
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:16,291
such a brilliant strategy...

17
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:18,541
There must be someone
else behind this...

18
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:20,750
And that someone
is very cunning.

19
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:22,125
Clan of Noah?

20
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:23,833
That's who I suspect...

21
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:25,708
Since Miss Lenalee
is immobile right now,

22
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:27,083
they will most likely put

23
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:29,875
all their effort
into targeting you...

24
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:31,958
Tread carefully, Lavi.

25
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,541
You okay back there...

26
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:54,958
I'm fine.

27
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:57,958
Hold on.

28
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:06,291
An Akuma...

29
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:08,875
Just like the old geezer said.

30
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:14,208
I should avoid
confrontation, for her sake...

31
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:20,208
I'm sorry we can't travel
using my Big Hammer.

32
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:23,166
This gorge has too
many twists and turns.

33
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,250
That's okay...

34
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,791
I can manage just fine.

35
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,666
Just let me know if it
gets too hard for you.

36
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,458
This is about the
most indirect way

37
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,208
to get to where we're
meeting Bookman,

38
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:35,833
but safety is most important.

39
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,250
Stay here 'kay...

40
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,000
Get away from me you creep!

41
00:03:55,791 --> 00:04:00,416
Big Hammer, Little Hammer!
Grow, grow, GROW!

42
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:04,583
Hey are you alright?

43
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,958
Ow that thing smashed my nose...

44
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,958
And now my chest is flat too...!

45
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,041
Wait it's always been like that.

46
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,833
Sorry, my mistake.

47
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:13,458
Looks like you're doing fine.

48
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:17,208
Oh, Mister, thank you so
much for saving my life!!

49
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,666
Is there anything at all
I can do to repay you...?

50
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:24,291
Thanks to you my life, my nose,
and my chest are all okay!

51
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,791
You wanna go with us?

52
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,291
Yeah!

53
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,041
I've always heard its more
fun to have a travel companion!

54
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:32,708
Besides we're going
the same direction

55
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:34,291
'till we exit the gorge...

56
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,291
Come on, my name's
Mimi and I'm harmless.

57
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:37,416
Whaddaya say?

58
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,875
No, absolutely not...

59
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:41,458
Going with us will get
you into more trouble.

60
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:43,333
But I'm scared and fragile...

61
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,291
I have to run an errand
in the town up ahead

62
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:47,166
and I don't want
to go by myself...

63
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,791
Please sir, I need
you to protect me...

64
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:52,541
She obviously won't
take no for an answer...

65
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,375
What harm could it do?

66
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:55,625
Fine then...

67
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:58,000
But once we leave this
gorge we'll separate.

68
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:00,208
Oh thank you, thank you...!

69
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:01,541
As a maid I'll devote myself

70
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:06,291
with all my heart, nose,
and chest in serving you!

71
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,083
Hey... Easy.

72
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,041
Piece of cake.

73
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,833
I was able to infiltrate them
by sacrificing only one Akuma.

74
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:16,166
Everything's going exactly
to Lulu Bell's plan.

75
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,375
We were finally able to
weaken one of the Exorcists.

76
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:24,833
Perhaps it would be smart
to take care of her first.

77
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:28,625
If we kill the weak one first,
the other would be on his guard.

78
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:30,208
The longer she's
alive the more of

79
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:33,208
a hindrance she'll be,
making them both easy prey.

80
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,541
Oh I see...

81
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,250
But how is that so...?

82
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:39,125
Fighting just one
Exorcist is really hard.

83
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,708
Then make it so that
they are unable to fight.

84
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,125
Of course...

85
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,875
We're going to steal their
Innocence, aren't we...?!

86
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:47,333
Hah... Good thinkin' Lulu Bell!

87
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,458
Can I help?

88
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:56,708
I can carry a bag for you!

89
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:59,000
Thanks but I think
we can manage just fine.

90
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,208
Oh don't be silly...

91
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,625
Here, I'll fan for you,
how 'bout that?

92
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:04,791
Lenalee could use
it more than me.

93
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:08,333
Okay!

94
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:09,666
Thank you.

95
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,125
I don't mean to pry but
you don't look so well...

96
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,333
Maybe it would be best

97
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:14,958
if we all stopped here
and took a break...

98
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,125
No, I'll be alright.

99
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,791
Let's take a minute here...

100
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:29,750
Tip toe...

101
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:34,166
Tippy toe...

102
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,208
What are you doing...

103
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:36,458
I just...

104
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,375
I just wanted to get
my handkerchief wet...

105
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:41,208
I'm sorry I guess
I shouldn't have done that.

106
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:43,750
Trust me...
Not as sorry as I am.

107
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:47,250
It's not gonna be
as easy as I'd hoped.

108
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:55,541
I slipped and now I'm all wet!

109
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,666
Geez... be careful.

110
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:11,083
Lulu Bell! I did it! I did it!

111
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,583
Aw man, I'm soaking wet.

112
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,583
Time for a change of plans.

113
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:28,416
Hey Mister Lavi, I got
some dinner up for you...

114
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,125
I didn't ask for any.

115
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:31,375
Believe it or not,

116
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:33,458
this is my first attempt
at cooking for a man.

117
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:34,125
Huh?

118
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:37,333
You know how this works.

119
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:38,708
First I cook for you
and then we're dating

120
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:42,166
and then before you know
it we're married with kids.

121
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,750
Now what in the world
would I do if that happened?

122
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,083
It won't happen.

123
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:49,416
Please eat it, for our
future kid's sake!

124
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,833
I've totally got his guard down!

125
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,083
Now!

126
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,416
Extend!

127
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:01,666
Oh no!

128
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:07,875
This time for sure!

129
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,458
What is it this time?

130
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:10,833
I was trying to pick a flower

131
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:12,708
for your sick friend but
as soon as I grabbed it

132
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:15,625
I lost my footing and
now I can't get down!

133
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,375
You're unbelievable...

134
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:18,500
I'll be right there.

135
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:19,750
He fell for it!

136
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,250
The moment he reaches
me on the handle

137
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:24,166
of his hammer I'll jump off
and steal his Innocence!

138
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,791
Yeah...

139
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:33,250
Extend!

140
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:34,125
No...

141
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:37,750
How can this be happening to me?

142
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,125
I failed again...

143
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,583
If I had known it
would be this difficult

144
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:43,916
I would've asked
Lulu Bell for advice.

145
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,875
Come on, now's not the time
to get down on yourself, Mimi...

146
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:50,708
I'm gonna have to find
a way to make this work!

147
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,708
Just you wait and
see, Lulu Bell...!

148
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:54,375
I'm doing this all for you!

149
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:56,416
To make you smile!

150
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,666
Even though she's been resting

151
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,833
all this time her
fever has gotten worse

152
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:13,041
and she's showing no
signs of improvement.

153
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,125
Here's some water.

154
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:17,375
Thanks...

155
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:21,958
I wonder if Allen and
Krory are doing okay.

156
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,416
Huh?

157
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,916
If only I had been a little
more careful out there...

158
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,208
I would've never
been dragged away

159
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:30,333
by that Akuma and
we'd all still be together.

160
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:31,916
Lavi...

161
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,250
I know that I must have caused
you quite a bit of trouble...

162
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,500
I can't tell you
how sorry I am...

163
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:37,708
No...

164
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,208
Don't waste your energy
worrying about them,

165
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:41,916
I'm sure they're doing fine.

166
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,708
Seriously...

167
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,291
If I become any more of a burden

168
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,291
to you just leave
me here and go...

169
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:48,708
I don't wanna hold you back.

170
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,833
Even if I had to die...

171
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:59,541
Promise me that you
won't be sad okay...

172
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:05,541
I'm going to take
you to Bookman, okay...

173
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,041
No matter what happens...

174
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:12,625
I won't leave you.

175
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:15,500
Look I don't want
to lose you, not ever.

176
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,083
I won't leave your side.

177
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:20,750
No matter what it
takes, I will save you.

178
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:25,458
Lavi.

179
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,916
She's asking you
to leave her here,

180
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,458
so why not obey her wishes?

181
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,041
There's no point in
going through the trouble

182
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:36,041
of taking her when she
doesn't want to be taken...

183
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,833
Being kind in the
face of adversity

184
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:40,916
doesn't always benefit
others, you know.

185
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,791
Mimi.

186
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,750
Oh, please forgive me!

187
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:47,833
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have said all that...

188
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:48,958
I must be getting tired!

189
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,958
I think I'll go rinse my face!

190
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:06,583
I wonder why
I feel so irritated.

191
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:28,500
Once upon a time in
a land far from here,

192
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,750
there lived a
beautiful princess...

193
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:34,208
The princess trusted her maid
more than anyone in the world...

194
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:37,833
so much so that she would
ask her opinion on everything.

195
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:40,708
The maid was loyal and
served the princess well,

196
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:44,458
living up to that level
of trust between them.

197
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:48,125
But one day, the maid
suddenly died of an illness...

198
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,250
So the saddened and
distraught princess

199
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:53,166
signed a contract with me,
the Millennium Earl,

200
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:57,458
to bring her reliant
friend back to life.

201
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:04,458
Kill her and wear
her body as your own!

202
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:11,041
The maid regained her
life by killing the princess

203
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:14,041
and taking on her skin,
wearing it with pride

204
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:17,458
as if it were a brand new dress.

205
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:21,541
Once upon a time in
a land far from here,

206
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,833
there lived a
beautiful princess.

207
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:26,500
And within her body lies
the soul of her maid

208
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:29,541
where they both live
in glorious harmony...

209
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:32,041
...as an Akuma.

210
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:43,416
Was that... me...?
I don't get it...!

211
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,250
Why can't I remember anything?!

212
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,291
That's not important now...

213
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,291
She's all that matters...

214
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,916
Madame Lulu Bell.

215
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:27,166
The days when
I would kill humans

216
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:31,041
in monotonous repetition
changed when I met Lulu Bell.

217
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:33,625
Sure, all she wanted
was for someone

218
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:36,833
to tend to her fingernails
at her beck and call...

219
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:40,416
but the idea of a person
wanting me to serve them...

220
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,166
of someone needing me...

221
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,833
made me feel good.

222
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,333
From that moment on,
I decided to devote myself

223
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:51,958
to being Lulu Bell's
personal maid...

224
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:55,250
And all this time I've
never once seen her smile.

225
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:59,583
That's why  I'm determined
to make this plan succeed...

226
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:02,083
I have to make her happy...

227
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:14,416
I'm sorry.

228
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,916
It's no sweat...

229
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,750
It's a lot better than carrying
the old panda on my back.

230
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,208
Her breathing's
become more shallow

231
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:22,083
and her pulse is weakening.

232
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,500
I better pick up the pace.

233
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,250
It looks like
it's about to rain.

234
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:45,625
Rainwater's leaking
from the wall.

235
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:48,125
Soil must be weak here.

236
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:50,666
Mimi! Run!

237
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,416
We have to hurry!

238
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,416
Lavi...

239
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,833
Just go on without me.

240
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:36,875
Lenalee!

241
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:38,583
Are you okay?

242
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:39,541
Don't worry about me...

243
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,416
Just hang in there...

244
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:46,500
Mimi!

245
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,458
Looks like someone
lost his Innocence!

246
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,208
So you are my enemy?!

247
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:51,791
You should be careful...

248
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:53,666
Letting your guard down
when you're tired...

249
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:57,625
Catch!

250
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,333
Too bad for you...

251
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:02,958
Your Innocence will
now be destroyed

252
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:05,208
by the one and only Lulu Bell.

253
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:06,458
Noah!

254
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,541
Now... it's time for the
maid to clean up the mess.

255
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:14,541
These fans are very efficient
at cutting, you know.

256
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,083
It's useless to run!

257
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:20,166
There's no escaping my fans!

258
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,416
All I want is to see Lulu
Bell smile just one time...

259
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,416
That can only
happen if you die!!

260
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:44,875
Lavi.

261
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,625
Please save yourself...

262
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:47,958
For me...

263
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,125
Just go...

264
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,583
I couldn't live with myself
if you died 'cause of me.

265
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:53,625
No way.

266
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,625
Resisting won't
do you any good...!

267
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:58,333
You're both going to die no
matter what you try to pull!

268
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,291
Why does this feel so wrong?

269
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:09,000
Don't worry Mimi, this feeling

270
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:12,750
will be gone as soon as
you kill these Exorcists!

271
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:27,250
Innocence activate.

272
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:37,291
Clean up is complete...

273
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:38,708
I'm sure Madame Lulu Bell

274
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,916
will be more than
pleased with these results.

275
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:47,916
So tell me how does it feel

276
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,458
to be attacked by
your very own weapon?

277
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:00,166
How'd you get above me?!

278
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,708
You used her innocence.

279
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:09,916
I can't believe she still
had enough energy to do that.

280
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:14,625
Your luck has now
run out Exorcists!

281
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,333
Prepare to die.

282
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:29,875
Bookman!

283
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:30,916
How dare you?!

284
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,833
I almost had them!!

285
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:37,666
Shame on you for falling
into the enemy's trap.

286
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,833
I need to treat her immediately.

287
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:41,833
You can settle this, right?

288
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:43,708
My hammer...

289
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,250
Consider yourself
lucky that I happened

290
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:48,541
to run into the Akuma
who was holding it.

291
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:50,875
You can lecture me later, panda!

292
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,750
Stamp! Fire circle!

293
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:14,625
Finish her.

294
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:18,083
I let her get away.

295
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:32,333
I can't believe I failed...
and I was so close too...

296
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:33,916
Oh, this is horrible...

297
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,250
I guess I'll have to wait longer
to see Madame Lulu Bell smile.

298
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,666
I'm done with the treatment.

299
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,416
Now we must wait for your energy

300
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,541
to come back, Miss Lenalee.

301
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:49,458
Thank you for saving me.

302
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:50,333
Geezer...

303
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:51,416
Watch her, okay...

304
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,625
I need to go lie
down for a bit...

305
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:57,666
Lavi.

306
00:19:58,333 --> 00:19:59,958
Thank you for not
leaving me behind.

307
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,875
I really appreciate it.

308
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:09,041
Trying to act all macho,
it's pathetic really.

309
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,250
It's okay...

310
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:13,041
I just wanted him to
know how grateful I am.

311
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:19,625
That's great!

312
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:22,541
Lenalee and Lavi are
going to be alright?

313
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:23,875
Since the Akuma went

314
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:25,541
and destroyed the bridge
we were trying to cross...

315
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:28,083
Krory and I had to take
the long way around.

316
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:31,375
So... where exactly are
we meeting up with them?

317
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,750
I am so sorry Lulu Bell.

318
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:40,666
So... are you...
going to uh... fire me?!

319
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:46,666
I deserve my punishment.

320
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,083
Madame Lulu Bell...

321
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,458
Does this mean
I'm still your maid

322
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,541
and you're not
going to fire me?!

323
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:54,916
It takes a lot of
time and effort

324
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,916
to find a maid who is
willing to tend to my nails.

325
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,125
I'm going to make your nails

326
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:02,250
shine like the stars
in the sky, I promise!

327
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:41,500
Kanda and the others
arrive at an old house

328
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:44,041
where Akuma hide
in the shadows...

329
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:48,041
However, countless traps
lie in wait for the Exorcists...

330
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:52,666
On the next episode of
D. Gray-man: "Strange Mansion."

331
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:56,416
Bring forth salvation to
this tormented Akuma's soul.
