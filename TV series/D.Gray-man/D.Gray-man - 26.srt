1
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:46,250
So that's him.

2
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:47,541
I'm disappointed.

3
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:49,625
He doesn't look like
very much fun, does he...?

4
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:52,291
Well it's about time we
got on with the show, Tyki.

5
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:55,250
Bang!

6
00:01:58,041 --> 00:02:00,250
Tell me, what do you
think of the young boy?

7
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:01,583
He has been given a heavy burden

8
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:03,458
to bear for someone his age

9
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:05,333
and he does his
best to handle it...

10
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:06,583
I would relish the opportunity

11
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:09,333
to have a longer
discussion with him sometime.

12
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:10,666
He's an interesting boy.

13
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,000
With how young he is,

14
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:14,125
I sure hope the Order will
be a good home for him.

15
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:15,458
You know it's
been quite some time

16
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:16,833
since we were at the Order.

17
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:18,000
Yes...

18
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:19,791
Maybe we'll pay a visit one day.

19
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:21,125
That'd be nice...

20
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,666
After we're finished...
of course.

21
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,291
It's raining.

22
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:34,291
What? It's cancelled?

23
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:35,625
Due to inclement weather

24
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:38,291
every sea voyage
is now postponed.

25
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,333
Allen!

26
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,791
Lenalee!

27
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,250
This weather's getting nasty.

28
00:02:58,333 --> 00:02:59,833
No kidding.

29
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,458
There isn't a
major waterway linking

30
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,625
this town to anywhere
near the Order...

31
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:05,250
Guess we'll just have to wait.

32
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:06,458
Oh well.

33
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:07,916
So I went over to Spain recently

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,666
to collect some Innocence but

35
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,750
turns out it wasn't there...

36
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,083
What about you...?

37
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:15,708
Tell me all about your
visit with General Yeegar.

38
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,166
He's a very nice man...

39
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,833
He really affected me
when he encouraged me

40
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,166
like I was his student...

41
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,541
It sure did mean a lot.

42
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:23,750
This really brings back memories

43
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:25,958
from the time I spent
with the general...

44
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:27,625
He taught me a lot.

45
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:28,791
I think he could always return

46
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,875
to teaching if this
didn't work out.

47
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,833
I'd like to visit him again.

48
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,625
I am chilled to the bone...

49
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:41,375
Hope I didn't catch a cold.

50
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:42,416
Chief Komui?

51
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,041
I need approval on these notes.

52
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,333
Oh stop it...!

53
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:47,000
Doesn't anyone care about me...?

54
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:50,166
You people are a
horde of slave drivers!

55
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:52,458
Yes?

56
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:53,708
It's Kanda.

57
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:59,166
I was successful in
collecting the Innocence.

58
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,291
That's excellent!

59
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:01,458
Thank you!

60
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,833
So, how is Copenhagen
this time of year?

61
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,250
Is the ocean pretty?

62
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,000
I've heard the scenery
alone is to die for!

63
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,416
I'm so jealous of you!

64
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,083
I feel like a prince who
is imprisoned in his own...

65
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,583
The Millennium Earl
left me a message

66
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,583
that is borderline insane.

67
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,833
He said the real
game begins now.

68
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,208
Hello!

69
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,166
Your time has come...

70
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,541
The seven thousand year
prologue has finally ended,

71
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,416
and the play is about to begin.

72
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,958
Don't miss the rising
of the curtain...!

73
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:34,583
For you are the actors...
the Exorcists!

74
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,250
What's that mean?

75
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:41,958
Hey Chief...!

76
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:43,666
It's a call from an
contact in Austria,

77
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,000
he received a
message from the Earl,

78
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,958
and its exactly
what Kanda's said.

79
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,166
Same here...

80
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,916
Our Exorcist in Hungary
is reporting it too.

81
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,708
Oh my.

82
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,125
What's wrong?

83
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:12,750
General!

84
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,500
State your name.

85
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:24,625
I am Road Kamelot.

86
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,416
And I am Tyki Mikk.

87
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,208
General Yeegar...

88
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,375
We would like you to give us

89
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,666
the Innocence you
happen to be carrying...

90
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,916
It might be in
your best interest

91
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,208
to give us your own
Innocence as well.

92
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,541
Do you really
believe I would agree

93
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:44,041
to your demands that easily?

94
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:46,333
Tell me, didn't
you used to teach?

95
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:49,916
I learned something interesting
in school yesterday...

96
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,583
Belgium's language originates...

97
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:54,541
from the ancient
Celtic language of Belgae.

98
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:57,416
The true meaning of the
word Belgae is warrior.

99
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,708
So you did know!

100
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,333
I was just testing you,
Mister Teacher.

101
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:02,916
I must warn you
we're accompanied

102
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,916
by a powerful group of Akuma...

103
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,833
But it'd be boring if
they won quickly so please,

104
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:11,041
entertain me by putting
up a little bit of a fight.

105
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:13,458
Thierry... Pierre... Verne, go.

106
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:14,291
Sir.

107
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,958
Move to the left...

108
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,916
I'll open up that flank
so you can escape.

109
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,791
You sure?

110
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm sure. We're outnumbered.

111
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:23,083
I can't hold them off
and protect you both.

112
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:23,708
But wait...

113
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,000
That's an order...

114
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:27,375
Notify headquarters
of this immediately.

115
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:30,166
Go... Now!

116
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:54,708
Oh wow...! I gotta say,
that was pretty cool!

117
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:56,666
General!

118
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,583
No escape...! Get them!

119
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,916
I hold the Innocence!

120
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,583
I am the one you seek!

121
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:03,291
What?

122
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:04,791
There it is...

123
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:07,375
General!

124
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:08,625
Get out of here!

125
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,833
I'll catch up with you!

126
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:23,416
Damn you...

127
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,541
I'm an Exorcist...

128
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,250
It is my duty to
ensure that none of you

129
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,958
are killed by Akuma
now let me do my job!

130
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:30,500
Go and do your job

131
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:33,625
and quit wasting what time we
have, get word to The Order!

132
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:36,791
We understand.

133
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,583
And good luck to you General.

134
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:46,541
I'll hold them off until
Headquarters can send backup...

135
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,166
I'll stand firm!

136
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:54,333
Did you know stubbornness
can be a fatal flaw, General?

137
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:57,083
Hurry...!

138
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,000
We have to notify Headquarters!

139
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,166
Chief!

140
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,208
It's General Yeegar's men!

141
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:09,375
And he's under attack!

142
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,416
Send help immediately!

143
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,791
The enemy is closing in.

144
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:16,166
Two people who may be
from the Clan of Noah

145
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,250
and a dozen or so Akuma
hijacked his carriage.

146
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,708
Confirm their location.

147
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:21,583
Right.

148
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,250
Notify all of the Exorcists...

149
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,083
Tell them General
Yeegar's under attack

150
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:26,541
from the Clan of Noah...

151
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:29,375
Anyone within the vicinity
should report there at once.

152
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,041
Right.

153
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:43,750
Full now?

154
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:46,458
Oh yeah!

155
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:50,750
Emergency dispatch...?
Let's hear it.

156
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:58,250
This is Headquarters!

157
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,083
General Yeegar is under
attack by the Clan of Noah!

158
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:01,458
He needs backup!

159
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,958
General.

160
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:38,875
Nice...

161
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:42,166
The old man's tougher
than I thought he'd be.

162
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:52,291
I pray... that these
souls may find salvation.

163
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:01,666
Well done.

164
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,833
I'd expect nothing
less from a General.

165
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:05,708
Are you ready to meet your end?

166
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:08,541
You're pitiful.

167
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,791
You should resist the
urge towards violence,

168
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,583
not embrace it!

169
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:26,083
You should live as you were
created, as a human being!

170
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:38,958
Not bad.

171
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:40,541
Ugh...

172
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:42,875
Looks like we're gonna have to
get our hands dirty after all.

173
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,583
You're from the Clan of Noah...

174
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:47,208
Right...? I've heard
you people are human

175
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,708
even though you surround
yourselves with Akuma...

176
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:53,208
So what made your clan bow
down to the Millennium Earl?

177
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,458
We're not bowing down to anyone.

178
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:57,500
And we are anything but human.

179
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,416
We are super-human...

180
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,958
We inherited the genes of Noah,
mankind's oldest Apostle.

181
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:04,541
Super-human?

182
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:07,208
We find you lesser
species to be deplorable

183
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,375
and will see to your
extinction soon enough...

184
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,125
It's only a matter of time.

185
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,458
You remind me of a student
I had many years ago

186
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:15,916
who would talk in the same
disrespectful manner...

187
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,166
Her youth blinded her

188
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,500
from the arrogance that
led to her downfall.

189
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:24,958
Lero...

190
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:27,250
Lero, I can't breathe!

191
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,833
Lero!

192
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,250
Lero!!!

193
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:34,583
Old coot...!

194
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:41,083
You seem to prefer
living in the past...

195
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:44,458
So I'm going to allow you to
see your students once again.

196
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:05,041
Mister!

197
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,125
Yeegar!

198
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,291
Mister Yeegar!

199
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:12,833
What is this?

200
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,291
And now,

201
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:19,583
meet your student
who became an Akuma.

202
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,833
Joanne!

203
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,291
Feeling better now Joanne?

204
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,125
Hey Joanne, you
look a little pale.

205
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,083
That's okay.

206
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,583
We'll help cheer you up!

207
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,208
Now you are an
Exorcist, right...?

208
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:44,250
Shouldn't you be
slaying the Akuma?

209
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:51,708
No...

210
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,250
They were just innocent
school children...

211
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,458
It's too bad you weren't
this strong back then.

212
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,708
Otherwise you could
have saved them.

213
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:12,750
Feeling better now Joanne?

214
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,375
Stop this!

215
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:29,375
Mister Yeegar.

216
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,125
I beg you!

217
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:08,125
Stop...

218
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:09,625
Leave them alone!

219
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,625
Then hand over the Innocence.

220
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:14,000
You know I can't do that!

221
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:18,000
Just give it to me and
I'll let you out of here.

this time, my students?

238

Are you two finally done?

239
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:34,750
Ah, that's too bad...

240
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,916

Here.

00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,625
Not bad distance,
but that wasn't it.

245
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:57,416
Great so after all
that work we end up

246
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,333
with a handful of junk.

247
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:04,041
The old man's still alive.

248
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,625
Wouldn't it be ironic
if the General here

249
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:09,666
were bound by his own chains?

250
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,250

255
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,875
It's bad.

256
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,500
How could this happen?

257
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:50,541
General Yeegar?

258
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:05,708

Among the Innocence
we are searching

for is a piece that holds
special significance...

270
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:51,291
Its power is so great...

271
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,000
We call it the Heart.

The Heart...

of Innocence on the Earth.

275
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:03,958
It also has the ability to
render every piece useless.

276
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,625
We must obtain the Heart...

277

At whatever cost it takes...

278
