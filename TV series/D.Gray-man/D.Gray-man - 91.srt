Allen's hit!

Lavi!

7
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:07,666
He got both of them!

00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,916
He's behind you!

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,291
What?

00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:16,708
[ALLEN]
Clown Belt activate!

11
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:19,208
Getting confused?

12
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:21,541
I'm the one you're
supposed to be fighting.

13
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:24,083
That's why you're
here, isn't it?

14
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:27,833
For me. I'm the one
you wanna kill, right?

15
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,958
Getting careless or did
you forget? I'm still here!

Is that it?

00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,666
We may not get out
of here alive,

20
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,875
and this may be my last battle,

21
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:02,500
but I'll keep fighting
until my final breath!

22
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:05,125
That's the promise
I made with Mana!

00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:32,125
[SKULL A]
I knew it.

24
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:36,458
You aren't one of the Skulls
our Master made, are you?

25
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:04,166
Interesting. So this must be the
egg you guys have been guarding.

26
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:08,208
That depends. Who're you?

You're just wasting your time!

31
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:25,375
It's impossible for
you to get close!

32
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,666
It's a barrier spell.

33
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,750
You fool! Did you forget?

34
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:35,250
My Master, the illustrious
Millennium Earl,

35
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:38,250
has been a sorcerer
since the ancient times.

36
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:41,625
And only a sorcerer
can remove a spell.

37
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:45,500
Even Innocence is
powerless against it!

38
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:48,541
I see straight through
that disguise of yours.

39
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,500
Sadly, you're too late!

40
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:51,833
Because in mere moments,

41
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,666
this place will be
moved to the new Ark.

42
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,791
[SKULL]
A lecture on spells?

43
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:01,833
What good is that to a sorcerer?

44
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:50,875
Allen!

He's too powerful!

49
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,666
Oh, you think that's all
it takes to stop me?

50
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:38,916
You wish. This isn't over Tyki.

51
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,166
That's right. Bring it on.

52
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:47,000

Okay. Let me keep him busy.

So I've caught myself
a filthy little scoundrel.

65
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:14,583
I was hoping you'd look at
least slightly better by now.

66
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,708
You're disgusting!

67
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:20,458
You haven't changed since
the day I took you in.

Stupid kid.

00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,708
Wait a second.

70
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:31,875
That's the Anti-Akuma
weapon, Grave of Maria.

00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,708
[ALLEN]
That means...

72
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:42,083
Uh. Hi again. Long time no see.

73
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:45,625
Listen, boy. Stop smiling at me.

74
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:50,958
Or I'll drop you.

Agh, that hurt.

78
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,416
No way.

79
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:16,791
Do you... know this guy?

80
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:20,541
It's him. General Cross.

81
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,750

you look disgraceful.

00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:04,791
Uh. O-Okay. Thanks for--

[CROSS] No apprentice of
mine looks like that!

And you. You might
as well join him.

94
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:25,875
I only allow clean, attractive
people to fight at my side,

95
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,375
and you two don't make the cut!

Wow, tell us how
you really feel.

[CROSS]
The Noah Clan, huh?

98
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,208
I wondered what could
possibly be so important

99
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,083
that you would be willing
to stay here and fight

100
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,166
aboard this crumbling ship.

101
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,458
I bet you've gone
insane, haven't you?

00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:53,458
[MONSTER TYKI]
Exorcists.

103
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:58,000
The Noahs have control of you,

104
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,500
so this is for your own good.

105

[CROSS] On, Abata, Ura,
Masarakato. On, Gataru!

What's that?

107
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:32,625
He's gonna release
Grave of Maria.

[CROSS]
Magdala Curtain!

111
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:59,541
Huh? It sounds like a hymn.

112
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,750
No, that's not quite it.

Huh?

to send the brats away.

[LAVI]
So Tyki can't see us in here?

119
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,125
I don't think so.

120
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:28,125
That's what makes
Magdala Curtain so useful.

121
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:32,291
Master uses it to obstruct his
enemy's vision with sorcery.

122
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:35,583
That Maria thing will
only listen to his orders.

123
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:38,416
And that gun.

124
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,750
That's his Equipment-Type
Anti-Akuma weapon.

125

Time for Judgement.

[ALLEN]
Grave of Maria and Judgement.

129
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,041
Other Exorcists carry a single
weapon, but my Master has two.

130
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:22,291
Did you say two weapons?

131
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:25,250
I didn't even know
that was possible.

[yells]

So changing the course of the
bullets is the most you can do?

135
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:07,708
Now I'm curious.

136
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:12,083
You see, my bullets don't stop
until they reach their target.

Wow. That's powerful.

She's right, Allen.

I think we'd better
wrap this up.

No matter what we
threw at this guy,

147

we barely made a scratch.

00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,500
And now look at him.

149
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,625
[CHOMESUKE] As you can see,
I may be an Akuma,

00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:47,000
but I've been specially modified
by Cross Marian himself!

151
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:48,333
You should turn back around.

00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:51,041
You'll only slow
the General down.

153

It kinda bums me out,

154
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:05,208
seein' how much more
advanced he is than us.

155

We got a long way to go.

00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,750
It's about to collapse.

00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:08,083
Wouldn't this be more fun if
we got rid of these awful brats?

169
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,500
No, Lavi!

170
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:17,916
[LAVI]
Extend!

171
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:24,750
[gasps]

172
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:39,708
[LAVI] Dammit! Tyki's attacks
must've worn it down.

173
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:42,791
I can't die now! No!

174
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:05,166
[ALLEN]
Lavi. Chaozii.

175
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:22,166
They're gone. It can't be.

176
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:34,875
[ALLEN screams]

177
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:38,875
[MILLENNIUM EARL]
Oopsie,

178
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:42,083
looks like I didn't
dispose of 'em all.

179
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,541
The ground!

180
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,666
[screams]

181
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,125
I'm okay.

182
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,541
Hey!

183
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:08,416
Oh, no. Is that blood?

184
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,375
Allen!

185
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:15,208
[ALLEN]
Don't worry.

186
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:17,583
I swear I'll save you!

187
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:19,500
But you can't let go!

188
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,416
Oh, Allen.

189
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:38,291
Allen!

190
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,875
[LENALEE screams]

191
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,708
You okay?

192
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:02,583
[sighs]

193
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:10,416
[chuckles]

194
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,125
Lavi... and Chaozii.

195
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:18,583
Where are my manners?
I haven't greeted ya yet.

196
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:21,083
Good evening, my friends.

197
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,208
[chuckles]

198
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:32,375
Well, now. You haven't
changed a bit.

199
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:35,083
Have you, you fat bastard?

200
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,625
[ALLEN]
Every second brings us closer

201
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:23,000
to the demise of Noah's Ark.

202
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:24,333
In hopes of stopping it,

203
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:28,000
my master, Cross, entrusts
me with a mission.

204
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:31,166
But what he asks of me is...

205
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:35,000
On the next D.Gray-Man:
"Shadow of the Player."

206
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:38,416
Bring forth salvation to
this poor Akuma's soul!

207
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
[ALLEN]
Hm?

208
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:44,333
Hey there.

209
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:45,833
[MILLENNIUM EARL] Well,
if it isn't Professor Cross.

210
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:47,416
It's been too long.

211
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,666
Honestly, where in the
world have you been?

212
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:52,791
Why, teaching my class,
of course, Principal.

213
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:54,833
Huh? Is that true?

214
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:56,416
But I thought...
