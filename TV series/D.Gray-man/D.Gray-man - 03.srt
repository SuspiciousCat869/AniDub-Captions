1
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,333
I gotta combo one...

2
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:53,250
a combo two...

3
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:55,875
and a combo three, ready to go!

4
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:57,458
Alright...

5
00:01:57,541 --> 00:02:00,291
Keep them orders rolling in now!

6
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:06,208
Hey there...

7
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:08,458
You... must be the new guy...

8
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:10,875
Oh my God, you're such
a little cutie patootie...

9
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:12,208
How do you do, sir?

10
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:13,708
My name is Allen Walker!

11
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:16,583
Woah, everybody check out
the manners on this one...

12
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:17,916
What a gentleman...

13
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,083
So, Allen Walker,
are you hungry?

14
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:21,500
Anything you want.

15
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:23,875
Absolutely anything I want...?

16
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:25,333
Well, okay!

17
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:27,916
Then I'll have potatoes gratin,
fries and rice pilaf...

18
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,958
Mabo tofu, beef stew, meat pies,
carpaccio and fried rice...

19
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:33,791
Oh, Fried chicken,
a salad, some scones,

20
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:36,791
korean barbeque,
tom kha soup and white rice.

21
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:38,166
And for dessert I'll have mango

22
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,750
and sticky rice with an
order of mitarashi-dango...

23
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:42,666
Oh, make that twenty of 'em!

24
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,250
Uhh, are you sure
you can eat all this?

25
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:48,375
What? I dare you
to say that again!

26
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:51,625
Come on, Bazu. Take it easy.

27
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:53,583
Wait a minute, is that...?

28
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:56,875
Prepare to be slaughtered...
by the mighty Mugen!

29
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:01,041
You people are
such an annoyance.

30
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm minding my own business...

31
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,541
attempting to enjoy a nice meal

32
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:06,708
before I leave on
my next assignment...

33
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:09,125
and all I hear behind
me is whining.

34
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:10,208
You bastard...

35
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:11,625
You like disrespecting men

36
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,458
who've fallen in
the line of duty?

37
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:16,208
We risk our lives for
your kind every day.

38
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:18,833
And yet you have the nerve
to sit there and judge me...

39
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:20,625
simply for honoring
a great Finder...?

40
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:25,000
You smug little... sonuvabitch!

41
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:28,708
So sorry we ruined your meal!!!

42
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:35,250
You Finders are so
self-important.

43
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:40,166
The only thing you're capable
of doing is assisting us.

44
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,083
You all failed to
become Exorcists

45
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,875
and resorted to
finding instead.

46
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:47,333
That's why Innocence
chose me and none of you.

47
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:48,916
You're easily replaceable,

48
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,833
so if the idea of dying scares
you then I suggest you leave...

49
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,500
Got it?!

50
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:01,708
Stop it now!

51
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:03,041
I don't mean to get involved,

52
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:05,083
but I'm not going to stand
by and let this happen--

53
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,166
we're all on the same side.

54
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,750
Why don't you just
walk away, short-stack.

55
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,125
Short-stack...?

56
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:13,000
The name's Allen.

57
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:14,875
Sorry but you have to
survive at least a month

58
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,791
before I make
note of your name...

59
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:19,708
The turnover rate is high,
especialy with these guys .

60
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:22,541
Sadly, they all drop like flies.

61
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:29,625
You really need to learn
to watch your mouth.

62
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:32,791
And you need to keep
that cursed hand off me.

63
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,250
You'll be dead within a year...

64
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:39,125
Trust me... you're weak...

65
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:40,916
We'll see about that.

66
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:47,125
Hey, Reever. Check this out.

67
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,541
Great... Just what I needed.

68
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:50,291
Kanda!

69
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:51,750
Allen!

70
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,208
Get to over to the
Command Room now...

71
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:55,666
Your missions are up.

72
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:01,375
Chief... Chief...

73
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:05,333
Hey, Chief, wake up.

74
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,166
Just heard about Lenalee...

75
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,916
She's getting married.

76
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,375
How could you, Lenalee!!!

77
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,666
How could you even
consider getting married

78
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,333
without telling
your older brother?

79
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,500
Am I even gonna be a part
of the wedding party?

80
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,416
Sorry about this, but
sometimes it's the only way

81
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,291
we can wake him up,
he sleeps pretty hard.

82
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,750
So...

83
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,875
We're running short on time,
so as soon you two are briefed,

84
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:30,208
you'll need to leave ASAP.

85
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:31,625
What?!

86
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:34,000
You expect me to work with him?

87
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:34,750
Why?

88
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:35,833
Uh, yes.

89
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:38,291
You're on this
assignment together.

90
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:42,625
What's going on with you two?

91
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,708
Are you guys already
off to a bad start...?

92
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:46,083
How come?

93
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,125
They didn't exactly meet
on good terms now did they?

94
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:50,583
Ah...

95
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,125
My decision stands!

96
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:55,541
A fragment of Innocence was
discovered in southern Italy...

97
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,000
But we've got word
that an Akuma

98
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,708
is already en route
to grab it...

99
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,708
You two will head
there immediately.

100
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:04,583
Destroy the enemy and secure
the Innocence at all costs...

101
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:07,750
You'll have to time to look over
the dossier on the way there.

102
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,458
Good luck to you.

103
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:13,750
Do I really have
to wear this thing?

104
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:16,666
It's standard dress for
a professional exorcist...

105
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,833
It was created for battle,

106
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:20,166
so the material is
exceptionally robust.

107
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:24,500
Hey, where've
you been hiding...?

108
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,708
I've been looking all
over the place for you.

109
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:33,583
Timcanpy showed me your past.

110
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,333
He's equipped with
a recording device

111
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:38,291
so we can monitor your progress.

112
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:39,916
Be safe!

113
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:46,750
We'll see you soon!

114
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,833
Hold on!

115
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:51,958
Give me a sec!

116
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,750
We don't have time for that now!

117
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,416
That's our train!

118
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:00,791
Wait, the train is moving?!!

119
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,791
I can't believe
we pulled that off.

120
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:07,000
Hey, we're just
getting started...

121
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:12,083
Uh... Tickets?

122
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,250
We're with the Black Order...

123
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:16,250
I believe we have
several reservations?

124
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:17,375
Yes, of course.

125
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:18,375
Follow me.

126
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,125
I'll show you to
your compartment.

127
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:23,125
Wait, we get... our own room?

128
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:31,666
Now this is the way to travel.

129
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,500
According to the dossier
we're heading to...

130
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:36,375
the ancient city of Mater.

131
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:38,791
I think I remember reading
about this place once.

132
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,833
It's been in ruins for decades.

133
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:42,291
Our target sounds interesting.

134
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,291
The Ghost of Mater...

135
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:45,750
I'm confused.

136
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,791
How in the world could
a ghost have anything

137
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,458
to do with Innocence?

138
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,250
Hey...!

139
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,208
Is that attitude necessary?!

140
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,166
Take a guess.

141
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,416
Y'know, you're a jerk.

142
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,000
Unexplained phenomena
are a common occurrence

143
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,875
where Innocence exists.

144
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,791
Really?

145
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:06,000
Innocence has
altered its own biology.

146
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,875
Of course it doesn't
happen overnight...

147
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,166
Most estimates
place the timeline

148
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,333
between Noah's Flood
and the present.

149
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:18,250
This may be due to the
crystal's mysterious power

150
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:19,791
trying to communicate with us

151
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,875
or any number of
unknown reasons...

152
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:23,791
but it seems that
Innocence always finds

153
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:26,791
its way into human hands.

154
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,333
The one thing we
still can't figure out

155
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:32,416
is why Innocence is causing
the strange phenomena.

156
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:34,833
So...

157
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:36,791
You're saying the existence
of a ghost in Mater

158
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,875
could be caused by Innocence.

159
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,250
Yes...

160
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:44,041
Because where mystery is
found, Innocence is nearby.

161
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:46,583
That's why the Order enlists
Finders like myself to conduct

162
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:49,875
thorough investigations
of these instances.

163
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:54,916
Mysteries like the
Ghost of Mater?

164
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,625
Yes... Precisely.

165
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,916
Hi... My name is Allen Walker.

166
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,125
It's certainly my
pleasure, Master Walker.

167
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,958
I am Toma, your
Finder for this mission.

168
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,250
Have you been doing this
since we got on the train?

169
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,666
It's a hobby of mine.

170
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,666
It looks interesting.

171
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,375
Master Walker, tell me,

172
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:17,291
are you at all familiar
with the Ghost of Mater?

173
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:18,333
I'm not.

174
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:20,125
It's fascinating...

175
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:21,958
The story harkens
back to the days

176
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,250
when the city fell into ruin...

177
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:26,083
The ghost was
originally an inhabitant

178
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,750
of the city before
it met its demise.

179
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:32,500
As people visited the city,

180
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,708
the ghost would draw
them towards his being,

181
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:37,208
in an attempt to
relieve his lonliness...

182
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:43,041
I hear stories about
disappearances all the time.

183
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,541
We Finders investigate
stories like this,

184
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,375
even if it's only
a vague rumor...

185
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,458
and most of the
time, they are...

186
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:51,625
But until we
determine its validity...

187
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:54,541
and whether or not Innocence
is directly involved...

188
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:59,333
we will stay for up to months at
a time investigating the claims.

189
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:03,208
As I said, most
of them do turn out

190
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:06,500
to be fake stories or
local legends gone awry...

191
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:09,791
but even when the rumors
turn out to be fact...

192
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,166
It's very rare for
Innocence to actually play

193
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,250
a major role in the plot...

194
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,166
However...

195
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,875
if there is even the
slightest hint of possibility

196
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,416
that Innocence is involved...

197
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,833
It immediately becomes
a top priority,

198
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:30,041
for the finders,
to inform the Order...

199
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,916
And then...

200
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,041
Exorcists show up
to finish the job.

201
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:40,125
Be ready to move in five.

202
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:47,500
That way!

203
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:49,041
Draw it in and grab it.

204
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,375
Get it closer.

205
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,208
Easy... Easy...

206
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:54,208
Go!

207
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,333
We've got 'em in the barrier!

208
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:57,833
Excellent...

209
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:59,833
that should buy us some time
until the exorcist's arrive.

210
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:02,125
Yeah, let's hope so.

211
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:05,083
But something tells me there's
another Akuma out there.

212
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,000
I think you may be right.

213
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,375
Please... No... No...!

214
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:32,791
There's another one!

215
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:34,708
The barrier! It's...

216
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,916
The Finder unit's
been wiped out...

217
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,416
every last one of them...

218
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,208
Wh-What should we do?

219
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:45,416
We need to find a way to get
the Akuma inside the barrier.

220
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,625
Quiet...

221
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:49,208
We simply don't have
the manpower to subdue

222
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:52,041
the Akuma now that
the other unit is gone.

223
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:55,041
It's only a matter of time
before it finds us here.

224
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,583
Guzol.

225
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,583
Lala, run!

226
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:01,708
No... I... I can't do that...

227
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:04,166
I'm going to stay by
your side until the end.

228
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:08,791
I have an idea, but I'm only
doing this as a last resort.

229
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,416
All of us must go
to whatever lengths

230
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,541
are necessary to ensure
the Ghost of Mater's safety.

231
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:17,083
Until the exorcists
arrive we must hold on.

232
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,416
Toma, how's it looking?

233
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,541
I can't get through.

234
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,791
Then let's hurry.

235
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,541
I hope everyone's safe...

236
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:40,000
Can you see the Akuma?

237
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:43,250
I can.

238
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,708
My left eye is equipped with
a sensor that can spot Akuma,

239
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:48,833
and more specifically, the
souls trapped inside of them.

240
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:50,458
...a cursed eye.

241
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:54,333
You should have told us that
from the start, short-stack...

242
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:57,375
Before we arrive, let's
get something straight...

243
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,541
I'm not nearly the
idealist you are.

244
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:03,166
Emotions have no place
on the battlefield.

245
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,000
If you get yourself hurt,
hinder the mission

246
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,750
and put the rest
of us in danger...

247
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,208
I'll leave you for dead.

248
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,083
In other words,
we're not partners,

249
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,208
so don't expect me to help.

250
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,083
Pleasant as always.

251
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:15,375
Right.

252
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,000
Still no response?

253
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:55,958
No.

254
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:57,458
That's strange.

255
00:13:57,541 --> 00:14:00,250
The Finder unit should have
already risen the barriers.

256
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:03,125
They could survive a few
days in there, at least.

257
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,041
I see the barrier...

258
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:08,000
it's over there!

259
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,375
That must be the Ghost of Mater.

260
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:16,708
What?

261
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:18,583
Then where are the Finders?

262
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,375
It looks like they've
activated the barrier

263
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:23,916
in order to protect
the Ghost of Mater.

264
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,833
Instead of saving themselves...

265
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:29,291
they must be waiting
for the exorcists...

266
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:31,958
Oh no.

267
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:33,500
Then they did their job, Toma.

268
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:34,833
Agreed.

269
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:38,083
There's a light!

270
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:40,291
They're alive!

271
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:41,458
Master Walker!

272
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:42,875
Leave him alone...

273
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:45,041
You and I should hurry.

274
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:47,625
The barrier won't last long.

275
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,708
Please Exorcist.

276
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,083
Stupid...

277
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:52,000
That's what happens when
you attack with no plan.

278
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:58,500
Now it's time for battle.

279
00:15:58,583 --> 00:15:59,583
Mugen...

280
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,333
Unsheathe.

281
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:07,583
Innocence...

282
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,416
Activate!

283
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:17,125
Mugen.

284
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:19,083
Summon Misfortune!

285
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,166
Underworld...

286
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,708
Creatures...

287
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:27,375
First Illusion!

288
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,791
Finder, tell me the
release code for the barrier.

289
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,500
There's not much time.

290
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:49,000
Have you come to
save us... Exorcist?

291
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,708
Just give me the code,

292
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:54,250
you don't want your death
to be for nothing now do you?

293
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,125
Fine...

294
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:57,958
The code is...

295
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:00,208
Have Hope.

296
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:04,166
You must protect...

297
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,833
the Innocence...

298
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:14,416
Have you come to
save us, exorcist?

299
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,583
You're safe.

300
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,375
Ghost of Mater.

301
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:37,916
Just be careful, Timcanpy.

302
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:07,500
He's too strong.

303
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:15,791
It's changing!

304
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:17,541
What's happening?

305
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:20,541
The soul trapped inside
it is being distorted!

306
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:28,333
I am... an Akuma!

307
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:29,666
It spoke!

308
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:35,041
My new form is born from
the darkest of matter...

309
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:38,500
Thank you for all
your help, Exorcist!

310
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:44,791
It appears I'm all grown up!

311
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,458
How is that possible...?

312
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,791
The Akuma evolved?!

313
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:51,125
Aren't you clever?!

314
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,291
Kanda!

315
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,458
I'm not here to help you.

316
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:58,500
Acting on your emotions is
what got you into this mess...

317
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:01,500
You'll have to take
care of it yourself.

318
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:02,541
Fine then...

319
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:03,666
As long as you have
the Innocence

320
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,666
there's no need
for me to worry.

321
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,583
I'll catch up with
you two later,

322
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:09,833
after I destroy this Akuma.

323
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,916
You will die...

324
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,666
Not me!

325
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,166
Toma, keep an eye on him.

326
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,666
On Master Walker?

327
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,791
No, on that Akuma.

328
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,708
Yes, sir.

329
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,958
There's no way the kid
can defeat that thing...

330
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:31,000
He's in way over his head.

331
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:35,541
I see the ghost has
made his escape...

332
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:36,875
Well, that's fine...

333
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:40,583
I'll make plenty of time
to deal with him later...

334
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,000
But first...

335
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,916
I get to take your life.

336
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:50,166
I wouldn't be so
sure about that.

337
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:38,708
Wait...

338
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:40,583
That's not an Akuma...

339
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,000
It's a fake!

340
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:46,750
I'm right... behind you.

341
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:00,666
What the...

342
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:05,750
There's two of me.

343
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,000
The Akuma has evolved

344
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:41,000
into an extremely dangerous
form using the souls

345
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:42,833
of the Finder's its murdered...

346
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:44,916
To make matters worse,
it gained the ability

347
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,041
to copy others, putting us
in a difficult situation.

348
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:49,875
Next time on D. Gray-man:

349
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:52,875
"Old Man of the Soil and
a Lonely Night's Aria."

350
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:56,250
Bring forth salvation to
this tormented Akuma's soul.
