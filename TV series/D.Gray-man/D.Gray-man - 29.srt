1
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:42,041
Hold on!

2
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm coming, I'm coming!

3
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,041
Millennium Earl speaking...

4
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:50,583
Well, that is wonderful news...!

5
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:51,708
Thanks for calling...

6
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:53,083
I'll be right over.

7
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,000
Another one, you say?

8
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:57,166
Well, of course!

9
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,750
And thank you for
calling so quickly...!

10
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:01,083
I'll wire the payment
to you right away.

11
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:04,458
Yes, yes. The
usual account it is.

12
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:14,375
Look, there's another one...!

13
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:16,958
I think that might be the
biggest lake we've seen so far!

14
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:18,625
I didn't realize there'd
be so many lakes

15
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:19,958
on this side of Liverpool...

16
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:22,333
I can't believe how
gorgeous they are...

17
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:24,875
It's no wonder they call
this area the Lake District.

18
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:26,083
People say this is one of

19
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:28,750
the most beautiful
regions in England.

20
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:34,791
Wow...! It looks great!

21
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:37,666
The last time I was
here was three years ago,

22
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,000
and the town square
wasn't nearly this nice...

23
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:41,458
Right, Timcanpy?

24
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:42,875
You seem happy to be back.

25
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:44,166
I am...

26
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,250
It almost feels like
I'm back in my hometown...

27
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:49,916
Which is a little strange since
I didn't stay here very long.

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,250
I think I know why...

29
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,458
This place holds a lot
of fond memories for you.

30
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:56,041
Do you think that's it?

31
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:58,250
You told me that after
you met General Cross,

32
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,500
things got a little
rough for you...

33
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:02,958
But I'm glad you had
some good times, as well.

34
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:05,791
I'm so excited
to meet "Mother"...

35
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:07,208
The way you've been
talking about her;

36
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:08,750
I can tell she was a good person

37
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,666
for you during an
important part of your life...

38
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,791
That's true...

39
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:13,541
She was.

40
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:14,666
Hey! You there!

41
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,583
You're not from
around here, are ya?

42
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:21,166
Those shoes of yours have
seen better days, am I right?

43
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:23,416
But you're in luck because
I happen to have

44
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,375
a brand new pair of my
famous shoes right here.

45
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:34,625
That's me.

46
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:35,875
Richard.

47
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:38,416
And I hate to toot
my own horn, but these are

48
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,583
the highest-quality shoes
you'll see anywhere in town.

49
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:42,750
I'm sure...

50
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:44,833
But our shoes are
just fine for right now.

51
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:46,541
Maybe next time...

52
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:47,750
Now remember...!

53
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,250
For the best-made shoes
in all of Liverpool,

54
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:50,583
come to Richard's Shoes!

55
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:51,750
We will...

56
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:54,541
It was a pleasure
meeting you, Richard!

57
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:55,625
You won't know pleasure

58
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,708
until you try on
a pair of my finest!

59
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,041
That place is new...

60
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:01,958
A lot's changed since
I was here the last time.

61
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:03,625
Hello there, sir...!

62
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,041
Those old, worn-out
shoes of yours

63
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:06,833
have seen better
days, am I right...?

64
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:09,541
What do you say we
find you a new pair?

65
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:10,541
Look at that...

66
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,541
He uses the same
line on everybody

67
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:15,625
that happens to
wander past his shop.

68
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,708
Oh...

69
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:22,083
That's the biggest building
we've seen since we arrived...

70
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,625
I wonder if it's a hospital.

71
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:25,750
Well, it certainly
is big enough.

72
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:30,666
We're getting closer...

73
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,916
Mother's house is
right on the bank

74
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,750
of that small lake over there.

75
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:47,083
It looks like a
funeral procession...

76
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,625
Oh, that poor woman walking
behind the casket...

77
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:52,625
She must be the grieving
widow of the person inside.

78
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:59,416
Everybody run...!
You're in danger!

79
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:09,125
Akuma!

80
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:12,125
Find someplace to hide...!
Get out of here!

81
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:20,208
Wh-What in the world are they?

82
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,125
Get as far away as
you can...! Go quickly!

83
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:43,375
Allen!

84
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,041
They didn't hurt you, did they?

85
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,166
I'm fine, but where'd
they come from?

86
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,458
I don't know.

87
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:51,041
I wonder if it has
anything to do with Mother?

88
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:54,625
Mother has been supporting the
Black Order for a long time.

89
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,625
Then we'd better
hurry up and find her.

90
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,208
Oh, man!

91
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:07,250
Barba!

92
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,250
Barba!

93
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:14,208
Hey...! Allen...!
Long time, no see!

94
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,833
Has it really been
three whole years?

95
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:19,708
Good to see you too, Barba...
But... calm down!

96
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:26,708
Um... Allen...

97
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:29,833
Allen!

98
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:31,208
What's gotten in to you?

99
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:35,041
You'll catch a cold sleeping
on the ground...! Here.

100
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:36,500
Where's General Cross?

101
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:37,708
Did he come, too?

102
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:40,708
I'm afraid my
master's gone missing.

103
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:41,500
Are you okay?

104
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,208
Yeah, I'll be all right...

105
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:44,750
How's Mother doing, Barba?

106
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:45,750
She's good...

107
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,208
She's as healthy
as she ever was...

108
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:49,750
But wait 'til she
lays eyes on you--

109
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:50,875
What is it?

110
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:52,166
Nothing...! But...

111
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,041
Who's this?

112
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:54,750
Oh... Sorry, how rude of me...

113
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:55,791
Barba, meet--

114
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:59,125
Mother...! It's Allen...! 

115
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:00,958
Allen came back...!

116
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:04,000
And he brought his
little girlfriend with him!

117
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,208
So, this is your girlfriend.

118
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:23,208
I don't know what
Barba told you...

119
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,291
She's actually not
my girlfriend, she's--

120
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,958
I'm an Exorcist of the
Black Order, thank you!

121
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:29,958
I knew that.

122
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:30,791
Oh...

123
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:33,291
I didn't mean to be rude.

124
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:36,125
You're coat's a dead giveaway.

125
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:37,250
And I can't help but notice

126
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,375
you're wearing the
same thing, my boy.

127
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:40,958
Oh... Yes...

128
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:42,208
I've gone through my training,

129
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:44,041
and about six months ago
I was granted permission

130
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,833
to call myself an Exorcist.

131
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:48,500
Is that so...? That's quite
an accomplishment...

132
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,250
...for such a bean sprout.

133
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,333
A bean sprout?

134
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:54,416
So Kanda isn't the only one.

135
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,791
Everyone you know
thinks your short...

136
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:59,250
I can't win.

137
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,416
Allen...! Sure hope
you're hungry...

138
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,958
Look at what I made you...!
It's my special stew!

139
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:08,000
Your girlfriend will love it...!
Don't hold back, now!

140
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:09,041
I told you...

141
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,041
She's not my
girlfriend, she's my...

142
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:13,000
Associate! Yeah!

143
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,125
General Yeegar, eh?

144
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,166
That's right...

145
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,500
The Black Order
thinks it'd be best

146
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,375
for all available
Exorcists to split up

147
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,208
and protect the
other four generals...

148
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:25,833
But no one even knows
where General Cross is.

149
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,041
However if anyone
would be able to help us

150
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,666
it'd be you, so that's
why we came out here...

151
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,791
And what makes you think

152
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,791
I would know where
to find the General?

153
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,333
Well wait...

154
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:38,083
From what I remember weren't
you General Cross's sponsor...

155
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,416
That man walked out of here

156
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,375
leaving nothing but all
of his debt behind him...

157
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,291
To hell with him...

158
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:47,583
I'm sorry, but I think
I've lost my appetite.

159
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:50,083
After all you ate,
just say you're full.

160
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,000
I forgot to tell you...

161
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:54,000
When we were traveling here...

162
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:56,666
Lenalee and I ran into
a pack of Akuma...

163
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,125
I worried...

164
00:08:58,208 --> 00:08:59,875
That they might have been
on there way to hurt you...

165
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:02,875
And yet here I stand without
a scratch on my head...

166
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:06,166
In all my years I've never
been attacked by an Akuma.

167
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,041
That's true...

168
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,291
But it still doesn't explain why

169
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,750
so many of them suddenly
appeared in the village.

170
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,916
Have you heard any
strange rumors lately...?

171
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,541
About Innocence or
anything else odd?

172
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:16,666
No, I haven't...

173
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,333
But I do know that
the number of Akuma

174
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:21,625
has gone up significantly
over the past six months.

175
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:25,791
If you ask me, these
things are up to something.

176
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:29,000
And in a little town like this--

177
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:32,625
I need everyone to
hurry into the next room

178
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,416
and keep quiet, now get going.

179
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,041
Why?

180
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,916
Is it a guest?

181
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,375
A little late for visitors.

182
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,083
Yes, dear! I'm coming!

183
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,750
Listen, I want you
to hear what she says,

184
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,875
but if there strangers here,
she won't talk to me...

185
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,458
So go...

186
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:49,291
Both of you, get in the other
room and keep your ears open.

187
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:52,958
Oh, and mouths shut.

188
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:55,708
Liza! Please come in!

189
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,458
Mother.

190
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,916
I know what the
director told you...

191
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,875
Your husband doesn't have
much time left, does he?

192
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:25,500
No... He said we should enjoy

193
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,333
what little time we
have left together.

194
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:35,333
But when night comes...

195
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:38,708
I don't... know what
to do with myself...

196
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:42,041
I wish there was
something I could do!

197
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,250
Oh, Liza...

198
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,166
That's only natural.

199
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:50,250
But all we can do is pray
that Lenny gets better.

200
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:51,458
When I was here before,

201
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:52,875
the villagers would
always come to Mother

202
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,000
when they needed
help or advice...

203
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,000
I guess some
things never change.

204
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,833
Mother says that girl
is working as a nurse

205
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:00,416
at the big hospital
in the village...

206
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,791
The poor thing
has a sick husband

207
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,458
named Lenny that's
been staying there...

208
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:06,041
But I don't think there's
much hope he'll pull through.

209
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,541
I can't live without Lenny...!

210
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:09,750
He's all I have left

211
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:12,708
and I don't know if
I can go on without him!

212
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:16,000
If my husband dies... I will.

213
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:19,125
You mustn't allow yourself to
think such terrible things...

214
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:20,583
He needs you to be strong...

215
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,250
You have to focus
your thoughts on giving

216
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:26,416
Lenny the best life you can
while you still have him...

217
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,583
Do you understand, dear?

218
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:33,000
I'll make sure
Liza gets home safe.

219
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,541
Thank you, Barba.

220
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:41,500
She's been coming over
almost every night lately...

221
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:44,166
She doesn't have
anyone else to lean on.

222
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,833
That worries me about her.

223
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,500
A person's grief
at losing someone

224
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,958
close to them
can be overwhelming.

225
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:55,500
And if the
Millennium Earl is able

226
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,875
to use that grief against her...

227
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,208
Which is precisely
why I want you two

228
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:03,875
to make sure
that doesn't happen.

229
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,916
See you when you get back!

230
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,833
I grew all those
flowers myself...!

231
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:14,666
You make sure they get there!

232
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,125
Have a wonderful day!

233
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,541
Ah...! The travelers
from yesterday...!

234
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:33,916
So you've changed your mind

235
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,416
and you've come
to order new shoes!

236
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,750
Well... no.

237
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,500
I didn't mean to put on
such a show for you two...

238
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,916
That'd be my
lovely wife, Sarah...

239
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,416
Not bad looking, huh?

240
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,875
Yeah...! I mean, no.

241
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:45,750
Okay...

242
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,708
I think we'd better go now...

243
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:48,750
Good day salesmen...

244
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:49,791
If you want another
look at Sarah,

245
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,291
you'll have to
try getting sick...!

246
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:52,916
Her patients at the hospital

247
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,458
don't know how
good they've got it!

248
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,125
Hospital?

249
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,708
I'm so sorry... my darling.

250
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:08,916
Don't be silly...

251
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,125
It's no trouble.

252
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:12,958
Liza, I'm so glad that
you're here with me.

253
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:16,625
All the other patients
must be so jealous.

254
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,708
Don't you worry about
the other patients.

255
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:20,708
The hospital director
told me I should stay here,

256
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,291
and that's what
I'm going to do...

257
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:25,208
He told me to think of your
care as my highest priority.

258
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:26,708
I doubt there are many
doctors in the world

259
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:30,041
who are as understanding as
the director's been with us.

260
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,750
If only everyone could
be as kind as that man.

261
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,541
Have the patient transferred
to a private room

262
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,375
as soon as possible.

263
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:41,791
You're kidding!

264
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,041
A private room...?

265
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:45,666
But Doctor...
we can't afford it!

266
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:49,000
Let me worry about the
financial side of things...

267
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:51,125
What's important now
is that we do all we can

268
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:52,708
to make your last days
with your husband

269
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:56,000
as comfortable and
peaceful as possible...

270
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,625
Oh, thank you...!
Thank you so very much!

271
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,333
The director had Lenny moved
to a special private room.

272
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:07,791
Liza has been in
there with him all day.

273
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:10,250
She's told me
all about Mother...

274
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,666
I assume you've both come
for her advice, as well.

275
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,458
That's right.

276
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:15,708
Is he serious?

277
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:18,208
If he keeps running this
hospital like a charity,

278
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:21,375
we'll be bankrupt in no time!

279
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:24,041
Get out of my way.

280
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:25,541
Is that the director?

281
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:26,500
Oh, no...

282
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,541
That's only Robert...

283
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:29,916
He might be a competent doctor,

284
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,666
but he's also one of the
greediest men I've ever met.

285
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,416
And I'm not the only nurse
around here that'll say so.

286
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,458
Yeah...

287
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,791
He gives the
profession a bad name...

288
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:41,750
But the hospital
director's a wonderful man.

289
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:50,375
Lenny!

290
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:55,083
I know the taste leaves
a lot to be desired...

291
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:57,333
But try to finish it all ...

292
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:58,833
Liza, come with me please...

293
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:00,500
Yes, sir.

294
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:05,625
I'm sorry...

295
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:08,500
But he really only
has a day or two left.

296
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:16,458
All you can do is cherish
what little time you have.

297
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:19,375
Is she...

298
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:22,041
I think we should
give our friend

299
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:24,708
a few moments
to collect herself.

300
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:30,333
Hey, Sarah...?

301
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,125
Mother sent these
flowers for Liza,

302
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:33,791
can you make sure
that she gets them?

303
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,125
But... You came all this way...

304
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,208
I wish you could
deliver them yourself.

305
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:38,083
It's okay.

306
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:40,291
If we stayed here...

307
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:43,833
I don't think I'd
know what to say.

308
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,666
Look at us...

309
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,708
I've never felt so helpless.

310
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,666
Watch out!

311
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,750
Are you all right?

312
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:08,875
I think so.

313
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:11,500
Richard...! Watch out!

314
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,666
Richard!

315
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,083
Oh no!

316
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,541
He'll be fine.

317
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:38,750
Director, be honest...

318
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:43,583
How is he?

319
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:44,833
I'm sorry...

320
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:48,333
We did all we could,
but unfortunately...

321
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,166
Oh, Sarah! I'm so sor--

322
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:55,250
I'm fine...!
Thank you, but I'm fine.

323
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:58,541
Sarah...

324
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,458
There's something
we should discuss...

325
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:03,416
I'd like to try to help you get
through this difficult time...

326
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,250
Come, now.

327
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,958
Liza!

328
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:15,958
I'm not strong...

329
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:18,458
If that had been me
in Sarah's shoes...

330
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:22,791
If it was my Lenny that the
director couldn't save...

331
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:38,083
I'm scared...

332
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,458
If Lenny doesn't make it;

333
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:42,458
there won't be anything
left for me to live for.

334
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:44,458
Don't let yourself
think that way, Liza...

335
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:45,916
Remember what Mother told you,

336
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,875
and focus on making his last
days the best they can be.

337
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:52,583
Has Mother given
you advice, too?

338
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:54,125
Some.

339
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:56,916
How is she?

340
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,541
Not bad, considering
the circumstances...

341
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:00,250
The director is taking
good care of her;

342
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:03,000
I don't think there's
anything to worry about.

343
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,708
And Liza.

344
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:05,833
I know this isn't easy,

345
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,583
but Lenalee and
I are here for you...

346
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,541
I want you to remember that.

347
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,291
She seems better today,

348
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:28,041
now that's she's had
time to get a little rest.

349
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,166
She does seem a bit
calmer than she was,

350
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,000
but I'm still worried
about how she might react

351
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,291
if he takes a
turn for the worse.

352
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:38,916
Lenny!

353
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,166
You have to try to
hang on...! Lenny!

354
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,750
No way...! But how?

355
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:02,750
No, she wouldn't of...!
Not Sarah!

356
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:03,791
I don't understand!

357
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,625
We never let her
out of our sight!

358
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:08,625
She didn't even step foot
outside of the hospital!

359
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:32,000
The Millennium Earl doesn't
let anyone's grief go unnoticed.

360
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,125
I knew that!

361
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:36,250
I knew and I still
let this happen!

362
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:38,416
If only we'd been more careful,

363
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,500
kept a closer eye on her!

364
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:51,708
I'm sorry, Sarah...

365
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:56,375
If it wasn't for me... you never
would have turned into an Akuma!

366
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,166
Allen.

367
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,125
We have to get back
to the hospital...

368
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:07,250
Something terrible happened

369
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,000
and we have to
discover what it was...

370
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,166
The hospital?

371
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:10,875
There's got to be a
way to prevent this

372
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:13,125
from happening again!

373
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:18,958
So this is goodbye...
my darling.

374
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:22,208
No...! You have to
keep fighting, Lenny!

375
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:23,833
Please, Liza...

376
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:29,583
Say it... Just once...
say goodbye.

377
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:39,750
Good... Goodbye.

378
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:48,833
Lenny... Lenny...? Lenny!

379
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:51,083
Lenny!

380
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,250
Lenny!

381
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:39,416
Suddenly, and without warning,

382
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,541
hoards of Akuma began appearing
in this peaceful village...

383
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:44,666
It wasn't long before
our investigation led us

384
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,750
to a large hospital
in the center of town.

385
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,791
On the next D. Gray-man:

386
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:52,333
"The One Who Sells
Souls, Part 2."

387
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:55,791
Bring forth salvation to
this tormented Akuma's soul!
