Joined the Black order

00:01:46,416 --> 00:01:49,000
He belonged to General
Winters Socalo's guard unit,

4
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:51,375
which was attacked in
the Agra District of India

5
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:52,916
by the Noah Tyki Mikk.

6
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
His fellow Exorcists, Kazarna
Rido and Charcar Lavong,

7
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:58,083
were killed during the battle.

8
00:01:58,166 --> 00:02:00,583
However, Suman Dark's
whereabouts

9
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:02,958
have been unknown
since the attack.

Why are they flying

16
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:28,833
They're just ignoring us?
What gives?

17
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:32,041
Who the hell do they think they
are, running from a fight?!

This is no time

Their job... Is that
what they meant?

35
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,166
Their goal was to
destroy this thing?

[LENALEE] Someone who failed

00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:12,541
[LAB HEAD A] It would appear
he's lost the ability to hear.

45
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,458
We're free to discuss
the procedure openly

46
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,041
in his presence, gentlemen.

47
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,625
[LAB HEAD B] What was his
previous synchronization rate?

48
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:19,875
[LAB HEAD C]
Regrettably,

49
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,916
we didn't measure a
number worth reporting.

50
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,375
[LAB HEAD D] Each experiment
causes his body functions

51

to deteriorate further.

52
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,708
I'm starting to have doubts
whether the procedure

53
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,375
will work unless the subject
is an Accommodator.

54
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,583
[LAB HEAD A] This test may
prove to be the final one.

[LAB HEAD B] We can't give up
now. It's just a matter of time.

00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:38,708
Beside, he's a close relative
of one of the Exorcists.

57
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:40,541
[LAB HEAD C]
True. Also, let's not forget

58
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:43,833
it was the subject's own desire
to undergo the process.

[gasps]

60

Only an Accommodator
chosen by God can endure it.

All others will fail.

Damn. Another failure.

[LENALEE cries]

84
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,500
[LENALEE]
I've seen this before.

85
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:05,333
When someone's sync rate with
Innocence is zero or less,

86
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:07,125
it rejects them.

87
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:09,958
If a non-Accommodator tries
to synchronize with Innocence

88
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,541
by force, they're punished.

89
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,416
They become a Fallen One.

90
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,708
They say it's a sin
carried by a non-apostle

91
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:19,458
for betraying the will of God.

92
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:22,375
It's forbidden now,
but I've witnessed it.

Trying to create Exorcists
from non-Accommodators.

98
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:34,166
I'll never forget the boy
from the experiment.

99
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,125
He looked like that.

100
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:42,875
[LENALEE] The same figure
as Suman. But why?

101
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:47,833
It doesn't make any sense.
Suman was an Accommodator.

102
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:50,708
He was an Exorcist, like us.

His name was Suman Dark?

Yes. He was a Parasite
Type Accomodator.

105
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,541
The same exact type as you are.

106
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,458
He's been in the Black
Order for five years

under General Socalo's unit.

108
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,125
I heard they were
attacked the other day

109
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,125
and Suman went missing.

110

But what happened?

It doesn't make any sense!
How did he become a Fallen One?

112
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,416
[ALLEN] I think only one
person knows the answer.

It's not too late?

136
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:09,416
I asked Hevlaska about
the experiment I witnessed.

137
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,166
I can't remember the
number of times I begged.

But she wouldn't reveal
anything to me.

I never learned what
happened to that boy

after he became a Fallen One.

but I couldn't.

Where am I?

[groans] My head!
What's going on?!

[ALLEN screams]

00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:43,083
[ALLEN] Suman's emotions
are flowing through me.

177
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:45,000
Flooding into my own.

178

[LENALEE]
What should I do?

181

[LENALEE]
The girl. She isn't breathing!

I can't save her if I stay here!

...Allen.

I have to help this girl.

Suman. What did you do?

No! Stay away!

I don't wanna die! Someone!

194
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:05,458
[LENALEE]
Suman was an Accommodator.

195
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:08,708
How did he become a Fallen One?

196

[SUMAN]
I don't wanna die like this!

I want to keep living!

198
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:17,458
[ALLEN] So that's it. Suman.
You deserted your friends.

199
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,458
And begged the Akuma
to spare you.

200
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:26,791
[ALLEN] You betrayed
the Innocence, didn't you?

201
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:32,791
It was your decision. You chose
to become a Fallen One.

207
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:13,583
[ALLEN]
This sensation.

208
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:17,291
He must've released another
energy wave against the Akuma!

[shrieking]

00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,875
What are these?
They're shrieking.

211
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:24,916
Is this Suman screaming
out in pain?

212
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,583
Then he is suffering.

213
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:30,083
I wonder... Could this be
the will of the Innocence?

214
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:32,541
It wants him in agony?

215
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,458
[ALLEN] There's something
about the destructive force

216
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:39,958
Suman possesses. The
quantity is unusual.

217
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,500
Is it possible.

218
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,208
Is the Innocence boosting its
power by devouring his body

219
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,958
and shooting out that energy?

220
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:48,666
I never learned what
happened to that boy

221
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,291
after he became a Fallen One.

Huh?

Wait a minute...

227
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,458
It's trying to kill him.

228
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:08,708
His Innocence is
trying to kill him.

229
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:12,500
It's trying to punish the
sinner. Like God himself.

Heh.

And her breathing's
finally stabilized.
