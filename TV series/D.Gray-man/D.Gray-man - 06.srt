1
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,375
The conductor was
very apologetic...

2
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:54,375
It looks like the train will
be stuck here for a while.

3
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:55,625
Okay.

4
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:00,666
I'm wondering why
this Innocence...

5
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,583
would fuse with Lala...

6
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:08,333
I wonder why I was
born with this hand...

7
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:09,916
and why the Innocence...

8
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,791
even chose me at all.

9
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:35,875
An Akuma!

10
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:40,375
It's an Akuma!

11
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:42,583
Help, it's gonna kill me!

12
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,500
Master Walker!

13
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:45,916
Where's the Akuma...?!

14
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,291
Are you alright...?!

15
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:51,750
I... heard...

16
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:54,458
Didn't anyone ever tell
you demons don't exist?

17
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:55,916
What?

18
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,458
See what you did, John...?

19
00:02:57,541 --> 00:03:00,083
These people thought you
were in real danger...

20
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,083
Owwww...

21
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:02,333
Sorry about that...

22
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,208
This kid likes to pull pranks...

23
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:08,000
He's always doing this, yelling
about demons and monsters.

24
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,083
Wouldja just listen to me?

25
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:10,250
I'm not lying...!

26
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,666
Akuma really do
exist. They're real!

27
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,250
And little by little they're
invading our world--

28
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,000
I swear they are!

29
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:18,458
Still don't believe me...?

30
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,083
Just ask this man if it's true--

31
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:23,750
he was attacked a minute ago
by an Akuma with a top hat!

32
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:25,458
Come on now...

33
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,208
That didn't mean anything.

34
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,250
The kid wouldn't leave me alone

35
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,750
so I kinda played along...

36
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:33,000
I think he got a
little carried away.

37
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:35,833
Just as I thought.

38
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,250
We're not gonna come
running the next time

39
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:38,833
you try to pull
something like this...

40
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:41,000
you hear?!

41
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:44,041
We should go...

42
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,541
Right.

43
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,041
There's no way you
can deceive my eye.

44
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,541
Begone, Akuma!

45
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,333
Hello there... John, was it...?

46
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:18,125
Well, you certainly seem to
know a lot about Akumas, John...

47
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,916
How did you know that--

48
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:22,541
An exorcist...?!

49
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:23,750
I've never seen one...!

50
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:26,000
Did you kill him with an
Anti-Akuma Weapon?!

51
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,375
Oh, will you show it to me...?

52
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:28,666
Will ya?!

53
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,791
Huh...? Y'okay?

54
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,333
My head hurts.

55
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:39,541
I know all about 'em...

56
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,791
My father is a scientist
at the Black Order.

57
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,000
What?

58
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,208
Yeah, and he hasn't
been home to visit us

59
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:45,541
in a really long time...

60
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,708
so I decided to read his
research material one day

61
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:48,916
when I was really bored...

62
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
and I learned all
about the Akuma.

63
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,000
Master Walker...

64
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,333
Sir...

65
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:56,416
Those people we saw
earlier don't know anything.

66
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,500
They don't realize I'm on patrol

67
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:01,458
so I can protect this town
from being invaded by Akuma.

68
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:02,583
You're on patrol?

69
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:04,375
Yeah, I've even got
a partner, too...!

70
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:07,625
His name is Leo and
he's a really great guy!

71
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:10,833
Sir please, you can't
deviate from your orders...

72
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:13,458
We have to get back to
headquarters right away.

73
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:14,500
Oh... we will...

74
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,166
We'll leave in just a bit...

75
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,458
I also do the patrol

76
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:20,250
because I want to
investigate the Akuma, too.

77
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:21,208
Really...?

78
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:22,375
Why would you want to do that?

79
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:23,791
Why do you think...?!

80
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,583
I'm going to be a great
scientist someday, too,

81
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,833
and I'll make weapons
that defeat Akuma

82
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,583
in the blink of an eye!

83
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:32,375
I see... Well, can I
tell you something?

84
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,750
But I'm kinda surprised.

85
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,000
At what?

86
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,250
I just didn't think they
let weak-looking guys

87
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,166
like you become Exorcists.

88
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:41,291
Weak-looking?

89
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:42,958
Well, I thought that
to fight Akuma

90
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,625
they had to be big
and strong...

91
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,791
You know, the opposite of you.

92
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,458
Short stack...

93
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:52,958
I think it's amazing that
they let you be an Exorcist...

94
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:54,250
How did it happen...?

95
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:55,500
Was it really hard...?

96
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,125
D'ja have connections?

97
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,458
Can you just give
me a minute...?

98
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:02,833
So how did you get that
Anti-Akuma Weapon?

99
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:06,333
And when did you first use
it to destroy an Akuma...?

100
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:09,958
Wow, what did that feel like I
mean--were you ever scared...?

101
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:12,666
Have you killed a
lot of them, Allen?

102
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,625
I curse you, Allen!

103
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:29,583
John...

104
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:31,750
I know you mean well
but you've got to stop this.

105
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:32,791
Huh?

106
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,125
This is serious--you
and your friend

107
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:36,416
need to stop
patrolling for Akuma...

108
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,916
You might do something foolish

109
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,875
and if the Millennium Earl
were to set his sights on you...

110
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:43,041
it'd be very bad.

111
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,666
Catch.

112
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,125
What's this?

113
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,875
M... M... My eyes...

114
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:55,875
I invented it myself.
It's an onion bomb!

115
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,125
Sorry, but I can't just stand by

116
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:00,666
and watch Akuma invade
our town, I can't...!

117
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,750
Looks like I'm even
braver than you are, Allen!

118
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:06,541
But I... Fine, I give up.

119
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,250
This wouldn't have happened
if we'd left when we should've.

120
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,875
I know, but I just wanted to...

121
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:14,458
Master, if you're that
worried...

122
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:17,500
I'll ask the Finders posted in
this town to watch over him...

123
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,166
Will that satisfy you?

124
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,333
What?

125
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:21,875
Then you and I can
return to Headquarters.

126
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:24,333
Yes... I appreciate it, Toma.

127
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:32,583
We can't finish...

128
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,583
No way this is getting' done.

129
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,833
It would take a miracle.

130
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:39,708
Uh... excuse me.

131
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:41,625
No more... I can't.

132
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:42,958
There's more where
that came from...

133
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,625
this is just the
tip of the iceburg...

134
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:52,458
Lenalee said that Headquarters
would be home to me...

135
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:54,250
but so far no one's
even said hello

136
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:57,708
or even noticed
that I've come back.

137
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:00,875
Okay, who wants coffee?

138
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,083
--Me.
--I do.

139
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:04,791
Excuse me, Lenalee?

140
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:05,875
What is it?

141
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,416
Well... uh...

142
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,125
I'm not sure what to do with
the Innocence we collected.

143
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,250
Oh, that...!

144
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:13,750
You can just take
it over to Hevlaska

145
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:16,125
and she'll secure
it for you, Allen.

146
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,625
You've come home...

147
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,500
Welcome back, Allen.

148
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:26,750
Thank you...

149
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,708
I'm glad to be back.

150
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:32,375
And Timcanpy...
It's been some time...

151
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,958
Hevlaska, would you please
check this specimen...?

152
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:38,166
I think it has every marking
of real Innocence, agreed?

153
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:44,541
It floated right
through the case!

154
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:47,125
When Innocence arrives
without a partner,

155
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:50,416
it is my responsibility
to keep it secure

156
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,541
until the Genrals return to us.

157
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,500
All in all there are
five generals here

158
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,333
including General Cross.

159
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:59,916
And in addition to pursuing
their own assignments,

160
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
they search for matches
for the Innocence.

161
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:07,666
I think it's amazing that
they let you be an Exorcist...

162
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,958
How did it happen?

163
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,791
How would you like
to be an Exorcist?

164
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,583
Do you see it, Allen?

165
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:19,750
Huh?

166
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:21,958
Wow!

167
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,500
There... Inside
Hevlaska's body...

168
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,625
Exists one hundred
and nine places

169
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:28,041
marked for the
Innocence fragments.

170
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:29,958
You're welcome, Innocence...

171
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:32,500
Safely sleep here
inside my being...

172
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:37,666
til your accommodator arrives
and you become a mighty weapon.

173
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:49,583
Including this one...

174
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:52,583
we've collected forty-one
pieces of Innocence.

175
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,458
There are even more
out in the world,

176
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:57,833
waiting for us to discover them.

177
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,375
Never stop.

178
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,500
Keep walking.

179
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,208
Mana...

180
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:49,833
No wonder I feel so tired...

181
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,041
I really didn't sleep
very well at all...

182
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,875
So much on my mind.

183
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,125
Alright then, you
take care of the rest!

184
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,041
Is something going on?

185
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,166
No, no, it's nothing!

186
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,750
Okay...

187
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,625
Uh, you really don't want to go
into the dining hall right now!

188
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:06,500
Why?

189
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,375
Why... Well... You see...

190
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,958
Jerry was trying out a new
recipe and he burned it...

191
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:14,500
It smells horrible--really,
it's almost unbearable...

192
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:15,500
Oh, no...!

193
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,958
Well, I'm sure
it's not that bad.

194
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:18,875
It's awful and you
can't go in there...

195
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,375
Okay?

196
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:23,833
Why don't I come...
and get you a little later...?

197
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,666
You could just wait in
your room for a bit, right?

198
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:31,041
Sure, I guess.

199
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,083
Hey...

200
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,291
Yes, what do you need?

201
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:35,583
Do you know if anyone

202
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,625
in the Science Section
has a son named John?

203
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,833
Huh...? John?

204
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:58,875
I think you're looking
for Jake Russell.

205
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,625
Russell is on that
pile over there.

206
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:11,833
That wouldn't be wise...!

207
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:13,375
Despite their appearance,

208
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:16,291
every book and piece of paper
is stacked very carefully...

209
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:17,541
One wrong maneuver

210
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:20,000
and the whole pile will
collapse and crush you!

211
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:22,208
Pardon me, but are
you Mr. Russell?

212
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:26,875
Sir, I met your son, John...

213
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:28,708
He and his friend, Leo,
have begun patrolling

214
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:31,083
the town to protect
it against Akuma...

215
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:32,250
I told him that was dangerous

216
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,208
but I think he should
hear it from you.

217
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:35,916
Yes! Exactly!

218
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Sir?

219
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,750
It took me three
whole days to find it...

220
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,208
but I did it...

221
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,541
However, there appears to
be a mistake in this column.

222
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,625
I've wasted a week on this!

223
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,875
I have to start again
from the beginning!

224
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:54,000
Voila, it's done...!

225
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,708
We're all ready for Allen!

226
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,208
Bring that boy down here

227
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:02,208
to properly celebrate the
success of his first assignment!

228
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:03,416
Yeah!!!

229
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,125
We've got a problem...

230
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,916
Has anyone seen Allen lately?!

231
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,041
I'm looking for Master Walker.

232
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:18,875
Yeah... us too.

233
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:19,833
We can't find him...

234
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:22,083
I wonder where he could've gone?

235
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:24,125
I'm almost certain
that Master Walker went

236
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:26,166
to see about a boy named John.

237
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,833
John?

238
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,083
We have to call him
back immediately.

239
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:36,291
He's heading into a
very dangerous situation.

240
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:37,375
I've learned that
one of the Finders

241
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,666
watching the boy
has been killed.

242
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,166
Master John...?!
Someone's here to see you!

243
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:51,458
John... Open the door!

244
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:56,916
Whaddya want?

245
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,375
Leo!

246
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:02,708
Wow, partner, it's so
great to see you...!

247
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:05,208
I haven't gotten to talk to
you since the funeral...

248
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:08,625
So, are you staying
with your relatives now?

249
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:10,833
Oh, and just wait til you hear
what's happened to me...

250
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,625
you won't believe it!

251
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,833
Leo seems different somehow...

252
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:21,083
I'll bet his mother dying
was really hard on him...

253
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:23,750
I wonder if I can do
anything to cheer him up?

254
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,916
Hey, guess what...?

255
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,541
Yesterday I saw a real live
Akuma for the first time!

256
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,958
I even saw the
Millennium Earl's face!

257
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,708
I swear it's true...!

258
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,375
Look, I can draw it.

259
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:41,875
Let's see here, this is like
that... and... his hat...

260
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,416
Lenalee!!!

261
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,916
It makes no sense--

262
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,666
she would never have gone
somewhere without telling me!

263
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,000
Allen isn't the only one--

264
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:52,333
looks like Lenalee
is missing, too...

265
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:55,708
What's going on around here?

266
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,458
We should've had the
party right after Allen

267
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,333
got back but
no one listened!

268
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,416
He's probably
somewehere... crying.

269
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,500
We can hand these out
to people all over town

270
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:08,125
and start patrolling again!

271
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:12,208
John, if you'll come with me,

272
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:15,041
there's a place I'd
like to show you.

273
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,958
He may not believe me,

274
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:21,625
but someone has to
convince him to stop.

275
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:24,708
Yes?

276
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:25,583
Hello...

277
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,583
My name's Allen Walker...

278
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,958
Is John home, by any chance?

279
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,958
Are you one of John's friends?

280
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:33,791
Does he know you're coming?

281
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:41,791
Oh, did you come back to
lecture me some more...?

282
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,416
Well, too bad,
I'm not listening to you!

283
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,500
John!

284
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,291
Come on, Leo!

285
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,375
Hey, John, come back...!

286
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:55,666
Please, John--

287
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:05,166
Is this the place you
wanted me to come see?

288
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:09,000
So like, did you just want to
show me your mother's grave...?

289
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:11,791
You should've said
so before, it's okay.

290
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,333
I'm not scared or anything...

291
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:18,500
Well, good evening, John.

292
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:25,375
It's him...

293
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:27,791
Millennium Earl!

294
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:34,125
Come on, Leo, let's
get out of here now!

295
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:35,333
Leo...?

296
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,208
Come on, what's the
matter with you...?!

297
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:39,500
We have to run away
now or he'll kill us!

298
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,041
Sorry, friend...

299
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,083
Leo's been dead for some time.

300
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:47,958
He died on the day of
his mommy's funeral.

301
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,666
It's so tragic...

302
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,125
and now he's an Akuma
that will punish you

303
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:56,083
for messing up all
my glorious plans!

304
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,708
You lie!

305
00:16:57,791 --> 00:17:01,083
I'm sorry, John,
but it's true...

306
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:07,208
Leo...

307
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,666
Don't fall for it...

308
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,625
He's not your friend anymore...

309
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,333
He's not even human...

310
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:18,375
Now Leo's body is a weapon
for the Millenium Earl.

311
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,541
The boy has a friend, Leo,
whose mother died recently...

312
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,708
Which makes me think that
the Finder watching John

313
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:26,916
was most likely
killed by an Akuma,

314
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,708
that was probably the boy's...

315
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:30,291
Timcanpy...!

316
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,750
Hurry!

317
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,875
And who are you?

318
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:37,833
I am your enemy.

319
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:40,583
Oh, are you an Exorcist...?

320
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:43,541
Well, then, it's a
pleasure to meet you.

321
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,541
The honor is...

322
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:47,416
mine.

323
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:50,750
My Cross...

324
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:52,250
Destroy this Akuma...

325
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,625
...and bring salvation
to his soul!

326
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:00,958
Stop it!

327
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,958
John!

328
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,625
No, you're wrong...

329
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:09,250
It's all gotta be a big
mistake...! Leo is my friend...

330
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:12,000
We were gonna
protect the town...

331
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:14,083
He helped me start
the Akuma patrol...

332
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:15,583
He's not a...

333
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:18,125
Allen, he just
can't be one of them.

334
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:21,041
You can't say things like
that without having any proof!

335
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:30,000
Leo, no...

336
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:31,500
Careful, now...

337
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:36,916
Allen?!

338
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,208
Allen!

339
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,041
Allen got shot...!

340
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:48,375
Oh, no...

341
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:50,375
The Akuma's bullets are
supposed to have a virus

342
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:53,291
or something that
destroys a human's body!

343
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:55,625
Ahhhh, how brave
you are, Exorcist,

344
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:58,666
to jump in front of the
bullets to save the boy--

345
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,750
it's quite remarkable.

346
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:03,333
However, John,
I'm afraid you're turning out

347
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:05,750
to be a terrible annoyance...

348
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,875
While I admire your
passion for justice,

349
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:09,125
you're such a weak little thing

350
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:12,000
with no understanding
of who I am.

351
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:15,166
How truly evil am I,
when all I'm doing

352
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,666
is creating Akuma for
everyone who chooses?

353
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,750
What do you think of my work...?

354
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,708
Do you find it ugly?

355
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:24,708
This is the end
result of sins born

356
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:27,541
from the human
heart, dear boy...

357
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,166
If you thought that
Akuma were weapons

358
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,583
that I fashioned by myself
you're sorely mistaken...

359
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:34,083
They are produced
by the blackness

360
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:37,250
and torment of the
human condition.

361
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,458
This one is no exception...

362
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:43,750
it is an Akuma born
from your friend, Leo.

363
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:44,791
By Leo?

364
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:47,166
With the Earl's power,
Leo was able

365
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,666
to bring his mother's soul
back from death to this world...

366
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:56,375
and she was turned...
into an Akuma.

367
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:59,416
I'm able to see her...

368
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:04,166
Leo's mother is suffering
from this, and in terrible pain.

369
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:06,750
You can see...?

370
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,291
What do you see, you insect,

371
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:11,083
you're supposed to
be dead already.

372
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:16,208
I am a human vessel for
an Anti-Akuma Weapon...

373
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:18,083
I can purify myself.

374
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,958
The virus is going away!

375
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:32,750
Your power is...
impressive... Exorcist.

376
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,875
It's a curse.

377
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,541
A long time ago...

378
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:40,625
Someone I loved became
an Akuma because of me...

379
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:43,083
and because of his
curse my eye can see all

380
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:46,416
of the souls suffering
inside of your dark weapons.

381
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,458
Ahhh, I remember you now...!

382
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:53,833
Yes, indeed-d, I met you
a long time ago, didn't I?

383
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,958
Your name is Allen
Walker, isn't it...?

384
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,958
Aren't you the little
brat who wanted me

385
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:03,291
to bring his dead
daddy back to life?

386
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:06,583
Did Allen turned his own
father into an Akuma?!

387
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:41,583
The Millennium Earl has
finally shown his face...

388
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:44,291
When I see him, I can't help but
think of that horrible day...

389
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:46,250
and everything that happened...

390
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:47,791
I'll never forgive him!

391
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:50,541
On the next episode
of D. Gray-man:

392
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:52,208
"Tombstone of Memories."

393
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:55,833
Bring forth salvation to this
tormented Akuma's soul!
