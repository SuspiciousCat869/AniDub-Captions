00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:49,458
I'm just gonna run outside
and keep watch for a minute!

167
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:53,416
[CHOMESUKE panting]

168
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,833
[CHOMESUKE]
This isn't good...

169
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:58,500
I don't know how much
longer I can last.

170
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:05,500
[HUGE AKUMA]
Evil Star Gita!

171
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:10,458
[JASDERO, DEVIT laughing]

172
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:12,000
Hell of a party!

173
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,083
Think we should join in?

174
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,250
I'm ready!

175
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,166
[MILLENNIUM EARL]
Not so fast, darlings.

176
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,875
You must find Cross
Marian immediately.

177
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:21,541
He's undoubtedly cooking
something up that could dash

178
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:25,000
our well-laid-plans.
Skinn, you'll remain here.

179
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,250
Got it.

180
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,375
Why does he get to stay
and have all the fun?

181
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:31,125
[MILLENNIUM EARL] This attack
on Edo is very suspicious.

182
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:33,625
I have a feeling it was
Cross who arranged it.

183
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:34,958
Furthermore...

184
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,250
I suspect it's a distraction
for his real target:

185
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,166
The Ark.

186
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,250
[DEVIT]
Uh!

187
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:40,625
Wait a minute!
Cross is after the Ark?

188
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,625
Then what gives?
I mean, no offense Earl,

189
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,250
but shouldn't we be getting it
out of Edo as quick as possible

190
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:46,416
instead of waiting around?

191
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,500
The Ark can't be activated.

192
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,541
At least not until
we've transferred

193
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:54,750
the operating system
from the original.

194
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:58,666
Road is working on
that as we speak.

195
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,166
We could help her with that
and speed up the process.

196
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,916
[SKINN]
You can't.

197
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,083
Only The Earl and
Road are qualified

198
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,625
to be the "player" of the Ark.

199
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,833
Since their the eldest Noah,
you two can't touch it.

200
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,250
[DEVIT]
Who asked you, baldy?!

201
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:12,250
I will murder you!

202
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:13,500
Question, boss.

203
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,250
Couldn't the old Ark
leave Edo whenever?

204
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:16,625
Why do we need a new one?

205
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:17,958
[MILLENNIUM EARL] 'Cause of
something that happened

206
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:20,625
long ago. An event
that left our current

207
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:22,958
ship unable to
disconnect from Edo.

208
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,166
[DEVIT]
And why not?

209
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,291
Can't a player make that
sorta thing happen?

210
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,791
A third player
sabotaged the Ark.

211
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,083
One of us?!

212
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,375
You mean a Noah?

213
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,458
That's right. But don't worry.

214
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,583
I killed him.

215
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:39,250
[MILLENNIUM EARL] The only ones
able to operate the Ark

216
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,708
are referred to as "players."

217
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,750
However there was a
traitor among us who

218
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:49,166
passed this secret skill
to an unknown individual.

219
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,833
And now the sole person

220
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:54,083
able to control the ship is
this mysterious apprentice.

221
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,958
Ever since that day,
the Ark has remained in Edo,

222
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:59,916
inoperable, unable
to disconnect.

223
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,291
Regrettably, I was forced
to create a new one

224
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,041
because of these
circumstances.

225
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:07,333
After all, an Ark that falls
into the filthy hands of humans

226
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:10,833
is no longer worthy of
being called our vessel.

227
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:13,833
Which brings us back to
the list I gave to Tyki.

228
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:17,250
And why he's to kill anyone
connected with this Noah.

229
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,750
Surely you see where
I'm goin' with this?

230
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:20,500
[JASDERO, DEVIT]
Uh...

231
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:21,166
Uh...

232
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,250
Uh.

233
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:24,625
[JASDERO]
It has to be Cross!

234
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:25,958
I just know it's him!

235
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:28,416
[DEVIT] Of course!
He was on Tyki's murder list!

236
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,750
He's super powerful!

237
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:30,958
And super arrogant!

238
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,875
I bet it's him,
Lord Millennium!

239
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:35,958
Totally! He has the secret
skills for piloting the Ark!

240
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,625
[MILLENNIUM EARL]
If you're so interested,

241
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,583
maybe you should go find him.

242
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:42,291
What do you think? Should we
go find Cross and kill him?

243
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:43,916
Yep, let's go!

[MIRANDA] I've enveloped
this building in a wall

of frozen time, preventing
any attack from reaching us.

We should be safe from any

Really? Well done, Miranda.

Don't thank me yet.

The effect doesn't last long.

00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:34,916
You've got to hurry and
destroy that Akuma!

Go! And kill every
last one of 'em!

00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,958
I think that one knows
where we're hiding out!

267
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:50,375
We can't stay here!

268
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,041
I'll go and hold him off!

[LENALEE]
I'm coming too.

[BOOKMAN]
No, you're not.

271
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:56,583
[LENALEE]
But... Bookman.

272
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:59,208
It's dangerous to fight when
your legs haven't healed.

273
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:00,541
Remain here, Miss Lena.

274
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,833
The only way you're going
to attack that Akuma

275
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,750
from above is with my boots!

276

[BOOKMAN] It's very possible
your Innocence is the Heart.

277
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,958
Your only job now is to survive.

278
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:11,583
I can still help.

279
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,083
You attack while I distract him.

280
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:14,416
What?

281
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,375
Your initial idea of extending
the hammer towards

282
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,291
that Akuma's head
wasn't bad, Lavi.

283
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:20,708
However, I suggest
diverting his attention

284
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:23,583
so you don't get
knocked off midair.

285
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:24,958
[KRORY]
I concur.

286
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:27,208
You're on the hammer
with me, Krory.

287
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:29,083
I promise I'll let you
suck Akuma blood

288
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,291
to your heart's content.

289
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:32,708
I must say, that's a
plan I can get behind.

290
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:35,291
And what? Bookman
acts as live bait?

291
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:38,083
There's no time to
worry about that!

292
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:41,041
[LENALEE] Aren't you going
to say something, Lavi?

293
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,208
[CHOMESUKE]
I'll carry you up there.

294
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:48,125
Huh?

295
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:49,458
[LENALEE]
Chomesuke...

296
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:51,625
Time's almost up.
I want to stay,

297
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:54,416
but I'm afraid I'm going to have
to leave you all very soon.

298
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,625
[LENALEE]
What?

299
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,125
[CHOMESUKE]
Even though I've been modified,

300
00:14:57,208 --> 00:15:00,583
I'm unable to suppress the urge
to kill humans completely.

301
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,916
And soon, I'll be just
like any other Akuma.

302
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,750
I deserve some praise for
controlling myself this long.

303
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,166
How can we help?

304
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,083
[CHOMESUKE]
You can't.

305
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:12,250
So let me help you.

306
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,416
You can climb up this
ladder to escape.

307
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,875
Stop staring and hurry up!

308
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,125
Oh. Okay.

309
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,208
I have one question.

310
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:24,541
As long as it's quick.

311
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,458
What happens when
your instinctive urge

312
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,458
to kill humans grows too strong?

313
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:32,750
In that event, Cross Marian
modified me to self-destruct.

314
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:36,208
So that's the fate of
an altered Akuma, is it?

315
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:37,666
[BOOKMAN]
If Allen ever finds out

316
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,000
I guarantee he won't
like it one bit,

317
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:43,666
and he won't be
the only one upset.

318
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,375
It's time to go.

319
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,083
Yep.

320
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:01,958
Huh?

00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,375
Do me a favor and give
it to that vampire later.

Wha--?

00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,708
[CHOMESUKE]
Conversion!

324
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:14,833
[CHOMESUKE] Here we go!
Better hold on tight!

325
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:28,666
[LAVI gasps]

326
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,833
[CHOMESUKE groans]

327
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,000
[LAVI]
Chomesuke!

328
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:44,000
It's nothing!

329
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,875
Don't worry about me!

330
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:49,250
[CHOMESUKE groaning]

331
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,333
Stop it! You'll be killed!

332
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,875
[BOOKMAN] Don't let her
sacrifice mean nothing!

333
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:01,041
[LAVI] Sacrifice?
What're you talking about?!

334
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,708
[CHOMESUKE]
I'm happy that I was able

335
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,750
to help you guys one last time.

336
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:05,666
Last time?

337
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,208
What're you planning?

338
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,250
[CHOMESUKE]
This is your chance!

339
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,083
Don't waste this moment, Lavi!

340
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,375
[CHOMESUKE]
Take him out, cho!

341
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:19,916
[gasps]

342
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:28,208
Timcanpy, you should go too.

343
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:32,583
I enjoyed our time
together, Lavi.

344
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:37,916
[ALL gasp]

345
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,458
[MIRANDA gasps]

346
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,000
Chomesuke.

347
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:45,666
[BOOKMAN]
Eyes forward, Lavi.

348
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,625
There's no time to shed tears!

349
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:53,833
She gave her life.

350
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:56,208
It won't be in vain!

351
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:00,875
[BOOKMAN]
That's enough!

352
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:02,333
Now, Lavi!

353
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,583
[LAVI]
Heaven Stamp!

354
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:11,541
[HUGE AKUMA roars]

355
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,375
[LAVI grunts]
We got him!

356
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:29,500
[HUGE AKUMA roaring]

357
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:32,458
[ALL gasp]

358
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:35,041
Oh, no!

359
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,333
What a persistent guy.

360
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:41,666
Our attack wasn't
strong enough.

361
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:45,000
Perhaps. But his head is
far easier to reach now.

362
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,375
[BOOKMAN]
Hm...

363
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,208
We were able to get that
thing on its hands and knees

364
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:49,833
all thanks to Chomesuke.

365
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,958
Let's make sure it
never stands up again.

366
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:54,458
[TYKI]
Think you can do that?

367
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:00,583
[KRORY, BOOKMAN gasp]

368
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:01,958
Don't forget.

369
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,041
We're not done.

370
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:07,916
[KOMUI]
Allen.

371
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,625
Come in.

372
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,083
[ALLEN grunts]

373
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:16,500
[KOMUI] Were you able
to get inside the Ark?

374
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,666
Uh! What the...?

375
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,458
[KOMUI]
Is something the matter?

376
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,041
[ALLEN]
Uh. Well...

377
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,875
I didn't know what to expect,
but this definitely wasn't it.

378
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:32,208
[KOMUI]
Describe what you see.

379
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:33,791
[ALLEN]
I'm in a town.

380
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:36,583
The buildings are white.
Looks sort of Mediterranean.

381
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:37,625
[KOMUI]
How do you feel?

382
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:40,041
I'm okay. I'm gonna explore.

383
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,500
[KOMUI]
Be careful!

384
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,750
And whatever you do,
don't get lost.

385
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,958
[ALLEN]
Uh...

386
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:47,291
Chief Komui?

387
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:48,750
[KOMUI]
Yes?

388
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:51,500
[ALLEN]
Do you think everyone's okay?

389
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,500
[KOMUI]
Whenever you're feeling uneasy,

390
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,875
just think happy thoughts.

391
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:58,750
[ALLEN]
Hm? Happy thoughts?

392
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,000
[KOMUI]
Nothing comes to mind?

393
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:01,291
All right then.

394
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:02,916
How about this?

395
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,083
When everyone comes
back, first thing I'll do

396
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:09,000
is slap them on the back
and welcome them home.

397
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:09,750
[LAVI yelling]

398
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:10,916
[KOMUI]
Then...

399
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,125
I'm going to give Lenalee
a great big hug.

400
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:15,125
After that, I'll make sure
there's a banquet of food

401
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,875
for you to eat. Lavi will
probably just fall asleep

402
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:21,208
on the spot, so I'll throw
a blanket over him.

403
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:24,083
For the adults, I'd like
us to toast with wine.

404
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:25,458
We'll have a large celebration

405
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:28,333
and fall into a
pleasant slumber.

406
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,416
[LAVI panting]

407
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,541
[KOMUI]
And then, once the party's over,

408
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:40,166
Kanda will show up,
grouchy as ever.

409
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:47,375
Couple of large
Akuma over there.

410
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,208
[ALLEN]
Between the overwhelming power

411
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:26,291
of the giant Akuma and Tyki,

412
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:28,791
Lenalee and the others
are forced into a corner.

413
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:32,166
Just when hope seems a lost,
a man carrying a drawn sword

414
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,000
enters the fray and
evens out the odds.

415
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:38,750
On the next <i>D.Gray-man:</i>
"Kanda Joins the Battle!"

416
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:42,833
Bring forth salvation to
this poor Akuma's soul!

417
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:46,916
[KANDA] Couple of large
Akuma over there.

418
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Uh. So you're finally
appearing in actual episodes.

419
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:52,791
[KANDA growls]
What was that?

420
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:54,750
Uh! Nothing.

421
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:56,458
Hey!
