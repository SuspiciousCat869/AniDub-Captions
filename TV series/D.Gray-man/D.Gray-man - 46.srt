1
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:41,750
Well, I'll admit, I was on pins
and needles there for awhile.

2
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:43,791
It was hard to know if
things would turn out well,

3
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:45,458
but thanks to Bookman,
Lenalee's recovered,

4
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:47,541
so I can breathe easy.

5
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:49,291
Ah, that's good to hear...

6
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,791
So, where are she
and the others?

7
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:53,250
They're en route to China

8
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:55,583
and I believe the journey's
been uneventful so far...

9
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:56,916
The last we were contacted

10
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,166
they were about
to cross into Tibet...

11
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,250
Of course I'll want you to
join them as soon as possible.

12
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:03,541
Yes, sir.

13
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:07,208
Good, well, travel safe...
and be very careful.

14
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:14,541
Aww...

15
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:17,333
This is crap...

16
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,541
I want Lenalee's coffee.

17
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:22,375
She knows how to make it right!

18
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:24,916
Well she's not here so
that's obviously impossible...

19
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,375
In fact, Chief,
I'm pretty sure you

20
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:27,666
were the one that sent her away.

21
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,958
I know, but, need, my coffee...

22
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:31,375
This is important.

23
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:34,333
I need you to sign off on
these as soon as possible.

24
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:35,666
How could I forget

25
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,500
that no one makes coffee
like my angel Lenalee...?!

26
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:39,500
Oh man...

27
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:40,875
I hope he gets caffeine soon

28
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:43,083
'cause if it's gonna be
like this 'til she's back...

29
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:44,916
God help us all.

30
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:49,708
If it's true that Lenalee

31
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:51,458
and the others are about
to cross over into Tibet...

32
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:52,541
We should probably hurry

33
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,208
and meet up with them,
don't you think?

34
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:54,916
You're right...

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,083
The information we got

36
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:57,875
from the local
Finders checks out, too...

37
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,125
Now that we know my Master

38
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:01,625
was spotted in China
we can head there.

39
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:02,791
For the sake of the mission,

40
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,583
the sooner we join
our friends the better.

41
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:06,416
Well then, let's be off...

42
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,041
Tibet, here we come!

43
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,958
Wait a minute, before we go
I think we should find a guide.

44
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,291
Do we need one?

45
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:13,458
The best way for us to get

46
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,708
to Tibet from Nepal
is to probably cross

47
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:18,250
the Himalayas over there,
which could be rough.

48
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,000
I asked the people
at the hotel about it

49
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:21,458
and they all thought
it'd be too dangerous

50
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:24,166
for us to try to cross the
mountains by ourselves...

51
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,666
if we're gonna do it,

52
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,458
they said we should hire a
professional Sherpa to lead us.

53
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:35,958
But, why not?

54
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,500
Because it's not safe...

55
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,666
it's not a good time
to try to cross over...

56
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,250
I know the weather
looks clear right now

57
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,500
but there's a storm coming.

58
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,083
If you wanna make it
pass to the other side

59
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:47,666
alive you should wait
'til it passes through.

60
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,333
How long will that take?

61
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:52,625
Three days, a week,
maybe even ten days if it's bad.

62
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:53,875
Ten days...?!

63
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:56,708
But we can't make our
friends wait that long!

64
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:59,083
Plus, we know Master's
in China right now...

65
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:01,333
but he could easily
disappear again.

66
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:07,750
Uh, why are you
looking at me like that?

67
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:09,625
Because I found one.

68
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,291
I found a Sherpa to lead us!

69
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:14,083
Here...!

70
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:16,541
His name is Amyl
and he obligingly agreed

71
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:19,166
to take us over the
mountains into Tibet.

72
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,750
Oh, really?

73
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,541
But, the weather...

74
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,166
That man said we
shouldn't leave right now

75
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,416
'cause it's going to
get dangerous up there.

76
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,458
Well, it's always dangerous,
but I know a shortcut...

77
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:33,458
we should be able to pass the
ridge before it gets too bad.

78
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,166
It could be our best chance...!

79
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,958
I think we should
hurry and go now

80
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:39,291
or I'm afraid we'll miss our
rendezvous with the others.

81
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:41,041
Yeah... guess you're right.

82
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:47,625
Ah, there's plenty of food
in our packs for the journey.

83
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:50,000
So I think we should
all be set to head out...!

84
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:52,791
Come on men, to Tibet!

85
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:53,875
You might wanna slow down.

86
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,541
We need to be
careful on these paths.

87
00:04:55,625 --> 00:05:00,375
Oh, don't worry about me,
Allen, I'll be fine--

88
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:04,166
See, what did I tell you,
you gotta watch out...!

89
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,041
Are you okay...?

90
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:08,083
Watch your step there...

91
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,291
Look how excited they
are to climb the mountain.

92
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:13,125
Too bad they'll never come down.

93
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:16,208
We'll finally be rid
of these Exorcists.

94
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:20,041
It's a brilliant plan...
Madame Lulu Bell.

95
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:31,875
We still have a long way to
travel before we reach China...

96
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:33,666
and I've been reminded
that we can't afford

97
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,208
to rest until we
locate General Cross.

98
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:37,666
He's a slippery one...

99
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,041
I really hope we meet up
with Allen and Krory soon...

100
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,875
that way we can all focus
on finding the General.

101
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:44,833
If he decides to take off
and go missing again...

102
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:48,166
it'd be too bad if we came
all this way for nothing.

103
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,916
Well, I know Komui
talked to them

104
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,458
and he said if
everything goes well

105
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:53,333
they should be
arriving here soon.

106
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:54,875
For all we know
they could have gotten

107
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:56,500
to town ahead of us...

108
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:58,000
We should hurry.

109
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,541
It's getting so cold!

110
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:13,250
When we were in the
foothills it felt like spring...

111
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,250
but it's getting nasty up here.

112
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,583
I hate to say it,

113
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,750
but I think that first man
we talked to was right.

114
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:20,416
We need to hurry.

115
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,833
I thought you said
this was a shortcut...

116
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:34,208
Didn't you say
if we followed you,

117
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:35,666
then we'd be able
to pass the ridge

118
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,875
before the weather
got rough like this!

119
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:39,416
Krory, please...!

120
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,708
We were the ones who
asked him to be our guide...

121
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,583
But it's--

122
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:46,041
Come on, let's keep going...

123
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,500
If the weather gets
much worse than this,

124
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:50,208
we are going to find
ourselves stuck up here.

125
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:01,750
He could be right...

126
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,958
how do we know this
is really a shortcut?

127
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,750
Oh, it's all my fault again...

128
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:09,541
I pressured Amyl into
bringing us up here...

129
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:11,250
If I hadn't asked him--

130
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:16,875
Krory, I've got you...!

131
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,875
Hang on, I'm gonna pull you up!

132
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:39,541
You... You saved me,
Allen, thank you!

133
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:42,208
We've got to keep
moving, alright...?

134
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:44,791
We have to cross the
ridge as fast as possible.

135
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,291
Did you hear me, Krory?

136
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:51,708
Come on, get up...

137
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:54,166
We'll make it through this...

138
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,041
What's the matter, you
didn't get injured, did you?

139
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:59,166
I think it happened
when I fell...

140
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,833
My foot hit the
rock pretty hard.

141
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:04,583
Please don't worry, I'm sure
it's nothing very serious...

142
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:07,208
In time, it'll heal
and be as good as new

143
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:09,250
so you should
probably go on ahead.

144
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,166
What are you talking about...?!

145
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,041
No way!

146
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,750
I'd never leave you here alone!

147
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,875
Oh, I'll be fine, Allen...

148
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:17,041
Think of the mission.

149
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,500
It's very important
that you get across

150
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,791
these mountains to find Lenalee
and the others...

151
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,500
They'll be terribly
worried if no one shows up.

152
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:24,666
I won't do it...!

153
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,125
Krory, I'm not going
to leave you behind!

154
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:28,125
Can't you see I don't want

155
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,791
to bring you any
more trouble...?!

156
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,750
You could have been
killed in that fall,

157
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,666
and all because
of my foolishness.

158
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,041
Forget about it, look at us.

159
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,625
We're both just fine.

160
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:37,791
Look, if you don't
think you can walk

161
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:40,000
on it then come here
and let me help you,

162
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:43,541
'cause there no way I'd ever
abandon a friend like that.

163
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,875
I'll be fine. I'm used
to being alone...

164
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:50,083
You forget that I used to spend
all my time alone in the castle.

165
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:54,083
At least until Eliade
appeared to me.

166
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,333
When I discovered
my love was an Akuma,

167
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:59,250
and destroyed her,
my life changed forever...

168
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:00,458
I became an Exorcist

169
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,250
and a member of the Black Order,

170
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,416
and gained many dear friends...

171
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,208
But I'm so naïve that
my thoughtlessness

172
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:09,250
has caused trouble
and put others in danger.

173
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,458
I just can't seem to
keep up with everyone else

174
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:14,458
and I don't want to
burden you any longer.

175
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,250
Don't be ridiculous. Let it go!

176
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,541
You've got to get up now...

177
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:19,625
We're leaving here together

178
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:21,083
and our friends
are waiting for us...

179
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,625
Lenallee, Lavi, and
Bookman will wanna see you.

180
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:26,333
But I'll just hold you back,
Allen, I know I will!

181
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:28,666
I'm gettin' mad... Stop it!

182
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:32,125
It won't work...

183
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:34,083
If we keep going
we'll be in big trouble.

184
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:37,000
Wait, so if we wanna make it,
we have to leave Krory here?!

185
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:39,375
No...

186
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:40,458
We all have to stay.

187
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:41,666
Wha-?

188
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,541
We should stop before
it gets any worse...

189
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,041
If we dig a hole now,

190
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:47,875
we can all wait there until
the storm passes over us...

191
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:49,458
A hole?

192
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:52,125
A tent would never
stay up in this wind...

193
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:54,416
Understand, we need to hurry...

194
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,416
Excuse me, it's mine.

195
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,875
No, it's mine...

196
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:09,000
I believe I saw you eating
an extra piece a minute ago.

197
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,750
You saw wrong. I didn't!

198
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:11,541
You did, too!

199
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:12,708
Well, fine...!

200
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:13,916
Crybaby...

201
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,041
Why, how dare you.

202
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,416
I thought you were
worried about me...!

203
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,208
And yet you'll let
me starve to death!

204
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:20,500
This doesn't mean
I don't care...

205
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,083
Actually...

206
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,291
I didn't consider
that we might have

207
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,500
to spend a few days
in here... and now...

208
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:40,375
This biscuit's the
only food we have left.

209
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,875
Crap, I'm so stupid...!

210
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,291
What are we gonna do now?!

211
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,416
Everything's ready on our end...

212
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,541
You can start any time...

213
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:54,125
Madame Lulu Bell.

214
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,375
Hey, about what
you said earlier...

215
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:09,458
You've never been a
burden to any of us, okay...?

216
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:12,458
Please believe me.

217
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,625
As a matter of fact,
everyone was so excited

218
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:17,583
when you became an
Exorcist and joined us...

219
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:21,625
...me, Lenalee, Lavi, Bookman,
and everyone else at the Order.

220
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:25,541
We've considered
you family ever since.

221
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:29,750
Three cheers for the Order's
newest member, Arystar Krory...!

222
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,083
Hip hip hooray!

223
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,500
Here's to Krory...

224
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:37,583
Uh... It's... good to be home!

225
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,083
Because we really are family,

226
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:43,000
we're going to cause
problems sometimes

227
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:45,083
and worry about each other.

228
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:46,500
But no matter what's happening

229
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,750
to us we'll always
stick together...

230
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,833
I mean, that's what a
family is for, isn't it...?

231
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:54,875
So don't talk about being a
burden or ask me to leave--

232
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,416
Hey, are you sleeping?!

233
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,083
Krory, wake up...!

234
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,500
Snap out of it,

235
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,833
if you fall asleep you're
gonna freeze to death...!

236
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,041
Come on...

237
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,708
Wake up, you have to
freakin' wake up now!

238
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:17,750
I can't... fall asleep yet...

239
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:22,000
I've got to... stay awake...

240
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:35,500
I wonder how long
I've been sleeping...

241
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:41,791
What's that... Is it...

242
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,958
How could Eliade
have gotten here?!

243
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:51,083
Wait!

244
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:55,916
Eliade... please
wait, don't go...!

245
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,208
Eliade... Eliade!

246
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:02,666
It is you!

247
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,583
Could it be an illusion...?

248
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:07,708
Perhaps I'm just dreaming now...

249
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,541
I'm wide awake...!

250
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:13,416
Then she really is here...

251
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:20,375
Eliade... thank you
for coming back to me...

252
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:22,750
I'm so happy to see you.

253
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:23,916
Forgive me my darling

254
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,375
but I'm so glad you
didn't forget me...

255
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:29,166
I've missed you
so... dear Eliade.

256
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:33,375
Please, won't
you speak to me...?

257
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:36,541
Say something and let
me hear your sweet voice.

258
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,375
Grandfather?!

259
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:48,291
What?

260
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:52,083
He's, an illusion...

261
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,458
Then Eliade must have been...

262
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,458
What's happening to me?

263
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:25,375
Mana?!

264
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,958
Mana!

265
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:32,750
Where did he go?!

266
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:40,333
It's impossible. I brought
salvation to his soul!

267
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:42,541
There's no way he could
come back to life...!

268
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:45,125
Someone's creating
an illusion for me...

269
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:46,833
Is it an Akuma?

270
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,083
Master!

271
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:51,166
You can't fool me...

272
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,958
I know you're an illusion!

273
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:06,333
Why would my
grandfather appear to me?

274
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:11,458
Lavi...! Oh, have
you come to rescue us?!

275
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,666
Thank heavens you're
here my friend...

276
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,416
I've started to go crazy
since I saw you last!

277
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,291
What... the soba noodle man...!

278
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,000
I hate Wasabi horseradish!

279
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:24,958
Lenalee?

280
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,291
I know it's not the real one...

281
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:28,958
but the body is solid
which means it must be...

282
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,375
Noah!

283
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:32,291
So that's it...!

284
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:34,291
Amyl is one of the Noah clan...!

285
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:36,958
And this was all just
a trap set to catch us.

286
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:38,375
Am I right?!

287
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,666
Wait!

288
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,250
Could that voice be...

289
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:45,958
Allen!

290
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:47,333
It is you!

291
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,250
It's a miracle, I was afraid
I was losing my mind...

292
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:52,666
You were right, I don't ever
want to be left alone out here!

293
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:56,750
Watch out, he's a fake!

294
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:59,125
There are two... Allens?

295
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,875
And he might also
be the same one

296
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:03,416
who showed up as Lenalee
to try to trick us...!

297
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,375
Get away from him!

298
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:15,125
Wha... Which one is--?!

299
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:15,916
Me...!

300
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,666
I'm the real Krory, Allen!

301
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,041
How can I know?

302
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,541
Don't listen to him...!

303
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:23,708
Can't you tell that I'm the
one and only Arystar Krory?!

304
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,500
Well, it doesn't really matter.

305
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:32,666
The real Krory has turned out

306
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,791
to be such a
headache to us all...

307
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:37,333
I might as well
wipe you both out!

308
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,625
You... You were really thinking
about me that way, Allen...

309
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,333
that I'm such a burden
to you and the others?

310
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,083
I knew it, I knew
I was a failure!

311
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:47,583
I told you before, that
I'm not worth saving...

312
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:50,666
Kill me, I have
no reason to live!

313
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:52,583
Uh...

314
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:55,125
I'd rather die than be
such a miserable wretch!

315
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,291
You're the fake!

316
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,333
Stop!

317
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:02,166
Damn... it disappeared.

318
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,541
The Akuma have
shown up, Krory...!

319
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,958
Hey, did you hear me,
get up and fight!

320
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:16,166
I just don't care anymore!

321
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,541
Yes, you do...!

322
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:18,708
Get up!

323
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:25,833
Akuma?!

324
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:29,333
Watch out!

325
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:31,666
Allen!

326
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,541
It's no big deal...

327
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,791
Just a little scratch.

328
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,125
Why even bother
trying to save my life...

329
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:39,291
when I'm really not
worth all the trouble.

330
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,583
Would stop it,
of course you are!

331
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:44,625
When we lost General Yeegar,
I made up my mind.

332
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:47,875
I'll fight... because if
I can't protect my family

333
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:50,333
I have no business
being an Exorcist.

334
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,125
Allen...

335
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:58,333
Watch this...!

336
00:17:58,416 --> 00:17:59,458
I've got 'em now!

337
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:02,583
Huh?!

338
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,333
What do we do now?

339
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:21,000
We gotta move!

340
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,375
Yeah!

341
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:23,500
Allen!

342
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:40,833
What happened?

343
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:42,833
I think they were crushed
by the avalanche...!

344
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:45,250
It got the Akuma, too.

345
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,458
You finally took
them out, Madame!

346
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,083
Where am I?

347
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,958
Llhasa... in the
capitol of Tibet.

348
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,041
Lenalee...

349
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,958
But how did you guys find us?

350
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,333
Actually, you should thank Tim.

351
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:33,833
Timcanpy saved us?!

352
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:34,958
He sure did...

353
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,166
We thought you two
should've been here

354
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,375
by now so we decided
to go looking for ya...

355
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:39,875
it didn't take us
long to run into him

356
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,791
and then he led us
right back to you

357
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:45,458
and Krory laying there
passed out on top of the snow.

358
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,625
Thank you so much, Tim!

359
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:48,166
Hey, wait...

360
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,791
where's Krory?

361
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,333
Oh, I'm right here.

362
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,666
I'm so glad you're
finally awake.

363
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,833
It appears two comrades had
a hand in saving your life...

364
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:59,041
Soon after you were
buried in the avalanche,

365
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:00,500
Krory used the
last of his strength

366
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:02,041
to pull you out of the snow...

367
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,375
If he hadn't acted,

368
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,541
you'd both certainly be
frozen to death by now...

369
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:08,375
You owe him your
thanks, too... Allen.

370
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,416
Thank you...

371
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,541
You really came
through for us...

372
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:14,458
I'm very... very grateful.

373
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:15,583
Well...

374
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:16,375
I just thought that
family's supposed

375
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:18,000
to help each other out...

376
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,541
No thanks are needed.

377
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,166
I don't mean to get all
sentimental on you guys

378
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:25,083
but I gotta say I'm really glad
we're back together again...

379
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:26,833
Yeah, and now we
can finally get back

380
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:28,541
to our mission, right?!

381
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:29,333
Right...

382
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,208
I'm looking forward to it.

383
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,458
So they survived after all.

384
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:42,458
Those stupid Exorcists
must have the devil's luck!

385
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,625
It is unfortunate
they weren't killed...

386
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:47,333
however...
we did delay them.

387
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,208
My task was to
hinder their plans

388
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:53,125
to locate Cross by
complicating the journey...

389
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:55,458
and that was
successfully achieved.

390
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:57,708
Even if they do
manage to get to China,

391
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:01,125
they won't be able
to find him there.

392
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:03,250
He'll be gone by then.

393
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:43,208
In a town where the water supply
has mysteriously dried up,

394
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:45,833
we encounter a
remarkable girl...

395
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:52,500
Next time on
D. Gray-man: "The Crystal Girl."

396
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:56,333
Bring forth salvation to this
tormented Akuma's soul!
