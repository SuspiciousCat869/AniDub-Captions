1
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:43,333
[heartbeats]

2
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:45,000
[ALLEN]
Beating...

3
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:53,541
[ALLEN]
I swear... I can hear it...

4
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:55,583
I'm alive?

5
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:10,291
[ALLEN]
How is it possible?

6
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:12,958
There's no way I survived.

7
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:15,875
[ALLEN]
He pierced my heart.

8
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:18,750
I'm certain that Noah killed me.

9
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:21,416
I remember the
sensation so clearly.

10
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,833
The blood draining out of me.

11
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:25,958
My life slipping away.

12
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:29,708
A terrible,
overwhelming feeling.

13
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:33,166
It was death! I'm sure of it!

14
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:41,916
[ALLEN grunting]

15
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,125
[ALLEN]
Why can't I stop crying?

16
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:49,916
Am I happy to be alive?

17
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,250
Or do I regret it? I don't know.

18
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,750
Why can't I stop shaking?

19
00:02:58,333 --> 00:02:59,916
[ALLEN]
Mana!

20
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:04,916
[WONG panting]

21
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,291
Hang on tight, Allen Walker!

22
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:10,625
Wong is on his way to
change your bandages

23
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:14,208
before Director Bak gets
a chance to yell at him!

24
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:18,166
[LI KEI] Hmm, wonder where
Wong's rushing off to.

25
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,208
[SHIFU] He's probably caring
for that Exorcist Fo brought in.

26
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:23,208
I hear he's seriously injured.

27
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:25,916
Yeah, I happened to hear
somebody talking about him.

28
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,791
Apparently he's young,
like only 15 or so.

29
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,875
It's pretty shocking
to think kids that age

30
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,541
are fighting for the Order.

31
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:35,541
Exorcists sure have it rough,
don't they?

32
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,666
[WONG growls]

33
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:49,625
I fell asleep, and when
I woke up he was gone.

34
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:51,791
I really didn't mean to.

35
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,333
Don't look at me like that!

36
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:56,916
He was so injured I thought
there was no way he could move.

37
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,958
Wait!

38
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,916
[WONG panting]

39
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,041
That poor boy.
Walking in his condition.

40
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:05,750
Allen Walker!

41
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:10,583
[BAK] We did what we could
for now to treat him, Komui.

42
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:13,041
[KOMUI]
I appreciate it. Thank you.

43
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:15,916
[BAK] I've met several Parasite
Type Exorcists in the past

44
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,708
and I've never seen
anything like this.

45
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,500
Did you know about it?

46
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,833
[KOMUI] I confess I felt
there was something special

47
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:23,833
about his Anti-Akuma Weapon.

48
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:27,416
But I never expected
this miracle to happen.

49
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,625
[BAK]
So it's a miracle, huh?

50
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:32,375
The most remarkable part is
the will of the Innocence

51
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:34,958
trying to keep him alive.

52
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,583
There's no reason he
shouldn't be dead

53
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:39,166
after an injury to
his heart that severe.

54
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,000
But the particles of his
Innocence repaired it,

55
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,750
resuscitated him.

56
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:45,708
They're refusing to let him die.

57
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:48,833
Bottom line, his Innocence
was shattered into pieces

58
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:51,208
and probably wasn't
even activated.

59
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,166
Yet, those particles entered his
body and transformed into cells

60
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,708
to cover the open wound.

61
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,125
Then it's true.

62
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:59,416
Even after being destroyed
and losing its usual form,

63
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,416
Allen's Innocence
continues to exist. Good.

64
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,666
[WONG panting]

65
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,916
[WONG] Allen! Where are you,
Allen Walker?!

66
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,250
Strange. Now he's
headed the other way.

67
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,750
[SHIFU]
Perhaps the patient has left,

68
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,750
but I wonder why he'd do that.

69
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,416
It's quite understandable.

70
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,333
When a child suffers
a traumatic event

71
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:19,041
they don't want to feel trapped.

72
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,041
[FO] Have you guys
seen that Exorcist?

73
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:22,375
Allen Walker.

74
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:23,750
[SHIFU]
No, I haven't.

75
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,125
[LO FWA] Me either, but I'd
really love to meet him.

76
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,958
[growls] I wasn't asking!
Go find him!

77
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:31,250
[LI KEI]
Yeah, I'll get right on it!

78
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:38,208
[MANA]
Keep walking. Never stop!

79
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:42,625
[ALLEN]
Mana. I made a pledge to you.

80
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:47,291
No matter what I wouldn't give
up. I'd keep moving forward.

81
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:51,000
But, where am I headed?

82
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:09,791
[BAK] It won't open.
No matter how hard you push.

83
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,583
[ALLEN gasps]

84
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:15,250
What business do you
have here anyway?

85
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,583
It wasn't planned.

86
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:19,750
I was wandering and entered
the room by chance.

87
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:22,750
So there isn't any way to
open up this sealed door?

88
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,583
[BAK]
There isn't, trust me.

89
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,583
Why don't you turn back around?

90
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:29,916
Besides, what reason do you
have to want go in there?

91
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,666
[ALLEN]
I refuse to stop.

92
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,416
I just have to keep
moving forward.

93
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,125
[BAK]
Even without your left arm?

94
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:37,666
[ALLEN gasps]

95
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,208
Don't take it the wrong way.
I wasn't trying to offend you.

96
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:43,083
I'm simply asking
out of curiosity.

97
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:45,750
Who are you? And where are we?

98
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,666
[BAK]
Black Order, Asian Branch.

99
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm its Director.
The name's Bak Chang.

100
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:52,291
[ALLEN gasping]

101
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,750
[BAK] I got an idea,
Allen Walker. How's this?

102
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:57,208
You could work as
an office clerk here.

103
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,541
[ALLEN]
What?

104
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,166
[BAK] You know, there are
several different ways

105
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,708
to support the Black Order.

106
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,166
[ALLEN]
Uh?

107
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,166
[BAK]
Jobs other than Exorcist.

108
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,541
As you said, it's time for you
to move on and find a new path.

109
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:11,208
Yes, I'm sure we can
find you something.

110
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:12,666
What do you say?

111
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:17,000
If you do that, I know
God won't punish you.

112
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,375
[ALLEN]
God?

113
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,166
I don't care what
God thinks anymore.

114
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,250
[BAK]
Hm.

115
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:30,458
[ALLEN grunts]

116
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:33,000
I made a pledge!
To follow my own free will!

117
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,750
I can't go back on it!

118
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:38,166
I made a promise to myself
to destroy Akuma!

119
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,333
I swore to fight
alongside my comrades!

120
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:44,416
I promised I would
save this world!

121
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,583
[ALLEN grunts]

122
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,458
And to my father I
pledged to keep walking,

123
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:49,833
moving forward until I died!

124
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:52,208
[ALLEN sobs]

125
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:55,750
[ALLEN]
Open up! Damn you!

126
00:07:55,833 --> 00:08:01,541
Why won't you open? I have
to keep following this path!

127
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:04,416
It's the only way I can live.

128
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,666
[BAK]
I've seen enough.

129
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,375
[BAK]
Allen Walker.

130
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:18,708
You'll be pleased to know
your Innocence isn't dead.

131
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:21,500
[ALLEN gasping]

132
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:24,416
Apologies. I had to wait
before telling you.

133
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,541
It was the only way to
be absolutely certain

134
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,666
of how you felt.

135
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,166
Please, understand.

136
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,750
You've learned about
the Fallen Ones

137
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,541
and have tasted
suffering and death.

138
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,291
I didn't know if you
were willing to return

139
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:38,375
to the battlefield or not.

140
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:41,833
I wanted to prevent
anyone else from Falling.

141
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:44,666
Still, saying you don't
care about God's wrath?

142
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,916
I think you were going a
little too far with that one.

143
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,166
[ALLEN]
Heh.

144
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,791
Follow me. Wong needs
to change your bandages

145
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:55,083
and is probably in tears from
not being able to find you.

146
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:57,541
[WONG sobbing]

147
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,750
[FO] Don't cry, Wong!
We'll find him.

148
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:03,375
What do you say we go
look over there? Okay?

149
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,291
[BAK] And Once that's done
we can talk about how

150
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,958
we're going to restore
that arm of yours.

151
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:09,416
[ALLEN]
What?

152
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,375
Restore it?

153
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:12,708
My left arm.

154
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:14,791
You're saying there's
some way to bring it back?

155
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:15,791
That's right.

156
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,166
You're serious?!

157
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,083
It's cold here.
Let's go talk somewhere else.

158
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:22,166
[FO] Ah, ha! Finally
found you, ya jerk!

159
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,125
And just what the hell do you
think you're doing outta bed?

[groans]

162
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:32,500
I don't care if
you're an Exorcist!

163
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,583
While you're here you don't do
anything without permission!

164
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:35,458
Got it?!

165
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:36,750
The least you could have done

166
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,375
was introduce yourself
when you woke up,

167
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:39,750
but you snuck off!

168
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,416
I'm the one who had to carry
your almost-dead butt

169
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,458
outta the forest!
Where's my thanks?

170
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,083
[ALLEN]
Uh...

171
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:47,916
If you're talking to him why
the hell'd ya have to kick me?!

172
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,416
Right now! Stop delaying
and introduce yourself.

173
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,208
Huh?! You're ignoring me?
Who do you think you are?!

174
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:57,166
[WONG] Calm down, Chief Bak!
She didn't mean it!

175
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:01,250
Um, I'm sorry I never said
thank you for rescuing me.

176
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,250
I'm Allen.

177
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,166
That's Fo.

178
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,000
She's the Guardian that watches
over the Asian Branch.

179
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,583
And you can call me Wong,

180
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,625
Director Bak's
second in command.

181
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:14,458
It brings me joy to see you're
feeling better, Allen.

182
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:16,083
Up and about.

183
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:20,750
[BAK panting]

184
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:23,500
[ALLEN]
Thank you all very much.

185
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:29,375
For everything you've
done to help me.

186
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:33,333
I'm truly grateful.
With all my heart.

187
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:35,250
[WONG chuckles]

[FO laughs]

189
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm serious!

190
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,750
[LI KEI]
Uh, sorry to interrupt.

191
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:50,208
[SHIFU] But we were hoping
to meet our new guest.

192
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:54,250
Where is this young Exorcist
we've been hearing about?

193
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:55,458
[LO FWA, LI KEI, SHIFU]
Uh?!

194
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:57,083
Guess that would be me.

195
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:59,416
[gasping]

196
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,708
That guy's not a kid.

197
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,416
Oh. Thanks a lot.

198
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,291
[clears throat] Hey. I'm Li Kei
from the Science Division.

199
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:11,750
Over here is Shifu.

200
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:12,333
[SHIFU]
Greetings.

201
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:13,208
And this--

202
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:14,416
My name's Lo Fwa!

203
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,583
And I'm a scientist in training.

204
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,708
Hi. It's a pleasure.

205
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:21,000
[LO FWA gasping]

206
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:24,291
[LI KEI] So, what do you
want us to do, chief?

207
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:27,375
[BAK] Start by checking Allen
Walker's physical condition.

208
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:29,500
Let me know if there
are any problems.

209
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:32,833
If he's clear, we'll
revive his Innocence.

210
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:37,875
I'll conduct the exam!

211
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:55,583
[ALLEN] It'll be all right. Just
keep walking. Isn't that right?

212
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:56,750
Mana.

213
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:58,541
[LO FWA]
Uh, uh...

214
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:03,708
[SHIFU]
It's unbelievable!

215
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,791
I mean we can't say
it's perfect yet,

216
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:08,125
but we don't see any
problems with your heart.

217
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,458
[SHIFU] At this rate you
can begin training soon.

218
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,208
I'm so relieved you're okay!

219
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,083
Thank you.

220
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,291
Whatcha havin', short stack?

221
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:22,166
Uh, let me see. I'll start with
the rice omelet, spaghetti,

222
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:25,083
pork cutlet, Hamburg steak,
curry and rice, fried rice,

223
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,000
and chicken on the side, please.

224
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:28,958
Look at him go!

225
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,916
He must be on the verge
of a growth spurt!

226
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,750
Or is it because he's a
Parasite type Exorcist?

227
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,000
[SHIFU]
Mm-hm.

228
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:37,416
[ALLEN sighing]

229
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,958
Those appetizers were great!

230
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,875
[LI KEI]
Well, you no longer need IVs.

231
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:45,291
So just relax and take it easy.

232
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,916
[LO FWA] And don't hesitate
to ask if you need anything!

233
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,791
[ALLEN]
Um. There's something.

234
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,375
Sure! Just name it!

235
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:56,583
I want to start training as soon
as possible to restore my arm.

236
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:57,916
[LI KEI]
Look...

237
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,458
We get that you're probably
feeling restless.

238
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:02,375
[SHIFU] But the chief said you
needed rehabilitation first.

239
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:05,583
[LI KEI] Yeah. Try to think of
this as a much needed vacation.

240
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:08,458
Right now my comrades are
fighting Akuma while I'm here!

241
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,875
Doing nothing!
You have to help me!

242
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,791
[ALL]
Uh! Mm...

243
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,958
So Allen Walker's
anxious to begin training

244
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:24,416
to revive his Innocence?

245
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,958
That's correct.

246
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:28,333
I don't understand why he's
so eager to continue fighting.

247
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,833
It's actually kind of
painful to watch.

248
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:32,375
From what I hear of his past,

249
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:35,250
Walker had a foster father
by the name of Mana,

250
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:37,291
but he was turned into an Akuma.

251
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:38,166
[LO FWA]
What?

252
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,750
Not only was Allen responsible,

253
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:43,291
he then proceeded to kill Mana
with his Anti-Akuma Weapon.

254
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:46,125
[MANA screams]

255
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,583
[BAK] Furthermore, he
encountered a Fallen One.

256
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,750
A Fallen One?

257
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,125
[BAK]
It's the out-of-control state

258
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,583
those who betray
Innocence fall into.

259
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,458
After all that,
it's by his own will

260
00:13:57,541 --> 00:14:01,083
that he insists on
reviving his Innocence.

261
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:05,541
There's only one path for him.
I'm afraid he has no choice.

262
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:08,958
He's destined to live
with his Innocence.

263
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:10,666
We've already kept him
waiting too long.

264
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,750
His training starts immediately.

265
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:15,833
Retrieve Allen Walker
right away.

266
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:17,375
Yes sir!

267
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:22,625
Is what you're proposing
even feasible?

268
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:23,916
We've never had a case

269
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,666
where we could successfully
revive Innocence.

270
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,416
[BAK]
Honestly, I don't know.

271
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,833
However, we do know the
Innocence saved his life.

272
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:35,291
And to me, that indicates
its will remains intact.

273
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,708
[WONG]
Hm...

274
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:39,791
[BAK] The trick is getting
those two wills to merge.

275
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,333
[SCIENTISTS chattering]

276
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,208
[LI KEI] I wonder if he's really
strong enough to start again.

277
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:48,500
The best we can do is
give him our support!

278
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,000
I'll be cheering him on!

279
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,208
Me, too.

280
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,458
[WONG] Our predecessors
dug out this cavern

281
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:56,333
in order to construct
our vast hidden sanctuary.

282
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:58,500
It's already larger
than headquarters

283
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,916
and we continue to add
more space daily.

284
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,333
So don't go wandering
by yourself, Walker.

285
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:06,333
Or else, you could end up like
a certain someone who got lost

286
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:08,500
for two weeks and
nearly starved to death.

287
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:10,000
[ALLEN gasps]

288
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:13,083
[ALLEN] Thanks for the warning.
I tend lose my way easily.

289
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:15,750
[BAK] Enough of this idle
chit-chat! Keep up!

290
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,500
[BAK]
We're here. Let's go in.

291
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,750
[ALLEN]
What's this room filled with?

292
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,208
Smoke?

293
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:43,791
No, it's too thin. It's more
like some kind of fog.

294
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,458
What you're seeing
is the Innocence

295
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:47,125
that used to be your left arm.

296
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,291
[ALLEN gasping]

297
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:51,833
That's what this is?

298
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,833
Neither fog nor smoke.

299
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:57,875
The Innocence lost its shape
and was reduced to particles.

300
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,666
[ALLEN gasps]

301
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,750
[BAK] It's strange.

302
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,458
Typically when Innocence
is destroyed,

303
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:04,458
it disappears and
is lost forever.

304
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:06,708
However, yours seems
to behave differently.

305
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,375
It continues to live on.

306
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,791
Far from vanishing, it
chose to save your life.

307
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,375
Even though its shape is lost,

308
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:15,708
it continues to be a
crystallization of God's power.

309
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:18,166
When I was carrying you back
from the bamboo forest,

310
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,458
this stuff was swirling all
around you and never left,

311
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:22,041
like it was protecting you.

312
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,375
[FO groaning]

313
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,500
[FO] I could barely
find my way through it.

314
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:28,250
It's a miracle we made it back.

315
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:32,291
After being reduced to dust,
my Innocence continues to live?

316
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,833
How? It doesn't seem possible.

317
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:37,625
Unfortunately, our science
can't supply an answer.

318
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:38,958
Even more surprising,

319
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,500
it seems to be even beyond
Komui's understanding.

320
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,708
He did have a theory,

321
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:46,166
but it wasn't his usual
pragmatic approach.

322
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,541
I'm not sure.

323
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:49,541
But I get the feeling
there's something special

324
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:51,458
about Allen Walker.

325
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:54,750
He may be one of
God's most beloved.

326
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,500
[BAK]
Now, Allen Walker.

327
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,875
It's time for you to activate
your scattered Innocence

328
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:01,833
and change its form.

329
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:03,791
Back into an Anti-Akuma weapon.

330
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:04,916
[ALLEN]
What?

331
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,083
If you can turn it
back into a weapon,

332
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:07,833
you'll be able to
fight again, right?

333
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:10,458
[ALLEN]
Uh...

334
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:12,250
Okay!

335
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,166
[exhales]

336
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,708
[ALLEN]
You're not like you were before.

337
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:32,291
It's hard to believe you were
my left arm at one point.

338
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:34,916
I'm sorry.

339
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,208
But once again,

340
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:39,541
I want you to return to
the battlefield with me.

341
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,125
Let's do this.

342
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:51,083
[LI KEI] You see that?
It's swirling all around him!

343
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:00,625
[ALLEN]
Here we go!

344
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:03,458
Innocence Activate!

345
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,791
Amazing! The particles
of Innocence,

346
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:12,166
they're gathering
towards Walker!

347
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:23,958
He's done it!

348
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,375
It's being revived.

349
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:28,333
The Anti-Akuma weapon
on his left arm.

350
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,916
Come back!

351
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,291
Come back!

352
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:37,666
[ALL gasping]

353
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,875
[ALLEN]
Come back!

354
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:45,041
[ALLEN yells]

355
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:50,333
Yes!

356
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,208
It worked!

357
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,583
[ALL gasping]

358
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,458
Don't give up yet! Try again!

359
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:18,708
[ALLEN]
Huh? Yeah! This time!

360
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:22,000
[ALLEN] I need to get my
left arm back to normal.

361
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:24,625
I have get to Edo
and join the others.

362
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:26,875
Back to Lenalee!

363
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,583
[LENALEE]
Allen...

364
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,333
[BAK]
One more time!

365
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:49,666
[ALLEN]
Right.

366
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,750
Activate!

367
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:56,125
Activate! Activate!

368
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,416
Activate!

369
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,000
Activate! Activate!

370
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:02,166
Activate!

371
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,541
Activate! Activate!

372
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:06,000
Activate!

373
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:10,208
Activate! [groans]

374
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:13,458
[panting]

375
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:17,916
Poor Allen!
He can't take anymore!

376
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,833
[SHIFU]
On the contrary...

377
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,458
...he's just getting started.

378
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:22,916
That's right.

379
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,208
If anything, he's more
motivated than before.

380
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,666
[BAK grunts]

381
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:36,833
[ALLEN grunts] I won't give up.
I'll never give up.

382
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,916
Hey, Innocence.
Are you listening?

383
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,708
My friends need me. I'll
activate you if it kills me.

384
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:21,083
[ALLEN]
My Innocence was destroyed.

385
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:22,583
Reduced to particles.

386
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:24,875
In order to revive it the
chief of the Asian Branch

387
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:26,708
comes up with a strategy.

388
00:22:26,791 --> 00:22:28,333
But will his plan work?

389
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:31,958
And will I live through
it to find out?

390
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:33,833
On the next <i>D.Gray Man</i> :

391
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:36,166
"The Road of the Pledged."

392
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:40,750
[KANDA grunts]

393
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:41,958
[ALLEN]
Jer--!

394
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:48,250
The usual.

395
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,291
Sure!

396
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:52,750
Eat up!

397
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:54,250
[KANDA]
Hmph.

398
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:57,208
Kanda's eating
soba noodles again.
