How long do I have
to keep doing this?

The reason you feel
so compelled to fight

9
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:04,458
is because you have something
important to protect.

Something important, huh?

That's right.

Part of me feels like I'm
accomplishing nothing.

I know I just need to remain
focused on the training.

you're too impatient.

It was pretty obvious
during our practice.

Afraid not.

There's something I need
to show all of you.

70
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,041
[BAK] A strange phenomenon
has been observed

71
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,166
while you were training.

72
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,041
I've been monitoring it here.

73
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:23,250
Using Golems to keep track
of your Innocence level

74
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:26,083
as you and Fo sparred.

00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:28,708
We're looking at
the distribution map.

76
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,166
[BAK]
Now...

77
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,291
Innocence doesn't typically
release high energy

78
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:38,625
unless it's in a physical form.
But these last two days,

79
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:41,791
we've seen a spike
in their levels.

80
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,541
Even though yours remains
in a particle state.

81
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:46,208
Huh?

82
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:49,708
[BAK] You'll agree it is,
indeed, strange.

83
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:55,250
So even though my Innocence
isn't in a physical form,

84
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,000
it's still connected to me.

85
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,541
The evidence seems to
point in that direction.

86
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:00,416
No way!

I want to get your
opinions on the matter.

90
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,333
Why we're encountering
this oddity.

If anyone has a theory,
I'm ready to hear it.

I don't know if it's
related or not.

98
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:28,208
The past two days, I've
only been thinking about

99
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:31,458
one thing during

The power of thought

103
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,875
is enough to cause
changes to Innocence?

104
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,708
I've never heard of
that occurring.

105

No one has.

106

But there's no
other explanation.

107
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,333
The reason you feel
so compelled to fight

108
00:06:56,416 --> 00:07:00,208
is because you have something
important to protect.

109

Something important...

110

...that I have to protect...

111
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,083
[WONG]
It's happening again!

But why?

119
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,375
Just a guess,

120
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:42,125
but the energy levels are so
high we can observe it visually.

121

to me over the phone?

133
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,875
If he wants to
activate his power,

134
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,125
then he'll need to
find out what that is.

135
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:26,041
I think it's something Allen's
longing for at the same time.

You need to stay in bed!

Don't worry. My eye's
gone back to normal.

166
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,875
The last time it
transformed like that,

167
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:03,500
you were training
with Fo, right?

168
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,458
Yeah.

169
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:13,166
[BAK] Afterwards, you told me
it was reacting to Akuma.

170
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,791
Searching for them.

171
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:17,708
The only thing is I don't
know where they are.

172
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,958
It's like they're
calling out to me.

173
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,541
On top of that, it wasn't
aching like before.

174
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:23,916
Today was painful.

175
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,500
[BAK]
Calling out?

176
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,875
What do the Akuma want with him?

177
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:29,291
[ALLEN]
Listen, Bak.

178
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,416
I need you to give
me one more shot.

179
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,583
But this time while
I'm training with Fo!

180

You're crazy!

181
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,500
If it doesn't activate,
well... not much changes.

182
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:39,666
All right.

183
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,750
But wait until your
condition improves!

184
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,458
My condition doesn't matter.

185
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:45,750
Whether I'm feeling
strong or weak,

186
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,791
I have to overcome this!

187
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,416
I'm so close!

188
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,958
We can't waste time worrying

stop bothering me.

You have to let me
resume the training!

You're sure this is
what you want?

194
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,500
Yes. But don't hold back, okay?

195

Come at me with everything
you've got, Fo.

one thing I'm sure of.

Between his Innocence and eye,

329
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,291
Bak...

330
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,041
Bak!

331
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:06,458
Hide Walker before
it breaks through!

332
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:08,791
Bak!

333
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:11,375
No! Fo!

334
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:19,666
[AKUMA A laughs] So you're the
entrance to the barrier, huh?

335
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,208
There's no way!

336
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:24,083
How did an Akuma manage to get
through the seal so easily?

337
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:26,250
It's impossible!

338
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:30,833
[AKUMA A] Actually, it
required very little effort.

339
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:38,000
[AKUMA A] My passage here was
granted courtesy of Noah's Ark.

340
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:44,958
[AKUMA A] Boy with gray
hair, and a strange left eye.

341
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:49,333
You wouldn't be the
infamous Allen Walker?

342
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:52,666
[ALLEN]
What?

343
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,416
This feeling.

344
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,833
It's so familiar.

345
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,791
[FO screaming]

346
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,125
[LO FWA]
What's going on?!

347
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:04,708
That thing... It came
out of Fo's body!

348
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,791
[SHIFU]
My guess is it's an Akuma.

349
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:09,791
Idiot! Everyone here
knows it's an Akuma!

350
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,833
The issue is, that seal
has been protecting

351
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:14,166
the Asian Branch for
over a hundred years!

352
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,958
How did it manage to break
through, just like that?

353
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,166
More importantly,

354
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:23,625
how did it know exactly
where to find Allen?

355
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:26,000
I've seen those before!

356
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:29,958
[ALLEN gasping]

357
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,708
[FO]
Walker...

358
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:34,583
Go... Run!

359
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:35,791
[ALLEN]
Uh...

360
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:38,541
This Akuma only has
one goal, to kill you.

361
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:41,166
The shape you're in,
there's no way you can win!

362
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,750
Get outta here!

363
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:43,958
I'm not running!

364
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:49,708
[AKUMA A]
No. I won't allow you to run.

365
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,791
[ALLEN gasps]

366
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:52,958
[gasping]

367
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:55,125
[ALLEN groans]

368
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:58,916
[FO]
Walker!

369
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:34,458
[ALLEN] An Akuma has
broken through the barrier,

370
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:37,083
and appeared within the
walls of the Asian Branch.

371
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:39,958
His ability...
decomposing objects.

372
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:45,916
If I'm not careful, my left arm
will be the least of my worries.

373
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,916
On the next <i>D.Gray-man</i> :
"Invasion."

374
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:56,833
[gasping] What the...?
