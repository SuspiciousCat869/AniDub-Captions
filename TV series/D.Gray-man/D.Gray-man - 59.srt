[inhales, exhales]

2
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:55,416
[ALLEN]
Activate!

3
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:13,333
[ALLEN grunting]

4
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:21,583
[ALLEN groaning]

5
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:31,750
Ah, that hurt.
I still can't do it.

6
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:35,291
[ALLEN]
I can synchronize just fine,

7
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:39,916
but I can't get it to turn into
the weapon. C'mon, Innocence!

8
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:48,458
[ALLEN] I really can't afford
to be wasting time like this.

9
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:51,000
Dammit.

10
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:54,041
I have to get back.

11
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:59,333
I can't get that dream I had
about Lenalee out of my head.

12
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:03,375
I've gotta hurry.
They need my help.

13
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,541
[BAK]
Hm?

14
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:11,333
It's Walker.

15
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:15,666
No! I can't give up!

16
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,791
[BAK groans]

17
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:19,250
I'm gonna try to do
it one more time!

18
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,750
Hm?

19
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:24,000
Uh? Bak?

20
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:27,250
Um, are you okay there?

21
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:28,666
Do I look okay?

22
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,666
[ALLEN]
Sorry!

23
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,125
I wasn't trying to
hurt you, I swear.

24
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:34,416
I was thinking really hard,

25
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,625
so I guess I didn't see
you when you came in.

26
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,208
I think you should take a break.

27
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:39,666
Why?

28
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,000
[BAK] You haven't slept much
the last two days, right?

29
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:44,166
Well, no.

30
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:48,750
[ALLEN] Oh, I'm sorry.
I made you drop all your stu--

31
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:53,041
[gasps] Wait, that's...

32
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:57,625
[BAK screaming]

33
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:00,125
[panting]

34
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:01,708
[ALLEN]
Uh?

35
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:05,750
I can explain this! I promise
I'm not a stalker or anything!

36
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:08,750
Nothing to explain.
You like her, don't you?

37
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,166
[BAK grunting]

38
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,458
[whimpers]

39
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:15,500
What's wrong?

40
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:18,166
Don't look! Um, you see, I...

41
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,583
I break out in hives when I
start to get too emotional,

42
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:23,375
that's all,
nothing to see here!

43
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:29,125
Oh, no! Uh... Somebody help!

44
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:40,416
[ALLEN] This is a bit much.
I thought it was just hives.

45
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,458
Walker...

46
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:44,416
Huh? Hey! So,
about the pictures--

47
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,041
Just forget it.

48
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,250
[ALLEN]
Huh?

49
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:50,041
Look, Equipment Types
and Parasite Types,

50
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:53,166
they each activate Innocence in
different ways. You know that?

51
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,833
Uh? Well, no, I didn't actually.

52
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:59,500
[BAK] Yeah, in fact
they're very different.

53
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:02,791
With Parasite, your Innocence
dwells inside you

54
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,750
and acts as an
Anti-Akuma Weapon.

55
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,291
[ALLEN]
Right.

56
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:09,541
But, Equipment Types aren't
physically connected to their

57
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:13,625
Innocence the way you are.
And because of that limitation,

58
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:17,125
they have much greater
difficulty controlling it.

59
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,208
Even if they can synchronize,

60
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:22,875
it's not easy for them to
harness the power effectively.

61
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:28,750
[BAK] And that's precisely
why we transform Innocence

62
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:31,166
into Anti-Akuma weapons.

63
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:37,750
[BAK] This process allows
the power of the Innocence

64
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,083
to be restrained,
and makes it easier

65
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:43,166
for Accommodators to
synchronize with it.

66
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,166
Once the weapons are complete,

67
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,791
Equipment Type Accommodators
are able to use them.

68
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,583
[BAK]
On the other hand,

69
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:58,458
Parasite Types work with a
pure and unaltered Innocence.

70
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:06,458
[BAK] To break it down
in simple terms,

71
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,583
the bodies of Parasite
Type Accommodators

72
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,583
have the remarkable
ability to restrain

73
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:13,708
and harness the full power
of their Innocence.

74
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:17,083
They themselves are
the Anti-Akuma Weapons.

75
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:22,666
I'm a... weapon?

76
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:26,291
That's the long and short of it.

77
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:29,208
Though you are still
a human, of course.

78
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:32,583
When we make an Anti-Akuma
Weapon from someone's Innocence,

79
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:35,416
the first thing that we do
is learn all about it.

80
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,250
By gathering information
about its functionality,

81
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:40,541
its shape, those things,

82
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:43,208
we can determine the
best "style" for it.

83
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:44,583
There's a very real
chance that you

84
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:47,458
might not even know your
Innocence all that well yet.

85
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:48,708
[ALLEN gasps]

86
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:50,625
[BAK] It's possible that
you're not the "style"

87
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:53,041
that's most compatible
with its ability.

88
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:54,250
I think that could be the reason

89
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:57,041
you're not able
to activate it yet.

90
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,166
[ALLEN]
So then,

91
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,208
you're saying I'm not familiar
enough with my Innocence.

92
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,375
[coughing]

93
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:13,083
Oh no, Chief Bak! Stay strong!
Please don't die!

94
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:16,291
[ALLEN] I don't think I've heard
of anyone dying from hives.

95
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,041
[coughs]

96
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,041
Well, I'm sure you
don't have time

97
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:28,375
to learn everything there is
to know about your Innocence.

98
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,583
At least not right now.

99
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:31,916
Oh.

100
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,291
[BAK] Hmph. I think
I might have an idea.

101
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:40,333
[ALLEN] Isn't this the sealed
room I came to the other day?

102
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:42,583
Do you have something
special planned for me?

103
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:43,916
It's a bit rash,

104
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,333
but there's somebody here
I'd like you to fight.

105
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:47,750
[ALLEN]
Huh?

106
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:48,833
Fo!

107
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:49,708
[ALLEN grunts]

108
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:52,291
[FO]
Ah, man, what a pain.

109
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,416
[ALLEN gasps]

110
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:01,375
Stupid Bak! Since
when is it my job

111
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,916
to babysit your little
friend? Come on.

112
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,375
[ALLEN]
Uh...

113
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:08,208
She looks human, but she's
a crystallization created by

114
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:11,458
my great grandfather derived
from the guardian deity.

115
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:13,958
I'm also an all-powerful
warrior.

116
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:17,083
So, don't get on my
bad side, kid.

117
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,083
[FO yells]

118
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,833
See? Gotcha.

119
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:30,291
[ALLEN gasping]

00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:33,833
Heh.

122
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:35,208
[ALLEN]
Uh.

[ALLEN]
Ow...

126
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,625
[FO]
Hit me with your best shot,

127
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,458
but you'll never
survive this fight

128
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:54,791
unless you can activate
your Innocence.

129
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:57,958
[ALLEN grunting]

130
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,250
[BAK]
C'mon!

131
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:04,916
This is the best way to get you
in touch with your Innocence!

132
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,916
You'd be surprised what
a person can accomplish

133
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,500
when his life is on the line!

134
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,166
If you fight with someone
as strong as her,

135
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,041
we should get
results in no time!

136
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,833
On the other hand,
you look pretty mad,

137
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:18,125
so maybe we should call it off.

138
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:19,291
[WONG]
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

139
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,000
Yeah, you're right.
What was I thinking?

140
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:24,041
This strategy is
way too dangerous.

141
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,583
[ALLEN]
No, I'll do it.

142
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:28,541
--[WONG gasping]
--What? Are you certain?

143
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,458
[FO]
Heh.

144
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:39,041
[ALLEN] It is a crazy idea,
but it just might work.

145
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,083
[FO yelling]

146
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,375
[ALLEN grunts]

147
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:57,875
You can't dodge me forever,
Walker! Just do it!

148
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:02,000
Activate your Innocence!

149
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,666
Activate!

150
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:14,375
[ALLEN groans]

151
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:15,291
[FO]
Nice try.

152
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:16,791
[gasps]

153
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,750
If that's really
the best you can do,

154
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,416
you should get lost
before you end up dead.

155
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,666
I mean it. Just run.

156
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
No, I have to do this. I don't
have time to mess around.

157
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,583
I will get my Innocence back,

158
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,458
and then I'm gonna go
find the rest of my team

159
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,166
as soon as I can!

160
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,375
Well, you may suck at this,

161
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,208
but you've got spirit,
I'll give you that!

162
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:52,833
[BAK]
That's enough, Fo.

163
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:54,583
[ALLEN whimpers]

164
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,583
[ALLEN gasps]

165
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:01,750
[BAK]
Walker. Take a break.

166
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:02,916
But I'm fine!

167
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,375
Don't overdo it.

168
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:07,500
You're never gonna succeed
by wearing yourself out.

169
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:08,875
Go have some lunch.

170
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:13,125
We can pick up where we
left off when you get back.

171
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,625
[ALLEN]
All right.

172
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:15,833
[FO]
Hmph.

173
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,000
[LO FWA]
Oh wow. It's crowded today.

174
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:22,750
[LI KEI] Yeah, we should've
gotten here earlier.

175
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:25,000
We would've if you hadn't
made us wait for you.

176
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:28,750
Hey, look!
There's room over there.

177
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,458
Uh! Walker's here...

178
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:33,458
[SHIFU, LI KEI chuckle]

179
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:34,500
Then let's go!

180
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:37,375
Huh?! W-Wait a minute!

181
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,208
[LI KEI] Hey. You mind
if we sit with you?

182
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:43,208
Uh. Okay.

183
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:43,791
Go on.

184
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:45,166
[LO FWA]
U-Uh!

185
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,291
[ALLEN]
Hm?

186
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,791
Wow, that's a lot.

187
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,625
Yeah it sure is. Feeling hungry?

188
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,750
Oh, yeah.

189
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,750
[gasps]

190
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,166
[LO FWA]
To think he eats that much

191
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,333
and still manages to stay
so thin and handsome.

192
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:05,916
What a catch! [laughs]

193
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,916
Uh, hey...

194
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
[LI KEI]
Don't worry about her.

195
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:11,583
Okay.

196
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:17,416
[ALLEN] I never knew authentic
Chinese food was this delicious!

197
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,416
[LI KEI] It's not because
it's Chinese food,

198
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,083
it's because it comes from here.

199
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:23,500
Seriously?

200
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:26,291
Yep. We're actually kinda lucky
that the food's so good,

201
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:28,416
since it's the only
choice we have.

202
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,625
From what I understand,
every branch in the Order

203
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,083
has high-quality cafeteria
cooking like this.

204
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:35,083
[ALLEN]
Wow.

205
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:37,291
Now that I think about it,
Jerry always made sure

206
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:41,125
the cafeteria food at
headquarters was top-notch, too.

207
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,916
[SHIFU] Well, those of
us at the Black Order

208
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,666
can always die at any time.

209
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,333
That said, they probably
figure the least they can do

210
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:51,666
is give us good food
while we're still alive.

211
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,291
I think that's why.

212
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:57,625
Jeez, man. Do ya have to bring
down the mood like that?

213
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:00,416
Yeah. I think you may be right.

214
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,750
Uh?

215
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:04,041
The fact is, we have an
important job to do here,

216
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,791
one that could cost
us our lives.

217
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,333
Uh...

218
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:16,625
[ALLEN]
Well, I'm full!

219
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,208
[BOTH gasp]

220
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,875
I'm gonna go. So, see ya around!

221
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:34,833
[LI KEI]
Hm? Lo Fwa. What's up with you?

222
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:36,083
[LO FWA]
Uh?

223
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:38,291
I keep finding mistakes
on these calculations.

224
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,333
Uh! Sorry.

225
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:44,583
That's not like you. You almost
never make a mistake, Lo Fwa.

226
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:49,083
You're worried about
Walker, aren't you?

227
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,833
[LO FWA] Mm-hm. His body's
covered in scars,

228
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,666
and he's so skinny.
And even though he's still

229
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:58,083
just a teenager, he talks
about sacrificing his life.

230
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,041
[LI KEI]
Well, he's an Exorcist.

231
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:04,333
Yes, but he shoulders
everything by himself.

232
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:05,958
He's not by himself.

233
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:06,750
Huh?

234
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,000
You were the one who said

235
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:10,041
we needed to give him
our support, remember?

236
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:11,458
I know, but...

237
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:13,000
Don't worry, the Science Section

238
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,541
is gonna do whatever we can
to help him out.

239
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:20,166
Heh, even if we are only
a bunch of rookies.

240
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,416
Okay then.

241
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,750
Good! Now that we're
all on the same page,

242
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:24,875
the first thing we need to do

243
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,750
is carry out some
Innocence research.

244
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,375
[BOTH gasp]

245
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,166
[LO FWA]
Are you sure this is okay?

246
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,000
They said that place
was off-limits!

247
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,458
[LI KEI]
Who's gonna know?

248
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:43,625
Besides, how are we
gonna help Walker

249
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:46,125
if we don't know anything
about what he's doing?

250
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,375
Yeah, but isn't this too far?

251
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:51,333
Look. You obviously just
want an excuse to see him,

252
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:52,750
so what are you
complaining about?

253
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:54,791
Wha--?! Hey! That's not true!

254
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:57,375
[SHIFU]
Shh! Not so loud!

255
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:03,791
[ALLEN, FO grunting]

256

Whoa! You're gonna
blow our cover!

00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,916
He's all beat up.

263
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,125
It looks like he's been
at it since lunch.

264
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:30,166
What? But it's midnight now!

Huh?

00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:26,625
Sorry, kid. It's hard
for me to keep

284
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,708
my physical form
when I'm sleepy.

285
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:32,166
So, I'm gonna go take a nap now.

[FO] We'll finish this
when I wake up.

287
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,625
[ALLEN]
So, if she wasn't sleepy,

288
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:43,416
I'd be headless right now?

Well, we're in trouble now.

Uh. We're sorry, sir.

Ugh. Forget it.
Since you're in there,

301
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:15,750
get Walker back to his bed.

302
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:18,416
You'll be cleaning the archives
for a while as punishment.

--[LI KEI] Huh?

What happened?

[BAK grunts] Nothing serious.
Not your concern.

308

[KOMUI]
How's Allen doing?

309
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,916
He's working really hard,

310
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,708
but he's still not able to
activate his Innocence.

311
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:44,333
I think, with time, he'll
make it work for him again.

Understood.

Allen pushes too hard, so look
out for him, okay, Bak, buddy?

00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:21,541
[KLAUD] So, our apprentices
have already been cremated.

323
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,375
That's fine.

324
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:27,166
At least this way, they no
longer have a cross to bear.

325
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:37,208
[SOCALO] They were nothing
but weaklings anyway.

326
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:40,750
I don't mourn their
deaths in the least.

327
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,458
[KOMUI]
General Klaud Nine.

328
00:18:56,541 --> 00:19:00,333
General Winters Socalo.

329
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:03,291
The Great Generals
are awaiting you.

330
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,833
[WONG]
Come now.

331
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,916
[BAK] What do you think
of Allen Walker?

332
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,291
[FO]
Hmph, not much. He's pathetic!

333
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:36,166
Not only is he painfully slow,
I can already tell

334
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,458
he doesn't have what it
takes to pull this off.

335
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:39,791
Not gonna happen.

336
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:42,375
Yeah? And yet you're doing
everything in your power

337
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:43,750
to make sure he succeeds.

338
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:47,208
[FO] Because you told me to.
Stupid Bak.

339
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:49,958
Oh. Right, I forgot.

340
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:51,666
[FO]
Still...

341
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,416
Despite all that,

342
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:57,291
something makes me not
want to give up on him.

343
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,250
I think I understand.

344
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:02,416
After all, he made the
choice to be an Exorcist,

345
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,541
You don't see that kind
of drive every day.

346
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,583
[FO]
No, you don't.

347
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,250
There you are. You ready?

348
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:33,166
Yep. Let's get started.

349
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,208
[FO yells]

350
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,666
[ALLEN]
During the trip to Edo,

351
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,583
the ship carrying Lenalee and
the rest of the team is rocked

352
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:22,750
by a sudden explosion. And as
the smoke begins to clear,

353
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:25,916
they find themselves
face to face with...

354
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:30,041
[ALLEN]
On the next <i>D. Gray Man</i> :

355
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:31,833
"Title."

356
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:40,625
Stop right there, Short
Stack! What's so funny?

357
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:43,083
Well. I'll tell you what
I'm not laughing at.

358
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:44,416
I'm definitely not saying,

359
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,250
"Ha, ha I'm so happy Kanda
hasn't appeared lately!"

360
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:49,250
I mean, that would be
ridiculous, right?

361
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:50,750
Hey, watch it, squirt!

362
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:51,458
[SOCALO]
Well!

363
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:52,500
[ALLEN, KANDA]
Huh?

364
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:54,541
[SOCALO]
This tea sure is delicious.

365
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:56,500
I quite agree.
