1
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:53,375
Oh my.

2
00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:58,500
Beautiful.

3
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:05,333
What now...?

4
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:06,666
Yes, Kanda...?

5
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,500
I'm sorry sir, but we
don't have time to sketch.

6
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,583
You have to understand,

7
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:17,291
I may never visit this
place again in my life...

8
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:18,708
Now may be my only chance

9
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:22,791
to sketch this gorgeous
scenery before us.

10
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:25,958
I'll do it quickly
okay, I promise.

11
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:30,416
I bet I can get an even better
view from up on that bluff!

12
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,083
You'll get used to it...

13
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,666
It's just the way
the General is...

14
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,833
Yeah I know that.

15
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:43,208
Well, what do you know?

16
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:46,291
This spots taken.

17
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,166
Ah... A fellow artist.

18
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:05,708
Nice...

19
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:07,375
Your work is quite impressive...

20
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,833
Thanks, I really
appreciate that.

21
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:12,208
I noticed you like
to sketch buildings.

22
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:14,250
I'm studying architecture
at the university

23
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:16,375
over in Prague.

24
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:17,666
Interesting...

25
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,208
I take it that's
your profession...

26
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:21,333
How fun.

27
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:23,375
Nice meeting you.
I'm Alphonse Clouse.

28
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:25,750
And I am Froi Tiedoll.

29
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,250
These gentlemen here are
my travel companions...

30
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,375
Kanda and Marie.

31
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,458
It's a pleasure.

32
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,041
Sorry about him...

33
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:40,833
He's sort of the shy one...

34
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,375
It's nothing against you...

35
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:44,083
Ah okay.

36
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,208
So you said you came
here from Prague...?

37
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:54,458
If I were to guess I'd say
you came to these mountains

38
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:56,291
to see Jan's mansion, right?

39
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:57,083
Yes...!

40
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:58,375
You're familiar with it?

41
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:00,583
Well I'm at least
familiar with the rumors.

42
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:03,708
What is this...
mansion you speak of?

43
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:04,625
You see...

44
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:05,958
There used to be
an eccentric man

45
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:08,500
by the name of Jan Novark
who lived in a village

46
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,666
just ahead of here.

47
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,375
Jan owned a general store...

48
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,333
It was very well
known in the area

49
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:17,208
and packed with
customers every day.

50
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:21,250
Yet one day, out of the blue,
he decided to close it...

51
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,791
Taking the money he had
earned and investing it,

52
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:26,125
he began to build
a house for himself

53
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,833
with his own two hands.

54
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:30,625
His fellow villagers all assumed

55
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:33,583
he would get bored with
his new venture and quit...

56
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,875
but he did nothing
of the sort...

57
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:38,833
Day after day he continued
to build his house,

58
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:41,833
working his hands to the bone.

59
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:44,916
After a remarkable forty
years of construction,

60
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,250
he finally completed
the home of his dreams.

61
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,875
That is the story
of Jan's mansion...

62
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,208
I read this book as a child

63
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:55,458
and it had such a profound
effect it inspired me

64
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:57,166
to become an architect.

65
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,416
And now...

66
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,125
I'm so close to fulfilling
my childhood dream

67
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:03,208
of seeing his mansion
with my own eyes.

68
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:04,208
That's stupid.

69
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:05,250
Oh...?

70
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:08,208
I didn't know
you were listening.

71
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:09,666
It's hard not to...

72
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,916
I thought you couldn't be
bothered with such nonsense.

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,083
It doesn't interest me.

74
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,500
You just don't get it...!

75
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,208
It's a piece of art
that caused people

76
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:17,791
to take a fresh
look at architecture

77
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:20,458
from the perspective
of making a house fun.

78
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,083
Novak's ideas,
which weren't limited

79
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:24,875
to current thinking, surprised
the architects of his time...

80
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,458
His mansion is a
engineering triumph

81
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,083
that's inspired
writers and artists.

82
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:29,458
That mansion's a heritage

83
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:31,791
which should be
cherished by humanity.

84
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,750
The man is right... though...

85
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,041
I guess a cold fish like you,

86
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:38,666
wouldn't understand
the concept of cherishing.

87
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,041
What the hell are those?!

88
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,416
Move!

89
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:07,916
Noel Organon.

90
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,333
Marie...! Let's go!

91
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,500
Right... General!

92
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:23,916
Isn't that great...

93
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,625
There went our ride.

94
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,041
This place is deserted.

95
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:53,791
What the...

96
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:57,208
Why would everyone just up
and leave their meals like this?

97
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,416
This is an Akuma's doing.

98
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,750
Akuma?

99
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:04,125
You don't mean...
those monsters from earlier?!

100
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,833
Afriad so...

101
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,875
They didn't even
have a chance...

102
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,000
They're dead?

103
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:11,916
Found 'em...

104
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,208
East of here.

105
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:45,833
This way!

106
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,083
Wait up!

107
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,000
That's it...

108
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,666
Oh my lord...!

109
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,250
Look, it's Jan's mansion!

110
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:09,333
So you've finally
arrived, Exorcists.

111
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:11,041
We've been waiting for you...

112
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:15,166
In your absence; we decided
to kill all of the villagers!

113
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,916
Now come on inside so
we can have some fun!

114
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:24,416
How dare they mock
us by inviting us in...

115
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,500
Those bastards!

116
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,666
Kanda...!
Wait, it could be a trap.

117
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,041
Come on... Let's go...

118
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,708
We can not let them get away...

119
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,041
Boy oh boy...

120
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:34,125
I guess we have no other choice.

121
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,666
We'll go in for
a little while...

122
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,166
We simply can't
allow those Akuma

123
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,958
to run amok in such an
historic building as this.

124
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:43,625
B-But you...

125
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:46,250
Don't worry about us,
we'll be all right...

126
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:48,416
It would be best
if you left now.

127
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,625
Huh?

128
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,125
It's too dangerous...

129
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:56,708
Trust me this is no place
for a civilian like yourself.

130
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:57,916
Right...

131
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,166
Wait...

132
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,083
General...

133
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,666
Please protect the mansion!

134
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,791
I will...

135
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,708
It's a dead end.

136
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:24,333
Maybe this is it?

137
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,750
Take it easy there, Kanda.

138
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:37,416
Our enemies haven't even
shown themselves yet.

139
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,625
You heard what
Clouse said, didn't you?

140
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:42,166
This house was
designed with fun in mind.

141
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,333
Novak spent forty years
building this mansion

142
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,250
and he poured every
ounce of playfulness

143
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,208
he had into the structure.

144
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:55,958
Given that amount of time
the floor plan isn't simple...

145
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:58,083
as you can see.

146
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,333
Now this is convenient!

147
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:07,541
How refreshing!

148
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:13,375
Look here...

149
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,416
Now that is a nice touch...

150
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,125
This place is even more
fun than I had imagined.

151
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,125
General...

152
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,041
Could you please be more
careful with what you touch.

153
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:26,708
Hmm...

154
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:27,791
You say something?

155
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,708
The fun has begun.

156
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,625
Everything is going to plan.

157
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,500
But no matter how
many level one Akuma

158
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,000
we throw at those Exorcists...

159
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:45,375
It won't be enough to kill them.

160
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,375
But that's no surprise.

161
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:51,083
All they need to accomplish
is luring them into this room.

162
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,416
I see.

163
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,000
Only in this room do we
have an ideal battlefield

164
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,000
for our specific talents.

165
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:09,708
That it...? Then what do you
say we get a move on, huh?

166
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:17,875
Here... Let me try...

167
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:20,583
Your way of thinking is
inflexible... as always.

168
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:23,708
What... You assume
that when it comes to doors

169
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,666
you either push or pull.

170
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,458
Yet this one...

171
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:30,041
Is a pocket door...

172
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:33,250
You should try thinking outside
the box more often, Kanda.

173
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,083
Behind you...

174
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,625
Oh...

175
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:17,791
Welcome... Exorcists!

176
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:25,541
There you are, we've
been looking for you.

177
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:29,083
You seem quite relaxed,
General Tiedoll.

178
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,625
Oh... so you're
familiar with me?

179
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,916
Of course we are,
since our sole mission is

180
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,750
to take the Innocence
you're carrying.

181
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,250
I'm sorry to ruin your plans

182
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:41,000
but I don't see that
happening anytime soon.

183
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,541
Is that so...?

184
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:45,583
Then we will have no other
choice but to take it by force.

185
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:49,666
But before that, why don't
we set the stage a bit?

186
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:56,916
What the hell...

187
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,250
I take it by setting the stage,
you're referring to him?

188
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:01,125
No!

189
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:02,500
That fool came in on his own!

190
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:03,875
Have some patience.

191
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:07,000
The stage for our battle
will be finished soon.

192
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,833
I'm sorry... but
I couldn't resist coming in...

193
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:12,708
Then all of a sudden a hole
appeared in the floor below me.

194
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:16,708
Well, we'll just have to make
do since you're here now.

195
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:17,833
What's going on...

196
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Behold!

197
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,666
The stage for our
momentous battle!

198
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,666
It will soon serve
as your graveyard!

199
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,250
I know this room...

200
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:28,875
It can morph... And
it contains

201
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:31,916
the most advanced devices
in the entire mansion!

202
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,916
This is the most interesting
house I've ever been in.

203
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,708
Well then, we agree
on one thing!

204
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:40,166
Perhaps we could
get along after all?

205
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,416
Don't push it...

206
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,875
I'm not known to
get along with Akuma.

207
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:45,000
Oh no...?

208
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,083
How unfortunate for you!

209
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:50,583
General...

210
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:51,500
Get him out of here...

211
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:52,666
You don't have to convince me.

212
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,208
It's all yours.

213
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,416
Innocence, activate!

214
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:09,333
What do you think?

215
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:12,375
Isn't my regenerative
body something else?!

216
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:16,916
Ahh...

217
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,083
This is going to be a problem.

218
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:21,625
Kanda! Move!

219
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:25,375
What a useless toy!

220
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,833
Marie!

221
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:29,916
See?

222
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,125
Isn't this fun?

223
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,458
It's like a giant puzzle,

224
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:35,708
but guess what, there's
even more to come!

225
00:14:51,666 --> 00:15:00,000
I wonder how much longer
you'll be able to hold out?!

226
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:00,916
What's wrong...?

227
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,458
Have you already given up?

228
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,083
Found you!

229
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,500
Your face is your weak point.

230
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:24,833
This is getting hard!

231
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,208
Please stop it...

232
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,208
You're destroying the mansion!!!

233
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:44,250
This room is a work of art...!

234
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,791
What you're doing is a crime!

235
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:47,625
Please stop!

236
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,375
You're destroying my dream!

237
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:50,791
If you wanna walk
out of here alive,

238
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,291
shut your mouth and stay put!

239
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,291
Netherworld Creature Ichigen!

240
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:06,375
Wow.

241
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:14,583
Now there's nowhere
left for you to hide.

242
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:15,625
Well well...

243
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,833
That was quite
the show you put on.

244
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:20,625
But it appears you
went a little overboard.

245
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:28,208
No!

246
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:44,458
Amazing.

247
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:46,708
The mansion's control center!

248
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,166
Do us all a favor and fall

249
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,541
so the gears will
do the dirty work!

250
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:02,416
Geez...

251
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,333
To think you went so far as

252
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:07,166
to put our own
lives in danger...

253
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:10,625
You have a lot to learn.

254
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,458
Hey Clouse...

255
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:15,875
you put your own life at
risk to visit Jan's mansion...

256
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:19,291
Let it sear into your eyes.

257
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:20,791
Okay...

258
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:25,250
Maker of Eden... Activate!

259
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:29,000
What is he planning to do?

260
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:30,166
Art!

261
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:45,166
Wha... What the?!

262
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:49,291
No...!

263
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:51,208
It's collapsing!

264
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:21,791
I told you, didn't I?

265
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:25,375
You should be more flexible
in your way of thinking...

266
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,500
If you don't want them to
be able to hide anywhere,

267
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:29,875
you may have to
go to great lengths.

268
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:30,708
See?

269
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:32,666
They're right above you now.

270
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:37,291
It's time you finished them off.

271
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:02,916
It's a tragedy that
such a beautiful

272
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,500
and inspiring building
was lost today...

273
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,916
Words can't describe my sorrow.

274
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,333
But that doesn't make any sense,

275
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:11,291
he's the one who
just destroyed it...

276
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:15,125
You'll come to learn someday
that's just the way Master is.

277
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:24,375
In truth...
my father had fallen ill.

278
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,166
And due to that...

279
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:29,291
I couldn't continue my
studies in architecture...

280
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:33,041
I then decided to give up
my dream of becoming one.

281
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:34,708
I thought that once
I saw Jan's mansion

282
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:37,916
in person I could
put it all behind me...

283
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,875
But...

284
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:42,166
General Tiedoll.

285
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,125
I've made a decision!

286
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:47,750
I will... continue my
studies in architecture!

287
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,625
Ideas have started
popping into my head,

288
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:52,041
one after another...!

289
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:53,791
Like, what kind of
house would I build

290
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:56,583
if I were to use this
plot of land myself?

291
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,333
Now that Jan's mansion
is gone I have come

292
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:00,291
to realize my true calling...

293
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,708
It is to build a home
that surpasses its genius

294
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:05,708
while honoring Jan's original!

295
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,500
That's great.

296
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:13,250
Huh...

297
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:14,500
Makes me wonder

298
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:16,083
if Master destroyed the
mansion on purpose...

299
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:20,500
knowing it would have
this effect on Clouse.

300
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:26,541
I, for one, couldn't
possibly care less.

301
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:37,125
I go out for a while

302
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:40,083
to buy some snacks
and look what happens.

303
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,458
I wonder...

304
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:48,125
Do they enjoy sweets like me?

305
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:57,583
What's the matter?

306
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,333
Nothing.

307
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,250
While crossing the
mountainous terrain

308
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:42,250
to join up with the
rest of our group,

309
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:44,458
whom we were
separated from earlier,

310
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:47,583
we run straight into
a massive snowstorm.

311
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:51,958
On the next D. Gray-man:
"Illusions in the Snow."

312
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:55,625
Bring forth salvation to
this tormented Akuma's soul.
