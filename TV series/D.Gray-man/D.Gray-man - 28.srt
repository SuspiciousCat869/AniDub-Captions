1
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,541
The first mission for me...!

2
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:43,375
The first mission for me!

3
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:45,416
Today is my first mission,

4
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,833
oh the first mission for me!

5
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:50,916
Try to keep it down...

6
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,541
It isn't safe out here.

7
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:54,500
But I can't help it...!

8
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:57,083
This is my first official
assignment as an Exorcist!

9
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:58,416
I can't contain myself...!

10
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,458
Who wouldn't be overwhelmed
with the excitement?

11
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:04,083
We still have to be careful...

12
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:07,083
The forest is full
of bears and wolves.

13
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:08,250
Uh?

14
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:10,500
If you want to keep
singing, go ahead...

15
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:13,250
It'll just make us that
much easier to track.

16
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:15,625
Even so...

17
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:17,250
Let them follow us
if they want to...

18
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:19,833
No wildlife is a match for me!

19
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:24,000
They've found me!!!

20
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:27,166
Then it's a good thing they're
no match for you, isn't it?

21
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:34,958
Hi guys...

22
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:37,041
What are you doing
out here, Krory?

23
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,333
Hey!

24
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:41,916
Lavi...! Bookman...!

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,083
You... shouldn't
sneak up on people.

26
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,208
I hear Krory's been sent
out on his first mission...

27
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:03,083
I hope he does all right.

28
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,916
I wouldn't worry about him...

29
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,458
After all he's been through,
I bet he can handle anything...

30
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:11,833
Well... Almost anything.

31
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,875
Tell me Lavi...

32
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,625
Did you come here to
help me on my mission?

33
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,791
Komui asked me to join you.

34
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,916
I don't need anyone to
keep an eye on me, you know.

35
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm going to a region
that's had a rash

36
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:36,791
of strange
disappearances lately...

37
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:40,416
Villagers from several towns
in the area have gone missing...

38
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,041
It is up to me alone
to solve this mystery.

39
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:45,083
Well, it's obvious
you can't wait.

40
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:47,166
You have no idea.

41
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:52,083
When I solve the case,
I'll be a hero!

42
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:55,583
The townsfolk will shower me
with praise and affection!

43
00:03:55,666 --> 00:04:00,333
In fact, I've even started
working on my autograph!

44
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:02,666
Nice...

45
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,041
Words can't express my delight

46
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,166
in joining such a
noble profession...

47
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,708
It's exactly what I've been
searching for my whole life.

48
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,958
Yeah, yeah.

49
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,833
Wait up!

50
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,291
There's a village up ahead.

51
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:20,916
Never fear, gentle villagers!

52
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,875
Your hero has arrived!

53
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,041
That stained glass window...

54
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,833
It must be the reflection
we saw from a distance.

55
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:39,416
Well...

56
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,625
It seems the air in this village
is unnaturally calm and pure.

57
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:45,458
It is, now that you mention it.

58
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:48,375
So the village we're in now--

59
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,833
Is... here...

60
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,791
The Xs mark the towns that
have reported disappearances...

61
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:56,708
That's almost every
other town in the area...

62
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:59,916
I'm sure it's only a matter of
time until it happens here.

63
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,958
Yes...!

64
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,208
And with people
strangely vanishing,

65
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,875
the townsfolk must be
living in constant fear!

66
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,250
Perhaps not constant,

67
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:13,791
but nevertheless,
I'm here...! I'll save them!

68
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:15,791
Anything unusual, huh?

69
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:18,041
Something out of the ordinary...

70
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,125
It could be an event,
or even an animal...

71
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:21,291
Anything at all.

72
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:22,333
Can't help you.

73
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,750
Thanks anyway.

74
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:26,750
Finding clues is
harder than I thought.

75
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:29,166
Do you want to hear
something really neat?

76
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:32,958
We have a monster...!
He's at my house now!

77
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,958
A monster, you say?

78
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:42,083
This is where you say
we'll find the monster?

79
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:43,375
Yeah!

80
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,500
Ah...! Didn't expect
you back so soon.

81
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:47,125
Hi, Papa!

82
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:50,166
These people wanted to
come and see the monster.

83
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,375
So that's it, then...

84
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,875
Hey, Monster...! Come here!

85
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:57,916
Were you calling for me?

86
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,125
That's it...

87
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,083
No doubt about it.

88
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,708
My fangs never lie...!

89
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:06,291
And my fangs are telling me--

90
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:07,791
That's an Akuma!

91
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:09,000
Akuma?

92
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:11,750
A demon that lives
to destroy humans!

93
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:14,416
What... I am?

94
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,666
Who are you people?

95
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,250
We've been sent to help you...

96
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:18,458
We're Exorcists.

97
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:20,125
Oh, I was afraid of that.

98
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:21,458
Keep your family back...

99
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,833
This monster will
never kill again!

100
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,125
Kill...?! Not me...!
I'm innocent...!

101
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,416
I've never killed
anybody in my life!

102
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,541
Gimme a break...

103
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:32,250
Tell us what you're
planning to do...

104
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:33,458
Don't hurt me!

105
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:34,666
I'm not planning anything!

106
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,416
I'm just a hired farm hand...

107
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,291
I promise you...!
You have to believe me!

108
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,250
He's lying.

109
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:42,666
When I first came to this town,

110
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,166
the people here were scared...

111
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,208
They'd never seen
anyone that looked like me.

112
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:11,958
But soon... they saw
I didn't want to hurt anyone.

113
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:14,125
And they welcomed me.

114
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:15,583
Here!

115
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,916
After that, the villagers
gave me a home...

116
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,875
They taught me how good it feels
to work hard and earn a living.

117
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,416
I could never hurt the people
that have been so good to me.

118
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,250
I won't be taken in
by the lies of an Akuma!

119
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,375
Leave him alone!

120
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,583
Ow...! Stop that...!

121
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:52,958
I'm trying to stop him
from killing you guys!

122
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:55,250
Our friend here would
never do a thing like that.

123
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,250
Huh?

124
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,375
You can learn a
lot about somebody

125
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,000
by working along side 'em.

126
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:01,416
And this fella here is
about as decent as they come.

127
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,583
This thing?

128
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,333
Sure, he may look
like an evil monster...

129
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,875
But he's as much a part
of this town as I am...

130
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,416
And we're not gonna
let you hurt him.

131
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:14,000
Thank you, Boss...!
Thank you, everyone.

132
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:16,958
Leave it to an Akuma to
deceive an entire village.

133
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:23,333
What's wrong with you...?
Let me go!

134
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:24,583
What is it?

135
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:27,625
It's possible...
he's telling the truth.

136
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:35,625
Eliade was the same way.

137
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:36,916
I have a feeling...

138
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,333
...that an Akuma
with a good heart

139
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:41,041
actually could coexist
peacefully with others.

140
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,500
So we leave an Akuma free
to roam around the village...?

141
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:47,166
People could end up dead
because of your "feeling"!

142
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,041
That's true.

143
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,291
There's trouble!

144
00:08:54,250 --> 00:09:04,208
Run...! They've wiped out Adel!

145
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:10,833
Run...! They've wiped out Adel!

146
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,541
I was in Adel only yesterday

147
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:13,916
delivering another
shipment of milk,

148
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,791
and nothing at all seemed
out of the ordinary...

149
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,625
And today it's this...

150
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,333
Everyone in the village is gone.

151
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:22,166
Down to the last soul.

152
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,500
Ah... I see.

153
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:24,500
Let me guess...

154
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,208
An Akuma did this, right?

155
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:29,083
So... it was the
Akuma in town after all.

156
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:30,666
Seems so...

157
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,166
And judging by the amount of
damage that thing left behind...

158
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,666
It's moved up to a higher level.

159
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,000
If we don't do something fast...

160
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,166
The entire region
will be destroyed.

161
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:45,166
I will stop it...! Or my
name's not Arystar Krory.

162
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,583
The entire town?

163
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,708
I don't know for certain
if what they said was true,

164
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:53,291
but I do know that something
terrible killed those folks.

165
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,958
But if it is true,
then that must mean

166
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:58,291
everyone who went missing
before was killed too!

167
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:06,416
That gentle creature
is crying just like... me.

168
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,500
Do you know where the
Akuma was yesterday?

169
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,041
You just don't let up, do you?

170
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:11,916
You keep saying he's an Akuma...

171
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,833
But he's not...!

172
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,125
As a matter of fact,

173
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,250
he's been working in
the field with us all day!

174
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,666
And at night?

175
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,208
He stays in a little cabin
outside of the village...

176
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:20,875
The boss lets
him use it, okay...

177
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:22,250
Is there anything else?

178
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,666
Do you really still suspect
that precious Akuma...?

179
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,583
Just look at the
way he's crying...!

180
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,666
That poor thing
isn't our villain.

181
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,000
I hope you're right.

182
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:31,375
Of course I'm right...!

183
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,416
It seems that short of
capturing the actual Akuma,

184
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,500
there's nothing that
will convince you...

185
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,875
I'll have to find
the true killer myself.

186
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,291
Our town could easily be next!

187
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:45,500
Starting tonight,

188
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:47,291
every available man
will guard the village.

189
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:50,458
What we're after has taken out
whole communities before...

190
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:54,250
I don't know if we have what
it takes to stop this thing.

191
00:10:56,916 --> 00:11:00,166
But... you do have that.

192
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:03,375
The stained glass window...

193
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:05,541
Come to think of it, there's
an old legend that says

194
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:08,875
that window has the power
to drive away evil spirits.

195
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:11,625
This isn't the time to rely
on old wives' tales everybody!

196
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:12,875
You're right...

197
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:14,541
The responsible thing is
to clear out the church

198
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:17,708
in case we need to use it as a
shelter when the demon comes.

199
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,583
Is there anything
I can do to help out?

200
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:20,875
Thank you, friend.

201
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:23,416
If only all monsters
were as wonderful as you.

202
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,458
Boss...

203
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,208
Is it okay if
I stand guard, too?

204
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:29,083
Of course...

205
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:30,291
I'll give you a post tomorrow,

206
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:32,291
but for tonight just
try to get some rest.

207
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,250
Thanks... I will...

208
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,291
Well, see you tomorrow then.

209
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:38,583
We'll be patrolling
the village...

210
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:41,416
Toma, you keep an
eye on that Akuma.

211
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:55,166
The air... It changed!

212
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,125
Grow...! Grow...! Grow!

213
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:11,250
This atmosphere isn't the
same as the air in the village!

214
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,416
Why hello there!

215
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,875
You scared me...

216
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:28,375
I thought you
might be the demon!

217
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,708
I didn't mean to scare you.

218
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,250
Huh...

219
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:55,958
I didn't make it.

220
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,250
It's that Akuma!

221
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:09,333
I promise...

222
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:11,750
I will destroy this monster.

223
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:20,083
I'm coming!

224
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,500
He's still close by!

225
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:25,208
Krory, no!

226
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,125
For all of the crimes
that you have committed...

227
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,666
You must die!

228
00:13:58,333 --> 00:13:59,333
Very impressive...

229
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:01,166
But still no match for me...

230
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,833
I look forward to
draining your blood!

231
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,000
You?!

232
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,958
If we don't hurry and
get this window moved

233
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:32,416
somewhere safe, who
knows what might happen...?

234
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,791
Tie it tight!

235
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,041
So... How was it?

236
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:40,041
Ah, yeah... The Akuma...

237
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:42,625
I kept watch all night

238
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:45,166
and the monster never
left its cabin until morning...

239
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:48,500
What it was doing in
there I can only guess.

240
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:52,875
I see... and Krory?

241
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,375
He's still moping...

242
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:58,166
He won't forgive himself for
letting the Akuma get away.

243
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,916
The day before
yesterday it was here...

244
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,625
Yesterday it was here...

245
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,791
What could it be after?

246
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:09,916
Perhaps it's waiting
on more Akuma.

247
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,791
You could be right!

248
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:13,958
But that wouldn't
explain why this town

249
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:15,541
is the only one that
hasn't been attacked.

250
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,541
I wonder...

251
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:30,833
Hey...! Are you okay?

252
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:34,083
Is that what I think it is?

253
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,333
Innocence...

254
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:38,458
That must be what keeps
the air here so pure.

255
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,541
A whole gang of Akuma!

256
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:46,666
I'm not surprised...

257
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,000
Now that the window's broken,

258
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:49,750
there's nothing left
to keep them at bay.

259
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,083
Well time to get to work...

260
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:52,333
Come on!

261
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:59,166
Don't go having all the fun
Grandpa, save some for me...

262
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,166
Mister Monster?

263
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:13,333
I don't understand it...

264
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:16,666
He seemed to be having
so much fun working.

265
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:26,458
After these children put their
trust in you, you betrayed them!

266
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:27,666
It didn't betray them!

267
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,333
This is the true
nature of an Akuma!

268
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:36,333
It came to this town for one
purpose and one purpose only.

269
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:38,791
Innocence!

270
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,041
The power of the Innocence

271
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,250
formed a protective
barrier around the village.

272
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:47,083
Its effect was amplified
by the stain glass window...

273
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:52,333
Level one Akuma weren't
able to penetrate the barrier...

274
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:55,500
But Level twos had
no problem getting in...

275
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:59,375
But the Innocence
reversed its personality...

276
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,541
However when it stepped
outside the barrier,

277
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:04,291
it reverted back
to its true self.

278
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:07,583
It was attacking the other
villages this whole time.

279
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,916
You thought the Akuma
had changed its evil ways,

280
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,625
but it was an illusion...

281
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,500
Oh no.

282
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:17,875
Kids! Are you all right?

283
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,708
Papa!

284
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:22,416
So... He did this to us.

285
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:27,666
How could I let it
trick me like that?

286
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:35,125
Krory!

287
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:36,750
The monster I've
so strongly defended

288
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:39,000
shows its true form at last.

289
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:44,916
What is he trying to do?

290
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,125
I believed in you...

291
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:49,708
That good Akuma
could really exist!

292
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:53,625
That crazy fool!

293
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:04,375
I missed him!

294
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,208
If this is indeed
your true self...

295
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:11,416
I will show no mercy!

296
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,791
No... He won't make it...

297
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:26,916
Stop it!

298
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,208
Don't you hurt him...!
You're being a bully!

299
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:31,666
Stay back, children!

300
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,583
This is not the gentle
monster you've come to know!

301
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:35,750
It's an Akuma!

302
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:38,291
That's not true...!
He's Mister Monster!

303
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,208
Stop Mister Monster...

304
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,666
Why don't you just go back
to how you were before...

305
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:46,125
Remember how much fun
we had playing together?

306
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:48,708
Remember?

307
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,541
This happened because of you...!

308
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:18,833
If you hadn't come, Mister
Monster wouldn't be an Akuma...!

309
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:21,083
Now he's dead
and it's all your fault!

310
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:22,291
Please...! Please...!

311
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:25,166
You have to bring
Mister Monster back!

312
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,708
Bring... him... back!

313
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:32,375
Stop it... That's enough, now.

314
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,666
I don't know if our friend
was an Akuma or a monster,

315
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:35,875
but to our families,

316
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:38,125
he was never anything
but gentle and kind.

317
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,041
It's true...

318
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,583
Maybe he wasn't human...

319
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:44,333
But even so, he wasn't
half the monster you are.

320
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,666
You're not welcome here...

321
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,541
Get out of our town... Now.

322
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:49,833
Just go away!

323
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,791
Just go away!

324
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:20,583
Congratulations on completing
your first mission, Krory!

325
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:21,833
Now you know...

326
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:24,791
The job of an Exorcist
is a thankless one...

327
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,500
We risk our lives
making people safe,

328
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,208
but if praise is
what you're after--

329
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:31,250
Maybe you shouldn't
have become an Exorcist.

330
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:32,791
You're just soft...

331
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:35,208
It's not for everyone.

332
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:37,000
Becoming an Exorcist
has made me happier

333
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:38,666
than I've ever been...

334
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,791
Huh...

335
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:47,875
For once in my life,

336
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:50,458
I've done something
good for people...

337
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,625
I protected an entire village!

338
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:53,833
Sure did.

339
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:55,416
Unless I'm mistaken,

340
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:59,208
I believe we've just witnessed
the birth of another Exorcist.

341
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:39,750
In our quest to
find General Cross,

342
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:41,916
we went to see a highly
influential supporter

343
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,125
of the Black Order--a
woman known only as Mother.

344
00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:48,375
But on the way there, we were
ambushed by a hoard of Akuma!

345
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:49,958
On the next D. Gray-man:

346
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:52,833
"The One Who Sells Souls,"
part one of two...
