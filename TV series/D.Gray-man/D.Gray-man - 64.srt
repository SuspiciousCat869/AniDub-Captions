1
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:42,000
[LAVI]
Wasn't it around here?

2
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:45,541
I don't have time for this!

3
00:01:45,625 --> 00:01:47,750
Where are you?!

4
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:51,583
[gasps]

5
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:00,541
[gasps]

6
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:08,875
It's Lenalee!

7
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:11,041
[CHOMESUKE] As you can see,
I may be an Akuma,

8
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:15,125
but I've been specially modified
by Cross Marian himself!

9
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:27,250
[KRORY gasping]

10
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:42,625
Amazing. Is that her Innocence?

11
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:43,708
[ANITA] 
Lenalee!

12
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:45,500
[ANITA grunting] 

13
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:46,166
[ANITA groans]

14
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,916
[MAHOJA] 
Master!

15
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,833
Uh. What's this noise?

16
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:59,166
It's piercing. It sounds
almost like a... a song?

17
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,583
Please. Make it stop!

18
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:02,250
Master!

19
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,708
[BOOKMAN] 
Don't!

20
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:07,416
If you're not an
Exorcist, stand back!

21
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,875
Its energy will overwhelm you.

22
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,000
[gasping]

23
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:12,333
I'm here.

24
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:13,500
Hey, old man.

25
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,541
Are you seriously
telling me this crystal

26
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,291
is actually Lenalee's Innocence?

27
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:20,125
You're missing the point if you
think that's what's important.

28
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:23,125
It protected her. Broke free
of its weaponized form

29
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:25,875
by its own volition and
then defended her.

30
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:28,625
Innocence made the choice
to save its Accommodator.

31
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,208
It's unprecedented.

32
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:33,583
What's troubling is if such a
phenomenon was always feasible,

33
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,750
why hasn't it
occurred until now?

34
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:38,083
Think of all the Exorcists
who could have been saved

35
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:40,333
if this had happened sooner.

36
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:45,166
[BOOKMAN] Did it rescue Lenalee
because somehow, she's special?

37
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,333
If so, could that mean...

38
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:50,416
This is valuable information.

39
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:52,958
[LAVI] 
Is it possible?

40
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:56,208
Could Lenalee's Innocence
really be the...

41
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,875
You think it's the Heart, huh?

42
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:02,958
[LAVI growls]

43
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,791
[CHOMESUKE screams]

44
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:08,416
What the...?! I'm on your side!

45
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,916
Jeez! You think I'm trying
to destroy it or something?

46
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,125
Like I'm supposed
to trust you!

47
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,958
I don't care if you're a
messenger sent by General Cross.

48
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:17,166
You're an Akuma.

49
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,166
I told you, I'm modified!

50
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,000
Once an Akuma, always an Akuma.

51
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,916
Poke. Poke.

52
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,041
That's enough, Lavi. Stand down.

53
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:28,583
[BOTH]
Uh?

54
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,208
This Akuma is right.

55
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:33,958
General Cross is the only man
with the power to alter them.

56
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,833
Of course, not even the
Order knows the truth.

57
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,166
Only I was aware of his ability.

58
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,250
What'd I tell you?

59
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:47,166
[BOOKMAN] Don't worry.
If Tim trusts him, we can too.

60
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,916
[LAVI grunts]

61
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,916
[MIRANDA] Uh, it's incredible.
An altered Akuma.

62
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,333
[CHOMESUKE chuckles]

63
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:54,875
Well. At the least the people
in the Science Section

64
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,000
will be grateful
meeting one up close.

65
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,583
It's you who should be
thanking me, Exorcist!

66
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,166
[LAVI] 
What?!

67
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,333
[CHOMESUKE] When you were about
to attack the Akuma in the sky,

68
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:04,875
who do you think lifted the ship

69
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:07,000
and brought it to the
surface without any help?

70
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,958
That's right! Me!

71
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:14,750
I'm still waiting.
Say thank you!

72
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:16,541
[LAVI]
You can't be serious.

73
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:17,916
[CHOMESUKE growls]

74
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,416
[LAVI sighs] I'm truly
grateful for all your help.

75
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,208
Ah! I'll pardon your insolence.

76
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,708
I'm kinda wishing the
ship had sunk now.

77
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:28,541
But still... I can't understand.

78
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:32,125
What was pulling us
down into the ocean?

79
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,750
[BOOKMAN] The most likely answer
is the Level Three Akuma

80
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,458
we encountered
possessed the ability

81
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,875
to manipulate our gravity.

82
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:41,500
That's correct!

83
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:43,875
To think you were able
to exhibit greater power

84
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:46,875
than an adversary a full level
higher is astounding.

85
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:49,166
Tell me, is modification
responsible

86
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,166
for amplifying your abilities?

87
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,833
You're asking the wrong Akuma

88
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:54,875
about the ins and outs
of modification.

89
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:57,500
But common sense is telling
me a Level Two's abilities

90
00:05:57,583 --> 00:06:00,041
are unlikely to exceed
a stronger opponent's.

91
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:02,791
I was only able to
do it this time.

92
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,916
All thanks to that
girl there! Cho!

93
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:12,916
[MIRANDA]
So, it was her.

94
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,500
She protected the
ship with her life.

95
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:16,750
[BOOKMAN]
Hmm...

96
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,583
Lenalee...

97
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:22,333
[CHOMESUKE]
We don't have much time.

98
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:25,250
I have a message to you
guys from Marian cho.

99
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:26,541
[LAVI, BOOKMAN grunt]

100
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:27,416
[gasps]

101
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,166
The General is alive.

102
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,458
He's in Japan making his way
towards Edo as we speak.

103
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,625
In order to fulfill his mission.

104
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:37,041
Uh? Mission?

105
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:39,625
Master, did you hear that?

106
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:44,833
[ANITA] 
Yes. I'm so relieved.

107
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:48,500
You said the General
hasn't reached Edo yet?

108
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:51,291
He's close to the city,
but he can't continue.

109
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,166
So what's standing in his way?

110
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,166
There's a large box there.

111
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,541
Yes. A very large box.

112
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:01,416
It's a factory for
manufacturing Akuma.

113
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,333
And General Cross's mission
is to destroy it.

114
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:05,250
[gasps]

115
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,291
[gasping]

116
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,416
Uh.

117
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,333
[EXORCISTS] So, the General
was working this entire time.

118
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:14,208
[LAVI]
That's the most shocking part.

119
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:16,458
[BOOKMAN clears throat]

120
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:18,791
[CHOMESUKE] Unfortunately, he's
encountered more obstacles

121
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:22,208
than we could have anticipated
and isn't able to proceed.

122
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,791
Then when he heard you'd been
dispatched to protect him,

123
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:27,583
he sent me to find you and
pass along a message. Cho.

124
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:31,250
[laughs] The General knows the
Noah and Akuma are after him

125
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,083
cause his Innocence
could be the Heart.

126
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:36,333
So he sent you along to ask
us for our help, right?

127
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:37,375
[CHOMESUKE] 
Wrong.

128
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:38,375
Uh...

129
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,083
The message I bring is a warning

130
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,625
advising you to stay
away from Japan.

131
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:45,833
My orders were to tell you:
You should turn back around.

132
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:48,125
You'll only slow
the General down.

133
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:50,500
[LAVI, MIRANDA gasp]

134
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,500
We need more information.

135
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,250
Cho.

136
00:07:56,708 --> 00:08:01,041
[CHOMESUKE] Japan is already
under the Earl's control.

137
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:04,041
And Edo is dead in the center.

138
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:07,500
It's a nest of Level Three Akuma
and much, much worse.

139
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:10,708
If you go there,
you'll most likely die.

140
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:15,416
Uh! Now what?

141
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,416
[BOOKMAN]
Hm?

142
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:33,083
I can see her now!
The light is fading away!

143
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,375
[MIRANDA] 
Lenalee!

144
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,833
[LAVI]
She's alive!

145
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,791
Lenalee!

146
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,333
[LAVI gasping]

147
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:12,000
[LENALEE]
Lavi. Tell me. Am I here?

148
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:16,375
I mean... Am I still
a part of this world?

149
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,000
[LAVI] 
You dummy...

150
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:33,791
[BOOKMAN] If we enter Japan,
suffering awaits us.

151
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:37,083
Greater than any we've
encountered so far.

152
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:40,000
Do we go forward. Or not?

153
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:43,791
Which will it be?
What path do we choose?

154
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,416
[gasps]

155
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:54,000
Let's move on.
There's no turning back now.

156
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:57,041
It'd be a betrayal to everyone
who sacrificed their life

157
00:09:57,125 --> 00:10:01,208
so we could get this far.
I won't let that happen.

158
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:03,041
[LENALEE gasping]

159
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:05,666
[LENALEE] 
My legs...

160
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:07,916
[LENALEE]
Even with Miranda's help,

161
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,666
they still haven't recovered.

162
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,250
It must be from
releasing my Innocence.

163
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:15,416
This is bad. I can't even stand.

164
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,666
Well, Lenalee. I agree.

165
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,333
Me, too.

166
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:18,916
[MIRANDA]
Mm-hm!

167
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,125
You guys...

168
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:23,500
I can't pretend we're not
exhausted after that,

169
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:27,041
but still, when has that
ever stopped us before?

170
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,583
[laughs]

171
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,541
[LAVI] 
Onward.

172
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,000
[BOOKMAN]
Mm.

173
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,666
[LAVI] 
To Edo!

174
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:43,416
[CHOMESUKE] 
Ready?!

175
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,875
Cho! Cho! Cho! Cho!
Cho! Cho! Cho...

176
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:50,500
...Cho!

177
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:51,666
Cho! Cho! Cho! Cho! Cho!

178
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,083
Cho! Cho! Cho! Cho...

179
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,708
...Cho-oh!

180
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:01,250
[LAVI]
Woo-hoo! Now we're talkin'!

181
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:02,875
Akuma are impressive!

182
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:04,916
You're spending tons
of energy, Chomesuke.

183
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,250
How long do you think
you can you keep this up?

184
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,708
"Chomesuke"?

185
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:11,750
All this time and that's the
nickname you came up with?

186
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,625
It's actually kinda cute.

187
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,541
I don't have enough
time to get distracted!

188
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,333
I have to get you to Edo!

189
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:20,541
Enough time? Whaddya have to
meet a deadline or somethin'?

190
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,041
Let me worry about it.

191
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,500
Cho! Cho! Cho! Cho! Cho! Cho...

192
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:25,791
[LENALEE]
I know danger's waiting,

193
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,958
but the sooner we arrive
in Edo the better.

194
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:31,125
Miranda's fatigue is
getting pretty severe.

195
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:32,541
The Time Record.

196
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,791
All the damage we accumulated
during the Akuma attack

197
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,916
is beginning to pour in.

198
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,500
You can see it's a
taken a toll on her.

199
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,291
[MIRANDA gasping]

200
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,166
How are you holding up, Miranda?

201
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,750
I... I'm sorry.

202
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:47,000
I failed to protect everyone.

203
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,125
Lavi... No...

204
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,916
No. I'm the one who's sorry.

205
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,416
I'm so sorry, but... I can't.

206
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,916
I can't hold out
until we reach Edo.

207
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,666
Don't worry about it.

208
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,875
[MIRANDA] 
You don't get it.

209
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:02,250
Huh?

210
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:06,958
It's my power. When it stops
working everything...

211
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,958
...will revert to real time.

[gasps]

213
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,791
Additionally, if you die,

214
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:18,583
I don't have the ability to
rewind time to bring you back.

215
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,250
Miranda...

216
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:25,541
You aren't the only
Exorcist here.

217
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:28,625
You don't have to carry
this burden alone.

218
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:30,666
We're right beside you.

219
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,750
This is the path we chose,
and we'll walk it together.

[SAILORS grunting]

00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:02,500
I know. It won't be long.

[LENALEE] 
Anita!

226
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:07,083
Come in.

[LENALEE] 
Excuse me.

00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,750
What is it?

229
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,500
Your clip.

230
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:20,500
I'm sorry. I lost the other one
in the ocean during the battle.

231
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:22,958
I understand if you hate me.

232
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:31,083
All that matters is you
returned safely.

233
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:34,416
Thank you, Anita.

Please, let me give it back.

Would you tie my hair?

237
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:54,166
Of course! You know,
I think I survived

238
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:58,916
because your mother's hair
clip was protecting me.

239
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,125
I hope it watches over you

240
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:04,250
and keeps you safe,
like it's done for me.

I'm sure it will.

Is something wrong?

Please make me a promise.

[MAHOJA] Master. The work
is finished as you asked.

Stop the ship!

Go summon the Exorcists and
Akuma to join us on the deck!

Eerie. Is it just me

or does it feel like we're
all aboard a ghost ship?

Yeah. You got a point.

Where's the crew?

Don't tell me...

I apologize, but I've
informed the men

257
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:40,333
it wouldn't be necessary
to see you off.

They're below deck right now

to be spent in revelry.

Heh. They knew
the danger going in.

268
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:09,916
We're supporters because our
families were killed by Akuma.

269
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,125
And the only thing that
kept us alive this long

270
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:14,625
was our desire for revenge.

271

No one on this ship
has any regrets.

That's the absolute truth.

You made an oath.

Edo and it fills us with joy

that possible for you.

00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:52,125
What was my dream about?

323
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:55,083
Walker! It's time
for your training!

324
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:00,916
[FO yells]

325
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,958
[ALLEN gasping]

326
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:06,000
[FO, ALLEN grunting]

327
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,833
[yells]

328
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,375
[ALLEN grunts]

329
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:19,083
[BAK] The only thing we can
do is keep believing in him.

330
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:21,375
[ALLEN grunts]

331
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:22,500
[yelling]

332
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:23,375
Uh?

333
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:24,791
Fo!

334
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:28,416
[FO grunts]

335
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,000
[ALLEN gasping]

336
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:32,708
[FO laughs]

337
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:40,000
[ALLEN panting]

338
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:41,458
[FO laughs]

339
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,083
One more time!

340
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:47,541
Uh? [laughs]

341
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,166
I won't stop.

342
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:56,666
Not until I can go back to my
comrades and fight with them!

343
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:35,666
[ALLEN]
Lenalee and the other Exorcists

344
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:38,708
finally arrive in Japan, and
make their way towards Edo

345
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:41,583
to meet with General
Cross. However,

346
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:45,791
the Black Order aren't the only
ones looking for my master.

347
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:51,125
[ALLEN] On the next
<i>D.Gray-man</i> : "Landing."
