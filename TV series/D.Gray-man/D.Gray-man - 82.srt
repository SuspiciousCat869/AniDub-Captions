00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:31,791
[ALLEN]
Hm? Why aren't they screaming?

161
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:37,583
What seems to be the problem?
You're awfully quiet over there.

162
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,750
Tree Stamp.

163
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,625
Now, Wind.

164
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,833
[LERO yelps]
He's sweeping up the keys

165
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:58,125
into that crazy whirlwind, Lero!

166
00:08:58,208 --> 00:08:59,875
[ALLEN]
Hurry, Lavi!

167
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:03,291
\The sooner we escape this
wretched place, the better!

168
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:09,166
[ALLEN] Lavi's the next Bookman.
If anybody has a good enough

169
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,375
memory to find
the key, it's him!

170
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,791
[LERO coughs]

171
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:19,083
[CHAOZII, LENALEE cough]

172
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,041
[LENALEE]
Huh?

173
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:23,750
Where did all the keys go?

174
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,125
[CHAOZII, LENALEE]
Huh?

175
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:29,666
Lavi!

176
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,541
[LAVI] Okay. I'm only
working with one eye,

177
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:50,833
so it won't be
very fast, but...

178
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:56,375
[DEVIT] Hey wait, is that guy
part of the Bookman family?

179
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,875
[ALLEN]
Huh? They're talking again!

180
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,916
Oh, I see. That makes sense.

181
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,958
So they're on your
side now, huh?

182
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:06,916
[ALLEN gasps]

183
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,291
[JASDERO]
Ugh!

184
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:11,833
Plus, that ugly red hair of
his reminds me of Cross!

185
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,625
[DEVIT] Oh yeah, you're right!
Now I'm getting all pissed off!

186
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,541
[JASDERO]
Well, I'm feeling slimy!

187
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:19,041
My grudge against Cross
is covering my pure heart

188
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,541
with sludge! A sludgy grudge!

189
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,916
[DEVIT] And his worthless
apprentice won't pay his debt!

190
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,208
[JASDERO]
Pay it off, right now!

191
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,458
[ALLEN]
For the last time, no!

192
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:33,583
[KRORY] Don't mind them, Allen.
Focus on holding them still.

193
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:37,041
I'll make quick work of these
reprehensible children.

194
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,375
Uh, okay.

195
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,166
[JASDERO]
Sludgy.

196
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,958
[ALLEN gasps]

197
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,583
[ALLEN shouts]

198
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:48,250
[ALLEN whimpers]

199
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:49,500
[KRORY]
What?

200
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:52,333
[ALLEN, KRORY shout]

201
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:53,541
What is this?

202
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:57,500
I. I can't bite through!
Unhand us!

203
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:58,875
[DEVIT]
How stupid are you?

204
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,666
[JASDERO]
Kiss my ass!

205
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,000
[JASDERO, DEVIT]
That's our grudge!

206
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,750
And you're its dinner!

207
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:06,750
[ALLEN, KRORY grunt] 

208
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:07,250
No!

209
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,750
Not good.

210
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:15,541
That monster! It's got them!

211
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:16,041
[LENALEE grunts]

212
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,416
No! Lenalee!

213
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,833
[ALLEN, KRORY grunting]

214
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:21,166
[LENALEE]
Allen!

215
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:25,666
[ALLEN gasps] L-Lenalee.
No, you have to stay back!

216
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,583
[LENALEE grunts, gasps]

217
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:36,916
What's happening? My legs!
I can't move them at all!

218
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,583
[ALLEN grunts]

219
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,000
Come on!

220
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,000
[DEVIT] What's the matter?
Are you stuck?

221
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:49,500
That's too bad for you,
but it's great for us.

222
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,416
The old man seems to know
how to track us, so...

223
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,625
[LENALEE gasps]

224
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,916
[JASDERO] ...you can
be our shield! He, he!

225
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,416
[JASDERO, DEVIT]
We got your princess!

226
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,666
[gungshots]

227
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,916
[grunts]

228
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,000
[JASDERO, DEVIT gasp]

229
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:06,750
[ALLEN]
Don't touch her.

230
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,416
Get away from Lenalee!

231
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,958
[DEVIT] Uh-oh.
Looks like we hit a nerve.

232
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,958
Fine, come and get her!

233
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:14,458
[ALLEN grunts]

234
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:15,708
Be careful!

235
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,708
[ALLEN grunts]

236
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,041
Sit tight, apprentice,

237
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:20,958
we've got another
surprise up our sleeve!

238
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,541
[grunts]

239
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:25,708
[JASDERO, DEVIT]
Let's all welcome a very,

240
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:28,541
very special guest!

241
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:32,500
Hiding unfathomable
rage behind a big smile.

242
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:37,291
The one and only...
Millennium Earl!

243
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,541
[ALLEN grunts]

244
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,083
The Earl?

245
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,958
[grunts]
His power is real!

246
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:54,208
[LERO grunts]

247
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,250
[ALLEN grunts]

248
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:59,125
This is crazy!
What am I gonna do?

249
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:01,208
[LERO chuckles]

250
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:03,916
[LERO] That's not the real
Millennium Earl, Lero.

251
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,375
It's just a copy created
from Jasdevi's imagination.

252
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:09,833
All the details are right
though! Down to the

253
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:13,666
cheerful grin that disguises
his indomitable anger, Lero.

254
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:18,250
The twin Noahs' specialty
is materialization.

255
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:21,916
It's pretty handy! All Jasdero
and Devit have to do

256
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,541
is imagine the same thing
at the same time, Lero.

257
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:28,500
And then whatever they dream
up will pop into existence

258
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:31,625
right before their
very eyes, Lero!

259
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:39,000
[ALLEN grunts]

260
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:44,000
[gasps] Let me go! Get me
out of here right now!

261
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,416
Don't yell!

262
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,208
Shut your mouth, woman!
Or I'll have to shut it for you!

263
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:52,625
[groans] We don't give a damn
about the rest of you anyway!

264
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,666
[DEVIT] All we care
about is taking out that

265
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,625
pain-in-the-ass
Allen Walker.

266
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:02,666
We just want to use you as
a pawn. Stupid loudmouth girl.

267
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,208
[LENALEE grunts]

268
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:07,541
[DEVIT grunts]

269
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:11,958
[JASDERO yells]

270
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:14,041
You guys are awful.

271
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:17,166
Playing around with
people's lives like toys.

272
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,750
You're the same age as us,

273
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:22,000
but you act like a
couple of spoiled kids!

274
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,416
Are you trying to look cool?

275
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,541
Because it doesn't
impress me at all.

276
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,875
You're just being childish!

277
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:31,916
Allen is stronger than
you two put together,

278
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,583
because he knows
life is precious!

279
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,416
Lenalee!

280
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,000
Come on, Earl,
get out of my way!

281
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:41,916
[ALLEN]
Fine.

282
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,500
Cross Grave!

283
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:46,750
[gasps]

284
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:52,166
[ALLEN grunts]

285
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,416
[ALLEN grunts]

286
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,583
[ALLEN]
I attacked him head-on,

287
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:04,000
but there's not
a scratch on him!

288
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:08,166
Fat buffoon!

289
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:12,666
[KRORY grunts]

290
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,166
[ALLEN]
Edge End!

291
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,875
[ALLEN, KRORY gasp]

292
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,625
[ALLEN, KRORY shout]

293
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,000
[LERO]
Huh?

294
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,916
[ALLEN] I don't really know
what we're dealing with here,

295
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,083
but it's not gonna be easy.

296
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:38,625
Curses.

297
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:41,666
I can't stand being defeated
by someone that out of shape.

298
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:45,125
[LERO laughs] That thing may not
be the real Millennium Earl,

299
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:48,458
but I wouldn't let my guard
down if I were you, Lero!

300
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:52,333
[KRORY, ALLEN] Not real?
Well, that explains a lot.

301
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:54,250
[KRORY]
Whatever it is,

302
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:57,625
it isn't going to stop us
from rescuing Lenalee.

303
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,833
[KRORY, ALLEN gasp]

304
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:05,500
[LENALEE gasps, coughs]

305
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:06,833
[DEVIT]
Next time you'll think twice

306
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:09,291
before you mouth off at us.

307
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:14,041
[DEVIT chuckles] "Ooh, Allen is
stronger than the two of you

308
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:16,458
put together!" she says.
That's rich.

309
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:17,875
You don't know
how wrong you are.

310
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,750
[JASDERO laughs]
Man, look at 'em go!

311
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,333
[ALLEN grunts]

312
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,583
What is the matter
with you, Allen?

313
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:28,708
Just forget about the Earl
and go save Lenalee!

314
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:32,666
It's not that easy. Someone has
to keep him off my back.

315
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:36,791
I'm sorry. Despite how
it looks, I am trying.

316
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,541
You worry about her.

317
