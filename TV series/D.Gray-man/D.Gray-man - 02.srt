1
00:01:38,916 --> 00:01:41,166
Exorcists...

2
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,666
Chosen, by God Himself...

3
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:49,208
They exist to destroy the evil
that lurks in the darkness...

4
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:53,041
an evil that brings pain and
suffering to the world.

5
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,083
Who... Who in their right mind

6
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:09,791
would build a headquarters
in a place like this?

7
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,541
I finally made it...

8
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:26,833
Exorcist Headquarters...

9
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:29,750
The Black Order.

10
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,250
Creepy.

11
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,166
You know I'd heard about
these headquarters before,

12
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,916
but... how can I put this...?

13
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,875
I'm getting a spooky
feeling about this place.

14
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:41,541
There's only one way
to find out, isn't there?

15
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,666
All right, well
here goes nothing.

16
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:55,791
Who's the kid?

17
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:58,958
Well, I'm not sure, but he
did make it up the cliff.

18
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:01,166
He's walking to the door!

19
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,541
Why is there a
child out there...?

20
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:06,250
You know we don't
tolerate outsiders...

21
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:07,875
Someone go out there
and push the kid off.

22
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,583
I don't think that'd
be a good idea...

23
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:10,750
Judging from the look of him

24
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:13,291
I seriously doubt he
just wandered here.

25
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,208
Hey Brother, check this out.

26
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:16,333
Look at that marking.

27
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:18,041
That's General Cross' Golem...

28
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:18,833
See?

29
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:20,041
She's right everyone.

30
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,333
Hello? Anyone home?

31
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:24,375
My name's Allen Walker
and I was referred here

32
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,583
by General Cross Marian...

33
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:31,041
I'm here to request a meeting
with an executive of the Order.

34
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,000
He's General Cross' apprentice?

35
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,083
I thought that the
General was dead?

36
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,416
The kid said he's
here on referral...

37
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,750
Do you know anything
about that, Chief Komui?

38
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,166
Afraid not.

39
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,333
Well...

40
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:51,083
Have the Gatekeeper
do a physical exam.

41
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:58,416
Oh, hello.

42
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,791
Prepare for an X-ray
exam to determine

43
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,875
if you are a human or Akuma!

44
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,291
What's wrong with this thing?

45
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:14,291
I can't get a reading.

46
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:23,875
Failure!!!

47
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,916
What?!

48
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,625
He has the mark!
The mark of evil on his face!

49
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,125
He fails!

50
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,041
A pentacle is the
mark of an Akuma...!

51
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:34,041
He's a minion for
the Millennium Earl!

52
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:36,041
He's come to kill us!!

53
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,875
He's a spy! A spy!

54
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:44,250
Hey... Don't we have an
exorcist around here?

55
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,083
Very funny Reever.

56
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,041
Kanda's already on the move.

57
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,041
You're either
fearless or stupid

58
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:03,083
for showing your
face here alone.

59
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:04,250
Hold on!

60
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,166
I think there's been
a misunderstanding!!

61
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,333
Mighty Mugen, unsheathe!

62
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:33,541
He damaged my Anti-Akuma Weapon!

63
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:34,791
You all right...?

64
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:37,083
Your arm is about to explode.

65
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:38,708
It's my Anti-Akuma Weapon...

66
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:40,708
After all I am an exorcist.

67
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,375
Huh?

68
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:44,416
Gatekeeper!

69
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,250
But he has a
pentacle on his face...!

70
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,625
Just because he says he's
human doesn't mean he is...!

71
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:50,750
I'd rather be safe than sorry!

72
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:52,250
But I am a human you idiot!

73
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,583
I admit that I'm cursed,
but I'm an exorcist!

74
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,666
I swear it's true!

75
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,500
That's enough.

76
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:06,291
The only way to know
for sure is to cut you open!

77
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,291
Prepare to be slaughtered...

78
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,916
...by the mighty Mugen!

79
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:16,916
What...?

80
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,041
Wait, I'm telling you
people the truth

81
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:19,208
and I can prove it, believe me!

82
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:20,333
There should have
been a referral letter

83
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,750
sent b-b-b-b-by
Master Cross himself!

84
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:29,000
A letter...

85
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:30,500
from the General?

86
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,000
Yeah.

87
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,416
It was addressed to
some guy named Komui.

88
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:38,833
Hey you! Over there!

89
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:40,458
Ye... Yes, sir?

90
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,541
Find the letter!
It's on my desk!

91
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,583
It may take awhile.

92
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,916
That's a tall order, Chief.

93
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,083
Are you serious Komui?

94
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,166
I'll give you a hand!

95
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,750
Oh crap!

96
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:57,000
That's not it...
Neither is that...

97
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,166
And it's not that one...

98
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,000
Here! I found it!

99
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:03,541
It's addressed
from General Cross!

100
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:04,625
Read it man!

101
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,166
Dear Komui...

102
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,375
I will be sending a kid
named Allen Walker to you.

103
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:10,875
Take good care of him...

104
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:11,916
Oh crap.

105
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,708
Great... Sounds <i>good</i> to me...

106
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:15,875
Hey there, Reever...

107
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:17,750
You should stop Kanda.

108
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,791
I gotta go refill my coffee.

109
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:22,583
Maybe you could clean up
your office on the way there!!

110
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:24,041
Kanda! I need you
to stand down!

111
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,166
Stop the attack!

112
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,916
He's friendly!
I repeat: He's friendly!

113
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,125
Lenalee.

114
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:32,875
Hey...

115
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,416
What's up?

116
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,250
Do your brother a favor and
help me get ready, would you?

117
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:37,583
With what?

118
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,583
It looks like we're going
to be having a visitor.

119
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:42,708
Fine... OPEN!!!

120
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,166
So the kid was sent by Cross.

121
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,083
Sounds like a perfect
candidate for appraisal.

122
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:54,875
Allen Walker.
Your access has been granted.

123
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:56,333
Hey Komui...

124
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:57,958
Mind filling me in?

125
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:58,875
Sorry about that.

126
00:07:58,958 --> 00:07:59,791
The kid checks out.

127
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:02,041
He's General Cross' apprentice.

128
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,916
Plus, having Timcanpy with him

129
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,833
is proof enough,
wouldn't you say?

130
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:08,541
Give credit where
credit is due, sir.

131
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:09,958
Okay... Section Leader...

132
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,125
Let's apoligize.

133
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:13,083
But I didn't do anything wrong!

134
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,541
Let him go, Kanda.

135
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:15,875
He's one of us.

136
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:19,041
Please...? Please, please,
please please please?

137
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:22,458
Kanda, stop it!

138
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:25,041
Enough with the
macho head-games.

139
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:28,083
Now you two get inside
before I close the gate.

140
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:30,208
I said to get in.

141
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,458
Nice meeting you.

142
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,666
I'm Lenalee, the
Chief's Assistant.

143
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,541
Uhh... Kanda?

144
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:46,208
Uh... Please tell me
I got your name right.

145
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:49,583
No hard feelings?

146
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,416
What fool would
actually shake your hand

147
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,541
knowing that you're cursed.

148
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,250
Don't mind him...

149
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,958
He's been on edge since he got
back from his last assignment.

150
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,375
Look at the new guy.

151
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,458
He looks like he's
twelve years old.

152
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,708
But if he's so young,
then what's with his hair?

153
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:11,875
It's pure white.

154
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:13,583
Rumor is he's cursed.

155
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:16,958
It'll be interesting to
see how he handles the job.

156
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:20,041
Yeah but innocence has
nothing to do with age.

157
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,083
So this is it...

158
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:25,666
The Black Order.

159
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:31,791
And here's the dining hall.

160
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:34,250
This entire floor is
the training area...

161
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,541
It consists of
three different layers.

162
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,291
Here's the lounge...

163
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:42,250
And there's also the
sanatorium, a library,

164
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,083
and the dormitory
for the staff...

165
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,708
I can show you those later.

166
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:46,958
If they're not on assignments,

167
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:49,041
this is where exorcists
spend all their time...

168
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,208
In fact most of them

169
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,416
start calling our
headquarters their home.

170
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,833
That's nice...

171
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,958
Just like... a family.

172
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:59,291
Though every once in a while
someone leaves on purpose,

173
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:00,250
but it's rare.

174
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,375
Like Master Cross.

175
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:03,875
Where is General Cross?

176
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:06,125
You two went to India
at some point, right?

177
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:09,708
We did... about
three months ago.

178
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,916
Allen, sit down.

179
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Yes... Master.

180
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,583
Can you believe it's
been three years

181
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,416
since you became
my apprentice...?

182
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,333
You've shown enormous
progress in your path

183
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,666
to becoming an exorcist.

184
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,833
That's why as of
today you can officially

185
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:27,708
call yourself a full-fledged
professional exorcist.

186
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,458
Are you serious?

187
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:30,625
Sort of.

188
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,250
First you have to agree
on paying a visit

189
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:35,083
to the Exorcist
Headquarters for me.

190
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:39,875
Wait, you... do know where
Headquarters are, don't you?

191
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:41,250
Yeah.

192
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:44,333
I'll leave Timcanpy with you.

193
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:47,625
I've already sent a
referral letter earlier today

194
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,708
to an executive named Komui...

195
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:52,666
So leave first thing
in the morning.

196
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,833
Let me guess...

197
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,916
You're not coming
with me... are you?

198
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,166
Hell no. I'd rather lose a
thumb than go back there!

199
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:05,125
Wait, so your Master knocked you
unconscious and then ran off?

200
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:06,500
Yeah.

201
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,583
Where are we now?

202
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:11,333
I'll let my brother answer that.

203
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:13,166
Ouh, hello there...!

204
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,583
I am Komui Lee...

205
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:16,250
Chief of the Science Division!

206
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,291
On behalf of the staff
I'd like to welcome you.

207
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,833
And sorry about the trouble
earlier. What a pain

208
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,875
Don't look at us!!

209
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,750
Come over here and put
your arm under the light.

210
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,083
Huh?

211
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:29,750
I understand you received
some damage earlier...

212
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:32,333
You know when Kanda
attacked you unprovoked.

213
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:34,833
You shouldn't have
to endure such pain.

214
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,958
Just as I thought. The
nerve system is damaged.

215
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,875
Lenalee, anesthesia.

216
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:43,666
For the boy.

217
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,166
Okay.

218
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,208
Can you activate it?

219
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,625
Uh... sure.

220
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,083
Activate.

221
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,625
Interesting...

222
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,083
You're a Parasite Type.

223
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,125
Wait, I'm... a what?

224
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:01,708
Yes... Anyone who
can turn their body

225
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,416
into a weapon has a type...

226
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,416
Your parasitic type is
one of the rarest forms

227
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,333
of all Anti-Akuma Weapons.

228
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:08,541
So...

229
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,083
I don't think I want to
know what that thing is for.

230
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,916
Aww... afraid...?

231
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,541
You shouldn't be because
when I get done with you,

232
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,583
you'll be good as new,
though I must warn you,

233
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,416
this will be traumatic.

234
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:22,958
Hold on!

235
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:24,000
Now!

236
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,041
I hate that sound.

237
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:30,375
I feel for the poor kid.

238
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,666
Sorry about that.

239
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,291
My brother has a habit
of getting carried away.

240
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:38,666
I... didn't realize this
guy was related to you.

241
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,500
You're going there
after this, aren't you...?

242
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:41,833
Wouldn't it be a good
idea to make sure

243
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:44,500
that he's human before you
go through the process?

244
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,791
Not this time...

245
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,000
I know he's human.

246
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,750
How is that?

247
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:53,500
It's simple...

248
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,458
Humans are the only
species known to man

249
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,458
to be susceptible to curses.

250
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,541
Your arm is fixed, but you'll
have to wait until tomorrow

251
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:03,208
for the anesthesia to wear
off before you use it.

252
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:06,416
I need to make sure to
never break my arm again.

253
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:09,750
Don't get down on yourself.

254
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,333
The advantages of
being a Parasite Type

255
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,583
far outweigh the negatives.

256
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,125
Having that ability
makes you part of

257
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:18,541
the chosen ones who can best
utilize the power of Innocence.

258
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:21,541
Innocence?

259
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,791
God's Innocence, to be exact...

260
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,750
The unbridled power
of omnipotence.

261
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,083
I don't understand.

262
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:38,416
Once again, God has
graced us with his presence.

263
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,750
The Great Generals...

264
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,541
These are the gentlemen
we answer to.

265
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,333
Now show them how
worthy your unique abilities

266
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,750
will be towards the cause.

267
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,541
Show... me...
your Innocence.

268
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:08,041
What are you doing?!

269
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,125
You're wasting your strength.

270
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:13,291
That arm will be useless

271
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,125
until the anesthetic
wears off tomorrow.

272
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:16,250
Komui!

273
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,916
So what do you think,
Hevlaska...?

274
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,375
Does this Apostle of God meet
your exact level of standards?

275
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,458
What are they doing to me...?

276
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:28,166
It feels weird...

277
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,375
As if something is
probing my insides.

278
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:34,625
Come on...

279
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,458
Activate!

280
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:42,875
Just do it!

281
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,458
Never activate your weapon

282
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:47,791
when your nerves are
not yet fully recovered...

283
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,250
Try to relax...

284
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm not your enemy.

285
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,000
Two percent...

286
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:06,666
Sixteen percent...

287
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,125
Thirty-one percent...

288
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,625
Fifty-seven percent...

289
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:15,416
Eighty-three percent.

290
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,250
It appears that
eighty-three percent

291
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:22,791
is the maximum synchro-rate you
and your weapon are capable of.

292
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:23,958
What's synchro-rate?

293
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:26,041
The number indicates
your ability level

294
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:29,083
when activating your
Anti-Akuma Weapon...

295
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:31,333
The lower the synchro-rate,
the more difficulty

296
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:33,875
you'll have activating,
putting you at a higher risk

297
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:36,583
for permanent damage.

298
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:40,375
I apologize.
I didn't mean to scare you...

299
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:42,875
The only way I can accurately
gauge your Innocence...

300
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,458
is through touch.

301
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:48,583
What exactly can you
learn from my Innocence?

302
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:50,833
Allen Walker...

303
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:54,083
In the future, when darkness
dominates this planet,

304
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:55,333
your Innocence will produce

305
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:58,625
an extraordinary
"Destroyer of Time."

306
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:01,541
A time... destroyer?

307
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:06,416
I have no idea what that means
but it sounds amazing...!

308
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,625
Hevlaska's prophecies are
cryptic, but they are true.

309
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:10,625
Congrats kid!

310
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:13,625
Now we can actually trust you!

311
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,791
Mind putting that
down so I can hit you?

312
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,041
Settle down...

313
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:18,250
It's our policy...

314
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,916
An involuntary Innocence
check is required...

315
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,083
That's something
I would have liked

316
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:23,875
to have been told
when I first walked in!!

317
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,750
So what else is there
to know about Innocence?

318
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,916
Tell me everything.

319
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:30,333
I was about to
explain it to you...

320
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,666
What I'm about to
tell you is secret.

321
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,541
Information only known
within the Black Order...

322
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:39,208
and to those involved
with the Millennium Earl.

323
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:42,041
It all started around
a century ago...

324
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:44,875
when a golden cube was
discovered within the Earth.

325
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,750
To the future
inhabitants of Earth...

326
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:57,166
We are the ones who
defeated the darkness,

327
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,125
but our society
soon fell into ruin.

328
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:04,166
This message is a warning...

329
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:07,458
Avoid the cataclysmic
disaster we have endured...

330
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:12,291
Heed our words, we
have little time left.

331
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:14,208
What we found inside the cube...

332
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:17,750
was a prophecy from
an ancient civilization...

333
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:20,958
and a set of
implicit instructions.

334
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,291
But... for what?

335
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,250
For the material
the cube is made of...

336
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,625
It's called the God Crystal.

337
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:31,416
Its power is astonishing...

338
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,583
And it is what we prefer
to call Innocence...

339
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:36,458
The material embedded
in your left hand

340
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:39,416
is made from the God Crystal.

341
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,375
Anti-Akuma Weapons
are Innocence that's been

342
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:44,625
processed into a useable form.

343
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,916
The original creators
of the cube battled

344
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,333
the Millennium Earl
with Innocence.

345
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:50,625
The Earl?!

346
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:00,958
They used it to
destroy the Earl...

347
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:04,541
but in the end, they destroyed
themselves as well...

348
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,875
This was referred to as Noah's
Flood in the Old Testament.

349
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:09,833
However the prophecy
inside the cube referred

350
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:13,208
to it as the "three
days of darkness."

351
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:17,958
The cube's prophecy also says...

352
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:20,541
that the world will come
to an end once more...

353
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,833
at the hands of
the Millennium Earl.

354
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:26,750
So just as predicted...

355
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:29,708
the Millennium Earl
has returned to the Earth.

356
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:32,583
The Black Order was created
to avert the coming disaster.

357
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,208
Gather Apostles.

358
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:37,041
Gather accommodators.

359
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,666
Without accommodators,

360
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,833
Innocence is
incapable of activating.

361
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:46,916
These accommodators the
Generals speak of are Exorcists.

362
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,083
However...

363
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:49,750
To counteract the
power of the Exorcists,

364
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:53,583
the Millennium Earl created
Akuma's to hunt them down.

365
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,541
At its most basic level,

366
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,708
Innocence is created
by light energy,

367
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:03,375
whereas Akuma's are
created using dark energy.

368
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,750
As the Akuma's
do his dirty work,

369
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:06,833
the Earl searches the earth

370
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:09,791
for pieces of
Innocence to destroy.

371
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,333
To the best of our knowledge,

372
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,333
there are one-hundred-nine
pieces of Innocence

373
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:14,916
scattered around the world...

374
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,791
Now, it's our duty to
collect these pieces

375
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,375
before the Earl does...

376
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,041
If we fail to
do so, it will lead

377
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:24,791
to the annihilation
of the entire human race.

378
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:27,250
We need your help... Allen.

379
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,708
If we are unable to
win this holy war,

380
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:33,541
the cube's prophecy
will become a reality,

381
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:36,500
and the world as we know
it will cease to exist.

382
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,208
You must fight.

383
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:41,250
This is your destiny as
one who was chosen...

384
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:44,208
by Innocence.

385
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,208
It is your duty.

386
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,333
I'm looking forward to
working together with you...

387
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,666
Just know that the pay is awful.

388
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,375
Right.

389
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,541
Welcome to the Black Order.

390
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,583
Most of our active
exorcists aren't here...

391
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:03,791
They're currently
in various places

392
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:05,708
around the world
on assignment...

393
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,791
But you'll meet
them before long.

394
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:11,500
You should know Hevlaska
here is one of our exorcists.

395
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,583
I've been around a long
time... as guardian...

396
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:21,666
Ever since the Black Order was
established a century ago...

397
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,125
Allen...

398
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:26,875
May God's divine
protection be with you.

399
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:35,541
Wait a minute, I wonder
what happened to Timcanpy?

400
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,916
Never stop...

401
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Keep walking.

402
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,583
I've come so far, Mana...

403
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:56,250
I'm finally at
the starting point.

404
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,166
I promise...

405
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,875
I will never stop, no matter
what's put in front of me...

406
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:05,875
I'll continue the journey
until the very end.

407
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:40,458
The ancient town of Mater...

408
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:43,416
Reports were flooding
in of a ghost sighting,

409
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,833
but when we arrived,
the screams of Finders

410
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:48,083
were the only thing
we could hear.

411
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:52,333
On the next D. Gray-man:
"The Ghost of Mater."

412
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:55,625
Bring forth salvation to this
tormented Akuma's soul.
