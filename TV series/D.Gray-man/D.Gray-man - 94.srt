1
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,875
This "Edo Connection,"
what is it exactly?

2
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:43,708
[CROSS]
Just give the order.

3
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:45,083
I'll explain.

4
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:48,583
If you give the word,
it'll allow us to escape.

5
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:49,833
[ALLEN]
You know, Master,

6
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:51,958
you could've just said
that in the first place.

7
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:53,166
Did you hear that?

8
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,083
Yeah?

9
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:55,833
So play! What're
you waitin' for?

10
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:58,583
Let's get this over
with, short stack.

11
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:03,583
What did I tell you about
getting my name wrong?

12
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:05,791
Now's not the time, boys!

13
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:20,958
Ark, please cancel this
ship's connection to Edo.

14
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:37,666
[ALLEN] Do you hear me,
Ark? Open the gate.

15
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,833
The new destination will be...

16
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,708
[MIRANDA]
It's all my fault.

17
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:09,541
If only I had tried harder...

18
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,250
Look over there!

19
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:24,708
[BOOKMAN]
What is it?

20
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:32,416
[gasps]

21
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,166
Impossible!

22
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:59,041
[LAVI] Hey, everybody!
What did we miss?

23
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,333
[BOOKMAN]
Lavi?

24
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:02,125
[chuckles]

25
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,000
They found a way out!

26
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,916
What a relief! We really are
connected to the outside!

27
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,333
We're finally free!

28
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,000
[MIRANDA]
They're back.

29
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:14,000
All the time that
disappeared is returning!

30
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,708
Kanda survived too!

31
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,666
You're all so damn emotional.

32
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:21,333
[MARIE] Master Tiedoll!
Kanda's all right!

33
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:22,875
[TIEDOLL]
I know. I know.

34
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:25,083
Marie, do me a favor and ask him

35
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:28,041
if my new apprentice
is in one shape.

36
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,375
[KANDA]
You mean him?

37
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,500
[yelps]

38
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:38,291
Reporting.

39
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:43,750
Good to see you. I'm so
relieved you're all alive!

40
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:46,166
[OTHERS]
You can stop crying already!

41
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:52,250
Old man, aren't
you gonna say hi?

42
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,375
[grunts]

43
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:01,708
Well now, is that crying I hear?

44
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,750
[LAVI yelps]

45
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:06,625
I'm glad to see you too!

46
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:08,291
You idiot!

47
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:15,666
[LAVI]
Sorry.

48
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,666
[BOOKMAN] You're going to
give me a heart attack.

49
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,291
[WONG]
Director Bak!

50
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,458
No running in the halls.

51
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,708
What is it, Wong?

52
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:30,041
[WONG]
It's the Ark!

53
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:34,250
There's an entrance! A new
doorway has appeared!

54
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:37,625
[BAK]
Walker!

55
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:40,083
Oh, hey, Bak.

56
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:41,250
[BAK]
She's here.

57
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,333
[ALLEN]
We wanna contact headquarters.

58
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:45,541
Do you think we could
use your phone?

59
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:50,541
[BAK]
It's Lenalee!

60
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:55,708
[BAK]
Damn it! I got too worked up!

61
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:58,000
[WONG]
Director Bak!

62
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:00,208
Don't die on me!

63
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,708
Allen, who is that?

64
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:06,291
His name's Bak. He's the
Director of the Asian Branch.

65
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:08,291
If he's the one in charge,

66
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,458
how is this place
still standing?

67
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:11,833
Endure the pain and
survive for me!

68
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:14,291
[LO HUA]
I missed you so much, Allen!

69
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,958
Lo Hua! Hey, Li Kei, Shifu.

70
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:19,708
[LO HUA] You don't know
how glad I am you're okay!

71
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:21,458
Please don't start crying!

72
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,875
Wait, who is this?

73
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:30,833
She's obviously Allen's lover.

74
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:33,291
Hold up! What are
you implying exactly?

75
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:34,875
I think there's a mistake!

76
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,458
I doubt it.

77
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,083
[ALLEN] Hey! Where do
you think you're...?

78
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,041
Be honest.

79
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,125
On a scale of ten, eleven!

80
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:43,333
Sorry for the wait.

81
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,625
[LENALEE]
Stop, General! You can't leave!

82
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,958
Please let go of my face.

83
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,833
Don't disappear on us again!

84
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:53,916
[BAK screams]

85
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,750
[CROSS] How does one
say "no" to those eyes?

86
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:03,500
[LENALEE] I'm sick of
having to track him down!

87
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:06,541
[ALLEN] So that's why Lenalee
was assigned to the Cross Unit.

88
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:08,833
Komui's secret weapon.

89
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:11,625
He must've been
desperate to find him.

90
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:15,041
Can someone finally explain
to me who General Cross is?

91
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:17,083
[LO HUA squeals]

92
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:18,458
[LO HUA]
Did you hear that?

93
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:21,291
He called me Allen Walker's
woman! We're an item!

94
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,166
It's official!

95
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,500
At least they're happy.

96
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:28,583
[WONG]
Speak to me Bak!

97
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:33,291
Lenalee's purity. Her hair.
It's too much for me!

98
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,708
[WONG]
You have to find the strength

99
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:37,250
to pull yourself together!

100
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:40,875
[LAVI] I'm having real concerns
about the Asian Branch.

101
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:59,000
[STAFF gasping]

102
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:01,791
[ALL]
Welcome home!

103
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,750
[LENALEE]

[STAFF cheering]

106
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,500
Welcome back, dear Lenalee.

107
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,083
I'm home.

108
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:50,375
It's time, Miranda.

109
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:56,291
We're ready for
whatever happens next!

110
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:57,791
Let go of me, Marie!

--Better safe than sorry.
--I know what's gonna happen!

112
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:02,583
Well, this is it.

00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,958
Hope everyone's ready.

114
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:17,375
Now deactivating Time Record.

[LENALEE gasps]

117
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:34,625
You've finally come to.

118
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,500
Miranda!

119
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:39,583
You shouldn't be pushing
yourself, Lenalee!

120
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,750
It's our job to take
care of the injured.

121
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,500
That includes you.

122
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,125
You helped bring
everyone home;

123
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:48,166
now it's our turn to help you.

124
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,875
The Black Order requires both
Exorcists and healers.

00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:55,125
We take pride in our
work. Same as you.

126
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:02,208
[ALLEN]
I'm a wreck.

127
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:06,208
Look on the bright side,
at least you survived.

128
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,166
We made it.

129
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,916
You're right.

130
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:17,708
It feels good.

131
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:21,416
Good to finally be back home.

Where do you think you're
going, my dear Director Bak?

135

[screams]

136
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,708
[KOMUI] And what a lovely
bouquet of flowers

137
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,250
you have there!

138
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:52,958
[BAK]
Oh! What? These?

139
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,625
[KOMUI]
I thought I was clear.

140
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:58,166
Lenalee is not to have
visitors in her condition.

141
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,833
[KOMUI] I'll pass along
this pathetic arrangement!

142
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:05,125
Isn't the Asian Branch
having a difficult time

143
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:06,625
after the Akuma's attack?

144
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,458
You should head back since
you don't have a reason

145
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,416
to be here anymore.

146
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,916
Think again.

147
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:20,166
[BAK] The only thing pathetic
was your attempt to stop me!

148
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:26,291
[KOMUI'S DOLL] Never. No matter
what. Danger. Do not enter.

149
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,416
Never. No matter what...

150
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,291
[BAK]
Then I'll just have to go over!

151
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:33,958
[KOMUI'S DOLL] Never. No matter
what. Danger. Do not enter.

152
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:35,875
You think you can stand
in the way of my love

153
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:38,166
with such petty obstacles?

154
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:42,250
[KOMUI'S DOLL] Never. No matter
what. Danger. Do not enter.

155
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:46,750
Never. No matter what.
Danger. Do not enter.

[BAK]
Komui!

157
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:55,500
The warnings were in place
for your own safety.

158
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,125
[KOMUI'S DOLL]
Never. No matter what...

159
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,958
So sorry, Bak. Next time.

160
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,291
[REEVER]
Uhh...

161
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,875
It's breathtaking.

00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:11,375
You'll agree, the Ark is an
amazing feat in engineering.

00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:14,708
Quite different from how
the books describe it.

164
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:17,166
[WONG] Careful not to
get too close, sir.

165
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,541
[REEVER]
If I could echo that warning.

166
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,458
Let's say one were to
enter through the gate

167
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:22,916
in a manner like so...

168
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,416
[REEVER]
Um, Director?

169
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:29,083
[BAK] ...they'd be instantly
transported inside the Ark.

170
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,125
Excuse me.

171
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,500
[BAK] And were you
to go through here...

172
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:39,791
...you'd be transported to a
completely different place.

173
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:43,750
A "space time warp" as they call
it in science fiction novels.

174
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,625
[LI KEI]
Hey, Chief! No fair!

175
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:49,333
[STAFF A] How come you
get to go in by yourself?

176
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:51,333
We wanna explore the Ark, too!

177
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,916
I just want to
visit Headquarters!

178
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:59,291
[BAK] Remarkable
teleporting abilities.

179
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,500
Tell me, Section Leader Reever,

180
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:05,000
is the Ark currently situated
over the Black Order in Europe?

181
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,208
[REEVER]
Yeah...

182
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:09,416
[BAK] In addition,
I couldn't help but notice

183
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,500
besides its teleporting ability,

184
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,791
the Ark also has
several internal spaces

185
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:16,291
I like to call rooms.

186
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,750
Rooms where the Exorcists
fought the Noah,

187
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:23,958
the one for the Akuma factory,
and the mysterious piano.

188
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:26,375
It's difficult to believe
science like this has existed

189
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:29,375
for several thousand years.

190
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:32,625
And just who exactly
is the Millennium Earl?

191
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:35,875
Section Leader, why is
that guy even in here?

192
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,875
The Chief said no one
should enter the Ark,

193
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:41,750
so technically we
shouldn't be here either.

194
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:44,875
Not to worry gentlemen,
for I am a brilliant scientist.

195
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,125
My opinion gives us
permission to be here.

196
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,958
But you're only a
branch chief, right?

197
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:52,375
[REEVER]
Quiet, Johnny! Shh!

198
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:57,000
[KOMUI wailing]

199
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:59,416
You're crying way too
much, big brother.

200
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,541
[KOMUI] But it's gone!
Your beautiful hair!

201
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:05,083
Correction! The world's
most beautiful hair!

202
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,500
Get a grip on yourself, Komui!

203
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:09,416
[KOMUI]
But! But! But I can't help it!

204
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,041
If you can't control yourself,
you'll have to leave!

205
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,625
Not only are you being too loud,

206
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:15,666
but you're dirtying
the bed sheets, Chief!

207
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,583
What's so filthy about
these tears of grief?

208
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:19,708
It's your face!

209
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:22,000
You cut right to
the bone, head nurse.

210
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:25,000
Don't you think it's time for
you to head back to your office?

211
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,041
You've got a lot of
work to do, right?

212
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:28,583
[KOMUI]
I guess.

213
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:32,083
When I get better, I'll make
a strong pot of coffee for you.

214
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,000
Yeah.

215
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:41,833
Go to sleep...

216
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:43,291
[KOMUI]
Before I leave,

217
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,291
I made you this pillow that
plays a soothing lullaby.

218
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:46,791
My sweet, Lenalee...

219
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:49,708
That's not going near her.

220
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,458
[KOMUI]
But--! Uh, good night, Lenalee!

221
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:53,416
[chuckles]

222
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,125
[LENALEE]
Sorry about the racket.

223
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:57,833
You don't get it, Lenalee.

224
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:00,791
[LENALEE]
Huh? What's there to get?

225
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:03,916
The chief was just excited
to see you again.

226
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,166
He looked so happy.

227
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,166
[stomach growling]

228
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,291
[LAVI] Don't just stand there,
nurse! Do something!

229
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:17,625
I can't sleep with Krory's
stomach going crazy!

230
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,166
[NURSE A]
I don't know what to do.

231
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,791
I'd like to feed him, but I
can't until he wakes up first.

232
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,541
Sorry, Lavi.

233
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:24,958
Think that's rough?

234
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:27,583
I'm right beside him and have
a keen sense of hearing.

235
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:32,375
Hey, Kanda. Are you planning
some kind of escape?

236
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,625
How do they expect
me to get any sleep?

237
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:36,333
I'm going back to my room!

238
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:37,750
You can't go.

239
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:40,250
We haven't gotten permission
to leave the infirmary.

240
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:41,833
[KANDA]
Watch me.

241
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:45,750
[TIEDOLL] Yu Kanda. You should
listen to Marie for a change.

242
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,500
Step aside, General.

243
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:50,708
I just came by to see how
my precious sons were healing.

244
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:54,000
Speaking of which, what are you
doing out of bed in your state?

245
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,750
We're not your sons, Tiedoll.

246
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,875
And I would appreciate
it if in the future,

247
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,166
you would refrain from
addressing me as such.

248
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,125
I view all my apprentices
as though they were children.

249
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:04,750
Stop acting so embarrassed

250
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:07,750
and think of me like a father
doting on a sick child.

251
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,250
Just give up, Kanda.

252
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:12,375
That's the kind of
man our master is.

253
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:15,583
Kind? Smothering?

254
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:17,916
You represent everything
I despise in humans!

255
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,666
[NURSE A]
Stop! No violence in the ward!

256
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,000
[MARIE]
Settle down, Kanda!

257
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:24,875
So that guy is gonna be
your new master, Chaozii?

258
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:26,000
Yeah.

259
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:27,791
Well, he's certainly different.

260
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,875
Anyway, now that things
have settled down,

261
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,833
what're you guys planning next?

262
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:33,250
We're talking to
the Order to see

263
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:34,875
if they'll let us be Finders.

264
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,458
Really? That's great!

265
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:39,458
You didn't think we were gonna
leave you here alone, did ya?

266
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:42,291
By the way, have you
seen your hair?

267
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:43,583
Major bedhead.

268
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,333
[CHAOZII, MAOSA, KIE laughing]

269
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:49,291
Hey, Allen. You wanna
stop by the cafeteria?

270
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,791
You alive over there?

271
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,833
Allen?

272
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:56,958
Hello?

273
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:06,125
[LAVI]
It figures.

274
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:15,666
[TUP] Delicious as always.
You're somethin', Jerry.

275
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,000
[JOHNNY]
Allen!

276
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:17,958
[ALLEN]
Hm?

277
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,458
Hi, Johnny!

278
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:23,208
I know this is a little late,
but I wanted to thank you.

279
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,458
Huh? What're you talkin' about?

280
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:29,458
Regarding Suman, I heard things.

281
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:33,083
Like how you tried to save
him right to very end.

282
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:43,791
[ALLEN]
I tried, but I wasn't able to.

283
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,250
Forgive me.

284
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:48,833
[JOHNNY] There's nothing
to forgive. You tried.

285
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:50,166
Thank you!

286
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,250
Excuse me! I have to
get back to work!

287
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:55,833
Poor Johnny. He and Suman
used to be really good pals.

288
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:58,583
That's right. They would
play chess together.

289
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:00,750
[TUP] When he first
heard Suman had died,

290
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:06,791
he was inconsolable and fell
into a heavy depression.

291
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:09,208
We know Suman couldn't be saved.

292
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:11,375
But thank you for trying.

293
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:20,291
This is a lullaby,
isn't it, Timcanpy?

294
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:22,833
Strange.

295
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:24,750
When I read the poem,

296
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:29,166
in my head, it instantly
became a song.

297
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:33,041
Sometimes, it feels like there's
someone else up there with me.

298
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:35,083
Inside my head.

299
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:41,083
[ALLEN groans]

300
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:43,333
[ALLEN]
I lost my appetite.

301
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:54,250
[ALLEN] This path, is it the
road I've chosen to walk down?

302
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:57,375
For the rest of my life?

303
00:18:57,458 --> 00:19:02,958
Is it even my decision?
Or did someone choose it for me?

304
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:07,458
That can't be true. Right, Tim?

305
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:09,500
How could it be?

306
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:16,416
Those symbols on the
musical score...

307
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,833
...they were letters Mana
and I invented together

308
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:21,666
a long time ago.

309
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:25,041
I'd forgotten about them.

310
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:29,166
Those symbols only
Mana and I could read.

311
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,916
A secret language we created.

312
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:57,000
[LULU BELL] Well, Master,
they actually did it.

313
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,708
The download was incomplete

314
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:01,583
and we lost up to
80% of the factory.

315
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:05,166
This must have been Cross
Marian's ultimate goal.

316
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,541
[MILLENNIUM EARL] We can't just
pop another one of these out!

317
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:10,458
It takes tremendous
amounts of resources!

318
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,250
At a time when we
desperately needed

319
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,208
to manufacture more Akuma.

320
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:16,041
What a setback.

321
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:19,958
[MILLENNIUM EARL] The Exorcists
stole the Ark from us.

322
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:22,291
They gained control when there
shouldn't have even been

323
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,000
a piano aboard!

324
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:25,375
And I know how.

325
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,666
It seems the Fourteenth's
curse is alive and well

326
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,791
on the Ark after all this time.

327
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:33,958
What is this feeling? Anger?

328
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,666
Earl? You okay, lero?

329
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,000
[MILLENNIUM EARL] The Exorcists
and the Fourteenth.

330
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:40,750
So they think they
can join forces

331
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:46,083
and sabotage the tree
of Noah, do they?

332
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:48,291
Filthy, rotten sheep!

333
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:51,416
I'll lead them all
to the slaughter!

334
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:26,083
[ALLEN]
Director Malcolm C. Rouvelier,

335
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:28,583
a Special Inspector
from the Central Agency,

336
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:30,500
holds an advisory
council meeting.

337
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:32,833
The subject, my Master.

338
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:36,000
What shocking revelation
is he about to unearth?

339
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:39,750
On the next D.Gray-man:
"Lamb and Dog."

340
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:43,250
Bring forth salvation to
this poor Akuma's soul!

341
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,000
Tim doesn't need to eat,

342
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:49,416
so why is he going to
town on those dumplings?

343
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,750
I guess he's watched my
eating habits for so long,

344
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:53,375
that he's trying to mimic them.

345
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:55,166
[ALLEN yelps]

346
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,666
Not cool
